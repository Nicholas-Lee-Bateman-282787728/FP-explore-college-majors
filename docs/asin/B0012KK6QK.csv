I bought this video for those occasional days when I just feel a little bit tired or lazy, but don't want to blow off doing yoga altogether.  It has filled that need very well, but the pleasant surprise is that some of these practices (particularly the two longer ones in the ""B"" series) actually do make me feel like I've worked hard, albeit in a gentle way.  It's slow and steady, but you do get your heart rate up and your blood flowing.

1137810,A12CB5VR68K5T1,B0012KK6QK,Caravaggio38,"[12, 13]","This DVD is one of the better yoga DVDs I've tried.First it has an extensive library to explain the poses, which everyone, whether a beginner or a more advanced practitioner, should watch before starting.  The explanations are given in simple, understandable and clear words.Second, the sequences are indeed gentle vinyasa flows.  The sessions are divided into 2 series depending on one's practice level and experience, and each is divided further into 3 practices with different times.Third, the flows are simple, doable flows that anyone serious enough to do some exercise can do. To those who want to pretend they are exercising while not stressing your body, this is not the DVD for you.  Although one may not sweat with the program, the body nonetheless is doing yoga.  The flow is not hurried at all but relaxing.  It is a wonderful stretching program for athletes.Fourth, the instructions are given in a clear soothing voice.  Admittedly, I initially found the tone of Ms. Landwijt's voice a little bit patronizing, as if she were speaking to a 5 year old child.  However, I got past it as I assumed that she modulated her voice and manner of speaking to suit her program's intention of providing a gentle yoga practice.Fifth, the camera work is great because you see every step and movement that you need to see.  There is no confusion as to what you are supposed to do next.Lastly, I like the fact that she definitely tells you that the practice has ended so you don't have to get out of your shavasana in order to see if the practice is over.I don't know if this is Ms. Landwijt's debut DVD but it's good work.",5,"A true ""gentle"" yoga practice",1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1620,"['DVD', 'one', 'better', 'yoga', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'tried.First', 'extensive', 'library', 'explain', 'poses', 'everyone', 'beginner', 'more', 'advanced', 'practitioner', 'should', 'watch', 'starting', 'explanations', 'are', 'given', 'simple', 'understandable', 'clear', 'words.Second', 'sequences', 'are', 'indeed', 'gentle', 'vinyasa', 'flows', 'sessions', 'are', 'divided', '2', 'series', 'depending', 'one', 'practice', 'level', 'experience', 'divided', 'further', '3', 'practices', 'different', 'times.Third', 'flows', 'are', 'simple', 'doable', 'flows', 'anyone', 'serious', 'enough', 'do', 'exercise', 'can', 'do', 'who', 'want', 'pretend', 'are', 'exercising', 'not', 'stressing', 'body', 'not', 'DVD', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'sweat', 'program', 'body', 'nonetheless', 'doing', 'yoga', 'flow', 'not', 'hurried', 'relaxing', 'wonderful', 'stretching', 'program', 'athletes.Fourth', 'instructions', 'are', 'given', 'clear', 'soothing', 'voice', 'Admittedly', 'initially', 'found', 'tone', 'Ms.', 'Landwijt', 'voice', 'little', 'bit', 'patronizing', 'were', 'speaking', '5', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'However', 'got', 'past', 'assumed', 'modulated', 'voice', 'manner', 'speaking', 'suit', 'program', 'intention', 'providing', 'gentle', 'yoga', 'practice.Fifth', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'see', 'step', 'movement', 'need', 'see', 'confusion', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'next.Lastly', 'like', 'fact', 'definitely', 'practice', 'ended', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'shavasana', 'order', 'see', 'practice', 'over.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ms.', 'Landwijt', 'debut', 'DVD', 'good', 'work']",Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow

So many choices of segments and different lengths of workouts. Noticed others complained about the increasing times being the workout before with some moves added in to add length of time. I LOVED THAT--after I &#34;mastered&#34; the first segment, I was hesitant to move to the next (longer) segment b/c I didn't want to learn a brand new routine all over again and be awkward. PLEASANT SURPRISED and ELATED that the longer segments were so similar to the previous one--but she adds a new moves here and there to make the workout longer. THIS IS BRILLIANT! I've been using this DVD for several months now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my muscle tone.

The routines themselves aren't too challenging except for maybe some things like shoulder stand.I am new to yoga but I was looking for a DVD with a bit more challenge.  This DVD would be excellent for the evenings, to stretch you out and clear your mind.One thing to note though... the voice over (I'm assuming this is Zyrka) is...  interesting.  I'm not sure why she does this but she tends to streeeeeetch out words, I guess in an attempt to relax you?  It sounds like ""exhaaaaaaaling as you lift...  inhaaaaaaaling into cobra....""  It's kind of annoying.  I'll keep this DVD for days (or evenings) when I want a more mellow practice, but I don't know if it will ever become a favorite in my collection.Also lots of repeat footage.  There are three beginner practices of different lengths and three more advanced practices also of different lengths.

1137814,A3JIE49JMU4APL,B0012KK6QK,"Duhkgeorge ""Bashfull user""","[6, 6]","I once had a yoga instructor in Portland who did this incredible slow stretchy yoga.  It was calming, meditative and when the positions were done correctly, it could also be a mild workout, but the workout wasn't the point, it was a side benefit.  I moved from Portland and have been on a quest ever since for that same wonderful yoga.  Years later I discovered the name of the yoga I was looking for and that was Vinyasa.This DVD does the best job over anything I've yet found to replicating that incredible instructor I had in portland.This DVD may not be for you if:If you're looking for a workout that makes you sweatIf you're new to yoga, you'll have a learning curve (which the dvd provides) to learn the names of the positions.  Flow yoga moves from one position to the next so in any yoga situation you'll be better off knowing the poses.You want short bursts of exercise you can rush through and then dash out the door (10 minute pilates or yoga as an example).This DVD may be for you if:You like AM Rodney but wish you spent more time in a stretch or had a little more varietyYou enjoy relaxing stretchesYou enjoy taking your time and have the time to take. (shortest session is 36 minutes)My personal check list of what I was looking for:Is this Vinyassa or slow/stretchy yoga?  YesIs it easy to follow along?  Yes.  Great verbal communication with only a hiccup here or there.  Four to five stars.Does it have options/mixes?  Yes.  You're purchasing a lot for your money relative to some DVDs out there (looking at you am/pm yoga with great AM but grating pm)Is the voice relaxing?  Yes, calm female voice.Pretty/calming background music?  Yes.Relaxing natural background on video?  Yes.Series A is easier, Series B is a little more challenging.  You have different time limits to choose from starting about 36 minutes and going up to about an hour for a total of 6 different worksouts.  It includes the meditative cool down time.  The longer the times the more challenging it can become as well (challenge being relative... maybe complex would be the correct term).The DVD has a video to introduce you to the DVD and yoga.  Also Has a video to introduce you to the poses.Overall I'm happy and impressed.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  Finding the time to do this will be challenging, but worth it.The last question some may have is &#34;how difficult is it?&#34;  That's a difficult questions to answer.  If you're relatively flexible and in moderate shape, this would be an extremely easy dvd.  If you're extremely overweight or inflexible, this could be a little challenging, as are most workouts.  It's filled with long moments in child's pose, 5-10 seconds holding plank, flowing into warrior 1 and 2, cobra, down dog, tree, bridge, mountain and other VERY basic yoga moves with only a couple that might not be completely possible for some until they're more in shape or better balanced (you can go to walls for support if needed as a modification).  Shorter options will be easier and you can work your way into more difficult stretches if needed.That's about the best I can answer the question.Anyway, this was fantastic for me.

1137815,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B0012KK6QK,Jenny G,"[17, 23]","I had initially ordered this DVD with two ideas in mind.  One, to have a nice relaxing and gentle practice on my days off from my major exercise, or even to do after my regular exercise for flexibility and stretching.  The second to learn Flow yoga better before trying Shiva Rea's more advanced style.I tried this DVD today. It was certainly better than the first DVD, but after so many downward facing dogs, I was starting to get bored with this one too.  She narrates as if she is reading a book for a 5 year old (one other reviewer also mentioned her narration style, only I was not able to get past it like the other reviewer was).  I made it about half way through the shorter intermediate routine, and then stopped. Zyrka's style is very much instructional, which I also find boring.  As I tried her first DVD and this one, she makes me feel like yoga is drudgery, something I have to get through.  There is no feeling of joy or that yoga can be a pleasant thing.I also have the impression many of the reviewers are hard-core yoga followers, and that this DVD may offer something for them to get ""deeper into their practice"".  I am not a hard-core yoga follower. For me, I exercise on regular basis (elliptical, brisk walking, strength, flexibility, stretching), so yoga is simply something that complements the other fitness activities I do.  I do understand getting a better understanding of the poses or breathing with yoga, but this DVD didn't do that for me.If you are like me, and do not like Zyrka's style, and are in reasonably good shape but still fairly new to yoga, you may find Shiva Rea's Beginner's Flow yoga a better alternative. If you are very out of shape or are a couch potato, then Zyrka's beginner flows are probably more appropriate. For me, Shiva makes yoga a joyful experience, and something I should enjoy doing. It was much more appropriate for me.One other comment on the Pose Guide on Zyrka's DVDs. It is a nice add, although I think it would be very difficult to watch the whole thing from start to finish.  I have another yoga DVD that also has a guide but this guide is interactive.  Meaning that while you are going through the practice, when a new pose is introduced the name of the pose is flashed up on the screen. You have a few seconds where you can press enter on your remote control and it will bring up the practice guide for that particular pose so you can view it while you are doing it. It then returns back to the practice and you continue on.  I think this kind of guide is much more usable.",3,Boring...not for me,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,2543,"['had', 'initially', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'two', 'ideas', 'mind', 'One', 'have', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'gentle', 'practice', 'days', 'major', 'exercise', 'even', 'do', 'regular', 'exercise', 'flexibility', 'stretching', 'second', 'learn', 'Flow', 'yoga', 'better', 'trying', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'more', 'advanced', 'style.I', 'tried', 'DVD', 'today', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'first', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'downward', 'facing', 'dogs', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'bored', 'one', 'too', 'reading', 'book', '5', 'year', 'old', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'also', 'mentioned', 'narration', 'style', 'only', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'get', 'other', 'reviewer', 'was', 'made', 'half', 'way', 'shorter', 'intermediate', 'routine', 'then', 'stopped', 'Zyrka', 'style', 'very', 'much', 'instructional', 'also', 'find', 'boring', 'tried', 'first', 'DVD', 'one', 'feel', 'yoga', 'drudgery', 'something', 'have', 'get', 'feeling', 'joy', 'yoga', 'can', 'be', 'pleasant', 'thing.I', 'also', 'have', 'impression', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'hard-core', 'yoga', 'followers', 'DVD', 'may', 'offer', 'something', 'get', 'deeper', 'practice', 'am', 'not', 'hard-core', 'yoga', 'follower', 'exercise', 'regular', 'basis', 'elliptical', 'brisk', 'walking', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'stretching', 'so', 'yoga', 'simply', 'something', 'other', 'fitness', 'activities', 'do', 'do', 'understand', 'getting', 'better', 'understanding', 'poses', 'breathing', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'me.If', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'Zyrka', 'style', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'shape', 'still', 'fairly', 'new', 'yoga', 'may', 'find', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Beginner', 'Flow', 'better', 'alternative', 'are', 'very', 'shape', 'are', 'couch', 'potato', 'then', 'Zyrka', 'beginner', 'flows', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Shiva', 'joyful', 'experience', 'something', 'should', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'me.One', 'other', 'comment', 'Pose', 'Guide', 'Zyrka', 'DVDs', 'nice', 'add', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'start', 'finish', 'have', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'also', 'guide', 'guide', 'interactive', 'Meaning', 'are', 'going', 'practice', 'when', 'new', 'pose', 'introduced', 'name', 'pose', 'flashed', 'up', 'screen', 'have', 'few', 'seconds', 'where', 'can', 'press', 'enter', 'remote', 'control', 'will', 'bring', 'up', 'practice', 'guide', 'particular', 'pose', 'can', 'view', 'are', 'doing', 'then', 'back', 'practice', 'continue', 'think', 'kind', 'guide', 'much', 'more', 'usable']",Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow

Based on other reviews, I knew this cd would be easy and I wanted something that I could do on days when I was feeling sluggish and not wanting a heavy-duty workout. This cd, however, was a bit too easy for my semi-intermediate yoga experience. This is great for novices.

The music is soothing, the voice gentle non judgemental and pace is just perfect to unwind after a long day and let those muscles relax. I use it every single day and love it. The only reason I gave it one star less is because some scenes freeze for a couple of seconds before moving to the next. I realized after a few times that the recording is that way, easy to think the DVD is not playing right.

Two years ago I tried yoga on a whim after a particularly hard workout.  I went into the session unsure of what to expect, but expecting to relax.  I was messed up in my back and hips.  Following the 40 minute routine (Vinyassa?) I was tired.  Amazingly, it hit me hours later, I felt better physically than I had in months.  I told my wife it was as if I'd had the equivalent of ten chiropractic adjustments worth of therapy!  It was amazing!  Fast forward to now: I'm a personal trainer certified in corrective exercise techniques, learning under the likes of Gray Cook and Charlie Weingroff.  These leading experts on...well...""fixing"" athletes both relate how properly done Yoga is phenomenal at reconnecting the body and autonomic functions together.  I'm a huge Yoga believer now.  For this DVD I needed something I could do at home since making it to Yoga sessions in town has become difficult.  I needed something relaxing, not a workout (I get plenty of sweating in BJJ classes).  This DVD and the voice (Zyrka?) is beautiful and simple...in fact I just finished my night of the beginner 36 minute session.  Going into the session I was hurting, left leg numb and right arm numb with my back aching from a particularly tough night of class.  I honestly didn't expect to get much ""help"" from the Yoga session, simple as it is, but again: WOW.  I feel so much better!  Amazing!  None of my own stretching, twisting or other movements helped, but this gentle soothing session did.  And as another reviewer wrote, Zyrka's voice-over is just so amazingly soothing and almost magically calm that I can't describe it.  Her voice alone makes the session so wonderful.My only complaint, if you will, is the speed of transition in some of the routines.  It makes a number of the stretches/poses transition at a rate much faster than one can synch with breathing (4 sec in/out) so there is a rushed sensation at times.  This may be because she's narrating and the timing doesn't match well?  IF the sequences would allow for a full inhale/exhale at all the positions, the DVD would get six (6) stars from me. As it is, it loses one.  It is almost trivial but, seriously, that is the only ""hit"" I can give.  I will be looking for other DVDs from Zyrka.  If she has a meditation sequence, I will definitely get that--her voice, cadence and just....personality...carry through and would keep me focused and relaxed enough to put my ADD away and actually meditate!  Hope this helps :-)",4,Incredibly Soothing Voice.....,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,2641,"[""'m"", '48', 'practice', 'intensive', 'strength', 'training', 'martial', 'arts', 'work', 'BJJ', 'Brazilian', 'Jiu', 'Jitsu', 'am', 'usually', 'sore', 'getting', 'injured', 'recovering', 'injury', 'Two', 'years', 'ago', 'tried', 'yoga', 'whim', 'particularly', 'hard', 'workout', 'went', 'session', 'unsure', 'what', 'expect', 'expecting', 'relax', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'back', 'hips', 'Following', '40', 'minute', 'routine', 'Vinyassa', 'was', 'tired', 'Amazingly', 'hit', 'hours', 'later', 'felt', 'better', 'physically', 'had', 'months', 'told', 'wife', 'was', ""'d"", 'had', 'equivalent', 'ten', 'chiropractic', 'adjustments', 'therapy', 'was', 'amazing', 'Fast', 'forward', 'now', ""'m"", 'personal', 'trainer', 'certified', 'corrective', 'exercise', 'techniques', 'learning', 'likes', 'Gray', 'Cook', 'Charlie', 'Weingroff', 'leading', 'experts', 'well', 'fixing', 'relate', 'how', 'properly', 'done', 'Yoga', 'phenomenal', 'reconnecting', 'body', 'autonomic', 'functions', 'together', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Yoga', 'believer', 'now', 'DVD', 'needed', 'something', 'could', 'do', 'home', 'making', 'Yoga', 'sessions', 'town', 'become', 'difficult', 'needed', 'something', 'relaxing', 'not', 'workout', 'get', 'plenty', 'sweating', 'BJJ', 'classes', 'DVD', 'voice', 'Zyrka', 'beautiful', 'simple', 'fact', 'just', 'finished', 'night', 'beginner', '36', 'minute', 'session', 'Going', 'session', 'was', 'hurting', 'left', 'leg', 'numb', 'right', 'arm', 'numb', 'back', 'aching', 'particularly', 'tough', 'night', 'class', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'much', 'help', 'Yoga', 'session', 'simple', 'again', 'WOW', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Amazing', 'None', 'own', 'stretching', 'twisting', 'other', 'movements', 'helped', 'gentle', 'soothing', 'session', 'did', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Zyrka', 'voice-over', 'just', 'so', 'amazingly', 'soothing', 'almost', 'magically', 'calm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'voice', 'alone', 'session', 'so', 'wonderful.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'will', 'speed', 'transition', 'routines', 'number', 'stretches/poses', 'transition', 'rate', 'much', 'faster', 'one', 'can', 'synch', 'breathing', '4', 'sec', 'in/out', 'so', 'rushed', 'sensation', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'narrating', 'timing', ""n't"", 'match', 'well', 'sequences', 'would', 'allow', 'full', 'inhale/exhale', 'positions', 'DVD', 'would', 'get', 'six', '6', 'stars', 'one', 'almost', 'trivial', 'seriously', 'only', 'hit', 'can', 'give', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Zyrka', 'meditation', 'sequence', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'voice', 'cadence', 'just', '.personality', 'carry', 'would', 'keep', 'focused', 'relaxed', 'enough', 'put', 'ADD', 'away', 'actually', 'meditate', 'Hope']",Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow
