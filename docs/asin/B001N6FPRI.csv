1219138,A3UEPWWN7KW3HD,B001N6FPRI,C. Scheller,"[1, 1]","You can read the other reviews to see how great the movie was. I just wanted to clarify one thing:The CD you receive is more of a score instead of a soundtrack. I didn't read the track listing before buying (though it doesn't matter, since I bought it for the movie and the CD was just bonus). So it doesn't have the actual songs I really wanted, like ""Maa"", ""Bum Bum Bole"", ""Mera Jahan"" etc... I found those on iTunes, however. Also, if you search ""taara Zameen Par"" here on Amazon it will pull up two different albums that have the songs on them, though with different names. For example, ""Bum Bum Bole"" is called ""Dekho Dekho"". It's rather confusing.So, the point of this review is so people aren't surprised when they pop in the CD in the CD player and can't find those popular songs, like I was. Either way, hey, free soundtrack with the price of the movie.",5,Movie was fantastic,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,862,"['can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'wanted', 'clarify', 'one', 'thing', 'CD', 'receive', 'more', 'score', 'instead', 'soundtrack', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'track', 'listing', 'buying', ""n't"", 'matter', 'bought', 'movie', 'CD', 'was', 'just', 'bonus', ""n't"", 'have', 'actual', 'songs', 'really', 'wanted', 'Maa', 'Bum', 'Bum', 'Bole', 'Mera', 'Jahan', 'etc', 'found', 'iTunes', 'however', 'Also', 'search', 'taara', 'Zameen', 'Par', 'here', 'Amazon', 'will', 'pull', 'up', 'two', 'different', 'albums', 'have', 'songs', 'different', 'names', 'example', 'Bum', 'Bum', 'Bole', 'called', 'Dekho', 'Dekho', 'rather', 'confusing.So', 'point', 'review', 'so', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'when', 'pop', 'CD', 'CD', 'player', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'popular', 'songs', 'was', 'way', 'hey', 'free', 'soundtrack', 'price', 'movie']",Like Stars on Earth

1219140,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001N6FPRI,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[52, 56]","In 2007, director Aamir Khan (""Earth"", ""Ghulam"", ""Ishq"", ""Rangeela"" and a long list of other popular films) and writer/creative director Amole Gupte began work on ""Taare Zameen Par"" (Like Stars on Earth).  After its screening in theaters, the film received was critically acclaimed, amassed several awards but most importantly raised awareness of dyslexia in India but also around the world.Now this remarkable film is available on DVD in the US from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment with a special 3-disc set which includes a bonus DVD with special features and the original soundtrack for the film.  Plus two postcards featuring the two award winning artwork from the film.""Like Stars on Earth"" revolves around an 8-year-old boy named Ishaan Awashthi (played by Darsheel Safary), a boy who is repeating his third-grade.  A child who is imaginative and also creative but once he sees words or mathematical problems, they are backwards.  But because of this, it affects his young life and teachers including his family look at him as disobedient and always causing problems.Unfortunate for Ishaan, things continue to get worse and worse and it comes to the point that his parents, especially his father has had enough of his disobedience and sends him off to boarding school.Young Ishaan doesn't understand why his parents did this and now a young boy without a family continues in boarding school and yet again, the teachers and students don't understand what his problem is.  That is until a new art teacher named Ram Shankar Nikumbh arrives and having worked with children with disabilities, he is drawn to Ishaan because he is depressed and often scolded and feels the need to help him.Seeing Ishaan as a little boy who's spirit has been crushed by the adults and people around him, Ram discovers something special about the boy and now, more than anything, wants to help him before its too late.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Like Stars on Earth"" is a beautiful film presented in Widescreen (2:35:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions).  Capturing various areas of India but also inclusion of breathtaking scenes.  One thing that helped is Khan's commitment to perfection, from the scenery and the shots that he wanted, together with cinematographer M. Sethuraaman, they managed to capture many pieces of scenes that show the emotional side of Ishaan but also capturing the many children at the school and the various surroundings.  Vibrant colors matches its artistic presentation.  Picture quality is very well done as you can expect from a Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment release.As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, English and Hind Language tracks.  I watched the film with both audio and first, the English dub is terrific.  Although not explained, I'm guessing that the talent re-recorded the dialogue in English and these are not dubbed English tracks that sound Western.  Fantastic English dubbing and one of the best dub jobs I've seen on a live action film that remained true to the original film.  Ff course, the Hindi track is well-done and dialogue is clear and understandable on both audio tracks.  Also, the music is very nice and clear as well.  Audio is mostly front and center channel driven but I preferred to watch the film with stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.Subtitles are in English and Hindi.I really hope that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment considers releasing this film on Blu-ray because it sports beautiful visuals and audio.  It's one of those films that you definitely want to see in HD.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Like Stars on Earth"" comes with the following special features. Included are:DVD DISC 1:DVD disc 1 contains the film but you have the option to watch the film with an isolated music score.DVD DISC 2:* Panel Discussion on Children - (43:05) Director Aamir Khan hosts a panel on dyslexia featuring Masarrat Khan (a clinical psychologist and member of the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association),  Dr. Vrajesh Udani (pediatric neurologist), Dr. Harish Shetty (psychiatrist) and Medha Lotlekar (educationist and teacher).

And definitely an easy, deserving pick for one of the best DVD releases in the US for a foreign film for 2010.Before watching this film, I was intrigued that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment picked up an Indian film for release but I'm glad they did.  ""Like Stars on Earth"" is a wonderful film that is just heartwarming and captivating that I really enjoyed the message of how children with dyslexia can grow up to become talented individuals.  People such as Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci and even Walt Disney himself were among people who grew up with dyslexia during a time when people didn't know what it was and I would assume, like Ishaan's character, had challenges in early childhood that probably were heartbreaking.The fact that the film has changed things and risen awareness in India is wonderful but most importantly, for US viewers, I think it also drives home the fact that any child who has some sort of disability, it's not the end.  With help, these children can grow up to be talented individuals.It's a shame that the film was not selected for consideration for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film"" and part of the reason is that the film is quite long at 165 minutes and that it has a lot of musical content.  And I applaud director Aamir Khan for not cutting up the film just to achieve an award.  There is a reason why this film is long and it's a story arc to show Ishaan being misunderstood, to Ishaan being separated from his family and attending boarding school and the final arc in which his teacher notices his special talent and tries to help him overcome dyslexia.  As for the music, what kind of Indian film would this be without the music. Music is important to this film and even those little bits of pieces of scenes included in the music is important and yes, although the music is featured in longer duration and not short pieces, it would be very difficult to cut out.As for the DVD release, I applaud Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for releasing the film with the DVD and bonus DVD but also the inclusion of the musical soundtrack.  In the past, when it came to foreign films, this was seen as a positive for those releasing Japanese movie, anime or video game soundtracks and it only fostered the growth in the US and internationally.  I want to see more of this from Walt Disney and the film features beautiful music from Shankar Mahadevan, Loy Mendonsa, Ehsaan Noorani and more.For parents who are interested in purchasing the film.  It is worth it and I watched it along with my six-year-old.  There is scenes of violence but it is integral to the film to show how the character of Ishaan is seen different not just by his teachers and family but also other kids.  Because he has been told that he's wrong all the time and has this disability, his spirit has been crushed and although he doesn't react and doesn't speak that much, the kids pick on him and there is a scene where he does get hurt, he leaves school but its important to watch and explain things to your kids about those scenes.  This happens earlier on in the film but trust me, there is a great reward once you reach the end of the film.The film is truly heartwarming, inspiring and I admit it made me shed a couple of tears.  Overall, ""Like stars on Earth"" is a fantastic release and definitely is highly recommended! A+",5,"The film is truly heartwarming, inspiring and I admit it made me shed a couple of tears.

1219153,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B001N6FPRI,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","I say that as a fan of all the Khans except Salman! As anyone whose read even one of my reviews here I make no bones of the fact that I'm a huge fan of Hrithik Roshan and Amitabh Bachchan, and Mr. A. Khan is right up there with them. He might not be as tall as both, or have the dancing skills of one, but when it comes to movies his talent, and his intellect, are lethal. In fact, if you read anything about the man at all you will notice the phrase ""Mr. Perfectionist"" in place of his name in at least two places. But lots of people are talented and intelligent, what sets Mr. A. Khan a part from his most of his fellow Khans is that he'll take on things that a 'typical Bollywood Star' just doesn't do. Whether it's a Revolution against the British using Cricket inLagaan, Anniversary Editionwith a potential romance with an English woman, a man who ruthlessly hunts down the gangsters who killed his girlfriend and destroyed his short term memory inGhajini, the man takes risks. He melts into the skins of his characters flawed or heroic with no thought to his 'brand' because his brand is passion and perfection. FromDil chahta haito the upcoming Dhoom 3 there isn't anything he won't take on if he has a passion for it. Fortunately for all lovers of great films, he is first a foremost a lover of movies and decided acting in them just wasn't enough.""Like Stars On Earth, Every Child Is Special"" is a directorial debut and it combines the two great passions of Mr. A. Khan, movie making, and social issues. The modern world of today is fiercely competitive and nowhere is that more inculcated into a society than in the schoolroom, by the time a child is out of the second grade these days college is already being pounded into their minds. Don't get me wrong, I wish I could've finished college. But what happens when a child doesn't live up to the ""standards"" set by our modern ways of thinking? What happens when the child is misunderstood, and what is thought of as laziness or naughtiness, is actually a cry for help? What happens when expectations are so high and failure is the ultimate disgrace. What truly defines success? These are all questions that are put forth in this film and handled with a truly elegant and refined manner. It's not an original story, but The Bard himself never had an original story in his entire life.Ishaan Awasthi, is an eight year old boy from a middleclass family in Mumbai, and he is a ""Problem Child"" with a capital P-C. His highest scores on tests are two's and three's out of twenty. He's belligerent, defiant, inattentive, and wherever he goes chaos seems to follow. His teachers are fed up not wanting to have him in the third grade for the third time. His father, goes around roaring like a lion convinced that his youngest son is destined to be a failure in life. His mother wavers between acute frustration, despair, and worry for her beloved child. At her wits end, she cannot understand why all her love, teaching, and effort, seem to do nothing to improve Ishaan's grades, or his behavior. His older brother Yohan, is a top student and athlete, everything Ishaan is not. Yohan is the only person in Ishaan's life that isn't angry with him. To make matters worse, Ishaan doesn't know why he is the way he is and the few times he tries to express his problem he's greeted with anger and ridicule.Our cast of characters may not know what the problem is, but we the audience are hit in the face with it in the first frame. Disney did an incredible job with the animations here, the colors and the chaos of flipping and floating letters, numbers, and sentences in the images builds frustration in we the viewers as we're immersed into to the clamor of Ishaan's mind. It's overwhelming, and combining that with the pressures from the outside world, we're thrown into the deep end of Ishaan's suffering. But we're also thrown into his genius.I won't tell anymore about the story because you can figure out where it's going. But, I will say that the performances and direction in this movie are superlative. Darsheel Safary, is... wow I can't think of an adjective to describe just how good he is. For a *then* nine year old to match the intensity, and naturalness of his costars in his film debut is astounding! This young man (now around 15) has got the ability to use his eyes to let you deep into his soul, and I personally was struck by the depth of his sensitivity and understanding, and the fact that he could be downright unlikable in one scene where he deliberately troubles his mother. His naturalness never wanes even for a moment. Now that he's a young man, I hope that he has amazing success no matter where life takes him. I also hope that he's proud of this film until his last breath, it's a bigger accomplishment than most people will have in their whole lives.A super protagonist needs an equally good antagonist to truly shine and Vipin Sharma is the perfect foil here; as the success obsessed, driven, father. There are times in this movie when he arouses the very deepest hatred. My mom literally said ""This man is evil"" something that shocked me because she raised two kids with special needs, and if anyone knows the strain and helplessness that goes with that it's her. I replied, ""Ammi, he's not capable of understanding what Ishaan is going through anymore than Ishaan can understand his letters right now."" Now, don't get me wrong, that doesn't absolve his cruelty but who wants to sit through a three hour movie where you have a father of a young boy that you hate from beginning to end? The script, Mr. A. Khan's direction, and Mr. Sharma's performance is layered with moments where you feel compassion and you grieve for the fact that the man is so limited in his mindset, and how painful it is as he slowly comes to terms with the fact that his entire belief system is damaging his child. A truly great role that enhances Darsheel Safary's performance.Tisca Chopra, is an actress I'm totally unfamiliar with thus far. Her performance as Ishaan's mother I felt was pretty flawless, she inhabited the role of a middleclass housewife and a devoted but frazzled mother in a natural and unaffected way. The bond between mother and son, felt genuine and warm which is the perfect counterbalance to the relationship between father and son.Special shout out to Sachet Engineer as Yohan. The perfect son, who wishes he wasn't quite so perfect. It's such a minor role, but it's vital, because in the first half of the film he's the positive voice, the cheerleader for Ishaan. Without it, the first half would be far too heavy and heart-wrenching.Tanay Chheda, is another boy who befriends Ishaan and struggles physically. I have to say, that kid deserves lots of applause for wearing the leg brace even though he's healthy in real life. I had to wear the same brace at that age for real and they hurt. So I want his performance appreciated despite it's brevity.Mr. A. Khan's performance is of course, up to his reputation. So, let's talk about his Direction... He's a part of the school of directors in Hindi cinema that blends the wonderful traditions of the past, and the more polished narrative style of the modern day. And why not, he's produced movies by the great Ashutosh Gowariker, and worked under the direction of Farhan Akhtar? Add to that, a venerable Bollywood pedigree, and his complete dedication and it's a home run; or perhaps I should say he's hit a sixer! He put together a fantastic team and each frame is carefully thought out and a true labor of love. If there is one area Mr. A. Khan doesn't not quite excel it's in dance but that works here. And to give the man serious kudos he's honest and doesn't take credit for his dance number when he didn't direct it.Music: The dynamic trio of Shankar, Loy, and Ehsaan craft a truly perfect complimentary score to the movie. The songs are beautiful, the melodies that fit every part of the narrative. But make no mistake, the songs do not carry this movie as they do in other Bollywood films.  ""Bum Bum Bole"" is my mom's favorite and I don't blame her, it's a joyful celebration of carefree innocence. But my personal favorite is ""Maa"" so perfect for the bond in childhood, but if one is blessed, then it becomes even more true in adulthood.I can't recommend this movie enough and my three disc set comes with some exceptional goodies...1. Disc 1 the movie with a Hindi Track but also dubbed in English. I first saw this movie on Netflix with the Hindi Track and used the subtitles which you can also choose. But I also watched the English dubbed version. It was extremely well done, but truthfully I prefer the Hindi.2.Disc 2 special features with full subtitles available. Deleted scenes, a making of documentary which you should watch, and a panel with Aamir Khan and prominent teachers, neurologists, and experts on dyslexia and other learning and behavioral problems that effect children such as ADD ADHAD Downs Syndrome, and even Cerebral Palsy. It's mainly meant to reach out to people who hesitate to act when their children have difficulties, and a not-too-subtle nudge to the educators of India to look beyond the typical ""the child is naughty or lazy"" attitude when they see a child struggling in their class. Still, it's worth a look. Aamir Khan is one of India's most visible and prominent humanitarians of this decade even making the cover of Time Magazine and it's list of 100 most influential people. There's also trailers, still shots, to look through.3. Disc 3 is the entire soundtrack in it's glory. To be extra sweet they also include mini-prints of the paintings in the film.Everything is exceptional in quality and the price extremely reasonable so do not skimp. I can't recommend this film enough and after the last two Bollywood movies I reviewed this has re-ignited my passion and my obsession.",5,"5 Stars Aren't Enough, Khan of the Khans AAMIR
