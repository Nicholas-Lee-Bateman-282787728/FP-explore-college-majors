There are no laughs.  The only highlight is the fashion designed by Dior.  An exception even to that, however, is the hat worn by Myrna Loy in the early scenes of the film.  It looks as though an arrow was stuck in it.  For entertainment on any level, this is close to zero.  Even the finest actors can't do much with writing of this sort.",1,"Very, very light",1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,483,"['1956', 'comedy', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Olivia', 'De', 'Haveland', 'Tommy', 'Noonan', 'script', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'are', 'laughs', 'only', 'highlight', 'fashion', 'designed', 'Dior', 'exception', 'even', 'however', 'hat', 'worn', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'early', 'scenes', 'film', 'arrow', 'was', 'stuck', 'entertainment', 'level', 'close', 'zero', 'Even', 'finest', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'writing', 'sort']",The Ambassador's Daughter VHS

499871,A1JLC26PMGW5ZS,B00000FAQP,Devin Melancon,"[4, 4]","THE DVD...I've viewed bad public domain DVDs before but this was something to scream at. There are scenes when someone is talking and half of their face is in the frame and the other half is cut off. There are hisses, pops, and other unpleasant soundtrack flaws throughout (at times it even blurs dialogue). The screen jumps constantly and is full of haze. Until a good quality print of this is issued, this particular DVD should be avoided. Then again, you may want to avoid the movie altogether...THE MOVIE...Sadly, the movie itself is scarcely better than the DVD on which it is presented. Despite a knockout cast (what drew me to this was the fact that Myrna Loy and Olivia de Havilland are both in it), the film never comes together and is missing the vital spark needed for a romantic comedy. Despite being about 40 at the time the film was made, de Havilland looks very youthful and is effortlessly believable as the youthful title character. But even she can't save this highly disappointing film.

Well, why not?  She was good in practically everything I've seen her in and if you've ever watched her carry the Sonny Tufts burdened wartime bomb, GOVERNMENT GIRL, you can believe that she'd do justice to herself and her character in this trifle.The story concerns Joan Fisk, daughter of the American ambassador to France, who is bored showing Americans the well-known French sights and wants to prove to her father that no all GIs are wolves.  She accepts a date with Sgt. Danny Sullivan, played by John Forsythe, and immediately falls for him.The rest of this movie concerns rather silly attempts to conceal the relationship from her father and possibly everyone else. With John Forsythe, Tommy Noonan, MYrna Loy, Adolph Menjou, Edward Arnold.By the way, the picure quality on the copy that I saw was certainly okay, pretty fair, in fact.I give THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER Three Stars.",3,The Ambassador's Daughter,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,1017,"['review', 'THE', 'AMBASSADOR', 'DAUGHTER', '1956', 'directed', 'written', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'Olivia', 'Haviland', '1956', 'romcom', 'Well', 'why', 'not', 'was', 'good', 'practically', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'carry', 'Sonny', 'Tufts', 'burdened', 'wartime', 'bomb', 'GOVERNMENT', 'GIRL', 'can', 'believe', ""'d"", 'do', 'justice', 'herself', 'character', 'trifle.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Joan', 'Fisk', 'daughter', 'American', 'ambassador', 'France', 'who', 'bored', 'showing', 'Americans', 'well-known', 'French', 'sights', 'prove', 'father', 'GIs', 'are', 'wolves', 'date', 'Sgt', 'Danny', 'Sullivan', 'played', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'immediately', 'him.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'rather', 'silly', 'attempts', 'conceal', 'relationship', 'father', 'possibly', 'everyone', 'else', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'Tommy', 'Noonan', 'MYrna', 'Loy', 'Adolph', 'Menjou', 'Edward', 'Arnold.By', 'way', 'picure', 'quality', 'copy', 'saw', 'was', 'certainly', 'okay', 'pretty', 'fair', 'fact.I', 'give', 'AMBASSADOR', 'DAUGHTER', 'Three', 'Stars']",The Ambassador's Daughter VHS
