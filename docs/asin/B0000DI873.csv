It is charming and fascinating for its Old World setting and Victorian Era charm.  This particular version was on television several years ago, and I really liked it, not remembering exactly, but thinking it was not the one I had seen before.  I didn't remember the songs.  It didn't need them, but they were good.  ""Amsterdam"" is particularly lovely.  Prefer this version over the Disney version, which is good, but some different.It's a gentle movie, with a simple, honest ring, realistic with both sides of life and has some good humor.  The family reminds me of others, exhibiting personal strengths that serve well.  Many can relate to the big brother-little sister  thing, enjoy the young love abloom, recognize the lean years and being different from those around because of them.  You feel like the family would have held onto their strengths, even if their result was not as positive as it came out.Eleanor Parker is a favorite.  Richard Basehart is strong and effective here.  The father, the children, certainly Hans, everyone is good in this.  It is a lovely, old fashioned film set in Holland with old customs and ways.  There's a Father Christmas visit on Christmas Eve, a respected tradition in that part of the world.  Their small house is picturesque, especially inside, colorful with its tiles and hearth fire.  The family is authentic and appealing, along with their friends, the town and its great silver skate race.",5,"Old World, Old Charm and Silver Skates",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1594,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'attracted', 'story', 'reading', 'first', 'child', 'silver', 'skates', 'title', 'seeing', 'movie', 'version', 'years', 'later', 'charming', 'fascinating', 'Old', 'World', 'setting', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'charm', 'particular', 'version', 'was', 'television', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'remembering', 'exactly', 'thinking', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'were', 'good', 'Amsterdam', 'particularly', 'lovely', 'Prefer', 'version', 'Disney', 'version', 'good', 'different.It', 'gentle', 'movie', 'simple', 'honest', 'ring', 'realistic', 'sides', 'life', 'good', 'humor', 'family', 'others', 'exhibiting', 'personal', 'strengths', 'serve', 'well', 'Many', 'can', 'relate', 'big', 'brother-little', 'sister', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'young', 'love', 'abloom', 'recognize', 'lean', 'years', 'being', 'different', 'feel', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'strengths', 'even', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'positive', 'came', 'out.Eleanor', 'Parker', 'favorite', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'strong', 'effective', 'here', 'father', 'children', 'certainly', 'Hans', 'everyone', 'good', 'lovely', 'old', 'fashioned', 'film', 'set', 'Holland', 'old', 'customs', 'ways', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'visit', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'respected', 'tradition', 'part', 'world', 'small', 'house', 'picturesque', 'especially', 'inside', 'colorful', 'tiles', 'hearth', 'fire', 'family', 'authentic', 'appealing', 'friends', 'town', 'great', 'silver', 'skate', 'race']",Hans Brinker

Where this film exceeds is not so much the acting, but the story telling and the plot. Also it takes us back to a place, time and era that is quite exquisite. It's an honest story and the characters themselves are quite colorful to watch. In a rare sense, this is one of the best movies that will leave you feeling great. It is just that well written. More over it is rare in another sense too. Both Adults and Children alike will love this flick. Male, female, almost all genres of people all walks of life will generally love this flick. It is an honest and great little story and should carry on a cult following for decades to come. It also stars the late Richard  Bashart of VTTB fame, and his performance of a father looking for a lost son ties in a neat subplot, all with a very very happy ending.

778722,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B0000DI873,The CinemaScope Cat,"[0, 1]","Set in 1838 Holland, when their father (John Gregson) is seriously injured in a fall from a dike, the Brinker family must struggle and take whatever menial work is available to support themselves. Young Hans (Robin Askwith) and his sister Gretel (Roberta Tovey) dream of entering and winning the Silver Skates competition but they can't afford new skates and must do with homemade wooden skates. Based on the popular children's book HANS BRINKER, OR THE SILVER SKATES by Mary Mapes Dodge, this wholesome family musical is too saccharine to be enjoyable though there is one disturbing sequence when the father attempts to kill the mother (Eleanor Parker, whose singing voice is dubbed by Sandy Stewart). The sappy tunes by Moose Charlap (the Mary Martin PETER PAN) are an uninspired lot and the one good song, the lively Proper Manners is undermined by poor staging. Filmed in Germany and the Netherlands. Directed by Robert Scheerer. With Richard Basehart and Cyril Ritchard.The Kultur DVD is an adequate transfer, nothing more.",2,Saccharine family musical,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,1028,"['Set', '1838', 'Holland', 'when', 'father', 'John', 'Gregson', 'seriously', 'injured', 'fall', 'dike', 'Brinker', 'family', 'must', 'struggle', 'take', 'menial', 'work', 'available', 'support', 'Hans', 'Robin', 'Askwith', 'sister', 'Gretel', 'Roberta', 'Tovey', 'dream', 'entering', 'winning', 'Silver', 'Skates', 'competition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'new', 'skates', 'must', 'do', 'homemade', 'wooden', 'skates', 'Based', 'popular', 'children', 'book', 'HANS', 'BRINKER', 'OR', 'THE', 'SILVER', 'SKATES', 'Mary', 'Mapes', 'Dodge', 'wholesome', 'family', 'musical', 'too', 'saccharine', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'disturbing', 'sequence', 'when', 'father', 'kill', 'mother', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'singing', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'Sandy', 'Stewart', 'sappy', 'tunes', 'Moose', 'Charlap', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'are', 'uninspired', 'lot', 'one', 'good', 'song', 'lively', 'Proper', 'Manners', 'undermined', 'poor', 'staging', 'Filmed', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Scheerer', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard.The', 'Kultur', 'DVD', 'adequate', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'more']",Hans Brinker
778723,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0000DI873,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","This version of the classic tale has become a holiday favorite in our house. While it's a musical, it's not at all slick & over-produced; instead, it has a rough-hewn charm & simplicity to it that's far more engaging than a professional polish so bright that nothing sticks. Yes, the actors aren't ""real"" singers by any means ... but I like them all the more for that, as Hans & Annie sound like actual young people on the verge of first love, their voices straining & creaking just a bit with all the emotions inside them. And the adult actors are very good, from Richard Basehart's gruff but compassionate doctor, to Cyril Ritchard's wonderfully eccentric innkeeper, to Eleanor Parker's beautiful & strong Mrs. Brinker, worn by sorrow but still filled with love & hope for her family. Add to that the pleasure of songs like ""Proper Manners"" and you can't go wrong!English films of the late 1960s/early 1970s had a particular look to them, a certain lighting & tone, that sets them apart. Whether it's the film stock, the lighting, the age of the source material, everything has a sort of burnished glow to it. There's an artificial atmosphere in the best sense of the word, the beauty of an unreal Victorian confection. It's the same with the stage sets, intercut with location footage: it has a fairytale quality, an otherworldliness that even puts me in mind of Cocteau at times. There's a certain simple magic here, completely devoid of cynicism, that never melts down into mere mawkish mush. And that's no small feat!Highly recommended!",4,Just as charming as ever - 4 & 1/2 stars,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1542,"['version', 'classic', 'tale', 'become', 'holiday', 'favorite', 'house', 'musical', 'not', 'slick', 'over-produced', 'instead', 'rough-hewn', 'charm', 'simplicity', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'professional', 'polish', 'so', 'bright', 'nothing', 'sticks', 'Yes', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'singers', 'means', 'like', 'more', 'Hans', 'Annie', 'sound', 'actual', 'young', 'people', 'verge', 'first', 'love', 'voices', 'straining', 'creaking', 'just', 'bit', 'emotions', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'gruff', 'compassionate', 'doctor', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'wonderfully', 'eccentric', 'innkeeper', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'Mrs.', 'Brinker', 'worn', 'sorrow', 'still', 'filled', 'love', 'hope', 'family', 'Add', 'pleasure', 'songs', 'Proper', 'Manners', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'English', 'films', 'late', '1960s/early', '1970s', 'had', 'particular', 'look', 'certain', 'lighting', 'tone', 'apart', 'film', 'stock', 'lighting', 'age', 'source', 'material', 'everything', 'sort', 'burnished', 'glow', 'artificial', 'atmosphere', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'beauty', 'unreal', 'Victorian', 'confection', 'same', 'stage', 'sets', 'intercut', 'location', 'footage', 'fairytale', 'quality', 'otherworldliness', 'even', 'mind', 'Cocteau', 'times', 'certain', 'simple', 'magic', 'here', 'completely', 'devoid', 'cynicism', 'never', 'melts', 'down', 'mere', 'mawkish', 'mush', 'small', 'feat', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Hans Brinker
