880927,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B0007IO6G4,Cinephiliac,"[1, 3]","Based on a novel by ""Maigret"" author Georges Simenon, ""Red Lights"" is both a moody and tense psychological thriller--and the study of a marriage under pressure--set within the claustrophobic confines of a car trip.Antoine (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is a quiet and somewhat nondescript insurance salesman married to Helene (Carole Bouquet), a partner at a high-powered law firm.  Antoine's rather meek and passive demeanor belies the smoldering resentments he harbors towards his more successful wife.  Leaving to pick up their children from summer camp, Helene is both confused and irritated when Antoine insists upon stopping at various bars along the highway for a drink.  The mask of a cordial and accommodating husband soon slips away as Antoine begins to veer from petulant and sulking to openly antagonistic.  Antoine's alcohol consumption also leads to his increasingly erratic driving.  When he refuses to let his wife drive, the couple's squabbling escalates until it reaches a point where Helene threatens to continue the trip without him.  Defiantly stopping at yet another bar, Antoine confiscates the keys and leaves a furious Helene in the car to await his pleasure.  Upon his return, Helene is gone.The mystery behind Helene's disappearance and Antoine's strange alcohol-fueled journey without her lies at the heart of this low key thriller.  ""Red Lights"" is a perplexing and enigmatic character study of a man who has let his frustrations over his less than fulfilling and somewhat unremarkable life disastrously cloud his judgment.  At one point, he picks up a brooding hitchhiker who may well be a fugitive and attempts to forge an insane camaraderie with him.Various television new reports covering the search for the escaped convict and the mounting holiday highway death toll fuels the film's growing sense of dread and uncertainty.  Hypnotic ribbons of highway--and the red neon lights of the bars which seem to almost float in the nighttime sky--gives the film an almost dreamlike quality at times.  However, the glue that really holds this film together is Darrousin's performance.  He manages to make Antoine a very flawed and human protagonist, eliciting our anger at his terrible behavior and our fear for him at his poor choices and their terrifying consequences.  Although inexcusable, Antoine's childish 'acting out' with Helene emanates from his feelings of jealousy and insecurity at being married to a beautiful and more accomplished woman.  Darrousin's subtle body language and his sad, hangdog expression speak volumes.  Antoine is truly one of Thoreau's `men who lead lives of quiet desperation.'""Red Lights"" cannot really be described as a high octane thriller.  Rather, it is one that builds slowly--in stages--and is dependent on mood and tone.  However, your patience will be rewarded with a rich and complicated story full of twists and turns.

DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Antoine Dunan (Jean-Pierre Darroussin), a middling successful insurance salesman who works out of an office cube next to dozens of others, and his wife, Helene (Carole Bouquet), a successful corporate lawyer, are going to drive south from Paris to pick up their two kids from summer camp. Dunan is unhappy with his life, resents his wife's success, feels he is less than a man. As he says later, ""I got sick of playing the good little doggy."" He sneaks a couple of whiskeys before they leave, then sneaks a couple more along the way. It doesn't help when the radio reports a couple of car accidents on the highway and the escape of a criminal from a prison in the area. The atmosphere in the car gets chillier and chillier. He and his wife start to bicker. Dunan stops again, and his wife tells him that if he goes into the bar, she's going to drive on by herself to where the children are. He takes the keys and goes into the bar. When he returns, she is gone. A note says that she's taking the train. When he drives to the train station, however, there is no trace of her. What follows is Dunan's increasingly drunken and self-pitying search for his wife, this time with a passenger, a young silent hitch-hiker he has picked up.I liked this movie a lot. It's a suspense thriller that slowly builds up quite a bit of tension. Only once or twice does explicit violence happen, and it's not too startling when it does. What Kahn accomplishes is to take our expectations that something awful is going to occur and then string us along while the dread builds. There are sequences on the highway at night, sometimes involving long stretches of emptiness, other times involving traffic and police checkpoints, photographed from the driver's position looking forward, that would have made Hitchcock proud. One long sequence has Dunan in a small restaurant trying to locate his wife by making call after call to train stations, police departments, hospitals, the hotel he and his wife were going to stay at. It may sound mundane but the pacing and the acting really bring the viewer (at least this viewer) into the scene. The hitchhiker Dunan picks up creates a long sequence where Dunan, driving and increasingly drunk, and his passenger, silent and surly, create between them a terrific amount of tension.The conclusion of the movie is not what you'd expect, but is satisfying. The movie is based on a story by George Simenon. I think it's well worth watching.

880929,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B0007IO6G4,dooby,"[12, 13]","Originally titled, Feux Rouges, this 2004 mystery/suspense piece from Cedric Kahn will surely please fans of Hitchcock or Chabrol. After reading various reviews, my initial expectation was of a movie like George Sluizer's Spoorloos (aka The Vanishing) but this film has less of the latter's chilly horror. For one thing it ends on a more upbeat note. The movie's strengths lie in it's quiet build-up of suspense and the well sculpted interactions between husband and wife. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon (creator of Inspector Maigret), it tells the story of a constantly inebriated man who misplaces his wife while on a car journey to pick up their children from summer camp. He picks up a hitchhiker who may or may not be an escaped convict. He spends much of the rest of the movie trying to find out what happened to his wife. To tell more would be to spoil the fun.The movie has been given a very good DVD transfer by Wellspring, in what looks like it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Black levels are nicely rendered which is very important because a large portion of the movie takes place along the roads at night. Colors are well presented and natural. Audio includes both dolby stereo and a 5.1 surround mix with good delivery of the music. I love especially the use of Debussy's Nuages to create both a dreamy as well as a slightly sinister effect when needed. Optional English subtitles are included.

An unhappily married couple is on their way to pick up their children at a summer camp.  The husband has an office job in an insurance company. He's balding and mousey.  And he has simmering resentment against his wife, who is a corporate lawyer and is always too busy with her work.  There's a lot of traffic on the road and they bicker constantly. The tension, which is at first merely uncomfortable, becomes worse as the husband keeps stopping in bars for more and more whisky.He leaves her in the car when he goes into a bar and when he returns she has disappeared.  He assumes she walked to the train station to take a train and drives quickly to try to find her. But the train has already pulled out.  He then goes into another bar.

But director Kahn, as adapted by a story by Georges Simenon, has more up his sleeve than a woman-in-distress mystery.Antoine and Helene are pretty much fed up with each other when they set off by car to pick up their children from summer camp. Helene, a successful lawyer, despises Antoine's drinking and Antoine (Jean-Pierre Darroussin), a functionary in a large corporation, suspects Helene (a gorgeous Carole Bouquet) of having an affair. The mood is strained, palpably tense and barely civil when they begin their journey from Paris to the south of France. If only Antoine had listened to the traffic news as he stood at the bar having his first whiskey of the day: ""Be Careful"" intones the TV newsman.The casting of Darroussin with his worn-in, put-upon face and barely controlled anger and the patrician, upper class, calm yet judging Bouquet is perfect. On the surface they seem so wrong for each other and yet the tension created by their odd pairing draws you to them: How did these two ever get together?So much of the success of ""Red Lights"" has to do how well director Kahn succeeds at the creation of a disturbing and almost pathologically desperate mood.

880935,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0007IO6G4,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library for a good movie and stumbled upon this. Didn't know a lot about it but the DVD jacket looked intruiging enough, and on top of that it stars Carole Bouquet, so I picked it up. I am glad I did.""Red Lights"" (2004 release from France; 105 min.) brings the story of Antoine and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Dunan (played by Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet, respectively). They are getting ready to hit the road from Paris to southern France to pick up their children from summer camp. It seems that Antoine has a drinking problem, making several 'pitstops' to get another whiskey, and as he gets more intoxicated and belligerant, the couple's arguments become more heated. When Antoine makes another stop, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne takes off and leaves him a note that she is taking the train. Antoine now panicks and goes feverishly looking for her. Meanwhile, at yet another stop in yet another bar, Antoine makes the acquaintance of a shady looking guy, who perhaps is the criminal whom the TV news just reported escaping from the local prison. At this point we're not even half-way into the movie but to tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie immediately brings to mind some of Hitchcock's films, and that is a good thing. Hitchcock once said ""bringing suspense is not by blowing up a bomb out of nowhere, but by showing the bomb under the table and then letting the audience fret whether the bomb will go off"", and this can be applied by analogy to this movie as well. Indeed the second half of the movie will have you on the edge (or over) as you watch it all unfold. Second, the acting performances are stellar, none more so than by Jean-Pierre Darroussin as the French equivalent of the average ""Joe Six-Pack"".

880939,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0007IO6G4,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","""Red Lights,"" (Feux rouges), (2004) is a full-color, 105 minute French film, a crime drama/mystery/thriller, based on a standalone novel by Georges Simenon.  He was a 20th century author who was Belgian-born, and undoubtedly the most famous French language master of mysteries: he created Inspector Maigret of the Paris Judiciare, subject of many films.  This particular movie was directed by Cedric Kahn,(The 40-Year-Old Virgin). It stars the handsome Carole Bouquet(That Obscure Object of Desire (The Criterion Collection)) as Helene, high-powered corporate lawyer wife of Antoine, played by the everyman-looking Jean-Pierre Darroussin, who's an entirely more ordinary creature entirely, and works at some job in an insurance company, as did Simenon's father.Antoine and Helene are not getting along well; he's irritated by her demanding job.  But they've gotten into the car together to drive to the south of France, there to pick their children up from camp, and then on to Helene's family.  Traffic is heavy, as the entire city of Paris heads south ""en vacances,""and the atmosphere in the car is increasingly tense.  Antoine is drinking heavily, getting drunk and foolish, and stops at one bar too many.  He and Helene fight; he orders her to stay in the car, and takes the keys.  She says she will take a taxi to the train.  When Antoine finally drags himself away from the latest bar, Helene is gone.  They will each face a frightening, dangerous, long night alone.Simenon has been accused by practically every critic of being a misogynist, a charge he always attempted to refute by claiming that he'd slept with 10,000 women: what a defense!  But this film and the novel on which it is based certainly seem misogynistic: if only Helene had not been involved in her high-powered job, but had remained barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, reliant on Antoine's income, this ordeal might never have happened to either of them.  As is, Antoine gets drunk, and Helene pays for it.  However, you'll certainly never get a better view of the French road system, its roadside bars, and the men who drink in them.  Antoine keeps running into strange guys in these taverns: Micky Finn plays an Irish rocker spouting philosophy in one.  Furthermore, the suspense is screwed tighter and tighter; even on a repeat viewing, I was worried about the couple.  Worthy of comparison to Alfred Hitchcock, Anglo-American director of thrillers par excellence (Psycho (Collector's Edition),North By Northwest): worth a look, especially if you're a Simenon fan.",4,"Worthy of Comparison to Hitchcock, Worth a Look to Simenon Fans",1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,2544,"['Red', 'Lights', 'Feux', '2004', 'full-color', '105', 'minute', 'French', 'film', 'crime', 'drama/mystery/thriller', 'based', 'standalone', 'novel', 'Georges', 'Simenon', 'was', '20th', 'century', 'author', 'who', 'was', 'Belgian-born', 'undoubtedly', 'most', 'famous', 'French', 'language', 'master', 'mysteries', 'created', 'Inspector', 'Maigret', 'Paris', 'Judiciare', 'subject', 'many', 'films', 'particular', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Cedric', 'Kahn', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'handsome', 'Carole', 'Bouquet', 'Obscure', 'Object', 'Desire', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Helene', 'high-powered', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'Antoine', 'played', 'everyman-looking', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Darroussin', 'who', 'entirely', 'more', 'ordinary', 'creature', 'entirely', 'job', 'insurance', 'company', 'did', 'Simenon', 'father.Antoine', 'Helene', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'well', 'irritated', 'demanding', 'job', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'car', 'together', 'drive', 'south', 'France', 'pick', 'children', 'camp', 'then', 'Helene', 'family', 'Traffic', 'heavy', 'entire', 'city', 'Paris', 'heads', 'south', 'en', 'vacances', 'atmosphere', 'car', 'increasingly', 'tense', 'Antoine', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'getting', 'drunk', 'foolish', 'stops', 'one', 'bar', 'too', 'many', 'Helene', 'fight', 'orders', 'stay', 'car', 'keys', 'will', 'take', 'taxi', 'train', 'When', 'Antoine', 'finally', 'away', 'latest', 'bar', 'Helene', 'gone', 'will', 'face', 'frightening', 'dangerous', 'long', 'night', 'alone.Simenon', 'been', 'accused', 'practically', 'critic', 'being', 'misogynist', 'charge', 'always', 'attempted', 'refute', 'claiming', ""'d"", 'slept', '10,000', 'women', 'what', 'defense', 'film', 'novel', 'based', 'certainly', 'seem', 'misogynistic', 'only', 'Helene', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'involved', 'high-powered', 'job', 'had', 'remained', 'barefoot', 'pregnant', 'kitchen', 'reliant', 'Antoine', 'income', 'ordeal', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'Antoine', 'drunk', 'Helene', 'However', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'never', 'get', 'better', 'view', 'French', 'road', 'system', 'roadside', 'bars', 'men', 'who', 'drink', 'Antoine', 'running', 'strange', 'guys', 'taverns', 'Micky', 'Finn', 'Irish', 'rocker', 'spouting', 'philosophy', 'one', 'Furthermore', 'suspense', 'screwed', 'tighter', 'tighter', 'even', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'was', 'worried', 'couple', 'Worthy', 'comparison', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Anglo-American', 'director', 'thrillers', 'par', 'excellence', 'Psycho', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'North', 'Northwest', 'worth', 'look', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Simenon', 'fan']",N/A

With its sinister opening overhead shots of ant-like silhouettes wandering over modern architecture, its shots of an equally unreal freeway populated only by gliding vehicles and its use of a Claude Debussy composition that was clearly an inspiration on Bernard Herrmann's scores, it creates an atmosphere of almost disembodied isolation that's the perfect setting for its potentially hackneyed drama of an arguing husband and wife who are separated after taking an unwise detour on the very night a homicidal convict has escaped from a nearby prison. There are contrivances, but they're at least logical ones, and the film doesn't always head off in the directions you expect it to.
