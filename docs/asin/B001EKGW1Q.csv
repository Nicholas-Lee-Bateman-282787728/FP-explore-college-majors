A young man Kim Shunpei smiles as he looks upon the industrialized city that will be his permanent residence. But as time progresses, Shunpei is cold, nasty and vicious towards his family, friends and the community. He raped his wife Lee Yonghee as he was visiting her and her daughter from a previous liasion with a married manager. The marriage between Yonghee and Shunpei is turbulent. He openly has affairs with other women and treats them cruelly. He is abusive towards his children one of whom takes her own life to get away from the cycle of abuse. Shunpei's son Masao narrates his father's violent life which never ceases. As cruel as the movie is, it is also a moving picture of how Koreans lived in a country that wasn't theirs and how they adapted to their residence.Takeshi Kitano plays the character very well illustrating how a man with hopes and dreams slowly becomes morose and violent towards those that reach out to him. Shunpei's character has embedded into other family members like his older son Takeshi. Takeshi, conceived through rape, is bitter towards his father. His life has been harder than that of his younger siblings. He was orphaned after the death of his mother and is involved with the Yakuza. His life is short-lived because of his violent lifestyle.Blood and Bones is not for the faint-hearted. If you can't sit through the violent actions, turn it off and watch something else. If you are able to stomach through this and get more than violence out of it, sit back and watch the movie.",5,Drama and Violence Do Mix,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1575,"['1923', 'boat', 'full', 'Koreans', 'sets', 'sail', 'Osaka', 'A', 'young', 'man', 'Kim', 'Shunpei', 'industrialized', 'city', 'will', 'be', 'permanent', 'residence', 'time', 'Shunpei', 'cold', 'nasty', 'vicious', 'towards', 'family', 'friends', 'community', 'raped', 'wife', 'Lee', 'Yonghee', 'was', 'visiting', 'daughter', 'previous', 'liasion', 'married', 'manager', 'marriage', 'Yonghee', 'Shunpei', 'turbulent', 'openly', 'affairs', 'other', 'women', 'treats', 'cruelly', 'abusive', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'own', 'life', 'get', 'away', 'cycle', 'abuse', 'Shunpei', 'son', 'Masao', 'father', 'violent', 'life', 'never', 'As', 'cruel', 'movie', 'also', 'moving', 'picture', 'how', 'Koreans', 'lived', 'country', 'was', ""n't"", 'theirs', 'how', 'adapted', 'residence.Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'illustrating', 'how', 'man', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'slowly', 'becomes', 'morose', 'violent', 'towards', 'reach', 'Shunpei', 'character', 'embedded', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'older', 'son', 'Takeshi', 'Takeshi', 'conceived', 'rape', 'bitter', 'father', 'life', 'been', 'harder', 'younger', 'siblings', 'was', 'orphaned', 'death', 'mother', 'involved', 'Yakuza', 'life', 'short-lived', 'violent', 'lifestyle.Blood', 'Bones', 'not', 'faint-hearted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'violent', 'actions', 'turn', 'off', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'able', 'stomach', 'get', 'more', 'violence', 'back', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

The story itself and the multiple levels of reading it are so rich one can hardly express it. Most of all, it's a methapore on how selfishness and hatred can poison life...our own, and that of the people we are supposed to love. After one gets over the story, a painful, palpitating shred of life itself, what is left is an inmense piece of filmaking, so solid and subtle that one hardly notices it at first.

However, the main character is a man who is so brutal and violent that he corrupts or destroys pretty much everything he touches, especially his family.  No one seems to possess any redeeming qualities.

1185927,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001EKGW1Q,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[10, 10]","BLOOD AND BONES (2004) is directed by Yoichi Sai; a Japanese-born Korean who is also responsible for such acclaimed hits such as ""Soo"" and ""Quill"". It has been revealed that Sai had waited 6 years for Takeshi Kitano to star in this film of a truly dark character study of a Korean immigrant in Japan and rightfully so. I do believe that no one but an actor of Kitano's caliber would be able to pull this off. This is the first time in almost 10 years that Kitano steps into the screen under the direction of someone other than himself. This film is Yoichi Sai's breakout hit, and Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano gives a remarkable performance as one; if not the MOST unlikable characters in Asian cinema. I kid you not.Synopsis loosely derived from the region-3 Panorama dvd back cover:In 1923, Kim Shunpei (Takeshi Kitano) left Cheju, an isolated island in South Korea for Osaka, Japan dreaming of making a fortune in a new land.Contrary to his hopes, what was waiting for Kim in Japan is a life of discrimination and hard labor. With ruthlessness and cunning wiles, Kim overcomes the obstacles against him to open a Kamaboko (Fish cake) factory, which before long is a success, bringing him the fortune he coveted for so long. Kim Shun-pei gradually becomes a ruthless, merciless loan shark. Blood and Bones paints an unflinching portrait of a man deeply bound to his ego and obsessions and the web of turmoil his wife, mistresses, children, relatives and all those around him are drawn into as a result of his brutal choices and malevolent nature.The film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Yan Sugiru, it is a defining role for Takeshi Kitano. Blood and Bones is not a heartwarming story about a man who rises above all obstacles to achieve his fortune and pride. Shunpei Kim is one individual who has achieved all his riches due to the hardships of others. The first scene actually shows him sexually abusing his wife in front of his daughter, truly this is a character study of a malevolent brutal man who thrives on intimidation and violence. Kim beats his wife and children and even has his mistress move into a new house that he had purchased across the corner; a demonstration of his insufferable characteristics. This is a man incapable of any love or tenderness, his one driving force may be rage and violence.The Fish Cake factory employees are also treated with abuse and disregard. When an employee asked for a raise in pay, his response is brutal abuse. His rise as a prominent figure in the Korean community in Japan is not fueled by accommodation and admiration but rather by violence and intimidation. When his Fish cake fortune grew, he expanded his enterprise to loan sharking. He walks the street with a big stick and mercilessly beats all who owes him money. He is indifferent to all except himself.If you read between the lines and the images of the film you will see that there may be a hidden reason behind Kim's malevolent ruthless nature, it may be because he had suffered abuse and torture in Korea as signified by the scars on his back. (I didn't feel any sympathy or understanding for him though). One may wonder how such behavior can be tolerated. Unfortunately, the spirits of his family and relatives have been pounded to powder by this insufferable character. They feel that they can't move away nor challenge his ire.As the decades past, we see Kim's family grow and his mistresses have children of their own. The film focuses mostly on Kim's character that most supporting roles eventually disappear through the times. The viewer can tell that the passage of time would occur with the birth of grandchildren, the appearance of cars and passing aircraft. Director Sai gives the film a very claustrophobic feel by immersing the viewer in the proceedings in a single street, which after awhile, becomes mostly occupied by Shunpei Kim's family and relatives. Six decades of the film's backdrop is compressed into 2  hours. Unfortunately, I have no knowledge of the history of Korean immigrants in Japan so I cannot fully express the reasons behind the situation.Blood and Bones is an unflinching character study of a single man, but in all fairness and honesty, it only serves as a backdrop for Kitano's fantastic performance. When one thinks about it, the character of Shunpei Kim may well be the sum total of all the ruthless characters Kitano has played in the past. Critics may say that the scenes may get a bit repetitive after awhile, Kim beats, abuses and uses through the decades but that is the WHOLE point. No redeeming qualities, no change happens within Kim, no realization of his mistakes, no conscience, NO regret and remorse. ""Blood and Bones"" is truly unrelenting and maybe even nihilistic at times. Shunpei Kim remains and stands as one, if not the most malevolent figures (if intriguing) characters in cinema; Japanese, Korean or Hollywood. This film can't be described as anything but ""epic violence"". This film is one of those that silenced my voice for awhile, and with the second viewing privy to this review, it did not lose any of its effect. I still feel no sympathy for Kim's character and felt a bit disturbed about the things he has done. Unfortunately, such people do exist in real life. Sad, but true.RECOMMENDED timidly but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of truly challenging cinema [4  stars]",4,4  stars: An Unflinching Character Study of a Malevolent Family Man,1225152000,"10 28,

1185928,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B001EKGW1Q,Zack Davisson,"[3, 3]","Blood will be spilled. Bones will be broken. Shunpei Kim is not a man willing to let something as weak as respect for human flesh get in his way, and if sets about to build an empire of fishcakes, you can be sure that he will, even if he has to beat into submission every living thing around him to get there.Although based on a true story, authored by Shunpei's son Sogiru Yang, ""Blood and Bones"" (A literal translation of Japanese title ""Chi to Hone"") is not an uncommon plot. We have seen it time and again in American gangster flicks showing Italian immigrants fighting their way up from the bottom until they dominate the viscous landscape. If there is an interesting twist here, it is in showing the life of a Korean immigrant to Japan, a place where ethnic hatred has ghettoized the new arrivals, forcing them into dirty districts where little can be achieved. Also, where the American dramas tend to be sweeping epics, this is a tight and personal film, and the story is all about the brutal Shunpei's journey across the years.The bleakness of this film is in direct contrast to director Yoichi Sai's other films, such as the lovable guide dogQuill. There is a harness here that speaks of reality, and although a man of great willpower and determination, it is impossible to find anything good in the domineering Shunpei, a man who rapes his own wife repeatedly, and keeps mistresses like slaves. The film might seem like little more than an exercise in violence if it weren't for the outstanding performance by Takeshi Kitano in the lead role. Being the quintessential Japanese actor, it is a little odd at first to see Takeshi as a Korean immigrant, but by the virtuosity of his Daniel Day-Lewis-worthy performance, one is soon sucked into the story and not released until the final scene.""Blood and Bones"" won a whole slew of Japanese Academy Awards in 2005 when it was initially released.
