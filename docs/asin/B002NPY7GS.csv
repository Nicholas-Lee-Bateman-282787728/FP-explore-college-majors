1280029,A5N1HB1T4EKCM,B002NPY7GS,A. D. Hill,"[7, 8]","I had been waiting for a long time for the release of Season Four, and it was worth the wait! I own the prior three seasons and will buy any others released (please hurry and do that, ok?)What I love:Hitchcock is even more caustic, clever and amusing with his introductory and closing aspersions toward the ""sponsahs."" He really got away with murder on some of those! I love his delivery, too. His expression never changes. Worth your money just to watch himThe story lines are the usual twisting and turning sort where most times you can't guess the end. It's a lot of fun to try and figure it out only to be proven wrong in the end. I did guess a couple, but only because I've watched so many that I'm training myself to think like a sleuth. (I think watching these are good brain exercises!)The acting and characters are top notch whether quirky scoundrels or conniving cold-hearted killers.Of course, the suspense! Hitchcock is the master, and he has a way of drawing you in within the first minute. Suddenly you care about what will happen next and I think this is my favorite part- you can get lost in the ""play"" as he calls it and be highly entertained for a half an hour. Also, I love the styles of the 50's, so it's great from that angle, too!No complaints about this DVD!",5,It's murder that we have to now wait for Season Five on DVD!,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1281,"['had', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'release', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'own', 'prior', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'buy', 'others', 'released', 'please', 'hurry', 'do', 'ok', 'What', 'love', 'Hitchcock', 'even', 'more', 'caustic', 'clever', 'amusing', 'introductory', 'closing', 'aspersions', 'sponsahs', 'really', 'got', 'away', 'murder', 'love', 'delivery', 'too', 'expression', 'never', 'changes', 'money', 'just', 'watch', 'himThe', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'usual', 'twisting', 'turning', 'sort', 'where', 'most', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guess', 'end', 'lot', 'fun', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong', 'end', 'did', 'guess', 'couple', 'only', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'many', ""'m"", 'training', 'think', 'sleuth', 'think', 'watching', 'are', 'good', 'brain', 'exercises', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'top', 'quirky', 'scoundrels', 'conniving', 'cold-hearted', 'killers.Of', 'course', 'suspense', 'Hitchcock', 'master', 'way', 'drawing', 'first', 'minute', 'Suddenly', 'care', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'think', 'favorite', 'part-', 'can', 'get', 'lost', 'play', 'be', 'highly', 'entertained', 'half', 'hour', 'Also', 'love', 'styles', '50', 'great', 'angle', 'too', 'No', 'complaints', 'DVD']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Four

The Master of Suspense actually only directed two episodes this season, but it might interest you to know that one of the big stars of the 1940's, Casablanca's Paul Henreid, really showed his talent behind the camera by directing four episodes this season and a total of 28 for the series run. Another very good  director, Arthur Hiller, directed another five. You'll notice stars this season that are just coming into their own or will in the next few years such as Elizabeth Montgomery, Steve McQueen, and Dick York. You'll also spot stars of the big screen making guest appearances such as Claude Rains, Bette Davis, her husband at the time Gary Merrill, Everett Sloane, Franchot Tone, Mary Astor, and even Fay Wray.  Writers for the season include Roald Dahl and Ray Bradbury.I have childhood memories of being scared out of my wits by the Twilight Zone, since that show's scripts were not bound by natural law. Alfred Hitchcock, however, stays within the natural bounds of what is possible and explores the darkness of man's heart. Since just about every episode involves murder with motive, you'd think that the episodes would get old, but they don't. I heartily recommend this season for fans of Hitchcock and classic TV in general.",5,Probably the best season of this show ...,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,4436,"['let', 'tell', 'competition',

I NEVER had this problem with Seasons 1 through 3 in years past as they were released.  Sadly, some of the discs I ""cherry-picked"" to put together Season Four still had with mild scrapes and scratches.  However, they appear to play without incident (at least on my DVD player).  Since the actual show has been sufficiently reviewed, I will add some comments pertaining to the quality of the DVDs.  First, they are NOT remastered but the quality is good...not great...but more than good enough so that you can enjoy the episodes and not be distracted by those elements that can make watching a vintage TV show or moving a grueling experience (poor or fuzzy image, scratches, ""syndication butchery"" to make room for local commercials, etc.).  My biggest peeve is the condition of the DVDs upon arrival.  To AMAZON.COM's credit, the box sets were well-packed but....upon opening the sets I had most all of the DVDs had scratches, scrapes, smudges, and even ""bubbles"" in the plastic.  WHAT IS GOING ON????  I cannot believe these shoddy copies were allowed to leave the factory!!!  I have a nervous feeling that as the DVD market shrinks (thanks to the economy, the technology of ""downloads"", and the growing sales of ""Made on Demand"" (MOD) DVD-R releases), that the quality control of the production and handling of DVDs at the factory is falling by the wayside.  Call me weird but I expect new DVDs to be pristene but more and more I am seeing ""new"" DVDs arrive with scratches, scrapes, discoloration, and smudges.  This seems to be a common problem with some studios but not all.  The worst offenders seem to be Universal, Paramount, sometimes Fox and some of the ""no-name"" distributors that specialize in obscure, public domain titles.  I suspect the ""golden age"" of DVDs is behind us.  When manufacturers start turning out substandard and shoddy product as the ""new norm"", this is one of the tell-tale signs of market decay.  I remember when this happened with VHS...the quality of the tape got cheaper and thinner and ""drop-out"" became more and more of a problem in the ""waning years"".  Thankfully, we have manufacturers and distibuters who do care....Shout! Factory and Olive Films to name a few....I apologize for the rant but receiving ""new"" (?) DVDs that look like they have been used, recycled, or appear to have been used as coasters at a college fraternity party is inexcusable.... Hence my rating of one star....",1,Is Quality Control Slipping?

Case in point: Season Four box set. Wendell Corey stars in the season opener, ""Poison,"" one of the very few episodes of the series directed by Alfred Hitchcock himself. (He hosted the series, but only directed 16 or 17 of the 300 plus episodes.) Leslie Neilsen stars in ""The $2,000,000 Defense"" which is a fascinating and intriguing court room drama about a guilty man who tells his attorney that if he can get him off on a murder charge he's guilty of committing, he'll pay the attorney $2 million. Wait till you see the twist! ""Man With a Problem"" has a VERY young Elizabeth Montgomery in a small role (keep an eye out for her) and an ending that reminds us that Hitchcock was willing to go overboard. Want to see a young Roger Moore? Hazel Court? How about a young Steve McQueen in a story about an invasion from outer space? They are all here. The picture quality is superb. Extras? There are none. Which is sad but not unexpected since it comes from Universal, who has a track record of not doing any extras (they wouldn't go to the expense) and doesn't release every season.

Universal was disappointed that the laserdisc set sold poorly many years ago, so they have refused to entertain a venture to bring the series out on DVD, a dubious conclusion, methinks, as DVD has reached many times as many homes over the past years.Boris Karloff's Thriller deserves full exposure.",5,"What about Boris Karloff's 'Thriller,' Universal?",1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,959,"['Happy', 'final', 'see', 'Season', '4', 'slow-to-release', 'classic', 'series', 'remain', 'saddened', 'Universal', 'bring', 'out', '67', 'episode', ""'Boris"", 'Karloff', 'Thriller', 'minute-for-minute', 'greater', 'series', 'fact', 'horror', 'definitive', 'moment', 'television', 'classic', 'episodes', 'set', 'bar', 'genre', 'Pigeons', 'Hell', 'Incredible', 'Dr.', 'Markeson', 'Weird', 'Tailor', 'Waxworks', 'Cheaters', 'Devils', 'Ticket', 'Well', 'Doom', 'Premature', 'Burial', 'Masquerade', 'Terror', 'Teakwood', 'Hungey', 'Glass', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Good', 'Imagination', 'Purple', 'Room', 'La', 'Strega', 'ranking', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'aired', 'Universal', 'was', 'disappointed', 'laserdisc', 'set', 'sold', 'poorly', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'refused', 'entertain', 'venture', 'bring', 'series', 'out', 'DVD', 'dubious', 'conclusion', 'methinks', 'DVD', 'reached', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'homes', 'past', 'years.Boris', 'Karloff', 'Thriller', 'full', 'exposure']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Four
1280063,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B002NPY7GS,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[9, 11]","""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" premiered in October, 1955.  Hitchcock himself introduced each show with his trademark dry wit, and directed selected episodes.  The anthology series featured tales of mystery and suspense, horror and the supernatural, usually with a surprise ending.  It ran for ten seasons and was the forerunner of such series as ""Thriller"" and ""The Twilight Zone.""  The 36 episodes from 1958-1959's Season Four, now available in a four-disc set, are one of the series' best collections of stories.""Poison,"" directed by Hitchcock and based on a Roald Dahl short story, finds plantation owner Harry Pope (James Donald) awakening to find that a deadly snake has crawled into bed with him and is now asleep under the covers on his chest.  Suspense mounts as Harry, his partner Timber Woods (Wendell Corey), and a neighboring doctor attempt to figure a way to save him from a lethal bite.""The Waxwork"" is a creepy tale of reporter Ray Hewson (Barry Nelson) who convinces wax museum owner Mr. Marriner (Everett Sloan) to let him spend the night in the museum's murderers' row gallery so he can write a story about its atmosphere.  Later that night, Hewson is stunned to see the unfinished figure of a murderous barber named Bourdette suddenly spring to life.  Bourdette claims he was scheduled for execution the following morning, but escaped and hid in the museum.A personal favorite, ""Banquo's Chair,"" also directed by Hitchcock, stars frequent series cast member John Williams as  Scotland Yard Inspector Brent, who sets up a plan to entrap a man (Kenneth Haigh), acquitted of murdering his aunt years earlier, into confessing to the crime.  Brent hires an actress to appear as the ghost of the dead woman to shake up the nephew at a dinner party, prompting a confession.  This episode is wonderful in its use of reaction shots to illustrate the growing tension and then panic of the nephew as he sees his aunt's ""ghost"" while casual dinner conversation takes place around him.Bette Davis stars in ""Out There, Darkness"" as wealthy Miss Fox, who hires the elevator boy to walk her beloved pet poodle.  When Eddie asks her for a loan, she turns him down and he refuses to walk the dog any longer.  That night, Miss Fox is mugged and her handbag and valuable ring are stolen.  Assuming Eddie is the perpetrator, she informs the police and Eddie is arrested but, after he's spent a year in jail, the actual culprit is caught. Eddie is released and a penitent Miss Fox tries to make amends.Other stars appearing in fourth season episodes include Claude Rains, Franchot Tone, Joyce Meadows, Brian Keith, Steve McQueen, Dick York, Paul Douglas, Cloris Leachman, Richard Kiley, Leslie Nielsen, and Elizabeth Montgomery.  Also included in the set is the featurette ""Fasten Your Seatbelt: The Thrilling Art of Alfred Hitchcock.""",5,"Outstanding Season of Thrillers, Mysteries & Horror",1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,2830,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'premiered', 'October', '1955', 'Hitchcock', 'introduced', 'show', 'trademark', 'dry', 'wit', 'directed', 'selected', 'episodes', 'anthology', 'series', 'featured', 'tales', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'horror', 'supernatural', 'usually', 'surprise', 'ending', 'ran', 'ten', 'seasons', 'was', 'forerunner', 'such', 'series', 'Thriller', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '36', 'episodes', '1958-1959', 'Season', 'Four', 'now', 'available', 'four-disc', 'set', 'are', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'collections', 'stories', 'Poison', 'directed', 'Hitchcock', 'based', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'short', 'story', 'plantation', 'owner', 'Harry', 'Pope', 'James', 'Donald', 'awakening', 'find', 'deadly', 'snake', 'crawled', 'bed', 'now', 'asleep', 'covers', 'chest', 'Suspense', 'mounts', 'Harry', 'partner', 'Timber', 'Woods', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'neighboring', 'doctor', 'attempt', 'figure', 'way', 'save', 'lethal', 'bite', 'Waxwork', 'creepy', 'tale', 'reporter', 'Ray', 'Hewson', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'who', 'wax', 'museum', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'Marriner', 'Everett', 'Sloan', 'let', 'spend', 'night', 'museum', 'murderers', 'row', 'gallery', 'can', 'write', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'Later', 'night', 'Hewson', 'stunned', 'see', 'unfinished', 'figure', 'murderous', 'barber', 'named', 'Bourdette', 'suddenly', 'spring', 'life', 'Bourdette', 'was', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'following', 'morning', 'escaped', 'hid', 'museum.A', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Banquo', 'Chair', 'also', 'directed', 'Hitchcock', 'frequent', 'series', 'cast', 'member', 'John', 'Williams', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Inspector', 'Brent', 'who', 'up', 'plan', 'entrap', 'man', 'Kenneth', 'Haigh', 'acquitted', 'murdering', 'aunt', 'years', 'earlier', 'confessing', 'crime', 'Brent', 'actress', 'appear', 'ghost', 'dead', 'woman', 'shake', 'up', 'nephew', 'dinner', 'party', 'prompting', 'confession', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'use', 'reaction', 'shots', 'illustrate', 'growing', 'tension', 'then', 'panic', 'nephew', 'aunt', 'ghost', 'casual', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'place', 'him.Bette', 'Davis', 'Darkness', 'wealthy', 'Miss', 'Fox', 'who', 'elevator', 'boy', 'walk', 'beloved', 'pet', 'poodle', 'When', 'Eddie', 'loan', 'down', 'walk', 'dog', 'longer', 'night', 'Miss', 'Fox', 'mugged', 'handbag', 'valuable', 'ring', 'are', 'stolen', 'Assuming', 'Eddie', 'perpetrator', 'police', 'Eddie', 'arrested', 'spent', 'year', 'jail', 'actual', 'culprit', 'caught', 'Eddie', 'released', 'penitent', 'Miss', 'Fox', 'make', 'amends.Other', 'stars', 'appearing', 'fourth', 'season', 'episodes', 'include', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Joyce', 'Meadows', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Dick', 'York', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Also', 'included', 'set', 'featurette', 'Fasten', 'Your', 'Seatbelt', 'Thrilling', 'Art', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Four

As always I enjoyed Mr.Hitchcock's deadpan humor at the beginning and end of each episode. You pretty much can't go wrong with this dvd set, but as with most of the AHP's there is usually one episode I find myself watching over and over.On season 4 that episode was ""Mrs. Herman and Mrs. Fenimore."" The characters were a hoot. I especially got a kick out of Mrs. Herman's diction and mannerisms, she could've played the lead witch in the Wizard of Oz easily. Mrs. Fenimore reminded me a little of the character Blanche Devereaux from the ""Golden Girls."" Actress Mary Astor had the uncanny likeness of the actress Rue McClanahan. And of course the conclusion was classic Hitchcock. Defintely a ""must see"" episode.Not to take the subject of murder lightly, but Mr. Hitchcock really knew how to poke fun at murder without being gratuitous. I've never seen any indication of blood on any of the episodes even when a victim is ultimately dispatched. I'm sure that was mostly due to censorship back in the day, but he didn't need to. He always got his point across.I truly wish the studio would release the remaining seasons.
