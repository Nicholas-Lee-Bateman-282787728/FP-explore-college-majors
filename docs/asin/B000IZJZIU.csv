I like the premise of the movie, the actors in it, and the length (about 1.5 hours).  My 15 years old daugher and I sat down with our popcorn, hoping to laugh our way through a light, comedic flick.  We were disappointed.I'm giving Accepted 3 out of 5 stars for 'OK' because it is, but just 'OK'.  The idea that outcasts can find a special place where their uniqueness is celebrated, and where they can learn from each other, is great.  That's the message that I got from the film, and I like it.What I didn't like was the film dragged along, with only a few laughs.  We expected adolescent humor - in fact we were counting on it, but instead we found ourselves either bored or thinking it was just not worth continuing to watch this movie.  We did finish the movie, but it was purely in the hope that we'd find some reason to like it.  That never happened.I know that sometimes I read reviews (particularly bad ones of items I liked...) and think that the reviewer must not like anything.  In hopes of helping other viewers to decide whether this film which was not for me, is for them, I'm going to share what comedic movies of the same ilk I like.  Here's a few: Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura,Easy A, 21 Jump Street, Zohan, Revenge of the Nerds, Freaky Friday (original and newer versions),Back To Schooland Pretty In Pink.A lot of reviewers really liked this movie.

1022637,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B000IZJZIU,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[0, 2]","ACCEPTED At Last! A Desire to Better Themselves., August 31, 2006This is a modern-day remake of the old John Belushi movie about college, only without the pranks. Justin was much better on the eyes than fat John. My Justin would have fit right in with this group with the skateboarding antics and splashing in the pool. Kaleena and Chrissy are as beautiful as the California girls and will be exceptional some day, Kaleen with her ballet training in Cincinnati and Chris with her dynamic bubbling personality. Both have blue eyes and natural blonde hair. Look out!Young people need to feel that they have been accepted. Not all will be by their first choice of college, many will never be accepted due to a technacality. This group of misfits start their own dream school and it ends up being a success and making a difference in the lives of at least 300 students. See the movie ""Accepted"" it will inspire even the most mundane of educators. I was in a college environment for 22 years, I know.In the movie, we watch a college on paper evolve into a real school where the students not only have fun, but learn what they need for the future. B.Gaines had suffered through eight or more rejection letters and his parents insisted that all normal people go to college -- any college. With a core of six or seven, all of whom had be rejected, the set up a dummy college with a false web site to pacify his disappointed parents. They found an abandoned psychiatric hospital on the fringes of a real college, complete with a padded room. They had a ball renovating it themselves and a bunch of internet weirdos, all misfits, were accepted. Seventy four showed up for classes but by the end of the year, there were 300 students all having the time of their lives. Do you know what it's like to be rejected? It hurts. When you are judged by the color of skin, it is an adbomination and evolution is not as important now as the persons who populate the earth, and this fantastic school. It was started as a joke, but evolved into an experiment project like the pilot one.It started out as a play school with their books purchased from Amazon. It was a party school like UT-K, and a nerd educator called the students of this experimental style of college ""freaks at the looney bin."" Their school was shut down as a sham, a fraud, but Dr. Jack Alexander decided it was a clever idea, as the students and the founders had a desire to better themselves. They had been humiliated by being judged on their looks and not their abilities. Dr. Alex admitted that he had always wanted to play jazz trombone.One of the main students turned out to have been a real female ""escort"" not the kind C. Southcott says he will be in Hawaii. I don't think he will even go on that tour. Your sometimes trust the wrong person whose actions strip you of your dignity temporarily. They started a new Pilot program at the fictitious college which evolved into a very popular real school. It's not just about us anymore. No matter how you try to wing it, circumstances always intervene into scams and tortures. They will be found out. Touche. When you reach desperation, you invent possibilities for the future not only for you but for those involved in hoping for the same conclusion. It was an unconsciencable thing to even contemplate, but elation, creation, determination, reinvarnation, identification, retaliation, desperation, amortization all theorectically lead one to make new rules for a new kind of process. A school built on determination to make good for the misfits of this world. Bartably was anything but a misfit; he may have just had average mentality, but he had the spirit of an innovator and achieved the impossible. He was the star witness and wowed the judges.",3,It Was A Joy To Watch These Geniuses.,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,3750,"['ACCEPTED', 'Last', 'Desire', 'Better', 'Themselves.', 'August', '31', '2006This', 'modern-day', 'remake', 'old', 'John', 'Belushi', 'movie', 'college', 'only', 'pranks', 'Justin', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'eyes', 'fat', 'John', 'Justin', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'group', 'skateboarding', 'antics', 'splashing', 'pool', 'Kaleena', 'Chrissy', 'are', 'as', 'beautiful', 'California', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'exceptional', 'day', 'Kaleen', 'ballet', 'training', 'Cincinnati', 'Chris', 'dynamic', 'bubbling', 'personality', 'have', 'blue', 'eyes', 'natural', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Look', 'out', 'Young', 'people', 'need', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'accepted', 'Not', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'college', 'many', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'accepted', 'due', 'technacality', 'group', 'misfits', 'start', 'own', 'dream', 'school', 'up', 'being', 'success', 'making', 'difference', 'lives', 'least', '300', 'students', 'See', 'movie', 'Accepted', 'will', 'inspire', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'educators', 'was', 'college', 'environment', '22', 'years', 'know.In', 'movie', 'watch', 'college', 'paper', 'evolve', 'real', 'school', 'where', 'students', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'fun', 'learn', 'what', 'need', 'future', 'B.Gaines', 'had', 'suffered', 'eight', 'more', 'rejection', 'letters', 'parents', 'insisted', 'normal', 'people', 'go', 'college', 'college', 'core', 'six', 'seven', 'whom', 'had', 'be', 'rejected', 'set', 'up', 'dummy', 'college', 'false', 'web', 'site', 'pacify', 'disappointed', 'parents', 'found', 'abandoned', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'fringes', 'real', 'college', 'complete', 'padded', 'room', 'had', 'ball', 'renovating', 'bunch', 'internet', 'weirdos', 'misfits', 'were', 'accepted', 'Seventy', 'four', 'showed', 'classes', 'end', 'year', 'were', '300', 'students', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'rejected', 'When', 'are', 'judged', 'color', 'skin', 'adbomination', 'evolution', 'not', 'important', 'now', 'persons', 'who', 'populate', 'earth', 'fantastic', 'school', 'was', 'started', 'joke', 'evolved', 'experiment', 'project', 'pilot', 'one.It', 'started', 'out', 'play', 'school', 'books', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'was', 'party', 'school', 'UT-K', 'nerd', 'educator', 'called', 'students', 'experimental', 'style', 'college', 'freaks', 'looney', 'bin', 'school', 'was', 'shut', 'down', 'sham', 'fraud', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Alexander', 'decided', 'was', 'clever', 'idea', 'students', 'founders', 'had', 'desire', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'humiliated', 'being', 'judged', 'looks', 'not', 'abilities', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'admitted', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'play', 'jazz', 'trombone.One', 'main', 'students', 'turned', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'female', 'escort', 'not', 'kind', 'C.', 'Southcott', 'will', 'be', 'Hawaii', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'even', 'go', 'tour', 'sometimes', 'trust', 'wrong', 'person', 'actions', 'strip', 'dignity', 'temporarily', 'started', 'new', 'Pilot', 'program', 'fictitious', 'college', 'evolved', 'very', 'popular', 'real', 'school', 'not', 'just', 'anymore', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'wing', 'circumstances', 'always', 'intervene', 'scams', 'tortures', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'Touche', 'When', 'reach', 'desperation', 'invent', 'possibilities', 'future', 'not', 'only', 'involved', 'hoping', 'same', 'conclusion', 'was', 'unconsciencable', 'thing', 'even', 'contemplate', 'elation', 'creation', 'determination', 'reinvarnation', 'identification', 'retaliation', 'desperation', 'amortization', 'theorectically', 'lead', 'one', 'make', 'new', 'rules', 'new', 'kind', 'process', 'school', 'built', 'determination', 'make', 'good', 'misfits', 'world', 'Bartably', 'was', 'anything', 'misfit', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'average', 'mentality', 'had', 'spirit', 'innovator', 'achieved', 'impossible', 'was', 'star', 'witness', 'wowed', 'judges']",N/A

1022643,AJIU6QI0TYSH7,B000IZJZIU,"Caitlin D. Neely ""BellaOnline Comedy Movies S...","[0, 0]","Accepted (directed by Steve Pink) is a humorous, thoughtful and smart take on college and what it truly means to achieve in life.Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) is a smooth talking, intelligent but lazy high school graduate that finds himself in a bad predicament; he is rejected from every college he applies to. To keep himself from becoming a failure in the eyes of his overly demanding parents (Mark Derwin and Ann Cusack) he creates The South Harmon Institute of Technology, a fake college. To the dismay of his best friend Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill), he accepts himself into the college along with his friends (Maria Thayer, Adam Herschman and Columbus Short).But when more than 100 students show up on the first day Bartleby must go to far greater lengths than he imagined to keep the charade up.The movie's opinion on college and academics is refreshing. The college application process is brutal. Qualified students get turned down. Then there are students who slack in high school but are searching for a second chance. Bartleby's `fake' college shows that there are students who can succeed and discover themselves in college regardless of their past performances. It's good to know that there are colleges out there that accept even those that didn't get straight A's in high school or a perfect ACT score. In the process his college that was essentially fake at the beginning becomes more real and turns into more than merely a scheme to fool his parents.One of my favorite characters in the movie is Glen played by Adam Herschman. His one liners and ability to snag pretty college co-eds is hilarious. He is a suave man that doesn't appear to be one. He proves that looks don't count half as much as personality.Bartleby is another surprise. He is lazy but any audience member will be able to spot the genius bubbling under the surface. He also has witty and clever one liners that bite through the stereotypical Harmon students and the restrictions colleges place on students.The only problem with Accepted that bugs me is the concept. It's unrealistic that they are able to start a college no matter how much money they have in their possession. The accreditation is also far-fetched. But it is a movie and I am willing to suspend reality. Movies are allowed to push the limits. The social commentary on colleges shows that reality was tested for a reason; to illustrate that while the movie's concept doesn't always make sense, neither does real life.",4,Funny and clever take on college,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2469,"['Accepted', 'directed', 'Steve', 'Pink', 'humorous', 'thoughtful', 'smart', 'take', 'college', 'what', 'truly', 'achieve', 'life.Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'Justin', 'Long', 'smooth', 'talking', 'intelligent', 'lazy', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'bad', 'predicament', 'rejected', 'college', 'keep', 'becoming', 'failure', 'eyes', 'overly', 'demanding', 'parents', 'Mark', 'Derwin', 'Ann', 'Cusack', 'South', 'Harmon', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'fake', 'college', 'dismay', 'best', 'friend', 'Sherman', 'Schrader', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'college', 'friends', 'Maria', 'Thayer', 'Adam', 'Herschman', 'Columbus', 'Short', '.But', 'when', 'more', '100', 'students', 'show', 'up', 'first', 'day', 'Bartleby', 'must', 'go', 'far', 'greater', 'lengths', 'imagined', 'keep', 'charade', 'up.The', 'movie', 'opinion', 'college', 'academics', 'refreshing', 'college', 'application', 'process', 'brutal', 'Qualified', 'students', 'get', 'turned', 'down', 'Then', 'are', 'students', 'who', 'slack', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'searching', 'second', 'chance', 'Bartleby', 'fake', 'college', 'shows', 'are', 'students', 'who', 'can', 'succeed', 'discover', 'college', 'regardless', 'past', 'performances', 'good', 'know', 'are', 'colleges', 'there', 'accept', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'straight', 'A', 'high', 'school', 'perfect', 'ACT', 'score', 'process', 'college', 'was', 'essentially', 'fake', 'beginning', 'becomes', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'merely', 'scheme', 'fool', 'parents.One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'movie', 'Glen', 'played', 'Adam', 'Herschman', 'one', 'liners', 'ability', 'snag', 'pretty', 'college', 'co-eds', 'hilarious', 'suave', 'man', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'personality.Bartleby', 'surprise', 'lazy', 'audience', 'member', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'spot', 'genius', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'also', 'witty', 'clever', 'one', 'liners', 'bite', 'stereotypical', 'Harmon', 'students', 'restrictions', 'colleges', 'place', 'students.The', 'only', 'problem', 'Accepted', 'bugs', 'concept', 'unrealistic', 'are', 'able', 'start', 'college', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'have', 'possession', 'accreditation', 'also', 'far-fetched', 'movie', 'am', 'willing', 'suspend', 'reality', 'Movies', 'are', 'allowed', 'push', 'limits', 'social', 'commentary', 'colleges', 'shows', 'reality', 'was', 'tested', 'reason', 'illustrate', 'movie', 'concept', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'real', 'life']",N/A

Crockett ""Domino713""","[1, 2]","This teen film about a group of outcasts who create their own college after having difficulty finding acceptance at any of the Universities they applied to is at best...acceptable. The characters are stereotypical, but likable, and the plot is somewhat entertaining, but predictable. Very predictable.The film does have a valid core message about the realities of rejection and acceptance in the lives of todays youth, but even with a strong core message a movie will still fall flat if the writing is too boringly predictable. Many scenes in this film appeared to be rip-offs of *other* (and frankly, better) scenes in past films geared towards the teens-20's age demographic.

1022650,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000IZJZIU,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[0, 1]","Directed by Steve Pink, whose previous credits includes writing the screenplay and co-producing the films Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) and High Fidelity (2000), Accepted (2006) stars Justin Long (Galaxy Quest, Jeepers Creepers, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story) as Bartleby `B' Gaines, a recently graduated high school student who, after being rejected from every college he applied to, decides to create a fictional school rather than face the humiliation of his peers and disappointment of his parents.  Also appearing is Jonah Hill (Grandma's Boy, Click), Adam Herschman, Blake Lively (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants), Columbus Short (Save the Last Dance 2), Maria Thayer (""Strangers with Candy""), Anthony Heald (The Silence of the Lambs), Travis Van Winkle (Transformers), and comedian/social commentator Lewis Black (Jacob's Ladder).As the film begins we meet a klutzy Ferris Bueller type named Bartleby `B' Gaines, who, upon learning he's gotten his application rejected from like his seventh or eighth college, decides, with the help of his friend Sherman (Hill), to make up a fictional school called South Harmon Institute of Technology, which is supposedly a sister school to a local (and real) institute of higher education.  Why?  Well, mainly to appease his parents, particularly his father, who's kind of an a-hole.  Pretty soon the lie begins to snowball and Bartleby is forced to come up with an actual facility, to which he takes the money his parents gave him for tuition and leases a decrepit building that once was used as a psychiatric hospital.  With the help of his friends they fix it up enough to pass it off as a school, along with bringing in Sherman's slightly crazy Uncle Ben (Lewis) to act as the dean.  Bartleby manages to scam his parents well enough, but guess what?  Sherman, who created the web page for the fictional school, made the site a little too realistic, and pretty soon a slew of dregs, dweebs, mutants, malcontents, and spaz types, none of whom could get into other schools, begin showing up, tuition in hand, believing they've gotten accepted to South Harmon.  Rather than crush their dreams, Bartleby decides make the school semi-legit by letting the students make up their own classes based on what they want to learn.  Things seem to go well for a while, that is until Dean Van Horne (Heald), who presides over the real Harmon, decides he wants the land adjacent to his university for expansion purposes (South Harmon just happens to be on that land).  Eventually Bartleby's sham is exposed, but his school has become something more than intended (an actual learning institution) and Bartleby and his friends opt for a long shot in trying to get the school accredited and avoid going to jail under fraud charges.All in all I thought this film, albeit formulaic, was funny and fairly entertaining.  The plot is pretty unrealistic but then it is a screwy comedy so it helps if you suspend a good deal of disbelief.  As I said the plot's formulaic as you have the standard setup of the main character creating a wacky situation, one that eventually gets out of hand, ultimately crashing down around his ears, resulting in a last ditch effort to save the day.  There's also a love interest element as Bartleby's has it bad for a character played by Blake Lively, who, in turn, is dating slimy, snobby president of the fraternity, both of whom go to the real Harmon.  Eventually she comes to see her boyfriend for what he is and takes up with Bartleby thinking he's all cool and the real deal, which results in disappointment as she discovers most everything he's presented himself as, in terms of the school, is fake.  Will Bartleby be able to save the day and get the girl?  Probably...I thought all the performers did pretty well, including Long himself who seems a charming and personable fellow, but the character I enjoyed most was that of Sherman, played by Jonah Hill.  He was sort of the token, chubby, awkward nerdlinger, but he was also really funny, especially when he was trying to fit in with the fraternity types.  You see, Sherman got accepted to the real Harmon, and was pledging the main fraternity as a legacy, but the so called `cool' types seemed only interested in humiliating him as much as possible.  There's plenty of crazy characters running around that manage to keep things interesting, probably the wackiest a character named Glen (Herschman), a misfit who got fired from the local kwik-e-mart for making a shrimp slushy (he was both hungry and thirsty).  Lewis Black pulls his shtick out for the film, as he can be seen ranting on in his usual fashion and provides a few comical moments as an unorthodox dean.  As this was Pink's directorial debut I thought he did extremely well as he really kept things lively and moving along at a good pace.  Another aspect that helped a lot was an rousing soundtrack which included some good tunes from bands like The Pixies, Green Day, Citizen Cope, Modest Mouse, Weezer, The Hives, and The Cure, to name a few.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) on this DVD looks sharp, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, available in English, French, and Spanish, comes across well.  Extras include an audio commentary track with director Pink and performers Justin Long, Lewis Black, Jonah Hill, and Adam Herschman.  Also included is a comical bit entitled Adam's Accepted Chronicles, a making of featurette titled `Reject Rejection: The Making of Accepted', a self-guided campus tour, a couple of music videos, some deleted scenes, and music MP3 files from the film, accessible through your computer.Cookieman108By the way, take the first letter from each word in the name of the school...South Harmon Institute of Technology...what does that spell?

1022651,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000IZJZIU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Let's say you've been something of an underachiever in high school, living a Ferris Bueller-like life and not exactly hitting the books very hard.  You're a pretty cool guy, but now it's time to face reality.  The closest you've gotten to the class hottie is her front lawn (which she flirted you into mowing for her) and - horror of horrors - every single college you applied to has turned you down flat (which is going to come as quite a blow to your parents).  What do you do?  Well, naturally, there's only one thing to do - have your nerdy best friend (Jonah Hill) create a fancy web site for a nonexistent college, fake an acceptance letter from said college, and use dad's tuition money to lease an abandoned mental hospital that you can clean up and pass off as an actual educational institution.  It helps if you have a few friends joining you in this whole crazy scheme - friends like Hands (Columbus Short), who lost his athletic scholarship because of an injury, Glen (Adam Herschman), who probably can't even spell college, and Rory (Maria Thayer), a totally cute redhead who only applied to one school (Yale) and had her cherished dreams dashed at the manicured hands of smarmy Ivy League administrators who probably all talk like Thurston Howell, III.  Certainly, it takes some work to turn a filthy, abandoned loony bin into a ""college"" impressive enough to fool your parents when they drop you off, but it's going to be all fun and games after they leave, right?  It might be - if about 300 other folks didn't show up with acceptance letters and tuition money in hand (seems that good old Sherman made the college web site a little too functional).Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long), the brainchild of this whole fake college dream, doesn't have the heart to turn all these students away from the hallowed halls of South Harmon Institute of Technology - these are all people who want to learn but have no chance of ever getting into a real school.  Bartleby is totally BMOC, and his ideas to let the students choose what they want to do goes over really big.  Who wouldn't want to learn how to rock your face off in the afternoon and then settle in for a leisurely night of Babe Watching 101?  Okay, so they don't have any tests, or books, or even a faculty - apart from their dean (played to hilarious effect by Lewis Black), who just left a promising career as a bitter shoe salesman - but these crazy misfit kids actually start to learn a few things.  Even the students over at the prestigious Harmon College start mingling around the place, including Monica (Blake Lively), the aforementioned hottie who starts thinking Bartleby is a better guy than her conceited future lawyer of a boyfriend.Yep, things are looking pretty good for old Bartleby and friends.  Then, of course, the world crashes in on them when reality, in the form of Dean Van Horne (Anthony Heald) from Harmon, calls Bartleby's incredibly huge bluff.  Will this be the end of the South Harmon Institute of Technology forever?  Will this bold experiment at untraditional higher education simply disappear, breaking the hearts and thwarting the minds of all the unacceptable students S.H.I.T. accepted?  Will Monica, in disgust at such rank duplicity, abandon Bartleby before he even gets a chance to get to second base with her?Obviously, Accepted has one of the most farcical plots you're likely to come across, but it's a pretty darn good comedy that plays better than you would expect, especially when it gets that whole underdog thing going.  You can't help but like Bartleby and company, the outrageous diversity of the student body serves up many a memorable character (such as the A.D.D. kid, the big, menacing guy most likely to go crazy in boot camp like that soldier in Full Metal Jacket, and a young lady who just gave up stripping to go back to school).  You even have Deal or No Deal's Lisa, who trades in her revealing dresses for an even more revealing bikini.  You might even say the movie makes an actual point or two about the system of higher education, which has certainly been known to turn away kids who may struggle but really want to learn in favor of some students who get in to good schools because of connections or money alone and then sleepwalk their way through four years of highly structured classes.  Don't hold me to that ""this movie actually has something to say"" thing, though.

All the bells and whistles we find in previous meatball comedies are rehashed here (sophomoric humor, slapstick, pranks, pratfalls, and a stick-it-to-the-man finale).  This is a movie that has its funny moments, its ho-hum moments, its over-the-top moments--pretty much standard fare for today's run-of-the-mill comedies.  (Case in point.  The name of the fictitious school is ""South Harmon Institute of Technology.""  Guffaw.)Justin Long does fine as the smooth talking ""founder"" of his make-believe college; Jonah Hill is just as adequate as his much-maligned sidekick.  Lewis Black gets the juiciest lines as the students' mentor and disgruntled ex-professor, while Anthony Heald upholds the high brow stereotype of the snooty college dean.

Tired of not having an answer for the ""Where are you going?"" question and dismayed at disappointing his parents Bartely B. comes up with an idea. In the beginning it's just an acceptance letter. He creates a letter stating that he was accepted to South Harmon Institute of Technology. He even has his friend create a website. Then he starts to think his idea might really work. When his father hands him a check to pay his tuition in full he decides to create a real college. He leases an old dilapidated school building that was once a mental facility and creates a college--dorm rooms and all. The plan just keeps going and going. Students enroll and they even find a dean.

Moreover, new-comer Adam Herschman is wildly hysterical (expect great things from him in the future).Even still, the casts' passionate devotion could not remedy the sub-par script which was riddled with cheesy lines and ridiculous cliches (Do not expect anything great from this writing team in the future). Case in point:  the final sequence is not as much an homage to ""Mr. Deeds"" but a painful rip-off: ""What was your dream?"" ""I wanted to play the jazz trombone"" Ugg. And while many find the script ""unbelievable,"" that really was not a problem for me (""suspension of disbelief"" is always critical to the viewing process).Though the plot is outrageously predictable, it does have some redeeming qualities: most importantly, there is a valuable lesson about Greek Life. While many young people erronously believe that Greek Life is similar to that of John Landis' ""Animal House,"" ""Accepted"" presents a more accurate portrait. With the number of Greek pledges plummitting every year, it is a relief to see a film which details (no, not their ""dark-side"") their TEDIOUS side. Kudos for that.The cinematography in ""Accepted"" was fine . . . Pink did the best he could with the script he was presented.Bottom-line: young people who have little film experience will not recognize ""Accepted"" as a re-hash of all the ""college films"" of the 70's and 80's.

1022658,A1K31NF81TS0CO,B000IZJZIU,"Dubyac99 ""Dubyac99""","[1, 3]","First of all, I'd like to congratulate the director and writer on a very unique and un-contrived approach in the screenplay and direction.  Others are saying this is a typical College Movie?  Are you kidding.  This is one of the most unique approaches to college comedy I've ever seen.Now, far-fetched comes to mind when watching this movie.  There were just too many times that I thought, while watching, why did they do it that way?  Like, when the door opened at the new college, and one person was standing outside the door, the dyslexic ADD student.  Then all of a sudden there are 9,000 people behind him?Parent's day:  How come all the parents showed up at once?  Why not have the ""bell"" keep ringing, and they are getting flustered at so many parents showing up, and where are they gonna stay?  Etc.The abandoned building at the beginning of the movie would take minimum 3 months to clean and fix up.  Did I miss some time elapse?  Did we see a calendar with the pages flying off, or a clock rotating in a clockwise fashion, in some dream-like trance fashion?  Why couldn't they have had the school in close to okay condition, than they were seen fixing it up?Not funny:  The scenes, for the most part, were not timely humor.  The punchlines were a bit off.  In the extra features, they have some guy, who plays a fairly small role, walking around and giving direction, in some fashion.  It wasn't funny at all.  I didn't laugh once.  It reminded me of other DVD's I've viewed, like ""Boogie Nights,"" and ""The Girl Next Door,"" where they have a small bit part, of a fresh new actor, ""directing"" scenes, like a joke.But it didn't work here, because the actor they used, wasn't funny, and wasn't even a major part of the movie.  Why not use the overweight kid, who was pledging at the competing school?  That would have been funnier and more appropriate.The Commentary track was a joke.  Everyone was talking over themselves.  To try to be funny.  And they were never funny.  At all.  The young actor, who played the protagonist, the ""Apple"" computer commercial dude, kept trying to remember names, of small, unimportant actors, throughout, so he could compliment them.  And he never could.  Not that I expected him to, but it just became ludicrous after a while, listening to him ""hem and haw"" over very unimportant actors names, as if he was working with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.I didn't recognize one actor.  Not one.  Okay, the main protagonist, who by the way was exceptional.  He is a great actor.  But he played a pretty straight character, so comedy was not necessary.  I did recognize him as the ""apple"" rep from the Apple Computer commercials.  You know, the one, where they are comparing ease of use between the Apple and the PC.  But everyone else may have been in their first movie, this one?  I'll look up the IMBD, after this, but I seriously doubt any of these folks have been in anything major, before this.Having said that, I'm no snob.  I don't have to recognize 14 actors, for a move to be good to me.  For Gosh sake, Borat had maybe one person I recognized, in the whole movie.  But come one.  These ""screwball"" comedies, need at least one or two recognizable actors to appeal to the masses.  But not one person here, did I know.  Makes me wonder why it was so hard to get even a small part covered by a ""Eugene Levy"" or a ""William Macy,"" for gosh sake.  I really wish that ""uncle"" had been a different actor.  He was so ""un-funny"" to me.  Why do so many B Actors think the ""F"" word makes them funny?I wouldn't recommend this one.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[0, 0]","This movie had the honor last summer of being relentlessly advertised - for awhile, you couldn't watch primetime without being assaulted by the clip of a fat guy wearing a hotdog costume bellowing, ""Ask me about my wiener!""  The movie was also memorable in how closely it resembled a chipper little movie called ""Camp Nowhere,"" which came out some years earlier.Like ""Camp Nowhere,"" it involves a bunch of misfits (looking old enough to be in grad school but actually supposedly first year college students) who invent their own institution (college, not camp), in order to have the time of their lives.  Under the guidance of Bartleby ""Symbolism Alert"" Gaines, played by Justin Long, the misfits design a Web site advertising a fictional college, then proceed to turn an abandoned mental hospital into a college where students can design their own curriculum.  Schools like this actually exist, by the way, so this part isn't as unbelievable as some reviewers seem to think. ""Accepted,"" makes some valid points about how higher education has become assembly-line and that frats are evil, but somehow I couldn't stop marveling at the resemblance to ""Camp Nowhere.""  This wasn't just me either, but if you haven't seen that movie, you'll find ""Accepted"" a lot more original.The fat guy character is Bartleby's best friend Schrader, played by Jonah Hill, who sets up the Web site and assists with the hijinks even though he is going to a legitimate college nearby.  Eventually, he becomes disenchanted with his school because of the evil frat boys' hazing.  This would have had more impact if it had shown other pledges getting hazed, too, which I assume still happens in reality.  It did, as other reviewers pointed out, seem excessively mean spirited, and took away from the comedy happening at the South Harmon Institute of Technology, Bartleby's college.The Evil Dean of the legit school is naturally opposed to the upstart school setting in motion some semblance of a plot.  Lewis Black is also very good, playing the ""dean"" of S.H.I.T. and treating the students/audiences to rants on the state of the ""real world.""

Some people are saying it's a rip-off of ""Camp Nowhere"", ""Animal House"", blah, blah but movies like these have been made for a while. Justin Long plays a high school student being forced to get into college by his parents. However, all the major colleges  he's applied to have rejected him.  Instead of telling his unsympathetic parents,  Bartleby Gaines (Long) decides to make up his own college literally and this is where the fun stars. Aided by his two friends  Sherman, and Hands, Barteby takes an old abandoned mental institution and makes it into his own college.They pull off all the stops to making the college look real including a web site and their own Dean played by the hilarious Lewis Black. Lewis Black definitely adds a little extra to this film. There are plenty of laughs, most of it aimed at a young audience. The side story with Sherman trying to join that white preppie fraternity was reminiscent of Revenge of the Nerds.  The performances aren't that bad either. Black is great, Long is decent, and Anthony Heald  who plays the stuck up , stingy Dean Van Horne is also terrific. The movie is a comedy so everybody has fun with it and it shows. I went to go see it and at a screening back in March and the audience I saw it loved every minute of it.  In the end ""Accepted"" is a decent little comedy film.

1022671,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000IZJZIU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS included.ACCEPTED is the unrealistic but fairly entertaining story of a high school kid who, rejected by a number of colleges, ends up creating and then running a fake university. This flick follows in the footsteps of past misfit college cinema such as OLD SCHOOL and ANIMAL HOUSE. Yes, it's pretty predictable all around as it hits all the expected daffy plot pit stops, but the movie performs in such a pleasant manner that you can't help but roll with its good-natured flow. This is due in part to Justin Long's laid back and low key performance, which grounds the film enough that all the prerequisite wackiness is more easily swallowed. Justin Long's always had this indefinable off-kilter delivery, and it serves him well in his leading role. There's something that's subtly different about this guy that makes you buy into the notion that he could actually pull off his crazy shenanigans.The plot: When his college rejection letters reach the number of 8, high school scammer Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long, ED, DODGEBALL, HERBIE: FULLY LOADED) decides to craft his own acceptance letter into a fake college he'd invented, the  South Harmon Institute of Technology, which Bartleby dubs a sister school of the neighboring, prestigious Harmon College. When his father requests more literature, Bartleby has his best friend Sherman create a college website. But his dad isn't satisfied and demands a face-to-face meeting with the dean. Bartleby gets Sherman's degenerate and bluntly insensitive Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) to enact the part.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Bartleby, the website is so effective and functional that it soon attracts a mob of misfits, losers, and rejects who were unable to get in any other colleges. Now, with potential scholars having already mailed in their tuition, Bartleby and friends decide to wing it and conduct their own version of college, coming up with their unique and unconventional university curriculum, of which courses include Slacking 101, Bumper Stickers, Girl Watching, Taking a Walk and Thinking About Stuff, Skateboarding 234, and Rock Our Faces Off. Or, as Bartleby tells his hundreds of student hopefuls, ""Welcome to S.H.I.T"" (their mascot, of course, is a sandwich).The movie's main conflict is introduced when the Dean (Anthony Heald) of the highly-esteemed Harmon College schemes to extend his university to include a fancy gateway, which he believes will somehow allow Harmon College to compete with the likes of Yale and Stanford. Thus, he orders his rich student lackey Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle) - who's dating the girl of Bartleby's dreams and whose fraternity Sherman is trying to get into - to obtain the property rights to the land the gateway will be built on. Problem: those acres are now being occupied by Bartleby's South Harmon Institute. But, of course, it doesn't take long for Hoyt and the ambitious dean to learn of South Harmon's unlawful state...and to act on that knowledge.Not counting Justin Long's relaxed and sympathetic performance, two other actors acquit themselves pretty darn decently. Lewis Black channels his stand-up manic rants into his role of the subversive Uncle Ben, who doesn't hesitate to state his opinion, often colored with unsaintly language. Jonah Hill as Bartleby's overweight best bud Sherman Schrader has some very funny moments (the screaming-like-a-chick scene and ""Ask me about my weiner,"" just to mention two). There are a few other characters who might've been more  memorable had they been given more screen time (the cute Rory, Bartleby's little sis, etc.), but, alas...Monica, sadly, as played by Blake Lively, is a bit too bland for me, needing more of a personality, but, nevertheless, she is muy caliente.Basically, ACCEPTED strives hard to go the inspired lunacy route but really ends up with nothing that original to say, just more of that same ol' tried and true message of how being unorthodox is okay and that, in the end, it's all about accepting yourself for who you are, no matter that you don't quite fit in with what's considered as the accepted norm. And I can dig that. In  final analysis, ACCEPTED is well meaning enough and pleasantly done by the numbers, with easy, common denominater laughs, an ingratiating performance by the lead dude (who, I must admit,  I didn't like in the tv show ED), and an unbelievable resolution. No, it's not as sublimely nuts as OLD SCHOOL or ANIMAL HOUSE. But its selling points are good enough for me to rate it as a three starrer.

With high parental expectations, Bartleby enlists the help of his friend Sherman (Jonah Hill) to create a website for a fake college he could tell his parents he was accepted by. But things get out of hand when the website turns out to be too professional and hundreds of other college rejects get accepted to the fake school.Accepted is pretty much nothing more than mindless fluff, but its funny mindless fluff. Justin Long, as always fits the role of the charming smartass perfectly. As the mastermind behind the scheme to start a fake college, you believe he could get away with this kind of plan.  Jonah plays against the type that made him famous in Superbad and Knocked Up by playing the moral center to Long's craftiness. Most of the rest of the cast are one note characters with Adam Herschmann stealing every scene as dimwitted Glen, and Lewis Black in a hilarious turn as a former educator who is now the dean of Bartleby's fake school.While the side characters are funny in their one note incarnations, some of the main characters aren't very well fleshed out either. Rory, played by Maria Thayer, is nothing more than an overachiever, while Columbus Short's Daryl is the sensitive jock. Bartleby's parents are also supposed to be smart enough to catch on to his charade, but it's his little sister who finds him out and blackmails him. Luckily for the film it still feels organic. Also the film suffers in the third act when it veers into Bartleby Goes to the School Board. It feels like the film is trying to tell a message, but the message gets lost in the fact that the film plays as mindless entertainment. Long's perfunctory speech during this act of the film doesn't really gel with the vibe of the rest of the film.Despite its faults though, Accepted is a fun film to watch. If you haven't checked it out already I highly recommend you give it a try. It's fairly broad humor, which unfortunately means it's PG-13 instead of the R it should have been written for (there's even an F-bomb from Lewis Black that's literally bleeped out at the end of the movie to avoid an R rating), but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments here to keep you in your seat.3.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",4,Accepted,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,3013,"['Currently', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'playmakers', 'stars', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'relegated', 'bit', 'parts', 'brilliant', 'films', 'such', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'respectively', 'early', 'days', 'careers', 'led', 'major', 'roles', 'major', 'films', 'such', 'Just', 'Not', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Superbad', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'could', 'get', 'opportunity', 'star', 'major', 'films', 'though', 'had', 'be', 'thrown', 'starring', 'roles', 'much', 'smaller', 'production', 'production', 'was', 'Accepted.Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'Justin', 'Long', 'smart', 'ass', 'who', 'skated', 'way', 'college', 'dry', 'wit', 'little', 'work', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'college', 'rejected', 'one', 'high', 'parental', 'expectations', 'Bartleby', 'help', 'friend', 'Sherman', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'create', 'website', 'fake', 'college', 'could', 'tell', 'parents', 'was', 'accepted', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'when', 'website', 'out', 'be', 'too', 'professional', 'hundreds', 'other', 'college', 'rejects', 'get', 'accepted', 'fake', 'school.Accepted', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'more', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'funny', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'Justin', 'Long', 'always', 'role', 'charming', 'smartass', 'perfectly', 'mastermind', 'scheme', 'start', 'fake', 'college', 'believe', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'kind', 'plan', 'Jonah', 'type', 'made', 'famous', 'Superbad', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'playing', 'moral', 'center', 'Long', 'craftiness', 'Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'one', 'note', 'characters', 'Adam', 'Herschmann', 'stealing', 'scene', 'dimwitted', 'Glen', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'former', 'educator', 'who', 'now', 'dean', 'Bartleby', 'fake', 'school.While', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'one', 'note', 'incarnations', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'either', 'Rory', 'played', 'Maria', 'Thayer', 'nothing', 'more', 'overachiever', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'Daryl', 'sensitive', 'jock', 'Bartleby', 'parents', 'are', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'catch', 'charade', 'little', 'sister', 'who', 'out', 'Luckily', 'film', 'still', 'organic', 'Also', 'film', 'suffers', 'third', 'act', 'when', 'Bartleby', 'Goes', 'School', 'Board', 'film', 'trying', 'tell', 'message', 'message', 'lost', 'fact', 'film', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'Long', 'perfunctory', 'speech', 'act', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'gel', 'vibe', 'rest', 'film.Despite', 'faults', 'Accepted', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'already', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'try', 'fairly', 'broad', 'humor', 'unfortunately', 'PG-13', 'instead', 'R', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'even', 'F-bomb', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'literally', 'bleeped', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'avoid', 'R', 'rating', 'are', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'here', 'keep', 'seat.3.5/5Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",N/A

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","As far as movies go, we always like to see the little guy win, the underdog to achieve greatness and the weak to rise above the strong.  In this tradition, Accepted tries not only to make the underdog achieve, but to make the antics of people who want to slack off seem appealing.Justin Long, who you've seen in Dodgeball and the PC vs. Mac commercials, stars as Bartleby, a too-smart-for-his-own-good high school student on the verge of graduation.  As his hopes of college life slips through his fingers when he gets the final notification of rejection, he desperately creates a fake college complete with acceptance letter and website to appease his disappointed parents.  One thing leads to another and he finds himself actually leasing a building and creating a mock up college for him and the few friends who have also used the faux acceptance letters.  Soon he is neck deep in the theatrics of being a legitimate school when hundreds of students show up who have supposedly been accepted, none of which ever received notification of such (wouldn't they have to receive a letter telling them this?), they just applied to the website online.  Also, wouldn't all of these people be able to attend community college?Despite it's short comings of realism, Accepted's theme is a good one.  The school gives a place to go for those who want higher education but are unable to get in for one reason or another.  And though it's message of everyone wanting doing what they want, specifically in the fields of art, music, culinary, social opinions and yoga are viable school subjects, the art of slacking, social hostility and skateboarding are not really socially supportive and could easily be learned out in real life.The move really highlights two extremes in thought; the white-bread, WASP community of higher colleges vs. the artistic type community who want to do more free will learning.  I do agree with the premise on some levels; Yes, the curriculum of many higher colleges is woefully complicated.  Yes, the politics involved in who does and does not get accepted are outrageously discriminatory.  Yes, many college fraternity traditions are disgustingly outdated and humiliating.  However, it's obvious that the message is grossly understated and irresponsibly delivered.I do want to give kudos to Justin Long, he has charisma and makes an impressively understated lead character.  Lewis Black brilliantly plays the eternally angry former professor who does nothing but rant against the trappings of modern day society.  Blake Lively, who is beautiful and talented and showed so much promise in `Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' steps down a bit to portray the sweet girl love interest, Monica.In the end, the movie redeems itself by sending a `don't be so quick to judge' message and in turn proves itself to be a fun movie, but not hilariously funny.  It's entertaining and the straightforward message of being accepted in life no matter who you are works better if you view it from that perspective and not from the scholastic vantage point.",3,Acceptable?

You can barely make out what's happening on the students' mass curriculum chart, and many of the most amusing bits of the movie are to be found in the crowd scenes; oddly enough,  the movie is designed as almost a three ring circus, and the previous reviewer hit it right on the head when she said that it is a movie so rich that you see something different in it every time you watch it.  Mostly sight gags, but overlapping dialogue will by and by jump out at you, words and sentences you never heard before in the post-Altman sound mix.Justin makes the whole movie watching, though maybe in his climactic scene in court he lets himself down a bit, giving his big speech as though channelling Jimmy Stewart in some old Frank Capra picture.  We don't love him because he's the new Jimmy Stewart--let Tom Hanks live off that reputation.  No, we love him because he's a distinct individual and it hurts to see him have to worm himself into a part that fits him too loosely, like the diaphanous wings of a butterfly wrapped round a live wire.

This kind of movie certainly isn't going to win awards, it's not for personal glorification a.k.a. The Ego Project. It's supposed to be a money maker.

After his eighth rejection, he and several of his likewise-rejected high school chums conspire to create a fake college -- the South Harmon Institute of Technology (the acronym of which is flaunted religiously throughout the movie).  Their ruse is so successful that they are soon swamped with students, all of whom were accepted (and duped) by the fake school's website (which announces that ""acceptance is just one click away""...literally).  Instead of throwing in the towel, though, Gaines sees an opportunity to reward the off-beat and bizarre, to nurture the creative spirit and passion that other colleges (so says he) have so thoroughly squelched.If you can get past the ludricous implausibility of the plot, this movie is actually a lot of fun.  Justin Long (of ""Dodgeball"") proves himself capable of helming a comedic leading man role; he seems to be channeling equal measures of Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, and the combo works.  He is surrounded by a number of stock characters -- the red-headed hippie chick, the disillusioned jock, the chubby nerd, the jaded teacher, and the clueless misfit -- but every one of these roles is assumed with panache and verve.  There are some standouts, including Jonah Hill as Gaines' dorky friend, Sherman, and newcomer Adam Herschman as the braindead culinary genius, Glen.  Lewis Black (love him or leave him) gets his standard role, too, and here it fits nicely with the movie's milieu.The whole thing follows a standard formula (foes are established, minor setbacks are overcome, and -- just when it seems like all is lost -- an inspirational speech at the climax saves the day), but there's a formula for a reason.  What the movie lacks in inspiration and innovation, it makes up for in wild abandon and goofy, good-natured aplomb.  The score is great, the cast is having a great time, and the script is silly enough to work well.There are a few clunky inconsistencies, though (Gaines' nemesis, the Nordic Hoyt Ambrose, isn't really a proper ""villian;"" Gaines' and the movie, it seems, convict him for simply being blonde, white, and popular), and the conclusion of the film is twice as silly as its central idea.  But who cares?  It's a funny film populated with funny actors.  None of them really seem to be taking any of it seriously, and that's a hint that we shouldn't either.  As far as nutty comedies go, this one works just fine, and that's all it needs to do.  Just like most of its characters, the movie doesn't have much of a brain wave, but it does have a lot of fun.

1022694,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000IZJZIU,Mark,"[2, 7]","(2.5 stars)First time director Steve Pink has written the screenplay for two wonderful films, High Fidelity and Grosse Point Blank, so as a director, I would imagine that he would have to read the script before deciding to make a film.  Either he had a case of blindness the day he read the script, or he didn't read it at all.  Also, he didn't take the time to research writers Adam Cooper and Bill Collage, who, while still relatively new to the game, hav been responsible for one of the worst films of the decade (2004's Olsen disaster, New York Minute).  Being said, Accepted isn't the worst film of the decade, nor is it even remotely in the worst films of the year category.  Rather, Accepted is a seriously ambitious film, with a plot ""as thin as Nicole Richie on a fad diet"", to quote Richard Roeper.  That statement couldn't be more on the money.  To retread other reviewers, at the beginning of the film, Sherman Schrader (played by Jonah Hill, whose thirty second role in The 40-Year Old Virgin was hysterical) says to main character Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long, of such bad films as Herbie Fully Loaded and Waiting...) ""This will never work.""  And it won't.  There are holes in every part of the film's design.  None of this will ever work.  It's impossible.  So, then, I pose the question: Why make a film out of a plot that would in no way shape or form ever work?  And please don't answer my question with some stock answer like: ""Well, it's escapism.  It doesn't need to work.""  Which may be true, in some cases, if the screenplay is written properly.  Accepted's is not.  Every character (with one exception; more on him later) is a complete stock character, drawn from every teen/college movie ever made.  Bartleby is the slacker type, who, done right (see Ferris Bueller), can actually be funny.  There is Schrader, the fat kid that gets picked on, and in this film, made to dress like a sperm, a hot dog, and scores of other things.  There is the Tomboy, or Rory in this case (played by Maria Thayer, of the wonderful ""Strangers With Candy""), who nobody seems to see as a beautiful woman (and she is very beautiful), but as one of the guys.  Also enter the Token Black Guy (to use terminology from Not Another Teen Movie), Hands (played by Columbus Short).  Of course, no ""main gang"" character list would be complete without the wierd kid that nobody understands, or in Accepted, Glen (Adam Herschman).  The film is also riddled with gross out humor, and to keep quoting Richard Roeper (from his review of Waiting...), ""You can do gross out stuff and still be funny, but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters.""  So, you ask, why am I generously giving this film 2.5 stars if it seems like I hate it so much?  Well, Accepted does have some irresistable laughs, and it sort of grew on me, but only because of the things it has to say about the education system.  In college, you are required to take high cost classes that you don't really want to take, but are forced to anyway.  Why not let kids take a numerous amount of classes to figure out what they want to do, and still have it count for their degree?  But, the way Bartleby and his gang go about it is too loose for college freshmen.  If freshmen had as much freedom as this college allows, they would be passed out every night and never actually learn anything.  There are more kind of commonsensical things that the film says about our seriously damaged educational system, but I'll let you discover it on your own.  The only thing that kept me in the theater long enough to hear some of the insights was the what had to be improvisation of the brilliant Lewis Black.  There is absolutely no way that these screenwriters could have written such brilliant rants and raves.  It had to have been improvised, and besides, if you have listened or seen any of Black's stand-up shows, his dialogue sounds much like his philosophies.  Black plays Ben Lewis (aptly named Dean Lewis), Schrader's ill-begotten uncle, who used to be a college dean, and now works in a shoe store.  It isn't long and Lewis is fired and helps in Bartleby & Gang's plot to start a college.  With all of this information, I leave the decision to you.  Weigh heavily the points I have outlined and determine if you want to spend nine or ten dollars to see this in the theater, or if it might be better to wait for it to come out on DVD.

To get his parents off his back, the inventive Bartelby (Justin Long), using his computer, invents an acceptance letter from the South Harmon Institute of Technology (get it?).

But the website works too well, and Bartelby is faced with hundreds of college rejects looking for acceptance.  So in the confines of an abandoned mental hospital, Bartelby and friends create a college--really an adult education center or community center--where students design their own courses, design clothes in the school colors brown and blue (get it?), create the school newspaper the SH**rag, build a state-of-the-art skateboarding rink, and listen to radical lectures from a washed-up ex-professor (Lewis Black).  However, Harmon College's traditionalist Dean Van Horne (Boston Public's Anthony Heald) and the fraternity brothers have reasons to close the new school down.Sure, the plot is improbable--as one TV reviewer said, ""Haven't they ever heard of community college?""  But if you look past the silly plot and over-the-top episodes, there's a real message hear about academic freedom, creativity, and appeal to students.  In my years at CUNY and even at Pace University, I was never subject to the extreme whitebread culture of Harmon College, and I'm not sure I want to be.  Even beyond the college trappings of Accepted, one can see the battle between the desire to mold oneself into acceptability by upper-middle class, status-driven White America, and the desire to be oneself and build toward a true calling by following one's heart and interests.  Perhaps we teachers can cull some real lessons from the looney bin of Accepted.BTW, Accepted fully exploits one or two curse words--and excises the rest.",4,Silliness Highlights Important Theme (get it?),1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2238,"['friend', 'Suzanne', 'took', 'see', 'Accepted', 'three', 'weeks', 'ago', 'probably', 'celebrate', 'new', 'hire', 'adjunct', 'lecturer', 'English', 'Department', 'Queensborough', 'Community', 'College', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'Bartelby', 'Gaines', 'name', 'literary', 'overtones', 'least', 'first', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'accepted', 'staid', 'Harmon', 'College', 'hometown', 'Ohio', 'other', 'school', 'get', 'parents', 'back', 'inventive', 'Bartelby', 'Justin', 'Long', 'using', 'computer', 'acceptance', 'letter', 'South', 'Harmon', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'get', 'Bartelby', 'complete', 'ruse', 'computer-savvy', 'friend', 'Harmon', 'freshman', 'Sherman', 'Schrader', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'create', 'website', 'bogus', 'school', 'website', 'works', 'too', 'well', 'Bartelby', 'faced', 'hundreds', 'college', 'rejects', 'looking', 'acceptance', 'So', 'confines', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Bartelby', 'friends', 'create', 'college', 'really', 'adult', 'education', 'center', 'community', 'center', 'where', 'students', 'design', 'own', 'courses', 'design', 'clothes', 'school', 'colors', 'brown', 'blue', 'get', 'create', 'school', 'newspaper', 'SH**rag', 'build', 'state-of-the-art', 'skateboarding', 'rink', 'listen', 'radical', 'lectures', 'washed-up', 'ex-professor', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'However', 'Harmon', 'College', 'traditionalist', 'Dean', 'Van', 'Horne', 'Boston', 'Public', 'Anthony', 'Heald', 'fraternity', 'brothers', 'have', 'reasons', 'close', 'new', 'school', 'down.Sure', 'plot', 'improbable', 'one', 'TV', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'heard', 'community', 'college', 'look', 'silly', 'plot', 'over-the-top', 'episodes', 'real', 'message', 'hear', 'academic', 'freedom', 'creativity', 'appeal', 'students', 'years', 'CUNY', 'even', 'Pace', 'University', 'was', 'never', 'subject', 'extreme', 'whitebread', 'culture', 'Harmon', 'College', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'be', 'Even', 'college', 'trappings', 'Accepted', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'battle', 'desire', 'mold', 'acceptability', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'status-driven', 'White', 'America', 'desire', 'be', 'build', 'true', 'calling', 'following', 'one', 'heart', 'interests', 'Perhaps', 'teachers', 'can', 'cull', 'real', 'lessons', 'looney', 'bin', 'Accepted.BTW', 'Accepted', 'fully', 'one', 'two', 'curse', 'words', 'rest']",N/A

1022698,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B000IZJZIU,Michael Walter,"[1, 3]","Accepted combines humor and serious intellectual questions. Its verve and lightheartedness make it exceptional.Justin Long as energetic, quick-witted Bartleby Gaines is the film's trump card.  Long communicates multiple character transitions with admirable physical agility. His often subtle gestures, eye movements, and vocal intonations give his character depth. The part of Bartleby might have been irritatingly brash or unhappily cerebral; Long makes it seem spontaneous, a nerdy-cool rush.Bartleby's full-throttle energies find him partners in crime. There's Maria Thayer as a zen-yearning red-head, Adam Herschman as a highly experimental, love-god chef, and Lewis Black as the amazing, anti-social-but-I-just-need an-audience Dean (""I'm no longer a shaper of young minds""). Many minor characters have wondrous eccentricities.  Here, individuality is an asset, personalities often fitting together as pleasingly as geometrical shapes.And so it's disappointing that the movie depends on boring stereotypes. The jocks, Bartleby's parents, and Blake Lively's cloying Monica drain the film's magic. Methinks things would be more interesting if one of the jocks had a weird tick or Monica was a multiple-time divorcee. Additionally, I find the humiliations of Bartleby's friend, Sherman Schrader, unnecessary and beneath Accepted's overall buoyancy. Why not keep things on light, fun, powerful notes?The one-off statements by the Dean about controversial issues like health care are at home in the general radicalism of the film. Accepted brings the 1960s back. For instance, the learning map that the disparate student body creates is full of color and fluidity. Accepted suggests that we're interested in the things we're interested in for a reason. It suggests--how intriguing!-- that we think for ourselves.Blending silliness, strong characters, and a nice sense of perspective (for instance, the acronym for the ""South Harmon Institute of Technology""), Accepted achieves more than duller, weightier movies. An art house film would give you characters who questioned the system and were then, predictably, crushed and punished. It says something about Accepted that Isabelle Huppert is not in it. Here, those who question the system stand a chance of triumphing-- and getting a degree.But those bathroom problems oughta be fixed.",3,Viva La 1960s,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2334,"['Accepted', 'combines', 'humor', 'serious', 'intellectual', 'questions', 'verve', 'lightheartedness', 'make', 'exceptional.Justin', 'Long', 'energetic', 'quick-witted', 'Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'film', 'trump', 'card', 'Long', 'multiple', 'character', 'transitions', 'admirable', 'physical', 'agility', 'often', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'eye', 'movements', 'vocal', 'intonations', 'give', 'character', 'depth', 'part', 'Bartleby', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'irritatingly', 'brash', 'unhappily', 'cerebral', 'Long', 'spontaneous', 'nerdy-cool', 'rush.Bartleby', 'full-throttle', 'energies', 'find', 'partners', 'crime', 'Maria', 'Thayer', 'zen-yearning', 'red-head', 'Adam', 'Herschman', 'highly', 'experimental', 'love-god', 'chef', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'amazing', 'anti-social-but-I-just-need', 'an-audience', 'Dean', ""'m"", 'no', 'longer', 'shaper', 'young', 'minds', 'Many', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'wondrous', 'eccentricities', 'Here', 'individuality', 'asset', 'personalities', 'often', 'fitting', 'together', 'as', 'pleasingly', 'geometrical', 'shapes.And', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'boring', 'stereotypes', 'jocks', 'Bartleby', 'parents', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'cloying', 'Monica', 'film', 'magic', 'Methinks', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'jocks', 'had', 'weird', 'tick', 'Monica', 'was', 'multiple-time', 'divorcee', 'Additionally', 'find', 'humiliations', 'Bartleby', 'friend', 'Sherman', 'Schrader', 'unnecessary', 'beneath', 'Accepted', 'overall', 'buoyancy', 'Why', 'not', 'keep', 'things', 'light', 'fun', 'powerful', 'notes', 'one-off', 'statements', 'Dean', 'controversial', 'issues', 'health', 'care', 'are', 'home', 'general', 'radicalism', 'film', 'Accepted', '1960s', 'back', 'instance', 'learning', 'map', 'disparate', 'student', 'body', 'full', 'color', 'fluidity', 'Accepted', ""'re"", 'interested', 'things', ""'re"", 'interested', 'reason', 'how', 'intriguing', 'think', 'ourselves.Blending', 'silliness', 'strong', 'characters', 'nice', 'sense', 'perspective', 'instance', 'acronym', 'South', 'Harmon', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'Accepted', 'achieves', 'more', 'duller', 'weightier', 'movies', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'would', 'give', 'characters', 'who', 'questioned', 'system', 'were', 'then', 'predictably', 'crushed', 'punished', 'something', 'Accepted', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'not', 'Here', 'who', 'question', 'system', 'stand', 'chance', 'triumphing', 'getting', 'degree.But', 'bathroom', 'problems', 'oughta', 'be', 'fixed']",N/A

Accepted is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ENTIRE film; that, and every character is a parody of themselves. The nerdy-but-cute protagonist, the jock black guy, the fat socially inept best friend, the nerdy-but-eventually-sexy redhead girl, the over-conservative dad, the preppy frat boys.... I mean these stereotypes are fun when a genius comedy like Animal House falls back on them but when the formula is as tired as it is today a movie like Accepted is just a waste of time. The story is so tired and predictable that the audience knows how the movie will wrap up ten minutes in.To add insult to injury the movie isn't even funny. The American Pie series was hilarious because the writing was actually good - in this case the writing is second-rate and unoriginal. The slapstick is forced, the dialog  is generic. I can't think of any moments where I laughed especially hard, other than the time when I realized I actually spent money on this turd of a movie.I hated the main character. He was cocky and irritating and almost deserved being tormented by the frat boys. Certain characters, like say Ferris Beuller, make cheating and laziness look fun and charming; this protagonist (notice I forgot his name) makes misbehaving look like the biggest pain in the behind and deserves a punch in the face for all the pointless hope he instills in his fellow rejects.Admittedly the film's message is somewhat positive, that college should not define one's life as it so often does in America.

Oh ya the college they made up is called South Harmon. So this kid went and wrote a letter saying he got accepted so he put it in his own mailbox so his dad would get it and open it. It would say well you will have to watch the movie to figure that out. The dad told the boy that he wanted to see the dean, and so he went to one of his friends uncle and asked him to do it because he used to be a dean then he stopped.Then when the kid made the website he put if you would like to apply push here and they had about close to 365 students that made it apply and they couldn't just tell them it wasn't a real school. So they did was party and party till they couldn't party anymore.Here Comes The BAD PartThere was also a school called Harmon and the Harmon school wanted to make a big beautiful walk way. Harmon's dean told them that they had tear down all the buildings that was in its way so that meant that they had to tear down South Harmon but they didn't know it was a school.

1022713,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B000IZJZIU,Steffan Piper,"[7, 7]","Accepted is probably the best executed teenage coming-of-age film sinceFerris Bueller's Day Off. This film could've easily been titled ""Bartleby Gaine's Big Plan"" and no one would've complained ... well, maybe no one. ""Accepted"" is just fine.Heavily laden with enough social commentary that through the humor, you won't be able to ignore it or tune it out, and you might be made to feel uncomfortable if you're the person that sold out, or drifted through the hell that Bartleby Gaines is trying to save you from. It's notLenny BruceorNoam Chomsky, but you can definitely sense it bubbling below the surface.So, what happened to all the young teens from days-gone-by who grew up in the newly constructed suburbs and identified with movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pump up the VolumeandBetter Off Dead? I can tell you. They all ended up selling out and moving into newly constructed tract homes, deep in the nether regions of the ever increasing perimeter of modern suburbia or rather, Urban Blight. They all sold out to lame jobs, lame spouses, bought lame rent-to-own furniture and either made a lot, or lost a lot during the dot-com bubble, and then lost whatever else they had left during the real-estate bubble. Is that close to accurate? Probably too close for some.These days though, film makers are pawning off trash like 'The Naked Mile', 'Freddy got Fingered' and 'Cruel Intentions', which are not even worth linking, but a necessity to mention. These are poor, trite and dull comments within this genre.So, what's the message in this film? Well, according toLewis Blackit's: ""You better enjoy the next four years, because after that, you're effed!"" And of course, that's only the beginning: ""Don't come crying to me about what you want to do with your life! Get a Clue!""Yes, that's what he said and he took absolutely no prisoners in doing so. The fate that now awaits this soon-to-graduate generation is probably going to be a lot darker and a lot more menacing then the life that they grew up in, but don't worry - with mass-merchandising, you'll always have Target, Wal-Maze and a few DVD's to watch. But maybe someone will take a cue from Bartleby Gaines and learn that living is sometimes more important than killing yourself to live.This is a really enjoyable movie and the Special features are worth the price of the disk alone. Not that you'd want the just the special features with no film, as that would be lame, but many of you might be used to that.  There are also some brilliant one-liners in this that really make you split into two with laughter.During the deleted scenes there's a segment with Lewis Black swearing so much that it's one long continuous beep and could be easily confused with a TV test signal.",5,Have you got Hobo Stab Insurance? ...,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2757,"['Accepted', 'probably', 'best', 'executed', 'teenage', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'sinceFerris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'titled', 'Bartleby', 'Gaine', 'Big', 'Plan', 'one', 'would', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'well', 'maybe', 'one', 'Accepted', 'just', 'fine.Heavily', 'laden', 'enough', 'social', 'commentary', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'ignore', 'tune', 'out', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', ""'re"", 'person', 'sold', 'out', 'drifted', 'hell', 'Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'trying', 'save', 'notLenny', 'BruceorNoam', 'Chomsky', 'can', 'definitely', 'sense', 'bubbling', 'surface.So', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'teens', 'days-gone-by', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'newly', 'constructed', 'suburbs', 'identified', 'movies', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Pump', 'up', 'VolumeandBetter', 'Off', 'Dead', 'can', 'tell', 'ended', 'up', 'selling', 'out', 'moving', 'newly', 'constructed', 'tract', 'homes', 'deep', 'nether', 'regions', 'ever', 'increasing', 'perimeter', 'modern', 'suburbia', 'rather', 'Urban', 'Blight', 'sold', 'out', 'lame', 'jobs', 'lame', 'spouses', 'bought', 'lame', 'rent-to-own', 'furniture', 'either', 'made', 'lot', 'lost', 'lot', 'dot-com', 'bubble', 'then', 'lost', 'else', 'had', 'left', 'real-estate', 'bubble', 'close', 'accurate', 'Probably', 'too', 'close', 'some.These', 'days', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'pawning', 'off', 'trash', ""'The"", 'Naked', 'Mile', ""'Freddy"", 'got', 'Fingered', ""'Cruel"", 'Intentions', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'linking', 'necessity', 'mention', 'are', 'poor', 'trite', 'dull', 'comments', 'genre.So', 'what', 'message', 'film', 'Well', 'according', 'toLewis', 'Blackit', 'better', 'enjoy', 'next', 'four', 'years', ""'re"", 'effed', 'course', 'only', 'beginning', 'Do', ""n't"", 'come', 'crying', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'life', 'Get', 'Clue', 'Yes', 'what', 'said', 'took', 'absolutely', 'prisoners', 'doing', 'so', 'fate', 'now', 'soon-to-graduate', 'generation', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'darker', 'lot', 'more', 'menacing', 'then', 'life', 'grew', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'mass-merchandising', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'Target', 'Wal-Maze', 'few', 'DVD', 'watch', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'take', 'cue', 'Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'learn', 'living', 'sometimes', 'more', 'important', 'killing', 'live.This', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'price', 'disk', 'alone', 'Not', ""'d"", 'want', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'lame', 'many', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'are', 'also', 'brilliant', 'one-liners', 'really', 'make', 'split', 'two', 'laughter.During', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'segment', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'swearing', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'long', 'continuous', 'beep', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'confused', 'TV', 'test', 'signal']",N/A

McEvoy ""MCWPP""","[6, 7]","The South Harmon Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.) will become a campus you will wish to visit and revisit again and again and the following are the reasons why.Occasionally when you go to review something you are taken completely by surprise. Accepted is one such movie. Both the movie and the features on the DVD will be completely unexpected. I was expecting a frat party film along the line of Animal House or The Revenge of the Nerds series, and ended up with something closer to With Honors. The movie actually deals with some great questions - questions about personal integrity, traditions, growth and values.This DVD is packed full of special features with something for everyone, such as commentaries, deleted scenes, gag reel, music videos and more. The best part of the fun is the self-guided tour of the campus. The virtual tour of S.H.I.T. takes you through the main sets, with mini commentaries on parts of the film that took place on these sets.Justin Long and Lewis Black lead an all-star comedic cast in a romp through University life, as if the students ran the show. The gag reel will have you on the floor laughing as the cast takes the jokes on and off screen to extremes.The feature commentary with director Steve Pink, and stars Justin Long, Lewis Black, Jonah Hill and Adam Herschman is a barrel of laughs; they seemed to have as much fun commenting about the film as they did on screen during the actual movie. They spent time mocking commentaries on DVDs, critiquing scenes and joking with each other. Early on they say if you make it through the commentary you will need psychiatric help, and though that may be true for their characters and the actors themselves, the commentary is hilarious.These and the other no-holds-barred bonus features push this DVD from being a renter to a purchase. This is a film you will watch over and over again. It will be great for impromptu movie nights and to put on when you want a laugh after a hard day in class, or after working on that paper that would just not be written. This film will help remind you why you are really in university and what is the real purpose and goal in life.Pick up the DVD - it will bring you hours and hours of entertainment!(First Published in Imprint 2006-11-24 as ""Accepted Defintely passes!')",4,Great Fun,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2293,"['South', 'Harmon', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'S.H.I.T', 'will', 'become', 'campus', 'will', 'wish', 'visit', 'revisit', 'again', 'again', 'following', 'are', 'reasons', 'why.Occasionally', 'when', 'go', 'review', 'something', 'are', 'taken', 'completely', 'surprise', 'Accepted', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'movie', 'features', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'was', 'expecting', 'frat', 'party', 'film', 'line', 'Animal', 'House', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'series', 'ended', 'up', 'something', 'closer', 'Honors', 'movie', 'actually', 'great', 'questions', 'questions', 'personal', 'integrity', 'traditions', 'growth', 'values.This', 'DVD', 'packed', 'full', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'everyone', 'such', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'music', 'videos', 'more', 'best', 'part', 'fun', 'self-guided', 'tour', 'campus', 'virtual', 'tour', 'S.H.I.T', 'main', 'sets', 'mini', 'commentaries', 'parts', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'sets.Justin', 'Long', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'lead', 'all-star', 'comedic', 'cast', 'romp', 'University', 'life', 'students', 'ran', 'show', 'gag', 'reel', 'will', 'have', 'floor', 'laughing', 'cast', 'jokes', 'screen', 'extremes.The', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Steve', 'Pink', 'stars', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Adam', 'Herschman', 'barrel', 'laughs', 'seemed', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'commenting', 'film', 'did', 'screen', 'actual', 'movie', 'spent', 'time', 'mocking', 'commentaries', 'DVDs', 'critiquing', 'scenes', 'joking', 'other', 'Early', 'say', 'make', 'commentary', 'will', 'need', 'psychiatric', 'help', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'characters', 'actors', 'commentary', 'hilarious.These', 'other', 'no-holds-barred', 'bonus', 'push', 'DVD', 'being', 'renter', 'purchase', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'impromptu', 'movie', 'nights', 'put', 'when', 'want', 'laugh', 'hard', 'day', 'class', 'working', 'paper', 'would', 'just', 'not', 'be', 'written', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'remind', 'why', 'are', 'really', 'university', 'what', 'real', 'purpose', 'goal', 'DVD', 'will', 'bring', 'hours', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'First', 'Published', 'Imprint', '2006-11-24', 'Accepted', 'Defintely']",N/A

Much like many of the underdog movies, accepted is a movie in which a group of rejected nobodies build something that is larger that any differences.  Justin Long plays Bartleby Gaines, a High school senior that has cruised through high school putting forth little effort in formal studies and grades and more into deception and dilenquency.  Finally, as pressure bear down on him from his parents, he get the final letter of rejection from his college choices.  So, how does he face his parents, especially his father.  How does he say that he is really a screw up and missed college?  Well, he tried honesty for a couple of days atleast. But, in the age of technology and with his cunning powers of planning and deception, he spins a sceme to create his own College, the South Harmon Institute of Technology.  Yeah, Far fetched scheme. So, how can he pull off this big, of course, with a little help from his friends.  His Best friend, Scherman Schrader, who is actually attending the real Harmon College, uses his computer saviness and creates the college website, and his friend Monica finds the building, an old pscyh hospital just south of the Harmon College campus.  Well, Bartleby's parents by the story, and pay his first semester tuition, deposited into his phoney bank account for the school, and the process of building begins.  One deception and illusion after another, his parents by in hook,line, and sinker, and he is dropped off to his first day of college.  Unfortunatly for Bartleby, his friend Sherman made the website to accurate and interactive, and Bartleby suddenly finds himself surrouned by hundreds of other college rejects that ended up getting accepted online at South Hampton Institute of Technology.  How does he get himself out of it?...well, why not go with the flow...and the money.  So Bartleby is somehow swept into the world as a College director.  The rest of the movie is a series of ups and downs for Bartleby and his friends, especially Sherman, who is busy trying to fit in and join a frat at the real Hampton college. Unfortunately, the harmon college Dean has got word of this other school, and him and his student community group are out to get the land that the new school is on to expand their own campus. So, in all their are a bunch of different themes going throughout this movie.  I won't spoil the rest of it for you, but it definitly is worth a viewing.  In all, it has a theme similar to Revenge of the Nerds, but on a much larger scale. Nerds was a movie in which a bunch of underdog got together and created a fraternity that triumphed over adversity.  Well, this movie is similar to that, only on a larger scale and modernized for this era.  So if you enjoyed Revenge of the Nerds, than this is another great underdog story.  I can't wait until the DVD is available, and hopefully it will be available as an unrated/extended version as well.",4,"A funny comedy, a semi- revenge of the nerds for the 21st century",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2951,"['movie', 'nice', 'end', 'summer', 'funny', 'movie', 'Much', 'many', 'underdog', 'movies', 'accepted', 'movie', 'group', 'rejected', 'nobodies', 'build', 'something', 'larger', 'differences', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Bartleby', 'Gaines', 'High', 'school', 'senior', 'cruised', 'high', 'school', 'putting', 'forth', 'little', 'effort', 'formal', 'studies', 'grades', 'more', 'deception', 'dilenquency', 'Finally', 'pressure', 'bear', 'down', 'parents', 'get', 'final', 'letter', 'rejection', 'college', 'choices', 'So', 'how', 'face', 'parents', 'especially', 'father', 'How', 'say', 'really', 'screw', 'up', 'missed', 'college', 'Well', 'tried', 'honesty', 'couple', 'days', 'atleast', 'age', 'technology', 'cunning', 'powers', 'planning', 'deception', 'sceme', 'create', 'own', 'College', 'South', 'Harmon', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'Yeah', 'Far', 'fetched', 'scheme', 'So', 'how', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'big', 'course', 'little', 'help', 'friends', 'Best', 'friend', 'Scherman', 'Schrader', 'who', 'actually', 'attending', 'real', 'Harmon', 'College', 'computer', 'saviness', 'college', 'website', 'friend', 'Monica', 'building', 'old', 'pscyh', 'hospital', 'just', 'south', 'Harmon', 'College', 'campus', 'Well', 'Bartleby', 'parents', 'story', 'pay', 'first', 'semester', 'tuition', 'deposited', 'phoney', 'bank', 'account', 'school', 'process', 'building', 'begins', 'One', 'deception', 'illusion', 'parents', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'dropped', 'first', 'day', 'college', 'Unfortunatly', 'Bartleby', 'friend', 'Sherman', 'made', 'website', 'accurate', 'interactive', 'Bartleby', 'suddenly', 'surrouned', 'hundreds', 'other', 'college', 'rejects', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'accepted', 'online', 'South', 'Hampton', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'How', 'get', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'flow', 'money', 'Bartleby', 'somehow', 'swept', 'world', 'College', 'director', 'rest', 'movie', 'series', 'ups', 'downs', 'Bartleby', 'friends', 'especially', 'Sherman', 'who', 'busy', 'trying', 'fit', 'join', 'frat', 'real', 'Hampton', 'college', 'Unfortunately', 'harmon', 'college', 'Dean', 'got', 'word', 'other', 'school', 'student', 'community', 'group', 'are', 'get', 'land', 'new', 'school', 'expand', 'own', 'campus', 'So', 'are', 'bunch', 'different', 'themes', 'going', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'rest', 'definitly', 'viewing', 'theme', 'similar', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'much', 'larger', 'scale', 'Nerds', 'was', 'movie', 'bunch', 'underdog', 'got', 'together', 'created', 'fraternity', 'triumphed', 'adversity', 'Well', 'movie', 'similar', 'only', 'larger', 'scale', 'modernized', 'era', 'So', 'enjoyed', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'great', 'underdog', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'available', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'unrated/extended', 'version', 'as', 'well']",N/A

There is a serious lack of good new comedies these days and if I see another bad 'parody' comedy (Date Movie, Epic Movie etc) I'm going to scream because they have gotten so unfunny lately. This movie had no parodies and has some funny lines and was well worth watching. I thought this was a cute movie and though I probably would not buy it, I would watch it again.",4,I want to go to South Harmon!,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1208,"['thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'had', 'good', 'laughs', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'accepted', 'colleges', 'so', 'make', 'up', 'phony', 'college', 'just', 'make', 'parents', 'happy', 'other', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'accepted', 'school', 'make', 'fake', 'website', 'lease', 'old', 'mental', 'hospital', 'fake', 'campus', 'Things', 'get', 'really', 'funny', 'when', 'bunch', 'other', 'college', 'rejects', 'find', 'website', 'mistake', 'get', ""'accepted"", 'show', 'up', 'droves', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'think', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'movie', 'good', 'being', 'what', 'NOT', 'great', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'means', 'comedy', 'not', 'bad', 'also', 'liked', 'message', 'movie', 'basically', ""'nurture"", 'creativity', 'kind', 'thing', 'movie', 'reminded', 'little', ""'Revenge"", 'Nerds', 'movies', 'serious', 'lack', 'good', 'new', 'comedies', 'days', 'see', 'bad', ""'parody"", 'comedy', 'Date', 'Movie', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'etc', ""'m"", 'going', 'scream', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'unfunny', 'lately', 'movie', 'had', 'parodies', 'funny', 'lines', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
