The other musicians totally blew me away at how goode they all are. Have seen many of them perform at the Opry with other bands too!",5,Time Jumpers,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,279,"['Saw', 'guys', 'live', 'local', 'bar', 'Nashville', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'sitting', 'less', '10', 'feet', 'away', 'Vince', 'Gill', 'What', 'amazing', 'guitarist', 'other', 'musicians', 'totally', 'blew', 'away', 'how', 'goode', 'are', 'Have', 'seen', 'many', 'perform', 'Opry', 'other', 'bands', 'too']",The Time Jumpers Jumpin' Time

Every song is a treat. I missed a chance to see The Time Jumpers while in Nashville. It was a well kept  secret! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about them until reading of John Hughey's passing. They will have a hard time finding a player to take his spot. He can never really be replaced. At least I have 2 hours and 26 songs to enjoy. If you like Western Swing, you'll never regret buying it.",5,Simply the Best!,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,508,"['Time', 'Jumpers', 'probably', 'greatest', 'music', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', '11', 'players', 'not', 'ringer', 'bunch', 'Every', 'song', 'treat', 'missed', 'chance', 'see', 'Time', 'Jumpers', 'Nashville', 'was', 'well', 'kept', 'secret', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'reading', 'John', 'Hughey', 'passing', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'player', 'take', 'spot', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'replaced', 'least', 'have', '2', 'hours', '26', 'songs', 'enjoy', 'like', 'Western', 'Swing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'regret', 'buying']",The Time Jumpers Jumpin' Time

1098148,A2N2CCPTQCAJ0C,B000V0L08A,M. Green,"[0, 0]",This is a great dvd with good old country music. Stuff you would hear at the Grand Ole Opry. This is what real country music sounds like and each one of the people in the band really interact well with each other and enjoy what the other one is doing. I am hoping they will put out another album!! Well worth the money and you feel like you are part of the audience! If you can't go to Nashville and listen to them live then buy this dvd. Not only is there great music on this dvd there are interviews with each artist. It took us several hours to watch the whole thing.,5,Absolutely Love It!!

The only thing missing was Vince Gill as part of the performance. It was still fun to listen to and watch.
