1535562,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B007P1PQT2,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 2]","John Stockwell has directed a fair handful of middleweight films, and though this one shows promise, some bad decisions in concept, writing and editing kept it from being really good.Here's the scoop. A high ticket party in Eastern Europe, replete with high ticket call girls and a high level U.S. official, comes under fire and almost everyone gets killed. One of the call girls escapes with an encrypted hard drive containing some very sensitive information. The bad guys need her out of the way. Meanwhile an American expatriate in Montenegro, with a failing restaurant, hooks up with an old friend to start a detective agency and ends up on the case to save the girl's life.This has a lot of flash and style. It has a similar flare to a Guy Ritchie flick. The characters' names and titles flash in bold font on the screen as their introduction. There is a lot of clever patter and over the top situations. But there is a nastiness about it. Some innocent bystanders get unnecessarily killed. There is some gruesome torture in a couple of scenes and an overall disregard for human life. The characters are quite colorful. The hero, played by Scott Mechlowicz, is a decent, bright and observant guy. He's contrasted well by Alphonso McAuley as the hip, coloful partner, Julian. Paz Vega might be a good actor. She's so stunning I can't get past looking at her to determine if she is or not. Janet McTeer does a really sweet job as the assassin Helen Bingham, who uses the names of various famous, female authors as aliases. The secondary characters all do a decent job.Another problem arose in the editing. I don't know if there is another version of this floating around but there was a transition between two scenes where the characters couldn't possibly have known what they knew without at least one other scene tying the two together. That was a glaring error. There was other stuff, a lot of stuff in fact, that was so over the top it took an already over the top approach and launched it into the stratosphere. For instance there was a scene where an innocent guy gets blown away outside the hotel room where some tense things are going down. Minutes later a bunch of magicians flood the same room. What happened to the body and all the blood, outside the room, from the first victim? Another glaring error.This was a lot of fun to watch and I had a good time for the most part. But some bad decisions made the viewing uncomfortable.

Comic book visuals' knockoffs i.e. interspersed throughout the movie are cheaply drawn, within multiple rectangles, snapshots of different events unfolding at once - done before, boring; frequent graphics with a cheap world map showing a little airplane and dotted lines as it moves from city to city (a cheap way of not filming in those cities but pretending to); similarly are lots of comic drawings introducing each character. Examples, a sketch and brief bio is shown for each of the following characters: The Ukraine Enforcer, The Boss, The Pervert, The Loner, The Extrovert, The Exhibitionist, The Survivor, The Seeker, The Assassin, The Client. You can tell by the list that the characters are weighted heavily toward stereotypes.A not too creative plot of the usual Eastern European bad guy losing his incriminating hard drive to his girl friend who has run off. A hit girl is hired to get it back and kills a lot of people in the process. Interjected into this well worn plot are a couple of searching-for-themselves guys who start a detective agency and guess who they're hired to track down - yep, the girl with the hard drive.Props a bit hokey like manequins and green screen for people who lose a body part or two; bullet hole decals that always seem to be precisely placed in the middle of the forehead. Usual unlimited ammo. Not a good flow in the directing and filming - disjointed.Positives:Nudity (but not cover model level) for the guys, and one for the girls.

That's what this movie reminds me of. I assume that the script for Cat Run was interpreted from scrunched-up toilet paper after a bout of diarrhea brought on by food poisoning from cheap kebab meat. If you gave mentally subnormal 8-year-olds toy guns and told them to run riot in the back yard they'd come up with a better plot behind the gunplay than whoever was responsible for the script to his breathtakingly abysmal film.Cat (Paz Vega - who?) is at some political orgy shindig in Eastern Europe when everyone is suddenly killed and she finds herself marked for death and on the lam because &#34;she knows&#34;. Many characters come and go over the running time, most of which seem to be occupying their own story as the movie feels very disconnected.I've seen many poorly edited films in my time, but Cat Run wins the top prize by a million miles. Characters warp through space and time with no coherence or cohesion. Cat Run feels like three separate terrible movies chucked into a blender, fed to pigs, collected as faeces, then painted on the screen in brown smears. It is truly, mind-bogglingly, jaw-droppingly, agonizingly terrible.The worst part of this brain torture is that Cat Run actually thinks it is smart and funny. John Stockwell's &#34;direction&#34; makes you long for the crude, childish eye candy of Michael Bay. It will even make you forgive Guy Richie for all his previous sins. Nothing, but nothing about this drek can possibly be any worse. The worst part is that he plays the violence for laughs, which is just simply obscene.Shame on all involved. Who would want this on their resume? If you dropped Cat Run in a public toilet bowl it would regurgitate it back in your face.You honestly think that there are worse films than this? There's not. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room had some shred of nobility, no matter house misguided.Do let this film come within a 100-mile radius of your life.Cat Run is presented on Blu-ray in 2.35:1 1080p.

Cat (Paz Vega), one of the escorts at the party who managed to keep her clothes on, witnesses the killing of multiple guests, including other girls, is on the lam. She steals a car and phone from two Americans who provide the comic relief for the film (Alphonso McAuley and Scott Mechlowicz). McAuley talks Scott into being a detective, ""C'mon man. Be a dic."" They open up an office in a porno theater with secretary D.L. Hughley.The nasty killing incident was caught on tape. Cat steals the hard drive from a computer before she leaves the party. An assassin, Helen aka Virginia Wolf (also goes by Emily Bronte), is called in to kill her. Played by Janet McTeer she reminded me of Helen Mirren in ""Red"". She has a dry humor to her as she is a polite ""Mary Poppins"" killer. In one scene she apologizes to a man she has tortured for ""taking up so much of his morning...but you do understand my need to be thorough."" She also has her own theme music (Zombies' ""She's not there"") which is part of the fun.The whole world is searching for the missing Paz. Our hero detectives decide to make her their first case. Paz scams her way across Europe (funny how guys want to help a beautiful woman sporting legs and cleavage) and from TV news shows she realizes the killings involved an important US government official.The movie creates wonderful characters. It has numerous funny lines and some with sexual innuendos, for instance:Hughley claims the shark ate his wife piece by piece. McAuley asks, ""Didn't he eat her whole?"" Hughley, ""Yeah. He ate that too."" While this simple juvenile humor might not work or seem crude in other movies, it was hilarious when they did it, primarily because they didn't harp on crude humor. Even the slap stick type humor was funny because it was quick and they didn't dwell on it. This is a 5 star movie even without the nudity. The movie works better as a comedy than an action film. Dasa Zivkovic who represented Montenegro in the Miss Universe pageant is Jieva, a girl that McAuley meets on the beach in Montenegro.Excellent writing and direction. McAuley as a Scotsman, painfully impressive.Full frontal nudity (""Debbie, Susi, Bubbles, Mila Savina""...not Paz), sex, good use of Zombie cover track, some quick torture scenes.",5,DO YOU NEED A MOMENT?,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2332,"['movie', 'high', 'level', 'party', 'many', 'nude', 'call', 'girls', 'Cat', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'one', 'escorts', 'party', 'who', 'managed', 'keep', 'clothes', 'killing', 'multiple', 'guests', 'including', 'other', 'girls', 'lam', 'car', 'phone', 'two', 'Americans', 'who', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'Alphonso', 'McAuley', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'McAuley', 'talks', 'Scott', 'being', 'detective', ""C'mon"", 'man', 'Be', 'dic', 'open', 'up', 'office', 'porno', 'theater', 'secretary', 'D.L', 'Hughley.The', 'nasty', 'killing', 'incident', 'was', 'caught', 'tape', 'Cat', 'hard', 'drive', 'computer', 'party', 'assassin', 'Helen', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'also', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'called', 'kill', 'Played', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'reminded', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Red', 'dry', 'humor', 'polite', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'killer', 'one', 'scene', 'man', 'tortured', 'taking', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'morning', 'do', 'understand', 'need', 'be', 'thorough', 'also', 'own', 'theme', 'music', 'Zombies', 'not', 'there', 'part', 'fun.The', 'whole', 'world', 'searching', 'missing', 'Paz', 'hero', 'detectives', 'decide', 'make', 'first', 'case', 'Paz', 'scams', 'way', 'Europe', 'funny', 'how', 'guys', 'want', 'help', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'sporting', 'legs', 'cleavage', 'TV', 'news', 'killings', 'involved', 'important', 'US', 'government', 'official.The', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'numerous', 'funny', 'lines', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'instance', 'Hughley', 'shark', 'ate', 'wife', 'piece', 'piece', 'McAuley', 'Did', ""n't"", 'eat', 'whole', 'Hughley', 'Yeah', 'ate', 'too', 'simple', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'seem', 'crude', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'hilarious', 'when', 'did', 'primarily', 'did', ""n't"", 'harp', 'crude', 'humor', 'Even', 'slap', 'stick', 'type', 'humor', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'quick', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'even', 'nudity', 'movie', 'better', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'Dasa', 'Zivkovic', 'who', 'represented', 'Montenegro', 'Miss', 'Universe', 'pageant', 'Jieva', 'girl', 'McAuley', 'meets', 'beach', 'Montenegro.Excellent', 'writing', 'direction', 'McAuley', 'Scotsman', 'painfully', 'impressive.Full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Debbie', 'Susi', 'Bubbles', 'Mila', 'Savina', 'not', 'Paz', 'sex', 'good', 'use', 'Zombie', 'cover', 'track', 'quick', 'torture', 'scenes']",N/A
