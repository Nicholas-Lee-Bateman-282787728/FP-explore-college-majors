The actors did very well with their dialog, the writing was to the point.  Nothing in this movie was wasted.  I must say, though, the cover of this dvd has always confused me.

This is awful, because there are so many incredible reasons to watch this film... besides the appearence of a very young Irene Cara (who I always found to be a hottie), and a cameo club appearence and performance of Jose Feleciano (somewhat reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield's appearence in SUPERFLY) - - and this was the era when Feleciano was so funky he was even rocking Soul Train.As for the story - - its an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet that takes places in NYC - - a love tale between a young black teenageer and a Puerto Rican girl who are caught in between the intolerance of the world around them.The look of the film has that gritty yet colorful '70s blaxploitation vibe - - yet the story is touching, exciting and engaging...
