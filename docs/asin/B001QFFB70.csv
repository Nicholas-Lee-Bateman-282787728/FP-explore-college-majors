1230710,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001QFFB70,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 14]","Have you ever randomly picked a vacation destination by spinning a globe with your eyes closed? The plot of ""Nobel Son"" works in much the same way; it spins and spins its tangled web and can end up here or there or anywhere. It's all at once a brutal dark comedy and an engrossing mystery, and it teases both the characters and the audience along with a series of deceptions and revelations and twists. This is no small task considering the demented nature of the main character's PhD thesis, which somehow forms a connection between cannibalism and a Game Boy system; it acts as a sort of thematic umbrella, under which lies a twisted story of human nature, specifically in matters of making sure certain people get what they deserve. Yes, I'm describing a very broad concept, and I admit that it doesn't do an adequate job explaining what this movie is about. But to be perfectly honest, I don't think I can give you an in-depth plot synopsis, partly because the details are difficult to sort out, but mostly because a description might spoil a number of pivotal moments.I can, however, give you a vague idea. Let's begin with Eli Michaelson (Alan Rickman), who may in fact be one of the meanest, most unlikable characters of any film this decade. He's a Chemistry teacher with an ego that sprawls out even farther than the Periodic Table of Elements. He thinks he's better than his colleagues. He isn't kind to his wife, a forensic psychologist named Sarah (Mary Steenburgen); truth be told, he cheats on her at every possible opportunity. He certainly can't cut his son a break, an eager doctorate student named Barkley (Bryan Greenberg).One day, Eli learns that he's won the Nobel Prize. Unfortunately, Barkley is kidnapped on the day of his father's flight to Sweden. Naturally, his father doesn't believe that he's been kidnapped when the kidnapper, an insane car junkie named Thaddeus James (Shawn Hatosy), allows him to speak on the phone. But as Eli and Sarah are escorted back to their hotel after the ceremony, they open a package and discover a severed human thumb. That's when Thaddeus names his terms: $2 million in exchange for Barkley's life.To describe any more of the plot would be pointless. Needless to say, nothing is what it seems, and just about everyone has something to hide. Take Sarah, whose training allows her to deconstruct things so thoroughly that it's virtually impossible to get anything past her. She remains mostly passive about her husband's appalling behavior throughout most of the film, although there's a sense that she knows him better than he knows himself. There's a quiet but interesting moment between her and Max Mariner (Bill Pullman), the detective assigned to Barkley's case; she hopes that the severed thumb belongs to her son, because if it doesn't, that means the kidnapper is dangerously methodical.As for Mariner, he seems to know that something about Barkley's situation isn't quite right. He goes from place to place, interviewing everyone who might know something. One of these people is the next-door neighbor, Gastner (Danny DeVito), a recovering obsessive-compulsive. Another person is City Hall (Eliza Dushku), who Barkley met at a poetry reading at the local bookstore. I honestly don't know what to make of her, and her name is certainly of no help. Then again, given the nature of the plot, one may not have to understand her. One look at her apartment is enough to unsettle even the darkest of minds. She's an artist with a lot of baggage, all of which carries over into her work. Paintings cover a lot of wall space, and they're all nothing more than muddy smears of color.And then there's Thaddeus. Why on earth would he kidnap the son of a Nobel Prize winner? All I can say is that he has his reasons. When we first meet him, everything is clear-cut in his mind; he has a plan, and he intends to follow it to a tee. But then he kidnaps Barkley, and almost immediately, nothing is clear-cut anymore. Plans change. New lies are concocted. Alliances are formed and then broken. As is the case with City Hall, trying to understand Thaddeus is most likely unnecessary. Even though he explains himself, what motivates him is not as important as what he does.I'm now realizing that this review has been annoyingly vague. But unless you want me to spoil the whole thing, I don't have much of a choice. Not that it matters a great deal; the mystery in this film is so bizarre and meandering that it's really nothing more than a distortion of someone's perception. Part of the fun was not knowing which direction the plot would go in, which is to say that I was continuously surprised all throughout. ""Nobel Son"" is an odd but engaging film that indirectly analyzes human behavior and the consequences it can bring. It's also a wonderful vehicle for Alan Rickman, who can play nasty like few actors I've seen in a long time. What a deplorable man his character is, so unfeeling, so arrogant, so greedy. There's never a moment when you don't wish that something horrible would happen to him. He actually makes Ebenezer Scrooge seem downright pleasant. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he never won the Nobel Prize.",4,Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,5188,"['Have', 'ever', 'randomly', 'picked', 'vacation',

1230711,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001QFFB70,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","What a premise for a witty, malicious black comedy: Chemistry professor wins the Nobel and within days his son is kidnapped. The ransom is exactly the amount of the dollar amount of the award. The professor is a genius, a philanderer with his female graduate students, condescending, arrogant and so insensitive to others he makes us smile. Alan Rickman, of course, plays Dr. Eli Michaelson. Dr. Michaelson's first instinct is to keep the money.Then a thumb arrives.Nobel Son, sad to say, works against itself. From a setup dominated by Rickman's inflated and amusingly self-absorbed character, we're quickly enmeshed in a dysfunctional family that is plotted to be snarkily venomous but catches  a case of directorial auteurism.The kidnapping turns out to have stories within stories, all of which relate to Eli, and which in turn lead to another kidnapping. There are more malicious stories within stories, some of which might even be true (everyone is a good liar), plus a revelation or two. Do we wind up with ironic and extra-legal justice or just too much lime juice on the mango?Unfortunately, the director, Randall Miller, isn't up to controlling a convoluted story of some wit and brittleness but which demands style and clarity. He repeatedly uses flash cuts and speed-ups, along with a loud, hip music score. What malicious wit there is, is lost. Particularly in a long scene in a mall involving a car as a prize, Miller's editing, with all his pyrotechnic flash, loses track of the cleverness of the switch.Miller also has to deal with a cast that, except for Rickman and Mary Steenburgen, is only competent enough. Many seem to have cut their acting teeth in television productions with all those interchangeable roles and actors. Steenburgen, ever appealing and sympathetic, has a chance to add starch and vinegar to her role as Eli Michaelson's long-suffering wife. Bill Pullman, playing the detective on the case who develops a yen for Mrs. Michaelson, this time doesn't bring much to the party. Pullman uses far too much of the slightly scrunched-up eyes matched with a sympathetic or knowing smile. For the record, Danny DeVito has a role that contributes nothing. Still, it's always good to see him, even though his final appearance raises the question, ""What the...?Nobel Son's redeeming factor is Alan Rickman. He plays disdainful condescension better than any actor around. He has a gorgeous sneer, but perhaps to a fault. Many moviegoers only appreciate Rickman for the over-the-top characters he can portray so effortlessly. Watch him in the last Potter movie, however, if you doubt the depth of his acting. In fact, you might also watch a movie calledBottle Shock. It stars Rickman. Miller directed it. Bottle Shock is a charming, coherent movie about wine snobbery.

When he wins the Nobel prize in chemistry, his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and son are expected to join him when he is presented with the two million dollars.  Instead, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom for that exact amount.This is a perfect indie film with a bizarre script with endless twists and turns, excellent actors in quirky, often off-putting roles, a loud, funky soundtrack, and a pace that's so quick you'll need to see the movie twice to absorb it all.  The ensemble cast is headed by Alan Rickman at his sarcastic best, wallowing happily in his role as a heartless husband and father.  He's wonderful.  Steenburgen's role is never fully explained; why would she stay married to such a beast?  Bill Pullman is great as the cop who investigates the kidnapping.

Swanson,"[0, 0]","3.8 starsI'm surprised by how much some folks seem to dislike this one here and on Rotten Tomatoes, especially as it's pretty clearly a dark lampoon that never takes itself too seriously. The script, while occasionally too clever by half, has many memorable lines and moments and enables the actors here to deliver some nice performances. Rickman is as ever a very good bad guy, and Hatosy is the pick of the rest, really getting inside his character and making his scenes crackle a little brighter.But they all get short shrift about 80 minutes in, when the movie goes from goofy to sheer silliness. Nothing wrong with either of those things, but there are so many plot twists in such little time that it gets tangled up like a poorly cast fishing line, and it's easy to lose track of the lure. If the entire last thirty minutes had been cut this might be a really fine little thriller. Then again, it's the weirdness/unporedictability of it all that distinguishes the film, so maybe it's just as well they weren't.All I know is that while Nobel Son is far from perfect, it entertained me in many ways, surprised me in many others, and all in all was a truly unique film, for better and worse. The techno part of the soundtrack is suitably aggressive and pulsating, and it's nice to hear Oakenfold apply his sonic edge to a full OST (his cd Tranceport is one of the classic trance mixes, btw, well worth checking out if you dig his work here).

There is nothing humorous (in my opinion) about seeing someone dig through their own fecies to find a key leading to a million dollars.  Or cannibalism, which is also a component of the story.  I am shocked that this film is receiving anything above 2 stars.  Writers of the new millenia seem to have confused VULGARITY with comedy and we are left with films that leave us wanting to take a shower instead of making us laugh and feel good about the two hours we allowed this person's imagination into our heads and lives.  Great writers of our time had the capability to create suspense, drama, and even compassion for the antagonist, without taking us to the latrine of the writer's  subconscious. They left us thinking long after we watched, but for good reasons, not shaking our heads that not only did someone THINK of such things, but someone else bankrolled to have it put on film.  If this story had been written by the great Alfred Hitchcock it could have been a classic with this wonderful cast.  Or Joe Eszterhas who wrote Jagged Edge, another classic.  All the suspense, twists and turns, without the human degredation.  The reason I say this film is better classified as a horror is that it has the feel more of The Roommate, than Father of the Bride.  Writers are confusing IRONY with comedy these days as well.

This choice of topic doesn't sit very well with his dad, a hateful, arrogant college professor who's just been awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry and who wants his son to carry on his legacy after he`s gone.  Unfortunately, as Professor Eli Michaelson is over in Stockholm gracelessly accepting his award, Barkley is back home in Pasadena being held for ransom by a crazed kidnapper.

The film does boast a number of stars, and does give some older ones jobs.Brit Alan Rickman, (the Harry Potter movies,Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) evidently a very valuable man on a film site, plays the lead as Eli Michaelson, a chemistry professor at a California university who's just, for reasons of getting the plot going, we must assume, been awarded a Nobel Prize.  Rickman turns in one of his patented performances here, creating a truly dislikable character, egotistical, skirt-chasing, dishonest, nasty, and sarcastic. Mary Steenburgen (Nixon - A Presidency Revealed,The Grass Harp) plays Sarah, his long-suffering psychotherapist wife.  Her real-life husband Ted Danson (Becker - The First Season,Cheers - The Complete First Season) has a cameo as Harvey Parrish, a fellow academic of Eli's.  Bryan Greenberg (Bride Wars) plays Eli's eminently forgettable son Barkley, laboring over his master's thesis.  Danny De Vito (The Big Kahuna,L.A. Confidential) plays George Gastner, an obsessive-compulsive whom Sarah treats.  The lovely Eliza Dushku (Dollhouse: Season One)  plays son Barkley's love interest, young female poetess City Hall, a thankless part that forgets no stereotype of what a young poetess might be.  Shawn Hatosy (The Cooler)  plays Thaddeus James, a nutter, who, wouldn't you know it, kidnaps Eli's son Barkley for a ransom of $2 million, exactly the amount of the Nobel Award, just as Eli and Sarah are taking off for Scandinavia, and the biggest night of their lives.  How thoughtless, inconsiderate, and inconvenient of him, indeed.  Bill Pullman (""Lake Placid"") will play Detective Max Mariner; Ernie Hudson  (""Ghostbusters"") will play Sgt. Bill Canega, cops who are brought in to search for Barkley.The presence of both Steenburgen and Danson in the film leaves me wondering if they produced it for themselves and their friends.  Nevertheless, the acting's reasonably good.  I would have been happy to see more of the comely Dushku, more face time, that is, not more skin: there's plenty of that on view.  The movie plays as if writer/director Miller made lists of various old plot devices, and wrote his script, one from Column A, one from Column B.

1230727,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,B001QFFB70,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[1, 8]",This movie was just completely ridiculous and stupid. There were two good things in it. One was the performance of Alan Rickman and the other was seeing Duschkue (sp?) in various stages of undress. It was full of plot holes and things that just didn't make sense. One example a guy that can put an entire car together in an hour. And then the reason he did was totally stupid as when the remote control car was driven thru the wall he could have simply took the bag out of the hatch and drove the same car out of the store. There was no reason to have the second car or to have to put it together like they did.This movie was just dumb.,1,StoOpiD,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,636,"['movie', 'was', 'just', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'stupid', 'were', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'One', 'was', 'performance', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'other', 'was', 'seeing', 'Duschkue', 'sp', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'was', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'One', 'example', 'guy', 'can', 'put', 'entire', 'car', 'together', 'hour', 'then', 'reason', 'did', 'was', 'totally', 'stupid', 'when', 'remote', 'control', 'car', 'was', 'driven', 'thru', 'wall', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'took', 'bag', 'hatch', 'drove', 'same', 'car', 'store', 'was', 'reason', 'have', 'second', 'car', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'did.This', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'dumb']",NOBEL SON RENTAL/WS-2.35/ENG-SUB/DUB/SAC
