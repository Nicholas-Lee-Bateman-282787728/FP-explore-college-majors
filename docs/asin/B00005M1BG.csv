It's standard def. to start, & it's 16;9 format shown in a 4:3 frame, meaning unless you zoom in it takes up about 1/2 of your screen with black bars on all sides. Also it says it's 5.1 sound but I could only get 2.1 sound out of it, with sound only from front l&r & sub. I found no other audio options. I also found the menu to be a bit screwy . The show was recorded in 2000 but it comes across as being from the 1980's! I guess bluray has spoiled me. This show with full hi-def & better sound would have been 5 star all the way, but it's so dated I can only say it's a 3 star effort.

I have seen nothing wrong with the sound quality of this disc, except what everybody else notice the vocals being of sync. This band just blew me away since I first heard them. I wish that they would do a major tour of North America. But our stupid radio stations with their playlists won't put them on theirs. This band is tight and we need to see them perform live here in the U.S. This DVD is appearently the only way that we are going to get to see them live for some time.

Nightwish is clearly on top of their game when they play live, and this perfromance is one of the best I've ever seen. You can't compare Evanescence's live DVD ""Anywhere...."" to this. Not even close. Nightwish makes Evenescence look like a garage band when it come to playing live in my opinion. I like Evanescence, but they're just rookies as far as I'm concerned....This is also much better than Nightwish's othere DVD ""End Of Innocence"". This is a more mature, a more focused Nightwish. They've made the leap, and I'm very impressed with their product on stage. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Awesome....I also recently purchaced The Gathering's live DVD ""In Motion"", and they also are one of the very best live Goth Metal bands around. I was blwon away with how good The Gathering are. I can't decide which DVD I enjoy more. Both are incredible, and a must purchace for anyone who listens to Goth....Hopefully, Lacuna Coil will follow the live DVD trend, and release a live DVD of their own. I think after they see this performance by Nightwish, which I'm sure they arleady have, they'll be so impressed, they'll want to do one as well. I can't wait, as they are my favorite Goth Metal band.

Now how can  voice overpower the guitars? She does easily with little effort on her part. If you love nightwish then you must have this dvd. I have surround sound set up so it was plenty loud for me and I had no problems with the sound .

664791,ASLFG5MP7HLHZ,B00005M1BG,"Ryan Seek ""trans-siberian_outcast""","[2, 4]","This DVD features shockingly great audio for such an old concert (2001). Excellent bass and treble, and clarity of instruments. The sound on this one is nearly as good as their more recent 2005 performance on the End of an Era DVD. The volume level is a bit lower than more modern, professionally-produced DVDs, but not by much. I normally rock the volume at about 60% of max, and this one takes upward of 80% to rattle the windows.The video is in widescreen. and is a bit grainy (possibly for effect), but more than acceptable (awesome lighting). Kudos on the excellent video editing as well, with the camera primarily focusing on whatever's pertinent to the song for as long as it takes... meaning you often see entire riffs, vocal lines, and drum rolls in their entirety before the next camera-cut.This is early Nightwish, and an impressive performance of songs from Oceanborn, and Wishmaster, plus a little of Angels Fall First. It's mostly a Tarja concert which is fine by me. The male (beast) vocals are briefly featured by special guest vocalists, and nothing like the frequent trade off between her and Marco on the End of an Era DVD. In fact, the bass player doesn't sing a lick on this one and is mostly in the background. All other players are the same.I have to give this concert 5-stars. I've been addicted to it for nearly a month and that's the bottom line. Great sound, good video, and a classic Nightwish performance = pure entertainment for me. I'm just sorry I didn't discover this DVD a couple years ago when it was finally released.

I tend to think that this is a technical problem rather than a miming issue, as a classically trained goddess such as Tarja would never need to fake her awesome vocals.While various people have combined Trance and opera very effectively in the past, Nightwish are one of the few Gothic Metal bands who also have this amazing combination, and to have such a beautiful woman out front, just adds to the magic that this immensely talented band have to offer.Because of the age of this DVD, it doesn't have some of my favorite tracks such as The Siren, but the track selection, which includes such classics as Kinslayer, is excellent.
