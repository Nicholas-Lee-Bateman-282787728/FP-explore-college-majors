He and his group are in a new studio and set to give you a good strong ab workout.  Billy and his group are quite thorough in their ab work.

1382493,A2XEHY57ACYLJJ,B00429C1RU,"H. Graves ""Wellness For Life""","[48, 50]","I bought this product, Insane Abs last night and tried it out this morning. The total workout is just over 45 minutes long. It starts with a warm-up and the the first 30 minutes is standing abs. It consists of light cardio moves that incorporate twisting, bi-lateral movement to help you contract the abs. During this part of the video it would be easy to cheat by just doing the movement and not contracting your abs, however if you really focus on tightening your abs through the movement it is a great workout. The last 15 minutes are spent doing floor ab work. This is the most challenging part. He has some moves from the first Tae Bo series (side crunches) and also incorporates some more advanced moves. I am pretty fit and was not able to do all of the reps of all the advanced moves, but I like having something to work up to. My abs are very warm and feel great. I think I will be a little sore tomorrow morning-which is a good thing.I also like how Billy shares that exercise alone will not tone your midsection. You have to do cardio to burn the fat, strength to tone the muscles, and eat a healthy diet to reduce the fat in your midsection. Billy is on his game for the most part during the video. He only messes up once by doing leg movement on one side during a standing exercise and not the other. I will simply remember to do it on both sides next time. That is why I gave the video 4 stars instead of five.",4,A Nice Spin on Abs,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1424,"['bought', 'product', 'Insane', 'Abs', 'last', 'night', 'tried', 'out', 'morning', 'total', 'workout', 'just', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'warm-up', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'standing', 'abs', 'light', 'cardio', 'moves', 'incorporate', 'twisting', 'bi-lateral', 'movement', 'help', 'contract', 'abs', 'part', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'cheat', 'just', 'doing', 'movement', 'not', 'contracting', 'abs', 'however', 'really', 'focus', 'tightening', 'abs', 'movement', 'great', 'workout', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'spent', 'doing', 'floor', 'ab', 'work', 'most', 'challenging', 'part', 'moves', 'first', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'series', 'side', 'crunches', 'also', 'more', 'advanced', 'moves', 'am', 'pretty', 'fit', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'do', 'reps', 'advanced', 'moves', 'like', 'having', 'something', 'work', 'up', 'abs', 'are', 'very', 'warm', 'feel', 'great', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'sore', 'tomorrow', 'morning-which', 'good', 'thing.I', 'also', 'how', 'Billy', 'shares', 'exercise', 'alone', 'will', 'not', 'tone', 'midsection', 'have', 'do', 'cardio', 'burn', 'fat', 'strength', 'tone', 'muscles', 'eat', 'healthy', 'diet', 'reduce', 'fat', 'midsection', 'Billy', 'game', 'most', 'part', 'video', 'only', 'up', 'once', 'doing', 'leg', 'movement', 'one', 'side', 'standing', 'exercise', 'not', 'other', 'will', 'simply', 'remember', 'do', 'sides', 'time', 'why', 'gave', 'video', '4', 'stars', 'instead', 'five']",N/A

1382498,A2EYVGXW1H3ZFR,B00429C1RU,Red,"[0, 0]","Now that he has done away with the props and gone back to basics I feel Mr. Blanks has had something of a comeback and this dvd falls in that category.  It is 50:47 with warm-up for 3 minutes and then 27 minutes or cardio with ab focus and standing ab work moving on to 15 minutes ab work on floor and 5 cool down.  This is not the calorie torcher of some of the other dvds but you will burn around 400 plus.  (Will report how many I burned when I do it wearing my heart rate monitor.)The focus here is all on abs and proper form.  Speaking of form, I think Mr. Banks is extremely underrated as an instructor due to his somewhat erratic counting of exercises and his tendency to talk to camera which is a shame since he is one of the best in the business. (He was born 9-1-1958 which means he was 55 when he filmed this - if that is not impressive I do not know what is.) His technique, instruction and big ole heart really shine in the dvd plus the bonus tutorial making this an excellent first stop for beginners and those new to Tae Bo.  I have been taking in workout classes or doing fitness dvds for 35 years and I learned some new things in this dvd that really helped keep my abs engaged.Highly recommend to add to your fitness program to work core and abs.",5,Another great Tae Bo dvd,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1264,"['Now', 'done', 'away', 'props', 'gone', 'back', 'basics', 'feel', 'Mr.', 'Blanks', 'had', 'something', 'comeback', 'dvd', 'category', '50:47', 'warm-up', '3', 'minutes', 'then', '27', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'ab', 'focus', 'standing', 'ab', 'work', 'moving', '15', 'minutes', 'ab', 'work', 'floor', '5', 'cool', 'down', 'not', 'calorie', 'torcher', 'other', 'dvds', 'will', 'burn', 'around', '400', 'plus', 'Will', 'report', 'how', 'many', 'burned', 'when', 'do', 'wearing', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'focus', 'here', 'abs', 'proper', 'form', 'Speaking', 'form', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'instructor', 'due', 'somewhat', 'erratic', 'counting', 'exercises', 'tendency', 'talk', 'camera', 'shame', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'was', 'born', '9-1-1958', 'was', '55', 'when', 'filmed', 'not', 'impressive', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'technique', 'instruction', 'big', 'ole', 'heart', 'really', 'shine', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'tutorial', 'making', 'excellent', 'first', 'stop', 'beginners', 'new', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'workout', 'classes', 'doing', 'fitness', 'dvds', '35', 'years', 'learned', 'new', 'things', 'dvd', 'really', 'helped', 'keep', 'abs', 'engaged.Highly', 'recommend', 'add', 'fitness', 'program', 'work', 'core', 'abs']",N/A

While there are some of the same moves from Ab Bootcamp and Amped Rockin Abs, there are quite a few new ab moves and some recycled moves with a twist.  I think this DVD will be very effective if you understand the Tae Bo technique and maintain proper form. The workout is almost 50 mins long which is probably his longest ""Ab"" workout to date.  This is a good workout and worth buying, however I don't think it's for beginners.
