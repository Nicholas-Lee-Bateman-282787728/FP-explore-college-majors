1456402,A1MECEHZHFE5PT,B005E7SEL6,"Dayna Newman ""Slasher Diva""","[3, 3]","I was immediately drawn into the film Septien as the beginning credits were rolling because of the Bizarre yet Fascinating artwork that was featured. As I watched I realized they were painted by a main character the film surrounds itself around.The art was genius in a sick kind of way.The story focuses on 4 brothers who all have serious issues that slowly unfold as the film progresses.One of the brothers returns after being gone for fifteen years and is welcomed back like it had only been a time span of six month or so.I don't want to reveal much but it was billed as a Horror film ,I would not say it was in any kind of Horror Sub Genre but a mystery,Psychological drama with just enough  Black comedy thrown in to keep it balanced. Listen very carefully to some of the dialogue and your jaw will drop plus there are a couple of scenes that are jaw dropping as well.I was sucked in and even though it was quite slow paced I didn't even want to stop it for a bathroom break afraid I was going to miss the big payoff.By the end you pretty much figure out what is and what isn't and the way they slowly slipped in pieces of the puzzle was subtly genius.",4,Bizarre and Fascinating,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1157,"['was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'film', 'Septien', 'beginning', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'Bizarre', 'yet', 'Fascinating', 'artwork', 'was', 'featured', 'watched', 'realized', 'were', 'painted', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'around.The', 'art', 'was', 'genius', 'sick', 'kind', 'way.The', 'story', 'focuses', '4', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'slowly', 'unfold', 'film', 'progresses.One', 'brothers', 'returns', 'being', 'gone', 'fifteen', 'years', 'welcomed', 'back', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'time', 'span', 'six', 'month', 'so.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'much', 'was', 'billed', 'Horror', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'kind', 'Horror', 'Sub', 'Genre', 'mystery', 'Psychological', 'drama', 'just', 'enough', 'Black', 'comedy', 'thrown', 'keep', 'balanced', 'Listen', 'very', 'carefully', 'dialogue', 'jaw', 'will', 'drop', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'well.I', 'was', 'sucked', 'even', 'was', 'quite', 'slow', 'paced', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'stop', 'bathroom', 'break', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'miss', 'big', 'payoff.By', 'end', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'way', 'slowly', 'slipped', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'was', 'subtly', 'genius']",Septien

Cornelius Rawlings (Michael Tully) returns home after an 18 year hiatus. He is moody and still has his demons. Why if left is unknown and why he bothered to come back is even more of a mystery. We find out that while in high school he was a jock. His brother Ezra (Robert Longstreet) has assumed the role of the family patriarch or matriarch. He attends church and is overly neat to the point of being a stereotypical gay. Brother Amos (Onur Tukel) has issues too. He spends his time in a shed making horrible drawings that depict sex and dismemberment. Wilbur Cunningham (Jim Willingham) is mentally slow and lives outside in a large truck tire.The characters are ""Scott Pilgrim"" quirky, but clearly they have far deeper and darker issues. You want to know about their past which has shaped their present. The art show was totally bizarre. The movie was shot cheaply on 16MM for effect. This is a film for extreme indy lovers. Characters were well played.F-bomb, only drawn nudity and sex...and rather poorly.",4,SMOTHER THE DEMONS,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1106,"['interesting', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'what', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Cornelius', 'Rawlings', 'Michael', 'Tully', 'home', '18', 'year', 'hiatus', 'moody', 'still', 'demons', 'Why', 'left', 'unknown', 'why', 'bothered', 'come', 'back', 'even', 'more', 'mystery', 'find', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'jock', 'brother', 'Ezra', 'Robert', 'Longstreet', 'assumed', 'role', 'family', 'patriarch', 'matriarch', 'church', 'overly', 'neat', 'point', 'being', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'Brother', 'Amos', 'Onur', 'Tukel', 'issues', 'too', 'time', 'shed', 'making', 'horrible', 'drawings', 'depict', 'sex', 'dismemberment', 'Wilbur', 'Cunningham', 'Jim', 'Willingham', 'mentally', 'slow', 'lives', 'outside', 'large', 'truck', 'tire.The', 'characters', 'are', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'quirky', 'clearly', 'have', 'far', 'deeper', 'darker', 'issues', 'want', 'know', 'past', 'shaped', 'present', 'art', 'show', 'was', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'cheaply', '16MM', 'effect', 'film', 'extreme', 'indy', 'lovers', 'Characters', 'were', 'well', 'played.F-bomb', 'only', 'nudity', 'sex', 'rather', 'poorly']",Septien
