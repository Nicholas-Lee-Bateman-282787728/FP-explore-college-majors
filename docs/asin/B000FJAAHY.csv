I used to watch Punky obessessively when I was little, she was the epitamy of cool and spunk back then. I loved how fashion sense and how her colorful shoes never matched. My fave epsiode from season three is when Punky buys her first bra, an awkward and funny situation since her foster father has to go along with her to get one. I can't wait 'til season four is released in the near future. Punky Brewster was a show that always had great and important storylines for kids and even adults.

The third season (1987-1988) marked big changes for the show. This would be the first season that the show would air in syndication rather than as a regular part of the NBC television schedule. So if you missed these episodes the first time around now is your chance to own them.There were several cast changes during the third season. The character of Mike Fulton (portrayed by T.K. Carter) was not seen as Punky's teacher anymore. A new child actor was introduced, the character of Spud. Spud was full of pranks, antics and jokes. The character who played Alan left the show following his parents divorce.During the shows third season the actors were older and a new era as far as child/pre-teen television shows was emerging. ""Just for kids"" kind of shows such of the early 80's such as Silver Spoons, Diff'Rent Strokes, and Webster had been replaced by shows such as Growing Pains, Who's The Boss, The Cosby Show and Mr. Belvidere. Although the casts of these shows primarily consisted of child actors, the storylines often drew in an adult audience.In the shows third season Punky Brewster continued to focus on the kids and in the tradition of the first two seasons hard hitting real life topics were addressed in nearly every episode. Topics dealt with by Punky and the gang included weight issues, divorce, rumors, plagiarism, grief management, dating, crushes and prescription drug addiction among other.As with previous seasons there were celebrity special guests. The season opens with the episode ""Reading, Writing, and Rock & Roll,"" in which the group Debarge pays Punky a visit at her home.As with the previous two seasons released Punky Brewster The Complete Third Season DVD box set features 4 discs and this offering includes over 2 1/2 hours of the morning television cartoon It's Punky Brewster.

991478,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B000FJAAHY,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[0, 0]","The Punky Brewster saga continues..............and in this great Season 3 DVD set, Punky & her gang are growing up!!!This 4-disc set includes all 22 episodes of the 3rd season (which aired in the fall of 1987). However, there was a gap of a year & 7-8 months (from March 1986 to the end of October 1987) between the 2nd Season and the 3rd Season. Also, Punky Brewster returned for Season 3 in ""first-run syndication"" instead of being listed as a regular show on the NBC TV schedule. After the Season 2 finale episode, ""Accidents Happen"" which aired on March 9, 1986, NO new episodes were broadcast and the show did NOT return to the air again until October 30, 1987. Beginning on that premiere date, Punky was packaged such that new episodes would air once every weekday (usually late in the afternoon on independent stations). The entire third season (1986/87) aired in the five-days-a-week format until Season 3 concluded in December 1987.Moreover, the change from being an NBC show to a show in ""first-run syndication"" was NOT the only change to occur in Season 3. Though this season of Punky Brewster (like the previous seasons) focused on Punky, her new dad Henry (who adopted Punky towards the end of Season 2), her friends, school, boys, and the ups & downs craziness of growing up, there WERE distinct CHANGES afoot!First of all, there were several cast member departures & arrivals during this season. The character of Punky's teacher (as well as both Punky & Henry's friend) Mike Fulton (played by T.K. Carter) no longer appears on the show, and the character of Punky's goofy friend, Allen Anderson (played by Casey Ellison) left the show following the divorce of his parents (and the out-of-state move to Kansas of him & his mother) in the 4th episode of this season titled, ""Divorce, Anderson Style"".After the departure of Allen Anderson, the show introduced a new character, Farley ""Spud"" Blugner (played by Brent Chalem) who like Allen, was full of pranks, jokes & other antics. However, in my opinion, this character was a pale comparison to Allen, who was a LOT funnier (and more naturally, rather than in a fake & contrived way like Spud) and far, far less (if at all!) annoying than ""Spud"" Blugner!Also, the 3rd Season involved a lot of changes to the character of title character (and ""heroine"") Punky Brewster. Although Punky is just as sweet & bubbly as ever, now she (and her friends!) are growing up -- and dealing with new challenges & issues as they mature and start facing puberty and adolescence.For example, in Season 3, Punky trades out her ADORABLE pig-tails (secured by rubber bands with suns on them!) for a more mature 1980's hairstyle (yet still one with all the flair & pizzazz of Punky Brewster) and in the episode, ""The Metamorphosis"", Punky & Henry have to buy Punky her first bra. Punky is also maturing in other ways, going from having no interest in boys (or more specifically, having a boyfriend!) to suddenly getting crushes and starting to become somewhat ""boy-crazy"" this season.But despite everything, at her core, Punky Brewster (both the character and the show itself!) remains essentially the same -- a caring & vivacious girl with a lot of spunk and an engaging & endearing personality, who LOVES her adoptive father, Henry, is loyal to her friends, is kind, compassionate and helpful to those with difficulties, and fills the lives of all those around her, with her unique style, overflowing with flair, pizzazz and her youthful spirit.Furthermore, just as in the previous 2 seasons, this season also has its share of ""heavy"" episodes that deal with serious ""A Very Special Episode"" issues. In Season 3, there are episodes that deal with divorce & moving (Divorce, Anderson Style), drinking & driving (Beer & Buffalos Don't Mix), the loss of a pet (Open Door, Broken Heart), the death of parents/loved ones (The Anniversary), suicide attempts (This Spud's for You), prescription-pill addiction (Unhooking Henry) and more!But though this season deals with several serious issues, they are presented in such a way that it is suitable for all ages to see. Also, like Season 1 and 2, there is no graphic violence, or other inappropriate material.I have several favorite episodes this season, like ""Beer & Buffalos Don't Mix"", ""Hands Across the Halls"", ""The Metamorphosis"", ""Fighting City Hall"", and more! But out of all the episodes on this set, but I think my most favorite episode would have to be ""Unhooking Henry"" where Punky helps her adoptive father, Henry, kick an addiction to prescription sleeping pills.However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set, as well as all of the previous Punky Brewster season sets), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for7th Heaven - The Complete Third SeasonandLaw & Order: The Ninth Yearamong others!) instead!I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.The first is that just like the previous seasons, there is still NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.In that same vein, there is also still NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. As I said in my review for Season 1 & 2, this is a minor quibble, though many other DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.It's a shame because with a couple exceptions, this DVD set is GREAT! I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can watch this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would help to decipher mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue. Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD or especially a DVD box set!My second quibble is that, with the exception of 10 episodes of the ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, there are NO other Special Features on this DVD set. Not only are there NO interviews of cast members & producers/directors (like there were in the previous 2 seasons) but there are also NO other bonuses (bloopers, deleted scenes, episode commentaries, etc.) either! NONE WHATSOEVER!It is a big disappointment, as those of us who are Punky Brewster fans were really hoping for an interview with the leading actress, Soleil Moon Frye, who played the title character, Punky Brewster -- especially since previous DVD season sets included interviews with George Gaynes (who played Henry Warnimont) as well as with Cherie Johnson (who played Cherie Johnson) and Ami Foster (who played Margaux Kramer)So it would have been really nice if the Season 3 DVD set had an interview Casey Ellison (who played Allen Anderson for the first 2 seasons as well as until the 4th episode of this season) and/or Soleil Moon Frye, who are the only 2 main cast members (aside from Susie Garrett [who played Betty Johnson] but died in 2002) who have not yet been interviewed on any of the season sets. I'm sure that the DVD creators could get a lot more sales, if they just included some of these features which many people (including, but not necessarily, me) consider the whole reason (or at least one of the main reasons) for buying a DVD set.When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like Full House and Who's the Boss?) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the price!Nevertheless, even with those few quibbles, Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!). Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Picket Fences, Life Goes On, and more!Unlike now, when TV is clogged with crap like the reality show rage of Survivor, Fear Factor, and other equally revolting junk.Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion,Punky BrewsterCAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster! You won't be sorry! I sure wasn't, and I play these DVDs often!I LOVE PUNKY BREWSTER!Punky Brewster RULES!

991479,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000FJAAHY,MollyRK,"[23, 23]","Over a year has passed since the second season of ""Punky Brewster"" was brought to DVD in February 2005. Now, after much anxious anticipation, Season 3 of this beloved show gets a summer release for everyone to enjoy!The third season introduced a lot of changes to the Punky character. She was still just as sweet and energetic as always, but now that she's a fast-growing fifth grader, she traded in her pigtails for more of a 1980's pre-teen look and went from never wanting a boyfriend (remember that endearing Valentine's episode from Season 1?) to developing a few crushes. Season 3 zooms in a lot on Punky's friends, school, boys, and the craziness of growing up, but through it all she remains a kid: the same old kind, loving, ""Spunky Punky"" who adores her dad Henry, is loyal to her friends, and decorates everyone's life with a youthful spirit.That classic ""Punky"" touch is sprinkled over the entire season and is truly charming for fans. But just as there are many quirky and colorful episodes (our beloved Punky becomes the school's nosiest gossip columnist, imagines life as a dog, and gets into an R-rated movie by disguising herself as the world's feistiest old lady), there are also some dramatic and heartwarming moments--perhaps more than either of the first two seasons. The beauty and closeness of the Punky/Henry relationship is fearlessly shown in many episodes, including ""Metamorphosis,"" where Punky fears that Henry will stop loving her now that she is growing up; ""So Long, Studio,"" where Henry is encouraged by his spirited daughter to open up a brand-new business that he could have never fathomed before; and most notably, ""Un-Hooking Henry,"" which finds Punky sacrificing her own sleep to help the most precious person in her life overcome a sleeping pill addiction. Be sure to watch also for a knockout performance from young actress Cherie Johnson in ""The Anniversary,"" a genuine tearjerker where we finally learn what happened to Cherie's parents. The heaviness of the episode is considerably out of character for this series, but 10-year-old Johnson blows it right out of the water with a phenomenol portrayal that will make you wonder why her acting career wasn't more extensive. Soleil Moon Frye was wonderful as Punky, but I have to say that Cherie Johnson was the one who dominated the stage with her adorable presence and remarkably expressive acting skills.Those who grew up watching this show will love watching the episodes all over again, and it is upbeat and cheery enough to reel in all kinds of new fans, as well. This Season 3 set will contain more of the ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons that spiced up the first two season sets, but no interviews are included. It was great to see Ami Foster and Cherie Johnson on Season 1 and George Gaynes on Season 2, and hopefully they can get Soleil Moon Frye to top off the final 4th season DVD with her insights on the show. I would also love to see Alan (played by the adorable Casey Ellison) all grown up, or TK Carter (who played Mike Fulton), but we'll see what they can get.A bit cheesy much of the time (""80's kids"" who are revisiting the show should be aware that watching this as an adult is a completely different experience), but never anything short of endearing, ""Punky Brewster"" is a memorable mirror of innocence that now has just one season to go until the entire series is on DVD!

991480,A256JOUD8X0J7R,B000FJAAHY,"musicfan ""The 80s are my favorite""","[0, 0]","This season of the show starts to take on some more grown up stories for Punky such as being interested in boys, sneaking out to see a movie she wssn't supposed to, helping Alan through his parent's divorce, learning about what happened to Cherie's parents, almost losing Brandon, learning about alcoholism, friends growing apart, Henry's sleeping pill addiction, and entering the ""tween"" years.  There is the typical humor and drama to be found.I love this series, but if I had to choose a least favorite season, this would be it.  There are some great episodes, but some are pretty sad and I don't like to watch them as often as others.  Season 4 is a bit sillier and lighter, and I think I actually prefer it to this one.  Seasons 1 and 2 are my favorites.No question though that two of my favorite episodes are on disc one of this set-Reading Writing and Rock and Roll, and Tons of Fun.  The former being the special guest stars episode featuring music group Debarge--it's sooo funny to see the hair and clothes styles they had in 1987.  The song Chico sings to the girls at the end is pretty catchy.  The latter is about childhood obesity and trying to get fit.  Punky's cousin comes to visit and they try to help her lose weight.  It's a good message for everyone to eat better and exercise.  One thing I miss about these last 2 seasons are that they no longer made special Christmas episodes.If you love Punky you have to get each set, because there are classic episodes in every season.",5,Another Good Season,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1494,"['season', 'show', 'take', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'stories', 'Punky', 'such', 'being', 'interested', 'boys', 'sneaking', 'out', 'see', 'movie', 'wss', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'helping', 'Alan', 'parent', 'divorce', 'learning', 'what', 'happened', 'Cherie', 'parents', 'almost', 'losing', 'Brandon', 'learning', 'alcoholism', 'growing', 'apart', 'Henry', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'addiction', 'entering', 'tween', 'years', 'typical', 'humor', 'drama', 'be', 'found.I', 'love', 'series', 'had', 'choose', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'sad', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', 'as', 'often', 'others', 'Season', '4', 'bit', 'sillier', 'lighter', 'think', 'actually', 'prefer', 'one', '1', '2', 'are', 'favorites.No', 'question', 'two', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'disc', 'one', 'set-Reading', 'Writing', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Tons', 'Fun', 'former', 'being', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'episode', 'featuring', 'music', 'group', 'Debarge', 'sooo', 'funny', 'see', 'hair', 'clothes', 'styles', 'had', '1987', 'song', 'Chico', 'sings', 'girls', 'end', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'latter', 'childhood', 'obesity', 'trying', 'get', 'fit', 'Punky', 'cousin', 'visit', 'try', 'help', 'lose', 'weight', 'good', 'message', 'everyone', 'eat', 'better', 'exercise', 'One', 'thing', 'miss', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'are', 'longer', 'made', 'special', 'Christmas', 'episodes.If', 'love', 'Punky', 'have', 'get', 'set', 'are', 'classic', 'episodes', 'season']",N/A
