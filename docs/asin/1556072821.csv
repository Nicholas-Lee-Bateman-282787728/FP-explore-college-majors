He uses his voice to bring out  subtle nuances of his character (something that is overlooked by many  contemporary actors) and gives his Thomas Becket a slow and thoughtful  demeanor.  I do quibble technique on one point -- I thought that the scene  when his gives away his worldly goods could have been played with a bit  more energy; but that was Richard Burton's choice and undeniably, he  interpretation of the character is wonderful.Peter O'Toole plays Henry  II with a gusto that is a pleasure to watch.  With his caustic wit and  rapier like tongue, he Henry II is a man that is caught in the middle  between barons who have little regard for intellect and his best friend who  is noted for his intellect.  Henry II is an intelligent king, but not as  gifted as Thomas Becket -- and he acknowledges this many times.I'm about  to break one of the reviewer rules here -- I'm going to reference another  film and make a recommendation.  Watch Becket as part one of a double  feature, with a Lion in Winter as part two.

That tension forms the backdrop for this film about an early English battle around the question. At least as depicted in the film this seemed an unlikely controversy between two dear friends Norman Henry II (played by a young Peter O'Toole) and his personal political advisor Saxon Thomas a Becket (played by Richard Burton). But that is the rub. Henry takes his kingship seriously, as he should at this point in history. Beckett does likewise as he grows into his role as Archbishop of Canterbury (when that job had real power). In the end one or the other had to win.

177744,ANGH6401L9Y0T,1556072821,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Richard Burton is Becket, a Saxon and close friend of the king. Peter O'Toole is Henry the Second, Norman King of England some 100 years after the Conqueror. The Saxons still hate and distrust the Normans, and name as traitor anyone who does not also hate them. But Becket, always the brilliant strategist and subtle, very subtle, has been drinking and wenching with Henry since they were youngsters. Henry openly confesses that he loves Thomas, while Thomas is equally blunt about the fact that he cannot love. In fact, the one time he comes close to it, a Welsh princess of great beauty who was captured in the conquest of her father's kingdom, he contrives to give her over to the king.Henry uses this hated Saxon as a tool against the Norman nobles who plot by the very nature of their position, and against the Church, which has various privileges, including being tax exempt. (Some things never change, eh?) So when the old Archbishop of Canterbury dies, Henry appoints the one man he believes he can trust to replace him: Thomas Becket. Becket protests that he is not a priest, but Henry points out that he has already been appointed an archdeacon. He can be ordained one day and be consecrated a bishop the next. And so it is done.What Henry had not anticipated was that Becket would take his position seriously. Just before his ordination, he prays before a crucifix, addressing Christ directly: ""Lord, are you sure you're not laughing at me?""One important privilege enjoyed by the Church was that if a priest was accused of a crime, he was not given over to the civil authorities, but rather to the church, which was responsible for determining his guilt and punishment. Henry declares that this privilege must end, and orders a priest accused of rape to be handed over to the civil authorities. Becket sees this as against the church's authority, and uses the one really serious weapon he has: he excommunicates the civil magistrate.I think the whole thing is pretty historical, so I feel free to leave out a lot of plot details. One line, I believe, is directly a historical quote. When Henry is sufficiently vexed by Becket preferring God over him, and by the use of the power of excommunication, he is getting drunk with several of his noble companions. He shouts the immortal line, ""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" And so they do. They go to the cathedral and murder Becket.One other major talent is involved in this movie, and gets too little exposure. Sir John Gielgud plays King Louis of France.

Taylor,"[4, 5]","We waited years for this film to appear on DVD and when MPI finally released it on standard DVD I was delighted to see and hear it so well restored considering the film's apparently bumpy history.  Then it seemed, before one could take a breath, out it came on Blu-ray.  Since this is probably my favorite of all films, at least in this genre, I immediately ordered it.  The beautiful rendering of sight and sound of this film brought tears to my eyes.  I had difficulty believing that this forty-five year old movie could have been brought to this level of excellence.  MPI must be given great credit for caring so much for this film.The cast for this film is essentially a who's who of British acting excellence, many, of course, whom are no longer with us.  Peter O'Toole's achievement in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" notwithstanding, his performance in ""Becket"" is, for me, his tour de force -- the epitome of screen acting.  I think the most moving moment in the entire film is the final scene when he is looking down at the image of Becket on his sarcophagus, following his final lines: ""Is the honor of God washed clean enough?  Are you satisfied now, Thomas?"" His face then, within a few seconds, conveys a series of expressions that I have difficulty describing -- from gladness (that Becket has now been finally canonized a saint) to grief (that the man he admired and loved is gone).  But it was done with such subtlety!  How O'Toole could have accomplished such a thing with a camera grinding a few feet away from him is something I can't fathom.  But it is terribly moving.Only a few years ago we couldn't have dreamt of having something like this disc sitting on a shelf ready to bring this and other classic films to life again whenever we wish it.

177750,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,1556072821,Cowboy Buddha,"[0, 0]","Becket is one of those films that seems to have become lost or forgotten over the years. Which is a pity because, while it is certainly not a great film, it is a film with much to recommend it. Of course, strictly speaking, it is not much of a film at all in a pure cinematic sense - more of a filmed play. It retains its theatrical structure and even has the feel of a play. Most of the exteriors look more like elaborate stage sets (with badly directed extras) than film settings. And the disappointing musical score sounds more like the loud ""we're changing the scenery"" cues often found in theatrical productions. But all of this may have been intentional because the real focus of the film is on the two central characters.The story of Henry II and Thomas Becket, good friends who became enemies after the former made the latter Archbishop of Canterbury, is a familiar one. Just to make matters more interesting, one is a conquering Norman while the other is a vanquished Saxon. Hollywood loves that Norman/Saxon dynamic (see Robin Hood). Although more recent historical evidence suggests that, in reality, Becket was a minor Norman nobleman himself. Anyway...French playwright Jean Anouilh gave the tale the fresh insight and slightly sardonic interpretation of an outsider. He viewed Becket as more pragmatic - even pedantic - than holy and hinted that the relationship between King and Archbishop-to-be was a tad more intimate than mere friendship. Inevitably, the screenplay plays down this spin on events but thankfully retains much of the dialogue that sparks and flashes between the protagonists.The real attraction of the film are the two star performances. The flamboyant Peter O'Toole, fresh from his introspective Lawrence of Arabia, is a revelation and rightly dominates every scene he's in. The fact that he never won an Oscar remains a scandal. Richard Burton is less flashy but just as solid. And yet, as with nearly every Burton performance, there is a touch of artificiality that jars, particularly in the early, bawdy scenes. There is a definite chemistry between the two actors, who were good friends, but I sometimes wish that Becket had been played by someone like Alan Bates or Albert Finney who could have made the character more full-bodied and believable. As it is, I have always been bothered by Becket's seemingly overnight change of personality. In one scene, he's pleading with Henry not to make him Archbishop - in the next, he's suddenly a serious cleric giving away all his possessions. Surely there is a scene missing there. (If they wanted to keep the running time down, they could have easily dispensed with the overplayed and unnecessary interlude with the Pope.)With two such towering performances, the supporting cast has little chance of being noticed. But John Gielgud enjoys himself immensely as the wily King of France. Sian Phillips (Mrs O'Toole at the time) is quietly effective as Becket's Welsh mistress. But hammy Donald Wolfit as the scheming Bishop of London looks too much like a constipated granny to be menacing and Martita Hunt and Pamela Brown as Henry's mother and wife seem merely bitchy. The four English barons who eventually murder Becket are played by solid British character actors - you will know their faces but probably not their names.

Goldberg,"[1, 1]","First and foremost, this is a play, and a very impressive work by arguably France's greatest playwright of the latter half of the 20th Century, although one would never guess this from the rarity with which his plays are nowadays presented. Unfortunately, death did his reputation no good at all. It is packed with words and ideas articulating history, poetry, political and theological philosophy. The dialogue is beautifully crafted, and it emerges from the mouths of two of Britain's finest actors with all the wit, tension, pathos and grandeur that one associates with those thespians who have reached the very pinnacle of their profession. Anger, sadism, sexual excess and the lowest manifestations of the human animal abound, and they flood the screen at a breath-taking intensity. But the most profound moments are those where stillness and silence prevail, allowing the viewers to assimilate and evaluate the chess-like moves between the two powerful protagonists: O'Toole as the coarse and brutish Henry ll, Burton as the calculating, controlled but ultimately civilized Beckett. It is Ali v Fraser, the Thrilla in Manilla transposed to the Sussex Downs. A bruising bleeding contest fought with minds and tongues that goes right down to the wire.It is well to recall that the characters are historical, but not straight out of history. As with George Bernard Shaw, they have been created from history to mouth the ideas of the dramatist rather than to present an impeccable account of history itself. This applies to all the other personna that populate these tableaux. The downtrodden Saxon peasants; the over-arching Norman barons;the Bishop of London (Donald Wolfit); Louis the Umpteenth,King of France (John Gielgud); all are splendid mouthpieces ( and sometimes also codpieces ) for the plot and the action but most of all for the dialectic arguments that underpin this whole production and give it a timeless dimension. Not exactly men for all seasons, but instruments of power for all time. And what Tableaux! The camera does a wonderful job of framing the characters and their actions in unfogetable images and calling us back from the language of the 20th Century into the squalor beauty, majesty and ugliness of the 12th. Peter Glenville. the director, could have been fogiven if an element of tedium had permeated the onward flow of the film as dialogue of this high quality cannot be rushed, but his penchant for speeding up the camera following each dramatic episode and cutting cleanly from each scene to the next maintains a momentum that never allows the story to drag or the interest to falter.

177764,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,1556072821,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","I am reminded, amid viewing the solemnity of this epic that one should never go to the movies for a history lesson.We begin our story in the early 1170s where a procession of monks and crowds of commoners wait outside Canterbury Cathedral for the arrival of King Henry II (Peter O'Toole)to do penance at the tomb of the slain Archbishop, Thomas Becket (a classically charismatic Richard Burton, very much in his element). Dismounting from his horse, he bestrides the steps of the Cathedral, enters, and approaches the tomb with his two attendants in tow, garbed in a red cape and a simple shift( As red is the color of Catholic martyrdom, the color of the cloak evokes some speculation). Soon, both cloak and shift are removed as the king hunches down for penance, and begins a wistful reminiscence about a tragic path from friendship to enmity.Laurence Rosenthal's score captures the early years of the tempestuous duo as a glorious romp through the English countryside, barely escaping by dawn's early light after a tryst with a farmer's daughter (Linda Marlowe), and whereas actual accounts of Becket's life state that he was celebate and abstainant from vice, this version of his life has him arranging more than one such encounter  with the opposite sex ( and joining him in these escapades) when he isn't running Henry's court.Interestingly, Jean Anouilh's play-turned-film ignores the fact of the main character's having been of Norman extraction, and makes him a Saxon.The real-life camaraderie of the two lead actors comes across very well in the early scenes. The acting becomes more profound with the change in the relationship of their characters.The constant debate between the justice by the state and justice by the church comes into focus. Becket becomes the King's Chancellor, much to the dismay of the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury (Felix Aylmer), who prefers to uphold canon law as the supreme law of England  over the power of the King.A girl the two friends encounter while hunting (Jennifer Hilary) becomes a point of interest for both of them, indirectly leading to a tragedy involving Becket's dour wife, Gwendolen (O'Toole's then-real-life wife, Sian Phillips), and we see the initial rift between the two men.However, they still undertake their diplomatic mission to France and the newly widowered Becket scarcely has time to grieve. He arranges for a French town's capitulation, reporting to the Barons who strongly influence the King, has an initially hazardous encounter with a monk(David Weston) in whom he will find something of a kindred spirit, and confers with Henry in the company of his temporary French acquisition (Veronique Vendell). Soon  both learn of the demise of the old Archbishop of Canterbury, and on a whim, Henry decides to give Thomas his position.The rift between the two men becomes official when Thomas begins to take the position seriously, expressing the desire to uphold canon law over  the rule of the King, particularly regarding the issue of a nobleman, who seized an ordered the killing of a priest accused of improper conduct with a young girl before the accused could be brought to trial in ecclesiastical court. This nobleman, Lord Gilbert, one of the King's most loyal supporters, remains unrepentant, and Thomas excommunicates him.In  real life, the terms of the Constitution of Clarendon, which further fueled the struggle between monarchical and Papal power were another factor dividing the two former friends.As King Louis VII of France, Cardinal Zambelli, Pope Alexander III, and Bishop Folliot,John Gielgud, Gino Cervi, Paolo Stoppa, and Donald Wolfit are the other lead supporting players.Martita Hunt, Pamela Brown, and Riggs O'Hara, as Empress Matilda, Eleanor of Aquataine, and Prince Henry compose the family with whom ( at least in this production) the King has much strife.As would be the case with another King Henry (VIII) and another Saint Thomas(More) nearly 400 years later,  the issue of the power of the Church vs the power of the King becomes a death struggle between two former friends.Despite its inaccuracies, ""Becket"" has a stellar cast, and those viewing it will be entertained by a well-acted and thoroughly absorbing drama.",5,Arresting and Regal Medieval Spectacle,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,4218,"['am', 'reminded', 'viewing', 'solemnity', 'epic', 'one',

The literate and involving screenplay takes a few liberties with the facts, as far as they are known, but does and excellent job at conveying the characters and the political feel of the time.  The direction is always solid, and occasionally brilliant, but most importantly, Becket is flawlessly cast.  Supporting players John Gielgud, Donald Wolfit, Martita Hunt, and Pamela Brown turn in small but impressive performances, and ultimately help showcase Richard Burton's Thomas Becket, and Peter O'Toole's marvellous Henry.  Although Becket is technically the main character, it is Henry who provides the most memorable moments, and O'Toole is brilliant at portraying the slow descent of a fun-loving, if somewhat spoilt, young monarch into a strong and clever king, still somewhat spoilt, but much more dangerous, and also sadder.

Hal Wallis produced and Peter Glenville directed this wonderful period film based on the play by French dramatist Jean Anouilh.  Lucienne Hill translated the play into English and David Merrick produced it on stage.  This is a wonderful movie starring Peter O'Toole, as William the Conqueror's descendant Henry II, and Richard Burton, as Thomas Becket his servant friend.  They spend their time together chasing women, hunting and basically partying.  Becket has been well educated.  He is loaded with charm and diplomacy.  As king, Henry decides to expand his power base by making his friend Becket Chancellor.  Then in a turn of fate, after Archbishop Theobold dies, has him installed as Archbishop of Canterbury.  Henry sees this as a chance to get his man in the right place to control the church and especially the church's money.  What is interesting to note is that Becket recognizes the problems that this new position will cause even though Henry doesn't sense the division that is being created.  He begs Henry ""Don't do this thing"".  Henry unwittingly sets the battle ground forcing Becket to choose between friendship and his new found religious convictions.  The right to try clerics belonged only to the church council but Henry wants more control.  He wants to change the law's jurisdiction by placing church officials under the crown's rule.  When a cleric is charged with a civil crime and killed escaping Henry's men, Becket's allegiance changes away from Henry towards the church.  The conflicts of Church and Crown are played out between the now changed Becket and the now bitter Henry.The film runs around 150 minutes but never seemed to drag.  The only issue with the DVD, that I watched, was when Becket and Henry meet on the beach of France the sound syncing was off.  A fractional delay between the lips moving and the spoken word. This wasn't a huge problem just in certain spots.  That was the only issue that I had with this excellent film.

177777,AC4Z26E60FBEM,1556072821,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[3, 5]","In examining various lists of the greatest religious films ever made, ""Beckett"" is one film that inevitably appears - and with good reason. While it would be easy to think of ""Beckett"" as being a great film because it was nominated for 12 Oscars, I measure its greatness in terms of its acting, the writing, its historical element, and its themes of true religion and friendship.First, the acting. Both Richard Burton (Beckett) and Peter O'Toole (King Henry II) received Oscar nominations for their roles, and both deserved it. Having either of these great actors in his prime would be a treat, but having both together is something special. While I detest the selfish and self-destructive Henry II that O'Toole portrays, O'Toole makes Henry an intriguing, comical, and tragic figure for the viewer. Burton's Beckett, on the other hand, ends up being someone who is not just crafty as at the beginning of the movie but also courageous and substantial in the end.The writing is also excellent. The movie actually won the Oscar for Best Screenplay, and it's not surprising. ""Becket"" is based on the play by French playwright Jean Anouilh and was adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt. ""Beckett"" was actually Anhalt's second Oscar for Best Screenplay. The film manages to hold the viewer's interest, despite the length of the film (148 minutes): my two teenaged children were engaged throughout. Anouilh and Anhalt manage to make Henry and Beckett walk out of the history pages and become living characters. ""Beckett"" is also filled with a lot of memorable dialogue. Not the noblest words ever spoken by a husband, but certainly some of the most memorable are those spoken by Henry to his wife: ""Your body, madam, was a desert that duty forced me to wander in alone. But you have never been a wife to me!"" While my son's favorite quote was Henry's ""I haven't bathed for a long time and I stink,"" the most famous is `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?""Which brings me to the historical element. While ""Beckett,"" naturally takes liberties with history, the essence of the story is true. My wife and oldest daughter both like historical fiction, and ""Beckett"" is fine historical fiction. The movie gives you a sense not only of the conflict between Saxons and Normans in 12th century England but also of the centuries-long struggle between church and state in Europe.But what makes the historical element especially rich is the film's religious dimension. ""Beckett"" is not only a historical film but also a religious one. I don't mean that it merely deals ""with"" religion but that it also illuminates some of the features of true Christianity. Dramatically, it's good writing to have Beckett undergo a transformation from sinner to saint when he's consecrated archbishop. Historically, it's a fact. But religiously, it's true. ""Beckett"" is a powerful portrayal of the grace of God in a man's life, yet it accomplishes this without ever becoming ""preachy."" The same grace that Beckett received and which made him able to forsake all for the sake of God and His honor is the grace which Henry steadfastly refuses to accept. Beckett's religious courage is an inspiring example to me and my children.Finally, Beckett is about friendship. While Beckett and Henry's friendship begins with drinking and whoring, it's a much deeper friendship than that. In fact, it appears that Beckett is the only friend Henry ever had. The fact that Beckett ultimately chose God over Henry is not only a threat to his kingship but, perhaps more importantly to the cinematic Henry, a threat to his friendship. For while Henry hates Beckett, he also loves him.""Beckett"" is a masterpiece on many levels.

177778,A2VE83MZF98ITY,1556072821,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[1, 1]","One of my favourite films of all time, Becket, has come available, at long last, on DVD.  This was a film whose masters were thought lost at once, and potential DVD transfers would have then been substandard - a sorry fate for such a magnificent film, one that garnered a dozen Oscar nominations.  I place this film in the same league as `A Man for All Seasons' and what may well be considered in some senses the sequel to Becket, `The Lion in Winter.'The film begins and ends in Becket's tomb in the Cathedral of Canterbury, not far from where Becket was murdered/martyred.  Becket became a folk hero, a canonised saint, and the stuff of myth and legend, as useful in politics as in literature - Chaucer's famous pilgrims telling their Canterbury tales were on their way to the same location as Henry II paid his penance for the death of Becket.The idea of the separation of church and state is an admittedly modern invention, but even in Becket's time, the intertwining of religious politics and secular politics was seen to have decided drawbacks.  The church in most European settings has historically been a wealthy land-owning institution; in England (for much of its history, in fact a rather poor and beknighted land in many ways), the church rivaled the wealth of the monarch for generations.  This sets up a background rivalry for Becket and Henry II while they are both on the same side (Henry II appointed Thomas Becket as his chancellor, a position not dis-similar to being his first, or prime, minister).  When Henry decided to take control of the church by appointing his own man as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Becket then has what some have described as a road-to-Damascus conversion experience - the film follows this interpretation.`Honour is a private matter within.  It is an idea, and every man has his own version of it.'Early in the film, King Henry asks Becket how he can reconcile being a man of honour with being a collaborator with the Norman conquerors. Becket hedges on the answer, enjoy the fruits of the reflected honour and glory of the king in his life.  Later, as Becket is elevated to the archbishopric as senior churchman in England, he finds the honour and glory of God, made manifest in `holy mother church', to be so overwhelming as to cast a shadow over duty to the king.Peter O'Toole gives one of his most memorable performances as Henry II, a role he would reprise in `The Lion in Winter'.  Richard Burton plays Becket in one of his best roles - in fact, this might well have been Burton's career-defining role.  Burton's deep Welsh accent sets him apart audibly from the more polished English accent of O'Toole, a good device for setting up the Saxon/Norman difference.  John Gielgud has a minor role as the king of France, for which he even received an Oscar nomination, though given the low number of minutes on the screen and the do-nothingness of the role makes one wonder at the politics behind that particular nomination (Gielgud is certainly deserving of such honours, but this role isn't weighty enough to warrant it).  O'Toole and Becket play the friendship in a way that in lesser hands would have edged on camp; devoted to each other in many ways, one senses in O'Toole's performance a Henry that is as upset at Becket's betrayal as he would be at a lover's infidelity.  Special mention goes to Sian Phillips (Livia in `I, Claudius'), who plays Becket's paramour, stolen from him by the king.  Her role is brief but significant.`We both belong to a conquered race, but you've forgotten that people robbed of everything can still have one thing left to call their own,' Gwendolyn pleads.`Yes,' Becket replies.  `Where honour should be, in me there is only a void.'This exchange helps set the stage for the later transformation.After Becket's elevation to the archbishopric and his subsequent exile from England, both Becket and Henry make haste to the Pope in Rome, for his judgement in the matter of who was to have ultimate authority over the church in England (a question that would continue for several hundred years, until another Henry would make a final break with Rome).  Lines of authority are confused in that both the position of archbishop and the position of king are seen as divinely warranted, and difficult to enforce, given the distance (and number of armies) between England and Rome.Ultimately, Becket returns to England, but receives a welcome that makes King Henry jealous and nervous, causing him to utter perhaps the most famous line in the ordeal:`Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?'Several knights, drunk from carousing with the king, take this as a royal command, and rush to the cathedral, striking Becket down in his sanctuary, both to the sadness and the relief of the king.This film was produced by Hal Wallis (known also for `Casablanca' and `True Grit') at a time when the producer's name was as significant, if not more so, than the director's name (in this case, Peter Glenville).  The look-and-feel of the film is radically different from either `Casablanca' and `True Grit' in almost every aspect other than the sweeping nature of the emotions and the excellent nature of the portrayals on-screen.  The screenplay was adapted by Edward Anhalt (who was also nominated for the Oscar) from the play by Jean Anouilh.  As such, it is markedly different from some treatments of the Becket story such as Eliot's `Murder in the Cathedral', although the idea of spiritual pride being a temptation does factor into this film's interpretation of Becket, too.The cinematography, costume, and set design are at a very high standard, in keeping with many of the better productions of the 1960s.  The costumes are more in keeping with `Hollywood' than authenticity, particularly with some of the more elaborate ecclesial and royal costumes.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Best lines (in addition to ones already quoted-----------------------------------------------------------------------`French luxury is very luxurious.'`Why do tailors always want to strangle one's armpits?'`One can always come to a sensible little arrangement with God.'`It's inelegant for conquerors to be late.'`A good occupational force must never crush; it must corrupt.'`Perhaps then it is a touch of vanity.  A truly saintly man I know would never do all of this [giving away all his possessions to the poor] in one day.  Just call it the clumsy gesture of a spiritual gatecrasher.'`Humility is a little hard on the knees.'----------------------------------------DVD extras----------------------------------------One of the highlights of this new edition is a commentary by Peter O'Toole.  One regrets that a similar commentary is not available from Burton or Wallis; there are some archival interviews included with Burton.  There are also interviews with the editor, Anne Coates, and the composer, Laurence Rosenthal.  A TV spot and the theatrical trailer are also included.  There is also a gallery of stills from the film and production.

177779,A2BPDFR58H9575,1556072821,Galina,"[1, 1]","Made in 1964 as the screen adaptation of the play by Jean Anouilh ""Beckett or the Honor of God"" written in 1959, the film takes place in the 12th Century's England but never for a  second it feels  outdated or old-fashioned. The subjects it explores, the passion and artistry it presents in every scene, its sunning beauty, the use of medieval music, and especially, the incredible craft and chemistry between two great acting legends in their finest performances make the film an outstanding cinematic event and one of the best history/biopics ever made. Magnificent in every sense, ""Becket"" examines the complex relationship between Henry II (Peter O'Toole), by the words of Sir Winston Churchill, one of the ablest and most remarkable of the English kings,  and his best friend from the days if his youth, his trusted confident, his mentor, whom he loved, respected, and appointed his Chancellor, Thomas Beckett (Richard Burton). As Chancellor, Becket was involved in the important acts as the distribution of royal charters, writs and letters. Becket carried out many tasks for Henry II including leading the English army into battle. After Archbishop of Canterbury dies, Henry offers the post to Beckett counting on his unbending loyalty and support in religious questions. To his utmost surprise and anger, Beckett openly defies Henry on the matter of clergymen found guilty of serious crimes. Henry decided that they should be handed over to his courts. Thomas Becket insisted that the church should retain control of punishing its own clergy. The king believed that Becket betrayed him and was determined to obtain revenge which he finally expressed in front of his four knights, ""Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?""It's been several days since I saw the film but I still can't (and I don't think I ever will) decide whose performance was more powerful and remarkable. Both, O'Toole and Burton are simply outstanding and carry the film effortlessly. They both were nominated by the Academy for best leading roles.  I will always remember the last Burton's words just before his Becket dies hacked with the knights' swords, ""Poor Henry""...In the last moment of his life, he feels sorry for his murderer, his former friend whom he loved but would not betray his principles and beliefs even for him. Another scene is also imprinted in my memory - Henry invites his family for the reunion where he is expected to name his successor. Surrounded by his closest relatives, his mother, his estranged wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, his three sons, whom he never loved nor they loved him. All they want - the throne of England. All he wants - his friend Beckett next to him, but he lost him to God... I'd like to add that the scene of reunion is the source of another film featuring Peter O'Toole as Henry II. In 1968, O'Toole reprised the role of Henry in ""The Lion in Winter"" where his partner was Katherine Hepburn as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. O'Toole was nominated for the Oscar for both films and lost both times.For the first time since 1964, ""Beckett"" is available on DVD with many bonus features that include Peter O'Toole's commentary, two archival interviews with Richard Burton from 1967 and 1977 where he does not speak about ""Beckett"" but we learned a lot about Richard Burton, the actor and the man, and interviews with editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal. Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, ""Beckett"" won for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should have won much more. It deserves every one of its nominations even now, after all these years.",5,"King Henry II: ""Becket is the only intelligent man in my kingdom, and he's against me!""",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,3577,"['Made', '1964', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'Beckett', 'Honor', 'God', 'written', '1959', 'film', 'place', '12th', 'Century', 'England', 'never', 'second', 'outdated', 'old-fashioned', 'subjects', 'passion', 'artistry', 'scene', 'sunning', 'beauty', 'use', 'medieval', 'music', 'especially', 'incredible', 'craft', 'chemistry', 'two', 'great', 'acting', 'legends', 'finest', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'outstanding', 'cinematic', 'event', 'one', 'best', 'history/biopics', 'ever', 'made', 'Magnificent', 'sense', 'Becket', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'II', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'words', 'Sir', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'one', 'ablest', 'most', 'remarkable', 'English', 'kings', 'best', 'friend', 'days', 'youth', 'trusted', 'confident', 'mentor', 'whom', 'loved', 'respected', 'appointed', 'Chancellor', 'Thomas', 'Beckett', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Chancellor', 'Becket', 'was', 'involved', 'important', 'acts', 'distribution', 'royal', 'charters', 'writs', 'letters', 'Becket', 'carried', 'out', 'many', 'tasks', 'Henry', 'II', 'including', 'leading', 'English', 'army', 'battle', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'dies', 'Henry', 'post', 'Beckett', 'counting', 'unbending', 'loyalty', 'support', 'religious', 'questions', 'utmost', 'surprise', 'anger', 'Beckett', 'openly', 'Henry', 'matter', 'clergymen', 'found', 'guilty', 'serious', 'crimes', 'Henry', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'handed', 'over', 'courts', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'insisted', 'church', 'should', 'retain', 'control', 'punishing', 'own', 'clergy', 'king', 'believed', 'Becket', 'betrayed', 'was', 'determined', 'obtain', 'revenge', 'finally', 'expressed', 'front', 'four', 'knights', 'Who', 'will', 'rid', 'turbulent', 'priest', 'been', 'several', 'days', 'saw', 'film', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'will', 'decide', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'powerful', 'remarkable', ""O'Toole"", 'Burton', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'carry', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'best', 'leading', 'roles', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'last', 'Burton', 'words', 'just', 'Becket', 'hacked', 'knights', 'swords', 'Poor', 'Henry', 'last', 'moment', 'life', 'sorry', 'murderer', 'former', 'friend', 'whom', 'loved', 'would', 'not', 'betray', 'principles', 'beliefs', 'even', 'scene', 'also', 'imprinted', 'memory', 'Henry', 'family', 'reunion', 'where', 'expected', 'name', 'successor', 'Surrounded', 'closest', 'relatives', 'mother', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Queen', 'Eleanor', 'Aquitaine', 'three', 'sons', 'whom', 'never', 'loved', 'loved', 'want', 'throne', 'England', 'friend', 'Beckett', 'next', 'lost', 'God', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'scene', 'reunion', 'source', 'film', 'featuring', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Henry', 'II', '1968', ""O'Toole"", 'reprised', 'role', 'Henry', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'where', 'partner', 'was', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Queen', 'Eleanor', 'Aquitaine', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'films', 'lost', 'first', 'time', '1964', 'Beckett', 'available', 'DVD', 'many', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'commentary', 'two', 'archival', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'Burton', '1967', '1977', 'where', 'not', 'speak', 'Beckett', 'learned', 'lot', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'actor', 'man', 'interviews', 'editor', 'Anne', 'V.', 'Coats', 'composer', 'Laurence', 'Rosenthal', 'Nominated', '12', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Beckett', 'won', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'nominations', 'even', 'now', 'years']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Like most dramas by Jean Anouih (1910-1987), BECKET essentially sets two larger-than-life characters against each other in a relationship fueled by widening ideological rifts.  In this instance, the rift is between the holy and the secular.  King Henry II of England, who--frustrated by the frequent interference of the Roman Catholic Church in his rule--manages to have friend Thomas Becket appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury.  He expects Becket to act on his behalf--and is shocked when Becket undergoes a spiritual transformation and takes his office seriously.The 1959 play was tremendous successful throughout Europe, in England, and in the United States.  In 1964 it reached the screen with Richard Burton as Becket, Peter O'Toole as Henry II, such notables as John Gielgud as Louis VII of France.  The film was extremely well-received and received numerous critical accolades, particularly for Burton and O'Toole.  It was not, however, widely available to the home market until this 2007 MPI DVD release.In a technical sense, BECKET looks better than ever; the transfer is very crisp and the picture likely looks better here than it did on the 1964 big screen.  At the same time, however, it is very evident that this is a film that really is best seen on the big screen, where the larger than life characters and their ideological battles have the advantage of a scope to equal their nature.  It also has a slightly stagey quality, most often in the script, which doesn't quite manage to shed the theatrical trappings of the original.Even so, there's a great deal to admire, and the leading actors are most certainly chief among them.  Burton and O'Toole wench, brawl, argue, and explode with invective with complete conviction; it would be hard, if not impossible, to say which gives the better performance here.  Gielgud is particularly memorable in his brief appearance as Louis VII--and Sian Philips, Pamela Brown, and Martita Hunt make the most of their relatively small roles as well.The DVD has several notable bonuses.  I personally found the interviews with Richard Burton, archeival footage from 1967 and 1977, slightly over rated--but the ""featurettes"" on editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal are excellent, and the DVD commentary by O'Toole is consistently fascinating.  I personally find the film as a whole a bit dry--Coats, tellingly, makes the comment that if the producers had put just a bit more money into BECKET it would have an undeniable masterpiece--but fans of the film will find this particular package an extremely welcome one.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Burton and O'Toole in The Grand Manner,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,2600,"['most', 'dramas', 'Jean', 'Anouih', '1910-1987', 'BECKET', 'essentially', 'two', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'other', 'relationship', 'fueled', 'widening', 'ideological', 'rifts', 'instance', 'rift', 'holy', 'secular', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'England', 'who', 'frustrated', 'frequent', 'interference', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'rule', 'manages', 'have', 'friend', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'appointed', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Becket', 'act', 'behalf', 'shocked', 'when', 'Becket', 'spiritual', 'transformation', 'office', 'seriously.The', '1959', 'play', 'was', 'tremendous', 'successful', 'Europe', 'England', 'United', 'States', '1964', 'reached', 'screen', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Becket', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Henry', 'II', 'such', 'notables', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Louis', 'VII', 'France', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-received', 'received', 'numerous', 'critical', 'accolades', 'particularly', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'not', 'however', 'widely', 'available', 'home', 'market', '2007', 'MPI', 'DVD', 'technical', 'sense', 'BECKET', 'better', 'ever', 'transfer', 'very', 'crisp', 'picture', 'likely', 'better', 'here', 'did', '1964', 'big', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'very', 'evident', 'film', 'really', 'best', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'where', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'ideological', 'battles', 'have', 'advantage', 'scope', 'equal', 'nature', 'also', 'slightly', 'stagey', 'quality', 'most', 'often', 'script', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'shed', 'theatrical', 'trappings', 'original.Even', 'so', 'great', 'deal', 'admire', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', 'most', 'certainly', 'chief', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'wench', 'brawl', 'argue', 'explode', 'invective', 'complete', 'conviction', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'impossible', 'say', 'better', 'performance', 'here', 'Gielgud', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Louis', 'VII', 'Sian', 'Philips', 'Pamela', 'Brown', 'Martita', 'Hunt', 'make', 'most', 'relatively', 'small', 'roles', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'notable', 'bonuses', 'personally', 'found', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'archeival', 'footage', '1967', '1977', 'slightly', 'rated', 'featurettes', 'editor', 'Anne', 'V.', 'Coats', 'composer', 'Laurence', 'Rosenthal', 'are', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'commentary', ""O'Toole"", 'consistently', 'fascinating', 'personally', 'find', 'film', 'whole', 'bit', 'dry', 'Coats', 'tellingly', 'comment', 'producers', 'had', 'put', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'BECKET', 'would', 'have', 'undeniable', 'masterpiece', 'fans', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'particular', 'package', 'extremely', 'welcome', 'one.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Action freaks complain of too much dialogue. But Peter Glenville's BECKET stands very tall; brilliant from every angle. Richard Burton was never better than as Thomas Becket, the rake, libertine, cronie of the king; the politico and gambler who was forced to wear, and bear, the mantle of Archbishop, finding himself inexplicably having to answer to a higher power than mere royality. Burton's performance bursts from the frame, as he galloped the gamut from whisper to roar, allowing us access through his eyes into the soul of a geniune historical treasure, Becket the man. Peter O'Toole was likewise magnificent as King Henry II; spoiled, manipulative, clever, randy, boisterous, bellering at his family; whoring and warring his way into history. The scene where Becket finally convinced Henry that he was taking the office of archbishop seriously struck to the heart of the King, and the plot. Henry, suddenly staggered, realized that now Becket was an advesary, and had to be punished. When mere punishment was not enough to bend Becket to the King's will, Henry had to force martyrdom on him. Anthony Quinn and Laurence Olivier did the play on Broadway, switching parts weekly. Wouldn't it have been incredible to have seen it ? Edward Anhalt's script was clever and intelligent, leaving us with a plethera of phrases, quotes, and thoughts that pierce through our viscera, and inhabit our hearts and minds. John Gielgud was, of course, very good as King Louis VII of France, who gave Becket temporary sanctuary. Donald Wolfit was a fine greasy politico bishop, a hypocrite, villian, and power monger.

I recommend this film heartily to anyone who loves history, loves the medieval period, enjoy Burton and O'Toole at their brio-filled best, loves castles with burning torches mounted on the walls. I first saw the movie in the '60s, saw it again in the '70s, lost track of it, and came upon the new DVD recently. For my money, the film has aged very well. It's essentially timeless. Historical accuracy be damned - this movie captures the romance of history, the myth of history, the wonderful pleasure of history, and isn't unduly worried about strictly hewing to actual events. Several of the scenes rank among the finest ever filmed - I think especially of Becket and Henry on the beach, and the death scene. At times the picture is a bit talky; these times are brief. John Geilgud is very fine - I remembered his sequence as boring, but seen now, it works beautifully. Burton is perfect. O'Toole is riveting - a spectacular combination of gorgeous majesty and odd subterranean faultlines.

Originally released in 1964, directed by Peter Glenville and starring Richard Burton as Thomas Becket and Peter O'Toole as Henry ll, BECKET holds up well with time. Based on the play by the same name by Jean Anouilh, the movie is based-- with cinematic license here and there; for example he is a dirty Saxon here-- on the life and martyrdom of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. (Both Tennyson and Eliot produced major works on the same subject matter.) Although many period pieces like this one are visually stunning to watch, as this one is, they often leave the viewer cold, as this one does but in this instance because of superb acting. Henry complains often that he is always cold and that Becket is not warm in his affection to him. This coldness is so real as to be palpable in the theatre.It is a pleasure to watch Burton and O'Toole in their verbal fencing as both actors give as good as they get. Neither actor ever looked or acted  better. The scene where Becket and Henry meet on horseback at the sea and Becket tells Henry that he will never see him again is worth whatever you paid to see the movie. Other actors besides O'Toole and Burton give outstanding performances as well, particularly John Gielgud as King Louis VII and David Weston as the young Brother John, Becket's disciple and attendant.BECKET is about big themes-- honor (Becket: ""I am waiting for the honor of the God and the king to be one, my lord""), friendship and love-- and  a film for all seasons.",5,"""The Honor of God and The King""",1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1586,"['What', 'treat', 'moviegoers', 'see', 'magnificent', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'again', '43', 'years', 'Originally', 'released', '1964', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Glenville', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Henry', 'll', 'BECKET', 'up', 'well', 'time', 'Based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'movie', 'based', 'cinematic', 'license', 'here', 'there', 'example', 'dirty', 'Saxon', 'here', 'life', 'martyrdom', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Tennyson', 'Eliot', 'produced', 'major', 'works', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'many', 'period', 'pieces', 'one', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'watch', 'one', 'often', 'leave', 'viewer', 'cold', 'one', 'instance', 'superb', 'acting', 'Henry', 'often', 'always', 'cold', 'Becket', 'not', 'warm', 'affection', 'coldness', 'so', 'real', 'be', 'palpable', 'theatre.It', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'verbal', 'fencing', 'actors', 'give', 'as', 'good', 'get', 'actor', 'ever', 'looked', 'acted', 'better', 'scene', 'where', 'Becket', 'Henry', 'meet', 'horseback', 'sea', 'Becket', 'Henry', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'worth', 'paid', 'see', 'movie', 'Other', 'actors', ""O'Toole"", 'Burton', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'King', 'Louis', 'VII', 'David', 'Weston', 'young', 'Brother', 'John', 'Becket', 'disciple', 'attendant.BECKET', 'about', 'big', 'themes', 'honor', 'Becket', 'am', 'waiting', 'honor', 'God', 'king', 'be', 'one', 'lord', 'friendship', 'love', 'film', 'seasons']",N/A

He's put himself on the line for almost two decades helming the Film Foundation, bringing public attention to the need for film preservation. Without the Foundation's efforts, such masterworks as Lawrence of Arabia, How Green Was My Valley, On the Waterfront, and Rear Window might have been lost to movie audiences forever.Now, thanks to the Foundation and to Academy Film Archive director Michael Pogorzelski's painstaking restoration, the 1964 romantic classic Becket has been re-released in all its pomp, pageantry, and Technicolor glory.Fresh off his brilliant turn in Lawrence of Arabia, Peter O'Toole gives a bombastic, explosive performance as the hated Angevin king of England, Henry II. In one of his finest screen roles, legendary Welsh actor Richard Burton plays his enforcer, Thomas &agrave; Becket, with cool-headed erudition.Whether looting among the Saxons, taking liberties with wenches, or even having his wife taken from him by Henry, Becket's a loyal pal and reliable stooge. Then, one day, trying to put one over on the pesky clergy, Henry devises a brilliant scheme to install his drinking buddy as Archbishop of Canterbury.But what begins as a fun romp in the ""buddy picture"" tradition veers into the sublime when Becket begins to understand the enormous gravity and honor required by his office. Transformed from yes-man into his own man, he refuses to render the things holy before God to O'Toole's spoiled brat of a Caesar, who is driven to betray Becket by an unrequited love that dare not speaketh its name.A fascinating study of integrity in the face of corruption, Becket is an unforgettable Medieval epic from the same decade that gave us A Man for All Seasons and The Lion in Winter (also starring O'Toole).

177794,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,1556072821,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[7, 8]","The film gets rid of some of Anouilh's stage directions and the grandiloquent sounding setting he had devised. The actors are great, the acting is very good, and the music is fascinating, though voluntarily anachronic: this is not a historical film. Same remark about the costumes that are of a fashion that will only appear in mid 13th century. But it retains the absurd historical vision Jean Anouilh imposed onto the subject, and this cannot be considered as  creative art, as the composer Laurence Rosenthal says about the music. Becket was not a Saxon since both his parents were of Norman extract and his father was a London merchant. Luckily this film adaptation cuts off the Saracen mother, yet the music and the singing of Gwendolyn introduces another anachronism: the song is in Welsh, that is to say in a Celtic dialect and not in Saxon at all, though originally, historically it could only be in English (if English could already be considered as existing) or in French. There is an antagonistic situation in England at the time: the social antagonism between the merchants and the nobles. Thomas Becket was not a nobleman, nor a baron, but he was the son of a merchant. Anouilh replaced this social antagonism with an ethnic opposition: it is wrong though I do not pretend it is entirely false. Yet fifty years later the Saxon and Norman barons will unite with the church as a whole against the king (the younger brother John known as Landless of the eldest son of Henry II, presented as Henry III in the film) to impose the Magna Carta. The film has a tremendous advantage over the text of the play: it visualizes the meaning with real settings. The splendor of the situations and the court can be seen, though the director, and probably producer never insisted in doing an epic film. So things remain moderate and contain no battle whatsoever. Now the film explains the whole situation as a conflict between the Saxons and the Normans as basic for the conflict between the church and the crown. This is historically false. The conflict is between royal power and church power. The king is trying to impose royal justice and tax paying to the church. He will succeed as for tax paying thanks to Becket himself when Chancellor but he will fail as for justice, at least partly. The repentance and penance of the King is determined politically but not so much as a conflict between once again the Saxons and the Normans, but as the result of a conflict between Eleanor of Aquitania, the Queen, and her son Henry III, the eldest son who had been crowned before the death of his father by his father's decision. These two were trying to set up a rebellion against the king to seize power. But the film is also badly historically informed in the fact that the pilgrimage started before the king's penance (Friday July 12, 1174) and the sanctification was the Pope's decision and once again before the king's penance, on Ash Wednesday February 21, 1173. These mistakes are of course in the play and are Jean Anouilh's. In fact they are not mistakes. They are rewriting history by Anouilh in order in 1959 to satisfy his own personal desires in Paris. He was probably thinking of Poland, Hungary and even Algeria in the late 1950s more than of England in the twelfth century. These subtleties could easily go through in Broadway New York, 1962, but they could have been slightly modified for the film, and they were indeed by dropping the Saracen mother for example: they could have been more. Then the film insists on the love Henry feels for Thomas and here again Anouilh tricks everyone by making that love excessive, even in a way suspicious, and yet based on something historians are quite doubtful about: the real common interest in and sharing of good cheer, wine and women. The acting of Peter O'Toole makes that love become little by little hysterical which is a rather surprising mistake: it could be somber, inwardly contemplative, but not jealous and uncontrolled as it is shown here. It would have been frowned upon at the time, and a lot more than in the film from the Queen Mother and the Queen. The film though minimizes the austere life of the archbishop, though it could have rebalance this element that is definitely made minimal by Anouilh and this deprives us of an explanation as for the sudden change of attitudes of brother John. Note he is a Saxon monk and here Anouilh could have insisted on the fact that Becket was the first archbishop who opposed the Barons who recaptured their Saxon serfs when they escaped into some religious order or monastery. The film is very good indeed but it has all the defects of the play behind it, justly corrected of the most salient elements that were quite absurd at times.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris

But when Henry decided he needed his friend to replace the recently departed Bishop of Canterbury, he never dreamed that Becket would place his duty to God before his loyalty to the monarchy.  Thus sets up the historically flawed but dramatically compelling conflict behind the play and film Becket.  They just don't make films like this anymore, and it is a genuine treat to marvel at the unparalleled skills of these two thespians in their prime.  Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole are both great joys to behold, and the supporting cast, led by a much too-brief but amazing performance by John Gielgud as King Philip of France, are every bit as delicious as the literate, thoughtful script and the sumptuous, colorful sets and costumes.Edward Anhalt's screenplay of Jean Anouilh's brilliant play won the Oscar for Best Screenplay; the film was nominated for 12 additional Academy Awards, and received 22 other industry awards and nominations.  The intelligent and literate dialogue is so full of raw gems that to quote any one line here would do a gross disservice to the balance of the script.As breathtaking as Burton is, Peter O'Toole reveals an appreciation of the character of Henry II that, unbelievable as it may seem, gloriously precedes and anticipates his magnificent portrayal of the same king in The Lion in Winter, just five years later.  But where Lion in Winter proffered a brilliant, witty script and an amazingly modern take on medieval court intrigue, Becket offers meaty drama and dead serious, soul-searching introspection.  And unlike his polished portrayal of the self-assured Henry at age 50 in the brilliant James Goldman comedy, O'Toole's portrayal of the younger King Henry in Becket is raw, vulgar, crass and just what you would expect the lesser-experienced monarch to be, until Becket teaches him a royal lesson in humility and penance.  As for Burton, well, his eyes speak paragraphs, and his clear understanding of a complex role and that magnificent voice combine to demonstrate once and for all that he was one of the most talented screen actors of the 20th century.The DVD extras and brilliant restoration round out the release to make this the not-to-be-missed video event of 2007.

177801,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,1556072821,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[147, 153]","This 1964 film deals with the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, after his old drinking buddy, King Henry II, famously asked, &quot;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest!?&quot;  Its been a matter of great debate whether Henry actually meant to order the murder of his old friend and, to me at least, this film almost makes the case that Henry's words were just the impulsive, possibly drunken words of a rather immature man thrust, by heredity, into a position of power he was not yet ready for.One might think that the political murder of a priest in a pre-Reniassance England would make for a rather dry, humorless film. Luckily, Becket proves them wrong.  Though director Peter Glenville was not a flashy stylist and occasionally does allow the film to become a bit stagey, he was also a wonderful director of actors and manages to get wonderful lead performances from a young Peter O'Toole (as Henry) and even from the normally diffident Richard Burton (as Becket).  When the film begins, it feels very much like a comedy.  When we first meet Becket and Henry, they are two young, spoiled friends who spend most of their time drinking and wenching.  Though, as expected, O'Toole is hilarious as the fun-loving monarch, even Burton manages a few slyly sardonic line readings.  Years later, in an interview with David Letterman, O'Toole would admit that both the lead actors were drunk during the majority of the shooting and basically just having a grand old time of it.  Their sense of fun in these early scenes is easily translatable to the audience and its hard not to like these two immoral rogues and, perhaps, to even secretly want to find a time machine and go hang out with them.  O'Toole and Burton were friends in real life and the mutual affection the two shared is especially obvious and endearing and serves to make the film's later events all the more tragic.The film takes a serious turn when the previous Archbishop dies and Henry, seeing a way to make things easier for himself, appoints his old friend Becket to the position.  However, once installed, Becket discovers his soul.  He becomes a rare example of a man who power does not corrupts but instead serves to purify.  As a leader, Becket discovers his lost integrity and tragically, this leads to his own martyrdom and later canonization.  Fittingly, this man redeemed by the church (and who would guess that this would be the premise of such a hilarious, entertaining, and downright fun film?) becomes patron saint of the clergy.That said, this isn't really a film about religion as much as its about friendship and the price one pays for taking a stand.  This is one of the best historical films I have ever seen and should be seen by anyone interested in either a good story or just some of the best acting ever put on screen.  There's something beautiful about a film that surprises you by defying your expectations and Becket is a great example of one of those films.",4,Good historical drama,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,2973,"['1964', 'film', 'deals', 'murder', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'old', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'famously', 'asked', 'quot', 'Who', 'will', 'rid', 'turbulent', 'priest', 'quot', 'been', 'matter', 'great', 'debate', 'Henry', 'actually', 'meant', 'order', 'murder', 'old', 'friend', 'least', 'film', 'almost', 'case', 'Henry', 'words', 'were', 'just', 'impulsive', 'possibly', 'drunken', 'words', 'rather', 'immature', 'man', 'thrust', 'heredity', 'position', 'power', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'for.One', 'might', 'think', 'political', 'murder', 'priest', 'pre-Reniassance', 'England', 'would', 'make', 'rather', 'dry', 'humorless', 'film', 'Luckily', 'Becket', 'wrong', 'Though', 'director', 'Peter', 'Glenville', 'was', 'not', 'flashy', 'stylist', 'occasionally', 'allow', 'film', 'become', 'bit', 'stagey', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'director', 'actors', 'manages', 'get', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'performances', 'young', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Henry', 'even', 'normally', 'diffident', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Becket', 'When', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'comedy', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Becket', 'Henry', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'spoiled', 'friends', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'drinking', 'wenching', 'Though', 'expected', ""O'Toole"", 'hilarious', 'fun-loving', 'monarch', 'even', 'Burton', 'few', 'slyly', 'sardonic', 'line', 'readings', 'Years', 'later', 'interview', 'David', 'Letterman', ""O'Toole"", 'would', 'admit', 'lead', 'actors', 'were', 'drunk', 'majority', 'shooting', 'basically', 'just', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'sense', 'fun', 'early', 'scenes', 'easily', 'translatable', 'audience', 'hard', 'not', 'two', 'immoral', 'rogues', 'perhaps', 'even', 'secretly', 'want', 'find', 'time', 'machine', 'go', 'hang', ""O'Toole"", 'Burton', 'were', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'mutual', 'affection', 'two', 'shared', 'especially', 'obvious', 'endearing', 'serves', 'make', 'film', 'later', 'events', 'more', 'tragic.The', 'film', 'serious', 'turn', 'when', 'previous', 'Archbishop', 'dies', 'Henry', 'seeing', 'way', 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'old', 'friend', 'Becket', 'position', 'However', 'once', 'installed', 'Becket', 'soul', 'rare', 'example', 'man', 'who', 'power', 'not', 'corrupts', 'instead', 'serves', 'purify', 'leader', 'Becket', 'lost', 'integrity', 'tragically', 'own', 'martyrdom', 'later', 'canonization', 'Fittingly', 'man', 'redeemed', 'church', 'who', 'would', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'premise', 'such', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', 'downright', 'fun', 'film', 'patron', 'saint', 'clergy.That', 'said', ""n't"", 'really', 'film', 'about', 'religion', 'as', 'much', 'friendship', 'price', 'one', 'pays', 'taking', 'stand', 'one', 'best', 'historical', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'interested', 'good', 'story', 'just', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'something', 'beautiful', 'film', 'defying', 'expectations', 'Becket', 'great', 'example', 'one', 'films']",N/A

The search for the resolution of that question, and how it was answered, makes ""Becket"" one of the best historical dramas ever made.  Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton are in top form as the young Henry II of England and his partner-in-mayhem Thomas Becket, whose primary interests are wine and women and not necessarily in that order.  England in the 12th century was devoutly Roman Catholic, and the Catholic hierarchy enjoyed a level of power and prestige equal to, if not higher than, the king himself.  But when the old archbishop dies and Henry needs to appoint a successor in his place, Henry outfoxes everyone by doing an end run around the bishops and naming Becket as the new archbishop.  The bishops are upset; they believe Henry intends for Becket to be a puppet figure to be used to further the king's own ends.  But to everyone's surprise, Becket takes his job more seriously than Henry ever intended.  No one could be more stunned and shocked at this development than Henry himself.The confrontation between Henry and the clergy is set immediately following the old archbishop's death, when Henry informs the assembled bishops that there will only be one head honcho in England, and that is the king.  The bishops are not used to having their power abrogated by anyone outside the church; they answer only to the pope and to God.  The king and clergy are on collision course, and Henry, to his chagrin, finds that Becket is solidly on the side of the Church his king has appointed him to represent.  There will be no compromise here.  The stage is thus set for a fateful confrontation.One has to wonder: when Henry blurted out his petulant rhetorical question ""Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?"", did he really not expect to be taken at his word?  He's made it clear over and over again that he is the king, and the king is the law.  So it's hard not to feel a sense of disgust at Henry's hypocrisy as he undergoes a ritual flogging in the cathedral crypt to expiate his guilt at having instigated Becket's murder, and immediately afterwards announces on the church steps that Becket will be venerated as a saint.  Power-hungry to the last, Henry has abrogated to himself the privilege of an announcement that should have come from the new archbishop, or from the pope who alone has the power of canonization.The film has everything going for it: a great plot, two excellent performances by Burton and O'Toole, terrific direction and cinematography, and fine historical accuracy.  The Gregorian chant running through the scenes in the cathedral transport the viewer 700 years back in time.  For two unforgettable hours, we're part of 12th century England.And finally, let me add my request to those of the other reviewers of this excellent movie: Will someone please hurry up and release this film on DVD?  I'll be first in line to buy it.This review is being UPDATED on 5/23/07 to add the following:Since I first reviewed this movie three years ago, my opinion of the acting, plot, characterization and script writing has not changed.  This is a magnificent film by any criteria.  I wish I say the same for the DVD.  The picture quality is terrific.  The sound quality, however, is not nearly as good, and for anyone who is hearing-impaired, a very serious problem is that this DVD is NOT closed captioned.  The audio track is in English, French and Spanish.  There are English subtitles for those who require them, but accessing them is tricky on some DVD players.It looks like whoever put this film on DVD was trying to cut corners.

For the person who does not know a great deal of history I believe they will be surprised to discover that a King of England would submit to being thrashed by a bunch of monks in penance for anything, including the murder of a priest.  Certainly the fact that the primary characters are based on real people might spark an interest, at least to go read a survey of the central characters' biographies.  Hollywood can do useful work in this regard in a culture where significant percentages of people cannot answer basic questions of historical fact.  The acting and the story line are compelling and the casting is superb.On the other side of the house, Henry II is depicted as being far too shallow and weak.  His angst is much more modern than actual and, then, Becket's transformation is depicted as far more spiritual than are the facts.  Becket never stopped being a politician though I believe that he certainly did undergo a fairly extensive ""rebirth"" upon entering the priesthood.

The basic plot: a young Henry II, in a political power play against the bishops of England, forces them to elect his lapdog Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury.  Slowly but surely, Becket develops genuine faith, and can no longer blindly support the king.  This film comes very close to matching the quality of ""Lion;"" you can just feel the contempt O'Toole displays toward his wife and children, and the pain he experiences at Becket's so-called betrayal.  Burton is equally good at playing the selfish rogue whose conscience gnaws at him, until he can resist it no longer.A/V quality is not quite on the level of, say,Lawrence of Arabia (Restored Version) [Blu-ray] orCleopatra (50th Anniversary 2-Disc Edition) [Blu-ray] (which O'Toole and Burton also give strong performances in, respectively), but still very good.

177809,A1VF0102Z9VITO,1556072821,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Becket tells the story of St. Thomas Becket and King Henry II of England. Becket, at the beginning of the story, is a close friend of the king, though they are more like drinking/wenching/carousing buddies than lordly nobility. To be sure, the king does the work of running the kingdom, which includes reclaiming some of Normandy from French rule. Henry is the great grandson of William the Conqueror, who united England under Norman rule in the late 1000s. Becket, by contrast, is a Saxon, one of the conquered people. He has risen up to a level of influence by his quick wits and his few scruples. He has not found an honor worth fighting for and so lives a profligate life. The king admires his intelligence quite a bit and decides to make him Chancellor of England. Becket accepts the role and aids in both raising money for the French campaign and conquering Normandy with as little bloodshed as possible.Part of raising money is collecting taxes from church properties. When the king consults the bishops, they refuse to pay based on exemptions from William the Conqueror. The king is adamant and Becket, seeing the power play between them, argues for the king. Becket and the king realize that the church is a significant power in England and could be a threat to royal authority. As they fight in France, word comes that the archbishop of Canterbury, the highest prelate in England, has died. The king sees his opportunity to control the church. He makes Becket the new archbishop. Becket is quite reluctant but obeys the king. After becoming archbishop, Becket discovers the honor that he has been lacking and defends the rights of the church against the king. Best friends become intense rivals.The movie is a fascinating portrayal of the two characters, though clearly Peter O'Toole, who plays the king, delivers the more dynamic performance. Richard Burton plays Becket as a clever but reserved fellow. His transition from profligate playboy to stalwart defender of the church is believable, but his performance is a bit too austere and solemn. Some of the ceremonial scenes, like when Becket is ordained, take longer than modern audiences would be patient for. The production values are very high. The story is the best part.

As parts seem surprisingly risqu&eacute; for 1964, I'm assuming that some originally deleted material has been re-inserted.  While there is no question as to the principal character's saintliness, the film raised a few questions in my mind about its historical accuracy.As per the film review of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ""Becket"" is ""The 12th-century saga...of the deep friendship and later conflict between England's King Henry II...and his friend, Sir Thomas a Becket..., and how their days of drinking and womanizing came to an end when the monarch decided to appoint Becket archbishop of Canterbury.  Much to Henry's surprise, Becket was transformed into a deeply spiritual man of God, who took his new responsibilities very seriously....The film charts how Becket went head-to-head with the king over the vigilante murder of an erring priest by one of Henry's knights. Henry's famous despairing cry, `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?' -- leads to Becket's martyrdom in his cathedral.""  Amazingly, the USCCB also reports that the film is completely in error over Becket's ethnicity - a central concern of the movie!While the Catholic Encyclopedia agrees on much of the details, there are several noteworthy differences:* The Catholic Encyclopedia seems to indicate that Thomas' conversion was somewhat less dramatic, and that his pre-archbishop years were chaste (or at least more so than what the movie indicates).* The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions nothing about the unnamed priest's alleged crime.  Yet, it does indicate that Thomas strongly opposed Henry's effort ""to bring clerics guilty of crimes under the jurisdiction of the secular courts.""  Looking back over the scandals of the past few years, one result seems that - in our own time - the secular world is again exercising too much jurisdiction over clerics (My own opinion, of course).* The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions nothing about Henry's famous line.  It also indicates that Henry's culpability for Thomas' murder is not clear.While some seem to suggest that Mother Theresa & Pope John Paul II may be on ""fast tracks,"" the Catholic Encyclopedia confirms that ""The pope promulgated the bull of canonization, little more than two years after the martyrdom, 21 February, 1173.""",3,Saint Thomas a Becket,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,2328,"['Re-released', '2007', '1964', 'Becket', 'parts', 'seem', 'surprisingly', 'risqu', 'eacute', '1964', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'originally', 'deleted', 'material', 'been', 're-inserted', 'question', 'principal', 'character', 'saintliness', 'film', 'raised', 'few', 'questions', 'mind', 'historical', 'accuracy.As', 'film', 'review', 'United', 'States', 'Conference', 'Catholic', 'Bishops', 'Becket', '12th-century', 'saga', 'deep', 'friendship', 'later', 'conflict', 'England', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'friend', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'how', 'days', 'drinking', 'womanizing', 'came', 'end', 'when', 'monarch', 'decided', 'appoint', 'Becket', 'archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Much', 'Henry', 'surprise', 'Becket', 'was', 'transformed', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'man', 'God', 'who', 'took', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'very', 'seriously', '.The', 'film', 'how', 'Becket', 'went', 'head-to-head', 'king', 'vigilante', 'murder', 'erring', 'priest', 'one', 'Henry', 'knights', 'Henry', 'famous', 'despairing', 'cry', 'Will', 'one', 'rid', 'meddlesome', 'priest', 'Becket', 'martyrdom', 'cathedral', 'Amazingly', 'USCCB', 'also', 'film', 'completely', 'error', 'Becket', 'ethnicity', 'central', 'concern', 'movie', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'much', 'details', 'are', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'differences', '*', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'indicate', 'Thomas', 'conversion', 'was', 'somewhat', 'less', 'dramatic', 'pre-archbishop', 'years', 'were', 'chaste', 'least', 'more', 'so', 'what', 'movie', '*', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'mentions', 'nothing', 'unnamed', 'priest', 'alleged', 'crime', 'indicate', 'Thomas', 'strongly', 'opposed', 'Henry', 'effort', 'bring', 'clerics', 'guilty', 'crimes', 'jurisdiction', 'secular', 'courts', 'Looking', 'back', 'scandals', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'result', 'own', 'time', 'secular', 'world', 'again', 'exercising', 'too', 'much', 'jurisdiction', 'clerics', 'own', 'opinion', 'course', '*', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'mentions', 'nothing', 'Henry', 'famous', 'line', 'also', 'Henry', 'culpability', 'Thomas', 'murder', 'not', 'clear.While', 'seem', 'suggest', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'may', 'be', 'fast', 'tracks', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'pope', 'promulgated', 'bull', 'canonization', 'little', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'martyrdom', '21', 'February', '1173']",N/A

Fueled by two powerful performances that drive the entire film, that of Peter O'Toole as Henry II and that of Richard Burton as Thomas Becket, this history based drama explains the conflict that caused the assassinatiom and subsequent canonization of Becket.Henry II, England's twelfth century Norman King, elevated Thomas Becket, a commoner and Saxon peasant, to the lofty position of Chancellor of England. Famous friends, they drank, caroused and wenched together. All was well between them until Henry takes it into his head to appoint Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury, the most powerful cleric in England, though Becket begs his friend not to do this. Ignoring the heartfelt plea of his friend, he makes it so, under the belief that this would indirectly bring the Catholic Church of England under his dominion and control.Simultaneously both Archbishop and Chancellor, Becket became the most powerful man, secularly and religiously, in England with one fell swoop. This political move by Henry did not work out as he had envisioned, however, as Becket found himself in the position of being able only to render to the King that which was the King's and to God that which was God's. Becket took his position of Archbishop of Canterbury very seriously and was uncompromising in his view, a devotion to God that Henry had not bargained on. This created conflict between Becket and Henry. The friendship and love that had existed between them for so long, now quickly turned to bitter hate on Henry's part for what he perceived to be a betrayal of that friendship. For the first time in his life, Henry had a rival with whom he could not compete: God.This was to lead to a battle of wills between the two that would culminate in a tragedy that would become memorialized for all time. This film attempts to capture the events that led up to Becket's eventual martyrdom. It succeeds masterfully. A somewhat hammy Peter O'Toole is terrific as the selfish King Henry II. A more restrained Richard Burton is compelling as the troubled and angst ridden Becket, who ultimately chooses his devotion to God over the dictates of his King and friend. This is a beautifully filmed and superlative historical drama with wonderful performances contributed by the supporting cast. Though somewhat stagey at times, it does not fail to fully engage the viewer.

The two men are a high-energy rowdy pair, given to drinking, womanizing and high adventure.But things change when the King promotes Becket to the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

I enjoyed watching this DVD, but the screenplay, based on the stage play, is truly dated and inaccurate in many respects. Like all human beings, Thomas Becket was flawed in many ways, among them in his arrogance and tactlessness. He invited his own murder, and it is puzzling that such a consummate diplomat would forget all of his considerable negotiation skills as archbishop. Filmmakers would repeat this mistake a few years later, with Thomas More, in A Man For All Seasons.The portrayal of Queen Eleanor is absurd - she was a powerful woman, many generations ahead of her time, not the shrew seen here. The same can be said of the character of Queen Matilda. While the production values, most notably the sets, though thoroughly 1960's, are quite good, the music is cloying and repetitive.On the positive side, the performances of O'Toole and Burton, especially dealing with what they were given, are superb.

Excellent historical movie about Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury who defied Henry II, King of England and got murdered for it. The film starred Richard Burton as Becket and Peter O'Toole as ""his King"", both at their prime. Two superb actors going at it make this movie utterly interesting to watch.The DVD proves to be well presented. The colors are sharp and vivid, images are clean and clear and sound proves to be just perfect. I am not sure about the comments made by one previous reviewer but I had no problem with the sound on my sound system. The extra features were pretty nice but the crown jewel of this DVD would have to be the running commentary provided by Peter O'Toole as he talked about the film. His words proves to be highly interesting and entertaining with few breaks in between.For the historical minded, I thought the movie captured the spirit and conflict between these two men pretty well. In the film, Becket was portaryed as a ""Saxon"" but history tell us that he was Norman by birth. History also tell us that he was recommended as Chancellor by the Archbishop of Canterbury Theobald to Henry II as well. So the movie played loose with real history but the characters of the both personalities I thought, was well captured. And this is a movie about character study more then history study.The movie come well recommended, there isn't much bloodshed here, very little action scenes but the dialogues are sharp, script superbly written and acting is some of the best ever seen.

They do everything together, drinking, womanizing, hunting, etc.) Thomas has a sharp and sly wit the king admires. Whatever the situation, he always gives Henry something to ponder. Henry sees something in Thomas that's sorely missing in the rest of his suck-ups so he appoints him as Lord Chancellor.Yet, in spite of Thomas' immoral lifestyle, he has a clean conscience. Although he is the king's sidekick, he hates to see his Saxon race oppressed by the Norman nobility. He also hates needless war and bloodshed. When he and Henry are out hunting they barge into a hut and find an old man and his daughter. Henry wants to take the girl as a concubine but Thomas desperately tries to save her by begging the king to give her to him instead. The king agrees. Thomas tells the father to take heart--he will send her home as soon as possible, undefiled.Henry is so pleased with Thomas' accomplishments that when the old Archbishop of Canterbury dies, he appoints Thomas to take his place. Thomas reluctantly agrees but gives Henry a fair warning--there may come a day when Henry will regret his decision. Thomas becomes serious about his new commitment to God and the church and Henry is furious because he can no longer use him as a mindless puppet. I won't spoil the story anymore. If you've read your history you know what happens in the end.I wish Becket had won the major academy awards of 1964 (Picture, Director and Leading Actor) instead of My Fair Lady because it put a bigger impression on me. MFL has its fans (and I don't look down on them because quality is subjective) but I've never one of them. The outside scenes are clearly not outside, none of the songs besides ""I could have danced all night"" really grabbed me, the move goes on and on, Rex Harrison starts out all right as the cynical smart-alleck speech therapist but gets supremely annoying after two and a half hours of ceaseless monologues and Audrey Hepburn's two note performance grates on my nerves because it lacks subtlety and shading--she is either black or white, street vendor or refined, educated accomplished lady--it's like a light turned on and off.In Becket, the costumes and sets look more gritty and realistic (those church scenes were absolutely breathtaking) the cinematography is drop dead gorgeous (rich shades of sepia, brown, gray and green) the screenplay is constantly crackling with wit and rolls off the tongue like poetry, the two leads play off each other perfectly and the supporting cast adds some fine color.Awards are often given due to mood swings of the public and the judges so I suppose My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins won eight and five (whereas Becket only won one) was because this was the year right after the great American tragedy of 1963 (I think you know what I'm referring to) so the judges preferred giving more honors to more cheerful, up-beat, escapism movies.Richard Burton gives a magnificent, low-key but never wooden performance as the stoic Thomas who gradually transforms from a libertine to a saint. His rich creamy voice is always a pleasure to the ears. Every sentence he utters sounds like it should be etched in marble. Peter O'Toole is also brilliant in a more showy turn as the hysterical, woman-crazed, psychologically teetering Henry. His hammy style is a perfect 180 degree opposite to Burton's more cerebral character.Probably their finest moments are:1. When Henry asks Gwendolyn (Thomas' mistress) to play for him and Thomas. He sits next to her while Thomas stands from a distance with a rather cross expression on his face. ""You know what Thomas?"" says Henry ""Sometimes I think we are the only two civilized men in England and you've made me into a man of the most delicate sensibilities. Now, if you truly love me, you should find me (puts his arms around her and gets a truly diabolical, wolfish and savage look on his face) a beautiful and well-bred girl to give me a little polish.""2. When Henry announces his plans to make Thomas the next Archbishop. Thomas looks Henry straight in the face and says with a cold, dead serious tone ""I beg of you--DO NOT DO THIS.""3. Thomas' prayer in the middle of the film when he is an archbishop while Brother John is listening in. The urgent, serious look on his face says it all.4. Right before the excommunication scene. ""Gentlemen, it is a supreme irony that the worldly Becket---the profligate and libertine--should find himself standing here at this moment. Yet here he is, in spite of himself. But the king for good or ill passed the burden of the church onto me and now I must carry it. I've rolled up my sleeves and taken the church on my back. Nothing will ever make me set it down.""5. Henry contorting his face, gagging, trembling and groveling on the floor at the climatic dinner scene a la Gollum with the elven rope around his neck in The Lord of the Rings. That part was so hard to watch. I know Henry is a bad bad man but at that moment, I felt so sorry for him because he asked his barons if anyone would rid him of `that meddlesome priest' and little does he know he'll have to live with that for the rest of his life. It takes an extremely talented actor to make the audience feel sorry for an unlikeable character and Peter O'Toole NAILED that.6. The end of the film when Thomas is performing his last church service. Brother Phillip informs him that some soldiers are banging on the doors. Thomas says to open them. ""I've never heard of bolting the doors during vespers. Everything must done as was prepared."" The look on his face and the resonance in his voice says it all--he knows his time has come.It doesn't surprise me why neither Richard Burton nor Peter O'Toole won the academy award for best leading actor. They both deserved it and it would have been a crime to award one and ignore the other so the judges decided to just cancel them out.The rest of the cast delivers on all levels. Donald Wolfit as Folliot, the bishop who compromises everything to save his skin, Pamela Brown, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the sad, bitter queen of England who tries to resist the evil nature of her husband, John Gielgud as the smooth-talking King Louie of France, David Weston as Brother John, a monk who starts out as an enemy of Thomas but later on becomes his closest friend when Henry casts him off, Sian Phillips, (who looks and sounds quite a bit like Cate Blanchett) the beautiful Gwendolyn who's love for Thomas was doomed from the start etc.)Peter Glenville's stagey direction is superb. He brings out the best in every actor and glides smoothly from setting to setting. Probably his best moments were:1.) The noisy, drunken, savage court of Henry. One of the barons throws a handful of food at another. The other baron grabs his prong and sticks him in the rump. They both get into a big fight on the dinner table. Thomas stops them and then retires to get away from the noise and confusion. He goes upstairs where it is very quiet, serene and peaceful. You can feel the 'shift.' Gwendolyn is singing and playing the lute. He complements her, throws himself on the bed and mutters ""Noisy brutes.""2.) The eeriness and dramatic flourish of the excommunication and murder scenes. There is plenty of suspense and fear leading up to the climaxes.Laurence Rosenthal gives a radiant, regal and majestic score that contains plainchant melodies and plenty of rich, warm orchestrations. Probably the finest highlights were Gwendolyn's theme and the hunting party.The only nitpicks I have are:1. The scene with the French prostitute could have been cut out. We already know the king is a rake from the beginning flashback scenes with the two peasant girls and when he demands Thomas give up Gwendolyn. We don't need to beat over the head with it.2. The monks in a cluster when Thomas is killed. It puzzles me that they didn't try to overwhelm and stop the barons because there were only four barons and about twenty monks. Only Brother John has the guts to give his all in all for his master.However these are just little nitpicks in a otherwise, five star movie. Highly recommended. Good for discussions.",5,"""Is the honor of God washed clean enough?""",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,8622,"['Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'Picture', 'Director-Peter', 'Glenville', 'Leading',

Peter O'Toole has working for so long that it's easy to forget that he once cut a striking young figure.  And what an actor!  He's a rougish Henry II, a clever Norman who finds himself king of England in battle with the Church in the 12th century.  His right hand man (and best pal) is local turncoat Saxon Thomas Becket played by Richard Burton.  Beckett is somewhat expedient (in the worst sense of the word), clever and a good friend of the obnoxious-yet-entertaining king.  The two are bound by tomfoolery and Henry loves Beckett, trusts his counsel and makes him Chancellor of England in the face of opposition from both the barons and the Church.  Yet sometimes Thomas quietly intervenes on behalf of his countrymen.  Simultaneously as a member of Henry's court he seems to bear a sense of guilt.  ""Somehow I can never sport the idea of being loved.""Becket is about honor, the honor of perhaps a previous age, but honor nonetheless.  Becket's surrender of his woman is terrible, but it comes from his understanding of honor.  And when Henry installs his friend Becket as Archbishop, it's with the understanding that Becket's expediency will inform his churchly function.  Little could have Henry predicted - in spite of the recognition that his friend was a bit enigmatic - that Becket would take his office seriously.  This is also a love story of a sort; the love of a king for his friend, the love of a new believer for an ideal, the sweetness and bitterness of loneliness.  The scenes in which Becket submits himself to God and Henry submits to the loss of his friend are exquisite.  If ""God"" is not your thing, substitute ""wisdom,"" ""truth,"" or ""enlightenment"" and take Becket's prayer in that light.  Enjoy the film, the tension, and the tragedy of honor tensioned against friendship, ""aesthetics"" against ""morality,"" and a more exalted expediency born from someplace within.Some people may be put off by some of the cinematic techniques of the '60s (e.g. instant, obviously artificial rain during the hunt scene), but for me these things merely mark the time during which the film was made.  On the plus side, another mark of this film's era is the exquisitely crafted dialogue.  This stuff is spoken poetry, incomparably performed by some of the best actors of the 20th century.  There are certain handsome themes in the film; Henry's constant feelings of cold in the land he rules yet is not a part of, and Thomas' comfort in the same land which is his own.Did I mention Peter O'Toole was fantastic?  And Richard Burton's voice is like buttery dark silk.

Well, just in case:SPOILER ALERTI had long looked forward to watching ""Becket."" It did not commit the unforgivable sin of being boring. There were things I liked about it. But I cannot say I liked it. So three stars.The movie goes over the long friendship between English King Henry II and Thomas Becket. They carouse and chase women through the countryside. Henry names the pragmatic, strategic, loyal and apparently secular Becket as his Chancellor. Hoping to have more control over the enormously powerful Catholic church, Henry gets Becket ordained and appoints him as Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Church in England. To Henry's chagrin, instead of docilely complying with Henry's wishes, Becket truly gets religion, gives all his worldly goods to the poor, and insists on the primacy of the Church in church-related matters. Henry, enraged at Becket's betrayals, asks his barons, ""Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" The barons assassinate Becket on the altar of Canterbury Cathedral. The contrite Henry submits himself to flogging, then exits the cathedral and announces that he has asked the Pope to venerate Becket as a saint.Do NOT watch Becket looking for accurate history. While historical records from the 12th century are not entirely consistent, the movie is based on a French play authored by a man who acknowledged the inaccuracies but decided that correcting them would undermine his themes. In the movie, Becket represents the Saxon people in England, who are said to have been oppressed by the Normans (including Henry II) since the invasion of William the Conqueror. Becket was in reality Norman. Henry II is portrayed as a crude, perpetually petulant, drunken, irresponsible adolescent, when in fact he was a powerful, competent --if sometimes mercurial-- ruler of a vast realm, unusually well-read for his time, whose reforms underlay the English common law as we know it today. The movie suggests that Henry's frustration at his thwarted homosexual love for Becket inflamed his feelings of resentment at Becket's betrayals--really? Do tell! And the movie portrays Henry's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, as an empty-headed harridan, when in fact she was one of the most accomplished, powerful women of her day.I can't recall another movie in which women come off as badly as they do in ""Becket."" Henry's highly accomplished mother (Empress Matilda) and wife are reduced to unattractive whining nags. Other female characters are whores. Henry rants and rages about how much he hates women.Those things being said, ""Becket"" still manages to be a well-made, entertaining film. The director carried over from the English-language performance of the play and manages to open out the movie from the stage quite effectively. You'll find plenty of sharp dialogue, lively camera work, reasonably brisk pacing, and impressive sets and costumes. Peter O'Toole, playing Henry II VERY differently than in the later ""The Lion in Winter,"" gives a vibrant, unreserved performance as the obnoxious king. I have to see a better Richard Burton movie though. It's partly Becket's reserved character, but as with other movies I've seen him in, Burton seems slightly uncomfortable on screen, as though his underwear were a couple of sizes too small. I know his performance in ""Becket"" was widely admired, but I didn't love it.I do like that ""Becket"" dares to raise and explore some big questions.

177837,AHN34TYB15NWF,1556072821,"! Metamorpho ;) ""Reflective and Wiser Seer""","[0, 1]","""Becket"" is a glorious movie and one which provides high interest in England's primeval past. Based upon a play by Jean Anouilh, the prime action centers around the power struggle between King Henry the II (played by Peter O'Toole) and Becket, who becomes The Archbishop of Canterbury (played by Richard Burton).  Set in the 1100s, we get a rare glimpse into that day and age. However, hatred is not at the center which propels this tale - but love.Henry is base and crass, while Becket is learned and refined. They start off as best friends, roaming the countryside in search of more mayhem and debauchery, but soon fate and ego come in from stage left. To save an innocent girl from Henry's clutches, Becket innocently enters into a deal with the King. Little does he know it will cost him the only thing he loves in his life.From this point on, the psychological underpinnings weave a treacherous web. Henry loves Becket, and probably knows he is not his equal, thus he begins a tireless campaign to use his royal advantage to make Becket feel the same way he does. But, Becket has a higher purpose and, unfortunately, the damage has been done.Henry attempts to weaken the power of the Church of England by promoting Becket to Archbishop, thinking that by instilling an ally in that position he will have total control of England. But Becket, reluctant at first, takes the position in great earnest, and becomes a full-fledged man of God.At this time, the church had the dominant say over many countries, and was a major force to be reckoned with. Henry wanted the right to put on trial religious clerics in civil court, but Becket held firm that it was the church's jurisdiction only. When Henry passes off a light sentence to a member of his court that murdered a clergyman, Becket uses the power of excommunication. This infuriates Henry and he fakes charges in order to prosecute Becket. Seeing the writing on the parchment, Becket flees to France and is given asylum by King Louis the VIIth (played brilliantly by Sir John Gielgud).After meeting with the Pope, and arranging to come back to England, things never get set right with this debacle. In an off-the-cuff, exasperating declaration by Henry, Becket's sad fate is revealed.In summation, ""Becket"" is an extraordinary visual experience. You can see the precision of acting excellence in both O'Toole and Burton. You will be riveted by the performance as they display the depth and range of each character; Henry's erratic and egotistical emotions balanced against Becket's single minded devotion. But, we wind up asking is it towards God, or himself? This is only a piece of the larger puzzle which you'll find in ""Becket"".In closing, Jean Anouilh took some liberties with his play, and there are historical inaccuracies. However, this remains a stimulating character study in an absorbing time in England's history. It begs further investigation and it is well worth the effort. If anything, it proves that the complexity of human relationships remain just as strong now as it did almost 900 years ago. And with actors like these, it is well worth your time.Highly Recommended!Forsooth! -------- Metamorpho ;)",5,"""Will No One Rid Me of this Troublesome Priest""?",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3174,"['Becket', 'glorious', 'movie', 'one', 'high', 'interest', 'England', 'primeval', 'past', 'Based', 'play', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'prime', 'action', 'centers', 'power', 'struggle', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Becket', 'who', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'played', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Set', '1100s', 'get', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'day', 'age', 'However', 'hatred', 'not', 'center', 'tale', 'love.Henry', 'base', 'crass', 'Becket', 'learned', 'refined', 'start', 'off', 'as', 'best', 'friends', 'roaming', 'countryside', 'search', 'more', 'mayhem', 'debauchery', 'soon', 'fate', 'ego', 'come', 'stage', 'left', 'save', 'innocent', 'girl', 'Henry', 'clutches', 'Becket', 'innocently', 'deal', 'King', 'Little', 'know', 'will', 'cost', 'only', 'thing', 'life.From', 'point', 'psychological', 'underpinnings', 'weave', 'treacherous', 'web', 'Henry', 'Becket', 'probably', 'knows', 'not', 'equal', 'thus', 'tireless', 'campaign', 'use', 'royal', 'advantage', 'make', 'Becket', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Becket', 'higher', 'purpose', 'unfortunately', 'damage', 'been', 'done.Henry', 'attempts', 'weaken', 'power', 'Church', 'England', 'promoting', 'Becket', 'Archbishop', 'thinking', 'instilling', 'ally', 'position', 'will', 'have', 'total', 'control', 'England', 'Becket', 'reluctant', 'first', 'position', 'great', 'earnest', 'full-fledged', 'man', 'God.At', 'time', 'church', 'had', 'dominant', 'say', 'many', 'countries', 'was', 'major', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Henry', 'wanted', 'right', 'put', 'trial', 'religious', 'clerics', 'civil', 'court', 'Becket', 'held', 'firm', 'was', 'church', 'jurisdiction', 'only', 'When', 'Henry', 'light', 'sentence', 'member', 'court', 'murdered', 'clergyman', 'Becket', 'power', 'excommunication', 'Henry', 'charges', 'order', 'prosecute', 'Becket', 'Seeing', 'writing', 'parchment', 'Becket', 'France', 'given', 'asylum', 'King', 'Louis', 'VIIth', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', '.After', 'meeting', 'Pope', 'arranging', 'come', 'back', 'England', 'things', 'never', 'get', 'set', 'right', 'debacle', 'off-the-cuff', 'exasperating', 'declaration', 'Henry', 'Becket', 'sad', 'fate', 'revealed.In', 'summation', 'Becket', 'extraordinary', 'visual', 'experience', 'can', 'see', 'precision', 'acting', 'excellence', ""O'Toole"", 'Burton', 'will', 'be', 'riveted', 'performance', 'display', 'depth', 'range', 'character', 'Henry', 'erratic', 'egotistical', 'emotions', 'balanced', 'Becket', 'single', 'minded', 'devotion', 'wind', 'up', 'asking', 'God', 'only', 'piece', 'larger', 'puzzle', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Becket', '.In', 'closing', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'took', 'liberties', 'play', 'are', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'However', 'stimulating', 'character', 'study', 'absorbing', 'time', 'England', 'history', 'further', 'investigation', 'well', 'effort', 'anything', 'complexity', 'human', 'relationships', 'remain', 'just', 'strong', 'now', 'did', 'almost', '900', 'years', 'ago', 'actors', 'well', 'worth', 'time.Highly', 'Recommended', 'Forsooth', 'Metamorpho']",N/A

IT was not a big budget movie in the least to begin with. It looks like a big budget movie but it's not, as it was not shot by the major studios anyways. It looks truly rstored here , and that's a good thing. The movie itself came from a play about Thomas Becket and King Henry 2 of England. It is a true story and a remarkable one. Peter O toole was to play King Henry again in the classic film  'the lion in winter' as well. This movie does it all right and is a five star movie for most critics who ever saw it. And that's on a scale of classic movies. The acting from everyone in here is first rate and noteworthy. Richard burtons finest performance is in this movie , and he was a great actor by any standard.

The movie is engaging and the sets are often real cathedrals or historic buildings for the larger shots. But not all.

177840,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,1556072821,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[256, 266]","&quot;Becket.&quot;  Now THERE is a marvelous movie... probably one of the finest &quot;biopics&quot; ever written!!  It tells the story of the relationship between two men: King Henry II of England, great-grandson to William the Conqueror, and Thomas Becket, a Saxon nobleman, a close friend of King Henry's, and, ultimately, Archbishop of Canterbury.As our story unfolds, Henry and Becket are inseparable friends. They spend their days feasting at banquets, carousing, wenching, and hunting. Henry (played by Peter O'Toole) appoints Becket (Richard Burton) to the post of Chancellor of England - the equivalent of Prime Minister and Treasurer. Becket is a man completely loyal to the King, and a man with a curious sense of honor. &quot;Honor is a private matter within,&quot; he tells Henry early in the film. &quot;It's an idea, and every man has his own version of it.&quot;&quot;Becket&quot; is ultimately a story of &quot;the honor of God&quot; versus &quot;I am your king.&quot; In an effort to gain the upper hand in the ongoing controversy between the Church and state, Henry names Becket to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury. In Thomas Becket, the King sees a loyal servant who will place the wishes of his monarch before everything else. Unfortunately, the King's hopes for an easy time of it are soon dashed.  After becoming the primate of England, Becket  rediscovers his personal sense of honor. To Becket, &quot;the honor of God&quot; becomes worthy of defending against all who would attack the Church... even if the attacker is the King.  When one of Henry's noblemen kills a priest, Becket orders him haled before an ecclesiastical court. The inevitable showdown between King and Archbishop is at hand.Despite the King's insistence, he refuses to budge from his position that the church courts have jurisdiction in this and all similar cases. His continuing defiance of the King sends Henry into increasingly virulent paroxysms of rage against his former friend. &quot;I am your king!&quot; he repeatedly tells Becket.Ultimately, Becket is forced to flee England, but returns after seven years, having agreed to a series of compromises with the King, but not conceding the main points of his argument. The truce is short lived, however. Becket continues to resist Henry's efforts to intrude into Church affairs. Henry, enraged once again, fills the air with oaths against his new-found foe, asking at one point: &quot;Will no-one rid me of this meddlesome priest?&quot; On December 29, 1170, four of his barons assassinate Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the altar of Canterbury Cathedral.&quot;Becket&quot;  is based on the stage play of the same name by French playwright Jean Anouilh, and adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt (who won the 1964 &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; Academy Award for his efforts). It was also nominated for 11 other Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor.This is one of those movies where words can't really convey the depth and quality of the performances turned in by its stars. It's rare to find a film with one performance of such great magnitude; I don't ever recall seeing two such brilliant performances in one movie! For Burton and O'Toole are so very good in their roles as Becket and Henry, that they seem almost to become the very characters they're playing. Their acting is refined, unaffected, completely without ego, almost effortless.&quot;Becket&quot;  is one of those good old-fashioned movies so popular forty years ago... the kind with world-class actors delivering lines from a superb screenplay; with an interesting subject at its heart; sumptuous sets; and colorful costumes. Maybe the film doesn't quite match the tastes of today's moviegoers as well as it did 37 years ago; but, if you're looking for some first-rate entertainment by the best actors in the business, &quot;Becket&quot; is indeed an excellent choice!",5,&quot;The honor of God&quot;,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,3910,"['quot', 'Becket.', 'quot', 'Now', 'marvelous', 'movie', 'probably', 'one', 'finest', 'quot', 'biopics', 'quot', 'ever', 'written', 'story', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'England', 'great-grandson', 'William', 'Conqueror', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'Saxon', 'nobleman', 'close', 'friend', 'King', 'Henry', 'ultimately', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Henry', 'Becket', 'are', 'inseparable', 'friends', 'spend', 'days', 'feasting', 'banquets', 'carousing', 'wenching', 'hunting', 'Henry', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Becket', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'post', 'Chancellor', 'England', 'equivalent', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Treasurer', 'Becket', 'man', 'completely', 'loyal', 'King', 'man', 'curious', 'sense', 'honor', 'quot', 'Honor', 'private', 'matter', 'quot', 'Henry', 'early', 'film', 'quot', 'idea', 'man', 'own', 'version', 'it.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Becket', 'quot', 'ultimately', 'story', 'quot', 'honor', 'God', 'quot', 'versus', 'quot', 'am', 'king.', 'quot', 'effort', 'gain', 'upper', 'hand', 'ongoing', 'controversy', 'Church', 'state', 'Henry', 'Becket', 'post', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'King', 'loyal', 'servant', 'who', 'will', 'place', 'wishes', 'monarch', 'everything', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'King', 'hopes', 'easy', 'time', 'are', 'soon', 'dashed', 'becoming', 'primate', 'England', 'Becket', 'personal', 'sense', 'honor', 'Becket', 'quot', 'honor', 'God', 'quot', 'worthy', 'defending', 'who', 'would', 'attack', 'Church', 'even', 'attacker', 'King', 'When', 'one', 'Henry', 'noblemen', 'priest', 'Becket', 'orders', 'haled', 'ecclesiastical', 'court', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'King', 'Archbishop', 'King', 'insistence', 'budge', 'position', 'church', 'courts', 'have', 'jurisdiction', 'similar', 'cases', 'continuing', 'defiance', 'King', 'Henry', 'increasingly', 'virulent', 'paroxysms', 'rage', 'former', 'friend', 'quot', 'am', 'king', 'quot', 'repeatedly', 'Becket.Ultimately', 'Becket', 'forced', 'flee', 'England', 'returns', 'seven', 'years', 'having', 'agreed', 'series', 'compromises', 'King', 'not', 'conceding', 'main', 'points', 'argument', 'truce', 'short', 'lived', 'however', 'Becket', 'resist', 'Henry', 'efforts', 'intrude', 'Church', 'affairs', 'Henry', 'enraged', 'once', 'again', 'air', 'oaths', 'new-found', 'foe', 'asking', 'one', 'point', 'quot', 'Will', 'no-one', 'rid', 'meddlesome', 'priest', 'quot', 'December', '29', '1170', 'four', 'barons', 'assassinate', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'altar', 'Canterbury', 'Cathedral.', 'quot', 'Becket', 'quot', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'French', 'playwright', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Edward', 'Anhalt', 'who', 'won', '1964', 'quot', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'quot', 'Academy', 'Award', 'efforts', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', '11', 'other', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor.This', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'convey', 'depth', 'quality', 'performances', 'turned', 'stars', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'one', 'performance', 'such', 'great', 'magnitude', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'recall', 'seeing', 'two', 'such', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'one', 'movie', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'are', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'Becket', 'Henry', 'seem', 'almost', 'become', 'very', 'characters', ""'re"", 'playing', 'acting', 'refined', 'unaffected', 'completely', 'ego', 'almost', 'effortless.', 'quot', 'Becket', 'quot', 'one', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'movies', 'popular', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'kind', 'world-class', 'actors', 'delivering', 'lines', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'interesting', 'subject', 'heart', 'sumptuous', 'sets', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'Maybe', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'tastes', 'today', 'moviegoers', 'as', 'well', 'did', '37', 'years', 'ago', ""'re"", 'looking', 'first-rate', 'entertainment', 'best', 'actors', 'business', 'quot', 'Becket', 'quot', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'choice']",N/A

How wise.There are too many awards and rewards out there and too little true talent that deserves them.But that's the world of business, not that of creative minds.So, in conclusion, buy the videotape (it's well worth it, although I would wait for the DVD release anyway, otherwise you may spend twice the money) or, if you still own a LD player, try to get hold of the LaserDisc. The image resolution is sharper, although the sound is still a miserable and conventional Mono.I hope that in some way, whenever, whomever will be so generous as to release a DVD version of it, may also want to clean it up somewhat and perhaps remaster the sound and the picture quality.I know perfectly well, that some movies were simply produced in Mono. Sometimes to spare money and sometimes, plainly because the director wanted so. But hey, we're living in the 21st Century now, not in the 1960's, so why wouldn't even purists see how far better a stereo sound is?I mix my own sounds and I can produce a perfect balanced and round stereo sound out of any monaural record I possess. It's no big deal, but some people think it is costly. Wrong!The only cost is in time, not money. Even a kid could do it...Becket, as said, is monaural and so are still many recent other DVD releases, from John Wayne Movies to early James Bond flicks and many others still.I wonder if the studios have become purists, or simply plain lazy. With all the money people pay yearly, to go to the movies, buy DVDs, CD Soundtracks and various memorabilia, it is amazing to me that the studios haven't got the finances to improve their products and instead keep on producing dozens of other, new and rather stupid (see deja vu) movies each year.Becket may not be a masterpiece like Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, but it is certainly not as utterly stupid as Dumb and Dumber and absolutely not as boring and wasteful as Pearl Harbor.But again, hey, who am I to criticize?I am just a voice in the desert.A nobody, who buys DVDs instead of going to the movies.Yet, I am also a stage director and an actor and know when the acting is good and performances are at their peak.So take it from me. If you have the money to spare, buy the tape, waiting for the DVD to pop up. If not and you can wait so long, buy the DVD the day it appears on the horizon, but if it doesn't, you would have missed some piece of acting here.You will never regret it...",5,Excellent rendition of Murder in the Cathedral...,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,4022,"['can', 'only', 'speak', 'LaserDisc', 'edition', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'Widescreen', 'version', 'such', 'masterpiece.Richard', 'Burton', 'Becket', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Henry', 'II', 'Plantagenet', 'role', 'would', 'reprise', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'quot', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'quot', 'masterpiece', 'deliver', 'vivid', 'excruciating', 'portrayal', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'whom', 'life', 'reserves', 'cruel', 'surprise.Based', 'true', 'events', 'characters', '13th', 'Century', 'translated', 'screen', 'same', 'play', 'turn', 'was', 'adapted', 'quot', 'Murder', 'Cathedral', 'quot', 'historic', 'portrayal', 'Feudal', 'England', 'very', 'imaginative', 'well', 'done.The', 'two', 'actors', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'performances', 'story', 'subplots', 'solid', 'storytelling', 'best', 'kind.The', 'only', 'thing', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'Paramount', 'wonderful', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 're-release', 'techniques', 'never', 'came', 'idea', 're-release', 'one', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'eternal', 'fight', 'rights', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'will', 'go', 'forever', 'Greed', 'rule', 'world', 'even', 'when', 'real', 'masterpieces', 'art', 'history.Producers', 'go', 'insane', 'studios', 'uptight', 'not', 'use', 'euphemism', 'it.Whatever', 'happened', 'reasonable', 'creative', 'talented', 'producers', 'yesteryear', 'what', 'chasing', 'bankers', 'lawyers', 'kind', 'Hollywood', 'instead', 'bring', 'back', 'guys', 'la', 'Talberg', 'Mayer', 'Selznick', 'Warner', 'who', 'had', 'sense', 'business', 'also', 'had', 'creative', 'talent', 'interest', 'public', 'heart', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'once', 'said', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'rewarded', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'How', 'right', 'How', 'wise.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'awards', 'rewards', 'there', 'too', 'little', 'true', 'talent', 'them.But', 'world', 'business', 'not', 'creative', 'minds.So', 'conclusion', 'buy', 'videotape', 'well', 'worth', 'would', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'anyway', 'otherwise', 'may', 'spend', 'twice', 'money', 'still', 'own', 'LD', 'player', 'try', 'get', 'hold', 'LaserDisc', 'image', 'resolution', 'sharper', 'sound', 'still', 'miserable', 'conventional', 'Mono.I', 'hope', 'way', 'whenever', 'whomever', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'generous', 'release', 'DVD', 'version', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'clean', 'up', 'somewhat', 'perhaps', 'remaster', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality.I', 'know', 'perfectly', 'well', 'movies', 'were', 'simply', 'produced', 'Mono', 'Sometimes', 'spare', 'money', 'sometimes', 'plainly', 'director', 'wanted', 'so', 'hey', ""'re"", 'living', '21st', 'Century', 'now', 'not', '1960', 'so', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'purists', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'better', 'stereo', 'sound', 'mix', 'own', 'sounds', 'can', 'produce', 'perfect', 'balanced', 'round', 'stereo', 'sound', 'monaural', 'record', 'possess', 'big', 'deal', 'people', 'think', 'costly', 'Wrong', 'only', 'cost', 'time', 'not', 'money', 'Even', 'kid', 'could', 'do', 'Becket', 'said', 'monaural', 'so', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'recent', 'other', 'DVD', 'releases', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Movies', 'early', 'James', 'Bond', 'flicks', 'many', 'others', 'still.I', 'wonder', 'studios', 'have', 'become', 'purists', 'simply', 'plain', 'lazy', 'money', 'people', 'pay', 'yearly', 'go', 'movies', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'CD', 'Soundtracks', 'various', 'memorabilia', 'amazing', 'studios', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'finances', 'improve', 'products', 'instead', 'keep', 'producing', 'dozens', 'other', 'new', 'rather', 'stupid', 'see', 'deja', 'vu', 'movies', 'year.Becket', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Ben-Hur', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'certainly', 'not', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'absolutely', 'not', 'boring', 'wasteful', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.But', 'again', 'hey', 'who', 'am', 'criticize', 'am', 'just', 'voice', 'desert.A', 'nobody', 'who', 'DVDs', 'instead', 'going', 'movies.Yet', 'am', 'also', 'stage', 'director', 'actor', 'know', 'when', 'acting', 'good', 'performances', 'are', 'peak.So', 'take', 'have', 'money', 'spare', 'buy', 'tape', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'pop', 'up', 'not', 'can', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'buy', 'DVD', 'day', 'horizon', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'piece', 'acting', 'here.You', 'will', 'never', 'regret']",N/A

177860,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,1556072821,Robert Morris,"[8, 9]","Peter Glenville's direction of this film in no way diminishes the quality of acting among members of the cast, notably Burton and O'Toole, both of whom were nominated for an Academy Award for best actor in a leading role; however, Glenville allows a somewhat sluggish pace which reduces the dramatic impact of the plot, and especially of the multi-dimensional relationship between Thomas Becket (Burton) and his monarch, Henry II (O'Toole). In fact, Edward Anhalt received an Academy Award for his adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play. I wish Glenville had made better use of his cast as well as of Anhalt's screenplay. That said, Burton and O'Toole are magnificent. They portray youthful best friends who share a commitment to hedonism...and to little else. Later, Henry II selects an obviously reluctant Becket (by then a priest) to serve as Archbishop of Canterbury. Becket's acceptance marks a defining moment which he recognizes but his king does not: Henceforth his highest loyalty will be to Almighty God, not to the occupant of the English throne. Opinions vary as to whether or not the historical Henry specifically ordered Becket's assassination but all agree that he would never have authorized it to be done in Canterbury Cathedral. Nonetheless it was.This is a visually stunning film, perhaps even moreso than (for example) The Lion in Winter (1968) in which O'Toole also appears as Henry II. Granted, the relationship between Henry and Eleanor in that film is quite different from Henry's relationship with Becket. Also, The Lion in Winter covers only a few days during one Christmas season whereas the timeframe in Becket extends over several decades. However, both films focus on conflicting as well as congenial relationships. In Becket, Henry (in effect) finds himself competing with God for Becket's loyalty and devotion. He loses. The supporting cast is first-rate. Notably John Gielgud (Louis VII), Donald Wolfit (Bishop Folliot), Martita Hunt (Queen Matilda), and Gino Cervi (Cardinal Zambelli). The role of Queen Eleanor (Pamela Brown) is minor when contrasted with Eleanor (Katherine Hepburn) as she is presented in The Lion in Winter.Question: Why is there no DVD version of Becket?Those who share my high regard for this film are urged to check out the aforementioned The Lion in Winter as well as Cromwell (1970), Elizabeth (1998), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Anne of the Thousand Days(1969), and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971).",5,Dual Portraits: Monarch and Martyr,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2451,"['Peter', 'Glenville', 'direction', 'film', 'way', 'quality', 'acting', 'members', 'cast', 'notably', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'whom', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'leading', 'role', 'however', 'Glenville', 'somewhat', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'plot', 'especially', 'multi-dimensional', 'relationship', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'Burton', 'monarch', 'Henry', 'II', ""O'Toole"", 'fact', 'Edward', 'Anhalt', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'adaptation', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'play', 'wish', 'Glenville', 'had', 'made', 'better', 'use', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Anhalt', 'screenplay', 'said', 'Burton', ""O'Toole"", 'are', 'magnificent', 'portray', 'youthful', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'share', 'commitment', 'hedonism', 'little', 'else', 'Later', 'Henry', 'II', 'obviously', 'reluctant', 'Becket', 'then', 'priest', 'serve', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Becket', 'acceptance', 'defining', 'moment', 'king', 'not', 'Henceforth', 'highest', 'loyalty', 'will', 'be', 'Almighty', 'God', 'not', 'occupant', 'English', 'throne', 'Opinions', 'vary', 'not', 'historical', 'Henry', 'specifically', 'ordered', 'Becket', 'assassination', 'agree', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'authorized', 'be', 'done', 'Canterbury', 'Cathedral', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'perhaps', 'even', 'moreso', 'example', 'Lion', 'Winter', '1968', ""O'Toole"", 'also', 'Henry', 'II', 'Granted', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'Eleanor', 'film', 'quite', 'different', 'Henry', 'relationship', 'Becket', 'Also', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'one', 'Christmas', 'season', 'whereas', 'timeframe', 'Becket', 'several', 'decades', 'However', 'films', 'focus', 'conflicting', 'as', 'well', 'congenial', 'relationships', 'Becket', 'Henry', 'effect', 'competing', 'God', 'Becket', 'loyalty', 'devotion', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'Notably', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Louis', 'VII', 'Donald', 'Wolfit', 'Bishop', 'Folliot', 'Martita', 'Hunt', 'Queen', 'Matilda', 'Gino', 'Cervi', 'Cardinal', 'Zambelli', 'role', 'Queen', 'Eleanor', 'Pamela', 'Brown', 'minor', 'when', 'contrasted', 'Eleanor', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'presented', 'Lion', 'Winter.Question', 'Why', 'there', 'DVD', 'version', 'Becket', 'who', 'share', 'high', 'regard', 'film', 'are', 'urged', 'check', 'out', 'aforementioned', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'as', 'well', 'Cromwell', '1970', 'Elizabeth', '1998', 'A', 'Man', 'All', 'Seasons', '1966', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', '1969', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', '1971']",N/A

It is the story of King Henry II of England and his friendship and eventual conflict with his friend, Thomas Becket, whom he has appointed as the Archbishop of Canterbury.  The time is two generations after the Norman Conquest of England, and the bitterness between the Norman victors and the defeated Saxons is still very much alive as the central fact of English political life.The story deals with the rivalry between Church and State.  King Henry sought to outmaneuver and check the growing power of the the Church, which was acting as a second, and perhaps more powerful, government.  Thomas Becket, his Chancellor and chief advisor, has warned him that in ten year's time there would only be one King--and it wouldn't be King Henry!  The King's plan: to appoint his closest friend, Thomas Becket, as the head of the Church of England.  But Becket feels honor-bound to fight for the Church and against King Henry.  The result is an absolute masterpiece tale of friendship, politics, and conflict.  This is a great story.As if all of that isn't enough, Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton each in this movie turn in the greatest performances of their careers.  O'Toole is utterly engrossing as King Henry, who is dissolute, disciplined, sly, and scheming.  Burton is great as the highly intelligent, conflicted Thomas Becket, who seeks to reconcile his friendship and loyalty to his King with his honor and the duty he owes to the Church.

The story is fascinating, this part of history (around 1100) is rarely shownand told so it is great that this movie tackles it. It's a Shakesperean story with maybe less twists and turns but the feel is there with the monarchy in the forefront and the study of a King (Henry second). I would consider this film an almost epic cause all the ingredients are there (costumes, art direction) but the budget was thinner like the great epics of the era so it feels more independant let's say which is not a criticism. The cinematography is superior and also the great performances and the direction of Peter Glenville. The only thing is, the thing I hate the most about a transfer was there which is the instability of the image. Don't get me wrong the transfer is ok and the colors are rich and the sharpness of the image is correct but often enough the image moves and wasn't stable and man I hate that. I don't blame the company who did the transfer for the reason that they give us this great title but I had to say it cause it bothered me a little bit.

177874,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,1556072821,Thomas Keneally,"[13, 13]","Peter Glenville's Becket is one of the earliest movies that shows the differences between state and church. Set in 12th century England, this has Peter O'Toole as Henry II and his friend Richard Burton as the Archbishop of Canterbury. It has one of the finest cast and outstanding screenplay. Richard Burton has often been complained for overacting his parts, this movie is one were his part is beautifully played were he gradually changes from a loyal servant of the King to one who becomes loyal to God. Peter O'Toole performance is also fantastic were he is torn between the love for his friend and the hatred that he has for the new power that he has to fight. I doubt if there are any actors now except probably Anthony Hopkins who can play this well.That year saw the release of My Fair Lady that pretty much vanquished all the other movies. Though Rex Harrison is an outstanding actor and that movie is superb, it was more popular than this one. It was also intelligently made and the appeal was not lost to the Oscar people. So, our two people lost yet again. This was the one time when they lost to a reasonable actor (I think). In all, they lost 7 times, sometimes to not so great actors, which was really sad. Luck has a lot to do with it. The movie won for best screenplay, which one will understand why.The film starts out with mirth and becomes serious when the previous Archbishop dies and Henry, who was always opposed by the church, finally decides to get his friend appointed to the post. He does not realize that Thomas Becket has been trying to find his honor and this appointment lets him find it. In history, the final separation happens when Henry VIII creates the church of England to marry Anne Boleyn. Both the King and the Bishop play their parts very well and there are points that one can argue for both. In all, it is a wonderfully made movie, which everyone would adore. The movie is more to do with friendship and its interaction with the person's job than to do with religion. The movie is well directed and subtle. Supporting actors such as John Gielgud do a very good job.

Although it's of no particular importance, I tried to get Amazon to fix the problem several times, to no avail. This was probably my ""punishment"" for being the first to post, on January 30th, the fact that MPI was releasing ""Becket"" in the DVD edition on May 15, 2007. My post, meant to be nothing more than joyous news for ""Becket"" fans, was removed by someone in Amazon, twice! Today's attempt to file a ""Becket"" review, October 11, 2007, will be my last: ***It would be easy to write paragraphs of praise for ""Becket"" for so many reasons. But what makes it unique to me is the perfect balance of the energies and talents of two such powerful and masterful actors as Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.This is shown first as the two (Becket and Henry, respectively) are fast friends and staunch allies in supporting the position of the King and the success of England. But it is just as powerful and robust when they become enemies. Each has enormous powers of projection, in love and hate, in happy humor as well as acidic acrimony and sarcasm. And we see the dynamic forces in motion in the personalities of the two throughout the story. At the very beginning, they are like two young guys, partying all night, and actually very much alike. By the end of the story, Henry is an almost insane wretch, convulsing with both his love and hate for Becket, while Becket has developed from clever statesman and master negotiator to being almost a pure warrior of God, surrendering everything and his life itself to ""Your Divine Will"".And the icing on the cake is the equally poised and perfectly balanced uses of both explosive, vicious rages, as well as sophisticated spontaneous humor.

It is also based on a real historical drama, one that would in no small part determine history as we know it. The struggle between church and state for power, both political and over the hearts and minds of the people, is the backdrop for what becomes a very personal struggle in this film. Nevertheless it lends those personal struggles an importance that makes them never seem silly or self obsessed.
