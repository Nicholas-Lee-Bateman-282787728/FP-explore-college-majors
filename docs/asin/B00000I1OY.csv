501915,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00000I1OY,Aco,"[14, 16]","This is a slightly disturbing yet beautifully simple story of a man's slow unnerving return home. Burt Lancaster plays Ned Merril, a seemingly popular socialite amongst the wealthy suburban estates he neighbors. But today he has decided to swim home, going from pool to pool in a metaphorical river back to the home he shares with his wife and two daughters. Along the way he meets people he knows, including a young woman who once baby-sat his kids. But the more he swims, and the closer he gets to home, the more his facade of charm and joviality melts, ultimately revealing something else altogether.Lancaster is great in the part. And considering he was a major actor at the time, this is a risky part, one it must be said, he plays in a bathing suit and nothing else. He is also in every scene. The man's eventual deterioration though is dealt with well, slowly building as the audience gets clues as to the possible ills surrounding him and his family. Based on a John Cheever short story, this is an excellent, yet troubling film, one possibly not well known, but featuring a superb performance from Lancaster.",4,A Long Swim Home,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1117,"['slightly', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'story', 'man', 'slow', 'unnerving', 'return', 'home', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'plays', 'Ned', 'Merril', 'seemingly', 'popular', 'socialite', 'wealthy', 'suburban', 'today', 'decided', 'swim', 'home', 'going', 'pool', 'pool', 'metaphorical', 'river', 'back', 'home', 'shares', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'way', 'people', 'including', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'baby-sat', 'kids', 'more', 'closer', 'home', 'more', 'facade', 'charm', 'joviality', 'melts', 'ultimately', 'revealing', 'something', 'else', 'altogether.Lancaster', 'great', 'part', 'considering', 'was', 'major', 'actor', 'time', 'risky', 'part', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'bathing', 'suit', 'nothing', 'else', 'also', 'scene', 'man', 'eventual', 'deterioration', 'dealt', 'well', 'slowly', 'building', 'audience', 'clues', 'possible', 'ills', 'surrounding', 'family', 'Based', 'John', 'Cheever', 'short', 'story', 'excellent', 'yet', 'troubling', 'film', 'one', 'possibly', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'featuring', 'superb', 'performance', 'Lancaster']",N/A

First of all, Burt's charachter tries to &quot;make it&quot; with just about every woman he meets, if she's young and beautiful. Second, the story-line seems rather aimless and pointless: about a man who came from just about nowhere only to wind up distraught in a rainstorm at his house which ahd been abandoned for some time. Third, it showed human nature at it's very lowest, the only ones seemingly who cared about the swimmer were a friend he owed a lot of bills to and his ex-lover, who was civil to him for a brief moment, both of these being towards the end of the film (this isn't counting the pretty, young lady he said had been his baby sitter. He tried to &quot;make it&quot; with her, only to see her run off away from him somewhere in the midst of the movie...).Cponclusion: don't waste your time with this one.

501922,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00000I1OY,Craig Connell,"[12, 13]","This is one of the more strang movies Ive seen over the years. Then again, portraits of delusional, mentally-ill people tend to be a little different. This, however, is VERY different and is a success because Burt Lancaster plays the the title role so well.Lancaster's character, ""Neddy,"" is a man  who decides to ""swim"" home, doing laps in neighbors'pools for several miles until he reaches ""home."" That's the plot.However, the real story is uncovering who and what he is really was in the past. It's also an expose of Yuppie suburban snobbery, something that will never go out of style but is 1960s-ish in this film. It's interesting to see a bunch of familiar actors faces pop up as the various neighbors as Lancaster swims from pool to pool.To focus on the shallow neighbors - and they are shallow, vain and pretty revolting - is to miss how ""Neddy"" is worse than them. Slowly but surely, he is exposed as an adulterer, crook, completely selfish, poor father, etc. etc.In the end, we see just how delusional he is, too, completely unable or unwilling to see reality, still living in his dreamworld. Apparently, two years before the scenes in here take place, he booted out of his house by his also-unlikable wife and lost everything...his family, job, you name it.Much of this film is dream-like, nicely photographed with some pretty nature shots, particularly the first half which features a young actress, Janet Landgard, who was ""introduced"" in this film but never did much after this film.  She plays Burt's former babysitter and he meets up with her early on and then tries to hit on the pretty 20-year- old, finally scaring her away.Landgard has the second-biggest role in the film. The third belongs to Janice Rule, who appears near the end for a long pool-side soap opera scene, the last encounter Burt has until he reaches his destination.Overall, it's an unpleasant, haunting tale of shallow people but it's well-done and sure to evoke a number of discussions and interpretations. It's also interesting to view this movie twice, seeing it a second time when you know exactly Lancaster's situation and mental state. This came from a very short story by John Cheever (10-15 pages, depending on the size of the book) so much of the movie and almost all of the dialog, is made up.

501927,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,B00000I1OY,FRED C. DOBBS,"[6, 6]","The Swimmer is an unusual, unique movie that you will probably never forget.  Hall of famer Burt Lancaster reaffirms his legendary acting prowess in this actionless and philosophical ""trek""  about a ""successful""  middle-aged man who spends a sun-drenched day in his life returning home in the burbs by traversing his neighbors' properties and swimming through their pools . He is ruggedly handsome, fit, glib and popular. He begins his journey poolsiding with rich friends who just say what he wants to hear and ends with some less rich ""friends"" who recall a less flattering past and tell him what he doesn't want to hear and what he probably doesn't know. Initially, the swimmer is admired and adulated but ultimately  is admonished and abhorred. This film has a lot to do with an individual's veridical identity---an often turbulent  balance of how we see and feel about ourselves [our subjective self] versus how others see us [our objective self]. Ideally, they should augment and reinforce each other. However, this is not often the case as we tend to pamper and imbibe ourselves with positive aspects of the former but often fear and avoid negative aspects of the latter. Unfortunately, the former is more prone to aberration by delusions and disease.In his pool-hopping Lancaster tries to seduce a young woman half his age, tries to recapture an old flame he previously renounced, and has a weird encounter with a couple of elderly nudists, among other things. Upon sporadic query throughout this film his wife and kids back home are doing just fine and he is eager to return, but only via this creative and adventurous route. Some of the protagonists we bump into in this journey include Oscar winner Kim Hunter [A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, 1951], the always-attractive vet Janice Rule [with Brando in THE CHASE, 1966], Diana Muldaur [remember her two Star trek episodes in 1968] and even a not-that-bad-looking Joan Rivers as a poolside pickup.Lancaster's encounter with a small boy alone near his waterless pool was an insightful characterization. The boy is home alone, his parents away. Despite the dry, neglected pool Lancaster convinces the boy to descend into the pool and pantomime swimming across with him. It seems nothing will deter the ever-optimistic  swimmer from accomplishing his goal. At the end, however, the boy, practical and concrete as are all his age, seems be aware of the futility of the swimmer's whim. The viewer seems to understand at this point that, unlike the boy, the swimmer is not cognizant of his isolation and solitude. You are left to wonder here whether the boy's ambivalence toward the swimmer results from the latter mirroring, at least in the boy's mind, his parents' tacit abrogation of him and their responsibilities to him.What is A swimmer?  Stripped of all that is corporeal for the buoyancy needed to accomplish his task with ease but rendering him open to exposure and attack,  as all swimmers are usually equal and indistinguishable in form and function---though not ability---now open game for prejudgement and denouncement regardless of class or status. A swimmer has to come out into the open to parlay his practice.  A swimmer is also a user---a user of wonderful physical laws for personal  enjoyment and physical benefit.  A swimmer must also stay on or near the top of his medium lest be crushed or collapsed by these same laws which do not permit descending too deep or rising from the depths too quickly. Obviously, the swimmer cannot be too bold or impulsive or be ignorant of the laws of his environ or he may be harmed or even perish. Though we can see a swimmer on the surface [arms, shoulders and back] there much of him that we do not see. He can easily hide and is always on the move---inconstant and surrepticious. It is only when the swimmer comes out of the water that we can clearly make out his face and underbelly.Who is THE swimmer? Abhorring of clouds and rain, both crowds and solitude, stagnation and interruption and having little regard for boundaries or privacy the swimmer is, among other things, an audacious exhibitionist [not in the prurient sense] and an escapist. In other words, a narcissist and a hedonist with an inflated sense of self, lacking in accountability for past or present actions. But with that ELMER GANTRY [1960] way about him he manages the subterfuge and win our sympathy for most of the film. The swimmer is not a bad guy, not evil or perverse, but just an absorbent product of where he came from and who got him here. And he is delusional, really believing he's a peach of a guy---great friend, cool dad, steadfast husband---aren't we all. The swimmer has many positive attributes: he is a passionate man, full of vigor, an eternal optimist, is friendly and has a sense of humor. But when the mud hits the fan people tend to steer toward individuals with another set of attributes---namely, courage, commitment, constancy and judgement.Lancaster, who late in his career often seemed miscast, was exquisitely cast here. Few stars can captivate a viewer with such evocative expression of eyes and face,  posture and delivery, than  Lancaster whose early-in-the-film  youthful insouciance and vigor, optimism and, of course, that perfect smile, turns the viewer into a sympathetic  ally not aware of who this guy is underneath.  Indeed, he does a wonderful job of deluding the viewer.The swimmer's final pool to cross in his journey is a public pool owned by an obnoxious couple he once knew. They degrade him by  insisting he pay his way through the pool just like anybody else.  With only his trunks on, and not carrying any money,  he further debases himself by asking for a handout from a stranger so he can enter the pool and complete the final leg of his obsession. The ending, where the humiliated Lancaster arrives back home only to find an empty, dilapidated structure---he pounds on the front door and nobody comes, rain pouring over the broken man---is stark and sad. At the end, the swimmer, in his symbolic unidirectional journey, comes to realize that his past actions, and their impact on those around him, are immutable. At the end, the swimmer finds out what many of us  would prefer not to know, or may never know---who he really is and what place in the world he really has.The score, by a pre THE WAY WE WERE and THE STING [ both 1973] Marvin Hamlisch, was melancholic and poignant and served the film very well carrying us through our developing disappointment of the swimmer and the eventual denudation of his character. The DVD has no extras.  It does include a trailer for the movie which is excellent.  Transfer and picture quality were excellent. Hopefully the Criterion Collection series will pick this one up some day and include the in-depth extras it deserves including some info about now-deceased author John Cheever and more about the great

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[3, 6]","Directed by Frank Perry (""Mommie Dearest"" and ""Father of the Bride"") and based on a short story by John Cheever, ""The Swimmer,"" through intriguing is a strange movie indeed. It stars Burt Lancaster, who wears only a snug bathing suit-- if he wears one at all-- for the entire movie. The plot is straight forward. Lancaster (Ned Merrill) visits friends who have a pool and decides that he can swim all the way home just by visiting all the homes in the valley (upper middle class Westport Connecticut) until he swims home to his darling ""Lucinda"" and his two beloved daughters. The viewer soon learns, however, that all is not well in suburbia. Ned apparently has lost a job or been demoted, he owes several of his swimming-pool-owning former friends money. He also runs into a nymphet, a former baby sitter, who reveals that she always had a crush on him, and also a former lover (""you suburban stud""). We watch this man's life unravel before us. While he may be guilty of a lot of things, he is portrayed in a very sympathetic light. Certainly he should not miss all the brittle so-called former friends he meets on his journey. The final image of the film is quite disturbing.Here we see the American dream turned in on itself and another Willie Loman whose life is in shatters.Parts of the movie defy credibility. There is no way a person could walk through lawns, forests and cross highways and have his barefeet not bleeding. Ned's feet for the most part escape unscathed.This 1968 film is certainly worth seeing or revisiting, if you have seen it previously.",4,The American Dream Gone Topsy Turvy.,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1564,"['Directed', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'Father', 'Bride', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'John', 'Cheever', 'Swimmer', 'intriguing', 'strange', 'movie', 'indeed', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'only', 'snug', 'bathing', 'suit', 'one', 'entire', 'movie', 'plot', 'straight', 'forward', 'Lancaster', 'Ned', 'Merrill', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'pool', 'can', 'swim', 'way', 'home', 'just', 'visiting', 'homes', 'valley', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Westport', 'Connecticut', 'home', 'darling', 'Lucinda', 'two', 'beloved', 'daughters', 'viewer', 'soon', 'learns', 'however', 'not', 'well', 'suburbia', 'Ned', 'apparently', 'lost', 'job', 'been', 'demoted', 'several', 'swimming-pool-owning', 'former', 'friends', 'money', 'also', 'nymphet', 'former', 'baby', 'sitter', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'crush', 'also', 'former', 'lover', 'suburban', 'stud', 'watch', 'man', 'life', 'unravel', 'may', 'be', 'guilty', 'lot', 'things', 'portrayed', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'Certainly', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'brittle', 'so-called', 'former', 'friends', 'journey', 'final', 'image', 'film', 'quite', 'disturbing.Here', 'see', 'American', 'dream', 'turned', 'Willie', 'Loman', 'life', 'shatters.Parts', 'movie', 'defy', 'credibility', 'way', 'person', 'could', 'walk', 'lawns', 'forests', 'cross', 'highways', 'have', 'barefeet', 'not', 'bleeding', 'Ned', 'feet', 'most', 'part', 'escape', 'unscathed.This', '1968', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'revisiting', 'have', 'seen', 'previously']",N/A

You may exhibit several examples about the question of the loneliness , like Sunset boulevard, Midnight cowboy, the naked kiss or even Butterfield 8. These films are worthy. But no film before and even thirty six years (with the exceptions of Paris Texas and American beauty) had approached the question in just so brutally dramatic, showing the naked soul of a mature man in a suden decadence.Perry had the Midas touch when the story goes through all the swimming pool of Kentucky.An intimate portrayal,a collage that describes like a few, the roughness, the cruelty the indifference of the human condition around a man who lost his center, his eaning for living, and surviving just by feeding his memories.His ancient friends, his old love affairs , show us with no mercy the unboreble loneliness of this man who was once and now he's just a post card human, a colection piece , a lost specimenfrom an old tale.Lancaster gives us an unforgettable performing. I{m absolutely sure that the character of Lancaster in Atlantic city, was so easy to Burt, due he applied the emotive memory, apart his notable skills.The swimmer is a cult movie. It's a acid view about a society who doesn't accept the failure, which runs from a lonely man who doesn't have to say excepts his memories.Do you remember the sequence when he tries to get into the swimming pool in which he must to clean his feet before to get in? . The metaphor is so absorbing and fascinating that you can not forget easily.

501933,A2U4KVPAK32T96,B00000I1OY,James K. Stewart,"[2, 3]","""I'm swimming home - pool by pool. They form a river all the way to my house. Come with me. Live a little.""This is one of those films it seems people either love or hate. In my case, I LOVE it and see it as a hauntingmasterpiece, in no small part due to  Burt Lancaster's brilliant performance and the late Marvin Hamlisch's fab-ulous score, which is now available on a gorgeous expanded FSM cd from 2006. I first saw ""The Swimmer"" lateone night on tv back in 1970, and it stood out as a very unique, unforgettable, dramatic work that I made sureto catch again whenever it was shown.  It is now one of my all-time favorite films that I have on dvd and STILLhave the RCA/Columbia laserdisc from 1990 that I watch. Based on the 1964 short-story by John Cheever, di-rected by Frank Perry, and adapted by Perry's wife, Eleanor, it was filmed on location in Westport, Connecticutduring summer 1966, but wasn't released until 1968. In playing the affluent, mentally disturbed character, NedMerrill, Lancaster spends the ENTIRE film in a set of swimming trunks as he journeys by foot (and pool) acrossa vast, upscale Connecticut suburb one afternoon.  Burt was all of 55 years of age at this time, and in fabulousshape for this role. The story begins in a very optimistic tone on a bright, sunny day with absolutely no indica-tion that ANYTHING is wrong - all seems normal. After a surprise visit and a brief chat with some old friends intheir back yard by their pool, he suddenly comes up with the idea he's going to ""swim home"" across the countypool-by-pool, using the neighborhood swimming pools as his means. The ""journey"", thus, begins. He encountersboth friends and enemies, as well as admiration, ridicule, rejection, and outright hostility.  It becomes increasing-ly clear, after each encounter, that there is, indeed, something VERY wrong with Ned. With one, he is told toleave and never come back as he had never visited or called when a friend was sick, in another he has a bizarremeeting with an eccentric, elderly couple who are nudists, and another one involves a small boy in an empty poolplaying a flute who Ned befriends and offers encouragement about life's meaning. The longest, most developedsegment involves him with a 20-year old girl, Julie Ann Hooper, played by Janet Landgard in her first cinematicrole, who used to babysit Ned's daughters. She joins him on his ""journey"" for a while, but takes flight after Nedgets fresh with her. Composer Hamlisch's (1944-2012) scoring for this particular sequence in the film is nothingshort of brilliant and demonstrates GREAT writing for scenes with the two characters running, jumping, and walk-ing together in the country. Ned continues his ""swim home"" and encounters more characters from his past. Atone pool party he shows up at, comic Joan Rivers makes her movie debut in a very brief scene as a suburbanitewhom Ned ""puts the moves on"", (something you won't see in any other film on this planet.) When she was writingher 1995 autobiography, ""Still Talking"", Rivers said she had trouble working with Lancaster: ""He redirected everyline so that there would be no sympathy for me. Frank (Perry) wanted a happy girl who then got hurt. Lancasterwas going to be Mr. Wonderful who came up against a mean bitch, and was right not to go off with her. Tryingto please both men, I was going back and forth between line readings, and nothing made sense."" This ONE briefscene, incredibly, took Perry 7 days to complete! At the same pool party, he later gets into a violent confronta-tion with the host over a hot-dog wagon he claims is his and is thrown out.  He then continues on to an actresslounging by her pool (played by Janice Rule) who was once his mistress. After Ned gets fresh, as well, with her,she sends him on his way again. This particular sequence in the film was shot by director Sydney Pollack, whoColumbia had brought in (along with two other directors) to work on the movie as, virtually from the start, Perryand Lancaster had clashed over ""creative differences"", and Perry had since departed from the set. In the originalsequence that was shot by Perry (and later removed by producer Sam Spiegel who financed ""The Swimmer""), Bar-bara Loden played the actress/mistress Shirley Abbott who rejects Merrill. Perry said that Lancaster, himself, hadWANTED to re-shoot this powerful and climatic scene because, ""Barbara Loden...destroyed him as a character,which was the way it was supposed to be, and many people felt she destroyed him as an actor...There was not asingle climatic take of hers at which the crew did not giver HER--a standing ovation. It drove Lancaster crazy.""Lancaster offers a different version on what happened: ""It was simply not done the first time."" In the final stu-dio cut of ""The Swimmer"", less than half of what Perry had filmed was ACTUALLY used. Becuase of this and there-shooting that was necessary, some filming was done later in California and Hollywood. In his next encounter,getting very close to his real home, Ned crosses a busy highway where he is yelled at with hostile gestures untilhe makes it to a very crowded public swimming pool at which he is not welcome. A bad scene ensues over $, hisdebts, his character, and his family, whereupon he angrily leaves and climbs a hill by the pool. By this point, themood of the film is very grim and dark, as reality is FINALLY setting in for Ned. Hamlisch's score effectively and in-tensely reflects this in the film with beautiful orchestration. These final scenes in ""The Swimmer"", in which Ned isshivering and staggering to his now abandoned home, lead up to the powerful hallucinatory sounds of his youngdaughters playing tennis. This, and the scenes of him trying to open his locked front door with a thunderstorm nowraging while he's totally breaking down and crying, are the most heartbreaking and disturbing in the entire film. De-finitely NOT a happy ending. Lancaster stated that the premise of a man swimming home by way of his neighbors'pools was, ""a tragedy based on the American way of life, with its emphasis on success and a misguided notion thata man can get by on charm alone."" He considered his role as the disturbed Ned Merrill as one of his favorites, butsaid in a TAKE 22 interview that, ""the whole film was a disaster."" He personally paid $10,000 of his own $ for thelast day of shooting, as Columbia had bailed from the film because of too many problems with it. Perry felt thatLancaster was ""positively antithetical to Ned Merrill"" and wanted William Holden for the role. He even didn't consi-der Lancaster skilled enough to give the role justice. Assistant director Michael Herzberg said that Lancaster andPerry ""were just wrong for each other.""  It was an extremely difficult film to make, but, for me, I find the finishedproduct a haunting, beautiful work of art along with the magnificent musical score by Marvin Hamlisch, which washis first feature film and composed while still a 24 year old college student. A classic timepiece from the 60's aboutmiddle-age failure, confusion, and loss convincingly played by the great Burt Lancaster, critics and movie-goersalike were both divided in their reactions to ""The Swimmer"", but it has long since become a cult favorite. The NewYork Times wrote, ""Although literal in style, the film has the shape of an open-ended hallucination. It is a grim, dis-turbing, and sometimes funny view of a very small, very special segment of upper-middle-class American life"", whileVariety said, ""Alot of people are not going to understand this film; many will loathe it; others will be moved deeply.""Other reviews were less kind: Newsweek said the film ""looked like a shampoo commercial""; McCall's magazine moviecritic referred to the the film's ""poolside after poolside of appalling people"" as very unrealistic. The original dvd ofthe film is getting more rare and expensive to find now, as it hasn't been re-issued since the first release in 2003.A region 2 version is more widely available and affordable, and the laserdisc format can still be located online, but anew special edition dvd of ""The Swimmer"" w/added features is LONG overdue.

501934,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00000I1OY,Jeffrey Leach,"[15, 17]","On the surface (no pun intended), ""The Swimmer"" doesn't look like the sort of movie a diehard horror fan like myself would enjoy. Look at that DVD cover, for instance. Burt Lancaster and Janet Landgard staring dreamily at each other while standing in front of a sun drenched swimming pool. What is this madness? Why would I spend even a second with a film that simply reeks of romantic drama? Well, the DVD cover is as misleading as the beginning scenes of the film contained within. ""The Swimmer"" is about as far from a romantic melodrama as ""Friday the 13th"" is from ""Meatballs."" This 1968 examination of the mental collapse of a member of America's affluent class is a horror lover's dream; a grim, unforgiving film that refuses to pull any punches when the ""Twilight Zone"" ending unfolds with all of its sinister implications. Sure, no one's head explodes, no one finds himself or herself on the receiving end of a sharp instrument, but that shouldn't preclude the serious shriek cinema aficionado from checking this downbeat picture out and giving it a whirl. ""The Swimmer,"" more than most other films I've seen recently, stays with you long after the final credits roll.Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster), when we first see him, seems like a guy who has it all. A strong, healthy looking fellow with a warm personality and a ready grin, Merrill jogs out of the foliage to banter with a few of his neighbors. Everyone around the pool seems to love this guy even though they claim they haven't seen him in ages. Lots of ""hearty fellow well met"" dialogue follows as Merrill's friends inquire about his family, his job, and his impressive physique. Ned fires back like pro, cajoling and chuckling with aplomb. After taking a dip in the swimming pool, our hero comes up with a plan. Surveying the Connecticut countryside, he suddenly realizes that it's entirely possible to ""swim"" home, namely by swimming through all of his neighbors' pools. His friends cackle at such craziness, but Merrill is undeterred. Off he goes on his personal little quest which, when you think about, is a fun idea. What better way to spend a summer day than passing through estate after estate loaded with well manicured lawns, opulent homes, and good company? Every pool Merrill will swim through belongs to people who have known him for years. As we'll soon see, however, this is far from a good thing.At first Ned finds his neighbors accommodating and personable, especially when he runs into his daughters' former babysitter lounging poolside with her friends. Julie Hooper (Janet Landgard) is a gorgeous young lady with blonde hair, and she seems quite happy to run into her old boss Ned. She's so happy to see him, in fact, that she agrees to join his mission. The two caper about, running through the forests separating the pools while talking about the good times. They even spend time running around in an old horse stall, leaping over obstacles and generally having a great time. Sadly, Hooper flees after an uncomfortable conversation with Ned in which she reveals she once had a crush on him. Merrill troops on alone, but now things don't go so well. His friends turn cold and distant--some resort to outright hostility when they see him--and very unpleasant information rises to the surface. Dark insinuations hint at Merrill's insolvency in all things financial, personal problems with the wife and kiddies, unemployment, and unpaid debts owed to local businesses. Ned doesn't seem to understand the animus aimed at him, but presses on nonetheless, determined to arrive home in time to play tennis with his young daughters. What will Ned Merrill find when he gets there?""The Swimmer"" suffers a few flaws, including an incredibly dated score from Marvin Hamlisch and some very cheesy set pieces. For example, check out that huge pool party. Whew! Those dance moves nearly had me clawing my eyes out! But once you get past the idea that you're watching an older film from a time when fashion and music tended to be a little off the wall, you're in for a treat. The best part of the movie is simply trying to discern exactly what happened to Ned Merrill. He committed adultery, if the emotional scene where Ned confronts his embittered former mistress is any indication, and he moved through life like the world owed him something, but what exactly sent him over the edge? For that matter, is he over the edge? Or did something far more sinister occur? Why do all of his neighbors act as though they haven't seen him for ages? Where has he been since his disgrace? One suspects the local nuthouse put out an APB on this guy. ""The Swimmer"" raises far more questions than it's willing to answer, so if you need a film that lays everything out in the open you should probably look elsewhere. But if you like a film that keeps you guessing, that features a guy and a girl running around a track like a pair of horses, ""The Swimmer"" should be your cup of tea.Some maintain that the movie is an examination of the hollowness of the upper class, and in several respects that assertion contains grains of truth. The wealthy nudists (!) that spurn Ned, the endless parties and the drinking in the middle of the day (don't these people work?), and the attention to material possessions certainly supply plenty of evidence to back up this argument. But I think the movie is more interested in showing us one human being's inability to cope with tragedy than it is in revealing the decadence of a bunch of upper crust grand poobahs. Then again, I could be wrong. Give ""The Swimmer"" a watch and decide for yourself. Me? I'm putting on my trunks and going out for a dip in the pool!",4,Last one in is a rotten egg!,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,5652,"['surface', 'pun', 'intended', 'Swimmer', ""n't"", 'look', 'sort',

They were:1)Where Ned has been?2)How long has he been away?3)What happened to his family?4)Why he thinks he still lives in a house which has been abandoned for several years?As the movie is supposed to be an allegory, shouldn't these four questions have some merit to such an allegory?Needless to say, I was assuming that the film was a portrayal of mental illness. All it really was was a total waste of time.I am of the understanding that the original short story had an answer to all these questions of mine...ALCOHOLISM! Sadly, the sorry director and screenplay writer failed to comprehend that there may, just may, be people who have never read the original short story.I understand when an actor achieves such success in his craft, he can afford to do projects which won't, and don't, further his career.

501936,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00000I1OY,J. Michael Click,"[6, 7]","Generally dismissed by critics and ignored by the public when it was first released in 1968, ""The Swimmer"" has since developed a small but fervent cult following and is now considered a minor classic.  The film's enhanced reputation is well-deserved: it boasts a pungent and literate script by Eleanor Perry based on a story by John Cheever; taut direction by Frank Perry (with an uncredited assist from Sydney Pollack); exquisite cinematography by David L. Quaid; and excellent performances by a large and diverse cast headed by Burt Lancaster in an acting tour de force.  The star is ably supported by veteran players Janice Rule, Kim Hunter, Jan Miner, and Cornelia Otis Skinner; newcomer Janet Landgard; and - in a small but effective dramatic turn - comedienne Joan Rivers.Lancaster, whose fabled film career included award-winning performances in such acclaimed films as ""From Here to Eternity"", ""The Rose Tattoo"", ""Separate Tables"", ""Elmer Gantry"", ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""The Leopard"", ""Atlantic City"", and dozens more, was frequently asked by interviewers to name his favorite among his credits.  Although his answers tended to vary, it's hardly surprising that he often singled out the role of Ned Merrill in ""The Swimmer"" as his best.  Lancaster is on screen, dominating the action, throughout the film's 95 minute running time, and the part emphasizes his best attributes as an actor - namely his commanding physical presence, his remarkable athletic ability, and his talent for playing charmingly glib characters whose surface simplicity eventually peels away to reveal complex, dark undertones.  Lancaster is perfect in the role of a middle-aged suburban resident who decides to return to his home by swimming across his neighbors' pools; along the way, his character's defenses are washed away through his interactions with the people from his past that he encounters.

501942,A1LBBULBEREVEF,B00000I1OY,Kathy Fennessy,"[85, 90]","Odd, unsettling film, based on a short story by John Cheever (from his Pulitzer Prize winning collection), about a middle aged man who swims from one end of suburban Westport, Connecticut to the other. Wearing only a snug pair of swim trunks, Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) swims in each of his neighbors' pools until he reaches his home which, as he tells almost everyone he encounters, has a tennis court rather than a pool. Along the way, the sky turns from blue to black (both literally and metaphorically), and he realizes his life isn't quite what he thought it was.Despite the presence of Lancaster, who was still in terrific shape at the time (he was 55 in 1968), Frank Perry's film was far from successful. And it isn't hard to see why--this isn't a happy tale and there's barely even a glimmer of hope or redemption at the end. Nonetheless, it's powerful and original stuff and, although you might imagine otherwise, doesn't really have much in common with the suburban melodramas of the 1950s, like ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,"" or the suburban black comedies of the 1990s, like ""American Beauty.""Granted, ""The Graduate,"" which was released only a year before, was just as cynical towards the Left Coast's version of swimming pool and cocktail culture, but that cynicism was leavened by humor and the point of view was, even more significantly, that of the young characters in the film rather than their parents. That isn't the case with ""The Swimmer,"" which is more like a condensed version of ""The Great Gatsby"" or ""Death of a Salesman."" In other words, it's a fully realized character study and minor classic about the failure of the American Dream.

This is certainly one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen and definitely in my Top 20. The film maker slowly reveals the Ned Merrill's denial of reality as he tries to convince everyone and himself that he still has his job, family, and home. The scene with the empty pool is the most revealing of all the pools. The empty pool is a metaphor for his mental condition. He tells the boy, Kevin Gilmartin, that if you believe in something hard enough it's true for you -- in this case that there is water in the pool. As he leaves he hears the kid on the diving board and thinks the kid is going to dive into the empty pool.

Fortunately, Netflix recently added it to its collection.  Based on the classic John Cheever story, the film is a valiant but ultimately failed attempt to bring the story to the screen.Burt Lancaster's portrayal of Neddy Merrill carries the narrative as he progresses from one house to the next.  His recent loss of his income and fortune is mirrored, as in the story, by the gradual deterioration of his relations with the people he encounters, going from joyous acceptance to outright hostility.  Several additions, probably added to extend the film to the requisite hour and a half, make no sense otherwise.  The scene at the public pool, involving only some lifeguards yelling at Neddy to get out of the pool because he has no &#34;identification disk,&#34; is stretched out in the film to include an encounter with people who know him, and a gatekeeper forcing him to shower.  Other additional scenes include a lengthy sequence where a young lady that Neddy knew as a child, travels the &#34;Lucinda River&#34; with him for a ways before confessing that she was in love with him.  In another, where in the story Cheever only mentions that one pool Neddy encounters is drained, in the film becomes a full scene with a young boy that Lancaster takes into the empty pool to pantomime &#34;swimming&#34; across it.  At one party, where Neddy is called a &#34;gate crasher,&#34; he clumsily hits on Joan Rivers, of all people.The real problem is that the story is unfilmable.  Thoughts and impressions that work on the page, don't sound the same when a character has to voice them out loud.  The story begins with &#34;It was one of those midsummer Sundays when everyone sits around saying 'I *drank* too much last night.'&#34;  This just sounds phony when people say it in conversation.  The ending also may not make sense to anyone who isn't already familiar with it - the filmmakers show Neddy attempting to get into his old house in a driving rainstorm, then focus on the interior, which is empty.  How feeble compared to the story's powerful concluding lines:  &#34;The house was locked, and he thought that the stupid cook or the stupid maid must have locked the place up until he remembered that it had been some time since they had employed a maid or cook.  He shouted, pounded on the door, tried to force it with his shoulder, and then, looking in at the windows, saw that the place was empty.&#34;  What on the page is symbolic and clear becomes confusing and incoherent on the screen.The DVD includes bonus material with several people who were involved in the film discussing their experience with it.  On the whole, &#34;The Swimmer&#34; is only recommended for those who appreciate the story and for the sake of completeness, want to see it on the screen.",3,A disappointment,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2870,"['had', 'waited', 'see', 'film', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'shell', 'out', 'upwards', '30', 'copy', 'Fortunately', 'Netflix', 'recently', 'added', 'collection', 'Based', 'classic', 'John', 'Cheever', 'story', 'film', 'valiant', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'attempt', 'bring', 'story', 'screen.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'portrayal', 'Neddy', 'Merrill', 'narrative', 'one', 'house', 'next', 'recent', 'loss', 'income', 'fortune', 'mirrored', 'story', 'gradual', 'deterioration', 'relations', 'people', 'going', 'joyous', 'acceptance', 'outright', 'hostility', 'Several', 'additions', 'probably', 'added', 'extend', 'film', 'requisite', 'hour', 'half', 'make', 'sense', 'otherwise', 'scene', 'public', 'pool', 'involving', 'only', 'lifeguards', 'yelling', 'Neddy', 'get', 'pool', '34', 'identification', 'disk', '34', 'stretched', 'out', 'film', 'include', 'encounter', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'gatekeeper', 'forcing', 'shower', 'Other', 'additional', 'scenes', 'include', 'lengthy', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', 'lady', 'Neddy', 'knew', 'child', '34', 'Lucinda', 'River', '34', 'ways', 'confessing', 'was', 'love', 'where', 'story', 'Cheever', 'only', 'one', 'pool', 'Neddy', 'drained', 'film', 'full', 'scene', 'young', 'boy', 'Lancaster', 'empty', 'pool', 'pantomime', '34', 'swimming', '34', 'one', 'party', 'where', 'Neddy', 'called', '34', 'gate', 'crasher', '34', 'clumsily', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'people.The', 'real', 'problem', 'story', 'unfilmable', 'Thoughts', 'impressions', 'work', 'page', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'same', 'when', 'character', 'voice', 'out', 'loud', 'story', '34', 'was', 'one', 'midsummer', 'Sundays', 'when', 'everyone', 'saying', '*drank*', 'too', 'much', 'last', 'night', '34', 'just', 'phony', 'when', 'people', 'say', 'conversation', 'ending', 'also', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'familiar', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'Neddy', 'attempting', 'get', 'old', 'house', 'driving', 'rainstorm', 'then', 'focus', 'interior', 'empty', 'How', 'feeble', 'compared', 'story', 'powerful', 'concluding', 'lines', '34', 'house', 'was', 'locked', 'thought', 'stupid', 'cook', 'stupid', 'maid', 'must', 'have', 'locked', 'place', 'up', 'remembered', 'had', 'been', 'time', 'had', 'employed', 'maid', 'cook', 'shouted', 'pounded', 'door', 'tried', 'force', 'shoulder', 'then', 'looking', 'windows', 'saw', 'place', 'was', 'empty.', '34', 'What', 'page', 'symbolic', 'clear', 'becomes', 'confusing', 'incoherent', 'screen.The', 'DVD', 'material', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'film', 'discussing', 'experience', 'whole', '34', 'Swimmer', '34', 'only', 'recommended', 'who', 'appreciate', 'story', 'sake', 'completeness', 'want', 'see', 'screen']",N/A

Listening to the musical artists of the time -- Laura Nyro, Joe Cocker, old Heart records -- one wonders if the rampant search for inner meaning in an increasingly meaningless society ever made it's way to the silver screen. Well, wonder no more, gentle movieviewer! The Swimmer is proof positive that directors, too, were coked to the gills. Set amidst a disgustingly suburban upper-middle class vista, Burt Lancaster (a man who's entire physique immediately brings the name ""Stretch Armstrong"" to mind) decides to mark his return home by 'swimming' across town. No, it's not Venice; he accomplishes his task by taking a dip in every pool in the borough. Along the way, we discover that Lancaster has shafted pretty much everyone in the film, literally or otherwise, and the cinematography takes decidedly bizarre turns during his descent from jet-setting, womanizing capitalist to pathetic, obsessive-compulsive freak. The dialogue is downright absurd at times -- ""What happened to the sun? There's no more warmth in it!"" -- and the cameramen seem to be completely stoned, especially during Janet Langard's soliloquey about her childhood crush on Lancaster, spoken from behind Lancaster's head, behind foliage.

The multi-layer film is all about Ned's capacity for denial and delusion.  He has convinced himself that by successfully swimming home through the succession of estate pools in his wealthy neighborhood, that he will restore his life to what it was before a series of self-inflicted misfortunes ruined him and broke up his family.That Ned's regeneration is centered on swimming pools is appropriate, since bathing is an activity our culture associates with purgation and revitalization. But the cultural convention is turned on its head here and the successive soakings instead wash off layers of denial, culminating in a cleansing rain shower which reveals to both Ned and to viewers the full scope of the ugly reality under the veneer of his illusion.In the film,  Ned's challenge has more layers than in Cheever's original short story.  Cheever used the swimming pools primarily as a metaphor, with Ned's life sequentially compressed into his afternoon odyssey.  The downhill slide of Ned's life is reflected as he moves through the neighborhood, his reception at the first pools is positive,  but at later pools is either neutral or bittersweet, and finally is openly hostile.  As he moves along his energy level drops and he gets physically colder,  by the end the once virile alpha male can barely stumble to the front door of his house.  In the meantime we are reminded several times that Ned is disoriented as to the season of the year,  just as he is disoriented as to the season of his life.The Perry's insert an additional level to the film, one more centered on Ned's promise to himself that successfully completing his quest will make his wishes come true.  By the time Ned articulates to Kevin that believing hard enough in something can make it true, we already know that in his mind fantasy has taken over from reality.  And we flash back to how his playful interactions with Julie Ann Hooper (Janet Landgard) were their most passionate when she was recounting her youthful daydreams.Then again, what do I know?

He wants to make a pilgrimage across miles of his acquaintances' properties in suburban Connecticut, swimming in a string of backyard pools and one public facility, until he reaches his own backyard.Since Lancaster's Neddy Merrill is clad throughout the movie in only a swimming suit (except when he briefly doffs it in the backyard of some nudist buddies), it is really obvious that the story (adapted from John Cheever) is an allegory, and the protagonist is reenacting some kind of Homeric journey.Though Ned Merrill, the swimmer, initially receives a warm welcome in the early stages of his journey, increasingly he is rebuffed and scorned and it becomes clearer that Merrill's poetic vision is really a self-delusional fantasy.  What's more, Merrill injures himself early on when he is full of vigor and trying to cantor like a randy horse, and by the end of the film he seems nearly hypothermic and staggering towards his ruin.Someone once wrote a book about ""The Peter Pan Syndrome"", and the author may have received inspiration from this movie.  In one scene as Merrill confronts his ex-mistress (played by Janice Rule), she even queries of Merrill ""how goes it in Never-Never-Land?""As an exercise in nostalgia and nausea, and a slightly hallucinatory exploration of a man's fall from grace, ""The Swimmer"" manages to be pretty effective.  Within every Eden is a hidden Hades, it tells us.On the downside, at times ""The Swimmer"" has the look of a made for TV movie, and the musical score by a young Marvin Hamlisch is pretty, but it veers close to the similar scores of Michel LeGrand, and gives the movie a ""Sixties"" feel that it can't shake off.",4,Requiem for A Deluded Playboy,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,1911,"['Swimmer', 'off', 'very', 'optimistically', 'well-preserved', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'terrific', 'shape', 'even', '55', 'years', 'age', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'Kennedyesque', 'inspired', 'live', 'one', 'late', 'Summer/early', 'Fall', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'poetry', 'make', 'pilgrimage', 'miles', 'acquaintances', 'properties', 'suburban', 'Connecticut', 'swimming', 'string', 'backyard', 'pools', 'one', 'public', 'facility', 'own', 'backyard.Since', 'Lancaster', 'Neddy', 'Merrill', 'clad', 'movie', 'only', 'swimming', 'suit', 'when', 'doffs', 'backyard', 'nudist', 'buddies', 'really', 'obvious', 'story', 'adapted', 'John', 'Cheever', 'allegory', 'protagonist', 'reenacting', 'kind', 'Homeric', 'journey.Though', 'Ned', 'Merrill', 'swimmer', 'initially', 'warm', 'welcome', 'early', 'stages', 'journey', 'increasingly', 'rebuffed', 'scorned', 'clearer', 'Merrill', 'poetic', 'vision', 'really', 'self-delusional', 'fantasy', 'What', 'more', 'Merrill', 'early', 'when', 'full', 'vigor', 'trying', 'cantor', 'randy', 'horse', 'end', 'film', 'nearly', 'hypothermic', 'staggering', 'towards', 'ruin.Someone', 'once', 'wrote', 'book', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Syndrome', 'author', 'may', 'have', 'received', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'Merrill', 'ex-mistress', 'played', 'Janice', 'Rule', 'even', 'queries', 'Merrill', 'how', 'Never-Never-Land', 'exercise', 'nostalgia', 'nausea', 'slightly', 'hallucinatory', 'exploration', 'man', 'fall', 'grace', 'Swimmer', 'be', 'pretty', 'effective', 'Eden', 'hidden', 'Hades', 'downside', 'times', 'Swimmer', 'look', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'young', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'pretty', 'close', 'similar', 'scores', 'Michel', 'LeGrand', 'movie', 'Sixties', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off']",N/A

Neddy Merrill, perfectly portrayed by past-his-prime Burt Lancaster, is ostensibly a successful businessman and family man. But, as the film progresses, something darker begins to be hinted at, and then begins to emerge. Not all is as it seems in this surreal story. As Neddy makes his way across his suburban world--via his neighbors' swimming pools--the drinking and partying become less pleasant, to say the least. When he (and the viewer) reach the harrowing ending, we realize that the fears and dreads that plague Neddy stem from his denial of his reality.Underneath the plot of ""The Swimmer"" is an allegory about alcoholism. The drinking that goes on in every scene is the comfort that Neddy seeks to conceal his failures and avoid his responsibilities. By the end, we can safely assume that Neddy's alcoholism destroyed his finances and his family, and he just cannot face up to it. Burt Lancaster's performance ranges from the happy-go-lucky, to the completely mystified, to abject fear and pathos. Pollack's understated touch only intensifies Lancaster's performance.

In films like The Flame and the Arrow, Jim Thorpe-All American, The Crimson Pirate, Vera Cruz, Ten Tall Men, From Here to Eternity, The Kentuckian, Trapeze, Gunfight at the OK Corral, and Run Silent, Run Deep, Lancaster seemed to personify and embody the American ideal hero.However, behind those swell guy teeth and that brandished chest was a shrewd actor, who, as he seasoned, made increasingly interesting choices.  In the second half of his career, Lancaster often played off that earlier, heroic persona with admirable risk taking.  If  Elmer Gantry and Seven Days in May might be aptly described as loudly presenting the dirty underbelly of Americana, then The Swimmer intimately one-ups them.In 1968 director Frank Perry with writer/wife Eleanor Perry adapted John Cheever's acclaimed allegorical New Yorker short story, The Swimmer, and brilliantly cast the iconic Burt Lancaster as the pathetic hero.  The Perrys had previously teamed for the equally disturbing David and Lisa (1962) and made quite a splash on the art film circuit.  Surprisingly, that film even garnered a couple of Academy Award nominations, which enabled the team to make The Swimmer.The Swimmer begins on an absurdly bright, sunny day.  Ned (Lancaster), the epitome of a tanned, virile, soulless suburbia, decides he is going to enthusiastically embark on a strange, epic, connect-the-dot journey by ""swimming"" home through the neighborhood swimming pools. He takes along a nubile girl (Janet Langard), but at each pool he encounters facets of his failed life and the crack in his facade slowly begins to expand until the inevitable, tragic conclusion.  The physical reality of The Swimmer (a day in Ned's life) is mere allegory and the allegorical symbolism of Ned's entire life which is, in fact, the physical realm into which we are drawn.Lancaster, the sex symbol, is perfection as he superficially pats his neighbors on the back, encounters a discarded mistress, is confronted by his numerous lies, his betrayals, his failure as a husband, father, friend and neighbor.  By the time he reaches his own home, his paradigm has altered from cartoon sunshine and forced, surface smiles to despairing rain.  When he reaches his porch, he is vulnerable to all the elements which mercilessly come down upon him in all forms, including nature itself.  Ned has ultimately realized his hollow state.Impressively, The Swimmer has a dreamlike, short story, episodic pacing, not at all what is expected in the medium of film, and this adds to its uniqueness.  The Swimmer, fragile indeed in its quite odd structure, is a case where casting really counted.  It would not have worked without its star.  Unfortunately, The Swimmer is out of print and even when it was briefly available, Columbia disrespectfully released it an a cheapo presentation.* my review was originally published at 366 weird movies",5,THE SWIMMER,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,3012,"['When', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'began', 'career', 'actor', 'appeared', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'career', 'mold', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'films', 'Flame', 'Arrow', 'Jim', 'Thorpe-All', 'American', 'Crimson', 'Pirate', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'Ten', 'Tall', 'Men', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Kentuckian', 'Trapeze', 'Gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'Run', 'Silent', 'Run', 'Deep', 'Lancaster', 'seemed', 'personify', 'embody', 'American', 'ideal', 'hero.However', 'swell', 'guy', 'teeth', 'brandished', 'chest', 'was', 'shrewd', 'actor', 'who', 'seasoned', 'made', 'increasingly', 'interesting', 'choices', 'second', 'half', 'career', 'Lancaster', 'often', 'played', 'off', 'earlier', 'heroic', 'persona', 'admirable', 'risk', 'taking', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'might', 'be', 'aptly', 'described', 'loudly', 'presenting', 'dirty', 'underbelly', 'Americana', 'then', 'Swimmer', 'intimately', 'one-ups', 'them.In', '1968', 'director', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'writer/wife', 'Eleanor', 'Perry', 'adapted', 'John', 'Cheever', 'acclaimed', 'allegorical', 'New', 'Yorker', 'short', 'story', 'Swimmer', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'iconic', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'pathetic', 'hero', 'Perrys', 'had', 'previously', 'teamed', 'equally', 'disturbing', 'David', 'Lisa', '1962', 'made', 'quite', 'splash', 'art', 'film', 'circuit', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'even', 'garnered', 'couple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'enabled', 'team', 'make', 'Swimmer.The', 'Swimmer', 'absurdly', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'Ned', 'Lancaster', 'epitome', 'tanned', 'virile', 'soulless', 'suburbia', 'going', 'enthusiastically', 'embark', 'strange', 'epic', 'connect-the-dot', 'journey', 'swimming', 'home', 'neighborhood', 'swimming', 'pools', 'nubile', 'girl', 'Janet', 'Langard', 'pool', 'facets', 'failed', 'life', 'crack', 'facade', 'slowly', 'expand', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'physical', 'reality', 'Swimmer', 'day', 'Ned', 'life', 'mere', 'allegory', 'allegorical', 'symbolism', 'Ned', 'entire', 'life', 'fact', 'physical', 'realm', 'are', 'drawn.Lancaster', 'sex', 'symbol', 'perfection', 'superficially', 'neighbors', 'back', 'discarded', 'mistress', 'confronted', 'numerous', 'lies', 'betrayals', 'failure', 'husband', 'father', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'time', 'own', 'home', 'paradigm', 'altered', 'cartoon', 'sunshine', 'forced', 'surface', 'smiles', 'despairing', 'rain', 'When', 'porch', 'vulnerable', 'elements', 'mercilessly', 'come', 'down', 'forms', 'including', 'nature', 'Ned', 'ultimately', 'realized', 'hollow', 'state.Impressively', 'Swimmer', 'dreamlike', 'short', 'story', 'episodic', 'pacing', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'medium', 'film', 'uniqueness', 'Swimmer', 'fragile', 'indeed', 'quite', 'odd', 'structure', 'case', 'where', 'casting', 'really', 'counted', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'star', 'Unfortunately', 'Swimmer', 'print', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'briefly', 'available', 'Columbia', 'disrespectfully', 'released', 'cheapo', 'presentation', '*', 'review', 'was', 'originally', 'published', '366', 'weird', 'movies']",N/A

501962,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B00000I1OY,William Timothy Lukeman,"[8, 8]","Burt Lancaster gives one of his finest performances in this piercing adaptation of the John Cheever short story, his impressive physique & bearing providing an ironic & painful contrast to his crumbling self-confidence & disillusion. The film passes like a souring dream, compressing a lifetime into a single searing day, as Lancaster's Ned Merrill is inexorably brought up short by the realities of his life. Piece by piece his illusions & aspirations are stripped away, a process reflected in the increasingly harsh & unflattering lighting of the film.When did it all go wrong for Ned? There are hints that even as a child, he pursued an unreachable ideal. Was he simply too sensitive from the very start? Or were his childhood ideals subsumed in his ego, in the privilege he took for granted? Somewhere along the way, he lost himself in the facade of success he wore like golden armor, which couldn't protect or console him in the end. This is the fate of the American man who buys into an empty dream ... it can only dissolve in the taste of wet ashes. Midlife strikes brutally & unforgivingly for such men.The film is 40 years old, but its message is just as timely as ever. If the superficial trappings of success have changed a bit, their hollow essence remains the same, trapping the latest generation of those who buy into the glittering lie.

At a certain point you hoped that, rising like a phoenix, the movie would redeem itself and at least achieve the level of ""camp.""Alas, not so in the case of ... ""The Swimmah!""When you see a movie like this, you're grateful your vocabulary includes words like horrendous, hideous, dreadful and wretched.  In short, to quote my old Algebra teacher Father Joseph when we messed up an equation: ""P.U. on you!""I used to think, before I saw this movie, that Burt Lancaster, great actor that he was, simply couldn't be in a bad movie.  That his mere presence would make a movie interesting. ... But, alas, not this time, Burtmeister, not this time.  C'est dommage.(By the way, ""C'est dommage"" -- that's French for you peons.)Well, ok, where to begin? ...""The Swimmer"" is a 1968 adaption of one of John Cheever's best short stories.  So why did the geniuses at Columbia Pictures change it?  The screenplay not only deletes key scenes, it also inserts characters into the movie that aren't in Cheever's short story.  (Needless to say, the screenplay was not written by the great John Cheever.)The truth is, this movie could easily have led to a murder.  Not a movie murder but a *real* murder.  See, there's this pool scene in which John Cheever makes a brief cameo appearance, and when Burt Lancaster first notices John Cheever, I swear, there's this look of *fear* in Burt Lancaster's eyes, as if to say: ""Please don't kill me, Mister Cheever.  Please don't strangle me with your bare hands for lousing up your story.""The (you'll-excuse-the-expression) ""highlight"" of this movie is the scene with Burt Lancaster and Joan Rivers.  Yes, that's right, you heard me correctly, Pilgrim: *the* Joan Rivers is in this obnoxious, abominable, abhorrent, repugnant, repulsive, putrid, wretched, awful, disgusting, distasteful movie. ... Like a fish in water, old Joan was!As far as how Joan Rivers looked in 1968, let's put it this way -- rumor has it that one of the plastic surgeons who worked on her back then fled the operating room, sold his home in Beverly Hills and became a Trappist monk.Joan, plays (are you ready for this?) a ""femme fatale.""  Or, more accurately, a suburban floozy.  A suburban floozy who has eyes for Burt Lancaster.Nothing personal, Joan, but you had as much chance with Burt Lancaster as Lassie had with Errol Flynn.ATTENTION! -- BOOGER ALERT! -- BOOGER ALERT! -- BOOGER ALERT!Now I'm going to tell you something about the scene in which Burt and Joan appear that you're not going to believe.  Repeat: that you're *NOT* going to believe.  Nevertheless, it's the Gawd's honest truth.Ready?OK.  Believe it or not, in the scene with Joan Rivers and Burt Lancaster, there's a booger in Burt Lancaster's right nostril.Now, I'm going to repeat that once more -- slowly and clearly -- for the West Coast. ...In Joan Rivers' scene with Burt Lancaster there is a booger, clearly visible, in Burt Lancaster's right nostril.  A big, round, gray booger.I kid you not.And they call Joan Rivers gross!Folks, I'm serious.  I'm as serious as a fat lady trapped in a pastry shop.  I'm as serious as Mickey Rooney schtupping Mother Theresa.  I'm as serious as Donald Trump placing in a frowning contest.I played the Joan Rivers-Burt Lancaster scene three times on my DVD player, and it's there!  The booger lives!  IT'S A-LIVE!!!Evidently, no one in the production company saw it.  But, I mean, is that possible?  Is it possible that no one who worked on this movie saw the booger in Burt's schnozola?Maybe the people who made this movie were so desperate to finish this turkey that they didn't look at *any* of the movie while they were filming it.  That's one theory as to why there's a booger in Burt Lancaster's nose -- because no one in the production company saw it.Still, hard to believe, no?Another theory is that knowing Joan Rivers holds the lifetime achievement award for ""Chronic Bad Taste By a Female Performer in a Nauseating Role,"" could it be that she *insisted* the booger be inserted in Burt's nose, or else she wouldn't do the flick?Not likely.Not likely, in that Joan didn't have that kind of star-power back in '68.  But  nowadays -- nowadays, with Madame Joan's clout stronger than ever -- snot, boogers, ear-hair, eye-mucous.  That crazy b**** can make it happen!  What a performer!  Cue the body fluids!  Action!!!Now, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, there isn't really a booger in Burt Lancaster's nose, ole Sal's making it up, right?  But I swear to you, on the souls of Don Corlieone's semi-legitimate grandchildren, that it's there.  Perhaps someone who reviews this movie after I do will testify on my behalf.  The booger is there.  And in plain sight.Listen, I know, at times, I kid around.  But about a booger?  In a major motion picture?  NO SIR!  (I have my standards!)By the way, in case you think the Burt Lancaster-Joan Rivers scene was the worst scene in the movie, I have more bad news for you.  It wasn't.  There were, in fact, far *worse* scenes.For example, there is a scene -- an *interminable* scene -- toward the end of the movie with Burt Lancaster and Janice Rule that is, without a doubt, the worst-acted, worst-conceived, worst-written, worst-directed, worst-produced, worst-lit, worst-blocked, worst-staged, worst-designed, worst-dubbed, worst-filmed scene in motion picture history.  And that includes when Aristotle made shadow-puppets on the wall of the Parthenon back in 44 B.C. to impress his (Jewish) girlfriend Shirley.  (How else could he score with her?)I read recently that Janice Rule gave up her acting career and became a psychoanalyst.  And, by God, this movie may have done it!Then, there's the ending to the movie.  And, oy vey, what an ending! ... ... At last, we're shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the freakin' denouement of the freakin' Burt Lancaster character.Folks, the ending of this movie went on longer than it took Methusela to count the dough he got from his Social Security check.""OK, WE GET IT!"" I yelled at my teevee screen.  ""Burt Lancaster gets screwed by his entire family.  Enough already!  Please, pleeeeeze, if there's a God in heaven, please let me see those two words 'THE END' before I rent a Kirosawa movie and commit harikari.""And then, finally, it was over.  (Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty I was free at last.)But, you know what.  I didn't feel liberated.  I didn't feel free from this lousy, dreadful, simply *awful* movie.  No, no instead, I felt ... cheap.  And used. ... Tacky and tawdry.I wanted to strip naked and run through the streets proclaiming: ""I AM UNCLEAN!  I AM UNCLEAN!""But it was cold out and I chill easily.Still, as cheap and tawdry as I felt, at least I didn't have a big gray booger in my right nostril.---- CODA ----I'm sorry to keep bringing up this booger-business, but for days after I watched this movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Right there in Burt Lancaster's right nostril: a big fat ole booger.""No,"" I said to myself, ""no, it's not possible that the people who made this movie didn't see it."" ... And then it hit me! ... I bet the people who made this movie got their heads together and said: ""Listen, this movie is so far in the toilet, Ed Norton couldn't save it.  There's obviously nothing we can do to salvage this turkey, so let's reshoot Burt and Joan's scene and this time put a big gray booger in Burt's nose.  You know, mise en scene. And all that crap.""Why? you ask.  Why go the booger route?  Simple: to sell tickets. To save this movie from financial disaster.  To create a buzz about this movie so that people, such as myself, your humble and obedient servant Salvatore (you can call me Sal) say to their friends and associates: ""Hey, wow, did you see the movie with the big booger in Burt Lancaster's right nostril?""Listen, big money was riding on this flicker.  Who knows how desperate the investors were.  Gary Cooper once peed in Cary Grant's swimming pool just to make a point, so why not feature a booger in a Burt Lancaster pool-pic and hope to break even.(Oh, the liquidity.)",1,Not just bad --
