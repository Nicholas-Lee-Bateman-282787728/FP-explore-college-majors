They are not really extended scenes but new scenes added in.  There is not longer version of the wolves running or such but whole new scenes that blend well with the movie. I think they should have been in the original cut.  Allot of films add in extra scenes that quite don't add to the film or slow it down but these added scenes for Part 1 really give the movie added punch!  I just loved watching the bonus scenes. It was also fun not knowing where they will show up so it almost like watching a new movie!...  Get this you won't regret it.I did get my copy on ebay where they had The Twilight Saga Complete Collection Box Set. It has all 5 movies on blu ray plus digital copies of all of them. Also it includes the audio commentary as an option!  And.... It has the Extended Edition of Breaking Dawn Part 1.....The Digital copies on the 5 Movie Box Set are on Cinema Now which is a great free app for storing movies where you can watch them on any device without taking up GB space on your device. They also download. At first I didn't think I would like Cinema Now compared to iTunes but then I saw my Blu Ray player had the option and I can watch my movies at a press of a button from Cinema Now. Its also available on SmartTvs. So it cool to have all the digital copies!

There are some new things like Jacob throwing the &#34;doggy bowl&#34; at Rosalie.  I was disappointed that that scene didn't make it to the final cut of the movie.  Their antagonistic relationship really made the book special, but the movie glossed over it all.  Too bad.

But no, Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate are making us spend more money of getting the film again to see deleted scenes added back into the film in honor of Breaking Dawn Part 2's DVD release.There's more footage somewhere out there that was included in the book and or that was created only for the film that was filmed. Unfortunately, they were deleted and laying in the vault of Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate, which some fans may care and the original 117-minute theatrical version is included on the new edition and you're only get the commentary with the UV/digital copy just like BD:P2's release and you'll lose the remaining extras which will be sadly disappointing.You may also want to keep your previous copy just only for the other extras instead of tossing it out and you'll feel really stupid for tossing your regular edition in the garbage that when you discover that all the other extras are gone, just get the extended edition and/or keep your original DVD copy and watch the deleted footage on YouTube because it's not a two-disc special edition DVD this time around!Update: 2/19/2013: If you finally want to get to see what the eight minutes of footage, you can go to movie-censorship.com and when you are there, you can type in Breaking Dawn- Part 1 and you will see what's in the eight minutes of never before seen footage and if you should or should get the blu-ray or DVD again for just eight minutes!Update: 3/2/2013: Not bad or good use of a extended edition even for eight stinking minutes! Me and my friend learned a very difficult lesson on the cash grab experience especially from Twilight. However, the added scenes gives the movie some kick into it even it's still disappointing and yet mediocre at neither best or worst.
