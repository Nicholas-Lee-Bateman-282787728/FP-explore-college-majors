This is THE Benny Hill collection to get. to get any other you would be doing yourself an injustice. I remember watching Benny Hill on channel 13 in NYC years ago but i obviously missed alot or american tv cut alot. From the first disc to the last i was rolling on the floor laughing my butt off. You will get all the Hills from beginning to end plus the extras are spectacular. the audio video is top notch. I could go on and on about this but trust me,if you like Benny Hill then you must get this.Outstanding,worth every penny or pound.",5,OMG,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,584,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'i', 'bought', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'collection', 'get', 'get', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'injustice', 'remember', 'watching', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'channel', '13', 'NYC', 'years', 'ago', 'obviously', 'missed', 'alot', 'american', 'tv', 'cut', 'alot', 'first', 'disc', 'last', 'i', 'was', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'butt', 'off', 'will', 'get', 'Hills', 'beginning', 'end', 'extras', 'are', 'spectacular', 'audio', 'video', 'top', 'notch', 'could', 'go', 'trust', 'like', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'then', 'must', 'get', 'this.Outstanding', 'worth', 'penny', 'pound']",N/A

Very clean films that were not remastered, but the ones I've played, so far, look good on a 65-inch TV. Keep in mind that they were not wide-screen, but the old, narrow TV format, so, to avoid veiwing distortion, set your wide-screen TV for narrow screen (1.33 to 1) with grayed out vertical bars on the sides.The only negative of &#34;Benny Hill&#34; is that his absurd humor is addictive. Once I started watching, everything planned for the evening was dumped, since I couldn't stop watching this superbly executed humor.An added plus were his female trio singing those ancient songs that us older viewers enjoyed.

1532862,A2TUKTAIY960X7,B007L4HEXE,slappy megee,"[5, 7]","I'm a big fan of Benny Hill and could not wait to watch 48hrs of him!  What you get is six hours repeated eight times,  the gags get more refined the sets more elaborate but basically the shows just repeat with a small amount of different material thrown in so your not totally bored.  The set is packed six dvd's into three cases for a total of eighteen dvd's,  for the set I received this caused damage to the innermost tracks so I wasn't able to watch some bonus material or look at the trivia, but it really did not bother me because what I did see of the ' bonus hill's angel's interviews' these also were repeats of the same theme, I had wanted bonus footage of the show and all I got was filler.  By the time I got to the damage it was too late to return, and I just could not be bothered, it not like i'm going to miss anything.  Amazon was great, shipped promptly, arrived a day early, packed well enough and I was happy with the price of thirty eight dollars,  had I paid the one hundred seventeen I would have felt ripped off .

My favoiteBenny Hill poem bits went something like this.  ""Cleopatra sundered past clasping her little asp and I wondered how those red lips of her's tasted.  Just then one of my friends was heard to snicker EGad she's got an hour glass figure and I said OH YES AND NOT A MINUTE OF IT WASTED!""  Come on weird wit that that is priceless.  Benny Hill was a total joy.  I grew up watching Benny Hill late Sunday nights and my grandmother hated him with a passion which made the pleasure that much more intense.  I was pretty much a good kid, a straight arrow.  I did not do drugs, I drank infrequently and Thank God I never got into trouble with the police.  I felt great that as a teen growing up my watching Benny Hill with all its vulgar sexual overtones drove my very prim proper conservative grandmother over the deep end just a bit.  I was always reminded that I was such a good kid, it was nice to have a big black mark by my name for liking what my grandmother considered painfully vulgar comedy.  Yeah my grandmother was a hard core Christian and she hated Benny Hill but my Grandfather and I loved watching Benny Hill every Sunday Night.  Benny Hill brought me and my Grandfather together as my Grandmother threw up her hands with us MEN!  My watching Benny Hill was the first time my Grandmother lumped me into the lost cause she felt defined the moral baring of most men in the face of pretty ladies.I watched Benny Hill mainly because he was fun.  I had better ways to drive my grandmother crazy and I used them regularly I suspect being autistic and all.  But again buying classic Benny Hill Episodes all at once lets me relive some of the fondest memories of my childhood both on and off the screen.  Benny Hill let's me relive the best parts of my life spent in front of the TV.  As an Autistic Kid I did lots of TV watching.  Watching TV usually helped me learn a lot about this strange world filled with people who do not have autism.  Benny Hill did not teach me much about the world but what Benny taught me was still priceless.  Benny Hill taught me how to laugh at life and see the nasty underside of everyday happenings.  For me to get a Benny Hill Megaset is awesome and certainly worth its price.
