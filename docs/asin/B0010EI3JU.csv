If you're a fan of old TV shows or an airplane freak, this is great.  The plots and storylines are not exceptional except that some are unique to the time period, but the best aspect to me is to the old aircraft (they used actual military clips for many takeoff and flight scenes) and to see the changes we've made in history in the last 50 or so years.  No more cold war!!  Women's rights?  ERA may not have passed but we've come a long way, baby.  I'm happy to sit back and watch these shows and enjoy the old planes, while I laugh at the old lifestyles.This DVD set is specifically to raise money to have the whole Steve Canyon series remastered and released.

1125364,AEOTFNGGN2A9E,B0010EI3JU,Pvt. W.G. Kirby,"[1, 1]","First off, please note the review is not of the special edition DVD alone. Read on:After being ""lost"" since 1960, the TV series ""Steve Canyon"" has returned to the screen. Through the efforts of John Ellis and the Milton Caniff  estate, the series is at last available on DVD. In 2008 a four episode preview was released that told many baby boomers that our USAF hero was coming home. Well, Steve is home. The first two volumes of the episodes from 1958 that made up the only season of the show are issued, and the third and final installment  DVD is soon to appear. What a great effort. and what a great show! Buy these DVDs, you can't go wrong. Read the other reviews...we're all saying the same thing. The image and sound quality are better than the originals due to digital technology. Mr. Ellis has added commentary tracks available for most episodes that just give a wealth of info the the interested viewer as well as tell how and why the show became a one season wonder. NBC dropped the ball there, but the bottom line will always be economics, not the arts.It has been worth the wait to see these again. ""TOP GUN"" of it's day, USAF cooperation obviously helped, along with a cast and crew that wanted to make a quality product. The star, Dean Fredericks simply WAS Steve Canyon. He really looked like the comic strip character. The idea of the program being based on a comic strip somewhat hurt the image and reception of the program with adults in the 1950s; today we would say the adventure series based on the graphic novels of Canyons' exploits. That would help if the series were being pitched-look at ""The Walking Dead"" TV series as case in point. But that's just ""what if?"" reasoning...still, if the superheroes can all be reborn into major theatrical films at the cineplex, it makes me think: ""STEVE CANYON-THE MOVIE"". Boy, he'd be a natural in an F-16 or F15 today!!!You won't be disappointed in this set.

I checked it out on this special edition DVD, and it COMPLETELY blew me away! The first thing that grabs the viewer is that actor Dean Fredericks looks just like his comic pages counterpart, and is fantastic in the role. 4 episodes are present on this special edition and the quality is unbelievable. As I understand it, this was one of the most expensive television shows at the time, and it certainly shows! Action is jammed packed into every story and is beautifully done.

These four selected episodes are as sharp, crisp and clear as any DVD releases of television shows from that period that I've seen. Even perfectionists should find nothing to complain about. If these represent episodes that are not yet ""fully restored,"" the final release of the entire series, fully restored, should be nothing short of spectacular. Even if you are sure that you'll buy the complete series, you should pick up this sampler. It will whet your appetite for more, and you will be contributing to the restoration expenses for the remaining 30 episodes.""Steve Canyon"" is one of the things that inspired me to become an aerospace engineer (my other inspirations were the ""Men Into Space"" television series, Chesley Bonestell's astronomical art and the ""Sky Masters of the Space Force"" comic strip). Watching these four episodes was a most enjoyable trip back in time for me. I still vividly remember a couple of episodes that are not on this Special Edition DVD, and I'm very anxious to see how accurate my memory is when the full series is released. If you've ever even heard the words ""Steve"" and ""Canyon"" used together, you need this DVD.Kudos to John Ellis of the Milton Caniff Estate and to everyone working on this project.

Be you a fan of Caniff, or the titular strip, or the US Air Force, or jet aicraft, you have to be pleased with this. I'm so amped, I cant wait for the complete series to be released. I watched the series when it first aired and I loved it then. I was 8 years old, my dad was in the Air Force, and the F-100 was my favorite airplane (see the first episode on the disc). One memory I have from the series that stayed with me was an episode involving a C-128 Globemaster and a Paratrooper whose chute gets hung up on the rear of the plane. Steve comes up with the idea of having a convertible car follow the plane down the runway and cutting the guy lose before the plane slows down too much so he won't hit the ground. I later joined the AF myself and spent most of some 23 years in SAC around B-52's and KC-135's. I even spent one tour at Castle AFB (see the dedication following the 2nd episode on this disc). The show may seem corny to some now, but if you grew up reading Steve Canyon or remember the Cold War years you should like this series.  The transfers from the original film are so good I don't think I've seen better.
