1058720,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000NOIX6G,Genevieve Hayes,"[3, 4]","There are a lot of murder mystery series, made in the 1980's and 1990's, that essentially follow the same format: each week an ""older"", amateur detective solves a relatively bloodless murder, usually with the help of one or two younger assistants. I'm not criticizing these series, I have been a fan of shows such as ""Murder She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"" since they were first screened. Nevertheless, rewatching many of these shows on DVD, I now realize just how predictable and formulaic many of them are (not that that's a bad thing - there is something comforting about the predictability of these shows). Season two of ""Diagnosis Murder"" also follows this same formula, but it does so in such a way as to stand out from the other shows in this genre.This season of ""Diagnosis Murder"" is funny, innovative and some of the murders are actually a challenge to solve (often I can solve a ""Murder She Wrote"" mystery before the crime has even been committed). Episodes in this season include ""A Very Fatal Funeral"" (in which all of the murder suspects keep dropping dead just as Mark Sloan and his friends become convinced that they're guilty), ""The Busy Body"" (in which a corpse keeps vanishing and reappearing), ""The Bela Lugosi Blues"" (featuring a murderess who may or may not be a vampire), ""Death in the Daytime"" (in which Amanda makes a guest appearance on ""The Young and the Restless"") and ""My Baby is Out of the World"" (in which one of Mark's patients insists that the father of her baby is an alien from another planet), among others. The highlights of this season, however, are ""Many Happy Returns"" and ""Sea No Evil"", which feature Holland Taylor as a very determined IRS agent. Taylor, who later went on to appear as Evelyn Harper in ""Two and a Half Men"", is, as always, a joy to watch and is the perfect foil for Mark Sloan. There is a good reason why the makers of this show asked her back for a second appearance.If you are a fan of shows such as ""Murder She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"", then this DVD set is a must. Murder mystery series don't get much better than this.",5,The best of its kind,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2071,"['are', 'lot', 'murder', 'mystery', 'series', 'made', '1980', '1990', 'essentially', 'follow', 'same', 'format', 'week', 'older', 'amateur', 'detective', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'murder', 'usually', 'help', 'one', 'two', 'younger', 'assistants', ""'m"", 'not', 'criticizing', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'shows', 'such', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Matlock', 'were', 'first', 'screened', 'Nevertheless', 'rewatching', 'many', 'shows', 'DVD', 'now', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'predictable', 'formulaic', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'something', 'comforting', 'predictability', 'shows', 'Season', 'two', 'Diagnosis', 'Murder', 'also', 'same', 'formula', 'so', 'such', 'way', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'shows', 'genre.This', 'season', 'Diagnosis', 'Murder', 'funny', 'innovative', 'murders', 'are', 'actually', 'challenge', 'solve', 'often', 'can', 'solve', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'mystery', 'crime', 'even', 'been', 'committed', 'Episodes', 'season', 'include', 'Very', 'Fatal', 'Funeral', 'murder', 'keep', 'dropping', 'dead', 'just', 'Mark', 'Sloan', 'friends', 'become', 'convinced', ""'re"", 'guilty', 'Busy', 'Body', 'corpse', 'vanishing', 'reappearing', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Blues', 'featuring', 'murderess', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'vampire', 'Death', 'Daytime', 'Amanda', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Young', 'Restless', 'Baby', 'Out', 'World', 'one', 'Mark', 'patients', 'father', 'baby', 'alien', 'planet', 'others', 'highlights', 'season', 'however', 'are', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'Sea', 'No', 'Evil', 'feature', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'very', 'determined', 'IRS', 'agent', 'Taylor', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'appear', 'Evelyn', 'Harper', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Mark', 'Sloan', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'makers', 'show', 'asked', 'back', 'second', 'appearance.If', 'are', 'fan', 'shows', 'such', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Matlock', 'then', 'DVD', 'set', 'must', 'Murder', 'mystery', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",Diagnosis Murder: Season 2

I like the variation in the episodes in that sometimes we know who did it up front and other times we follow Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) to the resolution. This season has the cast acting more comfortably with each other and their roles and the murders have a little more mystery to them.
