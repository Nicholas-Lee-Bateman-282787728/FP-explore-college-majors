As far as quality goes...it's good, but not as good as some. It's very watchable and very worth the price. Watching it makes you feel more like you're watching an old 50's tv show and not from 1965, that's the reason I give it only four stars. It's 3 disc and has 3 special extras, one on each disc. It's a Marathon Music and Video release by KingWorld. For those of you that love old tv westerns, this DVD set is for you. This is a show that's not seen much anymore and I was surprised to see it out on DVD. It's black and white with some color episodes. The shows all run a little over 22 minutes long, the Four star playhouse runs over 25 minutes and the short bio runs 5 minutes and 50 seconds. I love watching these for they bring back great memories of the sixties. The following is the list of episodes and the special extras. You won't be sorry in buying this set...trust me.

813328,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B0001US8DU,E. Hornaday,"[30, 33]","I disagree with a reviewer who basically criticized this TV western for being dated. To me, it's a fresh and original today as it was when it aired in 1965-1966.The star, Chuck Connors (best known for his riveting portrayal of Lucas McCain in &quot;The Rifleman,&quot;) gives an equally compelling performance here as Captain Jason McCord.McCord, a West Point graduate, is the sole survivor of an Indian battle at Bitter Creek in the 1800s. Court-martialed as a coward who ran, he was forever &quot;branded&quot; with that stigma and thrown out of the Army, his rank insignia ripped off and his Cavalry sabre broken in two in a military ceremony casting him out of the fort. The humiliating scene was replayed as the opening clip of each episode as a moving western ballad &quot;Branded&quot; was sung over the images.McCord, who is actually a man of deep conviction and principle, pleaded innocent but refused to testify in his own defense.  As the series progresses, we learn that he did so to protect the memory of the honorable General Reid whose eventual senility resulted in what actually occured at Bitter Creek, and also to protect a peace treaty with the Indians. McCord believes that if those politicians who did not want peace learned that General Reid, who had negotiated the treaty, was unfit, they would nullify the document and resume the Indian war.Thus, McCord accepts his cruel label and fate, forced to live a nomadic life moving from survey job to job (a skill he learned in the military) because of the hatred people have for him. As far as the general public is concerned, McCord ran off to save his life, abandoning those under his command to all die at Bitter Creek.Remarkably, the series is able to explore in a sophisticated manner the true meaning of bravery and right and wrong as McCord seeks to help those in trouble whom he encounters. Everyone who deals with McCord ends up understanding that the coward's label pinned on him is far from correct, and that he is a man of grit, bravery and honor.In some ways, the themes of this series are similar to those explored in Kung Fu almost a decade later: lessons of morality, spirituality, honesty, bravery and the fundamental meaning of right and wrong and personal responsibility presented through the accessible medium of a western.This show's unforgettable ballad, music by Dominic Frontiere, lyrics by Alan Alch, entones in part: ""All but one man died there at Bitter Creek, and they say he ran away... Not a single charge was true... Branded, marked with a coward's shame, what do you do when you're branded, will you fight to clear your name?""Sixteen of the 48 half-hour episodes produced are released in this three-disc set.

McCord is the lone survivor of a battle against Indians. Since he is the only survivor, everyone assumes he must have run away rather than fight to the finish. You'll have to watch the show to actually figure out what happened during the Battle of Bitter Creek.Since McCord has been dishonorably discharged from the Army, he now roams the Wild West with his broken saber and tarnished name. Every where he goes, people immediately recognize the name Jason McCord as the coward who abandoned his comrades at Bitter Creek. At the sight of McCord, children mock him, men stare at him in disgust, and women turn their heads in shame. McCord copes with the constant humiliation with dignity and patience. McCord is constantly tormented by his past. Nothing can be worse for a brave and honorable man than to be viewed as coward who is worse than a criminal. There is always some unsavory character who tries to exploit the negative stereotype of McCord in order to further his own unscrupulous plans. The townspeople are caught in the middle and must try to determine who is the lesser of two evils. In the end McCord always prevails and leaves the town winning new hearts and minds.The first season is actually half a season with only 16 episodes. The first series aired from January of 1965 to May of 1965. The show did pretty well by finishing number 14 in the ratings. The quality of the video and audio are not that great. The acting is pretty good and the shooting locations look authentic. I wouldn't say the show is as good as Gunsmoke but it is definitely worth buying. Since Gunsmoke is a 5 star show, I can only give Branded 4 stars. I would buy it while it is available.

813345,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0001US8DU,trebe,"[2, 2]","Chuck Connors had great success, starring in The Rifleman, from 1958 through1963.  The athletic Connors returned to television in Branded (1965).  The series follows the adventures of disgraced West Point army Captain Jason McCord, notorious for being a coward.  The series opens with McCord ceremoniously being stripped of his rank, his saber broken, and then being kicked out an army fort.  A basic explanation is provided by the series theme song, which describes how McCord the only survivor of a massacre at Bitter Creek, is wrongfully believed to have run away and let his comrades perish.In the second episode of the series, `The Vindicators`, some of the mystery surrounding the events at Bitter Creek are clarified, but interestingly McCord himself does not know what the exact truth is.  General James Reed, the commander of the unit, was mentally incompetent.  McCord as the second in command, attempted to relieve the general of command, order a withdraw, and prevent a massacre by the Apache.  During the battle, McCord mysteriously blacked out, awakening to find that and everyone else in the unit has been killed.  In the aftermath, rather than have his friend the General's reputation suffer, and risk the peace with the Indians, McCord offers no defense at his court martial.Becoming a drifter, rarely working a steady job, McCord travels from place to place, his past inevitably comes up again and again, often being a catalyst for trouble.  Although he does not have a tricked out weapon like Lucas McCain's Winchester, McCord is very skilled with a gun, and has no problems using one when necessary.  He has a bit of a temper, from constantly being harassed about his past, and at times strikes back with real venom.  And Chuck Connors has one mean, scary stare.  Created by Larry Cohen (Phone Booth, Q), the theme of an honorable man's struggle against prejudice and injustice is explored in an interesting variety of ways, usually without getting overdramatic or heavy-handed.There is a nice cross-section of guest stars from the period.  Johnny Crawford, who was also in The Rifleman, guests in the episode, 'The Coward Steps Aside'.  The gifted actress June Lockhart, and Claude Akins appear in 'The Vindicators'.  Tommy Sands plays a West Point cadet looking to find the truth about Bitter Creek in 'That the Brave Endure', and Chad Everett has a dual role in 'The First Kill'.Branded debuted midseason, in January of 1965, so there are just 16 episodes in the first season.  They are in black and white, except for the three part adventure, 'The Mission'.  Image quality is a little faded at times, but the source material appears to be pretty clean, and still looks quite good for the most part.  There are some bonus materials, including an episode of the Rifleman, an episode of Four Star Playhouse featuring Chuck Connors in a supporting role, and a short Chuck Connors biography.  Dominic Frontiere provided the music for the series, and some of the themes used in Branded, were also featured in The Rat Patrol.  Although the first season was abbreviated, the program was popular enough to be renewed for a second full season.",3,chuck connors returns to television with a chip on his shoulder . . .,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3157,"['Chuck', 'Connors', 'had', 'great', 'success', 'starring', 'Rifleman', '1958', 'through1963', 'athletic', 'Connors', 'returned', 'television', 'Branded', '1965', 'series', 'adventures', 'disgraced', 'West', 'Point', 'army', 'Captain', 'Jason', 'McCord', 'notorious', 'being', 'coward', 'series', 'McCord', 'ceremoniously', 'being', 'stripped', 'rank', 'saber', 'broken', 'then', 'being', 'kicked', 'out', 'army', 'fort', 'basic', 'explanation', 'provided', 'series', 'theme', 'song', 'how', 'McCord', 'only', 'survivor', 'massacre', 'Bitter', 'Creek', 'wrongfully', 'believed', 'have', 'run', 'away', 'let', 'comrades', 'perish.In', 'second', 'episode', 'series', 'Vindicators', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'events', 'Bitter', 'Creek', 'are', 'clarified', 'interestingly', 'McCord', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'exact', 'truth', 'General', 'James', 'Reed', 'commander', 'unit', 'was', 'mentally', 'incompetent', 'McCord', 'second', 'command', 'attempted', 'relieve', 'general', 'command', 'order', 'withdraw', 'prevent', 'massacre', 'Apache', 'battle', 'McCord', 'mysteriously', 'blacked', 'out', 'awakening', 'find', 'everyone', 'else', 'unit', 'been', 'killed', 'aftermath', 'rather', 'have', 'friend', 'General', 'reputation', 'suffer', 'risk', 'peace', 'Indians', 'McCord', 'defense', 'court', 'martial.Becoming', 'drifter', 'rarely', 'working', 'steady', 'job', 'McCord', 'place', 'place', 'past', 'inevitably', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'often', 'being', 'catalyst', 'trouble', 'not', 'have', 'tricked', 'out', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'Winchester', 'McCord', 'very', 'skilled', 'gun', 'problems', 'using', 'one', 'when', 'necessary', 'bit', 'temper', 'constantly', 'being', 'harassed', 'past', 'times', 'strikes', 'back', 'real', 'venom', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'one', 'mean', 'scary', 'stare', 'Created', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Q', 'theme', 'honorable', 'man', 'struggle', 'prejudice', 'injustice', 'explored', 'interesting', 'variety', 'ways', 'usually', 'getting', 'overdramatic', 'heavy-handed.There', 'nice', 'cross-section', 'guest', 'stars', 'period', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Rifleman', 'episode', 'Coward', 'Steps', 'Aside', 'gifted', 'actress', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'appear', ""'The"", 'Vindicators', 'Tommy', 'Sands', 'West', 'Point', 'cadet', 'looking', 'find', 'truth', 'Bitter', 'Creek', ""'That"", 'Brave', 'Endure', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'dual', 'role', ""'The"", 'First', ""Kill'.Branded"", 'debuted', 'midseason', 'January', '1965', 'are', 'just', '16', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'three', 'part', 'adventure', 'Mission', 'Image', 'quality', 'little', 'faded', 'times', 'source', 'material', 'be', 'pretty', 'clean', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'episode', 'Rifleman', 'episode', 'Four', 'Star', 'Playhouse', 'featuring', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'supporting', 'role', 'short', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'biography', 'Dominic', 'Frontiere', 'provided', 'music', 'series', 'themes', 'used', 'Branded', 'were', 'also', 'featured', 'Rat', 'Patrol', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'abbreviated', 'program', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'be', 'renewed', 'second', 'full', 'season']",Branded - The Complete First Season
