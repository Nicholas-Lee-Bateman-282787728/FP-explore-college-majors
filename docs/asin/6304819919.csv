The viewer will see what happened behind closed doors after Lawrence returned to Europe in an attempt to further the Arab independence cause.Fiennes is a great choice for T.E. Lawrence.  His expressions speak volumes of all the things running through Lawrence's head as he tried to fight the agenda of France and Great Britain.  In his interaction with his Arab counterpart, you see that he does not always share what he is thinking and that his fame is beginning to cause some trouble for him.Although a fine movie, you really need to know a bit about this time and the events to really understand it all.  Mentioned in the movies is Lawrence's book ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" which would be helpful.I would recommend watching this movie.",4,A little research will help you,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,856,"['movie', 'not', 'have', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'had', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'viewer', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'Lawrence', 'returned', 'Europe', 'attempt', 'further', 'Arab', 'independence', 'cause.Fiennes', 'great', 'choice', 'T.E', 'Lawrence', 'expressions', 'speak', 'volumes', 'things', 'running', 'Lawrence', 'head', 'tried', 'fight', 'agenda', 'France', 'Great', 'Britain', 'interaction', 'Arab', 'counterpart', 'see', 'not', 'always', 'share', 'what', 'thinking', 'fame', 'beginning', 'cause', 'trouble', 'him.Although', 'fine', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'bit', 'time', 'events', 'really', 'understand', 'Mentioned', 'movies', 'Lawrence', 'book', 'Seven', 'Pillars', 'Wisdom', 'would', 'be', 'helpful.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie']",Dangerous Man VHS

If you're looking for the greatest film of all  time, Lawrence of Arabia is it! It gives the viewer insight into Lawrence's  personality as well as the history of the time. Ralph Fiennes is not a bad  actor, but he has a tendency, both in this movie and in The English  Patient, to immitate Peter O'Toole! By the way, I suggest you watch  Lawrence of Arabia first and then The English Patient in order to see how  much the David Lean epic has influenced modern movies.

436399,A38ELBK7FLXGOY,6304819919,Richard Wells,"[85, 92]","If all we had of T.E. Lawrence were David Lean's epic ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" we'd have fodder for generations of romantics, but despite its sumptuousness it relies heavily on the previous mythmaking of Lowell Thomas, and Lawrence's own dissembling in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom.""  ""A Dangerous Man,"" offers a corrective without destroying the myth, by giving us a deeper portrait of Lawrence, and a more factual take on his desert adventures.World War One found its raison d'etre only after the war was declared.  The assassination of a Serbian Archduke was the catalyst, but the war itself became a grab for resources, and in the mid-east, a continuation of the Great Game the superpowers had been playing for years.  Rather than restricting the game to Afghanistan though, the entire region opened up for a land-grab of huge proportions, and the ill-fated peace conference in Versailles became the ultimate playing field.  Lloyd George and Clemenceau represented ""old Europe's"" wheeling, dealing, and chicanery; while Woodrow Wilson represented the somewhat bumbling, idealistic, and ridiculed ideals of American self-determination as an unrealistic alternative to a world steeped in colonization.  Lawrence and his Prince Feisal were the wild cards, and they played their cards like world-class sharks.""A Dangerous Man,"" is a top-notch movie, intelligently written, flawlessly directed, and superbly acted.  It's one of the few celluloid histories that find fact more interesting than fiction, and it also serves as an interesting primer to recent events.My recommendation is unqualified; this is a movie worth seeing and talking about.",5,An Unqualified Recommendation,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,1636,"['had', 'T.E', 'Lawrence', 'were', 'David', 'Lean', 'epic', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', ""'d"", 'have', 'fodder', 'generations', 'romantics', 'sumptuousness', 'heavily', 'previous', 'mythmaking', 'Lowell', 'Thomas', 'Lawrence', 'own', 'dissembling', 'Seven', 'Pillars', 'Wisdom', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'corrective', 'destroying', 'myth', 'giving', 'deeper', 'portrait', 'Lawrence', 'more', 'factual', 'take', 'desert', 'adventures.World', 'War', 'One', 'found', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'only', 'war', 'was', 'declared', 'assassination', 'Serbian', 'Archduke', 'was', 'catalyst', 'war', 'became', 'grab', 'resources', 'mid-east', 'continuation', 'Great', 'Game', 'superpowers', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'years', 'Rather', 'restricting', 'game', 'Afghanistan', 'entire', 'region', 'opened', 'up', 'land-grab', 'huge', 'proportions', 'ill-fated', 'peace', 'conference', 'Versailles', 'became', 'ultimate', 'playing', 'field', 'Lloyd', 'George', 'Clemenceau', 'represented', 'old', 'Europe', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'chicanery', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'represented', 'somewhat', 'bumbling', 'idealistic', 'ridiculed', 'ideals', 'American', 'self-determination', 'unrealistic', 'alternative', 'world', 'steeped', 'colonization', 'Lawrence', 'Prince', 'Feisal', 'were', 'wild', 'cards', 'played', 'cards', 'world-class', 'sharks', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'top-notch', 'movie', 'intelligently', 'written', 'flawlessly', 'directed', 'superbly', 'acted', 'one', 'few', 'celluloid', 'histories', 'find', 'fact', 'more', 'interesting', 'fiction', 'also', 'interesting', 'primer', 'recent', 'events.My', 'recommendation', 'unqualified', 'movie', 'seeing', 'talking']",Dangerous Man VHS

Reviewer,"[0, 0]","This is the story of Lawrence after the war.The plot is based upon actual events -- Lawrence trying to help the Arabs gain their independence in 1920 from England and France at the Paris Peace Conference.Where Lawrence of Arabia (with Peter O'Toole) had great characters and great dialog, this film has none of that.The plot meanders through the Paris Peace Conference and portrays Lawrence (who was very intelligent and a shrewd strategist) continually being out maneuvered by politicians -- which was historically true -- and the luster of his fame was gone.The question remains: Why the film's title &#34;A Dangerous Man&#34;?  Lawrence was a dangerous man during the First World War, but afterwards he was politically impotent.
