75176,A103KNDW8GN92L,0784011230,David Hugaert,"[14, 17]","&quot;Lock Up&quot; features a strong cast with the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Donald Sutherland, John Amos, Tom Sizemore and Sonny Landham. Stallone portrays Frank Leone, who must serve the remaining six months of his sentence at a minimum security correctional facility. Leone's cell is ransacked in the middle of the night and is taken into custody against his will by security guards from a maximum security prison, where Leone is escorted and is promptly given the guided tour of hell. The viewer, as well as Leone, is then given an explanation of Leone's transfer, courtesy of one evil Warden Drumgoole, played by Sutherland. The tone of the movie is set upon Drumgoole's intense greeting: &quot;Welcome to Gateway, Leone&quot;. It's payback time, according to the warden, whose administration was publicly humiliated by Leone, whom Warden Drumgoole makes sure never has another pleasureable moment during Leone's sentence. Leone's stay isn't entirely unbearable, for there are a few bright spots here, as our beloved convict-hero makes some fast friends in the prison autobody shop, with the likes of Eclipse (Frank McRae), Dallas (Tom Sizemore) and First Base (Larry Romano). It is here where these individuals share a common bond of friendship, including their love of cars, which is one of &quot;Lock Up's&quot; few tender moments. Ah, but there can't be friends without enemies, can there? Frank finds his enemy at a prison football game, where he is brutally roughhoused by one Chink Weber (Sonny Landham). Things don't get any easier for Leone, as he is constantly belittled and brutally assaulted by Drumgoole's staff. Overall, this is a strong film, with some believable characters, although the plot in certain spots is somewhat weak and unbelievable. For instance, I find it hard to believe that a prison autobody shop, such as this, displays little or no security, as well as a large maximum security prison, like this one, being overseen by just one warden, who, out of hundreds and hundreds of inmates, is so obsessed with just one of them. I'm sure the warden has other responsibilities to be concerned about, which I'm sure are many. But, the one good thing about watching a film of this caliber is that the warden's obsession with one man builds an intense climax that leaves the viewer on the edge of his/her seat the entire length of the movie, thus craving more substantial thrills and dialog. &quot;Lock Up&quot; contains all of the above, and is one film you're sure to come back to time and again. Plus, no other actor can bring more to an action-thriller quite like Sly Stallone, although &quot;Lock Up&quot; probably isn't his best role. That honor would have to go to his Rambo and Rocky roles.

75179,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,0784011230,G. Garner,"[2, 4]","Stallone is old-school. A legitimate movie star. You think real movie star, you think Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Elizabeth Taylor,John Wayne, Bette Davis..........in other words, somebody larger than life. Somebody who can carry a movie with screen presense and force of personality.Of course, contemporary critics sneer at this phenomenon. They claim that 'real' actors should be able to play any role. Granted, having that chameleonic quality of a DeNiro is impressive. But the ability to play any type of part means nothing to me, because I'm not willing to sit through just ANY kind of film.Guys like Stallone, Eastwood, John Wayne...........they specialize in one type of role. At anything else, they may be just average, or even below average. But in their own arena, they reign supreme.Having said that, I am a huge Stallone fan, and I regard Lockup as just about his best film aside from what he is best known for(the Rocky and Rambo series.) In fairness, I like Cliffhanger a little better, but it is more of an action spectacle. The stunts and the mountains are the real stars of that one.But Lockup is a stronger showcase for Stallone and his talents. This is the type of film where he is at his best-a traditional drama, but with moments of heavy action and violence. Again, as in Rocky, he plays an inherently decent man who perseveres and eventually triumphs, as much through force of will and character as through any feat of his muscles. When it comes to this type of character-a man who combines brutish physicality and power,on the one hand,  with a sort of grace and decency on the other-Stallone is as effective as anyone.This is his realm, and he is unrivalled here. He is completely believable in even the most challenging of action sequences. He is utterly authentic when he has to carry out an act of violence, no matter how brutal(recall the 'stalactite' scene in Cliffhanger). But, on many occasions, he is also the embodiment of what could be called the 'softer' virtues. Seriously, was there EVER a more gracious or goodhearted character than Rocky Balboa? A kinder husband, a gentler father, a more loyal friend?Stallone brings a lot of these traits to his performance in Lockup. His own real-life force of will and character shine through in his interpretation of Leone. This movie is a good fit for Stallone. He has made some questionable choices in selecting his projects through the years.(remember Rhinestone? or Oscar?) But this one really suits him.There is a moment, right at the beginning of the movie, where he is looking through some old photos. And he has this sort of gentle, nostalgic smile on his face. It is a warm, sentimental scene. Then, later in the film, after his buddy is crushed under a barbell, we see a different side. The fury he displays over the younger man's murder is tangible. And the power he brings to the table in going after the killer-a much larger man-is overwhelming.Not many people are as authentic when the scene calls for gentle reflection. Few can match his authenticity when the scene calls for primal masculinity. But there is NO ONE who combines the two like Stallone. He is a legitimate original, and one of the very few real movie stars we have left.",5,One of Stallone's Finest Performances,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,3259,"['Stallone', 'old-school', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'star', 'think', 'real', 'movie', 'star', 'think', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'other', 'words', 'somebody', 'larger', 'life', 'Somebody', 'who', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'screen', 'presense', 'force', 'personality.Of', 'course', 'contemporary', 'critics', 'sneer', 'phenomenon', 'claim', ""'real"", 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'role', 'Granted', 'having', 'chameleonic', 'quality', 'DeNiro', 'impressive', 'ability', 'play', 'type', 'part', 'nothing', ""'m"", 'not', 'willing', 'sit', 'just', 'ANY', 'kind', 'film.Guys', 'Stallone', 'Eastwood', 'John', 'Wayne', '..they', 'specialize', 'one', 'type', 'role', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'average', 'even', 'average', 'own', 'arena', 'reign', 'supreme.Having', 'said', 'am', 'huge', 'Stallone', 'fan', 'regard', 'Lockup', 'just', 'best', 'film', 'aside', 'what', 'best', 'known', 'Rocky', 'Rambo', 'series', 'fairness', 'like', 'Cliffhanger', 'little', 'better', 'more', 'action', 'spectacle', 'stunts', 'mountains', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'one.But', 'Lockup', 'stronger', 'showcase', 'Stallone', 'talents', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'best-a', 'traditional', 'drama', 'moments', 'heavy', 'action', 'violence', 'Again', 'Rocky', 'inherently', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'eventually', 'triumphs', 'much', 'force', 'will', 'character', 'feat', 'muscles', 'When', 'type', 'character-a', 'man', 'who', 'brutish', 'physicality', 'power', 'one', 'hand', 'sort', 'grace', 'decency', 'other-Stallone', 'as', 'effective', 'anyone.This', 'realm', 'unrivalled', 'here', 'completely', 'believable', 'even', 'most', 'challenging', 'action', 'sequences', 'utterly', 'authentic', 'when', 'carry', 'out', 'act', 'violence', 'matter', 'how', 'brutal', 'recall', ""'stalactite"", 'scene', 'Cliffhanger', 'many', 'occasions', 'also', 'embodiment', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', ""'softer"", 'virtues', 'Seriously', 'was', 'there', 'EVER', 'more', 'gracious', 'goodhearted', 'character', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'A', 'kinder', 'husband', 'gentler', 'father', 'more', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Stallone', 'lot', 'traits', 'performance', 'Lockup', 'own', 'real-life', 'force', 'will', 'character', 'shine', 'interpretation', 'Leone', 'movie', 'good', 'fit', 'Stallone', 'made', 'questionable', 'choices', 'selecting', 'projects', 'years', 'remember', 'Rhinestone', 'Oscar', 'one', 'really', 'suits', 'moment', 'right', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'looking', 'old', 'photos', 'sort', 'gentle', 'nostalgic', 'smile', 'face', 'warm', 'sentimental', 'scene', 'Then', 'later', 'film', 'buddy', 'crushed', 'barbell', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'fury', 'younger', 'man', 'murder', 'tangible', 'power', 'table', 'going', 'killer-a', 'much', 'larger', 'man-is', 'overwhelming.Not', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'authentic', 'when', 'scene', 'gentle', 'reflection', 'Few', 'can', 'match', 'authenticity', 'when', 'scene', 'primal', 'masculinity', 'ONE', 'who', 'two', 'Stallone', 'legitimate', 'original', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'real', 'movie', 'stars', 'have', 'left']",N/A

Frank Leone is an ordinary man forced into avenging thugs who beat-up his kindly old mentor. He's put in prison for the crime but escapes just before his sentence is up so he can be with the old man at his deathbed. His escape and subsequent publicity shames Warden Drumgoole (a very evil Donald Sutherland), who is blacklisted with in the Penal system. Leone serves out his remaining six months in a cozy, minimum security facility and dreams of returning home to his girlfriend. In the middle of the night he is dragged from his bed and taken to Drumgoole's new domain; Gateway, the worst prison in America. Drumgoole intends to make Leone serve very, very hard time, pushing him to his limits in hope that he might lash out and thus extend his sentence.It goes through a lot of prison movie cliches, and I guess it doesn't really stand out against the better or more exciting movies in the genre. It entertains and is occasionally engaging, but is by no means a classic. The animosity between Leone and Drumgoole is interesting, and the casting of crazy Sonny Landham as the yard boss is quite scary, but again, these are all cliches. Stallone brought back Bill Conti (his old pal from the Rocky movies) to score the movie, but he effort is totally inappropriate and the light touch to the music spoils the intensity of many scenes. A different composer might have resulted in a more memorable movie. You'll never really feel the need to revisit Lock Up after a single viewing.The Blu Ray looks decent in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound.

Who says you have to take the movie seriously...just enjoy it; I think we all realize that what happens in this movie would never happen in real life, and that's what makes it so cool. I say Lock Up is one of Stallone's more memorable movies for me although it is one of his lesser known roles. This movie probably wouldn't be good if it were played by anyone other than Stallone, but it isn't so it's great. Stallone plays Frank Leone, a man serving a short and normal prison sentence, when he is suddenly and inexplicably sent to Gateway, a hell-hole of a prison, with the evil Warden Drumgoole in charge, played very well by Donald Sutherland. Drumgoole employs a bully named Chink, (played by Sonny Landham) to make sure Leone's time at Gateway is as unpleasant as possible. The most memorable moment in the film for me is when Leone goes after Chink when he crosses the line. On the front of the DVD one critic states, ""A surprisingly human film."" I must agree. You really start to feel for Frank Leone after he is given such a hard time, and you want to see him exact his revenge like only Stallone can.Stallone just has a certain aura about him, ya know?

75205,A3UA046AA3DXFD,0784011230,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","In Lockup, the old boy Sly Stallone, plays a prisoner named Frank Leone. Leone is without question the most beloved tragic figure in modern American cinema. He is a rough and tumble yet lovable parpadelle and brocolli eating machanic who remarks on a nice kiss from his girlfriend by simply saying ""that's Italian."" It doesn't really make any sense to us, either. But it makes sense to Leone, and that's just going to have to be good enough.Anyway, Leone was originally arrested for beating up some punks who are terrorizing his mechanic mentor for whom he cares deeply. He is sent to Treadmore, a prison run by the evil Warden Drumgoole. For some reason Drumgoole has it out for Frank, so he won't let Leone have a weekend furlough to see his mentor who is close to dying. Leone escapes, humiliating and enraging Drumgoole. When Frank turns himself back in, he is sent to a decent minimum security prison where he is let out on weekends and the guards talk football and cars with him. And he's only got a couple more months left on his sentance. Suddenly, as revenge, Drumgoole gets Leone transfered to his new prison, Gateway. This place is no joke; definately maximum security, with a twist. To help exact his revenge, Drumgoole employs the thugish tactics of Sid's all-time favorite hooligan, prisoner Chink Webber. This guy haunts Leone throughout the whole movie,trying to antagonize Leone into fighting and getting more time tacked onto his sentance. He does everything short of forcing Leone to eat corned beef and cabbage. He even rips off Frank's chain with the mallichio horn on it. And who can forget the famous football scene?As you can tell, this is one of Sid's all-time favorite movies. However, this film did NOT recieve its due ammount of critical acclaim or box-office sucess. We, Sid the Elf, have just one question: why? Lockup has everything you can ask for in a movie. Sid just can't get enough of the ledgendary Chink Webber, who gives us so many great lines. For example ""Move it Ace, that's my spot,"" and ""When are you going to paint your nails and start answering to the name (explitive deleted)?"" You have First Base, who contributes a heaping helping of comedy just by speaking. There's the immortal Eclipse, who touches the heart when the solitary tear rolls down his face at witnessing the destruction of his baby, Maybeline(a car by the way). And, if the room doesn't get officially dusty when Leone is seemingly caught trying to escape because his close friend, Deep-fried Dallas rats him out then you have no soul.We could go on for pages and pages on Lockup because it is one of Sid the Elf's favorite movies. We were discussing this during our current screening, which kicked off our Stallone season, and we are putting it behind only the zenith of B Death Ring. So, naturally, Lockup gets the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval. See this movie! You'll thank us, yet again.

There's just something about Sylvester Stallone.  He has to go far out of his way to find a real stinker for me not to like it.  (Judge Dred might qualify for that honor).Anyway, the story begins: he has gotten into trouble via a questionable urge to come to the defense of an underdog in a bar squabble and has been given time, but serving it as honor time.  He has just weeks to go to finish it out, has been a model prisoner because he really shouldn't be in there to begin with - when lo and behold, he is spirited out in the middle of the night without ceremony by some fearsome dudes in Prison Guard Uniforms and bulldog expressions creasing their lips.

Just by myself, I can think of three (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest) that are spectacular.  This film won't break that trend, but it just barely squeaks by in the task.For a basic plot summary, Lock Up sees Frank Leone (Sylvester Stallone), a minimum-security prisoner, transported to a ""hard time"" type facility by Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland), who is intent on torturing Leone for a past transgression.  While in the slammer, Leone is pushed to the very brink of his sanity, and quite possibly beyond.In terms of overall quality, this movie isn't all that bad at all.  It has some decent drama, some funny/interesting characters, and at least a semblance of a romantic angle that will emotionally draw some people into the film.  Of course, for action/Stallone buffs, there are plenty of fight scenes and muscle-bearing to satisfy you, too.Here is the main problem that bogs this movie down to ""average"": the ""relationship"" between Leone and Drumgoole (the key players in the film) is so far-fetched as to be laughable.  The Warden explicitly orders both the physical and emotional torture of Leone time and time again, to the point where I could not believe that even the most sadistic of Wardens could ever get away with something like that.  Sutherland's character is turned into little more than a grinning, glaring, Nazi-like figure with no other dimensions.Thus, if you are a big fan of this type of ""behind bars"" drama, this movie will likely do it for you.
