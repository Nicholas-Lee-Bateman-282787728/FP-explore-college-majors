The last 10-15 minutes (somewhere in there) of 'Angels and Demons' is about 10 seconds or so out of sync between the audio and video.  Other than that, this is a great series.  I always make a point to watch this on A&E, but now I don't have to.  This is a wonderful series chronicling children/young adults (aged 8 to 19) who have or believe they have psychic abilities.  I do believe things such as this are possible, but I will admit it is remotely possible it is faked.  I will say that all these young people do seem genuine, and I do believe they have the abilities they say they have.  It is a very well done series; whether you believe this or not, check this out.  It may change your mind.",5,Good series,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,729,"['Ok', 'let', 'start', 'bad', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'somewhere', ""'Angels"", 'Demons', '10', 'seconds', 'so', 'sync', 'audio', 'video', 'Other', 'great', 'series', 'always', 'make', 'point', 'watch', 'A', 'E', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wonderful', 'series', 'chronicling', 'children/young', 'adults', 'aged', '8', '19', 'who', 'have', 'believe', 'have', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'do', 'believe', 'things', 'such', 'are', 'possible', 'will', 'admit', 'remotely', 'possible', 'faked', 'will', 'say', 'young', 'people', 'do', 'seem', 'genuine', 'do', 'believe', 'have', 'abilities', 'say', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'series', 'believe', 'not', 'check', 'out', 'may', 'change', 'mind']",Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal

One of the ""caring experts"" is the great Chip Coffee (the phychic who appears in almost every episode of Paranormal State). It is very well done, and seems to really help these young kids. It is a very interesting and entertaining program.",5,Great program in this genre,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,275,"['have', 'watched', 'program', 'A', 'E', 'One', 'caring', 'experts', 'great', 'Chip', 'Coffee', 'phychic', 'who', 'almost', 'episode', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'help', 'young', 'kids', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'program']",Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal
1173877,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001C28ZDE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","PSYCHIC KIDS: CHILDREN OF THE PARANORMAL (2008 release, either a 'best of' or the entire season, I'm not sure but it is a full 2-DVD set, check Amazon's details). And by the way, you can get this at bestbuy on sale for $5.99. Forget trying to maneuver the atrocious A&E; site.PSYCHIC KIDS is the one ""paranormal""-oriented psychic-medium TV show I appreciate, because it consists of a team of well-intentioned adults helping psychic children. These kids come from homes that range the whole spectrum, from loving/all-accepting to practically hating the kids for their gifts. The psychologist and the psychic, then, work as a team to help and support the kids. Those kids' ""training"" as psychics begins on these shows.Overall, I'm reviewing all three PSYCHIC KIDS: CHILDREN OF THE PARANORMAL DVDs Amazon has available as of this date. This is what I have reviewed because it's all there is:The Ghost of Freddieepisode which is also found here:A&E; -- Psychic Kids: The Ghost Of Freddie Dvd, episodeGhost School, and this, 2008's ""Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal"", which consists of about five or six hours and is a 2-disc set. This DVD trouble with the series is a mess, and I simply don't care what Amazon has in stock anymore. They don't list things right. I would not advise checking out the awful A&E; site.This series itself has always delighted me, though I can get a little hot under the collar sometimes with some of the stunts they pull. This is a series about teens (sometimes preteens) with apparent clairvoyant abilities. They are brought together with a psychic ~ it was Chip Coffey until 2010, after which he left the show; the last couple of years it has been the much-hated Chris Fleming.There is also an alleged child psychologist on hand (the original one left with Coffey in 2010 and was replaced). I never know what to feel about the two or three psychologists that have served as cast members over the years. This is not something I discuss at all but I will say it here: I and my large family are clairvoyant to varying degrees. We don't even speak of it amongst ourselves. Related to that, I also have a history with psychologists and dislike them deeply.That might make me cynical or even skeptical. I do not know what sort of education, science or general benefit may come from a show like this for the kids who appear in it. Though I think it's good, I also believe some of these episodes are staged, since I have seen the new series ""Ghost Mine"" and I know one of the miner's kids has been on PSYCHIC KIDS. But I love watching it.Frankly, I see those kids and they remind me of myself at their ages. Some of them are trembling with fear, looking whacked out on drugs ~ but I assure you, it is always a combination of lack of sleep, loss of appetite, nasty-minded parents and kids picking on them. It is almost never drugs, because that just makes things worse. I can speak from experience as clairvoyant and as a recovered alcoholic.Sometimes I cheer Chip Coffey's grumpy-gay-uncle attitude towards these kids. He seems to give them the shots of confidence and knowledge they need to navigate the rest of their lives. Chris Fleming takes a nicer approach but I think that man is walking on eggshells as it is ~ and I hear a rumor that Chip Coffey is returning to do at least the final season of KIDS.Many will despise the nature of this show, a lot more will see it as ""kidsploitation"" but I disagree with the opinion: the kids are well treated, they are 'tested' if you can call it that, and they are each handled with respect as individuals. I have had the great fortune to be in contact with one of the kids I saw on the show, as sweet as can be and today a very successful clairvoyant himself.In any case, as an old veteran of all the paranormal junk that is out there, I think KIDS tops them all. I can't really understand the ratings trouble or other woes connected to this series; it always seemed to me it might benefit a lot of families. Something like this on TV when I was a kid would have helped us immensely!And I have a great fondness for Chip Coffey. Whenever I see Chris Fleming, I sort of grit my teeth and say, ""Wish it were Chip."" In any case, no matter what you think of all this, the series is worth watching a few times. Never have I been any kind of 'ghost hunter' but I have long pursued and tried to expose frauds and hoaxers. This show at least makes me feel a little proud of the psychic side to all this.* WORD OF WARNING: There is a problem with the episode ""Angels and Demons"", in which the last 15 or 20 minutes have the dialogue totally out of synchronization. This has been widely reported but I fear it's just going to remain uncorrected. What a lousy, careless thing to do. On the upside, I understand some sort of ""bonus"" episode is included somewhere on here.",4,A star is missing because an educational element is missing,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,4830,"['PSYCHIC', 'KIDS', 'CHILDREN', 'THE', 'PARANORMAL', '2008', 'release', ""'best"", 'entire', 'season', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'full', '2-DVD', 'set', 'check', 'Amazon', 'details', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'bestbuy', 'sale', '5.99', 'Forget', 'trying', 'maneuver', 'atrocious', 'A', 'E', 'site.PSYCHIC', 'KIDS', 'one', 'paranormal', '-oriented', 'psychic-medium', 'TV', 'show', 'appreciate', 'team', 'well-intentioned', 'adults', 'helping', 'psychic', 'children', 'kids', 'come', 'homes', 'range', 'whole', 'spectrum', 'loving/all-accepting', 'practically', 'hating', 'kids', 'gifts', 'psychologist', 'psychic', 'then', 'work', 'team', 'help', 'support', 'kids', 'kids', 'training', 'psychics', 'shows.Overall', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'three', 'PSYCHIC', 'KIDS', 'CHILDREN', 'THE', 'PARANORMAL', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', 'available', 'date', 'what', 'have', 'reviewed', 'Ghost', 'Freddieepisode', 'also', 'found', 'here', 'A', 'E', 'Psychic', 'Kids', 'Ghost', 'Freddie', 'Dvd', 'episodeGhost', 'School', '2008', 'Psychic', 'Kids', 'Children', 'Paranormal', 'about', 'five', 'six', 'hours', '2-disc', 'set', 'DVD', 'trouble', 'series', 'mess', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'Amazon', 'stock', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'list', 'things', 'right', 'would', 'not', 'advise', 'checking', 'awful', 'A', 'E', 'site.This', 'series', 'always', 'delighted', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'hot', 'collar', 'sometimes', 'stunts', 'pull', 'series', 'teens', 'sometimes', 'apparent', 'clairvoyant', 'abilities', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'psychic', '~', 'was', 'Chip', 'Coffey', '2010', 'left', 'show', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'been', 'much-hated', 'Chris', 'Fleming.There', 'also', 'alleged', 'child', 'psychologist', 'hand', 'original', 'one', 'left', 'Coffey', '2010', 'was', 'replaced', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'feel', 'two', 'three', 'psychologists', 'have', 'served', 'cast', 'members', 'years', 'not', 'something', 'discuss', 'will', 'say', 'here', 'large', 'family', 'are', 'clairvoyant', 'varying', 'degrees', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'Related', 'also', 'have', 'history', 'psychologists', 'dislike', 'might', 'make', 'cynical', 'even', 'skeptical', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'sort', 'education', 'science', 'general', 'benefit', 'may', 'come', 'show', 'kids', 'who', 'appear', 'think', 'good', 'also', 'believe', 'episodes', 'are', 'staged', 'have', 'seen', 'new', 'series', 'Ghost', 'Mine', 'know', 'one', 'miner', 'kids', 'been', 'PSYCHIC', 'KIDS', 'love', 'watching', 'it.Frankly', 'see', 'kids', 'remind', 'ages', 'are', 'trembling', 'fear', 'looking', 'whacked', 'out', 'drugs', '~', 'assure', 'always', 'combination', 'lack', 'sleep', 'loss', 'appetite', 'nasty-minded', 'parents', 'kids', 'picking', 'almost', 'never', 'drugs', 'just', 'things', 'worse', 'can', 'speak', 'experience', 'clairvoyant', 'recovered', 'alcoholic.Sometimes', 'cheer', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'grumpy-gay-uncle', 'attitude', 'kids', 'give', 'shots', 'confidence', 'knowledge', 'need', 'navigate', 'rest', 'lives', 'Chris', 'Fleming', 'nicer', 'approach', 'think', 'man', 'walking', 'eggshells', '~', 'hear', 'rumor', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'returning', 'do', 'least', 'final', 'season', 'KIDS.Many', 'will', 'despise', 'nature', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'will', 'see', 'kidsploitation', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'kids', 'are', 'well', 'treated', 'are', ""'tested"", 'can', 'call', 'are', 'handled', 'respect', 'individuals', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'fortune', 'be', 'contact', 'one', 'kids', 'saw', 'show', 'as', 'sweet', 'can', 'be', 'today', 'very', 'successful', 'clairvoyant', 'himself.In', 'case', 'old', 'veteran', 'paranormal', 'junk', 'there', 'think', 'KIDS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'ratings', 'trouble', 'other', 'woes', 'connected', 'series', 'always', 'seemed', 'might', 'benefit', 'lot', 'families', 'Something', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'immensely', 'have', 'great', 'fondness', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'Whenever', 'see', 'Chris', 'Fleming', 'sort', 'grit', 'teeth', 'say', 'Wish', 'were', 'Chip', 'case', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'Never', 'have', 'been', 'kind', ""'ghost"", 'hunter', 'have', 'long', 'pursued', 'tried', 'expose', 'frauds', 'hoaxers', 'show', 'least', 'feel', 'little', 'proud', 'psychic', 'side', '*', 'WORD', 'WARNING', 'problem', 'episode', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'last', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'have', 'dialogue', 'totally', 'synchronization', 'been', 'widely', 'reported', 'fear', 'just', 'going', 'remain', 'uncorrected', 'What', 'lousy', 'careless', 'thing', 'do', 'upside', 'understand', 'sort', 'bonus', 'episode', 'included', 'somewhere', 'here']",Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal

The care and understanding is so positive and helpful to the children involved.  The DVD I received had one flaw, but it may have just been this one disk. I think it was the bonus episode or possibly the last program on the disk, that maybe within the last ten minutes of it, the sound was badly out of sync, not just a second or two, maybe more like a minute.  Makes me think they are rushing these things out as soon as possible and not being very careful of any flaws.
