I liked the TV show Houston Knights 1987-88 because of him.  This had a good story line and was well acted by Pare.  I don't know why he hasn't had a TV series since his last one as his acting is as good as many on TV today and he is certainly as goodlooking today in middle age, as he was in his youth.",4,For Michael Pare fans.,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,410,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', '1', 'especially', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', '2', 'liked', 'TV', 'show', 'Houston', 'Knights', '1987-88', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'Pare', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'had', 'TV', 'series', 'last', 'one', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'TV', 'today', 'certainly', 'goodlooking', 'today', 'middle', 'age', 'was', 'youth']",N/A
