Otool and Strauss were exceptional--that's what made the drama so compelling. Each man was intensely resolved to achieve his goal, and neither would surrender to the other. Also, each hero was extremely human--sensitive and thoughtful--despite the pluck and resolve each had.Despite the inaccuracies cited by the below historians, the movie is first rate drama--you don't want to miss a word or an action, so absorbing and involving is it. This is entertainment at its best--an unforgettable experience, one that I will see again and again. Otool's performance is spectacular--he so skillfully reveals both the inner and outer man of the officer he plays. He is totally believable, which makes even this preponderantly fictional account realistic and interesting.However, the makers of the film, in all fairness to the viewers, should have stated at the outset that the film was BASED ONLY LOOSELY on a historical event, and that it contains many fictional elements that were added for dramatic appeal and emphasis.

50374,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,0783222823,Bold Consumer,"[1, 1]","Well done! Most of what we know about Masada comes from what Josephus wrote. Much of the rest of it comes from archeology. I'm just getting started studying about what was actually found at the site, which for years had been searched for and finally found in 1842, according to what I have read, initially surveyed in 1955-56, and a full-scale excavation done in 1963-65 by Israeli archeologist Yigael Yadin, with the help of hundreds of volunteers. This series was true to what I had remembered reading in Josephus. After viewing the story this week, I read the account in Josephus again and it was spot on. The setting was just as I had remembered it when I traveled to Masada last year.Now this is the way a historical drama ought to be done. We get to put names, faces, and emotions to the facts we already know. In this version, very little was added. That was what I was looking for, as factual an account as possible.Recently I read two novels about Masada. I enjoyed one of them very much: Masada, The Last Fortress by Gloria D. Miklowitz. I think it might have been intended for a young audience, but it was a beautiful novel of what the personal lives of the people 'might' have been like, based on what we know. It got into the daily lives, romance, the question of whether they had weddings and other celebrations.  The other novel I read was an author's warped and distorted version that was loosely based on facts. It was also a very slow, boring slog of a story.This series is much more interesting, because it includes both positives and negatives about the people who make up this story, both on the side of the rebels and the Romans. Nobody comes out of it faultless. There are times when I wanted to take leaders of both sides and shake some sense into them. They made mistakes and everyone faced the consequences.The mini-series Masada: The Last Fortress was able to stay true to facts and add enough romantic interest and drama to get past the intensity of the story being told without keeping us depressed. We know there were women and children there and the story gave us just the right exposure to what they must have gone through, knowing that they would not be able to live out their lives. It shows the parents carefully communicating with each other about what was to come, protecting their innocent and trusting children from how (and when) final, inevitable events were to play out as much as they could, as any parent would. We got to see the action from the Roman side to an amazing extent, because Josephus is writing from the side of the 'victors', in this case victors who didn't get the victory they thought they would when they won this battle.There will never be complete agreement about what happened at Masada or why it happened, of course, but I was so pleased to see that the version, Masada - The Complete Epic Mini-Series, stayed as true to fact as is reasonable. I will recommend this series to anyone who is interested in the siege against the rock called Masada.",5,Excellent!

It is based on the novel, The Antagonists, and is one of the few works of the screen to exceed the book in passion and richness.The movie contains a constellation of super star actors-especially Peter O'Tool and Anthony Quayle, who play the Roman Officers set to reduce the fortress.  What perhaps makes this movie so epic is that the political challenges posed by the opposition parties within the Roman and Zealot Camps are brought to life.  The political situation in Rome is carefully explained, the vicious fighting of the Jews at Masada and their religious differences is explored, and finally the thoughts and fears of both antagonists are mentioned.

It was broadcast a second time, and for some reason, they edited out the graduation ceremonies of the modern-day Israeli Army at the very end.  In the original version, scenes of this graduation ceremony bracket the historical production, and I think they add tremendous power and emotional appeal to it.I bought the 4-tape VHS version, which has the modern-day material at the beginning, but not at the end.The two-DVD version we rented from Netflix is a bit irritating if you are a genuine ""Masada"" fan (which I am) but it is the ONLY version I have seen that includes the modern-day Israeli Army scenes at both ends of the historical drama. Just as the camera narrows in on all the Roman insignias now planted atop Masada (after seeing Peter O'Toole's incredibly craggy, weary face), you suddenly hear fighter jets screaming overhead and wonder -""What is going on?"" and then they are back in modern-day Israel again and this brings the story full circle.Maybe this is just me being picky, but I think having the modern-day scenes at both ends of the historical saga adds a sense of completeness and timeless appeal that it lacks otherwise.The two-DVD version does lack quite a few scenes from the original version, but for the most part, the editing is carefully done and you don't lose too much of the story.

Of course being a film there is some artistic license taken but it is very good none the less.  Being an amateur Roman historian and a re-enactor there were some things about the legionaires and thier gear that left a lot to be desired such as leather lorica segmentatas but on the other hand there were a lot of subtle details that were a pleasant surprise such as, marching poles (Roman Packs), the Officers armour, and the fact that they didn't use stirrups with thier horses (not even Gladiator did that).  The fact that this movie as well as most other Roman movies show the Romans fighting in an undisciplined mob one on one (and usually being slaughtered by the freedom fighters) is a disapointment but is overshadowed by the many positive things in this film.On the other hand I have seen other reviews that say that this was a balanced movie and I have to disagree.  This movie was definitely pro Jewish.  They showed the Jews as saintly self sacraficing freedom fighters and the Romans as evil mindless robots of destruction.  The sacking of Jerusalem was very harsh, but that was the nature of warfare in those times and if the Jews had won they would have done the same to the Romans (take Jericho for example).All in all I highly recommend this film, Peter O'Toole was magnificent as Silva as well as Peter Strauss as the Zealot leader.",5,Epic Series,1018569600,"04 12, 2002",2002,1485,"['Masada', 'full', 'mini-series', 'version', 'work', 'art', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'Roman', 'history', 'ancient', 'history', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'course', 'being', 'film', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'very', 'good', 'none', 'less', 'Being', 'amateur', 'Roman', 'historian', 're-enactor', 'were', 'things', 'legionaires', 'thier', 'gear', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'such', 'leather', 'lorica', 'segmentatas', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'lot', 'subtle', 'details', 'were', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'such', 'marching', 'poles', 'Roman', 'Packs', 'Officers', 'armour', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'stirrups', 'thier', 'horses', 'not', 'even', 'Gladiator', 'did', 'fact', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'other', 'Roman', 'movies', 'show', 'Romans', 'fighting', 'undisciplined', 'mob', 'one', 'one', 'usually', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'disapointment', 'overshadowed', 'many', 'positive', 'things', 'film.On', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'was', 'balanced', 'movie', 'have', 'disagree', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'pro', 'Jewish', 'showed', 'Jews', 'saintly', 'sacraficing', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'Romans', 'evil', 'mindless', 'robots', 'destruction', 'sacking', 'Jerusalem', 'was', 'very', 'harsh', 'was', 'nature', 'warfare', 'times', 'Jews', 'had', 'won', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'Romans', 'take', 'Jericho', 'example', '.All', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'magnificent', 'as', 'Silva', 'as', 'well', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'Zealot', 'leader']",N/A

This Classic TV 1981 miniseries is arguably one of the greatest ever produced in its genre, and garnered a lot of awards in its day. It is MORE than highly recommended!It is well written and has a stellar cast that more than lived up to the script. The series, based on Ernest K. Gann's historical novel The Antagonists, is a dramatization of a documented revolt by nearly a thousand Jerusalem Jews against Roman oppressors in A.D. 72 to 73.Epic in its scope, the actors bring nobility and pathos to the ultimately inspiring and tragic story. Following a city-wide siege by Rome's soldiers, Jewish Zealots move into a desert fortress in the mountains of Masada of Judea. It is from that remote location that they make their last stand against the tyrannical Roman Empire. Amazingly, their defensive battlement is strong enough to convince the enemy to negotiate after a two-year battle!The brilliant Peter O'Toole, portrays Cornelius Flavius Silva, commander of the Roman legions, while Peter Strauss (who was cast in several miniseries in the 80's) portrays the Zealot leader Eleazar ben Yair, who end up developing an improbably respect for each other during the life-and-death struggle.O'Toole, is fresh from the Roman conquest of Judea. Exhausted emotionally and physically, he has been affected by the constant warring, but remains the ruthless Commander of the elite Tenth Legion. He yearns to return home to Italy, but is prevented from doing so by a violent uprising of a small band of courageous Jews led by the volatile renegade soldier, Eleazar ben Yair (Strauss).Silva is ordered to capture Eleazar and his followers. He is beset by internal strife because the brutal desert conditions have his legion teetering on the brink of mutiny, while he finds himself falling in love with a Jewess (portrayed with sensitivity by Barbara Carerra.) At the same time, Pomponius Falco, portrayed by David Warner, is working to steal his command.Inside the fortress, Eleazar is struggling to keep his followers together. A diverse mix of defected soldiers, wanted criminals along with women and children totally about 900, they struggle to find enough food and water to survive their courageous stand against impossible, truly hopeless odds.The actors leave nothing on the cutting room floor in their heart wrenching renditions of their unforgettable characters. Somehow, O'Toole brings humanity to his character, while Strauss is integrity, fury and courage personified.Both of their characters believe the negotiations are real, and represent each side in good faith, struggling to find a way out of the deadly situation.Unfortunately, neither realizes that Rome has no intention of yielding, but instead sends thousands of soldiers in a horrible seige of Masada resulting in one of the worst tragedies in Jewish history.Masada was brilliantly directed by Boris Sagal (The Omega Man), and the musical score is unforgettably moving.",5,BEYOND Recommended!,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,3003,"['Masada', 'one', 'most', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'DVD', 'releases', 'year', 'Classic', 'TV', '1981', 'miniseries', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'produced', 'genre', 'garnered', 'lot', 'awards', 'day', 'MORE', 'highly', 'recommended', 'well', 'written', 'stellar', 'cast', 'more', 'lived', 'up', 'script', 'series', 'based', 'Ernest', 'K.', 'Gann', 'historical', 'novel', 'Antagonists', 'dramatization', 'documented', 'revolt', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'Jerusalem', 'Jews', 'Roman', 'oppressors', 'A.D.', '72', '73.Epic', 'scope', 'actors', 'bring', 'nobility', 'pathos', 'ultimately', 'inspiring', 'tragic', 'story', 'Following', 'city-wide', 'siege', 'Rome', 'soldiers', 'Jewish', 'Zealots', 'move', 'desert', 'fortress', 'mountains', 'Masada', 'Judea', 'remote', 'location', 'make', 'last', 'stand', 'tyrannical', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Amazingly', 'defensive', 'battlement', 'strong', 'enough', 'convince', 'enemy', 'negotiate', 'two-year', 'battle', 'brilliant', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Cornelius', 'Flavius', 'Silva', 'commander', 'Roman', 'legions', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'several', 'miniseries', '80', 'Zealot', 'leader', 'Eleazar', 'ben', 'Yair', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'developing', 'improbably', 'respect', 'other', 'life-and-death', ""struggle.O'Toole"", 'fresh', 'Roman', 'conquest', 'Judea', 'Exhausted', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'been', 'affected', 'constant', 'warring', 'ruthless', 'Commander', 'elite', 'Tenth', 'Legion', 'return', 'home', 'Italy', 'prevented', 'doing', 'so', 'violent', 'uprising', 'small', 'band', 'courageous', 'Jews', 'led', 'volatile', 'renegade', 'soldier', 'Eleazar', 'Yair', 'Strauss', '.Silva', 'ordered', 'capture', 'Eleazar', 'followers', 'beset', 'internal', 'strife', 'brutal', 'desert', 'conditions', 'have', 'legion', 'teetering', 'brink', 'mutiny', 'falling', 'love', 'Jewess', 'portrayed', 'sensitivity', 'Barbara', 'Carerra', 'same', 'time', 'Pomponius', 'Falco', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Warner', 'working', 'steal', 'command.Inside', 'fortress', 'Eleazar', 'struggling', 'keep', 'followers', 'together', 'diverse', 'mix', 'defected', 'soldiers', 'wanted', 'criminals', 'women', 'children', 'totally', '900', 'struggle', 'find', 'enough', 'food', 'water', 'survive', 'courageous', 'stand', 'impossible', 'truly', 'hopeless', 'odds.The', 'actors', 'leave', 'nothing', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'renditions', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'Somehow', ""O'Toole"", 'humanity', 'character', 'Strauss', 'integrity', 'fury', 'courage', 'personified.Both', 'characters', 'believe', 'negotiations', 'are', 'real', 'represent', 'side', 'good', 'faith', 'struggling', 'find', 'way', 'deadly', 'situation.Unfortunately', 'Rome', 'intention', 'yielding', 'instead', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'horrible', 'seige', 'Masada', 'resulting', 'one', 'worst', 'tragedies', 'Jewish', 'history.Masada', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Boris', 'Sagal', 'Omega', 'Man', 'musical', 'score', 'unforgettably', 'moving']",N/A

However, for sheer entertainment and quality of performance, Masada is still one great movie!Be advised that the shorter version (2 hours) omits a great deal of material included in the much longer mini-series format. Nevertheless, for the average viewer, the abridged version is packed with enough epic drama to suit just fine.Peter O'Toole's Flavius Silva is peerless. His emotionless eloquence is an excellent portrayal of the general of Rome's undefeated tenth legion challenging the 900 Jewish raiders who have fled to Masada's heights. Peter Strauss (Eleazar) nearly matches O'Toole's brilliance as the fiery leader of the Jewish rebels, who prefer to die 'stealing victory' from the Romans rather than surrendering.I have been to Masada twice, and honestly--it was nearly impossible to tell that the film really wasn't shot at the site! The highlight of the film is the massive siege engine's ascent up the Roman ramp, and the battering ram's assault on the wall. The concluding suicide sequence is handled with reserve and tact.The final forty minutes are underscored by an exhilarating musical score that serves to heighten the tension as the inevitable outcome nears. The end is replete with superbly written dialogue, as well as attention to detail in evidencing the engineering expertise of Ancient Rome.Because much of what is known about the real story of Masada is speculation, the less one knows about the incident, the more one can enjoy the film.

50403,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0783222823,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 14]","The two-hour videotape version of the mini-series ""Masada"" remains in my mind as the greatest single abomination in terms of editing down a mini-series.  They did the same thing with ""Shogun,"" which was bad enough, but they had some narration to cover up all their bloody cutting in that instance, and there was nothing to salvage what they did to ""Masada.""  Specifically, they took out all of the debate and rhetoric that led to mass suicide, which was precisely the part I was most interested in seeing again.  So I am one of the countless number who were happy to see that the complete 1981 ABC mini-series was finally available on DVD.Watching ""Masada"" again after a quarter of a century I was surprised to find how much of it I remembered, especially when it comes to Peter O'Toole's mesmerizing performance as Flavius Silva, leader of the 10th Roman Legion and Governor-General of Judea.  In Part II, when Silva rises to his feet and critique's Eleazar psychological warfare, I could vividly recall how that scene was inter-cut with others in ABC's previews for the second week of the mini-series.  O'Toole was nominated but did not win an Emmy for his performance (but then Robert Duvall did not win for ""Lonesome Dove,"" so I never expect justice when it comes to the Emmys).  Peter Strauss plays Eleazar ben Yair, leader of the defenders of Masada, and in the conflict of this story he is the baritone to O'Toole's tenor.  The two clash marvelously, and yet it is clear that if the world had allowed them to work together they could have accomplished great things.My first wife was doing her Master's Thesis on Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple before Jonestown (she had friends who had joined his church, heard him preach, and knew he was a pathological snake-oil salesman).  After Jonestown as the press groped for a reason why hundreds of people would take their own lives in the name of religion, the historical reference of the siege of Masada in 73 A.D., where 936 inhabitants killed themselves rather than be captured and tortured by the Romans.  The paradox was how the martyrs of Masada could be heroes while those in Jonestown were delusional.  ""Guyana Tragedy: Jim Jones Story"" aired on CBS in 1980, and ABC showed ""Masada"" in four parts the following year.  Both are riveting in different ways, and produce, as you would expect, diametrically opposed reactions.You will not be surprised to hear that of the two it is ""Masada"" that is more bearable to watch a second time.  The only real slow part of the six hours comes at the beginning of Part III, because nothing really happens as the siege progresses, but that is a necessary lull to set up when Falco (David Warner) takes over the siege and tries his own sick little version of coercion (I have never liked the ""look what you made me do"" excuse for barbarity).  Then we have one of the best scenes, as Silva and Eleazar are both tormented by the sounds of what is happening, and their reactions end up sanctioning Eleazar's leadership.  I still find Barbara Carrera's character of Sheva to be largely unnecessary, although she does give Silva somebody to talk to as he gives weight to the voices in his mind (""You're worse than a mirror,"" he tells her).  I also think her response to what happens at Masada to be an unnecessary pain for Silva, whose belief in reason makes the outcome of the siege painful enough (he proves that with his ""That is not Rome,"" speech when he stops Falco).  If there is one line I remember from this mini-series it is Silva's, ""I should have put the proposition sooner.""  There are absolutely no extras, and the end of one of the scenes in Part IV ends abruptly, so in the end we really do not have the ""complete"" mini-series (but better two minutes lost than only two hours left).  The cast features Anthony Quayle as the siege master Rubrius Gallus, Joseph Wiseman as the Head Essene Jerahmeel, and big Paul L. Smith as Gideon.""Masada"" is not history but drama; who knows if Silva and Eleazar ever spoke to each other, let alone having a clandestine meeting on the slopes of Masada during the siege.  Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth Tudor never met, but I know of no dramatist who has avoided putting them into a room together in telling their story.  Ernest K. Gann, best known as the author of ""The High and the Mighty,"" told the story of Masada as ""The Antagonists,"" republished in paperback when the mini-series was produced as ""Masada: A novel of love, courage and the triumph of the human spirit.""  Gann put the focus on Silva and Eleazar, and the mini-series rightfully follows his lead.  The screenplay is by Joel Olianksy, writer-director of ""The Competition,"" and he certainly gives O'Toole and Strauss plenty to work with (e.g., Eleazar proposes the mass suicide while looking at his wife and son), which explains the results.  Equally important, the strategy and tactics of the siege, by definition a relatively long and boring process, are worked out in great detail (e.g., the attackers moving the battle tower into position while the defenders ""soften"" the gate).  Whatever really happened was probably not as interesting, but the results here are impressive even before we get to the mass suicide, which is precisely what the point of telling this story should be.",5,"""Or you can choose to take their victory from them, and they will remember you.""",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,5288,"['two-hour', 'videotape', 'version', 'mini-series', 'Masada', 'mind',

Its a historical drama about the Roman siege of Masada and the series centered around two men who led the forces against each other. Peter O'Toole does a fanastic job as the leader of the Roman 10th Legion and Governor of Judica while his counterpart, Peter Strauss played well against him as the leader of the Jewish Zeolots hold up on the mountain top fortress. They were well served by their supporting actors. I especially enjoyed the job Anthony Quayle did as the siege engineer, it was nice to see him in action once again. The production values of this series was very good for a TV although I am amazed why Hollywoodland would put Roman soldiers in brown leather armor. At least color the armor silver to simulate their armor plated uniform!!As ironic as this may sound, Masada is a story that supposes to show the courage and determination of the Jews fighting to remains free from Rome but instead, anyone who watches this series realized that it was the Romans who show greater determination, greater courage and greater resolved to conquer. Most of the series had the Jews trapped up on Masada fighting among themselves like a soap opera show while the Romans who did all the hard work of conducting the siege, stoic determination and willingness to endured. By the time the series end, we understand why most of the western civilization fell under Roman control, they deserves to rule because they are willing to adjust, adapt and overcome almost anything. Jews who thought to kill themselves to rob the Romans their victory really didn't robbed anyone but themselves a chance to die in glory. As any professional soldier can tell you, any battle that wasn't a battle is a good battle.The DVD of Masada was long time coming but unfortunately, this is not really a very pristine copy. I doubt if they ever clean up the original print since the DVD looks pretty ordinary with dirts, spots and scratches. Still, its no worst then the VHS and I thought it was clearer and more crisp then the tape version. Its not the industy high standard but it not that bad. It come in two disc, cramming 383 minutes into that must had something to do with the average quality of the images. There isn't any extra features attach to this DVD.Overall, this is a must buy DVD for anyone who enjoyed the series. Although the overall quality is average, it's still better then the VHS and it will last longer.

Peter O'Toole is a great actor, but he absolutely outdid himself playing Flavius Silva, a character with more facets than the Hope diamond. Following the Roman conquest of Judea, lonely, ruthless,hard-drinking, burned-out commander of the elite Tenth Legion just wants to go home to Italy, but his departure is scuttled by the uprising of a rag-tag band of Jews led by the hot-tempered renegade soldier Eleazar ben Yair (Peter Strauss) who play Viet Cong for awhile, poisoning wells and ambushing Roman outposts, then hole up on the impenitrable mountain fortress at Masada, a gigantic vertical tower of rock that rises out of the Judean desert. Silva is given the thankless and seemingly impossible task of bringing Eleazar to heel in an age well before cannons, explosives, or air power. It doesn't help that the brutal desert conditions have his legion teetering on the brink of mutiny, he is falling in love with a Jewess (Barbara Carerra), or that a meddler from the Emperor's court (the always excellent David Warner as Pomponius Falco) is scheming to steal his command. Luckily for him, Eleazar has his own problems holding his improbable mix of ex-soldiers, priests, fugitive criminals, women and children together in the face of overwhelming odds. The best moments in the series revolve around the grugding respect that Eleazar and Silva develop for each other over the course of the two-year seige, and the awe-inspiring military and engineering effort the Romans put forth to stamp out the resistance of a mere nine hundred people. Brilliant engingeer Gallus (Anthony Quayle) designs a gigantic ramp, built by slave labor, which leads to Masada's gates, and then a huge, pully-driven, battering-ram-cum-assault tower to knock it down, but in the end Eleazar comes up with a few tricks of his own. The stubborn, hopeless defiance of the Jews is as moving as the thorough ruthlessness and genius of the Romans is impressive.

After the First Jewish-Roman War (also known as the Great Jewish Revolt) a siege of the fortress by troops of the Roman Empire led to the mass suicide of Jewish rebels, who preferred death to surrender.According to Josephus, a first-century Jewish Roman historian, Herod the Great fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE as a refuge for himself in the event of a revolt. In 66 CE, at the beginning of the First Jewish-Roman War against the Roman Empire, a group of Jewish extremists called the Sicarii overcame the Roman garrison of Masada. After the destruction of the Temple, the jewish rebels and their families fled Jerusalem and settled on the mountain top, using it as a base for raiding Roman settlements.[1]The works of Josephus are the sole record of events that took place during the siege. According to modern interpretations of Josephus, the Sicarii were an extremist splinter group of the Zealots who were equally antagonistic to both Romans and other Jewish groups.[2] The Zealots (according to Josephus), in contrast to the Sicarii, carried the main burden of the rebellion, which opposed Roman rule of Judea (as the Roman province of Iudaea, its Latinized name).The Sicarii on Masada were commanded by Elazar ben Ya'ir (who may have been the same person as Eleazar ben Simon), and in 70 CE they were joined by additional Sicarii and their families that were expelled from Jerusalem by the Jewish population with whom the Sicarii were in conflict shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple.Archaeology indicates that they modified some of the structures they found there; this includes a building which was modified to function as a synagogue facing Jerusalem, (in fact, the building may originally have been one), although it did not contain a mikvah or the benches found in other early synagogues.[3] Remains of two mikvahs were found elsewhere on Masada.Wits and weapons clash in this 1981 epic chronicling a rebellion by Jewish Zealots against Roman rule. After Jerusalem falls to the Romans in 70 A.D., nearly a thousand Jewish rebels led by Eleazar ben Jair (Peter Strauss) withdraw to a mountaintop fortress 30 miles southeast of Jerusalem. There, fed by defiance and an unlimited supply of cistern water, they make their stand against Roman rule, now and then conducting surprise raids against Roman positions down below. Whenever the Romans retaliate, Eleazar goes them one better. He and his men burn grain supplies, poison wells and generally make life miserable for the Roman 10th Legion, encamped in the baking desert surrounding the fortress. Frustrated, the Roman general Cornelius Flavius Silva (Peter O'Toole) brings in a brilliant siege master, Rubrius Gallus (Anthony Quayle), to devise a way to breach the mountaintop stronghold. When Gallus begins construction of an earthen ramp up the mountainside, rebels rain down arrows on the Roman workers. Flavius then uses Jews from nearby villages to build the ramp. Meanwhile, Flavius makes several attempts to persuade the rebel Jews to surrender, promising they will live in peace and prosperity under Roman rule. But the Jews are adamant; they want only one thing: freedom, or, at the very least, limited freedom under a Roman-appointed Jewish governor. But after Roman Emperor Vespasian vetoes peace plans, the ramp continues to rise. When it is finished, the Romans pull a massive battering ram on wheels--another of Gallus's stratagems--up the ramp, and the stage is set for the final battle deciding the fate of the Jews. This film had at least three incarnations: as a 6-hour, 34-minute TV series in 1980, and then in trimmed-down versions in 1981 and 1984.

Rome needed to keep Palestine, not for its riches (the governor was the governor of Syria) but for military reasons. TITUS, son of the emperor VESPASIAN, and the next emperor, crushed the Great Revolt of 70 AD  by a bloodbath even more cruel than usual and destroyed Jerusalem, demolished its walls and razed the Temple to the ground by fire. He left the western wall intact, as well as the three towers built by Herod, to be used by the Tenth Legion (THE ILLUSTRATED ATLAS OF JERUSALEM by Dan Bahat).Some rebels had seized the fortress of MASADA in the Judean desert and were joined by some other rebel Jews known as ""zealots"", 800 altogether.The 1981 miniseries tells the story of the long siege, in 72, by the 10th legion (about 5000 men) led by the legate Peter O' Toole.Neither the legate or his soldiers enjoy their mission, in a terrible heat, with meagre hope of looting. O' Toole is outstanding but his character is too lenient. The Romans were just ruthless imperialists, in a forsaken land. Not philosophers.On the Jewish side, the screnplay takes a turn for the worse: the military leader Peter Strauss looks to modern, his religious hesitations are strange, his relationship with the religious zealots unconvincing and the whole thing, in front of the Romanmurderers takes a Walt Disneyish tinge.But there is a strong plot and the construction of the ramp, under the supervision of the engineer Anthony Quayle, also an outstanding actor, is gripping.Warner, as a senator adds briefly a vicious touch.The end is bizarre. Of course, the war aim of the Romans, in addition to victory and conquest was always the taking of slaves.It was logical to kill the young and old Jews. The women and able bodied men could kill Romans while fighting to the death.So the suicide of the zealots has known several Jewish judgements: a condemnation as a fanatical gesture, then an admirationfor an heroic gesture.As things are, the series is really great. The shooting in the Judean desert adds to the credibility, as do the Roman costumes and armours.",5,TOO CIVILIZED FOR A TRAGEDY BUT A GREAT TV MINISERIES,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2414,"['author', 'book', 'not', 'very', 'large', 'was', 'pilot', 'wrote', 'mainly', 'novels', 'aviations', 'two', 'films', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'choice', 'subject', 'was', 'surprising', 'historians', 'still', 'question', 'reality', 'collective', 'suicide', 'ended', 'siege', 'Masada.But', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'were', 'always', 'Jewish', 'revolts', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'Rome', 'needed', 'keep', 'Palestine', 'not', 'riches', 'governor', 'was', 'governor', 'Syria', 'military', 'reasons', 'TITUS', 'son', 'emperor', 'VESPASIAN', 'next', 'emperor', 'crushed', 'Great', 'Revolt', '70', 'AD', 'bloodbath', 'even', 'more', 'cruel', 'usual', 'destroyed', 'Jerusalem', 'demolished', 'walls', 'razed', 'Temple', 'ground', 'fire', 'left', 'western', 'wall', 'intact', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'towers', 'built', 'Herod', 'be', 'used', 'Tenth', 'Legion', 'THE', 'ILLUSTRATED', 'ATLAS', 'OF', 'JERUSALEM', 'Dan', 'Bahat', '.Some', 'rebels', 'had', 'seized', 'fortress', 'MASADA', 'Judean', 'desert', 'were', 'joined', 'other', 'rebel', 'Jews', 'known', 'zealots', '800', 'altogether.The', '1981', 'miniseries', 'story', 'long', 'siege', '72', '10th', 'legion', '5000', 'men', 'led', 'legate', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole.Neither', 'legate', 'soldiers', 'enjoy', 'mission', 'terrible', 'heat', 'meagre', 'hope', 'looting', 'O', 'Toole', 'outstanding', 'character', 'too', 'lenient', 'Romans', 'were', 'just', 'ruthless', 'imperialists', 'forsaken', 'land', 'Not', 'Jewish', 'side', 'screnplay', 'turn', 'worse', 'military', 'leader', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'modern', 'religious', 'hesitations', 'are', 'strange', 'relationship', 'religious', 'zealots', 'unconvincing', 'whole', 'thing', 'front', 'Romanmurderers', 'Walt', 'Disneyish', 'tinge.But', 'strong', 'plot', 'construction', 'ramp', 'supervision', 'engineer', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'also', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'gripping.Warner', 'senator', 'briefly', 'vicious', 'touch.The', 'end', 'bizarre', 'course', 'war', 'aim', 'Romans', 'addition', 'victory', 'conquest', 'was', 'always', 'taking', 'slaves.It', 'was', 'logical', 'kill', 'young', 'old', 'Jews', 'women', 'able', 'bodied', 'men', 'could', 'kill', 'Romans', 'fighting', 'death.So', 'suicide', 'zealots', 'known', 'several', 'Jewish', 'judgements', 'condemnation', 'fanatical', 'gesture', 'then', 'admirationfor', 'heroic', 'gesture.As', 'things', 'are', 'series', 'really', 'great', 'shooting', 'Judean', 'desert', 'credibility', 'do', 'Roman', 'costumes', 'armours']",N/A

50415,A3C2Q9W6VN8EWL,0783222823,P. Bartl,"[5, 6]","Like many other reviewers, I'm a huge fan of ""Masada"" who first watched it on tv many years ago. So my rating of 4 stars refers to this particular product (the DVD of the complete series) since it's disappointing in not having any extras.I'm a Roman history buff and enjoy epics, but I've come to realize that the main reason why I find ""Masada"" interesting to watch and re-watch is the characterization of Lucius Flavius Silva and the way Peter O'Toole plays him. Never mind (for now) whether or not it's historically accurate or plausible - the script, and O'Toole's acting, make Silva a perfectly consistent, believable, and 3-dimensional character. I've seldom seen such a good combination of character concept, the way the scrip treats him, and the actor.Silva is essentially a man who values rational thought. His main reason for wanting a peaceful settlement with Peter Strauss's Eleazar - both at the beginning, and later just before the storming of Masada - is not so much that he's a humane or merciful man; it's rather that he sees the *pointlessness* of a long conflict that will end in Rome's victory in one way or the other, sooner or later, anyway - so it might as well end sooner and without all that waste of time, resources, and lives. And as a man who is driven primarily by reason, Silva seeks the cooperation, and the friendship, and trust of others with whom he can deal rationally and openly. That leads to Silva's chief weakness - as noted by Falco, Gallus, and Sheva: he is inclined to make mistakes as to his relationships with others. He trusts his original lieutenants - Quadratus and Merovius - who betray him; he does not realize the danger presented by his ""friend"" Falco even when his one true friend, Gsllus, warns him; he mistakes his sort of ""convenient"" relationship with Sheva for true love; and he believes to the end that his perceived personal bond of trust with Eleazar can still save the day. And, accordingly, Silva becomes most ruthless - or most confused - when he realizes that he had been mistaken about the nature of the bonds with those individuals. In the case of his relationship with Eleazar: he is grateful that Eleazar still trusts him despite Silva's betrayal when they first met, which makes Silva all the more concerned about avoiding a massacre in the end - and about proving to Eleazar that he can, indeed, trust Silva. Which is the point of his monologue at the very end - he laments that Eleazar did not recognize that he was a true friend.I found the above fascinating because it's never explicitly stated (apart from brief remarks by Sheva and Falco); it's just something that is part of Silva's character and makes him seem a real person, in a manner totally consistent with (and important for) the story.As far as ""Masada""'s Silva resemblance to the historical person: the authors got it right in establishing a close personal relationship with the Emperor Vespasian and his elder son and later successor, Titus; Silva succeeded both in commanding the suppression of the revolt in Judaea, from where Vespasian made his claim to the throne just four years before the events in ""Masada"". Later, in the last year of Titus as emperor, the historical Silva was rewarded with the highest Roman magistracy, the consulship. He may even have been distantly related to Vespasian and Titus. And yet, it is the scene in Rome with Vespasian that shows the ultimate implausibility of ""Masada""'s version of history: when asking Vespasian for the concessions he had agreed with Eleazar in exchange for peace, Vespasian replies, ""it's too late, you can't make concessions after you've declared victory"". Well, duh. Precisely. And the thing is, the historical Silva - and even ""Masada""'s Silva - would have known that, without having to go to Rome and hear that from Vespasian.(Incidentally, one of the small attentions to historical detail, despite the inaccuracies, is that Vespasian's younger son Domitian is shown in Rome alongside Titus, albeit as a non-speaking part.)I suspect that for the historical Silva, matters were far less complex than for O'Toole's Silva. Not only there could be no question of making concessions to the rebels at that point - least of all to Eleazar's Sicarii, which were the ruthless terrorists other reviewers have described - for him the Masada campaign would have been just the last tidying-up operation in the long Jewish War. I find it easier to imagine that the historical Silva, upon hearing a suggestion that he should meet Eleazar and talk, would have answered, ""about what?""Of course, a matter-of-fact description of a business-as-usual campaign by an experienced Roman legate against the last remains of the most radical of Jewish rebels would be less interesting, and far shorter, than the ""Israeli Masada myth"" that the producers wanted. Hence the invention of a relationship between Silva and Eleazar, and of a situation where Silva might consider plausible that Rome might still want to make concessions for the sake of peace. It's essentially stretching and twisting the known historical facts for the sake of the story; but in doing so they created a wonderful character in Silva, which is what makes ""Masada"" so memorable, in my opinion.In this context, as others noted, I wonder if ""Masada"" succeeded in the apparent intention of promoting the Israeli Masada myth. The Romans as a whole are indeed shown as reasonable and essentially as professionals, even well-intentioned, as illustrated by the dialogue between Silva and Vespasian. The acts that lead Eleazar to break his truce with Silva are clearly shown as the actions of corrupt and untrustworthy individuals, rather than as Rome's official policy. The beginnings of the Jewish revolt are described to Silva, by the father of a captured Zealot, as something rather banal that just snowballed out of control. Actually - maybe I'm seeing too much into this - the producers seemed keen on showing that, although ruthless and conquerors and occupiers, the Romans were not the Nazis. Hence the detailed scene of Gallus explaining how to get the best out of the Jewish slaves - which included being relatively humane. That is to say, the Romans were interested in the labor of the Jewish slaves and in the surrender of the Jewish rebels - but not in extermination of Jewish lives as a goal in itself.- Spoiler alert -(Of course, for all of the promises of O'Toole's Silva that the rebels of Masada would be spared, it is far more likely that the historical Silva would have sold at least all the women and children into slavery, and perhaps crucified the men, if they had not committed suicide).As for the characters besides Silva, I found most of them convincing and at least two-dimensional if not three-dimensional, especially Anthony Quayle's Gallus and and even Barbara Carrera's Sheva. As a fan of David Warner, I have to quibble that his portrayal of Falco was slightly unconvincing, for this reason: he plays Falco as if Falco were a professional actor himself - that is, totally changing personality the moment he decides to take over Silva's command. I found that unconvincing. I have met a few men like Falco: they are ruthless weasels, but they remain weasels even as they stab you in the back (or in the front). I would have found more convincing if Falco had acted in a more subtle fashion, even as he took over command (which might be even ironic, in exploring Silva's weaknesses as I mentioned above, with Silva thinking, ""maybe Falco did think he was acting for the best?""Anyway: I think ""Masada"" is a very good character study of Peter O'Toole's Flavius Silva, who fits the role perfectly, besides telling a story of epic proportions with mostly excellent actors. Yes, it has flaws historically - but as long as you don't think it's 100% accurate, that shouldn't be a problem.",4,Excellent character study and acting by Peter O'Toole,1266883200,"02 23,

I scooped up the DVD on first sight, although the DVD art looked a little..""unofficial"" by comparison with the lavish 4 tape box set. It seems that MASADA is owned by MCA-Universal, but this release is put out by KOCH Entertainment. Okay, I thought, so the cover art is a bit flat...at least it's out on DVD! Well, I watched it, and it looks REALLY good. Not restored or even cleaned, mind you. You can see scratches and damage to the negative, but its only minor and to be expected with anything that's been in the vault since the 80's. However, what I was aghast to notice are gaps in the scene where Silva is deciding to torch the wall of Masada or not. The scene is clipped short on the DVD. In the original film, Silva (Peter O'Toole) says ""Burn it!"" to his engineer, and storms off. Then we see the archers setting their fires. Before he says that line on the DVD, the screen goes black, and they cut to the archers shooting fire-arrows into the wall. Hmmm. I dug out my 4 tape VHS to be sure. Sure enough, his ""Burn it!"" line is missing from the DVD. Indeed, I noticed there is other dialog missing from this scene as well. Silva asks for suggestions other than fire from his officers. When no one speaks up he tells them he doesn't blame them, and would probably keep silent if he was in their place. Those lines aren't there either. Now, this is just ONE scene I noticed, but I suspect there are probably other bits missing as well. While its not the end of the world, I am disappointed. Why couldn't MCA have just put out a decent and COMPLETE version of Masada themselves? Suffice to say, Im holding on to my 4 tape VHS set, which I have to recommend over this DVD release.

50419,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,0783222823,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 2]","This is a very good made-4-tv melodrama based on the historical myth of the Jewish struggle against the Romans.  So far as I could see, in telling a complex story with many layers and on an epic scale, it strove for a level of historical accuracy that is rare for TV.  This could not be done as well in a 2-hour movie - it merits 6 hours.At the center of the film is the conflict between two charismatic leaders.  O'Toole is the Roman general, who is hard yet reasonable and not cruel.  Strauss is the leader of the zealots:  hardly a religious fanatic, he wants to preserve the freedom of his people and is willing to risk everything to do so.  Both are deeply conflicted:  the aristocratic Roman is exhausted, having lost his beloved wife while on campaign and taking solace in drink.  Strauss is wracked with personal doubts, yet is a brilliant tactitian and natural leader.  After some good-faith negotiations that fail due to Roman politics, the two enter an end-game struggle that will decide both of their fates.  The acting is so good that the viewer can believe them completely.There are also plots within plots, which are very interesting.  On the one hand, O'Toole must contend with the poisonous creatures of Roman political intrigues, who interfere with his professional maneuvering in the field.  This pits him and his gifted military engineer against a number of his former intimates, perhaps even the emperor himself.  His idealism remains intact, if compromised by realities.  Another subplot is his taking on a concubine slave, the unbelievably beautiful Carrera in her prime.  On the other hand, the Jews are also fighting eachother, debating what course to take in ever murderous risks.  The performances are wonderfully subtle and nuanced, if at times melodramatic.Then there is the setting, which in the real place is absolutely spectacular.  They are fighting over a desert, which is of little strategic military value, highlighting the political nature of the conflict.  It is splendidly ironic in my viewing and the Roman engineering of a platform and siege vehicle is fascinating.As a history buff, I was not entirely comfortable with the ""take"" of the film.  It fits into official myths, which are very current in the contemporary Middle East, leaving little space to rival interpretations.  That is, there is a great controversy as to the true nature of the zealots:  the only written source is Josephous, who transcribed the tale from several alleged survivors and later used by Moshe Dayan as a propagandistic image for military training.  Their version does not entirely jibe with the archaeological evidence, which points to a less unified or accepted actions by the zealots.  Indeed, there is a blatant plug for Israeli nationalism at the beginning and end of the series, which explains Masada in crude patriotic terms.  It is the only thing that mars the series.Recommended.  It will stimulate and fascinate.",4,the best that TV mini-series can offer,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,2942,"['very', 'good', 'made-4-tv', 'melodrama', 'based', 'historical', 'myth', 'Jewish', 'struggle', 'Romans', 'So', 'far', 'could', 'see', 'telling', 'complex', 'story', 'many', 'layers', 'epic', 'scale', 'strove', 'level', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'rare', 'TV', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'as', 'well', '2-hour', 'movie', '6', 'hours.At', 'center', 'film', 'conflict', 'two', 'charismatic', 'leaders', ""O'Toole"", 'Roman', 'general', 'who', 'hard', 'yet', 'reasonable', 'not', 'cruel', 'Strauss', 'leader', 'zealots', 'hardly', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'preserve', 'freedom', 'people', 'willing', 'risk', 'everything', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'aristocratic', 'Roman', 'exhausted', 'having', 'lost', 'beloved', 'wife', 'campaign', 'taking', 'solace', 'drink', 'Strauss', 'wracked', 'personal', 'doubts', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'tactitian', 'natural', 'leader', 'good-faith', 'negotiations', 'fail', 'due', 'Roman', 'politics', 'two', 'enter', 'end-game', 'struggle', 'will', 'decide', 'fates', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'viewer', 'can', 'believe', 'are', 'also', 'plots', 'plots', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'hand', ""O'Toole"", 'must', 'contend', 'poisonous', 'creatures', 'Roman', 'political', 'intrigues', 'who', 'interfere', 'professional', 'maneuvering', 'field', 'gifted', 'military', 'engineer', 'number', 'former', 'intimates', 'perhaps', 'even', 'emperor', 'idealism', 'intact', 'compromised', 'realities', 'subplot', 'taking', 'concubine', 'slave', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'Carrera', 'prime', 'other', 'hand', 'Jews', 'are', 'also', 'fighting', 'eachother', 'debating', 'what', 'course', 'take', 'ever', 'murderous', 'risks', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'times', 'melodramatic.Then', 'setting', 'real', 'place', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'are', 'fighting', 'desert', 'little', 'strategic', 'military', 'value', 'highlighting', 'political', 'nature', 'conflict', 'splendidly', 'ironic', 'viewing', 'Roman', 'engineering', 'platform', 'siege', 'vehicle', 'fascinating.As', 'history', 'buff', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'take', 'film', 'official', 'myths', 'are', 'very', 'current', 'contemporary', 'Middle', 'East', 'leaving', 'little', 'space', 'rival', 'interpretations', 'great', 'controversy', 'true', 'nature', 'zealots', 'only', 'written', 'source', 'Josephous', 'who', 'transcribed', 'tale', 'several', 'alleged', 'survivors', 'later', 'used', 'Moshe', 'Dayan', 'propagandistic', 'image', 'military', 'training', 'version', 'not', 'entirely', 'jibe', 'archaeological', 'evidence', 'less', 'unified', 'accepted', 'actions', 'zealots', 'Indeed', 'blatant', 'plug', 'Israeli', 'nationalism', 'beginning', 'end', 'series', 'Masada', 'crude', 'patriotic', 'terms', 'only', 'thing', 'series.Recommended', 'will', 'stimulate', 'fascinate']",N/A

50431,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,0783222823,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[2, 2]","This two-disc set features four episodes with all six-and-a-half hours (383 minutes to be precise) of the epic 1981 ABC miniseries ""Masada,"" nominated for 13 Emmy awards. A great cast, clever opening sequence, historically rich script, and rousing battle scenes rescue a fairly uneven and talky American TV presentation from the early 1980s. The style here is in the vein of ""Shogun"" and other early 1980s TV films, emphasizing political intrigues and personal motives within a grand historical setting. But the film is duller than comparable 1980s miniseries productions like ""Shogun,"" ""Roots,"" ""North and South,"" and ""The Scarlet and the Black."" Despite the incredible number of nominations, ""Masada"" won only two Emmys, one for Best Score and one for Best Supporting Actor.An overall strength of this video is that it's the only major film portrayal of a little-known historical event: In the early AD 70s, Jewish zealots rose up in rebellion after Roman troops destroyed the Second Temple of Jerusalem in AD 70, leading to a protracted siege at the breathtaking mountaintop fortress of Masada that eventually destroyed the last vestiges of Jewish opposition to Roman occupation. It's pretty neat to see Hollywood tackle a 1st century story of Jews and Romans in the years after the life of Jesus Christ, contextualizing the gospels more clearly. The film's early image of the Temple on fire as Romans crush the Jewish revolt in Jerusalem is especially iconic, showing us something Christ had predicted, a key event in Jewish history (Judaism has been rabbinic rather than priestly ever since) that is rarely dramatized on film. The unconventional opening montage of the modern Israeli army mustering out at Masada -- a major tourist site for Israel -- in tribute to the Jewish martyrs there is rousing with its visuals of the ruins and Jerry Goldsmith's Emmy-winning orchestral theme. The depiction of Roman politics and Jewish hopes of a messiah to defeat the Romans are both spot on. The cast is pretty incredible with the late Peter O'Toole particularly strong as the charismatic Roman general, David Warner at his best in his Emmy-winning role as a power hungry Roman politician, and several others making a strong impression. Supporting players include familiar faces like Nigel Davenport, Barbara Carerra before her James Bond gig in ""Never Say Never Again,"" Anthony Quayle, Denis Quilley, Vernon Dobtcheff, Warren Clarke, and Joseph Wiseman nearly 20 years after his turn as ""Dr. No.""On the other hand, the movie takes an interminable amount of time to get to the spectacular battle scenes, going through endless military camp and Roman court scenes as it gradually gives us the meat of the story. Many of these scenes are more episodic than narrative-driven, failing to move the story forward in any noticeable way, and there's no overall sweep to the screenplay. Much of the character material feels designed to pad the miniseries out to four 90-minute episodes, maximizing TV ratings rather than telling a story in the most efficient way possible. The film tends to spend more time talking about things than showing them, but things improve as the conflict between Romans and Jews gradually builds in cat-and-mouse battles to a climactic showdown.Another flaw is the lead Jewish character. Peter Strauss is a veteran of more miniseries roles (including the excellent ""Joan of Arc"" opposite Leelee Sobieski in 1999) than almost anyone in Hollywood, but he fails to find much depth in his lead role here as the Jewish leader Eleazar ben Yair. Despite a few moments of burning intensity and heroic defiance, he generally comes across here as a one-note religious zealot, failing to find any nuance in his scenes with the legendary Peter O'Toole. Watching them together, one senses that Strauss is doing a Charlton Heston impression here more than acting, and his limitations come across strongly opposite the brilliant O'Toole whose performance as the Roman general shines with lively energy. O'Toole is relaxed and having fun, but Strauss gives a merely adequate performance, struggling to find the right emotions in each scene. I like Strauss in the right role, but he's being asked to do too much in this one, and it's a bit painful to watch. To compensate, the screenplay gives Strauss anachronistic religious doubts, portraying him as a self-reliant agnostic in the contemporary American mold who is more interested in blood feuds than God. But this approach backfires because it detracts from the Strauss character's credibility and realism, rendering an already-bland character even blander.That brings me to the film's deeper flaw, which is specifically its failed attempt to present both the Roman and Jewish sides fairly. With O'Toole and Warner representing the Roman side, the Jews under Strauss's growling visage don't stand a chance in the battle for audience sympathy, and I'm afraid the oppressive Romans come across more relatable than the Jews due to the likability of these actors. Quite frankly, this material would have worked better as a rousing underdog story of the Jewish fight for independence anyway, rather than as a two-sided war story that revels in depicting the efficient Roman war machine. But the fact that the occupying Roman generals have more compelling stories than the Jewish rebels, who spend long stretches of the film off-camera while we learn of Roman machinations and strategy, really weighs the film down. O'Toole is just too darn likable for us to sympathize deeply with the Jews here, or even to feel compelled to choose between them, thus robbing the film of any real dramatic tension. Invited to view the Jewish rebels as one-dimensional zealots rather than deeply religious people with a legitimate grievance against Rome, we end up with a handsome historical spectacle that features appealing battle scenes, but little insight into the Jewish or Roman instigators of these great events. With the story effectively told from the Roman perspective, it also tells us little about the impact of Israel's failed revolt on Jewish culture and religion today. While ""Masada"" is worth seeing, it won't stay with you very long afterwards, and it won't impress you as the best of its genre or sub-genre.",4,Epic historical miniseries on Jewish revolt against

50432,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0783222823,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","Back in 1981 this epic mini-series about the ill-fated Jewish rebellion against Roman rule pulled in what was then the biggest TV audience of all time, yet it's languished on the shelf forgotten for the past couple of decades. This DVD isn't even released by producers Universal and comes with no extras, though it does include the six-hour-plus series, but not the abridged feature film version released outside the US as The Antagonists, which apparently featured some different scenes (the abridged version was not a success: in the UK it had the dubious honor of being the lowest-grossing film of it's year).As with most siege epics, the action is limited to the beginning and the end, with much of the interim filled in with intrigue and character development while we wait for the big battle that in this case, famously, never actually happens. Not altogether surprisingly it spends more screen time with the Romans than with the zealots - even if the zealots' strategy was more than simply watching and waiting while sporadically taunting their would-be conquerors, with their penchant for spectacle and infighting, the Romans are always better dramatic value in these sorts of epics. Certainly Peter O'Toole effortlessly dominates the series as the humane Roman commander forced by the political situation back in Rome to fight the rebels rather than negotiate with them only to find himself facing mutiny, senatorial spies and other political animals as well as heat, windstorms and not enough water before his legions can even start to virtually move mountains to reach the clifftop fortress of Masada. By contrast, then-reigning king of the miniseries Peter Strauss has less to work with as his character spends much of the series waiting and trying to raise moral with only a few half-hearted attempts at soul-searching along the way, only really coming into his own in the still powerful final scenes.The supporting cast is impressive, with a line-up of familiar Brits including David Warner, Anthony Quayle, Timothy West, Dennis Quilley, Anthony Valentine and Nigel Davenport making up the officers, emperors and senators while the likes of Jack Watson, Norman Rossington, Warren Clarke, Michael Elphick and Nick Brimble swell the Roman ranks. The Judeans have to make do with Barbara Carrera, Joseph Wiseman, David Opatoshu and Paul L. Smith. For the most part they're blessed with exceptionally good dialogue with few lapses (though Anthony Valentine's ""I'm a tribune, darling"" is an unwelcome moment of unintended camp) thanks to Joel Oliansky's surprisingly intelligent and often witty screenplay, which boasts a good understanding of the politics of the day on both sides and an ability to offer memorable character moments for even the bit players - siege engineer's Quayle's briefing on the practicalities how to get the most out of slave labor is a perfect example of how to juggle exposition and background research without it seeming like a history lecture.Visually it's often impressive too, although at times Boris Sagal's direction is caught between location naturalism and old-school studio work. The destruction of Jerusalem has something of the look of a late De Mille epic to it, with Albert Whitlock's old school columns of fire matte paintings having an almost storybook stylisation that wouldn't look out of place in The Ten Commandments but despite some obvious studio interior-`exteriors' in a few scenes, it's a genuinely spectacular production from a time when the big-screen epic had long fallen from favor. There's also an extraordinarily good score from Jerry Goldsmith (with additional music by Morton Gould based on his themes) at the peak of his powers even if his great elegiac finale cue was never used. Still pretty impressive stuff.",5,"""We have won a rock in the middle of a wasteland on the shore of a poisoned sea.""",1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3780,"['Back', '1981', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'ill-fated', 'Jewish', 'rebellion', 'Roman', 'rule', 'pulled', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'biggest', 'TV', 'audience', 'time', 'languished', 'shelf', 'forgotten', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'even', 'released', 'producers', 'Universal', 'extras', 'include', 'six-hour-plus', 'series', 'not', 'abridged', 'feature', 'film', 'version', 'released', 'US', 'Antagonists', 'apparently', 'featured', 'different', 'scenes', 'abridged', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'success', 'UK', 'had', 'dubious', 'honor', 'being', 'lowest-grossing', 'film', 'year', '.As', 'most', 'siege', 'epics', 'action', 'limited', 'beginning', 'end', 'much', 'interim', 'filled', 'intrigue', 'character', 'development', 'wait', 'big', 'battle', 'case', 'famously', 'never', 'actually', 'Not', 'altogether', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Romans', 'zealots', 'even', 'zealots', 'strategy', 'was', 'more', 'simply', 'watching', 'waiting', 'sporadically', 'taunting', 'would-be', 'conquerors', 'penchant', 'spectacle', 'infighting', 'Romans', 'are', 'always', 'better', 'dramatic', 'value', 'sorts', 'epics', 'Certainly', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'effortlessly', 'series', 'humane', 'Roman', 'commander', 'forced', 'political', 'situation', 'back', 'Rome', 'fight', 'rebels', 'rather', 'negotiate', 'only', 'find', 'facing', 'mutiny', 'senatorial', 'spies', 'other', 'political', 'animals', 'as', 'well', 'heat', 'windstorms', 'not', 'enough', 'water', 'legions', 'can', 'even', 'start', 'virtually', 'move', 'mountains', 'reach', 'clifftop', 'fortress', 'Masada', 'contrast', 'then-reigning', 'king', 'miniseries', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'less', 'work', 'character', 'much', 'series', 'waiting', 'trying', 'raise', 'moral', 'only', 'few', 'half-hearted', 'attempts', 'soul-searching', 'way', 'only', 'really', 'coming', 'own', 'still', 'powerful', 'final', 'scenes.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'impressive', 'line-up', 'familiar', 'Brits', 'including', 'David', 'Warner', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'Timothy', 'West', 'Dennis', 'Quilley', 'Anthony', 'Valentine', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'making', 'up', 'officers', 'emperors', 'senators', 'likes', 'Jack', 'Watson', 'Norman', 'Rossington', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'Michael', 'Elphick', 'Nick', 'Brimble', 'swell', 'Roman', 'Judeans', 'have', 'make', 'do', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', 'Joseph', 'Wiseman', 'David', 'Opatoshu', 'Paul', 'L.', 'Smith', 'most', 'part', ""'re"", 'blessed', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'dialogue', 'few', 'lapses', 'Anthony', 'Valentine', ""'m"", 'tribune', 'darling', 'unwelcome', 'moment', 'unintended', 'camp', 'thanks', 'Joel', 'Oliansky', 'surprisingly', 'intelligent', 'often', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'good', 'understanding', 'politics', 'day', 'sides', 'ability', 'offer', 'memorable', 'character', 'moments', 'even', 'bit', 'players', 'siege', 'engineer', 'Quayle', 'briefing', 'practicalities', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'slave', 'labor', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'juggle', 'exposition', 'background', 'research', 'seeming', 'history', 'lecture.Visually', 'often', 'impressive', 'too', 'times', 'Boris', 'Sagal', 'direction', 'caught', 'location', 'naturalism', 'old-school', 'studio', 'work', 'destruction', 'Jerusalem', 'something', 'look', 'late', 'De', 'Mille', 'epic', 'Albert', 'Whitlock', 'old', 'school', 'columns', 'fire', 'matte', 'paintings', 'having', 'almost', 'storybook', 'stylisation', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'place', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'obvious', 'studio', 'interior-', 'exteriors', 'few', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'spectacular', 'production', 'time', 'when', 'big-screen', 'epic', 'had', 'long', 'fallen', 'favor', 'also', 'extraordinarily', 'good', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'additional', 'music', 'Morton', 'Gould', 'based', 'themes', 'peak', 'powers', 'even', 'great', 'elegiac', 'finale', 'cue', 'was', 'never', 'used', 'Still', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'stuff']",N/A
