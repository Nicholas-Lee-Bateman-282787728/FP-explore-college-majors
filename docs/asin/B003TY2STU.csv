1362942,A2CISZ4JLKQRJA,B003TY2STU,C. Richard,"[4, 4]","This is a review of the third (and sadly the last) season of a very quirky and hilarious British comedy called Clatterford in the US and Jam and Jerusalem in the UK. I highly recommend this season's episodes - the first two seasons are maybe even better than the third, so don't miss those either.Clatterford is about a group of people who live in a small town (I guess they would say village) in the UK called Clatterford. These people are for the most part fairly ""eccentric"" and all of them are fun to watch.One main focus of this season concerns Sal's trying to cut the apron strings with her adult daughter who returned home with a child and who recently married. The daughter, husband and child are living in an old library bookmobile that they have converted. Only problem, they have it parked in Sal's driveway. It takes a lot of effort to move them - and then they don't get all that far.Sal, who lost her husband at the start of the first season, may have found a love interest. He is a very tall Scotsman working on converting a barn behind Sal's house. They do not get along at first, but that starts to change. Charles Dance is involved here - thanks to Rosie.Rosie is played by Dawn French - and she is great in this part. Poor Rosie has a split personality, but she is relatively harmless. She does get into some ""interesting"" situations and wears some very odd clothes.The vicar finds a love interest among the regular characters - believe it or not.There is lots more going on that is truly funny and entertaining as well. I think the interview when Sal joins the gym is priceless.Watch the first two seasons then take a look at this one. You won't be sorry. Too bad this is the last season.",5,Great Program - Too Bad This Is the Last Season,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,1708,"['review', 'third', 'sadly', 'last', 'season', 'very', 'quirky', 'hilarious', 'British', 'comedy', 'called', 'Clatterford', 'US', 'Jam', 'Jerusalem', 'UK', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', 'episodes', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'third', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'either.Clatterford', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'guess', 'would', 'say', 'village', 'UK', 'called', 'Clatterford', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'fairly', 'eccentric', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.One', 'main', 'focus', 'season', 'Sal', 'trying', 'cut', 'apron', 'strings', 'adult', 'daughter', 'who', 'returned', 'home', 'child', 'who', 'recently', 'married', 'daughter', 'husband', 'child', 'are', 'living', 'old', 'library', 'bookmobile', 'have', 'converted', 'Only', 'problem', 'have', 'parked', 'Sal', 'driveway', 'lot', 'effort', 'move', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'far.Sal', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'start', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'love', 'interest', 'very', 'tall', 'Scotsman', 'working', 'converting', 'barn', 'Sal', 'house', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'first', 'change', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'involved', 'here', 'thanks', 'Rosie.Rosie', 'played', 'Dawn', 'French', 'great', 'part', 'Poor', 'Rosie', 'split', 'personality', 'relatively', 'harmless', 'get', 'interesting', 'situations', 'very', 'odd', 'clothes.The', 'vicar', 'love', 'interest', 'regular', 'characters', 'believe', 'lots', 'more', 'going', 'truly', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'interview', 'when', 'Sal', 'gym', 'priceless.Watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'take', 'look', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Too', 'bad', 'last', 'season']",Clatterford: Season 3

1362944,AUVFBZ2ZJ6M95,B003TY2STU,Devon Bedford,"[34, 37]","This has been a terrific series.  Apparently lots of people don't ""get"" it.  So many people seemed disappointed that it wasn't AbFab.  I loved Ab Fab--own the whole set, but that was then and Clatterford is a whole other, equally funny, thing.  Gentler and more woman-centered than Vicar of Dibley, but with an equally compelling cast of actors developing just-on-the-edge of-real characters.  Maybe this is what happens to Boomer women when they manage to survive the hyperactivity of the late 20th century urban life  (Patsy and Eddie) and the quest for romance and lasting bonding with the perfect man (Geraldine) and live the unique, authentic, even eccentric, lives that they can have when they have some wisdom and live in Devonshire.Also, it's just so blasted funny to see what women get up to when they are in the ""freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose"" stage of life.Jannifer Saunders is totally genius and her dialogue frees up all the actors, especially the fabulous Dawn French, to go mad.If this show is ending because of lack of audience interest, that's a shame.  If it is ending because Saunders feels she's ready to move on, well we can await her next venture enthusiastically.  Ricky Gervais, another genius comedy writer/actor, always manages to know when to leave us laughing and go on to the next new-new thing too.To quote Pauline McLynn, ""More anon!""

Because Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were directly involved, I was confident the series would be hilarious. While it was definitely NOT hilarious - and a bit more like Ab Fab rather than the Vicar of Dibley humor-wise - the more I watched it the more it grew on me. By Season 2, I craved spending time with Sal, Tash, Spike, Tip, Rosie (CharlesDance!CharlesDance!CharlesDance!)and all the ladies of the Guild. After Season 3, I was feeling slight withdrawals and a sense of disappointment that there were no more episodes to come. This is a sweet, charming series whose characters are warm, caring and, of course, quirky. The subtle humor comes through after multiple viewings, but watching this series again and again should be no problem as you, too, will feel like a beloved member of the Clatterford Ladies Guild as well as the village.
