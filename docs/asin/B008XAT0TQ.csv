I must confess that I have yet to view Birdy.  Yet, whether it is good or bad a film it does not take away from the disc.  The picture transfers are tremendous---although the audio is a bit off but what can you expect from such an inexpensive disc.

1577919,A30XR3EIN0IVA5,B008XAT0TQ,Ronald E. Weber,"[1, 1]","A nice composite of three films that should have made more noise at the box-office and be far better remembered than they are.THE LAST DETAIL is a great character piece about three military types, (not the cliched ones usually seen in movies, but real guys, pulled off the streets) drawn by actors who are perfect in their observations of humanity. No question, this is the very best Nicholson performance of all time. He was nominated for an Oscar, but was not given it because of its blasphemous four-letter dialogue, and the film's ultimate sleeper status.  This is a real slice of life, hilarious, believable, and quite moving.AVALON is effective, late 40s-early 50s, memorabilia about a family who start a business selling those exotic instruments of the future, television sets. Well-cast, well-acted Americana.GARDENS OF STONE is solid Coppola, a well done drama about the life of a doomed young soldier. A great cast and a good solid plotline help, but this wasn't a huge hit, simply because it wasn't on a par with THE GODFATHER, which is what everybody expected from him in those days.A good entry, a one-purchase, inexpensive composite of three favorites i'd already purchased on laser disc, now in the current format; the only problem is there are no frills, no commentaries, trailers, other extras, or even subtitles",4,Three overlooked gems,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1329,"['nice', 'composite', 'three', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'noise', 'box-office', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'remembered', 'are.THE', 'LAST', 'DETAIL', 'great', 'character', 'piece', 'three', 'military', 'types', 'not', 'cliched', 'ones', 'usually', 'seen', 'movies', 'real', 'guys', 'pulled', 'off', 'streets', 'drawn', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'perfect', 'observations', 'humanity', 'question', 'very', 'best', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'time', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'blasphemous', 'four-letter', 'dialogue', 'film', 'ultimate', 'sleeper', 'status', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'hilarious', 'believable', 'quite', 'moving.AVALON', 'effective', 'late', '40s-early', '50s', 'memorabilia', 'family', 'who', 'start', 'business', 'selling', 'exotic', 'instruments', 'future', 'television', 'sets', 'Well-cast', 'well-acted', 'Americana.GARDENS', 'OF', 'STONE', 'solid', 'Coppola', 'well', 'done', 'drama', 'life', 'doomed', 'young', 'soldier', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'solid', 'plotline', 'help', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'hit', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'par', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'what', 'everybody', 'expected', 'days.A', 'good', 'entry', 'one-purchase', 'inexpensive', 'composite', 'three', 'favorites', 'i', ""'d"", 'already', 'purchased', 'laser', 'disc', 'now', 'current', 'format', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'frills', 'commentaries', 'trailers', 'other', 'extras', 'even', 'subtitles']",The Last Detail/Avalon/Gardens of Stone/Birdy - 4-pack
