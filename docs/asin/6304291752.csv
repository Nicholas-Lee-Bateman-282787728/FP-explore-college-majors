What it turns out to be is a simple mid-level intensity workout aimed to lose weight.Leslie Sansone has been a champion instructor and advocate for walking as a critical form of exercise, and she offers a variation of workout videos on walking. But here, walk in the comfort of your own home.The 1996 approximately 35 minute tape has a warmup of about 4 minutes. The 2-mile walk is total of 25 minutes 2 miles at 4 mph. After the 25 minutes, a slow down with stretch. The meter displayed that pops up periodically to give you an idea how many minutes and how far in proximity to mileage you have accomplished per hour.As you participate, you can watch a meter that displays time, distance, and miles per hour. The ""walk"" consists of exercise marching steps, grapevine, kickback, walk and tap. This isn't vigorous at all, what is pleasing is that there aren't any complicated steps, and Leslie isn't constantly incorporating changes to confuse us.The video is unpretentious, average looking people in normal workout attire. Music is paced to the workout, but nothing compares like selecting your own. If you prefer to lose weight, get outdoors, do fast aerobic walking, pick some motivating rhythmic music on for the walkman, and move!!! But if the cold keeps you in, this is a great alternative......MzRizz.",5,"Easy to do, low impact, great for a rainy day!",1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,1375,"['generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'relish', 'walking', 'exercise', 'programs', 'home', 'What', 'out', 'be', 'simple', 'mid-level', 'intensity', 'workout', 'aimed', 'lose', 'weight.Leslie', 'Sansone', 'been', 'champion', 'instructor', 'advocate', 'walking', 'critical', 'form', 'exercise', 'variation', 'workout', 'videos', 'walking', 'here', 'walk', 'comfort', 'own', 'home.The', '1996', 'approximately', '35', 'minute', 'tape', 'warmup', '4', 'minutes', '2-mile', 'walk', 'total', '25', 'minutes', '2', 'miles', '4', 'mph', '25', 'minutes', 'slow', 'down', 'stretch', 'meter', 'displayed', 'up', 'periodically', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'many', 'minutes', 'how', 'far', 'proximity', 'mileage', 'have', 'accomplished', 'hour.As', 'participate', 'can', 'watch', 'meter', 'time', 'distance', 'miles', 'hour', 'walk', 'consists', 'exercise', 'marching', 'steps', 'grapevine', 'kickback', 'walk', 'tap', ""n't"", 'vigorous', 'what', 'pleasing', 'are', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'steps', 'Leslie', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'incorporating', 'changes', 'confuse', 'us.The', 'video', 'unpretentious', 'average', 'looking', 'people', 'normal', 'workout', 'attire', 'Music', 'paced', 'workout', 'nothing', 'compares', 'selecting', 'own', 'prefer', 'lose', 'weight', 'get', 'outdoors', 'do', 'fast', 'aerobic', 'walking', 'pick', 'motivating', 'rhythmic', 'music', 'walkman', 'move', 'cold', 'keeps', 'great', 'alternative', 'MzRizz']",Leslie Sansone - 2 Mile Walk VHS

Since my husband leaves too early for me to go walking without leaving my daughter home alone, I thought this video might make a nice alternative.  It really does!  It moves quickly, with little need for instruction because the movements are all very basic, but it gets the heart rate going pretty well.  Leslie gets a tiny bit annoying, but anybody who is perky at 5:30 AM can get annoying.

413557,A2AYJJAFNSGSU1,6304291752,C. Bennett,"[10, 10]","If you are a veteran of the Walk Away The Pounds 2-mile walk, you will have no problem completing this two-mile, 30-minute walk. It is a do-able supplement to the Walk Away workouts, for days when you don't want to use weights and need a little more variety. This DVD does not have any strength training, and uses very little in the way of arm movements.However, there are a few things that really date this DVD. Be aware that this is a re-released old workout from 1992. The music is very dated. Leslie is also continually referring to using a VCR with the workout: &quot;Fast forward to the cool down&quot; or &quot;if you didn't catch this step, rewind and do it again.&quot; The clothes and hair styles also really date this DVD, from the &quot;big sock&quot; look to the layered leotards.The moves themselves are more complicated than her Walk Away workout. For example, she has you doing several variations on side steps - lots and lots of 80's style grapevines, stepping to the corners at an angle, and even backwards.The bonus features on this DVD include a short biography of Leslie (non-interactive), and a URL link to Current Video (the manufacturer). The DVD features a three-minute introduction, where the walkers themselves are interviewed about the walking workouts and their success with them. Leslie then introduces the walkers (the same walkers as the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; DVD). What I really appreciate about Leslie's choice of walkers is that they are &quot;real&quot; people. One of the walkers lost over 100 pounds!While I really appreciate Leslie's Walk Away Workouts, I find this release to still need some tweaking (how about a make over?). I only use it occassionally, to throw some variety into my workouts.

413558,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,6304291752,C. Daly,"[8, 9]","When I first tried this DVD I found is frustrating and difficult.  I expected it to be more like Leslie Sansone's other DVDs that I had been using:  the Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 mile, and the Miracle Mile.  This workout is from the same set as Miracle Mile and has the same participants.  This set is from the early 90s and it shows in their clothing and the music.What's different is the variety in movement.  This is much closer to a regular hi/lo aerobics video than a walking video.  There is still walking, but there is more movement around the room, more variety in steps, and more mixing up the steps.  For example, we would do two knee lifts, then two kick backs.  Or we'd do a grapevine, knee lift, march, grapevine knee lift.  It still wasn't too complex, though.  There was also more moving around the room.  I did her other workouts in my bedroom; for this one I had to move to our more spacious living room.  Finally, it's more intense than her other workouts.  You actually finish the two miles in 25 minutes, but there are around five minutes of cool down after that.So at first these changes annoyed me.  I put the workout away and continued to practice with her other workouts.  Then I got bored of those and picked this one up again.  Surprise, surprise, I loved it.  I enjoyed the changes, the variety.  It was a good next step for a challenge.  If you're totally new to exercise, I recommend her Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 mile set, which are simpler, but if you're looking for something a bit more challenging, but still only 30 minutes, this is it.",5,A step up from Walk Away the Pounds,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1576,"['When', 'first', 'tried', 'DVD', 'found', 'frustrating', 'difficult', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'other', 'DVDs', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', '1', '2', 'mile', 'Miracle', 'Mile', 'workout', 'same', 'set', 'Miracle', 'Mile', 'same', 'participants', 'set', 'early', '90s', 'clothing', 'music.What', 'different', 'variety', 'movement', 'much', 'closer', 'regular', 'hi/lo', 'aerobics', 'video', 'walking', 'video', 'still', 'walking', 'more', 'movement', 'room', 'more', 'variety', 'steps', 'more', 'mixing', 'up', 'steps', 'example', 'would', 'do', 'two', 'knee', 'lifts', 'then', 'two', 'kick', 'backs', ""'d"", 'do', 'grapevine', 'knee', 'lift', 'march', 'grapevine', 'knee', 'lift', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'complex', 'though', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'moving', 'room', 'did', 'other', 'workouts', 'bedroom', 'one', 'had', 'move', 'more', 'spacious', 'living', 'room', 'Finally', 'more', 'intense', 'other', 'workouts', 'actually', 'finish', 'two', 'miles', '25', 'minutes', 'are', 'five', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'that.So', 'first', 'changes', 'annoyed', 'put', 'workout', 'away', 'continued', 'practice', 'other', 'workouts', 'Then', 'got', 'bored', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'again', 'Surprise', 'surprise', 'loved', 'enjoyed', 'changes', 'variety', 'was', 'good', 'next', 'step', 'challenge', ""'re"", 'totally', 'new', 'exercise', 'recommend', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', '1', '2', 'mile', 'set', 'are', 'simpler', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'still', 'only', '30', 'minutes']",Leslie Sansone - 2 Mile Walk VHS

It also helps to see how Leslie Sansone cheerily encourages us to work out and says it's OK to slow down, if needed. Just listening to Leslie is like a dose of sunshine and encouragement.",5,Wow!

Naturally, the DVD version is much more convenient to use as I can go directly to the portion I need without fast forwarding or rewinding the tape when I'm done.For a klutz like me, Leslie Sansone has been a God send. Even when I've been at my heaviest, this video was possible to do. And yet even though it is easy with no complicated dance steps, it certainly works! No matter what my level of fitness is, this video gets my heart pumping!Leslie is upbeat, positive, and encouraging. When she smiles directly at the camera and says &quot;Good!&quot; I feel she is talking to me! The exercisers who join her on the video are regular people, not all of whom are at the peak of perfection, which makes me feel right at home. Finally, the exercises take very little room, so I can do the video in a spare bedroom or in the living room.I've never gotten tired of this video, but just to expand my exercise horizons, I've also ordered several more Leslie Sansone DVDs.",5,Easy and Effective,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,1075,"['favorite', 'excercise', 'video', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'VHS', 'tape', 'version', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'Naturally', 'DVD', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'convenient', 'use', 'can', 'go', 'directly', 'portion', 'need', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'rewinding', 'tape', 'when', ""'m"", 'done.For', 'klutz', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'been', 'God', 'send', 'Even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'heaviest', 'video', 'was', 'possible', 'do', 'yet', 'even', 'easy', 'complicated', 'dance', 'steps', 'certainly', 'matter', 'what', 'level', 'fitness', 'video', 'heart', 'pumping', 'Leslie', 'upbeat', 'positive', 'encouraging', 'When', 'directly', 'camera', 'quot', 'Good', 'quot', 'feel', 'talking', 'exercisers', 'who', 'join', 'video', 'are', 'regular', 'people', 'not', 'whom', 'are', 'peak', 'perfection', 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'Finally', 'exercises', 'take', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'can', 'do', 'video', 'spare', 'bedroom', 'living', 'room.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'gotten', 'tired', 'video', 'just', 'expand', 'exercise', 'horizons', ""'ve"", 'also', 'ordered', 'several', 'more', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs']",Leslie Sansone - 2 Mile Walk VHS

I am not intimdated by the usual &quot;models&quot; that some fitness tapes seem to use. People come in all shapes and sizes and leslie seems to know this fact.
