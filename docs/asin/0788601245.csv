78015,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,0788601245,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","Alright, even all these years after Faces of Death hit dvd, some people STILL don't know if it's real or fake. And still, people who've watched this dvd still don't know for sure, or swear that everything on here's real. Well you know what? If you watch the Fact or Fiction documentary, which is included on this dvd, one of the first things the director admits is that 90% of the footage on here is fake. Case closed. Did you really think that an execution via beheading was real when a bunch of intestines and other organs come pouring out of the victim's neck? Did you not see the difference between the monkey when it was alive and put in the restraining device, and the completely different monkey after it was 'killed'? How people are blind to this, is beyond me. Regardless, The Original Faces of Death is an interesting movie, but for something that got so much hype, and even before I saw the documentary, I was very disappointed, and that was when I was 16 years old and on anti-depressants.There's no real story to Faces of Death- it's just scene after scene of violence and gore with brief narrations for each segment. There's a quick, odd one of a body washed ashore, one of a woman jumping off the ledge of a building to unfitting (but funny) music, the infamous monkey brain scene, a cult who rub themselves with blood, a prisoner being electrocuted and more. There's actually a good variety of scenes here, and with the footage being as grainy as it is, it adds a bit of creepiness to the whole thing, but it's so obviously fake that I can only recommend this for people who love B-movie kind of violence and gore, or those who know this is fake and are looking to get some good laughs out of it.For those looking for some REAL footage of things like this, I recommend the Banned From Television series. While there aren't many people segments, what's on there is very much real, and there's a reason it's called Banned From Television.

The human deaths are obviously contrived, but that doesn't diminish the quality.  You  have to imagine that things like this really do happen in the world.  By  doing so, you really get a feel for what is going on.  Although the feature  was amusing, the Fact or Fiction part was downright comical!  The bald  doctor with bushy eyebrows was the best bad actor in the series.  He's  great because he is such a terrible actor.  My favorite part was the end  credits.  Thomas Jefferson played a part in making the film as did John  Locke.  Another guy named Richard Head also played a key role.  I don't  think the film would be as powerful if they didn't rely on the master  skills of Johnny Getyerkokov.  Without him, the film would have been void  of any substance.  Overall, I think this fake snuff film was great!

A bunch of teens crammed into a living-room, getting drunk / high, and watching this film was the extent of the evening's festivities. These parties were quite popular. I avoided them. Today, I watched the original film for the first time. FACES OF DEATH is a Mondo-film, a mock / shock-umentary designed to sicken, repulse, and titillate. It contains surgery, corpses, dogfighting, vicious animal attacks, headhunters, chicken decapitation, slaughterhouse gore, monkey bludgeoning, seal clubbing, poaching, assassination, autopsies, etc. All of this bloodletting is narrated in monotone fashion, and accompanied by inane -by design- music. The narrator attempts to add reason and / or purpose to the obviously pointless, mindless proceedings. Though it blends both real and -obviously- fake footage, the movie still manages to move along fluidly. It also possesses a certain, demented anti-charm.

78018,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,0788601245,Blu Review Obscura,"[0, 1]","Faces Of Death Blu Ray ReviewDistributor : Gorgon Video, US.Well what can I possibly say about this film that hasn't already been stated somewhere else?Probably not very much, so I think I will just stick to the facts regarding the blu ray release.This is the US blu ray release put out by Gorgon Video. First off, the disc is not region locked so great news for those who have to worry about these sort of things as it will play on any blu ray player worldwide.The film is presented in a 1080p 1.85:1 Anamorphic transfer which looks unbelievably good for this type of documentary film. Some print damage remains throughout, however I got the impression that this is supposed to be present in certain scenes and is also present in the original elements of stock footage used in the film.The blu ray master is taken from a Japanese theatre print so is a little different to the regular version people have grown up with. The print being from a Japanese source, contains a fogging effect to some shots of genitalia present throughout the film. This should come as no surprise, as the Japanese seem always to have a problem with this type of thing. In addition, a seen involving a prison inmate being executed in a gas chamber is not present in the film. Apparently the explanation for this, is that the particular scene was not present in the original theatrical versions and was later added into the home video prints. The scene in question is however presented on the disc as a deleted scene.The audio on the disc has 5.1 and 2.0 English options. The sound does seem a little tinny in parts but again I'm sure it is how the film was originally made.As far as extras are concerned, there are a couple of featurettes; one involving creating the FX, another titled Choice Cuts which interviews the films editor. There is also an out-take real, theatrical trailer and the before mentioned deleted scene. The best extra without question, has to be the excellent commentary track by the films director Conan LeCilaire. During this extensive commentary he talks about which scenes are real and which are re-enacted. He also talks about how they made the effects on the re-enacted scenes and also points out various actors he knows playing the parts in the film. He even plays about 5 or 6 different parts himself. Along with all of this information, other topics discussed include; obtaining various stock footage, the sequels to Faces of Death and the other films that later copied the Faces of Death series. This commentary really is one of the best I have heard for a film and the amount of information on offer is incredible.Although it will always remain a controversial film, it somehow seems a must have for horror collections and I honestly took a lot from watching the film with the commentary track playing and it has reignited my interest in the film itself.With the excellent extras on offer and the fact that the film itself has never looked as good, I highly doubt a better version could ever be released, so this blu ray should be the last word on the film.Love or hate the film, this blu ray is an excellent release.Blu Review Obscura - find us on Facebook",4,Blu Review 2 Faces of Death,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,3165,"['Faces', 'Death', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'ReviewDistributor', 'Gorgon', 'Video', 'US.Well', 'what', 'can', 'possibly', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'stated', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Probably', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'think', 'will', 'just', 'stick', 'facts', 'regarding', 'blu', 'ray', 'release.This', 'US', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'put', 'out', 'Gorgon', 'Video', 'First', 'disc', 'not', 'region', 'locked', 'so', 'great', 'news', 'who', 'have', 'worry', 'sort', 'things', 'will', 'play', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'worldwide.The', 'film', 'presented', '1080p', '1.85:1', 'Anamorphic', 'transfer', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'type', 'documentary', 'film', 'print', 'damage', 'however', 'got', 'impression', 'supposed', 'be', 'present', 'certain', 'scenes', 'also', 'present', 'original', 'elements', 'stock', 'footage', 'used', 'film.The', 'blu', 'ray', 'master', 'taken', 'Japanese', 'theatre', 'print', 'so', 'little', 'different', 'regular', 'version', 'people', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'print', 'being', 'Japanese', 'source', 'fogging', 'effect', 'shots', 'genitalia', 'present', 'film', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Japanese', 'seem', 'always', 'have', 'problem', 'type', 'thing', 'addition', 'seen', 'involving', 'prison', 'inmate', 'being', 'executed', 'gas', 'chamber', 'not', 'present', 'film', 'Apparently', 'explanation', 'particular', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'original', 'theatrical', 'versions', 'was', 'later', 'added', 'home', 'video', 'prints', 'scene', 'question', 'however', 'presented', 'disc', 'deleted', 'scene.The', 'audio', 'disc', '5.1', '2.0', 'English', 'options', 'sound', 'seem', 'little', 'tinny', 'parts', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'made.As', 'far', 'extras', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'one', 'involving', 'creating', 'FX', 'titled', 'Choice', 'Cuts', 'films', 'editor', 'also', 'out-take', 'real', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'before', 'mentioned', 'deleted', 'scene', 'best', 'extra', 'question', 'be', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track', 'films', 'director', 'Conan', 'LeCilaire', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'are', 're-enacted', 'also', 'how', 'made', 'effects', 're-enacted', 'scenes', 'also', 'out', 'various', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'film', 'even', '5', '6', 'different', 'parts', 'information', 'other', 'topics', 'discussed', 'include', 'obtaining', 'various', 'stock', 'footage', 'sequels', 'Faces', 'Death', 'other', 'films', 'later', 'copied', 'Faces', 'Death', 'series', 'commentary', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'amount', 'information', 'offer', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'controversial', 'film', 'somehow', 'must', 'have', 'horror', 'collections', 'honestly', 'took', 'lot', 'watching', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'playing', 'reignited', 'interest', 'film', 'excellent', 'extras', 'offer', 'fact', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'good', 'highly', 'doubt', 'better', 'version', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'blu', 'ray', 'should', 'be', 'last', 'word', 'film.Love', 'hate', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'excellent', 'release.Blu', 'Review', 'Obscura', 'find', 'Facebook']",N/A

It isn't just random violence with no connection whatsoever, and isn't tasteless as one would immediately think it would be.  There is a narrator looking behind every aspect of Death.  Although this may be found in the horror section of your local video store, it makes far more sense for this series of films to be labeled as documentaries, even if much of it is faked.  I have a strong stomach and am interested in the psyche of the mind and so forth.  This goes into why we enjoy, create, retaliate against, mimic, love, and hate violence.  Oddly enough, this installment seemed to drag along at certain points with it being 105 minutes and oddly enough I was let down a bit in terms of what I felt would have been on here.  If you are a film student/critique you will easily notice which sections are fake and which are real or stock footage.  Some of the fake scenes may be reenactments but you can tell the electrocution chair scene is fake because of how many times the camera angles change.  Camera angles do not change that often in documentaries, thus a dead give away that it or at least some part of it, has been redone.This isn't entirely tasteless either; a lot of the people bashing this thing probably haven't seen it.  This is more of a way to cope with death and accept it as an important stage in life (even the many ugly sides to it), and at the same time prove you have a strong stomach.  There will probably be a scene that will be offending to everyone but if you want to complain, why complain about a movie that you knew was offending before you popped it into your TV?  This is a valuable learning tool of sorts but at the same time, yes it is also for those who want to be disturbed or creeped out and it is those people who are able to cope with death.  If you want to be like reviewer eze543113 and complain that it is wrong to profit off peoples death's then why don't you go and protest the history channel for always showing Nazi footage and Japanese soldiers becoming victims to flam throwers or all death (even fake death) on TV in general?  I will admit, that the fact that some of this is real and that may have been a real person committing suicide by jumping out does make even me uneasy.  Also if you download scenes from it off the internet, chances are you're getting something that isn't even related to it, and someone just titled it as Faces of Death figuring a fan of these would then want to see them.  I've downloaded two and both of them I had scene previously on one of those ""When Animals Attack"" shows.I give this 3 stars in that it wasn't as satisfying to me as I thought it would have been, it was a little bit long, and yes even the real people dying makes me want to take off a star (sorry if I sound hypocritical), it is dated as this is clearly from the 70's, about 80 % of it is faked (although still entertaining as the narrator does a great job).  Let's face it; it is real people dying and it does aid in making one a little bit uncomfortable, even if that was its intended objective.  One thing I did like though is that the narrator always ended up with saying that murder is wrong and there is a moral to be learned.  I personally feel the most chilling scene is with the clubbing of the seals as you see their bodies covering the landscape.  Even though I do not support PETA in any way shape or form, this scene crawls under your skin no matter what.  It's obviously real and very chilling.  Fellow reviewer Justin Tobin is right, this film can be mentally helpful and educational too.  Well, I hoped this helped and cleared a few things up.",3,A Look at Death,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,3680,"['Lot', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'understand', 'concept', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'random', 'violence', 'connection', 'whatsoever', ""n't"", 'tasteless', 'one', 'would', 'immediately', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'narrator', 'looking', 'aspect', 'Death', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'horror', 'section', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'far', 'more', 'sense', 'series', 'films', 'be', 'labeled', 'documentaries', 'even', 'much', 'faked', 'have', 'strong', 'stomach', 'am', 'interested', 'psyche', 'mind', 'so', 'forth', 'why', 'enjoy', 'create', 'retaliate', 'mimic', 'love', 'hate', 'violence', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'installment', 'seemed', 'drag', 'along', 'certain', 'points', 'being', '105', 'minutes', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'bit', 'terms', 'what', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'are', 'film', 'student/critique', 'will', 'easily', 'notice', 'sections', 'are', 'fake', 'are', 'real', 'stock', 'footage', 'fake', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'reenactments', 'can', 'tell', 'electrocution', 'chair', 'scene', 'fake', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'camera', 'change', 'Camera', 'angles', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'often', 'documentaries', 'thus', 'dead', 'give', 'away', 'least', 'part', 'been', 'redone.This', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'tasteless', 'either', 'lot', 'people', 'bashing', 'thing', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'way', 'cope', 'death', 'accept', 'important', 'stage', 'life', 'even', 'many', 'ugly', 'sides', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'strong', 'stomach', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'offending', 'everyone', 'want', 'complain', 'why', 'complain', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'offending', 'popped', 'TV', 'valuable', 'learning', 'tool', 'sorts', 'same', 'time', 'yes', 'also', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'disturbed', 'creeped', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'cope', 'death', 'want', 'be', 'reviewer', 'eze543113', 'complain', 'wrong', 'profit', 'off', 'peoples', 'death', 'then', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'protest', 'history', 'channel', 'always', 'showing', 'Nazi', 'footage', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'becoming', 'victims', 'flam', 'throwers', 'death', 'even', 'fake', 'death', 'TV', 'general', 'will', 'admit', 'fact', 'real', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'person', 'committing', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'out', 'make', 'even', 'uneasy', 'Also', 'download', 'scenes', 'off', 'internet', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'getting', 'something', ""n't"", 'even', 'related', 'someone', 'just', 'titled', 'Faces', 'Death', 'figuring', 'fan', 'would', 'then', 'want', 'see', ""'ve"", 'downloaded', 'two', 'had', 'scene', 'previously', 'one', 'When', 'Animals', 'Attack', 'shows.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'satisfying', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'long', 'yes', 'even', 'real', 'people', 'dying', 'want', 'take', 'off', 'star', 'sorry', 'sound', 'hypocritical', 'dated', 'clearly', '70', 'about', '80', '%', 'faked', 'still', 'entertaining', 'narrator', 'great', 'job', 'Let', 'face', 'real', 'people', 'dying', 'aid', 'making', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'was', 'intended', 'objective', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'though', 'narrator', 'always', 'ended', 'up', 'saying', 'murder', 'wrong', 'moral', 'be', 'learned', 'personally', 'feel', 'most', 'chilling', 'scene', 'clubbing', 'seals', 'see', 'bodies', 'covering', 'landscape', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'PETA', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'scene', 'skin', 'matter', 'what', 'obviously', 'real', 'very', 'chilling', 'Fellow', 'reviewer', 'Justin', 'Tobin', 'right', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'mentally', 'helpful', 'educational', 'too', 'Well', 'hoped', 'helped', 'cleared', 'few', 'things', 'up']",N/A

78030,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0788601245,Jeffrey Leach,"[6, 8]","Look at that lurid DVD cover art! How could anyone take this movie--a movie that purported to show dozens of real life deaths caught on camera--seriously after looking at that cartoonish image? Nonetheless, millions of impressionable dupes bought into ""Faces of Death"" for all it was worth. I was one of them, of course, scurrying about town back in the late 1980s trying to track down a copy of this elusive film. I actually had to sign up for a membership at some dinky mom & pop videostore just to rent this sucker. That the store wasn't located within the city limits only heightened my anticipation. ""Surely,"" I thought to myself at the time as I drove home with the precious cargo sitting on the seat next to me, ""the fact that I had to leave the city means that this movie is real, that the prominently displayed ""Banned in 46 countries!"" sticker on the video box must really mean something! Wow! Am I gonna have fun or what?"" Uh huh. Needless to say, ""Faces of Death"" fell short in several areas. The cheesy narration from ""Dr. Francis Gross"" (Michael Carr) didn't seem to fit with a death flick, and a lot of the scenes looked staged for the camera.I recently decided to revisit this old ""classic"" when I noticed I could rent it online for a song. Funny how times change, isn't it? I had to storm the gates of heaven to find a copy less than twenty years ago, and now the same movie is everywhere. That's one good thing about the decline of Western Civilization, I guess--depravity is only a click away. Anyway, I tossed the DVD into the player when the disc arrived and set down for a couple of hours of pure schlock. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I'm surprised I remembered many of the film's ""shocking"" segments. It's important to remember that almost everything you see in the movie is staged. That electric chair execution? Phonier than a three dollar bill. Remember the infamous ""monkey brain"" scene? Fake! What about the poor sap trying to catch that crocodile out in the lake? Fake, although it might actually be stock footage of a real event if you use your imagination. Unfortunately, it isn't real. Almost nothing we see here is. If you watch ""Faces of Death"" with an open mind and open eyes, you'll likely notice that most of what's going on looks mighty suspicious.Of course, there is real death in ""Faces of Death"". The problem with this is that most of it consists of stock footage of non-human atrocities. Expect to see a lot of animal killings in this film. Sick sequences include scenes inside a slaughterhouse, animal attacks, and a disturbing look at seal hunting. These clips are doubtless real, and they do disturb on many levels, but we're not exactly renting/buying this movie for animals, are we? It's the human stuff we want to see. An assassination in France looks absolutely ridiculous in its execution (pun intended). A bear attack on some poor sap, complete with background voices saying things like, ""Be careful"" and shaky camera work, initially looks intriguing but ultimately proves obviously false on a second viewing. A lady doing a header out of a high-rise building, I thought, must surely be real. Maybe the police standoff with a disgruntled man, which results in a hail of gunfire, is also real. Or how about the protestor self-immolating outside of a nuclear power plant? Is it real or is it Memorex? I quickly wearied of trying to figure out what was real and what was a sham.The ultimate problem with ""Faces of Death"" is actually a simple one. In this day and age, with atrocity becoming the norm in the media and on the Internet, this movie comes off as almost prissy in its look at death. I'm serious. Considering the explosion of ""real death"" documentaries and DVDs that clog the market, along with an exponential increase in violence even on public television, ""Faces of Death"" just isn't that interesting when you can check out the real thing on the Internet or at the local videostore. I'm not even going to get into the media and their morbid fascination with all things dead and dying. The evening news often touches on events that overshadow most of what we see in ""Faces of Death"". If you want uncut, nauseating scenes of real death and destruction, pick up ""Traces of Death"" or one of the other documentaries that doesn't flinch when showing us real world carnage. Forget ""Faces of Death"". This film is only worth watching if you're taking a trip down memory lane, like I did, or if you want to scare the pants off of a stuffy friend. Go elsewhere to feed your cravings for blood and guts.The DVD version of ""Faces of Death"" is an intriguing one. Not because of improved picture quality (the movie looks worse here than on the old video tape I watched it on back in the 1980s) but because we get a very cheesy faux documentary called ""Faces of Death: Fact or Fiction?"" included as an extra on the disc. According to this documentary, the original narrator Dr. Francis Gross has passed away. Don't know what that means, but in his place we get some hammy actor calling himself Dr. Louis Flellis talking to a reporter about his fascination with death. We also see the director of the film, Conan Le Cilaire, talking about the trials and travails inherent in any quest to bring real death to a film audience. The fact that he hides his face behind a hat and sunglasses, and even disguises his voice with some sort of sound effect, only adds an extra layer of ridiculousness to the proceedings.

""Faces of Death"" received much word of mouth hype in the early 80's in the days way before the internet and before the prolifertaion of cable - media sources that could have easily quashed claims of the deaths on this film being genuine.The setting is creepy, the Dr.Gross narrator self-righteously intellectualizes his collection of purported death scenes with faux introspection and sensistivity. The scenes besides an autopsy and crime scene mop up here and there however seem and are largely faked, probably for the betterment of society.For those who insist ""Faces of Death"" is real, ask yourself why multi-camera shots are used and cutaways and edits occur during the crucial moments of death, the reason most are watching.

EVERYONE ELSE IS NOW DEAD FOLK.Faces Of Death (1978) 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition on  DVD/BLU-RAY:Anyone who has not heard of this Halloween staple needs to. When I was a kid, this is the forbidden movie I would swap between friends.. Maybe it was forbidden because no one had seen anything like this before or maybe it was because it really was forbidden to watch actual deaths executed in front of a live camera. Either way, a movie that once had my friends and I sneaking to watch it has now become an international Halloween cult classic.Who could forget the surgeons as they performed open heart surgery only to have the patient's heart rate flat line in front of your disbelieving eyes?Or the unrelenting footage of a slaughterhouse whose Kosher technique would saw a cow's throat with a huge blade as the blood gushed forth?Or the infamous and genuinely fake, ""monkey brain sequence"", showing you people killing a monkey at a restaurant in order to dine on its brains?Or how about the unbelievable live execution of a killer who gets fried in the electric chair?For over 25 years Faces of Death has remained the first true godfather of the now common Shockumentery genre. When I was a kid in the early 80's the last thing you wanted was to get caught watching or found to be in possession of this kind of movie, which at the time and for many, many years to come, would be blamed as responsible for teen suicides and grizzly cult murders for anyone brazen enough to commit to a fan following. Oh. but there was a fan following, a huge one in fact, and one that I was not openly admitting I was a part of for more than two decades.Proclaiming to be banned in over 40 Countries and purporting to be real, Faces Of Death was one of the most talked about and easily most misunderstood motion picture in history. Now for the first time ever Gorgon Video releases Faces Of Death 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition and lets us all in on one simple and amazing fact:That we as viewers had been had, by believing what we were seeing was actually real; it wasn't. 98 percent of all included footage either was re-created with special effects or was news footage that had been altered to paint a more grizzly visual for, as it turns out, a Japanese movie audience. That's right, Faces Of Death, was never intended for American audiences at all.Faces Of Death was created by a Conan Le Claire, a filmmaker who mainly did nature and animal documentaries, and where more than 80 percent of F.O.D's footage came from.This is all revealed for the first time on the special features, where the people involved in the creation of F.O.D, spill their guts (so to speak) and show you how we all were fooled and made to believe what we were seeing was absolutely real. Watching F.O.D now after 25 years; it is easy to spot most of the phony scenes but even scenes you could still swear are real.... well those are fake too. Quite amazing for a movie that's more than 30 yrs old. I can count on one hand all the scenes that were actually genuine and they all had to do with common, every day survival.Conan even points out that some of the footage, perfectly acceptable when included in his nature films, was absolutely taboo when shown under a different light and context, and wasn't at all acceptable here in America. America, where death to this day is taboo, a taboo almost entirely unique to this country. Why that is, is something I have been trying to figure out to this day. Especially in a place where watching killers and violence on TV or hearing about it in music, cartoons and video games is the standard for almost all entertainment groups/genres.True Reality Death Enthusiasts had dubbed this ""Faces of Fake"" and despised even including its name in the same breath as other films. Not me, not anymore, and not now after learning all the secrets and mysteries of Faces Of Death. I have become a fan all over again and can enjoy this now more than ever... Admitting we were wrong and laughing at ourselves and with the Faces Of Death filmmakers because they succeeded in fulfilling our worst nightmares and accomplished this feat entirely on a movie magic level that even I must admit was a pure genius Hollywood spectacular.This DVD is loaded with special features. Including rare insight on one of America's biggest hoaxes of the century since Big-Foot, Faces Of Deaths own Special Effects Artists and a long and eagerly awaited 'tell all' commentary from the movies director Conan Le Claire.I say ""long awaited"" because on prior releases Faces Of Death Box Set or an individual DVD release called Faces Of Death: Fact Or Fiction, only a few details are divulged; with a very disappointing  and a laughable approach as Conan is disguised from in back lit room and his voice is electronically...Talk about ultra cheesy!There were also a couple of quick references to my all time favorite Shockumentary series ever: {Traces Of Death}. No real bashing done here but again no mutual love shown between the two 'Godfathers of Gore' this was completely acceptable to me and no love lost between myself concerning it.Faces Of Death 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition has been fully restored and is available on DVD and BLU-RAY with very little difference in clarity between them...  Very crisp and clear unlike MOST copies of this Faces Of Death 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition is the first Shockumentary on BLU-RAY, my hopes are that TOD will follow suit.For now, however, let us gaze into the many Faces Of Fake Death.",5,The Faces Of Fake Death,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,5694,"['NOTE', 'IMPORTANT', 'AND', 'PREDOMINANT', 'CAST', 'AND', 'CREW', 'IN', 'FACES', 'OF',

Not only real but it did scare the hell out of me. I thought the electric chair scene was real. This movie as bad and fake as most of the scenes are, did make me look at death in a whole new way. As a teenager I was shocked and horrified by this movie. My friends and I would watch it and talk about it. Faces of death made me realize I should be greatful for everyday I have on this earth. This movie despite all the controversy of it being staged and being fake is really a facinating look into death. As gross as the morgue scene was to watch, it was interesting and I believe authentic. The chriogenic suspension scene was really facinating. The music by gene kauer is very effective, and goes with movie very well. Actor Michael Carr who portrays Dr. Francis B. Gross plays a believable doctor with an obsession with death. Faces of death was a mid 1980s fad, that people still talk about today.
