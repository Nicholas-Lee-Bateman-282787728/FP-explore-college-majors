Creatures from the Abyss is a straight to video flick from 94. Despite the budget and age of the films, for me they are all fun light fare, and you have to love the care that Shriek Show/ Media Blasters puts into their product, I've been really impressed with the effort this company puts forth with all the low budget trash they release, the prints and transfers are always exceptional, and there is often fun extras as well. So if you are into drive in movies from the late 70's you won't find any that look any better than these, though you can likely find better films, but all and all not a bad escape from a rainy day.",4,Trashy Retro Low Budget Monsters,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,793,"['None', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'mindless', 'monster', 'popcorn', 'fare', '2', 'films', 'Dark', 'Being', 'were', 'made', '79', 'latter', 'was', 'shelved', '83', 'Creatures', 'Abyss', 'straight', 'video', 'flick', '94', 'budget', 'age', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'light', 'fare', 'have', 'love', 'care', 'Shriek', 'Show/', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'product', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'impressed', 'effort', 'company', 'forth', 'low', 'budget', 'trash', 'release', 'prints', 'transfers', 'are', 'always', 'exceptional', 'often', 'fun', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'are', 'drive', 'movies', 'late', '70', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'look', 'better', 'can', 'likely', 'find', 'better', 'films', 'not', 'bad', 'escape', 'rainy', 'day']",Mutant Monsters: (The Dark / The Being / Creatures From the Abyss)
1069817,AHVG37KI3IM38,B000PC6Z2A,G-Fan,"[12, 12]","What a great boxed set of low-budget sci-fi/horror films, ranging from the late 70's to the mid 90's.  It was put out by Media Blasters/Shriek Show, and features decent to fine prints of all three movies, with a few extras thrown in to boot.The Dark (1979) was the film for which I primarily bought this three pack of DVDs.  I had great memories of seeing it on cable TV back in the early 80's, and don't believe I had seen it since.  By the admission of the director himself during the included interview and commentary, it started out as more of a slasher horror flick that somehow evolved into an evil alien visitor from another world horror flick.  And that evolution must have been pretty rocky, as it is glaringly obvious the two incongruous elements don't mesh particularly well.  But that in itself is partly what makes the film so appealing to us lovers of cinematic cheese.  By today's standards the action is sparse, the script is a bit all over the place, and the film does get bogged down at times with all the talking going on.  But when the evil alien attacks, watch out!  Great stuff, indeed.The Being (1983) is another film I had seen on videotape very long ago, and frankly did not remember much about it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually was.  I found it to be more than a little reminiscient of some of those creature features from the 1950's (which I love), only with considerably more blood.  Not done as a spoof, but as what seemed as sort of an homage to the genre, it was fast paced, well acted, and great fun.  In many ways, it was probably the ""best"" of the three movies contained herein.  It certainly appreared to have the best production values.  And to top it off, a buddy of mine from school (Hi Ron!) did the sound on it (though I don't know if he cares to remember it) before moving on to considerably bigger things.Creatures From the Abyss (1994) (aka Plankton) is by far the weirdest and wackiest of the three movies.  More than once I found myself wondering what the film makers must have been smoking when they came up with this crap.  I say crap, but the truth is, once I realized that it was going to be something totally different than the other two movies in this set (I watched this one last), and tossed all reason and logic out the window, I started having a ton of fun with it.  It has bad acting, terrible dubbing, atrocious special effects, and the storyline, such as it is, is totally ridiculous.  Toss in a healthy dose of T&A;, and you've got yourself the perfect B-movie!  Definitely check your brain at the door on this one and just try to run with it.  You might be pleasantly surprised.Three totally different movies - three great ways to have a fun night in on a Saturday night.  For the price, I would have to say this triple feature is a steal.  The great value here will even allow you to afford some popcorn.  Just don't choose cheese flavored popcorn, unless you're looking to OD on cheese.  Pick this up and watch - if you dare.",4,Great Triple Feature of Low-Budget Cheese,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,3009,"['What', 'great', 'boxed', 'set', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi/horror', 'films', 'ranging', 'late', '70', 'mid', '90', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'Media', 'Blasters/Shriek', 'Show', 'features', 'decent', 'fine', 'prints', 'three', 'movies', 'few', 'extras', 'thrown', 'boot.The', 'Dark', '1979', 'was', 'film', 'primarily', 'bought', 'three', 'pack', 'DVDs', 'had', 'great', 'memories', 'seeing', 'cable', 'TV', 'back', 'early', '80', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'seen', 'admission', 'director', 'included', 'interview', 'commentary', 'started', 'out', 'more', 'slasher', 'horror', 'flick', 'somehow', 'evolved', 'evil', 'alien', 'visitor', 'world', 'horror', 'flick', 'evolution', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'rocky', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'two', 'incongruous', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'particularly', 'well', 'partly', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'appealing', 'lovers', 'cinematic', 'cheese', 'today', 'standards', 'action', 'sparse', 'script', 'bit', 'place', 'film', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'times', 'talking', 'going', 'when', 'evil', 'alien', 'attacks', 'watch', 'out', 'Great', 'stuff', 'indeed.The', 'Being', '1983', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'videotape', 'very', 'long', 'ago', 'frankly', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'reminiscient', 'creature', '1950', 'love', 'only', 'considerably', 'more', 'blood', 'Not', 'done', 'spoof', 'what', 'seemed', 'sort', 'homage', 'genre', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'fun', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'movies', 'contained', 'herein', 'certainly', 'appreared', 'have', 'best', 'production', 'values', 'top', 'off', 'buddy', 'mine', 'school', 'Hi', 'Ron', 'did', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'remember', 'moving', 'considerably', 'bigger', 'things.Creatures', 'Abyss', '1994', 'Plankton', 'far', 'weirdest', 'wackiest', 'three', 'movies', 'More', 'once', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'film', 'makers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'smoking', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'crap', 'say', 'crap', 'truth', 'once', 'realized', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'set', 'watched', 'one', 'last', 'tossed', 'reason', 'logic', 'out', 'window', 'started', 'having', 'ton', 'fun', 'bad', 'acting', 'terrible', 'dubbing', 'atrocious', 'special', 'effects', 'storyline', 'such', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'Toss', 'healthy', 'dose', 'T', 'A', ""'ve"", 'got', 'perfect', 'B-movie', 'Definitely', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'one', 'just', 'try', 'run', 'might', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Three', 'totally', 'different', 'movies', 'three', 'great', 'ways', 'have', 'fun', 'night', 'Saturday', 'night', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'triple', 'feature', 'steal', 'great', 'value', 'here', 'will', 'even', 'allow', 'afford', 'popcorn', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'cheese', 'flavored', 'popcorn', ""'re"", 'looking', 'OD', 'cheese', 'Pick', 'up', 'watch', 'dare']",Mutant Monsters: (The Dark / The Being / Creatures From the Abyss)

1069820,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B000PC6Z2A,mrliteral,"[0, 1]","Shriek Show is a DVD company that packages old movies at reasonable prices.  The reason that the prices can be good is because these are not great films, but rather cheapie horror or crime flicks.  Recently, I watched all the movies in Shriek Show's Three-set, Mutant Monsters.The first in the set that I watched was the one I had the least hope for, Creatures from the Abyss.  While the other two movies boasted familiar star names, this foreign (obviously dubbed) movie offered a bunch of people with little name recognition.  It is the tale of five college age kids who stumble upon a deserted yacht that is also an oceanographic lab.  The kids fit generic film stereotypes:  there is the prankster, the smart guy (you know he's smart because he wears glasses), the good girl, the dumb-but-chesty blonde and the blonde's sister, who seems to just be along for the ride.There's a reason the boat is deserted; almost everyone on board has been killed by mutant fish that have been brought up from the very deep ocean and exposed to radiation.  What's worse, as the hapless kids find out, is that exposure to the fish can lead to some nasty mutations for humans too.  None of really makes much sense, but it is actually fun despite all its superficial deficiencies (bad effects, acting, writing, etc.).Second in the set is The Being, a real yawnfest imitation of Jaws and various late-'70s enviromental horror movies.  A local nuclear waste dump has somehow transformed a kid into a virtually indestructible man-eating creature.  Martin Landau plays a scientist who tries to downplay the effects of dumping nuclear waste into the local water supply; Jose Ferrer plays the mayor who wants to downplay any problems.  Ruth Buzzi plays the mayor's wife; I suppose it's hard to take any movie very seriously which has Ruth Buzzi.At the core of the film is the cop character played by Rexx Coltrane (or is his name Johnny Commander?  Both names appear in the credits). His real name is apparently Bill Osco, related to the Osco Drugs franchise.  It makes sense, because after you watch his performance, you feel drugged with boredom.  I have seen few actors more effectively suck life out of a film; it's not that he's a particularly bad actor, just a thudding bore to watch.  Not that the rest of the film is much better.Finally, there is The Dark, an all-star alien invader film with Cathy Lee Crosby, William Devane, Richard Jaeckel, Keenan Wynn and Casey Kasem (a pre-Miami Vice Philip Michael Thomas also has a small role).  The standard enough story focuses on an alien that comes out every night and kills one person, apparently feeding on it to get more powerful.  It is superstrong, bulletproof and shoots rays out of its eyes.Occasionally, the movie plays with the idea of public panic, akin to the panic felt about the Hillside Strangler, but this is never depicted very plausibly.  In fact, there isn't much plausibility in the behavior of many of the characters, nor why this movie with little gore, no nudity and little in the way of harsh language would merit an R-rating; by today's standards, it's a soft PG-13.With a few special features, the entire set is okay if you want to watch some mildly entertaining, yet forgettable fare.  I'd say skip The Being, but if you've bought the set, you might as well get your money's worth.",3,Bring on the mutants!,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,3339,"['Shriek', 'Show', 'DVD', 'company', 'old', 'movies', 'reasonable', 'prices', 'reason', 'prices', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'films', 'rather', 'cheapie', 'horror', 'crime', 'flicks', 'Recently', 'watched', 'movies', 'Shriek', 'Show', 'Three-set', 'Mutant', 'Monsters.The', 'first', 'set', 'watched', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'least', 'hope', 'Creatures', 'Abyss', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'boasted', 'familiar', 'star', 'names', 'foreign', 'obviously', 'dubbed', 'movie', 'offered', 'bunch', 'people', 'little', 'name', 'recognition', 'tale', 'five', 'college', 'age', 'kids', 'who', 'stumble', 'deserted', 'yacht', 'also', 'oceanographic', 'lab', 'kids', 'fit', 'generic', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'prankster', 'smart', 'guy', 'know', 'smart', 'glasses', 'good', 'girl', 'dumb-but-chesty', 'blonde', 'blonde', 'sister', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'along', 'ride.There', 'reason', 'boat', 'deserted', 'almost', 'everyone', 'board', 'been', 'killed', 'mutant', 'fish', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'very', 'deep', 'ocean', 'exposed', 'radiation', 'What', 'worse', 'hapless', 'kids', 'find', 'out', 'exposure', 'fish', 'can', 'lead', 'nasty', 'mutations', 'humans', 'too', 'None', 'really', 'much', 'sense', 'actually', 'fun', 'superficial', 'deficiencies', 'bad', 'effects', 'acting', 'writing', 'etc', '.Second', 'set', 'Being', 'real', 'yawnfest', 'imitation', 'Jaws', 'various', ""late-'70s"", 'enviromental', 'horror', 'movies', 'local', 'nuclear', 'waste', 'dump', 'somehow', 'transformed', 'kid', 'virtually', 'indestructible', 'man-eating', 'creature', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'scientist', 'who', 'downplay', 'effects', 'dumping', 'nuclear', 'waste', 'local', 'water', 'supply', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'mayor', 'who', 'downplay', 'problems', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi', 'mayor', 'wife', 'suppose', 'hard', 'take', 'movie', 'very', 'seriously', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi.At', 'core', 'film', 'cop', 'character', 'played', 'Rexx', 'Coltrane', 'name', 'Johnny', 'Commander', 'names', 'appear', 'credits', 'real', 'name', 'apparently', 'Bill', 'Osco', 'related', 'Osco', 'Drugs', 'franchise', 'sense', 'watch', 'performance', 'feel', 'drugged', 'boredom', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'actors', 'more', 'effectively', 'suck', 'life', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'bad', 'actor', 'just', 'thudding', 'bore', 'watch', 'Not', 'rest', 'film', 'much', 'better.Finally', 'Dark', 'all-star', 'alien', 'invader', 'film', 'Cathy', 'Lee', 'Crosby', 'William', 'Devane', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'pre-Miami', 'Vice', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'standard', 'enough', 'story', 'focuses', 'alien', 'out', 'night', 'one', 'person', 'apparently', 'feeding', 'get', 'more', 'powerful', 'superstrong', 'bulletproof', 'shoots', 'eyes.Occasionally', 'movie', 'idea', 'public', 'panic', 'akin', 'panic', 'felt', 'Hillside', 'Strangler', 'never', 'depicted', 'very', 'plausibly', 'fact', ""n't"", 'much', 'plausibility', 'behavior', 'many', 'characters', 'why', 'movie', 'little', 'gore', 'nudity', 'little', 'way', 'harsh', 'language', 'would', 'merit', 'R-rating', 'today', 'standards', 'soft', 'PG-13.With', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'entire', 'set', 'okay', 'want', 'watch', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'forgettable', 'fare', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip', 'Being', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'set', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'money', 'worth']",Mutant Monsters: (The Dark / The Being / Creatures From the Abyss)
