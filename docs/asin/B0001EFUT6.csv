It was not a big movie released at every theater in America, but it was released in small art houses. And, I have to respect it.The generally about if people really do fall in love or is it just pheromones that make people attracted to each other.  The movie goes around that idea showing different scenarios of love (and what is hormonally not a choice).The movie isn't a typical cute romance movie that everyone will swoon over.  It is kind of cute, not really romantic, but cute. They even go to the extent of using scientific knowledge as a way to attract each other. What is that?I really liked the 2 main male characters. The main man Rand is such a nice guy wanting to love and to be loved. The other character Winston, well, isn't the same as Rand, but he has the best one liners throughout the movie.This movie is educational (learning something about people and how they work), but doesn't need a brainy person to understand.

Karasik,"[0, 0]","The central theme of this film is endlessly fascinating: do we have genuine feelings in the classical/romantic sense, or are our emotions simply the sum of neurochemical processes?  A sub-theme, the nature of artificial intelligence and how much it has in common with the human psyche, has been far more developed in films such as &quot;A.I.&quot; and &quot;Bladerunner,&quot; but was nevertheless poignant in the character of Koy-Koy.  There was some intelligent scripting here, though the material on brain chemistry failed to go much beyond what one could glean from one good newspaper article.  I felt it was a missed opportunity to really explore the topic in depth.  The the actor playing Rand stands out as a real natural.  Nice tasteful soundtrack.

I found the basis for the story to be very interesting, and I was not disappointed after viewing the film.  The characters were so real.  They felt like people I've met.  Little details about each character made them so fascinating.  Like Sarah's tattoos - I couldn't help but wonder at their meaning.  The actors did an amazing job.  The film was put together beautifully.  It was artistic and I enjoyed every minute of it.  There were parts of it that were funny, but also very serious elements that really left you thinking.

802353,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0001EFUT6,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 3]","Dopamine is an unusually thoughtful romantic drama that asks whether romantic love is a purely chemical phenomenon. With such an intellectual theme, the movie could easily have been artificial and nothing but a series of cerebral discussions, but director Mark Decena does a good job in making it all very natural and compelling. Strong performances also help to flesh this out into something more than a thesis. Rand (John Livingston) is a computer programmer who has created an animated character named Koy-Koy; right from the beginning, it's obvious that he is a bit too attached to his creation. If human emotions are nothing beyond chemical reactions, then a computer-generated creature could conceivably be considered human, or at least alive. When Rand meets Sarah (Sabrina Lloyd), the teacher in whose classroom Koy-Koy is going to be placed, the two enter upon a series of discussions and debates over the nature of romantic love, as well as embark upon a tentative romance of their own. Sarah is skeptical of Rand's coldly scientific view of love, but is herself very ambivalent about getting emotionally involved. Rand gradually reveals that his point of view is a way to protect himself  from painful family experiences. Both exhibit a wide enough range of emotional responses to help counter the artifice of the basic theme (i.e. in real life, everything seldom revolves around one particular philosophical question). The camera work and understated shots of the San Francisco locations also breathe soul into the film .",4,Is chemistry everything?,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,1533,"['Dopamine', 'unusually', 'thoughtful', 'romantic', 'drama', 'romantic', 'love', 'purely', 'chemical', 'phenomenon', 'such', 'intellectual', 'theme', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'artificial', 'nothing', 'series', 'cerebral', 'discussions', 'director', 'Mark', 'Decena', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'very', 'natural', 'compelling', 'Strong', 'performances', 'also', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'something', 'more', 'thesis', 'Rand', 'John', 'Livingston', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'created', 'animated', 'character', 'named', 'Koy-Koy', 'right', 'beginning', 'obvious', 'bit', 'too', 'attached', 'creation', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'nothing', 'chemical', 'reactions', 'then', 'computer-generated', 'creature', 'could', 'conceivably', 'be', 'considered', 'human', 'least', 'alive', 'When', 'Rand', 'Sarah', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'teacher', 'classroom', 'Koy-Koy', 'going', 'be', 'placed', 'two', 'enter', 'series', 'discussions', 'debates', 'nature', 'romantic', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'embark', 'tentative', 'romance', 'own', 'Sarah', 'skeptical', 'Rand', 'coldly', 'scientific', 'view', 'love', 'very', 'ambivalent', 'getting', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Rand', 'gradually', 'point', 'view', 'way', 'protect', 'painful', 'family', 'experiences', 'exhibit', 'wide', 'enough', 'range', 'emotional', 'responses', 'help', 'counter', 'artifice', 'basic', 'theme', 'i.e', 'real', 'life', 'everything', 'seldom', 'one', 'particular', 'philosophical', 'question', 'camera', 'work', 'understated', 'shots', 'San', 'Francisco', 'locations', 'also', 'breathe', 'soul', 'film']",Dopamine

Some  Indie films have an aspect to them which is a turn off, usually an attempt to be daring or controversial and sometimes for no real good reason but this film excels.  It only touches on issues which could lean toward being off putting or tawdry,  but this film stays the course, avoids being cheap or trashy which it easily could have done, but instead makes its point and comes to resolution.  Bravo to the writers and director.  This movie is really a great film.  And the special features were interesting as well.  Now, what I wonder about Amazon is.  Why does Amazon so often list a different running time for different issue dates for the same movie without any explanation of what is the cause for that difference?  This film with issue date of 2004 runs 85 minutes.  The 2005 issue date shows it runs 79 minutes.  Is there really 6 minutes of missing footage?  Or is this just inaccuracy on the part of the studio.

But, I was somewhat disappointed.  It was not a bad movie, but not as good as I had hoped.  It just seems to keep approaching greatness and meaning, but never quite getting there, leaving much too soon or not confronting those issues head-on.  Be that as it may, I still liked it, but then I would probably watch anything with Sabrina Lloyd.  She rates very high in the cuteness category.  I guess my crush on her affected my opinion of the main character, played lethargically by John Livington.  How could he not love her?  Who cares about the actual scientific chemistry of love?  What kind of warped mind examines love in that context?  Or on the other hand, what does she see in him?  All questions that are hard to answer.

Is it spiritual or hormonal, metaphysical or chemical?Here's the deal: There are these 3 guys who have spent what, like 3 years? working to create an interactive computer pet, a bird named Koi-Koi (at least, that's how I'd spell it), who will respond appropriately to voiced emotion-laden conversation. They take it into a classroom of pre-schoolers to test it out, and Rand, one of the computer guys, falls in love (but there again, What is love?) with the teacher.
