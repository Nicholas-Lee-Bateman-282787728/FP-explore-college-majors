187923,A34PAZQ73SL163,1572527005,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[3, 13]","Noah Baumbach hit paydirt back in 1995 with Kicking and Screaming, but in Mr. Jealousy, which he also directed and wrote, he does not offer his audience anywhere near the same complexity of character or plot.  He also makes some glaring errors in regards to human nature. Eric Stoltz plays Lester who is supposed to be a man plagued by obsession and jealousy.  However, Stoltz as always, is cool and engaging which means that he was a poor choice for the role.  His demeanor is not in keeping with someone who is a jealous neurotic as he presents as being relaxed and anxiety free.Regardless of personality impressions, we witness early on that Lester has partaken in some strange adventures over the course of his life's romantic relationships.  Eventually, he enacts a most bizarre stunt involving an ex-boyfriend and group therapy during the film's climax.  The audience is supposed to laugh at Lester because our society views jealousy as being a pathological trait, yet this is just another example of the way that human nature is misunderstood.Yes, the O.J. Simpson brand of jealousy is pathological and anti-social; however, sexual jealousy in itself is quite adaptive and useful in the lives men.  Were we not sexually jealous, our days would be spent raising other men's children and laboring to support women who shame and cuckold us.  Furthermore, I would argue that a man who experiences no jealousy in regards to his mate/wife/girlfriend/whatever, is a man who is not in love.Baumach completely mishandles his main character.  In the opening sequence, he reveals that Lester was scarred by infidelity in his youth, yet his reaction to his girlfriend cheating on him is most civilized by any standard. Nearly all men would find such an event as traumatic as Lester did. Indeed, his present choice in girlfriends, Ramona, is a scandalous tramp, and his jealous feelings in regards to her would be universally shared. When one meets such a woman, the best thing to do is to break up with them because they will be an unending source of misery for whoever is dumb enough to become vested in their welfare.  Not only is Ramona not ""marriage material"", she's not even ""girlfriend material.""  She's a walking case of syphilis.  Most calamitous for the film's message, is that Lester is correct to be so worried about her because she proves his worst fears true. If anything, the lesson we learn is that Lester is not jealous enough. Paradoxically, once the unthinkable happens, his reaction is not that of an obsessive and haunted man at all.  He responds like a kind and friendly metrosexual.  Instead of screaming at her, he is respectful and apologetic.  That he would even speak to her in the closing scene at all is nothing short of astounding.  Lester is everything that our post-feminist society prays for in its fabricated housecat men.  His is a life to be abhorred.  The movie ends up delivering a flawed contradictory message regarding the behaviors of men.",2,Human Nature Misunderstood.,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2974,"['Noah', 'Baumbach', 'hit', 'paydirt', 'back', '1995', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'Mr.', 'Jealousy', 'also', 'directed', 'wrote', 'not', 'offer', 'audience', 'anywhere', 'same', 'complexity', 'character', 'plot', 'also', 'glaring', 'errors', 'regards', 'human', 'nature', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'plays', 'Lester', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'man', 'plagued', 'obsession', 'jealousy', 'However', 'Stoltz', 'always', 'cool', 'engaging', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'role', 'demeanor', 'not', 'keeping', 'someone', 'who', 'jealous', 'neurotic', 'being', 'relaxed', 'anxiety', 'free.Regardless', 'personality', 'impressions', 'witness', 'early', 'Lester', 'partaken', 'strange', 'adventures', 'course', 'life', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Eventually', 'most', 'bizarre', 'stunt', 'involving', 'ex-boyfriend', 'group', 'therapy', 'film', 'climax', 'audience', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'Lester', 'society', 'views', 'jealousy', 'being', 'pathological', 'trait', 'yet', 'just', 'example', 'way', 'human', 'nature', 'misunderstood.Yes', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'brand', 'jealousy', 'pathological', 'anti-social', 'however', 'sexual', 'jealousy', 'quite', 'adaptive', 'useful', 'lives', 'men', 'Were', 'not', 'sexually', 'jealous', 'days', 'would', 'be', 'spent', 'raising', 'other', 'men', 'children', 'laboring', 'support', 'women', 'who', 'shame', 'cuckold', 'Furthermore', 'would', 'argue', 'man', 'who', 'jealousy', 'regards', 'mate/wife/girlfriend/whatever', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'love.Baumach', 'completely', 'main', 'character', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Lester', 'was', 'scarred', 'infidelity', 'youth', 'yet', 'reaction', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'most', 'civilized', 'standard', 'Nearly', 'men', 'would', 'find', 'such', 'event', 'as', 'traumatic', 'Lester', 'did', 'Indeed', 'present', 'choice', 'girlfriends', 'Ramona', 'scandalous', 'tramp', 'jealous', 'feelings', 'regards', 'would', 'be', 'universally', 'shared', 'When', 'one', 'meets', 'such', 'woman', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'break', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'unending', 'source', 'misery', 'whoever', 'dumb', 'enough', 'become', 'vested', 'welfare', 'Not', 'only', 'Ramona', 'not', 'marriage', 'material', 'not', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'material', 'walking', 'case', 'syphilis', 'Most', 'calamitous', 'film', 'message', 'Lester', 'correct', 'be', 'so', 'worried', 'worst', 'fears', 'true', 'anything', 'lesson', 'learn', 'Lester', 'not', 'jealous', 'enough', 'Paradoxically', 'once', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'reaction', 'not', 'obsessive', 'haunted', 'man', 'kind', 'friendly', 'metrosexual', 'Instead', 'screaming', 'respectful', 'apologetic', 'would', 'even', 'speak', 'closing', 'scene', 'nothing', 'short', 'astounding', 'Lester', 'everything', 'post-feminist', 'society', 'prays', 'fabricated', 'housecat', 'men', 'life', 'be', 'abhorred', 'movie', 'up', 'delivering', 'flawed', 'contradictory', 'message', 'regarding', 'behaviors', 'men']",N/A
187924,A1MWAQCQ1G3CL3,1572527005,Dorion Sagan,"[3, 16]","Mirabella calls it ""a comic revelation."" I had a different reaction. I fell asleep. This in of itself cannot be considered a pan, as I have fallen asleep during a lot of movies that were highly acclaimed, such as the first Star Wars, which I saw with my dad and bored me to tears-or would have if I could have focused on the screen for more than the first twenty minutes. (He was there with his spanking new family.) This movie, which the New York Times of Jason Blair fame, calls ""a shrewd comedy"" I found to be wanting. The back of the DVD calls it ""the most possessive romantic comedy ever."" However, Lester, played by Eric Stoltz, is only vaguely jealous, which is appropriate considering the hair styles and vapid conversation of his new love interest, Ramona (Anabella Sciorra). Sciorra, who is not bad to look at, has a richly boring erotic past of flings with some twenty-odd twenty-somethings, each one (from what the sleeping reviewer can gather) a more inane yuppie than the last. And none of her inane yuppie love interests is more aggravating than Dashiell Frank (Chris Eigeman), the New York generation X writer who receives huge contracts for his best-selling short stories of intercourse in unusual positions with his x-girlfriends, of whom Ramona is, to Lester's consternation. Well, without giving the plot away (difficult considering my sleep and its absence), let's just say that the inanely unjealous Lester (who turns down a scholarship to the Iowa writing program because ""he isn't interested in school""-MTV beckons, no doubt) spots the enviable and dashingly intellectual Frank and, following him, joins his group therapy group under an alias. Why? You'd have to ask the writers (?) but my guess is that, as so often in modern ""cinema,"" these same writers were neuronally overstimulated from MSG from all the Chinese take out that they ate during the day (or two) when the screenplay, for which they were certainly overpaid, was composed. And group therapy (arguably the exact opposite of the solitary task of writing-but not of the Hollywood group marketing that passes for writing!) must have just commended itself to them as a brilliant technical device to tell their story. Edith Wharton in the introduction to Ethan Frome tells of the necessity of having the stories of simpler people told by more intelligent or complex ones. I think something similar occurs in movies like this: the would-be complex and intelligent writers (usually paid for by oil executives that own the film conglomerates) choose (or are forced to choose) as their subject matter relatively simple and less bright ""ordinary people."" It is this leveling process that may be in part responsible for what Kurt Vonnegut calls the American tendency of ""aspiring to mediocrity."" In short, a must-have for the serious possessive romantic comedy collector.",3,A Rare Mediocrity,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,2849,"['Mirabella', 'comic', 'revelation', 'had', 'different', 'reaction', 'fell', 'asleep', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'pan', 'have', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'lot', 'movies', 'were', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'such', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'saw', 'dad', 'bored', 'tears-or', 'would', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'screen', 'more', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'there', 'spanking', 'new', 'family', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Jason', 'Blair', 'fame', 'shrewd', 'comedy', 'found', 'be', 'wanting', 'back', 'DVD', 'most', 'possessive', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ever', 'However', 'Lester', 'played', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'only', 'vaguely', 'jealous', 'appropriate', 'considering', 'hair', 'styles', 'vapid', 'conversation', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Ramona', 'Anabella', 'Sciorra', 'Sciorra', 'who', 'not', 'bad', 'look', 'richly', 'boring', 'erotic', 'past', 'flings', 'twenty-odd', 'twenty-somethings', 'one', 'what', 'sleeping', 'reviewer', 'can', 'gather', 'more', 'inane', 'yuppie', 'last', 'none', 'inane', 'yuppie', 'love', 'interests', 'more', 'aggravating', 'Dashiell', 'Frank', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'New', 'York', 'generation', 'X', 'writer', 'who', 'huge', 'contracts', 'best-selling', 'short', 'stories', 'intercourse', 'unusual', 'positions', 'x-girlfriends', 'whom', 'Ramona', 'Lester', 'consternation', 'Well', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'difficult', 'considering', 'sleep', 'absence', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'inanely', 'unjealous', 'Lester', 'who', 'down', 'scholarship', 'Iowa', 'writing', 'program', ""n't"", 'interested', 'school', '-MTV', 'beckons', 'doubt', 'enviable', 'dashingly', 'intellectual', 'Frank', 'following', 'group', 'therapy', 'group', 'alias', 'Why', ""'d"", 'have', 'ask', 'writers', 'guess', 'that', 'so', 'often', 'modern', 'cinema', 'same', 'writers', 'were', 'neuronally', 'overstimulated', 'MSG', 'Chinese', 'take', 'out', 'ate', 'day', 'two', 'when', 'screenplay', 'were', 'certainly', 'overpaid', 'was', 'composed', 'group', 'therapy', 'arguably', 'exact', 'opposite', 'solitary', 'task', 'writing-but', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'group', 'marketing', 'writing', 'must', 'have', 'just', 'commended', 'brilliant', 'technical', 'device', 'tell', 'story', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'introduction', 'Ethan', 'Frome', 'tells', 'necessity', 'having', 'stories', 'simpler', 'people', 'told', 'more', 'intelligent', 'complex', 'ones', 'think', 'something', 'similar', 'occurs', 'movies', 'would-be', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'writers', 'usually', 'paid', 'oil', 'executives', 'own', 'film', 'conglomerates', 'choose', 'are', 'forced', 'choose', 'subject', 'matter', 'relatively', 'simple', 'less', 'bright', 'ordinary', 'people', 'leveling', 'process', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'responsible', 'what', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'American', 'tendency', 'aspiring', 'mediocrity', 'short', 'must-have', 'serious', 'possessive', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'collector']",N/A

187926,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,1572527005,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 1]","Filmmaker Noah Baumbach nails the thing with jealousy and obsession dead on in this really sharp comedy. What makes this so much fun is the obviously high level of intelligence on display throughout the entire film. The movie hit home pretty hard; I recently met a beautiful woman I totally wigged out over and thanks to my obsessive behavior, she dropped me--not like a hot potato, but instead a volcanic one. (I hung my head for a couple of weeks after that).Sigh. Lester, the obsessive guy in this film--played by Eric Stoltz--is so caught up in his own need to know he calls his girlfriend three times on one of the nights she says she wants to be alone, then jogs over to her house sometime after midnight. (Nothing like a wild imagination to get the better of you...sigh again). His girlfriend Ramona (Annabella Sciorra, in a perfect piece of casting) is beautiful but also pretty blithe about things and in fact, on the night in question, Lester may have had reason to think something was up...Complicating matters is one of Ramona's ex-boyfriends, Dashiell (another well-cast role--Chris Eigemann, who does pompous and arrogant 30 something year old better than anyone in the known universe). Dash is a writer (surprise!) and has already published a book of short stories--and writer is a 'thing' Lester aspires to, although now he's a substitute teacher, and not a very good one at that.Dash and Lester clash in a group therapy session, and how Lester got to the session is all part of Lester's obsession. The therapist, played by director Peter Bogdanovich in a surprise piece of casting, interestingly reflects Ramona's blitheness but of course applied to the field of psychotherapy rather than personal relationships. Lester's friend Vince and Vince's fiancee Lucretia also are on hand as a kind of snappy Greek chorus to both Lester and Ramona.The main thing is that Baumbach really knows how to write very smart witty dialogue. He's a master at this, and that's what makes Mr. Jealousy a lot of fun to watch. It would be hard to find another 90s American comedy as sharp as this one--except, of course, Baumbach's OTHER 90s comedy, Kicking and Screaming. Interestingly enough, Eigemann (the Dashiell character) is a stock actor in Whit Stillman's films (Metropolitan, Barcelona) and there is some similarity between Stillman and Baumbach. But for my money, Baumbach is the man to beat.Highly recommended--especially if you like sharp pungent comedy (with some real roaance as well).",4,"Sharp, witty, right on target",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2496,"['Filmmaker', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'thing', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'dead', 'really', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'What', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'obviously', 'high', 'level', 'intelligence', 'display', 'entire', 'film', 'movie', 'hit', 'home', 'pretty', 'hard', 'recently', 'met', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'totally', 'wigged', 'out', 'thanks', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'dropped', 'not', 'hot', 'potato', 'instead', 'volcanic', 'one', 'hung', 'head', 'couple', 'weeks', '.Sigh', 'Lester', 'obsessive', 'guy', 'film', 'played', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'need', 'know', 'girlfriend', 'three', 'times', 'one', 'nights', 'be', 'alone', 'then', 'house', 'sometime', 'midnight', 'Nothing', 'wild', 'imagination', 'get', 'better', 'sigh', 'again', 'girlfriend', 'Ramona', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'perfect', 'piece', 'casting', 'beautiful', 'also', 'pretty', 'blithe', 'things', 'fact', 'night', 'question', 'Lester', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'reason', 'think', 'something', 'was', 'up', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'one', 'Ramona', 'ex-boyfriends', 'Dashiell', 'well-cast', 'role', 'Chris', 'Eigemann', 'who', 'pompous', 'arrogant', '30', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'better', 'anyone', 'known', 'universe', 'Dash', 'writer', 'surprise', 'already', 'published', 'book', 'short', 'stories', 'writer', ""'thing"", 'Lester', 'aspires', 'now', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'that.Dash', 'Lester', 'clash', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'how', 'Lester', 'got', 'session', 'part', 'Lester', 'obsession', 'therapist', 'played', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'surprise', 'piece', 'casting', 'interestingly', 'Ramona', 'blitheness', 'course', 'applied', 'field', 'psychotherapy', 'rather', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Lester', 'friend', 'Vince', 'Vince', 'fiancee', 'Lucretia', 'also', 'are', 'hand', 'kind', 'snappy', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'Lester', 'Ramona.The', 'main', 'thing', 'Baumbach', 'really', 'how', 'write', 'very', 'smart', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'master', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Jealousy', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'find', '90s', 'American', 'comedy', 'as', 'sharp', 'one', 'course', 'Baumbach', 'OTHER', '90s', 'comedy', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Eigemann', 'Dashiell', 'character', 'stock', 'actor', 'Whit', 'Stillman', 'films', 'Metropolitan', 'Barcelona', 'similarity', 'Stillman', 'Baumbach', 'money', 'Baumbach', 'man', 'beat.Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'like', 'sharp', 'pungent', 'comedy', 'real', 'roaance', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Aside from Stoltz, there are some other holdovers from Kicking & Screaming including Chris Eigeman (who inexplicably seems to have only appeared in the films of Baumbach and Whit Stilman) and Carlos Jacott. It is one of those sophisticated, witty, urbane comedies (ala Woody Allen) where everyone seems so intelligent and with it, doing interesting things in New York. Stoltz is an aspiring writer who meets Sciorra, an Art History doctoral candidate and as his character has shown in the past has become obsessed with her past. In that sense it shares the same basic premise of Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy, where the past life of one's lover becomes an obsession. In this case drives Stoltz to stalk and follow her ex-boyfriend, and successful writer, Dashiell Frank into therapy. I found the fact that they were so open about past lovers at the beginning of the relationship as a bit too shall we say-""European""? However, the comedic highpoint is where Stoltz chastises Sciorra for going to bed with him too early in their relationship, to which she asks if he's jealous of himself.

187928,A1WBXDI7LRPLXB,1572527005,R. Sohi,"[0, 0]","""Mr. Jealousy"" is a romantic-comedy made by writer/director Noah Baumbach between two significantly more successful films - ""Kicking and Screaming"" and ""The Squid and the Whale.""  If it represents a misstep or a continuation of a sophomore jinx (started with the other film he made between K & S and S & W, something called ""Highball""), it still has lots to recommend it.Set in Manhattan, the film explores the lives of several characters as they navigate the hurdles of romantic relationships while struggling to reach greater emotional maturity.  The eponymous character, played by Eric Stoltz (also the film's producer) is the story's focus as he gives free reign to his jealousy, reacting to a history of perceived and actual betrayals, and along the way goes to amusingly great lengths to unearth the secrets of his new lover's heart.  His behaviour is unsurprising within the context of the film but a bit of a deviation from the usual terrain of the romantic-comedy genre.Compared to the more successful films made by Baumbach, which I mentioned in the opening paragraph, ""Mr. Jealousy"" is neither as loose nor as satisfying because it seems more locked in by the conventions of its genre.  The ending in particular is weak as the story gets resolved in an entirely predictable manner. The film also suffers from performances which are merely competent rather than inspired (as Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are, for example, in ""The Squid and the Whale""). Despite these criticisms, it's a film that is worth seeing because of the wit and accuracy with which it looks at the destructive effects of jealousy. You probably won't laugh out loud watching it but might smile in recognition.
