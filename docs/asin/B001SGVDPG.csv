Can't help wondering what the difference is between this set and the other shown as Season 8 and Final Series which looks like it's a little bit more money and it looks like it's available now. This was one great show and I recommend it highly.,5,Can't wait for this - love this show,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,333,"['Watched', 'show', 'beginning', 'have', '7', 'seasons', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'one', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'difference', 'set', 'other', 'shown', 'Season', '8', 'Final', 'Series', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'available', 'now', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'show', 'recommend', 'highly']",McLeod's Daughters: Season 8

1235239,AHD4TRX1LXN1,B001SGVDPG,Janis K.,"[3, 3]",I enjoyed this series- very addicting.  I was happy to see that their was an eighth season - bringing the story to an end.  My only problem - the actresses were getting progressively annoying!  By the end - I was happy to see them go.  There was nothing like the original cast - before they started killing everyone off and moving them to foreign countries.  All in all - a fun series - I did enjoy it very much - especially the constant fly swatting notorious for Australia!,4,Good Series,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,475,"['enjoyed', 'series-', 'very', 'addicting', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'was', 'eighth', 'season', 'bringing', 'story', 'end', 'only', 'problem', 'actresses', 'were', 'getting', 'progressively', 'annoying', 'end', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'go', 'was', 'nothing', 'original', 'cast', 'started', 'killing', 'everyone', 'moving', 'foreign', 'countries', 'fun', 'series', 'did', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'especially', 'constant', 'fly', 'swatting', 'notorious', 'Australia']",McLeod's Daughters: Season 8

While my wife and I loved the show (we have them all, the first 6 seasons/series in Region 4) why would people keep going with nothing but unhappiness and disappointment ALL OF THE TIME? Guess that's the disadvantage of seeing a season in a marathon viewing instead of over the course of an entire TV season. We think the Australian's have it right when they can bring in new characters and still keep a show ""alive"", but when you can recognize some story lines from earlier years, time to hang it up!
