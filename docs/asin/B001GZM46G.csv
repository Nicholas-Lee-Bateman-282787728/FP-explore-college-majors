1198921,AER15RIMV8E6D,B001GZM46G,Pumpkin Man,"[4, 7]","As a kid, I grew up with the first two Beethoven movies! In my opinion, they are the only worthwhile films in the 'series' I was confused as to what this is supposed to be. Is is the 6th film and a writer happens to guess everything that happened in the original classic, or is it a prequel that shows how the first was made. It does have some cute and funny moments, and I liked Cesar Millan's cameo. Eddie is an animal trainer, but he doesn't want anything to do with dogs. His son, Billy runs into Beethoven and he wants to keep him. Soon, Beethoven gets a part in a movie based on his life from the original. I'd probably recommend BEETHOVEN'S BIG BREAK!!!",3,They're Still Messin' With My Childhood!!!,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,660,"['kid', 'grew', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'Beethoven', 'movies', 'opinion', 'are', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'films', ""'series"", 'was', 'confused', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'Is', '6th', 'film', 'writer', 'guess', 'everything', 'happened', 'original', 'classic', 'prequel', 'how', 'first', 'was', 'made', 'have', 'cute', 'funny', 'moments', 'liked', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'cameo', 'Eddie', 'animal', 'trainer', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'dogs', 'son', 'Billy', 'Beethoven', 'keep', 'Soon', 'Beethoven', 'part', 'movie', 'based', 'life', 'original', ""'d"", 'probably', 'recommend', 'BEETHOVEN', 'BIG', 'BREAK']",Beethoven's Big Break
