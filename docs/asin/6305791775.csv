478237,A2DMUTSM88AL7N,6305791775,"Joseph Johnson ""Echo5Joker""","[8, 8]","This movie will be thoroughly enjoyable if it is not taken seriously.  One gets the feeling watching it that sometimes the actors are making up their own dialogue, but it is entertaining.  The dance sequences are very good, and there is a Adrian Pang and Medaline Tan and Annabelle Francis all have believable relationships with each other, be it attraction, or commpetition.  The actors all fit the parts, and it doesn't feel like it was tailored to any actor's whims.  As it was produced by Singaporeans, if that is a word, it doesn't present stereotypes.  There are places where the props break the period, such as some of the 90's packages in the supermarket, but that is unavoidable in a place like Singapore where everything is torn down every few years...there are no '70s places left.This movie is definitely worth a look.",5,One of my favorites,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,830,"['movie', 'will', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'One', 'feeling', 'watching', 'actors', 'are', 'making', 'up', 'own', 'dialogue', 'entertaining', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Adrian', 'Pang', 'Medaline', 'Tan', 'Annabelle', 'Francis', 'have', 'believable', 'relationships', 'other', 'be', 'attraction', 'commpetition', 'actors', 'fit', 'parts', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'tailored', 'actor', 'whims', 'was', 'produced', 'Singaporeans', 'word', ""n't"", 'present', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'props', 'break', 'period', 'such', '90', 'packages', 'supermarket', 'unavoidable', 'place', 'Singapore', 'where', 'everything', 'torn', 'down', 'few', 'years', 'are', ""'70s"", 'places', 'left.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look']",That's The Way I Like It VHS

Yet one glimpse into disco's glitzy nightlife and he ditches his Bruce Lee obsession for a pair of bell-bottoms and permed hair. It's &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; all over again, from the butterfly collars to the sweaty dance-offs, but put a little Asian spin on, add a touch of spoof, sprinkle it with some dry humor and top it off with an advice-giving John Travolta look alike... well, could it get more fun than that?Frankly, it wasn't as campy as it might sound. They didn't take it over the top, but kept it within the genre of &quot;very good film,&quot; instead of making it slapstick. They dealt with some serious issues in relationships that seemed more real than devised for cinema. The acting wasn't always perfect, but the athleticism of the dancing was incredible, and the storyline was entertaining and actually refreshingly unique.If you're a fan of the independent comedy, this is a great one.",5,&quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; Done Asian Style...,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,1002,"['When', 'Hock', 'friends', 'drag', 'see', 'funky', 'dance', 'movie', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'one', 'glimpse', 'disco', 'glitzy', 'nightlife', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'obsession', 'pair', 'bell-bottoms', 'permed', 'hair', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'quot', 'again', 'butterfly', 'sweaty', 'dance-offs', 'put', 'little', 'Asian', 'spin', 'add', 'touch', 'spoof', 'sprinkle', 'dry', 'humor', 'top', 'off', 'advice-giving', 'John', 'Travolta', 'look', 'alike', 'well', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'fun', 'Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'campy', 'might', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'top', 'kept', 'genre', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'quot', 'instead', 'making', 'slapstick', 'dealt', 'serious', 'issues', 'relationships', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'devised', 'cinema', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'athleticism', 'dancing', 'was', 'incredible', 'storyline', 'was', 'entertaining', 'actually', 'refreshingly', 'unique.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'independent', 'comedy', 'great', 'one']",That's The Way I Like It VHS

One night Hock goes to the movies with his friends and see Saturday Night Fever and is exposed to the magic of disco.  Hock's dream is to buy a motorcycle, so when he finds an ad for a dance competition, he decides to enter a dance school with his friend Mei.  However, he doesn't have any skill in dancing, so he goes to see the movie again to pick up some pointers.  Hock is shocked when Travolta's character walks out of the screen to give him some advice.  With this gaurdian angel's guidance, Hock works hard to become the greatest dancer in Singapore.  In the meantime, Mei is falling in love with Hock, but Hock is falling for another girl at the dance school.  Also there is a sub-plot in which Hock's brother announces his intention to get a sex change, which causes a lot of family problems.  Can Hock win the competition?
