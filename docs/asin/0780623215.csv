32907,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,0780623215,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[1, 2]","First time writer-director Jake Kasdan really scored big with this  ingeniously delightful and original mystery-comedy. But the talent seems to  run in the family, he is the son of Lawrence Kasdan. Kasdan senior made  'Body Heat', 'The Accidental Tourist' and 'The Big Chill' all great films.  It's basically a very intelligent script filled with sharp dialogue and a  twisting plot brought to life by an extremely likable cast. Bill Pullman  was an odd choice but he makes a compelling Darryl Zero. Pullman has made  some good films in his limited career, namely a small part in 'The Last  Seduction' which is his best performance yet, but is an actor of limited  range. As likable as he may be, one can't help but imagine a more versatile  actor in that crucial role. Ben Stiller on the other hand is perfectly cast  as Steve Arlo, Zero's sidekick and representative. The plot itself has more  twists than a pretzel but it's surprisingly not hard to follow and it's  very involving which heightens the suspense. Ryan O'Neal who will always be  remembered for his role in 'Love Story' makes for a compelling unlikable  character. The basic premise of the script which deals with Zero's  smoothness on the job but social ineptitude in real life is very well  handled until he meats the blackmailer herself (Kim Dickens) and becomes  romantically involved with her. The cornyness of that subplot is what bogs  down the film a little. But still this is one of the most original  mystery-comedies since 'Blood Simple', a much darker and better film of  course but it can be considered a mystery-comedy. Flaws aside it's smart,  funny, original, inventive and entertaining.

His quirks make you more fond of him for in fact they show his humanity. Some may think of him like a modern Sherlock Holmes. Afterall both are brilliant and passionate about their work. Holmes had a case involving a spy once that he fell for and her demise hurt him deeply. Although this case is not about spies, it is a complicated case involving missing keys, an old tape, a lock box, blackmail, and a murder scene that takes time to unravel. Zero is assisted by Steve Arlo, a lawyer that is capable at keeping Daryls identity hidden, being the face the clients see, and good at some background casework as well. Once we see all the pieces of the puzzle we are happy to have been let in on the case and the outcome. It may not be clear as to the fate of the woman Zero falls in love with, but we have an idea there is a chance he will meet her again. As for Zero's case name, brevity is something he needs to become familiar with if he plans to sell it to a publisher. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The cast really do a superb job in their roles and the story was interesting and kept me drawn to the movie. Anyone in your family that enjoys good mysteries probably will like it.

32911,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,0780623215,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[11, 13]","The least one can say about ZERO EFFECT is that the script is very intelligent and reveals the work of a genuine writer. Jake Kasdan has certainly read the adventures of Conan Doyle's super detective Sherlock  Holmes with great delight. Like Holmes, bill Pullman likes to teake drugs  (amphetamines for Bill, heroin for Sherlock) and to play music (guitar  while Holmes had a predilection for violin) when he's out of work. Like  Holmes, Bill stays away from women who could deconcentrate him and loves to  surprise his audience with his wonderful sense of observation and the  amazing logic of his deductions. His only problem : Watson isn't a Doctor  but a lawyer who will not (ungrateful Ben Stiller !) write the story of the  numerous cases he has solved during his career. So he has to open his PC  and do the job himself. The scene in which Bill Pullman tries to find keys  in Ryan O'Neal's office is undoubtedly an homage to E. A. POE's detective  Auguste Dupin in THE PURLOINED LETTER (1845 !). In fact, nothing new under  the sun ! But these references are discreetly hidden in this movie and  demands a constant attention in order to appreciate them. ZERO EFFECT is  the first movie of Jake Kasdan and I look forward for his next films with  great impatience.

However, when he is hired to find a blackmailer, he comes into contact with and ultimately falls in love with Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens), a modern day version of Irene Adler.This is a very well made and enjoyable film, and it interesting (and very funny) to see Kasdan's idea of what Sherlock Holmes would be like if he were alive today.

32918,A2SQMRO1QJ2OBE,0780623215,"Jeremy Smith ""Merriman""","[34, 37]","Jake Kasdan himself, the director of ""Zero Effect,"" admitted that the Detective-Story plot is a Hollywood favorite. Having admitted that, he went on to create one of the best movies I've seen, and certainly the best I've seen in this genre, while at once adhering to the rules of the detective story and creating such a sharp, intelligently written story that it makes you shake your head.There is so much to love about this movie I hesitate to begin. How about with the dialogue? From the first line, the dialogue is precise, subtle and funny. Someone famous once stressed that subtlety is key to lasting humor, and this script is exemplary; it's as funny the tenth time I watch it as it was the first. For once, we get to laugh at the detective hero, to laugh at his human flaws, as well as marvel at his methods.Ben Stiller is a master of the human kettle of frustration, and is a great counterpoint to Pullman's various quirks. I didn't like Stiller much before this film, but have since become a staunch fan thanks to his performance here. Kim Dickens was fantastic, as was the role created for her. Detective movies usually feature a femme fatale with much more to her than meets the eye, but Clarissa is one to beat them all. I'll let it stand at that so as not to ruin any of the plot. And Ryan O'Neal rounds out the main cast with a wonderful portrayal of a white-collar criminal.People accuse me sometimes of taking movies too seriously, but I argue back that my favorites are ones that actually teach me something lasting. As we watch, we solve the mystery along with Daryl Zero, and we learn his methods, similar to reading along to a Sherlock Holmes story (in this case, see ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). While the real world of PI's almost always involves following a spouse around to see if they're cheating, one can still learn from this artificial world of blackmail, murder and reprisal. It is true that 'watching someone in their natural habitat can be very telling,' and learning how to be an objective observer ('the 2 obs') is rewarding. There is one scene where Zero makes his assessment of his client after watching him for a day at the gym, and it is absolutely fantastic.I read a review of this film that complained about a thin soundtrack. Kasdan himself addressed the question: he hates, as do I, when a soundtrack tells you how to feel. If there's a love scene, play pretty piano music in the background. If someone's being followed, play music in a sinister minor chord. You get the idea. Can't you make a love scene realer, and more poignant, by playing nothing at all, by letting the rustle of a dress as it falls to the floor stand alone as a supremely erotic noise? Kasdan used music minimally, to accentuate a scene rather than make up for it.Jake Kasdan, in his first solo effort as director, made a film as masterful and quirky as its main character, and at the same time made me hang on to every word while I was stunned time and again at the remarkable plot twists.

As you can note by the many reviews, it is very Sherlockian.  No small wonder: it appears to be a retelling of the Holmes story ""A Scandal In Bohemia.""  It borrows the skeleton of the original story - which provides us with the comfortable old paradigm - but it veers from the source material enough to make it feel entirely fresh.  Which is cool.Also, it is interesting from a visual standpoint, which lends credibility to Sherlock's quote (from yet another story) that ""Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms,"" considering Jake Kasdan's paternity.  In this case, it might be better to amend the quote to ""Art in the blood can't help but reveal itself.""  It's a pretty looking film, and the camera is in the hands of someone who understands how to use it as a narrative device.Even those who haven't read every Sherlock Holmes story available will possibly like this, because I think most people like to watch stories about really, really smart people who figure stuff out . . . particularly when those smart people have a difficult time keeping themselves together, despite their intelligence.The comparison to Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be quite complete without pointing out that this movie is very sequel-worthy ... and I hope that its makers finally arrive at the same conclusion.",5,The Case of the Movie That's A Lot Like A Sherlock Story,1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,1403,"['enjoy', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'picture', 'are', 'doing', 'disservice', 'can', 'note', 'many', 'reviews', 'very', 'Sherlockian', 'small', 'wonder', 'be', 'retelling', 'Holmes', 'story', 'Scandal', 'Bohemia', 'skeleton', 'original', 'story', 'comfortable', 'old', 'paradigm', 'source', 'material', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'entirely', 'fresh', 'Which', 'cool.Also', 'interesting', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'credibility', 'Sherlock', 'quote', 'yet', 'story', 'Art', 'blood', 'liable', 'take', 'strangest', 'forms', 'considering', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', 'paternity', 'case', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'amend', 'quote', 'Art', 'blood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'reveal', 'pretty', 'looking', 'film', 'camera', 'hands', 'someone', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'narrative', 'device.Even', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'story', 'available', 'will', 'possibly', 'like', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'watch', 'stories', 'really', 'really', 'smart', 'people', 'who', 'figure', 'stuff', 'out', 'particularly', 'when', 'smart', 'people', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'keeping', 'together', 'intelligence.The', 'comparison', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'quite', 'complete', 'pointing', 'out', 'movie', 'very', 'sequel-worthy', 'hope', 'makers', 'finally', 'arrive', 'same', 'conclusion']",N/A

People talk about what they're going to do, what they've done, what they're doing. There's a lot of talk and little action. For some kinds of movies, that's fine. But for this kind of movie it just doesn't seem to quite work. Of course you can consider this to be a very offbeat detective story, which is what it is, true. But the characters are just not involving enough to counterbalance the offbeat quality of the movie.We don't really get a fully humanized portrait of Daryl Zero, the title character. As for his assistant, Steve Arlo, we know he's getting tired of working with Zero, but that seems to be the main trait that comes across characterizing him, which doesn't do much to flesh him out either. As for the ""bad guy"", Ryan O'Neal, he's bland. Zero's love interest, played by Kim Dickens, is the most fully realized character in the movie but when you bounce that characterization against someone who we don't have a fully developed character for, it just doesn't feel like there's a legit reason for the two of them to hook up.I gave this three stars because the ideas are sharp.

You have your eccentric, but brilliant detective, his trustworthy aide, and a mystery to be solved by logic and reasoning.  It is a well made, and well crafted story, and I would love to see a sequel.Bill Pullman, a terrific actor has whose finally managed to lift himself beyond supporting roles and has come into his own as a leading man, is sensational as Daryl Zero.  His methods, observation and objectivity, which he calls the ob's, are similar to those employed by Sherlock Holmes, and have stood the test of time very well.  Ben Stiller is Steve Arlo, Zero's attorney and assistant, who is set up as Zero's Watson, however, he was not chronicle Zero's work for him, so Zero ends up having to do this on his own.  The two work well together, and have a real chemistry, which adds a further dimension to the movie.Zero, like Holmes, plays an instrument, a guitar instead of a violin, but he plays badly, while Holmes was a decent violinist.  These differences, I feel, were used, to keep the two of them separate since Zero is in fact, a good detective in his own right, and doesn't really require any further accrutements.  Zero, although a brilliant detective, doesn't interact well with people, and has Arlo meet with all prospective clients, and deal with them exclusively.  His only concern is solving the crime, not with dealing with anything else involved.The particular case that we are presented with has to deal with a businessman who has lost his keys, and wants Zero to find out who has them.  Of course, the mystery is much deeper than that; and in the course of the investigation Zero will have to deal with blackmail, a decades old murder, and the most perplexing thing he's ever had to deal with before, love.Kim Dickens plays the character Daryl falls in love with for the first time in his life, losing hold of his own cherished objectivity in the process.  Seeing how he deals with this, and how he manages to solve the mystery at the same time, is all part of the fun.If I had one complaint to make about the movie, it would be on the length.  The movie runs nearly two hours long, but proabably could have been trimmed by about fifteen minutes or so to make it run a little tighter, but that's only a minor quibble.

The problem with Kasdan's film is that it doesn't get much beyond this modestly clever idea. Mixing excessive plot intricacies and broad, quirky comedy, the film ends up as a mildly puzzling sophomoric diversion.The self-styled ""world's greatest detective"" is Daryl Zero, played by Bill Pullman (Independence Day). He's a twitchy character, hair askew, eyes glazed and living in Howard Hughes-like isolation. As is often the case, Pullman seems to be in an acting class of his own, experiencing complicated inner surges and thoughts that don't have much to do with his character.This is hardly the ""cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind"" of Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, though the parallels are deliberate. Instead of cocaine, Zero imbibes amphetamines; instead of playing the violin, he plays loud, squawky confessional songs on his acoustic guitar. But armed with the latest in information-gathering technology and arcane knowledge -- bylaws governing motel bed placement for the past 30 years -- Zero solves cases with magical precision. The Watson of the story, Steve Arlo, is played robotically by Ben Stiller (Flirting with Disaster). He's a resentful sidekick who gets drunk and complains incessantly about his employer while trying desperately to have an ordinary romantic life after office hours. He works as a front man for Zero, maintaining strict client confidentiality, and collecting big fees.At the beginning of the film, Arlo is in a meeting with lumber tycoon Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a client of Zero's who is searching for missing keys to a safety deposit box, but who is also being blackmailed for a secret he will not reveal. In short order, Zero has figured out who is doing the blackmailing: a paramedic (a tough gamine played by Kim Dickens, who makes a strong impression here as she does in Great Expectations) who works at Stark's health club. In his quest to expose her motives, Zero gradually finds himself falling in love for the first time in his life, a fallibility that never afflicted Sherlock Holmes.The movie then changes directions to concentrate on the love story, while Arlo continues his quest to break free of his boss so he can enjoy a fling of his own. The plot is complicated, relying on Zero's weird knowledge and observational skills. But the momentum is gone long before the movie ends and one is left only with a faint sense of curiosity.

Except he's a very odd private detective. He never meets with clients, always talking to them through his intermediary Steve Arlo (Keeping the Faith's Ben Stiller). He is quite capable of doing his job, and doing it well, but when he's off the clock, he turns into a neurotic wreck (did you ever see Creepshow? Think E. G. Marshall, but the sloppy version). Zero accepts a case from Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a wealthy chap who's being blackmailed. He won't say what he's being blackmailed about, of course. The farther into the case Zero gets, the odder things become, and on top of it all he finds himself extremely attracted to Gloria Sullivan (Thank You for Smoking's Kim Dickens), a paramedic he meets in the course of investigation.Kasdan's feature film debut is a fun little flick, at least. Pullman is surprisingly good in the role, a definite change from the calm, tightly-wound types he normally plays. This is also one of those rare films where Ben Stiller shows that he can, in fact, act. Dickens also turns in an above-average performance, but everyone else involved seems rather dull; even O'Neal seems to be doing a (rather passable) attempt at a William Shatner impersonation. Amusing for what it is, but is loses its lustre when carried on for an entire film. Angela Featherstone, playing Arlo's girlfriend, seems thrown into the film solely for eye candy (the subplot that develops because her character exists could have been done in a number of ways), and the majority of the minor characters seem to be there for window dressing more than anything else. Also, the pace could have used a bit of tightening.Still, not a bad movie by any means; it's just a first film, with many of the hallmarks of a first film. ** ",3,Circle gets the square!,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2014,"['Zero', 'Effect', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', '1998', 'saw', 'movie', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'mulling', 'head', 'ever', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'liked', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure.Darryl', 'Zero', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'private', 'detective', 'very', 'odd', 'private', 'detective', 'never', 'clients', 'always', 'talking', 'intermediary', 'Steve', 'Arlo', 'Keeping', 'Faith', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'quite', 'capable', 'doing', 'job', 'doing', 'well', 'when', 'clock', 'neurotic', 'wreck', 'did', 'ever', 'see', 'Creepshow', 'Think', 'E.', 'G.', 'Marshall', 'sloppy', 'version', 'Zero', 'case', 'Gregory', 'Stark', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'wealthy', 'chap', 'who', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'course', 'farther', 'case', 'Zero', 'odder', 'things', 'become', 'top', 'extremely', 'attracted', 'Gloria', 'Sullivan', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'paramedic', 'course', 'investigation.Kasdan', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'fun', 'little', 'flick', 'least', 'Pullman', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'role', 'definite', 'change', 'calm', 'tightly-wound', 'types', 'normally', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'can', 'fact', 'act', 'Dickens', 'also', 'above-average', 'performance', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'rather', 'dull', 'even', ""O'Neal"", 'be', 'doing', 'rather', 'passable', 'attempt', 'William', 'Shatner', 'impersonation', 'Amusing', 'what', 'lustre', 'when', 'carried', 'entire', 'film', 'Angela', 'Featherstone', 'playing', 'Arlo', 'girlfriend', 'thrown', 'film', 'solely', 'eye', 'candy', 'subplot', 'character', 'exists', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'number', 'ways', 'majority', 'minor', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'window', 'dressing', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Also', 'pace', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'tightening.Still', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'many', 'hallmarks', 'first', 'film', '**']",N/A
32929,A2YQVH5XGGWBHP,0780623215,Robert S. Truesdell,"[2, 8]","I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that I won't give it more than three stars. Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller both give great performances in this movie; this may be Pullman's finest vehicle to date. However, the movie ultimately fails to live up to the potential of a decent enough screenplay because of the directing. I got the feeling that Kasdan didn't entirely trust the actors nor the audience to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; so rather than letting Zero's quirky character stand on its own, various characters have to say throughout the movie, essentially, &quot;Zero is quirky,&quot; over and over again.There are too many poignant pauses that embarrassingly just hang there, not contributing to character development. Other scenes drag on providing detail that simply doesn't contribute to the overall enjoyment of the movie. I got the feeling that the director was aiming for a &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; sort of cult following with audiences dissecting, for example, each line of Zero's love song sung standing on the bed in long underwear and boots.So if you just want to take the movie lightly and enjoy it, it has too much detail randomly applied. If you want to &quot;cult out&quot; on the movie, the detail seems spurious and not integrated.Surround sound mix was, at the very kindest, uninspired. Other than a few special effects (gun shots) there was a noticeable flatness to the sound stage. A perfect example is when Zero and the girl are out shooting at night: there is a lot of ambient outdoor noise (frogs, crickets, et cetera) but it is all coming out of the front center speaker. It is so easy to expand that out to the corners of the sound stage and thus augment the feeling of being outside at night...",3,Pullman at his best,973468800,"11 6, 2000",2000,1732,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'Pullman', 'finest', 'vehicle', 'date', 'However', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'decent', 'enough', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'got', 'feeling', 'Kasdan', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'trust', 'actors', 'audience', 'quot', 'fill', 'blanks', 'quot', 'so', 'rather', 'letting', 'Zero', 'quirky', 'character', 'stand', 'own', 'various', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'essentially', 'quot', 'Zero', 'quirky', 'quot', 'again.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'poignant', 'pauses', 'embarrassingly', 'just', 'hang', 'there', 'not', 'contributing', 'character', 'development', 'Other', 'scenes', 'drag', 'providing', 'detail', 'simply', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'got', 'feeling', 'director', 'was', 'aiming', 'quot', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai', 'quot', 'sort', 'cult', 'following', 'audiences', 'dissecting', 'example', 'line', 'Zero', 'love', 'song', 'sung', 'standing', 'bed', 'long', 'underwear', 'boots.So', 'just', 'want', 'take', 'movie', 'lightly', 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'randomly', 'applied', 'want', 'quot', 'cult', 'quot', 'movie', 'detail', 'spurious', 'not', 'integrated.Surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'was', 'very', 'kindest', 'uninspired', 'Other', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'gun', 'shots', 'was', 'noticeable', 'flatness', 'sound', 'stage', 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'Zero', 'girl', 'are', 'shooting', 'night', 'lot', 'ambient', 'outdoor', 'noise', 'frogs', 'crickets', 'et', 'cetera', 'coming', 'front', 'center', 'speaker', 'so', 'easy', 'expand', 'corners', 'sound', 'stage', 'thus', 'augment', 'feeling', 'being', 'outside', 'night']",N/A
