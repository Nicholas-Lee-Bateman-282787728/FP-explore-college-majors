167238,AN81JUYW2SL24,0965045072,Gearhead Mania,"[7, 7]","A Twist of the Wrist 2 DVDI hesitated to order this DVD based on all of the reviews that commented on the corny acting. Once I watched it, I have to admit the acting wasn't that bad and it did not detract from any of Keith Code's lessons. Some of the basic rules from his book are covered in an interesting way. Code lectures to a group of young riders, going over the basic concepts in a ""slow"" and elementary manner to show that this isn't rocket science.Usually the survival reactions and problems are introduced with the 2 main characters complaining after a ride on the road or a few laps on the track. Keith or someone else interjects and takes it into the classroom or the narrator begins covering the problem, solution, and theory. One of the problems I had was staying awake throughout the DVD. The English narrator's tone is extremely boring, but the lessons are important.I found the DVD to be far more useful than both of his books, although Twist of the Wrist 2 (the book) is something I'd highly recommend. The lessons are more oriented towards intermediate to experienced riders headed for track days, although as a beginner, I found the cornering lessons to be useful in passing the Basic RiderCourse and getting my endorsement.Overall: 4/5 stars",4,"Supplements the book well, but also good as a standalone.

Alvi,"[1, 1]","My thing is cars rather than motorcycles (rode a motorcycle as a kid), but the ""Twist of the Wrist"" book was highly recommended by Carroll Smith, who I respect, so I got both the book and this DVD.I think the DVD is very well done, with excellent production quality.  It illustrates well, and often humorously, the struggles riders face in trying to improve, and addresses those struggles with great advice, supported by explanations of why the advice works in terms of basic physics.  I can't see how any non-expert rider wouldn't benefit from this.And I was intrigued to find that Carroll Smith is right.  The basic principles are very much the same for both motorcycles and cars, so watching this DVD helped me as a driver, and it was time well spent.Highly recommended for anyone involved in motor sports, and a great value too.",5,Well done!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,832,"['thing', 'cars', 'rather', 'motorcycles', 'rode', 'motorcycle', 'kid', 'Twist', 'Wrist', 'book', 'was', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Carroll', 'Smith', 'who', 'respect', 'got', 'book', 'DVD.I', 'think', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'excellent', 'production', 'quality', 'well', 'often', 'humorously', 'struggles', 'riders', 'face', 'trying', 'improve', 'addresses', 'struggles', 'great', 'advice', 'supported', 'explanations', 'why', 'advice', 'terms', 'basic', 'physics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'non-expert', 'rider', 'would', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'this.And', 'was', 'intrigued', 'find', 'Carroll', 'Smith', 'right', 'basic', 'principles', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'motorcycles', 'cars', 'so', 'watching', 'DVD', 'helped', 'driver', 'was', 'time', 'well', 'spent.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'involved', 'motor', 'sports', 'great', 'value', 'too']",N/A
