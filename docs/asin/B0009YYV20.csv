917005,A2PYMYL11MW8N5,B0009YYV20,Aaron Wooldridge,"[0, 0]","9 Songs was released a few years ago and is infamous for being a rare major motion picture in which all of the sex is real instead of simulated. I rented it a couple of days ago from Netflix. A female American student is in England attending college where she meets a male English scientist at an indie rock concert and has sex with him after the show. They begin a relationship in which they go to an indie rock concert, have sex, go to another indie rock concert, and have more sex. Over and over until they break up when she has to go back to America. The sex itself was supposed to tell the story of their relationship, and I guess it did.These indie rock bands  (9 real bands who were apparently thrilled to be featured in the movie) are all so incredibly boring and in my opinion not at all masters of their respective instruments. The sex, although explicit and real, was too artistic and shadowy to be very exciting. Also I didn't think the ""actors"" (if you can call going to concerts, having sex, and improvising bad dialogue ""acting"") were very good-looking. As I have already said there was no plot and the characters were uninteresting. You combine crappy music with boring sex, and I was somehow falling asleep while watching one of the most sexually explicit movies ever made. I ejected the DVD after watching little more than half of the movie. I had no interest in finishing this boring piece of garbage. I sealed it in the Netflix return envelope and mailed it the next morning.I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because I respect (even if I didn't enjoy) the artistic filming methods and the concept of using sex to tell a story.

We don't have any compelling reason to care about either of them. I guess this is considered an art film because the lighting is bad, it especially gets bad during the explicit sex scenes. The story consists of having sex intermixed with rock concert scenes. Somewhere in there they insert a few minutes of some kind of documentary with clips of Antarctica.

Yes the sex scenes are very graphic but they're over far too quickly and just not depicted very well in comparison to say Basic Instinct or Halle Berry in Monster's Ball... I know it's supposed to be a portrayal of ""real couples"" and the type of intimacy that you'd see in a real life bedroom but quite frankly I found the scenes rather boring in comparison to other films.  Furthermore while the male lead would probably be a wonderful bit of eye candy to female viewers (which is great as far as I'm concerned, it goes without saying that women should be treated to that kind of thing too not just men!) the female lead actress is not attractive at all, average face and far, far too slender... I think this is a deliberate effort on the filmaker's part - at one point the character asks her lover ""Do I look like a boy?"" - but the movie completely fails in it's attempt to make her appear erotic...

Travers ""Einhverfr""","[5, 5]","This film is not a story, and to the extent it has a plot, you know all of what you need to know in the first minute of the movie.  Hence if you are looking for a love STORY, skip this film.  Rather it's a portrait (viewed after the fact) of a brief passionate relationship between a glaciologist and an American drifter.  The whole movie consists of a series of flashbacks covering sex, a little in the way of drugs, and a lot of music, mostly rock and roll.  At the same time the movie has a tenderness and artistry that well exceeded my expectations.  This is not a porno flick (despite the real sex acts on film).Although the acting is very good, what makes the movie come alive and touch the viewer is the camera-work and editing.  The flashbacks of the sex scenes are brief, like recollections in real life, and they are interspersed with other memories and music, and the occasional flash to the present, where Matt is working in Antarctica.  The music (including a haunting piano solo commissioned for a different film but reused here to great effect) lends a set of additional contrasts which add depth to the movie.As a note about the music.  The nine rock concerts contrast with the Michael Nyman piano pieces, particularly ""Debbie"" (originally written forWonderland).  Hint:  If you want to get the Nyman music for this film, get this album:Wonderland 1999 Film Score.  Nyman's music adds a great deal of tenderness and humanity to what might otherwise be just a steamy set of sex scenes.If you are not offended by the subject matter or object to seeing actors perform real sex acts on film, I'd recommend suspending your idea of what a movie should be and watching this as it is intended to be watched, as a beautiful portrait of a memory of passion.",5,Post-structuralist cinema at its best.,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1763,"['film', 'not', 'story', 'extent', 'plot', 'know', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'first', 'minute', 'movie', 'Hence', 'are', 'looking', 'love', 'STORY', 'skip', 'film', 'portrait', 'viewed', 'fact', 'brief', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'glaciologist', 'American', 'drifter', 'whole', 'movie', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'covering', 'sex', 'little', 'way', 'drugs', 'lot', 'music', 'mostly', 'rock', 'roll', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'tenderness', 'artistry', 'well', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'not', 'porno', 'flick', 'real', 'sex', 'acts', 'film', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'movie', 'come', 'alive', 'touch', 'viewer', 'camera-work', 'editing', 'flashbacks', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'brief', 'recollections', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'interspersed', 'other', 'memories', 'music', 'occasional', 'flash', 'present', 'where', 'Matt', 'working', 'Antarctica', 'music', 'including', 'haunting', 'piano', 'solo', 'commissioned', 'different', 'film', 'reused', 'here', 'great', 'effect', 'set', 'additional', 'contrasts', 'add', 'depth', 'movie.As', 'note', 'music', 'nine', 'rock', 'concerts', 'contrast', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'piano', 'pieces', 'particularly', 'Debbie', 'originally', 'written', 'forWonderland', 'Hint', 'want', 'get', 'Nyman', 'music', 'film', 'get', 'album', 'Wonderland', '1999', 'Film', 'Score', 'Nyman', 'music', 'great', 'deal', 'tenderness', 'humanity', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'just', 'steamy', 'set', 'sex', 'scenes.If', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'subject', 'matter', 'object', 'seeing', 'actors', 'perform', 'real', 'sex', 'acts', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'suspending', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'intended', 'be', 'watched', 'beautiful', 'portrait', 'memory', 'passion']",9 Songs

And the director doesn't leave any doubt as to whether it was real or not. Rumors of spur-of-the-moment real movie sex are part of Hollywood lore (as was the case with The Postman Always Rings Twice and Wild Orchid). Here, there's no doubt about it: yep, they're really getting busy! No body doubles or simulations, it's the real deal. That said, there's not much else going on in this movie. The concert scenes are dull and take up far too much screen time, and the dialogue stops just when it starts to get interesting. Of the film's 70 minutes, I'd say there's 35 minutes of real content, much like another sexually explicit recent film, The Brown Bunny. A message to directors: if you are going to have explicit sex, also make the movie have a point. 9 Songs has only the thinnest of plots. What little does happen is not explained very well. Why is the girl going back to America at the end? Was she cheating on her boyfriend all the time? That might explain why she never let him come back to her place (a detail that is only given to us at the end). Answering these questions might have made for a longer and more interesting movie. Hollywood somehow can't bridge the gap between making a movie about sex and making a movie about people who are having sex. If you want explicit sex, I suggest you rent some porn. If you want a movie that is interesting, rent a recent title like Capote or Munich or something else that is a real challenge. If you are renting this, it's for the sex scenes.

The relationship of the film's two protagonists is portrayed in austere and non-manipulative terms. It does not insult an intelligent youthful modern audience: the sex scenes are candid and very real, and we don't get heaps of sharp dialogue from two people pontificating over the nature of sex and relationships. This film simply shows the intense but ephemeral bond of two people united by physical attraction.At least that's what I would have said if this film was any good. In fact I find it utterly insulting that anyone would think that I want to watch two bland characters going to concerts then having sex. That's it, that's the whole film! Wow, I'm blown away by its starkness and simplicity! No I'm not; I'm incredibly bored and a little bit angry. Oh look they're having sex again and it's quite graphic - how interesting and refreshing in its honesty. No, not really - unless perhaps you're a young dandy pretending to be intelligent and who hasn't come to terms with the brute facts of existence. Oh look, the two dullards have been to another gig and now they're having sex - again! Please, please stop! Can't we watch them playing Monopoly for a change?Traditionally, objectors to this sort of film airily claim that it is boring. This is the acceptable unshockable-sophisticate alternative to condemnation on moral grounds. Well, this film was both immoral and boring: I object to this film on the grounds that it is morally wrong to produce such a boring film: it was made by people who have horribly confused interesting and clever with boring and erm, boring.

It turned out to be a surprisingly sweet little film. Not much of a plot and not really a love story as such. It's more an experimental art film touching on memory - specifically the bittersweet memory of a lost love. A young Englishman remembers the short summer fling he had with a bright, vivacious, and beautiful 21-year old American girl. He obviously thought more of their summer tryst than she did. And when she leaves for home at the end of summer, he is devastated. He takes refuge in his work as a glaciologist, fleeing to the barren wastes of Antarctica. But if this film depicts what he thought of their relationship, it does beg the question, just how deep were his feelings towards her? If the only things you can recall of a relationship are the bouts of sex and rock concerts, that doesn't really say much for the relationship.This film has been endlessly compared to porn by various critics, even by the official reviewer here on Amazon. I find the comparison rather unfair. Yes, it has explicit sex scenes which would not be out of place in a porn video. But that does not make it porn. Sex is a natural part of a relationship and a natural part of life. The film depicts it as such without apology and without shame. When the relationship is over, this young man thinks back and concentrates only on the sex because that, sadly but truthfully, was what was most important to him, much as he would like to believe otherwise.The sex is hot. And more importantly, believable. Not the overblown silliness of porn. For people who have yet to see the film, make no mistake, everything is explicitly shown here, not lingering voyeuristically like in true porn but matter-of-factly like in a documentary. You see the couple engage in fellatio, cunnilingus and vaginal sex. And in a rare departure for a mainstream movie, you see the male partner ejaculate during fellatio. There are also 2 scenes where the young lovers experiment with mild bondage; blindfolds and tying down to the bed during sex. The actors are unknowns but they play their parts very well. Kieran O'Brien (Matt) looks like your average young London guy. Margo Stilley (Lisa) was in real life an American based in the UK and she is seriously cute.I am not a fan of contemporary British rock music, so I endured the songs more than enjoyed them. But the believabilty of the intimate moments more than made up for it. The 9 songs recorded during 9 live concerts, act as chapter breaks between the bouts of sex.The film was shot on Digital Video and is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is fair considering the source material. Colours are strong and natural. Black levels are fine. Sharpness is satisfactory. Sound is available in both DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0. The sound is fair although rather lacking in Oomph for a rock concert, even when I did allow it get up to normal levels. I spent most of the time muting the volume during the rock concerts and boosting it to hear the dialogue. Optional Spanish subtitles are provided. There are about 30 minutes worth of interviews, 15 mins with Margo Stilley and about 7 mins each with Kieran O'Brien and director Michael Winterbottom. There are 5 separate music videos from the bands, The Dandy Warhols (Smoke it / The Last High), The Von Bondies (C'mon, C'mon) and Elbow (Intro-Meet the Band / Forget Myself). The film itself is playable as a concert only version, shorn of all the sex. I'm not sure who would want that but the option is there. Finally there is the theatrical trailer and a small photo gallery. The sex is hot but if you're looking for porn you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a film that tells a story, like 90% of American audiences, you'll also be disappointed.

I'm sure you've seen all the mainstream flicks (at least most of the good ones) and now you're searching the fringes of the movieverse to find something new and obscure. Well 9 SONGS fits that category fairly well. And if you're familiar with films, then I'm sure you've seen the Paul Thomas Anderson classic Boogie Nights. If not, go back to your watch list. I really think you overlooked one! But in that movie, Burt Reynolds is a pornography director who dreams of making porn with a story so good that it will excite people's minds as well as their loins! And if his character had existed and were still making films to this day, I'm sure that 9 Songs would have closely resembled what he'd be directing now. 9 Songs contains graphic nudity and real sex actually performed by the two lead actors. The only difference between this and actual porn is the way its shot. Its photographed in a way that's very pleasing cinematography-wise (and not like a shaky Mini-DV clip you find on pornhub.com). Its filmed with careful attention to details and resembles a lot of early 2000's movies like City Of God (only with much more genitals). However this movie isn't perfect. The story is very simple, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when the filmmakers find the need to splice in elements of a concert film that doesn't really push the story forward at all, it starts to get a little annoying after a while. You get the feeling that the only reason they were included at all was to give the movie its barely feature length running time. I just found myself fast forwarding through most of those parts. But it is what it is; a pretty well shot flick with plenty of good sex, a story simple enough not to get in the way of their good sex, and misplaced music videos that interrupt all the good sex they could be having!

It is a serious piece of film-making but there are two major components that you may love or hate - extreme sexual explicitness and modern rock music. No narrative, no back story, no characterization, just plenty of sex and music. It's hard to know just what Winterbottom is trying to achieve with this film. There certainly is a good film to be made about a relationship built on sex, indeed there have been a number of classic films which do tackle the subject intelligently and provocatively, such as 'Last Tango in Paris' or 'Ai No Corrida'. But both those films benefited from strong character development and at least one superb performance ('Tango' is Brando's finest hour while Eiko Matsuda is extraordinary in Nagisa Oshima's film), and these are aspects that are sorely lacking in '9 Songs'.But the flaws of '9 Songs'' structure are the least of the film's problems. The main reason it doesn't work is down to the poor performances and total lack of chemistry between the two stars. Admittedly they don't have much to work with, as character development does not seem to rank highly on Winterbottom's agenda, but Matt and Lisa are such a dull, irritating couple that it is impossible to care what they get up to.

Did not have much of a story, guy who has a isolating job goes to London to see some rock bands and meets a young free-spirited girl, who he ends up having a sexual fling with that lasts about a month.  Another reviewer said they were so unattractive.  I am not sure why anyone would comment about their attractiveness, but I thought they were alright.  There is a lot of sex in this movie, and nothing to imagine here, everything is pretty much out there for all to see, so if that bothers you, then you might not enjoy this movie.I know a lot of people did not like the movie and felt it had no point and was boring.  I did not think it was boring.  If you could accept it for what it is (just a snippet of time in the life of this guy and one relationship he had with a girl he met in London), then I think you might be able to enjoy it more.Some people complained about the quality of the music; it was alright.  If you want a little more indepth about the bands, they have a little more detail on them in the special features section of the movie, which I thought was good.I was interested in how this couple interacted when they first met and first  became intimate, and how this progressed (or regressed) by the end.There is an energy you can feel, if you go to these kinds of shows (I saw the Libertines in NY a few years back) that is interesting, and I did feel that here also during the shows in the movie.So, to sum it all up, if you can just let it flow, and not have any pre-conceived notions about what this movie should be, and you enjoy live rock band music and that whole energy and vibe, then I believe you can enjoy watching this movie.",3,"Review of ""9 songs""",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1794,"['watched', 'other', 'night', 'wanted', 'just', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'deepest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'isolating', 'job', 'London', 'see', 'rock', 'bands', 'young', 'free-spirited', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'sexual', 'fling', 'month', 'reviewer', 'said', 'were', 'so', 'unattractive', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'comment', 'attractiveness', 'thought', 'were', 'alright', 'lot', 'sex', 'movie', 'nothing', 'imagine', 'here', 'everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'there', 'see', 'so', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'felt', 'had', 'point', 'was', 'boring', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'boring', 'could', 'accept', 'what', 'just', 'snippet', 'time', 'life', 'guy', 'one', 'relationship', 'had', 'girl', 'met', 'London', 'then', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'more.Some', 'people', 'complained', 'quality', 'music', 'was', 'alright', 'want', 'little', 'more', 'indepth', 'bands', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'good.I', 'was', 'interested', 'how', 'couple', 'interacted', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'first', 'became', 'intimate', 'how', 'progressed', 'regressed', 'end.There', 'energy', 'can', 'feel', 'go', 'kinds', 'shows', 'saw', 'Libertines', 'NY', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'interesting', 'did', 'feel', 'here', 'also', 'shows', 'movie.So', 'sum', 'up', 'can', 'just', 'let', 'flow', 'not', 'have', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'enjoy', 'live', 'rock', 'band', 'music', 'whole', 'energy', 'vibe', 'then', 'believe', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie']",9 Songs

Salzenstein ""Style Editor""","[2, 3]","If you're one of those people who loves watching sex on TV but doesn't like renting or buying porn, then you're in luck: 9 Songs is definitely for you. With more sex (and much better cinematography) than late night HBO, Showtime and even `Skinemax,' 9 Songs is a hardcore art film with little in the way of plot or story and lots of hot, raw, steamy sex.An official selection of film festivals around the world, I've been wanting to see 9 Songs since I missed it at Sundance. Having heard a lot about it, I had high hopes and was expecting to see a great story of love, set to the soundtrack of nine songs- the length of the movie. Having seen it, I can't say that I regret it, but the film itself didn't exactly knock me out of my boots.Sociologically 9 Songs is very interesting. That someone (Michael Winterbottom) would make a film with actors engaging in graphic, real sex is certainly a statement on the time and society we live in and it's definitely not all bad. In fact, it was kind of interesting. The story- a man and woman's short (but very passionate) romance- was less enthralling and indeed parts of the film are confusing until (or unless) you watch the extras, explaining what the Antarctic has to do with a love affair in England.Gloriously shot, the filming and camera work is beautiful, and the characters themselves are interesting; the actors did their job well. There's just little to hold the story together, save for the sex and concert footage dividing the film.SPECIAL FEATURESThe special features- especially the interviews with the actors and director- bring the film together and raise the interest level greatly. Sharing why he made the movie and explaining some of the details left a bit vague in the film, Michael Winterbottom talks about the sex, the reaction, and the process of casting and filming 9 Songs. Both Kieran O'Brian and Margo Stilley also discuss their feelings on filming the largely unscripted film, dealing with the sex and its repercussions on their careers, and their experiences making the film.Winterbottom also discusses the use of footage from live concert performances, as well as the bands' (and their respective management) relation to finding out that their music was being used in a sexually explicit film. The special features also include an option to watch a Concert Performance Only track, the Original Trailer and a featurette on the Bands from 9 Songs.",4,Porn in disguise... but good porn (and good disguise!).,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2419,"[""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'watching', 'sex', 'TV', ""n't"", 'like', 'renting', 'buying', 'porn', 'then', ""'re"", 'luck', '9', 'Songs', 'definitely', 'more', 'sex', 'much', 'better', 'cinematography', 'late', 'night', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'even', 'Skinemax', '9', 'Songs', 'hardcore', 'art', 'film', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'story', 'lots', 'hot', 'raw', 'steamy', 'sex.An', 'official', 'selection', 'film', 'festivals', 'world', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', '9', 'Songs', 'missed', 'Sundance', 'Having', 'heard', 'lot', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'great', 'story', 'love', 'set', 'soundtrack', 'nine', 'songs-', 'length', 'movie', 'Having', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'regret', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'knock', 'boots.Sociologically', '9', 'Songs', 'very', 'interesting', 'someone', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'actors', 'engaging', 'graphic', 'real', 'sex', 'certainly', 'statement', 'time', 'society', 'live', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'story-', 'man', 'woman', 'short', 'very', 'passionate', 'romance-', 'was', 'less', 'enthralling', 'indeed', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'confusing', 'watch', 'extras', 'explaining', 'what', 'Antarctic', 'do', 'love', 'affair', 'England.Gloriously', 'shot', 'filming', 'camera', 'work', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'actors', 'did', 'job', 'well', 'just', 'little', 'hold', 'story', 'together', 'save', 'sex', 'concert', 'footage', 'dividing', 'film.SPECIAL', 'FEATURESThe', 'special', 'features-', 'especially', 'interviews', 'actors', 'director-', 'bring', 'film', 'together', 'raise', 'interest', 'level', 'greatly', 'Sharing', 'why', 'made', 'movie', 'explaining', 'details', 'left', 'bit', 'vague', 'film', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'talks', 'sex', 'reaction', 'process', 'casting', 'filming', '9', 'Songs', 'Kieran', ""O'Brian"", 'Margo', 'Stilley', 'also', 'discuss', 'feelings', 'filming', 'largely', 'unscripted', 'film', 'dealing', 'sex', 'repercussions', 'careers', 'experiences', 'making', 'film.Winterbottom', 'also', 'use', 'footage', 'live', 'concert', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'bands', 'respective', 'management', 'relation', 'finding', 'out', 'music', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'also', 'include', 'option', 'watch', 'Concert', 'Performance', 'Only', 'track', 'Original', 'Trailer', 'featurette', 'Bands', '9', 'Songs']",9 Songs

917050,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0009YYV20,K. Driscoll,"[11, 14]","I'm not sure there is much to say here.  Simply put, Michael Winterbottom has entered the world of pornography, at least partially.  Here, he has definitely made a very dirty film with very little else to say.  I'm not saying it offends me. Perhaps Winterbottom's 9 Songs comes off this way because it is about a relationship founded on and maintained by its sex.  We see Matt, a guy who does some work in Antarctica, meet Lisa, an American student.  Their relationship seems to be based predominantly on two things; a common bond with music and a common bond in enjoying sexual intercourse.  There is seemingly very little attachment beyond that and then the relationship ends when Lisa returns to the states.The explicit sex scenes are intertwined with footage of rock bands including the Von Bondies, the Dandy Warhols and Franz Ferdinand, just to name a few.  I was tempted to praise the film for combining elements that are pornographic with a compelling story and somehow attempt to not be gratuitous.  I don't know whether to call the graphic scenes honest or exploitative, but I suppose they serve some purpose within the context of the story.  It definitely seems empty and bleak in their final scene together.  9 Songs portrays sex far colder and realistic than porn does.I'm not sure that means it should qualify as good movie, but it certainly seems like an honest attempt to be original and bring elements like this into mainstream cinema, for better or worse.  The performances have been praised by some as daring but I have to say, any acting was pretty much a non-factor here.  I assume the performances are muted intentionally but they are either done so because the relationship portrayed is a bleak and selfish one or because the acting chops were just no there.  It really doesn't matter why because either way it conveniently and perhaps unwittingly works for the benefit of the film.

917055,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0009YYV20,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","One of my favorite TV shows, ""Rescue Me"" has an opening theme song that I had never heard before.  A little research shows the song is called ""C'mon, C'mon"" by The Von Bondies, an American rock band formed in 1997.  They also appear in this short, 70 minute movie.  Here's the premise:  Two 20-somethings, an American woman (Margo Stilley, ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"") visiting England and a British glacial scientist (Kieren O'Brien, ""Goal!""), somehow meet (at a rock concert I think) and hook up back at his place.  They go to another concert, then back to his place for...yep, sex.  Now that's about it.There are shots of Antarctica spliced in once and a while as our dude compares the icy continent with relationships in a voice over.  What of course, makes this film different is that the sex is...real.  No, I'm not kidding.  Now it's not the hard core ""Vivid Production"" type sex, nor is it SkinaMax, soft core sex, but real romantic bedroom sex.  Unfortunately the rock concerts are shot a mile away,  I guess to show it from our character's perspective.  This certainly doesn't help the rock bands, most of which are well known (Franz Ferdinand anyone).Back to the bedroom.  While our couple enjoy each other, clearly, it's all physical.  Certainly the young American, while smittin with the Brit, isn't in it for the long haul.  The movie is kind of cold, yet pretty realistic and certainly doesn't pull any punches in the bedroom.In case anyone cares the film is in Blu ray with a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While a step up from DVD it isn't by much.  I suspect that wasn't a big concern to the producers.  It is clear enough however to decern the American's efforts at shaving her lower regions and the Englishman's circumcisional (is that a word?) status.

I can't disagree with them. There isn't much of a story, but if you pay attention you do arrive at some interesting conclusions.""""The plot of the movie can be boiled down to this, boy and girl meet at a, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, rock concert and go to his apt and f*ck. Another concert and another roll in the hay. With some small exceptions this is the modus operandi for nine concerts.""""Matt is a scientist, a glaciologist and Lisa is a visiting American college student. Matt tried to keep up with Lisa, but I got the impression that he was overmatched, with Lisa, whom I thought was an excitement junkie. She was also more into experimentation. At one point one point Matt went home by himself as she stayed with a woman.""""I couldn't figure out why the sex scenes seemed so well done - almost real. Then, as the movie progressed it became obvious. The bathtub scene with Matt and Lisa, the only actors in the movie, gave me the first clue. With Matt (Kieran O'Brien) leaning back on one side of the tub and Lisa (Margo Stilley) on the other, she uses her feet to massage his erect penis in full view of the viewers. That was about halfway through the movie and was only the beginning. Each sex scene thereafter, became increasing more explicit.""""After about three months of steady rock concerts and sex, Lisa tells Matt that she will soon be going back to America. Matt is crushed, so that afternoon Lisa cheers him up by ... how can I say this? Blowing him! The viewer gets to see the whole episode, just like a porn movie. She sucks on him for about thirty seconds and then cuts away to a long view of Matt, ejaculating on himself.""""On the day she is scheduled to leave, the spectator is presented a vision of the couple having intercourse including clear view of phallic penetration.""""Speaking of the rock concerts, rock music fans, especially fans of British bands may be interested in the bands of the various concerts. I managed to dig seven of  them out - they are:""* Super Furry Animals* The Dandy Warhol* Franz Ferdinand* Elbow* Black Rebel Motorcycle Club* The Von Bondies* Primal ScreamConclusion""What one might get out of this movie depends upon what one's expectations are. No, it doesn't have much of a story, but I thought the overall product was entertaining and very watchable. The movie was realistic in everyway (not just the sex) and earthy. The acting by the two actors was really something to behold and so was the cinematography.""""It should be pointed out that the writer, producer, director of 9 Songs, felt there was a double standard regarding reading material vs film. He thought, since many erotic and even mainstream stories are extremely graphic, why can't mainstream movies also depict graphic sex. In comparison to the present day trend of filthy degrading pornographic films, 9 songs must seem extremely tame. Still, it is a big leap forward in sexuality from the average boring, poorly done soft-core movie.

The nine songs in the movie depict the stages of their relationship throughout the movie. Mat and Lisa became so close that they moved into an apartment together; Lisa was an American exchange student/drifter living in London and Mat a young English glaciologist.The Movie starts off with Matt reminiscing (one year later) about his relationship with his 21 year old American sex-addicted lover Lisa. There is no real story line in this film. So, the film shows Matt recalling blurs and even makes commentaries of his experiences with Lisa throughout the movie and recalls this as he travels across the glaciers in Antarctica.The sex scenes are real and very steamy.  This movie can very easily be classified as an X-Rated movie due to very real and raw sex scenes like oral sex shown on film between the two characters. Matt even came to a full climax on screen.  At times, I was on the edge of my seats watching like a voyeur. This movie is not a ""traditional porn movie.""  The sex scenes are very edgy, but are also very emotional and personal as it documents a sexual relationship.Although, there is no true story line, the characters appeared to have an emotional bond with each other, and it makes the film seem more like a documentary of a real couple's sex life which included very raw sex. I guess the best description could be a reality type show, except the characters are really just actors.  So, because of that point I would say that the chemistry between the two actors is very good because their on-screen chemistry really clicked.For me, the element of the Rock and Roll concert(s) throughout the movie was not appealing and was very distracting, but I do appreciate the director for doing so to create symbolism. There is also brief drug use and cocaine used by the characters in the movieI enjoyed the sex scenes and the small element of  a story line. In the end, I was left feeling highly aroused, and now have a very special spot in my heart for this movie.  This movie is not for most, especial for those who do not like Rock and Roll and for those who are looking for a real story line that can be clearly understood.This movie is confusing at times and chronologically out of place. But I believe that the film was intentionally not meant to make sense.  But if you related it to real relationships, one can say that relationships can also be unclear. And unclarity can sometimes be a very nice place to be.Four Stars out of FiveNatasha Brooks, Editor-in-Chief, Bare Back MagazineFairy Tales Can Come True: The Very Best Erotic Fairy Tales",4,~9 Songs~,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2829,"['9', 'Songs', 'X-Rated/porn', 'movie', 'show', 'symbolism', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'nine', 'Rock', 'songs', 'movie9', 'Songs', 'story', 'two', 'lovers', 'Matt', 'Lisa', 'who', 'grew', 'love', 'other', 'sex', 'meeting', 'rock', 'concert', 'nine', 'songs', 'movie', 'stages', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Mat', 'Lisa', 'became', 'so', 'close', 'moved', 'apartment', 'together', 'Lisa', 'was', 'American', 'exchange', 'student/drifter', 'living', 'London', 'Mat', 'young', 'English', 'glaciologist.The', 'Movie', 'Matt', 'reminiscing', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'relationship', '21', 'year', 'old', 'American', 'sex-addicted', 'lover', 'Lisa', 'real', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'So', 'film', 'Matt', 'recalling', 'blurs', 'even', 'commentaries', 'experiences', 'Lisa', 'movie', 'glaciers', 'Antarctica.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'very', 'steamy', 'movie', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'classified', 'X-Rated', 'movie', 'due', 'very', 'real', 'raw', 'sex', 'scenes', 'oral', 'sex', 'shown', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'Matt', 'even', 'came', 'full', 'climax', 'screen', 'times', 'was', 'edge', 'seats', 'watching', 'voyeur', 'movie', 'not', 'traditional', 'porn', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'edgy', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'emotional', 'personal', 'documents', 'sexual', 'relationship.Although', 'true', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'appeared', 'have', 'emotional', 'bond', 'other', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'documentary', 'real', 'couple', 'sex', 'life', 'included', 'very', 'raw', 'sex', 'guess', 'best', 'description', 'could', 'be', 'reality', 'type', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'actors', 'So', 'point', 'would', 'say', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'very', 'good', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'really', 'clicked.For', 'element', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'concert', 's', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'appealing', 'was', 'very', 'distracting', 'do', 'appreciate', 'director', 'doing', 'so', 'create', 'symbolism', 'also', 'brief', 'drug', 'use', 'cocaine', 'used', 'characters', 'movieI', 'enjoyed', 'sex', 'scenes', 'small', 'element', 'story', 'line', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'highly', 'aroused', 'now', 'have', 'very', 'special', 'spot', 'heart', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'most', 'especial', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'real', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'be', 'clearly', 'understood.This', 'movie', 'confusing', 'times', 'chronologically', 'place', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'intentionally', 'not', 'meant', 'make', 'sense', 'related', 'real', 'relationships', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'relationships', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'unclear', 'unclarity', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'place', 'be.Four', 'Stars', 'FiveNatasha', 'Brooks', 'Editor-in-Chief', 'Bare', 'Back', 'MagazineFairy', 'Tales', 'Can', 'Come', 'True', 'Very', 'Best', 'Erotic', 'Fairy', 'Tales']",9 Songs

By the final act of the film, as the relationship begins to fail, the sex is at it's most explicit (shown in sun drenched hues, lazy and slow - often the indicator of romance in films), but in this case the realty of boredom and routine.I enjoyed the film though, like most, I found some of the sex shocking.

917064,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009YYV20,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","9 Songs (Michael Winterbottom, 2004)The first thing I have to do in this review is confess that after the third horrible music-video segment of the movie, I started fast forwarding through the concert footage. It somehow never occurred to me, as people were marketing this movie to me as ""literate porn"", that I should take the name of the movie seriously, and that fully half its length would be performances by some of the worst bands to come out of Britain in the past twenty years. (Really, people listen to Franz Ferdinand and enjoy it?) This, I watched over a third of the movie's sixty-seven-minute running time on fast-forward. But, on the other hand, it means that only about half of the movie's sixty-seven-minute running time is actually focused on anything that might be a plot, character development, etc. When it comes right down to it, it's a short film that grew into feature length thanks to the inclusion of the concert footage. I'm sure that were I to sit down and actually pay attention to the nine songs in question, they'd probably provide me with some sort of godawful musical roadmap of the relationship between the two characters whose relationship is chronicled here. After all, that's the kind of thing that Winterbottom so dearly loves, that sort of unsubtle symbolism. After all, when your main character is a glaciologist, and he's flying over the antarctic when we first meet him, if you're not taking that as a sign that the relationship in question will not end well, then perhaps you need to see a few more Michael Winterbottom films.The basic plot of the movie, if you can call it a plot, is a depiction of the year-long relationship between Matt (Winterbottom regular Kieran O'Brien), the glaciologist mentioned before, and Lisa (Margot Stilley, recently of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People), a college exchange student. Basically, they have sex, go to a bad concert, engage in two brief conversations (and/or engage in one brief conversation and take drugs). Repeat nine times.I will applaud Winterbottom for actually making a ""literate porn"" movie; the sex is very much a part of the storyline and never comes off as gratuitous, and both Stilley and O'Brien are good enough actors that the relationship seems genuine from beginning to end. On the other hand, one wag at IMDB said that this is just a notch above the ""porn dramas"" of the seventies (back when porn movies still had plot, character, etc.), and I agree with that assessment, though I don't necessarily attach the same derogatory meaning to it as does he. Where Winterbottom gets that notch is in keeping to this same storyline, keeping us with these same two actors, both of whom are obviously very good at what they do, and not making it boring (or as boring as most porn films, anyway). Perhaps that's the reason behind the concert footage--when compared to bad British drug-pop bands, the sex is positively enchanting.Many have remarked on the complete lack of character development here, but I'm not so sure a lot of critics didn't miss the point here; it seems to me the characters are shown in such a narrow window that the only character development we have a chance to see is in the purview of the relationship. Again, this is right in keeping with Winterbottom's sense of overbearing symbolism, and I'm quite sure it was by design. As such, we're supposed to take away from the movie that these people are their relationship, which depending on how you take it is either a shocking condemnation of the humanity of these characters or a (surprisingly) subtle dig at the porn industry. I'd like to believe it's the latter, but again, the former seems right in keeping with that Winterbottom sense of symbolism.I don't want to make it sound like I despise all of Winterbottom's movies, or for that matter that I despised this Winterbottom movie in particular. Had I seen it on the big screen and not had a fast-forward button, to be sure, I'd probably be giving it a much harsher review. May I reiterate again how absolutely horrid the music in this movie is? (Why on earth is anyone still listening to Primal Scream, for the love of pete?) But these two characters are, if not sympathetic, at least flawed in ways that most audience members should be able to identify with, which should allow for at least some empathy. And they may be unlikable, but they're not bad people, really; we can root for them. As the characters, so the film. Not something I'll be watching again any time soon, but I'm glad I watched it. ***",3,Literate porn?

917065,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0009YYV20,Robert J. Crawford,"[4, 4]","This is a beautiful impressionistic film about an affair, as remembered by a scientist while flying over Antarctica.  He is remembering what will certainly be the great passion of his youth, the discovery of a perfect sex partner with whom he has nothing in common but their grinding, momentary love.  It is a fleeting, strictly limited merging, that is graphically portrayed (what the film will be remembered for, no doubt).The film is less a story than a series of moments that flit in and out of his memory, ending abruptly and without much resolution.  It is more poetry than novel.  I don't know if, as some reviewers claim, it is portraying something deeper than nostalgic sex, but the images have great power.Hopefully everyone experiences this kind of excitement and longing.  It is not meant to last, however painful it feels with the incredible ecstasies and imagined emotional highs before the horrible realization that you are building a fantasy together.  One can spend years feeling anger at the disillusionment that follows as well as fight its image of perfection when one enters a more mature relationship that entails compromise.  The young scientist seems to be at peace with it, so much as that is possible.This movie is great at portraying that moment in youth, when the patterns in your life do not feel set but there for the making and discovery.

I truly celebrate art that isn't afraid to express the world through an adult's eyes, unbridled.  That said, this film contains sex between the lead characters, and it's all very sensual.  The story itself is rather bare, few lines, mostly told through the visuals of the couples' interaction and the lyrics of the nine songs.  It gave an interesting and sometimes painful look into the daily life of relationships.  Real bodies adorned these sheets.  Both the leads were attractive people but they were far from the caricatures we are inundated with in most sexually iconic films.  The realism of their bodies, passion, problems, and interaction carried the film.  The direction seemed sparse, as most of the dialogue was improvised, though I'm sure that careful attention to subtler details is what brought it all together.  The songs selected were for the most part familiar, playing out the role of narrator despite the male lead's infrequent injections of perspective.  In short, I liked this film.  I wasn't dazzled or left emotionally altered, except that I felt some deep satisfaction simply walking away from a film knowing that it was made for adults about sex.  Nobody was raped.  Nobody cheated (without consent, anyway).  Nobody suffered ill consequences as a result of having and expressing a healthy libido.  Apparently that's a tall order in Hollywood.

917071,ADWD6Y3YJY47J,B0009YYV20,"Terrance Aldon Shaw ""Writer/Composer""","[1, 2]","A film about four of my favorite subjects: sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, and Antarctica, not necessarily in that order. What I find most to like about ""9 Songs"" is its down-to-earth honesty and almost total lack of pretense. The story of a sexual relationship between two refreshingly normal human beings is framed by concert footage with emphasis on the shared experience of the audiences, and brief glimpses of the remote Antarctic ice fields, perhaps the loneliest, most isolated places on the planet. The simple mundanity of these lovers' lives comes as a big breath of fresh air after so many over-blown pretentious artsy-fartsy, supposedly ""erotic"" films about emotionally damaged people (""Wild Orchid,"" ""Lie With Me,"" ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" ""Romance"" to name but a few). While the sex here is extremely explicit, it's hardly adventursome or kinky and definitely NOT pornographic. This is erotica (yes, there's a big difference). These are real people with names, feelings, emotions and normal-sized body parts, imperfect and unenhanced, making love the way real people make love, sometimes passionate and ferocious, more often warm, gentle and unhurried. So, if you're a humorless prude uncomfortable with intensely sexual subject matter, you have my profound sympathy along with the advice to avoid this film. (Also, please stop trying to ""write"" your priggish, ignorant semi-literate screeds in the form of ""reviews"" of films you should have had the good sense not to rent or buy in the first place.)

Their love is short, yet so real as is shown in the explicit love scenes which are real. Is this is porn film? By no means, but it is a love story that shows the emotions that connect two humans and we as an audience are along for the ride to see what true love is about.The story is strong, the performances brilliant and the film is only 67 minutes in length, something I wish could have been extended.There are interviews with the main actors and music from the groups who do the songs in the film.A++",5,"""A Simple Love Story...With a Twist""",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,849,"['came', '34', '9', 'Songs', '34', 'searching', 'internet', 'good', 'art', 'films', 'watch', 'What', 'did', 'view', 'made', 'emotional', 'engrossed', 'wanting', 'more.The', 'film', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'meet', 'one', 'summer', 'London', 'one', 'American', 'woman', 'drifting', 'London', 'other', 'handsome', 'young', 'lad', 'who', 'ice', 'glaciers', 'love', 'short', 'yet', 'so', 'real', 'shown', 'explicit', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'porn', 'film', 'means', 'love', 'story', 'emotions', 'connect', 'two', 'humans', 'audience', 'are', 'ride', 'see', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'about.The', 'story', 'strong', 'performances', 'brilliant', 'film', 'only', '67', 'minutes', 'length', 'something', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'interviews', 'main', 'actors', 'music', 'groups', 'who', 'do', 'songs', 'film.A++']",9 Songs

The secondary one is that it has ""exclusive"" live performances of nine songs by various artists including The Von Bondies and The Dandy Warhols. These performances, however, are shot with artless camera work and bad sound, and are worse than many amateur bootleg concert videos you can find on YouTube.The primary selling point is that in this movie, the actors playing the young couple in love actually have sex. And it's shown in graphic detail. Quite graphic at times. Which means, I suppose, that it's a porn flick, in spite of its indie pretensions at examining the fluctuations of a romantic/sexual relationship, but it's a curiously passionless and unstimulating variety of porn at best.Winterbottom's characters are unlikeable, which is allowable, but also uninteresting, which isn't. Watching them relate, in all ways, makes human relationships actually look off-putting.There is little story here, and what there is is bookended around the song videos. It's as if the writer/director had so little story he decided to use the songs as filler material. The result, at 71 minutes, is one of the subjectively longest damn movies I've ever seen.Every few minutes I clicked up the onscreen display to see how much time was left. It always seemed far too much, even at only three or so minutes remaining. At one point, I realized I'd actually picked up a book and started reading without thinking about it. That has never happened to me during any movie before. It was like my brain was seeking to bandage a wound in its stimulation.Consider yourself warned. 9 Songs, in spite of its dull sexuality (I started to write carnality, but there's nothing truly carnal about it), is a complete bore. Watching a toaster will probably arouse you more.I feel like my head's been wrapped in plaster.

917075,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B0009YYV20,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 6]","In the extras section, Michael Winterbottom says that he wants to make a movie about the claustrophobia that sets in when a relationship turns stale. You could pretty much get that from the shots of the Arctic and the narrator's voice-over concerning Agoraphobia and Claustrophobia together in one place. Only this movie traps you in the same space with these characters. They don't go outside, except to go to concerts and the space of their coupling becomes a tortorous existence.The guy is sad and Lisa is a jerk. The coupling scenes are real and anti-erotic. As we get to know these characters, we start to hate them. They use sex as a substitute for intimacy. They are bored with each other and half-way through the movie, we're bored with the sex. Actually I found myself repulsed with the sex. Not that sex is repulsive; it's just that these two characters are so repulsive and so tired of each other that their erotic world becomes an exercise in torture on par with Abu Ghirab. They go from being silly (idiotic) to bickering and cranky. When Lisa comes home after an argument, and says that she's brought herself as a present, you expect the guy to say ""That's great dear. Could you buy me some socks while you're at it? Because I would actually get some enjoyment out of the socks.""Eventually she leaves him and not a moment too soon. He's alone and in the arctic and she's away torturing another poor guy she meets in a club.So what about the rest of the movie? The music is great.As for the extras - the main actor has a lot more personality than you'd expect from the movie. Michael Winterbottom describes his method and his thought process in making the movie. It's a failure, but it's an interesting failure especially with Winterbottom on hand to discuss film theory. The actress is just as hideous as herself. She's not as cranky but she just rambles on and on and you do learn that she and the main actor didn't hang out off set (something that's pretty obvious from the lack of chemistry). She says it's on purpose.
