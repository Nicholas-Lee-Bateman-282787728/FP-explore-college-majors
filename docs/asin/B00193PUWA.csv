1161240,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B00193PUWA,Calamity Jane,"[1, 2]","Divorced Danny meets Clair, a banker, in a bar. After a night of passionate lovemaking, Clair invites Danny to come live with her and her 17-year-old daughter.But Danny has a secret and a hidden agenda. When an old acquaintance of Danny's suddenly shows up at Clair's house with a gun and a demand of $200,000, things spiral into a freak show of laughable disbelief. It's actually an insult that a storyline such as this was pawned off on theatergoers everywhere. Be glad you didn't pay to get into the theater to see this dud.As much as I would love to expose Danny's secret, as well as Clair's foolish final decision at the end, I won't. Though it isn't hard to figure out, it wouldn't be fair of me to reveal it to those who haven't watched the movie.Another strange part comes with the rolling of the end credits. Remarks are made that lead the viewer to believe this is a true story. I find that very hard to believe, but, alas, truth is stranger than fiction, so who knows.The acting is very good, especially from Clair's daughter. That's the reason for the two stars. The movie moves at a snails pace for the first 30 minutes or so. After that it drags in several parts. The ridiculous climax, if you hadn't already guessed it by the time Danny's armed acquaintance enters from stage left, will leave you either shaking your head in disgust, or cursing the video store that sold or rented you this flick.Don't purchase this dud. Wait until it hits the 50-cent rental shelf at the video store near you. Only then will the movie entertain you without leaving you feeling ripped off.",2,A Reluctant Two Stars,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1587,"['Divorced', 'Danny', 'meets', 'Clair', 'banker', 'bar', 'night', 'passionate', 'lovemaking', 'Clair', 'Danny', 'come', 'live', '17-year-old', 'daughter.But', 'Danny', 'secret', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'When', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'Danny', 'suddenly', 'up', 'Clair', 'house', 'gun', 'demand', '200,000', 'things', 'spiral', 'freak', 'show', 'laughable', 'disbelief', 'actually', 'insult', 'storyline', 'such', 'was', 'pawned', 'off', 'theatergoers', 'everywhere', 'Be', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'get', 'theater', 'see', 'dud.As', 'much', 'would', 'love', 'expose', 'Danny', 'secret', 'as', 'well', 'Clair', 'foolish', 'final', 'decision', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'reveal', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie.Another', 'strange', 'part', 'rolling', 'end', 'credits', 'Remarks', 'are', 'made', 'lead', 'viewer', 'believe', 'true', 'story', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'alas', 'truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'who', 'knows.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Clair', 'daughter', 'reason', 'two', 'stars', 'movie', 'snails', 'pace', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'several', 'parts', 'ridiculous', 'climax', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'guessed', 'time', 'Danny', 'armed', 'acquaintance', 'enters', 'stage', 'left', 'will', 'leave', 'shaking', 'head', 'disgust', 'cursing', 'video', 'store', 'sold', 'rented', 'flick.Do', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'dud', 'Wait', '50-cent', 'rental', 'shelf', 'video', 'store', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'movie', 'entertain', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'ripped', 'off']",Good People Bad Things

1161243,A1H5YDFGGKYKT5,B00193PUWA,"Namaste ""Rich""","[7, 7]","Danny (if that IS your real name?) moves out west and at a bar, meets Claire, who he dates, apparently falls in love with, and then moves in to live with her and her teenage daughter.  Danny suffers from nightmares about his past, but will not discuss them with Claire.  The movie has occasional flashbacks to previous times in Danny's life and to his previous marriage that are meant to give you clues to what is going on.The movie picks up the pace a bit midway, when a man from Danny's (Paul's) past shows up with a gun demanding 200,000 dollars.  Just about here, I thought the movie's director could have done a better job to tie things together.The biggest hole in the story-line is when Danny, while in love and living with Claire, starts online dating with various other women.  This just does not fit in with the rest of the story or with the rather abrupt ending.I thought the acting, except for the con man who came in well into the movie, was very good.  If you can forgive a few holes in the story, and the kind of blunt ending, you might even find the movie entertaining.",3,"entertaining, but could have been better but for a few holes",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1085,"['Danny', 'real', 'name', 'out', 'west', 'bar', 'meets', 'Claire', 'who', 'apparently', 'love', 'then', 'moves', 'live', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Danny', 'suffers', 'nightmares', 'past', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'Claire', 'movie', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'previous', 'times', 'Danny', 'life', 'previous', 'marriage', 'are', 'meant', 'give', 'clues', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'movie', 'up', 'pace', 'bit', 'midway', 'when', 'man', 'Danny', 'Paul', 'past', 'up', 'gun', 'demanding', '200,000', 'dollars', 'Just', 'here', 'thought', 'movie', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'tie', 'things', 'together.The', 'biggest', 'hole', 'story-line', 'when', 'Danny', 'love', 'living', 'Claire', 'online', 'dating', 'various', 'other', 'women', 'just', 'not', 'fit', 'rest', 'story', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'ending.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'forgive', 'few', 'holes', 'story', 'kind', 'blunt', 'ending', 'might', 'even', 'find', 'movie', 'entertaining']",Good People Bad Things
