997215,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000FZEQEQ,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","The world's worst high school is haunted by a petty-pouty-vengeful student who keeps attending classes until one teacher learns the truth, dying with the knowledge: ""Jin-ju is definitely dead.....but she's still attending school.""  All this begs the question, why keep attending this lousy school.  She died there; it couldn't have been all that fun.  The teacher's are vicious and think nothing of slapping the students around.  In one horrific scene, a teacher slaps a student causing her to fall to the floor where he continues to beat her severely while screaming, ""Die die!""  When he isn't fondling girls, he's thrashing them.  What kind of school is this!?At least this semi-horror film is very stylishly filmed, with a couple of startling images where terror should reside, but doesn't.  This is as tame as it gets, as far as ghost stories go.  Where clues should be there's an incessant sound of dripping throughout, don't know why.  There's a blood stain on the ceiling in one classroom that keeps getting bigger, don't know why.  There's a set of bells that seem to have some importance but I don't know why.  A lot of elements are repeated with no explanation.  If they are meant to shiver us uncontrollably, they don't.  This movie feels more like a testimony to the cinematographer than anything scary.  I will say it held my interest and at times was quite absorbing.  But.  It isn't a horror movie which is what I wanted/expected to see.There's nothing worse than a ghost with issues.",3,"""I just wanted a friend.  And a yearbook.

997217,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FZEQEQ,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[25, 30]","I would see how a person would note this film highly while others just see this as a bore. The first time I watched this I feel asleep on it due the time I watch it (my fault it was pass 1:00am). The second round I gave it my all divine attention and thought it was good. The 'Corridors' films are said to examine the trials and tribulations of school life with a supernatural bent. This entry begins with a teacher of a private all-girls school who reveals some mysterious secret that obviously has her nerves on edge. This discovery ultimately leads to her equally weird death: a noose around the neck, her body left hanging from a catwalk in the school courtyard for students to find. A noticeable suicide to some but we full well know it wasn't. From here the horrors of death swiftly turn about-face to the dread of teenage cliques and tyrannical teachers as we meet the artistically-inclined Lim Ji-oh and the restrained, social outcast Youn Jae-yi - two students who develop an unexpected bond that strengthens as more school faculty fall prey to a malevolent ghost. Said specter is lashing out for reasons of revenge and loneliness; left to piece these motivations together is a new teacher absorbed in her own painful memories that may yield some clues as to the origin of the school's supernatural presence.As far I can see director Park Ki-Hyung film moves at an unhurried pace that if you're not prepared for may knock you out faster than a bottle of Jack chased with some sleeping pills. That's my nice way of saying Corridors is more drama than straight-laced horror. It peers into the classroom door window of teenage relationships and doesn't flinch from some bitter realities. The girls here get catty, sometimes outright vicious, to their school chums. And if they ever do find a desire to unify with each other it's a clandestine bond against their teachers who are a violent lot not afraid to give a backhanded slap to put a student in place. There are a lot of touching moments of genuine melancholy which Park not only reflects in his characters but in the lens of the ever-roaming camera taking us down desolate hallways and sparse classrooms. But this emptiness gives way to nasty outbursts of violence with bleeding walls, ceilings and heads that provide welcome releases after such long bouts of mounting dramatic conflict.All of Corridors' roles are adequately cast with actresses who do a fine job replicating the several of over-bloated egos and vulnerable, simmering emotions existing in every school. And that's where Corridors predominantly takes us, through that hellish mental challenge called high school where many would not dare tread again. But in that fashion Joss Whedon tapped so successfully in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the paranormal is used here to uproot those underlying themes of social elimination, want of acceptance and even beauty. ""Whispering Corridors"" just takes some time getting its point across, but when it does, it's pretty potent stuff.",4,There's a rumor that a girl is haunting a school in South Korea....did you hear about it?,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2997,"['would', 'see', 'how', 'person', 'would', 'note', 'film', 'highly', 'others', 'just', 'see', 'bore', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'feel', 'asleep', 'due', 'time', 'watch', 'fault', 'was', 'pass', '1:00am', 'second', 'round', 'gave', 'divine', 'attention', 'thought', 'was', 'good', ""'Corridors"", 'films', 'are', 'said', 'examine', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'school', 'life', 'supernatural', 'bent', 'entry', 'teacher', 'private', 'all-girls', 'school', 'who', 'mysterious', 'secret', 'obviously', 'nerves', 'edge', 'discovery', 'ultimately', 'equally', 'weird', 'death', 'noose', 'neck', 'body', 'left', 'hanging', 'catwalk', 'school', 'courtyard', 'students', 'find', 'noticeable', 'suicide', 'full', 'well', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'here', 'horrors', 'death', 'swiftly', 'turn', 'about-face', 'dread', 'teenage', 'cliques', 'tyrannical', 'teachers', 'meet', 'artistically-inclined', 'Lim', 'Ji-oh', 'restrained', 'social', 'outcast', 'Youn', 'Jae-yi', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'develop', 'unexpected', 'bond', 'more', 'school', 'faculty', 'fall', 'prey', 'malevolent', 'ghost', 'Said', 'specter', 'lashing', 'out', 'reasons', 'revenge', 'loneliness', 'left', 'piece', 'motivations', 'together', 'new', 'teacher', 'absorbed', 'own', 'painful', 'memories', 'may', 'yield', 'clues', 'origin', 'school', 'supernatural', 'presence.As', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'Park', 'Ki-Hyung', 'film', 'moves', 'unhurried', 'pace', ""'re"", 'not', 'prepared', 'may', 'knock', 'out', 'faster', 'bottle', 'Jack', 'chased', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'nice', 'way', 'saying', 'Corridors', 'more', 'drama', 'straight-laced', 'horror', 'classroom', 'door', 'window', 'teenage', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'bitter', 'realities', 'girls', 'here', 'get', 'catty', 'sometimes', 'outright', 'vicious', 'school', 'chums', 'ever', 'do', 'find', 'desire', 'unify', 'other', 'clandestine', 'bond', 'teachers', 'who', 'are', 'violent', 'lot', 'not', 'afraid', 'give', 'backhanded', 'slap', 'put', 'student', 'place', 'are', 'lot', 'touching', 'moments', 'genuine', 'melancholy', 'Park', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'lens', 'ever-roaming', 'camera', 'taking', 'down', 'desolate', 'hallways', 'sparse', 'classrooms', 'emptiness', 'way', 'nasty', 'outbursts', 'violence', 'bleeding', 'walls', 'ceilings', 'heads', 'provide', 'welcome', 'releases', 'such', 'long', 'bouts', 'mounting', 'dramatic', 'conflict.All', 'Corridors', 'roles', 'are', 'adequately', 'cast', 'actresses', 'who', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'replicating', 'several', 'over-bloated', 'egos', 'vulnerable', 'simmering', 'emotions', 'existing', 'school', 'where', 'Corridors', 'predominantly', 'hellish', 'mental', 'challenge', 'called', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'many', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'tread', 'again', 'fashion', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'tapped', 'so', 'successfully', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'paranormal', 'used', 'here', 'uproot', 'underlying', 'themes', 'social', 'elimination', 'want', 'acceptance', 'even', 'beauty', 'Whispering', 'Corridors', 'just', 'time', 'getting', 'point', 'when', 'pretty', 'potent', 'stuff']",Whispering Corridors
997218,A1O0F4QDAMEKVB,B000FZEQEQ,Joey Comeau,"[1, 2]","Tartan Asia Extreme are so terrible at accurately representing these movies with the packaging, everything looks like it's going to be bloody as hell, like each film is an insane gore fest.Whispering Corridors is not like that at all. This is a very quiet sort of movie, spending most of its time examining the friendships and antagonisms between girls at a private school, showing us the steps leading up to a very believable betrayal. It is very much a drama where the conflict, when it comes, is usually very human. The supernatural aspects are integral to the story, but not really major until the final third of the movie. They are well done, and sometimes quite creepy, but ultimately these supernatural elements fit into the dramatic vision the film has created, rather than the movie becoming more of a horror movie.I am a huge fan of ghost stories that are as sad as they are scary. Some of my favourites are:The OthersandThe Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)andThe Orphanage- this movie is not as good as those, unfortunately, but it is enjoyable in its own way. It's very interesting and feels similar, but if you haven't seen those other three movies, I would start there.

Vicalvi ""Hammerfan""","[6, 8]","WHISPERING CORRIDORS is the kind of movie that you will want to watch at least three times - partly because the story is so layered that it takes a while to let it sink in. As a western viewer, I found it a little challenging to tell one girl from the other - not that all Asians look alike, but the adolescent girls all in uniform start to blend together. Maybe this was part of the director's intention, because the film deals with the crushing societal pressure to conform. I watched this late at night and dozed off at least twice; this was not because the movie was boring. It is not the kind of film that jolts you. It's a ghost story that works on a slow burn, which is part of the reason I like it so much. The ending especially impressed me - the past is always living in the present, the old ghosts never go away and there are always plenty of new ones to join them.  A conductor once introduced a classical piece by saying, ""This is music for virtuoso listeners"".  This film requires virtuoso watchers. Don't be afraid. Dive in.
