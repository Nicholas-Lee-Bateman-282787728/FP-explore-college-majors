1181997,A1WOMXOEX90ARI,B001DJLD2Q,"Avid Camper ""WS""","[5, 8]","We usually like Hugh Grant movies.  He's usually funny and a little romantic.  This collection was a little different.  Two of the movies (Mickey Blue Eyes and Two Weeks Notice) were funny, romantic, great!  The other two movies were ""strange"".  One, Music and Lyrics, was rather slow, drawn-out, boring and we couldn't wait for it to end.  The other, An Awfully Big Adventure was strange, hard-to-follow, kind-of-creepy, tragic and sad. This movie was rated R, the others were PG-13.  We also had trouble with the design of the DVD case.  It has a swinging insert holding one of the double-sided DVD's, which came loose during shipping scratching the DVD's, so that they skip and freeze.  The replacement was in the same condition.  We would suggest replacing the case, if you order.  However, for about $10, it was still a good deal, if only for the two better movies.",3,"Two Really Good Movies, Two So-So...",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,870,"['usually', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'movies', 'usually', 'funny', 'little', 'romantic', 'collection', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'Two', 'movies', 'Mickey', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'were', 'funny', 'romantic', 'great', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'strange', 'One', 'Music', 'Lyrics', 'was', 'rather', 'slow', 'drawn-out', 'boring', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'other', 'Awfully', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'was', 'strange', 'hard-to-follow', 'kind-of-creepy', 'tragic', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'R', 'others', 'were', 'PG-13', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'design', 'DVD', 'case', 'swinging', 'insert', 'holding', 'one', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'came', 'loose', 'shipping', 'scratching', 'DVD', 'skip', 'freeze', 'replacement', 'was', 'same', 'condition', 'would', 'suggest', 'replacing', 'case', 'order', 'However', '10', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'deal', 'only', 'two', 'better', 'movies']",4 Film Favorites: Hugh Grant
