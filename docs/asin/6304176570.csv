405725,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304176570,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","This is a fable about politics (like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""). A young idealistic man [the son of a former governor!] meets a professional political worker. The present US Senator loves oil, hates trees, and raises regressive taxes Can a challenger with a name, looks, and popular appeal become a successful candidate? The present Senator is a ""bloviator"" who revises history in telling stories about the past. [Does he remind you of Reagan?] McKay decides to run as a challenger and answers questions from the press. The professionals start to help McKay. [They do not tell about the big money men who support this candidate.] Does Crocker Jarman have the right stuff for today?There is a banquet for the candidates. Bill McKay makes a speech; he wants power for the people (but will not attack the corporations who hold power). There are topics about Vietnam, Red China, the environment, abortions. We see the candidate being prepared to answer questions. McKay visits people on the beach, the black ghetto, and meets people. He has charisma and wins in the primary. [No mention how the needed funds are raised; it's a good investment for some.] Now McKay must reach to those who can decide the general election. McKay promises ""A Better Way"" for the people of California. [Deliberately ambiguous?] This film explains how a campaign works. A brush fire allows a candidate to speak against policies, but the incumbent can make things happen. Is ""mass transit"" really a fix for placing people far away from their jobs?There is a problem at home. Will his wife's outfit work to gain votes? Are candidates sold by television advertising? [Ever since 1952.] Ambiguous statements by candidates have been around since Andrew Jackson's time. The professionals have raised McKay's polls by 14 points, closing the gap. They rehearse McKay for his debate with Jarman. McKay says problems can be cured without raising taxes. [Is this still true?] McKay's closing remarks are extemporaneous. Can he cure poverty, unemployment, crime, and unhappiness? The head of the Teamster's Union endorses McKay; they each have something in common: support from the other. Why does California have high unemployment? McKay turns into a rhetorician, asking questions that have no answers but somehow sound good. A parade is scheduled for lunch hour so the streets will be filled with people. Cars are stopped at intersections to create a traffic jam. Election day arrives with projections and early returns. The vote slowly puts McKay in the lead, and he wins. McKay has become dependent on his advisors. What will he do now?This film as a hit because it showed the scenes that are kept from the public in this story about politics. ""The Selling of the President"" pioneered this approach. A candidate tells the people what they want to hear, then cooperates with the special interests when he gets into office. People are fooled over and over, until the time when they form a political party that acts for their interests. Will they ever learn? Not if the corporate media can prevent it.",4,All the Way with Bill McKay?,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,3069,"['fable', 'politics', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'young', 'idealistic', 'man', 'son', 'former', 'governor', ']', 'professional', 'political', 'worker', 'present', 'US', 'Senator', 'oil', 'trees', 'regressive', 'taxes', 'Can', 'challenger', 'name', 'popular', 'appeal', 'become', 'successful', 'candidate', 'present', 'Senator', 'bloviator', 'who', 'history', 'telling', 'stories', 'past', '[', 'remind', 'Reagan', ']', 'McKay', 'run', 'challenger', 'answers', 'questions', 'press', 'professionals', 'start', 'help', 'McKay', '[', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'big', 'money', 'men', 'who', 'support', 'candidate', ']', 'Does', 'Crocker', 'Jarman', 'have', 'right', 'stuff', 'today', 'banquet', 'candidates', 'Bill', 'McKay', 'speech', 'power', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'attack', 'corporations', 'who', 'hold', 'power', 'are', 'topics', 'Vietnam', 'Red', 'China', 'environment', 'abortions', 'see', 'candidate', 'being', 'prepared', 'answer', 'questions', 'McKay', 'people', 'beach', 'black', 'ghetto', 'meets', 'people', 'charisma', 'wins', 'primary', '[', 'mention', 'how', 'needed', 'funds', 'are', 'raised', 'good', 'investment', ']', 'Now', 'McKay', 'must', 'reach', 'who', 'can', 'decide', 'general', 'election', 'McKay', 'A', 'Better', 'Way', 'people', 'California', '[', 'Deliberately', 'ambiguous', ']', 'film', 'how', 'campaign', 'brush', 'fire', 'candidate', 'speak', 'policies', 'incumbent', 'can', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'mass', 'transit', 'really', 'fix', 'placing', 'people', 'far', 'away', 'jobs', 'problem', 'home', 'Will', 'wife', 'outfit', 'work', 'gain', 'votes', 'Are', 'candidates', 'sold', 'television', 'advertising', '[', 'Ever', '1952', 'Ambiguous', 'statements', 'candidates', 'have', 'been', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'time', 'professionals', 'have', 'raised', 'McKay', 'polls', '14', 'points', 'closing', 'gap', 'rehearse', 'McKay', 'debate', 'Jarman', 'McKay', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'raising', 'taxes', '[', 'still', 'true', ']', 'McKay', 'closing', 'remarks', 'are', 'extemporaneous', 'Can', 'cure', 'poverty', 'unemployment', 'crime', 'unhappiness', 'head', 'Teamster', 'Union', 'McKay', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'support', 'other', 'Why', 'California', 'have', 'high', 'unemployment', 'McKay', 'rhetorician', 'asking', 'questions', 'have', 'answers', 'somehow', 'sound', 'good', 'parade', 'scheduled', 'lunch', 'hour', 'streets', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'people', 'Cars', 'are', 'stopped', 'intersections', 'create', 'traffic', 'jam', 'Election', 'day', 'projections', 'early', 'returns', 'vote', 'slowly', 'McKay', 'lead', 'McKay', 'become', 'dependent', 'advisors', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'now', 'film', 'hit', 'showed', 'scenes', 'are', 'kept', 'public', 'story', 'politics', 'Selling', 'President', 'pioneered', 'approach', 'candidate', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'then', 'special', 'interests', 'when', 'office', 'People', 'are', 'fooled', 'time', 'when', 'form', 'political', 'party', 'interests', 'ever', 'learn', 'Not', 'corporate', 'media', 'can', 'prevent']",N/A

He's an idealistic man who comes from a wealthy-political family. Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) heads a political  committee looking for a 'young, fresh face' to go up against the present  Senator of California, Croker Jarmon (an old And experienced war-horse).  Lucas believes that McKaye has the potential to upset the Senator in the  next elections. Though McKaye he hates the political arena (one of the  reasons he drifted from his father, who was once governor), Lucas convinces  him, telling him that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Setting up a McKaye committee, Lucas sets out to shape McKaye into a  political weapon. His rise (though not meteoric) is nonetheless slowly felt  in the polls. Becoming a surprising contender, he thinks about quitting  (scared at the thought of winning). Nevertheless, Lucas tells him its too  late, since the finish line is close. With the campaign taking a toll on  his homelife, his decision is a difficult one.Critique:  Serio-documentary, The Candidate is one of those films that should be shown  to students seeking a political career. Its precise depiction of a normal  person into a beauracratic tool is almost too real. Director Michael Ritche  recreates the sometimes absurd, complicated and superficial world of  political inner workings to perfection. Robert Redford is also perfect as a  'wholesome', nave underdog champion (you can almost feel a JFK-esque aura  around him). The film's wonderful parades and interviews further reinforce  the sense of a documentary. An excellently written, 'illuminating'  experience.QUOTE: Pete: &quot;I saw something up there tonight.

Republican candidates, in particular, are all lined up desperately trying to see who gets the chance to unseat Obama in the general presidential election. There seem  to be about a dozen of them and nobody seems capable of grabbing and holding the frontrunner spot, at least not for long. It's push and shove, he said, she said, charge and countercharge, emerging scandals, and momentary surges. How are they ever going to get this mess straightened out?All elections seem quite different, yet they all seem very much the same. If you want a good inside look at a fictitious 70s election for the Senate Seat from California, ""The Candidate"" starring Robert Redford presents an interesting and insightful view. Redford is a handsome JFK-type of candidate, at least visually, and he's up against a stale and stogy deeply-entrenched Republican who is the strong frontrunner. The incumbent has all the advantages. The movie follows the challenger. Well, it's committee meetings, insiders, important people, people who think they're important, fund raising, rallies, election managers endless banquets, speeches, newspaper reporters, TV appearances, to and fro travel at the last minute, clashes of egos, and differences in agendas. Let's see have I forgotten anything? Undoubtedly! The whole thing is just such a melange of overlapping activities that you're left baffled and wondering if anyone is ever going to get anything straightened out and accomplished. Well, something seems to be happening, at last. The Redford challenger seems to be somehow rising in the polls and the incumbent is gradually faltering. Will it be enough? It there enough time left? Will either have a last minute surge? Stay tuned for the exciting photo finish!Personally, I didn't particularly care for the movie.

Designed to serve as a primer for liberal political candidates, The Candidate tells the story of Bill McKay (Robert Redford), a young activist lawyer who is recruited by a slightly sleazy campaign manager (Peter Boyle) to run for the U.S. Senate against a conservative Republican incumbent (Don Porter, better known as Gidget's Dad).  After overcoming his initial hesitations, McKay becomes a committed candidate and finds himself losing his identity in the process.  Written by a former speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy, the film serves as a strongly realistic look at the state of modern political campaigning and, in typical '70s manner, is surprisingly downbeat.  Redford gives one of his better performances, actually allowing himself to portray a character that some viewers may be surprised to discover they have ambigous feelings towards.  His performance in this film (and other films from this period) stands in sharp contrast to the golden boys he's been concentrating on for the last few decades.  Amongst the supporting cast, strong turns are given by Boyle and Melvyn Douglas as Redford's father -- a former Governor.  Don Porter, on the other hand, is a tad obvious as the Republican Senator.  While its reasonable to assume that Porter's buffoon is the way Hollywood liberals like Ritchie and Redford realistically view conservative Republicans, it hard to take such an obvious clown seriously as an opponent and, unfortunately, this detracts from the overall effectiveness of the film.  Ritchie later said he regretted not exploring more of McKay's family life and, with the exception of the scenes between McKay and his father, the film does, at times, come across as a bit cold and unemotional.  McKay's wife is barely a presence in the film and one never really knows how she feels about his campaign.Still, its a frequently funny, always fascinating, realistic look at how we elect our government and, in many ways, it was a prophetic film.  1974 would see a huge slew of liberals in the Bill McKay model elected to the U.S. Senate and the character of McKay was supposedly modeled on two of the more succesful California Democrats of the '70s -- Sen. John Tunney and Gov. Jerry Brown.  After watching this film, one can't help but wonder what lay ahead for McKay -- as he himself asked, &quot;What now?&quot;  Would he be able to survive the sudden drastic turn in the nation's political sentiments just eight years later or would he find himself swept away like Tunney and Brown?",4,Engrossing if flawed,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,2628,"['late', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'was', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'director', '1972', 'Candidate', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'Designed', 'serve', 'primer', 'liberal', 'political', 'candidates', 'Candidate', 'story', 'Bill', 'McKay', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'young', 'activist', 'lawyer', 'who', 'recruited', 'slightly', 'sleazy', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'run', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'incumbent', 'Don', 'Porter', 'better', 'known', 'Gidget', 'Dad', 'overcoming', 'initial', 'hesitations', 'McKay', 'committed', 'candidate', 'losing', 'identity', 'process', 'Written', 'former', 'speechwriter', 'Eugene', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'strongly', 'realistic', 'look', 'state', 'modern', 'political', 'campaigning', 'typical', ""'70s"", 'manner', 'surprisingly', 'downbeat', 'Redford', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'actually', 'allowing', 'portray', 'character', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'discover', 'have', 'ambigous', 'feelings', 'towards', 'performance', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'golden', 'been', 'concentrating', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'Amongst', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong', 'turns', 'are', 'given', 'Boyle', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Redford', 'father', 'former', 'Governor', 'Don', 'Porter', 'other', 'hand', 'tad', 'obvious', 'Republican', 'Senator', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'Porter', 'buffoon', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'liberals', 'Ritchie', 'Redford', 'realistically', 'view', 'conservative', 'Republicans', 'hard', 'take', 'such', 'obvious', 'clown', 'seriously', 'opponent', 'unfortunately', 'overall', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'Ritchie', 'later', 'said', 'regretted', 'not', 'exploring', 'more', 'McKay', 'family', 'life', 'exception', 'scenes', 'McKay', 'father', 'film', 'times', 'come', 'bit', 'cold', 'unemotional', 'McKay', 'wife', 'barely', 'presence', 'film', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'how', 'campaign.Still', 'frequently', 'funny', 'always', 'fascinating', 'realistic', 'look', 'how', 'elect', 'government', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'prophetic', 'film', '1974', 'would', 'see', 'huge', 'slew', 'liberals', 'Bill', 'McKay', 'model', 'elected', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'character', 'McKay', 'was', 'supposedly', 'modeled', 'two', 'more', 'succesful', 'California', 'Democrats', ""'70s"", 'Sen.', 'John', 'Tunney', 'Gov', 'Jerry', 'Brown', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'lay', 'ahead', 'McKay', 'asked', 'quot', 'What', 'now', 'quot', 'Would', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'sudden', 'drastic', 'turn', 'nation', 'political', 'sentiments', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'find', 'swept', 'away', 'Tunney', 'Brown']",N/A

Robert Redford plays the liberal idealist (one of his easier roles to fit into). He is the son of a former governor.The movie brought back memories of Jerry Brown (aka ""governor moonbeam""). Jerry Brown was the son of former CA Governor Pat Brown. He served two terms as California Governor starting in 1975. His quirky liberal idealism more or less prevented him from attaining national office as either a U.S. Senator or U.S. President. Brown did a pretty good job as governor. He was fiscally responsible and did not run the state into the ground. His Supreme Court appointments alienated him with the voters (the Chief Justice and two other justices were recalled by the voters, including yours truly, because they would not enforce the death penalty).If you have a cynical view of national politics, this movie will not dissuade you! It kind of reminds me of our corrupt judicial process (we have the best legal system that money can buy).

Bernabo,"[5, 5]","I do not have to tell anyone that the look behind the scenes at the fictional California senate race in the 1972 film ""The Candidate"" remains realistic and relevant today.  The sophistication employed by candidates and their supporters in putting together campaign ads has certainly become progressively slicker and sicker, but what we see in Michael Ritchie's drama is essentially what we still get today.  The tagline for ""The Candidate"" was: ""Nothing matters more than winning. Not even what you believe in,"" a sentiment that is certainly true today, Election Day 2004.  Both of the candidates, George W. Bush and John F. Kerry, were nominated by their parties because of the perception that they could win the election.  Bush had been re-elected governor of Texas, so he had the requisite weight to going up against Al Gore.  Kerry had served in Vietnam, so he would be able to talk about national security.  Neither man has ever been accused of being a visionary leader in the mold of John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan.Since Robert Redford is in the title role he certainly has the requisite charisma to be that sort of candidate.  He is Bill McKay, the son of a former governor, John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas), and he has been working as a lawyer and trying to get away from daddy's shadow.  McKay is talked into being essentially the sacrificial lamb against the incumbent, conservative Senator Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter), because it will be a way of publicizing the issues he cares about.  Since he is going to lose big-time, the handsome and articulate McKay is given permission to go out and (horrors) say whatever he really wants.  The problem is that his ideas are starting to resonate with the electorate and he is starting to gain in the polls, at which point he starts getting handles by Democratic operative Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), who knows how to play hardball.  Lucas brings in a ""media specialist,"" Allen Garfield (Howard Klein), who knows how to package a candidate so that it is all about image over substance.  After all, now that he can actually win, young McKay has to pay attention to what he actually says.Like ""Network,"" this film is something of a satire, but it keeps things pretty realistic and avoids plunging into black comedy.  The closest ""The Candidate"" comes to the edge is in my favorite scenes, which is when Robert Redford's character is in the back of his limo getting a bit silly with his campaign spiel: ""Can't any longer play off black against old, young against poor. This country cannot house its houseless, feed its foodless.""  Then he ends up making weird noises and doing a Nixon impersonation.  There is, of course, an authenticity to this unguarded moment that goes way beyond the well-scripted public performances of the political candidate.It has been three decades and ""The Candidate"" is still at the top of my list for cinematic representations of the seedy side of politics, assuming, for the sake of argument, that those terms are not redundant.  You really do believe that McKay wants to do and say the right thing, and his compromises are reluctant.  When he makes the necessary deal with a labor leader (Kevin Tobey) to get votes in return for favors, we know that McKay is aware that he has just sold his soul and that he is not at all convinced the exchanged is going to be worth the trade.The film was scripted by Jeremy Larner, who I understand was a former speech writer for Eugene McCarthy, which explains why it has a sense of authenticity above and beyond what we usually get in such movies.  Larner ends ""The Candidate"" with a true note of horror, as the winning candidate asks, almost helplessly, ""What do we do now?""

Redford's good looks and charisma afford him the luxury of a somewhat stubborn disposition and have allowed him to champion causes that interest him such as environmentalism.  ""The Candidate"" is the product of Redford's interests.  It turns 40 next year and hold up well on DVD.As Bill McKay, Redford plays a lawyer who works for environmental causes.  His performance is a strong one as we see the strains on his marriage, his desire to speak the truth even when not politically expedient, and some utter silliness as when he has private moments in a car or gets the giggles while trying to tape a TV spot.Peter Boyle who became a major screen presence due to 1970s ""Joe,"" plays Marvin Lucas, the political strategist who thinks McKay has potential and drafts him into the race, fully expecting him to lose.  Boyle is magnificent as we see the calculated wheeler-dealer politico who also has the soft skills of handling a nervous candidate, who we come to believe he really likes.Melvyn Douglas plays John J. McKay, the former governor who is a seasoned politician.  Douglas had won one Oscar before this film, ""Hud"" in 1964, and won another supporting actor Oscar afterwards in 1979 for ""Being There.""  He does a great job as the wise but worldly father who comes and supports his son.Don Porter who may be best remembered as Gidget's TV dad plays Don Porter, a traditional law & order Republican who knows all the angles.  The scene where his helicopter swoops down near a Malibu forest fire and steals the limelight from Bill McKay is a study in one-upsmanship.Michael Ritchie had previously directed ""Downhill Racer"" with Robert Redford.  That film was considered the first and ""The Candidate"" the second in a proposed trilogy of films concerned with the theme of winning.  Allen Garfield plays the sleazy ad man Klein.  Karen Carlson does a nice job as Bill's wife Nancy, for whom being in the spotlight takes as much getting used to as it does for her husband.As the film concludes, we get the sense of a political process that seems out of control, propelled by superficialities, where candidates are sold like underarm deodorants.  The many crazy scenes where people jabber over each other without listening is fragmenting and disorienting.  Jeremy Larner who had been a speech writer for Eugene McCarthy won an Oscar for Best Screenplay as well as the Writers Guild award for his work.

Though done in the early 1970's, the movie has avoided obsolescence-unfortunately.A campaign manager has just come off a losing election in California, and takes on the task of managing the campaign of a challenger to a Congressional seat who is also expected to lose, as the incumbent is supposedly safe in his seat.  He has Bill McKay, the liberal son of the machine politician former governor of California, take the role of the challenger, and McKay is told to go ahead and say what he wants because it won't matter anyway.But unexpectedly, the incumbent's position turns out to be not so strong.  The story isn't clear as to why; usually an incumbent loses their position by offending their constituency or changing demographics in their district, but that isn't indicated.  Now McKay has a real chance to win-but not enough voters would want a strong liberal.  So the manager coaches McKay to be more vague and avoid answering questions in a way that might alienate potential voters...in fact give cliched responses even the campaign staff laugh at.  McKay does so, being vague in his responses to questions, and basically giving generalized platitudes in his speeches, without being specific about what he intends to do.The movie is timeless in the sense that there have been plenty of politicians who have made it to office without really saying what they would do once they got in, basically telling the voters to take them on faith.

Travers,"[18, 22]","Robert Redford was behind the entertaining political movie ""The Candidate"" (1972), which goes a long way towards explaining how the game works. This film is really not a liberal one, which is what makes it worthwhile even after 30 years. It is supposed to be based on Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown, former California Governor Pat Brown's son. Jerry Brown at the time was a youthful Secretary of State who would go one to two terms as Governor. He was a new kind of pol, attractive, a bit of swinger who dated rock star Linda Rohnstadt, and representative of the Golden State image of the 1970s. They called him ""Governor Moonbeam"".Redford plays the son of the former Governor of California, played by Melvyn Douglas. The old man is old school all the way, having schmoozed his way up the slippery slope through implied corrupt deals with labor unions and other Democrat special interests. Redford is a young man who played football at Stanford and is now a social issues lawyer of the pro bono variety, helping Mexicans in Central California. Peter Boyle knew him at Stanford and is now a Democrat political consultant who recruits Redford to run for Senator against Crocker Jarman, an entrenched conservative Orange County Republican. Jarman could be Reagan, but he is as much a composite of the traditional Republican: Strong on defense, down on affirmative action and welfare, a real ""up by the bootstraps"" guy who emerged from the Depression and World War II to make up our ""greatest generation.""The film does an about-face on perceptions that, in many cases, turn out to be true. Redford is the rich kid with connections. Jarman beat the Depression like the rest of the U.S., without a social worker.""How did we do it?"" he mocks.Redford's film wife is played by Karen Carlson, pure eye candy (but what happened to her career I cannot say?). She has ambitions of her own, and pushes him to do it because he has the ""power,"" an undefined sexual charisma of the JFK variety. Redford plays a caricature of himself, handsome but considered an empty suit. His deal is he can say any outrageous thing because he cannot win anyway, and in so doing shows he has the brains.

405759,A1QWEUEM90LL9D,6304176570,"Steven Travers ""AUTHOR/WRITER""","[5, 5]","Robert Redford was behind the entertaining political movie ""The Candidate"" (1972), which goes a long way towards explaining how the game works. This film is really not a liberal one, which is what makes it worthwhile even after 30 years. It is supposed to be based on Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown, former California Governor Pat Brown's son. Jerry Brown at the time was a youthful Secretary of State who would go one to two terms as Governor. He was a new kind of pol, attractive, a bit of swinger who dated rock star Linda Rohnstadt, and representative of the Golden State image of the 1970s. They called him ""Governor Moonbeam"".Redford plays the son of the former Governor of California, played by Melvyn Douglas. The old man is old school all the way, having schmoozed his way up the slippery slope through implied corrupt deals with labor unions and other Democrat special interests. Redford is a young man who played football at Stanford and is now a social issues lawyer of the pro bono variety, helping Mexicans in Central California. Peter Boyle knew him at Stanford and is now a Democrat political consultant who recruits Redford to run for Senator against Crocker Jarman, an entrenched conservative Orange County Republican. Jarman could be Reagan, but he is as much a composite of the traditional Republican: Strong on defense, down on affirmative action and welfare, a real ""up by the bootstraps"" guy who emerged from the Depression and World War II to make up our ""greatest generation.""The film does an about-face on perceptions that, in many cases, turn out to be true. Redford is the rich kid with connections. Jarman beat the Depression like the rest of the U.S., without a social worker.""How did we do it?"" he mocks.Redford's film wife is played by Karen Carlson, pure eye candy (but what happened to her career I cannot say?). She has ambitions of her own, and pushes him to do it because he has the ""power,"" an undefined sexual charisma of the JFK variety. Redford plays a caricature of himself, handsome but considered an empty suit. His deal is he can say any outrageous thing because he cannot win anyway, and in so doing shows he has the brains. When he creeps up in the polls, the idealism gives way to standard politicking, complete with deals with his old man's crooked labor buddies. He wins, demonstrating the power of looks and TV advertising. In the end he expresses that he is not prepared for the task.",5,EXCELLENT POLITICAL FLICK,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2426,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'entertaining', 'political', 'movie', 'Candidate', '1972', 'long', 'way', 'towards', 'explaining', 'how', 'game', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'liberal', 'one', 'what', 'even', '30', 'years', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Edmund', 'Jerry', 'Brown', 'former', 'California', 'Governor', 'Pat', 'Brown', 'son', 'Jerry', 'Brown', 'time', 'was', 'youthful', 'Secretary', 'State', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'terms', 'Governor', 'was', 'new', 'kind', 'pol', 'attractive', 'bit', 'swinger', 'who', 'dated', 'rock', 'star', 'Linda', 'Rohnstadt', 'representative', 'Golden', 'State', 'image', '1970s', 'called', 'Governor', 'Moonbeam', '.Redford', 'son', 'former', 'Governor', 'California', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'old', 'man', 'old', 'school', 'way', 'having', 'schmoozed', 'way', 'slippery', 'slope', 'implied', 'corrupt', 'deals', 'labor', 'unions', 'other', 'Democrat', 'special', 'interests', 'Redford', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'football', 'Stanford', 'now', 'social', 'issues', 'lawyer', 'pro', 'bono', 'variety', 'helping', 'Mexicans', 'Central', 'California', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'knew', 'Stanford', 'now', 'Democrat', 'political', 'consultant', 'who', 'Redford', 'run', 'Senator', 'Crocker', 'Jarman', 'entrenched', 'conservative', 'Orange', 'County', 'Republican', 'Jarman', 'could', 'be', 'Reagan', 'as', 'much', 'composite', 'traditional', 'Republican', 'Strong', 'defense', 'down', 'affirmative', 'action', 'welfare', 'real', 'up', 'bootstraps', 'guy', 'who', 'emerged', 'Depression', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'make', 'up', 'greatest', 'generation', 'film', 'about-face', 'perceptions', 'many', 'cases', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'Redford', 'rich', 'kid', 'connections', 'Jarman', 'beat', 'Depression', 'rest', 'U.S.', 'social', 'worker', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'mocks.Redford', 'film', 'wife', 'played', 'Karen', 'Carlson', 'pure', 'eye', 'candy', 'what', 'happened', 'career', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'ambitions', 'own', 'do', 'power', 'undefined', 'sexual', 'charisma', 'JFK', 'variety', 'Redford', 'caricature', 'handsome', 'considered', 'empty', 'suit', 'deal', 'can', 'say', 'outrageous', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'win', 'anyway', 'so', 'doing', 'shows', 'brains', 'When', 'up', 'polls', 'idealism', 'way', 'standard', 'politicking', 'complete', 'deals', 'old', 'man', 'crooked', 'labor', 'buddies', 'demonstrating', 'power', 'looks', 'TV', 'advertising', 'end', 'not', 'prepared', 'task']",N/A
405760,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6304176570,William Hare,"[42, 45]","&quot;The Candidate&quot; was released in the appropriate year of 1972, when Richard Nixon was reelected, using the media to present himself as a solid, trusted leader who was being challenged by liberal elitists operating in concert with the Eastern media establishment.  When the full force of Watergate buried Nixon in scandal shortly thereafter, resulting in his resignation in 1974, the messages presented in &quot;The Candidate&quot; became all the clearer as Nixon's hollow facade lay fully exposed.Jeremy Larner, a former speechwriter for presidential candidate Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968, used his political savvy to craft a script based on the realism of campaigning in the television age, in which, to use Marshall McLuhan's apt phrase, &quot;the medium is the message.&quot;  Larner copped a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for his effort.  Robert Redford plays Bill McKay, who runs a poverty law center and has no ambitions to seek political office.  He is urged to do so as the Democrats in California seek an opponent for a solidly entrenched incumbent U.S. Senator played by Don Porter.  Redford, whose father, played by Melvyn Douglas, is a former California governor, agrees to run after being told that he can address topics on his own terms.  The idea is that he is expected to make a decent run but is not expected to win.  Redford articulates ideas near and dear to him that are not embraced by the broad spectrum of California voters.  When he runs poorly in the primary, however, he is informed that he needs to make changes or risk being humiliated in the general election by Porter, a prospect he does not relish.Redford's ensuing frequent turnabouts on major issues make him anything but the refreshingly candid candidate he sought to become.  As the polls close and there is possible light at the end of the long campaign tunnel, Redford becomes more of a blurry media creation and loses the old image of refreshingly solid commitment he had previously displayed.Eventually Redford upsets Porter.  By the time the long race ends he is immersed in a total blur.  The film's closing line is a gem.  After winning the race Redford, seated in his hotel room with his campaign staff, asks, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;&quot;The Candidate&quot; was one of director Michael Ritchie's finest efforts.  The pacing becomes gradually stepped up as the campaign moves into its important stretch run.  By the end the viewer is immersed in the same kind of non-stop, frenzied blur as are the candidates and their staffs, providing a graphic display of political realism via the camera's all-seeing eye.",5,Political Realism Presented Entertainingly,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,2622,"['quot', 'Candidate', 'quot', 'was', 'released', 'appropriate', 'year', '1972', 'when', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'was', 'reelected', 'using', 'media', 'present', 'solid', 'trusted', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'challenged', 'liberal', 'elitists', 'operating', 'concert', 'Eastern', 'media', 'establishment', 'When', 'full', 'force', 'Watergate', 'buried', 'Nixon', 'scandal', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'resulting', 'resignation', '1974', 'messages', 'presented', 'quot', 'Candidate', 'quot', 'became', 'clearer', 'Nixon', 'hollow', 'facade', 'lay', 'fully', 'exposed.Jeremy', 'Larner', 'former', 'speechwriter', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Senator', 'Eugene', 'McCarthy', '1968', 'used', 'political', 'savvy', 'craft', 'script', 'based', 'realism', 'campaigning', 'television', 'age', 'use', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'apt', 'phrase', 'quot', 'medium', 'message.', 'quot', 'Larner', 'copped', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'effort', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Bill', 'McKay', 'who', 'poverty', 'law', 'center', 'ambitions', 'seek', 'political', 'office', 'urged', 'do', 'so', 'Democrats', 'California', 'seek', 'opponent', 'solidly', 'entrenched', 'incumbent', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'played', 'Don', 'Porter', 'Redford', 'father', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'former', 'California', 'governor', 'run', 'being', 'told', 'can', 'address', 'topics', 'own', 'terms', 'idea', 'expected', 'make', 'decent', 'run', 'not', 'expected', 'win', 'Redford', 'ideas', 'dear', 'are', 'not', 'embraced', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'California', 'voters', 'When', 'poorly', 'primary', 'however', 'informed', 'make', 'changes', 'risk', 'being', 'humiliated', 'general', 'election', 'Porter', 'prospect', 'not', 'relish.Redford', 'ensuing', 'frequent', 'turnabouts', 'major', 'issues', 'make', 'anything', 'refreshingly', 'candid', 'candidate', 'sought', 'become', 'polls', 'close', 'possible', 'light', 'end', 'long', 'campaign', 'tunnel', 'Redford', 'more', 'blurry', 'media', 'creation', 'old', 'image', 'refreshingly', 'solid', 'commitment', 'had', 'previously', 'displayed.Eventually', 'Redford', 'Porter', 'time', 'long', 'race', 'immersed', 'total', 'blur', 'film', 'closing', 'line', 'gem', 'winning', 'race', 'Redford', 'seated', 'hotel', 'room', 'campaign', 'staff', 'quot', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'quot', 'quot', 'Candidate', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'director', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'finest', 'efforts', 'pacing', 'becomes', 'gradually', 'stepped', 'up', 'campaign', 'important', 'stretch', 'run', 'end', 'viewer', 'immersed', 'same', 'kind', 'non-stop', 'frenzied', 'blur', 'are', 'candidates', 'staffs', 'providing', 'graphic', 'display', 'political', 'realism', 'camera', 'all-seeing', 'eye']",N/A
