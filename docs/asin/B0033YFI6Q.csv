1320504,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B0033YFI6Q,Daddy,"[3, 4]","This is the true story of the 1966 event at University of Texas campus in Austin, Texas, where Charles Whitman, a former Marine, goes crazy and holds up in a campus tower with a high-powered rifle for a shooting spree.  The movie begins with Whitman preparing his killing spree by killing his wife and his mother (to spare them the pain of what he's about to do). Kurt Russell potrays Charles Whitman with an intense and superb performance. Richard Yniguez plays Ramiro Martinez, a young rookie cop who becomes the hero of the day. The movie is gritty and realistic, it really pulls you into the story. It's scary and suspenseful, partly because it's a true story, but mostly because of the intense performances by both Russell (one of his best performances) and Yniguez. Despite it being a bit dated, Deadly Tower is just as powerful as any similar genre movie made today.",5,A classic suspense/thriller... and true,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,873,"['true', 'story', '1966', 'event', 'University', 'Texas', 'campus', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'where', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'former', 'Marine', 'crazy', 'up', 'campus', 'tower', 'high-powered', 'rifle', 'shooting', 'spree', 'movie', 'Whitman', 'preparing', 'killing', 'spree', 'killing', 'wife', 'mother', 'spare', 'pain', 'what', 'do', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'intense', 'superb', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Yniguez', 'Ramiro', 'Martinez', 'young', 'rookie', 'cop', 'who', 'hero', 'day', 'movie', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'really', 'story', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'partly', 'true', 'story', 'mostly', 'intense', 'performances', 'Russell', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Yniguez', 'being', 'bit', 'dated', 'Deadly', 'Tower', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'similar', 'genre', 'movie', 'made', 'today']",N/A

Could've been a little better but it was made in the 1970s.  They said the real Charles Whitman only scored Marksman in the USMC but the dude was spot on in 97% of his shots during the actual events.  Even managed to shoot 2 people dead when they peeped out from in between two columns that were a mere 7 inches or so from each other.  One shot, one kill each time someone poked their head thru the columns.  Those columns were also 500 feet from the base of the tower.  I say he probably scored Expert his entire time in the Marines, but during his last qualifiaction he didnt care for the Expert rating because he was getting out.  If one of the USMCs worst rifleman can do this, imagine what one with an Expert rating can do.  The story tells of how Charles Whitman went crazy and killed his mother and wife at home.  Then went to the University Tower and started shooting his fellow students.  The experts who later examined his brain at Whitmans request said he had a brain tumor and was most likely what caused him to go insane out of nowhere.",3,Shows what a Motivated Marine and his rifle can do.,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,1165,"['Pretty', 'straight', 'point', 'story', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'infamous', 'University', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'Tower', 'Sniper', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'better', 'was', 'made', '1970s', 'said', 'real', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'only', 'scored', 'Marksman', 'USMC', 'dude', 'was', 'spot', '97', '%', 'shots', 'actual', 'events', 'Even', 'managed', 'shoot', '2', 'people', 'dead', 'when', 'peeped', 'out', 'two', 'columns', 'were', 'mere', '7', 'inches', 'so', 'other', 'One', 'shot', 'one', 'kill', 'time', 'someone', 'poked', 'head', 'columns', 'columns', 'were', 'also', '500', 'feet', 'base', 'tower', 'say', 'probably', 'scored', 'Expert', 'entire', 'time', 'Marines', 'last', 'qualifiaction', 'care', 'Expert', 'rating', 'was', 'getting', 'out', 'one', 'USMCs', 'worst', 'rifleman', 'can', 'do', 'imagine', 'what', 'one', 'Expert', 'rating', 'can', 'do', 'story', 'tells', 'how', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'went', 'crazy', 'killed', 'mother', 'wife', 'home', 'Then', 'went', 'University', 'Tower', 'started', 'shooting', 'fellow', 'students', 'experts', 'who', 'later', 'examined', 'brain', 'Whitmans', 'request', 'said', 'had', 'brain', 'tumor', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'what', 'caused', 'go', 'insane', 'nowhere']",N/A
