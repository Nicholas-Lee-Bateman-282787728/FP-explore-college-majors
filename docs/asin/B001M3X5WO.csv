I am from California and I am a huge Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai fan. They both look super hot in this movie! The style is modern and sexy, the music is awesome, the musical numbers are fantastic. I would recommend this movie for someone who likes actions movies and comedy at the same time. But if you're one of those people who are too serious then don't get it.I buy all of my bollywood films from PlanetBollywood and so far every dvd I have gotten has been to or above my standards.
