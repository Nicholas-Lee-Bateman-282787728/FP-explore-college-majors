1695693,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00J5LXSOA,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[22, 23]","And in the powerful and accomplished second season of Netflix's HOUSE OF CARDS (USA version), Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), having doubled down and won every chance he gets, consolidates power along with his NGO-controlling wife Claire (Robin Wright).  Francis, or Frank (""It's 'Francis' on buildings and 'Frank' on bumper stickers,"" he is joshed during Season 1) grows in finesse and power but as always has his eyes on the next prize.  Some colorful new characters join the cast, among them Gerald (""Major Dad"") McRaney as Raymond Tusk, a ""sage"" but manipulative multibillionaire from a Midwestern city, and Jimmi Simpson (""Liam McPoyle"" on IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA) as Gavin Orsay, a quirky but ultra-advanced hacker in uneasy alliance with the FBI.  The growing but, sadly, all-too-believable sense of menace from big power, big bucks, and domestic covert ops is lightened somewhat by Gavin's companion, a charming guinea pig named Cashew.  (Note well, though, that cavy owners maintain the critters should not be kept in such confining cages.)  Then Cashew comes under the foot of the Feds.I didn't think it possible for Season 2 to outdo Season 1, but it does.  Probably owing to enhanced budgeting, interior decor suffers far less from the sterile monotony often visible in the prior year, that sense of first-class hotel furniture accented with Restoration Hardware fixtures.  Sometimes the fictional political events swirling around this show's main characters seem a little too strong for the circumstances--Frank's boss the President has an eighteen percent approval rating while the lowest numbers a real modern President have pulled were in the twenties, the week before Richard Nixon resigned in 1974--but it is as a character-driven saga that HOUSE OF CARDS excels.  Francis Underwood's wry asides to the camera maintain that tone of impishness so necessary for our sympathy toward a very ruthless character.  Robin Wright, that vessel of ambition as the Vice President's wife with an agenda of her own, gets more of a chance to act.  Be sure, though, to see all of Season 1 before embarking on Season 2--both are well worth the effort but should be seen in sequence.  After that, no Cook's tour of modern Machiavellianism would be complete without the remastered British trilogy that started it all.House of Cards Trilogy:  The Original UK Series Remastered",5,Washington's chief political gambler keeps his cards close to the chest,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,2386,"['powerful', 'accomplished', 'second', 'season', 'Netflix', 'HOUSE', 'CARDS', 'USA', 'version', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'having', 'doubled', 'down', 'won', 'chance', 'power', 'NGO-controlling', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Francis', 'Frank', 'buildings', ""'Frank"", 'bumper', 'stickers', 'joshed', 'Season', '1', 'grows', 'finesse', 'power', 'always', 'eyes', 'next', 'prize', 'colorful', 'new', 'characters', 'join', 'cast', 'Gerald', 'Major', 'Dad', 'McRaney', 'Raymond', 'Tusk', 'sage', 'manipulative', 'multibillionaire', 'Midwestern', 'city', 'Jimmi', 'Simpson', 'Liam', 'McPoyle', 'IT', 'ALWAYS', 'SUNNY', 'IN', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'Gavin', 'Orsay', 'quirky', 'ultra-advanced', 'hacker', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'FBI', 'growing', 'sadly', 'all-too-believable', 'sense', 'menace', 'big', 'power', 'big', 'bucks', 'domestic', 'covert', 'ops', 'lightened', 'somewhat', 'Gavin', 'companion', 'charming', 'guinea', 'pig', 'named', 'Cashew', 'Note', 'well', 'though', 'cavy', 'owners', 'maintain', 'critters', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'kept', 'such', 'confining', 'cages', 'Then', 'Cashew', 'foot', 'Feds.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'Season', '2', 'outdo', 'Season', '1', 'Probably', 'owing', 'enhanced', 'budgeting', 'interior', 'decor', 'suffers', 'far', 'less', 'sterile', 'monotony', 'often', 'visible', 'prior', 'year', 'sense', 'first-class', 'hotel', 'furniture', 'accented', 'Restoration', 'Hardware', 'Sometimes', 'fictional', 'political', 'events', 'swirling', 'show', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'strong', 'circumstances', 'Frank', 'President', 'eighteen', 'percent', 'approval', 'rating', 'lowest', 'numbers', 'real', 'modern', 'President', 'have', 'pulled', 'were', 'twenties', 'week', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'resigned', '1974', 'character-driven', 'saga', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'CARDS', 'excels', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'wry', 'camera', 'maintain', 'tone', 'impishness', 'so', 'necessary', 'sympathy', 'very', 'ruthless', 'character', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'vessel', 'ambition', 'Vice', 'President', 'wife', 'agenda', 'own', 'more', 'chance', 'act', 'Be', 'sure', 'though', 'see', 'Season', '1', 'embarking', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'well', 'effort', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'sequence', 'Cook', 'tour', 'modern', 'Machiavellianism', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'remastered', 'British', 'trilogy', 'started', 'Cards', 'Trilogy', 'Original', 'UK', 'Series', 'Remastered']",N/A

To some viewers too much darkness can push a show over the edge.  I think it did that to my husband and my neighbor, who now seem dubious about seeing season 3.  I, however, absolutely loved it. Keven Spacey's Francis Underwood is even more rapacious than in season one. He also is on a no holds barred effort to become the next president. Even Claire, his wife, has a few moments of doubt but not Francis. Kevin Spacey also takes this right up to the edge of satire but does not push it over.  It is close especially since he has frequent asides to us the audience. Both Spacey and Robin Wright Penn do an outstanding acting job as the ultimate political couple. Both Claire and Francis go the extra mile this season in eliminating anyone standing in their way to the White House. The guy they seek to topple as President is a much better person than either of them but he is terribly weak as a President.

Casey,"[5, 6]","Watching the unprincipled and incredibly devious Frank Underwood rise from House Whip to President of the United States is certainly entertaining and the acting is first rate. Viewers need to suspend their disbelief in order to fully accept the incomprehensible stupidity of the dupes along the way who are brushed aside and the lack of push-back from any of the multitudes of &#34;interest groups&#34; that have their own amoral and heavily funded objectives.  Elected at the cost of billions of dollars and surrounded by armies of political operatives and bureaucrats dependent upon the President, it is difficult to conceive of any way that any personal deceptions could so quickly seize the Oval Office and overthrow a presidency.  It may be good theater to watch this play out as the work of a slick mastermind and his even more deceptive wife, but the breakdowns in presidential power we have seen -- Nixon-Agnew-Ford -- and the Clinton scandal -- were far from &#34;neat&#34;.  They were messy and painful to watch and unfolded over several years.  The Bush-Cheney seizure of power in 2000 and the orchestrated Iraq War ended up with thousands of dead and tens of billions earned by War profiteers like Cheney's Halliburton.  That is a reality far darker than the murder of a congressperson and reporter.It is also difficult to believe that simple deals over a table could bring cuts to Social Security eligibility age without massive firestorms of protest and with no mention of the hundreds of billions of dollars escaping taxation through machinations of dozens of vastly wealthy individuals who shelter vast fortunes in the Cayman Islands and in Swiss banks.  Raymond Tusk may be a realistic character, but there are obviously dozens of such corruptors buying and selling influence in Washington, D.C.. Its hard to imagine one or two such rats obtaining such unrivaled power with so many sharks in the water.  And there are obviously many Frank Underwoods in Washington, D.C. who crave power.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, they feed off each other and the taxpayers in general.  What House of Cards offers is the fiction that such evil can be contained and orchestrated by one clever mastermind.  Perhaps that is a comforting fiction when evil in our political system appears to be overwhelming.",3,"Good entertainment --- Oddly, it isn't quite dark enough.
