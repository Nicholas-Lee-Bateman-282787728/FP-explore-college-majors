I had to choose Murray as the next favorite wiggle in line since Greg left.One of my favorite parts in this movie is seeing Jeff and Anthony taking turns pretending to be 4 different animals.  I also like learning a few new songs that I've never heard of, before.One of them is called ""Monkey Man"", I think it's from The Wiggles Go Bananas.",5,EXTRA BIG NEW CONCERT MOVIE!,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,429,"['new', 'concert', 'movie', 'Greg', 'replacement', 'love', 'Murray', 'sake', 'had', 'choose', 'Murray', 'next', 'favorite', 'wiggle', 'line', 'Greg', 'left.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Jeff', 'Anthony', 'taking', 'turns', 'pretending', 'be', '4', 'different', 'animals', 'also', 'learning', 'few', 'new', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'before.One', 'called', 'Monkey', 'Man', 'think', 'Wiggles', 'Go', 'Bananas']","The Wiggles: Big, Big Show!"

This dvd is great, my three boys and I all enjoyed it. My hubby says I love the wiggles as much as my kids:) It's full of old favorites and some of the newer songs as well. Lots of wiggle dancers and captain feather sword, along with all the others. Only thing I did not like was the camera that seemed miles away from the stage. There were to many scenes with that camera to me. Anthony is still in terrific shape and does a great job, Sams singing is as good as ever and of course Jeff is still falling asleep, and Murry is still playing his guitar. If you like the wiggles this will be a wonderful addition, if this is your first dvd of the wiggles then it's a good place to start:}",5,We love the wiggles,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,782,"['are', 'wiggles', 'fans', 'own', 'many', 'dvd', 'have', 'attended', 'live', 'show', 'great', 'BTW', 'dvd', 'great', 'three', 'boys', 'enjoyed', 'hubby', 'love', 'wiggles', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'full', 'old', 'favorites', 'newer', 'songs', 'well', 'Lots', 'wiggle', 'dancers', 'captain', 'feather', 'sword', 'others', 'Only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'camera', 'seemed', 'miles', 'away', 'stage', 'were', 'many', 'scenes', 'camera', 'Anthony', 'still', 'terrific', 'shape', 'great', 'job', 'Sams', 'singing', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'course', 'Jeff', 'still', 'falling', 'asleep', 'Murry', 'still', 'playing', 'guitar', 'like', 'wiggles', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'first', 'dvd', 'wiggles', 'then', 'good', 'place', 'start']","The Wiggles: Big, Big Show!"

The more I watch him the more I sense he was treating it as a job and deep down inside there's a part of him that was perhaps bored with it all. He was originally hired to be a dancer/pirate/what ever, stood out with his lovely operatic voice he doesn't use enough, and became Greg's understudy about the time his health problems got worse. He might have got the permanent roll because he knew the songs and could fit the shirt. Sam's chemistry never fully gelled with the others. (and to prove it's Sam watch later tours with Ringo the Ringmaster and how quickly he fits in) The other Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, and some of the dancers look like no matter how many times they sing Rock A Bye Your Bear this is still the best job ever.The bulk of the songs come from Getting Strong/Pop Goes/Sing A Song/You Make Me Feel Like Dancing with a few classics. Sam gives a good if not uneven performance, he could have done the Shimmy Shake which Ive always felt as his song as well as he does Six Months In A Leaky Boat. It's nice to see him do some trumpet playing too. Yes this is a big big show, there are a heck of a lot of people on stage at times and you can only find the Wiggles by the color of their skivvies. Old Dan Tucker is fun to watch and looks like fun to do. There are lots of costume changes for Wiggles and dancers, nursery rhymes are mixed with songs, and all in all this show holds up to rewatching a bit more than some of the others.",4,Sam is kind of a square peg,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1512,"['different', 'sense', 'fun', 'other', 'Wiggles', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'sense', 'was', 'treating', 'job', 'deep', 'down', 'part', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bored', 'was', 'originally', 'hired', 'be', 'dancer/pirate/what', 'ever', 'stood', 'out', 'lovely', 'operatic', 'voice', ""n't"", 'use', 'enough', 'became', 'Greg', 'understudy', 'time', 'health', 'problems', 'got', 'worse', 'might', 'have', 'got', 'permanent', 'roll', 'knew', 'songs', 'could', 'fit', 'shirt', 'Sam', 'chemistry', 'never', 'fully', 'gelled', 'others', 'prove', 'Sam', 'watch', 'later', 'Ringo', 'Ringmaster', 'how', 'quickly', 'other', 'Wiggles', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'dancers', 'look', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'sing', 'Rock', 'A', 'Bye', 'Bear', 'still', 'best', 'job', 'ever.The', 'bulk', 'songs', 'come', 'Getting', 'Strong/Pop', 'Goes/Sing', 'A', 'Song/You', 'Make', 'Me', 'Feel', 'Dancing', 'few', 'classics', 'Sam', 'good', 'not', 'uneven', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Shimmy', 'Shake', 'Ive', 'always', 'felt', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'Six', 'Months', 'A', 'Leaky', 'Boat', 'nice', 'see', 'do', 'trumpet', 'playing', 'too', 'Yes', 'big', 'big', 'show', 'are', 'heck', 'lot', 'people', 'stage', 'times', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'Wiggles', 'color', 'skivvies', 'Old', 'Dan', 'Tucker', 'fun', 'watch', 'fun', 'do', 'are', 'lots', 'costume', 'changes', 'Wiggles', 'dancers', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'are', 'mixed', 'songs', 'show', 'up', 'rewatching', 'bit', 'more', 'others']","The Wiggles: Big, Big Show!"

Nice songs, cool acrobatics, fun.If you have seen a lot of them, skip this. Murray looks tired. Sam seems to have squabbled with Anthony backstage and keeps as far away as he can. And, worse, Anthony takes every opportunity to do a split or handstand, even when there's really no call for it in the music. It's OK, we get it, you are in good shape even though you are in your late 40s.It's a good show, though, just not my favorite.Sam's voice is amazing. And Jeff seems to have blossomed since Greg's departure.
