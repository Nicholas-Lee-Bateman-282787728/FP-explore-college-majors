692218,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000062XH6,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 14]","For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story.  I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal.  Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story.  I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me.  After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.  I just didn't care.  That is not a good sign.  The characters were bland.  When I say bland, I literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate.  The story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism.  Now, I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective.  The casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy.  You knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces.  These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne.What immediately pulled me away from this story?  It was mainly the characters.  I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself.  Director Larry Clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character.  Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored.  I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why.  It was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive.  He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite.  Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown.  Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film.  While I am on the subject ... nobody showcased the best of their abilities.  What is going on with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost.  Rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act.  Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in.  Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.My biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film.  Nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together.  There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed.  The robberies, the teenage ""angst and woe"", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random Kids in the Hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together.  With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape.  Family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers.  Wayne did not complete the task at hand.While I hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film I am left with little choice.  With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any ""good"" behind Tart.  This was a film I had heard nothing about, and after viewing it I can see why.  All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart.  It is hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this film.  While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm.  While most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in Tart you can credit nothing.  From the opening sequence until the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal.  No consistency, no strength.Overall, this film is a waste of your time.  If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film.  While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch.  It was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up.  Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life.

A lot have people have complained about a lack of a plot. The plot is there, it's just more drawn out. The movie was very realistic, basically it could have been a biography of any teenage girl's life. It doesn't end happily like most teen movies end, in fact it ends kinda sad but yet in the same sense it says, ""life goes on keep plugging at it"". I thought it was something any teenage girl could relate to. There aren't a lot of big stars in this movie, the biggest star today would be Mischa Barton who puts on a fake English accent.

692228,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000062XH6,Only-A-Child,"[5, 7]","""Tart"" is a good illustration of the old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"".  Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that never goes anywhere.  ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer.  Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of Swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of  the ""Alice in Wonderland"" sculpture.  The symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film.It is even possible that Waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic ""Metropolitan"" and the camp classic ""Cruel Intentions"" both of which also dealt with the Manhattan upper class.  There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes.  The former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations.  ""Tart"" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction.  First there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased Swain into the garbage chute.  Then there is the whole bit about her father being Jewish (played to the same extreme as Joel Grey dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in ""Cabaret"").In her other films Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears (insert scenery chewing here) but in ""Tart"" she actually shows an ability to restrain herself.  This is the best performance of her career.  It also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in ""Girl"" to hulking lumpy-faced in ""Pumpkin"".  This transformation was about half-complete by the time she made ""Tart""; so go the ravages of time.Mischa Barton (""Sixth Sense's"" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles.  The rest of the cast is simply horrible, although some of the blame for this should go to Waye's script and direction.Then again, what do I know?

692229,ADRP1OAW0ZI2Q,B000062XH6,"Padre Mellyrn ""padre_mellyrn""","[0, 0]","In my opinion, The main reason for watching this is to see Lacy Chabert. She smoked in Mean Girls, which is what lead me to this Film. Seeing the Names Dominique Swain (Pumpkin and Lolita, of which I have seen both and own the latter) and Melanie Griffith made me think perhaps it would be a keeper, as it was compared to Mean Girls With Lindsay Lohan. In mean Girls, Lacy still delivers the punch and smokes Lindsay as for as 'hotness'.But no the film was little more than a Reprisal of Lolita, with the poor parts of Mean Girls for a plot and not even the good Graces of or sweetness of Mean Girls. Of all the characters played, the only two who were not two dimensional like a cardboard silhouette script was Lacy and Melanie. Melanie did another 'alcoholic mother being abused by the family'. Dominique is her normal two dimensional self, sliding around moral points that should be shipwrecks, not flips of the pages on the script. In the end, you really don't feel sorry for anyone, at all.But Lacy is smoking hot, and totally believable if a bit shallow, but still tries to do right, you get the happiness is real in her family. If you get it cheap enough, it might be worth a watching or two For Lacy, Best Viewed while making in another until Lacy shows up.",2,The only reason to watch it,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1265,"['opinion', 'main', 'reason', 'watching', 'see', 'Lacy', 'Chabert', 'smoked', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'what', 'lead', 'Film', 'Seeing', 'Names', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'Pumpkin', 'Lolita', 'have', 'seen', 'own', 'latter', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'made', 'think', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'keeper', 'was', 'compared', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'mean', 'Girls', 'Lacy', 'still', 'punch', 'smokes', 'Lindsay', 'as', ""'hotness'.But"", 'film', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'Reprisal', 'Lolita', 'poor', 'parts', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'plot', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'Graces', 'sweetness', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'characters', 'played', 'only', 'two', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'two', 'dimensional', 'cardboard', 'silhouette', 'script', 'was', 'Lacy', 'Melanie', 'Melanie', 'did', ""'alcoholic"", 'mother', 'being', 'abused', 'family', 'Dominique', 'normal', 'two', 'dimensional', 'self', 'sliding', 'around', 'moral', 'points', 'should', 'be', 'shipwrecks', 'not', 'flips', 'pages', 'script', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'all.But', 'Lacy', 'smoking', 'hot', 'totally', 'believable', 'bit', 'shallow', 'still', 'do', 'right', 'get', 'happiness', 'real', 'family', 'get', 'cheap', 'enough', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'two', 'Lacy', 'Best', 'Viewed', 'making', 'Lacy', 'up']",Tart
