I really wanted it to be perfect.a) there are no subtitles - b) too much talking (guess this is a trend) and c) THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES.Extras - 45 minutes about the show and their lives.Some extra songs from the same show are in the ""extras"".

The Tenors (formally Canadian Tenors) have the voices of an angelic choir and the sex appeal of a leading romantic movie man. Highly entertaining and well worth the price. I already had the music CD of this show but kept an eye out for it when it finally came out in DVD of the actual performance in Las Vegas. Shop around though because some on the web site sell it for $59.00+ while others make it available for $17.00. I can say however, at whatever price you are willing to pay, it is WORTH EVERY CENT to see and hear this outstanding group in concert.",5,Truely Amazing,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,576,"['Simply', 'outstanding', 'Tenors', 'formally', 'Canadian', 'Tenors', 'have', 'voices', 'angelic', 'choir', 'sex', 'appeal', 'leading', 'romantic', 'movie', 'man', 'Highly', 'entertaining', 'well', 'price', 'already', 'had', 'music', 'CD', 'show', 'kept', 'eye', 'out', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'actual', 'performance', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Shop', 'web', 'site', 'sell', '59.00+', 'others', 'make', 'available', '17.00', 'can', 'say', 'however', 'price', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'WORTH', 'EVERY', 'CENT', 'see', 'hear', 'outstanding', 'group', 'concert']",The Tenors: Lead With Your Heart - Live From Las Vegas

It was a pleasant experience to watch this & a couple of the 4 tenors amazed me with their vocal abilities. I would have preferred a few more familiar tunes of my ears than was done since in Las Vegas but no real complaints. I love GOOD music & listen to much of it. This was average.,4,A good musical time was had.,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,384,"['had', 'not', 'heard', 'former', 'Canadian', 'tenors', 'though', 'have', 'past', 'known', 'other', 'Canadian', 'tenors', 'was', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'watch', 'couple', '4', 'tenors', 'amazed', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'few', 'more', 'familiar', 'tunes', 'ears', 'was', 'done', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'real', 'complaints', 'love', 'GOOD', 'music', 'listen', 'much', 'was', 'average']",The Tenors: Lead With Your Heart - Live From Las Vegas
