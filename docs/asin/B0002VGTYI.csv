The show itself is just really good. The story is your basic love triangle fairy tale where the the betrothed lady, Grania, goes for the ""other man"" Diarmiud. So we see where they meet and the consequences of their actions especially after the hubby, Finn McCool finds out. Major bonus points to the editors who titled each segment making the story a cinch to understand. It's obvious that Jean & Colin wanted to push Irish dance into a new direction and they have succeeded. They really utilize the form to tell the story with dynamic and innovative performances that still embody traditional Irish dance values. Along with sensational music and beautiful costumes this is a must have. The most impressive aspect of this DVD is the behind the scenes documentary on the process of bringing ""Dangerous Ground"" to the stage. It was so eye-opening to see what it takes to bring these seemingly simplistic shows to life. And hearing input from the dancers, especially Colin and Jean, added more depth to the actual show because I had a sense of what they felt before the curtain raised on opening night. I would actually recommend watching the doc. before watching the show to get the full experience of this amazing show. I truly hope that Dunne and Butler continue to make more ""ground"" breaking shows such as this one. Definitely a must have for dance and theatre lovers.",5,Irish Dancing At It's Best,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1504,"['actually', 'rented', 'buying', 'will', 'be', 'added', 'shopping', 'cart', 'real', 'soon', 'DVD', 'great', 'show', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'basic', 'love', 'triangle', 'fairy', 'tale', 'where', 'betrothed', 'lady', 'Grania', 'other', 'man', 'Diarmiud', 'see', 'where', 'meet', 'consequences', 'actions', 'especially', 'hubby', 'Finn', 'McCool', 'out', 'Major', 'bonus', 'points', 'editors', 'who', 'titled', 'segment', 'making', 'story', 'cinch', 'understand', 'obvious', 'Jean', 'Colin', 'wanted', 'push', 'Irish', 'dance', 'new', 'direction', 'have', 'succeeded', 'really', 'utilize', 'form', 'tell', 'story', 'dynamic', 'innovative', 'performances', 'still', 'embody', 'traditional', 'Irish', 'dance', 'values', 'sensational', 'music', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'must', 'have', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'process', 'bringing', 'Dangerous', 'Ground', 'stage', 'was', 'so', 'eye-opening', 'see', 'what', 'bring', 'seemingly', 'simplistic', 'shows', 'life', 'hearing', 'input', 'dancers', 'especially', 'Colin', 'Jean', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'actual', 'show', 'had', 'sense', 'what', 'felt', 'curtain', 'raised', 'opening', 'night', 'would', 'actually', 'recommend', 'watching', 'doc', 'watching', 'show', 'get', 'full', 'experience', 'amazing', 'show', 'truly', 'hope', 'Dunne', 'Butler', 'continue', 'make', 'more', 'ground', 'breaking', 'shows', 'such', 'one', 'Definitely', 'must', 'have', 'dance', 'theatre', 'lovers']",N/A

847309,A2KIJBT9HRIOM8,B0002VGTYI,Danelle L Marker,"[0, 0]","I am a fan of a Michael Flatley and all of his productions. What I love about him is what some others complain about - his onstage presence, confidence and dancing capabilities. He is a strong leading man who has charisma and flair which draws you in. To me, his dancing capabilities are second, though second to none. He has vision, and along with that, beautiful sets, costumes, music and dance. I knew this would probably be way different than that, and it was. It had some beautiful dancing. Jean Butler was a lot more sensual in this then she was in Riverdance, probably because she gets along with Colin Dunne so well. I really did like parts of it, and the story itself. However, I thought the set and costumes were very plain and I feel that while Colin is a talented dancer, I prefer the showman in Flatley. Always have, always will. I know that my complaints are probably purposeful, to be more inLine with traditional irish dance. Just not my preference. Still is worth a watch because the dancing is good and the chemistry between Butler and Dunne is beautiful.",4,Good material,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1073,"['am', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'productions', 'What', 'love', 'what', 'others', 'complain', 'onstage', 'presence', 'confidence', 'dancing', 'capabilities', 'strong', 'leading', 'man', 'who', 'charisma', 'flair', 'dancing', 'capabilities', 'are', 'second', 'though', 'second', 'none', 'vision', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'dance', 'knew', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'way', 'different', 'was', 'had', 'beautiful', 'dancing', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'sensual', 'then', 'was', 'Riverdance', 'probably', 'along', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'did', 'parts', 'story', 'However', 'thought', 'set', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'plain', 'feel', 'Colin', 'talented', 'dancer', 'prefer', 'showman', 'Flatley', 'Always', 'have', 'always', 'will', 'know', 'complaints', 'are', 'probably', 'purposeful', 'be', 'more', 'inLine', 'traditional', 'irish', 'dance', 'Just', 'not', 'preference', 'Still', 'watch', 'dancing', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Butler', 'Dunne', 'beautiful']",N/A

It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG.

Dancing on Dangerous Ground features two of my favorite dancers, Butler and Dunne. The dancing is terrific in this show, as usual.

Neary,"[7, 32]","When I first saw the ""In the Court of Finn McCool"" dance sequence, I thought for a moment that I was back in college, at a fraternity party.  This bouquet of khaki pants and button down shirts really brought back the memories of watered down beer.  What happened?  Was the budget so tight that the producers couldn't afford decent costumes?  I am not talking about elaborate lace-and-sparkles costumes like those worn by figure skaters.  I'm talking about trusty old black and green velvet, silvery satin, anything that doesn't scream 1990s.The dress worn by Jean Butler during the romantic duet (the dark-purle one, with an uneven hem) echoes of high-school homecoming dance.  Jean Butler has such beautiful legs, and that dress totally ruined the look.  She looked stiff and uncomfortable.My last complaint is Colin Dunn's sour expression throughout the show.  I understand that there is nothing he can do about his short statue and acne scars.  But he could have a least tried to have fun on stage.
