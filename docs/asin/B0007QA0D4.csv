If you have any sensuality and creativity at all, you've already done these moves and don't need a dvd to tell you how.  If you can get to ""full routine 6 times"" by searching forward (it's not under ""tease segments"" for some reason), start there and you can pick up the moves while skipping the long, boring instruction.  The ""isolations"" section is a joke - bellydance moves are much sexier, more beautiful, and never cheesy.  Besides the awful music, it is distracting to have SEVEN dancers to watch, especially when only the front 3 really know what they are doing anyway; it would be an improvement to have fewer.  I would not recommend this dvd.

I like the fact that it is exercise, not a ""how to strip"" DVD and I love the interval training - that is a great idea.  BUT, there is one major fault with the program - it is structured too much like a dance routine and too little like a workout.  For me this means there were too many times during which my body cooled off before the DVD got back to working out my muscles.  I found myself just waiting around until the DVD got back to movement.  In fact, I had to invent my own moves to keep my heart rate up and my muscles working, which was frustrating.  I would love it if they corrected this one problem, because otherwise the moves are good and do work your muscles out.",3,There are better out there,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,732,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'strip', 'aerobic', 'DVD', 'fact', 'exercise', 'not', 'how', 'strip', 'DVD', 'love', 'interval', 'training', 'great', 'idea', 'BUT', 'one', 'major', 'fault', 'program', 'structured', 'too', 'much', 'dance', 'routine', 'too', 'little', 'workout', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'body', 'cooled', 'off', 'DVD', 'got', 'back', 'working', 'out', 'muscles', 'found', 'just', 'waiting', 'around', 'DVD', 'got', 'back', 'movement', 'fact', 'had', 'invent', 'own', 'moves', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'muscles', 'working', 'was', 'frustrating', 'would', 'love', 'corrected', 'one', 'problem', 'otherwise', 'moves', 'are', 'good', 'do', 'work', 'muscles', 'out']",Striptease Work-Out:  Volume One
887286,A29V9Z89OH03YR,B0007QA0D4,Tamii,"[48, 58]","The one thing I liked about this dvd is that it provides a really good total body workout using some basic stripper moves with a hip hop flare.  What I didn't like is that it doesn't really distinguish itself from other basic aerobic dvds.  After 15 minutes of hip rolling and pelvic bumping, things can get a little boring.  Where's the sexy floorwork?  Lapwork? Polework?Also, I found it boring that all of the ladies in the dvd are about the same age, race and body shape.  More diversity with body size would have made this tape more interesting!  Also, this tape does not use any props.  The only thing that links it to striptease are the bumps and grinds!For people who want to learn striptease or erotic dance, there's going to be some disappointment with this one.  Of course, you can always take the moves presented here and come up with your own choreography.Overall, I liked this dvd for its workout capacity, but I wish the producers had put more thought into how to make striptease aerobics more sexy and interesting!",3,Provides a total workout!,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,1030,"['one', 'thing', 'liked', 'dvd', 'really', 'good', 'total', 'body', 'using', 'basic', 'stripper', 'moves', 'hip', 'hop', 'flare', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'really', 'distinguish', 'other', 'basic', 'aerobic', 'dvds', '15', 'minutes', 'hip', 'rolling', 'pelvic', 'bumping', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'boring', 'Where', 'sexy', 'floorwork', 'Lapwork', 'Polework', 'Also', 'found', 'boring', 'ladies', 'dvd', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'race', 'body', 'shape', 'More', 'diversity', 'body', 'size', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'tape', 'more', 'interesting', 'Also', 'tape', 'not', 'use', 'props', 'only', 'thing', 'striptease', 'are', 'bumps', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'striptease', 'erotic', 'dance', 'going', 'be', 'disappointment', 'one', 'course', 'can', 'always', 'take', 'moves', 'presented', 'here', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'choreography.Overall', 'liked', 'dvd', 'workout', 'capacity', 'wish', 'producers', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'thought', 'how', 'make', 'striptease', 'aerobics', 'more', 'sexy', 'interesting']",Striptease Work-Out:  Volume One
887287,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B0007QA0D4,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[14, 14]","The menu options give you either a full workout, a mini tease of only 18 min or any chapter. The background beat is definitely cheap & almost nails on the chalkboard with no temptation to dance. The stage is a nice simple brick wall with vinyl black floor. There are 6 backup girls with Tricia all in pick sports bras & black pants, 2 of them in their 40s or more, all in great shape.Tricia herself is upbeat, sweet & means well, I love her honest personality & friendliness, but she's not the best person to learn to be more graceful, fluid or be in touch with your body. Her backup dancers are mostly worse. It seems they are more focused on doing the moves to burn calories then to be sexy.Tricia also is always counting loudly with too much enthusiasm, like counting is more important then dancing, as if she needs it in order to move. She breaks down the routine to each step, going in 1/2 speed or slower which is great, but sometimes goes over the simple moves several times too many. There is a separate part for the harder moves like undulations, but that was taught faster then other moves & she doesn't give enough analogies or body placement. I'm glad I already own belly dance dvds.After every time you do more then 2-3 moves at once, she always lets you stop & ""shake it off"" for 15 seconds, even if the moves are very simple like walking in a circle. This doesn't help keep you going & reminds you you're working out & bored waiting.  Her teaching slowly should be the ""rest"" time like other DVDs, not more standing around, that's what a pause button is for. Since the music sucks, that's all you have in your head, her counting. Every time after the rest, she always has to count to 5 before starting again which is very annoying, a simple ""ready"" would suffice.For extra strength training, there are about two moves in the middle of the routine, one a upward dog/downward dog cool move for the arms & the other being squats that she has you practice over & over a %&(#load of times that would kill anyone, that is presented like a regular aerobics class.There are about 4 moves done on the floor & no pole work, but how many people have poles in their homes? I'm sure if you have one you can find other dvds for that specifically, this is for exercise & learning to dance, not become a professional.There is a Mini Teaser which is 20 min which has a 10 min warm up & then you do the routine straight through normal speed 6x. That idea is great, just ruined by the bad dancing by the dancers.The moves are the most stripper/sexy like of the ones I have which is what I was looking for, Carmen Electra's being too cute & MTV dance like & Jeff's Costa's being half hip-hop, half stripper style. Carmen's dance  instruction flowed better & no stopping, she counts a lot too, but not nearly as bad & she's more fluid in her movements & not afraid of her body & more in tune with it. I like Jeff's best, he's the most fluid, knows how to let go, least afraid of his body, he's also a lot of fun, his had best flow & was like a workout with teaching moves slowly & then speeding up with no rests.I had a VERY hard time finishing this, not because it was hard to do, but because I was so uninspired by the bad music & self-conscious dancing & slow pace. Too bad since the moves were the most stripper style & sexy & Tricia was very patient about teaching moves slowly so people can follow. Dancing is about letting go & feeling your body, being aware & stripping most of all, but this dvd lets you down most in that area.There still is almost no body awareness, they go through the motions, but seems like the moves could be more sexy with the right attitude that the women don't convey as much either due to production or shyness or no body awareness of their own. It's kinda done with little enthusiasm for dancing, more like ""eh, if this is what turns on my man, uugghhh, fine, I'll do it, but I won't like it, I don't feel attractive/sexy...."" This is what turned me off the most. Real dancers aren't afraid of their own body or enjoying how it moves, even martial artists are aware in an enthusiastic way, though different.Video clip on youtube under ""Urban Striptease Vol 1 with Tricia Murphy""",3,"Great moves, patient teaching, but bad music & self-conscious dancing",1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,4208,"['menu', 'options', 'give', 'full', 'workout', 'mini', 'tease', 'only', '18', 'min', 'chapter', 'background', 'beat', 'definitely', 'cheap', 'almost', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'temptation', 'dance', 'stage', 'nice', 'simple', 'brick', 'wall', 'vinyl', 'black', 'floor', 'are', '6', 'backup', 'girls', 'Tricia', 'pick', 'sports', 'bras', 'black', 'pants', '2', '40s', 'more', 'great', 'shape.Tricia', 'upbeat', 'sweet', 'well', 'love', 'honest', 'personality', 'friendliness', 'not', 'best', 'person', 'learn', 'be', 'more', 'graceful', 'fluid', 'be', 'touch', 'body', 'backup', 'dancers', 'are', 'mostly', 'worse', 'are', 'more', 'focused', 'doing', 'moves', 'burn', 'calories', 'then', 'be', 'sexy.Tricia', 'also', 'always', 'counting', 'loudly', 'too', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'counting', 'more', 'important', 'then', 'dancing', 'order', 'move', 'down', 'routine', 'step', 'going', '1/2', 'speed', 'slower', 'great', 'sometimes', 'simple', 'moves', 'several', 'times', 'too', 'many', 'separate', 'part', 'harder', 'moves', 'undulations', 'was', 'taught', 'faster', 'then', 'other', 'moves', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'analogies', 'body', 'placement', ""'m"", 'glad', 'already', 'own', 'belly', 'dance', 'dvds.After', 'time', 'do', 'more', 'then', '2-3', 'moves', 'once', 'always', 'stop', 'shake', 'off', '15', 'seconds', 'even', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'walking', 'circle', ""n't"", 'help', 'keep', 'going', 'reminds', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'bored', 'waiting', 'teaching', 'slowly', 'should', 'be', 'rest', 'time', 'other', 'DVDs', 'not', 'more', 'standing', 'around', 'what', 'pause', 'button', 'music', 'have', 'head', 'counting', 'time', 'rest', 'always', 'count', '5', 'starting', 'again', 'very', 'annoying', 'simple', 'ready', 'would', 'suffice.For', 'extra', 'strength', 'training', 'are', 'two', 'moves', 'middle', 'routine', 'one', 'upward', 'dog/downward', 'dog', 'cool', 'move', 'arms', 'other', 'being', 'squats', 'practice', '%', 'load', 'times', 'would', 'kill', 'anyone', 'presented', 'regular', 'aerobics', 'are', '4', 'moves', 'done', 'floor', 'pole', 'work', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'poles', 'homes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'dvds', 'specifically', 'exercise', 'learning', 'dance', 'not', 'become', 'professional.There', 'Mini', 'Teaser', '20', 'min', '10', 'min', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'do', 'routine', 'straight', 'normal', 'speed', '6x', 'idea', 'great', 'just', 'ruined', 'bad', 'dancing', 'dancers.The', 'moves', 'are', 'most', 'stripper/sexy', 'ones', 'have', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'being', 'too', 'cute', 'MTV', 'dance', 'Jeff', 'Costa', 'being', 'half', 'hip-hop', 'half', 'stripper', 'style', 'Carmen', 'dance', 'instruction', 'flowed', 'better', 'stopping', 'lot', 'too', 'not', 'nearly', 'bad', 'more', 'fluid', 'movements', 'not', 'afraid', 'body', 'more', 'tune', 'like', 'Jeff', 'best', 'most', 'fluid', 'how', 'let', 'go', 'least', 'afraid', 'body', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'best', 'flow', 'was', 'workout', 'teaching', 'moves', 'slowly', 'then', 'speeding', 'up', 'rests.I', 'had', 'VERY', 'hard', 'time', 'finishing', 'not', 'was', 'hard', 'do', 'was', 'so', 'uninspired', 'bad', 'music', 'self-conscious', 'dancing', 'slow', 'pace', 'Too', 'bad', 'moves', 'were', 'most', 'stripper', 'style', 'sexy', 'Tricia', 'was', 'very', 'patient', 'teaching', 'moves', 'slowly', 'so', 'people', 'can', 'follow', 'Dancing', 'letting', 'go', 'feeling', 'body', 'being', 'aware', 'stripping', 'most', 'dvd', 'down', 'most', 'still', 'almost', 'body', 'awareness', 'go', 'motions', 'moves', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'sexy', 'right', 'attitude', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'convey', 'as', 'much', 'due', 'production', 'shyness', 'body', 'awareness', 'own', 'kinda', 'done', 'little', 'enthusiasm', 'dancing', 'more', 'eh', 'what', 'man', 'uugghhh', 'fine', ""'ll"", 'do', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'attractive/sexy', 'what', 'turned', 'off', 'most', 'Real', 'dancers', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'own', 'body', 'enjoying', 'how', 'even', 'martial', 'artists', 'are', 'aware', 'enthusiastic', 'way', 'different.Video', 'clip', 'youtube', 'Urban', 'Striptease', 'Vol', '1', 'Tricia', 'Murphy']",Striptease Work-Out:  Volume One
