This film is definitely more of an art film and nothing at all like what the box description says. We picked our copy up at a video store that was closing. My husband and I watched it together and were entertained but puzzled. But I didn't hate it by any means.I re-watched the film about a month ago and now knowing not to expect the standard Hollywood type plot, I was able to take away a lot more from the nuances made in gestures and dialog. I quite like the film and I am glad we bought it. The unique style of the film almost gives you the sensation of being a voyeur into these episodes of the main characters lives. We don't know the ""whole story"" just what we see and hear in this present moment with them. I actually thought Defoe did a great job with his backward, secluded character. He is a delight to watch.Yes, there is a horn type toot at one scene that is odd. After reading the review which mentioned it as being like an elf under a toadstool, I think of that when I see it and chuckle, but enjoy it none the less. The ending of the film is a bit of a shock, but it is meaningful. I think when you first see the film, you don't realize the importance of the opening scene...",4,"Not for Everyone, But Enjoyable to Me",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,1245,"['agree', 'points', 'made', 'myxoplik', 'review', 'film', 'definitely', 'more', 'art', 'film', 'nothing', 'what', 'box', 'description', 'picked', 'copy', 'up', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'closing', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'were', 'entertained', 'puzzled', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'means.I', 're-watched', 'film', 'month', 'ago', 'now', 'knowing', 'not', 'expect', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'plot', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'away', 'lot', 'more', 'nuances', 'made', 'gestures', 'dialog', 'quite', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'unique', 'style', 'film', 'almost', 'sensation', 'being', 'voyeur', 'episodes', 'main', 'characters', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'present', 'moment', 'actually', 'thought', 'Defoe', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'backward', 'secluded', 'character', 'delight', 'watch.Yes', 'horn', 'type', 'toot', 'one', 'scene', 'odd', 'reading', 'review', 'mentioned', 'being', 'elf', 'toadstool', 'think', 'when', 'see', 'chuckle', 'enjoy', 'less', 'ending', 'film', 'bit', 'shock', 'meaningful', 'think', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'importance', 'opening', 'scene']",The Black Widow

1073896,A3ULT9W0O6CFFE,B000Q677G8,"myxoplik ""myxoplik""","[0, 2]","Most people will hate this movie because it is very unconventional in style, storytelling and theme. It is mostly devoid of plot, action, humour, and even the dialogue is quite sparse and (deliberately) awkward. Instead, the film presents us with a challenging piece about isolation and detachment.The best way I can put it is to say it's a lot like a Jim Jarmusch film, particularly ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" except without the comedy, instead substituting a brooding, haunting tone throughout the picture. Maybe it's a bit like ""Last Tango in Paris"".The thing to realize when watching this movie is that it's basically a movie about a house. Filmed at the ""Rubber House"", named so for its twisted, black appearance, this film instills us with all the emptiness that you'd think a lonely house would feel. Characters come and go, and each character (as lonely and disconnected as the house itself) feels an inexplicable connection to the site as well as an affinity for each other, but relationships are always troubled and awkward. It's almost as if the house itself is a jealous, menacing presence that resists any attempts to make it into a happy home.Although I'm dwelling on the house, it's really doesn't figure into the plot. So don't expect a horror story about an evil house like ""Amityville"" or ""Burnt Offerings"" (although the latter is a killer flick as far as evil houses go). Instead, this is a very real story, full of real characters and the monotony of real life, seen through the eyes of a bunch of reclusive misfits.Despite the heavy subject, there's some well-timed levity, notably in the restaurant scene with the great Isaach De Bankol&eacute; playing the waiter (Jarmusch fans will recognize him as the weird ice cream man in ""Ghost Dog"" or the hilariously annoying busybody in ""Coffee & Cigarettes: No Problem""). His perfect deadpan delivery makes the restaurant scene a real treat. The fact that there's no point *is* the point.Definitely this is not a film for casual entertainment, and despite the spooky title ""Black Widow"" and misleading DVD description (some nonsense about a thriller mysetery), it's definitely not a heart-pounder. What it does deliver instead is a great melancholy vibe, perfect for a cold, rainy day. It's best watched alone.",4,Most people will hate this movie,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,2271,"['Most', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', 'very', 'unconventional', 'style', 'storytelling', 'theme', 'mostly', 'devoid', 'plot', 'action', 'humour', 'even', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'sparse', 'deliberately', 'awkward', 'Instead', 'film', 'challenging', 'piece', 'isolation', 'detachment.The', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'put', 'say', 'lot', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'film', 'particularly', 'Coffee', 'Cigarettes', 'comedy', 'instead', 'substituting', 'brooding', 'haunting', 'tone', 'picture', 'bit', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', '.The', 'thing', 'realize', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'basically', 'movie', 'house', 'Filmed', 'Rubber', 'House', 'named', 'so', 'twisted', 'black', 'appearance', 'film', 'emptiness', ""'d"", 'think', 'lonely', 'house', 'would', 'feel', 'Characters', 'come', 'go', 'character', 'lonely', 'disconnected', 'house', 'inexplicable', 'connection', 'site', 'as', 'well', 'affinity', 'other', 'relationships', 'are', 'always', 'troubled', 'awkward', 'almost', 'house', 'jealous', 'menacing', 'presence', 'attempts', 'make', 'happy', 'home.Although', ""'m"", 'dwelling', 'house', 'really', ""n't"", 'figure', 'plot', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'horror', 'story', 'evil', 'house', 'Amityville', 'Burnt', 'Offerings', 'latter', 'killer', 'flick', 'as', 'far', 'evil', 'houses', 'go', 'Instead', 'very', 'real', 'story', 'full', 'real', 'characters', 'monotony', 'real', 'life', 'seen', 'eyes', 'bunch', 'reclusive', 'misfits.Despite', 'heavy', 'subject', 'well-timed', 'levity', 'notably', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'great', 'Isaach', 'De', 'Bankol', 'eacute', 'playing', 'waiter', 'Jarmusch', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'weird', 'ice', 'cream', 'man', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'hilariously', 'annoying', 'busybody', 'Coffee', 'Cigarettes', 'Problem', 'perfect', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'real', 'treat', 'fact', 'point', 'point.Definitely', 'not', 'film', 'casual', 'entertainment', 'spooky', 'title', 'Black', 'Widow', 'misleading', 'DVD', 'description', 'nonsense', 'thriller', 'mysetery', 'definitely', 'not', 'heart-pounder', 'What', 'deliver', 'instead', 'great', 'melancholy', 'vibe', 'perfect', 'cold', 'rainy', 'day', 'best', 'watched', 'alone']",The Black Widow
