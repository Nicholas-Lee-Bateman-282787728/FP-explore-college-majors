Garrick is a twisted, sick, and evil killer who loves to torture women psychologically before brutally killing them.  Turrell's killings has created a sort of cult following and his many fans are upset that he has been captured. The secondary story line is about the woman that help put Turrell away, Sarah. Sarah is a nervous wreck because of the killer that she was madly in love with has now become an alcoholic and when she attends her Alcoholics Anonymous meeting she meets Kevin.Kevin is a caring guy who tries to break through the emotional walls that Sarah has put up and he begins to have some success. The movie is filmed in a gritty but hazy style that I found creative, but the story line could have been much better. The end of the movie gives you a big twist but it leaves a  lot to be desired. I think that if this movie changed some of the sequences and added more to the ending then this will be a great movie, but as it stands this movie was just alright.",3,Dark and Gritty!!,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1053,"['Horrible', 'way', 'die', 'serial', 'killer', 'name', 'Garrick', 'Turrell', 'Garrick', 'twisted', 'sick', 'evil', 'killer', 'who', 'torture', 'women', 'psychologically', 'brutally', 'killing', 'Turrell', 'killings', 'created', 'sort', 'cult', 'following', 'many', 'fans', 'are', 'upset', 'been', 'captured', 'secondary', 'story', 'line', 'woman', 'help', 'put', 'Turrell', 'away', 'Sarah', 'Sarah', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'killer', 'was', 'madly', 'love', 'now', 'become', 'alcoholic', 'when', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'meeting', 'Kevin.Kevin', 'caring', 'guy', 'who', 'break', 'emotional', 'walls', 'Sarah', 'put', 'up', 'have', 'success', 'movie', 'filmed', 'gritty', 'hazy', 'style', 'found', 'creative', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'end', 'movie', 'big', 'twist', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'think', 'movie', 'changed', 'sequences', 'added', 'more', 'ending', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'alright']",N/A
1443312,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0055V0K3G,Amy Lynn,"[1, 2]","I'd call it a let down though I wasn't expecting much going into it... Of course I was hopeful this would be ""one of the good ones"" amongst this genre but I was disappointed.The movie is about this woman who is an alcoholic. Her boyfriend is in jail, turns out he is a serial killer. The woman starts going to AA meetings for her alcohol problem. She meets this seemingly nice guy at one of her AA meetings and they start dating. At the start of the movie we get to see the serial killer- the old boyfriend- doing his thing to his victim. I have to say that the guy who played the serial killer wasn't bad, in fact he may have been the highlight of the movie, he did pretty good as far as acting is concerned and overall personality of a serial killer. The rest of the cast didn't impress me. It felt as though some of them were hired right off the street to act in this movie. They didn't capture my interest.If I were to explain to you the whole plot of this movie and give away the ending you would probably say ""wow, that sounds good""- that's the problem- It sounds good but it isn't.So, we find out the boyfriend serial killer has escaped from jail is looking for her and now the old girlfriend needs a place to hide. She goes with this AA meeting guy to a cabin in the woods to hide out and then bam... Twist in the story. The ending sounds good on paper but on the screen it just didn't work for me. It may have been the actors hired for the roles, all of them who couldn't pull it off and make this interesting. The serial killer boyfriend did Okay though. Disappointing uninteresting ending and ended too soon despite the whole movie being somewhat boring. As in, the whole movie was boring to a degree then the ending you're left wanting more explanation.In a way it was somewhat cliche, but it did have a point to it I guess, though not enough to make me care or be impressed or make me want to watch again. I'd give it between 2 and 3 stars.",2,A Let Down,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,1953,"[""'d"", 'call', 'let', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'going', 'course', 'was', 'hopeful', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'ones', 'amongst', 'genre', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'boyfriend', 'jail', 'out', 'serial', 'killer', 'woman', 'going', 'AA', 'meetings', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'seemingly', 'nice', 'guy', 'one', 'AA', 'meetings', 'start', 'dating', 'start', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'serial', 'killer-', 'old', 'boyfriend-', 'doing', 'thing', 'victim', 'have', 'say', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'highlight', 'movie', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'overall', 'personality', 'serial', 'killer', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'impress', 'felt', 'were', 'hired', 'right', 'street', 'act', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'interest.If', 'were', 'explain', 'whole', 'plot', 'movie', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'wow', 'good', 'problem-', 'good', ""isn't.So"", 'find', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'serial', 'killer', 'escaped', 'jail', 'looking', 'now', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'place', 'hide', 'AA', 'meeting', 'guy', 'cabin', 'woods', 'hide', 'out', 'then', 'bam', 'Twist', 'story', 'ending', 'sounds', 'good', 'paper', 'screen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'actors', 'hired', 'roles', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'make', 'interesting', 'serial', 'killer', 'boyfriend', 'did', 'Okay', 'Disappointing', 'uninteresting', 'ending', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'whole', 'movie', 'being', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'degree', 'then', 'ending', ""'re"", 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'explanation.In', 'way', 'was', 'somewhat', 'cliche', 'did', 'have', 'point', 'guess', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'be', 'impressed', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'again', ""'d"", 'give', '2', '3', 'stars']",N/A
1443313,A28CCN6VYHRUKS,B0055V0K3G,"Andrew Gray ""Beezer Review""","[0, 0]","I really enjoy horror/thriller movies. There's just something about them that keep me interested.Movies like Saw, Hostel, etc. Then really well done thrillers like Psycho, The Shining, etc.When I originally heard about this movie I was expecting something that spanned both of those genres. Granted I didn't expect it to be in the same ballpark as those movies as it was a straight to DVD release.What i got however, is an amatuer-ish attempt at crossing those lines. The plot of this movie has the same pace as a movie about a flesh eating glacier. And, about the same excitement too. Some of the videography was well done, but that was hit and miss. There are a couple scnese that - because of how they were filmed - make little to no sense.The movie comes in at around an hour and a half. But for the first hour and ten minutes you will be looking around the room to try and find something to create your own horror movie with and possibly stab your eyes so you don't have to watch.Of course being that this is a thriller/horror movie there is a dramatic twist at the end. But, if you passed the 5th grade and have watched movies in the past you'll know what it is.In the end, for me, it was a disappointing movie and not an overly pleasurable experience.",2,Just not very good,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1258,"['really', 'enjoy', 'horror/thriller', 'movies', 'just', 'something', 'keep', 'interested.Movies', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'etc', 'Then', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'thrillers', 'Psycho', 'Shining', 'etc.When', 'originally', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'spanned', 'genres', 'Granted', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'same', 'ballpark', 'movies', 'was', 'straight', 'DVD', 'release.What', 'i', 'got', 'however', 'amatuer-ish', 'attempt', 'crossing', 'lines', 'plot', 'movie', 'same', 'pace', 'movie', 'flesh', 'eating', 'glacier', 'same', 'excitement', 'too', 'videography', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', 'couple', 'scnese', 'how', 'were', 'filmed', 'make', 'little', 'sense.The', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'first', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'room', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'create', 'own', 'horror', 'movie', 'possibly', 'stab', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch.Of', 'course', 'being', 'thriller/horror', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'twist', 'end', 'passed', '5th', 'grade', 'have', 'watched', 'movies', 'past', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'end', 'was', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'not', 'overly', 'pleasurable', 'experience']",N/A

1443315,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0055V0K3G,barry,"[2, 4]","If you read the synopsis of this movie and love thriller/horror movies you will get very excited but believe me the movie in no way matches up to its promise.  The premise is that a famed serial killer has escaped from police custody and he goes on a lengthy murder spree as he travels to get to his ex girlfriend.  She is a recovering alcoholic and it was her testimony that put him away.  The first mistake here is that she is obviously in protected custody and no one notifies her when her ex boyfriend escapes.  All the rest of the faults lie with director Adam Wingard and writer/producer Simon Barrett.  This movie plays out worse than any school class project could have.  There is no suspense, no thrills, no horror and the acting is all around terrible.  Plot is also minimal at best and there is no character development.  As we follow the killer on each murder the viewer feels nothing.  And the film has this weird way of going from past to present or from one character to another with flashing/fading lights and other transitional effects that get very irritating for there are some very short scenes.  It's a jumble of irritating nothingness.The only saving grace to enduring 87 minutes of boredom is the surprise ending.  It is an OMG moment but in no way makes up for the unemotional ,ill made journey to get there.  I can't believe that there weren't better actors out there who would even have worked for free for the exposure who would have risen this terrible script a few notches.  But those people probably read it and knew to stay away.  The only other redeeming grace to this film is that it does show respect to the sanctity of NA and AA.  Other than that it is far below a grade B horror movie.  This is one of the rare times I've honestly said please beware of this film.  But believe me, all the negative reviews here are true.  There is no sense or purpose to this movie and it is just very poorly made.",2,"Great idea, awful execution",1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1933,"['read', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'love', 'thriller/horror', 'movies', 'will', 'get', 'very', 'excited', 'believe', 'movie', 'way', 'up', 'promise', 'premise', 'famed', 'serial', 'killer', 'escaped', 'police', 'custody', 'lengthy', 'murder', 'spree', 'get', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'was', 'testimony', 'put', 'away', 'first', 'mistake', 'here', 'obviously', 'protected', 'custody', 'one', 'when', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'escapes', 'rest', 'faults', 'lie', 'director', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'writer/producer', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'movie', 'out', 'worse', 'school', 'class', 'project', 'could', 'have', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'horror', 'acting', 'terrible', 'Plot', 'also', 'minimal', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'follow', 'killer', 'murder', 'viewer', 'feels', 'nothing', 'film', 'weird', 'way', 'going', 'past', 'present', 'one', 'character', 'flashing/fading', 'lights', 'other', 'transitional', 'effects', 'get', 'very', 'irritating', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'jumble', 'irritating', 'nothingness.The', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'enduring', '87', 'minutes', 'boredom', 'surprise', 'ending', 'OMG', 'moment', 'way', 'up', 'unemotional', 'ill', 'made', 'journey', 'get', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', ""n't"", 'better', 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'worked', 'free', 'exposure', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'risen', 'terrible', 'script', 'few', 'notches', 'people', 'probably', 'read', 'knew', 'stay', 'away', 'only', 'other', 'redeeming', 'grace', 'film', 'show', 'respect', 'sanctity', 'NA', 'AA', 'Other', 'far', 'grade', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'times', ""'ve"", 'honestly', 'said', 'please', 'beware', 'film', 'believe', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'true', 'sense', 'purpose', 'movie', 'just', 'very', 'poorly', 'made']",N/A
1443316,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,B0055V0K3G,Buddy S,"[0, 0]","This low budget film had a limited release in theaters in the August, 2011, which was followed by the DVD release the following month.  It is billed as a horror film.  There is some blood and gore, but a large part of it is off camera.Nearly all of the film is shot with an unsteady hand held camera, which has difficulty centering and fixing on the subject and sometimes has an object in the foreground which partially obscures the subject.  This technique was obviously intended to add to the mood and to the mild degree of suspense that is built over the course of the film, but for me the camera work became annoying fairly quickly.The plot might appeal to horror film fans - there is a twist at the end, but, like many horror films, the plot borders on the absurd.  Sarah (played by Amy Seimetz) lives with her boyfriend Garrick (A.J. Bowen.  Sarah is not aware that Garrick has an unusual hobby.  You see, Garrick is a serial killer.  Garrick professes that he loves Sarah, but the film does not attempt to explain why, if Garrick views his romantic relationship with Sarah as satisfying, he is compelled to engage in the senseless murder of a string of innocent victims.  Sarah eventually discovers Garrick's secret life and turns him in to the authorities.  Garrick, however, escapes from prison, and, as the film progresses, resumes his killing spree as he hunts to find Sarah.The film relies heavily on flashbacks and some of the sequencing is confusing and difficult to follow.  The acting is the strong point of this film, especially by Amy Seimetz who does a credible job conveying Sarah's anguish and vulnerability.The DVD sound is in Dolby 5.1 and is excellent.  The music in the sound track is well tailored for the storyline and helps convey the mood and maintain some suspense.",3,A Mediocre Horror Film,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1795,"['low', 'budget', 'film', 'had', 'limited', 'release', 'theaters', 'August', '2011', 'was', 'followed', 'DVD', 'release', 'following', 'month', 'billed', 'horror', 'film', 'blood', 'gore', 'large', 'part', 'camera.Nearly', 'film', 'shot', 'unsteady', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'difficulty', 'centering', 'fixing', 'subject', 'sometimes', 'object', 'foreground', 'partially', 'subject', 'technique', 'was', 'obviously', 'intended', 'add', 'mood', 'mild', 'degree', 'suspense', 'built', 'course', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'became', 'annoying', 'fairly', 'quickly.The', 'plot', 'might', 'appeal', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'twist', 'end', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'plot', 'borders', 'absurd', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'boyfriend', 'Garrick', 'A.J', 'Bowen', 'Sarah', 'not', 'aware', 'Garrick', 'unusual', 'hobby', 'see', 'Garrick', 'serial', 'killer', 'Garrick', 'Sarah', 'film', 'not', 'attempt', 'explain', 'why', 'Garrick', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'satisfying', 'compelled', 'engage', 'senseless', 'murder', 'string', 'innocent', 'victims', 'Sarah', 'eventually', 'Garrick', 'secret', 'life', 'authorities', 'Garrick', 'however', 'escapes', 'prison', 'film', 'killing', 'spree', 'find', 'Sarah.The', 'film', 'relies', 'heavily', 'flashbacks', 'sequencing', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'follow', 'acting', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'especially', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'who', 'credible', 'job', 'conveying', 'Sarah', 'anguish', 'vulnerability.The', 'DVD', 'sound', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'excellent', 'music', 'sound', 'track', 'well', 'tailored', 'storyline', 'convey', 'mood', 'maintain', 'suspense']",N/A
1443317,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B0055V0K3G,Captain Insanity,"[0, 0]","I miss the old Adam Wingard.When he first came onto the scene with ""Home Sick"" I was blown clean outta my socks, out the window, and onto my front porch.A gory slasher that almost wandered around in a haze doing everything right.His follow-up ""Pop Skull"" wandered around in the same dream-like stupor, but conversely accomplished very little.In fact I would say it pretty much didn't do anything.I was starting to get the suspicion that maybe Home Sick was a fluke.Then he released ""A Horrible Way to Die"".While it much more polished than his previous two entries, with deeper, more emotionally complex characters, it seemed like the haze had cleared;like he was no longer as experimental as he once was.It was like he had evolved into a different filmmaker entirely.A more professional filmmaker.Now while this may seem like a good thing, it almost felt like a betrayal.Everything about his third feature length flick felt much more conventional.Sure it had great, multi-layered characters, brought to life by a great cast;AJ Bowen is especially making a name for himself in the indie horror scene.It had a solid plot about a girl starting a new life, and her ex... who happens to be a serial killer tracking her down,told in the chronologically chaotic fashion that has been all the rage since Pulp Fiction cemented itself into pop-cutlure.But something was missing.Well three things:Charm.It didn't have the charm of his previous flicks. The smoke had cleared, and the fiasco was visible.Pacing.It's slow, and wastes time on pointless scenes that don't serve any purpose other than to lengthen runtime, all while the camera zooms and pans like a coked-up jitterbug.Entertainment.It's dull.  Which is unforgivable.Personally, I can overlook all of its other flaws so long as it was entertaining, and it just wasn't.It's not without its merits, and might appeal to some who cling to the term ""slow burn"" like it's some kind of excuse, but it's not without its flaws.Some might find it deep, and rich with characters whose story lines interweave creating a bloodstained tapestry.But I ultimately just found it boring.This might have been due to the script by Simon Barrett whose other flick ""Dead Birds"" I also found dull.So I'll chalk it up to that, because deep down I still want to love Wingard, because Home Sick holds such a special place in my heart.Even so I look forward to Wingard & Barrett's next collaboration ""You're Next, even if a little more tentatively than others.",3,I Miss the Old Adam Wingard,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,2481,"['miss', 'old', 'Adam', 'Wingard.When', 'first', 'came', 'scene', 'Home', 'Sick', 'was', 'blown', 'clean', 'outta', 'socks', 'window', 'front', 'porch.A', 'gory', 'slasher', 'almost', 'wandered', 'around', 'haze', 'doing', 'everything', 'right.His', 'follow-up', 'Pop', 'Skull', 'wandered', 'same', 'dream-like', 'stupor', 'conversely', 'accomplished', 'very', 'little.In', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything.I', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'suspicion', 'maybe', 'Home', 'Sick', 'was', 'fluke.Then', 'released', 'A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'previous', 'two', 'entries', 'deeper', 'more', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'characters', 'seemed', 'haze', 'had', 'cleared', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'as', 'experimental', 'once', 'was.It', 'was', 'had', 'evolved', 'different', 'filmmaker', 'entirely.A', 'more', 'professional', 'filmmaker.Now', 'may', 'seem', 'good', 'thing', 'almost', 'felt', 'betrayal.Everything', 'third', 'feature', 'length', 'flick', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'conventional.Sure', 'had', 'great', 'multi-layered', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'great', 'cast', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'especially', 'making', 'name', 'indie', 'horror', 'scene.It', 'had', 'solid', 'plot', 'girl', 'starting', 'new', 'life', 'ex', 'who', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'tracking', 'down', 'told', 'chronologically', 'chaotic', 'fashion', 'been', 'rage', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'cemented', 'pop-cutlure.But', 'something', 'was', 'missing.Well', 'three', 'things', 'Charm.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'charm', 'previous', 'flicks', 'smoke', 'had', 'cleared', 'fiasco', 'was', 'visible.Pacing.It', 'slow', 'wastes', 'time', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'lengthen', 'runtime', 'camera', 'zooms', 'pans', 'coked-up', 'jitterbug.Entertainment.It', 'dull', 'Which', 'unforgivable.Personally', 'can', 'overlook', 'other', 'flaws', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'entertaining', 'just', ""wasn't.It"", 'not', 'merits', 'might', 'appeal', 'who', 'cling', 'term', 'slow', 'burn', 'kind', 'excuse', 'not', 'flaws.Some', 'might', 'find', 'deep', 'rich', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'interweave', 'creating', 'bloodstained', 'tapestry.But', 'ultimately', 'just', 'found', 'boring.This', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'script', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'other', 'flick', 'Dead', 'Birds', 'also', 'found', 'dull.So', ""'ll"", 'chalk', 'up', 'deep', 'still', 'want', 'love', 'Wingard', 'Home', 'Sick', 'special', 'place', 'heart.Even', 'look', 'forward', 'Wingard', 'Barrett', 'next', 'collaboration', ""'re"", 'Next', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'tentatively', 'others']",N/A

Very artsy and low-budget feel to it, but the build up is so slow and the end is not the payoff you expect.The cinematography is grainy and tinted, making a cool visual effect.  The film looks different from other thrillers.  The unsteady camera, crazy angles, and focusing/unfocusing was interesting at first, then disorienting, but ultimately annoying.  The crazy slow pace and dull story is covered by this distracting visual effect.  Nothing much happened throughout the film.  The slow pace made details of the plot slow and deliberate.  Good story telling measure, if there is a story to tell.  But this one lagged on until finally, the crazy camera tricks stopped and the climactic ending quickly twisted into the end.  It was rather quick and simple compared to the build up and the intense preceding scene.The acting was good, but nothing stellar.  And the story was the same: like so many others, it is an interesting take on a well-known concept, but it is not so revolutionary.It is a quiet film of mostly dialogue and little action with only a few scenes of violence and nudity, just so you know.

1443319,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0055V0K3G,David Girod,"[0, 0]","First, let me state...BEWARE OF SPOILERS! I promise to keep my review spoiler free, but ""A Horrible Way to Die"" is best viewed without too much info going into it.""A Horrible Way to Die"" is not a straight forward horror film. When I picked this up, with a title like ""A Horrible Way to Die"" I expected a ""Saw"" rip-off. You know one of those body count movies where hapless teens get hacked apart by a masked killer using a variety of garden tools? (Which I love BTW!) No, ""A Horrible Way to Die"" falls more into the ""thriller"" catagory. Sure, there are some blood-soaked scenes, but the killings are not the central focus of the tale.When a young woman turns her psychotic and murderous boyfriend into the police, she tries to move onto the next chapter of her life, hoping to forget that she was once in love with a homicidal maniac. Unfortunately just as things begin to turn around for her, her former beau escapes custody and comes looking for her.I really liked the idea behind ""A Horrible Way to Die"", and the two leads do a really good job.

Serial killer movies, those depicting the real deal and otherwise, are a dime a dozen, and there are hundreds of them out there. It's really hard to do something new, but I think that was accomplished well here. Following the killer and the life he affected is great because his ex-girlfriend is seriously damaged and watching her go through all the trauma in her present day and then further through flashbacks is really well done. The acting is really good, especially by AJ Bowen, who plays the killer wonderfully. He always nails these roles but I hope he doesn't get typecast because he has some serious skill.

1443326,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B0055V0K3G,E. David Swan,"[16, 18]","I was so excited to get this film. The title of my review would be `A Horrible Film to Watch'. All I had to do now was sit through this direct to video dreck and then slap out a review. Problem is the movie wasn't bad and I had to shelve my snarky review title. Sure it has problems but by and large I think it's successful in achieving the director's vision (for better or for worse).The story basically follows two threads. First, we follow serial killer Garrick Turrell as he escapes police capture and resumes his killing spree. We actually spend quite a bit of time with the killer and it's clear that he's tortured [so to speak] by his own evil acts even as he commits them. This could have been handled in an eye rolling manner but I thought it was actually done quite well. AJ Bowen gives a pretty good performance as a self loathing killer. In fact I thought the casting overall was well done. The other storyline follows a pair of recovering alcoholics, Sarah and Kevin, who begin a relationship after they meet at an AA meeting. Based on the title I assumed that at some point Sarah, Kevin and Garrick would meet and someone, maybe everyone, would die horribly. It wasn't something I looked forward to since the director did a good job of making Sarah and Kevin both believable and sympathetic. My concern was that the director was just setting the audience up for an extended, cringe worthy torture scene. I won't spill the beans on what happens but the ending was not as I predicted.So where does the movie go wrong? The photography is vomit inducing. The camera pans in, the camera pans out, we get weird little cuts and sometimes it feels like the cameraman just sort of gently goes to sleep as the camera slowly falls away. Most scenes end with the camera losing focus causing me eyestrain. The romantic scenes were filmed through Christmas lights creating obnoxious light globes on the screen. I guess this is supposed to be some kind of voyeur cam as if the viewer is watching the events from a hidden location but my vision doesn't constantly go out of focus and my head doesn't shake like I'm having an epileptic seizure.If you're looking for blood and gore this is not the movie for you and I think the film is better for it. In fact it's generally quite tame given the subject matter. If you can get past the horrible and amateurish camera work it's actually an intriguing film with an unexpected and satisfying ending. Many of the scenes are presented out of chronological order which is somewhat confusing but works fairly well to keep the audience off balance. This isn't Silence of the Lambs quality stuff here but for a direct to video film it's pretty good. Now if director Adam Wingard can just stop with the artsy film editing and camera work he might be able to make something suitable for the big screen.BTW: I love Wikipedia's description of the plot, ""A movie about a boy and his journey when he makes a deal with the devil.

Still it had peeked my interest enough so that I wanted to give it a shot. After the viewing I was pleasantly surprised by how good this film was. It has problems of course but over all I liked it.The movie is about Sarah and her ex Garrick, thing is her ex is a serial killer. So the film follows both with Sarah on her own and Garrick escaping from prison. The paths they take of course are very different. She is a recovering alcoholic trying to get over her past with him. He is still the same guy he was before and continues his killing spree, but it seems he does some how hate himself for doing all this. So while he is making his way back to her she is trying to forget about him. In doing so she meets a guy at the AA meetings and starts up a relationship with him. How will these parties come together?I have to say that this film was really well written by producer Simon Barrett as all the characters were very believable. Director Adam Wingard did a good job with this film as the pace is slow but not enough to bore you. In fact I think that actually added to the character development in many ways. We get to know these people and may actually care about them by the end of it. I am actually looking forward to seeing his next flick ""Your Next"".As I am sure you have heard or read by now that the only problem here is the camera work. Now I will say that it didn't bother me has much as it did others but it could have been better. I get what they were trying to go for here with the style, more of a realistic feel. The only thing is it seems that they over did it and annoyed some people. Sure I didn't care for all of the camera movements but over all I don't think it affected it that much.Of course the acting here was good with every one being really believable, particularly AJ Bowen who played Garrick the killer. He next appears in the aforementioned ""Your Next"", but you may know him form ""The Signal, Creepshow 3, Hatchet 2"" among others.

1443329,A1H8JUI9GNQKNR,B0055V0K3G,Harold Harefoot,"[0, 0]","There are things I like about this movie.  The acting is good.  The story is fairly original.  I'm giving it a lot of points for being an original story.  Those are hard to find these days. Almost everything made these days in movies and tv has been done over and over again already.  This story is something I haven't seen before.  Sure, there are plenty of movies about serial killers, but not that many about the serial killer's girlfriend - and that's what this one is about.  She is the star of the movie.  All of the guys, including her boyfriend, are basically her supporting actors.  OK, now we come to one of the things I didn't like.  Her acting was really good for most of the movie, but there are a couple of scenes - and maybe this wasn't her fault (could have been bad editing or bad recording) where she was talking and I couldn't understand a word she was saying.  It was obvious she was upset, so I got that anyway.  However, it would have been nice to hear what she was actually saying at the time.  The OTHER thing I really did NOT like, and this is why I knocked at least one star off of the rating, is the ""Blair Witch"" shaky cam work.  That has been so overused since that movie, I can't describe how much I can't stand it, but ESPECIALLY when it's as overdone as it is in this movie.  Sometimes the camera is shaking so much that you really can't tell what's happening.  There have been movies like ""Cloverfield"", for instance, that have used the same effect, but do it much less blatently and therefore, much more effectively.  So, my bottom line on this film is that it has a really good script with a fairly original story; but the technical aspects of the film, in terms of the audio and the visuals really distract from the story rather than adding to it (as I'm sure the film-makers had intended).",3,not sure how to rate this movie.,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,1826,"['are', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'acting', 'good', 'story', 'fairly', 'original', ""'m"", 'giving', 'lot', 'points', 'being', 'original', 'story', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'days', 'Almost', 'everything', 'made', 'days', 'movies', 'tv', 'been', 'done', 'over', 'again', 'already', 'story', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'not', 'many', 'serial', 'killer', 'girlfriend', 'what', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'guys', 'including', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'basically', 'supporting', 'actors', 'OK', 'now', 'come', 'one', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'most', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'editing', 'bad', 'recording', 'where', 'was', 'talking', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'was', 'saying', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'upset', 'got', 'anyway', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'saying', 'time', 'OTHER', 'thing', 'really', 'did', 'NOT', 'why', 'knocked', 'least', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'shaky', 'cam', 'work', 'been', 'so', 'overused', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'ESPECIALLY', 'when', 'as', 'overdone', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'camera', 'shaking', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'Cloverfield', 'instance', 'have', 'used', 'same', 'effect', 'do', 'much', 'less', 'blatently', 'therefore', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'So', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'script', 'fairly', 'original', 'story', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'terms', 'audio', 'visuals', 'really', 'distract', 'story', 'rather', 'adding', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film-makers', 'had', 'intended']",N/A

It just muddles along and along never really getting anywhere until the end.  There is very little suspense, no mystery and a rather ill-advised twist that resulted in a complete mess of a movie.  In this movie, we have a serial killer who has escaped from prison and begins to hack his way in search of his ex-girlfriend who helped to put him away.  The girlfriend, Sarah, is a recovering alcoholic and begins a relationship with someone in her AA group.  It seems like the creators of this flick just did not know what to do with this film, and while they obviously hold great store in their twist in the end, it is very ill-conceived.  In short, there is nothing scary or even remotely interesting in this dull, boring and lifeless script.The execution of this film is very poor as the movie has no atmosphere whatsoever.  The only thing that the movie a good job with is the use of setting, but the movie just never really gets off the ground.  It's clear that the makers of this film wanted the audience to think one way over the entire boring film and then just surprise you with the ending, but the ending doesn't really satisfy the viewer, and the audience comes away cheated.

We see two people agonizing over what they are doing, a male serial killer who feels compelled to kill and a female driven to drink. We see each of them groaning, sighing, moaning, crying, breathing heavily, as they think about what they have done, how it is destroying them, and the agony and difficulty each is having trying to gain control and stop killing and drinking. The female is controlling her drive, but with difficulty, but the male is unable to do so.

1443332,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B0055V0K3G,James Morris,"[1, 1]","I am not a huge fan of gory horror films.  Gratuitous violence and torture does not entertain me, in fact, it usually turns me off completely.  That probably has something to do with the fact that many so-called horror films today have no plot, nothing in the way of acting, and even less character development.  Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but if I am to be expected to enjoy a good suspense film, I have to feel something about someone to care whether or not their head is blown off, and watching 25 non-actors in a row spill their guts all over the screen in the first 25 minutes is just disgusting, and generally bores me to tears.  But I am a video collector, and on the rare occasions when I get offered a DVD through Amazon Vine, I almost always jump at it, even if it's not in the genre or mode that I most enjoy.I confess I didn't expect much from A Horrible Way to Die.  I cheated a little and sought out some reviews on it before I watched it, trying to glean if it was something I might want to put off permanently.  Many viewers complained that there wasn't enough blood and gore and several felt that the constant flashbacks and jerky, hand-held camera movements were a turn off.  But my roommate said he was in the mood for a thriller, so we threw it on and hoped for the best.I quickly found myself getting caught up in the story.  Sarah (Amy Seimetz) as the former girlfriend of a serial killer exhibited just the right mix of shyness and tentative, plaintive attempts to come out her shell.  Sarah is in a witness protection program, having turned in her serial killer boyfriend after discovering his gruesome secret.  A. J. Bowen as Garrick Turrell was creepy yet somehow eerily familiar as the man who can't seem to get through a day without killing someone, usually pretty young ladies he befriends, abducts and then disarms by telling them, ""You're going to be just fine.  I won't hurt you - don't worry..."" shortly before he strangles them or slits their throats.  Meanwhile, Sarah, an alcoholic who was always too drunk to question why her boyfriend was always going out late at night, discovers the horrible truth about him in a series of lazy flashbacks that reveal quite a bit about both her and Garrick.Garrick is now in jail and Sarah has gotten sober in A.A. and is just finding herself involved with a nice, sober guy from her group when word comes that Garrick has escaped from jail and could be anywhere in the country.  Naturally, she's scared, and there are all kinds of suspense and blood as Garrick eludes roadblocks and kills random people as he travels slowly and of course inevitably towards the Midwestern town where Sarah is hiding out.The rest of the story offered a few surprises, but not if one is paying attention to all that the taut script has to say about the divergent personalities of Sarah and Garrick.  The film had just enough gore and definitely a good deal of suspense, and kept us interested right up until the climatic ending.  My friend and I had two different guesses on exactly how it might end and we were both pleasantly surprised when it turned out that both of us was each partly right.  Fans of a certain style of brutal serial killer movies are likely to be disappointed, but if you like good suspense and (gasp) getting to know the victims before they meet their end, you might just enjoy A Horrible Way to Die.",4,Not a Bad Way To Spend An Evening,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,3376,"['am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'gory', 'horror', 'films', 'Gratuitous', 'violence', 'torture', 'not', 'entertain', 'fact', 'usually', 'off', 'completely', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'many', 'so-called', 'horror', 'films', 'today', 'have', 'plot', 'nothing', 'way', 'acting', 'even', 'less', 'character', 'development', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'old-fashioned', 'am', 'be', 'expected', 'enjoy', 'good', 'suspense', 'film', 'have', 'feel', 'something', 'someone', 'care', 'not', 'head', 'blown', 'off', 'watching', '25', 'non-actors', 'row', 'spill', 'guts', 'screen', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'just', 'disgusting', 'generally', 'tears', 'am', 'video', 'collector', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'get', 'offered', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'almost', 'always', 'jump', 'even', 'not', 'genre', 'mode', 'most', 'enjoy.I', 'confess', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'cheated', 'little', 'sought', 'out', 'reviews', 'watched', 'trying', 'glean', 'was', 'something', 'might', 'want', 'put', 'off', 'permanently', 'Many', 'viewers', 'complained', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'blood', 'gore', 'several', 'felt', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'jerky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'movements', 'were', 'turn', 'off', 'roommate', 'said', 'was', 'mood', 'thriller', 'threw', 'hoped', 'best.I', 'quickly', 'found', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'Sarah', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'serial', 'killer', 'exhibited', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'shyness', 'tentative', 'plaintive', 'attempts', 'come', 'out', 'shell', 'Sarah', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'having', 'turned', 'serial', 'killer', 'boyfriend', 'discovering', 'gruesome', 'secret', 'A.', 'J.', 'Bowen', 'Garrick', 'Turrell', 'was', 'creepy', 'yet', 'somehow', 'eerily', 'familiar', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'day', 'killing', 'someone', 'usually', 'pretty', 'young', 'ladies', 'abducts', 'then', 'disarms', 'telling', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'shortly', 'slits', 'throats', 'Meanwhile', 'Sarah', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'too', 'drunk', 'question', 'why', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'out', 'late', 'night', 'horrible', 'truth', 'series', 'lazy', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'quite', 'bit', 'Garrick.Garrick', 'now', 'jail', 'Sarah', 'gotten', 'sober', 'A.A.', 'just', 'finding', 'involved', 'nice', 'sober', 'guy', 'group', 'when', 'word', 'Garrick', 'escaped', 'jail', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'country', 'Naturally', 'scared', 'are', 'kinds', 'suspense', 'blood', 'Garrick', 'roadblocks', 'kills', 'random', 'people', 'slowly', 'course', 'inevitably', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'where', 'Sarah', 'hiding', 'out.The', 'rest', 'story', 'offered', 'few', 'surprises', 'not', 'one', 'paying', 'attention', 'taut', 'script', 'say', 'divergent', 'personalities', 'Sarah', 'Garrick', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'enough', 'gore', 'definitely', 'good', 'deal', 'suspense', 'kept', 'interested', 'right', 'up', 'climatic', 'ending', 'friend', 'had', 'two', 'different', 'guesses', 'exactly', 'how', 'might', 'end', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'partly', 'right', 'Fans', 'certain', 'style', 'brutal', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'like', 'good', 'suspense', 'gasp', 'getting', 'know', 'victims', 'meet', 'end', 'might', 'just', 'enjoy', 'A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die']",N/A

Her ex-boyfriend, Garrick Turrell, is a highly celebrated serial killer; her testimony locked him away.  Now she attends AA meetings and is dating a cute guy, Kevin.  Unfortunately, Sarah is plunged into a gruesome nightmare when Garrick escapes from prison  As the corpses of his murdered victims pile up in Ted Bundy fashion, she begins to fear for her safety.  Will Kevin be able to protect Sarah from Garrick?What a horrible shame.  ""A Horrible Way to Die"" had so much potential.  Unfortunately, the final product screamed, ""Amateur!"" and ""Low budget!""  The famous, groundbreaking ""Halloween"" (Halloween [Blu-ray]) of the seventies was low budget but I never would have known if film critics hadn't informed me.  For a slasher/serial killer film, the plot for ""Horrible"" is inventive; gruesome killings, a high body count and a shocking ending make this movie highly marketable.  Unfortunately, poor casting, sloppy camera work, clich&eacute;d dialogue and subpar acting have harmed it considerably.A major hunk should've portrayed Garrick who had supposedly received marriage proposals in prison.  For example, the handsome Pavan Grover portrayed the sensual, seductive serial killer, Jesse Mowatt, of ""Unspeakable"" (Unspeakable).  When A. J. Bowen's character, Garrick, strips naked in preparation for transportation out of prison, I thought I would gag.  Joe Swanberg, on the other hand, had nice buttocks.  Appearing pretty and vulnerable, Amy Seimetz was appropriate for her role as Sarah.As far as film work/photography is concerned, vigorously shaking the camera during scene transitions only annoyed and irritated me.  Blurring the picture as though the camera is out of focus didn't work either.  The Christmas lights in the bedroom and at the AA meetings were inappropriate unless it was truly Christmas, which it wasn't.  On the other hand, the cold, snow environs emphasized and supported the film's chilling, depressing atmosphere.The only extra features on the DVD are a short ""making of"" featurette, approximately seven minutes long, titled ""Behind the Scenes of `A Horrible Way to Die'"" and ""Audio Commentary with Director/Editor Adam Wingard and Writer/Producer Simon Barrett.""  The making of featurette showed the filming of certain graphic, violent scenes such as the knife entering a man's open mouth via his throat.  However, no explanations are offered.  I didn't learn anything more about the plot by watching this short featurette; it merely teased me.The audio commentary was tasteless and redundant.  Most of the time, Wingard and Barrett cursed and complained about how difficult it was to make the film because they didn't have any money.  Most of the crew were used as extras.  The film was shot on location in the hometown of either Wingard or Barrett because they could beg people they knew to shoot at their businesses for free.  The Christmas lights, I learned, were used because the art budget was nil.  All the audio commentary accomplished was to confirm what I had already suspected: the production costs were virtually nonexistent.There are not any trailers, deleted scenes, alternate endings, bloopers, etc.  There are, however, Spanish subtitles and English subtitles for those of us, like myself, who are hearing impaired.  The aspect ratio is 1.78:1 and has been formatted for a widescreen television.  I'm surprised that Anchor Bay didn't give ""Horrible"" a better release on DVD.  They once had a reputation for releasing only the best in high quality contemporary and classic horror.  Unfortunately, they now seem to print most anything, even if it's a homemade film made by amateurs.""A Horrible Way to Die"" would have been a tense, psychological horror thriller if the direction, camera work and acting had been more professional.  Unfortunately, it never rises above the mire of mediocrity.  Slasher fans will want to watch this film for the shocking ending; however, I strongly recommend that it be rented.  I thought Anchor Bay's recent release of ""Bereavement"" (Bereavement [Blu-ray]) was so much more entertaining and professional than ""Horrible.""

First of all, there is absolutely nothing scary about it. To try to put us in a scary, disoriented mood, the camera(which is mostly hand held) is deliberately shaken in pretty much every scene, with the exception of shots that require a mounted camera, like the driving scenes. All that does is annoy us, not scare us. The story is also poorly told, using actors that look alike to make it even harder to follow the story. It was not even clear that the story progressed in normal time, or was it presented with lots of flashbacks? Things clear up a bit in the final scene(half of which is shot upside down to annoy us further). Some dialog doesn't make sense, like two doctor's nurses discussing a date night in front of a patient. I gave this movie one extra star because there was some talent involved and it was not their fault, like the actors, and technical staff(even the camera work would be OK if they were instructed not to shake the camera). Avoid this movie at all costs. If you get it as a gift, never speak to the gifter again, and try to unload this DVD on someone you want to punish.

It follows a recovering alcoholic and her serial-killer ex-boyfriend. It was decent and may have been a 3 star flick, but it's held back by some significant technical flaws.What did I like? There were two scenes that made me say ""wow"". I enjoyed the twisted ending. And the music was great, although out of place at times. Acting was good, most of the time.What did I dislike? This movie barely has any thrills or frights to be classified as a supposed horror/thriller. It felt a bit long, even with its already short length. The storytelling also jumps around a lot, and it can leave you slightly lost. It has very annoying transitions that are always blurry for several seconds. Also, the cameraman is constantly moving; every scene has the camera bouncing and swinging for no particular reason.Overall, it was an okay movie. I do not recommend directly paying for this movie. As of 7/12/12, A Horrible Way To Die is available on Netflix Streaming, so stream it if you really want to watch it and save your money.This movie has nudity and sex (not clearly seen because of the cameraman), and excessive blood and gore.

First things first though.I went into A Horrible Way to Die thinking it was going to be another torture porn film with enough blood and guts to make John Carpenter blush and Uwe Boll actually retire knowing he couldn't sink any lower.  Let's face it, it's next to impossible for horror filmmakers to create anything truly unique anymore as almost every horror film seems to give direct homage, whether intentional or not, to a predecessor or two.  Director Adam Wingard, with unforgettable(??) titles like Home Sick and Pop Skull, attempts something new by portraying an escaped serial killer tracking down his ex-girlfriend... who is also a recovering alcoholic.  Wingard depicts the serial killer sympathetically as even the character seems haunted and remorseful of his actions but... keeps on doing it anyway (Mr. Brooks, anyone?).An interesting idea given we're force-fed nothing but over-the-top torture porn with no reason other than to satisfy a disgusting appetite for grotesque imagery.  In fact, the film seems to go out of its way to keep things pretty tame and power to Wingard for it.  You also get a certain sense of connection to the couple being trailed by the killer and hope nothing bad comes to them.However, despite my praise to the story and screenplay, going back to the camerawork... it just ruined everything.  I have never felt so seasick in my life as the camerawork was so shakey that I literally had to ingest some Dramamine to keep my balance.  Realistic shots, like those from Paranormal Activity or Black Hawk Down are a nice touch, but too much can confuse the viewer if not make them sick.  The plot would literally pass me by because I was nauseated by the camera jumping about like a pinball.The cameras were also constantly out of focus if not downright blurry.  Perhaps this was intention to keep the gore and violence level tame, but all it did was make an already nauseous audience more confused and sick.  It's almost as if the film took the bold move of NOT including the audience.  It ruined the movie.All in all, Horrible Way to Die had great potential but was lost on really shoddy camerawork, whether intentional or not.

If you stop to look at a picture even if it is just to go yuck!  Then it is not a bad piece of art.""  I thought that was a good idea when it came to movies.  I remember the good ones and oh, I do remember the bad ones, but I have seen hundreds of movies that I can't remember what they were about.  It is because of this statement that this piece of trash gets a two stars.The first thing that stands out about this ""movie"" is the way it is made.  Think of a low budget slasher movie filmed in the manner of an art house movie complete wilth wierd camera angles and abstract acting.  You know something from Sweden or maybe France.  Well that is the idea, but the filming is a mess.  It is filmed with a hand held camera with up close shots of ears or hands, all the while the camera is shaking so bad that you get sea sick.  The color of the film is muted and dull as to convey a depressed feeling.  It does that I was depressed just watching it. The transitions are blur outs and there are too many of them.Christmas Lights!!!! These are used here in several scenes just to annoy the viewer.  For example in the ""sex"" scenes the lights are just a blur but they are in the fore ground and the action is blocked by them to the point that you can't see things[ a blessing].The serial killer show remorse before killing and this is to......oh I don't know what it is for, maybe to make us feel sorry for him. Oh yes he has a beard, then he doesn't, then he does, then doesn't, .....confused the hell out of me.  OH OH OH that reminds me, his escape from a transport van guarded by two cops and handcuffed, He sees a screw on the floor of the police van then the next scene we see him running free and with two dead cops laying on the street.  Cool right???The ending is is disgusting or revolting, BUT it is totallly unexpected.  This doesn't mean that it is good, oh hell no.  While ""shocking"" it is really disgusting.

The film is slow-moving and when the violence happens, it really is shocking to be sure, but in between all that is some inane dialogue and pedestrian acting.  A.J. Bowen, who gave such a memorable performance in The Signal, is definitely the best thing about the film, as he manages to convey a degree of sympathy while demonstrating an ever so sublte degree of menace at the same time without being hammy.

He has escaped from custody and is on the trail of his former girlfriend, Sarah, a recovering alcoholic trying to reclaim a normal life. Numerous bodies litter the landscape as he tracks her down, but these are generally shot in an understated way, neither glorified nor horrifying (in the sense of shocking to the audience). Indeed, this film struck me as almost a character study of two people who just happen to be a serial killer and his ex. At the same time, there is indeed a heck of a twist at the end that the film builds up to all along.My reference to Blair Witch refers to the camerawork.

The acting is fair. It is not a high budget film, but this is not the issue. It is more how the story is put together. I found it to be a little ""patchwork"", which was a little frustrating. Moving from scene to scene appeared confusing and even some of the characters at first were undifferentiated, just in physical features.The atmosphere of the film was generally gray which gave a dismal feeling throughout the film. Granted we are seeing a type of horror film, or at best, more of a thriller, however, it did not lend itself to a gritty sense or an eerie or scary mood. Instead it left it felt one-note throughout. The emotional component just was not there on any level, so interest in the characters were left at a distance.

There is no real horror and nothing thrilling.What we have is an indy style film, much of which appears to be shot as hand held (though not as shaky as Blair Witch) and with often poor lighting.  The sound track is completely forgettable.  But the movie?Well the script started off with a good idea - ex-girlfriend of a serial killer is trying to get over her past and move on with life in a new town.  She was unfortunate enough to come across his grisly leftovers and is the reason he is in prison.  Well she finds a new man and suddenly her ex breaks out of prison and is on a killing spree headed her way.Like I said... seems interesting enough.  But the reality of it is that we have a long drawn out drama of our leading female dealing with her problems.  Flashing backward and forward in time, and back and forth between our serial killer and his ex for some reason this movie loses it's cohesiveness.  What should be building tension ends up just boring.  Our killer is uninteresting, and I didn't find the gore to be anything worse than ""Silence of the Lambs"" only less realistic.  It felt like the crew was going for ""somber and understated"" but that only works if you can keep our attention.If this film had simply followed our leading lady and left the serial killer out, they could have had a good lifetime drama.  If they had added some meat to our killer and followed him we might have had a fun slasher... but what we end up with is something too bland for the horror crew and too bloody for the drama crew.And for the twist ending... I wasn't impressed, as soon as the twist was revealed the movie can be shut off because it plays out exactly as expected.

It turns out that aside from a few flashes, I'd totally misremembered the bit I'd seen; I'm not sure whether that says more about the movie or me, but I found a great deal of it about as forgettable this time round. I've been a big fan of Adam Wingard's ever since I caught Home Sick, his first feature (viz. review 7Feb09). A Horrible Way to Die, Wingard's third feature, feels like an attempt to branch out. In that sense, it's an admirable thing. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it worked.Plot: Garrick Turrell (The House of the Devil's AJ Bowen), a serial killer, seizes an opportunity and manages to escape from prison. He's on his way home  to his ex-girlfriend Sarah (Tiny Furniture's Amy Seimetz), now a recovering alcoholic trying to get on with her life, taking the first tentative steps toward romance with fellow ex-drunk Kevin (Kissing on the Mouth's Joe Swanberg). Unfortunately, Garrick popping up could certainly throw a monkeywrench into those plans...The biggest problem with the movie is scriptwriter Simon Barrett (DeadBirds)'s attempt to tell the story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion. (He tries to keep the viewer grounded by changing Garrett's facial hair at the center of the fragmented time period; it does work, in a limited fashion, once you've seen the scene where Garrett shaves.) This isn't Memento; it's a genre horror film, big twist ending, naked dead bodies, gratuitous violence, and all, and it would have benefitted from simply being a genre horror film. It's not a terrible thing as is, but I got the feeling a number of times as I watched that a simple presentation would have become the material a great deal better than what we ended up with. ** ",3,"Good intentions, mediocre execution.",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2058,"['Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'Adam', 'Wingard', '2010', 'Note', 'movie', 'was', 'provided', 'free', 'charge', 'Amazon', 'Vine.I', 'started', 'watching', 'A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'time', 'ago', 'got', 'sidetracked', 'only', 'got', 'back', 'round', 'finishing', 'tonight', 'quite', 'while', 'later', 'year', 'later', 'memory', 'serves', 'went', 'back', 'beginning', 'watched', 'entire', 'thing', 'again', 'out', 'aside', 'few', 'flashes', ""'d"", 'totally', 'misremembered', 'bit', ""'d"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'more', 'movie', 'found', 'great', 'deal', 'as', 'forgettable', 'time', 'round', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'ever', 'caught', 'Home', 'Sick', 'first', 'feature', 'viz', 'review', '7Feb09', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'Wingard', 'third', 'feature', 'feels', 'attempt', 'branch', 'out', 'sense', 'admirable', 'thing', 'Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'worked.Plot', 'Garrick', 'Turrell', 'House', 'Devil', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'serial', 'killer', 'opportunity', 'manages', 'escape', 'prison', 'way', 'home', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'now', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'taking', 'first', 'tentative', 'steps', 'romance', 'fellow', 'ex-drunk', 'Kevin', 'Kissing', 'Mouth', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'Unfortunately', 'Garrick', 'popping', 'up', 'could', 'certainly', 'throw', 'monkeywrench', 'plans', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'scriptwriter', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'DeadBirds', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'fragmented', 'non-linear', 'fashion', 'keep', 'viewer', 'grounded', 'changing', 'Garrett', 'facial', 'hair', 'center', 'fragmented', 'time', 'period', 'work', 'limited', 'fashion', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scene', 'where', 'Garrett', ""n't"", 'Memento', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'big', 'twist', 'ending', 'naked', 'dead', 'bodies', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'simply', 'being', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'terrible', 'thing', 'got', 'feeling', 'number', 'times', 'watched', 'simple', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'material', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'what', 'ended', 'up', '**']",N/A

The story is simple.  Woman's testimony puts charismatic boyfriend serial killer away.  Serial killer escapes and returns to former girlfriend.  In the course of these events, woman picks up a pudgy-faced new boyfriend and tries to get on with her life.  The narrative is slow and often boring.  Many of the dialogues hardly move the plot along.  The climax is almost worth the wait, but one gets the feeling the whole film revolved around those last 5 or 10 minutes or so---and that everything else before it was padding and filler.  The serial killer, played by AJ Bowen, is about the only interesting character in the film.  Everyone else seems to be merely mouthing the lines.

Knox,"[2, 3]","I'll admit that I was not expecting much from this movie; I'd seen quite a few negative reviews, and I'm not crazy about serial killer stories in general. I much prefer classic-type horror fantasies. So, what I thought I'd be seeing was a very cheap-looking and ineptly written film the likes of which are routinely offered in multi-movie DVD boxes. What I did see might just be the best film of its type since HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.To be sure, A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE is a low-budget production. There is a great deal of hand-held camera work, replete with blurs, reflections, unsteadiness, and the like. Some of the dialogue is barely audible at normal levels. Absolutely no one connected with the film is at all familiar to me. The performances are in an offhand, mundane style that seemingly could have been executed by virtually anyone. And the story is pretty basic and simple. But: the extraordinary thing is that all of these characteristics enhance, rather than detract from, the film as a whole. Watching A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE made me feel like a voyeur of sorts. In fact, I can't recall the last movie I've seen that seemed so damnably REAL. And I have seen a great many movies.In the story, a notorious serial killer escapes from police custody and makes his way toward his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, both of whom are attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. This is not a story for those with short attention spans, for on the surface it seems leisurely and even pointless. But- stay with it, and you'll find more than is immediately apparent. Without giving too much away, I must say that I have not seen such an effective climax and ending in many, many years of watching movies. More than any film in recent memory, the ending MAKES this movie.A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE clocks in at a mere 87 minutes- very short by today's standards. The DVD, by horror specialist Anchor Bay, is of their customary fine quality. There is a short behind-the-scenes featurette and audio commentary by Director/Editor Adam Wingard and Writer/Producer Simon Barrett...two names to definitely watch for in the future. Kudos, also, to lead actors AJ Bowen, Amy Seimetz and Joe Swanberg.Take it from an old horror junkie who is fairly hard to please: A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE is far from horrible.

The film promises to be a scary horror film about a brutal escaped serial killer.  I hated the self-conscious photography -- the kind that a recent graduate of film school would use to show off his awareness of the techniques.  These range from lens flares, overuse of the fade-out, shaky camera (for no apparent reason other than to make the viewer seasick), and a deliberately slow pace that dulls any suspense rather than enhances it.The acting is OK, and there are a few surprises along the way, but the movie is ultimately disappointing.  The film's more graphic scenes are shown fleetingly or suggested.  The camera never dwells on the butchered corpses that accumulate along the way, and maybe that's a good thing, but folks who enjoy slasher horror flicks enjoy them precisely because of the stylized gore, not as Academy Award contenders.

I cannot explain why I had this bias, but I did.  I am very happy to say that this movie surprised me.  I found it to be very engaging, different, disturbing and (somewhat) believable.  In other words, I really liked it.To summarize the plot, Sarah (Amy Seimetz) is recently sober and has been attending AA meetings for about four months.  Still waters run deep with Sarah and it is written over her face that there is emotional turbulence plaguing her life.  In her home group she meets Kevin (Joe Swanberg) and an awkward intimacy blooms between the two of them. Meanwhile, Garrick Turrell (AJ Bowen) is an extremely dangerous serial killer who has just escaped from prison and is on the run. As he eludes the authorities he begins killing again.  Garrick's goal is to go after Sarah; she is both his ex-girlfriend and the one who turned him in.I do not want to minimize the plot, but this is basically the story.  I am not attempting to belittle the story, but it isn't very complex.  Notwithstanding, the manner in which the tale unfolds is what makes it unique. The narrative is interwoven; the present and former events are blended together.  A perfect example of this is Sarah working and then going to AA meeting morphs to her being at home with Garrick. The movie isn't very linear.  I actually find non-liner to be very refreshing, yet even I was befuddled at times. As for the violence, it is true dualism in the sense that it is subtle and graphic.  Some of the killings are left to the imagination and others are a splatter fest. This is a movie making ruse I haven't seen before and I welcomed it.I felt the acting in this film was really good.  Amy Seimetz was very believable as the fragile woman with a damaged past.  Sarah was a low key character but I had an investment in what happened to her.  I have only seen AJ Bowen in ""House of the Devil"" (which was a great horror flick) but his performance in that film was a little one dimensional, good but one dimensional. In AHWTD Bowen's acting was very, very layered which gave his antagonist depth.The pace of the movie is slow and at times it is like treacle dripping off a spoon.  Honestly, I didn't mind it because it gave the movie a ""character piece"" feel to it.  However, I could see how it could turn some viewers off.  There were a few scenes that I felt were a bit too winded.Nevertheless, the one aspect that really keeps this film from being a five star movie is the cinematography.  There are more scenes that I can count where the camera goes out of focus for no apparent reason.  In addition there are scenes where characters are talking and the camera just wanders off, drops up, drops down or all of the above. I am not sure if the camera man was somebody's drunken uncle who begged for a job but it was very obnoxious. I am all for ""off the cuff"" camera work but it was ridiculous in this movie.Yet what really seals the deal for this movie is the denouement, it blew me away. How the events all tied to together was marvelous and really set this movie apart from the mindless drones of modern horror cinema.  I would strongly recommend this movie for the horror fan who wants a little drama and a little intelligence with their blood.",4,An intelligent and dramatic film....wait this is a horror movie?,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,3318,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'movie', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'had', 'bias', 'did', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'say', 'movie', 'surprised', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'different', 'disturbing', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'other', 'words', 'really', 'liked', 'it.To', 'summarize', 'plot', 'Sarah', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'recently', 'sober', 'been', 'attending', 'AA', 'meetings', 'four', 'months', 'Still', 'waters', 'run', 'deep', 'Sarah', 'written', 'face', 'emotional', 'turbulence', 'plaguing', 'life', 'home', 'group', 'Kevin', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'awkward', 'intimacy', 'blooms', 'two', 'Meanwhile', 'Garrick', 'Turrell', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'just', 'escaped', 'prison', 'run', 'authorities', 'killing', 'again', 'Garrick', 'goal', 'go', 'Sarah', 'ex-girlfriend', 'one', 'who', 'turned', 'in.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'minimize', 'plot', 'basically', 'story', 'am', 'not', 'attempting', 'belittle', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'complex', 'Notwithstanding', 'manner', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'what', 'unique', 'narrative', 'interwoven', 'present', 'former', 'events', 'are', 'blended', 'together', 'perfect', 'example', 'Sarah', 'working', 'then', 'going', 'AA', 'meeting', 'morphs', 'being', 'home', 'Garrick', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'linear', 'actually', 'find', 'non-liner', 'be', 'very', 'refreshing', 'yet', 'even', 'was', 'befuddled', 'times', 'violence', 'true', 'dualism', 'sense', 'subtle', 'graphic', 'killings', 'are', 'left', 'imagination', 'others', 'are', 'splatter', 'fest', 'movie', 'making', 'ruse', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'welcomed', 'it.I', 'felt', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'fragile', 'woman', 'damaged', 'past', 'Sarah', 'was', 'low', 'key', 'character', 'had', 'investment', 'what', 'happened', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'House', 'Devil', 'was', 'great', 'horror', 'flick', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'one', 'dimensional', 'good', 'one', 'dimensional', 'AHWTD', 'Bowen', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'layered', 'gave', 'antagonist', 'depth.The', 'pace', 'movie', 'slow', 'times', 'treacle', 'dripping', 'off', 'spoon', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'gave', 'movie', 'character', 'piece', 'feel', 'However', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'turn', 'viewers', 'off', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'felt', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'winded.Nevertheless', 'one', 'aspect', 'really', 'film', 'being', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'are', 'more', 'scenes', 'can', 'count', 'where', 'camera', 'focus', 'apparent', 'reason', 'addition', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'talking', 'camera', 'just', 'wanders', 'off', 'up', 'down', 'above', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'camera', 'man', 'was', 'somebody', 'drunken', 'uncle', 'who', 'begged', 'job', 'was', 'very', 'obnoxious', 'am', 'cuff', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'movie.Yet', 'what', 'really', 'deal', 'movie', 'denouement', 'blew', 'away', 'How', 'events', 'tied', 'together', 'was', 'marvelous', 'really', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'mindless', 'drones', 'modern', 'horror', 'cinema', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'little', 'drama', 'little', 'intelligence', 'blood']",N/A

1443365,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0055V0K3G,trashcanman,"[2, 2]","Don't be misled by A Horrible Way to Die's misleading grindhouse-tastic title.  Up until the film's final minutes, there is but one onscreen death, and every Argento fan has seen much worse.  This is not an exploitative B-horror movie filling the screen with blood and death.  This is a slow-burn lead-up that takes two character threads and slowly brings them together into one of the most never-see-it-coming sequence of twists I've ever seen.  Up until then it's not really a thrilling film, and actually seems to suffer from an identity crisis of sorts while leaving questions unanswered (like ""how does seeing a screw on the floor of a police car equal an escape from custody?"") in it's push to get to the finale.  But if you are a fan of serial killer films, I can't honestly say you should pass this one by.  It is a rare original.A Horrible Way to Die is the story of two people.  One, a notorious serial killer with a rabid online fan base, and the other an innocent woman trying to get her life together through Alcoholics Anonymous.  While the killer evades police and racks up his body count while on the road, the woman begins a relatably awkward romance with a fellow recovering alcoholic.  What these two stories have to do with one another, you will have to wait and see.  The film takes it's time slowly filling in backstory and details of the past using flashbacks, but once it gets there AHWTD really earns it's stripes.As serial killer films go, this is one that eschews both the standards of Hollywood and the excesses of slasher and hardcore horror films.  This one is first and foremost about the characters, and the cast does an excellent job of portraying the vulnerability of it's characters.  In fact, at the Fantastic Fest film festival, this film earned not only a Best Screenplay award, but Best Actor and Actress awards as well.  It's not the scariest film or the goriest, but it is definitely different, and that scores a lot of points with me.In spite of the film's uniqueness, AHWTD doesn't always live up to it's award-winning pedigree.  The title is misleading to the point of being baffling given that it is so tame in comparison to the works of guys like Eli Roth, Rob Zombie, Takashi Miike, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, and even Chan Wook Park.  Second, a film shouldn't really feel as slow as this one at a mere 85 minutes.  There's a lot of character work that the actors should be commended for, but much of it is unnecessary to the story, such as the focus on AA.  The climax is intense, delightfully ironic, completely surprising, and really makes this film.  The ending is a little bit abrupt, but it certainly does it's job of really changing the way you look at the killer.Serial killer fanatics should absolutely give this film a watch.  The vulnerability of the leads is outstanding, the finale is sweet, and there is plenty more to like about AHWTD.  Hardcore horror fanatics looking for a cheap-thrill-a-minute with buckets of gore and girl-girl love scenes with hulking killers chasing stumbling teens around  and/or spending minutes on end in graphic torture sequences should definitely give this one a pass.  There is some genuine brutality here, but it is brief and never lingered on or glorified.  Basically, if you've got patience and an appreciation for the original, give this one a shot.3  stars, rounded up for ending with a bang.",4,A different kind of serial killer film,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,3390,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'misleading', 'grindhouse-tastic', 'title', 'film', 'final', 'minutes', 'one', 'onscreen', 'death', 'Argento', 'fan', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'not', 'exploitative', 'B-horror', 'movie', 'filling', 'screen', 'blood', 'death', 'slow-burn', 'lead-up', 'two', 'character', 'threads', 'slowly', 'together', 'one', 'most', 'never-see-it-coming', 'sequence', 'twists', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'not', 'really', 'thrilling', 'film', 'actually', 'suffer', 'identity', 'crisis', 'sorts', 'leaving', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'how', 'seeing', 'screw', 'floor', 'police', 'car', 'equal', 'escape', 'custody', 'push', 'get', 'finale', 'are', 'fan', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'should', 'pass', 'one', 'rare', 'original.A', 'Horrible', 'Way', 'Die', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'One', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'rabid', 'online', 'fan', 'base', 'other', 'innocent', 'woman', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'killer', 'police', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'road', 'woman', 'relatably', 'awkward', 'romance', 'fellow', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'What', 'two', 'stories', 'have', 'do', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'time', 'slowly', 'filling', 'backstory', 'details', 'past', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'once', 'there', 'AHWTD', 'really', 'stripes.As', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'standards', 'Hollywood', 'excesses', 'slasher', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'first', 'foremost', 'characters', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'vulnerability', 'characters', 'fact', 'Fantastic', 'Fest', 'film', 'festival', 'film', 'earned', 'not', 'only', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'awards', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'scariest', 'film', 'goriest', 'definitely', 'different', 'lot', 'points', 'me.In', 'spite', 'film', 'uniqueness', 'AHWTD', ""n't"", 'always', 'live', 'up', 'award-winning', 'pedigree', 'title', 'misleading', 'point', 'being', 'baffling', 'given', 'so', 'tame', 'comparison', 'works', 'guys', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'even', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'Park', 'Second', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'as', 'slow', 'one', 'mere', '85', 'minutes', 'lot', 'character', 'work', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'such', 'focus', 'AA', 'climax', 'intense', 'delightfully', 'ironic', 'completely', 'surprising', 'really', 'film', 'ending', 'little', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'certainly', 'job', 'really', 'changing', 'way', 'look', 'killer.Serial', 'killer', 'fanatics', 'should', 'absolutely', 'give', 'film', 'watch', 'vulnerability', 'leads', 'outstanding', 'finale', 'sweet', 'plenty', 'more', 'like', 'AHWTD', 'Hardcore', 'horror', 'fanatics', 'looking', 'cheap-thrill-a-minute', 'buckets', 'gore', 'girl-girl', 'love', 'scenes', 'hulking', 'killers', 'chasing', 'stumbling', 'teens', 'and/or', 'spending', 'minutes', 'end', 'graphic', 'torture', 'sequences', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'one', 'pass', 'genuine', 'brutality', 'here', 'brief', 'never', 'lingered', 'glorified', 'Basically', ""'ve"", 'got', 'patience', 'appreciation', 'original', 'give', 'one', 'shot.3', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'ending', 'bang']",N/A

I attempted to watch the Director's commentary, but that only made the film seem even more wretched, less inspired. Maybe the very FIRST indication that the film was treading feculant waters, was the cinematography. I love innovation, and for that reason alone I dont wish to give the film a ONE STAR rating. However, one area where innovation was used, for mere pretension, and no other reason, was the way the cinematographer photographed nearly EVERY SCENE. First, he refused to use a steady-cam, but bounced the camera around like a war correspondant pursued by bullets. The set decorator used Christmas lights covering the walls in almost EVERY scene. AA Meeting? USE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS! Old apartment used by the girlfriend and serial killer? MORE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS! Outside a building? Christmas lights. Now, ""WHY"" you may ask? Because almost EVERY SCENE was slowly faded in from extreme out of focus perspectives, so the lights looked like colored globes. THEN, you get the bobbing camera, until the scene is played. When the script ends, the scene FADES OUT with a slow SLOW return back OUT OF FOCUS. Finally, when only blobs of light remain, the camera pans to the floor, and the scene BLACKS OUT. NOW, believe it or not, that WAY-overused device was probibly one of the BETTER qualities of the film. THis is a slasher flick where NOBODY SCREAMS who dies...in fact, everybody just sort of whispers their lines. Watching some of the director's commentary, I found out that this is to be called ""MUMBLE-CORE"", and was very ""post modern"". (I hate pretension. But to use it as a cover over badly planned and executed art, isn't even pretension, just pseudo-intellectualism.) THe writer said he spent A WEEK writing the script. Incredible. Did he spend that much time? THe writing is poor. Apparently there is suppose to be a THEME between the addiction of the girlfriend, and the way the serial killer was ""addicted"" to killing. Since serial killers are psychopaths by definition, they DONT feel dispair, except for maybe their own fall caused by some monsterous wounds inflicted on them during their childhood. BUT NOTHING is given about the serial killer's motives.  From what i could gather from the commentary i could stand listening too (extremely vulgar language consistantly used), there are only 3 or 4 professional actors in this whole film. Given the problems with the whole project, I think the acting was as good as the poor script could allow.  THis film was obviously LO BUDGET all the way. But that doesnt have to mean a low calibre film. Slasher flicks arent usually the highest cinematic art form, but this is film is DOA. Poor directing, bad script, horribe cinematography, random motives in several character's behaviors, along with slow pacing, and no point to the abstract content. About the only thing i can say, is that the film is bad in a WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY than any film I've seen before. No doubt elements of this film, could be good. Some of the editing was interesting, where scenes were assembled out of linear sequence. If the cinematographer's odd OUT OF FOCUS habits, and bouncy camera movements were restrained, or used in some viable context, his work might have interesting. Lots of the soundtrack, in its minimalistic fashion, were appropiately errie. There was an unexpected, mostly unbelievable, plot twist at the end of the film. (tho slasher films have that device as part of their form, dont they?) The overarching wierdness of the film's execution-- the out of focus, bouncing cinematography, the dreamlike sequencing,the slow pacing, the whispering lines the actors deliver--- displays an ""ANTI-HOLLYWOOD"" attitude, that prevents this from being a true ONE STAR film. Bits of a studied, film school quality, and youthful originality shine thru the film's overall slapdash execution. The D.I.Y. attitude, and the willingness to experiment, earns this film an extra star.
