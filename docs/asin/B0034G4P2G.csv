1323073,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0034G4P2G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","In the stunningly realistic Romanian film ""Police, Adjective,"" we get an unadulterated view of mundane beat work and bureaucratic apathy. This is a true police procedural where not everything is a grand case waiting to be broken open. It may be a hard sell, however, for some audiences (especially if they are expecting a more conventional cop film) as almost NOTHING happens in the entire movie. Enormous sections are static and without dialogue and the most excruciatingly uncomfortable dramatic scene features reading the dictionary. Sounds awful and boring, huh? I know. And yet, I absolutely loved this movie--a thrillingly original piece that defies every expectation. I was so impressed after the concluding scene that I immediately went and looked this title up (I caught it on a whim, not knowing anything about it) and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had actually been awarded the prestigious Un Certain Regard Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.The plot is strikingly simple. A young cop (the impressive Dragos Bucur) is assigned to tail a high school student who is suspected of dealing drugs. Most of the movie highlights an isolated Bucur as he watches his target from afar. There is clearly no evidence of dealing, the kid shares an occasional marijuana cigarette with his after school friends but is doing nothing of a nefarious nature. Pushed to make a case, Bucur is resistant. He believes that marijuana will soon be legalized and busting this kid would ruin his life to no purpose. On his own initiative, he attempts to divert attention to more worthy targets but encounters apathy, procedure, and indifference every step of the way. The frustration is palpable as there exist no way to personalize the decidedly institutional department.Again, for a movie whose tension exists in processing reports and stalking alley ways, I found ""Police, Adjective"" to be a highly engaging and believable piece. I'm sure some people will be turned off by the film's stillness and quiet, but it is highly effective in creating the mood. The message and ideological thoughts of the film are expressed as much by the silence as by what is said. And if you're confused by the title, its relevance plays out in an extremely uncomfortable scene where Bucur's boss uses a dictionary to humiliate him. It is an incredibly surprising, unusual, literate, and powerful scene. Ultimately, Bucur's idealism and clinging hope that he can make a small difference must stand up to a system that just doesn't care. As the film maintains its sense of realism, the ending just fits so perfectly with everything that precedes it. Unexpectedly, I absolutely loved this movie! It is, however, geared to more patient or adult audiences that don't mind a film quietly unfolding. KGHarris, 5/11.",5,The Most Realistic Police Movie Ever?

An inexperienced Romanian police detective is assigned to follow three marijuana smoking teenagers and ultimately find a way to arrest the one who is scoring.  The problem is that in Romania, possession is an automatic 7 year prison sentence...so legalization or decriminalization is almost inevitable.  The detective seems willing to pursue the drug source and arrest him for importing it into the country, but his impatient captain seems stubbornly intent on getting the little guy immediately.",3,Simple And Slow Paced,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,603,"['like', 'films', 'require', 'stop', 'dwell', 'how', 'might', 'handle', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'inexperienced', 'Romanian', 'police', 'detective', 'assigned', 'follow', 'three', 'marijuana', 'smoking', 'teenagers', 'ultimately', 'find', 'way', 'arrest', 'one', 'who', 'scoring', 'problem', 'Romania', 'possession', 'automatic', '7', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'so', 'legalization', 'decriminalization', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'detective', 'willing', 'pursue', 'drug', 'source', 'arrest', 'importing', 'country', 'impatient', 'captain', 'stubbornly', 'intent', 'getting', 'little', 'guy', 'immediately']",N/A
1323075,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0034G4P2G,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[7, 9]","A young Romanian detective follows a high school kid -- suspected drug pusher -- as he goes to school, hangs out with friends, and occasionally smokes hash.  After several days of surveillance yield no leads on a supplier or any direct connections to illegal activity other than using, it's clear the kid is mostly harmless.  Sure, he's breaking the law, but Cristi, the detective, knows that most places in Europe possession of marijuana doesn't even warrant arrest, and suspects the law will eventually change in Romania.  While Cristi hesitates, reluctant to take responsibility for ruining the future of a young man, his supervisor wants results, even if it means bringing the kid in for possession, a minor crime, but one that could land him in jail for several years.It's a simple police procedural film, with none of the hype or glamour or intrigue of even the simplest television cop show.  There are no car chases, no shoot outs, no rapid fire montages of strip clubs and shady deals.  The most dangerous weapon wielded in the climactic showdown is a dictionary.  Still, under the masterful direction of Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 East of Bucharest), this simple and deliberately paced film becomes a quite profound and subtle meditation on the essence of language and on the meaning of conscience in a world regulated by law.  While stylistically more direct, the approach of this film and its simple profundity reminded me of the best episodes in Krysztof Kieslowski's remarkableThe Decalogueseries.

1323076,AKI1CK229BDUC,B0034G4P2G,PsyRC,"[2, 3]","Minor spoilers (maybe major, depending on how you look at it)Really won't have too much to say about this one... it was voted best film of the year (2009) by Film Quarterly, something that stood out in a year that had quite a few films I enjoyed.  I did have the impression that for most people, it probably was very slow-paced, although this was not a detriment to me, as more and more it hits me when I watch movies that they can parallel the cadence of reality without being dull.The idea behind the film is that we are trapped in a web of words, the cages that have been structured around us may seem somewhat lax when you look at specific portions of it, but the overall apparatus definitely is much more constraining than it seems, especially when one wants to take moral or spiritual liberties.  The world has become bureaucratic and concrete, everything can be reduced to a verbal description (some would go as far as to say the unconscious is one big web of linguistic elements).  This definitely transforms anything ethereal into an insipid, lifeless description.  The main character (Christi, whose religious and sacrificial connotations never came to fruition) struggles to release himself from the death grip of conformity... he is rendered a slave to linguistics, something he has to question in a displaced manner when ranting to his wife about how the song she listens to makes no sense.Anyway, he fights the powers to be with his sense of ""moral law"", but after being beaten over the head with his own idiosyncratic definitions of morality, he is given the choice between the chaos of a structure-less and self-defining moral code and the concrete, oppressive, mind-shrinking world of the laws of the physical world, which carry the burdensome weight of their own absurdity, gift-wrapped with the guise of wisdom.
