662533,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005LB8C,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Not quite so easy to follow as most of the Cadfael stories, this one relies a little too heavily on there being a great many strangers in Shrewsbury during the fair, and not known to the audience or to the characters. But the general idea was easy enough: during the time of the war between King Stephen and Queen Maud of Wales, it was not always easy to know whose side anyone was on.There are divisive elements involved here. The craftsmen of Shrewsbury must keep their shops closed during the fair, are not allowed to participate in the fair, and demand compensation for their lost revenue from the Abbot. The tolls for the fair booths all go to the Abbey, and that by the King's decree, and the Abbot does not have the right to modify the terms. So the Shrewsbury craftsmen, stirred up by the hot-headed butcher's son, end up in a brawl with the fair merchants.A wine merchant comes to the fair for the dual purpose of selling wine and meeting with a contact; he's a spy, at least in the sense of those days. He's got his beautiful young niece with him. When he is killed, the niece is determined to finish what he started. One could have trusted that meant selling the stocks of wine, but it's pretty clear it meant more than that. But she gives herself away to the observant Cadfael when they return to her caravan and see that it has been tossed, presumably by a robber, but she answers way too quickly that nothing has been taken.Was there some other reason for the brawl??? What was the wine merchant's mission that got him killed? And why did the killer cut out his tongue? Why does the wine merchant's niece keep sneaking off despite Brother Oswin's best efforts to look after her? And why was there a single glove in her caravan that was way too big to be hers, but which she claimed was?And what about this handsome son of the Earl of Chester, come to the fair for the ostensible purpose of buying materials with which to provision a long abandoned home?",4,Loved the Whole Series of Mysteries,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1967,"['Not', 'quite', 'so', 'easy', 'follow', 'most', 'Cadfael', 'stories', 'one', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'being', 'great', 'many', 'strangers', 'Shrewsbury', 'fair', 'not', 'known', 'audience', 'characters', 'general', 'idea', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'time', 'war', 'King', 'Stephen', 'Queen', 'Maud', 'Wales', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'know', 'side', 'anyone', 'was', 'on.There', 'are', 'divisive', 'elements', 'involved', 'here', 'craftsmen', 'Shrewsbury', 'must', 'keep', 'shops', 'closed', 'fair', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'participate', 'fair', 'demand', 'compensation', 'lost', 'revenue', 'Abbot', 'tolls', 'fair', 'booths', 'go', 'Abbey', 'King', 'decree', 'Abbot', 'not', 'have', 'right', 'modify', 'terms', 'Shrewsbury', 'craftsmen', 'stirred', 'up', 'hot-headed', 'butcher', 'son', 'end', 'up', 'brawl', 'fair', 'merchants.A', 'wine', 'merchant', 'fair', 'dual', 'purpose', 'selling', 'wine', 'meeting', 'contact', 'spy', 'least', 'sense', 'days', 'got', 'beautiful', 'young', 'niece', 'When', 'killed', 'niece', 'determined', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'One', 'could', 'have', 'trusted', 'meant', 'selling', 'stocks', 'wine', 'pretty', 'clear', 'meant', 'more', 'away', 'observant', 'Cadfael', 'when', 'return', 'caravan', 'see', 'been', 'tossed', 'presumably', 'robber', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'nothing', 'been', 'taken.Was', 'other', 'reason', 'brawl', 'What', 'was', 'wine', 'merchant', 'mission', 'got', 'killed', 'why', 'did', 'killer', 'cut', 'out', 'tongue', 'Why', 'wine', 'merchant', 'niece', 'keep', 'sneaking', 'off', 'Brother', 'Oswin', 'best', 'efforts', 'look', 'why', 'was', 'single', 'glove', 'caravan', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'big', 'be', 'hers', 'claimed', 'was', 'what', 'handsome', 'son', 'Earl', 'Chester', 'come', 'fair', 'ostensible', 'purpose', 'buying', 'materials', 'provision', 'long', 'abandoned', 'home']",N/A

I also did not like the actor who played the sheriff as much as the usual actor, thought that the story dragged, and I was able to identify the culprit and why he did what he did because it was very like other Cadfael dramas. But, having said this, I still found the story somewhat interesting.",3,"Unfortunately, I agree with the negative reviews",1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,359,"['Unfortunately', 'agree', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'sheriff', 'as', 'much', 'usual', 'actor', 'thought', 'story', 'dragged', 'was', 'able', 'identify', 'culprit', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'very', 'other', 'Cadfael', 'dramas', 'having', 'said', 'still', 'found', 'story', 'somewhat', 'interesting']",N/A

Also I am dreadfully ignorant of English history and I don't have the mind for mysteries.  So take my review with a grain of salt.I loved the setting and the fine characterization of Cadfael by Derek Jacobi.  He was interesting to watch throughout.  I admit that I became confused about the characters early on and didn't have enough interest to rewind to figure them out.As charming as Cadfael was, the heroine, Emma, was lacking in anything to commend her, as far as I could see. The supporting cast was filled with handsome actors with terrific voices....too bad I couldn't remember who was Fowler and who was Glover and then there was Thomas and Hugh and....???  I wasn't sorry when the film was over although some reviewers made me curious to see if others of this series might be better.Anglophiles and mystery lovers will probably love this.
