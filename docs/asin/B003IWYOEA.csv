The first season was extremely bland and boring. Basically Whitney moves to New York and starts working and dating a loser ""musician"" with an accent. He is just as bland and boring as Whitney. I wasn't sure if the series would be renewed for a second season, but it was and it's a good thing because this series is really getting good.There are actually good and entertaining story lines and cast members in season 2. Whitney works at People's Revolution all while being mentored by Kelly Cutrone and starting her own clothing line. Whitney's former co-worker Olivia works at Vogue Magazine and is challenged by her role as ""web cast interview chick"". Conflicts with co-workers and her too forgiving boss arise making her storyline just as entertaining as Whitney's. Olivia's co-worker and enemy Erin breaks out as a strong third main cast member in the series.The City is less about scripted ""drama"" and pointless scenes in clubs where people spat about relationships. It's more about young women working towards achieving their goals in the fashion world. Hopefully the series continues and gets better now that the train wreck known as the last two seasons of The Hills has ended.I have an easier time believing this series than The Hills due to the fact that you can actually see that these girls are working and doing what they do on the show. Hopefully MTV doesn't wreck this show.",4,The second season of the City shows the series potential.,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,1506,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'skeptical', 'decision', 'MTV', 'made', 'give', 'Whitney', 'Port', 'own', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Hills', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'extremely', 'bland', 'boring', 'Basically', 'Whitney', 'New', 'York', 'working', 'dating', 'loser', 'musician', 'accent', 'just', 'bland', 'boring', 'Whitney', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'series', 'really', 'getting', 'good.There', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lines', 'cast', 'members', 'season', '2', 'Whitney', 'People', 'Revolution', 'being', 'mentored', 'Kelly', 'Cutrone', 'starting', 'own', 'clothing', 'line', 'Whitney', 'former', 'co-worker', 'Olivia', 'Vogue', 'Magazine', 'challenged', 'role', 'web', 'cast', 'interview', 'chick', 'Conflicts', 'co-workers', 'too', 'forgiving', 'boss', 'arise', 'making', 'storyline', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Whitney', 'Olivia', 'co-worker', 'enemy', 'Erin', 'out', 'strong', 'third', 'main', 'cast', 'member', 'series.The', 'City', 'less', 'scripted', 'drama', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'clubs', 'where', 'people', 'spat', 'relationships', 'more', 'young', 'women', 'working', 'towards', 'achieving', 'goals', 'fashion', 'world', 'Hopefully', 'series', 'better', 'now', 'train', 'wreck', 'known', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Hills', 'ended.I', 'have', 'easier', 'time', 'believing', 'series', 'Hills', 'due', 'fact', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'girls', 'are', 'working', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'show', 'Hopefully', 'MTV', ""n't"", 'wreck', 'show']",N/A
