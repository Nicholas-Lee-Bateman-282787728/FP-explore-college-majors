I was not very interested in people at parties because nothing I said made sense to them. Now I am 63 and regressing like a crazy man who never got hooked on the addictions that have replaced meaning as a significant part of lives in a failing burst of free activity that makes films a slice of life worth seeing just to find out who was better than the face on the cutting room floor.

I watched it during a free preview weekend, and I suppose I got my money's worth.  I like stoner movies as much as the next person, but this one isn't even in the same league as a Cheech and Chong movie or Half-Baked.  It was not funny, and didn't really go anywhere - and what the hell was with the ending?Jack Black was somewhat funny in his small role, but I didn't even chuckle until the last 10 minutes.  The funniest part was the series of answering machine messages that played during the credits (which I missed part of due to annoying movie channel voiceover ads).  Maybe one has to be stoned to find this movie funny.  However, a good movie will be funny regardless of the number of tokes taken while watching it (watch The Big Lebowski for a good example).I have to agree with the reviewer who said the movie's title was apt because the bongwater is the unwanted leftover.

582841,AT1EDRWEBE5TE,B00005JA9Z,"Jody Schiesser ""interplanetary cowboy""","[4, 9]","I was hoping this film would be better, as the novel it is based on creates a story and world you don't want to have end.  The novel has moments of brilliance, and moments when it fails, and I thought someone creating a film would take the opportunity to expand on the brilliance rather than the mediocre.  Unfortunately that is not the case here.  While there are glimmers of potential, most of the compelling elements of the novel either don't work as presented in this movie or are absent.  The character of Mary in the book was endearing, here in the film she is annoying.  Why change Courtney's name to Serena?  And what's up with the UFO?  There's no UFO in the novel, and it falls entirely flat here, especially when it is shown and is so fake looking.  Sometimes the filmmaking seems lazy, as if a scene is just a bare skeleton, not fleshed out.I'm disappointed.

Little did I ever suspect that it would become one of my favorite silly movies. Bongwater has an incredible cast though it doesn't seem like they had much of a budget. That's why I give it 4 stars as I think some things in the movie could have been fleshed out more. Jack Black is hilarious as the woodsy pot farmer, hence what I titled this review.
