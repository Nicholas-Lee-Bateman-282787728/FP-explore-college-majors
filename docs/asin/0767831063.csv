19733,A4VH04TA14CPE,0767831063,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[5, 5]","The title character in this film poses as an officer in the Soviet army, shortly after World War II. He settles into rooms in big communal apartments in cities; the residents see his uniform and assume he is a war hero, and the landlords have too much sympathy and respect for him to ask him for his papers. One day, he gets all the residents of the apartment tickets to some show, steals everything he can once they leave, and runs off to another city to repeat the process. With him goes a young woman who hopelessly fell for him one day on a train, some time after giving birth to her son alone in a field somewhere. The son accompanies her; we learn that his father never returned from the war.That is the very simple story of Pavel Chukhrai's ""The Thief."" It's also a remarkably powerful story, in many respects. Consider, first, the woman, who absurdly follows the thief across the country, even so far as to try to bribe the officials with her pitiful valuables when the thief is finally caught, even so far as Siberia, where he is eventually sent after that and where she dies of a botched abortion soon after. Consider the opening scene, in the field, where Chukhrai uses close-up shots of her face and hands to show a titanic fortitude, later contrasted with her apparent lack of will. But ""lack of will"" is emphatically _not_ the right term, since the thief does not really force her to stay with him or scare her into staying. Rather, she _wills herself_ to follow the thief and die in the middle of nowhere. That peculiar strength is shown again in her last lines, when she tells her son why she is in the hospital. Where someone else would have been terrified at similar prospects, she explains with devastating understatement, ""Oh, it's nothing, just women's problems.""Consider, second, her son, who grows up both hating and loving the thief, and even calls him ""Father"" by the end despite long having refused to do so. But he also remembers that he once had a real father, and he sees vague images of him in a soldier's overcoat, blurry, because he does not really remember his face. That image is to him everything the thief is not - straightforward honour - but unlike the thief, it is powerless to do a thing to help him. The minimal narration (by the adult Sanya, we understand) adds another dimension of elegy to the proceedings by making them memories rather than immediate events. And, of course, there's the scene with Sanya's tattoos, where we realize that only with the thief's worldview can he get through life, though only without it can he really save himself.  Supposedly, the ""real"" ending of the film features a grown-up Sanya in a modern war, looking for the thief on a battlefield. I think the film is actually better without it - staying entirely in the past gives it more thematic unity, and the scene with Sanya's tattoos is far more effective at showing what he became, anyway.Consider, lastly, the thief. It would have been easier than easy for Chukhrai to have made him a uniformly bad person; that would have effortlessly justified Sanya's hatred of him and turned Sanya's mother into a helpless victim. But that is not what he is. He is willing to defend them; he even gets into a fight with a man over Sanya once, when any normal father at the time would have just taken it out on the boy. The thief has no compunctions about also using his fists in his domestic circle, but he is not generally abusive; doubtless many husbands and fathers of that time were far worse. He teaches Sanya a mindset which is destructive but really does help him take life on his own terms. And, when Sanya's mother threatens to leave, instead of just abandoning her, he gives her all the valuables he has on him. That's not to say he loves them, since love is more or less foreign to him, and he uses them to the extent of making the boy help him in his thieving enterprises, but there is more to him than that, and there are things for which Sanya owes him. Some people like to interpret the thief as some kind of symbol of Stalin, especially since the thief has a tattoo of Stalin's face on his body. I don't think this is the case; convicts in that time were known to sometimes joke about Stalin being their father, and to the boy, that's a statement of the thief's strength rather than of his ""rightness,"" since he doesn't seem to believe that the thief's victims are really enemies of the state.Pavel Chukhrai is the son of Grigoriy Chukhrai, the great Soviet director who made ""Ballad of a Soldier,"" surely one of the highest triumphs of film. Though hindsight given by the past fifteen-odd years' worth of events has made his worldview darker than his father's, he has inherited all of the elder Chukhrai's simplicity, directness and compassion. ""The Thief"" is in every regard a Chukhrai film; that is, it is a powerful, emotional, and very human film.",5,We had forgotten just how much a Chukhrai film was needed.,1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,4882,"['title', 'character', 'film', 'officer', 'Soviet', 'army', 'shortly', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'rooms', 'big', 'communal', 'apartments', 'cities', 'residents', 'see', 'uniform', 'assume', 'war', 'hero', 'landlords', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'respect', 'ask', 'papers', 'One', 'day', 'residents', 'apartment', 'tickets', 'show', 'steals', 'everything', 'can', 'once', 'leave', 'off', 'city', 'repeat', 'process', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'hopelessly', 'fell', 'one', 'day', 'train', 'time', 'giving', 'birth', 'son', 'alone', 'field', 'somewhere', 'son', 'learn', 'father', 'never', 'returned', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'Pavel', 'Chukhrai', 'Thief', 'also', 'remarkably', 'powerful', 'story', 'many', 'respects', 'Consider', 'first', 'woman', 'who', 'absurdly', 'thief', 'country', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'try', 'bribe', 'officials', 'pitiful', 'valuables', 'when', 'thief', 'finally', 'caught', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'Siberia', 'where', 'eventually', 'sent', 'where', 'botched', 'abortion', 'soon', 'Consider', 'opening', 'scene', 'field', 'where', 'Chukhrai', 'close-up', 'shots', 'face', 'hands', 'show', 'titanic', 'fortitude', 'later', 'contrasted', 'apparent', 'lack', 'will', 'lack', 'will', 'emphatically', '_not_', 'right', 'term', 'thief', 'not', 'really', 'force', 'stay', 'scare', 'staying', 'herself_', 'follow', 'thief', 'die', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'peculiar', 'strength', 'shown', 'again', 'last', 'lines', 'when', 'son', 'why', 'hospital', 'Where', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrified', 'similar', 'prospects', 'devastating', 'understatement', 'Oh', 'nothing', 'just', 'women', 'problems', 'Consider', 'second', 'son', 'who', 'up', 'hating', 'loving', 'thief', 'even', 'Father', 'end', 'long', 'having', 'refused', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'once', 'had', 'real', 'father', 'vague', 'images', 'soldier', 'overcoat', 'blurry', 'not', 'really', 'remember', 'face', 'image', 'everything', 'thief', 'not', 'straightforward', 'honour', 'thief', 'powerless', 'do', 'thing', 'help', 'minimal', 'narration', 'adult', 'Sanya', 'understand', 'dimension', 'elegy', 'proceedings', 'making', 'memories', 'rather', 'immediate', 'events', 'course', 'scene', 'Sanya', 'tattoos', 'where', 'realize', 'only', 'thief', 'worldview', 'can', 'get', 'life', 'only', 'can', 'really', 'save', 'Supposedly', 'real', 'ending', 'film', 'grown-up', 'Sanya', 'modern', 'war', 'looking', 'thief', 'battlefield', 'think', 'film', 'actually', 'better', 'staying', 'entirely', 'past', 'more', 'thematic', 'unity', 'scene', 'Sanya', 'tattoos', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'showing', 'what', 'became', 'anyway.Consider', 'lastly', 'thief', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'easy', 'Chukhrai', 'have', 'made', 'uniformly', 'bad', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'effortlessly', 'justified', 'Sanya', 'hatred', 'turned', 'Sanya', 'mother', 'helpless', 'victim', 'not', 'what', 'willing', 'defend', 'even', 'fight', 'man', 'Sanya', 'once', 'when', 'normal', 'father', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'out', 'boy', 'thief', 'compunctions', 'also', 'using', 'fists', 'domestic', 'circle', 'not', 'generally', 'abusive', 'doubtless', 'many', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'time', 'were', 'far', 'worse', 'Sanya', 'mindset', 'destructive', 'really', 'help', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'when', 'Sanya', 'mother', 'leave', 'instead', 'just', 'abandoning', 'valuables', 'not', 'say', 'love', 'more', 'foreign', 'extent', 'making', 'boy', 'help', 'thieving', 'enterprises', 'more', 'are', 'things', 'Sanya', 'people', 'interpret', 'thief', 'kind', 'symbol', 'Stalin', 'especially', 'thief', 'tattoo', 'Stalin', 'face', 'body', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'case', 'convicts', 'time', 'were', 'known', 'sometimes', 'joke', 'Stalin', 'being', 'father', 'boy', 'statement', 'thief', 'strength', 'rather', 'rightness', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believe', 'thief', 'victims', 'are', 'really', 'enemies', 'state.Pavel', 'Chukhrai', 'son', 'Grigoriy', 'Chukhrai', 'great', 'Soviet', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'Ballad', 'Soldier', 'surely', 'one', 'highest', 'triumphs', 'film', 'hindsight', 'given', 'past', 'fifteen-odd', 'years', 'worth', 'events', 'made', 'worldview', 'darker', 'father', 'inherited', 'elder', 'Chukhrai', 'simplicity', 'directness', 'compassion', 'Thief', 'regard', 'Chukhrai', 'film', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'very', 'human', 'film']",N/A

The central characters, a petty thief, his lover and her son, have a remarkable ease of mobility, as they travel throughout Russia, renting collective apartments, robbing their neighbours, and catching the train for the next town.  The police and soldiers are sparse and rather bumblingly comic; there is little sense of an oppressive, unseen eye hampering activity.  There are even glimpses of collective happiness, through meals, singalongs, the circus etc.'Thief' doesn't purport to be a realistic recreation of the USSR in the early 1950s, but a story filtered through the memories of a middle-aged man.  This accounts for the flatness of the mise-en-scene, the suspended weightlessness of the camera movements, the somewhat unreal filming of the realistic (grotty lavatories, backstreet punch-ups etc.).  The film is, in a sense, a rite-of-passage, with the son, whose father died in the war, being initiated into theft and life by a dashingly handsome young man, whose very presence in an environment devoid of men his age mark him out as himself unreal, as much a phantom as the visions the boy has of his father.This being a modern Russian film, however, 'Thief' cannot leave it at that, and has to be an allegoy for the past - Tolyan, who calls himself the secret illegitimate son of Stalin, is in some way a figure for the dictator, a surrogate father full of false promises and broken dreams, robbing the poor; whose advice for survival is a relentless pummelling of the enemy until you get what you want.  He is not always a monster, though, bringing momentary joy to lives drained of it; in his very a-social activity, in his a-socialistness, if you like, he achieves a delusive freedom unavailable in a society designed to murder freedom.  In some ways, far from representing Stalin, he seems to embody the potential of his maimed, forgotten victims.This historical focus underlying the character drama justifies the various contrivances and cliches in the film, doomed attempts by the narrator to make sense of the senseless.

19737,A328S9RN3U5M68,0767831063,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Pavel Chukhraj's award winning film THE THIEF is one of those special films that should be owned and revisited - like a favorite novel or poem or symphony.  Chukhraj both wrote and directed this tale/fable set in Stalinist Russia, a story which encompasses the impact on a child of loss of a father in the war, the appalling living standards in the communes during the 1950s where multiple families and comrades shared space and survived the lack of privacy, and the extents to which people will go to survive what fate has dealt them and the sad sequelae that follow.The story opens on the cold steppes of Russia where Katya (Yekaterina Rednikova) gives birth to a son Sanya (Misha Philipchuk) in the mud of a country in disrepair in 1946.  Narrated by the adult Sanya we next see Katya and Sanya on board a train where they encounter a handsome soldier Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov), a seemingly gentle man who immediately bonds with the two 'refugees'.  The remainder of the story deals with the fact that Tolyan is a thief and  causes disruptive moves of his 'family' as he plunges them deeper into the hole of his crimes. At times he is harsh with Sanja, at time he is protective and instructive as a surrogate father, teaching Sanya the cruel rules of survival. He is finally imprisoned, Katya dies from an infection following an abortion, and Sanya grows into his teen years in orphanages, dreaming of his real father, wondering about Tolyan.  They two make a final surprise encounter that leads to the ending of the story.The actors are exceptional, the supporting cast is particularly fine, and the cinematography and set designs are something beyond description.  The eyes of Sanya (those of Misha Philipchuk) will haunt you and beckon return to this most impressive and touching film.  Highly recommended.

19741,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,0767831063,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[11, 13]","The allegory in this film of a Stalin/USSR that the child Sanja must defeat went right over my head. So if you're looking for a deep analysis of the directors' subliminal intentions, I can't help you there.  But I can tell you that &quot;The Thief&quot; struck me as the most poignant human drama I've seen since &quot;Gallipolli&quot;.Briefly, a soldier's widow with a young son is won over by Tolya, a striking figure in a Red Army uniform which indeed does gaurd a tattoo of Stalin.  Once the widow has learned of Tolya's habitual theft, along with his lack of remorse and empathy for others, she is already caught in his romantic spell.  And Sanja, at first terrified of this new man in the family, gradually trusts  him more and more.  Especially for the innocent child, portrayed in awestruck wonder by Misha Philipchuk, this set-up bodes heartbreak.And the film does not disappoint in that expectation.  This is well visualized when an older Sanja, alone and desperate to find Tolya, stares in disbelief as the latter, finally found, doesn't recognize him and ridicules his salutation of &quot;Daddy&quot;...the very nickname the con-artist had insisted on during their days together.The most innocent and trusting in this film are prey to those whose only desire is to please themselves....and to use the innocents for that purpose.  But except for the child, the &quot;innocent&quot; are not blameless in the scenarios that ensue.  Sanja's mother,Katje, sees many signs throughout first scenes of Tolya's true character, in his gruffness and cruelty to others, but she stays with him nonetheless, even to the point of jeapordizing her own life.The device of using a child's eyes as a window to this tragedy works well in this film, emphasizing the difference between the imagined, idolized  Tolyan and the real one:  not only in his eyes, but in everyone's.

19742,A2ZBOH5GSJT5SJ,0767831063,"""petyko""","[7, 8]","The Thief was a grammy award nominee in 1999 for best foreign film.  It's Russian (with subtitles) and takes as its subject a little boy in post WWII Soviet Russia who's father is killed in the war.  His mother is befriended  by another soldier and the movie traces the development of the new family.  I use the term family very loosely, for reasons that'll be quite clear when  you see the movie, as I hope you will.  The relationships are explored with  remarkable candor and at times graphic realism.  I can easily see why it  was nominated for best picture.  Both of the adult characters are tragic  figures in the classic sense - strangely dignified but doomed to suffer for  the singular flaw in their personality.  What really makes the movie so  moving - and so modern - is that the tragedy of the two grown-ups is  deflected onto the pitiful little boy, who comes off as both hapless victim  and tenacious survivor.  Though set in the dismally impoverished outskirts  of Stalinist Russia, it has particular relevance today, since it explores  with great depth and understanding the fragile and demanding constitution  of young children and the dangers of social instability when children are  involved.  (When you see the movie, think back to the recent shooting in  Michigan and the social circumstances surrounding the little boy involved  there, and you'll get an haunting sense for just how timely the movie is.)  It easily merits an enthusiastic recommendation from me.",5,A timely look at family distortion,952300800,"03 6, 2000",2000,1483,"['Thief', 'was', 'grammy', 'award', 'nominee', '1999', 'best', 'foreign', 'film', 'Russian', 'subtitles', 'subject', 'little', 'boy', 'post', 'WWII', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'who', 'father', 'killed', 'war', 'mother', 'befriended', 'soldier', 'movie', 'development', 'new', 'family', 'use', 'term', 'family', 'very', 'loosely', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quite', 'clear', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'hope', 'will', 'relationships', 'are', 'explored', 'remarkable', 'candor', 'times', 'graphic', 'realism', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'picture', 'adult', 'characters', 'are', 'tragic', 'figures', 'classic', 'sense', 'strangely', 'dignified', 'doomed', 'suffer', 'singular', 'flaw', 'personality', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'modern', 'tragedy', 'two', 'grown-ups', 'deflected', 'pitiful', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'off', 'hapless', 'victim', 'tenacious', 'survivor', 'Though', 'set', 'dismally', 'impoverished', 'outskirts', 'Stalinist', 'Russia', 'particular', 'relevance', 'today', 'great', 'depth', 'understanding', 'fragile', 'demanding', 'constitution', 'young', 'children', 'dangers', 'social', 'instability', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'involved', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'think', 'back', 'recent', 'shooting', 'Michigan', 'social', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'little', 'boy', 'involved', 'there', ""'ll"", 'get', 'haunting', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'timely', 'movie', 'easily', 'enthusiastic', 'recommendation']",N/A

That's usually a solid category in which to find quality movies and ""The Thief"" is no exception.  The title keeps no secrets but I had no idea of the direction that the plot would carry us.  It is the story of a boy who searches for something to hold on to in the years after WWII in Soviet Russia.  The various stages in his life (and most of this film takes place with him about 4 years old) present challenges that most of us could not fathom.  The lessons in life that he absorbs leads to a strange climax which is followed by an equally pondersome post-script.  My take is that ""The Thief"" suggests that life repeats itself no matter how offbeat the circumstances of our youth.As an aside, this film is rather crude at times.  Check out the (to date) lone one-star review for a somewhat over-reaction to the crudeness.  Nonetheless, there's a youthful example of how European cinema standards cross a line that, to my knowledge, US films still (thank goodness) consider taboo.  There actually is a cultural context for the scene that comes to mind but it could have been filmed differently.  I was impressed by the Russian life style that ""The Thief"" depicted so well.  It is certainly worth watching (even if you might want to avoid watching every scene).",4,I Remember Papa (or do I)?,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1361,"['noticed', 'movie', 'nomination', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'category', 'usually', 'solid', 'category', 'find', 'quality', 'movies', 'Thief', 'exception', 'title', 'secrets', 'had', 'idea', 'direction', 'plot', 'would', 'carry', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'something', 'hold', 'years', 'WWII', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'most', 'film', 'place', '4', 'years', 'old', 'present', 'most', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'lessons', 'life', 'strange', 'climax', 'followed', 'equally', 'pondersome', 'post-script', 'take', 'Thief', 'life', 'repeats', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'offbeat', 'circumstances', 'youth.As', 'aside', 'film', 'rather', 'crude', 'times', 'Check', 'date', 'lone', 'one-star', 'review', 'somewhat', 'over-reaction', 'crudeness', 'Nonetheless', 'youthful', 'example', 'how', 'European', 'cinema', 'standards', 'cross', 'line', 'knowledge', 'US', 'films', 'still', 'thank', 'goodness', 'consider', 'taboo', 'actually', 'cultural', 'context', 'scene', 'mind', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'differently', 'was', 'impressed', 'Russian', 'life', 'style', 'Thief', 'depicted', 'so', 'well', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'watching', 'scene']",N/A
