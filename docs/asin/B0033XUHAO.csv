1320451,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B0033XUHAO,applewood,"[190, 195]","My wife and I watched this documentary last night when it aired on PBS and enjoyed it very much. The pace, cinemagraphic and informational quality were all very well done. I thought the choice of participants (frequently cut to for ongoing commentary) was pleasing and varied (Asian, Western, Men, Women, Old, Young, Ordained, Lay, Scholars and Poets). Actor Richard Gere as well, was perfect as the unobtrusive narrator. The narration accompanied illustrations that included wonderful footage of modern (timeless) India and a variety of traditional and contemporary Buddhist art (painting and sculpture), and traced the life of Buddha through the main places and cultures of India he lived as they are preserved and appreciated today. (I thought the occasional use of the flowing, simple and whimsically animated graphics was okay in depicting the myths. My wife, not a Buddhist, thought they were a bit too simple and cartoony...)Overall I thought the show kept a nice balance between presenting Buddha the awakened human being, and Buddha the mythical cosmic being (very little is objectively known of him since it was probably over 300 years after his passing before anything was written down about him, his origins and teachings). Dharma-wise, the content seemed delightfully whole, even, smooth and free of sectarian edges (if anything the approach was more Therevadin oriented, as it kept to basic common themes and really looked at the Buddha the man and not Buddhism the religion). The effect was a teaching very down to earth and applicable to all of us regardless of our beliefs.I finished the show feeling more inspired to wake up - to meditate, to enjoy life, to pay attention moment by moment and let the natural wisdom and compassion of this moment flow (within and without me). This morning I commented to my wife that my only complaint was that they made the Buddha's remarkable, extraordinary achievement seem somehow ordinary and if not easily attainable, at least easily understandable. She replied that he was obviously a great leader, trained from birth to assume that role, and then he fulfilled that destiny by demonstrating and guiding others through his awakening and teachings. It was a nice secular way to view and appreciate enlightened activity in the world. This obvious fact was something I'd never fully appreciated in all my years of interest in Buddhism. It made his example all the more real and relevant - the perfect balance of mundane and sublime, worldly and spiritual.",4,Buddha - the Awakened Leader,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,2509,"['wife', 'watched', 'documentary', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'aired', 'PBS', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'pace', 'cinemagraphic', 'informational', 'quality', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'choice', 'participants', 'frequently', 'cut', 'ongoing', 'commentary', 'was', 'pleasing', 'varied', 'Asian', 'Western', 'Men', 'Women', 'Old', 'Young', 'Ordained', 'Lay', 'Scholars', 'Poets', 'Actor', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'perfect', 'unobtrusive', 'narrator', 'narration', 'accompanied', 'illustrations', 'included', 'wonderful', 'footage', 'modern', 'timeless', 'India', 'variety', 'traditional', 'contemporary', 'Buddhist', 'art', 'painting', 'sculpture', 'traced', 'life', 'Buddha', 'main', 'places', 'cultures', 'India', 'lived', 'are', 'preserved', 'appreciated', 'today', 'thought', 'occasional', 'use', 'flowing', 'simple', 'whimsically', 'animated', 'graphics', 'was', 'okay', 'depicting', 'myths', 'My', 'wife', 'not', 'Buddhist', 'thought', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'simple', 'cartoony', 'Overall', 'thought', 'show', 'kept', 'nice', 'balance', 'presenting', 'Buddha', 'awakened', 'human', 'being', 'Buddha', 'mythical', 'cosmic', 'being', 'very', 'little', 'objectively', 'known', 'was', 'probably', '300', 'years', 'passing', 'anything', 'was', 'written', 'down', 'origins', 'teachings', 'Dharma-wise', 'content', 'seemed', 'delightfully', 'whole', 'even', 'smooth', 'free', 'sectarian', 'edges', 'anything', 'approach', 'was', 'more', 'Therevadin', 'oriented', 'kept', 'basic', 'common', 'themes', 'really', 'looked', 'Buddha', 'man', 'not', 'Buddhism', 'religion', 'effect', 'was', 'teaching', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'applicable', 'regardless', 'beliefs.I', 'finished', 'show', 'feeling', 'more', 'inspired', 'wake', 'up', 'meditate', 'enjoy', 'life', 'pay', 'attention', 'moment', 'moment', 'let', 'natural', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'moment', 'flow', 'morning', 'commented', 'wife', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'made', 'Buddha', 'remarkable', 'extraordinary', 'achievement', 'seem', 'somehow', 'ordinary', 'not', 'easily', 'attainable', 'least', 'easily', 'understandable', 'replied', 'was', 'obviously', 'great', 'leader', 'trained', 'birth', 'assume', 'role', 'then', 'fulfilled', 'destiny', 'demonstrating', 'guiding', 'others', 'awakening', 'teachings', 'was', 'nice', 'secular', 'way', 'view', 'appreciate', 'enlightened', 'activity', 'world', 'obvious', 'fact', 'was', 'something', ""'d"", 'never', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'years', 'interest', 'Buddhism', 'made', 'example', 'more', 'real', 'relevant', 'perfect', 'balance', 'mundane', 'sublime', 'worldly', 'spiritual']",N/A

I think it is a very good overview of Buddhism and I learned a great deal about both Siddhartha and the philosophy he espoused.The video begins by retelling the life story of Siddhartha, later known as the Buddha. The video touches on his youth as a wealthy, noble &#34;prince&#34; - for lack of a better term - in a small Indian kingdom. The DVD emphasizes his privileged birth and early life and his encounters with &#34;suffering&#34; when he left his palace for short rides with an attendant.It will seem quite apparent to the viewer that Siddhartha was deeply touched by the suffering he encountered and that his search for answers was a sincere one in which he gave up his wealth and position to seek answers. The DVD retells the stories of Siddhartha as he attached himself to gurus, learning yoga and meditation techniques in order to find the answers he sought.  He did not find the answer and continued in his search, adopting asceticism, punishing and starving his body to reject the material world. According to the DVD, Siddhartha realized that his asceticism had not led to the answers he sought.The video then gives his discovery of the &#34;middle way&#34; as he finds the enlightenment he had sought for years. The DVD gives a fairly good overview of Buddhist concepts such as the Four Noble Truths which lead into the concepts of the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Immeasurables. The DVD attempts to simplify the rather abstract concepts of Buddhism though it does not always succeed - to this viewer at least.I felt the DVD did a good job of showing the viewer the basics of Siddhartha's journey and the religion he founded. I found it odd, though, that a PBS production essentially told the story without any kind of skepticism in regard to the stories of the Buddha or the tenets of the religion.

Ward ""horror and sci-fi fan..""","[2, 4]","This 2 hour documentary takes the viewer on the journey of the man who would one day be called ""the Buddha"", being translated the ""enlightened one"", or ""awakened one"".He was born Siddhartha Gautama 500 years before Christ Jesus to a noble warrior caste in northern India.  Because he was born into wealth, he had every opportunity to indulge in his fleshly desires, which he did until he was around the age of 29. Although he had every material comfort, he was unhappy and unsatisfied.  It was at that time he left home, wife, and child on what could only be called a spiritual quest.At first his tried detaching himself from the world and riches and pleasures.  This was the dominant relgious practice of his day.  This was done by practically starving oneself, owning nothing, living outside.  It was thought that the flesh separated oneself from the spiritual; hence, he tried to put to death the needs of his flesh.  He did this for 6 years.  In the end, he realized that this too, was not the answer, just like indulging the flesh was not the answer either.Finally the Buddha realized the ""middle path"" or ""third way"" of living was the best practice of living.  In other words, avoiding the extremes.  This formed the foundation of his teachings, along with the ""4 noble truths"". {please Google the 4 noble truths for a deeper study}Richard Gere does an excellent job narrating the film, which also features interviews with Buddhism experts as they explain the life of Buddha and his philosophy.

That's probably what I admire about the film most of all.  They simply told the story of the man we all know as The Buddha.  It's not a propaganda film.Buddhists do not worship the Buddha, but we do revere him.  In my Buddhist practice (Nichiren Buddhism) we do not have any Buddha statues or worship any person whatsoever for instance; rather, we try to practice and, sure, to a certain extent pay homage to his teachings.  As the saying goes, 'The Buddha is a person, and a person is the Buddha.'  The goal of practicing Buddhism is not to worship, but to become; we practice to attain the same enlightenment as Shakyamuni (aka Gautama, aka Siddarta, et cetera).  What's great about this film is that it represents how the Buddha sought enlightenment.On the other hand, there are parts of the world where the Buddha is revered as if a god or savior, which is like trying to get rich by counting someone else's money, so it's good to see a film that talks about the man for a change, and again without promoting a particular practice.They also show a lot of the practices that are often mistaken for Buddhism, and give them a balanced treatment--purely as points of reference rather than opinion.This film represents the Buddha in a way that is entirely agreeable to those who subscribe to a multitude of viewpoints on the subject of his teaching, and practice them in various ways.  I also believe it's a good film for non-Buddhists who are simply interested in the unique history and undeniable cultural and philosophical impact the Buddha has on hundreds of millions of people worldwide.On plain production quality:I liked the animated segments.  I imagine if they used live actors there might be people who would object to how the Buddha and others were portrayed.Buddhist or not, Richard Gere was the best possible choice to narrate this film.  Hurray for Richard Gere.The Dalai Llama appears very little in this.  I would have liked to see a bit more of him, as well as other Buddhist leaders who are not Tibetan.Poets?  What's with the poets?  And there are two of them!  Speaking as someone who has practiced Buddhism for over twenty-two years, they were--to be honest--pretty generic American Buddhists.  They glow, but I don't see why they're in this film.Actual scholars from multiple universities are very welcome.  It's easy to get practitioners to gush about Buddhism and the Buddha in an idealized or skewed presentation of the facts, but actual scholars are responsible for having some objectivity.I especially enjoyed seeing all the sites and thousands of years of Buddhist artwork shown in this film.  I have stood and walked where Nichiren stood and walked in Japan--because I just happen to be there actually, not on a pilgrimage of some kind--and seeing this film makes me want to visit the significant locations of Shakyamuni's life.I highly recommend this film.",5,"I practice Nichiren Buddhism, and I love the film.",1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2963,"['film', 'made', 'Tibeten', 'Buddhists', 'focusing', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'probably', 'what', 'admire', 'film', 'most', 'simply', 'told', 'story', 'man', 'know', 'Buddha', 'not', 'propaganda', 'film.Buddhists', 'do', 'not', 'worship', 'Buddha', 'do', 'revere', 'Buddhist', 'practice', 'Nichiren', 'Buddhism', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Buddha', 'statues', 'worship', 'person', 'whatsoever', 'instance', 'rather', 'try', 'practice', 'sure', 'certain', 'extent', 'pay', 'homage', 'teachings', 'saying', 'Buddha', 'person', 'person', 'Buddha', 'goal', 'practicing', 'Buddhism', 'not', 'worship', 'become', 'practice', 'attain', 'same', 'enlightenment', 'Shakyamuni', 'aka', 'Gautama', 'aka', 'Siddarta', 'et', 'cetera', 'What', 'great', 'film', 'how', 'Buddha', 'sought', 'enlightenment.On', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'parts', 'world', 'where', 'Buddha', 'revered', 'god', 'savior', 'trying', 'get', 'rich', 'counting', 'someone', 'else', 'money', 'good', 'see', 'film', 'man', 'change', 'again', 'promoting', 'particular', 'practice.They', 'also', 'show', 'lot', 'practices', 'are', 'often', 'mistaken', 'Buddhism', 'give', 'balanced', 'treatment', 'purely', 'points', 'reference', 'rather', 'opinion.This', 'film', 'Buddha', 'way', 'entirely', 'agreeable', 'who', 'subscribe', 'multitude', 'viewpoints', 'subject', 'teaching', 'practice', 'various', 'ways', 'also', 'believe', 'good', 'film', 'non-Buddhists', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'interested', 'unique', 'history', 'undeniable', 'cultural', 'philosophical', 'impact', 'Buddha', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'people', 'worldwide.On', 'plain', 'production', 'quality', 'liked', 'animated', 'segments', 'imagine', 'used', 'live', 'actors', 'might', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'object', 'how', 'Buddha', 'others', 'were', 'portrayed.Buddhist', 'not', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'was', 'best', 'possible', 'choice', 'narrate', 'film', 'Hurray', 'Richard', 'Gere.The', 'Dalai', 'Llama', 'very', 'little', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Buddhist', 'leaders', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Tibetan.Poets', 'What', 'poets', 'are', 'two', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'practiced', 'Buddhism', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'were', 'be', 'honest', 'pretty', 'generic', 'American', 'Buddhists', 'glow', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', ""'re"", 'film.Actual', 'scholars', 'multiple', 'universities', 'are', 'very', 'welcome', 'easy', 'get', 'practitioners', 'gush', 'Buddhism', 'Buddha', 'idealized', 'skewed', 'presentation', 'facts', 'actual', 'scholars', 'are', 'responsible', 'having', 'objectivity.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'sites', 'thousands', 'years', 'Buddhist', 'artwork', 'shown', 'film', 'have', 'stood', 'walked', 'where', 'Nichiren', 'stood', 'walked', 'Japan', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'actually', 'not', 'pilgrimage', 'kind', 'seeing', 'film', 'want', 'visit', 'significant', 'locations', 'Shakyamuni', 'life.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

It revolves around the story of the Buddha's life, as told in the first sutras (Buddhist scripture) on the subject, which began appearing around 500 years after the Buddha's passing. Richard Gere narrates the sutra portion of the story, while beautiful Buddhist artwork from around the world is displayed, interspersed with shots of sacred Buddhist historical sites, and some original graphics. The artwork in particular is stunning, and of course Richard Gere's voice contributes a lovely and peaceful depth to the telling.At each phase of the Buddha's life story, cutaways to well-known Buddhist academics, teachers and writers are incorporated, including the Dalai Lama, Robert Thurman (the first American ordained as a Buddhist monk, acclaimed Buddhist author and speaker, and professor of Buddhist studies at Columbia University), Mark Epstein (Buddhist psychotherapist and author, and frequent contributor to the Buddhist magazine Tricycle), W.S. Merwin (practicing Zen Buddhist and acclaimed poet), and Jane Hirshfield (also a practicing Zen Buddhist and acclaimed poet.) Many others are featured as well. My favorite quotes were from Ms. Hirshfield, including this one:""It's alright to feel what human beings feel, and we are not supposed to turn into rocks or trees when we practice Buddhism. Buddhists laugh, cry, dance, feel ecstasy, probably even feel despair. It is how we know the world. It is how we live inside of our hearts, not disassociated from them.""I wish all of the commentators were so well-spoken. My only reservation about this film (and the reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars) is that I did feel it became bogged down by some of the academic commentators. They were (not to put too fine a point on it) rather dull at times, which made the story drag.

1320490,A237RLQXTL55RG,B0033XUHAO,off the tropic,"[1, 1]","This PBS documentary The Buddha by David Grubin is an inspired re-telling of the ""great renunciation"" of Prince Siddhartha and the transformation of a once confused, worldly, man born to comfort and privilege, to that great renunciate and god of the Tropics, Buddha.The film begins with a moving account of how the mind of the Prince awakens to harsher realities of the world outside his palace walls. The hypnotic beauty of Gautama's early life narrative and his odyssey to sainthood through penance to ""Nirvana"" force us to wonder if all spiritual roads lead back to ancient India. Could the quest for ultimate answers be already given by this sage of sages?The film eloquently reminds us that the relevance of the teachings of the great god of the tropics is more urgent now than it has ever been.As I was watching the critical early synopsis of Gautama's metamorphosis, I was struck by the similarities in Gautama's quest for perfection and the pleading for a loftier humanism in the writings of Matthew Arnold, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Soren Kierkegaard. But those similarities quickly evaporated when the language-centered worldviews of these western sages, their poetic responses to the problem of life that have molded our modernist sensibilities for so long, stand in striking contrast to the unique mode of quietism recommended by the eastern sage. Desire and power will have its place in Gautama's world but in a radically altered, muted, and austere form.Happiness, as Gautama discovers, is essentially the absence of desire. Some desire is good. How else could the great quest for enlightenment, Siddhartha's perfectionist experiment, even begin without the desire of a renunciate? The Dalai Lama in a crucial interview in the film offers this distinction between the desire of Mara, the crafty temptor, often an obstacle in the quest for happiness, and the forgotten austere mode of desire that renounces and liberates life as we know it.Absence of suffering, as W.S. Merwin clarifies, is spiritual stillness. The renunciate overcomes the incurable basis of life, the restlessness of the mind. In its natural state, a mind devoid of the culture of renunciation is like a monkey leaping around from one tree of attachment and addiction to another. Buddha will use this metaphor to remind us what the mind is importantly NOT in its attained fullness. The essence of the mind emerges after the renunciate triumphs over its true nature. Happiness can emerge only from a life enshrined in quietism.Richard Gere's narration in this film has an unpretentious, even glowing, calm to it. It complements nicely the larger pacific rhythms of the message and the story. The interviews with W.S. Merwin and the Dalai Lama have a richness to it that forever marks the listener by the spell of Buddha's message. It alternatively comes with the infectious laughter and wisdom of the Dalai Lama, his firm but happy way of retelling the truth of the Dhammapada. The great W.S. Merwin has an eloquence that is disarming. He has a way of paraphrasing Buddhist wisdom that is unforgettable. The caste of characters also include several monks, a psychoanalyst, two professors of Buddhism, including the erudite Robert Thurman, and an inspired Buddhist poet from Princeton, Jane Hirshfield.A film to watch and savor the eternal allure of this great God of the tropics.",5,"PBS's ""The Buddha""",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,3380,"['PBS', 'Buddha', 'David', 'Grubin', 'inspired', 're-telling', 'great', 'renunciation', 'Prince', 'Siddhartha', 'transformation', 'once', 'confused', 'worldly', 'man', 'born', 'comfort', 'privilege', 'great', 'renunciate', 'god', 'Tropics', 'Buddha.The', 'film', 'moving', 'account', 'how', 'mind', 'Prince', 'awakens', 'harsher', 'realities', 'world', 'palace', 'walls', 'hypnotic', 'beauty', 'Gautama', 'early', 'life', 'narrative', 'odyssey', 'sainthood', 'penance', 'Nirvana', 'force', 'wonder', 'spiritual', 'roads', 'lead', 'back', 'ancient', 'India', 'Could', 'quest', 'ultimate', 'answers', 'be', 'already', 'given', 'sage', 'sages', 'film', 'eloquently', 'relevance', 'teachings', 'great', 'god', 'tropics', 'more', 'urgent', 'now', 'ever', 'been.As', 'was', 'watching', 'critical', 'early', 'synopsis', 'Gautama', 'metamorphosis', 'was', 'struck', 'similarities', 'Gautama', 'quest', 'perfection', 'pleading', 'loftier', 'humanism', 'writings', 'Matthew', 'Arnold', 'Ralph', 'Waldo', 'Emerson', 'Friedrich', 'Nietzsche', 'Soren', 'Kierkegaard', 'similarities', 'quickly', 'evaporated', 'when', 'language-centered', 'worldviews', 'western', 'sages', 'poetic', 'responses', 'problem', 'life', 'have', 'molded', 'modernist', 'sensibilities', 'so', 'long', 'stand', 'striking', 'contrast', 'unique', 'mode', 'quietism', 'recommended', 'eastern', 'sage', 'Desire', 'power', 'will', 'have', 'place', 'Gautama', 'world', 'radically', 'altered', 'muted', 'austere', 'form.Happiness', 'Gautama', 'discovers', 'essentially', 'absence', 'desire', 'desire', 'good', 'How', 'else', 'could', 'great', 'quest', 'enlightenment', 'Siddhartha', 'perfectionist', 'experiment', 'even', 'begin', 'desire', 'renunciate', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'crucial', 'interview', 'film', 'distinction', 'desire', 'Mara', 'crafty', 'temptor', 'often', 'obstacle', 'quest', 'happiness', 'forgotten', 'austere', 'mode', 'desire', 'renounces', 'life', 'know', 'it.Absence', 'suffering', 'W.S', 'Merwin', 'clarifies', 'spiritual', 'stillness', 'renunciate', 'incurable', 'basis', 'life', 'restlessness', 'mind', 'natural', 'state', 'mind', 'devoid', 'culture', 'renunciation', 'monkey', 'leaping', 'one', 'tree', 'attachment', 'addiction', 'Buddha', 'will', 'use', 'metaphor', 'remind', 'what', 'mind', 'importantly', 'NOT', 'attained', 'fullness', 'essence', 'mind', 'renunciate', 'triumphs', 'true', 'nature', 'can', 'emerge', 'only', 'life', 'enshrined', 'quietism.Richard', 'Gere', 'narration', 'film', 'unpretentious', 'even', 'glowing', 'calm', 'nicely', 'larger', 'pacific', 'rhythms', 'message', 'story', 'interviews', 'W.S', 'Merwin', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'have', 'richness', 'forever', 'listener', 'spell', 'Buddha', 'message', 'alternatively', 'infectious', 'laughter', 'wisdom', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'firm', 'happy', 'way', 'retelling', 'truth', 'Dhammapada', 'great', 'W.S', 'Merwin', 'eloquence', 'disarming', 'way', 'paraphrasing', 'Buddhist', 'wisdom', 'unforgettable', 'caste', 'characters', 'also', 'include', 'several', 'monks', 'psychoanalyst', 'two', 'professors', 'Buddhism', 'including', 'erudite', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'inspired', 'Buddhist', 'poet', 'Princeton', 'Jane', 'Hirshfield.A', 'film', 'watch', 'savor', 'eternal', 'allure', 'great', 'God', 'tropics']",N/A
