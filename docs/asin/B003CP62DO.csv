The artwork is pretty and definitely eye catching, but I guess I shouldn't have judged this anime by it's cover.  I was less than impressed with the story and it seemed repetitive.

The animation quality is above average and the Japanese voice acting is very well done.  It is an addictive series as well.  This series did exceed my expectations and I feel more people who like anime should watch it.  But it is not for kids and it is not for novices into anime watching.  I recommend watching Cowboy Bebop to get you into anime, then go for the more serious and violent series.

It is about the dragons of earth who think humanity is destroying the planet and wants to kill every human on earth and the dragons of heaven who were destined to stop them. One thing I must say though is that the powers these characters are given to fight with are very lame. For example there is this one character who fights with a ribbon how stupid is that. Also another character fights with her dog. This series was also ruined by terrible art and it was way to gory.

1336757,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B003CP62DO,Kris,"[0, 1]","Will you decide to save the world as it is or start a revolution to end the world? That is the premise of this show. This series is kind of like Fate Stay Night or Future Diary in the fact that there is a large battle against many interesting characters that may end the world as we know it. There are two groups of seven people that fight against each other to determine the world's fate. There is a lot more to this show than just fighting. This is probably one of the only shows that I have ever seen where all the characters backstories and motivations are revealed. This show makes you even sympathetic towards the bad guys, and that is something that can be quite difficult to accomplish. It also helps that everyone in the series looks very pretty, much like Code Geass.This series begins with a young man named Kamui Shir, who returns to his former hometown and meets up with his childhood friends, Fma Monou and his sister, Kotori. Kamui does not want to be involved with them again out of fear that they would be hurt in the upcoming battles in the series. He is joined by a group of friends, who like Kamui, are also spiritualists, and wield incredible powers.This series was done by Clamp, who have also worked on anime such as Rayearth and Chobits. The characters should look familiar to fans of Clamp, and if you are a fan, you definitely have seen or read this series. It is true that the manga is unfinished, but the anime certainly has an ending. And I mean an actual ending, not an anime ending where it just leaves the viewer hanging. The director is Yoshiaki Kawajiri, who directed Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. When I heard that he was director, I immediately purchased this series; he's that good.There is also a movie of X as well. The movie is way too short to accompany all the characters, and is downright violent towards the characters. The final battle of the movie made me feel so bad to the loser of the battle, unlike the series, which has an ending I can totally accept. The movie was also made before the series, and looks worse than the series, ironically. Do not watch the movie; it just is completely inferior to the series. Also, the English dub for the movie is completely different than the series. The characters voices do not match up at all, and are absolutely terrible. Speaking of the English dub, it is really good in the series. Anime veterans like Wendee Lee, Steven Blum, and Crispin Freeman are in this show.This collection is rereleased from the Pioneer license, and is now under Funimation's label. All 24 episodes are included in this collection, as well as the OVA episode, which is on the final disc. Overall, this is an exceptionally good series, and you get to feel the characters' emotions. Also, there is implied boy's love, so be careful if you are against that, but the characters are way too pretty to object against it anyways.",5,Battle for the end of the world,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2905,"['Will', 'decide', 'save', 'world', 'start', 'revolution', 'end', 'world', 'premise', 'show', 'series', 'kind', 'like', 'Fate', 'Stay', 'Night', 'Future', 'Diary', 'fact', 'large', 'battle', 'many', 'interesting', 'characters', 'may', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'groups', 'seven', 'people', 'fight', 'other', 'determine', 'world', 'fate', 'lot', 'more', 'show', 'just', 'fighting', 'probably', 'one', 'only', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'characters', 'backstories', 'motivations', 'are', 'revealed', 'show', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'bad', 'guys', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'difficult', 'accomplish', 'also', 'everyone', 'series', 'very', 'pretty', 'much', 'Code', 'Geass.This', 'series', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Kamui', 'Shir', 'who', 'former', 'hometown', 'up', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Fma', 'Monou', 'sister', 'Kotori', 'Kamui', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'again', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'hurt', 'upcoming', 'battles', 'series', 'joined', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'Kamui', 'are', 'also', 'spiritualists', 'wield', 'incredible', 'powers.This', 'series', 'was', 'done', 'Clamp', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'worked', 'anime', 'such', 'Rayearth', 'Chobits', 'characters', 'should', 'look', 'familiar', 'fans', 'Clamp', 'are', 'fan', 'definitely', 'have', 'seen', 'read', 'series', 'true', 'manga', 'unfinished', 'anime', 'certainly', 'ending', 'mean', 'actual', 'ending', 'not', 'anime', 'ending', 'where', 'just', 'viewer', 'hanging', 'director', 'Yoshiaki', 'Kawajiri', 'who', 'directed', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'Bloodlust', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'director', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'series', 'good.There', 'also', 'movie', 'X', 'well', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'accompany', 'characters', 'downright', 'violent', 'characters', 'final', 'battle', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'loser', 'battle', 'series', 'ending', 'can', 'totally', 'accept', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'series', 'worse', 'series', 'ironically', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'completely', 'inferior', 'series', 'Also', 'English', 'dub', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'series', 'characters', 'voices', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'are', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'Speaking', 'English', 'dub', 'really', 'good', 'series', 'Anime', 'veterans', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'Steven', 'Blum', 'Crispin', 'Freeman', 'are', 'show.This', 'collection', 'rereleased', 'Pioneer', 'license', 'now', 'Funimation', 'label', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'OVA', 'episode', 'final', 'disc', 'Overall', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'series', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'emotions', 'Also', 'implied', 'boy', 'love', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'pretty', 'object']",N/A

The action scenes are consistently great & epic in this way. The story also involves dreamseers, spells and other dimensions as part of the super-natural clash for the future of planet Earth.While basic story is pretty straightforward it does have some interesting naunce also, as well as being a more character focused story, with a wide range of characters all with decently developed stories as part of the plot - in contrast to the Directors more well known purely action works - and has alot more depth in how things come together in keeping track of the whole story.It is maybe abit more melodramatic & tragic in tone than it needs to be at times to tell the story, yet despite this, there are quite a few moments especially toward the end where the story matches it's melodrama in a very bittersweet & uplifting way! The action scenes and other supernatural things are always involving in each episode along with the extra depth  provided in the story constantly rewarding as well. The Japanese voice acting is very good as often the case in animes, and the subtitles are fine.As a fan of the Matrix, i notice quite a few similarities and ideas including visuals, so if you like that kind of anime feel to esthetic, it should be a rewarding & interesting watch overall.X is rated 16 up & is abit more extreme than a kids cartoon. It is a Unique type of Anime in often being quite Kid type then very Adult in the same episode making X an artistically difficult Anime to easily categorise with all it's different character stories and moments - but overall, X is a well deserved if not widely known anime classic made by a Master of the form i think.",5,Anime Tragic Drama of Earth's Future being Fought by Two Pre-ordained Japanese Guardian Orders.,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2032,"['anime', 'series', 'accomplished', 'successful', 'Yoshiaki', 'Kawajiri', 'who', 'known', 'such', 'animes', 'Wicked', 'City', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'Vampire', 'Hunter-D', 'Animatrix', 'i.e', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'successful', 'anime', 'titles', 'west.The', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'powers', 'different', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'able', 'leap', 'run', 'buildings', 'tops', 'buildings', 'tops', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'consistently', 'great', 'epic', 'way', 'story', 'also', 'dreamseers', 'spells', 'other', 'dimensions', 'part', 'super-natural', 'clash', 'future', 'planet', 'Earth.While', 'basic', 'story', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'have', 'interesting', 'naunce', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'more', 'character', 'focused', 'story', 'wide', 'range', 'characters', 'decently', 'developed', 'stories', 'part', 'plot', 'contrast', 'Directors', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'purely', 'action', 'alot', 'more', 'depth', 'how', 'things', 'come', 'together', 'keeping', 'track', 'whole', 'story.It', 'maybe', 'abit', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'tragic', 'tone', 'be', 'times', 'tell', 'story', 'yet', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'especially', 'end', 'where', 'story', 'melodrama', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'uplifting', 'way', 'action', 'scenes', 'other', 'supernatural', 'things', 'are', 'always', 'involving', 'episode', 'extra', 'depth', 'provided', 'story', 'constantly', 'rewarding', 'as', 'well', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'often', 'case', 'animes', 'subtitles', 'are', 'fan', 'Matrix', 'i', 'notice', 'quite', 'few', 'similarities', 'ideas', 'including', 'visuals', 'so', 'like', 'kind', 'anime', 'feel', 'esthetic', 'should', 'be', 'rewarding', 'interesting', 'watch', 'overall.X', 'rated', '16', 'abit', 'more', 'extreme', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'Unique', 'type', 'Anime', 'often', 'being', 'quite', 'Kid', 'type', 'then', 'very', 'Adult', 'same', 'episode', 'making', 'X', 'artistically', 'difficult', 'Anime', 'easily', 'categorise', 'different', 'character', 'stories', 'moments', 'overall', 'X', 'well', 'deserved', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'anime', 'classic', 'made', 'Master', 'form', 'i', 'think']",N/A
1336761,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B003CP62DO,RavenRing,"[20, 22]","Story:15 year old Kamui returns to Tokyo after being gone for 6 years. His childhood friends Fuma and Kotori are very excited at his return, but are hurt and confused by his change in character. Rather than the kind and cheerful boy that they knew, Kamui is cold and quite. But Kamui has a reason to be moody - the day of reckoning is near and the Dragons of Earth and the Dragons of Heaven will battle to decided the fate of humanity, and Kamui must pick a side to join.This series is, in my opinion, CLAMP's greatest masterpiece. X was the first CLAMP series I was introduced to, and has remained my favorite. To explain why this series is great, I have outlined the pros and cons below.PROS:~Artwork - As with all CLAMP's work, the artwork and character designs are detailed and beautiful. Some of the characters look very similar to other CLAMP characters, but some are completely unique to X. Some of the imagery is very impressive, and with a wide range of characters (the Dragons alone add up to 14) and a wide range of situations leads to a wide range of different types of scenes that show CLAMP's creativity and imagination.~Music - The music for this show is some of the best I've heard in any screen production. The main theme, Destiny, is very memorable and beautiful. I bought the soundtrack and Destiny is one of my top played songs, despite being instrumental.~Story and Characters - X boasts a complicated story with complex characters. The cast of characters is large and many of them have their own story to contribute. The interactions between the Dragons of Earth and the Dragons of Heaven are quite realistic - even the people wishing for the destruction of humanity are only human themselves and this especially evident when they encounter someone from the opposite side.CONS:~This isn't a very cheerful series - it is about the end of humanity after all. I don't want to spoil anything, so won't go into detail about any tragedies that occur. I thought that tragedy was essential to the story, but it was still sad and might make you cry (I think I did).~I like having a lot of characters, but it did get a little confusing at times!~Even at 24 episodes, this series wasn't quite long enough to fit all of the story into it. The manga is 18 volumes long, and still hasn't ended. I think that the anime creators did a good job of picking which things were cut, but it still felt a little rushed in some places.Obviously, the pros far outweigh the cons and you should totally watch this series! This set is pretty cheap at $30, which is about half the price I originally paid for the series, so you are getting quite a bargain!One final note: I watched this series in Japanese and the cast all did an excellent job. I haven't see it in English, so I can't say if it is any good or not. But I really liked the Japanese dub, so I would recommend it.",5,"Epic Tale of Love, Loss, and The End of The World",1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2869,"['Story:15', 'year', 'old', 'Kamui', 'Tokyo', 'being', 'gone', '6', 'years', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Fuma', 'Kotori', 'are', 'very', 'excited', 'return', 'are', 'hurt', 'confused', 'change', 'character', 'Rather', 'kind', 'cheerful', 'boy', 'knew', 'Kamui', 'cold', 'quite', 'Kamui', 'reason', 'be', 'moody', 'day', 'reckoning', 'Dragons', 'Earth', 'Dragons', 'Heaven', 'will', 'battle', 'decided', 'fate', 'humanity', 'Kamui', 'must', 'pick', 'side', 'join.This', 'series', 'opinion', 'CLAMP', 'greatest', 'masterpiece', 'X', 'was', 'first', 'CLAMP', 'series', 'was', 'introduced', 'remained', 'favorite', 'explain', 'why', 'series', 'great', 'have', 'outlined', 'pros', 'cons', 'below.PROS', '~Artwork', 'CLAMP', 'work', 'artwork', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'detailed', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'look', 'very', 'similar', 'other', 'CLAMP', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'unique', 'X', 'imagery', 'very', 'impressive', 'wide', 'range', 'characters', 'Dragons', 'alone', 'add', 'up', '14', 'wide', 'range', 'situations', 'leads', 'wide', 'range', 'different', 'types', 'scenes', 'show', 'CLAMP', 'creativity', 'imagination.~Music', 'music', 'show', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'screen', 'production', 'main', 'theme', 'Destiny', 'very', 'memorable', 'beautiful', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'Destiny', 'one', 'top', 'played', 'songs', 'being', 'instrumental.~Story', 'Characters', 'X', 'complicated', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'cast', 'characters', 'large', 'many', 'have', 'own', 'story', 'contribute', 'interactions', 'Dragons', 'Earth', 'Dragons', 'Heaven', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'even', 'people', 'wishing', 'destruction', 'humanity', 'are', 'only', 'human', 'especially', 'evident', 'when', 'encounter', 'someone', 'opposite', 'side.CONS', '~This', ""n't"", 'very', 'cheerful', 'series', 'end', 'humanity', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'tragedies', 'occur', 'thought', 'tragedy', 'was', 'essential', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'sad', 'might', 'make', 'cry', 'think', 'did', '.~I', 'having', 'lot', 'characters', 'did', 'get', 'little', 'confusing', 'times', '~Even', '24', 'episodes', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'long', 'enough', 'fit', 'story', 'manga', '18', 'volumes', 'long', 'still', ""n't"", 'ended', 'think', 'anime', 'creators', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'picking', 'things', 'were', 'cut', 'still', 'felt', 'little', 'rushed', 'places.Obviously', 'pros', 'far', 'outweigh', 'cons', 'should', 'totally', 'watch', 'series', 'set', 'pretty', 'cheap', '30', 'price', 'originally', 'paid', 'series', 'are', 'getting', 'quite', 'bargain', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'watched', 'series', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'have', ""n't"", 'see', 'English', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'not', 'really', 'liked', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A

The series shows us that the fate of the world and humanity is about to be decided on two factions with members who wield incredible powers and abilities, one faction believes that humanity is a lost cause and must be eliminated to save the world the other faction believes that humanity can learn from its mistakes and doesn't need to be destroyed to save the earth.  The ultimate fate on this point will fall on one man and the choice he makes on whether to save or destroy humanity and the consequences of those choices as well,  the series characters are all endearing and tragic as you actually can see both sides and their reasons for their choices in this conflict and you actually feel you can empathize with both groups and during their battles you will feel sadness on the fates of both faction members.  The series is part of the Clamp Manga universe but is probably one of their more darker series released,  the animation and soundtrack are great and fit the series well and the voice cast for the subbed and dubbed actors/actresses did a great job in their character roles.  The series is somewhat bloody and violent pretty much so pretty much not for younger kids,  the set itself is different from the previous released version that was out a few years ago in that the series is onto four dvds instead of the eight but the video quality is very good so no worries on that part.  The extras as always are pretty much the trailers and intro/ending songs so nothing to really shout about,  so if you're looking for a dark action anime or just looking for a great series here's one  tho check out for your anime library....",5,"A Great But Tragic Series Of Friendship, Sacrifice, AndUltimately The Choices We Make",1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,1733,"['series', 'exciting', 'storyline', 'action', 'also', 'tragic', 'provoking', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'fate', 'world', 'humanity', 'be', 'decided', 'two', 'factions', 'members', 'who', 'wield', 'incredible', 'powers', 'abilities', 'one', 'faction', 'humanity', 'lost', 'cause', 'must', 'be', 'eliminated', 'save', 'world', 'other', 'faction', 'humanity', 'can', 'learn', 'mistakes', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'destroyed', 'save', 'earth', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'point', 'will', 'fall', 'one', 'man', 'choice', 'save', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'consequences', 'choices', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'tragic', 'actually', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'reasons', 'choices', 'conflict', 'actually', 'feel', 'can', 'empathize', 'groups', 'battles', 'will', 'feel', 'sadness', 'fates', 'faction', 'members', 'series', 'part', 'Clamp', 'Manga', 'universe', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'darker', 'series', 'released', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'great', 'fit', 'series', 'well', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'actors/actresses', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'roles', 'series', 'somewhat', 'bloody', 'violent', 'pretty', 'much', 'pretty', 'much', 'not', 'younger', 'kids', 'set', 'different', 'previous', 'released', 'version', 'was', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'series', 'four', 'dvds', 'instead', 'eight', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'worries', 'part', 'extras', 'always', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'trailers', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'so', 'nothing', 'really', 'shout', 'about', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dark', 'action', 'anime', 'just', 'looking', 'great', 'series', 'here', 'one', 'tho', 'check', 'anime', 'library']",N/A

This one is about two forces fighting each other known as the Dragons of Earth and Heaven which will decide the fate of the world.  I can say the design of this series was way thought out.,5,Anime review,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,295,"['anime', 'series', 'one', 'CLAMP', 'earlier', 'works', 'when', 'arrived', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'condition', 'one', 'two', 'forces', 'fighting', 'other', 'known', 'Dragons', 'Earth', 'Heaven', 'will', 'decide', 'fate', 'world', 'can', 'say', 'design', 'series', 'was', 'way', 'thought', 'out']",N/A
1336764,AASNFQTM2QKOY,B003CP62DO,Super Dragon,"[2, 3]","Wait. hold on. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. If you're first thought after looking at the cover was that this is a yaoi anime then you're incorrect. Fortunately, it's not. Now to what this anime is all about.Story:It's about the Dragons of Heaven-the seven seals and the Dragons of Earth-the seven angels. The Dragons of Heaven want to protect earth and preserve the way it is now. The Dragons of Earth want to change the world which has been abused by humans and start over again. Each side has seven characters who come from different parts of Japan and gather in Tokyo for the final battle that will decide the fate of earth. Kamui, (the main character) doesn't choose a side right from the start. (I won't tell you which side he does choose)If you're wondering if there's history to each character you won't be disappointed. There's history for all the characters. some have more than others. As for the swords, they are called Shinken. they are divine swords that can only be wielded by Kamui.Video and audio quality;The quality of the animation and visuals is good and so are the special effects. There's even one part where Kamui's eyes turn visibly brighter when he attacks his enemies. As for the audio both the Japanese and English are in 5.1. Both have good voice acting. The music is good but the one downside to it is that it plays a lot throughout the entire series.Other thoughts:The word Kamui has two meanings (this is explained in the anime) The first meaning: A person who acts with God's power. The second meaning: he who hunts the authority of God. In other words Kamui has a choice to become either a Dragon of heaven or a Dragon of Earth.If you're not really into the whole story line and history then just watch the movie. It's a lot more violent and is under an hour and 40 minutes. The movie and the series have a different end though.The reason I give this series 4 stars is because it reiterates the same things quite often.",4,X.
