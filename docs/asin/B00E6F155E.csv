1665005,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B00E6F155E,applewood,"[1, 2]","4+ stars.The core of this 2 disc set is Gabriel performing in Athens Greece in October of 1987 (supposedly the ""full show"", but probably culled from a multi date set),and it is a really great concert - a great band, great set list, and great audience - despite the dated clothing/appearances on stage - lol. I especially like that it is Gabriel as his dramatic self, but without all the elaborate yet somewhat distracting props that were soon to come (seePeter Gabriel - Secret World Live). This show alone would be enough reason to get this DVD, but the real bonus for me is that Youssou N'Dour was with him.The concert disc begins with N'Dour and his Senegalese band Le Super Etoile De Dakar as the warm up act with a set of 5 vibrant songs, that are a nice contrast to the slick PG show that follows. I think this is the first concert DVD I've ever seen that also shows the warm up band! Youssou is at the beginning of his meteoric rise here. He would on go to become an even more popular and famous performer than Gabriel (in 2004 Rolling Stone described him as ""perhaps the most famous singer alive"", I'd also add that he is perhaps in the top handful of the greatest vocalists alive). The inclusion of Youssou's set is a real treat, and having him and some of his band join PG for the last 2 songs of the main concert are the highlights of that show (the 15+ minute version of ""In Your Eyes"" is quite remarkable).Disc 2 is another great bonus; Gabriel's 23 music videos from 1980 to 2004. Gabriel always has had a reputation for theatrics and top quality production, and these videos show an abundance of creativity. They may not be the kind of thing you want to watch very often but they are nice to have - and express an era (early MTV) well.",5,Peter Gabriel Live + - Like 3 DVDs in one,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,1750,"['4+', 'stars.The', 'core', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'Gabriel', 'performing', 'Athens', 'Greece', 'October', '1987', 'supposedly', 'full', 'show', 'probably', 'culled', 'multi', 'date', 'set', 'really', 'great', 'concert', 'great', 'band', 'great', 'set', 'list', 'great', 'audience', 'dated', 'clothing/appearances', 'stage', 'lol', 'especially', 'Gabriel', 'dramatic', 'self', 'elaborate', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'props', 'were', 'soon', 'come', 'seePeter', 'Gabriel', 'Secret', 'World', 'Live', 'show', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'real', 'bonus', 'Youssou', ""N'Dour"", 'was', 'him.The', 'concert', 'disc', ""N'Dour"", 'Senegalese', 'band', 'Le', 'Super', 'Etoile', 'De', 'Dakar', 'warm', 'up', 'act', 'set', '5', 'vibrant', 'songs', 'are', 'nice', 'contrast', 'slick', 'PG', 'show', 'think', 'first', 'concert', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'warm', 'up', 'band', 'Youssou', 'beginning', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'here', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'famous', 'performer', 'Gabriel', '2004', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'described', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'singer', 'alive', ""'d"", 'also', 'add', 'perhaps', 'top', 'handful', 'greatest', 'vocalists', 'alive', 'inclusion', 'Youssou', 'set', 'real', 'treat', 'having', 'band', 'join', 'PG', 'last', '2', 'songs', 'main', 'concert', 'are', 'highlights', 'show', '15+', 'minute', 'version', 'Eyes', 'quite', 'remarkable', '2', 'great', 'bonus', 'Gabriel', '23', 'music', 'videos', '1980', '2004', 'Gabriel', 'always', 'had', 'reputation', 'theatrics', 'top', 'quality', 'production', 'videos', 'show', 'abundance', 'creativity', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'kind', 'thing', 'want', 'watch', 'very', 'often', 'are', 'nice', 'have', 'express', 'era', 'early', 'MTV', 'well']",N/A
1665006,A2W5J2PHD9D65J,B00E6F155E,Bardwire777,"[10, 36]","I am not reviewing the product because I already own so many Live Peter Gabriel albums, so please forgive me if I sound ungrateful.  Of course I celebrate the Peter of yesteryear, the experimental Peter of the 1980s, the emotionally magnificent Peter of the 1990s, the dark edgy Peter of 2000, but what I need now, and I mean I NEED this like another Chapter to the Book of Life, is a new Peter Gabriel that speaks to this decade, to this time, to this point of his life.  Yes, yes, I know his music is about the heart and therefore transcends time - but we're also talking about one of the most significant songwriters of his generation (or EVER in my book) and though every artist gets older, I would love for him to do as Yeats says and ""rage against the dying of the light.""  His new masterpiece could be recorded in a dingy basement with only a baby grande, it could be captured in a peeling broken down barn with only an accoustic guitar, bass and a Polish steel drum player (don't laugh...peter could find one)and locusts ringing in the summer air.My point is, it doesn't have to be PERFECT, nothing is perfect, if fact, art is only enhanced by raw imperfections, and most importantly, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO ""LIVE UP TO"" THIS NOSTALGIA WORSHIPPING GREATEST HITS CULTURE.  It only needs to be an expression of Peter Gabriel whatever that is, broken free from the pressures of yesteryear's stadium shows.  I wish he would let us into his Secret World.  It's not that I don't appreciate the re-releases of older classics, but Peter is good enough not to need to do SO much of it.I was at the Hollywood Bowl show last October where he performed SO in its entirety (one of my favorite albums of all time) and yes it was great to see John Cusak watching from the wings with tears in his eyes, but the HIGHLIGHT of that show was when Peter busted out an untitled song that was so new that he didn't even have lyrics for it.  I'm listening to this gorgeous ballad and I'm thinking, ""I NEED THIS SONG, MY LIFE NEEDS THIS - BUT WHERE ARE THE WORDS???""  Of course I was appreciative of this peek into his creative process, but all he needed to do was write something down...ANYTHING and we, the audience would have followed his powerful instincts like puppies after the shaman's kibble.  I feel that episode sadly embodied the reason why I haven't seen an album of new Peter Gabriel songs in over 10 years, he's too careful with his jewels.  And as I said, he doesn't need to be.  The music business has changed so much and I have heard some truly earth-shattering songs from the most minimal of productions (Eluvium, Grouper, Bon Ivar)  Of course, it's Peter's work and he can do whatever he darn well pleases, but it's only my two cents that his greatness is not something that only existed in 1987, and with this current output many youngins might think that he's a dated artist cashing in on his former accomplishments.  I personally refuse to believe this.  Peter's greatest work is yet to come.  I only wish he would release it in the same spiritual, musical, emotional, unpretentious outpour that he is known and LOVED for.",5,Thanks but...

THE SOUND QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD. I REALIZED THAT THE VIDEO AFFECTS FROM THE OLDER VERSION WAS EDITED OUT, SO YOU REALLY FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE CONCERT. THE ONLY THING I REALLY MISSED, WAS THE VIDEO EFFECTS ON GAMES WITHOUT FRONTIERS.

But from and audio standpoint. Eh. As others have mentioned maybe some over dubbing going on. But it's not too bad. Maybe it was needed ...who knows after decades of storage. The video is pretty good to considering the age and transfer. Seeing these guys and hearing this music 30 years younger brings back some fond memories. However this isn't a Blu Ray that I'd pop in the system as a reference show for any one.,3,Good to have if you're a fan.
