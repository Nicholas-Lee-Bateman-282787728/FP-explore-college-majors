Premiering on the WB network in September 1998, the show (along with Dawson's Creek) helped ignite a firestorm of highly successful original series on behalf of the upstart network, with such hit shows as Angel (1999), Gilmore Girls (2000), and Smallville (2001). The brainchild of writer J.J. Abrams (creator of the two hit series Alias and Lost), Felicity follows the life of a recent high school graduate, not through seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, but through Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Similar in genre to its contemporary, Dawson's Creek, Felicity's cast is of approximately the same age, but the setting is college instead of high school...Felicity begins when the star of the series, Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), graduates from high school. Having harbored a four-year crush on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), despite the fact they've never talked, Felicity musters the courage in the aftermath of their commencement ceremony to ask him to sign her yearbook. When Ben writes some surprising comments, Felicity decides to follow him to fictional University of New York (UNY) instead of pursuing her goal of pre-med at Stanford. Against her parent's wishes, she enrolls in the school and moves cross country where she becomes roommates with Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), a girl whose lifestyle clashes with her own, and where she meets resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley) who immediately develops a crush on her. When Ben learns of the true reason for Felicity's enrollment, he's both flattered and a little uncertain about Felicity's mental stability. In the ensuing four years, Felicity goes through the basic trials and travails of a maturing college student, experiencing the ups and downs of life, love, and adulthood...The Felicity (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Christening"" in which Felicity learns from Javier that a man is giving away his furniture before moving to another state. When she visits his apartment, she falls in love with the place and agrees to rent it so that she and Ben can live there together. Ben, however, is out of town at the time and must live with Felicity's decision despite his belief that the place is a dump. Meanwhile, Noel has dropped out of school, eloped, and decided to become a full-time party animal... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Kissing Mr. Covington"" in which Felicity's attempts to console Ben's estranged father result in him kissing her, much to her and Ben's dismay, and ""Blackout"" in which everyone gathers together to watch Sean's ""Docuventary,"" only to have a storm knock out the power, prompting a series of interpersonal conflicts...Below is a list of episodes included on the Felicity (Season 3) DVD:Episode 46 (The Christening)Episode 47 (The Anti-Natalie Intervention)Episode 48 (Hello, I Must Be Going)Episode 49 (Greeks and Geeks)Episode 50 (Surprise)Episode 51 (One Ball, Two Strikes)Episode 52 (Kissing Mr. Covington)Episode 53 (A Good Egg)Episode 54 (James and the Giant Piece)Episode 55 (Final Touches)Episode 56 (And to All a Good Night)Episode 57 (Girlfight)Episode 58 (Blackout)Episode 59 (The Break-Up Kit)Episode 60 (Senioritis)Episode 61 (It's Raining Men)Episode 62 (The Last Summer Ever)The DVD Report",5,Junior year...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3442,"['Nominated', '2', 'Emmys', '2', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'TV', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Felicity', 'gathered', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'short', 'four', 'season', 'stint', 'Premiering', 'WB', 'network', 'September', '1998', 'show', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'helped', 'ignite', 'firestorm', 'highly', 'successful', 'original', 'series', 'behalf', 'upstart', 'network', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Angel', '1999', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', '2000', 'Smallville', '2001', 'brainchild', 'writer', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'two', 'hit', 'series', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'Felicity', 'life', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'not', 'seasons', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior', 'years', 'Similar', 'genre', 'contemporary', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Felicity', 'cast', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'setting', 'college', 'instead', 'high', 'school', 'Felicity', 'when', 'star', 'series', 'Felicity', 'Porter', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'high', 'school', 'Having', 'harbored', 'four-year', 'crush', 'classmate', 'Ben', 'Covington', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'talked', 'Felicity', 'courage', 'aftermath', 'commencement', 'ceremony', 'ask', 'sign', 'yearbook', 'When', 'Ben', 'surprising', 'comments', 'Felicity', 'follow', 'fictional', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'UNY', 'instead', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'pre-med', 'Stanford', 'parent', 'wishes', 'school', 'moves', 'cross', 'country', 'where', 'roommates', 'Meghan', 'Rotundi', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'girl', 'lifestyle', 'clashes', 'own', 'where', 'resident', 'advisor', 'Noel', 'Crane', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'who', 'immediately', 'crush', 'When', 'Ben', 'true', 'reason', 'Felicity', 'enrollment', 'flattered', 'little', 'uncertain', 'Felicity', 'mental', 'stability', 'ensuing', 'four', 'years', 'Felicity', 'basic', 'trials', 'travails', 'maturing', 'college', 'student', 'experiencing', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'love', 'adulthood', 'Felicity', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Christening', 'Felicity', 'Javier', 'man', 'giving', 'away', 'furniture', 'moving', 'state', 'When', 'apartment', 'love', 'place', 'rent', 'so', 'Ben', 'can', 'live', 'there', 'together', 'Ben', 'however', 'town', 'time', 'must', 'live', 'Felicity', 'decision', 'belief', 'place', 'dump', 'Meanwhile', 'Noel', 'dropped', 'school', 'eloped', 'decided', 'become', 'full-time', 'party', 'animal', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Kissing', 'Mr.', 'Covington', 'Felicity', 'attempts', 'console', 'Ben', 'estranged', 'father', 'result', 'kissing', 'much', 'Ben', 'dismay', 'Blackout', 'everyone', 'gathers', 'together', 'watch', 'Sean', 'Docuventary', 'only', 'have', 'storm', 'knock', 'power', 'prompting', 'series', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Felicity', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '46', 'Christening', 'Episode', '47', 'Anti-Natalie', 'Intervention', 'Episode', '48', 'Hello', 'Must', 'Be', 'Going', '49', 'Greeks', 'Geeks', 'Episode', '50', 'Surprise', 'Episode', '51', 'One', 'Ball', 'Two', 'Strikes', 'Episode', '52', 'Kissing', 'Mr.', 'Covington', 'Episode', '53', 'Good', 'Egg', 'Episode', '54', 'James', 'Giant', 'Piece', 'Episode', '55', 'Final', 'Touches', 'Episode', '56', 'Good', 'Night', 'Episode', '57', 'Girlfight', 'Episode', '58', 'Blackout', 'Episode', '59', 'Break-Up', 'Kit', 'Episode', '60', 'Senioritis', 'Episode', '61', 'Raining', 'Men', 'Episode', '62', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Ever', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

With only 17 episodes, there was not as much character development or crazy activities taking place.  As I felt with many series, even when the episode scheduling is out of the producers' control, the spring semester or spring season seems to progress too quickly.  That was definitely the case with this season.  Even though it may have been out of their control, I wish they would have had better transitions through the midway episodes.  I also think this season dealt with less academic issues, and thus, it seemed the characters didn't take school seriously and rarely studied.  True, it is not real life, but the show could have done a better job of incorporating academic as well as relationship issues.

806993,A399W215YXYNOX,B0001I55RY,J. Toteda,"[10, 11]","Season three is a must buy after watching the first two...in this season we get to see Ben and Felicity's relationship evolve. I know a lot of people didn't get into the major melodramatic plot lines, music etc.... but I have to disagree. Felicity has this great balance of comedy and drama. Scott Speedman is an amazing actor and both he and Kerri have such a magical chemistry on camera. It's truly magical.College is a major chapter in anyone's life, it's where you learn to be independent, yet at the same time your building strong lasting friendships. When Felicity first came out I was two years from graduating from high-school, when it ended I was two years away from graduating from university and I have to say watching Felicity was like therapy for me. I was sad when it ended because it's after collage where things really get interesting and decisions get harder. Now in my senior year this is very clear to me. Watching the characters discover not just what they want to do with their lives but also who they are is something everyone can relate with. One of the best things Felicity does in answering these questions is that there is no right answers...as Felicity says in season 2, one of the reason she choose to go with Ben is because if she didn't she would never know what it would have been like. Taking leaps of faith into something that is uncertain is admirable. So take a leap of faith people and buy this DVD! I recommend buying the first two seasons as well to see the development of characters like Megan, Sean, Elena, Julie, Felicity and Ben....Richard, and Javier are hilarious! Noel this season goes through the most character downfalls as he begins to challenge always being the ""nice guy"". Scott Foley does a great job at portraying Noel in crisis.I know I'm going on and on....I just want to end in saying that buying Felicity on DVD is a great investment.

806996,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001I55RY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[32, 37]","What was true about the second season of ""Felicity"" is even truer about the third season, a.k.a. ""Junior Year"": I watched this show despite the title character and not because of her.  For me the idea that the show might have ""jumped the shark"" did not come when Keri Russell cut her hair, but rather when Felicity chose Ben (Scott Speedman) over Noel (Scott Foley).  This is not to say that Ben does not have his moments, but they are almost always BAD moments.  Plus there is the vicious cycle of their relationship.  One of them does something ""wrong,"" at which point Ben gets mad and Felicity cries, but she wants to talk about it and he does not (and she gets her way).  It is actually a good thing that I know what happens at the end of the series, because that way I do not have to have a vested interest in Felicity's love life, which is fine, because the grand irony is that Felicity is not why I watch ""Felicity.""I watch ""Felicity"" primarily for Megan (Amanda Foreman) and Sean (Greg Grunberg).  Whoever decided to take those two scene stealing characters and throw them together into what is one of the great opposites attract pairings in the history of television was either a genius or really lucky.  When I think about what are my favorite moments are from the junior year of ""Felicity"" they basically boil down to Megan being serious with Sean about important things like his cancer (""One Ball, Two Strikes"") or their relationship (""It's Raining Men"").  Watching Megan strip away everything to get down to the level of absolute honesty was always a big moment.  Then there is when Megan is so touched by Sean wearing ass-less pants for a fetish party (""James and the Giant Piece""), and her taking the phone sex job (""Greeks and Geeks"").  The writers knew what they had with these two and gave them several great opportunities to shine.On the Felicity front life is just a continuing series of trauma, with are heroine getting a hell hole apartment to share with Ben (""The Christening""), waking up in some frat guy's bed (""Greeks and Geeks""), gets kissed by Ben's father (""Kissing Mr. Covington""), gets asked by Javier to donate an egg so he and Samuel can be parents (""A Good Egg""), another visit from her mom (""And to All a Good Night""), Avery going after Ben (""Blackout""), Avery kissing Ben (""The Breakup Kit""), Noel kissing Felicity (""Senioritist""), and the biggest trauma of all, what to do in the summer (""The Last Summer Ever"").When the WB stopped broadcasting on WGN my particular neck of the northern woods ended up being the largest television market in the nation without the WB (or maybe it was South Bend, but we were in the running), so after the first couple of episodes in Season 2 the only way to see the show was if I when my brother taped ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" for us if it remembered to tape ""Felicity"" as well.  So I saw some of the Avery episodes, enough to start clucking again over Felicity choosing Ben again.  More so than watching season two, for me watching Felicity and Ben during season three was the comic relief, which means that I am pretty much reading this show completely opposite of the way it was intended.  Yet, strangely enough, I am happy with that and it does not take away from my enjoyment of the series.After all, the relationship between Elena (Tangi Miller) and Tracy (Donald Faison), is pretty much through the mirror, with her wanting to have sex and him wanting to wait until marriage (""The Christening"").  You have to admit that particular role reversal is refreshing, and Tracy's Christian principles and Sean's brush with death making him decide to start to start practicing his Jewish faith and finally have his bar mitzvah (""Senioritis""), ""Felicity"" was one of the few television series to deal with religion in a substantial way (""7th Heaven"" being the exception that prove the rule on this score), although ""BtVS"" deal with Wiccans a bit better.Stil, the tragic figure for me is poor Noel, who comes back from vacation married only to have his friends band together to put an end to it (""The Anti-Natalie Intervention""), and gets to work closely with Felicity on an internet cartoon (""Final Touches (a.k.a. Let's Get It On)""), just so he can have painful reminders of what he has lost on a regular basis.  If you liked Noel's ""Break Up Kit,"" then his lovely parting gift, ""Our Official Time Capsule,"" only underscores that Felicity made a serious mistake when the mental coin she flipped to make her decision came up tails.

806999,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B0001I55RY,Missing Person,"[5, 6]","With the 5 disc ""Junior Year Collection"" of ""Felicity"", one of the bonus features is the extremely insightful and entertaining ""'Docuventary': A Look Back At Season 3"" where director Lawrence Trilling says the third season added a lot more humor into the show.  That's pretty ironic because the thing that's really striking about this 3rd season really isn't the humor as much as it is the incredible dramatic tension in episode after episode with the terrific writing that's often surprisingly imaginative, for instance the somewhat over-the-top 'revival' of the Avery character played by Kristin Lehman.  No matter how over-the-top it gets, the show remains winningly human and realistic at its core, and as with the first two seasons, you get convincing, believable performances all around.  The late John Ritter was nicely incorporated into the show during this season as Ben's extremely troubled alcoholic father, and Scott Speedman (Ben) and Scott Foley (Noel) are outstanding just like they were in the previous 2 seasons.  Of course, the unlikely pairing of Sean (Greg Grunberg) and Meghan (Amanda Foreman) offer a lot of entertainment value, as do the pair of almost-impossible-to-take-seriously characters: Javier (Ian Gomez) and Richard Coad (Robert Patrick Benedict).  Through it all, the show manages to stay remarkably down-to-earth, avoiding pomposity, and to call it addictive would be putting it lightly--this third season of ""Felicity"" is simply brilliant, and the enlightening bonus features take it that extra mile.",5,brilliant--dramatic tension galore!,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1535,"['5', 'disc', 'Junior', 'Year', 'Collection', 'Felicity', 'one', 'bonus', 'extremely', 'insightful', 'entertaining', ""'Docuventary"", 'Look', 'Back', 'Season', '3', 'where', 'director', 'Lawrence', 'Trilling', 'third', 'season', 'added', 'lot', 'more', 'humor', 'show', 'pretty', 'ironic', 'thing', 'really', 'striking', '3rd', 'season', 'really', ""n't"", 'humor', 'as', 'much', 'incredible', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'episode', 'episode', 'terrific', 'writing', 'often', 'surprisingly', 'imaginative', 'instance', 'somewhat', 'over-the-top', ""'revival"", 'Avery', 'character', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Lehman', 'matter', 'how', 'over-the-top', 'show', 'winningly', 'human', 'realistic', 'core', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'get', 'convincing', 'believable', 'performances', 'around', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'nicely', 'incorporated', 'show', 'season', 'Ben', 'extremely', 'troubled', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Ben', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'Noel', 'are', 'outstanding', 'just', 'were', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'course', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'Sean', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'Meghan', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'offer', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'value', 'do', 'pair', 'almost-impossible-to-take-seriously', 'characters', 'Javier', 'Ian', 'Gomez', 'Richard', 'Coad', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Benedict', 'show', 'stay', 'remarkably', 'down-to-earth', 'avoiding', 'pomposity', 'call', 'addictive', 'would', 'be', 'putting', 'lightly', 'third', 'season', 'Felicity', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'enlightening', 'bonus', 'features', 'take', 'extra', 'mile']",N/A

807001,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001I55RY,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","There are a lot of changes in FELICITY during Season Three, few of them for the better.  This can be seen even in the opening credits, where the gorgeous black and white photos of the first two seasons were replaced by an uninspiring montage from the first two seasons to go along with some insipid song about changing as a person.  I don't know what motivated this, but I would guess that it was the result of pressure by the network.  Usually when really bad things like this happen, it is because the corporate powers that be put them pressure on them to make changes.More troubling is that the story arcs of Season 3 just lack the oomph of the story arcs of the first two seasons.  Especially in the second half of Season 2 the dramatic tension was at times overwhelming.  The situations created by the writers in Season 3 more often than not feel contrived and artificial.  And not only are the arcs not as good, there are not as many of them.  Season 3 is far shorter than any of the other three seasons.Still, the show never gets actually bad.  And I like that they kept Felicity and Ben a couple all season.  Few Hollywood shows are willing to take up the challenge of keeping a shows main romantic couple together.  Noel spends the year as the odd man out, without a major relationship like he had in Season 2 with Ruby.  He does, however, start the season off involved in a hideously inappropriate marriage and briefly becomes essentially a stalker of Tyra Banks.One thing that I really like about FELICITY in all of its seasons is a near complete rejection of fairy tale endings.  Good things happen, but more often than not there is no deus ex machina to rescue characters when they get into bad situations.  Bad things happen and they just get past them rather than easily triumph over them.  Though the show doesn't compare well with the first two seasons, it nonetheless remained highly watchable.  I am not the fan of Sean and Meghan that some are, but it is fun to see their roles expand in this season.  The one downer is that Amy Jo Johnson left the show, reportedly because of the death of her mother.  Her absence did hurt the show.",4,Good -- but lacking the dramatic tension of the first two seasons,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,2153,"['are', 'lot', 'changes', 'FELICITY', 'Season', 'Three', 'few', 'better', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'where', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'replaced', 'uninspiring', 'montage', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'go', 'along', 'insipid', 'song', 'about', 'changing', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'motivated', 'would', 'guess', 'was', 'result', 'pressure', 'network', 'Usually', 'when', 'really', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'corporate', 'powers', 'be', 'put', 'pressure', 'make', 'changes.More', 'troubling', 'story', 'arcs', 'Season', '3', 'just', 'lack', 'oomph', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Especially', 'second', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'was', 'times', 'overwhelming', 'situations', 'created', 'writers', 'Season', '3', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'feel', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'arcs', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'Season', '3', 'far', 'shorter', 'other', 'three', 'seasons.Still', 'show', 'never', 'actually', 'bad', 'like', 'kept', 'Felicity', 'Ben', 'couple', 'season', 'Few', 'Hollywood', 'shows', 'are', 'willing', 'take', 'up', 'challenge', 'keeping', 'shows', 'main', 'romantic', 'couple', 'together', 'Noel', 'year', 'odd', 'man', 'major', 'relationship', 'had', 'Season', '2', 'Ruby', 'however', 'start', 'season', 'off', 'involved', 'hideously', 'inappropriate', 'marriage', 'briefly', 'becomes', 'essentially', 'stalker', 'Tyra', 'Banks.One', 'thing', 'really', 'FELICITY', 'seasons', 'near', 'complete', 'rejection', 'fairy', 'tale', 'endings', 'Good', 'things', 'happen', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'rescue', 'characters', 'when', 'get', 'bad', 'situations', 'Bad', 'things', 'happen', 'just', 'get', 'past', 'rather', 'easily', 'triumph', 'show', ""n't"", 'compare', 'well', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'nonetheless', 'remained', 'highly', 'watchable', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Meghan', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'roles', 'expand', 'season', 'one', 'downer', 'Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'left', 'show', 'reportedly', 'death', 'mother', 'absence', 'did', 'hurt', 'show']",N/A
