The acting wasn't good, but it left me and I think others will see it too with equal points of view for and against torture. This is the main theme throughout the movie raising questions about the ethics of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques. However it's cleverly presenting a larger theme in that of the life of today's American soldier. I got to think most of these guys sign up because it's a career path it's a way to make money and get some training for a job. And especially in today's America where there is a dying economy no jobs and overpriced tuition I can't blame them for signing up for a war that they don't want to be involved in anyways. However soldiers are for the most part kids in the prime of their life, being asked to piss away those years in boredom and psychological time games. It's no surprise most of these guys come back and are screwed up in head and have to be on anti-depressants. I could live with that if these countries had an airforce, navy, or any way of threatening our way of life here. The real threat is a terrorist blowing off a nuke in a city in America, and honestly we'd be much better served putting these soldiers to work in this country monitoring stadiums, borders, and airplanes. We should invest in nuke-detecting drones that fly all over our country and get the soldiers out of these pointless &#34;wars&#34;",5,Asks the question,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,1432,"['What', 'hell', 'are', 'sending', 'kids', 'places', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'left', 'think', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'too', 'equal', 'points', 'view', 'torture', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'raising', 'questions', 'ethics', 'torture', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'However', 'cleverly', 'presenting', 'larger', 'theme', 'life', 'today', 'American', 'soldier', 'got', 'think', 'most', 'guys', 'sign', 'up', 'career', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'get', 'training', 'job', 'especially', 'today', 'America', 'where', 'dying', 'economy', 'jobs', 'overpriced', 'tuition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'signing', 'up', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'anyways', 'However', 'soldiers', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'kids', 'prime', 'life', 'being', 'asked', 'piss', 'away', 'years', 'boredom', 'psychological', 'time', 'games', 'surprise', 'most', 'guys', 'come', 'back', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'head', 'have', 'be', 'anti-depressants', 'could', 'live', 'countries', 'had', 'airforce', 'navy', 'way', 'threatening', 'way', 'life', 'here', 'real', 'threat', 'terrorist', 'blowing', 'off', 'nuke', 'city', 'America', 'honestly', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'putting', 'soldiers', 'work', 'country', 'monitoring', 'stadiums', 'borders', 'airplanes', 'should', 'invest', 'nuke-detecting', 'drones', 'fly', 'country', 'get', 'soldiers', 'pointless', '34', 'wars', '34']",Boys of Abu Ghraib

1693192,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00I1O34KA,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","This is a gritty war drama that utilizes Abu Ghraib and answers the question posed at the end, ""What kind of person could do this?""Jack (Luke Moran) is the all American boy who volunteers to join the service. He is on a boring 6 month tour in the motor pool at Abu Ghraib. Bored with his job, he volunteers to help out the short handed MPs on the ""Hard Side."" Without any training, save for a quick tour by Sean Astin, Jack is now a fully functional guard of some the the world's most dangerous men.Jack is initially appalled at the treatment of the prisoners. he is told ""You get used to it."" Jack's enthusiasm wanes as his tour gets extended, turning into the man he never thought he could be.The film shows some of the torture at Abu Ghraib, but is mild compared to what has been described in the media. The humiliation and much of the torture is down played and can be considered justified to a sympathetic viewer attempting to understand the events. The Military Intelligence and contractors were only briefly mentioned and played no role.For those you want to see a woman order naked men to make a pyramid or play leap frog will have to look elsewhere. This film treats the situation perhaps with more sympathy and dignity than it deserves, while at the same time giving us a gritty tale on how ""a person could do something like that.""Worth a view for modern war fans,Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex. male rear nudity.",4,IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO THINK.,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,1426,"['gritty', 'war', 'drama', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'question', 'posed', 'end', 'What', 'kind', 'person', 'could', 'do', 'Jack', 'Luke', 'Moran', 'all', 'American', 'boy', 'who', 'join', 'service', 'boring', '6', 'month', 'tour', 'motor', 'pool', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'Bored', 'job', 'help', 'out', 'short', 'handed', 'MPs', 'Hard', 'Side', 'training', 'save', 'quick', 'tour', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Jack', 'now', 'fully', 'functional', 'guard', 'world', 'most', 'dangerous', 'men.Jack', 'initially', 'appalled', 'treatment', 'prisoners', 'told', 'get', 'used', 'Jack', 'enthusiasm', 'wanes', 'tour', 'extended', 'turning', 'man', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'be.The', 'film', 'torture', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'mild', 'compared', 'what', 'been', 'described', 'media', 'humiliation', 'much', 'torture', 'down', 'played', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'justified', 'sympathetic', 'viewer', 'attempting', 'understand', 'events', 'Military', 'Intelligence', 'contractors', 'were', 'only', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'played', 'role.For', 'want', 'see', 'woman', 'order', 'naked', 'men', 'make', 'pyramid', 'play', 'leap', 'frog', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'situation', 'perhaps', 'more', 'sympathy', 'dignity', 'same', 'time', 'giving', 'gritty', 'tale', 'how', 'person', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'view', 'modern', 'war', 'fans', 'Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'brief', 'sex', 'male', 'rear', 'nudity']",Boys of Abu Ghraib
1693193,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00I1O34KA,Tony Heck,"[1, 1]","&#34;I've gotten to know this guy, whatever he's in here for he did not do.&#34; Jack Farmer (Moran) is a soldier on his first tour in Iraq. After a few months he becomes bored and applies to be an MP. He is assigned to the base in Abu Ghraib. He shows up as a wide eyed trusting soldier. After breaking the rules and talking to an inmate things begin to change, the rest is history. First of all the movie is a little slow moving but the fact that its a true story makes it that much more interesting and is enough to keep you watching. This is a movie where just about everyone knows how it will turn out but that only adds to the intrigue. While there isn't much action in this I will say some parts are very graphic and hard to watch. This doesn't show half of what we were told went on but that is a good thing. The thing I found most interesting was watching how Jack goes from a naive guard to part of the problem. While the story is important the movie doesn't do it justice. I really think the movie needs to be redone in a way that doesn't have a made for TV movie feel. To me the best part was the last 2 minutes. Overall, important but again the movie doesn't do the story justice. I give this a B-.",3,The story is important but the movie doesn't do it justice.
