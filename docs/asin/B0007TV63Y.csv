The exercises themselves were good, but not for the more advanced exerciser.  I will look elsewhere for an awesome abs workout.

But of course, they don't have the pretty beach scenery.The cardio workout is hardly a cardio workout, it is more like a warm-up.There is one thing that is really getting on my nerves, which is the instrucor saying ""uh-huh"" all the time.But I did like the instructions that were given on proper form and also the tips for healthy eating.

I have always liked this instructor a lot but I feel that her workouts are geared more towards beginners.  I need a more challenging routine to feel that I got a good workout.

890691,A28711BADD9UPD,B0007TV63Y,J. Fugett,"[91, 91]","Self: Firm Flat Abs Fast! is a sculpting workout that is just shy of 30 minutes in length.  On the DVD there is also a bonus cardio workout--at 5 minutes it's really only suitable as a warm-up. You'll need one 3 to 8 pound dumbbell and a stability ball.This workout is broken up into four chapters, which can be done independently of one another.  The first chapter is just classic crunches--very familiar to just about everyone.  The second chapter incorporates the stability ball.  The first few moves of this chapter aren't for exercisers with low ceilings, but they should be easy to modify.  The third chapter is Pilates-inspired ab work.  The fourth chapter includes some very graceful yoga-inspired moves.  There is also a short cool-down segment at the end. None of the moves in this workout are mindblowingly new or different--they're all good solid well-tested moves packaged into one workout.Violet Zaki, the instructor, discusses the workout before the warmup (you can fast-forward through that) and then at the end she has a rather long section discussing proper form and diet and how both contribute to better fitness.  The diet advice is pretty common sense stuff, but it never hurts to hear it one more time.The setting is absolutely gorgeous. The workout filmed on the beach at a resort near Puerto Vallarta.  You can hear the waves crashing on the beach in the background, which is very calming.  As an instructor, Violet is very motivating. She cues well and keeps the patter (and the whooping) to a bare minimum. There are two backup exercisers, one of which is modifying. They are very ""normal"" looking--trim and fit without being overly lean. Violet looks strong and healthy.The only thing I've found to give this DVD demerits on are the five or six commercials at the beginning. You can fast foward through them (or hit the Menu button) but still--I paid for my DVD and I don't feel like paying more for it by giving my time to these ads. It's why I only rated this DVD 4 stars.  Without the ads, it's a 5 star DVD with beautiful production values and good chaptering.As a high-intermediate/low-advanced exerciser, I think this one is worth picking up as an add-on or for light days. I can definitely feel it in my abs after I do this workout, but I have yet to experience any DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) from it.  I would recommend this workout to just about any level of exerciser--if you do this workout, eat right, and get in regular cardiovascular exercise, you will definitely see results.",4,"Well produced, safe, and fun intermediate-level ab workout!",1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,2527,"['Self', 'Firm', 'Flat', 'Abs', 'Fast', 'sculpting', 'workout', 'just', 'shy', '30', 'minutes', 'length', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'cardio', 'workout', '5', 'minutes', 'really', 'only', 'suitable', 'warm-up', ""'ll"", 'need', 'one', '3', '8', 'pound', 'dumbbell', 'stability', 'ball.This', 'workout', 'broken', 'up', 'four', 'chapters', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'independently', 'one', 'first', 'chapter', 'just', 'classic', 'crunches', 'very', 'familiar', 'just', 'everyone', 'second', 'chapter', 'stability', 'ball', 'first', 'few', 'moves', 'chapter', 'are', ""n't"", 'exercisers', 'low', 'ceilings', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'modify', 'third', 'chapter', 'Pilates-inspired', 'ab', 'work', 'fourth', 'chapter', 'very', 'graceful', 'yoga-inspired', 'moves', 'also', 'short', 'cool-down', 'segment', 'end', 'None', 'moves', 'workout', 'are', 'mindblowingly', 'new', 'different', ""'re"", 'good', 'solid', 'well-tested', 'moves', 'packaged', 'one', 'workout.Violet', 'Zaki', 'instructor', 'workout', 'warmup', 'can', 'fast-forward', 'then', 'end', 'rather', 'long', 'section', 'discussing', 'proper', 'form', 'diet', 'how', 'contribute', 'better', 'fitness', 'diet', 'advice', 'pretty', 'common', 'sense', 'stuff', 'never', 'hear', 'one', 'more', 'time.The', 'setting', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'workout', 'filmed', 'beach', 'resort', 'Puerto', 'Vallarta', 'can', 'hear', 'waves', 'crashing', 'beach', 'background', 'very', 'calming', 'instructor', 'Violet', 'very', 'motivating', 'well', 'patter', 'whooping', 'bare', 'minimum', 'are', 'two', 'backup', 'exercisers', 'one', 'modifying', 'are', 'very', 'normal', 'looking', 'trim', 'fit', 'being', 'overly', 'lean', 'Violet', 'strong', 'only', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'found', 'give', 'DVD', 'are', 'five', 'six', 'commercials', 'beginning', 'can', 'fast', 'foward', 'hit', 'Menu', 'button', 'still', 'paid', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'paying', 'more', 'giving', 'time', 'ads', 'why', 'only', 'rated', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'ads', '5', 'star', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'chaptering.As', 'high-intermediate/low-advanced', 'exerciser', 'think', 'one', 'picking', 'up', 'add-on', 'light', 'days', 'can', 'definitely', 'feel', 'abs', 'do', 'workout', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'DOMS', 'Delayed', 'Onset', 'Muscle', 'Soreness', 'would', 'recommend', 'workout', 'just', 'level', 'exerciser', 'do', 'workout', 'eat', 'right', 'get', 'regular', 'cardiovascular', 'exercise', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'results']",Self - Firm Flat Abs Fast

I liked that there was a short warm-up before the workout.  Also, there's a short stretch after each section.  The instruction was very clear and the beach setting was great.  I was a little disappointed with the stability ball section.  I was hoping for more exercises ON the ball.  The only exercise on the ball was crunches.

890694,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0007TV63Y,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[21, 21]","Self has created a strong sexy progressive workout to take you through a variety of exercises that will quickly tone your abs. The stability ball is not essential if you adapt those exercises with an exercise ring or just skip leaning on the ball and do the exercises on the floor. A set of weights and a mat are needed to complete the exercises.Stretching is interspersed throughout the workout and it gives you a much needed rest between the more intense exercises. The exercises are taught well and then the instructor quickly raises the intensity. The addition of weights and raising the arms takes this workout to an intermediate to advanced routine.Strong graceful moves make each exercise super efficient. The variety keeps your interest and there are creative adaptations for familiar exercises. Advice is given on how to stabilize your neck and the warm-up helps you to ease into the movements.Routine:Warming UpStability BallPilates AbsYoga AbsCooldownI think they could have made this much more adaptable because they have three women working out and there are few modifications for beginners.

890695,A2D5ZYRQX2IMX5,B0007TV63Y,R. Esposito,"[10, 10]","I love ab work and I've been a fan of Violet Zaki since Crunch's ""Cardio Sculpt"" so I had high expectations for this workout. It did not disappoint me.The workout begins with a warm-up that includes standing ab work with a dumbbell. Standing work is my least favorite approach to abs, but I thoroughly enjoy this routine.The second series is stability ball with a variety of standing and floor exercises. I especially like the reverse crunches with the ball held between your legs. I can really feel it working my lower abs.Both the warm-up and the stability ball sections include some lunges. Lunges usually bother my knees, but I haven't had any trouble with these sections, maybe because they are moderately-paced or held, stationary lunges.The next series is pilates. I'm not a pilates expert but I love that the exercises here are a bit different such as leg circles with both legs. I find this version easier to do effectively and can really feel it in my abs, much more so than the usual single leg circles. I love that the bicycle twist is done slowly and held to a count of four. For an ab lover like myself this is candy... but it's also a more effective way to do this exercise.The last series of exercises is yoga-based. It includes plank and side plank work, an interesting combo of boat with toe taps, and some cobra and locust inspired back work. There's one delicious side stretch with your legs tucked to one side where you raise one arm and slowly bring it down and thread it through your supporting arm that I just love. It's simple, feel-good elements like this that, for me, make the workout fly by.I used to skip the cool down but have since realized that it's so short there's no reason to not do it. It's just a few minutes of simple twists and stretches.The workout is filmed on a beach with two background exercisers. One shows modifications. From warm-up through cool down is about 27 minutes with the chapters running about 6 minutes each (the cool down is shorter). There's also a bonus cardio segment but I've never done it so I can't comment on it. The chaptering allows you to do one or more sections but I've found that once I get started I don't want to stop. It's a good 25 minutes of lower intensity, non-traditional ab work. If you're the type of exerciser who likes the fast-paced crunches you get with a Cathe or Firm workout then this DVD may not be for you. But if you're looking for a fun and effective way to work your abs I can't think of anything better.Perhaps I have a thing for Aussie accents (I'm a big Keli Roberts fan too) but I just love Violet Zaki. She looks fit and beautiful in a healthy, natural way. And she has a calm energy that is encouraging without being distracting. There's only one point in the workout where her cuing falters, at least that I've noticed, when she simply says ""again"" and doesn't add ""on the other side."" Once you know the routine, it's no big deal. I wish she'd put out more workouts.",5,Love it!,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2968,"['love', 'ab', 'work', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'workout', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'me.The', 'workout', 'warm-up', 'standing', 'ab', 'work', 'dumbbell', 'Standing', 'work', 'least', 'favorite', 'approach', 'abs', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'routine.The', 'second', 'series', 'stability', 'ball', 'variety', 'standing', 'floor', 'exercises', 'especially', 'reverse', 'crunches', 'ball', 'held', 'legs', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'working', 'lower', 'warm-up', 'stability', 'ball', 'sections', 'include', 'lunges', 'Lunges', 'usually', 'bother', 'knees', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'trouble', 'sections', 'maybe', 'are', 'moderately-paced', 'held', 'stationary', 'lunges.The', 'next', 'series', 'pilates', ""'m"", 'not', 'pilates', 'expert', 'love', 'exercises', 'here', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'such', 'leg', 'circles', 'legs', 'find', 'version', 'easier', 'do', 'effectively', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'abs', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'usual', 'single', 'leg', 'circles', 'love', 'bicycle', 'twist', 'done', 'slowly', 'held', 'count', 'four', 'ab', 'lover', 'candy', 'also', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'do', 'exercise.The', 'last', 'series', 'exercises', 'yoga-based', 'plank', 'side', 'plank', 'work', 'interesting', 'combo', 'boat', 'toe', 'taps', 'cobra', 'locust', 'inspired', 'back', 'work', 'one', 'delicious', 'side', 'stretch', 'legs', 'tucked', 'one', 'side', 'where', 'raise', 'one', 'arm', 'slowly', 'bring', 'down', 'thread', 'supporting', 'arm', 'just', 'love', 'simple', 'feel-good', 'elements', 'make', 'workout', 'fly', 'by.I', 'used', 'skip', 'cool', 'down', 'have', 'realized', 'so', 'short', 'reason', 'not', 'do', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'simple', 'twists', 'stretches.The', 'workout', 'filmed', 'beach', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'One', 'modifications', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', '27', 'minutes', 'chapters', 'running', 'about', '6', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'shorter', 'also', 'bonus', 'cardio', 'segment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'chaptering', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'sections', ""'ve"", 'found', 'once', 'get', 'started', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'good', '25', 'minutes', 'lower', 'intensity', 'non-traditional', 'ab', 'work', ""'re"", 'type', 'exerciser', 'who', 'fast-paced', 'crunches', 'get', 'Cathe', 'Firm', 'then', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'effective', 'way', 'work', 'abs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'better.Perhaps', 'have', 'thing', 'Aussie', 'accents', ""'m"", 'big', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'fan', 'too', 'just', 'love', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'fit', 'beautiful', 'healthy', 'natural', 'way', 'calm', 'energy', 'encouraging', 'being', 'distracting', 'only', 'one', 'point', 'workout', 'where', 'cuing', 'falters', 'least', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'when', 'simply', 'again', ""n't"", 'add', 'other', 'side', 'know', 'routine', 'big', 'deal', 'wish', ""'d"", 'put', 'out', 'more', 'workouts']",Self - Firm Flat Abs Fast
890696,ADLN37B0153N,B0007TV63Y,Silmarwen,"[1, 1]","This DVD workout is app. 28 minutes long including warm-up, 4 toning sections & cool-down.  There is an introduction at the beginning as well as a fairly lengthy postlude about diet and other tips for a healthy lifestyle.  There is also a short (app. 5 minute) cardio workout that you can select from the main menu.  If you put all of these together, you come up with the 45 minute length on the video.The warm-up is very short, but adequate and then you move directly into standing crunch moves with 1 dumbbell.  Section 2 is with a stability ball, section 3 is pilates-inspired exercises and section 4 is yoga-inspired.  Each section is about 6 minutes long so there are not a lot of different exercises or repetitions, but I felt that the workout was still a good one.  I feel that, regardless of your level of fitness, you can get something out of this workout.  For beginners, one of the instructors does modifications, for an advanced workout, you can follow Violet, the lead instructor as she always does moves deeper, longer and more completely than the others.The instructor was upbeat and encouraging without being obnoxious and had a great body.  The scenery was beautiful and the music was adequate.  I liked this workout because I did not really feel a huge strain while I was doing the workout, but I did feel a bit of soreness afterwards.  I also liked that there were few actual crunches in the workout and that the workout ended with the yoga section so that you get a nice cool down with stretching at the end.My main complaint with the DVD is that I hate fast-forwarding through commercials and introductions on workout DVDs.  Thank goodness this wasn't a video!  The only other thing that I didn't like about this DVD is that most of the exercises focused on the obliques without doing much with my upper or lower abs so I feel that I need to do another DVD in tandem with this one to get a full abs workout.  Also, I feel that that ""fast"" claim in the title is a bit of a misnomer as the instructor tells you that ""if you do this workout 3 or more times a week, you can see results in as little as 4 weeks.""  I understand that getting safe results takes time, but I wouldn't necessarily call 4 weeks fast!  That said, I still recommend this DVD as it is quick, feels easy, contains simple poses & moves and the instructor is clear and easy to follow.",4,Great Ab Workout for Your Obliques,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,2371,"['DVD', 'workout', 'app', '28', 'minutes', 'long', 'including', 'warm-up', '4', 'toning', 'sections', 'cool-down', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'as', 'well', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'postlude', 'diet', 'other', 'tips', 'healthy', 'lifestyle', 'also', 'short', 'app', '5', 'minute', 'cardio', 'workout', 'can', 'select', 'main', 'menu', 'put', 'together', 'come', 'up', '45', 'minute', 'length', 'video.The', 'warm-up', 'very', 'short', 'adequate', 'then', 'move', 'directly', 'standing', 'crunch', 'moves', '1', 'dumbbell', 'Section', '2', 'stability', 'ball', 'section', '3', 'pilates-inspired', 'exercises', 'section', '4', 'yoga-inspired', 'section', '6', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'different', 'exercises', 'repetitions', 'felt', 'workout', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'feel', 'regardless', 'level', 'fitness', 'can', 'get', 'something', 'workout', 'beginners', 'one', 'instructors', 'modifications', 'advanced', 'workout', 'can', 'follow', 'Violet', 'lead', 'instructor', 'always', 'moves', 'deeper', 'longer', 'more', 'completely', 'others.The', 'instructor', 'was', 'upbeat', 'encouraging', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'had', 'great', 'body', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful', 'music', 'was', 'adequate', 'liked', 'workout', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'feel', 'huge', 'strain', 'was', 'doing', 'workout', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'soreness', 'afterwards', 'also', 'liked', 'were', 'few', 'actual', 'crunches', 'workout', 'workout', 'ended', 'yoga', 'section', 'get', 'nice', 'cool', 'down', 'stretching', 'end.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'hate', 'fast-forwarding', 'commercials', 'introductions', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'was', ""n't"", 'video', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'most', 'exercises', 'focused', 'obliques', 'doing', 'much', 'upper', 'lower', 'abs', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'DVD', 'tandem', 'one', 'get', 'full', 'abs', 'workout', 'Also', 'feel', 'fast', 'claim', 'title', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'instructor', 'do', 'workout', '3', 'more', 'times', 'week', 'can', 'see', 'results', 'as', 'little', '4', 'weeks', 'understand', 'getting', 'safe', 'results', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'call', '4', 'weeks', 'fast', 'said', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'quick', 'feels', 'easy', 'simple', 'poses', 'moves', 'instructor', 'clear', 'easy', 'follow']",Self - Firm Flat Abs Fast
