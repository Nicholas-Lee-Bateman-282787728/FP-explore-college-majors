I remember it was a sweet and sometimes sad story that I liked very much, but the details had grown vague with all the years. Recently, I heard about a film remake of the same name (and I presume, story), on cable. I haven't watched it and I probably won't. Remakes are almost always inferior to the originals and often disappoint.Seeing this copy here at Amazon, I bought it on a nostalgic whim. Something to add to my collection of old-time favorites. I'm glad I did, as it's even better than I had remembered. I think that this is one of those films that should be in every house with a kid under the roof.

216078,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6300214974,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[12, 16]","This movie would be just another run-of-the-mill movie about an orphan boy and a dog with some serious overacting on the part of Theodore Bikel, among others, but there are parts of this movie that make it worth watching.Nello, played by David Ladd, the future husband of Cheryl Ladd, lives with his grandfather after his mother passed away.  Nello loves art and paintings and longs to be a painter.  He frequently sneaks into the local cathedral to avoid paying a franc to see original paintings by Peter Paul Rubens.  However, Nello's grandfather is poor and the pair can barely afford to eat, much less purchase paints for Nello.  However, in spite of the little they have the two are happy.Life changes for Nello when he and his grandfather come upon a dog left to die.  Nello wants to adopt the dog and help it, and his grandfather reluctantly agrees.  The principal difficulty is that there is barely enough food for Nello and his grandfather, and the dog is just that much more burden.  Things continue to degrade for Nello as the miller refuses to allow his daughter to play with Nello after catching Nello drawing her picture.  Then the man who abandoned the dog tries twice to take it back, planning to abuse the dog again.  The second time the man attempts to take the dog back the miller gets involved and the man meets an unfortunate end.  It seems as though life continues to go down hill for Nello.There is one bright spot in Nello's life.  He has made a kind of friend of a painter in Antwerp who, after yelling and complaining to Nello, has started to help Nello realize his ambition of becoming a painter.  Ultimately the painter helps Nello enter a local painting competition by providing Nello with paper and paints.  Nello's grandfather sold some things and allowed Nello to buy a brush before he died.  Nello's one great hope is that he will win the painting contest, which will allow him to continue to live in his rented hovel.While you can see where Nello has hope that all will turn out well, there are too many factors working against Nello, and eventually he gives his dog to the Miller's daughter and leaves.  In the meantime, the painter has found the painting that Nello has entered in the contest and wants to talk to him about it, but then he finds that Nello has disappeared.  Where did Nello go?  What will happen to his dog?  Did I mention that Nello wonders why the painter has yet to marry his model, who is obviously in love with him?  I leave these questions for you to answer if you can find a copy of this movie.Difficult to see from the quality of the movie, but the paintings by Peter Paul Rubens are truly wondrous and appear to be authentic.  Even with the weak video I will still impressed by these magnificent paintings.  The cathedral in which they were housed, which the end credits states is genuine, is gorgeous, a fitting home for the art within.The quality of this movie may leave a bit to be desired, as the performances vary from wooden to hammy, but the scenery in 1959 Belgium and Holland, especially the cathedral interiors, is beautiful, and the story should appeal to mature children ages 7 and above who can handle the occasional violence.  David Ladd is wonderful as the center of the attention and his perfect blend of enthusiasm and innocence brings to mind Little Orphan Annie.",3,A Good Film for Families with Mature Children,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,3343,"['movie', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'movie', 'orphan', 'boy', 'dog', 'serious', 'overacting', 'part', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'others', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'make', 'worth', 'watching.Nello', 'played', 'David', 'Ladd', 'future', 'husband', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'grandfather', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'Nello', 'art', 'paintings', 'longs', 'be', 'painter', 'frequently', 'local', 'cathedral', 'avoid', 'paying', 'franc', 'see', 'original', 'paintings', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'However', 'Nello', 'grandfather', 'poor', 'pair', 'can', 'barely', 'afford', 'eat', 'much', 'less', 'purchase', 'paints', 'Nello', 'However', 'spite', 'little', 'have', 'two', 'are', 'happy.Life', 'changes', 'Nello', 'when', 'grandfather', 'come', 'dog', 'left', 'die', 'Nello', 'adopt', 'dog', 'help', 'grandfather', 'reluctantly', 'principal', 'difficulty', 'barely', 'enough', 'food', 'Nello', 'grandfather', 'dog', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'burden', 'Things', 'continue', 'degrade', 'Nello', 'miller', 'allow', 'daughter', 'play', 'Nello', 'catching', 'Nello', 'drawing', 'picture', 'Then', 'man', 'who', 'abandoned', 'dog', 'twice', 'take', 'back', 'planning', 'abuse', 'dog', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'man', 'take', 'dog', 'back', 'miller', 'involved', 'man', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'life', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'Nello.There', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'Nello', 'life', 'made', 'kind', 'friend', 'painter', 'Antwerp', 'who', 'yelling', 'complaining', 'Nello', 'started', 'help', 'Nello', 'realize', 'ambition', 'becoming', 'painter', 'Ultimately', 'painter', 'Nello', 'enter', 'local', 'painting', 'competition', 'providing', 'Nello', 'paper', 'paints', 'Nello', 'grandfather', 'sold', 'things', 'allowed', 'Nello', 'buy', 'brush', 'died', 'Nello', 'one', 'great', 'hope', 'will', 'win', 'painting', 'contest', 'will', 'allow', 'continue', 'live', 'rented', 'hovel.While', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Nello', 'hope', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'factors', 'working', 'Nello', 'eventually', 'dog', 'Miller', 'daughter', 'leaves', 'meantime', 'painter', 'found', 'painting', 'Nello', 'entered', 'contest', 'talk', 'then', 'Nello', 'disappeared', 'Where', 'did', 'Nello', 'go', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'dog', 'Did', 'mention', 'Nello', 'wonders', 'why', 'painter', 'yet', 'marry', 'model', 'who', 'obviously', 'love', 'leave', 'questions', 'answer', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'movie.Difficult', 'see', 'quality', 'movie', 'paintings', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'are', 'truly', 'wondrous', 'appear', 'be', 'authentic', 'Even', 'weak', 'video', 'will', 'still', 'impressed', 'magnificent', 'paintings', 'cathedral', 'were', 'housed', 'end', 'states', 'genuine', 'gorgeous', 'fitting', 'home', 'art', 'within.The', 'quality', 'movie', 'may', 'leave', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'performances', 'vary', 'wooden', 'hammy', 'scenery', '1959', 'Belgium', 'Holland', 'especially', 'cathedral', 'interiors', 'beautiful', 'story', 'should', 'appeal', 'mature', 'children', '7', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'occasional', 'violence', 'David', 'Ladd', 'wonderful', 'center', 'attention', 'perfect', 'blend', 'enthusiasm', 'innocence', 'brings', 'mind', 'Little', 'Orphan', 'Annie']",Dog of Flanders VHS

216080,A2L1IQXXDUNT2,6300214974,"Mr. David Rayner ""David Rayner""","[7, 8]","I went to see A Dog of Flanders in 1961, when I was fourteen, and it became one of my all time favourite films. This is a superb tear-jerker, filmed on location in Holland and Belgium in 1959, but set in 1900. It stars the then twelve-year-old David Ladd as the orphan Nello and veteran actor Donald Crisp as his elderly and infirm grandfather. Although devoted to one another, they live a very poor life selling milk from a hand cart they pull around Antwerp. Nello is an artistic, intelligent and sensitive little boy who wants to paint like his idol, Peter Paul Rubens, but he has no money to enable him to study or to buy proper materials to paint with. They find a badly treated dog, left to die at the roadside by his heartless owner and take him home and care for him. Because he's been so badly treated, it takes time for him to accept them as his friends. But eventually, they gain his trust. Nello names him Patrasche...the name that Rubens had given to his dog...and he becomes part of the small family, even pulling the cart when grandfather is unable to do so any more. One day, Nello has just finished a sketch of the old man dozing in a chair outside their one-roomed hut and goes to show him the finished drawing. But he cannot awaken him and slowly, he comes to realise that his beloved grandfather is dead. Completely bereft and unable to keep up the rent on their home, Nello and Patrasche are evicted by an uncaring landlord in the middle of winter and just before Christmas. Somehow, they have to learn how to survive without his grandfather in a harsh and bitter world.A Dog of Flanders, from the 1872 novel by Ouida, had been filmed previously, notably in 1934, but never so well as this. Even though the very tragic ending of the novel is changed to a happy ending here, it really is beautifully done all round and everyone connected with it should feel very proud of the result. The picturesque landscapes of Flanders are superbly captured on film in CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe by Otto Heller and the music score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter is very haunting. David Ladd, who had previously given such a truly wonderful performance alongside his father Alan in The Proud Rebel (1958), is superb. David and I shared the same Christian name, were both the same age and had similar looks, which made it easy for me to identify with him in A Dog of Flanders. Theodore Bikel has a good character role in it as an artist who befriends Nello, eventually adopts him and helps him to realise his dreams.This is a wonderful film and you really would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it. I give it ten out of ten. This E1 Entertainment re-mastered and restored 2009 DVD release of this classic 1959 film is a joy to behold. Having had to put up for years with the truncated pan and scan video and DVD of this film, the new DVD restores it to its original 2.35:1 CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe glory, complete with the original ""Twentieth Century-Fox presents a CinemaScope picture"" opening trade mark, previously removed from the Paramount and other DVD companies pan and scan videos and DVD's. It seems that 20th Century-Fox have somehow lost the rights to their own film here, but don't be put off by the fact that this new DVD release isn't released by Fox. The quality is as good as anything released in their own Studio Classics series. The DVD is also anamorphically enhanced for 16 x 9 monitors and televisions. Highly recommended, even though the sound on the DVD is in mono and not in the original stereo of the film as first released.",5,Released on DVD in its original widescreen CinemaScope at long last!,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,3586,"['went', 'see', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', '1961', 'when', 'was', 'fourteen', 'became', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'films', 'superb', 'tear-jerker', 'filmed', 'location', 'Holland', 'Belgium', '1959', 'set', '1900', 'then', 'twelve-year-old', 'David', 'Ladd', 'orphan', 'Nello', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'elderly', 'infirm', 'grandfather', 'devoted', 'one', 'live', 'very', 'poor', 'life', 'selling', 'milk', 'hand', 'cart', 'pull', 'Antwerp', 'Nello', 'artistic', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'paint', 'idol', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'money', 'enable', 'study', 'buy', 'proper', 'materials', 'paint', 'find', 'badly', 'treated', 'dog', 'left', 'die', 'roadside', 'heartless', 'owner', 'take', 'home', 'care', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'treated', 'time', 'accept', 'friends', 'eventually', 'gain', 'trust', 'Nello', 'Patrasche', 'name', 'Rubens', 'had', 'given', 'dog', 'part', 'small', 'family', 'even', 'pulling', 'cart', 'when', 'grandfather', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'One', 'day', 'Nello', 'just', 'finished', 'sketch', 'old', 'man', 'dozing', 'chair', 'one-roomed', 'hut', 'show', 'finished', 'drawing', 'can', 'not', 'awaken', 'slowly', 'realise', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'dead', 'Completely', 'bereft', 'unable', 'keep', 'up', 'rent', 'home', 'Nello', 'Patrasche', 'are', 'evicted', 'uncaring', 'landlord', 'middle', 'winter', 'just', 'before', 'Christmas', 'Somehow', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'grandfather', 'harsh', 'bitter', 'world.A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', '1872', 'novel', 'Ouida', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'previously', 'notably', '1934', 'never', 'so', 'well', 'Even', 'very', 'tragic', 'ending', 'novel', 'changed', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'really', 'beautifully', 'done', 'round', 'everyone', 'connected', 'should', 'feel', 'very', 'proud', 'result', 'picturesque', 'landscapes', 'Flanders', 'are', 'superbly', 'captured', 'film', 'CinemaScope', 'Color', 'De', 'Luxe', 'Otto', 'Heller', 'music', 'score', 'Paul', 'Sawtell', 'Bert', 'Shefter', 'very', 'haunting', 'David', 'Ladd', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'given', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'father', 'Alan', 'Proud', 'Rebel', '1958', 'superb', 'David', 'shared', 'same', 'Christian', 'name', 'were', 'same', 'age', 'had', 'similar', 'looks', 'made', 'easy', 'identify', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'good', 'character', 'role', 'artist', 'who', 'Nello', 'eventually', 'realise', 'dreams.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'heart', 'stone', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'give', 'ten', 'E1', 'Entertainment', 're-mastered', 'restored', '2009', 'DVD', 'release', 'classic', '1959', 'film', 'joy', 'behold', 'Having', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'years', 'truncated', 'pan', 'scan', 'video', 'DVD', 'film', 'new', 'DVD', 'original', '2.35:1', 'CinemaScope', 'Color', 'De', 'Luxe', 'glory', 'complete', 'original', 'Twentieth', 'Century-Fox', 'CinemaScope', 'picture', 'opening', 'trade', 'mark', 'previously', 'removed', 'Paramount', 'other', 'DVD', 'companies', 'pan', 'scan', 'videos', 'DVD', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'have', 'somehow', 'lost', 'rights', 'own', 'film', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', ""n't"", 'released', 'Fox', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'released', 'own', 'Studio', 'Classics', 'series', 'DVD', 'also', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', '16', 'x', '9', 'monitors', 'televisions', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'even', 'sound', 'DVD', 'mono', 'not', 'original', 'stereo', 'film', 'first', 'released']",Dog of Flanders VHS

Tate,"[2, 2]","""A Dog of Flanders""  is family entertainment at its very best and will delight all ages.Made in 1959, it showcases the rare talent of the three leading players - David Ladd isNello, a young Dutch boy who's ambition is to become an artist, Donald Crisp is hiswise grandfather who is dedicated to raising the boy and Theodore Bikel in perhaps hisfinest role is an artist of considerable talent who befriends Nello and inspires himto pursue his dream. Donald Crisp and Theodore Bikel have good character roles.Based on a story by Ouida and beautifully filmed on location in Belgium and theNetherlands, it tells the story of Nello and his grandfather who live in abjectpoverty in a small rented house on the great Flanders Plain and who barely existon the money they earn transporting milk for sale in their dog drawn cart toAntwerp.Their dog is an animal that they found by the roadside and which had been cruellybeaten and ditched by its previous owner.  Nello nurses the dog back to healthand they become good friends.Life is a daily struggle which only gets worse when Nello's grandfather dies and he istossed out of the house by his cruel landlord when he can no longer pay the rent.Only his passion to become an artist and his close association with his artist friendsave him from disaster. The story is told in a straightforward and winning manner.The movie has been digitally restored and re-mastered to a pristine condition, infact I believe that it looks and sounds better now than it did on its initialtheatrical release.Highly recommended.",5,A Dog of Flanders,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1547,"['Dog', 'Flanders', 'family', 'entertainment', 'very', 'best', 'will', 'delight', 'ages.Made', '1959', 'rare', 'talent', 'three', 'leading', 'players', 'David', 'Ladd', 'isNello', 'young', 'Dutch', 'boy', 'who', 'ambition', 'become', 'artist', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'hiswise', 'grandfather', 'who', 'dedicated', 'raising', 'boy', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'perhaps', 'hisfinest', 'role', 'artist', 'considerable', 'talent', 'who', 'Nello', 'inspires', 'himto', 'pursue', 'dream', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'have', 'good', 'character', 'roles.Based', 'story', 'Ouida', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'location', 'Belgium', 'theNetherlands', 'story', 'Nello', 'grandfather', 'who', 'live', 'abjectpoverty', 'small', 'rented', 'house', 'great', 'Flanders', 'Plain', 'who', 'barely', 'existon', 'money', 'earn', 'transporting', 'milk', 'sale', 'dog', 'drawn', 'cart', 'toAntwerp.Their', 'dog', 'animal', 'found', 'roadside', 'had', 'been', 'cruellybeaten', 'ditched', 'previous', 'owner', 'Nello', 'dog', 'back', 'healthand', 'become', 'good', 'friends.Life', 'daily', 'struggle', 'only', 'worse', 'when', 'Nello', 'grandfather', 'dies', 'istossed', 'house', 'cruel', 'landlord', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pay', 'rent.Only', 'passion', 'become', 'artist', 'close', 'association', 'artist', 'friendsave', 'disaster', 'story', 'told', 'straightforward', 'winning', 'manner.The', 'movie', 'been', 'digitally', 'restored', 're-mastered', 'pristine', 'condition', 'infact', 'believe', 'better', 'now', 'did', 'initialtheatrical', 'release.Highly', 'recommended']",Dog of Flanders VHS

A couple of sad/scary moments, nicely smoothed over by the sudden appearance of a parent/adult to explain things.A pleasant, if bland depiction of Flanders in 1900. Worth watching to see scenes of Antwerp in 1959 where it was filmed.Out of print I believe, but I found it in a bargain bin at ""X""mart.",3,Nice Disney syle fare,1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,449,"['remember', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'child', 'boy', 'meets', 'dog', 'grandfather', 'new', 'family', 'formula', 'film', 'couple', 'sad/scary', 'moments', 'nicely', 'smoothed', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'parent/adult', 'explain', 'things.A', 'pleasant', 'bland', 'depiction', 'Flanders', '1900', 'Worth', 'watching', 'see', 'scenes', 'Antwerp', '1959', 'where', 'was', 'filmed.Out', 'print', 'believe', 'found', 'bargain', 'bin', 'X', 'mart']",Dog of Flanders VHS
216084,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6300214974,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","It is a well-told story of Nello, a poor boy aspiring to be an artist, and Patrasche, a faithful dog who becomes a friend to him. Based on Ouida's 1872 novella, ""A Dog of Flanders"" is heart-warming family picture, in which good people (and a dog) get what they deserve and bad people get their due. It is also about a friendship between a poor boy and an ill-used dog, which is appealing to us even now.As is often the case with film adaptations, the original story is considerably changed. The people of the village (near the 19th century Antwerp) are more compassionate to the lonely boy and his grandfather than those counterparts in Ouida's book. The changed conclusion (seen again in the 1999 adaptation, which is slightly more faithful to the original) will be satisfying to most viewers, but still the new ending could have been developed into something more emotional.The cast (including the dog) is unanimously good and among them Theodore Bikel is memorable as an artist who befriends Nello. The character and his subplot are added in adapting the original, but you may find the love story of this slightly eccentric painter a bit detracting because the film is, and should be, about the boy and the dog after all.For me the real star of the film is its location. The wonderful landscapes of Netherland and Belgium give the film credibility and so do Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp and its interior with its solemn beauty. Maybe slightly dated, but ""A Dog of Flanders"" is a nice picture you can enjoy with your family.",4,(3.5 STARS) Nello and Patrasche: Nice Family Picture,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,1530,"['well-told', 'story', 'Nello', 'poor', 'boy', 'aspiring', 'be', 'artist', 'Patrasche', 'faithful', 'dog', 'who', 'friend', 'Based', 'Ouida', '1872', 'novella', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'heart-warming', 'family', 'picture', 'good', 'people', 'dog', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'bad', 'people', 'get', 'due', 'also', 'friendship', 'poor', 'boy', 'ill-used', 'dog', 'appealing', 'even', 'now.As', 'often', 'case', 'film', 'adaptations', 'original', 'story', 'considerably', 'changed', 'people', 'village', '19th', 'century', 'Antwerp', 'are', 'more', 'compassionate', 'lonely', 'boy', 'grandfather', 'counterparts', 'Ouida', 'book', 'changed', 'conclusion', 'seen', 'again', '1999', 'adaptation', 'slightly', 'more', 'faithful', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'satisfying', 'most', 'viewers', 'still', 'new', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'something', 'more', 'emotional.The', 'cast', 'including', 'dog', 'unanimously', 'good', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'memorable', 'artist', 'who', 'Nello', 'character', 'subplot', 'are', 'added', 'adapting', 'original', 'may', 'find', 'love', 'story', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'painter', 'bit', 'detracting', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'boy', 'dog', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'location', 'wonderful', 'landscapes', 'Netherland', 'Belgium', 'give', 'film', 'credibility', 'so', 'do', 'Cathedral', 'Lady', 'Antwerp', 'interior', 'solemn', 'beauty', 'Maybe', 'slightly', 'dated', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'nice', 'picture', 'can', 'enjoy', 'family']",Dog of Flanders VHS
