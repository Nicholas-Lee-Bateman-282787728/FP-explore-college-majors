1645986,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CDAG0WW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","After five supernatural seasons, the British hit ""Being Human"" concludes its run in dramatic fashion.  It doesn't seem that long ago that we were introduced to a trio of best friends kicking it with Mitchell (Aiden Turner), George (Russell Tovey), and Annie (Lenora Crichlow).  Having said our tearful goodbyes to all of the principles over the past few season (Crichlow was the last to part at the end of Season Four), the final season appears decidedly different in every regard except one.  The fundamental premise of having a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost chasing normalcy and acceptance in the modern world is still a terrifically engaging idea.  Through the years, the show has had lightness and humor as well as brutality and tragedy.  In fact, that's perhaps its most successful accomplishment.  The program could be terribly silly and fun at times, but gut wrenching and disturbing at others.  This blend of moods is hard to achieve effectively, but ""Being Human"" has succeeded as a comedy, a drama, and a thriller.  But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.The current trio of housemates are now werewolf Tom (Michael Socha), vampire Hal (Damien Molony), and ghost Alex (Kate Bracken).  I've been a big fan of Socha since he first appeared as a guest star.  I was thrilled when he was promoted to series regular in Season Three although filling Tovey's shoes was nearly impossible.  The key was that he didn't even try, he just did something completely different.  It's funny to now see him as the veteran in the cast!  Both Molony and Bracken made their initial appearances in Season Four.  Molony has a quirky presence that can be either funny or scary and Bracken provides the sass.  The roommates face some changes from the end of last season.  Tom and Hal no longer work in the restaurant industry, they take up employment in the sinister Barry Grand Hotel.  The dangers faced in these final six episodes include a new vampire foe with a tentative grasp on reality, a government official (Steven Robertson) charged with making the supernatural obsolete, and a hotel inhabitant (Philip Davis) with evil on his mind.  The stakes are really raised for the finale, seemingly the fate of the entire world will rest on the shoulders of our heroes.  But might the dangers be too daunting?  This time, there may be no escape or salvation.The DVD release has all 6 episodes over two discs.  The Bonus Features Include:1) Deleted Scenes2) Cast and Crew Interviews3) Exclusive Scene: Our Three Heroes Enjoy Being Human4) Extra Scene: Taking Care5) Five Bonus Clips: Alex's Unfinished BusinessI liked that ""Being Human"" decided to go out in a memorable fashion.  As a funny in-joke, creator Toby Whithouse even makes an appearance as Home Secretary Alistair Firth.  Season Five certainly isn't my favorite year of the series (that would be Season Two, especially the George and Nina storyline) but it is a fitful and exciting conclusion.  If you've watched the other years, you'll definitely want to see how Whithouse wraps things up.

Hal has been doing fine for decades, with his method, so he just wants to stay the way he is.  Tom, as a werewolf, only has a problem once a month, which is the reason why no werewolf shows (TV or movie) are quite as compelling as vampire show which deal with constant hunger - and he doesn't have a conflict here because, well, he has nothing to be conflicted over.  He is content as a character, which makes him very boring.  And the ghost - unlike Annie, she has no delusion about her demise, so there is no personal story to explore there.So, with the characters having no compelling issues of their own, the focus shifts to Devil and government bureaucrats. Which makes a very good entertainment, but it is not up to the standard set by the first three seasons.All in all, I did enjoy Season 5, but it came off as a disappointment after the wait of a year.
