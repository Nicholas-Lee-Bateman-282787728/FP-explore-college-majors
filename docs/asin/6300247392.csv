226559,A2S244KFX0745K,6300247392,Alan Edward Creager,"[4, 4]","Harold Becker's 1981 film ""Taps"" is a movie that at times sacrifices realism for the sake of making things more dramatic. Such details as the featured military school having working M-60 machine guns and 81mm mortars aren't very likely to be seen at military schools today. But that's not the point with ""Taps"". It's a bold, dramatic movie whose trades of realism for drama are worthwhile, and it is well-made and complete to a point where it's more than lamentable that so few people have seen it.The film opens with a chapel ceremony at the 150-year-old Bunker Hill Military Academy, a prestigious school full of upright, disciplined young men and sound moral values taught to them, and for the cadets personified, by the retired Brigadier General Bache. The devotion of the cadets to their battle-scarred but caring general is absolute- we learn quickly how much of a father figure he is to the cadets, and how as soon as crisis strikes, they maintain to the end the belief that General Bache will find a way. Any shortcomings the cadets have as individuals, any disagreements they have with each other, fall short of their respect for him. But things become very different when the crisis deepens and Bache, age having caught up with him at last, is no longer able to help. What happens then is very much like what occurs in ""Lord of the Flies""- a split between the fighters and the civilized ones occurs, and in the end nobody really wins.The crisis is the sudden closing of Bunker Hill. Faced with this and with General Bache out of the picture, the cadets rebel against all the authorities they have been so carefully taught to obey, and in doing this their idealistic effort is ultimately doomed from the start. Initially things go well, moral is high, and the corps' rebellion against lawful authority seems likely to work. But it doesn't take long for the National Guard to show up and prove just from their presence how nervous and unhappy the cadets' actions have made some people. Their leader, the sympathetic but iron-willed Colonel Kerby, points out the far from noble reputation the cadets' actions have gained them in the outside world. His negotiations with the leader of Bunker Hill's defenders, the charismatic and determined, but inwardly troubled, Cadet Major Brian Moreland tell a lot about what each of them is fighting for. Brought together by the worst of circumstances, both attempt to find a way out of a situation each is unwilling to back out of and neither truly controls.As they struggle to find support outside the armed camp that used to be their school, Bunker Hill's cadets engage in another struggle, with a new and much more challenging enemy- each other. Food runs short, the power is turned off, tanks arrive to square off with boys and their M16s and M60s. Moreland's father visits and points out some very unpleasant things about General Bache, viciously attacking the hero-worship of him the boys stubbornly cling to. His harsh words also raise the question, in our minds and in the cadets'- who is Harlan Bache, really? Is the the perfect, noble man they have always pictured him to be? Playing Master Sergeant Kevin Moreland, Wayne Tippit gives a beautiful secondary performance, his ruthless pragmatism the perfect counterpart to the naive idealism of the cadets and his son. Among the cadets, a split gradually occurs, with a figurehead on each side. D Troop commander Alex Dwyer wants to find a way out, even if it means surrender, while B Company commander David Shawn hungers for the fight he knows is coming, and does little but attempt to provoke it. With these two at his side, Moreland attempts to maintain control and compromise between the two viewpoints. Well-intentioned as his efforts are, they only distance him from Dwyer and Shawn more. There is no room for compromise between either of them, it seems, which makes Moreland's position the very worst place to be.Finally the time for negotiating is past. The governor of the unnamed state- techinally Pennsylvania, the site of ""Taps""'s filming being Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, PA- sends word down through Colonel Kerby: surrender at dawn, or else. His resolve considerably weakened by the accidental but hardly unpredictable death of one of his youngest cadets, Moreland tearfully wonders why everything has gone wrong in spite of his strict adherance to the school's glorious ideals. He goes on to ask if there was something Bache forgot to teach them, something that, had it been known, would have prevented the tragedy unfolding before him. That something is by now easy enough to guess: the battlefield is no place for blind adherence to glory, honor, and lofty ideals. Surviving in battle requires wisdom, and blind idealism is a fast path to martyrdom, as Captain Shawn learns the hard way. Moreland is brave to the end, accepting full responsibility: ""It was my command and I was in charge"" and his final act is nothing if not noble, trying to save someone- Shawn- who by then cannot be saved. The final shots- a smoke-filled quad with soldiers, tanks, and the surviving cadets walking out disarmed, Dwyer electing to carry out the body of his fallen friend- are contrasted with a sudden return to the glory days of Bunker Hill's past, with all the pomp and glory and Sousa marches blaring in the background. This film contains some of director Harold Becker's finest work- he couldn't have worked the ending scenes better.George C. Scott, Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Ronny Cox and Tom Cruise all give outstanding performances in his film. Even actors, teenager and adult, who have only a line and a scene or two among them are clearly doing their best. Better still, and this if nothing else brings an aura of greatness to ""Taps"", is the fact that Maurice Jarre of ""Doctor Zhivago"" fame created the movie's soundtrack. Hargrave Military Academy and the Kemper Military School were among those considered for filming, and having attended Hargrave it piqued my curiosity to think of the drama and tragedy of ""Taps"" playing out before the steps of Camden Hall. But ultimately it couldn't, shouldn't, have been anyplace but Valley Forge. The biggest, most expensive, and most over-the-top in its use of big bands, polished rifles and brilliantly flashy uniforms, Valley Forge in many ways aspires to and embodies the idealistic glory that ""Taps"" is so centered around.My most lasting impression from ""Taps"" is not just how, as a cadet of multiple military schools myself, it summed up the highest ideals of the schools themselves and the conceptions of honor that their most loyal cadets held- it was of the scene wherein Brian Moreland says to his cadets, ""Anyone who's not 100% sure of what we're doing, or why we're doing it- take one step forward."" There are those who never take that step forward, and we see firsthand how sure they are of themselves and their code of honor. But the price of those things can be heavy. And reaching out for glory doesn't mean staying alive.",5,Honor and glory have many prices- none of them light.,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,7007,"['Harold', 'Becker', '1981', 'film', 'Taps',

226562,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300247392,Austin Somlo,"[0, 7]","Viewed: 2/12Rate: 42/12: Stupid, misguided, infantile, and brainwashed are the words that immediately come to my mind when viewing Taps. One side of the coin is an interesting perspective of what a cult must look like. On the other side of the coin, Taps is an awesomely bad film with cheesy results. I wouldn't be surprised if Tom Cruise disowned the film because that role of his was probably the worst of his career. He just looked like a jackass every second of the film. Oh yes...for the 56th film I've seen Sean Penn in, he cries. That's why I can't take him seriously as an actor. It's safe to say the film should be read...Taps: Timothy Hutton's acting career, 1981. Ever since then, he has fallen off the map completely, and he tries his best in Taps. But his character was completely brainwashed, making it impossible to sympathize with him or even like him for the slightest bit. On the other side, the history of military schools, as I researched about after seeing Taps, is a lot more interesting to read. There used to be hundreds of them decades ago, but now, there is only a handful of them left now. Most of the reasons are: outdated (I knew that already), financially unprofitable, victims to changing attitudes (think of the protests during the Vietnam War period), impossible tuition rates, more focus on troubled youths of upper class families, and better schooling options. It makes you to realize how silly the issue in Taps was, and it is hard for me to believe that I had to watch two hours of it: the boys defending the school for nonsensical reasons. Oh yes...George C. Scott, probably the only saving grace of the film...I wonder how Moreland would feel if Bache started to slap his face around and say, ""You idiot boy!""

226572,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,6300247392,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[14, 14]","Imagine, this is the movie that discovered Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, being this both of their debut roles. And the acting in this movie shows it, as great performances are given all the way around, especially by Timothy Hutton. What might be even more amazing is that I've never heard of this movie before two weeks ago.In fact, I imagine that today's audiences couldn't sit through the first thirty minutes, as it's mostly filled with dialogue, and seemingly boring military school proceedings. But this is all very important, as it shows you the full load of dynamite just waiting to go off. Then as the movie progresses, it quickly delves into a 'Lord of the Flies' situation where there's youth in revolt. As the drama and tension rises, it soon becomes very clear that despite what you hope for, all will not end well. And when the end finally does come, it's hard to watch, even though it almost seems necessary.The movie is certainly though-provoking, taking on themes of independence, military school, indoctrination, brain washing, honor, duty, dignity, courage, and fighting for what you believe in. They're thoughts that stay with you for awhile, and they offer no real answer, but it will challenge your beliefs.Overall, an underrated and brilliant character masterpiece, with superb acting from some now famous stars, and a story that causes you to think.

Right-- a military academy! Those who have been in one, or even who have been in the  military, will have a special understanding of this film. I appreciated  &quot;Taps&quot; because it made me consider the many definitions of  'honor', and it explored how far someone will (or should) go-- to be a true  friend.Just as Brian makes Senior-Cadet, the civilian leaders decide  that Bunker Hill Military Academy must close its doors in one year.  Although there indeed seem to be few young recruits coming into the  academy, money is claimed not to be the problem so much as public attitude  that such institutions are no longer necessary. When General Bache, an  aging military veteran and head of the school, accidentally shoots and  kills one of the town's civilian red-neck youths, immediate closure is  demanded. With sincere beliefs that they are upholding the institution's  honor, the cadets seize control, send the dean and teachers out in a bus,  and prepare to defend. The only problem I had with this movie was that, in  reality, 'honorable' cadets would never place their prepubescent troops on  the forward firing lines! (This action is what eventually leads to the  collapse of the cadets' Worthy Cause.)

Taps is, without a doubt, one of the best teen angst movies ever made.  The unique twist here is that teens are (literally) fighting for increasingly anachronistic ideals:  duty, honor, and country.  Partly due to their methods &amp; partly due to their militaristic demeanor, the society outside the school gates (good symbolism here) spurns their cause.  In the time since 1981, the trend has been to tolerate, defend, and even reward, abberrant behavior.  As a result, the film gets high marks for correctly predicting that these kids are on the wrong side of history.  The casting was also extraordinary with outstanding performance all around.  Cruise's performance was especially strong--perhaps the best he's ever done.  I also find it uncanny that this film was able to cast two of today's top stars (Penn &amp; Cruise) as leads.

Penn's 'surrender with honor' and Cruise's 'death before dishonor' and Hutton's Hamlet-like indecisiveness, are the troika of what war embraces. Should we be at war, ever? Certainly not. Will we continue to be at war? Of course. And the battle within the mind is that there is no finish line of resolution. Certainly it is not decided by who euphemistically ""won.""And here is the tougher question. Of the three roles portrayed by Hutton, Cruise and Penn, who was right? Well I submit to you that as long as we are going to pursue this folly, war, they all were right. And, they all were wrong.And to add to the confusion, again picking on Hutton, Cruise and Penn, what if we don't have the Academy representing a kind of a medieval Honor Code, but we call it a church in San Antonio. Or a hotel in Ruwanda. What do you do then? It's kind of like drugs. Good drugs? Bad drugs? Who decides?And you can even take it into the future and say what if unstable nations, some sworn to destroy the Great Satan, America, arm themselves with nuclear rockets?See I don't think Cadet Shawn (Cruise) is wrong any more than I think Cadet Dwyer (Penn) is right. They are regrettably both right and wrong.I gave it 4 stars because there are other movies, Paths of Glory for example, who don't fool you with child stars. They don't give you the easy way out. Do you build a bridge because you are in a Japanese prison camp in Burma or do you build the best bridge anyone built, better than the Japanese could build themselves?

Timothy Hutton, Tom Cruise and Sean Penn all give excellent performances.  When this movie was released, nobody had heard of Tom Cruise or Sean Penn, so it's kind of fun to see them at the beginning of their careers before fame and scientology changed them.

226594,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,6300247392,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[61, 64]","An overlooked, gripping drama that is notable for its young rising stars (Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Tom Cruise) and also its prescience, as noted by another commentator here, although I think that none of the Amazon reviewers to date has hit the nail on the head with ""Taps"" and its overarching theme.The movie begins fairly conventionally, with the teenage military cadets and their venerable institution shown to the viewer to be upright, virtuous, and full of sound moral values.  The youths may be a bit immature at times, and callow, but their earnestness and sincerity are shown as admirable and their devotion to their gruff, benevolent commandant (George C. Scott,  perfectly cast) is unquestioned.  You can literally hear the Sousa marches playing in the background.  But just when you think you're in for a predictable, one-sided, nattily uniformed prep school movie preaching the military virtues, the plot takes a darker twist and we learn that appearances can be very deceiving.  Faced with the closing of the school, the boys turn renegade, immediately betraying their duty of obedience in the emotions of the moment.  While determined, brave,  and motivated by principle, they are at the same time defying legal authority and behaving unwisely.  Recognition of this causes the relationships and trust among the cadets to splinter tragically.  Through the words  of Hutton's career soldier father -- a wonderful supporting performance, with the hard, practical professional tearing down the cadets' naivete --  we are presented a picture of Scott's commandant that does not fit the boys' hero-worshipful image.  And then the national guardsman who arrives to end the armed takeover of the school acts as Hutton's conscience, pointing out to him how far from the path of honor he has truly strayed.Hutton's friends -- the pragmatic Penn, who wants to end the conflict peacefully,  and the belligerent Cruise, who lusts for a bloody showdown -- tug him in two directions and he manages to antagonize both of them, furthering his sense of isolation and failure.  Finally, the  accidental but predictable death of an extremely young  cadet  -- no more than a boy -- is lain at Hutton's feet, and is more than he can bear.  There is no glory or purpose in this death -- ""You just think about what a great little kid he was, and how much you're gonna miss him,""  Hutton  is forced to acknowledge, in the movie's big statement: that high-flown rhetoric  about dying for honor and country  isn't enough.  ""There must have been something more that we weren't taught,"" he tearfully reflects.  Subtly,""Taps"" has moved away from preaching the sanitary hagiography of ""Dulce et decorum est / pro Patria mori"" to address a greater truth -- that without wisdom,  military virtues and sacrifices are just so much posturing and lead  only to waste and misery.  It was a brave statement to make back when this film was made and an even more important concern in 2005.  The final shots -- a grieving Penn  and  the surviving cadets slowly fading into the mist, then an abrupt cut to a reprise of the triumphant military review sequence from earlier in the movie (is this supposed to be a vision of Hutton's entrance into Valhalla?) -- starkly hammer this point home.A fine, thoughtful movie that is sympathetic to all its characters but also does not shy away from condemning their blindness.

But, when the state decides that there is no longer any use for the academy, especially since the mayor feels that the grounds could serve as something more profitable than a military academy, the general (George C. Scott) who runs the academy (who has fought in many true wars), is told to address the cadets that the academy will close in one year.  All that you've learned about ""honor"", just forget about it.  It was a 151 year old joke and a waste of your time.At the 151 year celebration of the academy, a bunch of drunk teens come to mess with the cadets and, of course, a fight escalated and the general himself pulls his gun and accidentally shoots one of the raucous drunk teens.  He then has a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital expecting to face charges for the accidental shooting.  It is then decided that the academy must shut down immediately.  The highest ranking cadet (Timothy Hutton) decides that he will not just shut down the academy just because the governor says so.  So he, Sean Penn, and Tom Cruise, and about a hundred cadets of various ages, establish their own call to arms and defend the academy against the governor.  The governor even brings out the real military to shut down the academy.  Of course, there's not a happy ending to this film.  Kids die standing up for what they've been taught to believe in, and all the good that could have come from these future defenders of our country is suddenly meaningless.  This film sends the message that the human mind is expendable.  Yes, we want to teach you ""honor"" and yes we want you to fight for whatever cause the government may send you off to do.  But, we also want you to be able to turn it off like a ""switch"", and return to being the useless drunk teens that put their thumbs to their noses in the name of our country's true integrity.  In this film, ""honor"" is proven to be an inconvenience if the government sees something more profitable to itself by other means.It's an excellent film, but it sure can make you mad.

Penn provides the voice of reason and Cruise the voice of extremism. George C. Scott plays the headmaster and wartime general that Hutton's character hero-worships.It's no where near as good as, say, Dead Poets Society, but it's decent.
