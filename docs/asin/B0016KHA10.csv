Wish they would get the rest of the sequels out on dvd but in the mean time I will be keeping an eye on the Hallmark Channel and setting my DVR for when they show them.

She's a cross between Samantha Stevens and a cool earth mother type of new age shrink in great clothes.  She has this cool familiar, a black cat named Isis, lots of magical remedies and potions in her home and shop, bakes killer cookies, and has a messy run-down home of which she is obviously the heir.This movie won me over the first time I saw it on Hallmark, and I love how she doesn't solve the problems, but tricks people into solving their own.  Magic?  Depends on how you look at it!  I think it all boils down to possessing a bewitching charm.  She strikes up a friendship with Lori and Brandon, kids of the local cop Jake Russell, then later a low-burn steamy romance with him.  She seems to charm everyone except for the local uptight priss, Martha Tinsdale, who will do anything to make trouble for Cassie because, like too many people, she fears what she doesn't understand.Best of all, we also have The Good Witch's Garden, in which some guy pretends to be an heir of Gray House and is encouraged to make trouble by Marth Tinsdale--of course.  We also now have The Good Witch's Gift, in which Brandon takes a shine to a girl whose dad is a convict and has a tough row to hoe.  Miracle of Miracles?  Martha does an about face and finally accepts Cassie in the community!Pleasant surprises await you with each addition of this wonderful Hallmark family trilogy, and you are never either too young or too old to enjoy fantasy with a touch of subtle reality in the guise of gently taught morals on treating others as you would like them to treat you.

The mayor's wife develops an instant dislike for her and quickly begins to plan on steps to get her out of town.When the young woman opens a shop in town the people are both alarmed and curious by the unusual nature of the shop; is this woman more than she appears, does her presence in town present a potential danger to the town?

For a so-called romance though, it&#8217;s really quite tepid and routine, not to mention chaste.The writing was less than inspired; the scenes were abrupt with awkward time changes (days fluttered by, highlighting an event or two).  In the end it just felt like a few bits and pieces strung together, there was no natural flow to the story.As for the plot, a strange woman (Catherine Bell as Cassandra Nightingale) shows up in a &#8220;quiet&#8221; town ruled by a domineering woman/chairperson Martha Tinsdale (Catherine Disher).  Instantly accused of witchcraft (the dark arts), Cassandra becomes the target of the comically evil Martha who wants Cassandra&#8217;s house and business ruined to suit a nefarious scheme of her own.  Here&#8217;s where things get a little skewed.  Throughout this film, the law is broken multiple times with no repercussions to anyone.  The town sheriff (Chris Potter) is entirely ineffectual in upholding the law, which is either poor writing or an intentional message that if you&#8217;ve got a good enough excuse for breaking the law, your transgressions will be overlooked in this slap-happy town in the middle of nowhere ruled by a cruel and crazy woman, who under normal circumstances, would be considered the resident witch.Nothing about this movie warrants a second viewing, nor did it charm me enough to want to seek out the rest of the series.

There was low cut shirts and dresses; a couple has wine over dinner; and a tasteful scene where a woman buys some aromatherapy oils to improve the intimacy between herself and her husband. It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for 12+.I love this movie and have watched it multiple times.  It is the only &#34;Good Witch&#34; movie out on DVD.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought the DVD immediately.  Most people might skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.I love all the characters: Cassie (the good witch), Jake (the widowed Sheriff), Brandon and Lori (the sheriff's two children), George (their mother's father who lives with them), Derek (sheriff's deputy), Kyle (school bully then Brandon's friend), Nancy (town's travel agent/member of the citizen's league/friend and customer of Cassie), Martha (mayor's wife and person responsible for wanting &#34;The Witch&#34; out of town).She wins the approval of the Sheriff almost immediately and Cassie helps Lori with her bad dreams and Brandon with the school bully.  She even helps Grandfather George.  But before she can truly become part of Middleton, she will need to win over some of the more skeptical neighbors who don't approve of her unique ways.  Especially the mayor's wife, Martha.  She tries to get Cassie's shop closed and hopefully push her out of town.The rest of this six part series are all worth watching and buying.  They are clean, uplifting and teach great lessons about trust, love and family.&#34;THE GOOD WITCH'S GARDEN&#34;: Cassie has settled into Middleton and is busy making a home of Grey House. Her boyfriend, Sheriff Jake Russell, and his kids are happy to have Cassie in the neighborhood, but she has yet to gain the trust of some people in town.  Before long, a stranger rolls into town with papers entitling him to legal ownership of Grey House. Before she knows it, Cassie is left without a home and is convinced Middleton isn&#8217;t where she belongs. Ultimately, everyone will learn holding on too tightly to something can make it more likely that thing will slip through your fingers.&#34;THE GOOD WITCH'S GIFT&#34;:  Cassandra Nightingale always has a few tricks up her sleeve, but is surprised when her handsome sweetheart, Police Chief Jake Russell, proposes. Getting into the spirit of the season, they set their wedding date for Christmas Eve--only six days away!  As the two hurry to plan the wedding, trouble clouds their happiness when a mysterious man from Jake's past returns to town.&#34;THE GOOD WITCH'S FAMILY&#34;:  Life is going well for Cassie as she settles into marriage with Middleton Police Chief Jake Russell and as stepmom to Brandon and Lori. But evil soon blows into town in the form of Cassie's long-lost cousin Abigail, who whips up wickedness like a tornado. The once peaceful Russell family bickers night and day; Jake is fired after an argument with the Mayor over a bridge expansion; and Martha, the Mayor's wife and town busy body, walks out on her long marriage. As the town divides further over neighborhood expansion, Cassie is drafted to run for Mayor. With in her once-happy marriage, her family is unraveling, and Abigail's diabolical &#34;double, double, toil and trouble&#34; is the apex of Cassie's misery. What's a good witch to do?&#34;THE GOOD WITCH'S CHARM&#34;:  Good Witch Cassie Nightingale is back to her bewitching ways, but this time she&#8217;s also juggling a newborn daughter and her job as town Mayor. With such a busy schedule she and her husband, town sheriff Jake Russell, aren&#8217;t getting much sleep. Hoping for a break, Cassie plans a much needed vacation with her new family. But things go awry when a crime wave sweeps through town and an investigative reporter tries to ruin Cassie&#8217;s image after a video of her magically disappearing turns up on the internet. Supported by her loyal family and friends, Cassie must rely on her signature charm to put a stop to the troubles before they completely destroy the town, and a Good Witch&#8217;s reputation!&#34;THE GOOD WITCH'S DESTINY&#34;: (which is still in production): &#34;There's something definitely magical about Cassie Nightingale. But when even her loved ones start to wonder how Cassie seems to know everything and be everywhere, the good witch senses that she's in for a rough ride... It begins with stepdaughter Lori's writing project, the story of the Grey Lady who once lived in their house many years ago &#8211; and who shared more than the same birthday and an amazing physical likeness with Cassie. Then Drew arrives in Middleton, a boastful young man prone to investing fortunes into hopeless scams and blaming others when his projects fail. The person responsible &#8211; in his eyes &#8211; for his current fiasco and his fianc&eacute;e's break-up with him is Cassie. And the vibes he is sending out in her direction are definitely laced with danger. Lori then discovers the Grey Lady's journal which suddenly breaks off on her birthday, which is also Cassie's. As her family fears for her safety, Cassie resolves to clear up the hocus-pocus concerning Drew and the Grey Lady with a tried-and-true method: humor, openness and the acceptance of one's destiny.&#34;Overall, I love this movie and the 4 (soon to be 5) others in this series and will definitely watch it/them over and over again.  I can't wait for all of them to be out on DVD.

1153722,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0016KHA10,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","To be different is to tempt being shunned or made terrible fun of, and THE GOOD WITCH resurrects that old chestnut. A mysterious stranger moves into the town of Middleton, and this being that sort of town, the rumors are soon flying thick as flies. It doesn't help that Cassandra Nightingale takes up residence at the ""Grey House,"" the dilapidated local haunted mansion. With everyone speculating whether Cassie is the frightening Grey Lady come back to life, the mayor's prudish, imperious wife Mrs. Tinsdale soon embarks on her persecution crusade, accusing Cassie of practicing the dark arts and petitioning to throw her out of town. Jake Russell, the town sheriff and a widower of three years, finds himself caught in the middle. Because Cassie, with her enigmatic ways, is giving credence to all the gossip. The sheriff is faced with having to enforce the mayor's wife's vindictiveness even as he becomes attracted to the newcomer.Magic... or just good old psychology at work? Believing that she has certain, er, arcane powers, several in the community approach Cassie with their problems. But if you listen close you'll hear buried in Cassie's whimsical mumbo jumbo some sound advice, a spoonful of common sense, a certain knowledge of human behavior. THE GOOD WITCH, another good 'un from the Hallmark Channel, sets up the mystery of whether Cassie is truly a witch and there's enough tension and Cassie does just enough weird stuff that you're kept guessing. Because Cassie can soothe the savage beast, can tame dream monsters, and then she even opens up an herbal shop she calls Bell, Book & Candle (she charges $5 for each of her merchandise). Oh, Mrs. Tinsdale, Middleton's champion busybody, she's really up in arms now. Meanwhile, Cassie is sneakily improving the lot in life of certain of the townspeople.Part of me wishes the sexy Colonel MacKenzie were still trading courtroom barbs with Commander Rabb, but the role of Cassandra Nightingale is a terrific change of pace for Catherine Bell, and she's still as gorgeous as ever, as, er, bewitching as ever, and here she shows off her playful side. THE GOOD WITCH is a family teleplay, and it does teach lessons of tolerance and open-mindedness and perseverance. Pay attention and you just may suss out that even a violent bully may be going thru his own hell, that a homeless drunk can still contribute if given a chance, that an alluring unorthodox stranger residing in a scary mansion with a black cat doesn't necessarily equate to ""Witch!"" Or maybe it does. THE GOOD WITCH leaves you to make up your own mind. And I like that.Now I'm just holding on for the sequel, THE GOOD WITCH'S GARDEN, to make its way to DVD.",4,"""I will not dream of bunnies.""",1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,2682,"['be', 'different', 'tempt', 'being', 'shunned', 'made', 'terrible', 'fun', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'WITCH', 'old', 'chestnut', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'moves', 'town', 'Middleton', 'being', 'sort', 'town', 'rumors', 'are', 'soon', 'flying', 'thick', 'flies', ""n't"", 'help', 'Cassandra', 'Nightingale', 'up', 'residence', 'Grey', 'House', 'dilapidated', 'local', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'everyone', 'speculating', 'Cassie', 'frightening', 'Grey', 'Lady', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'mayor', 'prudish', 'imperious', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Tinsdale', 'soon', 'persecution', 'crusade', 'accusing', 'Cassie', 'practicing', 'dark', 'arts', 'petitioning', 'throw', 'town', 'Jake', 'Russell', 'town', 'sheriff', 'widower', 'three', 'years', 'caught', 'middle', 'Cassie', 'enigmatic', 'ways', 'giving', 'credence', 'gossip', 'sheriff', 'faced', 'having', 'enforce', 'mayor', 'wife', 'vindictiveness', 'even', 'attracted', 'newcomer.Magic', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'psychology', 'work', 'Believing', 'certain', 'er', 'arcane', 'powers', 'several', 'community', 'approach', 'Cassie', 'problems', 'listen', 'close', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'buried', 'Cassie', 'whimsical', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'sound', 'advice', 'spoonful', 'common', 'sense', 'certain', 'knowledge', 'human', 'behavior', 'GOOD', 'WITCH', 'good', ""'un"", 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'up', 'mystery', 'Cassie', 'truly', 'witch', 'enough', 'tension', 'Cassie', 'just', 'enough', 'weird', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'kept', 'guessing', 'Cassie', 'can', 'soothe', 'savage', 'beast', 'can', 'tame', 'dream', 'monsters', 'then', 'even', 'up', 'herbal', 'shop', 'Bell', 'Book', 'Candle', '5', 'merchandise', 'Oh', 'Mrs.', 'Tinsdale', 'Middleton', 'champion', 'busybody', 'really', 'up', 'arms', 'now', 'Meanwhile', 'Cassie', 'sneakily', 'improving', 'lot', 'life', 'certain', 'townspeople.Part', 'sexy', 'Colonel', 'MacKenzie', 'were', 'still', 'trading', 'courtroom', 'barbs', 'Commander', 'Rabb', 'role', 'Cassandra', 'Nightingale', 'terrific', 'change', 'pace', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'still', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'ever', 'er', 'bewitching', 'ever', 'here', 'playful', 'side', 'GOOD', 'WITCH', 'family', 'teleplay', 'teach', 'lessons', 'tolerance', 'open-mindedness', 'perseverance', 'Pay', 'attention', 'just', 'may', 'suss', 'out', 'even', 'violent', 'bully', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'own', 'hell', 'homeless', 'drunk', 'can', 'still', 'contribute', 'given', 'chance', 'alluring', 'unorthodox', 'stranger', 'residing', 'scary', 'mansion', 'black', 'cat', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'equate', 'Witch', 'maybe', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'WITCH', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'like', 'that.Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'holding', 'sequel', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'WITCH', 'GARDEN', 'make', 'way', 'DVD']",The Good Witch

This movie is special because it has a lot of great standout performances, centering on a great plot. OK some of the acting is ""Murder, She Wrote"" worthy, but overall it's a heartwarming picture that your entire family will appreciate.Catherine Bell plays Cassie, in the title role and she is just amazing. This is the first time I have ever seen her in anything and she comes off as believable and relatable. Watching Ms. Bell was like watching an old friend that I had known for years. It's a rare actress that can capture that type of sentiment and emotion for her viewers within the first few minutes like Ms. Bell has done.The character of Cassie is my very favorite. She's a little mysterious and a little esoteric and always knows how to solve other people's problems. Chris Potter was also really great as the local sheriff and the two made a lovely couple in the movie because she was the ying for his yang.One of the main messages that I got from ""The Good Witch"" is the importance of compassion. Even though some of the people in her town were less than hospitable (such as the mayor's gossipy wife), Cassie was able to keep a cheerful disposition. And in the end there's a shocking outcome, I don't want to give it away but I will say that Cassie was able to forgive which I'm sure is a lot more than most people could do if presented with the same situation of circumstances.If you're looking for an extraordinary movie about just an ordinary lady, watch ""The Good Witch.""

All of the characters are well-developed, and even the child characters/actors do a terrific job of being believable and very likable.  My favorite character, of course, is Cassandra herself.  There is just something about her; she seems to cast a ""spell"" over almost everyone in town (except for the mayor's wife), and I couldn't help falling in love with her along with them!  Catherine Bell is wonderful in this role, and I also loved Chris Potter as the sheriff.  I would love to own the next two movies on DVD, ""The Good Witch's Garden"" and ""The Good Witch's Gift"".  Unfortunately, they are not available right now, but I am hoping they'll be out before the fourth movie debuts on the Hallmark Channel in October.

The character of Cassandra Nightingale moves to the town of Middleton because she inherited a mansion, and is hoping that the long-time residents welcome her.  She soon bonds with a widowed policeman father Jake Russell (played by Chris Potter) and his two children.  She opens up her own business of magical items and soon encounters resistance from those who have a challenging time accepting her and figuring her out due to her unique personality.  The character of Cassandra Nightingale has a big heart, but it matters little to the Mayors wife Martha (played by Catherine Disher).  Martha instantly treats Cassandra coldly upon first meeting her.  Martha eventually petitions to try to drive Cassandra to leave town again.  Cassandra at first considers and wonders whether she made the right decision in moving to Middleton.  This is only because she longs to find a place where she can feel like she belongs and is accepted. Cassandra Nightingale yearns for the sense of acceptance and belonging. Jake Russell sees the good and potential in her and urges Cassandra to reconsider her decision in moving.  He persuasively reasons with her by mentioning how she has ran away from so much in her life that she needs to stop running away.  Hearing this statement resonated with me, and I am glad that I followed the prompting of my spirit to watch this movie.  I only say this because I appreciate where I live, and I now intend to permanently settle in the D.C. area.  However, less than three months ago (May 2011), I admit that I at first wondered if I made the right decision in choosing to stay in the D.C. area. In addition, I also know what its like to desire the feeling of a sense of belonging and acceptance. Luckily, I received a series of personal confirmations that choosing to stay in the D.C. area is the most joyful decision.  For me to watch a movie that featured a character going through a similar situation with this was very healing for me.  I intend to watch the other movie sequels to ""Good Witch"".

If the movie was too hot to handle, they could've asked Walt Disney Video (Hocus Pocus) or Warner Home Video (Practical Magic) to buy it.

I have seen the 4 sequels in 16x9 from Hallmark HD channel.  I wonder if ""The Good Witch"" was made in 16x9.  Besides being portrayed by a beautiful & charming actress, Catharine Bell, the character of Cassie Nightingale has a subtle magic (subtler than ""Bewitched"" or ""Harry Potter) based on strong intuition, sensitivity to others's needs & a psychological gift for ministering to the needs of the other.  Cassie is also a person who brings out the best in others by seeing beyond appearances & patiently expecting a person's better nature to emerge.",5,"The Good Witch, 4x3, not 16x9?",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,653,"['love', 'Good', 'Witch', '4', 'sequels', 'saw', '4x3', 'format', 'see', 'DVD', 'also', '4x3', 'have', 'seen', '4', 'sequels', '16x9', 'Hallmark', 'HD', 'channel', 'wonder', 'Good', 'Witch', 'was', 'made', '16x9', 'being', 'portrayed', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'actress', 'Catharine', 'Bell', 'character', 'Cassie', 'Nightingale', 'subtle', 'magic', 'subtler', 'Bewitched', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'based', 'strong', 'intuition', 'sensitivity', 'others', 'needs', 'psychological', 'gift', 'ministering', 'needs', 'other', 'Cassie', 'also', 'person', 'who', 'out', 'best', 'others', 'seeing', 'appearances', 'patiently', 'expecting', 'person', 'better', 'nature', 'emerge']",The Good Witch
