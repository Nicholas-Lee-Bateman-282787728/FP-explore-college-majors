I trully loved it, and it introduced me to the wonderful music of the 50's and 60's, and i'm glad because today's music is trully trash(Britney Spears).

Years later there is going to be a TV special with them as the stars.

I was so thrilled to find that Amazon.com had it on DVD!!!It's really a great movie, going back to the 1960's songs & Jill Eikenberry, Judith Light & Sandy Duncan have really great voices-that in itself made this movie!!

1039553,AYAADU8AAMME2,B000LMPLNS,"ManningGal ""TnBFan4LIFE""","[1, 1]","This TV film revolves around the somewhat unwilling reunion of a female musical group that was a teen sensation. It's most famous hit song was ""My Boyfriend's Back""--the title of the film. The film stars Jill Eikenberry of LA Law fame, Sandy Duncan of TV's Hogan Family, and Judith Light--who skyrocketed to fame as closeted prostitute & doctor's wife, Karen Wolek, on the ABC Daytime Drama One Life To Live in the late 70s-mid 80s, and then, found primetime sitcom icon status with ABC's Who's The Boss? and now Ugly Betty. I originally watched this film debut on TV and had enjoyed it very much. When I saw it again on Amazon, I was hit by a wave of nostalgia. It was even better in some respects than I  remembered. I have to say that the major draw for me at the time & still is Judith Light. I have been a fan since her phenomenal days on OLTL and then on WTB. I am so thrilled she is back on primetime again with Ugly Betty.The film touches on some great dramatic issues and all three ladies have great comedic timing. And, it's a chance to hear all three sing, which is worth the time.",4,Good Feel Good Film!!,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1092,"['TV', 'film', 'somewhat', 'unwilling', 'reunion', 'female', 'musical', 'group', 'was', 'teen', 'sensation', 'most', 'famous', 'hit', 'song', 'was', 'Boyfriend', 'Back', 'title', 'film', 'film', 'stars', 'Jill', 'Eikenberry', 'LA', 'Law', 'fame', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'TV', 'Hogan', 'Family', 'Judith', 'Light', 'who', 'skyrocketed', 'fame', 'closeted', 'prostitute', 'doctor', 'wife', 'Karen', 'Wolek', 'ABC', 'Daytime', 'Drama', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'late', '70s-mid', '80s', 'then', 'found', 'primetime', 'sitcom', 'icon', 'status', 'ABC', 'Who', 'Boss', 'now', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'originally', 'watched', 'film', 'debut', 'TV', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'When', 'saw', 'again', 'Amazon', 'was', 'hit', 'wave', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'respects', 'remembered', 'have', 'say', 'major', 'draw', 'time', 'still', 'Judith', 'Light', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'phenomenal', 'days', 'OLTL', 'then', 'WTB', 'am', 'so', 'thrilled', 'back', 'primetime', 'again', 'Ugly', 'Betty.The', 'film', 'touches', 'great', 'dramatic', 'issues', 'three', 'ladies', 'have', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'chance', 'hear', 'three', 'sing', 'time']",N/A
