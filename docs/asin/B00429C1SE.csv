I eventually abandoned the walking videos for more active ones.  I recently have come back to the walking videos and Leslie, having bought several of her newer ones.  This one is my least favorite.  I have a high tolerance for talking and bad music, but this one pushed me over the limits.  Leslie's cueing is way off, the music does not fit, and there is way too much chatter, even for Leslie.  Normally I don't mind, but this one got on my nerves. Iwould not buy this again as Leslie has others that are much better.Update:  I have been doing it without sound (an option available on the DVD) and find it more tolerable--but the cueing is still way off.",3,Not her best DVD,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,732,"['very', 'first', 'exercise', 'video', '15', 'so', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'eventually', 'abandoned', 'walking', 'videos', 'more', 'active', 'ones', 'recently', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'walking', 'videos', 'Leslie', 'having', 'bought', 'several', 'newer', 'ones', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'have', 'high', 'tolerance', 'talking', 'bad', 'music', 'one', 'pushed', 'limits', 'Leslie', 'cueing', 'way', 'music', 'not', 'fit', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'chatter', 'even', 'Leslie', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'one', 'got', 'nerves', 'Iwould', 'not', 'buy', 'again', 'Leslie', 'others', 'are', 'much', 'better.Update', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'sound', 'option', 'available', 'DVD', 'find', 'more', 'tolerable', 'cueing', 'still', 'way']",Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles
1382504,A3Q7ZL6TPRX2Y,B00429C1SE,Butterscotch,"[6, 10]","I did this workout two times completely through and almost passed out each time from the extremely fast pace. By the middle of the video even Leslie looked terrible; her outfit was covered in fresh wet sweat, her hair was plastered to her face, and the girl next to her, was very red-faced and looked ready to fall over. Along with Leslie there are 6 other walkers, but most looked much better towards the end than Leslie did - in her own video she couldn't keep up. The music was 50s rock and roll but was barely audible over Leslie's talking. The music also didn't match well with the moves; the DVD would have been better with just instrumental music. Anyhow, the workout is about 45 minutes long, each mile (3 total) is about 16 minutes, with a very small warm-up and cool down section. The moves are the same from her other videos: knee lifts, side steps, and kicks, although this DVD had tons of side-steps in comparison to her other DVDs. There are no 'boosters' in this walk since the pace is so fast. The reason I do Leslie's walking workouts are because of the relatively slow pace and consistency of movement; I want to enjoy my workouts and have fun, and not feel like I'm working out. This DVD made me hate my 45 minutes of exercise and left me with a very unpleasant feeling. Despite being in-shape and a daily exerciser, I found this walk too fast.",2,Way Too Fast-Paced,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1363,"['did', 'workout', 'two', 'times', 'completely', 'almost', 'passed', 'out', 'time', 'extremely', 'fast', 'pace', 'middle', 'video', 'even', 'Leslie', 'looked', 'terrible', 'outfit', 'was', 'covered', 'fresh', 'wet', 'sweat', 'hair', 'was', 'plastered', 'face', 'girl', 'next', 'was', 'very', 'red-faced', 'looked', 'ready', 'fall', 'over', 'Leslie', 'are', '6', 'other', 'walkers', 'most', 'looked', 'much', 'better', 'end', 'Leslie', 'did', 'own', 'video', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'music', 'was', '50s', 'rock', 'roll', 'was', 'barely', 'audible', 'Leslie', 'talking', 'music', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'well', 'moves', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'instrumental', 'music', 'Anyhow', 'workout', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'mile', '3', 'total', '16', 'minutes', 'very', 'small', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'section', 'moves', 'are', 'same', 'other', 'videos', 'knee', 'lifts', 'side', 'steps', 'kicks', 'DVD', 'had', 'tons', 'side-steps', 'comparison', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', ""'boosters"", 'walk', 'pace', 'so', 'fast', 'reason', 'do', 'Leslie', 'walking', 'workouts', 'are', 'relatively', 'slow', 'pace', 'consistency', 'movement', 'want', 'enjoy', 'workouts', 'have', 'fun', 'not', 'feel', ""'m"", 'working', 'out', 'DVD', 'made', 'hate', '45', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'left', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'feeling', 'being', 'in-shape', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'found', 'walk', 'too', 'fast']",Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles

Some of the transitions between the different steps could have been smoother, but overall you will enjoy the fast-pace and energy of some of the veteran walkers, who have been in Leslie's other videos. There are a variety of steps, with less time spent on each step, making for less repetition and lots of variety. This DVD will keep you awake and before you know it, the workout is over. The walker's outfits are brightly colored and add to the energy of the video. There is an add-on cool down, which I especially liked, since I am not usually quite ready to end and slow down. This adds a few extra minutes for a smoother transition to the cool down. This DVD is a great choice to add to your library of Leslie Sansone walk videos.Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles",5,Review Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,848,"['DVD', 'new', 'fast', 'music', 'workout', 'fast', 'making', 'one', 'favorites', 'transitions', 'different', 'steps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smoother', 'overall', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fast-pace', 'energy', 'veteran', 'walkers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'Leslie', 'other', 'videos', 'are', 'variety', 'steps', 'less', 'time', 'spent', 'step', 'making', 'less', 'repetition', 'lots', 'variety', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'awake', 'know', 'workout', 'walker', 'outfits', 'are', 'brightly', 'colored', 'add', 'energy', 'video', 'add-on', 'cool', 'down', 'especially', 'liked', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'quite', 'ready', 'end', 'slow', 'down', 'few', 'extra', 'minutes', 'smoother', 'transition', 'cool', 'down', 'DVD', 'great', 'choice', 'add', 'library', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walk', 'Sansone', '3', 'Fast', 'Miles']",Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles

The workout is good, and I like the pretty fast pace, but some of the things about it just kinda bother me.  Like when she says she is going to go ""mambo with her baby"" and then stops to talk to someone else on the way and almost doesn't even get back to her daughter.  Also, the camera work is not the best.  It zooms in weird sometimes.  Also, she has one of the other ladies lead the workout for part of the time, which wouldn't be so bad, but Leslie is the only one who has a microphone on, so you can't even hear what the other lady is saying.  You only hear Leslie's comments about what is being done.  I try to somewhat read lips as well as just following the actions, but it would be nice, when she talks to people, to be able to hear their responses.  If you are looking for a good fast 3 miles, though, then it definitely delivers.",3,"Good, but not my favorite",1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,960,"['borrowed', 'one', 'library', 'really', 'doing', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'workout', 'good', 'like', 'pretty', 'fast', 'pace', 'things', 'just', 'kinda', 'bother', 'when', 'going', 'go', 'mambo', 'baby', 'then', 'talk', 'someone', 'else', 'way', 'almost', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'back', 'daughter', 'Also', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'best', 'weird', 'sometimes', 'Also', 'one', 'other', 'ladies', 'lead', 'workout', 'part', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Leslie', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'microphone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'what', 'other', 'lady', 'saying', 'only', 'hear', 'Leslie', 'comments', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'try', 'somewhat', 'read', 'lips', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'following', 'actions', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'when', 'people', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'responses', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'fast', '3', 'miles', 'though', 'then', 'definitely']",Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles

Its fast all the way through and has incorporated some different combinations of moves than most of Leslie's other workouts.  Moves are easy to follow but sometimes the queueing is off a bit.  I really sweat to this one, and I'm in great shape!  I use a pedometer when I'm working out, and this DVD ends up slightly in excess of 5000 steps, which is half of my daily goal, in just slightly more than 45 minutes.  Its got a music only option, which is great on something that you watch again and again and again.  (And I will be watching it again and again and again.)The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 .... the stretch at the end is very minimal, especially for the calf muscles; really need more stretching since we've been using the muscles pretty heavily all the way through the ""walkout"".  I also don't like Leslie letting Mary lead the class, even for two minutes, although this one works alot better than some of the others that I've seen.",4,Yes!
