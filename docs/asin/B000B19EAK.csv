I started listening to Keith with the Golden Road and Be Here albums; about a five years ago I really got into listening to music from lesser known artists and accumulated many CDs and I forgot all about Keith. Last year I rediscovered Keith and bought all his other albums and his two concert DVDs. I love that his songs inspires me to be a more loving and kind person and each day every step that I take makes me a little less afraid of giving into love.,5,Love the way he tells a story with his songs,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,533,"['Keith', 'talks', 'songs', 'providing', 'story', 'certainly', 'can', 'see', 'started', 'listening', 'Keith', 'Golden', 'Road', 'Be', 'Here', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'got', 'listening', 'music', 'lesser', 'known', 'artists', 'accumulated', 'many', 'CDs', 'forgot', 'Keith', 'Last', 'year', 'rediscovered', 'Keith', 'bought', 'other', 'albums', 'two', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'love', 'songs', 'be', 'more', 'loving', 'kind', 'person', 'day', 'step', 'take', 'little', 'less', 'afraid', 'giving', 'love']",N/A

He has some awesome riffs on these songs and does them even better live than on CD. He also plays piano on one song near the end.

935656,AK94JSHTPQ1CX,B000B19EAK,Pablo Bridges,"[4, 4]","This performance is simply extraordinary. It's very rare to see a performance where the artist is, well, uhm, perfect, like this.  He sings every note on key, plays every note perfectly, strongly connects with the audience, and yet he is often jumping around on stage and giving an improvisational impression.  Every member of his band is rock-solid.  The audio and video quality are great.  He is accomplished at keyboards, but his true mastery shows on both acoustic and electric guitar. Things to watch for:-A young lady in the audience at one point in tears at his mastery.-The forward pickups on his fender guitar completely missing (thus, all scorching tone provided by the bridge pickup).-Dobro and Mandolin adding some acoustic authenticity.-Allowing other members of the band to take vocal solos (generous).-As he's playing, laying down near the audience and grabbing a gal's camera and taking a photo of both of them, and later signing an autograph as he's singing/playing.  Unbelievable.In terms of musicianship, the only other country music DVD in this class (in my opinion) is the one by the Dixie Chicks.Since he's an Aussie, I'm very impressed that he understands ""American"" country music so well.
