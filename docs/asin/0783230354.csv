""Greedy"" explores just how low people will stoop where there is money involved. Especially if they think they have a chance to get some of it. Watch as these characters stab each other in the back, while at the same time teaming up to get the fortune from their uncle, any way they have to. The effects of greed in people lives can make for very unusual behavior. Michael Douglas is awesome and apparently enjoyed this role very much. A movie you will want to see again and again.

62933,AY12DBB0U420B,0783230354,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack DVD was ""Greedy"" starring Michael. J Fox and Kirk Douglas. It was one of the better Fox movies I've seen recently. It was a comedy that was naturally somewhat ironic and humorous and the actors didn't have to try so hard to be funny. It poked a lot of fun at people in general and their tendency toward greedy ways and we probably could all see ourselves in it. Douglas was cast as an aging extended family member having considerable wealth and all the other actors were subordinate family members waiting for him to croak so that they could inherit their share (as large as they could get it) of his wealthy empire. Well, the old goat (Kirk Douglas) was a sly and controlling manipulator who had them all dangling on strings. It was funny and graphically brought out the greed we all (well, most of us) have within us. I particularly found all the backstabbing to get to the top position was amusing. Fox, was one of the minor relatives and one who was disinclined to participate, but even he got caught up in the greed. It all came to an amusing and surprising ending.The movie was fairly well done. The photography and sound were good, as was the setting. The movie had a good pace and boredom never set it. It was good to see Kirk Douglas again after many years absence, at least for me. The other acting was, well, hit and miss. Some of the parts were overacted in the extreme, but I guess this was part of being a comedy and trying so hard to be funny. Personally, I think better direction could have been exercised. All in all, it was a fairly good and fairly amusing movie.Gary Peterson",4,A Fairly Good and Fairly Amusing Movie.,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1620,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'DVD', 'was', 'Greedy', 'starring', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'Fox', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'was', 'comedy', 'was', 'naturally', 'somewhat', 'ironic', 'humorous', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'poked', 'lot', 'fun', 'people', 'general', 'tendency', 'greedy', 'ways', 'probably', 'could', 'all', 'see', 'Douglas', 'was', 'cast', 'aging', 'extended', 'family', 'member', 'having', 'considerable', 'wealth', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'subordinate', 'family', 'members', 'waiting', 'croak', 'so', 'could', 'inherit', 'share', 'as', 'large', 'could', 'get', 'wealthy', 'empire', 'Well', 'old', 'goat', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'was', 'sly', 'controlling', 'manipulator', 'who', 'had', 'all', 'dangling', 'strings', 'was', 'funny', 'graphically', 'brought', 'out', 'greed', 'well', 'most', 'have', 'particularly', 'found', 'backstabbing', 'get', 'top', 'position', 'was', 'amusing', 'Fox', 'was', 'one', 'minor', 'relatives', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'disinclined', 'participate', 'even', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'greed', 'came', 'amusing', 'surprising', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'photography', 'sound', 'were', 'good', 'was', 'setting', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'pace', 'boredom', 'never', 'set', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'absence', 'least', 'other', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'hit', 'miss', 'parts', 'were', 'overacted', 'extreme', 'guess', 'was', 'part', 'being', 'comedy', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'Personally', 'think', 'better', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exercised', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'movie.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Director Jonathan Lynn toys with this very idea througout this extremely funny film with hilarious results and surprise after surprise.It's uncle Joe's 75th birthday, and his rotten relatives fight each other to earn the slightest ounce of respect from him.  But Uncle Joe surprises them all with the arrival of a sexy young English nurse.  Highly suspicious of this woman's intentions, the relatives enlist the help of their cousin Danny (Michael J. Fox) who had always been in Uncle Joe's good favor over the years.  While secretly jealous of Danny, they realize he's their only hope in keeping the family fortune within the family.  Danny reluctantly agrees to help his greedy cousins only if it benefits Uncle Joe's welfare.  But slowly, he too becomes tempted by wealth, and like the rest, falls prey to Uncle Joe's crafty game of manipulation.  In the end, who will rise above the rest in Uncle Joe's complex test?Absolutley hilarious with many laugh out loud moments.
