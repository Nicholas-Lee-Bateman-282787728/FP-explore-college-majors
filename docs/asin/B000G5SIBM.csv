998790,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000G5SIBM,A Customer,"[112, 113]","The good news is that in Ballets Russes, viewers don't need to know anything about ballet to enjoy this electrifying documentary by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, This is a lovingly and confidently made documentary that brings to life an era of unequaled artistic excitement. Equally heart-wrenching, and riveting and thoroughly entertaining the Ballet Russes unwinds like a historical thriller, laying bare the politics, rivalries, tremendous egos, and creative appetites that produced two of the world's greatest ballet companies.Weaving actual historical footage of the companies with interviews of these dancers today, the film starts with a first-ever reunion of Ballets Russes dancers in New Orleans in 2000, and juxtaposes this with the various permutations of the troupes that started with impresario Serge Diaghilev's legendary Paris-based Ballets Russes. When Diaghilev died in 1929, ballet came to a standstill until a pair of entrepreneurs began Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo two years later.What follows is a beguiling journey through the intoxicating twists and turns of the next 30 years of ballet history, which involved competing companies, the legendary choreographers George Balanchine, Leonide Massine and David Lichine, and almost every major dancer you can think of, including dancers such as Alicia Markova and Alexandra Danilova. The guides through this world are the dancers themselves, many white-haired and elderly, offering up sharp and often-funny anecdotes. Some were barely in their teens at the time, from families who had lost everything in the Russian Revolution.These men and women, many of them now in their 80s and 90s, are still totally alive and articulate, including the regal Markova, the coquettish Nathalie Krassovska, and the red-convertible driving octogenarian Tatiana Riabouchinska, who continues to teach because ""what will I do, sell fruit? This is my life."" These dancers, choreographers, and impresarios were shamelessly passionate in pursing their professional and personal lives, and the result is a story filled with enough backstage intrigues, romantic rivalries and unlikely assignations to make it the juiciest of artistic soap operas.The male dancers are equally compelling, there's Frederick Franklin, who talks movingly of his nearly 20-year partnership with Danilova and also the 90-year-old Marc Platt, who had his name changed to Platoff because everyone had to seem Russian, and the vital George Zoritch, captured reliving the past with Krassovska in a moment from ""Giselle."" Their grainy performance clips give us an emotional quality that is not to be matched, and their interviews reflected an era of excitement, novelty, innovation, and yes, even sexiness!The Ballets Russes is one of the best documentaries of the year, a wonderful story of a grand moment in high-art culture, the archival footage so breathtaking, and the reminiscences so piquant, that even a novice can't help being swept up in this ode to one of the world's greatest art forms.

We take it for granted, but at the beginning of the last century ballet was almost nonexistent in the US, and elsewhere in the world it was in serious danger of dying out. When two banker-types decided to restart a legendary dance troupe and give the art of ballet a new, modern face, they single-handedly resurrected the art form and changed the world of dance forever.""Ballet Russes"" documents the golden years of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and its offshoot, the Original Ballet Russe. Through wonderful archival footage and delightful interviews with surviving dancers (of which there are a surprising amount; dancing is very good for your health) we witness incredible athleticism, heartbreaking artistry, and enough drama to fill ten seasons of ""Desperate Housewives"".There's the machinations of warring choreographers Massine and Balanchine (he of the ""baby ballerinas""), the love affairs and feuds of the dancers (""The Russians weren't very nice to each other,"" recalls Fredrick Franklin, still delightfully gossipy in his eighties) and of course recollections of playing a Salvador Dali ballet in Middle America (""Strange people dressed in strange costumes doing strange things"", as one dancer puts it.).These were some spectactular-looking people, as the photos attest. Three ballerinas, now pushing ninety, get all giggly remembering the hunkiness of George Zoritch (who is still alive and looks at least twenty years younger than he is). Zoritch and his old partner Krassovaska dance out a scene from Giselle for the cameras in what has to be the documentary's most adorable moment (he later recalls Krassovaska's six week marriage to a Hollywood musician with a roll of his eyes).  Every interview snippet with spitfire Tatiana Riabouchinska is also a treat. Her story of how she started taking ballet classes is hilarious (""No one said no to my Mother."").As they toured across America, the dancers ignited the love of ballet in young people of every background. The filmakers interview Native American Maria Tallchief (who inspired me to take up ballet), as well as the company's first black ballerina, Raven Wilkinson (whose career was cut short thanks to the Klu Klux Klan). The troupe made a brief stop-off in Hollywood, where they casually cranked out a couple of films. None of them really stayed, though. Dancing was their love and their life, and even though they were treated more or less like circus animals, they all had the bug. Sixty years later, many of them tear up when they remember their time on the stage for the greatest ballet company in the world.You don't have to be a ballet nut to enjoy this film, and you don't have to understand why a person would want to dedicate their entire life to prancing around in tights. The passion of these still-spry dancers will explain it for you. They did what they were born to do, and they had a blast doing it. We can all understand that, can't we?GRADE: ANOTE: Watch for my favorite moment in the film, a clip of the Rita Hayworth film, ""Tonight and Every Night"" with Ballet Russe dancer Marc Platt.

998795,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000G5SIBM,Craig Matteson,"[5, 5]","The Ballet Russe of Serge Diaghilev. Alexandre Benois, Leon Bakst, and many others is important to many lovers of the arts.  For me, as a classical musician, it was vital because of the start it gave Igor Stravinsky, and the famous pieces from Debussy, Ravel, Satie, Poulenc, Prokofiev, and so many others.  For designers, the sets and designs by Benois, Bakst, Picasso, Braque, Dali, and others are still studied and widely admired.  For dancers, this legendary dance company had some of the greatest dancers: Nijinsky, Fokine, Ida Rubenstien, Pavlova, Karsavina, and many others.  However, this film is NOT about this company.  While it refers to this company, it does so only briefly and quite superficially.  This movie is about those companies that were formed out of the original Ballets Russes when Diaghilev died at 57 in 1929.In 1932, Renee Blum and Colonel Vassily de Basil picked up the sets and pieces of the Ballet Russe, which had stopped performing in 1929, and formed a new company they called the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.  This movie is the story of the forming of this company, its choreographers, dancers, and its division into two competing companies.When the new company was first formed, its dances were done by Balanchine, but after one year he was replaced by Leonid Massine who created a vast body of high quality works for the company.  Blum quit the partnership with de Basil in 1936.  In 1938. Massine wanted his own company and he and de Basil reached a compromise where Massine would keep the name Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and de Basil's company would be called ""The Original Ballet Russe"" and kept Massine's dances.  Massine's new backer was Serge Denham who kept the company going at various artistic levels until it stopped performing in 1962.How all this is told in the movie is fascinating, especially with the vignettes told by of all the dancers.  They are all amazing characters.  While some of them began dancing in the troupe as 14 and 15 year olds, many are still staying involved with the stage in various ways.What is also fascinating about this film is that so many of the original dancers are still alive in their eighties and nineties!  There was a reunion of those living and healthy enough to make the trip in 2000 (several have since died) and they were interviewed about their work with the various incarnations of the Ballet Russe, the choreographers, impresarios, tours, their own careers, and what they remember about the other dancers.Some of them even had careers in Hollywood during the 1940s, both companies fleeing to America during World War II.  Sol Hurok was the impresario in North America during the war years and afterwards.  He and de Basil had a falling out (de Basil was quite a difficult man) and his company ended up touring South and Central America and Australia while the Massine company became an American troupe and began hiring American dancers, even if they fancied up their names to sound Russian.  ""The Original Ballet Russe"" of de Basil ended with his death in 1952.A fascinating movie for those interested in this artistic form and its history.  There is a great deal of archival footage and pictures that are all the more amazing when put into context by the dancers still living when the film was made.One of the realities that will come to you as you see the lives these great dancers lived off stage is that artists usually have to draw their satisfactions from their art.  They certainly didn't get rich from the stage and their lives afterwards weren't all that easy either.  At least that is how it looks to me when I see how they live, the kinds of cars they drive, and so forth.  I am sure some lived well, but certainly not all.",5,The history of the companies calling themselves Ballet Russe after Diaghilev died in 1929,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,3725,"['Ballet', 'Russe', 'Serge', 'Diaghilev', 'Alexandre', 'Benois', 'Leon', 'Bakst', 'many', 'others', 'important', 'many', 'lovers', 'arts', 'classical', 'musician', 'was', 'vital', 'start', 'gave', 'Igor', 'Stravinsky', 'famous', 'pieces', 'Debussy', 'Ravel', 'Satie', 'Poulenc', 'Prokofiev', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'designers', 'sets', 'designs', 'Benois', 'Bakst', 'Picasso', 'Braque', 'Dali', 'others', 'are', 'still', 'studied', 'widely', 'admired', 'dancers', 'legendary', 'dance', 'company', 'had', 'greatest', 'dancers', 'Nijinsky', 'Fokine', 'Ida', 'Rubenstien', 'Pavlova', 'Karsavina', 'many', 'others', 'However', 'film', 'NOT', 'company', 'company', 'so', 'only', 'briefly', 'quite', 'superficially', 'movie', 'companies', 'were', 'formed', 'original', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'when', 'Diaghilev', 'died', '57', '1929.In', '1932', 'Renee', 'Blum', 'Colonel', 'Vassily', 'Basil', 'picked', 'up', 'sets', 'pieces', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'had', 'stopped', 'performing', '1929', 'formed', 'new', 'company', 'called', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'movie', 'story', 'forming', 'company', 'choreographers', 'dancers', 'division', 'two', 'competing', 'companies.When', 'new', 'company', 'was', 'first', 'formed', 'dances', 'were', 'done', 'Balanchine', 'one', 'year', 'was', 'replaced', 'Leonid', 'Massine', 'who', 'created', 'vast', 'body', 'high', 'quality', 'works', 'company', 'Blum', 'quit', 'partnership', 'de', 'Basil', '1936', '1938', 'Massine', 'wanted', 'own', 'company', 'de', 'Basil', 'reached', 'compromise', 'where', 'Massine', 'would', 'keep', 'name', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'de', 'Basil', 'company', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'Original', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'kept', 'Massine', 'dances', 'Massine', 'new', 'backer', 'was', 'Serge', 'Denham', 'who', 'kept', 'company', 'going', 'various', 'artistic', 'levels', 'stopped', 'performing', '1962.How', 'told', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'vignettes', 'told', 'dancers', 'are', 'amazing', 'characters', 'began', 'dancing', 'troupe', '14', '15', 'year', 'olds', 'many', 'are', 'still', 'staying', 'involved', 'stage', 'various', 'ways.What', 'also', 'fascinating', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'original', 'dancers', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'was', 'reunion', 'living', 'healthy', 'enough', 'make', 'trip', '2000', 'several', 'have', 'died', 'were', 'interviewed', 'work', 'various', 'incarnations', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'choreographers', 'impresarios', 'tours', 'own', 'careers', 'what', 'remember', 'other', 'dancers.Some', 'even', 'had', 'careers', 'Hollywood', '1940s', 'companies', 'fleeing', 'America', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Sol', 'Hurok', 'was', 'impresario', 'North', 'America', 'war', 'years', 'afterwards', 'de', 'Basil', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'Basil', 'was', 'quite', 'difficult', 'man', 'company', 'ended', 'up', 'touring', 'South', 'Central', 'America', 'Australia', 'Massine', 'company', 'became', 'American', 'troupe', 'began', 'hiring', 'American', 'dancers', 'even', 'fancied', 'up', 'names', 'sound', 'Russian', 'Original', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'de', 'Basil', 'ended', 'death', '1952.A', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'interested', 'artistic', 'form', 'history', 'great', 'deal', 'archival', 'footage', 'pictures', 'are', 'more', 'amazing', 'when', 'put', 'context', 'dancers', 'still', 'living', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made.One', 'realities', 'will', 'come', 'see', 'lives', 'great', 'dancers', 'lived', 'off', 'stage', 'artists', 'usually', 'have', 'draw', 'satisfactions', 'art', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'rich', 'stage', 'lives', 'afterwards', 'were', ""n't"", 'easy', 'least', 'how', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'live', 'kinds', 'cars', 'drive', 'so', 'forth', 'am', 'sure', 'lived', 'well', 'certainly', 'not']",Ballets Russes

It is also a touching meditation on the vibrancy and enthusiasm of youth as it is reflected by the mature personality as it stands at the threshold of the beyond.  A number of the radiant artists who were interviewed by the highly gifted film makers, Geller and Goldfine, had passed on by the time this documentary was released.  What a gift of foresight to have captured these beautiful, lively and animated artists, juices fully flowing, as they recalled the liminal era in which modern art exploded on the scene.You only have to scan the other reviews to see with what love this film was received.  Ballets Russes is a precious document of an unforgettable era in the history of art.  If you are touched by these artists and want a wonderful little surprise, look at the DVD Black Tights/Bolshoi 67.

After it was over, I found myself amazed and wanting to find out even more about the Ballet Russe and wishing I could have seen them at their prime.The basic components of this DVD are archival footage of the actual Ballets, pictures of individuals involved with them, and interview sessions with a handful, maybe two handfuls, of surviving dancers who are well into their 80s.Granted, I needed to take a break halfway through because there is a lot to digest in this DVD, as soon as you press play, it is very engrossing.  It is amazing to see how passionate these people are about dance, what they had to go through, the ups and downs, the different dance companies.  You really find yourself affected by their stories.It was even more personal to me because I have actually seen and touched many of these costumes.  Having worked at a museum there was an entire wall in one of the storage rooms devoted to the Ballet Russe.  And just seeing the names of the ballets brought back many memories.You don't have to be a fan of the ballet to enjoy this DVD.

See it!The kindness and humanity of the very old dancers interviewed is especially notable. Wonderful people are shown at their best during their very old age. That is inspiring.USA born dancer Mark Platt was a Ballet Russe dancer star, and he is interviewed. He is age 89 in the documentary.He danced at age 41 in 1954 in ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (MGM) movie dance musical starring Howard Keel and Jane Powell.In that 1954 movie, Mark Platt played ""Brother Daniel Pontepee."" He is now 98 years (in 2012) and still living.He provides wonderful and extended interview talk during the documentary titled ""Ballet Russe"" (2004) which shows movie clips of Platt dancing in less well known, but still well done MGM musical dance movies from the 1940's and 1950's, and also shows Platt acting at age 89 in a stage production located in the Marin County, California theater center (San Francisco, Calif. suburban area).Platt was hired for the Ballet Russe company in the late 1930's by Leonoid Massine (who was a ballet star in ""The Red Shoes"" in 1948....he played the cobbler who creates the Red Shoes in which Moira Shearer dances, dances, dances until both she and Red Shoes ballet ends in tragedy. ""The Red Shoes"" 1948 movie is probably the most famous and best ballet movie in all movie history.).Massine directed the Ballet Russe dance company from the early 1930's through the early 1940's.Mark Platt was lead dancer in at least one major Massine choreographed ballet, presented around 1937.His part of the documentary is especially interesting and important to USA movie dance musical history enthusiasts like me.He was 41 when he danced and acted in ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (1954), and was by far the ""oldest brother"" in that movie, otherwise made up of men in their 20's and teens (the 5 male dancers who portrayed ""brothers"" who married the 7 brides).See the ""Ballet Russe"" (2004) documentary about the Ballet Russe dance company founded during the WWI era and not disbanded until 1962. Mark Platt was a member of the Ballet Russe in the 1930's and possibly in the 1940's before his MGM movie dancer/ actor contract days.The documentary shows a wonderful reunion of very old Ballet Russe dancers held in 2000, with many dancers interviewed and movie footage of their dancing during their ballet dancer days half a century and more earlier.--------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG movie actor.",5,"""Ballet Russes"" (2005) is one of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen...it is a treasure.

Such is the case with BALLET RUSSES.  This tender, touching, humorous, and exactingly real look at the history of ballet in the hands of the expatriated Russians in Europe in the early part of the 20th century to the reformation of the troop after the death in 1929 by master Impresario Diaghilev  unfolds through the words and movements of those who experienced it.To say too much about the content would be like telling each member of a conversation group the essence before the topic unfolds.  Suffice it to say that here are the dancers, choreographers, composers, artists creating the sets and costumes who produced the contemporary standard for ballet that still exist today.  To have the joy of watching Massine, Balanchine, Lichine, Markova, Krassovska, Danilova, Riabouchinska, Platt, Zoritch, Franklin and the designs of Picasso, Dali, Laurencin, etc is more than a visual treat: it is a step into a history of creativity the likes of which we may never see again.The real joy of this rich film is the conversations and, yes, dance movements of the surviving members of this troop and those who admired it.

I fell in hook, line and sinker the minute the narrator, Marian Seldes, opened her mouth I fell in.  And I don't even know much about ballet, though everyone has heard something about Nijinsky and Diaghilev, which is where Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine begin their story.  It's a leisurely movie and, at 110 minutes, sort of on the long side, but its expert editing makes it a ride worth considering.  I'd go anywhere to see Nathaniel Dorsky's work, and maybe I'm imaging things but either he was in charge of the introduction to Nina Novak, or else the directors found another editor with the meringue-light ""Dorsky touch.""Ballet must be a wonderful energizer, how else is it that so many of the film's principal characters are over 80 and apparently spry as spring chickens?  I suppose that some of the principals died young, but there are no Tanaquil Le Clercq stories here, and half of the fun is seeing the people old then being flashed back to their youthful selves, so filled with manic energy, back and forth, back and forth, until one feels oscillated through time and space; by the end of the movie you feel you've known these people all your life, and the title card at the end that reveals that five of them died during the making of the picture is like a little stab in your heart.  Among them, of course, was Dame Alicia Markova, the only one among them who had actually lived long enough to have served under the Diaghilev regime.  The heart and soul of the picture is the happily acerbic Frederic Franklin, who puts everyone down with a charming simper.  Indonesian-born Nini Theilade, so gorgeous in Max Reinhardt's A MIDSUMMERS NIGHT DREAM (1935), still looks enchanting enough to make men mad.The clips are amazing, the supertitles unobtrusive (and yet stylish if that's not an oxymoron), perfectly chosen to make whatever point Geller and Goldfayne feel like making.  I did feel they must have been simplifying one or two points in Ballet Russes chronology, but it's a tangled tale they do their best to smooth out.  Time has obscured the legacy of the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo, and the movie's comical ending makes it seem as though Batgirl's leaps and jumps in the 60s TV version of Batman, and the porn films of Wakefield Poole (BOYS IN THE SAND) are the leading examples of that legacy, but anyone who has been lucky enough to see this outstanding documentary will tell a different tale.

A few years later, I rented it again and enjoyed it just as much.In any case, the film follows the fate of the two Ballets Russes after the Diaghilev era [ post 1930 ] and features interviews with two of Balanchine's baby ballerinas, in addition to other marvelous dancers, Russian, English and American, who danced with both companies from the glorious opening of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, to the lean war, and post-war years.The filmmakers do an amazing job chronicling everything from the business decisions, choreography, and talent that went into keeping Diaghilev's innovative ballets, sets, costumes, and dances alive. Those ballets were brought to the public in both small towns and large cities across North and South America, and Australia, setting off interest in a public which had never seen ballet, which in turn led to the opening of ballet schools across those three  continents. The interviews with the then living dancers, all in their 80's and 90's--who had huge and delightful personalities, and weren't afraid to gossip, are so insightful and brilliant.The film offers a marvelous history of the era, the company, and innovative dance in the 20th century.

To clarify, the DVD is about two companies: the ""Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo"" and the so-called ""Original Ballet Russe"" company, both of which split off from the _real_ original Ballet Russe - which as all of you know was the company of Najinsky etc. - after 1929.Everything about this DVD is first-class. The archival footage is very clean. The narration clarified many points of history about which I was very confused, including how George Balanchine bounced around like a pinball from place to place during those early years. Best of all was the contemporary footage and oral history interviews of company members. I could hardly believe how many dancers from the two companies are still around in the 21st century! We're talking WWII-era here. If this were Japan, we would declare them National Treasures. Many of them in their 80s, they are still vital and active in teaching, and in at least one case, performing! And they are still such lovely people that my heart just went out to them.The DVD cover includes a url for more information: [...]; do check it out, and I hope you like it as much as I did!",5,For Every Ballet Fan,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1282,"['absolutely', 'delightful', 'DVD', 'narration', 'archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'original', 'members', 'companies', 'produce', 'very', 'engaging', 'history', 'clarify', 'DVD', 'two', 'companies', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'so-called', 'Original', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'company', 'split', 'off', '_real_', 'original', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'know', 'was', 'company', 'Najinsky', 'etc', '1929.Everything', 'DVD', 'first-class', 'archival', 'footage', 'very', 'clean', 'narration', 'clarified', 'many', 'points', 'history', 'was', 'very', 'confused', 'including', 'how', 'George', 'Balanchine', 'bounced', 'pinball', 'place', 'place', 'early', 'years', 'Best', 'was', 'contemporary', 'footage', 'oral', 'history', 'interviews', 'company', 'members', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'dancers', 'two', 'companies', 'are', 'still', '21st', 'century', ""'re"", 'talking', 'WWII-era', 'here', 'were', 'Japan', 'would', 'declare', 'National', 'Treasures', 'Many', '80s', 'are', 'still', 'vital', 'active', 'teaching', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'performing', 'are', 'still', 'such', 'lovely', 'people', 'heart', 'just', 'went', 'out', 'them.The', 'DVD', 'cover', 'url', 'more', 'information', '[', ']', 'do', 'check', 'out', 'hope', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Ballets Russes

Donnelly ""Opera lover""","[2, 2]","My review of Gaite Parisienne states the time and place when I was lucky enough to attend live performances of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. I say ""lucky enough"" because the company consisted of performers that have become legends in the classical dance world. I wish I could name them all but I'll never forget Alicia Alonso, Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova, Leonide Massine, Frederic Franklin and Igor Youskevich for starters. This DVD brings it all back in detail. Wonderful! I remember when Alicia Alonso went back to Cuba and was never to perform in the U.S.A. again. What a loss for the world of dance. But since that time we have continued to see much of her influence in the Cuban-born dancers who have joined, and are performing with, companies such as the American Ballet Theater. Madame Alonso's school in Cuba has given the world some great male dancers, in particular, who can be compared with the greatest Russian-born dancers on an equal basis. There was a time when good male dancers were in short supply and their purpose was mainly to lend support to the ballerinas. Let me not forget the dance prodigals produced by the school that Igor Youskevich established in New York - I think on Long Island. Most of today's great dancers have been trained using the foundation learned from the Ballet Russes' legendary dancers. They showed audiences what brilliant dancing and choreography could be and left everyone wanting more.Buy this DVD if you truly would like to learn about greatness, egos, sacrifices for the love art. And the art of dance is precisely what they brought to the world of dance and the audiences who were lucky enough to have experienced their performances.",5,B rilliant with a Big Wow Factor!,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1696,"['review', 'Gaite', 'Parisienne', 'time', 'place', 'when', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'attend', 'live', 'performances', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'say', 'lucky', 'enough', 'company', 'consisted', 'performers', 'have', 'become', 'legends', 'classical', 'dance', 'world', 'wish', 'could', 'name', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Alicia', 'Alonso', 'Alicia', 'Markova', 'Alexandra', 'Danilova', 'Leonide', 'Massine', 'Frederic', 'Franklin', 'Igor', 'Youskevich', 'starters', 'DVD', 'back', 'detail', 'Wonderful', 'remember', 'when', 'Alicia', 'Alonso', 'went', 'back', 'Cuba', 'was', 'never', 'perform', 'U.S.A.', 'again', 'What', 'loss', 'world', 'dance', 'time', 'have', 'continued', 'see', 'much', 'influence', 'Cuban-born', 'dancers', 'who', 'have', 'joined', 'are', 'performing', 'companies', 'such', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theater', 'Madame', 'Alonso', 'school', 'Cuba', 'given', 'world', 'great', 'male', 'dancers', 'particular', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'greatest', 'Russian-born', 'dancers', 'equal', 'basis', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'good', 'male', 'dancers', 'were', 'short', 'supply', 'purpose', 'was', 'mainly', 'lend', 'support', 'ballerinas', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'dance', 'prodigals', 'produced', 'school', 'Igor', 'Youskevich', 'established', 'New', 'York', 'think', 'Long', 'Island', 'Most', 'today', 'great', 'dancers', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'using', 'foundation', 'learned', 'Ballet', 'Russes', 'legendary', 'dancers', 'showed', 'audiences', 'what', 'brilliant', 'dancing', 'choreography', 'could', 'be', 'left', 'everyone', 'wanting', 'more.Buy', 'DVD', 'truly', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'greatness', 'egos', 'sacrifices', 'love', 'art', 'art', 'dance', 'precisely', 'what', 'brought', 'world', 'dance', 'audiences', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'experienced', 'performances']",Ballets Russes
998810,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000G5SIBM,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","""Ballets Russes"" is a wonderful documentary about one of the great dance companies of the 20th Century.  Though the Ballets Russes was originally created in Paris by impresario  Serge Diaghilev in 1909, it is with its later, post-Diaghilev incarnation, starting in the late 1920's, that the film is primarily concerned.  It was at that time that choreographer George Balanchine took a chance by hiring a group of unknown Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s as dancers for the company.  Through touring that took them to virtually all corners of the globe, the group would quickly achieve renown as the premier ballet company in the world - though, technically, there were actually TWO Ballet Russes companies, both splintered off from the original, that spent a number of decades battling one another for supremacy.  That may be a bit of a rude awakening for those who believe ballet to be all namby-pamby sweetness-and-light, but there's a ruthless, cutthroat, business side to it all as well, and the film does a good job capturing it.Let me say right up front that one does not need to know a single thing about ballet to be able to appreciate this film (I`m a prime example of that).  What holds the viewer's interest is not merely the beauty of the dances, but the warmhearted reminiscences of many of the premier ballerinas themselves as they reflect back poignantly on their illustrious careers.  With many of them now in their 80's and 90's, they may be long past their physical primes, but their inner grace, humor and sensitivity shine forth as brilliantly as ever.  It is a true joy listening to them recounting their experiences, while at the same time getting to watch them in old film clips performing at the height of their artistry.Moreover, the film provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the short but glorious history of the Ballets Russes itself.  We come to see how it evolved to fit the times, how it raised public awareness for the art form, and how it almost single-handedly made ballet an integral part of American culture.  And as mentioned earlier, there's a great deal of drama to be found in the backstage wrangling among the various directors that ultimately ended up in the Ballets Russes breaking apart into rival companies, both of which enjoyed varying levels of success, and both of which, perhaps inevitably, closed their doors for good on the cusp of the modernistic 1960's.Thanks to its one-on-one interviews with many of the dancers who made the companies great, the movie becomes a veritable treasure trove of priceless recollections and memories, and I`m glad that directors Daniel Geller and Dayna Goldfine were able to put a record of them on film before their stories disappeared forever (several of the dancers have died just since providing the interviews we see them giving here).  Had the filmmakers delayed tackling this project, this movie might not have been made at all.  What a loss to us all that would have been!",4,a great documentary,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2976,"['Ballets', 'Russes', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'one', 'great', 'dance', 'companies', '20th', 'Century', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'was', 'originally', 'created', 'Paris', 'impresario', 'Serge', 'Diaghilev', '1909', 'later', 'post-Diaghilev', 'incarnation', 'starting', 'late', '1920', 'film', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'was', 'time', 'choreographer', 'George', 'Balanchine', 'took', 'chance', 'hiring', 'group', 'unknown', 'Russian', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'dancers', 'company', 'touring', 'took', 'virtually', 'corners', 'globe', 'group', 'would', 'quickly', 'achieve', 'renown', 'premier', 'ballet', 'company', 'world', 'technically', 'were', 'actually', 'TWO', 'Ballet', 'Russes', 'companies', 'splintered', 'off', 'original', 'spent', 'number', 'decades', 'battling', 'one', 'supremacy', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'rude', 'awakening', 'who', 'believe', 'ballet', 'be', 'namby-pamby', 'sweetness-and-light', 'ruthless', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'it.Let', 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'one', 'not', 'need', 'know', 'single', 'thing', 'ballet', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'm', 'prime', 'example', 'What', 'viewer', 'interest', 'not', 'merely', 'beauty', 'dances', 'warmhearted', 'reminiscences', 'many', 'premier', 'ballerinas', 'reflect', 'back', 'poignantly', 'illustrious', 'careers', 'many', 'now', '80', '90', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'physical', 'primes', 'inner', 'grace', 'humor', 'sensitivity', 'shine', 'forth', 'as', 'brilliantly', 'ever', 'true', 'joy', 'listening', 'recounting', 'experiences', 'same', 'time', 'getting', 'watch', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'performing', 'height', 'artistry.Moreover', 'film', 'fascinating', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glimpse', 'short', 'glorious', 'history', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'come', 'see', 'how', 'evolved', 'fit', 'times', 'how', 'raised', 'public', 'awareness', 'art', 'form', 'how', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'made', 'ballet', 'integral', 'part', 'American', 'culture', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'great', 'deal', 'drama', 'be', 'found', 'backstage', 'wrangling', 'various', 'directors', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'Ballets', 'Russes', 'breaking', 'apart', 'rival', 'companies', 'enjoyed', 'varying', 'levels', 'success', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'closed', 'doors', 'good', 'cusp', 'modernistic', ""1960's.Thanks"", 'one-on-one', 'interviews', 'many', 'dancers', 'who', 'made', 'companies', 'great', 'movie', 'veritable', 'treasure', 'trove', 'priceless', 'recollections', 'memories', 'm', 'glad', 'directors', 'Daniel', 'Geller', 'Dayna', 'Goldfine', 'were', 'able', 'put', 'record', 'film', 'stories', 'disappeared', 'forever', 'several', 'dancers', 'have', 'died', 'just', 'providing', 'interviews', 'see', 'giving', 'here', 'Had', 'filmmakers', 'delayed', 'tackling', 'project', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'What', 'loss', 'would', 'have', 'been']",Ballets Russes
998811,A387BD735MI50R,B000G5SIBM,R. Schultz,"[7, 7]","I don't generally take much interest in ballet, but I still found this DVD to be absorbing. A ""jete"" is a leap with one foot extended forward, and one foot extended back. And that's just the sort of spanning arc this movie makes. It starts with the formal founding of the Ballet Russe in Monte Carlo in the 1930's, goes through the period when two competing versions of the Ballet Russe existed (thus the plural of this documentary's title), and catches up with the current lives of a number of the Ballet's early dancers.Some vintage footage of these early dancers is included, some of it even in color. But the fascination here is the dancers themselves, even more than the dance. We see them as young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, just children, recruited by Diaghilev in the 30's. Then we see them being interviewed in 2000-2003 for this documentary and we are given a sense of the texture of a lifetime devoted to the art of dance.The DVD is very generous with its captioning. Everyone is labeled in each dance sequence, and then re-captioned for every current interview, so you can easily keep track of who's who, before-and-after.It's all a very good advertisement for the practice of ballet and might inspire you to take lessons yourself, because you will see how a majority of the early Ballet Russe dancers are still around in good health, and are still active in ballet, mostly as teachers. One of the dancers was actually still performing ""character"" roles on stage at the time of the interviews.However, one gets a sense that starring ballet dancers of the 30's and 40's might have been subject to fewer grueling demands than modern dancers. Back then, dancers were perhaps expected to be human perfections of grace, but not superhuman specimens. So there is no discussion here of crippling injuries, of arthritis in the wake of years of command contortion, of struggles to keep reed-thin, of any of the health problems that are whispered about among modern dancers. That's the only major flaw I found in this documentary. These dancers might have been in a unique position to compare training and practice regimens then-and-now, and to give any necessary critiques of modern expectation. But you won't find any such discussion on this DVD.However the DVD extras do include a lot of behind-the-scenes gossip and do let us get better acquainted with all the featured players. One of the most memorable is Nathalie Krassovska, who unblinkingly, with a dreamy dramatization of each sentence, focuses off beyond the floodlights - still playing to the balconies.",4,This DVD does a Gran Jete,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2571,"['do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'take', 'much', 'interest', 'ballet', 'still', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'absorbing', 'jete', 'leap', 'one', 'foot', 'extended', 'forward', 'one', 'foot', 'extended', 'back', 'just', 'sort', 'spanning', 'arc', 'movie', 'formal', 'founding', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Monte', 'Carlo', '1930', 'period', 'when', 'two', 'competing', 'versions', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'existed', 'thus', 'plural', 'documentary', 'title', 'up', 'current', 'lives', 'number', 'Ballet', 'early', 'dancers.Some', 'vintage', 'footage', 'early', 'dancers', 'included', 'even', 'color', 'fascination', 'here', 'dancers', 'even', 'more', 'dance', 'see', 'young', 'Russian', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'just', 'children', 'recruited', 'Diaghilev', '30', 'Then', 'see', 'being', 'interviewed', '2000-2003', 'documentary', 'are', 'given', 'sense', 'texture', 'lifetime', 'devoted', 'art', 'dance.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'generous', 'captioning', 'Everyone', 'labeled', 'dance', 'sequence', 'then', 're-captioned', 'current', 'interview', 'can', 'easily', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'before-and-after.It', 'very', 'good', 'advertisement', 'practice', 'ballet', 'might', 'inspire', 'take', 'lessons', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'majority', 'early', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'dancers', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'health', 'are', 'still', 'active', 'ballet', 'mostly', 'teachers', 'One', 'dancers', 'was', 'actually', 'still', 'performing', 'character', 'roles', 'stage', 'time', 'interviews.However', 'one', 'sense', 'starring', 'ballet', 'dancers', '30', '40', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'fewer', 'grueling', 'demands', 'modern', 'dancers', 'Back', 'then', 'dancers', 'were', 'perhaps', 'expected', 'be', 'human', 'perfections', 'grace', 'not', 'superhuman', 'specimens', 'So', 'discussion', 'here', 'crippling', 'injuries', 'arthritis', 'wake', 'years', 'command', 'contortion', 'struggles', 'keep', 'reed-thin', 'health', 'problems', 'are', 'whispered', 'modern', 'dancers', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'found', 'documentary', 'dancers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'unique', 'position', 'compare', 'training', 'practice', 'regimens', 'then-and-now', 'give', 'necessary', 'critiques', 'modern', 'expectation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'such', 'discussion', 'DVD.However', 'DVD', 'extras', 'do', 'include', 'lot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'gossip', 'do', 'let', 'get', 'better', 'acquainted', 'featured', 'players', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'Nathalie', 'Krassovska', 'who', 'unblinkingly', 'dreamy', 'dramatization', 'sentence', 'floodlights', 'still', 'playing', 'balconies']",Ballets Russes
