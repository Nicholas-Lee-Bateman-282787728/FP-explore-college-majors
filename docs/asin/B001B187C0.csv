Joe Friday), ADAM-12 chronicled in striking detail and accuracy events from real LAPD cases.The show presented actual department-issue badges, vehicles and Los Angeles Police stations, and its compelling realism gave the program a 7-year run on NBC from 1968 to 1975.

I cannot believe the first season did not sell well enough to release the rest of the series. Shout Factory is becoming a favorite company of mine. They have also had some releases of Ozzie & Harriet(my favoriet sitcom ever!). I also hope to see them pick up the rights to Dragnet and release the rest of that series. It is also time for Emergency to have another release. Finally, I would love to see the rest of T.J.

1169869,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B001B187C0,William Smith,"[3, 3]","I suppose I could start off with the bad news.. Now I know this is 1969 and TV was a bit different in this era but I must say, the casting of many of the people Jim and Pete interact with are simply not credible. Thats a nice way to say; they can't act... however they can OVER act, and do it well. The same went for the first season which seemed a bit worse in this regard and I so hoped season 2 would be different but alas it isn't.Now since I've got that off my chest let me just say I love these guys! The two leads in character, Jim Reed and Pete Malloy just gel. They just do. I LOVE to hear the banter of married life versus bachelorhood and the various other topics they square off about. I love Malloys no nonsense demeanor and Reeds (seemingly!) cool collected innocence (see; Baby!). I really like how the show has some loose threads going that get picked up and dropped from time to time, shows a real forward thinking in the writing department.All in all, SHOUT! Factory is to be given major props for just getting this great show out the door, nevermind that transfers are BRILLIANT and while the extras are a bit tepid, they are there for a rainy day when Season Three is still on the drawing board... throw in handsome artwork and a meager price tag and you have a winner. And praise be NO FLIPPER discs! No not the dolphin, the discs that Universal thrust upon so many ruined boxsets (Dragnet, Quincy, A Team..)I don't know if anyone else noticed this but in the episode A Sound Like Thunder, blondie Pete Malloy is wearing a decidedly GOLD shirt, and black haired Reed is wearing a strikingly Blue shirt. Know of any other 1969 duo who matches those exact colors and descriptions? I'll let the jury decide that:)",4,Makes me want to SHOUT!,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,1731,"['suppose', 'could', 'start', 'off', 'bad', 'news..', 'Now', 'know', '1969', 'TV', 'was', 'bit', 'different', 'era', 'must', 'say', 'casting', 'many', 'people', 'Jim', 'Pete', 'interact', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'credible', 'Thats', 'nice', 'way', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'however', 'can', 'OVER', 'act', 'do', 'well', 'same', 'went', 'first', 'season', 'seemed', 'bit', 'worse', 'regard', 'so', 'hoped', 'season', '2', 'would', 'be', 'different', ""isn't.Now"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'chest', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'love', 'guys', 'two', 'leads', 'character', 'Jim', 'Reed', 'Pete', 'Malloy', 'just', 'gel', 'just', 'do', 'LOVE', 'hear', 'banter', 'married', 'life', 'versus', 'bachelorhood', 'various', 'other', 'topics', 'square', 'love', 'Malloys', 'nonsense', 'demeanor', 'Reeds', 'seemingly', 'cool', 'collected', 'innocence', 'see', 'Baby', 'really', 'how', 'show', 'loose', 'threads', 'going', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'dropped', 'time', 'time', 'real', 'forward', 'thinking', 'writing', 'department.All', 'SHOUT', 'Factory', 'be', 'given', 'major', 'props', 'just', 'getting', 'great', 'show', 'door', 'transfers', 'are', 'BRILLIANT', 'extras', 'are', 'bit', 'tepid', 'are', 'there', 'rainy', 'day', 'when', 'Season', 'Three', 'still', 'drawing', 'board', 'throw', 'handsome', 'artwork', 'meager', 'price', 'tag', 'have', 'winner', 'praise', 'be', 'NO', 'FLIPPER', 'discs', 'No', 'not', 'dolphin', 'discs', 'Universal', 'so', 'many', 'ruined', 'boxsets', 'Dragnet', 'Quincy', 'A', 'Team..', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'episode', 'Sound', 'Thunder', 'blondie', 'Pete', 'Malloy', 'wearing', 'decidedly', 'GOLD', 'shirt', 'black', 'haired', 'Reed', 'wearing', 'strikingly', 'Blue', 'shirt', 'Know', 'other', '1969', 'duo', 'who', 'exact', 'colors', 'descriptions', ""'ll"", 'let', 'jury', 'decide']",Adam-12: Season 2
