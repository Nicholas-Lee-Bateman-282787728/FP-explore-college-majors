886339,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007PAM06,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[6, 8]","Initially aired following the 1997 Super Bowl, King of the Hill discovered an instant audience niche that has the followed the show loyally ever since. The brainchild of Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge (also known for the hit movie Office Space), King of the Hill is a unique animated series in that it doesn't rely on ""cartoon"" suspension of reality or outlandish antics. In fact, the show would arguably be just as successful if it were not animated at all. Nevertheless, it's Mike Judge (voice of Hank Hill) and his unique brand of humor that make King of the Hill a must-see TV series...Set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, King of the Hill follows the life and exploits of Hank Hill and his traditional nuclear family. Hank is a red-state propane salesman who loves beer and apple pie, but he's constantly inundated with modern liberalism and grapples with the demands of political correctness. Hank is joined by his wife Peggy (a substitute teacher), his son Bobby (an awkward pre-pubescent youth), and a trailer park-like live-in niece named Luanne... Providing added comic relief to the series are Hank's off-the-wall friends Bill, Boomhauer (who is inaudible), and Dale (who believes everything is a government conspiracy)... Hank's Laotian neighbor Kahn (whose daughter Bobby is quite fond of) and his family live next door, providing Hank with a continuing dose of culture shock...The King of the Hill (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Peggy Hill: The Decline and Fall"" in which Peggy survives falling out of an airplane, but is nevertheless left in a full body cast. Meanwhile, Cotton and Didi have a baby, but rather than care for the child themselves, they push the task onto Bobby... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Bills are Made to be Broken"" in which Hank convinces the local high school football coach to let Bill play one more game so that he can get back his old school record for touchdowns, and ""Naked Ambition"" in which Bobby accidentally sees Luanne naked, causing Joseph to eagerly seek his own peek...Below is a list of episodes included on the King of the Hill (Season 4) DVD:Episode 61 (Peggy Hill: The Decline and Fall)Episode 62 (Cotton's Plan)Episode 63 (Bills are Made to be Broken)Episode 64 (Little Horrors of Shop)Episode 65 (Aisle 8A)Episode 66 (A Beer Can Named Desire)Episode 67 (The Hank's Giving Episode)Episode 68 (Not in My Back Hoe)Episode 69 (To Kill a Ladybird)Episode 70 (Hillennium)Episode 71 (Old Glory)Episode 72 (Rodeo Days)Episode 73 (Hanky Panky)Episode 74 (High Anxiety)Episode 75 (Naked Ambition)Episode 76 (Movin' On Up)Episode 77 (Bill of Sales)Episode 78 (Won't You Pimai Neighbor?)Episode 79 (Hank's Bad Hair Day)Episode 80 (Meet the Propaniacs)Episode 81 (Nancy Boys)Episode 82 (Flush with Power)Episode 83 (Transnational Amusements Present: Peggy's Magic Sex Feet)Episode 84 (Peggy's Fan Fair)The DVD Report",5,Animated blue collar TV...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2947,"['Initially', 'aired', 'following', '1997', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'King', 'Hill', 'discovered', 'instant', 'audience', 'niche', 'followed', 'show', 'loyally', 'ever', 'brainchild', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'creator', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'also', 'known', 'hit', 'movie', 'Office', 'Space', 'King', 'Hill', 'unique', 'animated', 'series', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cartoon', 'suspension', 'reality', 'outlandish', 'antics', 'fact', 'show', 'would', 'arguably', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'successful', 'were', 'not', 'animated', 'Nevertheless', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'voice', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'make', 'King', 'Hill', 'must-see', 'TV', 'series', 'Set', 'fictional', 'town', 'Arlen', 'Texas', 'King', 'Hill', 'life', 'exploits', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'family', 'Hank', 'red-state', 'propane', 'salesman', 'who', 'beer', 'apple', 'pie', 'constantly', 'inundated', 'modern', 'liberalism', 'grapples', 'demands', 'political', 'correctness', 'Hank', 'joined', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'son', 'Bobby', 'awkward', 'pre-pubescent', 'youth', 'trailer', 'park-like', 'live-in', 'niece', 'named', 'Luanne', 'Providing', 'added', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'are', 'Hank', 'off-the-wall', 'friends', 'Bill', 'Boomhauer', 'who', 'inaudible', 'Dale', 'who', 'everything', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'Hank', 'Laotian', 'neighbor', 'Kahn', 'daughter', 'Bobby', 'quite', 'fond', 'family', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'providing', 'Hank', 'continuing', 'dose', 'culture', 'shock', 'King', 'Hill', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Peggy', 'Hill', 'Decline', 'Fall', 'Peggy', 'falling', 'airplane', 'nevertheless', 'left', 'full', 'body', 'cast', 'Meanwhile', 'Cotton', 'Didi', 'have', 'baby', 'rather', 'care', 'child', 'push', 'task', 'Bobby', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Bills', 'are', 'Made', 'be', 'Broken', 'Hank', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'let', 'Bill', 'play', 'one', 'more', 'game', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'old', 'school', 'record', 'touchdowns', 'Naked', 'Ambition', 'Bobby', 'accidentally', 'Luanne', 'naked', 'causing', 'Joseph', 'eagerly', 'seek', 'own', 'peek', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'King', 'Hill', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '61', 'Peggy', 'Hill', 'Decline', 'Fall', 'Episode', '62', 'Cotton', 'Plan', 'Episode', '63', 'Bills', 'are', 'Made', 'be', 'Broken', 'Episode', '64', 'Little', 'Horrors', 'Shop', 'Episode', '65', 'Aisle', '8A', 'Episode', '66', 'Beer', 'Can', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Episode', '67', 'Hank', 'Giving', 'Episode', 'Episode', '68', 'Not', 'My', 'Back', 'Hoe', 'Episode', '69', 'Kill', 'Ladybird', 'Episode', '70', 'Hillennium', 'Episode', '71', 'Old', 'Glory', 'Episode', '72', 'Rodeo', 'Days', 'Episode', '73', 'Hanky', 'Panky', 'Episode', '74', 'High', 'Anxiety', 'Episode', '75', 'Naked', 'Ambition', 'Episode', '76', 'Movin', 'Episode', '77', 'Bill', 'Sales', 'Episode', '78', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Pimai', 'Neighbor', 'Episode', '79', 'Hank', 'Bad', 'Hair', 'Day', 'Episode', '80', 'Meet', 'Propaniacs', 'Episode', '81', 'Nancy', 'Boys', 'Episode', '82', 'Flush', 'Power', 'Episode', '83', 'Transnational', 'Amusements', 'Present', 'Peggy', 'Magic', 'Sex', 'Feet', 'Episode', '84', 'Peggy', 'Fan', 'Fair', 'DVD', 'Report']",King of the Hill - The Complete Fourth Season

If you remember the neighbor Mr Anderson from B&B, you will recognize his voice as that of one Hank Hill, an old- school Texan with a trio of wacky friends, a wife that is at times terribly old fashioned and at others way ahead of the game, and a young son named Bobby ( my friends and I have a running argument if Bobby is gay or not). Wife Peggy's young niece has moved in - her mother has been jailed, if I'm not mistaken - and she has a hilarious accent. We play a drinking game where we take a shot every time she calls Hank ""Unka Haaaaank.""  This is one incredibly funny show, one of the maybe five that I make time to watch. Buy the dvd, you won't have to suffer the commercials. By season four, the jokes are still as funny, the characters are still as radical ( Hank's father ""Cotton"" has to be seen to be believed ) and the premise is still as fresh.

The fourth season has some of my favorite moments from KOTH. Cotton's horror as he finds out that his newborn son is leaking milk, Connie having her period while staying with the Hills, Hank's thanksgiving turkey being destroyed by a bomb squaud at the airport, Peggy's feet being featured on a foot fetish website, Bobby seeing his female cousin naked for the first time, and the whodunnit murder of a very minor character voiced by Reese Witherspoon. These episodes are great without question but what is up with the special features department?  The first two seasons had it all, comentaries, animatics, deleted scences, easter eggs, the whole shebang. But when I purchased the third season it was as if they put the release together the night before it came out. There were absolutley no special features, nada, zilch, zip. The discs were the double sided kind, and the artwork on the packaging sucked. It took only a few months between the first and second releases and we got two awesome sets, but it took another year before the third season was released and we got stiffed big time. But now it is time for season four to be released and I'm getting worried that it will be a repeat of the rush-job we got for season three. I already know it is going to be 3 double-sided discs and it is coming out only 4 months after the previous release. I just hope Fox doesn't do this half-assed.

886349,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B0007PAM06,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[10, 10]","Whew!  From some rumors I heard, I was afraid season four of King of the Hill would not be released on DVD.  What a relief to see it on my Amazon home page with its cool cover (a great improvement from previous covers; especially season three-who wants to see Hank, Bill, Boomhauer, and Dale's bulging bellies?).  It looks like the powers-that-be for KOTH are also making up for lost time by releasing season four much more quickly than prior seasons.  Of course, season 3 was released way behind schedule (I think about 6 months later than advertised!) so KOTH fans are due!  The main reason I am looking forward to this release so much is for my second favorite KOTH episode of all-time right behind (so to speak) Hank's Unmentionable Problem from season one; a.k.a. the constipation episode.  It is Flushed With Power.  In this show, the residents of Arlen are frustrated by the restricted water usage caused by a draught.  New low flow toilets are supposed to be the answer, but Hank discovers they actually use more water because they require more flushes to ""thoroughly dispose of solid waste"" (in Peggy's case, six flushes).  What follows is so much like the absurd reality of life it is brilliant.  I sell paint in California for a living and it is a similar situation.  We know a product is better but we cannot sell it due to govt. regulations.  When Hank goes to the home improvement store and asks the clerk if they ""have any of the good toilets?"" and the older and wiser clerk replies, ""Nope, we don't offer the good toilets, only the low flows, and even if I had a good toilet, it is illegal to sell it in this county,"" it hits hilariously close to home.Season four also moves KOTH into some serious territory. In the two-parter Hanky Panky/High Anxiety, Hank's boss Buck Strickland finds himself in some heavy trouble when he is kicked out of the house by his wife who is finally fed up with his cheating and then his mistress is found dead.  Hank is dragged into Buck's sordid life style.  For an animated comedy series, these episodes are pretty heavy.  The first two-parter Peggy Hill The Decline and Fall/Cotton's Plot that continues the cliff hanger from season three where Peggy's parachute fails while sky diving is also pretty intense.  The always over-confident Peggy thinks her rehab after spending time in a body cast will be a snap, but then she finds she is too weak to accomplish the easiest of tasks.  She needs motivation and requests the services of her father-in-law: the misogynist, drill sergeant Cotton.  Seeing her suffer as Cotton ridicules her is a  little difficult to watch (even though I am not fond of the conceited Peggy).  Her respect for Cotton is challenged when she discovers he has been lying about his war record.  Hank then explains why he still respects his father even though he is a cruel son-of-a-gun.  It is an interesting episode.Other episodes include the following:Bills are Made to be Broken: Bill doesn't have much, but he does hold the Arlen High football record for TDs in a season which is close to being broken.Little Horrors of Shop: Hank is laid off and becomes a substitute shop teacher at Bobby's school.  Will his popularity challenge Peggy's streak of Substitute of the Year trophies?Aisle 8A: Connie stays at the Hills while her parents are away and males Hank confront some, well, feminine issues.A Beer Can Named Desire:  Hank can win a million dollars if can throw a football through a hole in a giant novelty beer can.  He is torn between making the throw himself or choosing former NFL quarterback Don Meredith to do it for him.  Meanwhile, The Hills and Bill stop at the Dauterive manor in New Orleans where Bill has a chance to get lucky with his, um, cousins and Bobby chooses [again] the wrong role model in the eyes of Hank.  Great line: ""I need a window seat because this flower is wilting.""The Hank's Giving Episode: The Hills and their neighbors become stranded at the airport.  Highlight: Hank's prized turkey is taken for a bomb by airport security.Not in My Back Hoe: Hank makes friends with a guy who shares a lot of his interests, habits, and moods [Drew Carey]  much to the chagrin of Bill and Dale.To Kill a Ladybird: Bobby finds a new friend in a raccoon he names ""Bandit.""Hillennium: Great episode!  Hank is as paranoid about Y2K as Dale.  Unwilling to move into the New Millennium (well, actually 2001 marked the new millennium), Hank freaks out buying toilet paper and a grandfather clock to avoid the technological holocaust to come.  His dream of being a mole in a mole-whacker where he gets advice from Tom Landry is brilliant..Old Glory: Peggy and Bobby find themselves in a heap of trouble at school involving plagiarism and the destruction of Bill's prized American flag.

I love the ending to this one.Hank's Bad Hair Day:  Hank's long-time barber has gone completely senile and, reluctantly, Hank allows friend and Army barber Bill to cut his hair.  All's well until he receives the govt-issued bill.Meet the Propaniacs:  Bobby encourages Strickland Propane to start a propane-related comedy act to promote its business.Nancy Boys:  Continuing the storyline Peggy's Headache from season three, Nancy starts to confront her affair with John Redcorn.Transnational Amusements Presents: Peggy's Magic Sex Feet:  Well, Peggy's big feet must be good for something!Peggy's Fan Fair:  Peggy insists Randy Travis stole her song ""That's the Way God Made Me"" and the story that went with it.

This set contains some of my all-time favorite episodes, like the two part episode titled Hanky Panky, which included guest voices of Kathleen Turner and Reese Witherspoon. I could'nt stop from laughing when Hank had his first phone-sex conversation and he actually felt dirty! I just could'nt take it when Mrs. Strickland made Hank where those short shorts as part of his Manager uniform and the guys in the office called him a boytoy!!! Naturally Peggy gets even more full of herself and you just can't help loving her for being such an overachiever know-it-all! The Country Fanfair episode that included Randy Travis is just hilarious!!!Eventhough Peggy got on everybody's nerves during the bus trip, Hank continued to encourage his wife's obnoxious behavior, now who would'nt want to marry a great guy like Hank Hill!!!!!",5,"I'D MARRY A MAN LIKE HANK HILL, I TELL YOU WHAT!!!",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,926,"['Needless', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'adding', 'season', '4', 'King', 'Hill', 'collection', 'set', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'titled', 'Hanky', 'Panky', 'included', 'guest', 'voices', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', ""could'nt"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'when', 'Hank', 'had', 'first', 'phone-sex', 'conversation', 'actually', 'felt', 'dirty', 'just', ""could'nt"", 'take', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Strickland', 'made', 'Hank', 'where', 'short', 'shorts', 'part', 'Manager', 'uniform', 'guys', 'office', 'called', 'boytoy', 'Naturally', 'Peggy', 'even', 'more', 'full', 'herself', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'loving', 'being', 'such', 'overachiever', 'know-it-all', 'Country', 'Fanfair', 'episode', 'included', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Eventhough', 'Peggy', 'got', 'everybody', 'nerves', 'bus', 'trip', 'Hank', 'continued', 'encourage', 'wife', 'obnoxious', 'behavior', 'now', 'who', ""would'nt"", 'want', 'marry', 'great', 'guy', 'Hank', 'Hill']",King of the Hill - The Complete Fourth Season
