Few directors would even attempt to bring this ""unfilmmable"" novel to the screen.John Huston does just that on a shoestring budget, and the result is an eccentric cinematic baptism of seemingly misguided spirituality, Evangelicalism, and contradictions.Hazel Motes (Brad Dourif) steps off the Army bus with a bold plan--start an Atheist church.  A place ""where the blind don't see and the lame don't walk and what's dead stays that way.""  He is one intense, angry little dude.  He's ready to shout out his opposition of religion to anyone who will listen.Now, Hazel is obviously harboring some inner demons.  I expected to see some flashbacks or references to some of his war experiences.  Maybe he lost a friend or something.  But this story offers no easy explanation for his lack of faith.This does present quite a collection of other characters as well.  A fake blind preacher and his promiscuous daughter, a kid fixated on a mummy at the museum, some fella in a gorilla suit, plus a rival underhanded prankster who continually preaches on Hazel's turf.  Quite a crew.I guess Wise Blood is a religious parable.  But it seems more about a state of mental and moral awareness.  It doesn't try to sway one's religious beliefs either way, as everyone comes off as batcrap crazy.  Even though I normally do love weird movies, I wish I could rate this ambitious and overwrought tale a little higher.  Hell, this even brought some unexpected laughs(a man getting viciously ran over by a car?).  But in the end, it left me feeling a little flat and uninspired.A well-made movie for people with messed up tastes.",3,"The first Church of Christ, without Christ",1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,1684,"['Bizarre', 'funny', 'complicated', 'disturbing', 'most', 'part', 'unappealing', 'Few', 'directors', 'would', 'even', 'attempt', 'bring', 'unfilmmable', 'novel', 'screen.John', 'Huston', 'just', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'result', 'eccentric', 'cinematic', 'baptism', 'seemingly', 'misguided', 'spirituality', 'Evangelicalism', 'contradictions.Hazel', 'Motes', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Army', 'bus', 'bold', 'plan', 'start', 'Atheist', 'church', 'place', 'where', 'blind', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lame', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'what', 'dead', 'stays', 'way', 'one', 'intense', 'angry', 'little', 'dude', 'ready', 'shout', 'out', 'opposition', 'religion', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen.Now', 'Hazel', 'obviously', 'harboring', 'inner', 'demons', 'expected', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'references', 'war', 'experiences', 'Maybe', 'lost', 'friend', 'something', 'story', 'easy', 'explanation', 'lack', 'faith.This', 'present', 'quite', 'collection', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'fake', 'blind', 'preacher', 'promiscuous', 'daughter', 'kid', 'fixated', 'mummy', 'museum', 'fella', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'rival', 'underhanded', 'prankster', 'who', 'continually', 'Hazel', 'turf', 'crew.I', 'guess', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'religious', 'parable', 'more', 'state', 'mental', 'moral', 'awareness', ""n't"", 'try', 'sway', 'one', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'way', 'everyone', 'off', 'batcrap', 'crazy', 'Even', 'normally', 'do', 'love', 'weird', 'movies', 'wish', 'could', 'rate', 'ambitious', 'overwrought', 'tale', 'little', 'higher', 'Hell', 'even', 'brought', 'unexpected', 'laughs', 'man', 'getting', 'viciously', 'ran', 'over', 'car', 'end', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'flat', 'uninspired.A', 'well-made', 'movie', 'people', 'messed', 'up', 'tastes']",Wise Blood

He elected to tackle novels that some would call unfilmable notably Malcolm Lowrey's ""Under the Volcano"" and James Joyce's ""The Dead"".Flannery O'Connor's ""Wise Blood"" is no exception.  The story basically concerns itself with an embittered returning veteran, Hazel Motes(Brad Dourif) who has no belief system and channels his frustration by forming a ""Church without Christ"".  Motes' forum is basically a soapbox in the town square where he can vent his disorganized beliefs.  Much to his surprise Motes discovers that charlatans come in all shapes and sizes believers and non-believers alike.  The film has an interesting structure consisting of serio-comic vignettes that seemingly have no relation to one another but ultimately hang the story together.  Why I give the film slight reservation is that Motes is an enigmatic character.  What brought him to his current frame of mind?  There is a  suggestion that it was from a childhood trauma but that didn't seem to satisfy me.  Maybe it's not important to the tale that Huston is trying to spin.

1236517,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001TIQT70,Doug Anderson,"[15, 18]","John Huston sets this adaptation of Flannery O'Connors Wise Blood not in the sin-soaked South of the early-twentieth century but in the present. This may have been due to budgetary constraints but Huston makes virtue of necessity and the result is a film that looks like it grew right out of the decaying streets of Anytown, America circa the late-1970's. The result is offsetting at first, because in this translation the story is less about religion and more about an America that has lost its unifying vision (if indeed it ever had one). Therefore, thematically, Huston's Wise Blood squares nicely with many other American films from the 69-81 Vietnam and post-Vietnam era like Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy, Bogdanavich's The Last Picture Show, Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop, Altman's Nashville, Malick's Days of Heaven, and Forman's Ragtime.As the beginning credits roll we are treated to a series of beautiful black and white photographs which serve as evocations of an older America but one that in some ways still exists and lives on in the old run-down parts of town and in the old run-down neighborhoods even as a new America tries to re-invent itself and erase its ties to its sin-soaked past. Wise Blood is about American history and identity in a time of national crisis, but Huston does not emphasize the Vietnam War as the source of this crisis, rather he underplays it and instead chooses to focus simply on a lack of a substantive vision (religious, artistic, or otherwise) to lend coherence to the chaos that is America not just in the seventies but in all times and places.To a certain extent this adaptation does feel like a loyal adaptation in so far as the characters are all lonely outcasts prey to visions and dreams that promise salvation but only bring about further destruction, and so they are all, despite their efforts, always on the verge of mental and spiritual collapse. This is certainly a vision of life that is everywhere present in William Faulkner and Nathaniel West and Tennessee Williams and Flannery O'Connor and Truman Capote and in countless other Southern writer's fictions, but its also the vision of many a writer not from the South. Huston was a big fan of Irish literature and it is also the vision of Joyce whose ""The Dead' was adapted by Huston in 1987, and Beckett, as well as English writer Malcolm Lowry whose Under the Volcano was adapted by Huston in 1984. Huston is interested in the specifics of American history and identity but the film he creates addresses not just an American but a world-wide malaise.Brad Dourif does a tremendous job as Hazel Motes. He plays Hazel as a tortured and lost soul desperately trying to free himself from America's long history of evangelical chicanery (Vietnam being just one example of something America has done using religion as a rationale). Hazel believes not in Jesus which only clouds peoples thinking and fools them into believing things they would be better off not believing, but in science which allows for a clear view of both the past and the future. But Hazel just can't get his preacher father or other preacher figures (one of which is played by Harry Dean Stanton and another by Ned Beatty) out of his mind or off of his conscious, as it were, for he's got a mighty guilty conscious even though he knows America's sins are not his own. He can't stand the superstition of religion and the way men use it to manipulate other men and yet it seems like everyone is either desperate to preach or deperate to be preached to if only to assuage the sense of being alone and lost.Hazel wants only to believe in material reality and tangible things like his old car which he thinks is all a man needs to live his life, but he just can't altogether shake the pull of the religious life which has the power (or at least offers the promise) to lure and transport the soul and not just the material body. In the end Hazel Motes becomes not a preacher but an otherworldy saint who has rejected the world and all ties to it.

1236518,A6Y3K7L1FRWP3,B001TIQT70,farington,"[2, 2]","One time I found this movie on a tape at a video rental store, located in the ""comedy"" section.  This wasn't a mistake, in fact it was an insightful choice by the owners of the store.  Even though parts of the film are dark as night, it's all delivered with an anarchic sense of humor.  Some of Hazel Motes' sermons, delivered while standing on the hood of his beat-up '58 Ford, are side-splittingly absurd, his landlady is a comic archetype of a certain Southern mentality (without being cliched), the flirtations of the blind preacher's daughter are perfect, and, if that's not enough, there's a guy in a gorilla suit.  But it's not Monty Python humor, it's Southern humor that has a rough edge to it,  something true to a rather harsh sensibility of the times and the region.  That harshness may be off-putting to many.  I grew up around this kind of thing, and maybe it doesn't register with someone raised outside of this milieu: when I saw this in a cinema, there were two people laughing during the film--me and another guy who, it turns out, was from Georgia.One side note, the cops in the film were not actors but real cops, and they delivered their lines with the kind of acidly sarcastic politeness tinged with menace that's true to the region and very funny to watch (when you're not on the receiving end of it).The film ends disturbingly, but I found something very exhilarating about its darkly comic treatment of the topics of religion and salvation.

1236519,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001TIQT70,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 1]","You have to give John Huston kudos for taking on a work of Flannery O'Connor, mainly because of the difficulty of making the grotesque, bizarre Southern gothic flavor work on the big screen. I was hesitant about viewing the film, mainly because I didn't want the film to be subpar in comparison to the book. I have to say that Huston is quite imaginative in bringing Wise Blood to life, and, while the film is not an all-encompassing deliverance of the novel, the film's actors who portray the eccentric characters in the book give the film much credibility. Over all, it was an impressive performance and artistically produced. It is a necessity to have read the book prior to seeing the film to make sense of the plot. With Flannery O'Connor, there is a backwards way to presenting a moral (although she often said there were no morals to her story), and so, you have to count on a world of hypocrites, liars, thieves, and other degenerates to make sense of life. A symbolism works throughout that the viewer interprets, and this gives Wise Blood an extra dimension while watching. For instance, there are many false preachers running throughout that epitomize the negative aspects to attempting to attain faith; this is something Hazel comes to terms with.  Hazel Motes, despite his fight against faith and religion, has no soul until he sees the light of salvation in the movie's second portion, although this is even an ambiguous event that could be interpreted several ways. Although he intimates that he has no such faith at any point, we can judge for ourselves if this is true.As far as the characterization, a superb job was done assembling a cast that breathes some life into the film and makes it visually comparable to the book. Brad Dourif completely embodies Hazel Moates in expression, angst, and rebelliousness; if there was one blemish, it was that the novel's Hazel had even more detachedness from the world in comparison with the film. The question of redeeming oneself is a central issue in Wise Blood, and the many fakes (Asa Hawkes, the false dried up mummy, Sabbath, Gonga the Giant Monarch, the ""false"" version of Hazel) within the story evoke feelings of people lost and without conscience or faith in anything, incapable of being redeemed.

This is not among his great ones.Flannery O'Connor's career was lamentably short, she died relatively young of a disease. While she lived, she produced some stories and short novels which stand out in the genre of Southern Gothic. This is maybe her most famous book.I don't claim that I have the foggiest notion what the good Ms.O'Connor, who could write so well without telling me much, wanted to tell us with her grotesque tale about the founder of the Church Without Jesus, but I am fairly certain that the Tennessee Waltz does not represent the right spirit for a movie version of this short novel. It just doesn't sound right. Unfortunately it is present during most of the film's duration and adds a mood that I find inadequate.Sometimes the music moves towards slapstick and silent movies. That may be a reasonable and defendable interpretation of the text, but my instinct tells me: no way. This may be the first movie that I can recall where I would say: with a different musical score it might have worked. I can't actually recall any other movie that I disliked mainly for the music. My point is: if this story is really meant to be slapstick, then one can not put slapstick music to it. That is the same as raising boards saying 'joke!' during a sit com. My point: if O'Connor meant to be funny, which is by no means certain, she did it with a stone cold face. And that is how the movie should have done it too!On the other hand, some things were done right, like the casting. Brad Dourif is a miracle as Hazel Motes, I would say he IS Hazel Motes. Harry Dean Stanton fits the part of Aza Hawks, the `blind' preacher, like a glove. His daughter Sabbath Lily (played by Amy Wright) is a marvel. Ned Beatty is ideal for Hoover Shoates.

More than that, he's out to destroy anyone who claims that Christ is indeed the Way, the Truth and the Life; he has all the maniacal zeal of a debauched decadent damning himself into sainthood.There are frequent flashbacks to Hazel's childhood, sitting in backwoods barns and hearing about hellfire and damnation from a tall, ugly, and sinister Pentecostal preacher played by none other than director John Huston.  This man was Mote's Grandfather and he was so terrifying that in one scene young Hazel urinates all over the place.He encounters all manner of evil and corruption as he bashes heads trying to become *the* only preacher in the South (not likely).  Encountering frauds, tricksters, and money hungry snake oil salesmen, the worst is perhaps Ned Beatty and his companion Asa Hawks (Harry Dean Stanton).  Not only do they plagiarize Hazel's demented sermons, given on the tops of cars and random streetcorners, they dare to do so for money, which really pisses Hazel off.  And Brad Dourif playing Hazel Motes--well, you wouldn't want to piss either of them off.In reality, behind his Protestant-atheist disguise, this man is a ""Jesus Hog"" as the daughter of the ""Blind Preacher"" calls him, and a penitent in the making.  Even his treatment of his insane, monkey suit donning young friend is only another manifestation of Catholicism's burning flame drawing him near like a demented moth.  And he crashes on that flame, quite badly.

1236523,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001TIQT70,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 6]","I've read that to understand Wise Blood one must read its source material, the novel by Flannery O'Connor. I didn't read this until after watching the film and prior to doing so had never heard of O'Connor or her novel. While the novel may assist in one's understanding of the film, I feel a second viewing of the film would serve a similar purpose...And I do plan on seeing the film again. While I may not have read the book and feel I do have more to understand about the film, Wise Blood is a film that came as a complete surprise to me. The film is directed by the legendary John Huston, whose filmography consists of several masterpieces...I've at least heard of many of them, but I hadn't heard of this film until The Criterion Collection released it some time ago. I didn't have high expectations for the film, but found the film only deepening my respect for Huston as a filmmaker.Brad Dourif plays Hazel Motes, a wide-eyed man returning home from the Army. When he finds his family home abandoned, he buys some new clothes and sets off to do things that ""ain't ever been done before."" His new clothes make him look like a preacher and he finds himself frequently mistaken for one, but he's quick to clarify he's not a preacher...Hazel hates preachers in fact. Soon, Hazel meets Asa Hawks (Harry Dean Stanton) a supposedly blind, snake-like preacher and his nymphet daughter Sabbath Lily (Amy Wright). Hazel seems to be running from the idea of religion, but always crashing head-on into it. Finally, Hazel begins preaching the ""truth without Christ.""It's a strange plot, yes...But it's worth noting that the film, while centered on religion, doesn't seem like a religious film. In fact, much of it plays like satire. Through his story, Hazel encounters all sorts of characters that could only exist in fiction, characters played by a perfect cast at the very top of their game. I don't recall ever seeing Dourif in a better role; he plays Motes wide-eyed, nervous, and with pent-up rage and religious fervor always about to bubble over the surface. It's certainly a career best for the man. Ned Beatty (in a small role) is delightfully sleazy, while Stanton is perfectly believable as the false preacher. Even Dan Shor impressed me with his performance as the child-like Enoch Emory.Huston was not a director that needed to be visually extravagant to make a beautiful film. Wise Blood is a great film to look at, with a postcard simplicity that is quite charming. Even the score is made up of simple folk-y music. The screenplay is by Michael Fitzgerald and Benedict Fitzgerald (who co-wrote The Passion of the Christ, which may make you see this film differently) and what a wonderful screenplay it is. It shifts effortlessly from quirky and funny to serious and disturbing and characters that could easily seem like stereotypes seem very human. As I said earlier in my review; I look forward to watching the film again to fully grasp the multiple dimensions of it.The Criterion Collection has done a beautiful job with the film's transfer and I applaud them for releasing the film and (hopefully) giving it a wider audience. While I can't quite figure out whether the film is supposed to be straight-forward or some sort of social satire (maybe Huston was confused as well), my first impression has left me thinking that Wise Blood is an overlooked American classic. I can only imagine that it would grow richer with repeated viewings.GRADE: A-",5,An Overlooked American Classic,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,3455,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'understand', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'one', 'must', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'novel', 'Flannery', ""O'Connor"", 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'watching', 'film', 'prior', 'doing', 'so', 'had', 'never', 'heard', ""O'Connor"", 'novel', 'novel', 'may', 'assist', 'one', 'understanding', 'film', 'feel', 'second', 'viewing', 'film', 'would', 'serve', 'similar', 'purpose', 'do', 'plan', 'seeing', 'film', 'again', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'feel', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'understand', 'film', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'film', 'came', 'complete', 'surprise', 'film', 'directed', 'legendary', 'John', 'Huston', 'filmography', 'several', 'masterpieces', ""'ve"", 'least', 'heard', 'many', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'released', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'found', 'film', 'only', 'deepening', 'respect', 'Huston', 'filmmaker.Brad', 'Dourif', 'Hazel', 'Motes', 'wide-eyed', 'man', 'returning', 'home', 'Army', 'When', 'family', 'home', 'abandoned', 'new', 'clothes', 'sets', 'off', 'do', 'things', 'ai', ""n't"", 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'new', 'clothes', 'make', 'look', 'preacher', 'frequently', 'mistaken', 'one', 'quick', 'clarify', 'not', 'preacher', 'Hazel', 'preachers', 'fact', 'Soon', 'Hazel', 'Asa', 'Hawks', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'supposedly', 'blind', 'snake-like', 'preacher', 'nymphet', 'daughter', 'Sabbath', 'Lily', 'Amy', 'Wright', 'be', 'running', 'idea', 'religion', 'always', 'crashing', 'head-on', 'Finally', 'Hazel', 'preaching', 'truth', 'Christ', 'strange', 'plot', 'yes', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'centered', 'religion', ""n't"", 'seem', 'religious', 'film', 'fact', 'much', 'satire', 'story', 'Hazel', 'sorts', 'characters', 'could', 'only', 'exist', 'fiction', 'characters', 'played', 'perfect', 'cast', 'very', 'top', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Dourif', 'better', 'role', 'Motes', 'wide-eyed', 'nervous', 'pent-up', 'rage', 'religious', 'fervor', 'always', 'bubble', 'surface', 'certainly', 'career', 'best', 'man', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'small', 'role', 'delightfully', 'sleazy', 'Stanton', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'false', 'preacher', 'Even', 'Dan', 'Shor', 'impressed', 'performance', 'child-like', 'Enoch', 'Emory.Huston', 'was', 'not', 'director', 'needed', 'be', 'visually', 'extravagant', 'make', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'great', 'film', 'look', 'postcard', 'simplicity', 'quite', 'charming', 'Even', 'score', 'made', 'simple', 'folk-y', 'music', 'screenplay', 'Michael', 'Fitzgerald', 'Benedict', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'may', 'make', 'see', 'film', 'differently', 'what', 'wonderful', 'screenplay', 'shifts', 'effortlessly', 'quirky', 'funny', 'serious', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'could', 'easily', 'seem', 'stereotypes', 'seem', 'very', 'human', 'said', 'earlier', 'review', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'fully', 'grasp', 'multiple', 'dimensions', 'it.The', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'done', 'beautiful', 'job', 'film', 'transfer', 'applaud', 'releasing', 'film', 'hopefully', 'giving', 'wider', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'straight-forward', 'sort', 'social', 'satire', 'maybe', 'Huston', 'was', 'confused', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'impression', 'left', 'thinking', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'overlooked', 'American', 'classic', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'would', 'grow', 'richer', 'repeated', 'viewings.GRADE', 'A-']",Wise Blood

1236528,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B001TIQT70,Robin Simmons,"[47, 48]","""WISE BLOOD"" is an overlooked jewel.Southern writer Flannery O'Connor's first novel, ""Wise Blood,"" made it to the big screen in 1979.  The John Huston directed, low budget feature was widely praised and then practically forgotten.O'Connor was a devout Catholic. She was also battling lupus, the sometimes debilitating immune disorder.  Both factors may have colored her novel.  Huston was a devout atheist.  His world view certainly nuanced the tone of the film.The story concerns a somewhat troubled, perhaps damaged, youth, Hazel Motes (Brad Dourif).  Just out of the army and son of a fire and brimstone Pentecostal preacher, Motes is determined to open the first Church Withouth Christ in Taulkinham, Tennessee.A young Brad Dourif is brilliant as the driven, vexed, Motes.  There's not a false note or a wasted frame.  His is a journey of spiritual self-exploration, penance and perhaps redemption.  O'Connor's curiosity about the southern brand of Pentecostal mind set is riveting on film.  Motes is trying to shed the damage of his ferocious religious childhood, but cannot shed his spirituality.  He finds he's a Christian in spite of himself.Supporting actors Harry Dean Stanton, Amy Wright, Ned Beatty, William Hickey and Dan Shor are all spot on.The frisson between director Huston's disdain for religion and O'Connor's devoutness is a perfect match.  The screenplay by brothers Benedict and Michael Fitzgerald does not stray from the core events, tone and ideas of O'Connor's story.The obviously lower budget production, shot mostly in Macon, Georgia of the late 1970s, does not really detract, even though the novel is set in a somewhat earlier period.The use of older, rather decayed buildings and locations amidst a more modern setting give a kind of muddy, out-of-time, appeal.  A nice visual metaphor to the theme of old fundamentalist religious views in conflict with a more progressive spirituality.This is a unique film and story.  Hard to categorize.  For me, it's a darkly comic, decidedly gothic, tale of profound spirituality and humanism.  When the shoot was over, Huston said, ""I think I've been had.""Criterion's transfer, as usual, is clean and  sharp.  I thought  the color was unusually true and subtle.  And the period monaural track crisp and easy on the ear.The extras are all watchable.  The new interviews with Dourif and the  writer-producer brothers Fitzgerald are entertaining and informative.A huge bonus is the rare recording of Flannery O'Connor reading her famous and terrific short story ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" is alone probably worth the price of the disc!  This is the only known recording of the author reading one of her stories.There's also a wonderful vintage 1982 ""Creativity With Bill Moyers"" with director Huston.",5,"DARKLY COMIC, SOUTHERN GOTHIC MASTERPIECE",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2769,"['WISE', 'BLOOD', 'overlooked', 'jewel.Southern', 'writer', 'Flannery', ""O'Connor"", 'first', 'novel', 'Wise', 'Blood', 'made', 'big', 'screen', '1979', 'John', 'Huston', 'directed', 'low', 'budget', 'feature', 'was', 'widely', 'praised', 'then', 'practically', ""forgotten.O'Connor"", 'was', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'was', 'also', 'battling', 'lupus', 'sometimes', 'debilitating', 'immune', 'disorder', 'factors', 'may', 'have', 'colored', 'novel', 'Huston', 'was', 'devout', 'atheist', 'world', 'view', 'certainly', 'nuanced', 'tone', 'film.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'perhaps', 'damaged', 'youth', 'Hazel', 'Motes', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Just', 'army', 'son', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'Pentecostal', 'preacher', 'Motes', 'determined', 'open', 'first', 'Church', 'Withouth', 'Christ', 'Taulkinham', 'Tennessee.A', 'young', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'brilliant', 'driven', 'vexed', 'Motes', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'wasted', 'frame', 'journey', 'spiritual', 'self-exploration', 'penance', 'perhaps', 'redemption', ""O'Connor"", 'curiosity', 'southern', 'brand', 'Pentecostal', 'mind', 'set', 'riveting', 'film', 'Motes', 'trying', 'shed', 'damage', 'ferocious', 'religious', 'childhood', 'can', 'not', 'shed', 'spirituality', 'Christian', 'spite', 'himself.Supporting', 'actors', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Amy', 'Wright', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'William', 'Hickey', 'Dan', 'Shor', 'are', 'spot', 'frisson', 'director', 'Huston', 'disdain', 'religion', ""O'Connor"", 'devoutness', 'perfect', 'match', 'screenplay', 'brothers', 'Benedict', 'Michael', 'Fitzgerald', 'not', 'stray', 'core', 'events', 'tone', 'ideas', ""O'Connor"", 'story.The', 'obviously', 'lower', 'budget', 'production', 'shot', 'mostly', 'Macon', 'Georgia', 'late', '1970s', 'not', 'really', 'detract', 'even', 'novel', 'set', 'somewhat', 'earlier', 'period.The', 'use', 'older', 'rather', 'decayed', 'buildings', 'locations', 'amidst', 'more', 'modern', 'setting', 'give', 'kind', 'muddy', 'out-of-time', 'appeal', 'nice', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'theme', 'old', 'fundamentalist', 'religious', 'views', 'conflict', 'more', 'progressive', 'spirituality.This', 'unique', 'film', 'story', 'Hard', 'categorize', 'darkly', 'comic', 'decidedly', 'gothic', 'tale', 'profound', 'spirituality', 'humanism', 'When', 'shoot', 'was', 'over', 'Huston', 'said', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Criterion', 'transfer', 'usual', 'clean', 'sharp', 'thought', 'color', 'was', 'unusually', 'true', 'subtle', 'period', 'monaural', 'track', 'crisp', 'easy', 'ear.The', 'extras', 'are', 'watchable', 'new', 'interviews', 'Dourif', 'writer-producer', 'brothers', 'Fitzgerald', 'are', 'entertaining', 'informative.A', 'huge', 'bonus', 'rare', 'recording', 'Flannery', ""O'Connor"", 'reading', 'famous', 'terrific', 'short', 'story', 'Good', 'Man', 'Hard', 'Find', 'alone', 'probably', 'price', 'disc', 'only', 'known', 'recording', 'author', 'reading', 'one', 'stories.There', 'also', 'wonderful', 'vintage', '1982', 'Creativity', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'director', 'Huston']",Wise Blood

It is a difficult movie to understand.  Mr. Motes pursues his vision of religious truth with great intensity and certainty.  He winds up angry, without sympathy for others, and worse (more detail w/be a spoiler).  Since the book's author, Flannery O'Connor was a devout Catholic, I'm guessing part of her intent was to warn that this is not a good state of mind in which to pursue sprirtual goals.
