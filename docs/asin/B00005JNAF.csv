The third and final season was just plain terrible. Season one and two were brilliant, intense, and incredible to view. So I highly recommend purchasing the first season of American Dreams today! First of all, I believe the show was a success because of one young lady, Brittany Snow who played the sweet but stubborn Meg Pryor. She is a gifted actress, she has been recently on shows as a guest star on Nip/Tuck and Law and Order:SVU. I see a huge and exciting career ahead for Miss Snow. Gail O'Grady is also wonderful in this show, she plays Meg's mother. Some big musical guests were on the first season so buy this DVD and see all the great songs and moving storylines of this great t.v. show.",5,Season one was amazing!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,863,"['American', 'Dreams', 'was', 'series', 'NBC', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'little', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'think', 'network', 'was', 'right', 'cancelling', 'show', 'last', 'year', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'Season', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'brilliant', 'intense', 'incredible', 'view', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'first', 'season', 'American', 'Dreams', 'today', 'First', 'believe', 'show', 'was', 'success', 'one', 'young', 'lady', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'who', 'played', 'sweet', 'stubborn', 'Meg', 'Pryor', 'gifted', 'actress', 'been', 'recently', 'shows', 'guest', 'star', 'Nip/Tuck', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'see', 'huge', 'exciting', 'career', 'ahead', 'Miss', 'Snow', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'also', 'wonderful', 'show', 'Meg', 'mother', 'big', 'musical', 'guests', 'were', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see', 'great', 'songs', 'moving', 'storylines', 'great', 't.v', 'show']",N/A

And When I finally got around to checking it out I was blown away! The show is absolutely amazing and the music was just icing on the cake. A second cake that is!I think this show was ahead of it's time. If it had started a year or 2 later it would probably still be on the air. One of my favorite things about American Dreams is that the show addresses a number of social issues that we Americans are still dealing with to this day.NBC really missed the boat on this one! They kept switching the time and day this show would air and they never seemed to seriously give American Dreams the slot it needed to thrive.I went online and looked for the other 2 seasons. NBC didn't bother to bless us with the full show on dvd, so I wasn't happy at all, but I did find individuals who claim to have personally recorded the entire 3 seasons on dvd. At first I thought ""no way""! They recorded it and kept it for all these years? Yeah right! But the price was dirt cheap, for all 3 seasons, so I took the dive and when I put in the first disc of season ""2"", I was shocked! I was all but certian I got ripped off but there it was.

It really was a real treat to watch this show, and enjoy the beauty and talents of so many musical guests as well as the young female actresses who play the main characters.  I always wondered why this DVD set was so expensive, but having watching it I think I now know.The voluminous production of music contained within this set is probably worth twice as much.  I love the editing and special effects, to ""recreate"" the look and feel that the original sets must have had.  I love how the singing stars are dressed, most likely in the same type of clothing that the original stars wore.The character development left a lot of room for improvement. I don't like how the older son actually got kicked out of school.  Why not show him having conflicts, but somehow overcoming it, and perhaps becomeing a football legend at his new college.  It wasn't right.  And I wonder how ""realistic"" the prejudice felt in Pennsylvania really was represented by the writing.  I have a feeling it was pretty bad.The older son's ""girlfriend"" from school was a throw-away character, who was added very little to the series, in my opinion.  At the beginning, her father was against the relationship with the older son, but that just sort of died ""on paper"" it seemed.I give this one 5 stars without question.

627985,A235FM9P7NUROA,B00005JNAF,"J. Miller ""Gotmywings2001""","[2, 2]","American Dreams' disappearance from NBC can be blamed on the network's indecision over its future. With its 3rd season nearing and end, NBC had not made a definitive decision on season 4. So series creator Jonathan Prince wrote 2 endings, one a ""cliffhanger"" if the series was a go for season 4. And a more ambitious series finale that fast-forwarded 5 years to show the Pryor family and friends in the year 1969.  NBC gave a tentative ""go"" for season 4, and then suddenly reversed their decision after season 3 ended with Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow) leaving town with the bad boy next door for parts unknown. Leaving us fans with no idea what happened next.That said, we as fans would still love to see seasons two and three. In these episodes, U.S. Marine J.J. Pryor headed for Vietnam and experienced the war firsthand as an infantryman and later as a collaborator with a shady C.I.A. operative played by Jeff Fahey. Back home, Meg continued as a regular on American Bandstand but was quickly challenging the ideals of her elders at home and school. And middle sister Patty was just as snotty as before (just my opinion).And then there was the music. The series continued its unique practice of using current music stars playing the stars of the past. So in seasons 2 and 3 there was Kelly Clarkson as Brenda Lee, Chris Isaak as Roy Orbison, John Legend as Stevie Wonder, and Jennifer Love Hewitt as Nancy Sinatra. Jennifer has a unique place in the show's history as the only ""performer"" to appear twice. There were also more subtle music cameos in the last season. At one point, a young singer (played by JoJo) asks for an audition and promptly blows the roof off the place belting out ""That'll be the Day"".

628000,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JNAF,P Magnum,"[3, 3]","American Dreams was an extremely well acted and produced show that had tons of potential but was never allowed to fully grow.  The show depicts the lives of the Pryors, a Philadelphia Irish Catholic family with four children.  Season one opens up on the day before and of the Kennedy assassination. It proceeds to unfold during the next year interjecting real life events into those of the Pryors and their family & friends. The action takes place mostly in the Pryors home, patriarch Jack's (Tom Verica) TV and appliance store and the set of American Bandstand where eldest daughter Meg (Brittany Snow) is a dancer. The Bandstand scenes allow for some musical numbers by modern day artists like Usher as Marvin Gaye, Michelle Branch as Leslie Gore and Wayne Brady who really shines as Jackie Wilson.  The show extremely plays fast and loose with actual timelines pushing events up before they actually happened and having performances of songs that occur well before they were ever released.  In fact, American Bandstand itself stopped filming in Philadelphia in February of 1964 and moved to Los Angeles, so the fact that they continued to depict the show being filmed there is a major fabrication.

An amazing time when everything was changing and breaking ground for the way I was eventually raised-in the 70's when the world was a different place.  It helped me understand better how my parents were raised and how hard it must have been to let go of so many absolutes you were raised with and change with the times.  Everytime I put in a sidc to watch one episode, I found myself 4-5 hours later finishing the entire disc, missing my regular shows on live TV.I'm sorry I missed it when it aired - I finally bought it because of the ratings being so good and I am so glad.  I loved every episode but wa heartbroken to find that the last disc(when I thought I had 4 or so episodes left) was only one episode.  Now I find there are no more seasons available.  I gave my parents the first two dvd's to watch and they immediately asked for thier own set because they grew up in that time and really enjoyed the show so I bought another one.  It's time for a set for my nieces and nephew - being a family show, they are old enough to watch it and see what life used to be like, long long before thier time.I'll never understand why shows that can be seen on every channel on TV are rapidly reproduced on DVD (when I can see them anytime) but shows that would only be seen on DVD are given one or two seasons and then cut short. I'm sure it's partly money but since there are so many shows requested widely on dvd but not produced - it can't all be about money.I REALLY WANT MORE AMERICAN DREAMS for everyone in the family...Please release the rest!!!!",5,Perfect for everyone in the family,1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,1569,"['What', 'great', 'show', 'amazing', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'changing', 'breaking', 'ground', 'way', 'was', 'eventually', 'raised-in', '70', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'different', 'place', 'helped', 'understand', 'better', 'how', 'parents', 'were', 'raised', 'how', 'hard', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'let', 'go', 'so', 'many', 'absolutes', 'were', 'raised', 'change', 'times', 'Everytime', 'put', 'sidc', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'found', '4-5', 'hours', 'later', 'finishing', 'entire', 'disc', 'missing', 'regular', 'shows', 'live', 'TV.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'missed', 'when', 'aired', 'finally', 'bought', 'ratings', 'being', 'so', 'good', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'loved', 'episode', 'heartbroken', 'find', 'last', 'disc', 'when', 'thought', 'had', '4', 'so', 'episodes', 'left', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Now', 'find', 'are', 'more', 'seasons', 'available', 'gave', 'parents', 'first', 'two', 'dvd', 'watch', 'immediately', 'asked', 'thier', 'own', 'set', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'so', 'bought', 'one', 'time', 'set', 'nieces', 'nephew', 'being', 'family', 'show', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'used', 'be', 'long', 'long', 'before', 'thier', 'time.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'channel', 'TV', 'are', 'rapidly', 'reproduced', 'DVD', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'anytime', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD', 'are', 'given', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'cut', 'short', ""'m"", 'sure', 'partly', 'money', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'requested', 'widely', 'dvd', 'not', 'produced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'money.I', 'REALLY', 'WANT', 'MORE', 'AMERICAN', 'DREAMS', 'everyone', 'family', 'Please', 'release', 'rest']",N/A

628006,AKT8I9H8R37LI,B00005JNAF,Sunny Dae,"[108, 110]","""American Dreams"" is a show that could have been on the air during the very timeframe in which it was set. In it's entirely too short three season run, it was a standout, simply because it was well written, wonderfully acted, and just plain entertaining - something to which the millions of reality shows and ""Law and Order"" clones cluttering the airwaves couldn't begin to compare. ""American Dreams"" captured both the lingering innocence and the burgeoning counter culture of the 60's. Kids spent their time listening to records and watching ""American Bandstand"", but surreptitiously attended war protests on college campuses. Dads earned a living and handed down advice and discipline while moms cooked balanced meals, but after the children were in bed, they discussed such taboo subjects as women's rights, race relations, and birth control. All of these subjects were addressed intelligently and realistically, but the writers never failed to add humor to the scripts as well.Much of the show was from the viewpoint of Meg Pryor (played by the wonderful Brittany Snow). We first meet Meg as a sweet 15 year old who realizes her lifelong dream of becoming a dancer on ""American Bandstand"". The two hour pilot episode finds Meg and her wild child best friend Roxanne scheming to be pulled from the daily lineup of hopeful dancers outside the Philadelphia television studio where ""Bandstand"" is filmed, for a guest appearance on the show. It takes some conniving on the part of the always hilariously outrageous Roxanne, but one day the impossible happens, and both girls make it onto the show. Meg doesn't believe it could possibly get any better - until she catches the eye of one of the show's producers, who offers her a regular spot. Her ecstasy is short lived when she finds out that not only was Roxanne was not asked to be a regular, but her father will not allow her to be on the show. Meg's determination finally wins her father's permission, but her guilt over Roxanne leads to her decision to quit. A resolution is reached when the producer is impressed by Meg's loyalty and invites Roxanne to be a regular as well, but the pilot ends on a somber note with the assassination of President Kennedy.This episode is characteristic of the rest of the season (and Seasons 2 and 3 as well). ""American Bandstand"" features prominently in the series as we follow Meg and Roxanne's daily adventures as dancers and minor celebrities. One of the highlights of the series was the outstanding performances of many 21st century bands playing 60's acts such as Jay and The Americans and The Kinks. However, it also tackles heavier issues, such as the Vietnam War (a major focus of Season 2, which follows the active duty of Meg's brother J.J.) and racism. Many storylines feature Henry, a black employee of Meg's father's appliance store, and his son Sam, with whom Meg forms a close friendship despite disapproval from both families and society in general. Over the course of the three seasons, Meg develops from a starry eyed ""good girl"" to an intelligent, socially conscious young woman, who challenges the gender roles set for her and always follows the path that she knows is right. But the show never forgot how to have fun as well.""American Dreams"" was one of the finest television shows ever produced. Thumbs down to NBC for not recognizing what they had. If only they'd given it a fighting chance (putting it in a decent time slot and allowing the episodes to be re-run in the off season), it would have been remembered as a legend years from now!",5,"Wonderful, sorely missed TV series",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3553,"['American', 'Dreams', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'air', 'very', 'timeframe', 'was', 'set', 'entirely', 'too', 'short', 'three', 'season', 'run', 'was', 'standout', 'simply', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'just', 'plain', 'entertaining', 'something', 'millions', 'reality', 'shows', 'Law', 'Order', 'clones', 'cluttering', 'airwaves', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'compare', 'American', 'Dreams', 'captured', 'lingering', 'innocence', 'burgeoning', 'counter', 'culture', '60', 'Kids', 'spent', 'time', 'listening', 'records', 'watching', 'American', 'Bandstand', 'surreptitiously', 'attended', 'war', 'protests', 'college', 'campuses', 'Dads', 'earned', 'living', 'handed', 'down', 'advice', 'discipline', 'moms', 'cooked', 'balanced', 'meals', 'children', 'were', 'bed', 'discussed', 'such', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'women', 'rights', 'race', 'relations', 'birth', 'control', 'subjects', 'were', 'addressed', 'intelligently', 'realistically', 'writers', 'never', 'failed', 'add', 'humor', 'scripts', 'well.Much', 'show', 'was', 'viewpoint', 'Meg', 'Pryor', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'first', 'meet', 'Meg', 'sweet', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'becoming', 'dancer', 'American', 'Bandstand', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Meg', 'wild', 'child', 'best', 'friend', 'Roxanne', 'scheming', 'be', 'pulled', 'daily', 'lineup', 'hopeful', 'dancers', 'Philadelphia', 'television', 'studio', 'where', 'Bandstand', 'filmed', 'guest', 'appearance', 'show', 'conniving', 'part', 'always', 'hilariously', 'outrageous', 'Roxanne', 'one', 'day', 'impossible', 'happens', 'girls', 'make', 'show', 'Meg', ""n't"", 'believe', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'better', 'eye', 'one', 'show', 'producers', 'who', 'regular', 'spot', 'ecstasy', 'short', 'lived', 'when', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Roxanne', 'was', 'not', 'asked', 'be', 'regular', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'show', 'Meg', 'determination', 'finally', 'father', 'permission', 'guilt', 'Roxanne', 'decision', 'quit', 'resolution', 'reached', 'when', 'producer', 'impressed', 'Meg', 'loyalty', 'Roxanne', 'be', 'regular', 'well', 'pilot', 'somber', 'note', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy.This', 'episode', 'characteristic', 'rest', 'season', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'Bandstand', 'prominently', 'series', 'follow', 'Meg', 'Roxanne', 'daily', 'adventures', 'dancers', 'minor', 'celebrities', 'One', 'highlights', 'series', 'was', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'many', '21st', 'century', 'bands', 'playing', '60', 'acts', 'such', 'Jay', 'Americans', 'Kinks', 'However', 'also', 'heavier', 'issues', 'such', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'major', 'focus', 'Season', '2', 'active', 'duty', 'Meg', 'brother', 'J.J.', 'racism', 'Many', 'storylines', 'feature', 'Henry', 'black', 'employee', 'Meg', 'father', 'appliance', 'store', 'son', 'Sam', 'whom', 'Meg', 'close', 'friendship', 'disapproval', 'families', 'society', 'general', 'course', 'three', 'seasons', 'Meg', 'starry', 'eyed', 'good', 'girl', 'intelligent', 'socially', 'conscious', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'gender', 'set', 'always', 'path', 'right', 'show', 'never', 'forgot', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'Dreams', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'produced', 'Thumbs', 'down', 'NBC', 'not', 'recognizing', 'what', 'had', 'only', ""'d"", 'given', 'fighting', 'chance', 'putting', 'decent', 'time', 'slot', 'allowing', 'episodes', 'be', 're-run', 'off', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'remembered', 'legend', 'years', 'now']",N/A
