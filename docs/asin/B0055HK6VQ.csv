The ex from her future turns out to be just as much a shock for us as it for her and saying anything further about him would be a great big spoiler. I probably shouldnt even said that much. She does end up with man she loves though. You should get this movie.

So, I was really hopeful for Christmas Cupid.  It is semi-cute which about the best I can say for it.  There's some humor to it, but the story just isn't that solid and tended to wander a bit.  Cynthia Evans character comes off rather sleezy which I didn't think was appropriate for a Christmas movie.  Then again, ABC Family has been far from ""Family oriented"" with much of their recent programming.  So, in many ways, I guess I should have seen this movie coming.I might suggest renting it and watching it one time, but I would keep the younger kids out of the room.  My teenager thought it was boring and not very funny - keep in mind that my teenager loved Snowglobe too.  This movie isn't as bad as some 'Christmas movies' (i.e. Happy Feet), but it definitely missed the target on being a classic, unforgettable or one that should be watched year after year.",2,Missed the target and hit the tree,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,932,"['really', 'liked', 'when', 'Christina', 'Milan', 'did', ""'Snowglobe"", 'was', 'great', 'So', 'was', 'really', 'hopeful', 'Christmas', 'Cupid', 'semi-cute', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'humor', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'solid', 'tended', 'wander', 'bit', 'Cynthia', 'Evans', 'character', 'rather', 'sleezy', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'appropriate', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Then', 'again', 'ABC', 'Family', 'been', 'far', 'Family', 'oriented', 'much', 'recent', 'programming', 'So', 'many', 'ways', 'guess', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'coming.I', 'might', 'suggest', 'renting', 'watching', 'one', 'time', 'would', 'keep', 'younger', 'kids', 'room', 'My', 'teenager', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'keep', 'mind', 'teenager', 'loved', 'Snowglobe', 'too', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', ""'Christmas"", 'movies', 'i.e', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'definitely', 'missed', 'target', 'being', 'classic', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'year', 'year']",Christmas Cupid

It is a different spin on A Christmas Carol and a great romantic movie. However, I don't know if I would say it is a &#34;family&#34; movie. It does involve drinking and an out of control pop-star. Personally, I would let my teenage kids watch it as they understand the difference between make-believe movies and real life (real-life pop stars act much worse than this movie portrays).
