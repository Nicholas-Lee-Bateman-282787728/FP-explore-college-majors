755660,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00009OOFA,,"[5, 8]","Film Editing is not a concept that jumps to mind when assessing the success of a movie.  After all, who outside of the film industry, gets excited about the &quot;Best Film Editing&quot; Academy Award?  Good editing escapes our attention while bad editing grabs it.  The worst film editing I can recall was in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; but the editing of &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; may take its' place.  Let's be frank here;  This movie is at least an hour too long.  The main reason for this is that it elaborates far too many scenes.  A good film will spend only as much time as necessary to make the points it wants to make.  Great films are noted, among other things,  for their subtlety.  I will mention two scenes by way of explanation.  The first that comes to mind is one in which, on the eve of battle, Colonel Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) quotes Julius Ceasar.  We got the message early on but had to stay for the whole page and a half of the quote.  The second scene that comes to mind was the long, drawn out illness and death of Stonewall Jackson.  I spend a lot of time wondering whether this movie is about the early days of the Civil War or the last days of Stonewall Jackson.  That question, as well, is the fault of failing to edit with a story focus in mind.  Another complaint of the editing was the sense that I was seeing the same scenes over and over.  I realize that a battle often has ebbs and flows but we were immersed in too much repetition.  Finally, I was struck by the lack of a sense of direction as to where the story was going.  I realize that this is about the Civil War but why did we have all the different related stories that we did?  It seemed that we were going from scene to scene at random.  For example, we have, in this movie, the best ever film about the battle of Fredricksburg.  In that battle we DO get the subleties as well as a great overview.  We had the one example of an officer making a sound suggestion of strategy only to be dismissed by General Burnside who had his mind made up.  There were, of course, many such mistakes as that one made by Burnside but this scene is sufficient to make the point.  There are the frequent scenes of the Rebels three deep at the wall on the hill.  By passing the guns back for others to reload, we could see that the Rebels were able to fire at least twice as often as the Yankees.  These and many other scenes were very impressive.  Why is it, then, that we view the battles of First Bull Run and Chancellorsville only through the eyes of Jackson's troops?I can tell from other reviews that there is a large element of fans out there who appreciate this movie for going out of its' way to show the &quot;real&quot; Civil War.  I can certainly see the many elements in this movie that brings out that reaction.  My point is that it is possible to accomplish that AND have a slimmer, better edited movie.  There are other complaints I have about the movie such as the mediocre acting.  However, there is much to admire about it as well.  I give it an &quot;A&quot; for effort.  Now if we can just send it back to the cutting room...",3,At Least an Hour too Long,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,3128,"['Film', 'Editing', 'not', 'concept', 'mind', 'when', 'assessing', 'success', 'movie', 'who', 'film', 'industry', 'excited', 'quot', 'Best', 'Film', 'Editing', 'quot', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Good', 'editing', 'escapes', 'attention', 'bad', 'editing', 'grabs', 'worst', 'film', 'editing', 'can', 'recall', 'was', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'quot', 'editing', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'quot', 'may', 'take', 'place', 'Let', 'be', 'frank', 'here', 'movie', 'least', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'main', 'reason', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'spend', 'only', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'necessary', 'make', 'points', 'make', 'Great', 'films', 'are', 'noted', 'other', 'things', 'subtlety', 'will', 'mention', 'two', 'scenes', 'way', 'explanation', 'first', 'mind', 'one', 'eve', 'battle', 'Colonel', 'Chamberlain', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Julius', 'Ceasar', 'got', 'message', 'early', 'had', 'stay', 'whole', 'page', 'half', 'quote', 'second', 'scene', 'mind', 'was', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'illness', 'death', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'wondering', 'movie', 'early', 'days', 'Civil', 'War', 'last', 'days', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'question', 'well', 'fault', 'failing', 'edit', 'story', 'focus', 'mind', 'complaint', 'editing', 'was', 'sense', 'was', 'seeing', 'same', 'scenes', 'realize', 'battle', 'often', 'ebbs', 'flows', 'were', 'immersed', 'too', 'much', 'repetition', 'Finally', 'was', 'struck', 'lack', 'sense', 'direction', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'realize', 'Civil', 'War', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'different', 'related', 'stories', 'did', 'seemed', 'were', 'going', 'scene', 'scene', 'random', 'example', 'have', 'movie', 'best', 'ever', 'film', 'battle', 'Fredricksburg', 'battle', 'DO', 'get', 'subleties', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'overview', 'had', 'one', 'example', 'officer', 'making', 'sound', 'suggestion', 'strategy', 'only', 'be', 'dismissed', 'General', 'Burnside', 'who', 'had', 'mind', 'made', 'up', 'were', 'course', 'many', 'such', 'mistakes', 'one', 'made', 'Burnside', 'scene', 'sufficient', 'make', 'point', 'are', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'Rebels', 'three', 'deep', 'wall', 'hill', 'passing', 'guns', 'back', 'others', 'reload', 'could', 'see', 'Rebels', 'were', 'able', 'fire', 'least', 'twice', 'as', 'often', 'Yankees', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'Why', 'then', 'view', 'battles', 'First', 'Bull', 'Run', 'Chancellorsville', 'only', 'eyes', 'Jackson', 'troops', 'can', 'tell', 'other', 'reviews', 'large', 'element', 'fans', 'who', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'going', 'way', 'show', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Civil', 'War', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'many', 'elements', 'movie', 'out', 'reaction', 'point', 'possible', 'accomplish', 'AND', 'have', 'slimmer', 'better', 'edited', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'complaints', 'have', 'movie', 'such', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'However', 'much', 'admire', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'effort', 'Now', 'can', 'just', 'send', 'back', 'cutting', 'room']",N/A
755661,AVBYL0BIAZ8IB,B00009OOFA,,"[5, 8]","I really don't understand some of the negative criticism this movie has received.  First, people like to throw the term &quot;Lost Cause&quot; around.  As someone who has spent a good amount of time studying the Confederacy and &quot;Lost Cause&quot; writings, I don't see it in this film.  Essentially, the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; theory, advanced by Jubal Early and others, was that the South fought bravely for its independence from an opporessive North, but despite the valor of its generals and soldiers, it was overwhelmed by Northern resources and manpower.  It generally slights Union valor and generalship, and expresses pro-slavery  and racist sentiments.  Now, how is that directly present in this movie?  Northern soldiers are portrayed equally as valiantly as Southern.  Union generalship in the moive is portrayed as it was in 1861-3--bad.  I also don't think the movie in any way depicts the Union's victory as inevitable.  The movie ends with the greatest of Lee's victories--Chancellorsville.  Some have criticized for downplaying the role of slavery as a cause of the war.  I defy anyone to find one single pro-slavery element in this film.  Well, neither Lee nor Jackson fought for slavery.  Their characters are accuratly portrayed for the most part.  Jackson, if anything, could be been played as even more eccentric.  But the filmakers capture the great contrast of his being a fanatically religious man, and yet a cold-blooded killer in war at the same time.  It is, however, disappointing Antietam and the major outcome of the battle (the Emancipation Proclamation) were not at all included in film.  In that sense, the movie does fail to deal with the transformation of the war from one for the old union to one for a new union.  In any case this is not a work of history.  It is historical fiction and essentially the stories of three men:  Lee, Jackson, and Chamberlain.Is the movie flawed?  Certainly.  First, the subject matter is just too large for a 3.5 hour treatment.  We jump from Manassas to Fredericksburg, with virtually no reference to what happens in the mean time.  A lot of time is wasted with sappy, and poorly acted scenes involving several Virginia families.  Why we need Ted Turner and Robert Byrd cameos is utterly beyond me.  It was probably a mistake to turn this into a theatrical movie, and would have made a much better miniseries.I would say its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses though.  Despite some poor acting, the main cast is quite good, with Stephen Lang's Jackson being the highlight.  The only problem I have with his performance is that I can, at times, see his General Pickett from &quot;Gettysburg&quot; coming through.  The look of the movie is very good, and the battle scenes are quite stunning (though a bit sanitized).  Personally, I also really enjoyed the score.  The DVD itself is a major let-down.  The special features range from moderatly interesting to utterly pointless.  No deleted scenes.  I sense Turner is going to at some point release an extended version of this ala Lord of the Rings.So, give this film a chance and accept it for what it is:  A mostly accurate piece of historical fiction that would have made a better mini-series than a movie.",3,A Better Mini-Series than a Movie,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,3231,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'negative', 'criticism', 'movie', 'received', 'First', 'people', 'throw', 'term', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'quot', 'around', 'someone', 'who', 'spent', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'studying', 'Confederacy', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'quot', 'writings', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'Essentially', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'quot', 'theory', 'advanced', 'Jubal', 'Early', 'others', 'was', 'South', 'fought', 'bravely', 'independence', 'opporessive', 'North', 'valor', 'generals', 'soldiers', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'Northern', 'resources', 'manpower', 'generally', 'Union', 'valor', 'generalship', 'pro-slavery', 'racist', 'sentiments', 'Now', 'how', 'directly', 'present', 'movie', 'Northern', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'equally', 'as', 'valiantly', 'Southern', 'Union', 'generalship', 'moive', 'portrayed', 'was', '1861-3', 'bad', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'way', 'Union', 'victory', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'greatest', 'Lee', 'victories', 'Chancellorsville', 'have', 'criticized', 'downplaying', 'role', 'slavery', 'cause', 'war', 'defy', 'anyone', 'find', 'one', 'single', 'pro-slavery', 'element', 'film', 'Well', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'fought', 'slavery', 'characters', 'are', 'accuratly', 'portrayed', 'most', 'part', 'Jackson', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'been', 'played', 'even', 'more', 'eccentric', 'filmakers', 'capture', 'great', 'contrast', 'being', 'fanatically', 'religious', 'man', 'yet', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'war', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'disappointing', 'Antietam', 'major', 'outcome', 'battle', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'sense', 'movie', 'fail', 'deal', 'transformation', 'war', 'one', 'old', 'union', 'one', 'new', 'union', 'case', 'not', 'work', 'history', 'historical', 'fiction', 'essentially', 'stories', 'three', 'men', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'Chamberlain.Is', 'movie', 'flawed', 'Certainly', 'First', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'too', 'large', '3.5', 'hour', 'treatment', 'jump', 'Manassas', 'Fredericksburg', 'virtually', 'reference', 'what', 'mean', 'time', 'lot', 'time', 'wasted', 'sappy', 'poorly', 'acted', 'scenes', 'involving', 'several', 'Virginia', 'families', 'Why', 'need', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'Robert', 'Byrd', 'cameos', 'utterly', 'was', 'probably', 'mistake', 'turn', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'miniseries.I', 'would', 'say', 'strengths', 'far', 'outweigh', 'weaknesses', 'poor', 'acting', 'main', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Jackson', 'being', 'highlight', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'performance', 'can', 'times', 'see', 'General', 'Pickett', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'coming', 'look', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'stunning', 'bit', 'sanitized', 'Personally', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'score', 'DVD', 'major', 'let-down', 'special', 'features', 'range', 'moderatly', 'interesting', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sense', 'Turner', 'going', 'point', 'release', 'extended', 'version', 'ala', 'Lord', 'Rings.So', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'accept', 'what', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'piece', 'historical', 'fiction', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'mini-series', 'movie']",N/A

755663,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,B00009OOFA,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[7, 10]","After I viewed Gods and Generals I really pondered what the problem was with this film.  I thoroughly enjoyed Director Ron Maxwell's film of the novel The Killer Angels more popularly known as Gettysburg.  (This despite Martin Sheen's Cornpawn depiction of Robert E. Lee.)  In this outing for Turner Pictures director Maxwell tried too hard to hold true to the novel of the same name. And this is the problem.  The film is almost 4 hours long and filled with long winded romantic speeches by southerners about ""The South.""  And the ""Shirley Templesq"" scenes between Stonewall Jackson and the small child, well...one almost expected for that kid to break out singing ""On the good ship Merrimac.""  Corny.  The Director tried to give the novel its due but only ended up with a too long movie that had dialogue that just droned on.  I mean if these historical figures, Jackson, Lee, Chamberlin et al really gave these long winded speeches the common soldier of the day would have fallen asleep in the middle of a charge.  To be fair Robert Duval gave a fine performance as Robert E. Lee.  I have read a few biographies about Stonewall Jackson and the film did capture his personality.  He was deeply religious, devoted to family, and a military genius.  Finally, on the DVD you get some great extra features most notably to music videos, one by Bob Dylan, and another by Mary Fahl.  There is supposedly one more film to this trilogy and I hope Director Ron Maxwell learned his lesson from this 2nd in the set.",2,Trys too hard to hold true to the novel...,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,1505,"['viewed', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'really', 'pondered', 'what', 'problem', 'was', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'film', 'novel', 'Killer', 'Angels', 'more', 'popularly', 'known', 'Gettysburg', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Cornpawn', 'depiction', 'Robert', 'E', 'Lee', 'outing', 'Turner', 'Pictures', 'director', 'Maxwell', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'hold', 'true', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'problem', 'film', 'almost', '4', 'hours', 'long', 'filled', 'long', 'winded', 'romantic', 'speeches', 'southerners', 'South', 'Shirley', 'Templesq', 'scenes', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'small', 'child', 'well', 'one', 'almost', 'expected', 'kid', 'break', 'out', 'singing', 'good', 'ship', 'Merrimac', 'Corny', 'Director', 'tried', 'give', 'novel', 'due', 'only', 'ended', 'up', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'had', 'dialogue', 'just', 'droned', 'mean', 'historical', 'figures', 'Jackson', 'Lee', 'Chamberlin', 'al', 'really', 'gave', 'long', 'winded', 'speeches', 'common', 'soldier', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'middle', 'charge', 'be', 'fair', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'gave', 'fine', 'performance', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'have', 'read', 'few', 'biographies', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'film', 'did', 'capture', 'personality', 'was', 'deeply', 'religious', 'devoted', 'family', 'military', 'genius', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'get', 'great', 'extra', 'features', 'most', 'notably', 'music', 'videos', 'one', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Mary', 'Fahl', 'supposedly', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'trilogy', 'hope', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'learned', 'lesson', '2nd', 'set']",N/A
755664,AOU1CY0LXZ0KX,B00009OOFA,"Acts1767 ""Jason""","[3, 13]","I was terribly disappointed with Martin Sheen's portrayal of Roberyt E. Lee in Gettysburg. Sheen - whether by his own design or by Ted Turner's - made Lee look indecisive, too reliant on J.E.B. Stuart (and Sheen portrayed Lee as confused and near-clueless due to Stuart's absence in the fiorst two days of Gettysburg, when Lee did have Cavalry under his Nephew, Gedneral Fitzhugh Lee, who as as able a commander as Stuart), and basically hopelss in the face of the coming battle. In Gods and Gernerals, Robert Duvall made General Lee look like the man he was: capable, decisive, able, and brilliant. After watching this classic, I am convinced that the way Duvall portrayed Lee is exactly how the man was! My breath was taken away by Duvall's portrayal of General Lee! This movie - along with &quot;Open Range&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, and &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; has made me into a huge Duvall fan! His portrayal of Lee, as well, showed the General as he was in his Christian Faith: a man who led, but was also led by a Greater Leader.Stephen Lang, as well, did an awesome job portraying Thomas Jonathanm &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Many times in this day and age, people who are died-out-to-Christ Christians are often protrayed as brainwashed, crazy, Pharisaical, prudish, and/or out-of-touch with reality. This has been done in some history books when describing and covedring General Jackson. Lang's portrayal of Jackson was as down-to-earth and real as Duvall's portrayal of Lee was, and Lang made Jackson look like a real person, who - though he had an intense faith and high belief in Jesus Christ -didn'tg leave his brain and personality at the door, as Hollywood has done to prior and later charachters who professed some kind of faith in Jesus Christ. As with Pickett in &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, Lang went over-the-top with this rendition of General Stonewall Jackson, and showed him to be a real man of living, breathing flesh, but also a down-to-earth believer of Jesus Christ, and a man who was comitted to doing what was right.Finally, Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain was, again, well-done. As in gettysburg, Daniels showed us the real side of a man who is only known of from History. As with lang and Duvall, Daniels made Chamberlain come to life in a way rarely seen. Mira Sorvino, as well, portraying Mrs. Joshua Chamberlain, did a great job, though her part was brief.This movie is a great improvement over Gettysburg, and if the third installment of this trilogy again uses Duvall, Lang, and Daniels, I'll be on the front row watching the whole thing!",5,Exact Opposite of Gettysburg...,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2600,"['was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'portrayal', 'Roberyt', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Gettysburg', 'Sheen', 'own', 'design', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'made', 'Lee', 'look', 'indecisive', 'too', 'reliant', 'J.E.B', 'Stuart', 'Sheen', 'portrayed', 'Lee', 'confused', 'near-clueless', 'due', 'Stuart', 'absence', 'fiorst', 'two', 'days', 'Gettysburg', 'when', 'Lee', 'did', 'have', 'Cavalry', 'Nephew', 'Gedneral', 'Fitzhugh', 'Lee', 'who', 'able', 'commander', 'Stuart', 'basically', 'hopelss', 'face', 'coming', 'battle', 'Gods', 'Gernerals', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'made', 'General', 'Lee', 'look', 'man', 'was', 'capable', 'decisive', 'able', 'brilliant', 'watching', 'classic', 'am', 'convinced', 'way', 'Duvall', 'portrayed', 'Lee', 'exactly', 'how', 'man', 'was', 'breath', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'Duvall', 'portrayal', 'General', 'Lee', 'movie', 'quot', 'Open', 'Range', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'quot', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'quot', 'made', 'huge', 'Duvall', 'fan', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'as', 'well', 'showed', 'General', 'was', 'Christian', 'Faith', 'man', 'who', 'led', 'was', 'also', 'led', 'Greater', 'Leader.Stephen', 'Lang', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'portraying', 'Thomas', 'Jonathanm', 'quot', 'Stonewall', 'quot', 'Jackson', 'Many', 'times', 'day', 'age', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'died-out-to-Christ', 'Christians', 'are', 'often', 'protrayed', 'brainwashed', 'crazy', 'Pharisaical', 'prudish', 'and/or', 'out-of-touch', 'reality', 'been', 'done', 'history', 'books', 'when', 'describing', 'covedring', 'General', 'Jackson', 'Lang', 'portrayal', 'Jackson', 'was', 'down-to-earth', 'real', 'Duvall', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'was', 'Lang', 'made', 'Jackson', 'look', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'intense', 'faith', 'high', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'Christ', ""-didn'tg"", 'leave', 'brain', 'personality', 'door', 'Hollywood', 'done', 'prior', 'later', 'charachters', 'who', 'professed', 'kind', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Pickett', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'Lang', 'went', 'over-the-top', 'rendition', 'General', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'showed', 'be', 'real', 'man', 'living', 'breathing', 'flesh', 'also', 'down-to-earth', 'believer', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'comitted', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'right.Finally', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'portrayal', 'Joshua', 'Chamberlain', 'was', 'again', 'well-done', 'gettysburg', 'Daniels', 'showed', 'real', 'side', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'known', 'History', 'lang', 'Duvall', 'Daniels', 'made', 'Chamberlain', 'come', 'life', 'way', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'as', 'well', 'portraying', 'Mrs.', 'Joshua', 'Chamberlain', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'part', 'was', 'brief.This', 'movie', 'great', 'improvement', 'Gettysburg', 'third', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'again', 'Duvall', 'Lang', 'Daniels', ""'ll"", 'be', 'front', 'row', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing']",N/A

All of this adds up to why I was very disappointed in ""Gods and Generals.""Mr. Maxwell was so consumed with making an accurate protrayal of events in the earlier part of the Civil War that he forgot that he was directing a film.  And that is why the drama of this conflict is so sadly lacking.  I honestly believe that the director believed the hype of Civil War buffs (and I am one of them) when they idolized ""Gettysburg.""Continuity is lacking.  Some of the incredible drama surrounding the First Bull Run is missing.  Northern civilians really believed that this would be a very short war, so short that they could have a picnic while this battle ensued.  This is missing.The brilliance of Stonewall Jackson's end around maneuver at Chancellorsville is muddled. A few maps of explanation would have helped.  Instead, we have a bunch of soldiers running without any understanding of what was occurring.  Luckily I know the battle, so I knew what was happening.  My wife had no idea, nor did many people around us.The major characters that Jeff Shaara flushed out in his excellent historical drama are given short shrift.  Little is seen of Hancock.  Most is devoted to Jackson, yet we have very little character study.  Why did Jackson behave as he did?  You will not find out in this film.  And that is a fatal error in any novel or film.And slavery is treated as a some silly little divertisement.  Whether or not you agree that slavery was a major cause of the War, it certainly played a huge role in events leading up to the War.  You would not know it from this film.  You would think all slaves were treated as part of the family.  There is no notion of some of the inhumanity.And the speeches!  Mr. Maxwell, this is a film not a play!  I just hope you have not destroyed any chance of Shaara's ""Last Full Measure"" making it to the screen.I would recommend reading some of the historian's critiques in Civil War magazines.

The only improvement I might have made would have been to start the story earlier in the time frame.The movie was - despite being a little sterile - very accurate historically and should go a long way to fix may peoples misunderstanding about the war. Much as Gangs of New York showed much of the strife in the north during thre war like the Draft Riots.The war between the states was not even a real &quot;civil war&quot; anyway. A civil war is defined as a battle between two factions fighting for the control of a county. The south never wanted control over the north, merely the right to seceed and have some modicum of self determination much as the 13 colonies seceeded from England. It was truly a war of agression by the north against the south - at time an independant sovereign nation.I wish the movie went a little deeper into this. What was portrayed was accurate even is some people don't like it.I loved the acting and the scenery and ther was a sense of a larger canvas in the background.In spite of what a previous reviewed said about the &quot;good guys&quot; winning.

755670,A2V40R97RU5NAB,B00009OOFA,Allan W. Goodall,"[14, 15]","Note: the run time of the DVD is that of the theatrical release. Ron Maxwell (the director) had promised that the Battle of Antietam would be in a 6 hour version of the DVD. Either the lackluster box office returns prevented it, or there will be a special edition later.As a Civil War enthusiast and amateur historian, I really wanted to like this movie. Instead I was disappointed. There are major story telling problems, and the vaunted &quot;accuracy&quot; of the film is debatable.The Southern viewpoint is not as incorrect as some have suggested. The people portrayed as fighting for states rights historically _were_ fighting for states rights. Conveniently left out, though, is any pro-slavery viewpoint. Deliberately or not, _Gods and Generals_ is a shining example of ""Lost Cause"" orthodoxy.Slavery itself is not well depicted. Only two African-American characters have speaking parts. One is fiercely loyal to her mistress, the other is Stonewall Jackson's cook (who shared an uncommonly close relationship with the general in real life). Both portrayals are accurate in themselves, but the picture they paint is far from complete. Nowhere do we see the legions of slave labor that followed Confederate armies, or the brutal living conditions endured by most slaves. The female slave loyally protects her mistress' home from Union looters in Fredericksburg. Missing are the slaves who openly helped the Yankees loot _their_ masters' houses.If the Southern viewpoint is sanitized, so is the Northern. Nowhere does Maxwell mention the near mutinies in the Union armies over the Emancipation Proclamation. Unionists are all seen as anti-slavery. This was not the case. The U.S. of the 19th century, like most other countries at the time, was deeply racist. All of the Union characters appear as abolitionists, though abolitionists formed a small minority amongst Northern soldiers.Maxwell's sins are mostly of omission, not commission. Individual surface details are accurate but only if they don't get in the way of the story.The inaccuracies that do exist jar against the parts that are correct. Some inaccuracies are relatively minor (Jackson addressing his troops as the 2nd Corps well before the Confederacy could legally create corps). Others are far worse (Jackson learning of Hooker's movements at the beginning of the Chancellorsville campaign). Jackson's dying words don't include his call for A.P. Hill (one of my favourite bits of Civil War trivia, as Robert E. Lee called for Hill when he was dying, too). Am I being picky? Perhaps, but if Maxwell spent the time to get the cap badges and buttons correct, why did he play around with the more important elements? Like most Hollywood directors he was happy throwing accuracy out the window if it got in the way of the story.This wouldn't be so bad if the story was well told. It's not. There are huge gaps in time and space. We jump from the spring of 1862 to December of that year, completely ignoring the bloody spring and summer campaigns. The battle of Antietam was filmed, but cut from the finished version (and left out of this DVD). Stonewall Jackson is the major character of the film, yet his valley campaign and his role at Fredericksburg are completely ignored. The Chancellorsville sequence ignores the first and third days of the battle. There are a lot of long speeches, a deliberate nod to _The Killer Angels_/_Gettysburg_, but they are overly long and terribly repetitive. At least half an hour of talking could have been cut easily without affecting the story.Maxwell did get some things right. Jackson's passionate love life with his wife is brilliantly shown. The battles looked like they involved vast numbers of men (though they are not altogether accurate; don't expect a realistic depiction of gore and suffering, ala _Saving Private Ryan_). The period costumes are wonderful. I loved the shots of Harper's Ferry, Fredericksburg and some of the other lanscape shots (in spite of what some reviewers have said about them). This was the first film I have ever seen that gave me a true sense of what the Civil War would have looked like. For this reason I recommend seeing the film, but I can't recommend it as a good movie.Maxwell tried to cover too much time and too many people. If he had focused on one or two battles, or just on Jackson, it could have been a superior film. Instead, it suffers badly from having to act as _Gettysburg_'s prequel, a more satisfying movie due to its focus and better source material.",2,Sins of Omission,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,4508,"['Note', 'run', 'time', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'director', 'had', 'promised', 'Battle', 'Antietam', 'would', 'be', '6', 'hour', 'version', 'DVD', 'lackluster', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'prevented', 'will', 'be', 'special', 'edition', 'Civil', 'War', 'enthusiast', 'amateur', 'historian', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Instead', 'was', 'disappointed', 'are', 'major', 'story', 'telling', 'problems', 'vaunted', 'quot', 'accuracy', 'quot', 'film', 'debatable.The', 'Southern', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'as', 'incorrect', 'have', 'suggested', 'people', 'portrayed', 'fighting', 'states', 'rights', 'historically', '_were_', 'fighting', 'states', 'rights', 'Conveniently', 'left', 'out', 'though', 'pro-slavery', 'viewpoint', 'Deliberately', 'not', '_Gods', 'Generals_', 'shining', 'example', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'orthodoxy.Slavery', 'not', 'well', 'depicted', 'Only', 'two', 'African-American', 'characters', 'have', 'speaking', 'parts', 'One', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'mistress', 'other', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'cook', 'who', 'shared', 'uncommonly', 'close', 'relationship', 'general', 'real', 'life', 'portrayals', 'are', 'accurate', 'picture', 'paint', 'far', 'complete', 'Nowhere', 'do', 'see', 'legions', 'slave', 'labor', 'followed', 'Confederate', 'armies', 'brutal', 'living', 'conditions', 'endured', 'most', 'slaves', 'female', 'slave', 'loyally', 'mistress', 'home', 'Union', 'looters', 'Fredericksburg', 'Missing', 'are', 'slaves', 'who', 'openly', 'helped', 'Yankees', 'loot', '_their_', 'masters', 'Southern', 'viewpoint', 'sanitized', 'so', 'Northern', 'Nowhere', 'Maxwell', 'mention', 'near', 'mutinies', 'Union', 'armies', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'Unionists', 'are', 'seen', 'anti-slavery', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'U.S.', '19th', 'century', 'most', 'other', 'countries', 'time', 'was', 'deeply', 'racist', 'Union', 'characters', 'appear', 'abolitionists', 'abolitionists', 'formed', 'small', 'minority', 'amongst', 'Northern', 'soldiers.Maxwell', 'sins', 'are', 'mostly', 'omission', 'not', 'commission', 'Individual', 'surface', 'details', 'are', 'accurate', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'story.The', 'inaccuracies', 'do', 'exist', 'jar', 'parts', 'are', 'correct', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'Jackson', 'addressing', 'troops', '2nd', 'Corps', 'well', 'Confederacy', 'could', 'legally', 'create', 'corps', 'Others', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'Jackson', 'learning', 'Hooker', 'movements', 'beginning', 'Chancellorsville', 'campaign', 'Jackson', 'dying', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'call', 'A.P', 'Hill', 'one', 'favourite', 'bits', 'Civil', 'War', 'trivia', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'called', 'Hill', 'when', 'was', 'dying', 'too', 'Am', 'being', 'picky', 'Perhaps', 'Maxwell', 'spent', 'time', 'get', 'cap', 'badges', 'buttons', 'correct', 'why', 'did', 'play', 'more', 'important', 'elements', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'was', 'happy', 'throwing', 'accuracy', 'window', 'got', 'way', 'story.This', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'told', 'not', 'are', 'huge', 'gaps', 'time', 'space', 'jump', 'spring', '1862', 'December', 'year', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'bloody', 'spring', 'summer', 'campaigns', 'battle', 'Antietam', 'was', 'filmed', 'cut', 'finished', 'version', 'left', 'out', 'DVD', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'major', 'character', 'film', 'yet', 'valley', 'campaign', 'role', 'Fredericksburg', 'are', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Chancellorsville', 'sequence', 'first', 'third', 'days', 'battle', 'are', 'lot', 'long', 'speeches', 'deliberate', 'nod', '_The', 'Killer', 'Angels_/_Gettysburg_', 'are', 'overly', 'long', 'terribly', 'repetitive', 'least', 'hour', 'talking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'easily', 'affecting', 'story.Maxwell', 'did', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'Jackson', 'passionate', 'love', 'life', 'wife', 'brilliantly', 'shown', 'battles', 'looked', 'involved', 'vast', 'numbers', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'altogether', 'accurate', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'gore', 'suffering', 'ala', '_Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan_', 'period', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'loved', 'shots', 'Harper', 'Ferry', 'Fredericksburg', 'other', 'lanscape', 'shots', 'spite', 'what', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'gave', 'true', 'sense', 'what', 'Civil', 'War', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'reason', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'good', 'movie.Maxwell', 'tried', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'focused', 'one', 'two', 'battles', 'just', 'Jackson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'superior', 'film', 'Instead', 'badly', 'having', 'act', '_Gettysburg_', 'prequel', 'more', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'due', 'focus', 'better', 'source', 'material']",N/A

This movie does explore the Civil War from a southern perspective, which is one reason I believe this movie is thrashed by critics.  Today, while I watched a few scenes from the movie, I reflected on the great Stonewall Jackson.  All men are flawed and he is no exception, but I truly believe he is an excellent example for modern Christians to follow.  He truly trusted the Lord in all things and believed in providence, which people often question in this modern age.Steven Lang did a wonderful job of bringing life into Thomas Jackson.  I loved watching Jackson's interaction with his wife and even a small child he befriends.  Personally, most movies fail to place beating hearts into characters, but Gods and Generals gives life to the generals, soldiers, and civilians of the North and South.  Although some people seem to prefer Martin Sheen over Robert Duvall, I enjoyed seeing Duvall portray the heroic Robert E. Lee.  Lee isn't the main character in this movie, but when he does appear, Duvall realistically displays Lee's Christian virtues, wisdom, and leadership.As a history teacher, I showed this movie to my eighth grade students and many of them enjoyed it.  Any person who is trying to learn about the Civil War will gain a lot of insight from this movie.  The subject of slavery is debated from all perspectives in Gods and Generals.  Viewers will see that many slaves were respectful of their masters, but still hoped to gain their freedom.  Many southern generals and soldiers didn't own slaves, but fought for their homeland.  This historical issue will always be debated, but I think this movie fairly addresses both sides of the debate.This DVD is dual sided and is a bargain.  It offers many bonus features that should interest students of history and the average viewer.  Both of the included music videos are enjoyable to watch and paint a vivid image of the impact death had on Americans during the Civil War.  The Stonewall Jackson mini-documentary is interesting, but parts of it seem nonprofessionally filmed.  Many of the critics of this film should praise it for bringing a tragic war in our past to life in a balanced perspective.  For too long, historians have bashed the South and uplifted the North to a fault.  Both armies had heroes and villains; both had just reasons to fight too.  Do not let all the critics of this movie hinder your choice in watching it.  Give the movie a chance.

It is, sad, though, to see so many chances missed in a single film.Stonewall Jackson (the overriding subject of this film) is probably the most interesting American Military leader in our nation's history and deserves a film at least of the caliber of Patton; yet in this film so little is really revealed about him, other than that he is devoutly religious, loves his wife, enjoys the company of children and wins a lot of battles. More focus, better casting, and less attempted breadth of scope would have produced a more biographical film to be much more valued and enduring. The strangest irony of all is that the perfect actor to portray Jackson in such a biograpy was already in the film, cast as Lee. (The fact that Duval was so disappointing as Lee only adds to this irony.)The greatest disappointment, however, was the portrayal of the battle of Chancellorsville, which was so hurried that it only occupied about 20 minutes of film time. Chancellorsville was in fact the most significant, greatest and longest day of Jackson's life (probably also the greatest single day for the confederacy) perfect for him in every way, including, perhaps, the fact that it also happened to be his last day in charge of his army. Such an end for him, mortally wounded by his own soldiers at the close of his greatest victory, seems almost too perfect not to be scripted. So many wonderful details about this battle were missed, such as the fact that the union soldiers, who were cooking breakfast, were first surprised by deer and other animals bounding from the forest in the path of so many confederates moving rapidly toward them through the woods. To a film which paid so much attention to historical detail, this sort of detail would have added much to the proper mood and the almost mystical qualities of the battle.The worst thing about this film, however, besides the cameo appearance by Ted, which was certainly the low point, was the really sappy music, which intruded frequently on dialog, unnecessarily distracting and annoying any earnest viewer who might still be trying to concentrate on the actors.The film is not entirely bad, however, and does provide at least a cursory view of the early stages of the civil war, and does provide well intended attention to historical detail, setting and costume.",3,"Ok, in places, but not that great.",1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,2531,"['kind', 'hard', 'put', 'down', 'movie', 'such', 'sincere', 'effort', 'historical', 'events', 'depicted', 'are', 'so', 'rarely', 'treated', 'film', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'are', 'so', 'intrinsically', 'intersting', 'sad', 'though', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'chances', 'missed', 'single', 'film.Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'overriding', 'subject', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'American', 'Military', 'leader', 'nation', 'history', 'film', 'least', 'caliber', 'Patton', 'yet', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'really', 'revealed', 'other', 'devoutly', 'religious', 'wife', 'company', 'children', 'lot', 'battles', 'More', 'focus', 'better', 'casting', 'less', 'attempted', 'breadth', 'scope', 'would', 'have', 'produced', 'more', 'biographical', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'valued', 'enduring', 'strangest', 'irony', 'perfect', 'actor', 'portray', 'Jackson', 'such', 'biograpy', 'was', 'already', 'film', 'cast', 'Lee', 'fact', 'Duval', 'was', 'so', 'disappointing', 'Lee', 'only', 'irony', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'however', 'was', 'portrayal', 'battle', 'Chancellorsville', 'was', 'so', 'hurried', 'only', 'occupied', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'Chancellorsville', 'was', 'fact', 'most', 'significant', 'greatest', 'longest', 'day', 'Jackson', 'life', 'probably', 'also', 'greatest', 'single', 'day', 'confederacy', 'perfect', 'way', 'including', 'perhaps', 'fact', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'last', 'day', 'charge', 'army', 'end', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'own', 'soldiers', 'close', 'greatest', 'victory', 'almost', 'too', 'perfect', 'not', 'be', 'scripted', 'So', 'many', 'wonderful', 'details', 'battle', 'were', 'missed', 'such', 'fact', 'union', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'cooking', 'breakfast', 'were', 'first', 'surprised', 'deer', 'other', 'animals', 'bounding', 'forest', 'path', 'so', 'many', 'confederates', 'moving', 'rapidly', 'woods', 'film', 'paid', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'sort', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'much', 'proper', 'mood', 'almost', 'mystical', 'qualities', 'battle.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'however', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Ted', 'was', 'certainly', 'low', 'point', 'was', 'really', 'sappy', 'music', 'intruded', 'frequently', 'dialog', 'unnecessarily', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'earnest', 'viewer', 'who', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'trying', 'concentrate', 'actors.The', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'however', 'provide', 'least', 'cursory', 'view', 'early', 'stages', 'civil', 'war', 'provide', 'well', 'intended', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'setting', 'costume']",N/A

You are probably aware of the story (and if not, you should be) as this is a prequel to the very succesful, and equally lengthy Gettysburg. This movie has historical accuracy and period detail overload, and I did wonder whether the armies of extra's who played in the film (most of whom belong to the actual relevant regiment historical societies) had more fun watching this movie, than general viewers. I would have loved to give this movie a better rating, but I just can't - it's long, lumbering, drawn out and what little story there is gets lost in the spectacle of it all. Another popular criticism was that for a movie dealing with slavery to have only two small talking roles for black actors is also a bit of a joke. There are a few small saving graces however, not least the excellent sombre performance of Robert Duvall, and the DVD has some nice extra's,  but on the whole it's a bladder testing exercise, and history lesson docudrama that would be just at home on the Discovery channel, as the big screen.

755675,A928WN8NV03WZ,B00009OOFA,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[4, 7]","I like to study history, and the civil war is one of my favorite points in American History.  Mainly because it was so controversial, the reasons, the bad guys, the death toll, etc.....  It was one of the bloodiest battles in our history, not because both sides were american, but because of the percentage of dead per battle, sometimes reaching 30%.I do believe that the South got a raw deal for a long time.  They weren't blameless, but they also weren't the evil group of racists that were potrayed.  Plus this delves into the fact that the war wasn't about slavery until the later stages, something the North didn't even want.  But that is all up for debate in another forum.This movie is well filmed, the characters feel more three dimensional and close to their real life counterparts, and the recreation of some of the battles are done in an almost loving fashion done by those who spend their pasttime recreating major events.  It shows two major early battles where the confederacy won stunning victories causing heavy losses for the Union.  This movie also goes to great links humanizing both sides of the conflict.  They try to show that the soldiers on both sides are people, that don't like having to go to war, but believe in their respective causes enough to do so.The main characters of the movie, Robert E Lee, and General ""Stonewall"" Jackson, are accurately portrayed, and well casted.  Jackson looking almost identical to his potraits, with a scary intensity in his eyes.  Robert Duvall is in classic form, playing a cautious and calculating Robert E Lee.On the side of the Union is Jeff Daniels as Lt Col Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Kevin Conway as Sgt Buster Kilrain.  A pair of men that make it obvious that they would rather be at home with family than battling this war, but answer to duty.  You sympathize with them when they are put into poorly planned millitary engagements likely to their death.The main complaint from people who like this movie was that it left a lot out, there were a lot of smaller battles that where, but it would have added another 2 hours easily to the already 4 hour movie.  Maybe we can hope for a special edition some day.This movie is very pro southern, so if your views tend to favor the union, this is probably not for you.  If you don't love history or recreations of battles, especially ones using Napoleonic Tactics and weapons, it probably also is not for you.

755676,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00009OOFA,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[1, 5]","I posted a review of this movie back in December 2006 that was highly favorable, 4 out of 5 stars, full of sugar plums and dandylions complaining only about the speechified dialogue and the casting decisions.I am an adult now, and having done a lot of reading and research on the Civil War, this film is dismal.The Civil War was fought over slavery.  Straight and simple.  Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed, clinging to the romantic ""Lost Cause"" notion, in denial, or a straight-up liar.  The only ""State's Rights"" the South fought to defend were the State's Rights to maintain slavery.  Ironic given that the very same South raging over ""State's Rights"" proceeded to use the EVIL Federal government to enforce their Fugitive Slave act, which FORCED Northern states to help track down and return runaway slaves to their masters.  THAT IS A VIOLATION OF STATE'S RIGHTS.But I don't fault this movie for bashing us over the head with the slavery argument, or even for avoiding it--- ""Gettysburg"" avoided it, and I still feel that was a spectacular movie despite it.Here, though, they bash us over the head with the idea that it was NOT about slavery, with more scenes added in the Director's Cut that only FURTHER bash this idea over our heads in the most ridiculous and borderline-offensive way possible.Going back to the original film, there are moments that make me cringe or outright roll my eyes in disgust or bemusement, such as early in the film, where a man is decrying secession, and says there is no reason to secede, and that slavery will eventually die of natural causes.  Slavery, not the 4 million slaves Southerners all owned.  Another is particularly mind-blowing in its insanity is one with Robert Duval's Lee telling a Major that Fredericksburg is meaningful to him because it's where he met his wife, and it's something ""these Yankees"" will NEVER understand.  Even now, -I- can't understand how a man like that thinks that other men would not understand the significance of a place to someone else.  It's almost as if Duval ad-libbed it and no one was brave enough to question the legendary actor on the lack of common sense of such a statement.But the aforementioned border-line offensive new bit added in are several new scenes involving the slave man Jim and one of the other black ""free"" men working with him as cooks to the Army of Northern Virginia.  This ""free"" black man gives some convoluted story about his master buying him and freeing him once the war started, and the man apparently being so grateful, he followed his former master in to the war for service.This absolutely STINKS of Paternalism.  Paternalism was the Southern DELUSIONAL belief that slavery was a humane system peculiar to the American South, and that Africans were so inferior as a race that they NEEDED to be enslaved in order to be RAISED like children into being at least partly civilized.  Slave-owners genuinely believed and deluded themselves that their slaves were HAPPY under them (obviously so long as their masters didn't cruelly abuse them needlessly.This sentiment was ALMOST present in the scenes involving the slave woman Martha, but I feel it was realistically handled, particularly with Martha confessing to Union General Hancock that despite the sympathy she has for her masters, she above all wants to be free.This sentiment is wholly absent in the aforementioned story of Jim's friend, so in love with his master he weepily brings his coffin home when he dies in combat.And then there's John Wilkes Booth.  Holy hell.  I would've endured all the speechifying of all the little characters in this film if it meant the character John Wilkes Booth was completely out of this film altogether.  A full SIX scenes of Booth are included in the director's cut, and they're all EXACTLY the same; Booth whining and complaining about the war and childishly blaming Lincoln for it entirely.  He's obviously not portrayed as a hero OR villain, but he comes across so melodramatic and whiny and self-important and so completely useless that it's an absolute pain to endure his scenes.  They literally contribute NOTHING to the film, and the highly unsubtle foreshadowing of his assassination of Lincoln obviously amounts to nothing, since the event isn't covered in this film, but is ultimately frustrating because of how foolishly blunt it's handled.Additional scenes PADDING out this 4 hour and 40 minute length (yes, PADDING) include training scenes of the 20th Maine regiment (which actually aren't dull but quite entertaining), scenes of Jackson picking a horse and riding his horse around the countryside, a COMPLETELY USELESS AND PAINFULLY SUGARY scene involving a Prussian colonel presenting a new uniform to Stonewall Jackson from General Stuart, and more post-Fredericksburg moping by the 20th Maine people.The battle scenes were somewhat grand, but the scope was far too limited; you got no sense of what was really happening beyond ""people slowly trudge forward, point and shoot, people fall"".  This is especially true of the First battle of Manassas/Bull Run, the new scenes in Antietam, and everything outside of the initial charge in Chancellorsville and most of Fredericksburg battle.Most decried for being cut out in its entirety, the Antietam battle sequences are probably the most useless in the film.  All we get are some scenes of men fighting in a corn field, and a brief shot of who I think was supposed to be General McClellan, looking far too skinny and slender to be the beefy-looking man in the photos of the real guy.Overall, the ""6 hour"" completely new ""Gods and Generals"" people were expecting is the exact same movie, with loads more padding, and the novelty of some new scenes cut into the same film you've been watching for 8 years.",1,"Re-thinking the film, plus Director's Cut analysis",1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,5781,"['posted', 'review', 'movie', 'back', 'December', '2006',

755682,A2Y0N656MWUCXU,B00009OOFA,Archanubis80,"[0, 0]","The prequel to the movie ""Gettysburg"", ""Gods and Generals"" deals with the period between the start of the American Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg. Like it's predecessor, ""Gods and Generals"" isn't destined to be a box-office hit and is more likely to see more success in video release. It's too long; when I went to see this movies, the theater had placed an intermission in it.While ""Gettysburg"" was a great movie, and the book ""Gods and Generals"" by the son of ""The Killer Angels"" author Mike Sharra was excellent, this movie falls short. This is probably the first movie I've ever been to where I felt like walking out before it was completed. The problem lies with the period of time ""Gods and Generals"" is set. Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""The Killer Angels"", which covers a period of four to five days, the book ""Gods and Generals"" covers a span of five *years*; from several days before John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859 to the days leading to the Battle of Gettysburg. This is where the movie failed to deliver.Because of the span of years, and the already insane length of the movie, several key events in Civil War history are skipped. The movie features the Battles of First Manassas (or Bull Run), Fredricksburg, and Chancellorsville. As a result, John Brown's raid, the Pennisula campaign and Seven Days, Second Manassas (Bull Run), and Antietam are left out. The result is a movie with more holes in it than Swiss cheese. Also, in writing the book, Jeff Shaara gave a more even handed version of the events during the period before Gettysburg. Through Hancock, we see the frustration of the Union troops as they encounter one inept commander after another. The movie, however, focuses on General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson almost primarily; Generals Lee and Hancock are pushed to almost supporting characters in a complex story. I do not include Col. Chamberlain in that comparison, as he wasn't seen that much in the book, either (Fredricksburg being the only exception).That's not to say the actors didn't do a good job with what they had. Stephen Lang, originally the ill-fated Pickett in ""Gettysburg"", does a fabulous job as the eccentric Stonewall. Robert Duvall does a somewhat better job than Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee; I only say that because I think Lee was underused in this movie. Jeff Daniels once again shows why he is perfect for the role of Chamberlain. And with several actors reprising their roles from ""Gettysburg"", it does make the movie worthwhile to see.However, the actors cannot take away the fact that this was a movie that would have been better off as a TV Mini-Series. Whoever convinced Ted Turner that this would do well as a feature film should have his or her head checked. As a mini series, this could have been broken up into several parts, allowing the writers and director to expand the story. The parts could have gone like this:Part 1: Harper's Ferry and First ManassasPart 2: The Rise of Robert E. Lee as General of the Army of Northern Virginia; the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven DaysPart 3: Second Manassas and Anteitam.Part 4: Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, and the days before Gettysburg.As such, we are left to wait for the video release and hope Turner and Maxwell can redeem this movie that way. And perhaps the lessons learned from this experience will help save ""The Last Full Measure"" from a similar fate. I only give this move 3 stars, as there are no half stars.

One would have expected a great deal more, given that director Ron Maxwell was again at the helm, that ""the formula"" seemed clear, and that Robert Duvall replaced Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee - an urgently needed up-grade. But, no, they tried to do too much, they let the tentacles of political correctness creep into the mix, they let Ted Turner have a speaking role, and ""in general,"" the whole thing was sub-par: a nearly four hour mess that had you wondering if this could POSSIBLY be the same gang that made Gettysburg. Some specific irritations...The script seems to be 80% speeches and Great Discourses on Events of the Time. Few people have real, back and forth conversations. It is maddening - like a string of Shakespearian soliloquies.The music isn't worth a grade B film, much less an epic. At one battle scene from out of nowhere comes a chorus of women's voices with a ludicrously inappropriate piece that distracts from, rather than adds to, the tapestry they are attempting to paint.Most of the story is woven around Stonewall Jackson. Now, in real life, he was either a ""deeply pious"" man or a religious whack job, depending upon your personal perspective. Here's a guy who wouldn't mail a letter just before the weekend because it might be carried on the Sabbath (but who found some convoluted reasoning that allowed him to fight on Sunday). Watching the film, however, you soon get tired of his sanctimonious prayers and his invoking God incessantly. Strangely, too, Maxwell choose Stephen Lang for the part - he who played George Pickett in the earlier film; makes you do some double takes. Lang has come along way from his wooden ""Crime Story"" performances, but he ""ain't no Errol Flynn,"" and that's what the part called for.There's a black character, a head cook, that's apparently supposed to add historical perspective to the film, specifically the ""role of the black man in the war-torn South,"" and after introducing him, the movie drops him for over two hours! He then gratuitously pops up at the death bed scene. I'm not sure, but I doubt that Stonewall's cook was at his side as he expired. Certainly his widow's written account of the deathbed scene makes no mention of him.At one point in the story, two soldiers on opposite sides of the war and a river they're standing beside, shout greetings and agree to exchange tobacco and coffee. These kinds of things are well documented from the war; but, in order to be ""deeply philosophical"" and/or ""arty,"" Maxwell decides to have them come together, exchange coffee cup and pipe, and just stand there SILENT for a long while as the scene fades to black. With these two men taking a break from hell, after trying to kill one another but still being ""brothers,"" hundreds of miles from home, getting to see the human measure of the enemy up close and personal, we are expected to believe that they wouldn't say a single word to each other? It's just absurd.There were three major battles depicted, and that's simply too much for an audience to assimilate. It worked in Gettysburg because it was all in the same place and the strategic issues were all the same. In Gods and Generals, they should have focused just on Chancellorsville, Lee's greatest triumph and where Jackson is mortally wounded by his own soldiers. Speaking of Lee, he should have been MUCH more prominent in the story.Joshua Chamberlain was ""but a shadow of his former self,"" as portrayed in Gettysburg, but not in girth: Jeff Daniels was at least 40 pounds heavier, which was disconcerting.So, it is disappointing indeed.

755685,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00009OOFA,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[20, 23]","I can definitely see why this movie might not have appealed to the average film audience.  While it definitely has the ""boom"" and ""action"" of adventure films, it really is more of a study of personalities, and moves almost as slowly as the Civil War itself.  It is, however, a fascinating and very real portrayal of war and its effects, not only on its participants, but on its own rationale.  The latter is something with which most of the audience has become more intimately familiar with the Western world's recent involvement in war and politics in the Middle East and the changes in rationale that occurred to justify it.When the credits first began to role at the beginning of this film and I realized that Ted Turner, who lives himself in Georgia, was its primary motivator, I anticipated that Gods and Generals would be a document of purely Southern sympathy, which to some extent it is.  The movie was based on a book by the same title, which I have yet to read, so I have no idea what the author's original intention might have been.  I have to admit that although the film focuses on the colorful personalities of the generals-as its title implies it will-it doesn't hesitate to confront the issues that modern audiences would expect of it.  It does, however, deal with them in a rather patronizing way.  The issues of the South defending its homeland and way of life, the heretofore unaddressed issue of constitutional right of secession, states rights verses the rights of the central government to maintain the nation's integrity, and the failure of the founding fathers to resolve the paradox of slavery in the world's first real democracy, are all confronted rather politely.Lee and Jackson speak with eloquence of the need to protect their homeland from aggression and of their being the inheritors of the mantel of their Revolutionary War forefathers.  They honestly believe that they are carrying forward the torch of freedom against the tyranny of an oppressive government as their forebearers had.  They seem almost oblivious to the paradox of slavery in the midst of this great fight for ""freedom.""  Nor does the film itself really deal with it.  Beyond the prayers of the only two black people who are allowed to be individuals on screen, slavery is seen as hardly there.  Everybody is ""family.""  Apparently some are just more ""family"" than others.  While there is a great show of the brutality of war, there is very little show of the brutality of slavery.  The movie keeps it all nice and tidy, doubtless out of respect for the delicate sensibilities of the audience.On the plus side, it does deal with honesty the fact that neither side started out to change the status of the black population so much as to resolve the problem of the right of states to secede from the union.  As Jackson points out to his aide, if the North loses, the powers that be will retire on their earnings from war speculation; while if the South loses, it loses everything.  In effect he was all too right.  A great deal of money exchanged hands in the industrialized North during this time period.  Speculation and graft were rampant, and doubtless great fortunes were and would have been made, win or lose.  Lincoln, lionized in our own times, was reviled by many, North and South, in his own, and at times with reason.  In order to achieve some of his goals he occasionally gave away patronage to those who didn't deserve it.As Jackson and Lee both indicate in the film, and as shown vividly, each foot of land in the South was dearly fought for by people with everything to lose.  Watching the carnage and devastation which took place almost completely on southern soil, makes the viewer realize why the Civil War is still very much alive in the hearts and minds of our southern citizens.  While many of us in the North may have ancestors who fought in the war, those of us in the South have ancestors who were fighting for their land, field by field.  While many of us in the North visit Civil War battle sites, most of us in the South live near or on them, and see them every day.  Some of the areas in the rural South have yet to recover to this very day from the devastation visited upon them by the war and its aftermath.Robert Duval is the quintessential Robert E. Lee.  He brings the man fully to life.  His graceful portrayal, especially when he is engaged in discussing battle plans, makes the viewer feel as though present at a real moment in time, the parlay before Chancellorsville especially so.  It is impressive work.  He makes it abundantly evident that Lee was a man who understood the personalities of others.  Lee's summation of General Burnside at Fredericksburg was brilliant.  Indeed Duval's portrayal of the man makes it evident that he used his knowledge of his opponents as part of his strategy against them and did it very effectively.  (My personal favorite, not included in this film, is his summation of McClellan, that that general's biggest problem was that he had made the mistake of bringing himself to the battle.)Although Lee is an important part of the film, the cental character is General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, tightly portrayed by Steven Lang.  A more fitting subject for central stage would be difficult to find.  Like Lee, Jackson was a complex character.  As biography shows, he was a somewhat stiff, rather rigidly religious person, who was intolerant of the foibles of others.  Like many men of the time, his life had been crossed by a number of personal tragedies: a difficult childhood, the loss of his first wife and child, the loss of his first child by his second wife, and the alienation from a sister with whom he had once been very close because of their differences over the war.  A professor of science and artillery at Virginia Military Institute before the war, he was not particularly liked or even respected by his pupils or their families and almost lost his position because of it.  The war in fact gave him a stage upon which to exhibit his true brilliance, military strategy.  As Lee says in the film after Jackson loses his arm in battle, ""Jackson has lost his left arm; I have lost my right,"" as in essence he had.Also giving a fine performance was Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, a schoolmaster who raised a militia and proved particularly skillful as a military man.  He acts as the audience's moral tour guide, quoting extensively from various literary sources popular at the time among the intelligensia.  Also a real person, it's almost too bad that his story was not more fully presented.  What was shown was so tantalizing.A great Civil War reenactment, with stellar performances by Duval, Lang and Daniels.  Rather superficial on the ""hard"" issues, but certainly adequate given the limitations of time and budget.  Impressive cinematography, but CGI portions are a little obvious.  With the above caveats noted, it might make a good instructional film for high school US history students.",4,"Stellar performances by Duval, Lang and Daniels",1065916800,"10 12,

755686,A1RVYSEJCY9BJS,B00009OOFA,A. Thomas,"[10, 10]","Ron Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"" has long been amongst my favorite films. Thus, upon hearing of the production of ""Gods and Generals,"" this time intended for theatrical release from the very beginning and realized with a theatrical budget, I hoped that it would be even better than its predecessor. However, the poor reviews upon its debut discouraged me from viewing the film until several years later, when I found the DVD in the bargain bin for $5.I liked most of what I saw -- certainly the heightened intensity of the battles, Stephen Lang's tour-de-force performance as Jackson -- but I realized that it was not up to par with Maxwell's previous achievement with ""Gettysburg."" The story was too broad and lacked focus, the dialogue was peppered with soliloquies and quotations ad nauseum and reeked of pretense, extremely unconvincing digital matte work that pulls the audience out of the picture, and, more disquieting, the film's treatment/glossing over of the Confederate slaves rang false. I could admire the film for its ambition, but overall ""Gods and Generals"" was a film I had come to tolerate rather than one that I held in high regard.The good news is that this Extended Director's Cut is decidedly better paced than the theatrical version of the film despite increasing its length by a full hour. By splitting the narrative into five acts, Maxwell has created a sense of tighter focus to each of these segments and improved the flow. Furthermore, additions such as Jackson's discovery of Little Sorrel add much needed levity to the proceedings and better develop the narrative and characters, and the inclusion of the Battle of Antietam helps the film feel more complete from a historical perspective. Also, the much-awaited subplot featuring John Wilkes Booth is mostly an enhancement, with Booth functioning like a Greek chorus throughout the picture and the performance of the actor is very well done.The bad news is that ""Gods and Generals"" remains a heavily-flawed film. The majority of the faults described above still apply, and the Booth-as-commentary scenes are occasionally too on-the-nose (especially the Hamlet soliloquy over footage of Antietam's aftermath). If you thoroughly disliked the theatrical version, the Extended Director's Cut is unlikely to win you over, but if you enjoyed the theatrical version, there's more here to enjoy and it is presented in a more well-rounded manner. On a five-star scale, the original cut would earn 3 stars and the Extended Director's Cut would earn 3.5 stars.Having upgraded straight from the DVD, I can't compare this new Blu-ray to that of the theatrical release. The video presentation is somewhat inconsistent; one minute it will look stunning while the next will look soft and mediocre. The audio, however, is spectacular. Regarding special features, the original commentary, featurettes, and music videos are ported over, and a new commentary for the Extended Cut has also been provided, as well as a welcome new HD introduction by Ron Maxwell and Ted Turner where the two men discuss their intentions with their two Civil War epics. The DigiBook packaging, while not as nice as that for ""Gettysburg,"" is still handsome and will look nice on your shelf.All-in-all, this Director's Cut Blu-ray is definitely a step-up from the theatrical version, but it is not a miraculous revelation on the level of the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""The Abyss"" extended cuts. ""Gods and Generals"" remains a respectfully-ambitious-yet-flawed epic on the most contentious period in American history, and for anyone who enjoyed the film in its previous incarnation or who is simply interested in the American Civil War, it comes highly recommended.",4,Director's Cut Improves on the Theatrical Version,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,3692,"['Ron', 'Maxwell', 'Gettysburg', 'long', 'been', 'amongst', 'favorite', 'films', 'Thus', 'hearing', 'production', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'time', 'intended', 'theatrical', 'release', 'very', 'beginning', 'realized', 'theatrical', 'budget', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'predecessor', 'However', 'poor', 'reviews', 'debut', 'discouraged', 'viewing', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'found', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'bin', '5.I', 'liked', 'most', 'what', 'saw', 'certainly', 'heightened', 'intensity', 'battles', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Jackson', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'Maxwell', 'previous', 'achievement', 'Gettysburg', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'broad', 'lacked', 'focus', 'dialogue', 'was', 'peppered', 'soliloquies', 'quotations', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'reeked', 'pretense', 'extremely', 'unconvincing', 'digital', 'matte', 'work', 'audience', 'picture', 'more', 'disquieting', 'film', 'treatment/glossing', 'Confederate', 'slaves', 'rang', 'false', 'could', 'admire', 'film', 'ambition', 'overall', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'come', 'tolerate', 'rather', 'one', 'held', 'high', 'regard.The', 'good', 'news', 'Extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'decidedly', 'better', 'paced', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'increasing', 'length', 'full', 'hour', 'splitting', 'narrative', 'five', 'acts', 'Maxwell', 'created', 'sense', 'tighter', 'focus', 'segments', 'improved', 'flow', 'Furthermore', 'additions', 'such', 'Jackson', 'discovery', 'Little', 'Sorrel', 'add', 'much', 'needed', 'levity', 'proceedings', 'better', 'develop', 'narrative', 'characters', 'inclusion', 'Battle', 'Antietam', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'complete', 'historical', 'perspective', 'Also', 'much-awaited', 'subplot', 'featuring', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'mostly', 'enhancement', 'Booth', 'functioning', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'picture', 'performance', 'actor', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'bad', 'news', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'heavily-flawed', 'film', 'majority', 'faults', 'described', 'still', 'apply', 'Booth-as-commentary', 'scenes', 'are', 'occasionally', 'too', 'on-the-nose', 'especially', 'Hamlet', 'soliloquy', 'footage', 'Antietam', 'aftermath', 'thoroughly', 'disliked', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'unlikely', 'win', 'enjoyed', 'theatrical', 'version', 'more', 'here', 'enjoy', 'presented', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'manner', 'five-star', 'scale', 'original', 'cut', 'would', 'earn', '3', 'stars', 'Extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'would', 'earn', '3.5', 'stars.Having', 'upgraded', 'straight', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'theatrical', 'release', 'video', 'presentation', 'somewhat', 'inconsistent', 'one', 'minute', 'will', 'look', 'stunning', 'next', 'will', 'look', 'soft', 'mediocre', 'audio', 'however', 'spectacular', 'Regarding', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'commentary', 'featurettes', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'ported', 'new', 'commentary', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'also', 'been', 'provided', 'as', 'well', 'welcome', 'new', 'HD', 'introduction', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'discuss', 'intentions', 'two', 'Civil', 'War', 'epics', 'DigiBook', 'packaging', 'not', 'as', 'nice', 'Gettysburg', 'still', 'handsome', 'will', 'look', 'nice', 'shelf.All-in-all', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Blu-ray', 'definitely', 'step-up', 'theatrical', 'version', 'not', 'miraculous', 'revelation', 'level', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Abyss', 'extended', 'cuts', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'respectfully-ambitious-yet-flawed', 'epic', 'most', 'contentious', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'previous', 'incarnation', 'who', 'simply', 'interested', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

These sleek, muscular beasts stood through the task of filming a 220 minute movie and looked great doing it. They whinnied, ran, jumped, bucked, fell marvelously.As far as the movie, dissecting why it is worth only two stars is a challenge in a short space. The horses, I can say, keep it from being one star.""Gods and Generals"" is like bad Shakespeare. Good Shakespearean actors are hard to find, since there is a tendency for everything to come off amateurish, thanks to overacting, inaccurate or overstated accents, and body language that reviles even the most staid and stuff personality.With amazing vistas and meticulously researched and detailed sets, I expected an equal acumen when casting. After Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels, the bar was dropped pretty far.Apparently, the director though it was a good idea to hire Civil War reenactors. Civil War reenactors are those noble, hardworking people putting on shows of various battles. They offer a great service to the education about a tumultuous time in America. They aren't trained actors, and here, in ""Gods and Generals,"" it shows.The reasons for the war are sugarcoated, as are the atrocities within. While Jackson and Lee may have been terrific gentlemen about the sport of war, the average soldiers were often uneducated, uncouth young men advancing the deaths of one another. Sword wounds did not drip lightly, but the war was a gory mess.In reducing this film to PG-13, the directors did something as blandly misleading as CBS' white-bread ""Jesus."" Jesus, as Mel Gibson capably showed us with ""Passion of the Christ"", was whipped into the ground. Similarly, the Civil War had almost 1.0 million casualties. We are provided powerful battles, but somehow the directors managed to avoid the horror. Reality is skipped, and, as result, so is accuracy.Jim, a black cook, is treated with a cliche, ""Yes'suh, whatever you say suh,"" personality. Blacks in general are glazed over as almost nonentities.The ""gods"" part of the title, reflecting on the role of Christian faith within the war, is handled by taking a character, tossing in a Bible quote, and making it look like he had faith. Faith is more rich than that, just as the lack of faith. Atheists and Christians alike were made out to have paper-thin reasoning. This oversight in the midst of trying to make a major point indicates a church history theologian was not consulted in the making of the film.Even the Bob Dylan song was average, and I like him. The extra-feature video of his song, ""Cross the Green Mountain,"" had some intelligent lyrics but felt too Bruce Springsteen-esque.On the DVD is Ted Turner's introduction. He may manage a huge corporation, but he came off like a guy with almost a high school diploma. His presentation was poorly scripted, providing no real information. A historian or major actor should have tackled this one.If you are interested in Civil War reenactments, see one live. At least then, it'll be more believable.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",2,"Bad Shakespeare, Nice Horses",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,3042,"['used', 'fine', 'horses', 'sleek', 'muscular', 'beasts', 'stood', 'task', 'filming', '220', 'minute', 'movie', 'looked', 'great', 'doing', 'whinnied', 'ran', 'jumped', 'bucked', 'fell', 'marvelously.As', 'far', 'movie', 'dissecting', 'why', 'worth', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'challenge', 'short', 'space', 'horses', 'can', 'say', 'keep', 'being', 'one', 'star', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'bad', 'Shakespeare', 'Good', 'Shakespearean', 'actors', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'tendency', 'everything', 'come', 'off', 'amateurish', 'thanks', 'overacting', 'inaccurate', 'overstated', 'accents', 'body', 'language', 'even', 'most', 'staid', 'stuff', 'personality.With', 'amazing', 'vistas', 'meticulously', 'researched', 'detailed', 'sets', 'expected', 'equal', 'acumen', 'when', 'casting', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'bar', 'was', 'dropped', 'pretty', 'far.Apparently', 'director', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'hire', 'Civil', 'War', 'reenactors', 'Civil', 'War', 'reenactors', 'are', 'noble', 'hardworking', 'people', 'putting', 'shows', 'various', 'battles', 'offer', 'great', 'service', 'education', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'America', 'are', ""n't"", 'trained', 'actors', 'here', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'shows.The', 'reasons', 'war', 'are', 'sugarcoated', 'are', 'atrocities', 'Jackson', 'Lee', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'gentlemen', 'sport', 'war', 'average', 'soldiers', 'were', 'often', 'uneducated', 'uncouth', 'young', 'men', 'advancing', 'deaths', 'one', 'Sword', 'did', 'not', 'drip', 'lightly', 'war', 'was', 'gory', 'mess.In', 'reducing', 'film', 'PG-13', 'directors', 'did', 'something', 'blandly', 'misleading', 'CBS', 'white-bread', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'capably', 'showed', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'was', 'whipped', 'ground', 'Similarly', 'Civil', 'War', 'had', 'almost', '1.0', 'million', 'casualties', 'are', 'provided', 'powerful', 'battles', 'somehow', 'directors', 'managed', 'avoid', 'horror', 'Reality', 'skipped', 'result', 'so', 'accuracy.Jim', 'black', 'cook', 'treated', 'cliche', ""Yes'suh"", 'say', 'suh', 'personality', 'Blacks', 'general', 'are', 'glazed', 'almost', 'gods', 'part', 'title', 'reflecting', 'role', 'Christian', 'faith', 'war', 'handled', 'taking', 'character', 'tossing', 'Bible', 'quote', 'making', 'look', 'had', 'faith', 'Faith', 'more', 'rich', 'just', 'lack', 'faith', 'Atheists', 'Christians', 'alike', 'were', 'made', 'out', 'have', 'paper-thin', 'reasoning', 'oversight', 'midst', 'trying', 'make', 'major', 'point', 'church', 'history', 'theologian', 'was', 'not', 'consulted', 'making', 'film.Even', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'song', 'was', 'average', 'like', 'extra-feature', 'video', 'song', 'Green', 'Mountain', 'had', 'intelligent', 'lyrics', 'felt', 'too', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen-esque.On', 'DVD', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'introduction', 'may', 'manage', 'huge', 'corporation', 'came', 'off', 'guy', 'almost', 'high', 'school', 'diploma', 'presentation', 'was', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'providing', 'real', 'information', 'historian', 'major', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'tackled', 'one.If', 'are', 'interested', 'Civil', 'War', 'reenactments', 'see', 'one', 'live', 'least', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'believable.Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

Too many personal stories to keep straight, too much faithfulness to some details of battles (that one may only appreciate if one already knows those details), too many puzzling omissions and elisions.Why nothing on the battle of Antietem?  One moves abruptly to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation without the considerations that determined its timing, or without much context.  If, as Ted Turner says in his intro, this was meant to be in great part a historical lesson, it failed massively in this alone.Finally, though the title of the film reveals much of its bent, it has become very difficult to see ""Stonewall"" Jackson deified without much reference to his full character and acts. (His mortal wounding and death were indeed represented well wrt historical records.)

I can tell it was a labor of love.  You will want to see it if you are 'into' the Civil War, but it's not a good movie in any absolute sense.  It had much the same effect on me as if I had seen a sixth-grade history class perform it:  breathtaking in its sincerity but amateurish in its drama.  Let me say why:The cast: Many of the professionals have become far too long in the tooth for their parts in the 10 years since the filming of `Gettysburg.'  Jeff Daniels, 46, plays Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, age 33.  General Hancock was 37 in the fall of 1861 but Brian Mallon, who plays the part, appears to be at least 10 years older...  Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee is believable but underutilized.  Only Steven Lang as Stonewall Jackson is believable.Similar casting problems plague the smaller parts and the extras as well. The huge majority of the cast, including speaking parts, appear to be non-professionals.  In scenes in which a group of enraptured adjutants are meant to be listening intently to some general, their eyes wander about the scene as though looking for someone in the audience.  The average age of the typical soldier appears to be 45. White-bearded and paunchy, they are doing their very best to generate the spirit of the age, but their age is a constant reminder that we are only play-acting.  It's not their fault.The production.  The computer-graphic shots of Fredericksburg, etc. look very fake.  There are several major lapses in continuity:  for example, in one shot, Lee appears to be overlooking Fredericksburg from the Union side of the river.  Ted Turner appears in cameo in one scene seated a bit to the right of Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall), then in the next shots he is seated behind him.The script.  No wonder this movie is almost four hours long.  Nothing is said once when there is an opportunity to say it twice or four times if possible (`You are the first brigade!  Repeat ad infinitum).  The borrowed phrase `we who are about to die salute thee' appears twice.For all that, however, if you are a war buff you will want to see it.  I thought my 8-year-old fanatic would want to leave at the intermission, but he wasn't having it.  Someday someone will make a movie that conveys the weight, drama, and emotion of the American Civil War, but this movie is not it.",3,"As sincere as can be, but not a good movie",1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,2427,"['mean', 'disrespect', 'thousands', 'Civil', 'War', 're-enactors', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'put', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'are', ""'into"", 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'absolute', 'sense', 'had', 'much', 'same', 'effect', 'had', 'seen', 'sixth-grade', 'history', 'class', 'perform', 'breathtaking', 'sincerity', 'amateurish', 'drama', 'Let', 'say', 'why', 'cast', 'Many', 'professionals', 'have', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'tooth', 'parts', '10', 'years', 'filming', 'Gettysburg', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', '46', 'plays', 'Col.', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'age', '33', 'General', 'Hancock', 'was', '37', 'fall', '1861', 'Brian', 'Mallon', 'who', 'part', 'be', 'least', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'believable', 'underutilized', 'Only', 'Steven', 'Lang', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'believable.Similar', 'casting', 'problems', 'plague', 'smaller', 'parts', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'huge', 'majority', 'cast', 'including', 'speaking', 'parts', 'appear', 'be', 'non-professionals', 'scenes', 'group', 'enraptured', 'adjutants', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'listening', 'intently', 'general', 'eyes', 'wander', 'scene', 'looking', 'someone', 'audience', 'average', 'age', 'typical', 'soldier', 'be', '45', 'White-bearded', 'paunchy', 'are', 'doing', 'very', 'best', 'generate', 'spirit', 'age', 'age', 'constant', 'reminder', 'are', 'only', 'play-acting', 'not', 'fault.The', 'production', 'computer-graphic', 'shots', 'Fredericksburg', 'etc', 'look', 'very', 'fake', 'are', 'several', 'major', 'lapses', 'continuity', 'example', 'one', 'shot', 'Lee', 'be', 'overlooking', 'Fredericksburg', 'Union', 'side', 'river', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'cameo', 'one', 'scene', 'seated', 'bit', 'right', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'then', 'next', 'shots', 'seated', 'him.The', 'script', 'wonder', 'movie', 'almost', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'Nothing', 'said', 'once', 'when', 'opportunity', 'say', 'twice', 'four', 'times', 'possible', 'are', 'first', 'brigade', 'Repeat', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'borrowed', 'phrase', 'who', 'are', 'die', 'salute', 'thee', 'however', 'are', 'war', 'buff', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'thought', '8-year-old', 'fanatic', 'would', 'want', 'leave', 'intermission', 'was', ""n't"", 'having', 'Someday', 'someone', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'weight', 'drama', 'emotion', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'not']",N/A

I bought it on Amazon nearly two years ago and watch it all the time--at least segments of it.  The Thomas Jackson that is presented here is the epitome of manliness and goodness and his characterization (albeit obviously a very idealistic one) embodies everything noble about our lives on this earth.  With Lee and Jackson as the book focus, it is easy to tell a story of grandeur.  These may have been the two finest southerners in history, and, to those who say that this depiction is a manipulation of history, I would counter-argue that they simply are not acquainted with history.  I read Roger Ebert's review and it was absolutely revolting.  Political correctness has no room for the truth and arguments that every picture about The Civil War must include a discussion of slavery are fallacious.  It is like insisting that ""A Bridge Too Far"" must analyze the Holocaust.  Critics like Ebert are fools and ""Gods and Generals"" is one of the few pieces of art from this century that will last and last after all the trendy charlatans who embrace cultural Marxism are long dead.

In my opinion, there are few war films that surpass Gettysburg for epic storytelling and historical fidelity, and I expected the same from this movie.  That having been said, I must say that Gods and Generals lived up to my expectations in nearly every respect.  Granted, since this film covers from the beginning of the war until Chancellorsville (roughly two years), something has been lost in the storytelling, and in fact anyone who does not already know something of this time period will likely be lost in the fast pace in which the first part of this film moves.This movie does an excellent job of depicting the battles of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, and lives up to the reputation of its predecessor (Gettysburg) as far as action sequences go.  The cast does a great job (especially Robert Duvall), but it WAS disappointing to see some characters played by different actors (most notably Longstreet, Stewart, Armisted, Pickett, and Ellis Spear).  Still, the acting was great.Civil War buffs should be right at home with this film, and will have little to clamor about in the way of historical accuracy.  4 hours may be a little to much to bear for the average movie-watcher, but those willing to invest that much time in the film will not be disappointed.

Apparently 107 out of 116 critics who reviewed the film hated it as well.  My wife and I both enjoyed ""Gettysburg"" and looked forward to watching ""Gods and Generals"".  It was one of the worst films we've watched in years.  To be fair, we did endure the whole thing.  They should have re-named it ""The Start of the Civil War as Seen by the South"".  This film portrays the generals from the south as religious zealots (especially Jackson) and the generals from the north as pompous idiots.  This may be historically accurate but most of the film's focus wasted time on just one of these zealots: ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  It was painful watching this delusional idiot who was no better than the religious terrorists we face today.  The highlight of the film was when Jackson was accidentally killed by his own men.

I guess this film proves that historical accuracy is not enough for make a compelling film. Yes, it does have the presence of Robert Duvall, one of my favorite American actors who is so compelling and believable in BROKEN TRAIL.Fortunately, we do have such well-made films about the US Civil War as GLORY, MAJOR DUNDEE, and, as a weak third, COLD MOUNTAIN. Even more fortunate is the fact that we have such superb films about our great country's history in THE NEW WORLD and REVOLUTION. Both of those latter films have been made even better by their release in revised or extended versions. Of course, we also have the literary classic brought with rousing excitement to the screen by Michael Mann in his version of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.All of those above-mentioned films were blessed with having talented directors and equally talented cast members.Except for the appearance of Robert Duvall, GODS AND GENERALS has neither. I am mildly curious about the third film in this series THE LAST FULL MEASURE, but if it is as plodding and as poorly acted as the first two produced by fellow Georgian Ted Turner, than I will forgo that curiosity and leave it unsatisfied. I have seen high school plays with better acting. All of the major characters are constantly being touted by other characters in the film as being flawless and so superhuman that one wonders if these people were thought of as being real people with real human flaws or as merely types -- cardboard at that.Bring back directors of the talent of Sam Peckinpah. We have seen what he did with such films as MAJOR DUNDEE, particularly as released now in its extended version.

""Gettysburg"", while not the strongest film ever produced, is a profound work of art compared to this movie, which attempts to sweep but only slightly brushes an epic story. Stephen Lang, perhaps one of the greatest, if not underappreciated, actors of the past 20 years does a wonderful job in his take on Stonewall Jackson. His performance is worth watching the movie at least once, but you probably won't come back for seconds. Maxwell's film spends so much time developing and following Jackson that other characters come off weak; their performances shallow and lacking depth, as if each actor is struggling to find something to work with. Weak writing, and weak perfomances tend to lessen the work of Lang, who is sucked into a vacuum here. Sadly, his performance will probably be forgotten in the long run as a result. Film making is hard, and Maxwell certainly tries to carry off what is obviously a passion project, but a film strictly on Jackson, or perhaps one that does not try to cover so much ground, might have been a better endeavor.",1,A Complete Disappointment,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,1214,"['Gods', 'Generals', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'not', 'been', 'major', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'released', 'wide', 'audience', 'exception', 'Cold', 'Mountain', '2003', 'Gettysburg', 'not', 'strongest', 'film', 'ever', 'produced', 'profound', 'work', 'art', 'compared', 'movie', 'sweep', 'only', 'slightly', 'epic', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'underappreciated', 'actors', 'past', '20', 'years', 'wonderful', 'job', 'take', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'seconds', 'Maxwell', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'following', 'Jackson', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'weak', 'performances', 'shallow', 'lacking', 'depth', 'actor', 'struggling', 'find', 'something', 'work', 'Weak', 'writing', 'weak', 'perfomances', 'tend', 'lessen', 'work', 'Lang', 'who', 'sucked', 'vacuum', 'here', 'Sadly', 'performance', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'forgotten', 'long', 'run', 'result', 'Film', 'making', 'hard', 'Maxwell', 'certainly', 'carry', 'off', 'what', 'obviously', 'passion', 'project', 'film', 'strictly', 'Jackson', 'perhaps', 'one', 'not', 'try', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'endeavor']",N/A

But going into the fourth hour of this lumbering extravagnaza, one begins to realize these star-crossed Civil War fans needed more vinegar and less sugar. A prequel to the far superior ""Gettysburg,"" Maxwell and company (including producer Ted Turner) bit off far more than they could chew, stuffing the beginnings of the Civil War and three major battles into one extremely muddled film.I suppose the most glaring weakness of ""God and Generals"" was the overall low-budget quality. Crowd scenes are forced, battle scenes are stilted and shots of re-enactors cheering resemble old home movies. The odd casting choices will also cause viewers to scratch their heads. It is abundantly clear the filmmakers sought unity with the film ""Gettysburg,"" re-casting many of the same actors in their former roles (Jeff Daniels, C. Thomas Howell). So one wonders why Stephen Lang, who played the role of Pickett in ""Gettysburg,"" was cast in the role of Stonewall Jackson in ""Gods and Generals."" Lang is a terrific actor, and he gives a splendid performance in this film. It's hard to imagine there were not other actors available for this meaty role.I also had problems - and I can't believe I am going to say this - with Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee. It is one of the few times in this actor's historic career in which he gives a weak performance. I truly believe Martin Sheen was far more vibrant and alive in the same role in ""Gettysburg."" And the list goes on. Jeff Daniels seemingly sleepwalking in the role of Joshua Chamberlain - a role in which he gave the finest performance of his career in ""Gettysburg."" A weak musical score (Bob Dylan?!) also detracts, which is odd because another highlight of ""Gettysburg"" was the splendid music by Randy Edelman.Several scenes also feel so staged as to be gag-inducing. Lang certainly sinks his teeth into the role of Jackson, but his constant prayers to the Lord Almighty eventually become forced and tiresome. These scenes come off as hammy as a 19th century play. If this was intended by the filmmakers, it was a severe miscalculation.Eventually, ""Gods and Generals"" must be termed un unfocused mess. The filmmakers tackled more than they could handle, jumping from one battle to another, threading it along with staged scenes in an attempt to redefine the public's perception about this brutal war. A tighter screenplay and a focus on one specific battle would have aided this leaky tugboat of a movie.The same filmmakers who gave us the noble and spiritually uplifting ""Gettysburg"" also gave us ""Gods and Generals.""

Booth--This is really good stuff because Maxwell underplays one of the most identifiable villians in American history.Maxwell reimagines Booth as a somewhat efeminant,insignificant character,who,at this point,doesn't have a story or a purpose,because we already know him and his oncoming crime against the country.Chris Conner does a really good job as Booth.Maxwell does not let the Booth character radiate evil,as you would expect,Booth does not seem special from a legendary standpoint.His good looks draws women,groupie like.He is considered a good actor from a great family of actors.Maxwell uses Booth as a backdrop to the giant story at hand.He is ominous because we know we have not seen the last of him.3)The way the film is divided into 5 parts,gives you a sense of where you are in the grand scheme of things to come.4)The preaching is held to a minimum5)The beautiful little added  scene,which introduces us to a new,historical,essetial character,Jackson's horse  ""Little Sorrell""6)In the extended version I sensed an integrity,a diligence to detail,which lends itself to the intensity of watching the film.7)GG Ext. Version is a great,long,flawed movie,throw out the theatrical version,This is about as good as GG can be....8)It is too bad the 3rd part of the trilogy was scrapped.I have a feeling Maxwell was in the process of bringing all the loose ends together so as to make his epic trilogy as one,as he maintains the end of the civil war was symbolized not by a surrender at Appomattox but by the Union bullet that struck J.W. Booth in the throat killing him,as he hid in a barn in Virginia.It was the largest manhunt in US history.It is too bad for us that Maxwell could not fimish his cinematic vision of the Civil War.The concluding movie would have probably made us aware of the greatness of the whole project relative to the first and second parts,and the unmade third part.",4,G&G Revisited or I Got What I Wished For.....,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2802,"['would', 'not', 'say', 'disliked', 'theatrical', 'version', 'GG.The', 'film', 'seemed', 'uneven', 'cut', 'up', 'interiors', 'were', 'too', 'perfect', 'clean', 'too', 'freshly', 'painted', 'more', 'inside', 'non-existent', 'sit-com', 'houses', 'exteriors', 'were', 'too', 'neatly', 'trimmed', 'be', 'set', 'time', 'lawn', 'mowers', 'bush-hogs', 'sets', 'were', 'too', 'back-lotish', 'looking', 'computer', 'imagery', 'battlefields', 'towns', 'seen', 'distance', 'lacked', 'detail', 'realism.The', 'film', 'had', 'lots', 'ground', 'cover', 'order', 'get', 'settled', 'ready', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'attempt', 'give', 'Civil', 'War', 'three', 'parts.The', 'extended', 'version', 'GG', 'just', 'yes', 'long,280', 'minutes', 'be.The', 'added', 'scenes', 're-editing', 'better', 'more', 'informing', 'more', 'instructional', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'rest', 'trilogy.Liked:1', 'shere', 'evergy', 'scope', 'film', 'awesome', 'confederate', 'sneak', 'attack', 'Chancellorsville', '2', 'meet', 'J.W', 'Booth', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'Maxwell', 'one', 'most', 'identifiable', 'villians', 'American', 'history.Maxwell', 'reimagines', 'Booth', 'somewhat', 'efeminant', 'insignificant', 'character', 'who', 'point', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'purpose', 'already', 'know', 'oncoming', 'crime', 'country.Chris', 'Conner', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Booth.Maxwell', 'not', 'let', 'Booth', 'character', 'radiate', 'evil', 'would', 'expect', 'Booth', 'not', 'seem', 'special', 'legendary', 'standpoint.His', 'good', 'looks', 'draws', 'women', 'groupie', 'like.He', 'considered', 'good', 'actor', 'great', 'family', 'actors.Maxwell', 'Booth', 'backdrop', 'giant', 'story', 'hand.He', 'ominous', 'know', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'last', 'him.3', 'way', 'film', 'divided', '5', 'parts', 'sense', 'where', 'are', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'come.4', 'preaching', 'held', 'minimum5', 'beautiful', 'little', 'added', 'scene', 'new', 'historical', 'essetial', 'character', 'Jackson', 'horse', 'Little', 'Sorrell', '6', 'extended', 'version', 'sensed', 'integrity', 'diligence', 'detail', 'intensity', 'watching', 'film.7', 'GG', 'Ext', 'Version', 'great', 'long', 'flawed', 'movie', 'throw', 'out', 'theatrical', 'version', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'GG', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'bad', '3rd', 'part', 'trilogy', 'was', 'scrapped.I', 'have', 'feeling', 'Maxwell', 'was', 'process', 'bringing', 'loose', 'together', 'so', 'make', 'epic', 'trilogy', 'one', 'end', 'civil', 'war', 'was', 'symbolized', 'not', 'surrender', 'Appomattox', 'Union', 'bullet', 'struck', 'J.W', 'Booth', 'throat', 'killing', 'barn', 'Virginia.It', 'was', 'largest', 'manhunt', 'US', 'history.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Maxwell', 'could', 'not', 'fimish', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'concluding', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'made', 'aware', 'greatness', 'whole', 'project', 'relative', 'first', 'second', 'parts', 'unmade', 'third', 'part']",N/A

Basically the negatives that are levied against this movie seem to pretty much come down to the following groups of people/concerns:1) Those that take offense with the religious (i.e. Christian) overtones.MY RESPONSE: I personally find this one amusing.  There are some who seem to think this is a pro-Christian movie that is trying bash people over the head with Christianity.  Let me tell you something:  I am a Christian and try to take my faith seriously, and I have AVOIDED showing this movie to unbelievers because I actually believe it can conceivably leave some people with a NEGATIVE view towards Christianity.  Yes this movie does periodically explore religious motivations and thoughts of some of the characters.  But it shows those motivations on BOTH sides (both North and South) - you get to see BOTH sides talking about how they believe God is on their side and for their cause!  I don't get what's so wrong with a film showing this and exploring the religious angle a bit, because you KNOW - especially at that time - that religion most certainly DID play a major role on both sides, with many on both sides believing that God would help them win the victory, etc.  Although much of the faith stuff is centered around Gen. Jackson (South) which generally does show Christianity in a favorable light as we see how his strong faith helped him and was a great comfort to him both on the battlefield and in his dying days, there are some points which don't do so as well, such as one where Jackson responds something along the lines that he wants to just kill all the enemy - ""every last one of them"" kind of thing (this may only be in the extended cut of the film, I can't remember).  That certainly doesn't mesh that well with the type of ""Christianity"" I'd like portrayed to non-believers.  We also see Jackson as a Christian praying for an unbelieving dying general stating something like ""I'll believe for the two of us since you don't believe"".  Any Christian that's read their Bible knows that's not how it works.Plus, it shows a more ""liberal"" type of Christianity with how it's portrayed with Chamberlain (North) as compared to Jackson, so it's portrayal of Christianity is kind of mixed and not consistent anyway.Personally, as a Christian, yes I did find this film to be affirming to me in my faith because of Jackson.  I saw the same peace and comfort that Jackson seemed to have and know from his faith in Jesus, as I have in mine.But I can easily see an unbeliever watching this film coming away just thinking that all the Christianity stuff (and indeed religion in general) is nuts since both sides had people that believed in God and believed God was for them, and at the end of the day, war is an ugly ugly thing with lots and lots of people dead.  It's a very flawed argument in my view, but I can easily see people coming to such a conclusion.  Thus I don't see this as the great big ""Christian evangelism"" film that by the way some people talk (including many Christians) one might think it is.  And those non-Christians that are supposedly so offended by this film, I just don't get it.Further, given the total runtime of the movie, the religious statements are actually quite few all things considered, so it seems to me most people could just look past this anyway if they really don't care what the characters thought in the religious sphere.(2) Somewhat related to number 1, there are those that believe that this should have been more like Gettysburg (which has a more documentary-type feel).  These people mostly seem to be the Civil War History nuts who know every last date and battle and want a film that completely and utterly just portrays all the historical facts.  They could care less about any ""drama"" - these people scoff at the scenes such as occur between a little girl and General Jackson in the movie.  They don't really care much about humanizing the people.MY RESPONSE: One of the absolute strengths of this movie in my opinion is that it is NOT just about facts and battles, but actually takes you into the realm of motivations, thoughts, feelings of the people involved - making them REAL people and not just some glossed-over ""fact"" on a page.  If I wanted to see a documentary on the Civil War and see every battle and every person involved, I'd watch one on the History Channel or something.  But if you, like me, want to see a Hollywood MOVIE that has stunning visuals/audio, that also by most accounts is pretty historically accurate with what it shows, this is the best one I've seen!Some people felt the filmmakers tried to show too much in the movie and thus went too many directions - which thus made it seem ""boring"".  I never felt that way - it kept my attention all the way through and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ironically many of the people that have levied this criticism of the movie, like the Extended Edition better (which is actually an hour longer) because they feel it is more complete than the original by setting up scenes better and including things such as Antietam.  Personally, although I like the extended edition, I DID start to find myself getting bored a tiny bit with it and can see WHY Antietam was cut from the original - its inclusion made the film ""drag on"" a bit for me.  I realize from a historical perspective that Antietam was important.  But from a theatrical movie perspective, given the other battle scenes in the movie, I understand why they originally cut it out and I don't fault them for it.  The whole added ""Booth"" subplot of the extended edition, while intriguing, is largely a waste to me unless they ever make that long-mentioned 3rd film and tie that in.  And the added ""chapter"" divisions actually kind of annoyed me a bit by taking away some from the ""flowing movie"" feel.  Between the extended edition and the theatrical, although I enjoyed the extended, I actually think I prefer the theatrical.3) Those that believe it is too far out of balance and believe it is too pro-South, not ""anti-slavery"" enough, too focused on a few specific people, etc.MY RESPONSE: While this movie does go against the politically-correct flow a bit, that's part of what MAKES this movie such a great film!  Yes, it does explore the Southern side heavier than the North, but plenty of other films explore the North's position much more than the South.  Most of us already have been told a lot about the North's positions - what's wrong with exploring the South a bit more??  And this movie DOES showcase the North as well (even more so in the extended edition).Yes, it focused on only a few individuals.  But it used those individuals to try to help showcase what was going on on an individual level with people at that time.  Why can't people just accept that for what it is??  If you are expecting this movie to be a documentary on the first few years of the war, you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are looking to see a cinematic movie that while exploring some of the events of the first few years of the war, delves deeper into the ""human element"", this does that very well.It is true that slavery, while still clearly mentioned and portrayed as an evil in the film, is not directly shown with the few black characters in the film to be personally horrible by experience to them.  We do see some of the blacks and the whites in the South getting along (and even liking one another) which the PC police would have you believe could never have happened.  And yes that does bother some people that believe that the whole war was just all about slavery and that everyone in the South were giant meanies who hated all blacks and treated them like dirt (and that all blacks in the South were treated like dirt) and that everyone in the North were fighting solely for the blacks.  This film does mess with that commonly accepted narrative a bit, by showing that in reality things might have been a bit more complex than that...SUMMARY: If a person is not willing to consider on a deeper human level some of the thoughts and feelings that might have been going on at that time (and for which indeed historically can be shown DID go on at that time) that one is not taught in your standard history class, including religious thoughts and motivations, then I guess one could really take offense at this film.  And if a person is expecting this film to show every battle and person involved in the first few years of the war and be balanced between the Northern and Southern views, then a person would have a problem with this film and probably find it boring (not enough ""battle action"" and too much drama)But if a person can just take it for what it is: A Cinematic movie that tells some stories that provide some insight into historical events of the first few years of the Civil War, I don't think you'll be disappointed and can easily count this among one of the better films you've seen!BLU-RAY review: Finally, specifically regarding the Blu-Ray Extended Edition quality, which is what this review is listed under: Overall I found it perfectly fine for a Blu-Ray. The picture quality was generally detailed and clear, though inconsistent. The color ""vibrancy"" and warmth seemed to be lacking as compared to the theatrical DVD (i.e. on my Sony t.v. with default settings the DVD actually looked better as far as the warmth of the color), but since most all t.v.'s can tweak the color settings, this isn't a huge deal.  I can't comment on surround sound, since I've only got a stereo setup, but for what it's worth, it sounded great in stereo with no noticeable problems with the mix.  All in all, I did prefer watching this in Blu-Ray.  As to whether the extended edition is worth purchasing, I would say yes, but I think I do personally prefer the theatrical a bit more (see #2 above for more info on why).",5,Excellent Film Provides

It looks like the authors took advantage of the former experience in many ways. Battle scenes look better and rythm (what I consider the weak point of Gettysburg) is faster. What I like mostly in Gods and Generals is the ethical deepening of its characters and Stonewall Jackson especially. It is not only the performance of S. Lang. Script and dialogues are 1st rate. The result is a movie that is not only entertaining but a lesson of life too. The sympathy for the reb cause is evident and the reasons of the secession are not deepened like we may expect but Gods and Generals has the merit to open a dialogue on the crucial question of freedom and democracy.

The lulls are just too long for a film that goes over 3 1/2 hours.What's very impressive about this movie was (1) not overdone violence; (2) beautiful cinematography; (3) an unusual and refreshing reverence for God, the Bible and Christian thought and (4) a better portrayal by Robert Duvall of Robert E. Lee than Martin Sheen's version in ""Gettsyburg.""On the point 3, all it was - to those atheists/agnostics who were offended by Jackson's reverence - was showing an accurate portrayal of how people thought and believed back then in the south. That's simply the way it was and the way people viewed everyday life, though Biblical standards and language. So kudos, to the filmmakers here for at least giving us an accurate description of the times, even though they probably don't share those beliefs. Of course, the critics - almost all of them secular - hated the film.One thing I did miss from ""Gettysburg"" was a bigger role from Jeff Daniels, who was so good as ""Col.Chamberlain.""

Randall ""Dylan61""","[8, 17]","My greatest fear of films like ""Gods and Generals"" is that there is a history teacher out there somewhere showing their students this movie and telling them that this is what the Civil War was like.Creative liberties asside, This movie is way too long.  It probably could have been about an hour long if they would have cut out all the irrelevant Hollywood mumbo jumbo.  Scene after scene tries to get you to identify with characters and understand their reasons for entering the war.  I get it already.  I don't have to see Stonewall Jackson spout out another ten minute prayer to understand that he's religious.Part of the problem with this movie is that it tries to make everyone look like they were fighting this war for all the right reasons.  That way you'll feel really bad when they die.  It don't think that the Civil War was always that heroic and simple.Now maybe they toned the violence down to get a PG-13 rating, but a movie about the Civil War is not a place to do that.  Every time someone gets shot in this movie, they die instantly and painlessly.  It wasn't that painless in reality and  I think showing it that way takes away from the horror of the war that claimed more americans than any other.My final criticism is that the fake beards used in this movie were absolutely terrible.  There were scenes where I couldn't pay attention to what the characters were saying because I was too busy stareing at the aweful beards on the actors faces.  Some of them actually looked like they were coming off.  The actors have these smooth, young faces and a beard that would take five years to grow.

First the highlights: it is lavishly depicted with no expense spared for sets or accoutrements. Visually it is very appealing. Also, the cast is respectable although it is hardly Robert Duvalls' or Jeff Daniel's finest cinematic performance. Also, the focus on Stonewall helps to expand our view of a man with numerous odd quirks, yet still the best military tactician our country has every produced (and yes, where is that recounting of the Shenandoah Campaign?). What made the movie tedious was the endless pontificating and recitation of classical poetry and recounting of Caesarean battle history as the soldiers marched off to war. This is a very stylized view of history, viewed in distant perspective and altogether influenced too much by monuments and the need to portray the greatness of these legendary men. It is not so much a movie as it is a viewing of the oversized characters on Stone Mountain (Lee and Jackson, but not Davis) come to life, moving and sermonizing their way across the silver screen. Clearly, the movie makers took the title literally; these are not men, but Civil War leaders who are indeed Gods and Generals. Finally, I disagree with other viewers who found this movie less tainted by political correctness. I found it to be an overly politically correct view of the Civil War.

Sometimes sequels just have too much to live up to.This is an example of just about every bad quality I've mentioned. It doesn't outright stink and suck, nor does it leave you cross-eyed with perplexion or indifference, either. But it doesn't really inspire any particular feelings for you at all, really. Positive or negative.""Gods and Generals"" is a movie that might be perfect for recovering war veterans in trauma wards. A movie that moves on a quiet, comatose pace. ""Gods and Generals,"" a prequel to the famed and magnificent ""Gettysburg"" has little or no energy. Everyone just appears to be back to set things up for ""Gettysburg.""This whole movie is a 2 1/2 hour set-up for a punch line we've already seen---with nothing happening or really going on here.Oh, I'm not saying it's horribly made. It's put together with skill---the whole look and sound of the civil war. It might be the kind of movie that would be shown in a history class.It's complete with big-name actors like Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall in full civil war garb and giving famous and poetic quotes as if they're striking a pose. They appear to be posing throughout the entire movie. It's a civil war re-enactment.But they're just goofin' like any other group of men doing a civil war re-enactment.There is one real battle sequence where everybody lines up and charges to die and to kill. The body count begins to pile up---like ANY war movie worth it's salt should.... but it doesn't capture the true stink and ugliness of war in a ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Braveheart"" sort of way, or even the original ""Gettysburg.""Perhaps because all those were R-rated movies and this movie doesn't want to lose it's PG-13 movie, it's more about poetic stories and makes the civil war a backdrop for all this.At least in my opinion, the actual problem with the fact this movie runs at the pace of a comatose snail. Still waters run deep?

However, there were also brillant minds in Union colors who understood and caught on to Jackson's ways. This explains his death.To me the focal point of this film is to demonstrate how determined the south was to continue to fight and also portray the specific way in which their cause was justified. The director showed many simply defending their homes. That was something never done on film before, and for that we should all give Maxwell the credit he deserves. If this film does anything, it convinced me that the Civil War was the most difficult experience Americans ever faced.",5,"""This, our second War of Independence""",1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1196,"['attempt', 'here', 'clear', 'up', 'confusion', 'film', 'created', 'think', 'many', 'there', 'need', 'take', 'blinders', 'look', 'movie', 'what', 'trying', 'portray', 'victorious', 'south', 'Prior', 'Gettysburg', 'Confederates', 'had', 'won', 'many', 'battles', 'had', 'proven', 'resolve', 'well', 'better', 'funded', 'North', 'addition', 'were', 'lead', 'brillant', 'military', 'general', 'Thomas', 'Jackson', 'Stonewall', 'represented', 'not', 'only', 'strength', 'Southern', 'cause', 'also', 'tactical', 'ability', 'strategy', 'Lee', 'always', 'lacked', 'Jackson', 'Lee', 'knew', 'had', 'upper', 'hand', 'Federal', 'Army', 'However', 'were', 'also', 'brillant', 'minds', 'Union', 'colors', 'who', 'understood', 'caught', 'Jackson', 'ways', 'death.To', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'determined', 'south', 'was', 'continue', 'fight', 'also', 'portray', 'specific', 'way', 'cause', 'was', 'justified', 'director', 'showed', 'many', 'simply', 'defending', 'homes', 'was', 'something', 'never', 'done', 'film', 'should', 'give', 'Maxwell', 'credit', 'film', 'anything', 'convinced', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'experience', 'Americans', 'ever', 'faced']",N/A
755726,A2UEYNUWKVOYPU,B00009OOFA,"Daniel D. Vander Haar ""movie history survivor""","[3, 5]","The movie 'Gods And Generals' is the  second of a Civil War trilogy, based on the works of Jeff Shaara and his father Michael Shaara, and is a prequil to the movie 'Gettysburg.' This movie seemed to be either loved or hated by the public, and one person I talked to said his wife found the movie confusing. This is not surprising considering the general lack of knowledgeof American history. When Jay Leno goes 'Jaywalking' and asks people basic questions such as who was George Washington, many people do not know. But there may be another reason for the dislike of the movie. 'Gods and Generals' flies in the face of our drive to be politically correct. In an age when people try to regulate God to the sidelines, and make it seem as if people of faith are all extremists, here we have a film about a group of men and women whose references to God, faith, a heavenly confidence, the Savior, the Bible, etc., overflowed in their words and letters. In fact, it would be safe to say that letters from the Civil War era are often saturated with religious expression even in ways we are not familiar with, no matter howstrong our religious fervor. Such was the case back in the 1860s, and often less attention was given to the very battles that threatened to take their lives.So imagine going to see this movie and expecting a nice Civil War tale, only to find its key figures quoting from the Bible, giving thanks to God for victories, encouraging each other to pray ""if it be thy will,"" and having a confidence that in life or in death a person belongs to God. Surely, this cannot be, since we are told that we have a separation of church and state,or we don't want to offend anyone with our beliefs, or that religious expression by past leaders is simply myth. The film is not pushing religion, but is simply expressing the nature of the main characters. This is in stark contrast to so many Hollywood historical films, where a 1990s era morality is imposed on characters from 1865, so that any married woman from that timeperiod will naturally take off her clothes and hop in bed with anyone she sees. According to Hollywood, there is not one chaste woman from the mid 19th Century. It seems it is better to be immoral than to be moral.Perhaps another reason why a person might find this film confusing, is that these people were living in confusing times. Why would the South fight to defend their own freedom, while denying that right to others--their slaves? And did the North even have the right to force the South to stay in the Union when they wanted out? After all, our Declaration of Independence clearly says that, ""....whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."" It also says, "" But when a long train ofabuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."" It would seem that the rights provided by our Founding Fathers were not the same rights applied to the South. In the end, the North wanted to preserve the Union, and the South wanted their States' Rights,with no interference from Washington, let alone an invasion. To add to the confusion, there were families and relatives in both the North and The South who fought against each other. And what is an immigrant supposed to do when an Irish Brigade from the North is ordered to attack a Southern Irish Brigade?To add to the confusion, Northern and Southern pickets, each guarding a side of the river, would often meet half way to trade coffee for tobacco. And how does a Union soldier explain to his commanding officer why he walked over to the Confederate side for an evening of card playing? That would be enough to get your hand and foot shot off. If these two sides were enemies, weren'tthey supposed to hate each other?For the rest of us, who may have a more balanced view of religion in American history, this film is refreshing. The battle sequences are very well done, and what is interesting here is how the leading characters have a social life outside of their army life. Unlike the movie 'Gettysburg,' where all of the attention was focused on either the battle or plans around acampfire for the next day's battle, we see the tender side of these warriors, who can go from a tender husband and lover of children, to having an attitude of almost cold duty to deserters as well as the enemy. As a result, we see these people as being very human, and having to do often impossible jobs that they would look back as unbelievable.And there is the human ineptness of some Generals--hardly gods--that got their men killed for no reason. The Union Forces were once on the outskirts of Fredericksburg unopposed. All they had to do was cross the river, take the town and high ground, and wait for Robert E. Lee. This should have been simple, but instead the Union Commander decided to wait for some boats toarrive, and by the time the boats arrived, The Southern Army had fortified the city. Now the Union Forces had to build their bridges under enemy fire, fight in the town building to building and street to street, and then charge across an open field against Confederate soldiers protected by a stonewall. All of this is expertly handled on film. So much slaughter. Six hundred thousand men on both sides--about as many as the rest of our wars put together. No wonder soldiers were pinned down andused the dead bodies of their comrades as protection from the incoming bullets. And yes, you do see and hear the bullets plunk into the dead bodies that are used for protection.What is a great aid to this film is that all the scenes were filmed on location whenever possible. The town of Harper's Ferry served as Fredericksberg, and as a result the film makers had at their disposal an entire town with the original Civil War era buildings still in place. They even had empty lots upon which to add the buildings that would be blown up to show the results of a town being shelled.The dvd is also loaded with extras, and once you are done watching this nearly four hour movie, you can easily spend another 90 minutes if not more watching some of the dvd documentaries.So why did the South loose the war? Perhaps it was because of their mistaken assumption that the South was on the same par as the Kingdom of God, and to fight for one was to fight for the other. Then there is the fact that the cream of Southern leadership were killed in battle. Then there are the lackof resources. After nearly two years of fighting, you would think an army would be adequately supplied by that time, but still soldiers were marching without shoes. Then there is the chaos of the Confederacy. How does a government order a war draft, while at the same time not interfering in state's rights?Perhaps the bottom line is that the South never really had achance. They had no cannon factories, and largely relied on older technology for firepower. It was really a question of who would outlast each other--the North that suffered defeat after defeat after defeat in the first couple of years of the war, or the South, which was always lacking anything needed to fight a war--except spirit.'Gods and Generals' takes the viewer through these opening years of the war when fighting a battle was more of a guessing game by untried and untrained troops. Who would ever guess that as much of a slaughter as these opening years of the war were, they would only get worse, as the North would go on to lose 50,000 men in 1864 alone. That will be the subject of the next CivilWar film, 'The Last Full Measure."" Both sides gave it all they had, and 'Gods and Generals'  does about a good a job as one could hope for in getting the story right. This is a rarity in Hollywood, which tends to print legends over facts. Still, the movie is four hours long, and even then it skips over details.",4,Gods and Generals: real history,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,8182,"['movie', ""'Gods"", 'Generals', 'second', 'Civil',

I was looking forward to seeing it because I liked Gettysburg and I thought it would be at least as good.  I saw this movie with a friend and when it was over all we could do is look at each other and chuckle.  &quot;I payed $9.50 for this?&quot;  This is not a movie about the Civil War.  This is a movie about Gen Jackson and how he prays all the time.  I know people are religious and war makes them more so.  I know Jackson and many men on both sides of the war prayed and asked for divine guidance as their soldiers killed and died on the battlefield.  But come on!  Jackson says a prayer in almost every scene and he even has one extra hokey prayer with a slave asking God why there is slavery.  If Jackson would have thought about it for a few minutes he might have figured out that people had slaves because numbskulls like Jackson were willing to fight to protect the political institutions that fostered and supported slavery.  I think this film was an attempt to rehabilitate the Southern cause and make it more noble.  Every attempt was made to strip away the issue of slavery from the motives of the Southern cause and generals.  Big speaches are given about &quot;States Rights&quot; &quot;sovereignity&quot; and &quot;revolution.&quot;  Only the damn Yankees worry about slavery when they make their long speaches.  But why were the Southerners worried about Yankee encroachment on their &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;sovereignity&quot;?  Were they worried that the Northerners would make them speak with a Boston accent or stop drinking mint julips?  No the ONLY issue they were worried about was the institution of slvery.  They felt that the States had a &quot;right&quot; to allow slavery and the &quot;sovereignity&quot; to have slavery, and that God had given them the &quot;right&quot; by His divine approval in the Bible for the institution of slavery (as a positive social good as John C. Calhoun would say.) Seeing Gen Jackson standing there with a slave as they both pray to God about slavery was just too much for me to take.  Maybe that is why God let the North kick the crap out of the South in the Civil War.  The North was right, the South was wrong, the end.  I cannot recommend this movie.  And in case you are wondering, My Great Great Grandfather fought for the South in the Civil War.  He was a poor farmer and did not own one slave.  But he got shot by the Yankees and died of his wounds after the war in 1868.",1,Should have been called &quot;Gen.

Baer,"[2, 6]","An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic ballads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine.GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could.True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place.The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself.  But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die.Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances.Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain.'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'.The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves.This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest.",4,the blood of one's brothers,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2402,"['almost', 'endearing', 'stiltedness', 'undergirds', 'fine', 'film', 'narrative', 'set', 'pieces', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'order', 'allow', 'characters', 'deliver', 'solemn', 'speeches', 'may', 'appear', 'artificial', 'even', 'insincere', 'modern', 'movie-viewers', 'dramatic', 'technique', 'least', 'as', 'old', 'Homer', 'ILIAD', 'ODYSSEY', 'What', 'GODS', 'GENERALS', 'shares', 'ancient', 'poetic', 'ballads', 'celebration', 'fighting', 'man', 'nobility', 'rage', 'juxtaposition', 'profoundly', 'ordinary', 'human', 'sentiment', 'most', 'inhumane', 'deeds', 'one', 'can', 'imagine.GODS', 'AND', 'GENERALS', 'tone', 'deep', 'sadness', 'director', 'way', 'highlighting', 'tragedy', 'war', 'fought', 'brothers', 'nation', 'founding', 'fathers', 'achieved', 'political', 'miracle', 'cost', 'leaving', 'issue', 'slavery', 'unresolved', 'was', 'bound', 'raise', 'head', 'union-threatening', 'manner', 'eventually', 'events', '1861-1865', 'were', 'bursting', 'wound', 'had', 'festered', 'as', 'long', 'Lincoln', 'took', 'nation', 'war', 'matter', 'union', 'preservation', 'was', 'slavery', 'vastly', 'different', 'social', 'visions', 'placed', 'union', 'danger', 'first', 'place.The', 'film', 'trajectory', 'General', 'Lee', 'more', 'prominently', 'Virginia', ""'Stonewall"", 'Jackson', 'latter', 'preferred', 'eponym', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'brigade', 'led', 'not', 'grateful', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'other', 'way', 'Jackson', 'would', 'be', 'Manassas', 'would', 'die.Robert', 'Duvall', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'do', 'characters', 'proud', 'perhaps', 'Duvall', 'General', 'Lee', 'who', 'most', 'rings', 'true', 'man', 'decency', 'calm', 'painful', 'array', 'allegiances.Mira', 'Sorvino', 'briefly', 'up', 'screen', 'Maine', 'Lieutenant', 'Coronel', 'Chamberlain', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Fanny', 'Chamberlain', 'one', 'characters', 'early', 'heard', 'say', 'sum', 'evils', 'reputed', 'provocation', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'most', 'dreadful', ""mistake'.The"", 'achievement', 'GODS', 'AND', 'GENERALS', 'show', 'waging', 'war', 'sometimes', 'most', 'decent', 'men', 'who', 'times', 'find', 'fratricide', 'thrust', 'carrying', 'dreadfulness', 'predicament', 'graves.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'care', 'formation', 'American', 'republic', 'city', 'hill', 'nonethess', 'found', 'bloody', 'water', 'lapping', 'gates', 'staining', 'streets', 'drowning', 'numbers', 'finest']",N/A

I say 'Seriously interested', because it's nearly four hours long, and much of that time is taken up with speeches, rather than action.I can find only one shortcoming in the movie--it doesn't cover Antietam. Rumor has it that the battle was shot (no pun intended) and will be released a part of an even longer version of the movie at some point in the future. I came away from this movie feeling that I knew Stonewall Jackson, and I was blown away by Robert Duvall's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought he did a far better job than Martin Sheen did in 'Gettysburg'.One reviewer on this page harrumphed that 'Gods and Generals' is the first film to cover what the Civil War was really about. I think that reviewer missed a very important point. The war was about different things to the North and the South. Of course the South wasn't fighting a war to preserve slavery. Slavery was dead, and most Southerners new it. A surprising number of Southerners were opposed to it on the same moral grounds as their Northern neighbors. But they resented like hell having a bunch of Yankees telling them what to do.To the North, the war really was about slavery, as any school child north of the Mason-Dixon line knows. Lincoln tried his best to confine the issue to preservation of the Union, but he was forced to issue the Emancipation Proclamation to keep Northern support.'Gods and Generals' has been criticized for a supposedly pro-Southern bias. If you grew up in the North, it does offer a glimpse of how Southerners view the war. There's a reference elsewhere on this page to the war having been referred to at the time as 'the Rebellion'. But those who grew up in the South will recall the old-timers referring to it as 'the Late Unpleasantness'.

In particular the battles presented in the movie are First Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The battles happened from July 1861 to May 1863. The feel I got from the movie was that these battles took place over a much shorter period of time (even though the movie includes a little date stamp at the bottom of the screen prior to each battle).Historically, the movie provides an adequate rendering of the events in question. Consider that Gods and Generals presents three battles and an attempted wartime biography of Thomas Jackson in a period of about 4 hours, whereas Gettysburg presents a single battle in about the same time. Details had to be cut and liberties taken, but aside from a somewhat choppy feeling at times, the movie comes off fairly well. The picture and sound are well done.

Very much like the fate of the Army of the Potomac, it is a tragedy that so little was accomplished over so much time by the people at the head of this effort, considering the outstanding raw material they had to work with.The flaws have been catalogued and commented on by other reviewers.  I will confine myself to saying that this depiction of Stonewall Jackson is downright bizarre.  Not eccentric.  Bizarre.  It is utterly unlike any account of the man that I have ever read.The obvious and important thread between this movie and the vastly superior _Gettysburg_ is the inclusion of the character of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, his brother, Tom, and ""Buster"" Kilrain-- along with the 20th Maine.  This is, of course, consistent with the novel and viewers can be thankful for such a merciful distraction.If you are to derive any enjoyment of this film at all, you will need to focus on certain scenes.The candid talk between Chamberlain and his wife Fanny tracks with what we can know of such an intimate relationship.  It is also a showcase for Mira Sorvino who, in a few minutes, outshines virtually every other performer in this film.The Battle of Fredericksburg is the most watchable of the three battles covered, though I do not recall ever reading of the Irish Brigade retiring in disorder after being shot to pieces on Marye's Heights.

My feeling is that the directer did not know exactly what he was going for. Was it a film about Stonewall Jackson, or civil war leadership in general? Because the directer did not know, the film lacks focus. If it is about military leadership in the Virginia theater, it did a poor job: too much Jackson, not enough Lee, Longstreet, Hooker, or Burnside, AND NO McClellan???? If it was only about Jackson (which I think it was)than I have two questions:1) Why is Jeff Daniels's ""Joshua Chamberlain"" even in this movie? Chamberlain only becomes inportant to the war at Gettysburg. It seems to me that he's only in there so PC-Hollywood would not cry too hard about a ""pro-Confederate"" story. If the film highlighted McClellan, Hooker, or Burnside, failures all, than the Yankees would have looked bad, instead noble but inconsequential Joshua Chamberlain was used. Critics trashed the ""pro-South"" nature of the film anyway, so why damge the story arc by adding Chamberlain.2) How come the film jumps from First Manassas in the summer of 1861 alway to Fredericksburg in Dec. 1862 without so much as a mention of what happened inbetween? Alot of important things happened to the main characters during that time.The story arc of a better film would have revolved around Stonewall Jackson and left out Chamberlain. (Chamberlain is not really relevent to a story about Jackson) A better story of Jackson would include (at least in referance or as montage) the much-heralded Shanandoah Campaign and the ensuing forced march to Richmond where Jackson was criticized after the Battle of the Seven Days. Antitam is also pretty important to Jackson's story, more so than Fredericksburg. I like the story of Jackson's reaction to the loss at Antitam; it would have made a great scene.I have heard that a longer 6-hour DVD will be released later in the year or next. Perhaps two extra hours would solve the questions of Shanandoah, Seven Days, and Antitam? I do not expect to see these battles to the detail of the ones already in the film, but a mention would at least be nice. I'll wait until it comes out, maybe I'll buy it.That all being said, I found the movie to be interesting, having close ties to Fredericksburg myself and being a big civil war buff. The attention to detail and accuracy with regards to the recreation of the battles is wonderfull. The movie is great for fans of history, but I'm not sure other people would like it.I would love to see a well made biopic of Lee, Jackson, Sherman, Grant, or McClellan.

In terms of historical accuracy, overall cinematography, most of the casting, and battlefield realism, it is indeed a fine film.  However, while some of the ""reservations"" are of a strictly ""personal preference"" nature, others are not.  Considering the history of the Civil War, General Stonewall Jackson definitely deserved deep coverage, especially in view of the impact of his absence at Gettysburg, which may have turned out differently had he been there.I was relieved that Jeff Daniels repeated his role as Col. Chamberlain, as this is a key character in the overall tale, as were other actors who appeared as members of his command retained.  But despite the fact that they played their roles very well, I do not believe Robert Duvall and Stephen Lang should have appeared as Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, respectively.  Perhaps they had other commitments when the film was scheduled.  I would much preferred to have seen Martin Sheen back in the role of R. E. Lee, and any one of several actors in Jackson's role.  Lang portayed a memorable General Pickett in Gettysburg, and it rendered his role as Jackson ""uncomfortable"" for me, having loved Gettysburg.Perhaps the film's most obvious drawback was its sheer length.  I am not sure what I would have edited out of the story, but more than likely it would have been some of the very lengthy dialogues.

Seeing the flags of the civil war regiments at the opening credits was haunting, as tho it was the ""threshold"" we as viewers were to cross to get back to the U.S. in the 1860s.The primary complaints that most people are apt to pledge against this film too long & too pedantic.  As far as length, it was appropriate for the scope of its story - just as the sequel, GETTYSBERG was.  [Even tho GETTYSBERG was made before the present movie, it is still the sequel].  You can't make an epic movie and still have it be under 2 hours;  is just the nature of the epic.As for it being overly pedantic, for myself I relish lines such as ""We train by day and read our Xenophon by night.""  We must remember that the service academies gave much more credence to classical history in the 19th century than they do today.  Also, Xenophon had a far greater reputation as a trustworthy historian than he does today.The cast of the film is top-knotch.  Robert Duvall plays Robert E Lee in a more stoic fashion than Martin Sheen's portrayal in GETTYSBERG.  Bruce Boxleitner is an even trade off for Tom Berenger in the role of General Longstreet.If you are even remotely interested in the period of the civil war, this film is a must-see film.

And later in the plot, even jeff Daniels, with the film's strongest performance as Chamberlin of the 20th Maine, starts telling instead of showing, all to the fault of screenwriter and director Maxwell who was obliged to provide real material and insight. The movie instead comes off as a miniseries, which is what its sister movie Gettysburg was initially conceived as. I gave it an extra star because the rebel soldiers do look authentic, Jackson's outflanking of Howard at Chancellorsville is screen-worthy, as is the attack on the Stonewall at Fredericksburg with its digitalized scenes of long Union formations and one vast field of downed Union soldiers. But the sentimental claptrap and speeches I mostly fast-forwarded through. You'd think with a movie depicting America's most trying period, and for 65 million bucks and the donated time of thousands of extras, we could see a few genuine characters instead of schmaltz.

755742,AY1HVIM2V067E,B00009OOFA,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[9, 24]","This movie is rather intelligent and moving, but its production crew seems to have been dominated by Johnny Rebs.First of all: it is indeed true that Victorian people, including upper class Southern people, talked as they do in the movie, cried and prayed readily and generally worked themselves into a State as does Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The film's makers and Shelby Foote knew this and present an historically accurate picture of what at its best was nobility but at its worst, simple hypocrisy.It is however a Big Lie that African Americans were as loyal to and as loving of ole Massah as is shown. It is a Big Lie that (as implied by a comment of Jackson) the South was a-fixin' to free the slaves, and documentation for the truth is in the Confederate constitution, which while banning the slave trade (there being enough slaves to reproduce naturally) banned any repeal of slavery.The South was in fact a primitive police state in which house slaves professed a loyalty they did not for the most part feel.In a throwaway line, Jeff Daniels in an excellent portrayal of Union general Joshua Chamberlain, one of the more likable characters in the film, says that slavery is common in other parts of the world, but that the USA should be an exception by means of the Emancipation.This is another lie. By 1863, slavery was unknown in the European world and in European colonies except for Brazil, in which emancipation did not come until the 1880s. Serfdom, a Christian evolution of slavery that recognized some basic rights of the serf, was on the verge of being abolished in its last stand, in Tsarist Russia.Joshua Chamberlain and his brother were fighting a primitive police state whose noble ""cause"" was a New South for the immediate postwar doing a land office business opening new resource markets in crops adapted to slave labor, a South that would have become a Fascist state in the 20th century.This was to the shame of Americans worldwide who throughout what was then known as the civilized world were in fact reviled for their Peculiar institution.The movie is also an insult to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, because its perspective is class biased towards the gentry and to the Northern and Southern gentry, Lincoln was an uncouth self-made man. The fact that Lincoln, unlike Jay Gould and the Vanderbilts, did so fair and square as a lawyer was held against him by a Northern bourgeoisie a-fixin' to enslave the immigrants to wage labor and by a Southern slave-driving ""aristocracy"" consisting of the scrapings of Stuart England.Lincoln is an offstage evil genius who sends the weeping and prayin' fellas to their death. The fact is that Lincoln was an agnostic because he couldn't figger out jest how men like Stonewall could reconcile slavery and ""the black flag"" of secesh piracy with ""Christianity"" EXCEPT with a weep and a pray in a boneyard.The secesh generals were in modern terms war criminals because they waged an unwinnable war based on an overly narrow agricultural basis in the name of the violation of human rights. It is high time that the true story be told of the Union generals who unlike Burnside knew their trade and who without the nauseating hypocrisy here displayed by Bobby Lee and Stonewall set about their grim task, with old Grant being exhibit number one.Old Sam would be hard to sentimentalize and that is why he, and Lincoln, were more attractive to an older generation of Northern civil war buffs like Illinois poet and socialist Carl Sandburg.This film Manufactured Consent to a southern adventure: the crusade in Iraq. It sentimentalized war, because you can be as ""realistic"" as you want and avoid silly errors such as the grossly fat, body by McDonald's ""re-enactors"" who cheer Bobby Lee in the earlier film Gettysburg (news flash: the Rebs were on short rations), but the Big Lie remains, with digital flash and precision: ""dulce et decorum est"".Against this nonsense, despite its being innately moving to any American like me, the recent French film Joyeux Noel is much to be preferred, because the latter film presents war honestly, as a rich man's ""war"" but a poor man's ""fight"".Lincoln was showing restraint at the period narrated in the beginning of the film, and it was treason for Virginia to refuse to defend the union plain and simple. This film is at base an intelligent and moving celebration of a Higher Treason: that treason of a ""noble"" Brutus who for a Cause overthrows his sovereign.Dante condemned Brutus to the lowest point in Hell, and this continuation into a second century of filmic celebrations of The Cause (starting with Birth of a Nation) is a celebration of treason, one that today preserves racism in America.Where are the films about Lincoln (such as John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln)? Or John Brown? These Secesh films are like D. W. Griffiths' Birth of a Nation rewriting an American northern immigrant history in favor of a small slave owning class. The great-grandchildren of this class now control entirely too much of the US with Sunbelt domination of our culture. This has made us again a laughing-stock in the truly civilized world.",2,"Intelligent: moving: but in the final analysis, Secesh propaganda",1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,5125,"['movie', 'rather',

After two days of killing anticipation it finally arrived, and I was not disappointed. This movie is a masterpiece! (To put it lightly!)Stephen Lang was great as Stonewall, although despite his appearances, he sounds exactly like Pickett. Hmm, what a coincidence! :) Actually, they are both played by the same man, but in different movies.The best part of the movie is the battle of Fredricksburg, which was done very well. Even though I knew that the Federals would lose, I was rather hoping that maybe, just maybe, they would win. They deserved to win.Usually when I watch a Civil War movie I root for the side that they focus on, but this movie was different. They portrayed both sides with such feeling that one part of me wanted the Rebels to win, and another part of me wanted them to lose.My greatest disappointment is with Lawrence Chamberlain. Sorry to spoil it, but he does not look his age. I know it's been 10 years since they made &quot;Gettysburg&quot; but I was kind of hoping that he would look the same. I think they'll do him better justice in &quot;The last full Measure.&quot; He'll probably look more his age there.To be honest, 'Gettysburg's' soundtrack is much better, but God's and General's isn't that bad. 'Going Home' is pretty good, but Bob Dillan-whose raspy voice sounds like he has a bad cold-sings `Across the Green Mountains'.One more qualm I had with this movie: not enough Chamberlain. He's my favorite character, and if the movie is anything like the book, &quot;The Last full Measure&quot; should show him a lot more.This movie was great.

Hancock's story offered a different and very interesting perspective; I think it was a great shame to lose his retort: "" ... it is not God who will assemble us on the battlefield, nor position our troops, nor place the cannon, and it is not God who will aim the musket.""Maxwell has made a Civil War Southern.  He claims that he attempted to broaden the book by adding civilians, but all are loyal to the Confederacy, including the two African-Americans.  One of those is a freedman who wants to work for Stonewall Jackson in order to do his bit against the damnyankees.  The other is a slave woman, mother of three children, who dresses like a middle- or upper-class white woman and is devoted to her owners.  Both of these characters deliver anti-slavery speeches, but both scenes are played in a way that undercuts the message.  I think these are fig leaves so that Maxwell can try to wriggle out of a charge of whitewashing slavery.  [added coments: I wouldn't have minded Maxwell telling the story from the Southern point of view if he hadn't been so dishonest about, maybe with himself as much as with the audience.  I think that taking the movie by itself, the average viewer would get the idea that it was to be taken as balanced.  In that sense, Gone with the Wind was a better movie.  It was clearly from the point of view of wealthy plantation owners, and the slaves, while they don't complain, aren't made to quite so blatently embrace their slavery.  We don't get into the heads of the GWTW slaves as we do in this movie.]Maxwell claims that he did the movie this way because our view of the conflict is so skewed toward the Union that we cannot understand the Southern point of view.  Given the number of Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy, the vast and varied number of books published on the topic, and perhaps most especially, Shelby Foote's star turn in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary, I would have to say that Maxwell is delusional.But, let's skip all these issues.  Maxwell presumably paid for the movie rights, he has the right to adapt the book however he wants, and it's a free country: he can make a Southern if he wants to.  It's still a painfully dull movie.  I left the room briefly about a half hour into it and told my friend not to bother stopping the DVD on my account.  I later apologized for having wasted her afternoon by suggesting we watch this.My willing suspension of disbelief will overcome reenactors who are not utterly authentic, weird beards, actors playing younger characters when they are older, etc.  The acting is incredibly uneven, however.  The actor playing one of the minor southern generals, I have forgotten which one, turned in the worst performance I have ever seen anyone bother to preserve.  I think that I would have at least redubbed it with someone who doesn't sound like a semi-literate trying to read cue cards.  As a general rule, whenever a character voiced an authentic quote, it sounded so stilted that I felt I could see the quote marks and citation hanging in the air.The worst problem is that Maxwell simply doesn't edit his material down to a manageable, satisfying length.  Many of the scenes went on long after most of the audience must have gotten the point; by the time the opposing Irish brigades finished bewailing having to fight one another, I wanted someone to put the lot of them out of their misery.  Considering how Maxwell has done most of this movie, Joshua Chamberlain, much as I admire him, is an anomaly and should have been cut to a minor character; I suspect this is another fig leaf.  It didn't provide balance, just pointless narrative bloat.  Indeed, except for streaming across the battlefield, we should never have heard from any Union troops except as narrative bridges.  Maxwell's heart was clearly in making a Southern about Stonewall Jackson, and that should have been the focus of the movie.I actually enjoyed the Jacksons - I can't say that I am terribly knowledgeable about them, but they seem consistent with what I know about them and their mutual affection and deep religious faith are touchingly portrayed.  Stephen Lang does an excellent job of embodying a rather unusual man.I have abandoned my plans to see Maxwell's previous effort, Gettysburg, and he certainly needn't make the third movie in the trilogy on my account.  Meanwhile, I suggest reading the book.  At almost 500 pages, it didn't seem nearly as long as the movie.  [Added later:] At the urging of G.T. Howell's comment, I did watch Gettysburg.

It focuses much more on the Southern forces than the North. It presents a distorted view of the South, almost to the point of taking the Confederacy's side. It presents African American slaves as sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Much of the film stars General Stonewall Jackson, an annoying Southern fanatic who spews out religious fanaticism. In one long scene, he claims that the South was considering liberating the slaves, but this scene overshadows the fact that the Confederacy never came even close to this (and that after the war, Southerners spent decades harassing African Americans). Meanwhile, General Lee, a more sympathetic character, is more marginal than inGettysburg.I don't mind a movie that shows the Southern point of view and doesn't demonize them -Gettysburgdid a good job of presenting Southern soldiers as human beings.

However, that is just not the case, nor the intent of this film.  What the film IS about are the career and personal natures of a very few seminal characters, and in particular, General 'Stonewall' Jackson.  As such, lengthy treatment of the 'causes' of the Civil War, who was right and who was wrong are not particularly appropriate, nor is such discussed.  Instead, we are treated to the 'causes' that brought Jackson HIMSELF to the war, as well as Robert E. Lee, and Chamberlain too.  That is the point; to bring the focus not to huge overarching national and regional issues, but to the reasons and causes why INDIVIDUALS fight, and will go to a great war of unknown length and violence inconceivable, even though they know they themselves are unlikely to survive.  Yet these causes are considered by the INDIVIDUALS concerned to be SO important, SO fundamental to their own perception of what is, and is not tolerable that the time comes where they have to make a very personal and terrible choice, and live (or die) by the outcome of that choice.Anyone who has ever gone to war will recognise that mental wrestling match that all who take that unalterable step must engage in.  What makes the scenario of the American Civil War so poignant is that virtually everyone involved understands and KNOWS that he will not just be going off to fight some vaguely perceived and relatively undefined 'enemy,' but that they will be fighting and killing their OWN friends, neighbors, and even family members in defense of that which is perceived to be absolute.  The choice therefore, is even more terrible, as are the consequences.This is why there are some long soliloquys in the film, as both the author, and film maker work to get the audience to UNDERSTAND and appreciate the depth and breadth of the sacrifice contemplated, and acted upon.  Further, it should be remembered that the people of that time actually spoke and thought in the manner presented (not just an 'author's conceit'), as is recorded in the many journal entries and letters from the time (these were NOT 21st century men and women, but a product of their times, and thought and spoke accordingly).In sum, if you are simply looking for a Civil War 'action movie' with lots of explosions and little plot, then you might not like this (though there are indeed plenty of explosions, and the most splendidly filmed battle sequences ever done).  You might not like it if you are looking solely for a history of the Civil War either (PBS did an excellent documentary on the Civil War, if it's strict history you are looking for, that's your source!).  But if you are looking for a film of breadth and scope on a personal level, comparable to the incomparable film 'Glory,' then you will agree that 'Gods and Generals' is an excellent choice.",5,An often misunderstood classic of epic proportions,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,2975,"['splendid', 'adaptation', 'Shaara', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'many', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'history', 'first', 'part', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'However', 'just', 'not', 'case', 'intent', 'film', 'What', 'film', 'about', 'are', 'career', 'personal', 'natures', 'very', 'few', 'seminal', 'characters', 'particular', 'General', ""'Stonewall"", 'Jackson', 'such', 'lengthy', 'treatment', ""'causes"", 'Civil', 'War', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'who', 'was', 'wrong', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'appropriate', 'such', 'discussed', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', ""'causes"", 'brought', 'Jackson', 'HIMSELF', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Chamberlain', 'too', 'point', 'bring', 'focus', 'not', 'huge', 'overarching', 'national', 'regional', 'issues', 'reasons', 'why', 'INDIVIDUALS', 'fight', 'will', 'go', 'great', 'war', 'unknown', 'length', 'violence', 'inconceivable', 'even', 'know', 'are', 'unlikely', 'survive', 'causes', 'are', 'considered', 'INDIVIDUALS', 'concerned', 'be', 'SO', 'important', 'SO', 'fundamental', 'own', 'perception', 'what', 'not', 'tolerable', 'time', 'where', 'have', 'make', 'very', 'personal', 'terrible', 'choice', 'live', 'die', 'outcome', 'choice.Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'gone', 'war', 'will', 'recognise', 'mental', 'wrestling', 'match', 'who', 'take', 'unalterable', 'step', 'must', 'engage', 'What', 'scenario', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'so', 'poignant', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'involved', 'understands', 'KNOWS', 'will', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'fight', 'vaguely', 'perceived', 'relatively', 'undefined', ""'enemy"", 'will', 'be', 'fighting', 'killing', 'OWN', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'even', 'family', 'members', 'defense', 'perceived', 'be', 'absolute', 'choice', 'therefore', 'even', 'more', 'terrible', 'are', 'consequences.This', 'why', 'are', 'long', 'soliloquys', 'film', 'author', 'film', 'maker', 'work', 'get', 'audience', 'UNDERSTAND', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'breadth', 'sacrifice', 'contemplated', 'acted', 'upon', 'Further', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'people', 'time', 'actually', 'spoke', 'thought', 'manner', 'presented', 'not', 'just', ""'author"", 'conceit', 'recorded', 'many', 'journal', 'entries', 'letters', 'time', 'were', 'NOT', '21st', 'century', 'men', 'women', 'product', 'times', 'thought', 'spoke', 'accordingly', '.In', 'sum', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'Civil', 'War', ""'action"", 'movie', 'lots', 'explosions', 'little', 'plot', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'are', 'indeed', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'most', 'splendidly', 'filmed', 'battle', 'sequences', 'ever', 'done', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'are', 'looking', 'solely', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'PBS', 'did', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Civil', 'War', 'strict', 'history', 'are', 'looking', 'source', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'breadth', 'scope', 'personal', 'level', 'comparable', 'incomparable', 'film', ""'Glory"", 'then', 'will', 'agree', ""'Gods"", 'Generals', 'excellent', 'choice']",N/A

755751,A3D90TLQSXQ7MW,B00009OOFA,Firelock1776,"[7, 18]","First of all, it is not historically accurate. The movie glosses over Stonewall Jackson's failings and foibles to present him exclusively as a sympathetic man of piety. His famous obession with lemmons is only obliquely hinted at in the movie character's taste for lemonade. His peculiar habit of riding with one arm in the air to ""balance his equilibrium"" is also dismissed in the movie as being due to an injury in battle.The movie is too pro-Southern. I am certainly not one to subscribe to political correctness, but if you are going to make a movie about he South in the Civil War, you should address the slavery issue more forthrightly. There are hardly any blacks at all in the film, despite the film's almost exclusive Southern location. The two main black characters are embarrassingly pro-Southern themselves!The battle scenes are cursory and very short. Whereas you could watch ""Gettysburg"" and actually learn a great deal about the battle, there is little that can be learned from the battle scenes in this film. The concluding battle of Chancellorsville should have been a fantastic opportunity to gain insight on Lee's battle strategy and Jackson's brillance. Instead it is glossed over, and is included only so Jackson's final reconnaissance ride can be covered.Whole years of the war are skipped, which at least could have been alluded to. There is no mention at all of the Peninsular Campaign or Antietam.Last and most importantly, the movie is a series of monologues.

755758,AY12DBB0U420B,B00009OOFA,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night's late night movie was the ""Gods and Generals"" DVD. It was an interesting reenactment of a part of the American Civil War. My feeling was that to really appreciate and enjoy the movie, you'd have to be deeply immersed in knowledge of the war and it's participants. It would seem essential, and then the movie might become ever better. I have little such knowledge. To me it was amazing and educational to view with it's cast of thousands and all the historical sites and such. The costuming was interesting and well done. The acting seemed somewhat stiff and wooden and many of the conversations were given like little mini-speeches expected to be heard by all. The stances often looked like something you'd see in paintings exhibited for patriotic reasons. There seemed to be much too great of an emphasis on God and religion, but then I don't know what the feelings and beliefs were at that time.The American Civil War is always listed very high on any tabulation of casualties and casualty rates. Well, if the reenactments of these battles are at all accurate, you can certainly see why the casualty rates were so high. The lines and groups of people standing and firing into other lines and groups of people who are returning the fire would certainly lend itself to high casualty rates. Good grief, war is dumb in general, but certainly it couldn't have been this dumb. What was the purpose, just to kill as many people as possible? Other things seemed seriously off. In some instances, generals were giving speeches and instructions to hundreds of men scattered about areas of perhaps 5 acres without any PA systems or without shouting. Gosh. I wonder if the movie directors have ever tried to speak to a group of people outside. Well, pick, pick, pick. The movie lends itself to this kind of petty criticism. Actually, I rather enjoyed seeing it, but the movie seemed ultra long and became somewhat tedious.

I remember a few scattered reviews at the time of its release which were fairly partisan about the whole what the Civil War was fought over subject. I chalked that up to the overly political nature of the media. So I figured I'd give this movie a chance.I expected it to be basically something akin to a Kevin Costner movie, a Field of Dreams or a Dances with Wolves, told with a slight Confederate slant.I was ready to accept a Confederate slant.But not this.The issue is that the movie itself is extremely political. It batters you over the head with its message. The Confederacy was noble. It was not about slavery.It was not about slavery. See? We have black people cheering for the Confederates.It really was not about slavery. See? We have a black actor being best friends with the Confederate General.Besides being historically inaccurate, it is incredibly irritating to be battered over the head over and over with this politically motivated sledgehammer.And it truly is inaccurate. For black America, the Civil War was their war of independence. The numbers of black Americans fighting for the Union greatly outnumbered those few fighting for the Confederacy. Greatly. Vastly. Hugely. And, as the war dragged on, the Confederate leadership grew virulently racist against black americans, Robert E Lee included. Yes, the Union was also racist. The Confederacy was more racist. By a lot.Secondly, it glorifies the leadership of the Confederacy. The last remaining defense of the Confederate flag is that it is a battlefield flag, dedicated to the men who died for a misguided cause.That I can accept. That is true.But this movie is not about honoring the Confederate fighting man. Not at all.It is about honoring the Confederate leadership. It is about honoring the Confederate cause itself.This movie is pretty much told from the perspective of the Confederate planter class, the ones who held slaves and who ruled the South. It is not told from the perspective of the poor white fighting man who was fighting for what he thought of as home.The scenes play this out. Everyone is spouting noble sentiments. Everyone dies quickly and bravely. There is hardly any emotion in the fighting. There is hardly any emotion in the Confederate generals being glorified in the film. They say their overly long flowery language and...on to the next scene of overly long flowery language...and then the next, this time with a black person giving racial absolution to the Confederate white supremacist generals, and--It does this for over four hours.Four hours is insane.

After that it's a fast downhill slide. I'm amazed at the amount of four and five stars that reviewers here have awarded this mess of a movie and can only guest that they are coming from that strange breed of person known as the ""Civil War Re-enactor"". Bad acting, bad beards(like it's sequel Gettysburg), bad computer generated images and above all fake battles using overweight civil war re-enactors. Director Ron Maxwell directs this film like he was back in the 1950's with 50's sensibilities. Any war movie, this one in particular, that ignores the groundbreaking vision that Steven Speilberg gave us in 1998 with his magnificent ""Saving Private Ryan"" deserves the failure this film had at the box office. What an opportunity Maxwell had. First of all he ignored two of the most fundamental rules of the post ""Ryan"" battle scene, no soundtrack music during a battle unless it is provided by the fife and drum corps existing in the scene and plenty of handheld camera work. Maxwell uses romantic battle hymns during the big battles and there are plenty of smooth slick tracking and crane shots during his essentially bloodless events. Nowhere do we see the visions of hell that I have read about by survivors of these hideous conflicts where modern industrial weaponry met napoleonic battle tactics.Some fine actors were wasted in this film most notably Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall as an incredibly pale Robert E. Lee. These men were sunburnt and weathered, they spent all of their time outdoors on horses. Steven Lang plays a romantic version of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a departure from the tactical killing machine who was Lee's right arm. Oh I could go on and on. A really great film about our nations most horrendous folly has still never been made. Until that happens I would suggest instead of ""Gods and Generals"" either Ken Burn's monumental series ""The Civil War"" or the small independent film ""Pharoahs Army"" with Patricia Clarkson and the great Chris Cooper.",1,Opportunity lost,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2070,"['best', 'thing', 'film', 'song', 'opening', 'credits', 'sung', 'great', 'Mary', 'Fahl', 'fast', 'downhill', 'slide', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'amount', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'awarded', 'mess', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'guest', 'are', 'coming', 'strange', 'breed', 'person', 'known', 'Civil', 'War', 'Re-enactor', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'beards', 'sequel', 'Gettysburg', 'bad', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'fake', 'battles', 'using', 'overweight', 'civil', 'war', 're-enactors', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Maxwell', 'film', 'was', 'back', '1950', '50', 'sensibilities', 'Any', 'war', 'movie', 'one', 'particular', 'groundbreaking', 'vision', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'gave', '1998', 'magnificent', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'failure', 'film', 'had', 'box', 'office', 'What', 'opportunity', 'Maxwell', 'had', 'First', 'all', 'ignored', 'two', 'most', 'fundamental', 'rules', 'post', 'Ryan', 'battle', 'scene', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'battle', 'provided', 'fife', 'drum', 'corps', 'existing', 'scene', 'plenty', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'Maxwell', 'romantic', 'battle', 'hymns', 'big', 'battles', 'are', 'plenty', 'smooth', 'slick', 'tracking', 'crane', 'shots', 'essentially', 'bloodless', 'events', 'Nowhere', 'do', 'see', 'visions', 'hell', 'have', 'read', 'survivors', 'hideous', 'conflicts', 'where', 'modern', 'industrial', 'weaponry', 'met', 'napoleonic', 'battle', 'tactics.Some', 'fine', 'actors', 'were', 'wasted', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'incredibly', 'pale', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'men', 'were', 'sunburnt', 'weathered', 'spent', 'time', 'outdoors', 'horses', 'Steven', 'Lang', 'romantic', 'version', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'departure', 'tactical', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'was', 'Lee', 'right', 'arm', 'Oh', 'could', 'go', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'nations', 'most', 'horrendous', 'folly', 'still', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'would', 'suggest', 'instead', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'Ken', 'Burn', 'monumental', 'series', 'Civil', 'War', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'Pharoahs', 'Army', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'great', 'Chris', 'Cooper']",N/A
755762,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B00009OOFA,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[1, 2]","As I say in the title, I saw ""Gettysburg"" first, and seeing that ""Gods and Generals"" was made by the same people with many of the same actors, I was looking forward to seeing the second film. I was quite disappointed, it is no where near as good.  The main problem is that the film is basically unfocussed, except in attempting to show that Stonewall Jackson was a ""great"" man and that everyone involved in the war, particularly the Confederates, were ""noble fighters"".I was quite surprised to see the film showing slaves who were quite devoted to their masters, not because that there wasn't such a phenomenon (the movie ""Gone With The Wind"" which came out in the ""pre-Civil Rights Movement"" year of 1939 shows that as well), but with the current suffocating climate of ""political correctness"" it is surprising to me that we would see a modern film depicting such attitudes.  The ""correct"" thing to do would be to show Southerners as monsters supporting the inhuman institution of slavery and everyone who is associated with its cause would be required to be portrayed as evil, at least to some extent. I guess I should give credit to the producers of this film for not falling into this trap and giving the audience a feel for the nuances of the period, which are not really understood today. Similarly we see Stonewall Jackson expressing his hope that slavery would soon be abolished (other Confederate Generals such as Longstreet and Lee were also in favor of abolishing it).Stephen Lang's portrayal of Jackson is good and, having seen ""Gettysburg"" I realize he is quite a versatile actor. In ""Gettysburg"" he played the ebullient George Pickett, whereas here he portrays a very different type of man-the super-intense, fanatical, almost crazed Jackson, and we see this in his eyes.  Too bad they didn't include a quote of his which I got from Shelby Foote in the TV documentary ""The Civil War"" in which Jackson asked about where a certain suborinate was. He was told that he was killed. Jackson replied ""very commendable!"". Very strange how such a ""pious"" man was so indifferent to the endless slaughter that was going on around him.  In ""Gettysburg"" we do see Longstreet and Lee being affected by it. It is for this reason I refuse to see Jackson as some sort of great, noble man as many do, but rather as someone who needed psychiatric treatment.On the other hand, I missed Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Martin Sheen as Lee. Although Longstreet is a minor figure in this film, Berenger's replacement is flat and unremarkable. I am aware the Robert Duvall is a fine actor (he once played Josef Stalin in an outstanding performance), but here he is also bland and I didn't get the feel of Lee's personality as I did from Martin Sheen.  I felt the scene at the beginning where Lee is offered command of the Union armies did not really bring out the tormenting dilemma that Lee faced in making the decision to support succession.When I say the film is ""unfocussed"" I mean that it drags on and on in places and the historical context of the scenes is missing. I could not believe that they showed the battle of Bull Run without showing the bravado of the Union commanders and leaders in thinking that they could have an easy march to Richmond which would then bring a nice, clean, early end to the war. No mention whatsoever of any of this.  Similarly, no mention of Antietam and its effect of bringing Lincoln to making the Emancipation Proclamation.  These are crucial events in understanding the progress of the war. Such context was given in ""Gettysburg"" when it is explained at the beginning of the film the reason for Lee's invasion of the North and during the film Lee's strategy is described within the context of his earlier battles.Yes, the scenes of the battles at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville are very good....they are, in my opinion, the main justification for recommending the film in spite of its drawbacks. The clash between the two Irish units is especially moving.Thus, people interested in the Civil War in a general sense may enjoy the film in spite of its boring segments, but someone with more than a casual interest in it may find the whole thing a waste of time.

The battle scenes, which really are what the whole thing is supposed to be about (Civil War, remember?) get lost in all the contrived, stilted dialogue and preaching.  Every statement-particularly from the Confederate side-reminds one of the bombast from a Cecil B. DeMille religious epic (The Ten Commandments comes to mind).The three great battles of Bull Run, Fredricksburg, and Chancellorsville are separated by long, long stretches of tedious conversation.  Nevertheless, I certainly give credit to Stephen Lang's portrayal of Gen. 'Stonewall' Jackson; he humanizes the legendary Confederate leader, who genuinely believed that God was on his side.  The battle scenes were sanitized a bit too much, in my opinion.  Due to such films as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Gladiator'audiences are now more accepting of war movie violence than in the past, so such watering down makes the film less believable.There is much to like in this movie.  The overall 'look' of the film is believable; the creators actually saw fit to have artillery recoil after firing (many war films forget to do this).  The large numbers of men standing out in the open in Napoleonic fashion while getting shot to pieces is difficult to watch-even though there are no body parts to be seen when struck directly by cannon fire.  The scene of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and his men in the field of the dead and dying after Fredricksburg is particularly poignant.  The uniforms, weaponry, and tactics are very accurate indeed.Some gaffes are inexcusable in a film of this magnitude and historical importance.  An example?  The scene portraying Jackson's famous flanking attack at Chancellorsville contains a blatant faux pas: One of the reenactors in the Union camp fleeing the Confederate onslaught has a HUGE SMILE on his face as he runs toward the camera!  Isn't this what editing is for?  In addition, most modern moviegoers KNOW what good CGI effects look like...and there are several instances in this film where they are just plain bad.'Gods and Generals' could have been a great film, but instead it is just mediocre.  I feel 1 whole hour could be excised and the movie would lose little in the translation.  There is always a fine balance between historical accuracy and entertainment; a feature filmmaker does not want his creation to appear like a documentary.  This film may be historically accurate, but overall is just not very entertaining.

755766,AH39OFADI4W11,B00009OOFA,Granten Lee,"[6, 10]","... I think this is a good film in the hands of the right person but in the hands of neo-Confederate southern apologists, particularly those with an agenda to distort history, it could be a problem.It's obvious that Ron F. Maxwell (writer, director and producer of this film) truly loves history and put a lot of thought and care into this movie. But the problem is he messed with the wrong period of history. The Civil War is the Holy Grail of American history, and the battle for its legacy is still being fought. To one side, the bottom line of the conflict was southern black slavery- to this opinion, it doesn't matter if the Confederate soldier owned no slaves, the economic system which sent him off to war was fueled by slavery. To the other side, the War Between the States- or the War of Southern Independence- or the War of Northern Aggression- was about state's rights versus the federal government in DC telling people in Georgia or Arkansas or wherever what to do. A lot can be added to the opinions on both sides in this debate, and neither side looks to back down anytime soon.""Gods and Generals"" has been so roundly criticized for being soft on slavery and too pro-Confederate. This was supposed to be the first part of a Civil War trilogy (1. Gods and Generals 2. Gettysbug/The Killer Angels 3. The Last Full Measure) based on books of the same names by Michael and Jeff Shaara. I think the intention of Maxwell was to present both North and South with dignity and respect, to show that there were heroes on both sides. This intention is true. But this movie was a bigger bomb than the explosion of the Crater in 1864. As a result of the flop, ""Last Full Measure"" has been canceled and will probably never be made. And I must say... I don't think I've ever seen a film so hated before in my life. Some people who wrote reviews here come off like watching this film was not just a waste of their time, but their lives have actually been ruined as a result. I almost think that if Ron Maxwell goes around introducing himself as the director of ""Gods & Generals,"" somebody's going to hit him.Personally, I can't respect the Confederacy at any time for wanting its independence while enslaving people. The deal's off at that point. But there is something fascinating about those who are willing to risk it all- their lives, for a cause, even if that cause lacks nobility. In other words, I study the Confederacy as social and military history rather than condemning all things southern.As I said, I personally liked this film. I liked that many of these scenes were very accurate, such as John Janney's speech before the Virginia Secession Convention and Stonewall Jackson's speech to his soldiers. Lt. Col. Chamberlain's speech (this movie has a lot of speeches) to his brother before Chancellorsville is tremendously powerful. This is the first Civil War film I've ever seen that has shown black camp servants, which were used by both sides. I've seen a lot of camp photos from the war and these African-Americans are clearly visible, yet they have been omitted from so many ""accurate"" films with ""attention to detail."" I loved the film's Christian theme. And I appreciate that the movie included a lot of people- Janney, Dr. George Junkin, Francis Preston Blair, Sr., Mary Anna Jackson, Jim Lewis, Sandie Pendlton, Dr. Hunter McGuire, and Colonel Adelbert Ames- that previous films have left out. This movie gave me a lot to think about, as it was intended to do.But like many, I do think it sugar-coated slavery and even went so far- I think unintentionally- to make the north look like the evil aggressor. One example is the comparison presented in the film of the soldiers' behavior. In one inspiring scene, General Jackson salutes his men and commends their respect for the ""rights and property"" of citizens. Then, during the battle of Fredericksburg, Yankee soldiers are seen looting and vandalizing in the streets of the small southern city. The truth is, BOTH of these events are factual. The speech was recited virtually word for word, and Union soldiers did engage in drunken vandalism. But this is only part of the war. Starving southern soldiers stole food and clothes on frequent occasions and the movie mentions nothing about the fact that General Robert E Lee, who I still believe was a Christian man, allowed soldiers in his army to kidnap free blacks in Maryland on their way to Antietam. Splicing history to this effect is like one of those crazy YOUTUBE videos where somebody takes ""Mary Poppins"" and turns it into the exorcistic, possessed ""Scary Mary."" Neo-Confederate apologists will walk away thinking theirs was the just cause. I can think of one of them. A few years ago, I visited the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park in Virginia. While touring the museum, I observed a white woman look at the exhibits and then bow down to her young daughter and remark, ""See, honey? It's too bad the south didn't win- we would have been better off!"" Furthermore, she made this comment while standing next to a black man.If you see Gods and Generals, make sure it is not the only Civil War film you see. Please include PBS' ""The Civil War,"" ""Amistad (pre-war)"" ""Andersonville,"" ""The Day Lincoln Was Shot,"" ""Gettysburg,"" ""Glory,"" ""The Hunley,"" ""Wicked Spring"" and ""Ride With the Devil."" Even these will not tell you everything about the war. There are many great books, such as William C. Davis' ""Look Away! A History of the Confederate States of America;"" ""With My Face To the Enemy: Perspectives on the Civil War"" by Robert Cowley and others; and James McPherson's ""Battle Cry of Freedom."" These books and others will give you more education than these movies ever will.",4,"I Liked It, But...",1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,5719,"['think', 'good', 'film', 'hands', 'right', 'person',

755767,A2IRS3BC7G3IOF,B00009OOFA,Grant Sansom-Sherwill,"[2, 3]","I bought Gods and Generals thinking it was going to be similar to Gettysburg - historically accurate, full of realistic battle scenes, and a wide and even spread of characters from both sides, with characters deep enough to understand their motivations, and the motivations of either side in the Civil War.  With the same producers, director and many of the same actors, Gods and Generals promised to be similar.While the movie was historically accurate and the battle scenes quite realistic (though not to the point of Saving Private Ryan, say, ie it avoiding being gory), the characters were not evenly spread, mainly concentrating on Southern generals, and in particular &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson.  The movie seemed more like a Stonewall Jackson biography than a recounting of the first 2 years of the war, up to Chancellorsville, which it pertains to be.  Yet, if it is a movie about Stonewall Jackson, why not include Jackson's Shenandoah campaign, surely, after Chancellorsville, his greatest contribution to the Southern cause?The other problem I had with concentrating on Jackson was that Stephen Lang was probably not the best choice of actor for the role of Jackson.  His acting seemed wooden and forced, like many of the actors in the movie, and I could not stop myself from thinking of him as Major General George Pickett, the character he played in Gettysburg.  Pickett was a very different character to Jackson, and to think of Jackson as Pickett does Jackson no favours.  Clearly the producers wanted to retain as many of the Gettyburg cast as possible, an admirable idea when they are playing the same characters as before (eg Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the same actors for Gen Hancock and the 20th Maine sergeant), as one recognises them immediately and can fathom how their characters fit in the time-line of the war.  Yet having Stephen Lang play Pickett in Gettysburg and Jackson in Gods and Generals makes no sense, for the reasons outlined above.  Maybe they wanted to reward him for his role in Gettysburg, and he couldn't play Pickett here, as Pickett was not a significant figure in this part of the war.Another miscasting was Jason London as Jackson's adjutant, Captain Pendleton.  He was not believable as a military character, especially one in authority.As Jackson was the central figure, there seemed not enough time, or inclination, to develop the other characters involved.  Jeff Daniels probably has the 2nd most screen-time and does a good job of showing us Chamberlain's motivations and philosophies.  Nobody else really appears for long enough for us to get a handle on what they're about.  I thought Robert E Lee would be explored significantly, as he was a more important figure than Jackson or Chamberlain, especially in the context of the entire war, and especially as a he was played by a major actor, Robert Duvall, but we just scratch the surface of his character.  Robert Duvall did an excellent job in the role, though.The most irritating aspect of the entire film is the amount of grandiose speeches.  Hardly a scene goes by without someone waxing lyrical about what the war is all about, and means to them, all with accompanying stirring music.  It all becomes so predictable after a while - the movie starts starts to resemble a musical, with every scene geared towards leading into a speech/song.  While each sides motivations for fighting the war need to be explored, there are more subtle and less pretentious ways of going about it.The producers clearly wanted to fit in as many of the famous quotes of the period too, sometimes they seem to appear in dialogue for no rhyme or reason, and, like the speeches, whole scenes are geared toward just being a platform for the quote.This all said, there is a lot of good to be said about the movie too.  As mentioned, it was historically very accurate and it does stay pretty much on track as regards the flow of events, only wandering off for the inevitable speech-scenes.  The battle scenes are very well re-enacted and do give you a good insight into the battles of First Manassas/Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  Fredericksburg was especially good, as one got to really experience how futile, pointless and courageous the Union attack was, and see how the topography of the area played a major role.  The confrontation between the two Irish brigades was an especially emotional moment.The movie certainly did add to my knowledge of the Civil War, and should do so for anyone but the most expert of civil war buffs.Overall, a good attempt, but it could have been better.  By spending less time on speeches and more time on the battles (maybe adding Jackson's Shenandoah campaign, to show where he really made a name for himself, and Antietam, the ultimate demonstration of callous death and destruction) and the major characters involved, and getting the right actors for the parts, the producers would have had a great movie on their hands.  Cynically, I think the producers rattled this off in a hurry to cash in on the world's current war fever, the success of Gettysburg and the current trend of movie series (like Lord of the Rings), as there is a third movie planned.",3,"OK, but not nearly as good as Gettysburg",1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,5208,"['bought', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'similar',

755768,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B00009OOFA,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[3, 5]","The road to historical accuracy is paved with good intentions. Yet Ronald F. Maxwell's prequel to his award winning ""Gettysburg,"" proves that the best laid intentions of film makers to depict historical events, sometimes go astray. Gods and Generals is a valiant effort and enjoyable film. The obstacles that presented themselves to Maxwell, however, result from the length and breath of the events he has transposed to the screen. Whereas ""Gettysburg"" occupied a time window of three-days, Gods and Generals covers most, but not all the events within a two year span. This longer historical time frame leaves what Maxwell brought to the screen, and what he omitted, open to more scrutiny than his previous effort. Maxwell treads a tightrope between a chivalrous southern perspective and a ""Lost Cause"" interpretation. The only two African-American characters in the film, Jackson's loyal cook Jim Lewis ( Frankie Faison) and a housekeeper of a well-to-do Fredericksburg family, have their own motives for survival. Yet clearly Maxwell had not even scratched the surface of the complex issue of slavery. In addition, the focal character of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson (Stephen Lang) adds to the multitude of choices the film maker must decide concerning the opposing forces of myth versus the ""human face"" approach to this well known historical figure. Recruiting Civil War historian and Jackson scholar James I. Robertson, Jr. as a consultant to the film, Maxwell chose to dispel the common myths of Jackson and convey the human side of this complex man. Absent are the eccentricities and foibles that have become all too familiar: the constant eating of lemons, even in the heat of battle, is strangely replaced by a symbolic penchant for lemon-aid. Jackson's hypochondriac obsession with his own body (particularly concerning his arms and hands) is replaced by wounds suffered in battle. Amplified are his deep religious zeal; his devotion as a loving husband and caring father. Absent too is the full impact of Jackson's military genius. Along with not more than a hint of America's bloodiest day, the battle of Antietam/Sharpsburg, is the complete omitting of the campaign that sealed Jackson's place as a great captain-the Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Perhaps a mere montage to suggest the process of Jackson's string of military victories between First Manasas and Fredericksburg would have benefited this film greatly. The team work between Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) and Jackson, that culminated in the famous council of war between these two great military tacticians at Chancellorsville, likewise, did not come across as it could have in the film. The focus on Jackson as the film's central character, consequently regulated Lee to a backseat role. Even the outstanding acting talents of Duvall, (one of my all-time favorite actors) could not rectify this position bestowed upon him by Maxwell. On the plus side, the battle scenes are spectacular. The film's climax, the battle of Fredericksburg, is depicted accurately from beginning to end. The hand full of actors that return to their characters from ""Gettysburg"" lend a welcome continuity to what should emerge as one of the epic film trilogies of recent times. The DVD's many extras reveal the film maker's noble intentions for historical accuracy. Unfortunately, in four hours of film, some of these good intentions fell short. In spite of its shortcomings, Gods and Generals deserves a place in any history and film lover's library.

Obviously a lot of attention was paid to getting the &quot;environment&quot; right. The accents and language are also spot on. If only the tempo and characters were as believable. Robert Duvall is great as Lee, a marked improvement over Sheen in &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Many of the actors coming back to reprise their characters lent a continuity that helped the viewer immeadiately feel at &quot;home&quot;. Unfortuneately, the director allowed the glaring (and confusing) error of Stephan Lang switching from Gen Pickett (Gettysburg) to Gen Jackson. Lang is a fine actor and did his best to fill out his poorly written character. Jeff Daniels looked to be about 40 pounds overweight and 40 years older than the character he played in &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Another jolting and foolish bit of hubis that detracts from the video is the intoduction of Ted Turner (ego-man) in a frivilous cameo that contributes nothing and generally detracts from the video's flow.The bad stuff: This video has all the dash and tempo of a dead cat.

755772,A3HYCGZ5CKCZIH,B00009OOFA,"G. T. Howell ""neogalahad""","[8, 12]","It seems that most reviews of G&G; are either five stars or one star -- people either love it or hate it.  I'm somewhere in between.  As a reenactor who participated in the filming, I was counting the days until it was released in theaters.  I must confess that I was disappointed by the finished product (the best thing about it was seeing myself on screen a few times!).First, the GOOD:The film's greatest strength is its excellent portrait of people of faith.  Christians are usually portrayed in the media as either uptight hypocrites, ignorant redneck simpletons, or demented serial killers.  It's refreshing to see a movie that honors faith and shows the Bible and prayer in a positive light.Stephen Lang does an excellent job portraying Jackson, perfectly capturing both the fiery warrior and the pious, loving husband and father.  By the way, in person he's a heck of a nice guy.  I also think that Duvall makes a better Lee than did Martin Sheen, although he doesn't get much screen time.The battle scenes are generally good (except for the CGI), and the music is effective.  Some would say the score is maudlin, but I thought the emotion was appropriate, and I liked the full orchestra better than the more synthesized ""Gettysburg"" soundtrack.  G'burg's main theme is more memorable, though.The DVD also features some nice extras, more than the typical movie.Now for the BAD:As other reviewers have pointed out, the dialogue sounded stiff and wooden.  Ron Maxwell did take much of it from letters of the period, but that's the problem.  Writing (and even speaking to some degree) in the Victorian period tended to be flowery and overly sentimental, something that Michael Shaara took into account when he wrote ""The Killer Angels"" (he mentions it in the forward).  It's no wonder that everybody in G&G; seems to be giving a speech.The book on which G&G; is based is not the easiest book to turn into a film; unlike ""Gettysburg"", it covers several years instead of a single battle.  Nevertheless, the film is a poor adaptation.  The first hundred pages of the novel are completely skipped, and Maxwell devotes way too much screen time to Jackson.  Hancock is a major character in the novel, but here he's hardly more than a bit player.  His relationship with Confederate general Armistead is one of the most moving elements of Gettysburg, and Maxwell wasted a golden opportunity to expand on it.  Even General Lee gets shortchanged.Although the film is generally accurate, it presents a skewed vision of the issues surrounding the war.  ""Gettysburg"" was more balanced, highlighting the issues that honorable men on both sides cared about.  G&G; on the other hand is a valentine to the ""Lost Cause"".  For example, we see a montage of Southern men preparing to leave home and gear up for war.  We get to see their wives, children and sweethearts, but we never see anything like this for the Northern side other than Chamberlain's wife Fanny.  At the same time that the South was mobilizing, thousands of Northern men were lining up in droves to defend the Old Flag and the Constitution.  They were just as sincere and passionate about their cause, but we see none of that in this film.  Slavery is glossed over completely, and even made to look downright pleasant.The one problem that dwarfs all the others is pacing.  Anyone who has watched TV or movies much has a sense of the timing or rhythm of a scene, but whoever edited this film had no ""feel"" whatsoever.  In G&G;, some scenes open and nothing happens for a full minute of screen time.  The camera pans around the room as the characters sit placidly sewing or sipping punch.

755773,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B00009OOFA,HAMLET,"[2, 2]","The Extended Director's Cut of the Civil War epic drama Gods And Generals is, in many ways, better than the theatrical cut. The additional scenes reveal more about the characters, and how life was back then in the mid-19th century. However, I'm disappointed that two scenes which are in the theatrical version were deleted from the Director's Cut. I think those scenes showed what the characters were really like, even though other scenes supply the void by the omission of those scenes. The first scene in question is when General Jackson (Stephen Lang) prayeth unto God prior to the battle of Manassas. The scene showed clearly how strongly he believed in Almighty God, and even though, of course, Jackson's faith is mentioned/made explicit in other scenes, I feel that the omission of this scene from the Extended Director's Cut was an error in judgement on the director's part. The second scene involves Martha (Donzaleigh Abernathy) quoting from the Book of Esther to a dying soldier, and its effect on General Burnside. The scene showed how strongly the women and men on both sides of the war believed in Almighty God.The film is an hour longer than the theatrical cut, but don't let that stop you from viewing one of the greatest war films ever made. Yes, it is primarily a motion picture about the first part of the Civil War, but it's much more than that. It's a historical drama that keenly examines both sides of the conflict and the men/women involved. In this day and age, where Almighty God is blasphemed in movies, television, radio and magazines, it's refreshing to see a motion picture depicting a time where God was reverenced, and how faith in Him & belief on His only begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus leadeth unto reward; if not in this life, then certainly in the next.Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.",5,"Better Motion Picture, But Sorely Missed Two Scenes,",1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,1848,"['Extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Civil', 'War', 'epic', 'drama', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'additional', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'more', 'characters', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'However', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'theatrical', 'version', 'were', 'deleted', 'Director', 'Cut', 'think', 'scenes', 'showed', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'like', 'even', 'other', 'scenes', 'supply', 'void', 'omission', 'scenes', 'first', 'scene', 'question', 'when', 'General', 'Jackson', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'unto', 'God', 'prior', 'battle', 'Manassas', 'scene', 'showed', 'clearly', 'how', 'strongly', 'believed', 'Almighty', 'God', 'even', 'course', 'Jackson', 'faith', 'mentioned/made', 'explicit', 'other', 'scenes', 'feel', 'omission', 'scene', 'Extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'was', 'error', 'judgement', 'director', 'part', 'second', 'scene', 'Martha', 'Donzaleigh', 'Abernathy', 'quoting', 'Book', 'Esther', 'dying', 'soldier', 'effect', 'General', 'Burnside', 'scene', 'showed', 'how', 'strongly', 'women', 'men', 'sides', 'war', 'believed', 'Almighty', 'God.The', 'film', 'hour', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'viewing', 'one', 'greatest', 'war', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Yes', 'primarily', 'motion', 'picture', 'first', 'part', 'Civil', 'War', 'much', 'more', 'historical', 'drama', 'keenly', 'examines', 'sides', 'conflict', 'men/women', 'involved', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'Almighty', 'God', 'blasphemed', 'movies', 'television', 'radio', 'magazines', 'refreshing', 'see', 'motion', 'picture', 'depicting', 'time', 'where', 'God', 'was', 'reverenced', 'how', 'faith', 'Him', 'belief', 'only', 'begotten', 'Son', 'Lord', 'Saviour', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'unto', 'reward', 'not', 'life', 'then', 'certainly', 'next.Rated', 'PG-13', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'PG']",N/A

I found it a fascinating portrait of General 'Stonewall' Jackson during the early years of the civil war, and to some lesser extent his relationship with General Lee. This movie was not intended to be a 'fair and balanced' depiction of the years 1861-1863 for both North and South; it is about stunning victories of the South due in no small part to the generalship of General Thomas Jackson. Although there is some view from the Northern perspective in the battles depicted, it is really a movie about Jackson and how pivital he was to the early Confederate victories.Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine Regiment is given some lengthy treatment at the Battle of Fedricksburg in great part due to the pivotal role the 20th Maine would play later in the eventual defeat of Lee at Gettysburg and is featured in this movie's sequal ""Gettysburg"". It was a good attempt at continuity between the two movies.The 'commentary' on both ""G and G"" discs is also excellent and very informative with a good discussion of the events surrounding Stonewall Jackson's accidental shooting by his own men during the Battle of Chancellorsville. It is interesting to speculate about the outcome of the war had Jackson survived. Lee was a stratigic genius and Jackson was his tactical genius. When informed of Jacksons injuries, Lee reportedly said ""General Jackson has lost his left arm, I have lost my right arm.""

The ""its too loooong"" whine says more about our pathetic attention spans than it does about the film. 19th century Americans were different. They were sentimental,romantic and devoutly religious. They counted many things more valuable than their own lives.First of all, this is so much better that ""Gettysburg"" (which was really a B movie) that any comparisons to the contrary leave me wondering if there is ANOTHER Gettysburg out there I have not seen. The acting from Duval's Lee to Lang's Jackson is riveting. The painstaking attention to historical detail and overall cinematic skill makes this feel more like time travel than a movie.What really infuriates the critics is the complete and total destruction of the anti-South construct that has been so emphatically propounded all these years. The South saw this as it was, another war of independence. The Republicans did not set out to abolish slavery, Congress affirmed the goal of the war in 1862 (by resolution) was to ""preserve the union, not free the slave"". Even a cursory study of the Emancipation Proclamation reveals it freed no one. A post mortem which includes a census review indicated 95% of the slaves were owned by just 5% of the population and 30% of free blacks living in the south were themselves slave owners.Unfortunately this film was so savaged by the so-called open-minded and tolerant that it was DOA when it arrived in the movie houses. A shame. Together with ""To Ride With the Devil"", (an Ang Lee film about the border war) these films could introduce Americans to the most significant chapter of their own history with real history. Other than one comment made by Jackson (concerning ""the Institute"") just before the climatic charge at Chancellorsville this film is a dead ringer. It is time travel. Ignore everything you have ever heard, open your mind to  brand new experience, give yourself a few hours to experience this and absorb it at its own pace.

It's pretty hard to get heated up about a movie like, say, Gladiator, for being unkind to ancient Germanic tribesman or  distorting the true nature of Roman slavery or, well, whatever.Not so with a movie about the Civil War. It's a divisive subject, and for good reason. I think it's pretty important in a day and age when racism still exists to approach the Civil War with a sense that while all war might be tragedy where good and innocent people of many creeds die for what they believe to be truth, it is BETTER that the North won, and that slavery was abolished and Southern feudal aristocracy was (mostly) dismantled. This movie is complete revisionist history where the South and its cause are shown as being identically moral (if not superior) to the North and its cause. The few black characters are shockingly and cynically shown to be some kind of southern patriots, loyal to their slaveowners.Why make a movie like this today? Why, pardon the pun, whitewash the Confederacy? Why garner sympathy for an institution that was 100% bound up and identified with chattel slavery and the dehumanization of African-Americans?Fortunately for all the frightening implications of these questions, this movie is too long, talky, unbearably self-important, and just plain soporific.

Though the battle scenes themselves are expertly choreographed, hardly any thought seems to have gone into the cinematography of these scenes as they lack imagination in their framing and execution. Yet, I found the battle scenes alone worth the price of admission.I cannot say the same for Maxwell's bloated screenplay which is filled with flowery dialogue, long-winded speeches, and droning soliloquies.  Yes, citizens of the nineteenth century spoke differently than we do today, but the dialogue is so jarring to the modern ear that it is nearly impossible for an audience to maintain a willingness to suspend its disbelief.The narrative in Mr. Shaara's novel is nearly equally split between four major characters: Colonel Joshua Chamberlain and General Winfield Scott Hancock on the side of the Union and Generals Robert E. Lee and Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson on the Confederate side, while Mr. Maxwell's adaptation can nearly be considered as a Stonewall Jackson bio-pic with the other characters merely as supporting players.  Shaara's book maintains a balance of viewpoints of both North and South but, Maxwell's film tilts the majority of screen time to the Confederate side.Stephen Lang does an admirable job as the highly religious Stonewall Jackson.  Indeed, the film's shining glory is that Maxwell's screenplay and Lang's performance come closest to capturing the man that Jonathan Jackson was in reality as anything yet set forth on film.  Though it is hard to separate Lang from his earlier portrayal of General George Picket in ""Gettysburg.""  Jeff Daniels competently reprises his role as Chamberlain, though he lacks screen time and is saddled with reciting Lucanus' ""The Crossing of the Rubicon"" as he watches elements the Union Army crossing the Rappahanock River into Fredericksburg, Virginia.  The films greatest disappointment was Robert Duvall in his lackluster performance as General Robert E. Lee.Randy Edelman's sentimental score is adequate to the task at hand, and though pleasurable to listen to it does not rise to meet the challenge of the material presented.  Mary Fahl's contribution, ""Going Home,"" played over the opening credits of windblown battle flags, in a movie which the director well knows is going to come in at 3  hours, should have fallen to the cutting room floor, though I love every note of it.  And Bob Dylan is as raspy as ever in his ""Cross the Green Mountain"" played over the end credits.Is ""Gods and Generals"" the greatest movie ever made about the American Civil War?  No.  Is it the most accurate movie about the Civil War?  Quite possibly.  But accuracy could not save this movie.  Editing could.  Edit the screenplay.  Edit the dialogue and speeches.

Lee (in Gettysburg) much more effectively as an aristocratic Southern gentleman than Robert Duvall does in this picture.  Duvall is a great actor, but more suitable for workingman roles.(2) Whatever the other causes for secession, the fact that it happened right after Lincoln's election and also John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859 shows that slavery was a primary motivating force.  The South was afraid that the North was aiming to free the slaves.  It turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, since Lincoln's main goal was to preserve the Union, but that is another story.There is nothing wrong with presenting the Southern point of view, if that is what this movie is supposed to do.

In fact, the battle is more Lee and Longstreet than anything.The movie treats Burnside harshly repeating all the discredited ""should a, would a, could a"" arguments used against him.Chancellorsville is the best of the battles.  The attack is well done and the route of Howard's Corps realistic.  Jackson's wounding is accurate.Left out of the movie is every questionable Jackson performance in battle and every silly argument he started or continued.The only hint of personnel problems is in two small scenes, quickly ended.Over one hour of additional footage makes this a true extended edition.This is not holding a scene longer or a couple of extra camera shots.John Wilkes Booth and Antietam are not in the original release.Blu-ray produces a scrumptious visual feast.This is the type of film that makes Blu-ray worthwhile with long battle lines and landscapes.Special features are a new introduction and commentaries.This is the prequel to ""Gettysburg"" and uses many of the same actors.The years between the two movies has visibly aged several of them.The result can be disconcerting with men well into middle-age playing characters in their 30s.Much of this is nitpicking.For a Civil War person this is a real treat at a great price.

As I watched this film I couldn't help but remember a t-shirt that was always for sale within the magazine's pages: ""GOD GUNS & GUTS MADE AMERICA GREAT."" That seems to be the message of this historical epic, except that, here, the message is that they made the Confederacy great too.The film starts out with Robert Duvall, as Robert E. Lee, expressing his sympathy for the Southern cause to a Federal official offering him a high position in the Union Army. The film portrays the Confederates as being moved not as much by support for slavery, but against what they see as an armed invasion of their lands by their own countrymen. We also get to hear the Northerners side of it, and neither side is demonized in this film.It's not about good guys and bad guys: The film tries to show that both sides had moral reasons for going to war; that men on both sides were brave and honorable; and that Christianity and God loomed large in the hearts of Confederates and Unionists alike. For example, when asked why he is so fearless, ""Stonewall"" Jackson replies: ""My religious beliefs teach me to feel as safe in battle as in bed. God has fixed the time of my death. I do not concern myself with that but to be always ready whenever it should overtake me.""The film ultimately tilts to the Southern side, only because it focuses more on Confederate General ""Stonewall"" Jackson than anyone else.  The film takes us from the dawn of the War right up to General Jackson's death by friendly fire at Chancellorsville.It is a long film - very long - and those with short attention spans may not be able to last to the end.

Darling,"[2, 6]","I waited oh-so anxiously for the release of ""Gods and Generals"" - anticipating a movie as good as - if not better than - ""Gettysburg""... but, left the theater wondering, ""What the ---- was THAT rubbish?!""A title such as ""Gods and Generals"" woud lead one to believe that there would have been more focus on the various commanders during the early part of The War Between The States. Maybe a little more character development and relationship building amongst the commanders and their regiments - after all, it WAS supposed to be a ""prequel"" to the previous film. But, I soon realized what the movie was turning into: ""God and Stonewall Jackson"".A completely one-sided view of the war, it made Jackson out to be like Christ, and the Union army of the Potomac a bunch of sad, mislead (ideologically speaking - they WERE mislead militarily speaking) bafoons. It had potential at the beginning. I felt it had captured the atmosphere surrounding the prelude to war quite well. But, after the First Bull Run segment was over, it collpased into a mess.How can you leave out the Battle of Antietam - completely - while dealing with the first half of the war? So many great vignettes were lost in favor of such rubbish as a friendship being built between Stonewall Jackson and a little 6-year old (?) Virginia girl... (""All the daddys will come home..."")

755789,A2K8LG0NQ7W5X0,B00009OOFA,J. Collins,"[2, 10]","&quot;Gods and Generals&quot; is the second of a film trilogy based on the Schaaras' historical novels of the Civil War.  Whereas the first film, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; concentrated on its eponymous battle, GandG tells the story of the war from its inception until Chancellorsville.  The movie also follows the life of Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson during the same period.  The producers made much of their painstaking attention to historical accuracy in rendering the details.  No doubt, the uniforms, accoutrements and weapons are as accurate as it's humanly possible to recreate.  Also, the producers accepted the input from historians regarding the re-enactors in the previous film.  The main gripes were a-too old (average age was 23-25) and b-too fat, especially the Confederates.  These minor issues were corrected in GandG.  One lesson from &quot;Gettysburg&quot; went unlearned though.As my stolen quote from Frederick the Great implies, there's just too much movie here timing out at roughly 4 hours.  Simultaneously describing the war in the Eastern theater and details of General Jackson's life is doable in a novel; it just doesn't work on screen.  Much screen time is consumed in introducing non sequitur characters/events that add nothing to moving the plot ahead (and hey, I'm a military historian).  Two examples:  as Jackson moves towards Manassas Junction, he encounters Trimble entraining troops.  He exchanges words with him, and we don't see him again, except as a callback to the previous film.  Second, at Fredericksburg we see line after line...after line of Union troops moving against Marye's heights.  But we as viewers have NO idea who these brigades and leaders are, or why they are highlighted.  Finally, the one holdover from Gettysburg is the dialogue; lifted apparently from the Schaara novel.  Neither the Schaaras nor the screenwriters seem to appreciate that 19th century written and spoken English were two different dialects.  Written English was very flowery and indirect:  exactly what the characters recite, making every conversation sound like speechifying.  Speaking of actors, Stephen Lang's Jackson is excellent, though not as eccentric or politically incorrect as in history.  He was a hypochrondriac among other things and believed slavery &quot;ordained by God&quot;.  Duvall's Lee is better rendered than Sheen's though reduced to the marble-man by the script.

Delbert Brooks ""Doc Brooks""","[4, 7]","After seeing the movie &amp; reading several reviews, it is obvious that the problems that resulted in the civil war have not been resolved, &amp; need to be addressed. I thought the movie was an excellent attempt to historical accuracy, while still making a small profit for the investors, on a limited budget. Massive sets would have been costly &amp; would not have added that much to the movie. Although wordy, much of the dialog was gleaned from the letters written &amp; saved from the time, &amp; people did &amp; do speak as they write. But by being less bloody &amp; gory, its makes the film viewable by the very young, who truly need to be the ones to learn the 'lessons' of the civil war. The remaining problems still need to be resolved, &amp; we must learn to forgive both the North &amp; South for the transgressions of the other, &amp; move on as a stronger, more powerful nation, respecting the views of each. I spent 20 years in active military service &amp; another 15 as a civilian &amp; reservist. I have served with all five services &amp; lived in both Northern, Southern &amp; Western states.

When you see Fredericksburg  the town and the hill they tried to capture , the movie makes more sense. The average moviegoer has never gone to a Civil war battlefield and to them it's just savage fighting and dying. That's why this movie was a flop. It cost 85 million to make this movie and they only grossed 12 million, so no wonder why Ted Turner won't make the final part of this trilogy.Too bad they didn't release the Directors cut with all the extra footage and better editing. Maybe the movie would have done better when released.I thought this movie was good , fine  acting, good battle scenes and fantastic special effects like the computer generated scene showing Frederickburg and the train crossing the Rappahanock. Stephen Lang was perfect for the role of Stonewall Jackson, very believable. Robert Duvall is related to Robert E Lee and he was more believable as lee then Martin Sheen. Martin Sheen was great in Gettysburg but he didn't look like Lee. Robert Duvall owns a farm in Virginia ( he says it's the next stop before Heaven) and there was a Civil war battle on his property and he digs up Civil war stuff from time to time. Part of Gods and Generals was filmed on his land.People complained the movie was overly sympathetic to the South. But have they ever made a movie showing the Confederate side ? The South won one battle after another the first 2 years of the war and the movie had to show the Confederate side more then the Union side. The critics hated this movie because Hollywood would never had made this movie . Gods And Generals was much better then the recently released Lincoln movie. The movie Lincoln was garbage in my opionion. I'm a Northener and I liked Gods and Generals.

But though this film as flaws, I liked the story of Stonewall Jackson, rise & fall, and think it was handled fairly and withouttypical Hollywood leftwing bias.  The opening title and especially the theme song was so beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes.Sometimes I just like listening to the theme song over and over: sad  almost like a funeral, perhaps because of what happened toJackson at the end.  The character of Lee was well played by Duvall, though the guy who played Longstreet was weak. Actorsplaying Chamberlain and his brother were brought back but they were not as effective as they were in GETTYSBURG by the sameproducers.  Still, the story of Jackson was well  worth the purchase of this DVD set.  A beautiful rendition of A BONNY BLUE FLAGwas done though why such liberals as Ted Turner were there in Confederate Uniforms was puzzling.  Jackson was shown as beingmerciless in battle, but compassionate other times, especially with the little girl go died.  The sets and photography were very goodand battles good, but curiously the original versions skipped over the battle of Antietiam which was added to a degree in the ex-panded version.  This battle was played down, but  Antietiam showed up the flaws that Lee sometimes shown.  I believe thatAntietiam was the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, not Gettysburg.  Overall I give this special edition four stars and Ithink it is very good purchase for those who like Civil War movies.  I do recommend this be bought with GETTYSBURG as theywere intended to be companion films.  I will review Gettysburg later.  enjoy!",4,STONEWALLS DO NOT STAND FOREVER,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,1729,"['movie', 'came', 'critical', 'reviews', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'history', 'especially', 'War', 'theStates', 'film', 'flaws', 'liked', 'story', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'rise', 'fall', 'think', 'was', 'handled', 'fairly', 'withouttypical', 'Hollywood', 'leftwing', 'bias', 'opening', 'title', 'especially', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes.Sometimes', 'just', 'listening', 'theme', 'song', 'sad', 'almost', 'funeral', 'perhaps', 'what', 'happened', 'toJackson', 'end', 'character', 'Lee', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'Duvall', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Longstreet', 'was', 'weak', 'Actorsplaying', 'Chamberlain', 'brother', 'were', 'brought', 'back', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'were', 'GETTYSBURG', 'sameproducers', 'Still', 'story', 'Jackson', 'was', 'well', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'set', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'A', 'BONNY', 'BLUE', 'FLAGwas', 'done', 'why', 'such', 'liberals', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'were', 'there', 'Confederate', 'Uniforms', 'was', 'puzzling', 'Jackson', 'was', 'shown', 'beingmerciless', 'battle', 'compassionate', 'other', 'times', 'especially', 'little', 'girl', 'go', 'died', 'sets', 'photography', 'were', 'very', 'goodand', 'battles', 'good', 'curiously', 'original', 'versions', 'skipped', 'battle', 'Antietiam', 'was', 'added', 'degree', 'ex-panded', 'version', 'battle', 'was', 'played', 'down', 'Antietiam', 'showed', 'up', 'flaws', 'Lee', 'sometimes', 'shown', 'believe', 'thatAntietiam', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'Confederacy', 'not', 'Gettysburg', 'Overall', 'give', 'special', 'edition', 'four', 'stars', 'Ithink', 'very', 'good', 'purchase', 'who', 'like', 'Civil', 'War', 'movies', 'do', 'recommend', 'be', 'bought', 'GETTYSBURG', 'theywere', 'intended', 'be', 'companion', 'films', 'will', 'review', 'Gettysburg', 'later', 'enjoy']",N/A
755793,AOT86E19KMKOJ,B00009OOFA,"J. Groen ""Jerry Groen""","[3, 6]","Although this film has some biases and issues with it, this is a good film.  I want to  highlight some the reasons why and provide some issues that I have with it.There are some excellent scenes in this film.  The sacrifice of the Union troops has never (and probably never will) been more memorably shown than in the charge of the Union brigades up Marye's Heights.  The charge of the Irish brigade in this battle has always been a memorable event in paintings, and books, and this movie does an excellent job of showing that.  To increase the human interest, the fact that an Irish regiment from Georgia was fighting them is provided (which is true)..., and the irony of their statements, ""don't they know that we are fighting for our freedom?"" and the fact that they are the Irish brigade troops are being duped, etc.  Well, who is being duped and really understands the cause of this war?  This is brought on a little later when a Negro lady housekeeper talks with General Hancock, the same housekeeper who helped the strong Confederate supporting family leave the home, over the wounded and dying Union soldiers, thanking him for fighting for her freedom.There are other scenes like that, the attack of the 20th Maine, Chamberlain's regiment is handled beautifully (if something as shocking as this can be called beautiful) with very reverant music in the background right in line with the sacrifice that they were called on to make (by a stupid General - Burnside, I might add).Well, now for the negatives: the movie does lean too much to the south - playing General Jackson as this demi-god, although giving some time to his eccentricities.  At the end, when time was spent and spent at his death bed, I found that I couldn't finish watching this.  OK, he was a great general, but... And, all the scenes of the Confederate army and their parties and other events.Yet, all in all, this is a good movie.  Another highlight is the start of the movie which shows Union and Confederate flags flowing while a beautifully sung song is in the background.  It showed good taste for the start of a good movie.",4,Good Film with Some Memorable Scenes,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2106,"['film', 'biases', 'issues', 'good', 'film', 'want', 'highlight', 'reasons', 'why', 'provide', 'issues', 'have', 'it.There', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'film', 'sacrifice', 'Union', 'troops', 'never', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'been', 'more', 'memorably', 'shown', 'charge', 'Union', 'up', 'Marye', 'Heights', 'charge', 'Irish', 'brigade', 'battle', 'always', 'been', 'memorable', 'event', 'paintings', 'books', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'increase', 'human', 'interest', 'fact', 'Irish', 'regiment', 'Georgia', 'was', 'fighting', 'provided', 'true', 'irony', 'statements', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'fact', 'are', 'Irish', 'brigade', 'troops', 'are', 'being', 'duped', 'etc', 'Well', 'who', 'being', 'duped', 'really', 'cause', 'war', 'brought', 'little', 'later', 'when', 'Negro', 'lady', 'housekeeper', 'talks', 'General', 'Hancock', 'same', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'helped', 'strong', 'Confederate', 'supporting', 'family', 'leave', 'home', 'wounded', 'dying', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'thanking', 'fighting', 'freedom.There', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'attack', '20th', 'Maine', 'Chamberlain', 'regiment', 'handled', 'beautifully', 'something', 'as', 'shocking', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'beautiful', 'very', 'reverant', 'music', 'background', 'right', 'line', 'sacrifice', 'were', 'called', 'make', 'stupid', 'General', 'Burnside', 'might', 'add', '.Well', 'now', 'negatives', 'movie', 'lean', 'too', 'much', 'south', 'playing', 'General', 'Jackson', 'demi-god', 'giving', 'time', 'eccentricities', 'end', 'when', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'spent', 'death', 'bed', 'found', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching', 'OK', 'was', 'great', 'general', 'scenes', 'Confederate', 'army', 'parties', 'other', 'events.Yet', 'good', 'movie', 'highlight', 'start', 'movie', 'Union', 'Confederate', 'flags', 'flowing', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'song', 'background', 'showed', 'good', 'taste', 'start', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

But it seems a lot of people made up for it by getting the DVD. Perhaps it was the movie's length that put people off sitting in the theater. I am sorry I missed the spectacle of seeing it on the big screen, but having bought the DVD, I rejoice in possessing this well-made and stirring film.I commend Creighton Lovelace for his insightful review and roundly chastize Cheryl Zaleski for her patronizing and insulting remarks. I did not grow up in this country and so got my understanding of the American Civil War from Hollywood, as many non-Americans would. I imbibed the common and flawed view that it was all about slavery. It seems any other history about the reasons for the war was suppressed until recently. Now we have books like The Real Lincoln, by Thomas DiLorenzo. Now it is not only die-hard descendants of Confederates who know the truth - that Lincoln had far less noble reasons for invading the south.There are many remarkable things about this movie, but what is really striking is its devotion to authenticity, probably more than any other movie made about the Civil War. And this from the funding and production of arch-liberal Ted Turner. What a shock! It seems Ted does have some redeeming values. Any story about the life of &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson that diminishes or ignores his Christian faith does not honor the man or history. In this movie we are blessed to see how profoundly Jackson's faith guides his relationship with his wife, his response to the Virginia secession and his life as a soldier. He had a difficult task at a tragic time in history, but he responded with prayerful deliberation. We see him praying with his wife, with a black cook working for the Confederate Army (both voicing their petition for God's justice to be done), and before doing battle.With this sometimes word for word dialogue from official historical documents and personal diaries, and with the battle scenes often re-enacted in real time, some people could get bored with this movie. But that is to miss its value as a documentary drama, an antidote to decades of misinformation about the Civil War. We could do with more re-appraisal of Lincoln's saintly status, delving deeper into his ambitions (and success) in creating a highly centralized, activist state as opposed to the limited form of government intended by the founding fathers. Also the revelations that Lincoln never believed in racial equality.As for the reviewer who complained about the army uniforms being inauthentic, you are obviously wrong because this production went to great pains to recreate exact duplicates of the various uniforms. Also, do you think every footsoldier would be personally outfitted in a form-fitting uniform? Duh, with a war on you don't exactly have time. See the behind the scenes feature &quot;The Authenticities of the Film.&quot; The same goes for using Harper's Ferry for Fredericksburg.

755796,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00009OOFA,Joe Sherry,"[4, 7]","A film by Ronald MaxwellGods and Generals is the Civil War epic that is a prequel to Maxwell's own Gettysburg.  It is based on the novel by Jeff Shaara.  Rather than telling a narrative story with a plot, Gods and Generals is an examination of the men (mostly Southern) during 1861-1863.  The major players are General Robert E Lee (Robert Duvall) and General Stonewall Jackson (Stephen Lang).The movie itself is a collection of scenes, personal glimpses into the lives of the soldiers that don't really amount to much.  We see that Stonewall Jackson is a very devout Christian and that he believes in the rightness of the Southern Cause (as presented by the movie, this cause is not slavery but rather the encroaching of the federal government on the rights of the states).  The Southerners are presented in an even handed light and not as evil slaveholders.  They are men, just like northerners, who believe their view of government is correct.  This is more of a sympathetic view of the Confederacy than I have ever seen in a movie.  The movie contains several intense battle scenes, and even though it may seem incredible to the modern man, these are highly accurate accounts of Civil War battles...men walking right into the line of fire because that is how the battle is fought.Gods and Generals comes off feeling like more of a re-enactment of the Civil War than a film telling a story.  On one hand, this is a good thing.  The accuracy of the movie helps the believability of the movie.  The downside to this is simply that there is so much detail in getting everything right that Ronald Maxwell forgot to tell a story.  The movie is just lacking a narrative spark.

It is a prequel to &quot;Gettysburg&quot; made 11 years ago yet the first of a planned trilogy.The war is pursued thru its protagonist, General  Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. By the way, he disliked that nickname. He was a very devout man &amp; believed in predestiny,  therefore was utterly fearless. As he fought it, this movie is definitely rebel friendly. Jackson was portrayed as a highly moral man with integrity. Questions such as slavery are neatly glossed over. The first three battles are nicely outlined without getting bogged down in boring (to some) details.Training &amp; recruiting of civilians without a clue is covered. This use of nonprofessional soldiers &amp; the advance of weapons technology since the last major conflict, the Napoleonic wars, 35 years before, make this one of the first modern wars in history.The south had the best generals such as Jackson, Beaureguard &amp; Lee, played superbly by Robert Duval. It was as I imagined him.As good as the southern general were the northern generals  were insubordinate, (to Lincoln) cowardly &amp; incompetant. They delayed after Bull Run allowing the Confederates who were out-gunned &amp; out-manned to build impregnable defenses. Stupidly, the union generals threw waves of young men into frontal assualts repeatedly. I imagine that is where the term &quot;cannon fodder&quot; was coined. The carnage yielded nothing &amp; the Yankees retreated.

Stephen Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson was on target for it's authenticity! Robert Duvall was a perfect choice as General Lee. (Thank God for that, Martin Sheen was terrible in Gettysburg).I liked the film's opening with Mary Fahl's ""Going Home"" with the various state battle flags. It's a shame that ""Gods and Generals"" didn't come out before the half-baked ""Gettysburg.""Ted Turner certainly put more of his heart into ""Gods."" Look for Turner's cameo appearance at the film's mid-point. I believe the film would have been better if more details would have given to events leading up to the war from both sides. That I guess would have added at least another hour of footage.From the film, I enjoyed finally seeing overdue justice given to Stonewall Jackson. Having read extensively on Jackson's life and military campaigns, I always believed a movie about him would be great project. ""Gods"" brings a deeply personal sketch of Jackson's Christian character as a devoted husband, soldier, and servant of the Lord. Unfortunately, contemporary film viewers may find ""Gods"" difficult to identify with.I enjoyed the film's portrayal of Lee and Jackson's strategic military planning for Chancellorsville.

755799,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B00009OOFA,John Morgan,"[8, 12]","Given the mostly negative reviews that this film has received on Amazon, I can only conclude that it appeals exclusively to history buffs. And indeed, if you're not interested in the U.S. Civil War or American history in general, there's probably not much of interest for you in this film. But if you are, you'll be pleased to know that in terms of historical drama, it is a quite remarkable document. It was produced by the same team that made the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; and indeed &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; is billed as the first part of a trilogy of which &quot;Gettysburg&quot; is the second part. However, apart from the fact that a few of the same actors play identical roles in both films, there is very little similarity between them in either style or substance. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; focused exclusively on a time period of four days and a single battle, while &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; attempts to cover more than two years of history in the same amount of running time. Also, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; went for intensive, realistic depiction of combat, while &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; instead consists primarily of melodrama. And rather than the war itself being the focus, as was the case in &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; in &quot;Gods &amp; Generals,&quot; the life of General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson is the point of focus for the surrounding action. Only three battles are featured: the First Battle of Bull Run/Manassas in 1861, Fredericksburg in 1862, and Chancellorsville in 1863. While each of them are interesting, none of the battle scenes in &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; even come close to the intensity achieved in &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; but I suppose this is the inevitable result of trying to squeeze so much into so short a time. Frequently, the film seems more like a stage play than a film, with many of the characters delivering long monologues in lofty language while looking directly toward the camera. Still, I found this to be a strength of the film rather than a weakness. It may not make for the most realistic dramatic action, but unlike most war films, we actually come to know something about the thoughts, feelings and motives of the major characters as opposed to reducing them to moving targets waiting to be shot down. We glimpse something of the cultural and intellectual milieu of the time, with the characters making frequent reference to the Greeks and Romans, and we see a bit of the aristocratic culture of the Virginian upper class of the time, from which the Confederate officer class was derived. Although in their zeal to portray the Confederates in a sympathetic light, the filmmakers tend to whitewash the realities of slavery at the time - as in one scene, in which Gen. Jackson expresses to his personal Black servant his hope that the Confederate government will free the slaves before the U.S. government can beat them to it. This seems to suggest that the Confederate leadership didn't see themselves as fighting in defense of the institution of slavery - which, if one knows the circumstances which led to the outbreak of war, rings hollow. But as the film is more about the war itself than its causes, this is an excusable blemish. Stephen Lang's performance as Jackson is definitely the highlight of the film. One wishes that Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee would have been given more screen time, as the little bit of his performance that we do get is quite remarkable, far outshining Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee in &quot;Gettysburg.&quot; One hopes that Duvall will reprise the role for the conclusion of the trilogy in &quot;The Last Full Measure.&quot; If the producers manage to combine the dramatic intensity and performances of &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; with the kinds of battle scenes in &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; it could very well end up being the greatest Civil War film to date.",4,"Not perfect, but still a great Civil War film.",1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,3897,"['Given', 'mostly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'Amazon', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'appeals', 'exclusively', 'history', 'buffs', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'not', 'interested', 'U.S.', 'Civil', 'War', 'American', 'history', 'general', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'interest', 'film', 'are', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'terms', 'historical', 'drama', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'document', 'was', 'produced', 'same', 'team', 'made', '1993', 'film', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'indeed', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'billed', 'first', 'part', 'trilogy', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'second', 'part', 'However', 'apart', 'fact', 'few', 'same', 'actors', 'play', 'identical', 'roles', 'films', 'very', 'little', 'similarity', 'style', 'substance', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'focused', 'exclusively', 'time', 'period', 'four', 'days', 'single', 'battle', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'attempts', 'cover', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'history', 'same', 'amount', 'running', 'time', 'Also', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'went', 'intensive', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'combat', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'instead', 'primarily', 'melodrama', 'rather', 'war', 'being', 'focus', 'was', 'case', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'life', 'General', 'Thomas', 'quot', 'Stonewall', 'quot', 'Jackson', 'point', 'focus', 'surrounding', 'action', 'Only', 'three', 'battles', 'are', 'featured', 'First', 'Battle', 'Bull', 'Run/Manassas', '1861', 'Fredericksburg', '1862', 'Chancellorsville', '1863', 'are', 'interesting', 'none', 'battle', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'intensity', 'achieved', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'suppose', 'inevitable', 'result', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'short', 'time', 'Frequently', 'film', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'many', 'characters', 'delivering', 'long', 'monologues', 'lofty', 'language', 'looking', 'directly', 'camera', 'Still', 'found', 'be', 'strength', 'film', 'rather', 'weakness', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'most', 'realistic', 'dramatic', 'action', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'actually', 'come', 'know', 'something', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'motives', 'major', 'characters', 'opposed', 'reducing', 'moving', 'targets', 'waiting', 'be', 'shot', 'down', 'glimpse', 'something', 'cultural', 'intellectual', 'milieu', 'time', 'characters', 'making', 'frequent', 'reference', 'Greeks', 'Romans', 'see', 'bit', 'aristocratic', 'culture', 'Virginian', 'upper', 'class', 'time', 'Confederate', 'officer', 'class', 'was', 'derived', 'zeal', 'portray', 'Confederates', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'filmmakers', 'tend', 'whitewash', 'realities', 'slavery', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'Gen.', 'Jackson', 'personal', 'Black', 'servant', 'hope', 'Confederate', 'government', 'will', 'free', 'slaves', 'U.S.', 'government', 'can', 'beat', 'suggest', 'Confederate', 'leadership', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fighting', 'defense', 'institution', 'slavery', 'one', 'circumstances', 'led', 'outbreak', 'war', 'rings', 'hollow', 'film', 'more', 'war', 'causes', 'excusable', 'blemish', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'performance', 'Jackson', 'definitely', 'highlight', 'film', 'One', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'little', 'bit', 'performance', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'far', 'outshining', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'quot', 'Gettysburg.', 'quot', 'One', 'Duvall', 'will', 'reprise', 'role', 'conclusion', 'trilogy', 'quot', 'Last', 'Full', 'Measure.', 'quot', 'producers', 'manage', 'combine', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'performances', 'quot', 'Gods', 'amp', 'Generals', 'quot', 'kinds', 'battle', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Gettysburg', 'quot', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'greatest', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'date']",N/A

It is so painstakingly boring and dull that only the fanatics could care about it. It is as if any interest in the film is tossed aside, just so the small amount of true CWBs out there can enjoy it, and nudge each other when their favorite historical figure comes on screen. Which, by the way, is easy to note, as every time anyone comes on screen--or any location comes on screen--white subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, telling us who or what we are looking at, in such a fashion that only the true illiterates in the audience would have a hard time following who's who and what's what.""Gods and Generals"" is notable for being a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg."" I've not seen ""Gettysburg"" yet, and after seeing ""Gods and Generals,"" I'm not so sure I want to. Unless ""Gettysburg"" is an entirely different breed of film, it will be boring, dull, unmoving, and 100 % cheesy.In ""Gods and Generals,"" every line muttered by a character is some grand, psychological metaphor. Sometimes the quotes are true, such as when Robert E. Lee found out that General ""Stonewall"" Jackson had lost his left arm. ""He has lost his left arm, and I have lost my right."" But when Lee (Robert Duvall) says it in this film, it seems forced. Everything they say seems forced. As if they are reading off a cardboard slate off-screen. And every scene is at least ten minutes long, even the most non-important snore-fest scenes. In one scene, Jackson lies in bed with his wife and expresses his wishes to have a child. Well, he could easily say it and they could end the scene in two minutes flat. But by sticking to what I will call the ""Every Line Must Be Memorable and Be a Metaphor"" pact, which no doubt was formed before the film went into production, Jackson mutters on in fancy style for TEN minutes (yes, I checked my watch) about his desire to have a child. There are only so many words that can express the feeling of wanting a child. Jackson uses them all, and after that, uses a few more. No wonder it took so long for him to have a child - after that long speech, all his wives probably died of boredom.""Gods and Generals"" has good potential to be a sweeping epic, but it tries to hard to live up to something it can never be. Every scene is at least ten minutes. Ten minutes short for history buffs, and ten minutes long for a regular audience. Every line is smart yet forced. And as every minute went by, another person in the screening room left. I wish I had.Just for the record, in the course of exactly 3 hr. 40 minutes running time, the screening I participated in went from about twenty viewers to eight.

I think Jackson was offered the job to lead the Union by the President at the beginning of the movie, if I wasn't hallucinating, I never knew that part of history.Lots of Jacksonin the movie, as playing a God,or General etc. another annoying part of war. Not much of a movie you can make with war, many people die in close battle, oh what fun, but it gets better we can even see extremities blown off, oh what a good time. Maybe as a history film this works, for we see in this movie, Fredericksburg appears to be the end of the war for the confederates after they lost.

(Before Grant). The Confederate south hadn't suffered from the invasions of Sherman and Grant, and Sheridan hadn't burned out the Virginia Shenandoah Valley.  Lee was a hero and Jackson was the archangel Stonewall.  There was, too my mind, an almost surreal atmosphere surrounding the initial stages of this terrible conflict.  Picnics to the battlefields, war and glory, honor and all of the other attributes associated with this period.  Twenty First century thought would never look at war in such a positive light.  A few bad days of bloodlettings during the civil war probably changed the soldier's attitudes.  Not to mention the American's who personally experienced the horror and destruction.  Early in the Civil War the mindset was different and this film brings it out, piously.  I liked Turner's Gettysburg better. As is true to form with both these films the accuracy of the gear displayed great attention to detail, employing re-enactors for both Army's and civilian lent credibility to the historical representations.The dialog seemed a bit stiff and awkward at times.

755804,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00009OOFA,Joseph Haschka,"[25, 48]","A couple of years back, a spectacular war epic had the Japanese launching a sneak attack on a love triangle and PEARL HARBOR just happened to get caught in the collateral damage. In GODS AND GENERALS, several Civil War battles serve to interrupt the idyllic home life and prayers of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.There's a core of usefulness to this film, which is its reputedly and apparently accurate rendering - such as they are - of the battles of First Bull Run (1861), Fredericksburg (1862) and Chancellorsville (1863). For the historical knowledge to be gained, I would rather that today's young generation watch this than the steady diet of silly, albeit spectacular, fairy tales served up on the Silver Screen. Unfortunately, the combat footage is interspersed with too much overwritten and pretentious dialogue played to the tune of an overly melodramatic soundtrack. And since they're almost carnage-free compared to such recent war epics as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS, the battle sequences have been criticized as glossing over the horrors of war. But how else does the studio get the film a PG-13 rating that will allow younger audiences in to see it? To be sure, its 3 hour and 40 minute run time could have been slashed by an hour, at least. GODS AND GENERALS makes GETTYSBURG (1993) seem like a great film in comparison.Stephen Lang (General Pickett in GETTYSBURG) does a creditable job as the screenwriter's vision of Jackson, though I'm not convinced that this and the ""real"" Stonewall resemble each other. Unfortunately, much of the General's career and reputation was established by his brilliant Shenandoah Valley campaign of early 1862, events outside the scope of this epic. From reading, my impression of Jackson is that he was an austere, aloof, brilliant and eccentric commander who drove his men to the breaking point, and won their devotion in the process. The Jackson played by Lang comes across as almost warm and fuzzy. I don't know which version is more accurate, but this relatively pallid cinematic one isn't what I expected.Robert Duvall plays General Robert E. Lee in GODS AND GENERALS, and his rendition is much more robust and believable than Martin Sheen's in GETTYSBURG. Jeff Daniels, a little chunkier and nearly a decade older, pretty much reprises the Joshua Chamberlain character of the 20th Maine Regiment, although he occasionally falls victim to windy monologs about the sanctity of the Union and the evils of slavery. In GODS AND GENERALS, unfortunately, there's no Little Round Top to valiantly defend to the last minie ball. The best Chamberlain can do is get pinned down by Confederate fire below Marye's Heights at FredericksburgCivil war buffs such as myself will certainly enjoy this film while fidgeting between battles. First Bull Run comes across rather stiff and awkward, but the troops are fully into it by Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. It also helps if the viewer has some pre-knowledge of the battlefields and the locations of the opposing lines because there's too little elucidation provided by the on-screen tacticians. Those who've seen GETTYSBURG will recognize many of the actors who reprise their roles from the earlier sequel.See GODS AND GENERALS and appreciate it for what it's worth.

This movie contains explicit Bible reading. Scenes contain graphic depictions of prayer. The language may not be suitable for viewers offended by nonprofane references to Jesus. Viewers are strongly cautioned due to intense moralizing, violently affectionate marriages, and gratuitous displays of selfless behavior.""It's hard to portray piety well on-screen, and Hollywood these days scarcely ever tries to do so.

I had long imagined a film about Stonewall, and this is almost all I could have desired.I had envisioned Ed Harris in the role, as he bears a strong resemblance to Jackson, but I don't think Harris could have outdone Lang or even equalled him. If you doubt Lang's acting chops, just watch him play Pickett in ""Gettysburg."" What a contrast to Lang's Jackson! Each portrayal has a life of its own. Lang's performance outdoes even the great Robert Duvall, who here and there lets the hint of a ""Lonesome Dove"" mannerism slip into his portrayal of Lee.""Gods and Generals"" is especially welcome in that it contains none of the puerile nonsense that spoiled the recent would-be epics ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot."" Plodding it may be, but it should at least get credit for its maturity.Here's what I missed in ""Gods and Generals"" and hope to see in the 6-hour DVD when it is released next year:* Some sense of how Jackson and Lee earned their immense reputations, in the Valley campaign and at Second Manassas.* Some more attention to the Federal commanders, who were the tragicomic foils for Lee's and Jackson's brilliance. In the movie, that parade of bunglers and blowhards is represented only by Burnside. I understand the eventual 6-hour version will include Antietam, so we may meet McClellan there, but I want to see Pope and Hooker huff, puff and fall on their faces, too.* Speaking of bunglers and blowhards, a hard look at the secessionist firebrands who brought the war on might have mollified those critics who found the Southern cause way too idealized in this picture. Especially on the issue of slavery and race, a contrast could have been drawn between Jackson and someone like Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who prattled about the ""great moral truth"" of white superiority. The South's bigotry resided in its politicians, not in men like Jackson. (One critic doubted that Jackson would ever have called the free black cook he hired ""Mr. Lewis,"" as he does in the movie. But ""Tom Fool"" Jackson was known in pre-war Lexington for tipping his hat to black men on the street. Said he: ""I could not be less polite to a Negro than he is to me."")I look forward eagerly to seeing the conclusion of Mr. Maxwell's Civil War trilogy. In the role of U.S. Grant, the Union general who finally took Lee's measure, I'd suggest Russell Crowe. Like Grant, Crowe looks a bit surly, ""as if he had determined to drive his forehead through a brick wall and was about to do it.""And if Crowe isn't available, just call on Lang again.

It seemed the movie was more about him than the Civil War and I was very disappointed with how little screen time Robert Duvall got portraying Robert E. Lee which he did a fantastic job of. If you knew nothing of American History, you would never know there was such a thing as slavery watching this film except where Stonewall &quot;interviews&quot; a black man to be his personal chef. After watching this black man have midnight talks with Stonewall under a starring night, sit in on battle plan meetings with other generals, and march with the cadets at VMI at his funeral one would of thought that racial equality had reached a pinnacle during the civil war. The southern blacks were even actively helping the confederates. If any one was portrayed as racist it was the union sgt calling them &quot;darkies&quot;. Gettysburg on the other hand I came away knowing more about the Civil War than when I first started watching it.

However, Gods & Generals is certainly worthy of your time and attention.Like GETTYSBURG, GOD'S & GENERALS does a splendid job in character development. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson WAS a pious man. Based on some of the other reviews that I have read this fact annoys some. But this is a historical fact that would have been a true distortion of the truth if it were excluded for political correctness concerns. While many others like Duvall as R E Lee, I personally preferred Martin Sheen.Like GETTYSBURG, GOD'S & GENERALS does a superb job in keeping with the historicity with one notable deletion; and that is the absence of the battle of Antietam. This was ""America's Bloodiest Day"" and should have been included. I have read some reviewers whine and complain about the film's length -- all I have to say to them is to get over it and be grateful for an enjoyable educational experience.Unlike GETTYSBURG GOD'S & GENERALS does NOT offer an excellent sound track. I enjoyed the GETTYSBURG sound track so much I bought the CD.One last thing I would like to comment on. Ted Turner had no business putting him self in the movie. Ken Burns had a very brief moment in GETTYSBURG but at least he earned it with his fine work on the documentary on the Civil War.

Maybe the slavery issue is an over-exaggerated cause of the Civil War, but it was nonetheless a major question before and during the War that deserves far more attention in ""Gods and Generals"" than it actually got.  Don't expect to see any black slave being flogged in this movie because such a scene would shake up that indefatigable Southern pride which this film tries so hard to depict.  There is nothing wrong with a little patriotism and every nation has a right to self-determination, but glossing over an unjustifiable social evil such as slavery in this day and age?  What was Maxwell thinking?  You don't have to be politically correct to agree that the South had deprived itself of potential(and needed) French and British support by not keeping up with the times.  As a Canadian, I could tell you that Mother England and loyalist Canada at that time would have loved to see the United States divided in two and show that the American Revolution was a mistake.  (It was the survival of the American Union that prompted the Canadian colonies to form their own pro-British union in 1867.)Politics aside, this movie is simply downright slow and boring.  It seems like half the movie is essentially a biographical story of ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  As a military history buff, I admire ""Stonewall"" for his unique piety.  However, in this 21st Century age of minimal attention spans, do we really need to hear him speak out his ENTIRE pre-battle prayer?  Do we really need to hear him sing ""Silent Night"" in its ENTIRETY?Yet, the worse sin of all is the way this choppy movie mindlessly omits important episodes occurring between the firing at Fort Sumter and the start of Gettysburg.  WHERE IN GOD'S NAME IS THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM????  WHERE IS GENERAL McCLELLAN???  You would think that a movie lasting close to 4 hours could squeeze these important Civil War elements in somewhere, but instead a lot of screentime is wasted on scenes of Southern genteel domesticity (like ""Stonewall"" developing a father-like love for a little girl who admires the General) that are best described as ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.Watch ""Gettysburg"" for a good military focus on the Civil War, and watch ""North and South: Book Two"" for a good civilian focus.",2,"boring, disappointing, choppy, pro-South, etc., etc., etc.",1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,2478,"['Gettysburg', 'more', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'bit', 'pro-North', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'WAY', 'top', 'romanticizing', 'Southern', 'ideology', 'rather', 'coyish', 'treatment', 'slavery', 'Maybe', 'slavery', 'issue', 'over-exaggerated', 'cause', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'major', 'question', 'War', 'far', 'more', 'attention', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'actually', 'got', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'black', 'slave', 'being', 'flogged', 'movie', 'scene', 'would', 'shake', 'up', 'indefatigable', 'Southern', 'pride', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'depict', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'little', 'patriotism', 'nation', 'right', 'self-determination', 'glossing', 'over', 'unjustifiable', 'social', 'evil', 'such', 'slavery', 'day', 'age', 'What', 'was', 'Maxwell', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'agree', 'South', 'had', 'deprived', 'potential', 'needed', 'French', 'British', 'support', 'not', 'keeping', 'up', 'times', 'Canadian', 'could', 'tell', 'Mother', 'England', 'loyalist', 'Canada', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'United', 'States', 'divided', 'two', 'show', 'American', 'Revolution', 'was', 'mistake', 'was', 'survival', 'American', 'Union', 'prompted', 'Canadian', 'colonies', 'form', 'own', 'pro-British', 'union', '1867', 'Politics', 'aside', 'movie', 'simply', 'downright', 'slow', 'boring', 'movie', 'essentially', 'biographical', 'story', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'military', 'history', 'buff', 'admire', 'Stonewall', 'unique', 'piety', 'However', '21st', 'Century', 'age', 'minimal', 'attention', 'spans', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'hear', 'speak', 'out', 'ENTIRE', 'pre-battle', 'prayer', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'hear', 'sing', 'Silent', 'Night', 'ENTIRETY', 'worse', 'sin', 'way', 'choppy', 'movie', 'mindlessly', 'important', 'episodes', 'occurring', 'firing', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'start', 'Gettysburg', 'WHERE', 'IN', 'GOD', 'NAME', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'ANTIETAM', 'WHERE', 'IS', 'GENERAL', 'McCLELLAN', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'lasting', 'close', '4', 'hours', 'could', 'squeeze', 'important', 'Civil', 'War', 'elements', 'somewhere', 'instead', 'lot', 'screentime', 'wasted', 'scenes', 'Southern', 'genteel', 'domesticity', 'Stonewall', 'developing', 'father-like', 'love', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'General', 'are', 'best', 'described', 'ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.Watch', 'Gettysburg', 'good', 'military', 'focus', 'Civil', 'War', 'watch', 'North', 'South', 'Book', 'Two', 'good', 'civilian', 'focus']",N/A
755816,A3P98J5DZ00A75,B00009OOFA,"Ken Roberts ""social historian""","[15, 22]","As I have stated in previous reviews that I've written, I despise political correctness in every sense of the word. And when it comes to historical epic movies, I feel there is absolutely NO PLACE for political correctness. That being said, Gods and Generals is not only pretty much HISTORICALLY CORRECT but is totally engulfing to watch, from the southern 19th century language usage (including many original quotes from the period such as the last words spoken by General Jackson as he lay dying) to the way the characters interacted with each other to the war itself. The camera angles played a major role in the feel of this movie as well. The way the whole flick played out gave me the feeling that I was right there, in the company of the major players of that awful war.It was nice, also, to see a Civil War movie that spoke of the reasoning behind the war itself - states rights. Now, no president in his right mind, whether it be Lincoln or, if by some twist of fate, Jefferson Davis, would have allowed any states to secede. As much as I understand why those states wanted to secede, as president, I would have done whatever I could to prevent that from happening. Was the way Lincoln handled it correct? Well, hindsight is 20/20 and that discussion has been played out for over 140 years. We know the route Lincoln did take - right or wrong - to keep the union as one, and this Gods and Generals shows how the beginning of this situation played out, at least from the southern point of view. A little more of the northern perspective would have been nice. Oh well, maybe in the extended DVD version.Unfortunately, too many people take all of these Hollywood historical movies as fact, and, since that town is run by politically correct liberals who would rather change history to fit the way THEY feel it SHOULD have been, rather than the way it actually was, the majority of movie watchers usually do not get a good part of the truth. And that's a shame and a crime. Gods and Generals is the exception, which is a breath of fresh air. As Jeff Shaara, author of the original book this movie is based, stated in a recent interview (from the Gods and Generals magazine), ""Hollywood has a dismal record of portraying history. Historical films have one purpose - to make money - and it seems they have two means of realizing that. One, tell a story the studio thinks the audience wants to see, and thus tilt the story to whatever political correctness is in vogue. The second purpose is to allow one particular big time actor the chance to do 'cool things' on the screen. Though many of these films are entertaining, the one thing missing is any responsibility to give the audience the truth about the event being portrayed.""Do not let the length scare you off. From beginning to end, I was held to my seat, greatly anticipating the next scene when I saw it at the show. Matter of fact, I saw it twice in one weekend - once with my wife and once with my two eldest sons - and I'm ready to see it again!Gods and Generals, Gettysburg, and the third part to be released next year (whose name escapes me) should be required viewing for all history students in school history class.

General Jackson is often making speeches to encourage his soldiers to fight and he justifies it with Gods gospel as he believes that he is protecting his home from the Northern invaders. There are also other characters that occasionally give different views such as Lt. Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) who gives a speech about why the war is worth fighting for as well as General Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) who refused leading the Northern forces into his home state Virginia.The epic cinematic experience that Gods and Generals offers is profoundly affected by its script, speeches, acting, direction, music, and mise-en-scene. The characters seem as rigid as statues with hidden tape recorders that gives dry history lectures in the form of speeches. The only character that seems somewhat real is Robert Duvalls character, Robert E. Lee, as he seems to be alive. The distant shots of Fredericksburg are not convincing as they look miniature-like and the battle fields are bloodless, which evokes a false sense of heroism amidst the horror of war. Francis Ford Coppola could use Die Walk?re by Richard Wagner in Apocalypse Now, but is does not function with the same effect here as with grandeur music as the soldiers fall like domino bricks on both sides.

The beards look just horrible on all the stars.  The facial hair is fine on the extras in the film, but that is probably because it is real.The other problem is that the acting is so wooden.  The actors speak emotional lines, but show no emotion in doing so.  Are we to believe that all the high ranking officers were such boring people?  No, these were very colorful people.For an epic movie, the cinematography is bland.  It looks like a TV movie.With the bad make up, wooden acting and boring visuals, it is very difficult to get into this movie.  It starts out with many religious tinged monologs that are just not engaging.  If there were some fire put behind the sermons, this might be a great concept:  how the religious beliefs impact the military leaders.This is supposed to be a historically accurate film.  It is only historically accurate in terms of who the people are and what happened at the battles.  It is not accurate in what the social climate was at that time.  Not all slaves loved their masters.The battle scenes almost save this movie.  These scenes plus the scenes leading directly up to the battle are very intricate and make you feel like you are there.

755823,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B00009OOFA,"kone ""kone""","[97, 121]","This DVD is a faithful screen adaptation of the book ""Gods and Generals"", by Jeffrey Shaara.  It deals with the very beginnings of the American Civil War and progresses through the battle of Chancellorsville.  The book (and movie) are part of a three-part trilogy on the Civil War.  The movie is produced by Ted Turner, who makes a small cameo appearance as a southern soldier. This movie is a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg"".The movie (like the book) centers on the major generals of the war, Robert E. Lee (played to a ""tee"" by Robert Duvall), General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (excellently played by Stephan Lang), and the union's Lt. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (played by the very capable Jeff Daniels).  Of course, the leadership on each side believes in and prays to a God that they hope will deliver them victorious, thus the title ""Gods and Generals"".While the movie has sweeping visuals and equisitely accurate battle sceens, the movie is simply too long at nearly 4 hours in length.  Proper editing would have resulted in a more enjoyable film.  Too much time is allowed for elegant proseic speeches by the generals, generally to their wives.  The movie really bogs down in these sections and one is tempted to fast forward past them to the action that lies ahead.The actors do a remarkable job; all are believable and truly become the character(s) they portray.  The battle scenes are the film's strength and are an eye-opener for anyone not familiar with the bloody brutality of the Civil War, our nation's bloodiest conflict.  The courage of the soldiers facing an 800-yard march across an open field being pounded by cannon fire is something to behold.  The historical accuracy of the film is also a draw, as it teaches Civil War history.I believe the average viewer will tire of this movie due to its excessive length.  However, the Civil War buff will revel in the great detail and the effort to make the film historically accurate.  The film is appropriate for all but the youngest members of the family, as some of the killing is graphic.  I doubt that children will be able to watch the film to its conclusion, as they will lose interest in the non-battle scenes.With proper editing, this could have been a 4 or 5-star movie.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[5, 7]","When this particular movie was released in the theaters, I definitely wanted to see it, but who &quot;really&quot; wants to sit in a theater for four hours; hence the decision to wait until its much anticipated release on DVD.  Given several months anticipation, I'm glad to say that I wasn't &quot;thoroughly&quot; disappointed, but slightly put aback by the &quot;dry&quot; nature of this film.  Dramatically, this film just doesn't put forth a great effort.Historically, I'm sure this film is a real boon to Civil War buffs and I'm quite sure, every historian that relishes in this era probably rather enjoyed the authenticity of this film.  I, myself, enjoyed the authenticity of this film, between over seven thousand re-enactors and the production crews efforts to put forth as accurate a film as possible, they accomplished that goal with flying colors.  In the filmmakers efforts to keep the rating of the film down to a PG-13, they more or less sold out on the &quot;authenticity&quot; of the horrible type of combat that was engaged in during this era, which when comparing other films, most notably those starring Mel Gibson, somewhat lessens the experience.Performance wise, all of the actors and re-enactors performed quite admirably.  Of special note is the exceptional performance by Stephen Lang as General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson.  Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels both perform to their high standards in their respective roles in this film.Director Ronald F. Maxwell set out to recreate three of the civil war's most pivotal battles in Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  All three of which were, as I understand it, seamlessly recreated for the purpose of this film, bringing to it an authenticity that few other films have accomplished.  High praise goes to Ronald Maxwell for his efforts here.  Unfortunately, this film will most likely not go down in history as one of the best or the most successful, but it will most likely go down in history as one the most &quot;required&quot; films for students of this era.The soundtrack for the film is truly &quot;dead on&quot; for the events as they're being depicted; credit to those involved in this particular aspect of the film.The premise:Based on Jeffrey M. Shaara's bestseller, &quot;Gods and Generals,&quot; this film takes on the role of depicting, in part, the story of select individuals during some of the events leading up to the beginning of the civil war and for a couple years thereafter.  The film primarily focuses on southern generals, General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, General Robert E. Lee and northern Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain.  In a way, the director portrays an almost &quot;clinical&quot; look at these characters and the events.  From General Jackson's devout religious beliefs to Lieutenant Colonel Chamberlain's initial doubts, the authenticity of the plot and the portrayal abound.I would definitely recommend this film, not as a dramatic success but as a historical success of a film, that given fours hours to watch, can be an enlightening experience, as I learned several things about these historic figures.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Introduction by Ted Turner- Feature-Length Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Ronald F.

Bernabo,"[10, 25]","The events in ""Gods and Generals"" take place before those in ""Gettysburg,"" but this first film in the Shaara Civil War trilogy was made ten years after the 1993 epic.  Consequently it is a bit discordant for the audience to see some actors a decade older playing younger versions of the same characters, while other familiar characters have new actors in the roles, and one original actor is not playing a different role.Some of the flaws of ""Gods and Generals"" are inherent to not only the film but the Jeff Shaara novel as well.  Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The Killer Angels"" told the story of the Battle of Gettysburg from the perspective of a handful of key historical figures.  It was as much a psychological profile of John Buford, Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain as it was a historical account of the battle (as the latter the film had major gaps, reducing the events of the second day to the pivotal assault on Little Round Top).  ""Gods and Generals"" does not cover four days but rather a period of over two years, during which it focuses on three major battles: (First) Manassas, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.The film might begin with Robert E. Lee's decision not to accept command of the Federal armies, but the main character is clearly Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, especially since the film ends with his death.  The high point of ""Gods and Generals"" becomes the Battle of Fredericksburg, mainly because it is the only one of the three battles that is explained to the lay audience (I know about what Jackson did at First Manassas and at Chancellorsville, but the average audience member is not going to have a clue).  In that battle, it is the charge of the Union Irish Brigade from New York, going up against a Confederate unit of their fellow Irishmen entrenched behind the stonewall, that provides the most emotional moment in the film.  But this appex comes before the intermission.Yes, there is an intermission, which surprised several audience members at the first showing yesterday; jaws dropped when I informed them this movie was 3 hours and 49 minutes long.  My complaint is not that the film is that long, but rather that the film only rarely engages the audience over that long period of time.Writer-director Ronald Maxwell has made a big effort to make ""Gods and Generals"" different from ""Gettysburg.""  The effective opening of the latter, where the actors morph into the historic figures they play, and the afterward update of what happened to these characters (lifted from the novel), are both gone.  The psychological dimension of hearing the character's thoughts are omitted (except for the ironic echoes of earlier words).  In ""Gettysburg"" the use of music was superb, and has turned up in dozens of trailers as well as the broadcast coverage of the Olympics.  But in ""Gods and Generals"" the music of Randy Edelman and John Frizzell constantly overwhelms the images and gives us not a sense of heroism but rather one of sacred sacrifice (the angelic voices are overdone as well).  The exception that proves the rule are the almost cameo like appearances of many of the characters/actors from ""Gettysburg"" (Oh, look, there is Ted Turner again).  When we have different actors playing Generals Armistead and Pickett having a conversation foreshadowing Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, it was just way too forced.Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors of his generation and he certainly looks the part of Robert E. Lee, but there is too much of a twinkle in his eye and a slight smile upon his lips to read true for me.  Stephen Lang has the major role as Jackson, who is reduced to the paradox of a devout religious man whose solution to the Northern invasion is to kill all of them.  Jeff Daniels is the principle actor from the previous film to return, but then he is playing Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Civil War hero who was effectively rediscovered by the Shaara novels and the Ken Burns PBS documentary.  Even given the literary impulses of the age, it did seem over the top when Chamberlain launches into a lengthy quotation of a Latin poet historian regarding Caesar crossing the Rubicon as the 20th Maine prepares to be the third assault on Marye's Heights overlooking Fredericksburg.  But then Chamberlain spends the next two nights huddled behind a barricade of Union corpses, and the irony between the beginning and the ending of the charge certain captures the death of the illusion of war's grandeur.""Gods and Generals"" succeeds when Maxwell is choreographing his battle sequences, even if we rarely provided with a clear understanding of what is happening in terms of strategy and tactics.  Where it fails is in making the characters and the issues of the day seem real, the way they did in ""Gettysburg.""  The slavery issue is treated in such a fashion, with Jackson having a conversation on God's will with his black cook (Frankie Faison) and the loyalty of a slave woman (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who still years for freedom, that is just not believable.  ""Gettysburg"" casts an imposing shadow over ""Gods and Generals,"" and those who have watch the films in chronological order in terms of history rather than production will undoubtedly enjoy the overall experience more because those of us who admired the other film are constantly taken out of ""Gods and Generals"" by noting that Buster Kilrain (Kevin Conway), Tom Chamberlain (C. Thomas Howell), General Kemper (Royce D. Applegate) and several others have virtually nothing to do in this film.The bottom line lesson here is that if you thought making a successful sequel was nearly impossible, the odds are stacked even more against making a great prequel.",3,"Overall, a disappoint prequel to the story of ""Gettysburg""",1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,5721,"['events', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'take', 'place', 'Gettysburg',

It is neither about the Civil War in its entirety (not even getting to the pivotal 1862 battle of Antietam, let alone the far better known Gettysburg), nor is about Southern politics - spending little time exploring the politics of the antebellum South.  Although Duvall, as Robert E. Lee (Duvall is a distant relative of General Lee) figures into the story (as he surely must), Lee is not really even the central character in this story.What ""Gods and Generals""  is about is Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson and the first three major battles in Virginia.  This was an era when the Union army was still poorly commanded and making major, almost comical (if they hadn't been so costly in human life) errors on the battle field - errors they eventually corrected.  Although I am not usually a Ted Turner fan, my hat is off to him for helping to bank-roll the telling of this story.This movie is (probably) less for the casual movie-goer, and much more for the student of 19th century American history.  Expect to be entertained, as ""Gods and Generals"" is a good movie with the usual cast of thousands in the battle scenes and street scenes from Fredericksburg (actually shot in the real village of Harpers Ferry, which has a lively Civil War history in its own right), but also expect to be educated.

The acting is overall excellent, it was nice to see a lot of actors in minor parts recreate their roles from Gettysburg, and Robert Duvall and Kali Rocha (as Stonewall Jackson's wife) are especially good. The battle scenes are exciting and painstakingly recreated, and the photography is gorgeous.This is one of the few films that try to show a balanced view of the war, and especially the South, not an easy task in these PC times.

755831,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B00009OOFA,L. E. Cantrell,"[23, 32]","First, a little personal background.  My ancestors in Tennessee and Texas were Unreconstructed Confederates to the core.When the Civil War aka the ""War Between the States"" aka the ""War of Northern Aggression"" aka the ""War of the Rebellion"" was won and lost, the hopes and dreams of the Southron States (as they would soon take to calling themselves) were toppled and smashed flat.  Many ex-Confederates began to rethink their past and to redefine themselves.  Leading the parade of redefiners was no less a personage than ex-President Jefferson Davis.  Not far behind him on the military side was Jubal Early, a cantankerous, unlucky general who had managed to set off the Battle of Gettysburg by accident, just missed capturing Washington, D.C. [""Early was too late,"" chortled Sherman to Grant], and had the boom lowered on him--hard!--by Phil Sheridan.  Davis, Early and a host of others collectively created what has come to be known as the ""Lost Cause.""Included among the many tenets of the Lost Cause is the notion that the South was a natural country, a freedom-loving nation driven reluctantly to take up arms by the rapacious greed of coarse, indifferent Northerners.  And, oh yes, a nation in which slavery played only a limited part among a narrow segment of the population, but which, nevertheless, conferred social and economic benefits for all.The Lost Cause was, of course, unmitigated baloney.  And it still is.Slavery was the evil core of the Confederacy.  Don't take my word for it.  Read the pre-war speeches of southerners extolling its God-ordained virtues.The economic impact of slavery was overwhelming.  Consider just the cost of giving up slavery: a typical male slave in good physical condition had a market price of about $1200 dollars in 1861.  That was an enormous sum, far greater than the annual income of a free working man in the agrarian South.  Multiply that amount by the number of slaves and understand why the South was reluctant to release a major portion of its population from servitude.  The Lost Cause to the contrary, financial greed and rapacity were not the exclusive property of the Damyankees.This movie is very much a piece of Lost Cause thinking.  Like many of the advocates of the Lost Cause, it uses half-truths to tell great whopping lies.  The most egregious of these half-truths involve the slaves portrayed on the screen.  Offhand, I can't recall coming across Stonewall Jackson's cook in Douglas Southall Freeman's magisterial, three-volume history ""Lee's Lieutenants,"" but I am willing to accept that there was such an individual much as portrayed in the film.  I am further willing to accept that at Fredericksburg and elsewhere were, as portrayed on screen, house slaves who displayed great loyalty to the persons and property of their owners.  But I am NOT willing to accept the movie's refusal to acknowledge that first thousands and then tens of thousands of slaves flocked to the Union army encampments.The blue coated soldiers were initially at a loss to know what to do with them.  A few believed that they were still property and returned them to their owners, sometimes by force.  General Fremont declared them to be free and earned a blistering retort from Lincoln which forced him to rescind his premature Emancipation Proclamation.  At last a bright spark of a Yankee decided that the inflowing slaves were contraband of war and therefore subject to confiscation from owners who were in rebellion against the lawful government of the United States.  ""Contrabands"" they became--and their efforts contributed greatly to the Union cause.Another half-true lie is the scene in which that singularly admirable man of peace and war, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, contemplates the forthcoming Battle of Fredericksburg.  He is shown quoting a classical passage on the return of Julius Caesar and his legions to the stream forming the boundary between Italy and his designated command area in Gaul.  By crossing that otherwise insignificant stream, Caesar placed himself at war with the legitimate power of the Senate and People of Rome.  He set on the path to seizing unlimited and tyrannical personal power.  The placement and set-up of this scene clearly implies that Chamberlain identified his army on the verge of crossing the Rapahannock River with that of Caesar's crossing the Rubicon, and that this crossing into Southron land was the beginning of a tyrannical seizure of power.Now, Chamberlain, among many other things, was a college professor and far more learned in the classics than most of us today.  He might have even have made just such a quotation.  If he did, it is irrelevant.  First, the Union had already occupied territory in Virginia and had done so from the first day of the war, so the Army of the Potomac crossing that particular river had no significance for tyranny or otherwise.  Second, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had just three months before invaded the North (and had paid a bloody price at the Battle of Antietam aka Sharpsburg.)  And third, to Yankee minds if anyone had crossed a Rubicon in willful defiance of his country and its laws, it was Confederate General Beauregard when he fired on Fort Sumter.This is a film made up of several strands.  ""The Life of Saint Stonewall"" is such a strand, one closely related to the Lost Cause.  The nearest thing to a central figure in the film is Thomas Jonathan Jackson, whose life is loosely followed from the time he was a major in the US Army to the day he died as Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson, commander of the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, slain by ""friendly fire"" after his set-piece triumph at Chancellorsville.  Jackson is by any measure extraordinary, a man as much out of the normal course of humanity as George S. Patton (whose ancestor and namesake, by the way, died commanding the 22d Virginia under General Jubal Early).A biopic of Jackson might have been something to see, but this is not it.  Here, Jackson is made much less than he really was.  Like most of his contemporaries who grew up on the classics and devoured the works of Charles Dickens, Jackson was given to what seem to us to be pompous statements about duty combined with excessive sentimentality where children were concerned.  The movie gives us plenty of that--too much, in fact--but it shortchanges us on Jackson the man who kept his secrets, Jackson the man who waged ferocious feuds with other generals and, most of all, Jackson the man of war.  It entirely ignores Jackson in independent command in the Shenandoah Valley, carrying out one of the most brilliant campaigns in all of military history.  It is blind to Jackson at Second Bull Run, playing the anvil upon which the Army of Northern Virginia hammered poor, befuddled John Pope in Robert E. Lee's most perfect battle.Finally, there are the battle scenes offered up by re-enactors in the thousands.  Specifically, we are shown a portion of the battlefield at the First Battle of Bull Run (aka Manassas) in 1861, Fredericksburg in 1862 and Chancellorsville in 1863.  These are the core of the movie.  The volunteer re-enactors devote vast quantities of time, money and discomfort to accuracy.  The producers virtually crow over the perfection of their images.And I don't buy them for a second.Bull Run was a complex series of encounters between two newly-raised and largely untrained armies.  It most certainly was not won by Jackson's brigade making a single frontal assault.Fredericksburg was a three-phase battle that began with the building of a bridge while under heavy fire, a skirmish in the town and then the great, tragic assault on Lee's impregnable position.  It is the third phase that is unique.  A union brigade would march up the heights, be shot to pieces and another brigade would pass over the survivors to be shot to pieces in turn, again and again ... and yet again.  The stupendous bravery of the affair was matched only by the unbelievable stupidity of it.  In the movie we see the first Union brigade attack and fall, a second attack in parade ground order and a suggested third.  There were many, many more than that.  The unspeakable futility of this most futile of battles is hardly suggested.At Chancellorsville, Jackson moved his corps swiftly and silently over mere country tracks to get to the unprotected flank of the much larger Union army.  Jackson's men were famous and tireless marchers but even they realized that their feat was something extraordinary.  They emerged out of the trees and routed the 11th Corps of the US Army--to the endless shame of that particularly luckless outfit.  The movie shows Jackson's corps begin its move and then it tells us they've arrived.  The grueling march that is the very essence of the battle is barely suggested.Then the movie, in true pageant form, shows Confederate soldiers, hidden within the tree line, standing silently to attention in their extended line of battle, waiting for Jackson's order to attack.  Well, I for one do not believe that any Confederate soldier anywhere ever stood silently at attention while waiting for the order the move out, especially not exhausted, foot-weary ones.  And if I did believe that, I flat out do not believe--based on the universal testimony of the Confederates themselves--that any Confederate attack was ever made in straight and closely aligned lines of battle.  And even if I believed THAT, I still wouldn't believe that Jackson and his whole staff would ride twenty yards behind his skirmishers and in front of his main battle lines through the whole depth of the enemy position.Finally, those re-enactors.  They are too healthy.  Too well-fed.  Look at the contemporary photographs.  By 1863, the Army of Northern Virginia was a fantastically skillful military machine composed of rail-thin, mad-eyed scarecrows--in no way resembling those good ol' boys on the screen.""Gods and Generals"" is undramatic, misleading and ultimately unconvincing.

Although I am not a Civil War buff, I did appreciate its portryal of the human side of this internal war that tore apart this nation.  The other reveiwers commented on the absence of the battles of Antietam, etc and they have a valid point, but I believe this film had a greater idea in mind.  The humanizing protrayal of Southern legends such as ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  Let's face it.  When was the last time a film or documnetary about the Civil war portrayed a Confederate such as Jackson being intimate with his wife or holding his newborn child? Just like films about Americans in World War II, we are almost always portrayed as the ""good guy.""  The Nazis are always evil.  Same for the Civil War, the Confederates are always out back whipping their slaves.  One can quibble with the portayal of Fredericksburg by the use of Harpers Ferry, W VA., but the events that took place there are what matter.  Jeff Daniels continues to perform in an outstanding manner as Joshua Chmaberlain (and George Washington but that's another film).  I doubt few quibbled about the intimate scenes of Chamberlian and his wife, unlike Jackson. Let's face it.  Any portrayal of the Civil War is bound to upset one side or the other.  It is just such a topic.

Although I am a Civil War fanatic, I found the movie to be totally boring. It was an effort to stay awake. I thought the movie should have been titled ""Stonewall Jackson"" or something like that since most of the movie centered around this general. Stephen Lang who played Jackson, however, proves to be quite [inadequate]. Whether this was due to cutting room floor or the script, I am not sure but historically, Jackson was one of the most bizzare and eccentric characters of the war. This made him very controversial but there is none of this in the movie. Lang's protaryal of Jackson almost make him very normal and that was one thing Jackson never was. The film was definitely pro-south in outlook but there is nothing wrong with that. However, the speeches made in this film does make the southerners sound very pompous. Civilian scenes proves to be a total waste of time because they are cut-scenes with two diminsional characters with little or no depth. These scenes add to the boredom to the film. It was nice for the director to put in couple of black characters in the movie, if you like your black characters to be ""Uncle Tom"" type. The combat scenes was pretty limited. Only three battles were shown in the movie, First Manasas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Of the three, Fredericksburg was the showcase battle of the movie - and this was the most boring of Civil War battles. One of the battle scenes of Fredericksburg involves the role of the Irish, where the southern Irish were condeming the northern Irish. Funny that northern Irish serving in Union armies outnumbered the southern Irish in Confederate armies by what -- 7-1 or 6-1 during the war. Actually it was the southern Irish who were out of line with mainstream Irishmen in Civil War. (Beside, why should these southern Irish be shock? After all, Irish Brigade of the Army of Potomac played an important parts in other battles prior to Fredericksburg and found fame because of it. Not to say that while there were few Irish regiments in the south, there were several Irish brigades in the north!...) The other two battles were only touch lightly and centered around Jackson's role. Northern view point in this movie proves to be rather limited. So limited that it would be better if it wasn't presented at all. Jeff Daniels definitely looked older and fatter then his slim tirm fighting mode of ten years ago. Northern dialogue sound so much somber and reflective compared to the southern speeches although the film could have done without Daniels' Caesar speech. It took three and half hours to do justice to three days of Gettysburg. The same time cannot do justice to two years of the Civil War. This effort only cheapen the story and the characters. Worst, putting in the dull civilian scenes slow the movie down considerably and add nothing in return. This is the worst kind of history movies, a kind of movie that put a superifical light and pretend to convey what it cannot deliever.

Whether the last name is Earnhardt or Roosevelt or Bush or Shaara, sons have often found it hard to follow the footsteps of famous fathers when they pursue the same career. The comment on most of his books was ""well-researched, accurate, pretty dull compared to dad's original."" The same comparison could be made between the first movie made from the son's book and ""Gettysburg,"" the one made from dad's.The original suffered from a few too many ""stirring"" (i.e., painfully long and dull) speeches by Chamberlain, Armistead, Lee, and others. But its saving grace was that fabulous story -- plus some excellent acting.When ""Gods and Generals"" was being filmed, much was made about the painstaking efforts to maintain historical authenticity -- the accuracy of the uniforms and equipment, the approvals from all the historians and re-enactor groups, etc. It certainly is respectful of the history. Well, maybe a little too much ""Lost Cause"" nonsense, but that's a story for another day ...Unfortunately, they forgot to make an interesting movie. It's just dull. In some ways, it reminds me of those outdoor-drama historical pageants like ""Lost Colony"" and ""Trumpet in the Land"" and the ""Passion Play,"" where the cast of thousands takes turns standing around and staring as one actor after another delivers a long, windy monologue.Some of the reviewers who like the movie say the critics just can't stand the fact that the movie portrays Confederates with respect. That problem is utterly irrelevant. The producers of ""Gettysburg"" treated the Confederate leaders and cause with just as much respect and nobody complained.

755842,A3AN0NXHARI55Q,B00009OOFA,Magic Lemur,"[2, 2]","In spite of the prayerful pretensions of this film, I rather enjoyed it.From the title, you might expect a gritty war epic in the style ofRomeorThe Lord of the Ringsbut in its place you will get one of those lovey-dovey nicey-nicey American epics where every rough edge (e.g. battle violence, coarse language etc) is smoothed out.Fortunately for this film it isn't too corny and the excellent battle scenes more than offset the piety of General 'Stonewall' Jackson (who actually comes across more as 'Sugarlump' Jackson).I also found, as a Brit, that this film was an excellent education in the American Civil war. Whereas Wikipedia or books on the subject have a tendency to make battles seem dry and boring, this film fully encapsulates the First Battle of the Bull Run, the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Chancellorville, all the while enabling you to see why the Southern generals were seen as so gifted.That said, you can't get away from the impression that producer Ted Turner (who does the commentary) makes up for his bleak news reports (""by 1990, we will all be dead from Aids"") by making historical movies that are the polar opposite. Though the battles and action are convincing, the dialogue and characters can come over a little too saccharine and pious when really, as other reviewers have commented, 'Stonewall' Jackson was far more gritty than he is portrayed. In a way, you wish that Turner had included a little bit more of his realism in the film, so that the characters were a little bit more 3D.While on the films faults, I'd also criticize the films extras, which had very little extra information on the battles portrayed in the film. Yes - there is an exploration of 'Stonewall' Jackson, but it would have also been good to see more information on the actual history and what the battles were (the names of the battles are not mentioned in the film, and such knowledge is rather assumed).Anyways, aside from this the film is well worth watching and is essential viewing if you want to understand the third Anglo-Saxon civil war (the first and second being the English Civil War and the American War of independence respectively).One last thing to point out is that it is possibly a little long at 220 minutes or 3 hours 40 minutes (the type of film that is split over two DVD's).

'Glory' is probably about as good as I've seen, and it has plenty of flaws. Most of the efforts I've seen don't even attempt to portray participants as they really were--there's too much emotional and historical baggage to do that, so most of them do what Gods and Generals does in spades: make them all insuffereable windbags, who don't hold conversations, but only deliver overly precious sounding speeches. Add in the fact that many film makers on the subject have an agenda, which is also evident in this movie in spades, and you generally get extremely tiresome results (as in this movie....).This is as uninteresting and unenlightening movie on an historical subject as you're likely to ever see. You'll see the famous generals brought to the screen, speechifyin', and, in general, acting nothing like real human beings, and especially not like the human beings on which the characters are based. You'll see battle scenes which match any battle scenes ever filmed for boredom. You'll learn next to nothing about why the battles actually occurred, if you didn't already know.It is interesting, I must admit, to read some of the reviews here. It seems as if the bulk of the positive reviewers are praising the movie because of its glorified depiction of the southern cause rather than any of its film elements. Not really surprising. It's basically indefensible as a piece of entertainment. All that's left to praise is the agenda the film is pushing. Over 200 years after the events, and many still play historical revisionist.

After I saw G&amp;G, I wandered around yelling &quot;Where are the #*%$&amp;# bayonets?&quot; disconcerting my wife, my daughter and both my dogs. Though the same creative team made both films, G&amp;G sorely lacks the center around which Gettysburg revolved, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin, whose above-mentioned order saved the Union. To be fair, Thomas J. Jackson is a worthwhile character to explore, but the portayal of Southerners as God fearing Protestants in the best Martha Stuart tradition, and Northerners as Pagan-quoting bespattered vulgarians aggravated me no end.True, Jackson was a religious man, true he was a near psychopath in battle, and true, the 19th century had a deeper tolerance of such flamboyant characters than the 20th or 21 century does, but to make him into a perfect Saint is to deny the truth; he and his cause were based on human chattel slavery. The relationship Jackson has with his cook is dubious at best, harmfully untrue at worst, and does little to show the actual conditions of slavery.  In fact, only the house slaves (I would use the correct term, but I hate the word) are visible. The Christmas scene after Fredricksberg made me gag; I thought I was watching &quot;A Southern Living Christmas.&quot;  Jackson comports with a five year old child, preaching Christianity and vowing to &quot;Kill them all.&quot;  I don't doubt that's all true, but somehow his death is elevated to a religous transcendance - choirs and big music - I felt like I was watching history written by the Republican National Committee.Steven Lang, for what it's worth, is hypnotic as the saint of the Confederacy, and I even liked Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee more than Martin Sheen, but most of the actors here were simply too old to play their roles.If I'm going to invest four hours of my life, I would like at least to be treated like an adult, and this film plays like an over enthusiatic small-town football coach of really good intentions got hold of fifty million dollars and went wild. (This is no slam on small-town football coaches.)Spare me. The Ante-Bellum South, while pretty if you were White and Rich, was a bad cause to fight for. Northern factories weren't pretty either, but to claim that all the killing at Bull Run, Fredricksberg and Chancherivlle was to defend the South from banks and factories is a lie, a bad lie, and bad history.

755849,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00009OOFA,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 2]","""Gods and Generals"" boasts most of the same creative team that teamed to make the spell-binding ""Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)"". Ronald Maxwell again directs, this time from the book by Jeff Shaara.  Jeff is the son of Michael Shaara, who wrote ""The Killer Angels"", the Pulitzer-Prize winning book that served as the source for ""Gettysburg"".Many familiar faces appear again in roles from the earlier film.  Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell and Kevin Conway again appear as Joshua and Thomas Chamberlain and the fictional Buster Kilrain.  Daniels and Conway again team to produce a few of the best scenes of this film, both of them articulating in a way most characters are not allowed. There are significant cast changes.  Martin Sheen was heavily involved in ""The West Wing"" and was unable to reprise General Robert E. Lee.  Lee is portrayed this time by Sheen's colleague from ""Apocalypse Now"", Robert Duvall.  Normally I would think that casting of Duvall would be an upgrade from almost any other available actor, but comparing the two versions of the legendary Commander of the Army of Virginia, I found Sheen's depiction elegant and serenely regal, with a temper that can be unleashed (as when Sheen's Lee tears into J.E.B. Stuart for not keeping his cavalry close as Gettysburg unfolds) and a human compassion perhaps best exemplified when the ragged rebel troops retreat from Pickett's disastrous charge and Lee rides out to tell the troops ""it was my fault.""  Duvall's Lee is quirkier and seems oddly detached in comparison.Tom Berenger is no longer on hand to portray General Longstreet.  Early in ""Gettysburg"" you can sense the dutiful resignation as he unsuccessfully tries to persuade Robert E. Lee to force the Union Army into pursuit by moving toward Washington, then later you can feel his heartsickness as he knows Pickett's Charge is bound to fail and wordlessly waives his troops forward to the suicidal advance.  Bruce Boxleitner's Longstreet is decidedly less three-dimensional.The excellent Stephen Lang again is cast, but instead of playing the flamboyant Pickett, this time he has a leading role as General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.The film is huge in scope, covering two years from the secession of Virginia (which is preceded by the offer to Robert E. Lee to command the Federal Army) to Chancellorsville.  As a historically accurate document it is selective:  the single bloodiest battle of American history, Antietam, is not mentioned (although there are reports that it was cut from a six hour version of the movie.  Curious that the full ""director's cut"" doesn't make it to the DVD - the audience that would sit through 4 hours of re-enactment would likely want the chance to have the ""most accurate"" version of the film.) But I digress.Where Gettysburg focused on the soldiers, ""G&G;"" gives us a handful of stilted subplots.  We see the wives of Chamberlain and Jackson in scenes designed to show the tender, human sides of these men, but their dialogue doesn't ring true on modern ears.  Since these scenes aren't based on historical record couldn't Maxwell and Shaara have given us more human dialogue instead of having these great men offering scripture and poetry quotations?Amid the noble and heroic whites on both sides are two significant black characters - Frankie Faison plays Jim Lewis, a free black man with a reputation as a good cook who is hired by Stonewall Jackson.  Donzaleigh Abernathy, the daughter of Civil Rights Activist Ralph Abernathy, plays Martha, a noble and loyal slave who stays at the manse in Fredericksburg to shoo away invading Union Troops when the rest of the family skedaddles.  Later the house is occupied anyway and Martha nurses injured union soldiers and gives an impassioned plea for freedom to General Hancock. General Jackson is kind and respectful toward Mr. Lewis, and tells him that he's certain the south would also free the slaves, so it's going to happen on way or `tuther. Although Jackson and Robert E. Lee were reported to be against slavery, it would not be difficult to say that having these two characters be the only blacks in a movie of this scope and scale trivializes the fact that millions of blacks were enslaved, scant few were free, and hardly any were treated with the respect these characters receive.  It's almost as if Maxwell wants to portray something 180 degrees from ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", but if you didn't already know about slavery you wouldn't learn much from this film.  I think the filmmakers wanted a movie that would stand almost as a historical document, but whether or not you agree that the Civil War was about slavery, you'd be nave to not acknowledge that it was on the minds of all participants to some extent or `tuther.For those who might wonder: I'm a white Son of the Glorious South.  There are wonderful things in this film, but there are significant gaps as well.",3,"A Prequel to ""Gettysburg"" with a Disjointed Narrative",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,4888,"['Gods', 'Generals',

755851,A24ULXZJ5I8O9V,B00009OOFA,"Mark ""marklees""","[10, 17]","I find it ironic that this movie (along with Gettysburg) is so meticulous in regards to getting the uniforms, the settings, the flags, and the weapons &quot;just right&quot;-- but fails to understand the true nature of the Civil War. The Civil War was a bloody, gruesome affair that in all fairness could never really be captured on film. Men did simply fall down when they were shot; they were blown to pieces and they tended to writhe in agony on the battle field for hours. Men starved, were ravaged by disease, and had inadequate clothing. &quot;Boys&quot; fought along side men. This film over-romanticizes and over-dramaticizes this conflict of conflicts to the point of disparaging its legacy. This is a movie for the &quot;reinactors&quot; who are more concerned with buttons and hats then they are with understanding what the civil war was really like.Let me go into a few specifics: First, the soldiers in this film are laughable. Since when were so many civil war soldiers overweight men in their 50s and 60s? How did they keep their uniforms so clean? Jeff Daniels is such a pathetic Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Chamberlain was one of the great heroes of the North and to have a stiff, awkward Daniels, who is probably about 15 years older than Chamberlain was, is an insult to Chamberlain's memory. Second, the constant background music is so annoying. It just serves to heighten the phoniness of this movie. Third, this film tries to convey the broad scope of battle, but only succeeds in creating a confusing mess. Furthermore, the greatness of Lee, Jackson, and Chamberlain are not even conveyed. Chancellorsville was considered Lee's greatest victory, but if you watch this movie without knowing that, you might still be wondering who won it! The same can be said for Jackson. Without knowing Jackson's background and what he exactly did, the uninformed viewer might leave the film wondering &quot;why was this guy so great-- other than being a good Christian?&quot;The Battle of the Crater in Cold Mountain conveys more realism and authenticity in 20 minutes than Gods and Generals does in 3.5 hours. Gods and Generals was ambitious, which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one; however, it's just too bad that this ambition came from individuals who don't know anything about the Civil War (except maybe for what kind of buttons an officer in the 5th Wisconsin might wear).",2,A Romanticist's View of the Civil War,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,2395,"['find', 'ironic', 'movie', 'Gettysburg', 'so', 'meticulous', 'regards', 'getting', 'uniforms', 'settings', 'flags', 'weapons', 'quot', 'just', 'right', 'quot', 'understand', 'true', 'nature', 'Civil', 'War', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'bloody', 'gruesome', 'affair', 'fairness', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'captured', 'film', 'Men', 'did', 'simply', 'fall', 'down', 'when', 'were', 'shot', 'were', 'blown', 'pieces', 'tended', 'writhe', 'agony', 'battle', 'field', 'hours', 'Men', 'starved', 'were', 'ravaged', 'disease', 'had', 'inadequate', 'clothing', 'quot', 'Boys', 'quot', 'fought', 'side', 'men', 'film', 'over-romanticizes', 'over-dramaticizes', 'conflict', 'conflicts', 'point', 'disparaging', 'legacy', 'movie', 'quot', 'reinactors', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'buttons', 'hats', 'then', 'are', 'understanding', 'what', 'civil', 'war', 'was', 'really', 'like.Let', 'go', 'few', 'specifics', 'First', 'soldiers', 'film', 'are', 'laughable', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'civil', 'war', 'soldiers', 'overweight', 'men', '50s', '60s', 'How', 'did', 'keep', 'uniforms', 'clean', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'such', 'pathetic', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'Chamberlain', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'heroes', 'North', 'have', 'stiff', 'awkward', 'Daniels', 'who', 'probably', '15', 'years', 'older', 'Chamberlain', 'was', 'insult', 'Chamberlain', 'memory', 'Second', 'constant', 'background', 'music', 'so', 'annoying', 'just', 'heighten', 'phoniness', 'movie', 'Third', 'film', 'convey', 'broad', 'scope', 'battle', 'only', 'creating', 'confusing', 'mess', 'Furthermore', 'greatness', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'Chamberlain', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'conveyed', 'Chancellorsville', 'was', 'considered', 'Lee', 'greatest', 'victory', 'watch', 'movie', 'knowing', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'wondering', 'who', 'won', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Jackson', 'knowing', 'Jackson', 'background', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', 'uninformed', 'viewer', 'might', 'leave', 'film', 'wondering', 'quot', 'why', 'was', 'guy', 'so', 'great', 'other', 'being', 'good', 'Christian', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Crater', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'conveys', 'more', 'realism', 'authenticity', '20', 'minutes', 'Gods', 'Generals', '3.5', 'hours', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'was', 'ambitious', 'why', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'however', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'ambition', 'came', 'individuals', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Civil', 'War', 'maybe', 'what', 'kind', 'buttons', 'officer', '5th', 'Wisconsin', 'might', 'wear']",N/A

Here one area that the film is taking hits.They say that the diologe is way to long.  That is so not true.The way the people in the film talk is very accurate.  Americans in the 1860's spoke very different than we do.  They were more into reading than we are today.  Even poor people spoke better, they mostly read the bible.  There were less books back than there are today and people then were better educated. Americans today cannot understand that this is how people spoke. People even spoke well when they were praying with each other.  Their is a scene in the film between Jackson and his wife praying.  The spoke by praying, and this was very acuratetly prortrayed in the film.  That was not over done at all.  Don't listen to those air head critics.  They do not know what they are talking about.

755859,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B00009OOFA,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[0, 1]","History buffs, no doubt, will love this film. I am not meaning that armchair variety which enjoys its history in leather-bound illustrated volumes accompanied by a nice cup of tea, but those arguably insane fanatics who re-enact every footstep and skirmish of the Civil War forces and seem to enjoy camping in dripping tents on soggy ground, reminiscing of better days.I think this film would have worked better as a mini-series for television, seeing as TV viewers seem more willing to put up with a very, very long film if it's split up into segments (witness the behemoth, North and South). As it is (9 minutes shy of four hours) not even the DVD format can save one from inevitable yawning.However, this aside, it is an interesting summary (that hardly seems the right word) of Stonewall Jackson's career. The film is somewhat flowery (the principal characters, of which there are many, all speak in dialogue that resembles a combination of history textbooks and Byronic style) and rather glosses over the hideous injustices of the war (all of the slaves shown, of which there are few, seem very much to love their masters, something which doesn't strike me as realistic) but the battles are portrayed in vivid, painstakingly precise detail - even down to the labelling onscreen of the participating parties. (Perhaps the re-enactors at work here?)It focuses more on the South's perspective, as seen through General Stonewall Jackson's point of view (the film could very nearly be a biopic of his career), but the scenes with Colonel Chamberlain of Maine and his brother are touching in their familiarity and sincerity. I wish they had included more of this; Chamberlain as portrayed by Jeff Daniels in ""Gettysburg"" (1993) was my favourite character and he is not given enough room to work here.Robert Duvall is properly crusty as Robert E. Lee, a better choice in resemblance (and, surprisingly, performance) than Martin Sheen was in ""Gettysburg."" He is not onscreen often but his scenes are well-acted.All-in-all, this film is nice for history buffs with an afternoon to kill, but not one to watch repeatedly. Much more enjoyable and superior to its ""prequel"" is the 1993 ""Gettysburg"", which features much of the same cast but is better balanced on the whole.~Reviewed by Megan Stoner",3,Historically accurate but overlong,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2290,"['History', 'buffs', 'doubt', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'meaning', 'armchair', 'variety', 'history', 'leather-bound', 'illustrated', 'volumes', 'accompanied', 'nice', 'cup', 'tea', 'arguably', 'insane', 'fanatics', 'who', 're-enact', 'footstep', 'skirmish', 'Civil', 'War', 'forces', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'camping', 'dripping', 'tents', 'soggy', 'ground', 'reminiscing', 'better', 'days.I', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'mini-series', 'television', 'seeing', 'TV', 'viewers', 'seem', 'more', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'film', 'split', 'up', 'segments', 'behemoth', 'North', 'South', '9', 'minutes', 'shy', 'four', 'hours', 'not', 'even', 'DVD', 'format', 'can', 'save', 'one', 'inevitable', 'yawning.However', 'aside', 'interesting', 'summary', 'hardly', 'right', 'word', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'career', 'film', 'somewhat', 'flowery', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'speak', 'dialogue', 'combination', 'history', 'textbooks', 'Byronic', 'style', 'rather', 'glosses', 'hideous', 'injustices', 'war', 'slaves', 'shown', 'are', 'few', 'seem', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'masters', 'something', ""n't"", 'strike', 'realistic', 'battles', 'are', 'portrayed', 'vivid', 'painstakingly', 'precise', 'detail', 'even', 'labelling', 'onscreen', 'participating', 'parties', 'Perhaps', 're-enactors', 'work', 'here', 'more', 'South', 'perspective', 'seen', 'General', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'could', 'very', 'nearly', 'be', 'biopic', 'career', 'scenes', 'Colonel', 'Chamberlain', 'Maine', 'brother', 'are', 'touching', 'familiarity', 'sincerity', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'more', 'Chamberlain', 'portrayed', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Gettysburg', '1993', 'was', 'favourite', 'character', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'room', 'work', 'here.Robert', 'Duvall', 'properly', 'crusty', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'better', 'choice', 'resemblance', 'surprisingly', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'Gettysburg', 'not', 'onscreen', 'often', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-acted.All-in-all', 'film', 'nice', 'history', 'buffs', 'afternoon', 'kill', 'not', 'one', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'Much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'superior', 'prequel', '1993', 'Gettysburg', 'much', 'same', 'cast', 'better', 'balanced', 'whole.~Reviewed', 'Megan', 'Stoner']",N/A
755860,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,B00009OOFA,Mercy Bell,"[21, 25]","I saw this movie at the Premiere in DC, and I was blown away by it.  The critics saw the flaws in the film, I saw them too, but it all worked together for me. I was impressed that someone actually pulled off making an epic, and the aesthetic beauty of the film, and the genuine warmth, heart, and soul it had, something many a movie lacks these days.Quick rundown of flaws: Some of the history is un-researched (but what can you expect from Hollywood?), especially concerning the costumes. But, despite complaints, the dialogue is correct (yep, those speeches were how they talked. Just go to your local college's library and pull out a war-time newspaper chock full of ""going away speeches"". Oy),a nd it would have been a shame to revert to monosylables. The script is untidy, but one must keep in mind that this film was originally cut from a 6 hour version, still Maxwell could have done much better with the screenplay. The women in the film were rather awkward and unecessary, though, unlike many, I liked the feminine touch. Some scenes seem to come out of nowhere and lead into nothing, and the movie moves quickly, jumpng over huge portions of time. The movie doesn't follow the book closely at all, choosing to make this the ""Stonewall Jackson Movie"", which can be an ambiguous (either negative or positive) choice, depending on the viewer. Thus, a great many of the beloved characters and scenes from the book are out.But on top of all it's flaws, the film has charisma and heart, and does work, at least for me, despite what many of it's critics think. It doesn't feel cliched; rather, it feels fresh. The battle scenes, though lacking in gore, are extremely well choreographed and awe-inspiring. The score is amazing, and there's one song, ""Going Home"" which plays at the beginning, which is downright Oscar worthy. Stephen Lang brings in a true tour-de-force theatrical performance (he was, after all nominated for a Tony Award for A Few Good Men), in the legacy of many a great character actor. Mr. Lang doesn't have the most startling resemblance of Ol' Stonewall, but his sheer presence convinces you that he is. Jeff Daniels and a plethora of supporting actors deserve kudos for fine performances as well.The film doesn't lack in poignant moments and, in it's own way, drives home the horror of war in scenes too numerous to count. Unlike many war films these days, this film is quiet. It makes you think, makes you pay attention. In many ways it reminds me of classical plays performed for the stage, or even Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (though it shares the same thoughtful, intellectual pace and graceful, natural visuals, it moves much more swiftly than dear Barry does).This is a different film, to be sure. Don't be turned off by counting it's flaws. It has a deep, profound undercurrent that makes up for those. It can alternately wring genuine tears from or inspire it's viewers, without the use of cheap cinematic manipulation; this is a slow cooked film. This is a fine film about our national tragedy, not the best, but certainly fine, respectful, thoughtful, sorrowful, and indeed, stirring.",5,"A quiet, classically styled tragedy",1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,3123,"['saw', 'movie', 'Premiere', 'DC', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'critics', 'saw', 'flaws', 'film', 'saw', 'too', 'worked', 'together', 'was', 'impressed', 'someone', 'actually', 'pulled', 'off', 'making', 'epic', 'aesthetic', 'beauty', 'film', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'heart', 'soul', 'had', 'something', 'many', 'movie', 'days.Quick', 'rundown', 'flaws', 'history', 'un-researched', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'especially', 'concerning', 'costumes', 'complaints', 'dialogue', 'correct', 'yep', 'speeches', 'were', 'how', 'talked', 'Just', 'go', 'local', 'college', 'library', 'pull', 'out', 'war-time', 'newspaper', 'chock', 'full', 'going', 'away', 'speeches', 'Oy', 'nd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'revert', 'monosylables', 'script', 'untidy', 'one', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'cut', '6', 'hour', 'version', 'still', 'Maxwell', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'screenplay', 'women', 'film', 'were', 'rather', 'awkward', 'unecessary', 'though', 'many', 'liked', 'feminine', 'touch', 'scenes', 'seem', 'come', 'nowhere', 'lead', 'nothing', 'movie', 'quickly', 'jumpng', 'huge', 'portions', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'closely', 'choosing', 'make', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Movie', 'can', 'be', 'ambiguous', 'negative', 'positive', 'choice', 'depending', 'viewer', 'Thus', 'great', 'many', 'beloved', 'characters', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'out.But', 'top', 'flaws', 'film', 'charisma', 'heart', 'work', 'least', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'think', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cliched', 'rather', 'fresh', 'battle', 'scenes', 'lacking', 'gore', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'choreographed', 'awe-inspiring', 'score', 'amazing', 'one', 'song', 'Going', 'Home', 'beginning', 'downright', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'true', 'tour-de-force', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'Tony', 'Award', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'legacy', 'many', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'Mr.', 'Lang', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'Ol', 'Stonewall', 'sheer', 'presence', 'convinces', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'plethora', 'supporting', 'actors', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'fine', 'performances', 'well.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'lack', 'poignant', 'moments', 'own', 'way', 'home', 'horror', 'war', 'scenes', 'too', 'numerous', 'count', 'many', 'war', 'films', 'days', 'film', 'quiet', 'think', 'pay', 'attention', 'many', 'ways', 'classical', 'plays', 'performed', 'stage', 'even', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'shares', 'same', 'thoughtful', 'intellectual', 'pace', 'graceful', 'natural', 'visuals', 'much', 'more', 'swiftly', 'dear', 'Barry', '.This', 'different', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'counting', 'flaws', 'deep', 'profound', 'undercurrent', 'up', 'can', 'alternately', 'wring', 'genuine', 'tears', 'inspire', 'viewers', 'use', 'cheap', 'cinematic', 'manipulation', 'slow', 'cooked', 'film', 'fine', 'film', 'national', 'tragedy', 'not', 'best', 'certainly', 'fine', 'respectful', 'thoughtful', 'sorrowful', 'indeed', 'stirring']",N/A

Out of the two, Gs&Gs; is far better. (Sort of like comparing apples and turnips, I know: but ""Firefly"" has spoiled me: I can hardly stand the sight of rubber-masked aliens anymore.)I agree with those who have said Gs&Gs; is a good movie; not great but good. It greatly simplifed the book, and I agree that some added battle material and a little less *preachy* dialogue would have been a wise move.But what we have is a very good depiction of the feelings (especially the Confederate view) of the participants at the time. It wasn't some Hollywood (politically correct) rewrite of history. The war really did start over Lincoln's refusal to allow secession, and the slave issue only came to the front well into the war. Feelings over slavery on both sides were anything but cut and dried.The religious characters of Stonewall, et al, are perfectly in line with reality (though I admit this aspect might be slightly exaggerated at the expense of other character *quirks*).And I think the battle scenes are horrific enough. This is not an antiwar movie so we did not need greater realism (like with ""Saving Private Ryan""): it is a story about understanding the attitudes, views and feelings of the nation, through the medium of the main historical characters (the book brings this out very well), and I think the movie succeeds adequately in this.""Gettysburg"" has been a favorite movie for years.

Good God almighty. . .This is a great film if you're Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell, being that a good third of its running time consists of insufferably pious Southerners rolling their eyes toward Heaven and droning scripture. But in all fairness, the secular speeches are every bit as bloated and boring, as personified by Jeff Daniels' leaden rendering of a particularly thrilling slice of Roman history. The depiction of the fanatical, maniacal Stonewall Jackson--the Confederacy's equivalent to John Brown-- as the Very Soul of Christian Benevolence was grimly laughable. (One of my favorite reviews of the film depicts him as a cross between a Pentacostal preacher and a member of ZZ Top). The film's depictions of slaves makes GONE WITH THE WIND look positively enlightened. There wasn't a shred--not one iota--of humor in this four-hour film, the only thing even resembling a chuckle coming from a Union grunt's offer to trade General Burnside for a lame horse. The acting was straight out of community theater, the screenplay like something Norma Desmond would have written. And where in bloody hell was the film editor?Perhaps the most unforgivable of Maxwell's transgressions came in the battle scenes. As majestic and sweeping as the battle scenes in GETTYSBURG were, that is how flat and static they are in GODS AND GENERALS. And to completely skip over--to not even MENTION--the battle of Antietam is simply unfathomable. (Yes, I know, it'll be in the director's cut. Oh boy, I can't wait.)As horrible as I found this film, I'm looking forward to the third part of Maxwell's Civil war trilogy.

He died before Gods and Generals could come out.I just recently got around to seeing it on DVD.I wish they had a section of deleted Scenes. No sence good editing getting rid of good scenes that are not good enough to keep to keep the air time down.I wish the commentary had been longer and included the North rather than restrict itself to Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. In peticular I wish it had covered teh scene of Winfield Scott Hancock confronting Burnside. Burnside is one of the more fascinating officers of the conflict though not among its better generals. He did not want for courage. He did not want for innovative ability. He designed and built one of the war's better breachloaders. The uniform he designed for his Rhoad Island volunteers was certainly better suited to the southern summers than the regular one issued to most Northern troops. Long before the Marines he created the natian's first amphibous assault corps. Unfortunately he did lack flexability and a capacity for follow up. His business manufacturing his carbine went bust for his lack of advertisement. His amphipeous corps spent most of its use as a regular formation. Fredericksberg speaks for  itself.I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it had not centered around the south in the beginning. Northerners were just as intense. Just as Southerners were mobilizing for war so were Northerners who were just as mad as they. We have to remember this fight had been thirty years or so in the brewing.  Now that northern interests were taking over the Federal government which the southern elite now understood they could never recover, the south was trying to cut out so to preserve their  power in the area of the nation where they were strong. The North wasn't going to let them get away. Indeed, we don't see the North in its actions until Chamberlain makes his appearence.Other than these flaws which a later DVD can correct I very much enjoyed this movie.

755869,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00009OOFA,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 4]","The era of the Civil War, a time of great conflict in our nation, has been of great interest to many who study the history of the United States. The Civil War was the bloodiest conflict on American soil for many years and the last great war to be fought in our own country. As southern states quickly succeeded from the Union, young men of the north were asked to help fight the rebels who wanted to rip this great nation apart. The North fought for preservation of the Union while the South fought for state rights and the preservation of slavery. The war was hard on everybody as brother fought against brother, sons against their fathers, families against families. No war had ever divided a nation so greatly as this one. The film Gettysburg, original planned for television viewing only until it was decided to be released into theaters, gave a glorious view into possibly the greatest and most well known battle of the Civil War. Though the film was not a box office success, it was glorified for its artistic merit. Can the prequel Gods and Generals do the same or will the lengthy film be killed in action?The story follows the early days of the Civil War all the way up to right before the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Much of the focus of the film follows T.J. Jackson, who is commander of the Virginia division for the Confederate army, but the film also follows around General Robert E. Lee, who is in charge of the Army of Northern Virginia, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who is an officer in charge of the 20th Main division of the Union. Several battle are shown within the course of the film including the Battle of 1st Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The story for Gods and Generals is well done but there is some disappointment. There was a feeling that the film spent too much time involved in the small stories and speeches then on the battles that actually occurred within the early days of the Civil War. The fact that the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest battle in the Civil War, was not included in the film was of huge disappointment. There was also too much confusion trying to keep track of so many personal stories that it became too much within the course of the four hour film.It is hard to focus on just one performance with a film such as Gods and Generals but maybe it is best to focus more on the lead characters then anything else. Possibly the best role within the film was performed by Stephen Lang, who portrayed Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Lang gave a stirring performance as ""Old Blue Eyes"" showing the great difference of Jackson's actions on and off the battlefield. Jackson's death at the end of the film should bring many historians to tears for being so dramatic. Another fabulous portrayal was of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain performed by Jeff Daniels, who was in the film Gettysburg as well. It was kind of disappointing that he is not seen at the end of the film to transition into the film Gettysburg but not a huge flaw. Robert Duvall takes over for Martin Sheen as Robert Edward Lee in the prequel to the famous film. Duvall has the look down as well as some famous lines from the Confederate general but Lee is not seen much within the film which is quite disappointing as the ads make it seem like he is the main focus. There are too many small performances to make huge note of but they are brilliantly performed by this great cast.Overall, Gods and Generals is a good film on the Civil War but not a spectacular one. With success in many areas comes some failures. The time length was too much at a stunning four hours but the intermission was well placed. Some conflicts involving the Southern view of slavery and blacks in the army argues against historic records. The focus of the film also seemed to be too Southern biased as much focus was placed with the Union as much as the South. The biggest disappointment was exclusion of the Battle of Antietam, which Jackson was a part of. Though there were errors, the film wasn't all disappointing. Civil War buffs will be proud to hear lines like ""He may have lost his left arm but I lost my right"" from Lee or Jackson saying, ""Let us rest under the shade of the trees"" right before he dies. Another great surprise was the inclusion of songs like ""Dixie"" and ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" though the film could have included some Northern songs as well. The original song ""Going Home"", which can be heard in the opening of the film, was masterfully well done. Gods and Generals does what it was set out to do which was to give an epic portrayal of the early days of the Civil War. Though some may be disappointed with the toned down versions of famous battles, they will be happy to see that history can be brought to life in such splendor.",3,The Moose Hole - Ground of Some

Stephen Lang did a great job as Stonewall Jackson and Robert Duvall was excellent as Robert E. Lee.  The film was outstanding because of the story, the actors, and the emotions the film causes.  Special effects were only fair and overall the film did not have the same quality feel as ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Yet, this film was as good or better than that one because it excelled so well in the areas mentioned above.This is more of a ""thinking person's"" film.  Those with short attention spans or those needing graphic carnage will probably not like this film at all.  But for those who pay attention, this film is very rewarding.  It provides a glimpse into the minds of those making decisions in the 1860's.  The battle scenes, while only being average for combat sequences, bring much more in other ways; the Irish vs. Irish battle scene being one moving example.  The portrayal of Robert E. Lee by Robert Duval is probably the best depiction of Lee in movie history (far better than Martin Sheens effort in Gettysburg).I highly recommend this film, but I will warn that those who can't appreciate a great story without having MTV-style action will be disappointed.",5,One of the Great Civil War films,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,1271,"['outstanding', 'film', 'would', 'rate', 'Glory', 'being', 'best', 'Civil', 'War', 'films', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'was', 'excellent', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'film', 'was', 'outstanding', 'story', 'actors', 'emotions', 'film', 'causes', 'Special', 'effects', 'were', 'only', 'fair', 'overall', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'quality', 'feel', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'one', 'excelled', 'so', 'well', 'areas', 'mentioned', 'above.This', 'more', 'thinking', 'person', 'film', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'needing', 'graphic', 'carnage', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'film', 'who', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'very', 'rewarding', 'glimpse', 'minds', 'making', 'decisions', '1860', 'battle', 'scenes', 'only', 'being', 'average', 'combat', 'sequences', 'bring', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'ways', 'Irish', 'vs.', 'Irish', 'battle', 'scene', 'being', 'one', 'moving', 'example', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'probably', 'best', 'depiction', 'Lee', 'movie', 'history', 'far', 'better', 'Martin', 'Sheens', 'effort', 'Gettysburg', '.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'warn', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'great', 'story', 'having', 'MTV-style', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

This time we go back to the tumultuous opening days of the conflict.  The action spans three separate engagements - Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Bull Run- from all of which the confederate forces under General Robert E- Lee emerge triumphant. Robert Duvall fills Martin Sheen's shoes as Robert E. Lee for this movie and is, I feel, better cast. Facial hair enthusiasts will also have a field day- more strange moustaches and beards than you can wave a stick at - with Tom Berenger winning the Most Ridiculous Beard in a Civil War Movie award hands-down (with Jeff Daniels's handlebar moustache in the first Gettysburg movie coming in a close second) . The movie focuses on General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, with Stephen Lang putting in a strong, moving performance as the legendary soldier (killed by complications following a bullet wound inflicted by friendly fire fact fans). I find myself at odds with many of the reviewers below who have dismissed Gods and Generals totally.

The music, for instance, is superb - defintely a notch up from the synthy washes we had to endure in Gettysburg. But it is, exactly like Gettysburg a beautifully made, lovingly crafted Civil War movie that is highly educational too boot.

I love the novel and thought this would be of equal quality; it was not. The movie suffers from a blatant southern bias which is not surprising since Ted Turner paid for the thing. The biggest problem is the dialogue is terrible to the point of hilarity. They act like everyone who lived in 1861 talked like they were in a Shakespearean play. Stonewall Jackson was a religious zealot but I doubt every stinking word out of his mouth was a bible verse; this movie makes you think that is all they talked about. If you come into this movie with no idea of the Civil War good luck following any of the characters outside of Jackson or maybe Lee. One of the greatest characters from the war (Chamberlain) was left under-developed and poorly executed in this film.

755876,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,B00009OOFA,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[2, 3]","Gods and Generals is a film for Civil War buffs abroad, it is not--I repeat--it is not a typical film that if you expect plenty of action and melodrama you will be greatly mistaken.  This is a film that was intended to tell the story of the Civil War, at least some parts of it.  As much as I think Gettysburg was more put together and flowed so much easier, Gods and Generals is still a fine work of art if you look at it with a fair mind.This film created much controversy because it viewed the South as something different than ""slave whipping white men who were evil.""  They were viewed as humans, with purposes and reasons to going to war besides keeping slavery.  Southerns fought for their way of life, whether you think that's right or wrong is beside the point, the movie had a right in portraying its characters as such.  Southerners lived differently than the North.  They had a different economy with a different form of thought over what America is and was.  In their minds, America was a nation made up of many nations or states that were to be free to make up their own minds.  But the North viewed America as one country and it was to be controlled by a central government composed of represenatives from every state.  So you can say the war was over States Rights not slavery.Now, talking about slavery, some folks here seem to think that this is what the film should've been about.  Some throw hissy fits in their reviews because Jackson prays with a black man?  So where is it written that every southerner was a racist and wouldn't be caught dead talking to a black man less praying with him?  Don't generalize, it's very unbecoming when I read your reviews.  Keep an open mind, please.  And yes, blacks in the south--initially--were for the confederacy.  Why you ask?  Because they didn't care much for Yankees either.  The South was their home too, and they viewed the North as invaders not liberators.  Historical fact: slaves knew not a different life different from their own.  Another historical fact: slaves did not always hate their white masters but revered them at times as patrons and leaders.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not promoting slavery or making excuses for the South's way of life, but I do want to make it clear that blacks were not always mistreated and not always resentful of their white brethern.Now, there have been some quote ""civil war buffs"" who claim that Jackson is painted out to be some ""Christ like character.""  I honestly have no idea what they mean.  Jackson was a very religious man, often considered a fanatic, that's all opinion.  He was ruthless on the battle field, his losses were high, so some have called him a ""killer"" as one reviewer called him.  Another opinion, take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers wanted the film to show Jackson as a mad man and not as a man who's maybe a little extreme when it comes to the battlefield.  I'm sorry, I have a hard time taking the word of a reviewer who takes an extreme view of Jackson and expects me to swallow it.  I never knew the man, we only know of what historians tell us and what his biography displays, and from what I understand this movie does that well.My one complaint about this film is balance.  It does come across that this is a film told primarily from the Southern point of view.  This sucks because we don't really understand much of the North's reasons to go to war and we don't get the equal balance of strategy before each battle.  Like Chancellorsville: how come Jackson's corp was able to ambush Hooker's right flank?  What was Hooker thinking?  We don't know, because he's never given the opportunity.  I think there is a little too much Thomas Jackson in this film, to be fair, and it goes a bit overboard with his personal life.  Lee and Chamberlain, the other main characters are brief in their roles because Jackson hogs the entire movie.  This was a mistake, I believe, and it created some bore.  But it isn't that bad to demote a star.The flow of the film is a bit choppy, jumping from Manassas to Fredricksburg to Chancellorsville.  They did leave some battles out in between, but because of time restraints, I understand why.  But again, if they trimmed some of Jackson's over abundance of personal life time to military strategy and battle sequences, I think the film would've surpassed Gettysburg.In summary, Gods and Generals is a historical film.  It teaches you quite a bit about that period, it gives the viewer an opportunity to see the southern view point for once and does enlighten you on some of the battles.  It's worth seeing if you like historical films.  But if you go into it with a narrow mind, as other reviewers here have done, you'll end up being bitter.Grade: A-",5,For Civil War appreciators,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,4736,"['Gods', 'Generals', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'abroad', 'not', 'repeat', 'not', 'typical', 'film', 'expect', 'plenty', 'action', 'melodrama', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'mistaken', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'tell', 'story', 'Civil', 'War', 'least', 'parts', 'As', 'much', 'think', 'Gettysburg', 'was', 'more', 'put', 'together', 'flowed', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'still', 'fine', 'work', 'art', 'look', 'fair', 'mind.This', 'film', 'created', 'much', 'controversy', 'viewed', 'South', 'something', 'different', 'slave', 'whipping', 'white', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'evil', 'were', 'viewed', 'humans', 'purposes', 'reasons', 'going', 'war', 'keeping', 'slavery', 'Southerns', 'fought', 'way', 'life', 'think', 'right', 'wrong', 'point', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'portraying', 'characters', 'such', 'Southerners', 'lived', 'differently', 'North', 'had', 'different', 'economy', 'different', 'form', 'thought', 'what', 'America', 'was', 'minds', 'America', 'was', 'nation', 'made', 'up', 'many', 'nations', 'states', 'were', 'be', 'free', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'North', 'viewed', 'America', 'one', 'country', 'was', 'be', 'controlled', 'central', 'government', 'composed', 'represenatives', 'state', 'can', 'say', 'war', 'was', 'States', 'Rights', 'not', 'slavery.Now', 'talking', 'slavery', 'folks', 'here', 'seem', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'throw', 'hissy', 'fits', 'reviews', 'Jackson', 'black', 'man', 'So', 'where', 'written', 'southerner', 'was', 'racist', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'talking', 'black', 'man', 'less', 'praying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'generalize', 'very', 'unbecoming', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'Keep', 'open', 'mind', 'please', 'yes', 'blacks', 'south', 'initially', 'were', 'confederacy', 'Why', 'ask', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'South', 'was', 'home', 'too', 'viewed', 'North', 'invaders', 'not', 'liberators', 'Historical', 'fact', 'slaves', 'knew', 'not', 'different', 'life', 'different', 'own', 'historical', 'fact', 'slaves', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'hate', 'white', 'masters', 'revered', 'times', 'patrons', 'leaders', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'promoting', 'slavery', 'making', 'excuses', 'South', 'way', 'life', 'do', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'blacks', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'mistreated', 'not', 'always', 'resentful', 'white', 'brethern.Now', 'have', 'been', 'quote', 'civil', 'war', 'buffs', 'who', 'claim', 'Jackson', 'painted', 'out', 'be', 'Christ', 'character', 'honestly', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'mean', 'Jackson', 'was', 'very', 'religious', 'man', 'often', 'considered', 'fanatic', 'opinion', 'was', 'ruthless', 'battle', 'field', 'losses', 'were', 'high', 'so', 'have', 'called', 'killer', 'one', 'reviewer', 'called', 'opinion', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'suppose', 'reviewers', 'wanted', 'film', 'show', 'Jackson', 'mad', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'maybe', 'little', 'extreme', 'when', 'battlefield', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'word', 'reviewer', 'who', 'extreme', 'view', 'Jackson', 'swallow', 'never', 'knew', 'man', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'tell', 'what', 'biography', 'displays', 'what', 'understand', 'movie', 'well.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'balance', 'come', 'film', 'told', 'primarily', 'Southern', 'point', 'view', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'much', 'North', 'reasons', 'go', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'equal', 'balance', 'strategy', 'battle', 'Chancellorsville', 'how', 'come', 'Jackson', 'corp', 'was', 'able', 'ambush', 'Hooker', 'right', 'flank', 'What', 'was', 'Hooker', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'never', 'given', 'opportunity', 'think', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Thomas', 'Jackson', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'bit', 'overboard', 'personal', 'life', 'Lee', 'Chamberlain', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'brief', 'roles', 'Jackson', 'hogs', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'mistake', 'believe', 'created', 'bore', ""n't"", 'that', 'bad', 'demote', 'star.The', 'flow', 'film', 'bit', 'choppy', 'jumping', 'Manassas', 'Fredricksburg', 'Chancellorsville', 'did', 'leave', 'battles', 'out', 'time', 'restraints', 'understand', 'why', 'again', 'trimmed', 'Jackson', 'abundance', 'personal', 'life', 'time', 'military', 'strategy', 'battle', 'sequences', 'think', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'surpassed', 'Gettysburg.In', 'summary', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'historical', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'period', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'see', 'southern', 'view', 'point', 'once', 'enlighten', 'battles', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'historical', 'films', 'go', 'narrow', 'mind', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'done', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'bitter.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

I live in Louisiana, and have always been perplexed by how southern people still use the words &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; to describe this national tragedy.  Furthermore, there is a wierd mythology surrouding the participants of our countries biggest bloodbath.  General Lee and General Grant have always been canonized as American Heroes, and their battles have been endlessly romanticized.All of this hullabaloo is perhaps to gloss over the fact that this war involved pointless mass death.  Had the war been avoided, our country would be largely the same today.  But millions would not have been slaughtered.Gods and Generals is rife with this same romanticism, and doesn't do the war justice.  When a movie about America's bloodiest war earns a PG-13 rating, you know you are in trouble.  Given how this film bombed at the box office, its doubtful that an &quot;R&quot; rating could have made things financially worse.  Most people who will flock to see this kind of thing are  college graduates anyway, so what gives?The soliloquies in this film are agonizing.  The battle scenes look like a civil war re-enactment, with no blood or even broken skin.

755879,A2EWC48FRNO3YP,B00009OOFA,"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99""","[4, 8]","In Ted Turner's ""Gods and Generals,"" Confederate general Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson is an impeccably noble Southern Cavalier who loves his wife and little children, and in turn is loved by his soldiers and black servants. Unlike Turner's last Civil War epic, ""Gettysburg,"" which attempted some semblance of balance, ""Gods and Generals"" is the most unabashedly pro-Southern Civil War epic since ""Gone with the Wind,&quot; or even ""Birth of a Nation.""  Southern commanders (and for that matter, nearly every Southern character in this exasperatingly long-winded movie) are portrayed as Bible-quoting speech mongers .  The Southern blacks are, every one of them, loyal to their masters.This is not history, but a misguided crusade to canonize Jackson and the ""Lost Cause,"" which manages to both bore and offend.  As a Civil War buff, and having appreciated Turner's willingness to stick to the script of Shaara's wonderful book ""Killer Angels"" in the movie ""Gettysburg,&quot; I was willing to give ""Gods and Generals"" a try.  But by the time the Disneyland minstrel show arrives to sing the ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" to Lee, Jackson and assembled officers including the grinning Ted Turner, it was hard to fight the urge to smash the DVD player.  A heathy dose of Rhett Butler's cynicism from ""Gone With The Wind"" was badly needed here.  Without it, we are subjected to sonorous lectures about ""protecting the Southern way of life"", which never mention the dreaded ""s"" word - slavery.Sorry to say, ""Gods and Generals"" is a mediocre film and a poor biopic.  ""Stonewall"" Jackson was not a saint, but a brilliant general (mostly) whose religious fanaticism, notable even by 1861 standards, and disregard for the lives of his soldiers, were legendary.  Most historians agree that he was respected by his ""foot cavalry"" for his victories but not loved.  He was a ruthless, cold-blooded killer and had no compulsion regarding executing deserters.  His students at V.M.I. thought he was a weirdo.  Unlike ""Patton,"" we don't get a feel for Jackson's well-documented faults.The film is doubly-bad history because it doesn't even explain why Jackson was considered the South's best general.  This elephantine movie leaps from First Bull Run to Fredericksburg in late 1862, skipping over Jackson's classic Shanandoah Valley campaign, and his heroic defensive efforts at Antetiam and Second Bull Run.  If just one of these battles had been substituted for the endless speeches or languid scenes of Jackson cuddling with his wife, we'd having something to measure Stephen Lang's Jackson with. Needless to say, Jackson's lethargic performance in the Seven Days' battles outside Richmond in 1862 (where is McClellan in this movie?) are not mentioned.  The film only hints at his chronic petty warfare with other Southern commanders such as A.P. Hill.  Jackson's surprise attack at Chancellorsville is well-presented, but when Jackson is accidently shot by his own troops, the movie goes AWOL and instead devotes itself, accompanied by soaring heavenly choirs, to the slow death of the Christ-like Jackson.What saves ""Gods and Generals"" from a single-star is Robert Duvall, as General Robert E. Lee, and the choreographed battle of Fredericksburg, which should have been the movie's sole object.  Duvall's Lee, with a twinkle in the corner of his eyes, is superior to the zombie-like performance of Martin Sheen in &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; and hints at the complexity and worldliness of the real Lee.  Better yet is the Fredericksburg battle itself, which captures the indescribable bravery and terror of Union troops senselessly marched up and knocked down the shallow hills where Lee's troops blasted cannon and rifles from behind stone walls.  The experience of the surviving Union soldiers (including Jeff Daniels' Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine regiment) left exposed overnight on the chilly slopes before the Confederate lines is heartrending, as is the emotional confrontation between Union and Confederate Irish brigades facing each other across the stone wall. Turner's use of Civil War reenactors and attention to detail such as uniforms is to be commended, especially in the early scenes where Confederate troops are depicted wearing everything from Union blue to brown, red and white.For die-hard Civil War buffs, I recommend skipping the hours of pious Southern ""if the Lord wills"" pontificating and head directly for the Fredericksburg scenes and the first day of Chancellorsville.

The question Gods and Generals asks is, does your own culture, despite all of its defects and sins (both past and present), merit preservation and loyalty -are you willing to fight to keep it?This is what makes the Civil War so important, beyond the issue of slavery. It is a contest between an agrarian, religious, aristocratic culture, and a city dwelling, industrialist, secular one. None of this is to obscure the issue of slavery, but, if you are going to say that the confederacy was illegitimate because of slavery, then what world culture, in it's roots, is legitimate? Is it worth asking whether slavery (as an unnatural institution and with the advance of new technology, etc.) would not have soon died out on its own, without the massive blood shed and destruction the interference of the north caused, and perhaps with a lot less of the undeniable racial acrimony that the Reconstruction era caused, extending even into the present day?Gods and Generals is the only movie which even hints at asking these (in our politically correct, present day) almost unspeakable questions.As for the movie itself:At almost 4 hours it is a very long and not particularly focused movie; as opposed to other movies of the same genre, say, Braveheart. It's often hard to follow the thread of events from one scene to the next. There are very powerful scenes next to scenes that left me completly baffled(the train conductor scene, the bonnie blue flag folk dance). In some ways it works almost as well as a sort of anthology of civil war video images, as it does a movie. The battle scenes get the job done, sometimes very realistically, but director Maxwell's decision to use re-enactors instead of real soldiers was kind of unfortunate.. Re-enactors tend to be people who have the money and leisure time to pursue such an expensive, involved hobby (middle aged men).I would second all the praise that's been given to Stephen Lang's perfomance as Jackson, and I'll advise you not to pay any attention to reviewers who characterise the movie's characters open (and historically correct) expression of their religious faith as smarmy televangelist displays of religion. These reviewers strike me as people with a chip on their shoulder, who would most probably describe any display of Christianity in such a broad, stereotypical manner.To finish, just let me say that, yes, people very probably did talk like that! The educated of those times lived and breathed the classics of western civilization and it was almost certainly reflected in the way they chose to speak.

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","And yet, it's a brilliant reconstruction of the early years of the Civil War and centers most of its attention on the remarkable characterization of Stonewall Jackson (Stephen Lang). Lang's performance as Jackson is the highlight and strength of all the non-combative scenes--a truly masterful job of bringing the man to life. One of the most vivid and colorful performances I've seen in a long while.In ""Gettysburg"" it was Jeff Daniels who was most impressive, but here it's definitely Stephen Lang who almost single-handedly carries the last portion of the film where he is wounded and gradually succumbs to pneumonia.The recreation of the battles is again stunningly photographed and choreographed, from Bull Run to Fredericksburg to Chancelorsville and there is plenty of heartbreak and dispair as the cruel war inflicts men on both sides of battle. But the film's strength comes in the quieter moments, such as the stunning Christmas sequence in a Virginia home where Jackson is befriended by a pretty little child who has made an ornament for the Christmas tree. This sequence, and others like it, are interior scenes that dominate the second half of the story, adding much human interest and warmth to the proceedings.Well worth watching for anyone who is a student of the Civil War, although there is much unsaid about the glorious ""cause"" that the South fought for.

Anderson""","[11, 22]","Everything that made ""Killer Angels"" and ""Gettysburg"" so effective and powerful is absent from this movie: taking a major historical event and taking it down to the human element; not of the average soldier, but the human element in the event's leaders.I tried to see Gods and Generals in the theater and couldn't even last until intermission (was there an intermission?).  If you are a civil war buff who is only interested in the big battle scenes, you may like some of this. If you are interested in the human element of the war--which is what makes the Civil War so powerful even 140 years later, this film is horrible.All the sanctimonious speechmaking that fills the non-battle scenes are intolarable.  In terms of accurate portrayals and white-washing of the characters, I'll leave to other reviewers.But even during the open credits music, I could tell I was in for a rough ride. Instead of just showing us and letting us make our own emotional conclusions, this started with the ""oh, I'm telling you audiences this is going to be a powerful and moving story--If you are not deeply moved, there is something wrong with you!""--sort of a technique Spielberg uses in his historical films--which is why his are so over-rated!Missing where the interactions that were so moving in Killer Angels and Gettysberg: Armistead's opening up to Longstreet about his conflicts about fighting his closest friend, and Chamberlain's--well most everything about Chamberlain was remarkably dead-on in the first movie.  Remarkable historical characters portrayed with remarkable human performances by Jeff Daniels and a sadly missed Richard Jordan.  Daniels, so great the first time, should had stayed home. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is one of my true heros; Jeff remarkably captured the essence of the man the first time; despite obvious aging (double chin and all) between films, I assume at least part of Jeff's problem was the material.And that brings us to the main problem: I think most of the problem is in the source: Jeff Shaara's novel (which I did try to read) was just lacking in everything that made his father's novel so powerful, especially when considering the scope of the event.  The emotional resonance in Killer Angels was honest and intimate; Gods and Generals is dishonest and contrived. Since Maxwell did so well the first time, I just assume the fault is with the material--He had nothing to work with.As other reviewers have said here, Gods and Generals is a quick history of 2 years of the Civil War with simplistic and artificiallay reverent views of the primarary characters and expressed in a style of santamonious and other artificial wrappings that do nothing to capture the real power of these events.Needless to say, a deep disappointment!!",1,Unwatchable--and I'm interested in the Civil War!,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2762,"['Everything', 'made', 'Killer', 'Angels', 'Gettysburg', 'so', 'effective', 'powerful', 'absent', 'movie', 'taking', 'major', 'historical', 'event', 'taking', 'down', 'human', 'element', 'not', 'average', 'soldier', 'human', 'element', 'event', 'leaders.I', 'tried', 'see', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'theater', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'intermission', 'was', 'intermission', 'are', 'civil', 'war', 'buff', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'may', 'like', 'are', 'interested', 'human', 'element', 'war', 'what', 'Civil', 'War', 'so', 'powerful', 'even', '140', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'sanctimonious', 'speechmaking', 'non-battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'intolarable', 'terms', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'white-washing', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'other', 'reviewers.But', 'even', 'open', 'credits', 'music', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'rough', 'ride', 'Instead', 'just', 'showing', 'letting', 'make', 'own', 'emotional', 'conclusions', 'started', 'oh', ""'m"", 'telling', 'audiences', 'going', 'be', 'powerful', 'moving', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'deeply', 'moved', 'something', 'wrong', 'sort', 'technique', 'Spielberg', 'historical', 'films', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'over-rated', 'Missing', 'where', 'interactions', 'were', 'so', 'moving', 'Killer', 'Angels', 'Gettysberg', 'Armistead', 'opening', 'up', 'Longstreet', 'conflicts', 'fighting', 'closest', 'friend', 'Chamberlain', 'well', 'most', 'everything', 'Chamberlain', 'was', 'remarkably', 'dead-on', 'first', 'movie', 'Remarkable', 'historical', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'remarkable', 'human', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'sadly', 'missed', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Daniels', 'so', 'great', 'first', 'time', 'should', 'had', 'stayed', 'home', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'one', 'true', 'heros', 'Jeff', 'remarkably', 'captured', 'essence', 'man', 'first', 'time', 'obvious', 'aging', 'double', 'chin', 'films', 'assume', 'least', 'part', 'Jeff', 'problem', 'was', 'material.And', 'main', 'problem', 'think', 'most', 'problem', 'source', 'Jeff', 'Shaara', 'novel', 'did', 'try', 'read', 'was', 'just', 'lacking', 'everything', 'made', 'father', 'novel', 'so', 'powerful', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'scope', 'event', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Killer', 'Angels', 'was', 'honest', 'intimate', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'dishonest', 'contrived', 'Maxwell', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'assume', 'fault', 'material', 'had', 'nothing', 'work', 'with.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'quick', 'history', '2', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'simplistic', 'artificiallay', 'reverent', 'views', 'primarary', 'characters', 'expressed', 'style', 'santamonious', 'other', 'artificial', 'wrappings', 'do', 'nothing', 'capture', 'real', 'power', 'events.Needless', 'say', 'deep', 'disappointment']",N/A

Well, I guess you'll just have to watch it and judge for yourself.This was a film which centered on Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. It was long and had many slow moving parts to it. It did try to cover (too much?) roughly a third of the war. And yes, it did leave out some of the momentous battles of the first couple of years of the conflict.Still, unless the makers were to intend having almost a serial, it would be hard to include all the battles without making the movie inpossible to watch in a sitting or two.The film, as you've probably read, hits on first Manassas (Bull Run), first Fredricksburg (yes, there were two of those also) and Chancellorsville. It gives one a depth of insight into the charactor of Gen Jackson and his outlook on the war. For those of us who delve into the war, it shows the slaughter at Fredricksburg thru the blunder and stubborness of Gen Burnsides, and the overwhelming Confederate victory at Chancellorsville (probably Lee's greatest victory).The acting IS good and the human element runs throughout the film making this more than just a documentary.As to a recommendation, I'd say that if you are a student of the war, you will probably enjoy the film in spite of the faults it has. If you're looking for just a night's entertainment and don't really know much about the American Civil War, you'll probably want to watch something else.Just an afterthought to the producers.

I was pleased to see that such fears were totally unwarranted.Gods and Generals is an excellent start to the trilogy, a start which actually improves Gettysburg by its existance.DuVal in my opinion was born to play Lee as much as he was born to play Tom Hayden, in addition Stephen Lang give an Oscar worthy performance as Stonwall Jackson, (far superior to his job in the first movie as Pickett.)  however since this is a sympathetic portrayal of not only a Confederate General but a believer in Christ that is as likely as Ms Streisand joining Demorcrats for Bush.  It would not be a stretch to say that this movie is Turner's love letter to the south and some might object on that basis, that however ignores two relevent facts:  This is a quality picture in its own right and it will not change the outcome of the war.Howell and Conway repeat their fine performances from the first movie and a stockier Jess Daniels frankly improves on his first performance.The action scenes and the battle scenes were also an improved over the first picture.  I suspect practice makes perfect and the next movie will likely be even better.The Character development on the home front and the torn loyalties of both slaves and their masters are portrayed well.  This great contradiction which Daniels expands on in his final speech make the movie more interesting and also makes it dangerous to the PC crowd.I can't shake the feeling however that it should have been two movies.  Like the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter movies this movie delivers quality and a lot of picture for your money, unlike those movies which didn't feel long this one did.  It is the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars.I will without a doubt buy the extended DVD when it comes out and will await the final move with pleasure.  I hope the poor box office doesn't prevent it from being made.  (After all Turner can afford it.)",4,Far better than Gettysburg.

There are several reasons.First, I find that most war films are so anti-war that it doesn't resemble the war itself - it focuses on one perspective.  This film tries to show why the South left the Union and shows how passionate the combatants were about the right of their side.  Furthermore, it shows that there was a sense of glory in fighting for the right - a thought which is lost on most film makers who attempt to tackle the subject of war.  However, the film does not shy away from the darker sides of war as we see the Irish fighting each other.I think the film is also pretty good because it is edited quite well.

Until Gods and Generals I despaired to believe that anyone anywhere could somehow make a decent Civil War movie.  The Vietnam War had its Platoon. The American Revolution had its Patriot (although it was no Brave Heart) and World War II had its Saving Private Ryan.Yes, we've seen films such as Glory. Glory--great action scenes to be sure and Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington were amazing. Yet, it was one sided.Who walked out of the theater after viewing Glory knew that two years before the black 54th Mass regiment was mustered in the north, there were free black volunteer units serving for the South, one including the 1st LA? (Not to mention the 90,000 other free African Americans who served and died in the Southern armies.Glory was like...making a movie about the horrors of Nazi Germany without including the holocaust or a movie about the old west without including Native Americans. You shouldn't make a movie based on historical events if you plan to hack a truth in half. The 54th Mass had its 15 moments of fame...when will the 90,000 black soldiers of the South get theirs?Blue & Gray and even Gettysburg was more fiction than historical.  In the movie Gettysburg there is a scene of a runaway slave being liberated in the 20th Maine's camp. It never happened.  However there are both testimonies and written accounts of free black Confederate soldiers in Gettysburg, one of which Lt. Colonel Fremantle (who was portrayed in the movie) had written about in his book after the Civil War.Then came Gods and Generals. Based on the reviews I've seen, most people think the truth sucks. Stonewall Jackson, the great SOUTHERN general recruits and befriends a black citizen named Jim Lewis.  Throughout the movie the Southern characters proclaim their cause is not slavery but independence. How many of you cringed when Lee's character quoted to Blair's character his understanding of the Northern cause stating, ""I never thought I would see the day when the goverment would raise an army to invade its own country."" Boy, this pissed off some PC pukes and some other views naive to true history.It may piss them off even more to know that Jim Lewis was a real Confederate soldier. Or...that nearly every account written by a Confederate soldier on why he enlisted was to defend that state and secure its independence, just as the movie told. Who would question that the armies from the Northern states invaded the Southern states. Battle of Manassas,VIRGINIA. HELLO. Many of you may have had ancestors who had been POWs in Japan or Vietnam or Germany. Three of my ancestors were POWS in... Chicago, ILLINOIS.Furthermore, every major speech in the movie spoken by Jackson's character was historically to the T.My advice to the critics who shammed this movie--shut up. Gods and Generals was the most unique experience in your movie-viewing lives because you actually learned something.Truth aside, I loved it! Where Gettysburg and Glory used women less than even as extras but more as props, Gods and Generals provided the screen with beautiful and talented women in leading and dramatic roles.Where in the series', Blue & Gray or North & South the battle scenes looked as deadly and real as local cable wrestling, Gods and Generals provided us with three of the Civil War's most explosive battles that included thousands of actual CW reenactor extras, sound effects, and visual effects. I was blown away.Lastly, where other CW movies centered on childhood history book poster boys, Gods and Generals blessed us with not only the most well known heroes of that time but also their deep, dark, and dramatic personal stories and emotions.

755896,A2TY359PR45ATP,B00009OOFA,"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","This is an excellent film on the Civil War - told mostly from the Southern side - that could have been great, save for a couple of major flaws. First, at 229 minutes it is way too long for a theatrical release. Second, even at its current length, too much has been omitted. The Battle of Antietam was an integral part of Jeff Shaara's novel and the linchpin battle for Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation - it should have been covered. Other battles, like the Valley Campaign and Second Manassas should have been at least featured briefly to show how the legend that became Stonewall Jackson developed. The theatrical format was probably a loser from the get-go; a mini-series TV format would have been much better...sort of a companion piece to Ken Burns docudrama on the Civil War. But flaws aside, from a personal perspective as a Civil War history buff, I love this film. I've watched it many times...I always get a rush during the battle scenes and a lump in my throat at the end. The acting - especially by Jeff Daniels, Robert Duvall and Stephen Lang - is superb. Lang as Stonewall Jackson delivers his best performance ever (my opinion of course) eclipsing his performance as George Pickett in Gettysburg. Jackson was an eccentric military genius and it took a lot of study and talent to portray him properly...Lang's performance is dead-on. Hats off to Ted Turner for producing this and Gettysburg...he has a cameo role in both films as Col. Waller Patton, the great uncle of George Patton.

755897,AX3E6577EMASF,B00009OOFA,Rex,"[1, 1]","It's not really a good &#34;movie&#34; in the sense of appealing to a mass audience. That's probably why it did so poorly at the box office when it was released originally in 2003. This 150th anniversary edition is the director's cut, which include several scenes not in the original, most notably, the battle of Antietam. If you are a Civil War buff, you'll enjoy this. You'll just have to looks past all the soppy melodrama and the way Thomas &#34;Stonewall&#34; Jackson is portrayed. It's kind of laughable, really. But the battle scenes are first-rate and done extremely well. The battle of Fredericksburg is phenomenal.On thing that always bothered me about this film is that fact that is really does center on Stonewall Jackson as the primary focus - at least from the Confederate point of view. Yet it completely ignores his Valley Campaign of 1862, which quite honestly is what made him so well known and famous. The film leaps from First Manassas to Antietam and pretty much ignores Jackson's victory after victory after victory in the spring of 1862. Not really sure why.So if you are a student of the Civil War, you will really like this film. If not, you'll probably be a bit bored with all that goes on between battles.

755898,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00009OOFA,Richard Masloski,"[2, 2]","When this movie first came out around ten years ago I heard through the grapevine that it was long and boring and lousy and not worth my ticket money or time! Flash forward to a week ago.  I noticed this two disc DVD in a bargain bin at FYE.  It was going for peanuts - and I did an Abbott and Costello pack/unpack routine in my mind for a few minutes.  I kept remembering all those who had told me to beware the phony beards and stilted speechifying in this flick - and that the monologues were even more bloated and bloviatingly boring than those in the same director's GETTYSBURG, of which GODS AND GENERALS was a prequel.  Anyhow, I paid the five bucks or so for the two disc turkey.  I had been wanting to wean off of sleeping pills of late - and thought that this type of big bloated boring bilge might do me in for a natural snooze.Wow!!!If for NO other reason than to see Stephen Lang give an Oscar-worthy performance as ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the five or so bucks were indubitably worth every penny.  How could this be the same man whose boozy breath I could smell off the screen in TOMBSTONE wherein Mr. Lang portrayed the scurvy Ike Clanton?  And remembering back, was this the same actor who incarnated Happy Loman so beautifully in the Dustin Hoffman DEATH OF A SALESMAN?  And was the General Jackson in GODS AND GENERALS once popinjay Pickett in GETTYSBURG? They were  and are all the same magnificent actor!  And because GODS AND GENERALS tragically tanked at the box office (and thereby killing the plans, it seems, for the final installment of the projected trilogy) Mr. Lang gets nary a nod from the un-astute Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science.  Yet as evidenced in this film, Lang's General Jackson is what acting is all about.  He is captivating, intoxicatingly watchable, fully dimensioned and all encompassing.  So, as said, if Mr. Lang's performance were the only reason to watch this film, it is very much reason enough.It is easy, yes, to beat up on this film.  It does have too many sermons, fake beards here and there, not nearly enough of Robert Duvall's visually impressive Robert E. Lee.  There is a deluge of treacly music underscoring so many scenes that would have worked much better without it.  The slavery issue is not dealt with in any depth at all.  The battles - especially those on the first disc - were mostly dull and sanitized.  The distant views of Confederate cities are too obviously paintings.  The few CGI effects are poor.  If it were not for the character of Stonewall Jackson, I might have stalled on disc two, putting it off for another day.But I didn't.  And with disc two, the movie actually got much better.  It seemed as if it were written and directed by someone other than Ronald Maxwell.  The music, definitely, was mostly wonderful in Act Two.  The music fit the scenes and didn't work against them as it did in Act One.  The music for the build-up and attack at Chancellorsville, as well as the direction and editing of this powerful sequence, were also well worth the discount price I paid for the DVD.  In looking back at the credits, I noticed that there were two composers of the score. That might be the explanation for the seismic shift in musical style.Other memorable moments: Jackson's heartfelt relationship with the little girl, the execution of three soldiers, the Confederate Christmas scene and the incredibly moving extension of the Christmas scene where Johnny Reb and Billy Yank meet halfway on a stone path in the river that separates them in their guard duty.  That scene in and of itself makes GODS AND GENERALS worth the time to watch it.  And in that scene of the meeting of the two soldiers, it is what isn't said that makes the scene the powerful one that it is. And thank God the screenplay didn't have them philosophizing during their brief encounter! Sometimes...silence is golden, as witness in this riveting sequence. There is also a nighttime scene where Lee and Jackson are discussing the strategy that will lead to Chancellorsville that seemed not so much a scene in a movie, but a tete-a-tete we viewers just happened upon.  Of course, Jackson's highly accurate in its depiction death and his final passing are magnificently acted and directed.  And the very last scene of the film is deeply poetic and profound on many levels.The extras are of some interest. The JOURNEY TO THE PAST mini-documentary goes into more depth on the slavery issue than anything really in the film. The documentary on Jackson is all-too-brief, but what there was of it was okay.  Especially the shots of the statue. The music video by Bob Dylan is bizarre.  But the bottom line in all this is - GODS AND GENERALS - though very flawed, is also very fine.  Especially with Stephen Lang as the very flawed but very fine General ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  This performance in this movie is not to be missed.",4,IKE CLANTON???????,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,4878,"['When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'heard', 'grapevine',

As for this film, it is centered around the career of General Stonewall Jackson. There are capable performances from the major actors: Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Mira Sorvino and others. As another reviewer aptly put it: It is like looking at a talking version of Civil War paintings with the actors reading their parts from history books. There are lines that make me wince like ""we who are about to die salute you!"". Even though its the 1860's, I doubt people then spoke like that. Great costumes, sets, and battle sequences. This is a long, slow, plodding film, but if you are a Civil War buff, you will find it interesting. The Blu ray transfer is very good in both color and detail.

I have a more vivid recollection of the first than the last one I was in. It is a classical maxim that it is sweet and becoming to die for one's country; but whoever has seen the horrors of a battle-field feels that it is far sweeter to live for it.""This is from the celebrated Confederate Raider John S. Mosby's ""Mosby's War Reminiscences"", a book of his memories of the Civil War - but little of the wisdom of the passage above is communicated in Gods and Generals. It is sad to say that ""Gods and Generals"" is a movie that paints with grade-school brush strokes a story that deserves a far finer and more detailed brush. The Civil War still remains to this day the single most important event in the history of this country - save for that of the original Revolutionary War - and it deserves a better retelling than this goopy mess.What kept this movie from even beginning to interest me (as a big Civil War buff) was the unimaginable treacle in the tone of the movie. More sugar and sanctimony dripped off the dialog in this movie than did from three consecutive showings of the seventies tearjerker Love Story! It didn't bother me that the movie was a view of the war from the Southern standpoint - that isn't the issue. What is the issue is the view of this war in a virtual downpour of honeyed and glowing Hallmark Moments. The revision of history by scenes showing slave support and affection for their masters isn't totally without some measure of truth - but it is dreadfully close.Yes, the war was more about economics (industry versus agriculture) and politics (federal versus state) - at least in the beginning. But by the time the war was halfway through it did become at least in part a battle for human rights due to the Emancipation Proclamation and the inclusion of African-Americans in the ranks of the Union.Two stars for the professional editing and good job of acting by most parties - but no more than that indicator of mediocrity due to the crazily skewed view of war as a noble endeavor without a single recrimination or even some attempt at the true feelings of the overwhelming majority of soldiers and civilians whom suffered through more than four years of misery and death. If some prefer to view this as a true representation of war, then they are blessed in their ignorance of the essential and overriding components of armed conflicts - death and destruction. And the Civil War had more of those two horrors than any other war fought by Americans - something that is terribly under-represented in this film.",2,Sanctimonious,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,2618,"['War', 'great', 'deal', 'romance', 'soldier', 'seen', 'first', 'battle', 'have', 'more', 'vivid', 'recollection', 'first', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'classical', 'maxim', 'sweet', 'becoming', 'die', 'one', 'country', 'seen', 'horrors', 'battle-field', 'feels', 'far', 'sweeter', 'live', 'celebrated', 'Confederate', 'Raider', 'John', 'S.', 'Mosby', 'Mosby', 'War', 'Reminiscences', 'book', 'memories', 'Civil', 'War', 'little', 'wisdom', 'passage', 'above', 'communicated', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'sad', 'say', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'movie', 'grade-school', 'brush', 'story', 'far', 'finer', 'more', 'detailed', 'brush', 'Civil', 'War', 'still', 'day', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'event', 'history', 'country', 'save', 'original', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'better', 'retelling', 'goopy', 'mess.What', 'kept', 'movie', 'even', 'beginning', 'interest', 'big', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'was', 'unimaginable', 'treacle', 'tone', 'movie', 'More', 'sugar', 'sanctimony', 'dripped', 'dialog', 'movie', 'did', 'three', 'consecutive', 'showings', 'seventies', 'tearjerker', 'Love', 'Story', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'movie', 'was', 'view', 'war', 'Southern', 'standpoint', ""n't"", 'issue', 'What', 'issue', 'view', 'war', 'virtual', 'downpour', 'honeyed', 'glowing', 'Hallmark', 'Moments', 'revision', 'history', 'scenes', 'showing', 'slave', 'support', 'affection', 'masters', ""n't"", 'totally', 'measure', 'truth', 'dreadfully', 'close.Yes', 'war', 'was', 'more', 'economics', 'industry', 'agriculture', 'politics', 'federal', 'versus', 'state', 'least', 'beginning', 'time', 'war', 'was', 'halfway', 'did', 'become', 'least', 'part', 'battle', 'human', 'rights', 'due', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'inclusion', 'African-Americans', 'ranks', 'Union.Two', 'stars', 'professional', 'editing', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'most', 'parties', 'more', 'indicator', 'mediocrity', 'due', 'crazily', 'skewed', 'view', 'war', 'noble', 'endeavor', 'single', 'recrimination', 'even', 'attempt', 'true', 'feelings', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'whom', 'suffered', 'more', 'four', 'years', 'misery', 'death', 'prefer', 'view', 'true', 'representation', 'war', 'then', 'are', 'blessed', 'ignorance', 'essential', 'overriding', 'components', 'armed', 'conflicts', 'death', 'destruction', 'Civil', 'War', 'had', 'more', 'two', 'horrors', 'other', 'war', 'fought', 'Americans', 'something', 'terribly', 'under-represented', 'film']",N/A

Also have not read the book and cannot compare that.  However, I was pleased with the overall Christian theme of the movie. It was especially wonderful to see a husband and wife reading the Bible together, soldiers praying together, and a reverence for the Lord throughout the film. I think it shared some ""lesser known"" history facts when the Civil War is skimmed in a history book. As with anything, it depends on a viewpoint and this removes Lincoln, much of the North, and focuses greatly on Stonewall Jackson.  Some have asserted that this makes it ""Southern Propoganda"" ~ really, I think that because the Civil War was such a complex event and people were involved (whether they liked it or not) in a myriad of ways, it is really just ""one part"" of the story and should be viewed as such.  I don't believe that the filmakers set out to purport that this is the ONLY view of the Civil War.  Just telling one small story part of an enormous WHOLE.

755903,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00009OOFA,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[14, 18]","I finally had the opportunity to watch _Gods and Generals_ last night. I watched it, my wife went to bed after 2 hours of the 4 hours, partly because she needed to get up to go to work this morning, but mostly because i think she gets tired of me cheering for Johnny Reb. I am an unashamed Southern sympathizer even though i was raised in southern California, it may very well be genetic however as my mom's people come from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the one time i met my grandfather it was pretty obvious he was Southern. I watched the movie, absorbed by the characters, heart raced by the battle scenes, in tears at the horror and destruction of war. I yelled at the lines of foolish men throwing their lives into a pit as the walked into the hail of cannonfire and minibullets (come to think of it my wife might of disliked that part to), laughed as 1 of the 3 main characters hailed from Maine (my wife's adopted state), a college professor of history and philosophy, but warmed up to him as he quoted Julius Caesar's crossing the Rubicon at length just before a battle. So in general i acted like a crazy football fan at the finals, cheering the Gray and booing the Blue.But as i reflect upon the movie, it is the Christianity of the Generals that comes through most strongly, and here i am as little impartial as i am to the participants. I share in the conservative faith of Jackson, i think Robert Dabney is one of the best theologians America has ever raised up. I was truely amazed that a movie would be done in modern secular anti-theistic America where the lead characters really pray, really believe, really love the Lord, (Wow, how did that get past the censors?) or be thought to make any money? Their faith is not dumbed down, the hard parts are presented as in where Jackson sits and cries for the death of a little girl by scarlet fever as his men remark-but he didnt cry for all the men we've lost. The minority view of the war is presented straight forward at several places: the Civil War as the Second American Revolution, the role of the Irish, slavery as a side issue not the important one, the contradictory role of the races in Jackson's praying with his black cook, or the protection of a white family's house by their brave women slave and her children and her talk to northerners about wanting to be free, for example. I had even hoped that somewhere on the extra disk would be several alternative endings where the South won.And this is where my thinking is pushed by this most extraordinary movie, alternatives. They all revolve around the Faith and slavery, Biblical Christianity and ethnic relationships where a history of such epic proportions and such real horror intertwine with fundamental principles and good sound religious belief. This is the great value of the movie being as true as it possibly can to the historical conditions of the Civil War, for it was a religious as well as an economic, (industrial v. agarian), political (right to sucession), or what-have-you war. This is often minimized in our era of weak believism, mild feelings about religious things, a general feelings that religion isn't a great motivator, money and politics are. Well, secular America meet your great great grandparents, see their religious beliefs mirrored in the young suicide bombers in Israel, or the car bombers in Iraq. Religious beliefs are worth dying and even killing for, today as they where in 1861-4.But it is in the mixture of truth and error that the movie hints at in the relationship of the races that is to me the takehome message that i need to dwell on, for those issues are not finished in today's America and the war was finished so long ago. Jackson (not in the movie but in real life) knelt with slaves in church, praying to the same Lord. Lee owned slaves, Dabney defended slavery in a book 20 years after the war. The South did fight to preserve the 'peculiar institution', slavery, abolitionists where Christians as well, although often Unitarians not Presbyterians. And this is where the present hits 1861 headon, and the power and the bright coloration of history so as to make it alive and real in the movie has great value. This is the extraordinary opportunity that the movie gives us, to revisit and re-evaluate our past, as if the issues are meaningful to us, important to us as they were to Jackson, or Lee, or whats-his-name you know the Maine guy. That is why i recommend even Yankees to watch the movie, to learn what moved our ancestors in a way that a book just can't do. So thanks all of you who contributed to this movie for an accurate picture of a piece of the War for Southern Rights.",5,3 men and 3 battles in the 2nd American revolution,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,4662,"['finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', '_Gods', 'Generals_', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'wife', 'went', 'bed', '2', 'hours', '4', 'hours', 'partly', 'needed', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'work', 'morning', 'mostly', 'i', 'think', 'tired', 'cheering', 'Johnny', 'Reb', 'am', 'unashamed', 'Southern', 'sympathizer', 'even', 'i', 'was', 'raised', 'southern', 'California', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'genetic', 'however', 'mom', 'people', 'come', 'Eastern', 'Shore', 'Maryland', 'one', 'time', 'i', 'met', 'grandfather', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'was', 'Southern', 'watched', 'movie', 'absorbed', 'characters', 'heart', 'raced', 'battle', 'scenes', 'tears', 'horror', 'destruction', 'war', 'yelled', 'lines', 'foolish', 'men', 'throwing', 'lives', 'pit', 'walked', 'hail', 'cannonfire', 'minibullets', 'come', 'think', 'wife', 'might', 'disliked', 'part', 'laughed', '1', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'hailed', 'Maine', 'wife', 'adopted', 'state', 'college', 'professor', 'history', 'philosophy', 'warmed', 'up', 'quoted', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'crossing', 'Rubicon', 'length', 'just', 'battle', 'So', 'general', 'i', 'acted', 'crazy', 'football', 'fan', 'finals', 'cheering', 'Gray', 'booing', 'Blue.But', 'i', 'reflect', 'movie', 'Christianity', 'Generals', 'most', 'strongly', 'here', 'i', 'am', 'as', 'little', 'impartial', 'i', 'am', 'participants', 'share', 'conservative', 'faith', 'Jackson', 'i', 'think', 'Robert', 'Dabney', 'one', 'best', 'theologians', 'America', 'ever', 'raised', 'up', 'was', 'truely', 'amazed', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'modern', 'secular', 'anti-theistic', 'America', 'where', 'lead', 'characters', 'really', 'pray', 'really', 'believe', 'really', 'love', 'Lord', 'Wow', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'censors', 'be', 'thought', 'make', 'money', 'faith', 'not', 'dumbed', 'down', 'hard', 'parts', 'are', 'presented', 'where', 'Jackson', 'cries', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'men', 'remark-but', 'cry', 'men', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'minority', 'view', 'war', 'presented', 'straight', 'forward', 'several', 'places', 'Civil', 'War', 'Second', 'American', 'Revolution', 'role', 'Irish', 'slavery', 'side', 'issue', 'not', 'important', 'one', 'contradictory', 'role', 'races', 'Jackson', 'praying', 'black', 'cook', 'protection', 'white', 'family', 'house', 'brave', 'women', 'slave', 'children', 'talk', 'northerners', 'wanting', 'be', 'free', 'example', 'had', 'even', 'hoped', 'somewhere', 'extra', 'disk', 'would', 'be', 'several', 'alternative', 'endings', 'where', 'South', 'won.And', 'where', 'thinking', 'pushed', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'alternatives', 'revolve', 'Faith', 'slavery', 'Biblical', 'Christianity', 'ethnic', 'relationships', 'where', 'history', 'such', 'epic', 'proportions', 'such', 'real', 'horror', 'intertwine', 'fundamental', 'principles', 'good', 'sound', 'religious', 'belief', 'great', 'value', 'movie', 'being', 'as', 'true', 'possibly', 'can', 'historical', 'conditions', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'religious', 'as', 'well', 'economic', 'industrial', 'v.', 'agarian', 'political', 'right', 'sucession', 'what-have-you', 'war', 'often', 'minimized', 'era', 'weak', 'believism', 'mild', 'feelings', 'religious', 'things', 'general', 'feelings', 'religion', ""n't"", 'great', 'motivator', 'money', 'politics', 'are', 'Well', 'secular', 'America', 'meet', 'great', 'great', 'grandparents', 'see', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'mirrored', 'young', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'Israel', 'car', 'bombers', 'Iraq', 'Religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'worth', 'dying', 'even', 'killing', 'today', 'where', '1861-4.But', 'mixture', 'truth', 'error', 'movie', 'hints', 'relationship', 'races', 'takehome', 'message', 'i', 'need', 'dwell', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'finished', 'today', 'America', 'war', 'was', 'finished', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Jackson', 'not', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'knelt', 'slaves', 'church', 'praying', 'same', 'Lord', 'Lee', 'owned', 'slaves', 'Dabney', 'defended', 'slavery', 'book', '20', 'years', 'war', 'South', 'did', 'fight', 'preserve', ""'peculiar"", 'institution', 'slavery', 'where', 'Christians', 'as', 'well', 'often', 'not', 'Presbyterians', 'where', 'present', 'hits', '1861', 'headon', 'power', 'bright', 'coloration', 'history', 'so', 'make', 'alive', 'real', 'movie', 'great', 'value', 'extraordinary', 'opportunity', 'movie', 'revisit', 're-evaluate', 'past', 'issues', 'are', 'meaningful', 'important', 'were', 'Jackson', 'Lee', 'whats-his-name', 'know', 'Maine', 'guy', 'why', 'i', 'recommend', 'even', 'Yankees', 'watch', 'movie', 'learn', 'what', 'moved', 'ancestors', 'way', 'book', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'So', 'thanks', 'who', 'contributed', 'movie', 'accurate', 'picture', 'piece', 'War', 'Southern', 'Rights']",N/A
755904,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00009OOFA,Robert Graves,"[6, 9]","I have been waiting for a producer to make the Civil War equivalent of Saving Private Ryan. God's and Generals is not it.The film covers secession to Gettysburg, and since this is the period of the war that was dominated by the South, our focus is there, with Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. This is Gods and Generals' strong point, in telling us the story from an unfamiliar perspective, the South's, showing us that they were God-fearing men and women who believed they were doing the right thing in defending their own land, which was being invaded by a rebel force (the North.)Despite the epic length and acting, there is really nothing epic about this film. In fact, it's so generic you're not even sure what battle you're in or who's fighting in it. Every southerner has the same, overdone fake accent and speaks in maxims, as though there is a scribe there to write down everything that comes out of their mouth. Apparently, because we have some proverbial-style quotes from people of this era the screenwriters assumed everyone just *talked* like this. With every awkward burst of dialogue you feel like the stage should darken with a spotlight on the orator, as he/she gives us a lengthy dictum about the state of humanity. Others in the room crease their lips and exchange solemn gazes, all to aware of the weight of their undertaking.This is called the ""romanticizing of history"" and I thought Ronald Maxwell (the director) would be above it. I suppose we all have an image in our heads of these noble people conscious of their place in history, knowing future generations would be scrutinizing their every letter or speech. Of course they didn't know, any more than we are aware of our place in history right now. But don't try telling that to the characters in Gods and Generals. They say every line and give every speech with the same emotion that we read those things on the page - teary-eyed and fully aware of their implications. However, we have the benefit of 150 years of knowing how these people would affect history; they did not. The power of a historical film should *not* be in seeing the actors deliver lines their characters are famous for saying, with all the angst of history behind them. Why? *Because they didn't have the angst of history behind them when they actually said it.* What makes a historical film great is watching a character deliver a line in an ordinary way, loading it with a wryness that only we, on the other side of history, can fully understand.Gods and Generals is essentially a blur of battle-speeches, poor Maine accents, clich&eacute;d slaves and PG-13 battle scenes. For anyone truly interested in the Civil War, and willing to invest the hours that this film requires, you would do much better to get the Ken Burns DVD series. The facts are presented in the right way, to make you understand that these were just normal men and women who were only doing what they knew to be the right thing, not self-aware ""Gods and Generals"" who knew they were on the stage of history for all to see.",3,Long and Generic,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,3047,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'producer', 'make', 'Civil', 'War', 'equivalent', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'God', 'Generals', 'not', 'it.The', 'film', 'secession', 'Gettysburg', 'period', 'war', 'was', 'dominated', 'South', 'focus', 'there', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'strong', 'point', 'telling', 'story', 'unfamiliar', 'perspective', 'South', 'showing', 'were', 'God-fearing', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'defending', 'own', 'land', 'was', 'being', 'invaded', 'rebel', 'force', 'North', 'epic', 'length', 'acting', 'really', 'nothing', 'epic', 'film', 'fact', 'so', 'generic', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'battle', ""'re"", 'who', 'fighting', 'Every', 'southerner', 'same', 'overdone', 'fake', 'accent', 'speaks', 'maxims', 'scribe', 'there', 'write', 'down', 'everything', 'mouth', 'Apparently', 'have', 'proverbial-style', 'quotes', 'people', 'era', 'screenwriters', 'assumed', 'everyone', 'just', '*talked*', 'awkward', 'burst', 'dialogue', 'feel', 'stage', 'should', 'darken', 'spotlight', 'orator', 'he/she', 'lengthy', 'dictum', 'state', 'humanity', 'Others', 'room', 'crease', 'lips', 'exchange', 'solemn', 'gazes', 'aware', 'weight', 'undertaking.This', 'called', 'romanticizing', 'history', 'thought', 'Ronald', 'Maxwell', 'director', 'would', 'be', 'suppose', 'have', 'image', 'heads', 'noble', 'people', 'conscious', 'place', 'history', 'knowing', 'future', 'generations', 'would', 'be', 'scrutinizing', 'letter', 'speech', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'are', 'aware', 'place', 'history', 'right', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'telling', 'characters', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'say', 'line', 'give', 'speech', 'same', 'emotion', 'read', 'things', 'page', 'teary-eyed', 'fully', 'aware', 'implications', 'However', 'have', 'benefit', '150', 'years', 'knowing', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'affect', 'history', 'did', 'not', 'power', 'historical', 'film', 'should', '*not*', 'be', 'seeing', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'characters', 'are', 'famous', 'saying', 'angst', 'history', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'angst', 'history', 'when', 'actually', 'said', '*', 'What', 'historical', 'film', 'great', 'watching', 'character', 'deliver', 'line', 'ordinary', 'way', 'loading', 'wryness', 'only', 'other', 'side', 'history', 'can', 'fully', 'understand.Gods', 'Generals', 'essentially', 'blur', 'battle-speeches', 'poor', 'Maine', 'accents', 'clich', 'eacute', 'slaves', 'PG-13', 'battle', 'scenes', 'anyone', 'truly', 'interested', 'Civil', 'War', 'willing', 'invest', 'hours', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'get', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'DVD', 'series', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'right', 'way', 'make', 'understand', 'were', 'just', 'normal', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'doing', 'what', 'knew', 'be', 'right', 'thing', 'not', 'self-aware', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'who', 'knew', 'were', 'stage', 'history', 'see']",N/A
755905,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00009OOFA,Robert Moore,"[29, 47]","As a Southerner, my attitude towards the Civil War has always been complex.  From the time I could first read, I have been working my way through histories of the Civil War, and works by such able scholars as Shelby Foote, Douglas Southall Freeman, and Bruce Catton were staples of my childhood.  On the one hand, I have always lamented that the South fought for such a misguided cause, and ideologically the person I have always agreed most with was Abraham Lincoln.  Nonetheless, like previous Southerners like William Faulkner and Foote, while I lament our cause (which for all the talk of states rights was really about slavery--any reading of American history from 1790 to 1860 reveals that the main right the states were trying to protect was that of keeping slavery alive, and the war itself was provoked by issues of the extension of slavery into the new territories obtained during the Polk administration), I swell with regional pride over how well soldiers fought.  We continue to honor and esteem our heroes.  My mother, for instance, grew up in Cleburne County, Arkansas, named for General Pat Cleburne, regarded by many as one of if not the finest field general the South possessed (and ironically a strong opponent of slavery, like most of the Confederate leading generals).  I'm glad we lost, but I'm also glad we lost heroically.As a student of the Civil War, I loved the previous film based on a novel by a Schaara, GETTYSBURG, based on Michael's THE KILLER ANGELS, and was eagerly awaiting this new film by Michael's son Jeff.  But this has to be one of the most disappointing films that I have seen in my life.  I was expecting a great epic of the central historical event in American history.  What we got instead was a stuffy, stiff, and stunningly boring baggy monster of a movie.The film gets a number of things right, but the things that it gets right could be just as easily appreciated watching a documentary of Civil War reenactors.  It gets a lot of knick-knacks right, but it does so while completely failing to find a narrative voice or presenting believable, interesting characters.All of the major figures are presented more as talking statures, always striking poses, than real, live human beings.  While all of the central characters are guilty in this regard, but Stephen Lang's Stonewall Jackson is far and away the worse.  Without any question, Stonewall Jackson is one of the most delightful weirdoes in American history, and with George Patton one of the two most wonderfully eccentric figures in American military history.  Any of the biographies of Jackson capture this.  His narcolepsy (he fell asleep in one battle and for several hours could not be awakened, and while deeply religious, perhaps never heard a sermon all the way through, instead falling asleep every time), the oddity of his religious beliefs (he would not mail a letter that would be in the post on a Sunday, yet he loved to fight battles on the Sabbath), his hypochondria and fixation on quack remedies (Jackson would famously raise his left arm over his head and hold it there for a while to attempt to restore the balance in his body's circulation), his odd beliefs on a host of topics from pepper to his intense love of the state of New York (though dedicated to Virginia, he loved New York much the way that Sherman loved Louisiana and the South), all of these would seem to provide a world of opportunity for the writers to produce an utterly fascinating film character.  But Jackson in this film is duller than one can possible imagine.  It isn't really Lang's fault (though he does show a tendency to declaim rather than talk); it is primarily a function of the way the character is written.Much is made of the historical accuracy of the film, but Joshua Chamberlain is elevated to the position of a major character, even though he was an almost completely unknown figure before Ken Burns's THE CIVIL WAR.  I think it is wonderful that Burns rediscovered this fascinating individual, but odd that the Schaara's give him such a central place in their narratives.  I am also uncomfortable with the way the film as a whole exonerates the South in the War.  The film wants to shift the cause of the war away from Southern secession (which might have been prevented from spreading if James Buchanan hadn't been so utterly inactive during the period of time between Lincoln's election and inauguration--it was during this time that things went badly), as if breaking the country into pieces was in any way possible (read Lincoln's Second National Address for a powerful and cogent explanation why union was not only essential but why disunion was ultimately an impossibility), to the military aggression of the North.  This is simply irresponsible history, and the filmmakers would have done well to have someone like Shelby Foote or James MacPherson to save them from such silliness.  The brute fact is that the war was fought over slavery, and no cogent historical account of the war can avoid this.  Yes, state's rights was proffered as a cause, but apart from keeping limitations on northern industrial production (which threatened to overwhelm Southern agricultural production) the only real ""right"" the South insisted upon was the right to keep slaves.  The only time they started talking at length about states rights was when it appeared that expansion into new territories would produced more non-slave states than slave-states.  This film not only produces a simplistic understanding of the cause of the war, it presents a misguided one.These are failings of history and in the credible presentation of historical figures.  But the film completely fails both as a dramatic narrative and in producing interesting battle sequences.  The story is just wretchedly uninteresting.  The focus of the film seems to be more on generating a somber and respectful mood rather than creating anything approaching dramatic tension.  And how is it possible to produce such incredibly boring battle scenes?  It isn't just that the depictions of the battles provide absolutely no understanding of the battles themselves (I defy anyone to tell me what happened apart from Thomas J. Jackson acquiring a nickname at the first battle of Bull Run from the film's account).The performances don't really matter in the film.  For the most part, they function merely as props.  Duvall is good as Robert E. Lee (better, in fact, than Martin Sheen in GETTYSBURG), but this isn't a film about characters so much as large tableaux, and he is always pushed to the side during the film.  Jeff Daniels does a good job as Joshua L. Chamberlain, and is probably the only major figure who manages to make his character seem like a real person.I really can't recommend this film.  It is accurate without being historical, and as a film it lacks dramatic tension, interesting characters, or a compelling narrative.  Rarely have I anticipated a film with so much hope, only to be so completely disappointed.  I do recommend GETTYSBURG, and instead of seeing this I recommend seeing that instead.  One last complaint:  there is simply no excuse for a film to be this long.  It is very nearly this long unless it is doing a great job along the way.  It clocks in slightly under four hours, but one gets the sense at the end that nothing much happened.

This is an excellent film! The main reason I rated it only 4 stars is not based on any sins of commission , but on the errors of ommission. The film jumps from the first battle of Manassas to Fredricksburg and then to Chancellorsville without Lee's invasion of the North through Harpers Ferry and Antietam. The producers of the film skipped the bloodiest battle of the entire war!On the very positive side , the acting by Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee was magnificent. Frankie Faison portrayed &quot;Big Jim&quot;, Stonewall Jackson's cook very well. Historical accuracy: as many other reviewers have pointed out , the war was NOT simply about slavery. This film brings into focus many of the other issues involved , primarily the issues of sovereignty and federal coercion. The major issue of the economic impact of southern secession is not even touched upon.Anyone who is from the south or has freinds and relatives form the south can testify that the depiction of religeous fervor is accurate (altho' many reviewers have commented in a negative manner on this issue!).

755908,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00009OOFA,Roger J. Buffington,"[8, 10]","Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which I did not have the opportunity to see in the theater.  This is probably just as well--this is a long movie, almost a miniseries.  It is lovingly done, with an attention to detail that is almost astounding.  As others have noted, about the only consistently wrong detail in this movie is the well-fed look of the re-enactment extras; real Civil War soldiers on both sides were lean to an extent that is hard to appreciate today.  Some of the chubby fellows in this film would have slimmed down very quickly on the skimpy rations and forced marches that characterized this long hard conflict.  Having said that, it seemed to me that at least these re-enactment actors were a bit slimmer that the chubbers in &quot;Gettysburg.&quot;  No big deal.This is the story of the early portion of the Civil War, as written in Jeff Shaara's fine novel &quot;Gods and Generals,&quot; a prequel to &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by his father, Michael Shaara.  The acting is consistently good, but this is not a perfect movie.  It follows the &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; genre in that it is far too long in my opinion, and many scenes could have either been deleted or truncated.  They were not, and this film contains many long scenes that contribute little to the main storyline, which is essentially the story of the early Confederate victories in the war, and Thomas (&quot;Stonewall&quot;) Jackson's superb generalship and unique personality.  &quot;Gettysburg&quot; the movie to which this is a prequel, is not a short movie either, but its storyline moves along much snappier than this one, even though this film contains three battles rather than one, and in my opinion this should have enabled the director to concentrate better on the storyline since he had plenty of material to work with.  Just my opinion; there are doubtless many others.All that having been said, I really enjoyed the film.  Although some may not approve, one thing that this film did was avoid the &quot;Politically Correct&quot; interpretation of the Confederate cause and the Civil War itself.  While it acknowledges that slavery was one of the central issues in the war, it also emphasizes that there were other factors that led to the war, and that early on most Union men felt that they were fighting to preserve the Union, not to end slavery.  Some will criticize this film for being somewhat pro-Southern, and I think that this is probably true in the sense that the film relentlessly reminds the viewer that the Southern cause derived from the belief that the Confederate Army was defending the very homes and hearths of its soldiers.  This is emphasized in the film far more than the Union cause is, and for that matter it seemed to me that there were more scenes dealing with the Southern side than the Union side.  To that extent it is fair to say that this film gives a suprisingly favorable treatment to the Southern cause in these days of political correctness.  But another interpretation of this point of view is that it is an undeniable fact that the Confederate Army, always outnumbered and outsupplied, nevertheless marched from victory to victory during the early portion of the war, and not all of this can be explained by good generalship.  In fact the men were motivated by a cause in which they believed deeply, and this combined with skillful leadership caused the Confederate Army to become one of the great armies of all time.  By emphasizing what was undeniably a sincere belief in the Southern cause, this film does a creditable job explaining why the Confederate Army was so remarkably successful, and why this war was, and remains, the bloodiest and hardest war Americans have ever known.Overall, if you interested in the Civil War, you will appreciate and enjoy this film.

755909,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00009OOFA,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 17]","**1/2 ""Gods and Generals"" plays less like a movie and more like a three-hour-and-49-minute long lesson in Civil War history.  Grueling and plodding, the film is almost the antithesis of ""Gone With the Wind,"" in that while both films are epic tales told from the viewpoint of the defeated South, ""Gods and Generals"" (unlike the earlier film) has been essentially drained of all emotion, drama and characterization.  ""Gods and Generals"" may be a more ""realistic"" war film than ""Gone With the Wind"" (what wouldn't be?), but it's not nearly as entertaining.""Gods and Generals,"" which begins right after the firing on Fort Sumter and ends shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, is the first part of a planned trilogy.  Despite a handful of ""name"" players in the cast (Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels, Mira Sorvino and even Ted Turner in a ludicrous cameo appearance), writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell is unable to bring a single character in his film to convincing life (with the possible exception of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, who gets to carry the burden of what little drama the film has almost single-handedly).  In lieu of dialogue, the actors spend most of their time looking wistfully up to heaven or scanning the mist-shrouded horizon while delivering endless homilies about the rightness of the cause and the place of God in human affairs.  To keep it all palatable for more enlightened and egalitarian-minded modern audiences, the filmmakers are quick to have the Southern characters declare that, even though the South is forced to fight against the North to protect its God-given right to sovereignty, they, as individuals, are all personally opposed to slavery as an institution and firmly believe that their resident blacks will be freed someday as a matter of course.  Hell, the Northerners in this film seem more prejudiced against black people than the Southerners, who just can't say enough good things about their sycophantic slaves.The battle scenes, though well staged and appropriately graphic in nature, are strangely unmoving, primarily because we have no emotional stake in any of the characters we see doing the fighting.  Without anyone for us to focus on and care about, the audience becomes little more than curious bystanders, passive and unengaged observers of this brutal display of ritualized slaughter.  Although the visuals are splendid throughout, the musical score, except in a few places, is like a thick, heavy syrup poured over the entire film.By providing subtitled identification of the principal people, places, dates and battles, ""Gods and Generals"" does provide a service as a history lesson of sorts.  As a drama, however, the film is woefully lacking in every way imaginable.  ""Gods and Generals"" may thrill the heart of the diehard Civil War buff.  The rest of us will have to stick to our dreams of Scarlett and Rhett, and of a romanticized vision of the South that only a Golden Age Hollywood mogul would have dared come up with.",2,"Great visuals, but where's the drama?",1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,2968,"['**1/2', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'three-hour-and-49-minute', 'long', 'lesson', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'Grueling', 'plodding', 'film', 'almost', 'antithesis', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'films', 'are', 'epic', 'tales', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'defeated', 'South', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'earlier', 'film', 'been', 'essentially', 'drained', 'emotion', 'drama', 'characterization', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'war', 'film', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'not', 'nearly', 'entertaining', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'right', 'firing', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'shortly', 'Battle', 'Gettysburg', 'first', 'part', 'planned', 'trilogy', 'handful', 'name', 'players', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'even', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'ludicrous', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'writer/director', 'Ronald', 'F.', 'Maxwell', 'unable', 'bring', 'single', 'character', 'film', 'convincing', 'life', 'possible', 'exception', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'who', 'carry', 'burden', 'what', 'little', 'drama', 'film', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'lieu', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'looking', 'wistfully', 'heaven', 'scanning', 'mist-shrouded', 'horizon', 'delivering', 'endless', 'homilies', 'rightness', 'cause', 'place', 'God', 'human', 'affairs', 'keep', 'palatable', 'more', 'enlightened', 'egalitarian-minded', 'modern', 'audiences', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'quick', 'have', 'Southern', 'characters', 'declare', 'even', 'South', 'forced', 'fight', 'North', 'protect', 'God-given', 'right', 'sovereignty', 'individuals', 'are', 'personally', 'opposed', 'slavery', 'institution', 'firmly', 'believe', 'resident', 'blacks', 'will', 'be', 'freed', 'someday', 'matter', 'course', 'Hell', 'Northerners', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'prejudiced', 'black', 'people', 'Southerners', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'sycophantic', 'slaves.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'though', 'well', 'staged', 'appropriately', 'graphic', 'nature', 'are', 'strangely', 'unmoving', 'primarily', 'have', 'emotional', 'stake', 'characters', 'see', 'doing', 'fighting', 'anyone', 'focus', 'care', 'about', 'audience', 'little', 'more', 'curious', 'bystanders', 'passive', 'unengaged', 'observers', 'brutal', 'display', 'ritualized', 'slaughter', 'visuals', 'are', 'splendid', 'musical', 'score', 'few', 'places', 'thick', 'heavy', 'syrup', 'poured', 'entire', 'film.By', 'providing', 'subtitled', 'identification', 'principal', 'people', 'places', 'dates', 'battles', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'provide', 'service', 'history', 'lesson', 'sorts', 'drama', 'however', 'film', 'woefully', 'lacking', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'may', 'thrill', 'heart', 'diehard', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'rest', 'will', 'have', 'stick', 'dreams', 'Scarlett', 'Rhett', 'romanticized', 'vision', 'South', 'only', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'mogul', 'would', 'have', 'dared', 'come', 'up']",N/A

The 6 hour version, which I am really looking forward to, might come out in 2004.The battle scenes were awesome, especially Manassas and Fredericksburg, but to truly love a film, you must learn about and care for the characters.

Setliff,"[9, 15]","This film is a cinematic masterpiece and is a rare jewel given that Hollywood has been so apt to produce such unredeeming films these past few years. Actor Stephen Lang gives an inspiring and remarkable performance as General Thomas J. Jackson.  If he doesn't get an Oscar, it only proves the poor taste of the Hollywood wine-and-cheese set. Fittingly, Stonewall Jackson becomes the focal character of this film, which covers the earlier years of the War Between the States up to the time of his tragic death. This movie has drawn criticism chiefly from the amoral minority who scoff at the pious portrayals of Christian faith, chilvary and nobility in a time when character counted for something. The reviews are quite polarized obviously. The critics are chiefly limousine liberals, those who loathe southern culture and people smug enough to believe the 1988 film 'Glory' captured the essence of the war and the historicity of the Union cause. Also, I'm kind of tired of hearing how it is too southern in its perspective, which probably comes because the Confederates were winning the battles during the time this film was set. (I'm not going to scoff at 'Gettysburg' as being ""too northern"" merely because the Union takes the upper hand.)Anyway, Ron Maxwell has outdone himself with this film... it is quite a step up from Gettysburg; for the chief reason that the casting is better, the script is good and the cinematography is nothing short of a masterpiece.  There were some historical discrepencies like the two Irish brigades clashing. The soundtrack is beautiful.",5,Brilliant!

755913,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00009OOFA,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 0]","Gods and Generals has a running time of four hours. The length of the program may make it desirable for some people to plan to watch the film over two evenings. The first half of the film introduces us to the cast of characters, the Southern point of view for the Civil War, and some opening skirmishes. When the film begins we meet Colonel Robert E. Lee. He has a chance to take command of a large union army that will most likely have to march into Virginia. Lee declines the promotion saying that he will not fight against his friends and neighbors in Virginia. He is not for slavery or secession, but he is intensely loyal to his state and its people. When Virginia secedes from the Union, Lee becomes commander in chief of the confederate forces. More than simply an able commander, he is is revered and even loved by his men. Robert Duvall does a fine job bringing to life the quiet capability and humanity of General Lee.Gods and Generals is less about Lee and more about General Stonewall Jackson, a religious man who hates war, but when it is forced on him, he becomes totally committed to the Confederate cause. They named him right. Stonewall Jackson is most unlike a typical general. He is not afraid to put himself in harms way. His men respect and even idolize him for his willingness to lead by example. An intensely religious man, Jackson believes his fate has been predetermined. He will go to his heavenly home when God calls him and his place with the Lord is the better place to be. He loves his life and family, but he is not afraid to lose either of them. He believes his cause is just and all his will and energy is spent pursuing his goal to drive the invading Union Army from the south.In contrast, the Union Army is led by cautious men who think they can win battles from the rear in headquarters safe from harm. At Fredericksburg, for example, one of the major battles of the early war between the states, the Union generals send their troops into battle when they have little chance of succeeding. The Confederate army slaughters thousdands of hapless and badly led Union soldiers. Jackson takes no pleasure in seeing so many brave yankee soldiers die to no good purpose, but he remains committed to killing as many of the enemy as possible. While out at the front with his troops, Jackson is ambushed and seriously wounded. He dies and his loss is a disaster for the Confederacy.Gods and Generals moves slowly. History should not be rushed. Those viewers who wish to be introduced to the minds and hearts of Generals Lee and Jackson will not, I think, be disappointed. Through their eyes we see the best intentions of the men who fight for the Southern cause. From the distance of almost 150 years we have the chance to be objective and to try to understand how men of courage and integrity could fight for the southern cause.",5,Must see film about generals Lee and Jackson.,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2855,"['Gods', 'Generals', 'running', 'time', 'four', 'hours', 'length', 'program', 'may', 'make', 'desirable', 'people', 'plan', 'watch', 'film', 'two', 'evenings', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'cast', 'characters', 'Southern', 'point', 'view', 'Civil', 'War', 'opening', 'skirmishes', 'When', 'film', 'meet', 'Colonel', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'chance', 'take', 'command', 'large', 'union', 'army', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'march', 'Virginia', 'Lee', 'promotion', 'saying', 'will', 'not', 'fight', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'Virginia', 'not', 'slavery', 'secession', 'intensely', 'loyal', 'state', 'people', 'When', 'Virginia', 'Union', 'Lee', 'commander', 'chief', 'confederate', 'forces', 'More', 'simply', 'able', 'commander', 'revered', 'even', 'loved', 'men', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'quiet', 'capability', 'humanity', 'General', 'Lee.Gods', 'Generals', 'less', 'Lee', 'more', 'General', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'war', 'when', 'forced', 'totally', 'committed', 'Confederate', 'cause', 'named', 'right', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'most', 'typical', 'general', 'not', 'afraid', 'put', 'harms', 'way', 'men', 'respect', 'even', 'idolize', 'willingness', 'lead', 'example', 'intensely', 'religious', 'man', 'Jackson', 'fate', 'been', 'predetermined', 'will', 'go', 'heavenly', 'home', 'when', 'God', 'place', 'Lord', 'better', 'place', 'be', 'life', 'family', 'not', 'afraid', 'lose', 'cause', 'just', 'will', 'energy', 'spent', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'drive', 'invading', 'Union', 'Army', 'south.In', 'contrast', 'Union', 'Army', 'led', 'cautious', 'men', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'win', 'battles', 'rear', 'headquarters', 'safe', 'harm', 'Fredericksburg', 'example', 'one', 'major', 'battles', 'early', 'war', 'states', 'Union', 'generals', 'send', 'troops', 'battle', 'when', 'have', 'little', 'chance', 'succeeding', 'Confederate', 'army', 'slaughters', 'thousdands', 'hapless', 'badly', 'led', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'Jackson', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'brave', 'yankee', 'soldiers', 'die', 'good', 'purpose', 'committed', 'killing', 'many', 'enemy', 'possible', 'out', 'front', 'troops', 'Jackson', 'ambushed', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'loss', 'disaster', 'Confederacy.Gods', 'Generals', 'slowly', 'History', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'rushed', 'viewers', 'who', 'wish', 'be', 'introduced', 'minds', 'hearts', 'Generals', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'be', 'disappointed', 'eyes', 'see', 'best', 'intentions', 'men', 'who', 'fight', 'Southern', 'cause', 'distance', 'almost', '150', 'years', 'have', 'chance', 'be', 'objective', 'try', 'understand', 'how', 'men', 'courage', 'integrity', 'could', 'fight', 'southern', 'cause']",N/A

I am thinking the black cook was either too ignorant to know what was going on or that he was a dear friend to Stonewall Jackson who was clearly fighting a war for Southerns to have the &quot;freedom&quot; to enslave African Americans. In either instance I felt the need to use the dvd for a frisbee. I would seem that the director and screenplay writer wanted to play towards some nostalgia for the Southern Confederacy which I found just as nauseating.

Nailed his lines perfectly and looked the part.The remianing actors, far too many for me to list in this review played convincing parts and never seemed to upstage the others in the shot.Some of the digital effects, such as the far away shot of Fredericksburg and the Union Charge at Marye's Heights were not as sharp as I had wished but impressive none the less.Harper's Ferry was truly transformed into Fredericksburg, and if you're not from the area you may not even notice.The soldiers, both Union and Confederate were authentic and had a rugged harsh look to them.  I never noticed watch tan lines or traditional hair cuts.  Dennis Frye did an excellent job in going over the extras to ensure authenticity.Without going on and on, I will end this with stating that the movie was very energetic, authentic, and kept my attention and that of my wife for the entire play time.

755916,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B00009OOFA,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[1, 4]","Gods and Generals is the prequel movie to Gettysburg, but was filmed nearly ten years later. Many of the actors reprised their roles, but are obviously much older (and stouter) than in the first film.  Stephen Lang plays Stonewall Jackson in G&G; (he played Pickett in Gettysburg) so it seems odd to have the same actor play two different roles in both films, especially when viewed back to back. This movie is even more beautiful than the first movie, and the opening song by Mary Fahl is a work of art.The movie covers the civil war from the beginning to just before the battle of Gettysburg, and shows the story from both sides, as did Gettysburg. However, unlike the novel from which it is taken, the filmmaker threw all objectivity to the winds and slants the whole story in favor of the south, even going so far as to add dialog to the movie blaming the whole Civil War on the north. I found this revisionist view of history and lack of objectivity annoying and disturbing. However, if you are able to ignore this few bits, the movie is both beautiful and the story touching.Like ""Gettysburg"", the movie interweaves story lines telling the story of Northern and Southern soldiers, focusing mostly, on the northern side, on Colonel Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top, and on the Southern side, on the story of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, with the heavy emphasis on Jackson. General Jackson was, along with General Grant, one of the under-appreciated military geniuses of the Civil War. By the sheer force of his personality, which at some times seemed to border on insanity, drove his troops to perform miracles on the march and in the battlefield. Stephen Lang gives the character of Jackson life and believability that is often lacking from written accounts of his life.Unlike ""Gettysburg"", there is no extended edition of this movie, which is a pity because the previews and trailers of the movie show scenes, including one showing President Lincoln disembarking from a train at a rustic depot, that aren't included in the movie. Perhaps an extended edition of the film would have restored the missing balance of this movie.Because the movie tries to cover three years in less than three hours, it is unable to do justice to the original novel, as ""Gettysburg"" did. The production values are actually higher in this second movie. Sadly, due to the ten year delay between ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"", and due to poor promotion and marketing, and also due to the pro-Southern bias of this film, this movie did not fare so well at the box office and plans to film the third book in the trilogy were dropped. It's sad to think that we may never see a movie version of ""The Last Full Measure"" but, given the director's decision to blame the whole Civil War on the North, perhaps that isn't altogether a bad thing.",3,This movie annoyed me,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,2840,"['Gods', 'Generals', 'prequel', 'movie', 'Gettysburg', 'was', 'filmed', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Many', 'actors', 'reprised', 'roles', 'are', 'obviously', 'much', 'older', 'stouter', 'first', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'G', 'G', 'played', 'Pickett', 'Gettysburg', 'odd', 'have', 'same', 'actor', 'play', 'two', 'different', 'roles', 'films', 'especially', 'when', 'viewed', 'back', 'back', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'first', 'movie', 'opening', 'song', 'Mary', 'Fahl', 'work', 'art.The', 'movie', 'civil', 'war', 'beginning', 'just', 'battle', 'Gettysburg', 'story', 'sides', 'did', 'Gettysburg', 'However', 'novel', 'taken', 'filmmaker', 'threw', 'objectivity', 'winds', 'slants', 'whole', 'story', 'favor', 'south', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'add', 'dialog', 'movie', 'blaming', 'whole', 'Civil', 'War', 'north', 'found', 'revisionist', 'view', 'history', 'lack', 'objectivity', 'annoying', 'disturbing', 'However', 'are', 'able', 'ignore', 'few', 'bits', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Gettysburg', 'movie', 'story', 'lines', 'telling', 'story', 'Northern', 'Southern', 'soldiers', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'northern', 'side', 'Colonel', 'Chamberlain', 'hero', 'Little', 'Round', 'Top', 'Southern', 'side', 'story', 'General', 'Thomas', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'Jackson', 'General', 'Jackson', 'was', 'General', 'Grant', 'one', 'under-appreciated', 'military', 'geniuses', 'Civil', 'War', 'sheer', 'force', 'personality', 'times', 'seemed', 'border', 'insanity', 'drove', 'troops', 'perform', 'miracles', 'march', 'battlefield', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'character', 'Jackson', 'life', 'believability', 'often', 'lacking', 'written', 'accounts', 'life.Unlike', 'Gettysburg', 'extended', 'edition', 'movie', 'pity', 'previews', 'trailers', 'movie', 'show', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'showing', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'disembarking', 'train', 'rustic', 'depot', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'extended', 'edition', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'restored', 'missing', 'balance', 'movie.Because', 'movie', 'cover', 'three', 'years', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'unable', 'do', 'justice', 'original', 'novel', 'Gettysburg', 'did', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'actually', 'higher', 'second', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'due', 'ten', 'year', 'delay', 'Gettysburg', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'due', 'poor', 'promotion', 'marketing', 'also', 'due', 'pro-Southern', 'bias', 'film', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'plans', 'film', 'third', 'book', 'trilogy', 'were', 'dropped', 'sad', 'think', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'Last', 'Full', 'Measure', 'given', 'director', 'decision', 'blame', 'whole', 'Civil', 'War', 'North', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

So I couldn't help but be disappointed when the promised dance-and-song number never materialized.  Or maybe it did toward the end; I walked out after about an hour and a half, a first for me.Gods and Generals suffers from a ridiculously selective view of history, betraying a virulent political bias.  But this would be forgivable, if the movie succeeded as entertainment; it does not.  The aforementioned over-the-top music, along with poor editing, stilted dialogue, and caricature accents, conspire to make it basically unwatchable.  The language, in particular, is the most surprising disappointment.  There was a great opportunity here to portray a rich spoken Civil War vernacular.  Unfortunately, someone decided to have the characters speak as if they were reading proclamations all the time.  It actually might even have succeeded, had they taken it further in that direction, into (say) completely stylized rhyming couplets.

It's difficult to see why this filmathon was needed as a sandwich between Gettysburg and The Killer Angels (yes, they'll be making a movie out of the book, again!)Reviewers in-the-know here seem to be bothered by the ""Southern point of view"" but in my mind that's the least of G&G;'s worries. One could argue that the film whitewashes slavery (no pun intended) and offers apologetics in the place of facts -- when a character makes a racist or insensitive comment he's always wearing a blue uniform, and there are essentially just two fawning slaves.No, the film's pains are much graver. Unlike Gettysburg which focused on 3 days of actual war, G&G; casts its net wide and far. I'm sure it is impeccably accurate from an historical perspective, but in his attempt to be accurate about the sensitive subject matter, the director here seemed to have overextended himself. The result is sloppy, rambling, and poorly paced.There are times when everything even grinds to a complete halt. The Irish soldier and the cook are dead weight, and Stonewall's wife is another aspect we could do without. Robet Duvall plays a minor role, that is a big mistake. The battles scenes are just uninspired and morose.

755919,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00009OOFA,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[48, 58]","Gods & Generals is  a film of epic proportions, but this film proves that epic proportions does not equate to an epic film.  I enjoyed the film and much of the acting was superb, but as a whole, it did not meet the mark set by its sequel of 1993, ""Gettysburg.""The center-piece of this film is General Stonewall Jackson and the faith-filled romance with his wife, who he affectionately refers to as his ""esposita.""Stephen Lang's performance as the devout Christian and fearless general is stupendous.  You soon forget you're watching a performance and begin to think of yourself as a voyeur in his life. The film's greatest strength is the emotional bond the viewer develops with his character.Sadly, this connection falters with the rest of the historic characters. They are interesting to be sure, but the film fails to create the bond with the viewer and these other historic figures.Some scenes will be a total loss to those who are not students of history or the Civil War. Relationships are not explained between some soldiers and generals... you are told they ""have their differences,"" but are never told why, making the mention of them inconsequential to the average movie goer.The battle scenes are as close to non-violent as battlescenes can get. You hear the ripping of the wind as the musket balls fly through the air and you see body after body fall, but you don't see body parts explode... just explosions of dirt as cannon-balls fly and a body gets thrown in the air. The sound and music allow the viewer to be intensely involved in the battle, without the added gore. This is both a plus and a minus. It makes it a family-friendly film - no foul language and a modicum of violence. In reality, of course, the Civil War was a bloody, violent war and those seeking a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level of realism will not be satisfied in that department.With such a stellar cast and a beautiful backdrop, the producers really dropped the ball in the CGI department. The computer graphics used to simulate the towns and battlescenes were simply awful, especially by today's standards.The bird's eye views of villages/towns looked like blurry (very blurry) Thomas Kinkaid paintings... to add ""realism"" they added painted animated flocking birds that looked as though they were cut from a 1930's Bela Lagosi ""Dracula"" movie. Very, very, very crude animation that was unnecessary and distracting.  The explosions from afar on the battlefields were also very sub-par. They looked like the default explosion effect available in Adobe After Effects version 1.0. Just crude and unbelievable - they were not the same shade, color or tone of the surrounding scenes and no attempt was made to blend the effects w/ the previously filmed action.In addition to the very poor CGI effects, the use and re-use of the same scenes was obvious to the viewer. In one part of the movie, you would see villagers fleeing down a d particular path. Thirty  minutes later, you'd meet a new character and then see them for the second time running down the same path in the same scene. Because the camera angle had not changed, it was very obvious they were identical scenes. This happened a number of times during battle scenes as well where the same exact canon would cause the same exact explosion where the same unknown actor would fly through the air to his death.These goof-ups not-withstanding, this is a truly enjoyable film and safe for families to view. Civil War buffs will be swept away by the historic accuracy, on-location filming and historic buildings and uniforms.Non-historians who view the film will probably be distracted by the wooden acting of ""Seventh Heaven"" star Jeremy London or the cheesy animation previously cited, but should still find the overall movie-going experience to be a positive one.",4,Gods & Generals,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,3799,"['Gods', 'Generals', 'film', 'epic', 'proportions', 'film', 'epic', 'proportions', 'not', 'equate', 'epic', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'whole', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'mark', 'set', 'sequel', '1993', 'Gettysburg', 'center-piece', 'film', 'General', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'faith-filled', 'romance', 'wife', 'who', 'affectionately', 'esposita', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'performance', 'devout', 'Christian', 'fearless', 'general', 'stupendous', 'soon', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'performance', 'begin', 'think', 'voyeur', 'life', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'emotional', 'bond', 'viewer', 'character.Sadly', 'connection', 'rest', 'historic', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'create', 'bond', 'viewer', 'other', 'historic', 'figures.Some', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'total', 'loss', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'students', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'Relationships', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'soldiers', 'generals', 'are', 'told', 'have', 'differences', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'why', 'making', 'mention', 'inconsequential', 'average', 'movie', 'goer.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'close', 'non-violent', 'battlescenes', 'can', 'get', 'hear', 'ripping', 'wind', 'musket', 'balls', 'fly', 'air', 'see', 'body', 'body', 'fall', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'body', 'parts', 'explode', 'just', 'explosions', 'dirt', 'cannon-balls', 'fly', 'body', 'thrown', 'air', 'sound', 'music', 'allow', 'viewer', 'be', 'intensely', 'involved', 'battle', 'added', 'gore', 'plus', 'minus', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'foul', 'language', 'modicum', 'violence', 'reality', 'course', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'bloody', 'violent', 'war', 'seeking', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'level', 'realism', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'satisfied', 'department.With', 'stellar', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'producers', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'CGI', 'department', 'computer', 'graphics', 'used', 'simulate', 'towns', 'battlescenes', 'were', 'simply', 'awful', 'especially', 'today', 'standards.The', 'bird', 'eye', 'views', 'villages/towns', 'looked', 'blurry', 'very', 'blurry', 'Thomas', 'Kinkaid', 'paintings', 'add', 'realism', 'added', 'painted', 'animated', 'flocking', 'birds', 'looked', 'were', 'cut', '1930', 'Bela', 'Lagosi', 'Dracula', 'movie', 'Very', 'very', 'very', 'crude', 'animation', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'explosions', 'afar', 'battlefields', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'sub-par', 'looked', 'default', 'explosion', 'effect', 'available', 'Adobe', 'Effects', 'version', '1.0', 'Just', 'crude', 'unbelievable', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'shade', 'color', 'tone', 'surrounding', 'scenes', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'blend', 'effects', 'w/', 'previously', 'filmed', 'action.In', 'addition', 'very', 'poor', 'CGI', 'effects', 'use', 're-use', 'same', 'scenes', 'was', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'see', 'villagers', 'fleeing', 'down', 'd', 'particular', 'path', 'Thirty', 'minutes', 'later', ""'d"", 'meet', 'new', 'character', 'then', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'running', 'down', 'same', 'path', 'same', 'scene', 'camera', 'angle', 'had', 'not', 'changed', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'were', 'identical', 'scenes', 'happened', 'number', 'times', 'battle', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'same', 'exact', 'canon', 'would', 'cause', 'same', 'exact', 'explosion', 'where', 'same', 'unknown', 'actor', 'would', 'fly', 'air', 'death.These', 'goof-ups', 'not-withstanding', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'safe', 'families', 'view', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'will', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'on-location', 'filming', 'historic', 'buildings', 'uniforms.Non-historians', 'who', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'distracted', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'star', 'Jeremy', 'London', 'cheesy', 'animation', 'previously', 'cited', 'should', 'still', 'find', 'overall', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'be', 'positive', 'one']",N/A

The novel is fantastic, as good or even better than ""The Killer Angels,"" which won the Pulitzer Prize. I liked ""Gettysburg,"" the film adaptation of ""The Killer Angels."" It was long and preachy, but it was faithful to the source material so it's excesses were forgiveable. Maxwell didn't want to leave anything out.In this film, however, he leaves a lot out. He very nearly abandons the source material completely. He couldn't decide what kind of film to make. At times it seems he wanted a film biography of Stonewall Jackson. That would have been fine by me. Jackson is one of the more interesting characters in our country's history. Stephen Lang is surprisingly good in the role. He seemed to ""get"" Jackson's quirky character.But Maxwell sacrificed a great deal of the book to put in ludicrous subplots featuring fictional characters. In his attempt to humanize the south, he went too far. The film is about a war. Suffice to say, there's plenty of potential for action scenes. So there was no need to include what was basically a Civil War-era car chase scene, as a fictional family flees the bombardment of Fredericksburg in a horse-drawn wagon. And the scenes fleshing out Stonewall's friendship with his slave cook are laugh-out loud funny.So here we have a four-hour movie about the first two years about the Civil War and ... no battle of Antietam. The single bloodiest day in the history of American warfare and Maxwell ... skips it! He sacrificed the biggest battle scene of all to include politically correct revionist filler.And there's a long scene where the Confederate soldiers celebrate at a jamboree. The scene slows down an already slow movie, but it had to go in the final cut, because Ted Turner has a cameo in it.Maxwell is adapting the final book of the trilogy, ""The Last Full Measure.""

It is historically accurate, well written, well filmed, and well acted.Robert Duvall in particular struck me for his excellent portrayal of Robert E. Lee, as did Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain; the other actors were quite good too. As some other reviewers have mentioned, Stephen Lang is superb as well. The talent of these three actors really comes out here.I loved the script as well. I think they did a good job being fair to both sides and the motivations of all the characters, staying relatively true to the book (although some stuff had to be cut of course), and being historically accurate.In spite of being a very long movie, the film never drags. In response to those that think that this movie is ""too long,"" I seriously wonder about the American attention span these days. In an era of sound bites, it's refreshing to see a movie that takes time to actually tell a story. No, this isn't an action flick, and criticizing it for not being one is like criticizing a horse for not flying.This movie is not the least bit boring; rather, it does a great job making history come alive. A lot of people who have had bad history classes inflicted on them think that history is just about memorizing a bunch of names and dates and spitting them back on a test; if this describes you, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.This movie is, as I have said, a historically accurate and engaging and earns my whole-hearted recommendation.",5,Superb film on many levels,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,1484,"['very', 'high-quality', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'filmed', 'well', 'acted.Robert', 'Duvall', 'particular', 'struck', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'did', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'too', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'talent', 'three', 'actors', 'really', 'out', 'here.I', 'loved', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'fair', 'sides', 'motivations', 'characters', 'staying', 'relatively', 'true', 'book', 'stuff', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'course', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate.In', 'spite', 'being', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'film', 'never', 'response', 'think', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'American', 'attention', 'days', 'era', 'sound', 'bites', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'time', 'actually', 'tell', 'story', 'No', ""n't"", 'action', 'flick', 'criticizing', 'not', 'being', 'one', 'criticizing', 'horse', 'not', 'flying.This', 'movie', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'boring', 'rather', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'history', 'come', 'alive', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'history', 'classes', 'inflicted', 'think', 'history', 'just', 'memorizing', 'bunch', 'names', 'dates', 'spitting', 'back', 'test', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'have', 'said', 'historically', 'accurate', 'engaging', 'earns', 'whole-hearted', 'recommendation']",N/A

755934,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,B00009OOFA,Theo Logos,"[5, 15]","As a life-long student of the Civil War, I wanted and expected to like this movie. Yet when it screened at a local theater, I found it so boring that I left the theater at the intermission. This week, I picked it up on DVD at my library to give it a second chance, and this time, I managed to watch all the way through. Unfortunately, my original opinion of it was only verified. Its problems are legion, but its greatest sin is that it was unable to infuse any passion or drama into the single most passionate and dramatic chapter of American history.There are three major battle scenes in the movie - First Manassas (Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. These scenes are long; a significant section of the movie, yet they are so totally lacking in realism and emotional believability that I was never able to suspend disbelief and imagine that I was viewing real combat. Instead, they never appeared as anything other than what they were - pageants put on by re-enactors, who obviously enjoy what they do, but lack the acting skill to deliver the necessary emotional realism, and lack the budget to deliver anything close to the physical reality of battle. (With the exception of a few cannon hit shots, most of the casualties of battle look no more realistic than kid's games of war where they simply drop to the ground to play dead when shot.) The movie's orchestral score played almost constantly behind the battle scenes, further removing them from any semblance of actuality. The post-battle hospital scenes also lacked anything approaching realism. Here, instead of showing the chaotic, hellish cauldrons of screams and carnage, the movie gave us only quite, almost orderly scenes where speeches could be delivered over the dead and dying.Had the rest of the movie been engaging in any way, I might have been able to forgive the unrealistic, non-believable battle scenes. It, however, failed on all counts. There is almost no real dialogue in this movie. Instead, the actors deliver speeches to each other, like lines memorized for a Passion play. Scenes that should have been electric with passion, such as when the students at Virginia Military Institute struck the Stars and Stripes to raise the Stars and Bars, and when the Virginia Council called for leaving the Union never appear to be more than play-acting, and lack any sense of realism or true passion. At no point did I feel that this movie pulled me into its reality - it always left me feeling that I was watching a second-rate play.The acting ranged from understated, to bad, to non-existent. Robert Duvall played Robert E. Lee as the ""marble man"", restrained and reserved. This may have worked if he had been surrounded with other, more animated actors. He was not, and as such, delivered the only performance of a great career that I found boring. Jeff Daniels was considerably less effective in his reprised role of Joshua Chamberlain than he was in the movie Gettysburg. Indeed, considering that the bulk of the movie was delivered from a Southern perspective, it would probably have been stronger if the character of Chamberlain and the small amount of screen time given to the Union point of view had been eliminated all-together. Stephen Lang's Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson actually had a few moments of passion, and if not limited by a stilted script, might have been able to deliver a fine performance. As it was, much of his screen time sank to the level of the rest of the movie. The actor who played the dashing cavalier J.E.B. Stuart was almost totally lacking in verve, dash or flamboyance, and the man who played the gallant, young General Sam Hood, a man barely past 30 years old, appeared to be in his late 50s. No other roles even rise to be worthy of mention.The two stars that I do give this movie are because of its general historical accuracy, both in its portrayal of events, and its look and feel. Also, the story line of Thomas Jackson showed promise that while unfulfilled, was a worthy attempt to capture the totality of an enigmatic and complex man. (It may have been a better movie had it concentrated wholly on Jackson's story, rather than trying for a broader sweep.)This movie was too long, too stilted, and too poorly cast and acted. It never managed to engage the viewer in its reality, or rise above the level of a particularly complex re-enactment. It was a tremendous disappointment, and I cannot recommend it on any level.Theo Logos",2,"Glorified Re-enactment, lacking passion and realism",1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,4452,"['life-long', 'student', 'Civil', 'War', 'wanted', 'expected', 'like', 'movie', 'when', 'screened', 'local', 'theater', 'found', 'so', 'boring', 'left', 'theater', 'intermission', 'week', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'library', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'time', 'managed', 'watch', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'original', 'opinion', 'was', 'only', 'verified', 'problems', 'are', 'legion', 'greatest', 'sin', 'was', 'unable', 'infuse', 'passion', 'drama', 'single', 'most', 'passionate', 'dramatic', 'chapter', 'American', 'are', 'three', 'major', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'First', 'Manassas', 'Bull', 'Run', 'Fredericksburg', 'Chancellorsville', 'scenes', 'are', 'long', 'significant', 'section', 'movie', 'yet', 'are', 'so', 'totally', 'lacking', 'realism', 'emotional', 'believability', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'imagine', 'was', 'viewing', 'real', 'combat', 'Instead', 'never', 'appeared', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'were', 'pageants', 'put', 're-enactors', 'who', 'obviously', 'enjoy', 'what', 'do', 'lack', 'acting', 'skill', 'deliver', 'necessary', 'emotional', 'realism', 'lack', 'budget', 'deliver', 'anything', 'close', 'physical', 'reality', 'battle', 'exception', 'few', 'cannon', 'hit', 'shots', 'most', 'casualties', 'battle', 'look', 'more', 'realistic', 'kid', 'games', 'war', 'where', 'simply', 'drop', 'ground', 'play', 'dead', 'when', 'shot', 'movie', 'orchestral', 'score', 'played', 'almost', 'constantly', 'battle', 'scenes', 'further', 'removing', 'semblance', 'actuality', 'post-battle', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'also', 'lacked', 'anything', 'approaching', 'realism', 'Here', 'instead', 'showing', 'chaotic', 'hellish', 'cauldrons', 'screams', 'carnage', 'movie', 'gave', 'only', 'quite', 'almost', 'orderly', 'scenes', 'where', 'speeches', 'could', 'be', 'delivered', 'dead', 'dying.Had', 'rest', 'movie', 'been', 'engaging', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'forgive', 'unrealistic', 'non-believable', 'battle', 'scenes', 'however', 'failed', 'counts', 'almost', 'real', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Instead', 'actors', 'deliver', 'speeches', 'other', 'lines', 'memorized', 'Passion', 'play', 'Scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'electric', 'passion', 'such', 'when', 'students', 'Virginia', 'Military', 'Institute', 'struck', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'raise', 'Stars', 'Bars', 'when', 'Virginia', 'Council', 'called', 'leaving', 'Union', 'never', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'play-acting', 'lack', 'sense', 'realism', 'true', 'passion', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'movie', 'pulled', 'reality', 'always', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'second-rate', 'play.The', 'acting', 'ranged', 'understated', 'bad', 'non-existent', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'played', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'marble', 'man', 'restrained', 'reserved', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'been', 'surrounded', 'other', 'more', 'animated', 'actors', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'delivered', 'only', 'performance', 'great', 'career', 'found', 'boring', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'was', 'considerably', 'less', 'effective', 'reprised', 'role', 'Joshua', 'Chamberlain', 'was', 'movie', 'Gettysburg', 'Indeed', 'considering', 'bulk', 'movie', 'was', 'delivered', 'Southern', 'perspective', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'character', 'Chamberlain', 'small', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Union', 'point', 'view', 'had', 'been', 'eliminated', 'all-together', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Thomas', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'actually', 'had', 'few', 'moments', 'passion', 'not', 'limited', 'stilted', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performance', 'was', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'sank', 'level', 'rest', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'dashing', 'cavalier', 'J.E.B', 'Stuart', 'was', 'almost', 'totally', 'lacking', 'verve', 'dash', 'flamboyance', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'gallant', 'young', 'General', 'Sam', 'Hood', 'man', 'barely', 'past', '30', 'years', 'old', 'appeared', 'be', 'late', '50s', 'other', 'roles', 'even', 'rise', 'be', 'worthy', 'mention.The', 'two', 'stars', 'do', 'give', 'movie', 'are', 'general', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'portrayal', 'events', 'look', 'feel', 'Also', 'story', 'line', 'Thomas', 'Jackson', 'showed', 'promise', 'unfulfilled', 'was', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'capture', 'totality', 'enigmatic', 'complex', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'concentrated', 'wholly', 'Jackson', 'story', 'rather', 'trying', 'broader', 'sweep', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'stilted', 'too', 'poorly', 'cast', 'acted', 'never', 'managed', 'engage', 'viewer', 'reality', 'rise', 'level', 'particularly', 'complex', 're-enactment', 'was', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'level.Theo', 'Logos']",N/A
755935,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B00009OOFA,The Seeker,"[1, 2]","""Gods and Generals"" is a war film from 2003 that was directed by Ron Maxwell and produced by Ted Turner. The movie is about the American Civil War and stars Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, and Robert Duvall. The film is also based off a novel of the same name written by Jeff Shaara. Finally, the film is a prequel to the 1993 film ""Gettysburg""""Gods and Generals"" is extremely detailed and very historically accurate. Ted Turner spent top dollar to make ""Gods and Generals"" as real as possible and he did an excellent job. Based on many of the American Civil War history books I've read and photos I've seen of life in the 1860's, I believe if you would like to know what life was like in the United States of America during the 1860's, *this* is the ideal film to see. Even little details the average viewer may not even notice is included in the movie.The battle scenes, the instrumental soundtrack and the scenery is absolutely amazing. I own the soundtrack to this movie and it is a pure joy to listen to. Especially when I am walking early in the morning. The music is so beautiful. It's litreally hard to describe. It's like listening to sounds from Heaven if Heaven exists.As far as the story goes - We see things from the point of view of various characters. The two main ones being Confederate General ""Stonewall"" Jackson and Yankee college professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain who joins the U.S. Army in 1862.I think that ""Gods and Generals"" is a great movie. My ONLY complaints about it is that we did not get to see things from the Union's point of view enough in my personal and humble opinion. i.e. How Northern Civilians reacted to the war and the men in blue preparing for it. Also, not all southerner's desired to secede from the U.S.A.. Quite a few did not actually, and I wish the movie could have focused on that issue some.Again, the film focus's on Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the unit Chamberlain joins (The Twentieth Maine) for the most part when showing the audience the point of view of the Federal troops which I enjoyed a lot. I think one of the reasons why many rebels believed it would be a short war is because they knew quite a lot of them were real tough and rough outdoorsy guys and they thought Northern men were stuck up, rich boys from the big cities who didn't know how to fire a gun or knew anything about horses and other animals and therefore they wouldn't stand a chance against them.....Little did they realize that many, *many* men up North were also gentlemen of nature too that came from the mountains, woods, swamps, and other rural areas and *did* know how to fire a gun, knew quite a lot about horses and animals, as well as the outdoors. They hunted, fished, had farms, and lived off the land too, and were fighting in the war out of love for their country. I believe that is the case with many of the men in the Twentieth Maine and the film teaches people that.That is one of the many things history films are all about. Not just telling you what you already know, but teaching as well. By including Chamberlain and a storyline for the Union, director Ron Maxwell was able to teach an audience of mostly neo-rebels about a subject that they themselves would probably never bother to learn themselves because some of them may not be interested in the other side of things unless it supports what they already believe. If Chamberlain was not apart of this movie, it would have just been another Hollywood Neo-Reb film. I think it's good that this movie tried to be fair.Since I first saw the film ""Gettysburg"" when I was a kid, I have been fascinated with Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. I also became a huge Jeff Daniels fan as a result of his performance as Chamberlain and I was happy to see him reunite with actors C. Thomas Howell and Kevin Conway in ""Gods and Generals"". The three worked together in ""Gettysburg"" and I really loved that trio in that film and it was great seeing them together again.I know many of the U.S. soldiers at that time cared more about preserving Union then ending slavery, but I'm also glad Chamberlain was of the men who not only desired to keep this great country together, but also had a deep desire to end slavery.I'm sure this film attracted many people who are sympathetic towards the Confederacy. Hopefully all of those people were open-minded enough to learn more about the Northern side of things when Jeff Daniels was on screen and that they had a better understanding of why some Union soldiers were fighting in the war.I watched this film because I am a huge American Civil War history buff. I think in order to really enjoy this film you too have to be an American Civil War history buff. Even if you're not, check it out anyhow please if you have not seen it, and feed your mind some. :)All and all, the film is well-acted, visually beautiful, has a great soundtrack, and is historically accurate.Cons: Too many rebels. Not enough Yankees. :-)The Bottom Line: This film is like a live-action history book. :) It is a must see for anyone who enjoys history and/or is looking to get educated.",5,One of the best American

755938,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,B00009OOFA,Thomas Moody,"[6, 9]","There is, I suppose, two schools of thought when viewing these historical semi-documentary films. One is to watch it for the entertainment value and disregard the historical accuracy. Gods and Generals, I'll admit, does succeed as an entertaining film even with the almost four hour duration and should be appealing to non-history (read non-Civil War) buffs. The other school is, of course, the historian's perspective and how the film realistically (or not) paints the subject matter. Here, Gods and Generals fails terribly on many levels and made the movie for me a somewhat major disappointment.The only real redeeming value in this work is the battle scenes. When a film's producers take the time and trouble to try to accurately depict major Civil War struggles such as First Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville on the actual battlefields (although the jury is still out in my mind as to whether the Fredericksburg battlfield shown is real or computer enhanced) they get my attention. The battle action shown is somewhat accurate although the producers greatly needed to ""set-up"" each battle...it's easy for the Civil War buff to understand the charge and counter charge of Henry House Hill at Manassas or the importance and relevancy of Stonewall Jackson's flanking march around the Federal right flank at Chancellorsville, but the general viewer is left to assume that what is shown is how it was and this detracts from the quality of the film in my view.Another downside to this film is the portrayal of Stonewall Jackson...if the producer's intent was to have this as a biographical work, then they should have advertised it as such and let the prospective movie-goer discern whether to see it or not. And if it was the intent, then they've failed miserably. Stephen Lang portrays Jackson not at all like the Jackson thats depicted in the history books...the real Jackson was extremely eccentric (he would occasionally suck on a lemon during a battle), aloof (subordinates never knew where they were headed or why) and very unkempt. The Lang version shows him as clean, warm, personable...almost omnipotent. Nowhere do we see the independant Jackson of Cedar Mountain or the Jackson who pouted so badly during the Peninsula Campaign that he slept under a tree during the critical maneuvers to the Gaines Mill battlefield. These were extremely important components of his character and should have been given equal billing.Another inexcusable omission...how in God's name can any film that portrays the early portions of the Civil War not include George McClellan, the afore mentioned Peninsula Campaign and (the almost criminal omission) the battle at Antietam?? Perhaps the producers could have taken some of the time spent on the contrived scenes like the Confederates singing around the Christmas tree or the ridiculously idealistic conversations that every person (important or not) seemed to have to show these important battles. It would have succeeded in making the film the requisite four hours and would have greatly enhanced the quality of the movie.The movie ""Gettysburg"" had some of these flaws, but the over-riding virtue of that classic film was the driving intensity and dogged adherence to the standard history that made it stand out. Sadly, Gods and Generals seemed to concentrate too much on the ""atmosphere"" and lost the big picture because of it. I have not as yet read Jeff Shaara's book that this film was based on, but I'll bet that it was much better organized and much truer to history's version of the initiation of the Civil War.",2,Weighed down by irrelevency and pretentiousness...,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,3575,"['suppose', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'when', 'viewing', 'historical', 'semi-documentary', 'films', 'One', 'watch', 'entertainment', 'value', 'disregard', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Gods', 'Generals', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'succeed', 'entertaining', 'film', 'even', 'almost', 'four', 'hour', 'duration', 'should', 'be', 'appealing', 'non-history', 'read', 'non-Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'other', 'school', 'course', 'historian', 'perspective', 'how', 'film', 'realistically', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'Here', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'terribly', 'many', 'levels', 'made', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'major', 'disappointment.The', 'only', 'real', 'redeeming', 'value', 'work', 'battle', 'scenes', 'When', 'film', 'producers', 'take', 'time', 'trouble', 'try', 'accurately', 'depict', 'major', 'Civil', 'War', 'struggles', 'such', 'First', 'Manassas', 'Fredericksburg', 'Chancellorsville', 'actual', 'battlefields', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'mind', 'Fredericksburg', 'battlfield', 'shown', 'real', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'get', 'attention', 'battle', 'action', 'shown', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'producers', 'greatly', 'needed', 'set-up', 'battle', 'easy', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'understand', 'charge', 'counter', 'charge', 'Henry', 'House', 'Hill', 'Manassas', 'importance', 'relevancy', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'flanking', 'march', 'Federal', 'right', 'flank', 'Chancellorsville', 'general', 'viewer', 'left', 'assume', 'what', 'shown', 'how', 'was', 'quality', 'film', 'view.Another', 'downside', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'producer', 'intent', 'was', 'have', 'biographical', 'work', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'advertised', 'such', 'let', 'prospective', 'movie-goer', 'discern', 'see', 'not', 'was', 'intent', 'then', ""'ve"", 'failed', 'miserably', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Jackson', 'not', 'Jackson', 'thats', 'depicted', 'history', 'books', 'real', 'Jackson', 'was', 'extremely', 'eccentric', 'would', 'occasionally', 'suck', 'lemon', 'battle', 'aloof', 'never', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'headed', 'why', 'very', 'unkempt', 'Lang', 'version', 'clean', 'warm', 'personable', 'almost', 'omnipotent', 'Nowhere', 'do', 'see', 'independant', 'Jackson', 'Cedar', 'Mountain', 'Jackson', 'who', 'pouted', 'so', 'badly', 'Peninsula', 'Campaign', 'slept', 'tree', 'critical', 'maneuvers', 'Gaines', 'Mill', 'battlefield', 'were', 'extremely', 'important', 'components', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'equal', 'billing.Another', 'inexcusable', 'omission', 'how', 'God', 'name', 'can', 'film', 'early', 'portions', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'include', 'George', 'McClellan', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'Peninsula', 'Campaign', 'almost', 'criminal', 'omission', 'battle', 'Antietam', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'spent', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'Confederates', 'singing', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ridiculously', 'idealistic', 'conversations', 'person', 'important', 'not', 'seemed', 'have', 'show', 'important', 'battles', 'would', 'have', 'succeeded', 'making', 'film', 'requisite', 'four', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'quality', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'Gettysburg', 'had', 'flaws', 'over-riding', 'virtue', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'driving', 'intensity', 'dogged', 'adherence', 'standard', 'history', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Sadly', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'seemed', 'concentrate', 'too', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'lost', 'big', 'picture', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'Jeff', 'Shaara', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'organized', 'much', 'truer', 'history', 'version', 'initiation', 'Civil', 'War']",N/A

Oh the South was so noble and if only the darn Union had more patience slavery would have ended just fine in a few generations. They even get the actor who played Lieutenant Burrell as the black slave who totally admires Stonewall Jackson and can say that the South is just fighting for their homes. This kind of racist historical revisionism might have had its place at one point in history (Woodrow Wilson was a famously pro-Southern politician) but in the 21st century, it just sounds like the patently false public relations that it has always been (similar to South African tourism commercials from the age of Apartheid which tried to convince people that everyone except for a few malcontents was just fine with the system.) The fact that Southerners fought for a century in order to preserve Jim Crow laws, the notion that they were totally not racist and just fighting for their homes is an insult to historians and people with actual brain cells.Sadly, the terrible politics does not even begin to describe the awfulness of this movie. There is not one natural scene that is allowed to breathe. Instead, the entire movie is an exercise in bombast with stilted acting styles (which can be blamed on the director since these are mostly great actors), pompous music that is supposed to take the place of missing emotion, bloodless battles (yes, those Civil War re-enactors can sure move in formation - too bad they can't convey any amount of pathos, fear or emotions that would make anything think that they were anything but men playing a game) and the speeches - the terrible boring speeches.Underlying all of the pomposity and tedium is the effort to get everything ""right"" but like Watchmen, the movie gets the look and misses the point. Many of the speeches in the movie are taken from historical records; however, many of the historical records were written as hagiography in order to depict the generals as far more noble than they actually were. The battle re-enactments are simply there to show off that the people know the tactics and the moves - without ever depicting the fact that people were dying and getting infected and losing limbs and trying to get away.This is a long and wearisome movie that was cynically made to appeal to the Civil War buff and no one else.

755941,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00009OOFA,T O'Brien,"[11, 18]","Gods and Generals tells the story of the first two years of the Civil War leading up to the battle of Gettysburg. Based on the novel by Jeff Shaara, the film shows both sides of the war although overall it is probably tipped more to the south. Stephen Lang, who played General Pickett in Gettysburg, is excellent here as General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the famous Confederate leader. Jeff Daniels returns as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. His role is not nearly as large as the previous film although his scenes are well played. Robert E. Lee is now portrayed by Robert Duvall rather than Martin Sheen. Duvall is much more believable as Lee than Sheen was.Gods and Generals does have its holes but overall it is an excellent picture. The battle scenes are beautifully put together with some computer generated scenes inserted, especially at the battle of Fredericksburg. The surprise attack on the Federal camp at Chancellorsville is one of the best scenes in the whole movie. People who have seen Gettysburg will recognize many faces who return in their roles as well as many returnees who take different parts. Ted Turner makes another appearance as a Confederate colonel during a sing along for the leaders of the Confederate army. Kevin Conway and C. Thomas Howell return as Buster Kilrain and Tom Chamberlain in excellent performances.Gods and Generals is an excellent historical epic that keeps the audience interested. A downfall of the movie may be that it tries to do to much. Unlike Gettysburg where only four days had to be covered, Generals has to cover over two years of material leaving some things by the wayside. However the movie is still excellent with great battle scenes, performances and also a good musical score.

755942,A176IA89VGH46M,B00009OOFA,Todd Bovair,"[11, 15]","... That's what I thought after viewing Gods & Generals. To followup a masterpiece like Gettysburg with this mess is a travesty. Sadly, because of Gods & Generals' terrible box office performance, we will never see the conclusion to the Shaara Civil War trilogy onscreen. Anyhow, here are some things you may wish to know about this film:Gods & Generals the movie is based on the book by Jeff Shaara. His father Michael wrote The Killer Angels, which the movie Gettysburg was based on. Jeff wrote the book as a prequel to The Killer Angels, then he wrote The Last Full Measure, which is a sequel to The Killer Angels (thus forming a Shaara trilogy). After the success of Gettysburg, a low budget made-for-television affair, Ted Turner decided to go all out and produce a HUGE budget follow up. The obvious choice was Gods & Generals.Now, here's where things get interesting, as Gods & Generals follows a strange pattern that Hollywood has developed. When ever a followup is given a larger budget, larger scale, etc, that film is always MUCH worse than the original cheaply made film! Typical of bloated Hollywood. Gods & Generals had a MUCH larger budget than Gettysburg, it had more production time allowed, it had more expensive sets, a more expensive cast, more of EVERYTHING, and it is a MESS of a movie. Not only is it boring, it is long winded, not well acted, not well choreographed, and incredibly disappointing. How did things go so terribly wrong?!First and foremost, I feel I must mention Steven Lang's performance as Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. The real life Jackson was a VERY odd man, because he had strange quirks to his personality (like covering himself with icewater soaked cloths every morning), some strange beliefs (like he had to stand so his internal organs would be 'properly stacked'), and an INCREDIBLY intense zeal for battle, which he (oddly enough) attributed to his DEEP, DEEP Christian religious convictions. All of this is well known to Civil War historians. However, Lang seems to focus soley on Jackson's oddities, almost as if it was the definition of the man. Jackson had quirks and oddities, but these were just that: QUIRKS and ODDITIES. They were NOT Jackson's whole being, as Lang's portrayal would lead us to believe. The portrayal is so over the top as to be a parody, and Lang's average acting makes it just that much worse. (as a side note, Lang quite deftly portrayed George Pickett in Gettysburg. Here, Pickett is portrayed by another actor). In addition to Lang's performance, virtually the entire cast seem to phone in their performances, almost as if they are just here to get their paycheck. In a historical drama, that is VERY BAD news, since the whole movie hinges on you believing these characters are the REAL people. Even Tom Berringer and Jeff Daniels, who gave EXCELLENT performances in Gettysburg, seem more subdued. One bright note is Robert Duvall, who gives a more even portrayal of Robert E. Lee than Martin Sheen's slightly histrionic version of Lee in Gettysburg.The battle scenes are few and far between in Gods & Generals, and are nowhere near as well done as in Gettysburg. It appears the director wanted to focus more on battlefield drama than on accurate depictions of Civil War battle. The Battle Of Bull Run (Manassas) is poorly depicted, with unrealistic violence and pacing. The choreography is second rate. Fredricksburg doesn't fare much better: One of the truly great 'unintentionally funny' moments in film history comes as Union troops shoot a rebel soldier on a rooftop. In a FANTASTICALLY cliched moment, the rebel breaks through a railing to fall to the ground. 'B' western, anyone?????Sadly, the movie focuses too much on Jackson, and not enough on the events of the Civil War. The interpersonal relations in Gettysburg worked because they were wrapped around the framework of the great Civil War battle; here, the battles feel like an afterthought that were thrown in hastily so the movie can get right back to focusing on Stonewall Jackson's personal life. Very misguided, very bad movie making.All in all, this film shoots so wide of the mark it is a bit embarrassing. Throw in the expectations set by the EXCELLENT Gettysburg, and you have a terribly disappointing movie in Gods & Generals. My actual rating for this movie is 2 and a half stars (not two), because it is not a AWFUL movie, it just isn't very good. Plus, it gets a little extra credit for at least attempting such an ambitious project as this. The fact that it fails in the attempt is saddening mostly because we will never see the final movie in the trilogy, and that is a shame. Had it been as good as Gettysburg, The Last Full Measure could have been another 5 star historical drama, which there is dreadful shortage of.

For the person who doesn't have much knowledge of the Civil War this movie may seem confusing at times. I asked myself, ""Is this a movie about Stonewall Jackson?"" or ""Is this a jab at Union leadership during 1861 to 1863?"".  Based on Shaara's novel, the movie does skip some interesting chapters in the book which may have helped build several characters confusingly added as history unfolded.  Truly it is very hard to capture the years of the war without skipping key events such as Antietam or 2nd Manassas and fit it all in nearly four hours.  The romantic and mythic feel of Lee and Jackson somewhat come to life though their aura rarely shines as compared to the novel.  Maxwell has truly taken on more than moviegoers may be able to handle or understand in this wildly ever-changing film.  For the non-Civil War buff, I would rate it 3 stars.Now for the Civil War buff rating:1 star.  For a Civil War Historian like myself it skips too many things, introduces unimportant individuals to timeline with important events.  Over glorified characters are brought forward and Union leadership is horribly constructed to explain their motivations or history.  The fighting is extremely clean (made for television someday) and confusingly demonstrated as to explain the battles. Large scale battles such as Fredericksburg and Manassas are near skirmishes on film which can make a novice think few were involved.  Uniforms and grit are better conveyed compared to Gettysburg although some battlefield pyrotechnics are constructed on computers that look very fake and laughable.  This leads me to say to Maxwell, does the movie ""Glory"" mean anything?  If you want to demonstrate action, please watch the first 15 minutes of Glory to get a better feel of battle and put that same action into your movies! Maxwell's cleanliness unfortunately reappears and poorly defines Civil War fighting.  The silly romances of Stonewall Jackson and his wife along with model-like actresses made this movie a poor representation of how people looked and lived in 1860.  I hate to nitpick, but this movie just didn't have it.",3,Does this top Gettysburg?,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,2161,"['top', 'Gettysburg', 'Probably', 'not', 'opinion', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'knowledge', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'confusing', 'times', 'asked', 'movie', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'jab', 'Union', 'leadership', '1861', '1863', 'Based', 'Shaara', 'novel', 'movie', 'skip', 'interesting', 'chapters', 'book', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'build', 'several', 'characters', 'confusingly', 'added', 'history', 'unfolded', 'Truly', 'very', 'hard', 'capture', 'years', 'war', 'skipping', 'key', 'events', 'such', 'Antietam', '2nd', 'Manassas', 'fit', 'nearly', 'four', 'hours', 'romantic', 'mythic', 'feel', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'somewhat', 'come', 'life', 'aura', 'rarely', 'compared', 'novel', 'Maxwell', 'truly', 'taken', 'more', 'moviegoers', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'understand', 'wildly', 'ever-changing', 'film', 'non-Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'would', 'rate', '3', 'stars.Now', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'rating:1', 'star', 'Civil', 'War', 'Historian', 'skips', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'introduces', 'unimportant', 'individuals', 'timeline', 'important', 'events', 'glorified', 'characters', 'are', 'brought', 'forward', 'Union', 'leadership', 'horribly', 'constructed', 'explain', 'motivations', 'history', 'fighting', 'extremely', 'clean', 'made', 'television', 'someday', 'confusingly', 'demonstrated', 'explain', 'battles', 'Large', 'scale', 'battles', 'such', 'Fredericksburg', 'Manassas', 'are', 'near', 'skirmishes', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'novice', 'think', 'few', 'were', 'involved', 'Uniforms', 'grit', 'are', 'better', 'conveyed', 'compared', 'Gettysburg', 'battlefield', 'pyrotechnics', 'are', 'constructed', 'computers', 'look', 'very', 'fake', 'laughable', 'say', 'Maxwell', 'movie', 'Glory', 'mean', 'anything', 'want', 'demonstrate', 'action', 'please', 'watch', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Glory', 'get', 'better', 'feel', 'battle', 'put', 'same', 'action', 'movies', 'Maxwell', 'cleanliness', 'unfortunately', 'reappears', 'poorly', 'defines', 'Civil', 'War', 'fighting', 'silly', 'romances', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'wife', 'model-like', 'actresses', 'made', 'movie', 'poor', 'representation', 'how', 'people', 'looked', 'lived', '1860', 'hate', 'nitpick', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have']",N/A

Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.  Very interesting is the slave perspective, with viewpoints from the actors who played Martha and Jim, two prominant slave characters in the movie.  The DVD also includes 2 music videos of songs featured in the movie.If you are a history buff, you will most definately love this movie and cherish its themes.

755945,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00009OOFA,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[5, 18]","This is a film about the battles of Fredericksberg and Chancerloville. It is apparently the first of a trilogy that attempts to be some sort of history of the Eastern Campaigns of the American Civil War. The film is told largely from a Confederate perspective with portraits of the Generals Lee and Jackson. The Union side is represented but by more lowly ranked soldiers.Historically the two battles portrayed were significant Confederate victories and led to Lee feeling confident enough to launch his disastrous Gettysberg campaign.Most treatments of the American Civil war see it as an epic struggle in which both sides are glorified. The North, representing the ideals of modern Enlightenment and the South as romantic freedom fighters. One would think however that there is a stronger case for presenting the struggle as a war of bungling amateurs.Sherman in his memoirs characterises the battle of Bull Run as that of bumbling amateurs. The North not able to launch an attack and the South not able to destroy the Union forces after inflicting a defeat. The battles that followed repeated the pattern. McClelland must surely rank as one of the worst generals in the history of warfare. He led a huge army into the South and when attacked by Lee simply retreated. Although Lee has been for years portrayed as a genius his tactics could only work against a fool such as McCelland. Any other general worth his salt would have noticed that Lee had expended the lives of his soldiers at such a rate that he would not have been able to defend against a counter attack.After McCelland was sacked the command of the Union forces moved to Burnside who launched the disastrous Fredericksberg campaign. He ordered his men to ford a river and to attack piecemeal well fortified confederate positions. Another disastrous defeat saw Hooker take over the responsibility for the Northern forces and this led to the disastrous Chanceroville campaign. Despite having overwhelming numbers Hooker was again able to lose. Lee split his forces and using heavily wooded country sent Jackson around the rear of the Union Army to take them by surprise. This tactic worked and another Confederate victory. Of course against a general of moderate competence this strategy would not have worked. If one held firm then Lee was happy to simply destroy his armies by pointless attacks. Something discovered by General Meade at Gettysberg.The film adopts the epic struggle approach. The incompetence of  Burnside is acknowledged but Chancerloville is seen as a tactical masterpiece by Lee and Jackson.The film is split between a number of battle scenes and some human interest scenes with most of the human interest scenes dealing with Jackson. The battle scenes do not look that realistic. They look more like overweight civil war fans doing re-enactments. Some of the things portrayed are inaccurate such as the use of exploding artillery charges and the sight of infantry loading guns with the bayonets fixed.The human interest scenes are generally ponderous an often like tableaus. There is little dialogue and it unnatural and staged.  Still not doubt it will be a great hit with civil war buffs.",1,Yawn,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,3176,"['film', 'battles', 'Fredericksberg', 'Chancerloville', 'apparently', 'first', 'trilogy', 'be', 'sort', 'history', 'Eastern', 'Campaigns', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'told', 'largely', 'Confederate', 'perspective', 'portraits', 'Generals', 'Lee', 'Jackson', 'Union', 'side', 'represented', 'more', 'lowly', 'ranked', 'soldiers.Historically', 'two', 'battles', 'portrayed', 'were', 'significant', 'Confederate', 'victories', 'led', 'Lee', 'feeling', 'confident', 'enough', 'launch', 'disastrous', 'Gettysberg', 'campaign.Most', 'treatments', 'American', 'Civil', 'war', 'see', 'epic', 'struggle', 'sides', 'are', 'glorified', 'North', 'representing', 'ideals', 'modern', 'Enlightenment', 'South', 'romantic', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'however', 'stronger', 'case', 'presenting', 'struggle', 'war', 'bungling', 'amateurs.Sherman', 'memoirs', 'battle', 'Bull', 'Run', 'bumbling', 'amateurs', 'North', 'not', 'able', 'launch', 'attack', 'South', 'not', 'able', 'destroy', 'Union', 'forces', 'inflicting', 'defeat', 'battles', 'followed', 'repeated', 'pattern', 'McClelland', 'must', 'surely', 'rank', 'one', 'worst', 'generals', 'history', 'warfare', 'led', 'huge', 'army', 'South', 'when', 'attacked', 'Lee', 'simply', 'retreated', 'Lee', 'been', 'years', 'portrayed', 'genius', 'tactics', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'fool', 'such', 'McCelland', 'Any', 'other', 'general', 'salt', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'Lee', 'had', 'expended', 'lives', 'soldiers', 'rate', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'defend', 'counter', 'attack.After', 'McCelland', 'was', 'sacked', 'command', 'Union', 'forces', 'moved', 'Burnside', 'who', 'launched', 'disastrous', 'Fredericksberg', 'campaign', 'ordered', 'men', 'ford', 'river', 'attack', 'piecemeal', 'well', 'fortified', 'confederate', 'positions', 'disastrous', 'defeat', 'saw', 'Hooker', 'take', 'over', 'responsibility', 'Northern', 'forces', 'led', 'disastrous', 'Chanceroville', 'campaign', 'having', 'overwhelming', 'numbers', 'Hooker', 'was', 'again', 'able', 'lose', 'Lee', 'split', 'forces', 'using', 'heavily', 'wooded', 'country', 'sent', 'Jackson', 'rear', 'Union', 'Army', 'take', 'surprise', 'tactic', 'worked', 'Confederate', 'victory', 'course', 'general', 'moderate', 'competence', 'strategy', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'one', 'held', 'firm', 'then', 'Lee', 'was', 'happy', 'simply', 'destroy', 'armies', 'pointless', 'attacks', 'Something', 'discovered', 'General', 'Meade', 'Gettysberg.The', 'film', 'epic', 'struggle', 'approach', 'incompetence', 'Burnside', 'acknowledged', 'Chancerloville', 'seen', 'tactical', 'masterpiece', 'Lee', 'Jackson.The', 'film', 'split', 'number', 'battle', 'scenes', 'human', 'interest', 'scenes', 'most', 'human', 'interest', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'Jackson', 'battle', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'realistic', 'look', 'more', 'overweight', 'civil', 'war', 'fans', 'doing', 're-enactments', 'things', 'portrayed', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'such', 'use', 'exploding', 'artillery', 'charges', 'sight', 'infantry', 'loading', 'guns', 'bayonets', 'fixed.The', 'human', 'interest', 'scenes', 'are', 'generally', 'ponderous', 'often', 'like', 'tableaus', 'little', 'dialogue', 'unnatural', 'staged', 'Still', 'not', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'hit', 'civil', 'war', 'buffs']",N/A

In some ways it's almost the most expensive home movie ever shot, with Ted Turner paying for this account of the early years of the American Civil War out of his own pocket. For the first hour it's almost as if the Union never existed, the film shown entirely from the Southern side, and with a very partisan view at that (all down to Yankee aggression, with Fort Sumpter conveniently dismissed in a single line). Too often lengthy quotations take the place of dialogue and even the better actors in the cast often seem ill at ease while the surprisingly weak daylight photography and poor CGi matte painting in early scenes giving it an air of storybook unreality. Indeed, Ronald Maxwell's approach at times seems pure D.W. Griffith, with a fondness for awkward tableaux and unconvincing sentiment (poor Mira Sorvino gets a couple of particularly painfully hearts-and-flowers scenes to deliver as a consolation prize for missing out on playing Joan of Arc when Maxwell's version was dropped in the wake of Luc Besson's film). There are a few moments here and there - an intimate scene between Stonewall Jackson and his wife confiding his doubts, a scene between Jeff Daniels and Kevin Conway's sergeant about friends on the other side - but as the over-ambitious film tries to cram too much history into its four hour running time (and still scenes filmed dealing with Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth and the Battle of Antietem didn't make the cut) the people just get lost.Thankfully, the second half rallies considerably as the film reaches the Battle of Fredericksburg and the 20th Maine's disastrous charge, and the contradictions in Stephen Lang's ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a deeply religious man yet one who advocated taking no prisoners, become more interesting despite the film's determination to turn him into across between Jesus Christ and a vengeful Old Testament prophet. Yet sadly the lasting impression is of a film that is too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good and one that not only either needed to be a lot longer or a lot shorter but also much better written. As for the somewhat nonsensical title, it's an abbreviation of the novel's Faith in Gods and Generals. Incidentally, be warned that the DVD has one of the worst side breaks ever. Some fairly decent DVD extras, but the lack of deleted scenes implies a director's cut may be in the offing some time in the future.",3,Wildly overambitious,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,2630,"['Ironies', 'abound', 'Gettysburg', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'ended', 'up', 'theatrical', 'release', 'yet', '60m', 'budget', 'huge', 'cast', 'being', 'shot', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'home', 'TV', 'ways', 'almost', 'most', 'expensive', 'home', 'movie', 'ever', 'shot', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'paying', 'account', 'early', 'years', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'own', 'pocket', 'first', 'hour', 'almost', 'Union', 'never', 'existed', 'film', 'shown', 'entirely', 'Southern', 'side', 'very', 'partisan', 'view', 'down', 'Yankee', 'aggression', 'Fort', 'Sumpter', 'conveniently', 'dismissed', 'single', 'line', 'Too', 'often', 'lengthy', 'quotations', 'take', 'place', 'dialogue', 'even', 'better', 'actors', 'cast', 'often', 'seem', 'ill', 'ease', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'daylight', 'photography', 'poor', 'CGi', 'matte', 'painting', 'early', 'scenes', 'giving', 'air', 'storybook', 'unreality', 'Indeed', 'Ronald', 'Maxwell', 'approach', 'times', 'pure', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'fondness', 'awkward', 'tableaux', 'unconvincing', 'sentiment', 'poor', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'couple', 'particularly', 'painfully', 'hearts-and-flowers', 'scenes', 'deliver', 'consolation', 'prize', 'missing', 'out', 'playing', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'when', 'Maxwell', 'version', 'was', 'dropped', 'wake', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'intimate', 'scene', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'wife', 'confiding', 'doubts', 'scene', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Kevin', 'Conway', 'sergeant', 'friends', 'other', 'side', 'over-ambitious', 'film', 'tries', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'history', 'four', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'still', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'dealing', 'Lincoln', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'Battle', 'Antietem', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'people', 'just', 'get', 'lost.Thankfully', 'second', 'half', 'considerably', 'film', 'Battle', 'Fredericksburg', '20th', 'Maine', 'disastrous', 'charge', 'contradictions', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'yet', 'one', 'who', 'advocated', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'determination', 'turn', 'across', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'vengeful', 'Old', 'Testament', 'prophet', 'sadly', 'lasting', 'impression', 'film', 'too', 'sprawling', 'unfocussed', 'own', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'either', 'needed', 'be', 'lot', 'longer', 'lot', 'shorter', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'somewhat', 'nonsensical', 'title', 'abbreviation', 'novel', 'Faith', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'Incidentally', 'be', 'warned', 'DVD', 'one', 'worst', 'side', 'breaks', 'ever', 'fairly', 'decent', 'DVD', 'extras', 'lack', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'cut', 'may', 'be', 'offing', 'time', 'future']",N/A

Many critics say the film only depicts union losses, but there were many union losses the movie didn't hit on also, such as 2nd Bull Run and Jacksons valley campaign - which was a stunning victory for the south as Jackson was able to drive his opponent back to Washington although he was greatly outnumbered - thus forcing McClellan to pull back from his peninsula effort to protect Washington. Superior tactics, deception, leadership, and sheer will saved the day for the south during the first couple years of the war - not to mention the obvious ineptness of the northern leadership.Lincoln went through four generals during this period - four! Burnsides refusal to flank the rebs and instead meet them head-on at Fredericksburg (and slowly - after they were fully entrenched above Mayres heights) was blunderous. Outnumbered 2-1, the rebs slaughtered wave after wave of union soldiers.And at Chancellorsville, Hooker had his army prepared and had a good plan to outflank Lee and destroy it. He simply lost his nerve. Again, Lees superior tactics and troop positioning forced Hookers defeated forces north of the Rappohannick. This is another battle where Lee won the battle, but lost the war. The northern losses could, and were, soon replaced. There were no replacements to replace southern losses. This is what finally did Lee in.No matter the southern cause, Lee and Jackson were protecting their home from invasion. They were severly outnumbered and had no choice but to take the war north and threaten Washington. Lee and Jackson were two of the most tactical leaders to ever fight a war (imho) and this movie - despite its flaws - depicted this well. Superior numbers should had brought a northern victory within the first year. I mean - c'mon - nine months to seize Petersburg towards the end of the war?

755953,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00009OOFA,V. Marshall,"[2, 7]","This epic film is the first in a trilogy of Civil War re-enactments and tells the story of events that took place in Virginia and West Virginia during 1861-1863.I was very impressed with this film and the seeming accuracy with which the filmmakers stayed true. While I am shamefully unaware of all of the complex history that took place during the Civil War I imagine most of this film to be a just depiction of the history books. The film is very long and almost impossible to get through in one sitting unless you are a Civil War fanatic. Many of the scenes are devastating and bring to life the horrible reality of what real war was all about. These men, and sadly many boys, went to battle with nothing more than their own feet, woolen coats for armor and felt hats as helmets with their hearts as their only shield. Just watching the effort it took to fire one shot and then to re-load and hope to not get hit by fire in return was shear torture to observe. Life is just much easier all the way around for Americans these days. This film is powerful, inspiring and extremely sad all at the same time. But it is after all how America came to be and shows the integrity with which our Nation was created.While I found myself being disappointed at times with the endless stream of unknown actors who graced the screen and the often comical mis-glued beard, I did enjoy a few of the noted performances. The always brilliant Robert Duvall portrays Gen. Robert E. Lee with a quiet extremely conservative conviction. Duvall masters dignity in this role and enforces the greatness of Gen. Lee. Beside Duvall, portraying the great ""Stonewall"" Jackson is Stephen Lang. Lang is absolutely superb as Jackson and showed him to be a faithful servant of the Confederate campaign. Lang has touching scenes with a young child he befriends on Xmas day and during his breakdown on the field once he learns of her demise. I have to say that for the majority of this film I was rooting for the Southern Confederates because of their extreme integrity and awesome faith in something higher than themselves, but then I remembered my history lessons and realized they were for slavery ( an idea I abhor!) so I switched sides....yes, I flip-flopped!!This movie is epic in proportion using a cast of thousands of extras to fight in the battle scenes. My only complaint is that sometimes some of the scenery and little details come across a little on the cheesy side but then it would be impossible to be perfect on such an extraordinary historical set with so many people to tend to. I felt as though the film was pretty one-sided with the emphasis on integrity and faith resting with the South and the Northerners being the sneaky, stealing side resting their laurels on the faith of old Roman soldiers rather than a true God. Slavery had to end for democracy to continue so all of the good ole Southern faith and glory couldn't be as wonderful as this film tends to portray. But an important aside stems from such a film, it makes you want to learn more about American history and how we came to be. It seems a country built from such hardship, strength and honor would remain planted in roots sown so bravely but divided we begin to stand once again. Hopefully our new generals find faith in some of what the old ones left behind, not in history books but in every American heart.",3,"Generals, Armies and Fate in God's Hands",1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,3362,"['epic', 'film', 'first', 'trilogy', 'Civil', 'War', 're-enactments', 'story', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Virginia', 'West', 'Virginia', '1861-1863.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'seeming', 'accuracy', 'filmmakers', 'stayed', 'true', 'am', 'shamefully', 'unaware', 'complex', 'history', 'took', 'place', 'Civil', 'War', 'imagine', 'most', 'film', 'be', 'just', 'depiction', 'history', 'books', 'film', 'very', 'long', 'almost', 'impossible', 'get', 'one', 'sitting', 'are', 'Civil', 'War', 'fanatic', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'devastating', 'bring', 'life', 'horrible', 'reality', 'what', 'real', 'war', 'was', 'men', 'sadly', 'many', 'boys', 'went', 'battle', 'nothing', 'more', 'own', 'feet', 'woolen', 'coats', 'armor', 'felt', 'hats', 'helmets', 'hearts', 'only', 'shield', 'Just', 'watching', 'effort', 'took', 'fire', 'one', 'shot', 'then', 're-load', 'hope', 'not', 'get', 'hit', 'fire', 'return', 'was', 'shear', 'torture', 'observe', 'Life', 'just', 'much', 'easier', 'way', 'Americans', 'days', 'film', 'powerful', 'inspiring', 'extremely', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'how', 'America', 'came', 'be', 'integrity', 'Nation', 'was', 'created.While', 'found', 'being', 'disappointed', 'times', 'endless', 'stream', 'unknown', 'actors', 'who', 'graced', 'screen', 'often', 'comical', 'mis-glued', 'beard', 'did', 'enjoy', 'few', 'noted', 'performances', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Gen.', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'quiet', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'conviction', 'Duvall', 'masters', 'dignity', 'role', 'greatness', 'Gen.', 'Lee', 'Beside', 'Duvall', 'portraying', 'great', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Jackson', 'showed', 'be', 'faithful', 'servant', 'Confederate', 'campaign', 'Lang', 'touching', 'scenes', 'young', 'child', 'Xmas', 'day', 'breakdown', 'field', 'once', 'demise', 'have', 'say', 'majority', 'film', 'was', 'rooting', 'Southern', 'Confederates', 'extreme', 'integrity', 'awesome', 'faith', 'something', 'higher', 'then', 'remembered', 'history', 'lessons', 'realized', 'were', 'slavery', 'idea', 'abhor', 'switched', 'sides', '.yes', 'flip-flopped', 'movie', 'epic', 'proportion', 'using', 'cast', 'thousands', 'extras', 'fight', 'battle', 'scenes', 'only', 'complaint', 'sometimes', 'scenery', 'little', 'details', 'come', 'little', 'cheesy', 'side', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'be', 'perfect', 'extraordinary', 'historical', 'set', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'tend', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'one-sided', 'emphasis', 'integrity', 'faith', 'resting', 'South', 'Northerners', 'being', 'sneaky', 'stealing', 'side', 'resting', 'laurels', 'faith', 'old', 'Roman', 'rather', 'true', 'God', 'Slavery', 'had', 'end', 'democracy', 'continue', 'so', 'good', 'ole', 'Southern', 'faith', 'glory', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'wonderful', 'film', 'portray', 'important', 'aside', 'such', 'film', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'American', 'history', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'country', 'built', 'such', 'hardship', 'strength', 'honor', 'would', 'remain', 'planted', 'roots', 'sown', 'so', 'bravely', 'divided', 'begin', 'stand', 'once', 'again', 'Hopefully', 'new', 'generals', 'find', 'faith', 'what', 'old', 'ones', 'left', 'behind', 'not', 'history', 'books', 'American', 'heart']",N/A
755954,AUSFBVEVSUMBW,B00009OOFA,Wade H. Rice Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is probably one of the most difficult and involved assessments of any product I've reviewed here at Amazon.com.  Rather than critiquing the movie from either the controversial politically-correct or conservative viewpoints, I will try to point out some things about why I feel the movie failed to succeed at the box office (or on DVD) vs. the actual Jeff Shaara novel, which I have read, and I feel is more successful.We must remember from the outset that the Jeff Shaara novel was likewise written in the same vein as father Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"".  Both essentially are narratives and character studies of the participants' thoughts, responses, and reactions to historical events that they were jointly a part of.First, the movie does not faithfully follow the Jeff Shaara novel as did father Michael Shaara's novel, ""The Killer Angels"" in the movie, ""Gettysburg.""  While the vast majority of events presented in the movie are historically accurate, the movie emphasizes the Civil War service of Confederate General Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson, whereas Jeff Shaara's novel gives equal character treatment to Jackson, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Union Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and Union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock.  While the first three are dealt with rather well in the film, worst of all, the movie pushes Hancock into the background as a minor character vs. his being a significant contributor to the action as was in the novel.  Much of Hancock's involvement in the novel as a battlefield general is given in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign of General George McClellan (omitted from the movie) and at the Battle of Antietam (also omitted), of which other reviewers lamented its movie exclusion.Second, there is the timing of appearance of Shaara's novel on the market and that of the mammoth, authoritative Jackson biography by Dr. James I. Robertson, Jr. of Virginia Tech, who is featured in the extra features on the DVD.  Shaara's novel appeared in 1996 and Robertson's Jackson biography appeared in 1997.  When the time came to make the movie version of the novel, the attendant excitement of the discovery of a tremendous amount of information about Jackson's life from Robertson's biography in the intervening years probably somewhat affected the decision to make the switch in emphasis for a movie version to make Jackson the main character.  In addition to the appearance of the Robertson biography, there had to have been the intervention of Executive Producer Ted Turner to make this so.  What puzzles me is why novelist Jeff Shaara allowed this to happen, even though he seems enthusiastic in the DVD extra features about it happening as it did.Third, while admirers of Jackson were pleased to see Jackson the Confederate become the main character in the film, this obviously would not set well with a movie-going public, the vast majority of which would know little about Civil War history and also which the majority would prefer to see themes in films dealt with in a politically-correct manner.  While Civil War enthusiasts can carp all they want for the politically-correct element's failure to study their Civil War history before delivering judgment on a part of the war's history that is not to their liking, that realistically is something that would and will not happen.Fourth, with the switch in character emphasis to Confederate Jackson as opposed to an evenly-distributed one amongst four characters, significant screenplay modifications needed to be made.  The first major change in the movie from the novel action deals with the First Battle of Bull Run, or Manassas, which is dealt with only in passing in the novel.  Jackson is the only character amongst the four major players in the novel involved at Bull Run.  Obviously, if Jackson has now become the major character in the film, a significant departure from the novel needed to be made to depict how Jackson got the name of ""Stonewall"" at Bull Run.  This departure from the novel is dealt with rather expertly and is historically accurate, even if not to the liking of the politically-correct.Fifth and last, I don't know how or why two folk/rock singers (Mary Fahl and Bob Dylan) were allowed to contribute two songs to the beginning and ending of the movie that seemingly were opposed in approach and tone to each other.  Of the two, I feel that Bob Dylan's contribution was the least meaningful, and didn't contribute to the tone of the sad moment at the film's end that viewers had just experienced with the death of Jackson.  If anything, I would liked to have had a reprise of the Fahl song, which seemed better to fit the sobering ending.  Rather, I could have done without either singer's input, and relied on the contributions of film composers John Frizzell and Randy Edelman.  The input of Mary Fahl and Bob Dylan was likely Ted Turner's decision to attempt to generate a wider appeal for his film.In summary, if the film had been more faithful to the novel, I think it would have had a better chance of succeeding as ""Gettysburg"" had.  Still, as other reviewers have stated, there simply was too much history to cover in what had already become an extremely long film (three hours and thirty-nine minutes), with no intermission.  ""Gettysburg"" covered only four days, whereas ""Gods and Generals"" covered two years.  ""Gettysburg"" was originally conceived and filmed as a TV mini-series, and with proper editing, succeeded as a long movie (four hours and fifteen minutes) with intermission.  ""Gods and Generals"" should not have been conceived as a movie and would have been more successful as a mini-series, following the novel more faithfully than it did.  But as it is, it was good in accurately depicting the historical events of the time period it covered.The unfortunate lack of success that ""Gods and Generals"" suffered was a financial setback for Ted Turner, which resulted in his decision not to fund filming of the last part of the Shaara trilogy, ""The Last Full Measure.""  This is stated at Jeff Shaara's web site in response to the many inquiries made by those who want to see it made.",4,Many Things Worked Against the Movie Not Succeeding as Well as the

There is no bad side or good side, because...God is on both sides, therefore canceling the point.I don't exactly know how to explain it fully within one review, but all I can say is that if you want to see a movie that's about two sides battling it out, with the movie makers trying to film it from both perspectives in a way that makes it confusing, pointless and boring, and a movie that's four hours long (including the intermission) then go ahead, watch this.

755959,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00009OOFA,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[2, 3]","This is a review of both ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". The ratings and titles are different.If it isn't obvious from watching these films, the director/screenwriter explains in an interview that they're intended to present an unbiased view of both North and South, without labeling anyone as good or bad, hero or villain. What then remains, he says, is the horror of war (though most of it is shown at a PG-13 level). What, then, is the /dramatic/ point?Little, it seems. It isn't until near the end of ""Gods"" * that Jeff Daniels says what needed to have been said at the start -- that he can't understand why Southerners rant on about freedom, when they live under a system that enslaves people. The Southern argument -- that their states are their countries -- is an accurate reflection of how people felt -- indeed, of how this country was conceived (in both senses of the word) -- but it pales in comparison with the facts that not only is slavery wholly unjustifiable (unless you believe that sub-human people exist solely to earn your bread for you), and that the war was fought over the spread of slavery. Those reaching for their keyboards to accuse me of political correctness are advised to refrain.The wide range of personal opinions on IMDb is not surprising. Northerners tend to see ""Gods"" as pro-Southern, Southerners as vindication. Neither is correct. But at a time when legislators -- many from Southern states -- are trying to exterminate the few vestiges of democracy that remain in this country -- neither film sits very well with this viewer. I would like to point out to Southerner sympathizers reading this... You lost. Get over it. State's rights were trampled where they should have been trampled, and the Federal government affirmed its superiority over the states. Tough.As for who's the better Lee, Sheen or Duvall, the decision has to come down firmly on Sheen's side. Photos of Lee suggest a dark personality, and Sheen captures this better. Duvall is a strong person, and there is -- except for a few moments near the end -- little sense of weakness, or any ambiguity in his views. It doesn't help that Sheen has several scenes of strong dramatic interaction that allow him to display Lee's character -- Duvall has only one brief ""dramatic"" moment (which he does well). Sheen's show of fear and anguish at the end of ""Gettysburg"" is played beautifully.Both films are worth seeing. But their attempts to present a dispassionate perspective weakens them. It might be /logical/ to ask us to show sympathy for people who are morally wrong -- but it implies that whatever we do is the result of the Zeitgeist, uncontrollable forces we cannot avoid. But we can, of course.* I interpret the use of ""Gods"" as referring to the different gods Northerners and Southerners worship. It's particularly striking (especially among the Southerners) how often they ascribe human events to God's will -- as if humans have no responsibility for their own behavior.",3,What is the dramatic point?,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,2983,"['review', 'Gettysburg', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'ratings', 'titles', 'are', 'different.If', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'watching', 'films', 'director/screenwriter', 'interview', ""'re"", 'intended', 'present', 'unbiased', 'view', 'North', 'South', 'labeling', 'anyone', 'as', 'good', 'bad', 'hero', 'villain', 'What', 'then', 'horror', 'war', 'most', 'shown', 'PG-13', 'level', 'What', 'then', '/dramatic/', 'point', 'Little', ""n't"", 'end', 'Gods', '*', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'what', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Southerners', 'rant', 'freedom', 'when', 'live', 'system', 'people', 'Southern', 'argument', 'states', 'are', 'countries', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'how', 'people', 'felt', 'indeed', 'how', 'country', 'was', 'conceived', 'senses', 'word', 'comparison', 'facts', 'not', 'only', 'slavery', 'wholly', 'unjustifiable', 'believe', 'sub-human', 'people', 'exist', 'solely', 'earn', 'bread', 'war', 'was', 'fought', 'spread', 'slavery', 'reaching', 'keyboards', 'accuse', 'political', 'correctness', 'are', 'advised', 'refrain.The', 'wide', 'range', 'personal', 'opinions', 'IMDb', 'not', 'surprising', 'Northerners', 'tend', 'see', 'Gods', 'pro-Southern', 'Southerners', 'vindication', 'correct', 'time', 'when', 'legislators', 'many', 'Southern', 'states', 'are', 'trying', 'exterminate', 'few', 'vestiges', 'democracy', 'remain', 'country', 'film', 'sits', 'very', 'well', 'viewer', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Southerner', 'sympathizers', 'reading', 'lost', 'Get', 'State', 'rights', 'were', 'trampled', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'trampled', 'Federal', 'government', 'affirmed', 'superiority', 'states', 'Tough.As', 'who', 'better', 'Lee', 'Sheen', 'Duvall', 'decision', 'come', 'down', 'firmly', 'Sheen', 'side', 'Photos', 'Lee', 'suggest', 'dark', 'personality', 'Sheen', 'better', 'Duvall', 'strong', 'person', 'few', 'moments', 'end', 'little', 'sense', 'weakness', 'ambiguity', 'views', ""n't"", 'help', 'Sheen', 'several', 'scenes', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'interaction', 'allow', 'display', 'Lee', 'character', 'Duvall', 'only', 'one', 'brief', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'well', 'Sheen', 'show', 'fear', 'anguish', 'end', 'Gettysburg', 'played', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'attempts', 'present', 'dispassionate', 'perspective', 'might', 'be', '/logical/', 'ask', 'show', 'sympathy', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'morally', 'wrong', 'do', 'result', 'Zeitgeist', 'uncontrollable', 'forces', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'can', 'course', '*', 'interpret', 'use', 'Gods', 'referring', 'different', 'gods', 'Northerners', 'Southerners', 'worship', 'particularly', 'striking', 'especially', 'Southerners', 'how', 'often', 'ascribe', 'human', 'events', 'God', 'will', 'humans', 'have', 'responsibility', 'own', 'behavior']",N/A

Because 1993's ""Gettysburg"" was so unimpressive. While ""Gettysburg"" had some worthwhile scenes it was merely okay on a whole, and sometimes downright tedious. How the filmmakers made the Civil War's biggest battle (generally) boring is beyond me.""Gods and Generals"" is the prequel detailing the battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, which are largely viewed through the lens of Stonewall Jackson (Stephan Lang) on the Confederate side and the Chamberlain brothers (Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell) of Maine on the Union side.Also on hand, of course, is Robert E. Lee played by Robert Duvall, who does a more engaging portrayal than Martin Sheen in ""Gettysburg.""The film starts off slow and builds momentum. By contrast, ""Gettysburg"" started off slower and never became engaging with the exception of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge. Where ""Gods and Generals"" really pulled me in was the battle scenes of Fredericksburg and the aftermath. It showed how Civil War troops were required to march, shoot & reload in formation while rifles and cannons are blasting their way. The Chamberlain brothers had to sleep on the battlefield that night. Imagine sleeping amongst all those dead bodies and dying, moaning soldiers! This was very well done.There are quite a few other great scenes, like the Yankee and Reb soldiers meeting in the middle of ther river to exchange coffee for tobacco; the execution of three deserters; and the ""perfect battle"" for the Confederates at Chancellorsville where General Lee, with a much smaller force, took the risk of dividing his army and executing a surprise attack. Unfortunately for the Confederates they won at a huge cost as General Lee's ""right arm"" falls to friendly fire.The story ends on a slow, melancholy note.I was impressed with the battle in the town scene. The town looked so authentic. Watching the documentary afterward I learned how they accomplished this: they filmed it at Harpers Ferry, WV.Some have complained that the Southern viewpoint is shown in a more positive light than the Northern, but I disagree. While it seems more time is spent with Lee & Jackson's story considerable time is certainly given to the North as well; the film does an excellent job of taking the middle road between the two positions.The film was shot on location in Virginia, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, WV and runs 3 hours and 39 minutes. A Director's Cut will be released on May 24, 2011 and will be a full hour and one minute longer featuring the bloody battle of Antietam and a subplot with John Wilkes Booth.FINAL WORD: If you thought ""Gettysburg"" was boring don't let that prevent you from checking out ""Gods and Generals."" Yes, you have to be ready for a long movie and it does have some slow, dramatic parts but it builds momentum and it's one of best Civil War films in helping the viewer visualize the battles and many other aspects.WARNING: Believe it or not, the film shows overt depictions of Bible reading, citation and prayer!! It also dares to show Christianity and marriage in a positive light!!
