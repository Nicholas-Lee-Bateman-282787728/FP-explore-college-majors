If you're questioning whether to watch the film, if you like French New Wave, the style of ""The Comedy"" will probably appeal to you.  I hadn't seen a movie like it since college when I had to watch movies like it for class.  I appreciated the character study, the originality (compared to what is mostly available these days)...but I was also keenly aware that I was watching something that was trying to be something.  And I'm not talking ""Tiny Furniture"" -- that movie has way more of a traditional narrative structure than this one.  ""The Comedy"" boasts great (documentary-style) acting and cinematography, but that doesn't make it any less arduous to watch -- and I don't mean that as a criticism.  What I mean is, this is a film to watch when you're in the mood to think and be introspective, not when you're looking for something sunny and uplifting.  The best description I can think of is that it's a sophisticated and polished film school film, and one that's definitely worth watching if you can digest the style (lots of long takes and silence) and mostly melancholy content which centers around a man in his mid-30's who so far has made nothing of his very privileged life and treats people with as little respect as he has for himself.

He is bored and his scenarios are pointless to viewers with more normal real minds.  Because of this, the entire film is probably viewed by most as pointless unless one has some sort of interest in the filmmakers' view of their character's deviate behavior.  But since this behavior is created by the filmmakers, it is not real, and could only possibly provide limited insight into their minds and motives for making such a film.  Much of the film is sick because it merely reflects the sickness of the psychopathic main character.  I do not think it can be called a character study because no character exists to study outside of the filmmakers' imagination.

The film embodies the sadness of an aspect of the hipster culture- disaffected, ironic, sardonic, critical, and, in this case, lonely. It's quiet and has no real narrative plot threads and characters are introduced and ignored, much like seeing the world through the eyes of its lead character who has surrendered to some sort of futility. There is no closure or catharsis. There is no character arc. It is simply a very well shot character sketch that rarely goes beyond the superficial, as there is little else of substance within Swanson himself. It's often strange and its opening scene shameless, but I sort enjoyed it for what it was.

Instead it follows a few days in the life of a rich new york douche who's about to inherit his father's wealth. Throughout the whole movie him and his friends basically just act like A-holes, with no change to the story.

Fast.Anyone else amused at this point with these stupid hipster movies that think they're just so f***ing deep and introspective when really it's just awkward conversations in boring normal environments?

BUT...if you like something that is challenging and wildly different...you've hit the jackpot with THE COMEDY.  There is virtually no plot to speak of.  This is a psychological character piece, so the plot is not of paramount importance.  The lead character is desperate to connect with other people but terrified to do so.  Hence, he behaves repulsively almost all of the time in order to test people.  It's an improvisational journey that fascinated me.  Also, there are moments of pure honesty that leap out at you amidst all the banal behavior exhibited by the characters.

1600741,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009O07NJS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Looking for the feel good comedy of the year? A rollicking good time? Despite its title, ""The Comedy"" probably won't fit that bill. This is a movie that will certainly divide its audience. Is it a brilliant character study of the disaffected? Or is it simply a hateful and punishing experience that will leave you wondering what you just watched? To my estimation, it is both of these things simultaneously. And for this, you will either love or hate ""The Comedy."" Whichever side you fall on, though, I can't imagine you'll be indifferent to it! As a provocation, Rick Alverson's screenplay certainly succeeds. Much of the dialogue is pushed to the extremes of offensiveness. It's so calculated, in fact, that it becomes somewhat indulgent and unrelenting. The film is counterbalanced in some quieter moments, but there is no redemption at the end of this rainbow. If you need a big plot or noticeable character growth, ""The Comedy"" provides neither. It just shows a subculture of post collegiate ennui that has extended into adulthood.Tim Heideker plays the lead, an irresponsible man/child facing the death of his father. His life consists of getting drunk, behaving boorishly, and hanging out with friends with similarly uninspired goals. Heideker, whether in action or in discourse, is poised to mock and offend just about everyone he encounters. His diatribes can be funny in the most politically incorrect way possible, but he uses them as a defense mechanism against normal intimacy. I didn't laugh out loud, but I was amused by the ferocity and the apparent insecurities that unleashed it. There is no doubt that Heideker is disturbed, some may say pathetic, but that's what makes ""The Comedy"" so distinctive. It has a definite point of view and, as a character study, it works. As repellant as I found the antics, I also believed them in the context of this character.Dark and bitter, I'm not even sure that I would classify this experience as a comedy. It is searing human drama tinged with uncomfortable humor. In a bold choice, Alverson doesn't really give us much story and (odder still) no real character arc. Every once in a while, you see the sad little boy beneath the veneer, but this is not about growth and redemption. You have to take Heideker at face value, and I understood and appreciated this unorthodox character. The big question for most will be ""does this qualify as entertainment?"" This is where I think the audience will divide. I was happy to go on this journey, no matter how unpleasant. But it is certainly not a movie that will be embraced by all. It's an art house experiment that isn't particularly meant for mass consumption at the local mall theater. It's aggressive and in-your-face and unapologetic. I'm not certain that I loved ""The Comedy,"" but I won't soon forget it. That's a compliment in this era or forgettable entertainment. KGHarris, 3/13.",4,Brilliant Or Repellant?

1600744,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B009O07NJS,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[0, 0]","The Comedy is a 2012 film directed by Rick Alverson. Starring Tim Heidecker as seedy hipster Swanson, it follow his vagrant meanderings across a Brooklyn summer landscape.I had no idea this had been made so it was nice surprise to see Heidecker's face as I was perusing the rental store.  Flipping the case, I saw Eric Wareheim and walked it straight to the checkout counter.  I'm a huge fan of their series, ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" and have often daydreamed about them inhabiting a project of some length.  And here it is.The Comedy is a strange, dismal film.  It opens with a slow-motion sequence of soiled, half-naked men dancing and pouring beer over each other.  Contrary to the title, this isn't particularly funny as much odd and unsettling and this moodiness sticks around for the duration.  And there's no fault found in this.  I sat down to watch the film but ended up mostly staring at it.  These are strange days and Alverson's take on, ""comedy"" certainly leans more towards the gallows than the ridiculousness of, say, Tim and Eric's Awesome Show, etc.  Which is interesting because I'd expected their lunacy and was a bit rattled to see how boiled down they were.  It took some getting used to but Heidecker played his part masterfully and I quickly fell in.The positives are profound.  Mainly, the dialogue needs trumpeting, here - it's written really well.  The scenes with Swanson's friends make for sensational cinema and his time spent with his passing women were moving, especially two of the boat scenes.  The man is lost and The Comedy mirrors that condition beautifully.  I was engrossed.I was also impressed with the music.  The first track heard is Donnie and Joe Emerson's, ""Baby"" which ends up being a dreamy pace car for a barrage of softly resonant, trippy songs.  At the risk of demeaning the meat of this film, I don't know if would have been as good without its soundtrack.  Look up the track listing and listen for yourself - it moves like a waterbed.Wrapped up, though, I think the only problem I'd have is in the replay value.  There is a bit of the everyday in what's being presented here and, aside from some startling scenes to carry some of the weight, it's not quite a life-altering cinematic experience.  I do believe it's worth the asking price, though, and if you're looking for something different, here you go: click and wait for your mailman.And I thank you for your time.- t",4,"Some hipsters, a seizure...",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2437,"['Comedy', '2012', 'film', 'directed', 'Rick', 'Alverson', 'Starring', 'Tim', 'Heidecker', 'seedy', 'hipster', 'Swanson', 'follow', 'vagrant', 'meanderings', 'Brooklyn', 'summer', 'landscape.I', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'see', 'Heidecker', 'face', 'was', 'perusing', 'rental', 'store', 'Flipping', 'case', 'saw', 'Eric', 'Wareheim', 'walked', 'straight', 'checkout', 'counter', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'Awesome', 'Show', 'Great', 'Job', 'have', 'often', 'daydreamed', 'inhabiting', 'project', 'length', 'here', 'is.The', 'Comedy', 'strange', 'dismal', 'film', 'slow-motion', 'sequence', 'soiled', 'half-naked', 'men', 'dancing', 'pouring', 'beer', 'other', 'Contrary', 'title', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'funny', 'much', 'odd', 'unsettling', 'moodiness', 'duration', 'fault', 'found', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'mostly', 'staring', 'are', 'strange', 'days', 'Alverson', 'take', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'more', 'gallows', 'ridiculousness', 'say', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'Awesome', 'Show', 'etc', 'Which', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'expected', 'lunacy', 'was', 'bit', 'rattled', 'see', 'how', 'boiled', 'down', 'were', 'took', 'getting', 'used', 'Heidecker', 'played', 'part', 'masterfully', 'quickly', 'fell', 'in.The', 'positives', 'are', 'profound', 'Mainly', 'dialogue', 'trumpeting', 'here', 'written', 'really', 'well', 'scenes', 'Swanson', 'friends', 'make', 'sensational', 'cinema', 'time', 'spent', 'passing', 'women', 'were', 'moving', 'especially', 'two', 'boat', 'scenes', 'man', 'lost', 'Comedy', 'mirrors', 'condition', 'beautifully', 'was', 'engrossed.I', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'music', 'first', 'track', 'heard', 'Donnie', 'Joe', 'Emerson', 'Baby', 'up', 'being', 'dreamy', 'pace', 'car', 'barrage', 'softly', 'resonant', 'trippy', 'songs', 'risk', 'demeaning', 'meat', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Look', 'up', 'track', 'listing', 'listen', 'waterbed.Wrapped', 'up', 'think', 'only', 'problem', ""'d"", 'have', 'replay', 'value', 'bit', 'everyday', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'here', 'aside', 'startling', 'scenes', 'carry', 'weight', 'not', 'quite', 'life-altering', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'do', 'believe', 'asking', 'price', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'here', 'go', 'click', 'wait', 'mailman.And', 'thank', 'time.-', 't']",N/A

I love how it pretty much is split up into vignettes while following this main character (played by Tim Heidecker), while also venturing into the world of these friends he hangs out with. They aren't your conventional friends you meet everyday; however they are, as disgusting as they can get(and quite comedic), unique characters in their own ways.

Definitely an adult film, drawing on bleak 70s neo-realist cinema for inspiration. Not an easy ride, but it has a lot of truth in it, and for that I found it quite appreciable.
