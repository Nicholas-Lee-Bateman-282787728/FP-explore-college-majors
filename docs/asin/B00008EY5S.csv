The slapstick scenes are impeccable, the comedy is brilliant and sharp, and the heartwrenching scenes are so well done!  It's the story of two sisters and their respective families - Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.  In true soap opera form in this first season someone is murdered, everyone seems to have an affair, several people have nervous breakdowns, somebody tries to quit the mob and gets drug back in, somebody goes into the hospital for a sex change, somebody finds out they were adopted,  impossible love rears its head several times, a couple of people are accused of murder, and many of the characters are blackmailed!  This doesn't even BEGIN to cover all that happens!SOAP moved at lightning speed doing what most soap operas take years to develop.  I watched it back in the days it was on, and I was afraid it would not hold up well.  Guess what?  It does!  SOAP was funny because of the characters not topical discussions.  Sure there are plenty of 70s touches - the costumes, the way the show looks, but it's still funny and moving.  The ensemble was unbeatable!The DVD gives you 22 episodes spread out over 3 discs.  No extras!  And this show begs for them.  It was the FIRST show to have a content warning before it aired, the first show with an openly gay character (Billy Crystal as Jody Dallas), and it's soooooo irreverant and politcally incorrect!  Black jokes, gay jokes, veteran jokes, talk about orgasms, talk about infidelity, talk about impotence, mental health issues, hookers, politicians -- I could go on and on with the tabboos this show broke!  It seems a little less sensational here in 2003, but it's still something special.  Too bad they didn't put more on the discs, but the show itself is well worth the price!

The show was opposed by many groups who thought its subject matter would be too mature for a prime-time audience. But Soap never overstepped its bounds, and the show became an instant smash hit with its brilliant and satirical spoofs of classic daytime programming. Sporting an all-star cast and talented producers, the show spawned successful spin-off Benson in 1979, a series that launched Robert Guillaume's career to a whole new level...Set in suburban Connecticut, Soap follows the lives of two sisters - Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond), a wealthy yet dim elitist, and Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon), a housewife in a more traditional blue-collar atmosphere. But regardless of their social station in life, neither woman manages to escape the scandal and intrigue surrounding a typical soap opera family. Jessica's daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) is smitten with a priest, yet they are both having an affair with the same tennis pro. Meanwhile, Jessica and her husband Chester (Robert Mandan) incessantly cheat on one another. As for the other side of the family, Mary's husband Burt (Richard Mulligan) is certifiably insane, her son Danny (Ted Wass) is a mobster, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an out-of-the-closet homosexual, and all of them are caught up in a family filled with promiscuous infidelities and quite possibly murder! Throw in the insubordinate and sarcastic Tate butler Benson (Guillaume), and Soap holds its own as one of the funniest sitcoms in TV history...The Soap (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which the audience learns the background of the two differing, yet similar, families. Jessica overhears Chester making plans to meet his mistress just before she meets her own lover, a local tennis pro named Peter. Jessica leaves Peter just before Corinne arrives for a lesson of her own... Meanwhile, the Campbells are beset by a rift between Danny and Burt, and Burt reveals to Mary that his inability to perform in the bedroom is a result of guilt from having killed her first husband... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include Episode 4 in which Jessica and Corrine encounter each other in Peter's apartment, and Episode 25 in which Charles Lefkowitz (Sorrell Booke of Dukes of Hazzard fame) orders Danny to marry Elaine or else he will kill the entire Campbell family...The DVD Report",5,Absolutely hilarious!,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2578,"['Nominated', '17', 'Emmys', 'short', 'four-year', 'run', 'Soap', 'premiered', 'Fall', '1977', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'shows', 'American', 'television', 'history', 'single', 'episode', 'ever', 'aired', 'show', 'was', 'opposed', 'many', 'groups', 'who', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'mature', 'prime-time', 'audience', 'Soap', 'never', 'overstepped', 'bounds', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'smash', 'hit', 'brilliant', 'satirical', 'spoofs', 'classic', 'daytime', 'programming', 'Sporting', 'all-star', 'cast', 'talented', 'producers', 'show', 'spawned', 'successful', 'spin-off', 'Benson', '1979', 'series', 'launched', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'career', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Set', 'suburban', 'Connecticut', 'Soap', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'wealthy', 'yet', 'dim', 'elitist', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'Cathryn', 'Damon', 'housewife', 'more', 'traditional', 'blue-collar', 'atmosphere', 'regardless', 'social', 'station', 'life', 'woman', 'escape', 'scandal', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'typical', 'soap', 'opera', 'family', 'Jessica', 'daughter', 'Corrine', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'smitten', 'priest', 'yet', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'same', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Meanwhile', 'Jessica', 'husband', 'Chester', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'incessantly', 'cheat', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'son', 'Danny', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'mobster', 'stepson', 'Jodie', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'out-of-the-closet', 'homosexual', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'family', 'filled', 'promiscuous', 'infidelities', 'quite', 'possibly', 'murder', 'Throw', 'insubordinate', 'sarcastic', 'Tate', 'butler', 'Benson', 'Guillaume', 'Soap', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'history', 'Soap', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'audience', 'background', 'two', 'differing', 'yet', 'similar', 'families', 'Jessica', 'Chester', 'making', 'plans', 'meet', 'mistress', 'just', 'own', 'lover', 'local', 'tennis', 'pro', 'named', 'Peter', 'Jessica', 'Peter', 'just', 'before', 'Corinne', 'lesson', 'own', 'Meanwhile', 'Campbells', 'are', 'beset', 'rift', 'Danny', 'Burt', 'Burt', 'reveals', 'Mary', 'inability', 'perform', 'bedroom', 'result', 'guilt', 'having', 'killed', 'first', 'husband', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Episode', '4', 'Jessica', 'Corrine', 'encounter', 'other', 'Peter', 'apartment', 'Episode', '25', 'Charles', 'Lefkowitz', 'Sorrell', 'Booke', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'fame', 'orders', 'Danny', 'marry', 'Elaine', 'else', 'will', 'kill', 'entire', 'Campbell', 'family', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I first heard about ""Soap"" from my parents, who saw it when it was first shown on television, 30 years ago. Based on their recommendation, I purchased the first season on DVD and found that it is far funnier than many of the first-run comedies that are currently being shown on TV, and that it hasn't dated at all.""Soap"" is a parody of soap operas, but unlike other soap opera parodies, such as ""Tootsie"" or ""Grosse Pointe"", where the story centers on the behind the scenes antics of the actors in a fictional soap opera and the humour arises from those antics, not from the soap opera itself, ""Soap"" is written as an actual soap opera, which follows all of the usual soap opera conventions, and the humour arises from the exaggeration and parodying of these conventions. Basically, ""Soap"" does to soap operas what ""The Naked Gun"" did to police movies.Much of ""Soap""'s brilliance is due to its perfect casting of the leads. Each actor is excellent in his or her role and it is not surprising that a large number of them later went onto bigger and better things. These actors include Richard Mulligan (as the nervous and occasionally invisible Burt Campbell), Katherine Helmond (as the perpetually cheerful Jessica Tate), Robert Guillaume (as Benson the objectionable butler who looks after the Tates) and Billy Crystal (as Jodie the suicidal homosexual - the first openly gay character on television).This DVD set contains the 25 episodes of season one, which end with a soap opera-esque cliffhanger that will leave you eager to move on to season two.",5,Still frothing after 30 years,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,1694,"['Soap', 'story', 'Tates', 'Campbells', 'two', 'typical', 'soap', 'opera', 'families', 'typical', 'soap', 'opera', 'problems', 'not', 'so', 'typical', 'first', 'heard', 'Soap', 'parents', 'who', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'television', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Based', 'recommendation', 'purchased', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'found', 'far', 'funnier', 'many', 'first-run', 'comedies', 'are', 'currently', 'being', 'shown', 'TV', ""n't"", 'dated', 'Soap', 'parody', 'soap', 'operas', 'other', 'soap', 'opera', 'parodies', 'such', 'Tootsie', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'where', 'story', 'centers', 'scenes', 'antics', 'actors', 'fictional', 'soap', 'opera', 'humour', 'arises', 'antics', 'not', 'soap', 'opera', 'Soap', 'written', 'actual', 'soap', 'opera', 'usual', 'soap', 'opera', 'conventions', 'humour', 'exaggeration', 'parodying', 'conventions', 'Basically', 'Soap', 'soap', 'operas', 'what', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'did', 'police', 'movies.Much', 'Soap', 'brilliance', 'due', 'perfect', 'casting', 'leads', 'actor', 'excellent', 'role', 'not', 'surprising', 'large', 'number', 'later', 'went', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'actors', 'include', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'nervous', 'occasionally', 'invisible', 'Burt', 'Campbell', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'perpetually', 'cheerful', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Benson', 'objectionable', 'butler', 'who', 'Tates', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Jodie', 'suicidal', 'homosexual', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'character', 'television', 'DVD', 'set', '25', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'end', 'soap', 'opera-esque', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'leave', 'eager', 'move', 'season', 'two']",N/A

740491,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00008EY5S,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","In the annals of television history, ""Soap"" ranks as one of the most outrageous sitcoms ever aired on an American network. Ribald, over the top, whimsical, and with the potential to offend large segments of society, ""Soap"" handily lived up to each of these elements and more. But most importantly the show about two wacko families living lives of utter weirdness was incredibly hilarious. I was a mere seven years old when the program appeared in the late 1970s, but I did remember bits and pieces of the show since my parents let me watch it with them. I know; I can't believe they let a youngster view a program like this one, but they rightly figured that my tender age prevented me from understanding the adult themes behind the comedy. Of course, you didn't need to understand much to laugh at the physical machinations of Richard Mulligan. When I finally saw a few episodes on cable a few years back, I finally understood what the ruckus was all about. I usually avoid watching television nowadays, but I put ""Soap"" right up there with ""The Rockford Files"" as my two favorite network shows. It's great to see the former arrive on DVD.""Soap"" is the story of two related families. The wealthy Tate clan, headed by ditzy Jessica (Katherine Helmond) and the lecherous Chester (Robert Mandan), contain enough cranks to populate a mental asylum. Daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) spends her days at home and her nights sleeping with her mother's tennis instructor, at least when she isn't romantically pursuing a Catholic priest. Other daughter Eunice is a big shot reporter in a suspect relationship with a Congressman. Jessica's father, known as The Major (Arthur Peterson), is a World War II veteran who simply can't let go of his wartime experiences largely due to his fading mental state. The only normal person in the family--and that's saying a lot--is son Billy (Jimmy Baio), whose concerns involve dating girls and staying out of the way of his wacky family. Fortunately, the Tate's butler Benson DuBois (Robert Guillaume) serves as a sort of comedic relief to the constant shenanigans by snubbing the cheating Chester and protecting the hapless Jessica from the horrors of the family's activities. The Tate family isn't merely dysfunctional; the psychiatric profession came up with the term after watching this show.Jessica's sister Mary (Cathryn Damon) heads up her own family, the Campbells. As strange as the Tate's are, they simply cannot hold a candle to this agglomeration of oddities. Mary married husband Burt (Richard Mulligan) after her first husband perished in an accident. Her two sons live at home with the couple. There's Jody Dallas (Billy Crystal), a man struggling with his sexuality and his relationship to a star professional quarterback. Brother Danny (Ted Wass) thinks his brother's joking when he claims to like men, but he's got problems of his own. Danny is mixed up in the Mafia, and when the Godfather (Richard Libertini) tells him someone he knows murdered his father, Danny seeks revenge as condition for leaving organized crime behind. The best addition to the Campbell household doesn't arrive for a few episodes, but once they do the show took on a dimension of craziness rarely witnessed on television. Burt's son by his previous wife, Chuck (Jay Johnson) and his dummy Bob arrive from Hawaii to stay with the family. Problem is, Chuck thinks Bob is real and acts accordingly by taking the mannequin with him everywhere he goes. Soon, everyone around them can't help but fall into thinking the dummy is real too. It's hilarious.I'm not even going to get into a full exposition of the various twists and turns each character goes through during the course of the first season. Instead, I'm going to throw out a few of my favorite situations and scenes and let it go at that:1) Burt prancing around a cabin in the woods while wearing a bear rug.2) The whole first season moves toward a denouement where Jessica Tate takes the fall for a murder. Witness the scene where Police Chief Tinkler (Gordon Jump) arrives at her home to question both families about the crime. He methodically interviews each member and discovers that nearly every one of them is so weird, possesses so many mental and emotional hang-ups, that they are all suspects.3)  Jessica's lawyer decides to interview both families so he can create a list of potential character witnesses on her behalf. Again, everyone is so out of bounds that he can't find one family member to take the stand.4) Veteran character actor William Daniels appears in one episode as Heinrich Himmel, a Gestapo like investigator determined to solve the murder. His lines are classic dialogue: ""Please to put the toy away"" and ""ARE YOU JODY? DO YOU LOOK LIKE JODY? DO YOU SOUND LIKE JODY?"" had me laughing for hours afterwards. I'm laughing now just remembering them.5) Burt's reaction when he opens the refrigerator and sees Chuck's dummy stuffed inside.6) Danny's rabbi disguise and conversation with the Mafia goons.Obviously, there are many amusing scenes in this wonderful DVD set. Seeing them all together in chronological order is an interesting experience. The earliest episodes are the least amusing because creator Susan Harris and crew had to establish the characters first. Benson plays a crucial role in the beginning with many one-liners and wisecracks until we learn to recognize the traits of the cast. It's difficult to pick the best actors in ""Soap,"" but special mention goes to Helmond and Mulligan. Jessica Tate's ditzy ramblings are jaw dropping to behold, and Burt Campbell's increasingly loony theatrics steal every scene he's in. If you're a fan of the show, you already have this and the second season collection. If you're not a fan, you will be as soon as you watch this completely insane show.",5,A gem in the vast wasteland,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,5802,"['annals', 'television', 'history', 'Soap',

This is a great three CD set with the whole first season on it. It goes from when both Coren and Jessica are 'taking tennis lessons' with Peter, through Danny's running from the mob and hooking up with Elaine and Bert's stint with invisibility.Soap hit just about every controversial subject known to society at a time when that had not really been done before - and it has never been done as well since.  If you have never seen Soap, it is the story of two sisters - Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell ... and their families. Jessica is married to Chester who is a securities man and is sleeping with anything that will stand still long enough. Jessica (who later played Mona on Who's The Boss) plays a dim but beautiful wife and a loving mother to two daughters, Coren and Uness, and one son, Billy. Both girls have a thing for impossible love affairs.  In season one, Coren is in love with a priest and Uness with a married senator.  Billy is the only normal one there though at fourteen he asks for the keys to `park' the car with his girlfriend and Jessica gives them to him although she doesn't understand because the car is already parked.  Benson (Robert Guilllame) is the only one holding the family together. As the butler and the cook, he has some great lines as his undisguised contempt for Chester comes through loud and clear.  Oh, and I almost forgot about Jessica's dad, the Major. World War II is still going on strong in his head as keeps kidnapping and interrogating the neighbors as German spies.If you can't already see the potential, meet the Campbells.  Mary, Jessica's sister (remember this is the story of two sisters), is married to Bert (played by Mulligan).  Bert owns a construction firm building skyscrapers.  He is also impotent.  But that is just because he killed Mary's first husband, unbeknownst to her.  Mary has two sons - Danny and Joey (Billy Crystal).  Danny wants to stop working for the mob but has to first kill the man  who killed his father ... and just when they were finally getting along! Joey is gay and is in love with Dennis Phillips, a popular quarterback who is afraid that public knowledge of his homosexuality will spoil his endorsement possibilities. Bert has two sons also ... well, three if you count the dummy, Bob. Chuck is a ventriloquist from Hawaii who has a stormy and argumentative relationship with his smart-ass dummy, Bob.  Bert's long lost son, Peter is the same tennis instructor who  is ""giving lessons"" to Jessica and Coren.Confused?

This show had me laughing out loud alot, which is something that I hadn't experienced much on recent TV shows. Soap received much controversy back when it premiered in 1977, but the controversy weared off after it became a big hit. This is worth seeing to catch Billy Crystal in one of his early acting roles as Jodie. But the rest of the cast is great.

An avid fan of the show since it originally aired in the 70's, I own the series on VHS but am estatic about the DVD release for a few reasons.  Not only do I look forward to selecting which episodes to watch over and over again, ANY extras will just be icing on this delicious cake.  But beyond that, having Season One on DVD means that there's a commitment to releasing future seasons of this quinti-sensational laugh-riot-of-a-comedy.  Now I know what my friends are getting for Christmas this year!Ruthlessly funny and irreverent, SOAP was like a breath of fresh air when it first made its network appearance 25 years ago.  My best friend and I would literally watch each episode together - eithe rin person or on the phone, mostly to share the immediacy of the funniest gags we'd ever scene, but also to ensure one of us would remember all the lines the next day.  With a cast of characters that quite honestly DEFINED the word CHARACTERS ""Soap"" ranks as the funniest comedy series of the past 40 years, perhaps ever.  Up there with ""I Love Lucy"" each episode guarantees a laugh - guffaws and belly grabbing are a given.  Few series have ever combined wit and wisdom the way SOAP did.  Sure - it introduced prime time's first ""out"" gay character (Jodie, the incomparable Billy Crystal) but no show has even come close to creating some of the other situations you'll find here!A demon baby?  YEP, why not, when a fallen priest (Father Tim) hooks up with the ... daughter Corinne.A talking grapefruit?  Sure...if you're imitating one crazy sibling's unique attachment to a ventriloquist dummy named Bob.A mother in lust with her daughter's lover (and tennis coach)?  Trust me, Lifetime never had it this good.How about murder?  Alien Abductions?  A gay quarterback?  An all-knowing scene-stealing butler (the one and only BENSON)?  Yep, they're all here.  And Richard Mulligan - the late great and brilliant comedian who forever channelled the character of Burt -is absolutely the funniest TV dad you'll ever meet.  You can keep Bill Cosby - gimme BURT any day!  And Katherine Helmond, whose bust and boundless sex-kittenish turn as Jessica Tate made her a TV staple - is an absolute joy.SOAP was - and remains - a series that breaks the rules and still works.

It's amazing what they did manage to get away with! I was really too young to clearly remember the pop culture of the '70s, but were things more liberal and less PC-minded than now? Granted, some of the situations are a bit dated now...I don't think that TV could get away with portraying 'a gay son' in so many stereotypical situations...or (probably) get away with The Black Manservant, etc.Having said that, both Billy Crystal (as Jody the gay son) and Robert Guillaume (as the great Benson the man servant) bring humor and dignity to their roles, which I guess was intentional by the script material they were given. I think the intention of the creators of the show was not just to poke fun at the soap opera  genre, but to put a magnifying glass on the stereotypes that abounded both on screen and in life.I was very disappointed at the total lack of extras in this DVD set, which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. No commentaries...no interviews...the only 'extras' are 4 useless commercials/trailers. Given that this series had a lot of historical significance in TV culture, this oversight is a shame. The picture quality is nothing to praise - fuzzy picture, occasional color shifts - but I could live with that if only they had included some extras. (The bad picture quality problem seems to be shared by many sitcoms from the '70s and '80s, with rare exceptions like the beautifully transferred Mary Tyler Moore season 1 DVD set.)Even without the extras though, this series is highly recommended on its merits alone.",4,This series is still sharp and funny,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,1658,"['remember', 'watching', 'series', 'reruns', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Much', 'humor', 'now', 'realize', 'was', 'way', 'head', 'amazing', 'what', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'young', 'clearly', 'remember', 'pop', 'culture', ""'70s"", 'were', 'things', 'more', 'liberal', 'less', 'PC-minded', 'now', 'Granted', 'situations', 'are', 'bit', 'dated', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'TV', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'portraying', 'gay', 'son', 'so', 'many', 'stereotypical', 'situations', 'probably', 'get', 'away', 'Black', 'Manservant', 'etc.Having', 'said', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Jody', 'gay', 'son', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'great', 'Benson', 'man', 'servant', 'bring', 'humor', 'dignity', 'roles', 'guess', 'was', 'intentional', 'script', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'think', 'intention', 'creators', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'poke', 'fun', 'soap', 'opera', 'genre', 'put', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'stereotypes', 'abounded', 'screen', 'life.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'total', 'lack', 'extras', 'DVD', 'set', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'only', 'are', '4', 'useless', 'commercials/trailers', 'Given', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'historical', 'significance', 'TV', 'culture', 'oversight', 'shame', 'picture', 'quality', 'nothing', 'praise', 'fuzzy', 'picture', 'occasional', 'color', 'shifts', 'could', 'live', 'only', 'had', 'included', 'extras', 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'problem', 'be', 'shared', 'many', 'sitcoms', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'rare', 'exceptions', 'beautifully', 'transferred', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'Even', 'extras', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'merits', 'alone']",N/A

740500,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B00008EY5S,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[9, 13]","This is the story of two sisters, Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.  Jessica lives in a neighborhood known as rich.  Jessica likes life.  The only thing about life she would change, if she could, is that she would set it all to music.  The Tates have more secrets than they do money.  We're approaching Mary Campbell's house.  Mary too likes life. Unfortunately, life doesn't seem to be too crazy about her.  As you can see, the Campbell's don't have nearly as much money as the Tates, but they do however have as many secrets.This is the original opening for the groundbreaking Soap.The following is a summary of all twenty five episodes:Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) is married to Chester (Robert Mandan) who has embezzled money from his clients and slept with every woman he could.

Also living with Jessica is her and Mary's father who is still battling WWII.  Benson (Robert Guillame) is the butler with an attitude (Door bell rings and he looks at Jessica and says ""Do you expect me to get that?"").Mary Campbell's (Catherine Damon) first husband died in a construction accident.  What she doesn't know is that her second husband  Burt (Richard Mulligan) pushed her first husband off the skyscraper!  Mary has two sons Danny (Ted Wass) who works for the mafia and Jodie (Billy Crystal) who is gay and seeing a pro quarterback.

Danny goes to see Mr. Lefkowitz to get the contract on him cancelled but winds up with his daughter Elaine (Dinah Manoff).Corrine meets Ingrid.

Everyone waits for Jessica's verdict.  Mallu tells Jessica he loves her.  The verdict is in but who killed Peter Campbell.These are on three discs with ten episodes on first two discs and five on the last, which of course doesn't make sense but that's the way it is.  The video to DVD transfer is not the best but it is only slightly offsetting.While some of the writing is dated, it is because it was the first in many ways.  The best things in the series are Katherine Helmond and Robert Guillame.  Just like all the men in the series, you just fall in love with Jessica.  And Benson is the butler that everyone wanted.  The funny thing about Benson is he got younger during the series.  He we referred to as being with the family forever but as the series went on his hair went from grey to natural.  He got younger!",5,Taboo no longer,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,7929,"['story', 'two', 'sisters', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'Jessica', 'neighborhood', 'known', 'rich', 'Jessica', 'life',

740502,A1CX86CO1MH5II,B00008EY5S,P. Solinger,"[44, 46]","What can I say about this groundbreaking hit TV show from 1977 that other reviewers haven't already said?  This is an excellent, hilarious soap opera spoof that focuses on two familes whose only link is the matriachs, Jessica and Mary, two sisters.  Well, Jessica is also sleeping with Mary's stepson, so I guess there are more links.  Several funny storylines are woven together in this first season, culiminating with a classic murder mystery that stretches for twelve of the 25 episodes.This is definitely a five star TV show, but the DVD production is severely lacking.  Not only are a couple of episodes edited, as previously reported, but there are no extras to speak of (unless you count movie trailers).

I spent most of this past weekend watching all 25 episodes and I can't wait to watch it again.  This is truly a comedy classic. Could they get away with some of this stuff today? Not a chance! And that's a shame, because 'Soap' contains some of the funniest dialog you'll ever hear. (And, some of the most touching.) To careen from pure buffoonery to heart wrenching emotion and back to slap-stick, while keeping it solidly entrenched with the characters and situations, is pure genious. The cast is outstanding, and the guest stars terrific. (Harold Gould is memorable as Barney Gerber as is Gordon Jump as Sheriff Tinkler.) But, to me, Richard Mulligan and Katherine Helmond make this show.  No one, and I mean no one, was funnier than Mulligan as Burt Campbell.  An elastic face and a slap-stick mentality carried him over the top and back again. Helmond, as Jessica Tate drifted seamlessly between screwball and martyr.Now, why only four stars?  Easy. The other comments about poor color transfer and lack of features/bonus material are right on the money.  I know that you can pick this 3 disc set up for $20 brand new and right off the shelf, but this show was too important to give it such short shrift. It broke ground that no one else dared to tread. And that ground still remains largely untouched in the PC world of television that exists today. Either way, buy it, rent it, borrow it, hey... even steal it.

740509,A1DUIWDZCNJIHA,B00008EY5S,"Slade Simon ""slade37""","[18, 19]","Back in 1977, this show was very controversal. It is somewhat tame by today's standards, but the humor still works. It's just less likely to offend people. This show is a soap satire. It is a comedy soap opera. This was the first series to have a cliffhanger at the end of each season. It might have been the first series with a non-stereotypical homosexual male. ...although Jody Dallas (Billy Crystal) is almost a stereotype at first. The plot of each episode can get as insane as the daily soap operas. Soap lasted 4 seasons with a 5th season planned. There was a spin-off, Benson, which had one episode that was used to tie-up the loose ends.The series focuses on two sisters, Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) and Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon). Jessica and Chester (Robert Mandan) are the rich couple. Jessica can be a little slow-witted at times during the comic moments. Chester is a stockbroker who is always cheating on Jessica. Mary and Burt (Richard Mulligan) aren't rich, but they have their share of troubles too. The Major (Arthur Peterson), Jessica's and Mary's dad, still believes World War II is going on. There is plenty more, but I'm only sticking to what's established at the very beginning. I don't want to spoil anything.In response to a previous review, the summary of past events at the start of each episode may mention something or use clips that happened a few episodes earlier. It reminds you of what you need to know for the episode about to be shown. I remember the scene the reviewer claims was missing.Burt Campbell and Jessica Tate are my personal favorites in the series. Other characters improve as the series progresses. Danny Dallas (Ted Wass) becomes more of an idiot in later episodes.I wish the box for this set was more sturdy like the box Fox uses for The Simpsons. There are also no cutouts in the outside case to help you grab the insert to get the discs out. I keep thinking I'm going to tear the box when I try to pull the DVDs out. The first couple of times I had trouble getting the insert that holds the DVDs out. It does begin to come out easier each time.None of the Columbia/TriStar DVDs of old TV shows seem to have  many extras. The most you can expect are previews related to something about the show. This Soap set has an ad for other retro TV DVD sets and a trailer for America's Sweetheart (because Billy Crystal stars in it).TRIVIA BITS:Rod Roddy of The Price Is Right (""Come On Down!"") provided the narration at the beginning and ending of each episode.Richard Mulligan is also known for his role in Empty Nest.Katherine Helmond also starred on Who's The Boss and has appeared more recently on Everybody Loves Raymond as Lois.Robert Mandan appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in ""Cardassians.""",4,Great TV Show Finally On DVD,1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,2755,"['Back', '1977', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'controversal', 'somewhat', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'humor', 'still', 'just', 'less', 'likely', 'offend', 'people', 'show', 'soap', 'satire', 'comedy', 'soap', 'opera', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'have', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'series', 'non-stereotypical', 'homosexual', 'male', 'Jody', 'Dallas', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'almost', 'stereotype', 'first', 'plot', 'episode', 'can', 'get', 'as', 'insane', 'daily', 'soap', 'operas', 'Soap', 'lasted', '4', 'seasons', '5th', 'season', 'planned', 'was', 'spin-off', 'Benson', 'had', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'used', 'tie-up', 'loose', 'ends.The', 'series', 'two', 'sisters', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'Cathryn', 'Damon', 'Jessica', 'Chester', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'are', 'rich', 'couple', 'Jessica', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'slow-witted', 'times', 'comic', 'moments', 'Chester', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'always', 'cheating', 'Jessica', 'Mary', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'are', ""n't"", 'rich', 'have', 'share', 'troubles', 'too', 'Major', 'Arthur', 'Peterson', 'Jessica', 'Mary', 'dad', 'still', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'going', 'plenty', 'more', ""'m"", 'only', 'sticking', 'what', 'established', 'very', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything.In', 'response', 'previous', 'review', 'summary', 'past', 'events', 'start', 'episode', 'may', 'mention', 'something', 'use', 'clips', 'happened', 'few', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'episode', 'be', 'shown', 'remember', 'scene', 'reviewer', 'claims', 'was', 'missing.Burt', 'Campbell', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'are', 'personal', 'favorites', 'series', 'Other', 'characters', 'improve', 'series', 'Danny', 'Dallas', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'more', 'idiot', 'later', 'episodes.I', 'wish', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'more', 'sturdy', 'box', 'Fox', 'Simpsons', 'are', 'also', 'cutouts', 'outside', 'case', 'help', 'grab', 'insert', 'get', 'discs', 'keep', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'going', 'tear', 'box', 'when', 'try', 'pull', 'DVDs', 'out', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'insert', 'DVDs', 'out', 'begin', 'come', 'out', 'easier', 'time.None', 'Columbia/TriStar', 'DVDs', 'old', 'TV', 'seem', 'have', 'many', 'extras', 'most', 'can', 'expect', 'are', 'previews', 'related', 'something', 'show', 'Soap', 'set', 'ad', 'other', 'retro', 'TV', 'DVD', 'sets', 'trailer', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'BITS', 'Rod', 'Roddy', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'Come', 'Down', 'provided', 'narration', 'beginning', 'ending', 'episode.Richard', 'Mulligan', 'also', 'known', 'role', 'Empty', 'Nest.Katherine', 'Helmond', 'also', 'starred', 'Who', 'Boss', 'appeared', 'more', 'recently', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Lois.Robert', 'Mandan', 'appeared', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Cardassians']",N/A

Religious groups complained the series had no morals as it dealt with satanism, homosexuality, extra-marital affairs and more. All the hoopla dyed down after the first few episodes aired and &#34;Soap&#34; would go on to become a huge hit for ABC following &#34;Three's Company&#34; on Tuesday nights, garnering multiple Emmys and making its stars household names especially Billy Crystal.The first season, undoubtedly, was its best as series creator Susan Harris (best known for her work on &#34;The Golden Girls&#34; several years later) wrote every script and used all the melodramatic elements that made daytime serials a hit and throwing her own dash of humor in for good measure. The first year dealt with the character of Peter Campbell, played by a then-unknown sexy Robert Urich, who slept with any female with a pulse. His death near the end of the season led to a cliffhanger as he was severely murdered and viewers wondered who killed him? Both mother and daughter Jessica and Eunice were having an affair with the tennis pro so they seemed to be the most likely suspects.Other stories revolved around Danny Dallas (portrayed by sexy Ted Waas) and his determination to get out of the crime syndicate, his brother Jodie's confusing state of homosexuality (he would later sleep with a woman and have a child with her.....OK) and Chester's (Jessica's husband) philandering.Time magazine panned the series in 1977 but in 2007 declared &#34;Soap&#34; as one of TV's &#34;best series of all-time&#34;!",5,"""In Reality a Prime Time Soap With a Comedic Edge""",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1658,"['September', '1977', 'Fred', 'Silverman', 'premiered', 'new', 'sitcom/drama', 'called', '34', 'Soap', '34', 'single', 'show', 'aired', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'sitcom', 'Religious', 'groups', 'complained', 'series', 'had', 'morals', 'satanism', 'homosexuality', 'extra-marital', 'affairs', 'more', 'hoopla', 'dyed', 'down', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'aired', '34', 'Soap', '34', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'huge', 'hit', 'ABC', 'following', '34', 'Three', 'Company', '34', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'garnering', 'multiple', 'Emmys', 'making', 'stars', 'household', 'names', 'especially', 'Billy', 'Crystal.The', 'first', 'season', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'best', 'series', 'creator', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'best', 'known', 'work', '34', 'Golden', 'Girls', '34', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'wrote', 'script', 'used', 'melodramatic', 'elements', 'made', 'daytime', 'serials', 'hit', 'throwing', 'own', 'dash', 'humor', 'good', 'measure', 'first', 'year', 'dealt', 'character', 'Peter', 'Campbell', 'played', 'then-unknown', 'sexy', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'who', 'slept', 'female', 'pulse', 'death', 'end', 'season', 'led', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'severely', 'murdered', 'viewers', 'wondered', 'who', 'killed', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'Eunice', 'were', 'having', 'affair', 'tennis', 'pro', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'likely', 'suspects.Other', 'stories', 'revolved', 'Danny', 'Dallas', 'portrayed', 'sexy', 'Ted', 'Waas', 'determination', 'get', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'brother', 'Jodie', 'confusing', 'state', 'homosexuality', 'would', 'later', 'sleep', 'woman', 'have', 'child', '..OK', 'Chester', 'Jessica', 'husband', 'philandering.Time', 'magazine', 'panned', 'series', '1977', '2007', 'declared', '34', 'Soap', '34', 'one', 'TV', '34', 'best', 'series', 'all-time', '34']",N/A
