Detonator II is not quite up to the quality of the original even though the team is the same, but for the price you can't beat this combo.  Detonator II runs a lot like those Jean-Claude Van Damme direct to video movies he's made recently or some of the Jackie Chan direct to video offerings.  The worst part of D II for me was the music.  The sound track is like a cheap porno flick.  Still Brosnan is good in both.  Alexandra Paul (remember her from Baywatch?) is cute in both.  Detonator, the original, is a good movie and it's weaved and paced better than D II.  Both were shot square screen (USA Television helped produce it).  Both are based on novels (Death Train and Night Watch).  Detonator, the original, has better music and a better cast.  This is like most movies with Roman Numerals.  Under Siege was great and Under Siege II lacked.  Ghostbusters was great and Ghostbusters II lacked.  48 Hours was great and Another 48 Hours lacked.  Jurassic Park was great and Jurassic Park II lacked.  This follows in the same tradition but for the PRICE you can't beat it. Why buy one when for a little more you can get two!",4,Double Trouble,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,1170,"['Most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'right', 'Detonator', 'II', 'not', 'quite', 'quality', 'original', 'even', 'team', 'same', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'combo', 'Detonator', 'II', 'lot', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'direct', 'video', 'movies', 'made', 'recently', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'direct', 'video', 'offerings', 'worst', 'part', 'D', 'II', 'was', 'music', 'sound', 'track', 'cheap', 'porno', 'flick', 'Still', 'Brosnan', 'good', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'remember', 'Baywatch', 'cute', 'Detonator', 'original', 'good', 'movie', 'weaved', 'paced', 'better', 'D', 'II', 'were', 'shot', 'square', 'screen', 'USA', 'Television', 'helped', 'produce', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Death', 'Train', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Detonator', 'original', 'better', 'music', 'better', 'cast', 'most', 'movies', 'Roman', 'Numerals', 'Siege', 'was', 'great', 'Siege', 'II', 'lacked', 'Ghostbusters', 'was', 'great', 'Ghostbusters', 'II', 'lacked', '48', 'Hours', 'was', 'great', '48', 'Hours', 'lacked', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'was', 'great', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'II', 'lacked', 'same', 'tradition', 'PRICE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Why', 'buy', 'one', 'when', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'get', 'two']",N/A

Davison,"[0, 0]","I always loved these movies and they could have gone so much further with the characters but two is all they made, shame but James Bond happened for Pierce Brosnan. Lets be honest Alexandra Paul is nothing but gorgeous. Both actors actually work well together shame they put Patrick Stewart in the first one as he was really miscast, the role wasn't him and you feel he is just getting through as easily as possible. William Devane in the second is much better and enjoyable.I actually bought this double movie set even though I had the first already but it was actually almost half the price of the second movie on its own.These are comfortable easy to watch movies without to much gratuity or sex in them in fact none of that so its safe for lots of reasons.But we have to ask what was Brosnan thinking with the little goatee beard and moustache in the second one, maybe he fancied himself as Errol Flynn?",5,I love these movies,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,907,"['always', 'loved', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'further', 'characters', 'two', 'made', 'shame', 'James', 'Bond', 'happened', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'be', 'honest', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'nothing', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'actually', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'shame', 'put', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'miscast', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'feel', 'just', 'getting', 'as', 'easily', 'possible', 'William', 'Devane', 'second', 'much', 'better', 'enjoyable.I', 'actually', 'bought', 'double', 'movie', 'set', 'even', 'had', 'first', 'already', 'was', 'actually', 'almost', 'price', 'second', 'movie', 'own.These', 'are', 'comfortable', 'easy', 'watch', 'movies', 'much', 'gratuity', 'sex', 'fact', 'none', 'safe', 'lots', 'reasons.But', 'have', 'ask', 'what', 'was', 'Brosnan', 'thinking', 'little', 'goatee', 'beard', 'moustache', 'second', 'one', 'maybe', 'fancied', 'Errol', 'Flynn']",N/A
