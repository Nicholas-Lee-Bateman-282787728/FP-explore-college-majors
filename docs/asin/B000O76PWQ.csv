It doesn't matter, whatever you have is more than the budget of this entire movie. I understand the constraints of the low budget horror movie, like you can't have real actors, so you use your friends. You can't afford a real camera, so you use a camcorder. And why build sets when you can just find a place and shoot. This movie sucks, and I liked it a lot. Why you ask? Because these people took all they had and just had fun with it. This movie had to of been shot over a long period of time because one of the actors had a beard and braces and then in another scene they disappeared. There were many things like this going on that were just so ridiculous you couldn't help but laugh. It's an Evil Dead like movie that is nowhere near as good, but still has some nice (sometimes obviously fake) gore and tons of laughs. It's nothing great, but it really wasn't meant to be. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I am proud to put it in my collection.

One scene shows a puppet's head being ripped off with fake looking syrup. This was suppose to be a human person and the syrup was suppose to be blood.A young looking guy with a beard plays an old man.

I tell you what to expect : a lot of bloody freaking fun !! If you can stand micro budget movie making that is. Some people are turned off by the lack of production values ? Too bad for them, they are definitely missing something here.To me that flick has everything it needs : a forest, a camp, a lake, a bunch of demonic zombies and A LOT of gore ( I'm talking about entrails and body parts all over the place ). Plus it really is funny and even mannages to be sort of scary at times.It has a basic effective EVIL DEAD like plot : some partying teens go to some cabin in the woods... some of them get possessed by the forest's  evil spirits and start to attack and eat their friends. It is well shot : the photography and angles beautifully exploit the landscape and the action. By the way, it moves fast, hand in hand with the top notch editing. That movie delivers the goods and then some and I think most gorehounds will agree. Don't pay attention to the fools who fast forward through the movies they review and hate( ain't that a shame ? ).If you crave for laughs, gore and scares, if you love movies like DEMONS, EVIL DEAD or SAVAGE HARVEST and can stand no budget flicks ( I'm talking about video shooting and amateurish acting here ): then what the hell are you doing reading this review ? Just buy the damn thing !! Thanks to BRIAN SINGLETON and his friends for the crazy ride, I sure will keep an eye on these folks.",4,SAVAGE HARVEST OF THE EVIL DEAD  ON ACID !!,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1522,"['are', 'so', 'few', 'reviews', 'movie', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'tell', 'what', 'expect', 'lot', 'bloody', 'freaking', 'fun', 'can', 'stand', 'micro', 'budget', 'movie', 'making', 'people', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'lack', 'production', 'values', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'definitely', 'missing', 'something', 'here.To', 'flick', 'everything', 'forest', 'camp', 'lake', 'bunch', 'demonic', 'zombies', 'LOT', 'gore', ""'m"", 'talking', 'entrails', 'body', 'parts', 'place', 'really', 'funny', 'even', 'mannages', 'be', 'sort', 'scary', 'times.It', 'basic', 'effective', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'plot', 'partying', 'teens', 'go', 'cabin', 'woods', 'get', 'possessed', 'forest', 'evil', 'spirits', 'start', 'attack', 'eat', 'friends', 'well', 'shot', 'photography', 'angles', 'beautifully', 'exploit', 'landscape', 'action', 'way', 'fast', 'hand', 'hand', 'top', 'notch', 'editing', 'movie', 'goods', 'then', 'think', 'most', 'gorehounds', 'will', 'agree', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'fools', 'who', 'fast', 'forward', 'movies', 'review', 'hate', 'ai', ""n't"", 'shame', '.If', 'crave', 'laughs', 'gore', 'scares', 'love', 'movies', 'DEMONS', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'SAVAGE', 'HARVEST', 'can', 'stand', 'budget', ""'m"", 'talking', 'video', 'shooting', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'here', 'then', 'what', 'hell', 'are', 'doing', 'reading', 'review', 'Just', 'buy', 'damn', 'thing', 'Thanks', 'BRIAN', 'SINGLETON', 'friends', 'crazy', 'ride', 'sure', 'will', 'keep', 'eye', 'folks']",Forest of the Dead

1062493,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000O76PWQ,Zombob,"[2, 2]","OH. MY. GOD.This movie must've been made on the most miniscule of budgets. Read on:THE ACTORS: So so. Nothing incredible here. Some held their own more than others. Some minimal nudity.THE ZOMBIES: These are ""Snyder's Runners"" all the way. These zombies actively pursue their victims. The make up for the zombies pretty much was to darken around their eyes and then cover their faces with blood. Since this movie was set ""in the woods,"" lighting was minimal and the zombie's faces were barely visible at times (which I feel, actually helped make the zombies more frightening). Sadly, at times, zombies that I thought had been destroyed, pop up later to wreck havoc, which made me wonder, if that was an ""oops,"" or if it was the zombe that was destroyed earlier really wasn't.THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow. Where do I begin? From the latest bag of innards from the local meat market to the victim getting his PAPER MACHE head torn off, having no budget was blatently visible. Looks like it was filmed on whatever the next piece of equipment is up from a camcorder. On the plus side, NO heavy metal music soundtrack.Overall, this movie is SO bad, that it's good. THIS is how cheap no budget movies should be done. This movie was SO awful, that I am recommending it! This is a must see cheesy zombie flick! The bloopers at the end re-enforce that all the indivuals involved had fun making this. There is really nothing here that hasn't been seen or done before, but because it is so terrible, you just have to see it! I am going to give this two ratings: one, as a rating for a zombie movie, and two, one for the campy, cheese factor.Rating: As a zombie movie: 2 out of 5 starsAs a campy, cheesy ""B"" flick: 4 out of 5 stars",3,A review from Zombiefans!,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,1715,"['OH', 'MY', 'GOD.This', 'movie', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'most', 'miniscule', 'budgets', 'Read', 'THE', 'ACTORS', 'So', 'so', 'Nothing', 'incredible', 'here', 'held', 'own', 'more', 'others', 'minimal', 'nudity.THE', 'ZOMBIES', 'are', 'Snyder', 'Runners', 'way', 'zombies', 'actively', 'pursue', 'victims', 'make', 'up', 'zombies', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'darken', 'around', 'eyes', 'then', 'cover', 'blood', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'woods', 'lighting', 'was', 'minimal', 'zombie', 'were', 'barely', 'visible', 'times', 'feel', 'actually', 'helped', 'make', 'zombies', 'more', 'frightening', 'Sadly', 'times', 'zombies', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'pop', 'up', 'later', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'made', 'wonder', 'was', 'oops', 'was', 'zombe', 'was', 'destroyed', 'earlier', 'really', ""wasn't.THE"", 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'Wow', 'Where', 'do', 'begin', 'latest', 'bag', 'innards', 'local', 'meat', 'market', 'victim', 'getting', 'PAPER', 'MACHE', 'head', 'torn', 'off', 'having', 'budget', 'was', 'blatently', 'visible', 'was', 'filmed', 'next', 'piece', 'equipment', 'up', 'camcorder', 'plus', 'side', 'NO', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'soundtrack.Overall', 'movie', 'SO', 'bad', 'good', 'THIS', 'how', 'cheap', 'budget', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'SO', 'awful', 'am', 'recommending', 'must', 'see', 'cheesy', 'zombie', 'flick', 'bloopers', 'end', 're-enforce', 'indivuals', 'involved', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'terrible', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'two', 'ratings', 'one', 'rating', 'zombie', 'movie', 'two', 'one', 'campy', 'cheese', 'factor.Rating', 'zombie', 'movie', '2', '5', 'starsAs', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'B', 'flick', '4', '5', 'stars']",Forest of the Dead
