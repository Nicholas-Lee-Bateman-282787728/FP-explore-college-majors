The storyline is weak. The volleyball is only passable. Actually, given how the team in question is supposedly the defending national champion, it's subpar.

977869,A1TRPKDQWEP23V,B000ERVJHW,Meerkat,"[1, 3]","I love volleyball, so when I saw this title, I thought I'd give it a try.  Although the volleyball scenes are passable, the plot is ridiculous, and the acting is terrible, not to mention the really offensive stereo types.  All of the Hispanic girls in this film are made up to look like BRATZ dolls, and sound more like they live in the Bronx than SoCal. Having the Anglo girls fuss over how the ""Latino boys"" were looking at them was obnoxious as well.  Having one of the main conflicts be the ""Barbies"" vs ""Ghetto Girls"" made every single one of the characters seem shallow and completely unsympathetic.  The DJs calling the games at a supposed National title match was just absurd, and the teams taunting each other on court was ridiculous (every coach I've ever played for would make us run until our legs fell off for taking our minds off the game long enough to do that - not to mention that it's an amazing example of bad sportsmanship).  I applaud the fact that they tried to make volleyball the focal point, but that didn't begin to make up for the bad acting, the contrived plot, and especially the racial stereotypes (those were really offensive).",1,Surprisingly Offensive,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,1158,"['love', 'volleyball', 'when', 'saw', 'title', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'volleyball', 'scenes', 'are', 'passable', 'plot', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'terrible', 'not', 'mention', 'really', 'offensive', 'stereo', 'types', 'Hispanic', 'girls', 'film', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'BRATZ', 'dolls', 'sound', 'more', 'live', 'Bronx', 'SoCal', 'Having', 'Anglo', 'girls', 'fuss', 'how', 'Latino', 'boys', 'were', 'looking', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'as', 'well', 'Having', 'one', 'main', 'conflicts', 'be', 'Barbies', 'vs', 'Ghetto', 'Girls', 'made', 'single', 'one', 'characters', 'seem', 'shallow', 'completely', 'unsympathetic', 'DJs', 'calling', 'games', 'supposed', 'National', 'title', 'match', 'was', 'just', 'absurd', 'teams', 'taunting', 'other', 'court', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'coach', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'played', 'would', 'make', 'run', 'legs', 'fell', 'off', 'taking', 'minds', 'game', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'not', 'mention', 'amazing', 'example', 'bad', 'sportsmanship', 'applaud', 'fact', 'tried', 'make', 'focal', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'make', 'up', 'bad', 'acting', 'contrived', 'plot', 'especially', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'were', 'really', 'offensive']",All You've Got

977871,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ERVJHW,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","Think of ""All You've Got"" as a volleyball version of ""Bring it on"" and you know what you will see in it. The film is produced by MTV Films and is full of cool soundtrack music. Instead of Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushuku and Gabrielle Union, the film features singers like Ciara and Adrienne Bailon, but you know, in this kind of film made for fun, it doesn't really matter whether or not they can act like Meryl Streep, and to be fair they are all likable, giving their best shots. I tried to like the film itself, but I find it very disappointing.The story itself is not bad. You meet two rivaling volleyball squads The Madonnas and The Phantoms (which reflects the cultural and social differences). Three of the ace players of The Madonnas join the The Phantoms after one tragic event that happens to their school. Their presence naturally causes a discord in the team despite the strict teaching of the coach (Faizon Love), but they have to stay together to win the California State Championship.The story is predictable, but so was that of ""Bring it on"" (not that part about the finals in Florida, but the friendship between the girls), so the predictability didn't bother me. No, what disappointed me is the lack of joyful energy of the characters and thrilling sports scenes. The film does not take any new steps in presenting the characters, and it seems the film is more interested in showing the DJs and musicians on stage (in the dance clubs where they go) than the girls themselves. The volleyball sequences are not exciting because of the absence of the athletes' movements that should be essential to the film's story. The use of stunts and stand-ins is understandable, but the scenes are poorly put together, giving some strange moments when it is obvious that the actors are only posing in the court, not playing the game at all.Probably fans of the actors will enjoy the film, finding more fun than they expected, and Adrienne Bailon is actually very good. But as an ordinary film fan I think ""All You've Got"" needs something more, more power and energy, and something that would surprise the viewers.",2,"MTV's ""Bring it on""-Style Teen Comedy Needs More Energy to Surprise Us",1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2114,"['Think', 'All', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'volleyball', 'version', 'Bring', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'produced', 'MTV', 'Films', 'full', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Instead', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Eliza', 'Dushuku', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'film', 'singers', 'Ciara', 'Adrienne', 'Bailon', 'know', 'kind', 'film', 'made', 'fun', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'not', 'can', 'act', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'likable', 'giving', 'best', 'shots', 'tried', 'like', 'film', 'find', 'very', 'disappointing.The', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'meet', 'two', 'rivaling', 'volleyball', 'Madonnas', 'Phantoms', 'cultural', 'social', 'differences', 'Three', 'ace', 'players', 'Madonnas', 'join', 'Phantoms', 'one', 'tragic', 'event', 'school', 'presence', 'naturally', 'discord', 'team', 'strict', 'teaching', 'coach', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'have', 'stay', 'together', 'win', 'California', 'State', 'Championship.The', 'story', 'predictable', 'so', 'was', 'Bring', 'not', 'part', 'finals', 'Florida', 'friendship', 'girls', 'predictability', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'No', 'what', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'joyful', 'energy', 'characters', 'thrilling', 'sports', 'scenes', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'new', 'steps', 'presenting', 'characters', 'film', 'more', 'interested', 'showing', 'DJs', 'musicians', 'stage', 'dance', 'clubs', 'where', 'go', 'girls', 'volleyball', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'exciting', 'absence', 'athletes', 'movements', 'should', 'be', 'essential', 'film', 'story', 'use', 'stunts', 'stand-ins', 'understandable', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'put', 'together', 'giving', 'strange', 'moments', 'when', 'obvious', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'posing', 'court', 'not', 'playing', 'game', 'all.Probably', 'fans', 'actors', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'finding', 'more', 'fun', 'expected', 'Adrienne', 'Bailon', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'ordinary', 'film', 'fan', 'think', 'All', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'something', 'more', 'more', 'power', 'energy', 'something', 'would', 'surprise', 'viewers']",All You've Got
