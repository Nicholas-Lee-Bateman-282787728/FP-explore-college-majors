1346100,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,B003HUNCDW,Marine Corps Nomad,"[12, 13]","The Secrets of the Mountain is a story about a real family with real problems.Somewhere between the demands of her career, her ex husband's wedding, and her kids busy schedules, Dana James (mom) realizes that her family is starting to fall apart. She is stressed.  The older kids are constantly fighting.  They aren't spending any quality time together as a family.  Her family is crumbling before her eyes.  When a mysterious buyer offers to purchase the family's mountain property, Dana jumps at the chance to head away from the stress of the day-to-day life and get away.  She's hoping this little get away will be just what her family needs to pull together.  Little did she know what surprises this trip would hold.  Nothing is what it seems.  The mountain holds an ancient secret.  Will her family survive the ancient mystery of the mountain?Secrets of the Mountain is a movie that held many twists and turns and held our attention for the whole movie.  My daughter thought that it was a like a kid-friendly Indiana Jones type movie.  I appreciated that it was a solid movie with good acting and no inappropriate material.  My husband thought is was great to be able to watch an action/adventure movie that was suitable for our entire family.While not an issue for us, I do need to mention that there are skeletons shown at one point in the movie, so this may be scary for some children.  In addition, the beginning of the movie shows a vehicle crash.  Once again, while this was not a big deal for us, I wanted to bring it to your attention.It was refreshing to watch a movie that focused on the family and building good family relationships.  It shows the importance of standing up for family and forgiveness for past mistakes.Disclosure: I received a copy of this movie in exchange for an honest review.",5,A great movie for the whole family,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,1812,"['Secrets', 'Mountain', 'story', 'real', 'family', 'real', 'problems.Somewhere', 'demands', 'career', 'ex', 'husband', 'wedding', 'kids', 'busy', 'schedules', 'Dana', 'James', 'mom', 'family', 'starting', 'fall', 'apart', 'stressed', 'older', 'kids', 'are', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'are', ""n't"", 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'together', 'family', 'family', 'crumbling', 'eyes', 'When', 'mysterious', 'buyer', 'offers', 'purchase', 'family', 'mountain', 'property', 'Dana', 'chance', 'head', 'away', 'stress', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'get', 'away', 'hoping', 'little', 'get', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'family', 'pull', 'together', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'trip', 'would', 'hold', 'Nothing', 'what', 'mountain', 'ancient', 'secret', 'Will', 'family', 'survive', 'ancient', 'mystery', 'mountain', 'Secrets', 'Mountain', 'movie', 'held', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'held', 'attention', 'whole', 'movie', 'daughter', 'thought', 'was', 'kid-friendly', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'type', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'husband', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'was', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family.While', 'not', 'issue', 'do', 'mention', 'are', 'skeletons', 'shown', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'scary', 'children', 'addition', 'beginning', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'crash', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'wanted', 'bring', 'attention.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'movie', 'focused', 'family', 'building', 'good', 'family', 'relationships', 'importance', 'standing', 'up', 'family', 'forgiveness', 'past', 'mistakes.Disclosure', 'received', 'copy', 'movie', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review']",Secrets of the Mountain  BONUS PACK
1346101,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B003HUNCDW,mk,"[2, 2]","This Walmart movie offers it all: adventure, mystery, family values, music- the soundtrack is included- a touch of romance, and tons of extras on the special features.Planned as the pilot movie for a hoped for series, seen on NBC, the story tells of a divorced lawyer who takes her three kids to the beautiful mountain and home that her beloved uncle left in his will.  She has sold it and has five days before the new owners, new nefarious owner(s) take over.  Of course, there lies secrets of the Aztecs and treasure under the mountain, and the race is on to discover them.The actors are good, the story's fine, the setting rustic.  Our children ages, 5 & 7 enjoyed the thrills.  There is some peril; a car crash, lost in a cave, a bad guy threatening in the shadows, lots of skeletons- which our kids really loved.  Preview it and see what you think.  There's some mild drama, but they stress family, and things are done with humor and imagination.  The kids are enpowered as smart and resourceful.Also, as with Walmart movies, you'll see those Value Products displayed proudly. It's their show.Actually, we liked the 2+hours of bonus material as much as the movie, interviewing the actors, showing behind the scene, Just for Laughs, etc.  Randy Jackson manages the music for these movies.  He's work with a lot of different groups as musician, composer, and such.  The CD soundtrack is decent.  I like the music by Brooke White of American Idol.  She also sings and stars in her own Walmart movie, which I like better(the kids like the skeleton one better) called Change of Plans.Nice full package of family entertainment.",5,The Whole Package: Family Thrills and Music,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1626,"['Walmart', 'movie', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'family', 'values', 'music-', 'soundtrack', 'included-', 'touch', 'romance', 'tons', 'extras', 'special', 'features.Planned', 'pilot', 'movie', 'hoped', 'series', 'seen', 'NBC', 'story', 'tells', 'divorced', 'lawyer', 'who', 'three', 'kids', 'beautiful', 'mountain', 'home', 'beloved', 'uncle', 'left', 'will', 'sold', 'five', 'days', 'new', 'owners', 'new', 'nefarious', 'owner', 's', 'take', 'over', 'course', 'secrets', 'Aztecs', 'treasure', 'mountain', 'race', 'discover', 'them.The', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'fine', 'setting', 'rustic', 'children', '5', '7', 'enjoyed', 'thrills', 'peril', 'car', 'crash', 'lost', 'cave', 'bad', 'guy', 'threatening', 'shadows', 'lots', 'skeletons-', 'kids', 'really', 'loved', 'Preview', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'mild', 'drama', 'stress', 'family', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'humor', 'imagination', 'kids', 'are', 'enpowered', 'smart', 'resourceful.Also', 'Walmart', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Value', 'Products', 'displayed', 'proudly', 'show.Actually', 'liked', '2+hours', 'bonus', 'material', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'interviewing', 'actors', 'showing', 'scene', 'Just', 'Laughs', 'etc', 'Randy', 'Jackson', 'music', 'movies', 'work', 'lot', 'different', 'groups', 'musician', 'composer', 'such', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'decent', 'music', 'Brooke', 'White', 'American', 'Idol', 'also', 'sings', 'stars', 'own', 'Walmart', 'movie', 'like', 'better', 'kids', 'skeleton', 'one', 'better', 'called', 'Change', 'Plans.Nice', 'full', 'package', 'family', 'entertainment']",Secrets of the Mountain  BONUS PACK
