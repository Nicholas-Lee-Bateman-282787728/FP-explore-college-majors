They are true to CS Lewis' whimsy and fairytale sense. In a way,it is reminiscent of children playing dress-up; it doesn't deserve an epic treatment. Lewis wanted a homestyle fairytale for children to teach them the Christian story.Barbara Kellerman is equal parts menace and seduction as the White Witch. Ronald Pickup gives nobility to his voicing of the Christ-figure,Aslan. The children actors are believeable and sympathetic,especially the ones who portray Lucy and Edmund. The children are more dominant characters than Aslan-we care more about their struggles than his-but that's the way Lewis wrote them.The BBC did not dilute the story's Christian message like the Disney version. The Disney version expurgated the references to ""The Emperor Across the Sea"" (the God the Father figure),as well as the meaning of Aslan's sacrifice and the writing on the Stone Table. In the Disney version,Peter and Edmund retreat when battling the White Witch,until the resurrected Aslan returns deus ex machina. In the BBC version,the resurrected Aslan leads Peter and Edmund into battle,true to the story. In the Disney version,the Fox is an action hero;in the BBC version,he is turned to stone for celebrating Christmas. The Disney version changed Father Christmas as well..his speech to Lucy and Susan about the unseemliness of women in battle is gone. The BBC retained this,keeping Lewis' views on women intact.The BBC's ""The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a perfect movie for the Christmas season. In an increasingly secular world in which it is ""always winter,never Christmas"",this movie still has a timely message.",5,The Definitive Journey Into the Wardrobe,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,1774,"['When', 'BBC', 'made', 'version', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'were', 'short', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'compensated', 'being', 'full', 'books', 'spirit', 'are', 'true', 'CS', 'Lewis', 'whimsy', 'fairytale', 'sense', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'children', 'playing', 'dress-up', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'epic', 'treatment', 'Lewis', 'wanted', 'homestyle', 'fairytale', 'children', 'teach', 'Christian', 'story.Barbara', 'Kellerman', 'equal', 'parts', 'menace', 'seduction', 'White', 'Witch', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'nobility', 'voicing', 'Christ-figure', 'Aslan', 'children', 'actors', 'are', 'believeable', 'sympathetic', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'portray', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'children', 'are', 'more', 'dominant', 'characters', 'Aslan-we', 'care', 'more', 'struggles', 'his-but', 'way', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'them.The', 'BBC', 'did', 'not', 'dilute', 'story', 'Christian', 'message', 'Disney', 'version', 'Disney', 'version', 'expurgated', 'references', 'Emperor', 'Sea', 'God', 'Father', 'figure', 'as', 'well', 'meaning', 'Aslan', 'sacrifice', 'writing', 'Stone', 'Table', 'Disney', 'version', 'Peter', 'Edmund', 'retreat', 'when', 'battling', 'White', 'Witch', 'resurrected', 'Aslan', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'BBC', 'version', 'resurrected', 'Aslan', 'Peter', 'Edmund', 'battle', 'true', 'story', 'Disney', 'version', 'Fox', 'action', 'hero', 'BBC', 'version', 'turned', 'stone', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'Disney', 'version', 'changed', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'well..his', 'speech', 'Lucy', 'Susan', 'unseemliness', 'women', 'battle', 'gone', 'BBC', 'retained', 'keeping', 'Lewis', 'views', 'women', 'intact.The', 'BBC', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'season', 'increasingly', 'secular', 'world', 'always', 'winter', 'never', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'still', 'timely', 'message']",N/A

His mouth doesn't even move to his words.""  At the time this film was made, on the budget with which it was made, this was an understandable weakness.But that weakness will soon be dealt with.

I loved the Chronicles of Narnia as a child, and continue to read them today.  One of my favourite things is to cuddle up with my girlfriend and read these in bed, but when we saw this film, we were shocked.The girl who plays Lucy would have made C.S. turn in his grave. She is ugly, buck-toothed, and fat. She has these horrible facial expressions that just don't make you filled with sympathy when she is hurt.  We're talking about Lucy, the one that C.S. Lewis dedicated this book to- his granddaughter!The entire movie is a deep comedy. The acting on a whole is pretty poor. I agree with one reviewer's comment that Edmund looks older than Peter. And Peter looks so feminine. This is the HIGH KING? Susan is supposed to have ""raven hair."" This means that her hair is supposed to be dark, yet she is played by a blonde in the movie.It seems as if the kids were plucked from the nearest grade school and suckered in with lollipops.The Professor's home looks nothing like it is described in the book. We can give this some slack because it is hard to find such a house in the English countryside. this is one of the few inaccuracies of the film.Obviously the effects are pretty poor as others have said. They almost make the film rather comical, and we tend to overlook the seriousness of the events because the effects are rather poor.I will give this movie though a few positives. It is pretty accurate with the book, both in dialogue and sequences of the film. There is some beautiful English countryside in the film. The producers made-do with what they had, and the film shows that while it was cheaply made, it's pretty decent shot at production.These positives shouldn't outweigh the negatives of this film, as there are a lot, but all in all, it is a pretty good attempt at producing a film that was neigh-impossible to pull off as excellent at that time.I have a fault with several of the reviews made on this movie, because many were basing the greatness of this film on the book's greatness, which of course is NOT the purpose of a film review. Others are inquiring as to how they can find this film? Why are you posting on a review?! For those that want to review the animated film, go review that one!There is a difference in making a film, going with what you had.

706925,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B000069CFB,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[1, 2]","-This review pertains to the original DVD release, not the remastered edition-In 1988, the BBC produced the first of four films based uponThe Chronicles of Narniabooks by C.S. Lewis. The films are very faithful to the classic stories and feature much of the dialogue originally spoken in the books. Despite the series' low budget, it has become a family favorite and will provide hours of nostalgia for those who saw the films during their original airing.During the bombing of London in World War II, the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, are sent to live with Professor Kirke in the English countryside. One rainy day the children decide to explore Professor Kirke's large old house and it is during this exploration that Lucy, the youngest stumbles upon an antique wardrobe. She climbs into the wardrobe only to find that it is a doorway to a magical land called Narnia. There Lucy meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his home for tea. Mr. Tumnus tells Lucy of Narnia's different creatures, and of an evil spell cast over the land; a spell that makes it always winter, but never Christmas. Mr. Tumnus lulls Lucy to sleep with his flute and when she awakens hours later, he confesses that he was under oath of the White Witch. The White Witch, (also known as Her Imperial Highness, Jadis, Queen of Narnia) has ordered that any human child found in Narnia should be apprehended and sent to her castle. But Mr. Tumnus, too fond of Lucy, spares her and helps her to escape Narnia. When Lucy returns to her own world, she finds that no time whatsoever has passed and because of this her brothers and her sister disbelieve her fantastic story. However that changes when she returns to Narnia and unbeknownst to her, she is followed by her brother Edmund. While Lucy is visiting Mr. Tumnus, Edmund has an encounter with the White Witch, who enchants him with magically conjured Turkish Delight. After Lucy and Edmund return to their own world, Lucy is eager to tell Peter and Susan that Edmund has now been to Narnia as well. But Edmund lies about the whole thing, claiming that he was just playing along and that it was all just a game. Lucy, heartbroken, goes off to her room to sulk. Fearing that Lucy may be disturbed, Peter and Susan consult Professor Kirke. To their great surprise the professor believes Lucy's story to be true and complains that children ought to be taught logic in school. After being reprimanded by the housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady, the four children try to find a place to hide. Ultimately, they find themselves in the room with the wardrobe and are forced to hide in it, but when they are transported to Narnia, Lucy insists that they visit Mr. Tumnus. They come to find that his home has been broken into and a note was left behind. The note declares that Mr. Tumnus was taken prisoner by the White Witch. As they debate what action to take, the children come across a talking beaver, who offers them shelter at his dam. The beaver and his wife tell the four children of an ancient prophecy that states that four human children will become the rightful rulers of Narnia and overthrow the White Witch. During their short stay with the beavers, Edmund wanders off and informs the White Witch of the other children's presence in Narnia. She sets off in her sleigh to capture them. Meanwhile the beavers prepare the other three children for a journey to the Stone Table, where they are to meet Aslan, the messianic Lion King of Narnia. After a dangerous trek, the children meet Aslan face to face and he helps to rescue Edmund from the clutches of the witch... but at a high price. On the eve before the great battle against the White Witch's army, Aslan disappears leaving Peter, Edmund, and the Narnians to defeat the witch's vile forces? Can good triumph over evil? Will the children live long enough to see their own world again?The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe features a charming ensemble cast (mostly of unknowns) including Richard Dempsey as Peter, Sophie Cook as Susan, Jonathan R. Scott as Edmund, Sophie Wilcox as Lucy, Jeffrey Perry as Mr. Tumnus, Kerry Shale as Mr. Beaver, Lesley Nicol as Mrs. Beaver, Barbara Kellerman as The White Witch, Michael Aldridge as Professor Kirke, and Ronald Pickup as the voice of Aslan. Of the cast, Michael Aldridge and Jeffrey Perry are the most believable, while Sophie Wilcox's incessant whining and Barbara Kellerman's over-the-top line readings may annoy some viewers.But all in all, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a delightful film.The DVD includes an excerpt from the British television program The bookworm, a still gallery, an animated trivia challenge, and a recipe for Turkish Delight.All three DVDs containing the four Narnia films can be found together in a moneysavingbox set, which includes beautiful artwork on the packaging. Also available is a newlyremastered box set.Also recommended:Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete CollectionThe Wind in the Willows: The Feature Films CollectionThrough the

706927,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000069CFB,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 6]","In the December, C.S. Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" will follow in the footsteps of Lewis' pal Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"" with a gleaming new big-screen adaptation. In the months before it's released, however, it might be time to dust off the 1988 BBC adaptation of Lewis's first book, which is divided between the good and bad.The four Pevensie children arrive in the country, at the start of World War II. Despite the eccentric but friendly professor (Michael Aldridge) who lives there, they're all bored. And during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) slips into an old wardrobe -- and finds that the back of it opens into a magical, snowy forest land called Narnia. She encounters a friendly faun, but when she arrives back home, she finds that none of her siblings believe her.But soon Lucy and her siblings find their way through -- not knowing that peevish Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) has already allied himself to the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman) who keeps Narnia locked in winter. She's especially desperate, because Narnia is beginning to thaw out, now that leonine Aslan is coming back to it, and the Pevensie kids have shown up to fulfil an old prophecy. But the Witch won't go down without a massive battle -- and one that might destroy the lion-messiah himself.""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a mixed bag -- it has more or less equal measures of good and bad. What it also has is deep fidelity to Lewis's original book, which was one of the first major fantasies to get widespread attention. And that's definitely an important detail, since the spirit of the book could easily have been lost.The filmmakers obviously did their homework, crafting the script and dialogue to be close to Lewis's novel. And it's a credit that they pulled off some lines that could have sounded idiotic (""You're not dead, Aslan!"" ""Do I look dead?"") in the wrong hands. They also did an excellent job of changing atmosphere, shifting from the stodgy English country house to the airy frozen Narnia, with its castles and dewy wildlands.Unfortunately, the special effects haven't aged well. They were state of the art at the time, but now they look quite cheesy and low budget, with a few exceptions -- the scene where Lucy restores various ""statued"" people to life is pretty good. The other stuff ranged from primitive bluescreen to an enormous puppet playing Aslan. It's a good puppet, and remarkably convincing physically, but it still makes Aslan look like he has a wicked case of arthritis.The acting is also divided between good and bad. Scott is particularly good as the ""bad boy"" Edmund, who ends up falling in with the Witch, especially when he turns on his evil mentor.

706935,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000069CFB,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 28]","One of the lessons of this production of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is that a good story can forgive many things.  I mean, the special effects of this 1988 adaptation are pretty much on a par with ""Barney,"" which is most apparent every time one of the hand drawn animations appears.  However, they are done in the style of Pauline Baynes, the original illustrator of this classic tale by C.S. Lewis, which amply evidences that whatever budgetary considerations the hearts, minds and souls of the producers were in the right place.  The costumes of the talking animals and the soldiers of Narnia are all pretty good, as are the simple sets (clearly where the money went), but the proof of the pudding here is obviously going to be Aslan.  We are talking minimalistic animatronics here, but it all works.  Mainly that is because the four children who meet up with the great lion who rules over Narnia clearly believe in him and accept him, which is all the magic that is needed.  The result is admittedly not great, but it is very good, and, most importantly, it is in the spirit of the original story.""The Chronicles of Narnia"" have their origin in the Second World War when Hitler's Luftwaffe was subjecting London to the blitz and the city's children were evacuated to the country for safety.  Four such children ended up at the Kilns, the Oxford home of C.S. Lewis, where they were entertained by the stories he told to them.  In 1950 Lewis published ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,"" the first of the seven tales that would made up ""The Chronicles of Narnia.""  The tales hold their own as adventures for children, who get to use magic and fight with swords, but there is also a wonderful amount of depth only available to adults who are wise enough to look at such things.That was because Lewis was not just an acclaimed author of children's literature; he was also a distinguished Oxbridge literary scholar and critic and a popular writer and broadcaster of Christian apologetics.  While clearly Lewis carved out a distinguished career as a novelist, scholar, and theologian with three decidedly different audiences, it is equally obvious that a full appreciation of any of his writings is impossible without recognizing the elements of his other personas.  Certainly there are Christians who would be troubled by Lewis's incorporation of talking animals, witches and other fairy folk into his fictional tales, but ultimately the potency of this tales from a theological perspective is his ability to make it all work.  Besides, the fact that the children one day become too old to return to Narnia but are expected never to forget the lesson learned there is something like a broad hint as to how this is all supposed to work out.The story tells of Lucy (Sophie Wilcox), Peter (Richard Dempsey), Susan (Sophie Cook), and Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott), who are sent off to the country home of Professor Kirke (Michael Aldridge) during the war.  On a rainy day they explore the old home and Lucy enters a large old wardrobe in the attic to discover it opens into a fantastic world of mythological creatures and talking animals, all under the spell of eternal winter cast by the White Witch (Barbara Kellerman).  Lucy is not believed when she returns, for time passes differently in Narnia, but eventually they all end up in the wondrous world.  There the White Witch gets Edmond to betray his siblings and their newfound friends in Narnia with promises of Turkish Delight treats.  But against here is Aslan, the brave lion king who returns to save his people and the land of Narnia.  Not surprising, the story rests on the importance of acts of sacrifice and salvation.This was the third television version of ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" and the best of the bunch.  The children are believable as such, whether acting horrible towards one another or behaving heroically on behalf of the people are Narnia.  It is that believability that the cast brings to the production and the fidelity to the original story that makes this work, especially for children.  A new production is slated to be made in 2004 and the improvements in special effects are such that you would have to think that there will be noticeable improvements over the 1988 version.  But if it fails to be true to the original story and loses the sense of believability at the heart of this production, any improved special effects will come to naught.",4,The enchanting first adventure in the magic land of Narnia,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,4446,"['One', 'lessons', 'production', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'forgive', 'many', 'things', 'mean', 'special', 'effects', '1988', 'adaptation', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'Barney', 'most', 'apparent', 'time', 'one', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animations', 'However', 'are', 'done', 'style', 'Pauline', 'Baynes', 'original', 'illustrator', 'classic', 'tale', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'amply', 'evidences', 'budgetary', 'considerations', 'hearts', 'minds', 'souls', 'producers', 'were', 'right', 'place', 'costumes', 'talking', 'animals', 'soldiers', 'Narnia', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'simple', 'sets', 'clearly', 'where', 'money', 'went', 'proof', 'pudding', 'here', 'obviously', 'going', 'be', 'Aslan', 'are', 'talking', 'minimalistic', 'animatronics', 'here', 'works', 'Mainly', 'four', 'children', 'who', 'meet', 'up', 'great', 'lion', 'who', 'rules', 'Narnia', 'clearly', 'believe', 'accept', 'magic', 'needed', 'result', 'admittedly', 'not', 'great', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'importantly', 'spirit', 'original', 'story', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'have', 'origin', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'Hitler', 'Luftwaffe', 'was', 'subjecting', 'London', 'blitz', 'city', 'children', 'were', 'evacuated', 'country', 'safety', 'Four', 'such', 'children', 'ended', 'up', 'Kilns', 'Oxford', 'home', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'where', 'were', 'entertained', 'stories', 'told', '1950', 'Lewis', 'published', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'first', 'seven', 'tales', 'would', 'made', 'up', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'tales', 'hold', 'own', 'adventures', 'children', 'who', 'get', 'use', 'magic', 'fight', 'swords', 'also', 'wonderful', 'amount', 'depth', 'only', 'available', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'wise', 'enough', 'look', 'such', 'was', 'Lewis', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'acclaimed', 'author', 'children', 'literature', 'was', 'also', 'distinguished', 'Oxbridge', 'literary', 'scholar', 'critic', 'popular', 'writer', 'broadcaster', 'Christian', 'apologetics', 'clearly', 'Lewis', 'carved', 'out', 'distinguished', 'career', 'novelist', 'scholar', 'theologian', 'three', 'decidedly', 'different', 'audiences', 'equally', 'obvious', 'full', 'appreciation', 'writings', 'impossible', 'recognizing', 'elements', 'other', 'personas', 'Certainly', 'are', 'Christians', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'troubled', 'Lewis', 'incorporation', 'talking', 'animals', 'witches', 'other', 'fairy', 'folk', 'fictional', 'tales', 'ultimately', 'potency', 'tales', 'theological', 'perspective', 'ability', 'make', 'work', 'fact', 'children', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'too', 'old', 'return', 'Narnia', 'are', 'expected', 'never', 'forget', 'lesson', 'learned', 'something', 'broad', 'hint', 'how', 'supposed', 'work', 'out.The', 'story', 'tells', 'Lucy', 'Sophie', 'Wilcox', 'Peter', 'Richard', 'Dempsey', 'Susan', 'Sophie', 'Cook', 'Edmund', 'Jonathan', 'R.', 'Scott', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'country', 'home', 'Professor', 'Kirke', 'Michael', 'Aldridge', 'war', 'rainy', 'day', 'explore', 'old', 'home', 'Lucy', 'large', 'old', 'wardrobe', 'attic', 'discover', 'fantastic', 'world', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'talking', 'animals', 'spell', 'eternal', 'winter', 'cast', 'White', 'Witch', 'Barbara', 'Kellerman', 'Lucy', 'not', 'believed', 'when', 'time', 'passes', 'differently', 'Narnia', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'wondrous', 'world', 'White', 'Witch', 'Edmond', 'betray', 'siblings', 'newfound', 'friends', 'Narnia', 'promises', 'Turkish', 'Delight', 'treats', 'here', 'Aslan', 'brave', 'lion', 'king', 'who', 'save', 'people', 'land', 'Narnia', 'Not', 'surprising', 'story', 'importance', 'acts', 'sacrifice', 'salvation.This', 'was', 'third', 'television', 'version', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'best', 'bunch', 'children', 'are', 'believable', 'such', 'acting', 'horrible', 'towards', 'one', 'behaving', 'heroically', 'behalf', 'people', 'are', 'Narnia', 'believability', 'cast', 'production', 'fidelity', 'original', 'story', 'work', 'especially', 'children', 'new', 'production', 'slated', 'be', 'made', '2004', 'improvements', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'such', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'noticeable', 'improvements', '1988', 'version', 'be', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'sense', 'believability', 'heart', 'production', 'improved', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'come']",N/A

The acting isn't especially wonderful(no Oscars/Bafta's here), but it has such a sense of magic and whimsy, you can't help being pulled in. I guess somehow, it just seems more real. Sometimes, all the CG in the world can't take the place of an old fashioned production. Aslan in this production is extremely well done, as is the Tumnus character. The White Witch's part is terribly overracted, but that adds to the fun I think. The Beaver's are very sweer and amusing. I have loved this version since the first time I saw it, and the children I have shown it to prefer to watch it over the big budget Hollywood version. Completely worth a buy.
