The story itself is lightweight, but it's told so well that you don't mind. Loretta Young is gorgeous in the larger-than-life way that Technicolor made mere mortals into Stars, playing an uptight, sharp-tongued nurse who unleashes her wild, fun-loving side once she goes to sleep & starts sleepwalking. Joseph Cotten is equally enjoyable as the befuddled object of her disdain (while she's awake) & flirtatious affection (while she's asleep). There's an innocence to this sort of film that just isn't possible today, and it's given a charmingly naughty edge by skirting the restrictions of the Hays Code as much as was possible during that time. It's a modest film, but it succeeds wonderfully on its modest terms -- recommended!",4,"Slight film, but frothy fun",1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,842,"[""'m"", 'so', 'grateful', 'made-on-demand', 'DVD-R', 'making', 'small', 'delightful', 'films', 'one', 'available', 'last', 'story', 'lightweight', 'told', 'so', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'gorgeous', 'larger-than-life', 'way', 'Technicolor', 'made', 'mere', 'mortals', 'Stars', 'playing', 'uptight', 'sharp-tongued', 'nurse', 'who', 'wild', 'fun-loving', 'side', 'sleep', 'sleepwalking', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'befuddled', 'object', 'disdain', 'awake', 'flirtatious', 'affection', 'asleep', 'innocence', 'sort', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'possible', 'today', 'given', 'charmingly', 'naughty', 'edge', 'skirting', 'restrictions', 'Hays', 'Code', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'possible', 'time', 'modest', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'modest', 'terms', 'recommended']",Half Angel
