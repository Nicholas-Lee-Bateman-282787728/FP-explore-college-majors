I should have set my expectations lower but both Thornton and Heder are capable of delivering the laughs - just not in this movie.The movie's plot, while basic, should have been funny.  Heder is a loser with no courage and a panicky/fainting personality.  He is sent by a friend who boasts that he's seeing ""two Asian girls at the same time"" to Thornton (Dr. P.) who teaches a rough class that supposedly stiffens spines and will make its students over into lions for $5000.  This revolves around hurting the students, yelling at them (and in the case of Lesher, even raping them).  Yup, Michael Clark Duncan (who plays Thornton's assistant) starts out as his usual no-nonsense gruff self and then becomes something more creepy and ugly as the movie winds down.  Was the image of Duncan raping these losers supposed to add humor to the story?Anyway, as we all know from the previews Heder finds the lion within (Thornton's tutelage notwithstanding) and a new competitive side of Thornton emerges.  Not to be upstaged by Heder he moves in on Heder's girl (Jacinda Barrett).  The movie has been slow up till now, the laughs mild and sparse, but things look like they'll be picking up finally.  Heder and Thornton spar for Barrett's attention and give us some genuine laughs, but as soon as it gets going it falls into the realm of the implausible and not-so-very-funny.  When Barrett's apartment is broken into and vandalized (supposedly by Heder) there isn't much to laugh at anymore - except maybe that the movie expects us to believe that she can't see through what is happening around her.  In fact the scenarios become so ludicrous and ugly that you may be shaking your head in disgust, but not laughing.  And Heder's girl? Well, she starts to look less and less like a prize worth fighting for as the movie progresses.  All the while you have to listen to Barrett's roommate spout nonsense toward Heder's character because everyone knows that you can't have a comedy without the quirky roommate right? In this case her quirks are more aggravation and annoyance than anything else.In the end, Ben Stiller shows up with bad hair, bad accent and cats, and with his help Heder is ready to take on Thornton to try and win Barrett's affection, or save Barrett from Thornton, or beat Thornton, or something like that.Like I said, Thornton and Heder have shown in other movies that they do know how to do comedy, but their performances here are shallow at best.  For all the work Thornton had to put into this he could have been reading from que cards the whole time, but that hardly matters his character never breaks free from its mold.  Heder is somewhat charming and likeable but spends far too much time being the brooding, loser punching bag.  The supporting cast comes and goes but never offers any lasting impression and their inclusion in the film feels like it is by requisite and not the decision of the people in charge for making this movie.Like the supporting cast, the jokes are just the requisite ones and bring no originality to the film, its like no one is even trying with this one the jokes are so dumb.  Dumb humor is fine in a dumb humor movie, but School For Scoundrels isn't content to be a dumb humor movie and takes itself way too serious - and tries to force feed the audience with that crap.  No thought and no fun; the movie doesn't have anything to stand on.You may enjoy the film if you are a fan of Thornton or Heder.

It's not the perfect underdog comedy, but if you're fan of movies like ""The 40 year old Virgin,"" ""Old School,"" and ""Anger Management,"" you might enjoy this film.Story:Things are not going well in the life of Roger (Jon Heder). He lives alone in his apartment and works as a New York meter maid. He is a shy, introvert, and emotional young man who is always picked on by people around him. He likes an Australian beauty Amanda (Jacinda Barrett) who lives next door with her annoying roommate Becky (Sarah Silverman). Roger feels lost, but fortunately his current situation is about to change. A weird friend of his gives him a phone number that is going to change his lonely life. What Roger doesn't know is that he is about to enter a school for men with low self-esteem. The rude teacher is Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton) who is evil and lies to women to get what he wants. He is going to teach the class how to become real men. At first, things seem to be going well for Roger, but then he finds out that his teacher is trying to get Amanda. Things get harsh between teacher and student. They will fight until one of them wins the heart of Amanda.Review:The movie doesn't waste any time and takes you right to the main plot. It is a comedy and there are no confusing subplots. We get hooked up to the story right away. Jon Heder ('Napoleon Dynamite') as a lead actor does wonders in this new movie. I never took the guy seriously before, but this is probably his best work. He is very believable, likeable, funny, and perfect for the role. We hope he won't get stereotyped because he is getting known with these kinds of roles. He is not the only big star; Billy Bob Thornton is another actor who plays the evil teacher very well.What we like about the story is the way the main character evolves from being a nervous kid to a fearless street-smart man who is willing to challenge anyone. He becomes an unstoppable force willing to do whatever it takes to save his girl from the evil Dr. P. The writers Scot Armstrong and Todd Phillips did an excellent job in creating a very likable character. The jokes and dialogue are funny and could be over the top sometimes, but if you watched movies like ""Old School""--also made by the same director--you will probably expect some strong language. What we like in the technical department is the editing. The film doesn't drag and seems to go smoothly.Without giving up the end, there are two ""twists"" that will keep you guessing.

He can't find it in himself to as out his lovely neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett, of Poseidon). He is refered to enroll in a course converting losers to lions with the ladies, taught by Thornton's Dr. P with the burly assist of Michael Clarke Duncan as Lesher. Other mama's boy misfits enrolled are a ""whipped"" Horatio Sanz, Matt Walsh and Todd Louiso's obligatory virgin. After Roger proves himself too good a student, Dr. P wants to seduce Amanda to prove he is still in charge, then the One-upmanship begins this-time school is out and student is a master, sortof.The theme is as classic and as familiar as the books themselves.

The premise is an underground school intended to turn insecure men who never catch a break (many would call them losers) into confidant, successful people.

The lead isNapoleon Dynamite, a parking enforcement agent who sometimes pays violators' tickets out of pocket if they get the least bit confrontational.

Since I have started writing movie reviews, I have used a 5 Star rating system and today, I realized there is a rating that I have never used. No, ""School for Scoundrels"" isn't so good that it needs a rating higher than 5. It is so bad it needs a rating lower than 1 star. So, here it is. My first rating of...0 Stars.Roger Waddell (Jon Heder), a meek New York City meter maid, is having a bad time at work (anytime someone confronts him, he offers to pay their ticket) and in his social life (he can't muster the courage to ask his neighbor, Amanda (Jacinda Barrett, ""Poseidon"", ""The Last Kiss"") out on a date). When his third ""Little Brother"" in a row dumps him, the recreation center manager (David Cross) suggests he call a mysterious phone number, just like he did. It changed his life. Sitting at home, Roger calls the number and reaches Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton) who instructs him to show up at the Learning Annex carrying a manila envelope with $5,000 cash. When he arrives, he and another new student meet Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan), Dr. P's assistant. Soon, they learn Dr. P is running a very unorthodox class in how to gain confidence and change your life. Looking at the collection of sad sacks, he becomes disgusted and ends class early. Then Lesher hands out beepers. They must carry the beepers and initiate a confrontation with someone nearby when instructed. Other items on the curriculum include a paintball course for the students, wearing no protective gear, classes in `how to win the girl' with Lesher playing the female role and more. Soon, Roger begins to excel in the class and gains the confidence to ask Amanda out on a date. But Dr. P is a competitive guy and doesn't like to be upstaged by his students, so he begins to romance Amanda in an attempt to steal her away from him.""School For Scoundrels"", written and directed by Todd Phillips (""Old School"", ""Road Trip""), has a very promising premise, we have seen similar set-ups in hundreds of comedies, but every joke is just wrong, oddly paced and there are no laughs throughout this tedious, tedious film.I heard part of an interview with Phillips on NPR's ""Fresh Air"" in which he stated he wrote the role of Dr. P specifically for Thornton. The actor needs to be more cautious of such flattery in the future. The problem is that we never learn why Dr. P acts like he does. He is a real jerk towards these guys. Sure, they need some coaching, they need some guidance, but Dr. P just does mean things to them, or stereotypical things. In the session when he coaches the men how to treat a lady, he instructs them to ""Lie, lie, lie, then lie some more."" ""Never pay a compliment'. Yawn. We have heard these instructions in hundreds of sitcoms. In ""Scoundrels"", Roger tries to use some of this advice during his date with Amanda. Yes, you would expect that. But when you expect so many things to happen, and they do, the writer and director should take these situations to another level. Phillips doesn't even take some of them to the level we would expect. During the date, Roger tries to use the advice, but he can't really, he's too good natured, and Amanda ends up loving him. In other words, many of the expected jokes have no payoff resulting in a tedious, tedious exercise.Another possible saving grace to such a film might come from the actor's performances. But there again, we come up with zilch. Because we never learn anything about Dr. P, his actions have little or no meaning and there is no comedy involved in any of it. Billy Bob Thornton seems to be doing little more than collecting a paycheck. He never imbues the character with anything unusual or interesting as he has done so memorably in the past. Watching Thornton in this `comedy', I couldn't help but think of another one of his films. The trailers for ""Bad Santa"" looked like ""Scoundrels"" actually is, a poor excuse for a comedy. The difference is ""Bad Santa"" was a great black comedy. In ""Scoundrels"", the set-up is wasted, the actors are wasted and any comedic momentum is completely obliterated by the writing and directing. This results in a tedious, tedious exercise.I fear Jon Heder may be a one-hit wonder. I have yet to see him appear in anything with the promise or brilliance of his debut film ""Napoleon Dynamite"". But then again, I avoided ""The Benchwarmers"", his last film starring Rob Schneider and David Spade. I know, I know. I'm sure it was a comedic gem. But is Heder always going to play a hapless nerd? In ""Scoundrels"", he is given a lot of opportunity to create laughter, but these moments just fall flat. In the opening minutes, as he patrols a neighborhood and then gives a ticket to a car parked next to a curb, two big African American guys run out and start pleading with him to stop writing the ticket. This is mildly amusing. Then, when he explains the ticket was already sent to headquarters, they start to threaten him and he jumps into the Meter Maid car and speeds away at 5 mph. Also, mildly amusing. But when the two guys take out a gun and shoot at his vehicle, causing the tires to go flat. Roger has a panic attack and faints and the amusement is gone. There is also the previously mentioned date with Amanda. Thankfully, this scene doesn't go the expected `sit-com' route. But then again, it doesn't go anywhere.Jacinda Barrett is more bland than anything else. Her main purpose in the film is to play sweet and gullible. On the one hand, Amanda has to accept a date with Roger, to show he can get a date with a woman. On the other hand, her character loses any credibility she may have had when she falls for Dr. P.Ben Stiller makes a cameo, as heavily touted in the previews, but didn't take a credit in the beginning of the film. I think there was a loophole in his contract somewhere allowing the studio to promote his involvement. He plays one of Dr. P's former students, who now lives in Upstate New York with 50 cats. His performance isn't even that funny.David Cross, Horatio Sanz (""Saturday Night Live"") and Michael Clarke Duncan also collect paychecks in this thoroughly tedious exercise.All blame for this film lies at the feet of writer and director Todd Phillips. Why did he think this film was funny? ""Old School"" and ""Road Trip"" each had their moments. In ""Scoundrels"", there is a running joke about Lesher raping male students. The third time they mentioned it, I was still laughing. At one point, someone breaks into Amanda's apartment painting graffiti everywhere indicating Roger was the culprit. Amanda is gullible enough to believe this. Then, Roger shows up at a tennis court and horns in on a game between Dr. P and Amanda. Every time Roger serves, he manages to hit Dr. P. Naturally, this will do nothing but drive her into his arms. But Roger doesn't appear to have seen that episode of ""Three's Company"".Please do me a favor and avoid this tedious, tedious excuse for a comedy.

That said, I think this actually was a decent movie. John Heder plays the role of a New York city Meter man named Roger, a meek man at that. He doesn't stand up for himself, and can't get himself to ask his neighbor out on a date. Heck, he even gets rejected by the little brothers at Big brothers and big sisters, 3 times.  Luckily, he get refered by his friend to take a class to become more confident.  ""Dr. P"" (Billy Bob Thornton) is the professor for this course.  Well, amazingly, Roger some how makes his way to the head of the class, and even goes on a date.  Little does he know, Dr. P has bigger plans, a kind of ""master's program"" for advanced student...and the glove come off. The movie takes off from here. I won't spoil it from here, other reviewers have written alot already. But, It a funny, entertaining film, and I actually have gained some respect for John Heder.  Also, Billy Bob was a good match for the role he plays at Dr. P.

1030342,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000K2UGZW,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 3]","School For Scoundrels is one of those rare movies that gives you exactly what you expected and then a little bit more. Light comedy with a solid plot and great comedic timing. Jon Heder and Billy Bob Thornton play surprisingly well off each other, providing a solid backbone for a film that ultimately becomes a competition between two men to become the Alpha male.With brilliant smaller characters provided by David Cross and Sarah Silverman, School For Scoundrels doesn't back off on the comedy no matter where you turn.The film does falter a bit at the very end, but there's an alternate ending included on the DVD, and for the first time ever, I'd say the alternate ending actually plays better than the ending that was ultimately chosen. Mainly because the film stays surprisingly realistic (and I mean as realistic as Old School or Road Trip, you know, Todd Phillips realism) until the final few scenes.If you're looking for a good laugh, and a film that actually follows a smart plot and offers some new jokes and ideas that you haven't seen before, School For Scoundrels is the way to go.The DVD extras include a gag reel, and a making of featurette that includes sarcasm-laden interviews with Jon Heder, Billy Bob Thornton, Sarah Silverman, and David Cross. There's even a brief clip of Billy Bob Thornton as his character from Sling Blade having a conversation with Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. The whole making of featurette is hilarious.It's a solid 3 1/2 star movie.",3,Billy Bob vs Jon,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1482,"['School', 'Scoundrels', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'then', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Light', 'comedy', 'solid', 'plot', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'play', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'other', 'providing', 'solid', 'backbone', 'film', 'ultimately', 'competition', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'Alpha', 'male.With', 'brilliant', 'smaller', 'characters', 'provided', 'David', 'Cross', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'School', 'Scoundrels', ""n't"", 'back', 'off', 'comedy', 'matter', 'where', 'turn.The', 'film', 'falter', 'bit', 'very', 'end', 'alternate', 'ending', 'included', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'ever', ""'d"", 'say', 'alternate', 'ending', 'actually', 'better', 'ending', 'was', 'ultimately', 'chosen', 'Mainly', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'mean', 'as', 'realistic', 'Old', 'School', 'Road', 'Trip', 'know', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'realism', 'final', 'few', 'scenes.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'laugh', 'film', 'actually', 'smart', 'plot', 'new', 'jokes', 'ideas', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'School', 'Scoundrels', 'way', 'go.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'gag', 'reel', 'making', 'featurette', 'sarcasm-laden', 'interviews', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'David', 'Cross', 'even', 'brief', 'clip', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'character', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'having', 'conversation', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'whole', 'making', 'featurette', 'hilarious.It', 'solid', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'movie']",N/A
