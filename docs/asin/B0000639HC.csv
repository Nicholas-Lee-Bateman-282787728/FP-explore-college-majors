To the reviewer who speculated that maybe the original music was lost ..... Impossible. I have 16MM copies of a couple of episodes that are completely intact. If nothing else, Rhino could have gone that route. Yes, the masters are usually the best, but if a 16MM is the only original left, then please use it. Thank you.",2,"Bad Rhino !!

694325,A2BLITJITO97N5,B0000639HC,Ingalls,"[15, 15]","The shorts are not in order so that you have part two of an episode before part one. The soundtrack is not the original one so that you have a synthesized keyboard playing in the background of shorts made in the late 1950's - this can dull your nostalgia experience. The pamphlet (not booklet) that comes with it gives no history, no original air dates, etc., You will have to guess when an episode is from by its look.  The box unfolds in a bizarre manner and the individual DVDs have no jewel boxes. They are also difficult to free from the hard plastic holder. I had to pry mine loose very carefully. I ended up keeping the DVDs in a plastic bag as the box was totally useless. The Gumby figure toy that comes with it is a miniature and not the original size that was marketed for years.  The extras on disc seven are mostly worthwhile but why didn't they have an entire episode of Howdy Doody (where Gumby was first introduced)? The Gumby transfers are generally good with only a few episodes faded as far as colors go. My biggest beef is that you have to watch the FBI warning and the short Gumby/Rhino intro every time you press the menu button on your DVD player. This was very annoying. Rhino has done an incredibly sloppy, thoughtless job with this release. It is as if they just threw all of the episodes together with little concern that many fans were expecting the ultimate Gumby collection - for themselves and for their kids.  Instead, we have to put up with this collection as it is unlikely that Rhino will ever correct their mistakes.",2,"Thumbs down to Rhino, Gumby deserves better",1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1552,"['shorts', 'are', 'not', 'order', 'have', 'part', 'two', 'episode', 'part', 'one', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'original', 'one', 'so', 'have', 'synthesized', 'keyboard', 'playing', 'background', 'shorts', 'made', 'late', '1950', 'can', 'dull', 'nostalgia', 'experience', 'pamphlet', 'not', 'booklet', 'history', 'original', 'air', 'dates', 'etc.', 'will', 'have', 'guess', 'when', 'episode', 'look', 'box', 'bizarre', 'manner', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'have', 'jewel', 'boxes', 'are', 'also', 'difficult', 'free', 'hard', 'plastic', 'holder', 'had', 'pry', 'mine', 'loose', 'very', 'carefully', 'ended', 'up', 'keeping', 'DVDs', 'plastic', 'bag', 'box', 'was', 'totally', 'useless', 'Gumby', 'figure', 'toy', 'miniature', 'not', 'original', 'size', 'was', 'marketed', 'years', 'extras', 'disc', 'seven', 'are', 'mostly', 'worthwhile', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'entire', 'episode', 'Howdy', 'Doody', 'where', 'Gumby', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Gumby', 'transfers', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'faded', 'as', 'far', 'colors', 'go', 'biggest', 'beef', 'have', 'watch', 'FBI', 'warning', 'short', 'Gumby/Rhino', 'intro', 'time', 'press', 'menu', 'button', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'Rhino', 'done', 'incredibly', 'sloppy', 'thoughtless', 'job', 'release', 'just', 'threw', 'episodes', 'together', 'little', 'concern', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'expecting', 'ultimate', 'Gumby', 'collection', 'kids', 'Instead', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'collection', 'unlikely', 'Rhino', 'will', 'ever', 'correct', 'mistakes']",Gumby w/Gumby figure
694326,A8EO864QVNMC2,B0000639HC,"J. A Miller ""conjammenson""","[3, 8]","Here it is!  All the Gumby episodes packed into one collection.  It is great to be able to watch all the episodes of Gumby, and they are even in chronological order.  However, the set could have been put together way better.  It receives four stars because it is a Gumby box set, the first time all the episodes were put together like this.  Here are some notes on the features of the set:The Soundtrack:  This is a partially annoying part of the set.  They used the synth track made in the 80s for the episodes.  I have many VHS sets made by F.H.E. and they used the original soundtracks.  So, its not as if the original sound was lost or anything like that.  However, Gumby's voice is done by the same person and the rest of the voices are done well enough.Episodes:  I hate the way the episodes are cut up into different parts.  The original 22 episodes were 12 minutes in lenght and then cut up to make 44 6 minute episoeds.  This is not done by Rhino, but was done by the studio way back when.  I have no idea why they did it, but it is annoying.Packaging:  The DVDs do fold out in an awkward way.  I like it though because it is different and makes it unique.  The set also comes with a Gumby figurine.Special Features:  There are several of Clokey's original clay featuers that are cool to watch.  The interview with Clokey himself, however, is very boring.  The interview with the voice of Gumby is better.  It almost seems as though the voice ofGumby likes the series more than the one who created it.Bad points:  The menus and navigation in the set is very annoying.  The Rhino introduction is retarded.  Between each episode there is an introduction to the next one.  The intros are repetetive and really stupid.  I don't like the new gumby song that plays during the menus.  I hate the children singing it.  The navigation is so overly childish that I think even children would be annoyed by it.Overall Value:  The value of having all these gumby episodes availible in this way makes this set worth everything.  The packaging and presentation could have been way better and I have no idea why they chose to go with the soundtrack that they went with.  Maybe they thought modern children would enjoy it more.

If you are going to do an elaborate collection of CLASSIC ANIMATION, it must be restored to it's original elements.  These cartoons have a horrible synthesizer score that were added in the 1980's.  Word is, they didn't want to pay the money to keep the CAPITAL score in.  ... IMAGE issued two GREAT ART CLOKEY 'DAVEY & GOLIATH' discs with wonderful packaging and original CAPITAL MUSIC score!I can't even watch this with the score they used and the continued use of bad music in the menus and NEW animated bumpers.

What galls me (in addition to the mere fact that they would dare release these treasures in this format in the first place) is the marketing which makes NO MENTION of the rotten synthesizer musak and the chopped up episodes.
