1206202,A2G6O6CGG2OER,B001JAMJ0Y,Hellbilly DRP,"[3, 3]","Having seen the short film  ""The Netherbeast of Berm-Tech Industries Inc"" some time ago, I have been eagerly awaiting the DVD release of the feature length film Netherbeast Incorporated. It does not disappoint.Vampires ( or Netherfolk as they prefer to be called ) are among us. Toiling away in cubicles, chanting the same inane corporate slogans. They just want to live their lives and hit their productivity goals. The only major difference is that they must consume human flesh and blood to survive. In order to do so they cloister themselves away in their corporate headquarters, maintaining minimal human contact except for regular shipments of donated blood and the recently deceased. So what happens when the boss loses his mind and starts hiring humans from the outside? We get a movie that lies somewhere between Office Space and From Dusk Till Dawn.The special features are entertaining and add to the experience. They have even included the original short film, which is excellent by itself.All in all, this is a fun movie. There are horror elements and some gore, but they are primarily used to comic effect. If you are a fan of films like Evil Dead or Shaun of the Dead, Netherbeast Incorporated is for you.",4,Do you see an office full of the undead?

1206203,A18HCMNUMJ50Z1,B001JAMJ0Y,"J. Hartigan ""JBob""","[0, 0]",This movie has a decent B or C list cast but it suffers from the format.  The movie starts out with a ton of flashbacks to explain a very complicated situation the movie takes place in.  All of this felt to me like it would have been best broken into 22 minute increments.The story limes are palatable but the lack of budget harms the film immensely.  Eating flesh and human blood isn't an easy special effect I imagine and since it's so critical to the film I'm surprised they didn't pull it off better.It feels like there is a bit of over narration as well. The script could have been rewritten to filter the movie down a tad. If the flick was 15 minutes shorter you wouldn't feel that drag that runs through the whole movie.,2,Would Have Made a Great TV Series,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,727,"['movie', 'decent', 'B', 'C', 'list', 'cast', 'format', 'movie', 'out', 'ton', 'flashbacks', 'explain', 'very', 'complicated', 'situation', 'movie', 'place', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'broken', '22', 'minute', 'increments.The', 'story', 'limes', 'are', 'palatable', 'lack', 'budget', 'film', 'immensely', 'Eating', 'flesh', 'human', 'blood', ""n't"", 'easy', 'special', 'effect', 'imagine', 'so', 'critical', 'film', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'better.It', 'feels', 'bit', 'over', 'narration', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rewritten', 'filter', 'movie', 'down', 'tad', 'flick', 'was', '15', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'drag', 'whole', 'movie']",Netherbeast Incorporated
1206204,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B001JAMJ0Y,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[1, 2]","Otto is the perfect corporate drone who, when summoned to his Boss' office for a new assignment, is justifiably shocked to see a co-worker sprawled in an adjacent chair with a huge wooden stake rammed through his heart.  His Boss however, sees nothing amiss since this is the manner in which one normally dispatches a vampire so to have killed him in any  other way would have been absurd.  Thus begins NETHERBEAST INCORPORATED a mostly successful satire of corporate America disguised as a horror movie.The plot centers around Otto and the other employees of Berm-Tech Industries Inc. (the world's largest makers of telephones) as they try to stop their boss from destroying their safe little cubicled world, because you see, they ARE vampires and so is he for that matter is he, a fact that eludes him due to an inconvenient case of ""vampire Alzheimer's"" which may or may not clear up on it's own. Now these aren't your typical movie vampires and their differences are explained throughout the film via powerpoint presentations. For instance they all live in the same building in which they work , insulated from the general public except for the occasional night on the town. Their ""meals"" are donated blood and unclaimed corpses because these vampires, unlike their Hollywood bretheren, aren't on a strictly liquid diet.  And of course, all employees of Berm-Tech Industries Inc. are Netherfolk like themselves. (That's another difference. They don't refer to themselves as vampires.) No humans are allowed past the receptionist. That is until one day their wacked out boss informs them he has hired an efficiency expert from the outside to come in and get the office ""up to speed.""  And that's just the beginning of the problems. A co-worker goes missing and wacky Mr. Hammond replaces him with a HUMAN temp, a pretty girl to whom Otto quickly becomes attracted.Right now I'm sure you're thinking; Wow, I'm in for a great horror comedy!  But the sad truth is, not so much. NETHERBEAST INCORPORATED opens with a bang and then gradually starts losing all of it's energy. The cast does it's best with the material which is perhaps a bit underwritten in the last two acts. Turner Claymore who plays Boss Darrell Hammond is hilarious as the vampire without a clue, when he's off screen the movie loses a lot of it's interest. Steven Landry (from ""Blues Clues"") as the Dilbert-like Otto is more than adequate, and Judd Nelson is amusing as the efficiency expert who harbors a secret of his own. The thing that really bothered me about the film, so much so that I knocked a whole point off my rating, is the musical score. And I NEVER pay attention to musical scores! It has to be extremely good or extremely bad for me to take note (pun intended) of it. And this score was bad. It was a bit too loud and tended to drown out parts of the dialogue, but worse yet it constantly tried to remind us that we were watching a comedy. It had everything but rim shots in it and was very distracting. A more serious score would have worked to better advantage by being a counterpoint to the comedy.Whatever  the film had to offer in terms of creativity and originality  is ultimately ruined by bad pacing, weak scripting, and an annoying musical score.Can I recommend NETHERBEAST INC.?

1206206,A1G3TFQRYJRTAU,B001JAMJ0Y,"Phillip Dacus ""Meeds Met""","[0, 0]","This was a difficult movie to rate. If I was to rate just on the basis of originality and creativity, I would have rated it higher. Today it seems that Hollywood has an ingredient list for making a movie. Or perhaps its more like a cookie cutter. Most of the time, we see the same plot lines, and the same ole scripts, re-hashed again and again and again. Most movie makers today have no clue how to make a movie that is new, original, and exciting. This movie does not meet all those qualifications either, but it is original.NetherBeast Incorporated is a movie about a corporation that is run by vampires. Yeah, I said vampires. If that is not original and deserving of praise, I dont know what is. If my rating of the movie was based solely on this, I would have give it a 10. Ok, maybe a 8 or 9, cause the plot was not as well thought out as it could have been.The movie started out beautifully. Im not going to tell ya, cause I dont want to give it away. NetherBeast is a dark satirical spin on the office, right down to the goofy boss. In fact, this made me wonder which came first. The office or NetherBeast.NetherBeast has a few short comings. The acting is above par for this sort of independent movie, but was still lacking, especially for a few characters.Though this makes me wonder if it was the acting that was bad, or the writing or direction. After all, even the best actor or actress will suffer from poor writing and direction. Case in point is Judd Nelson. I dont think he is quite as bad of an actor and this movie portrayed him to be. However, I applaud him for choosing a script which probably did not pay him very well.This movie probably had next to no budget at all, so the fact that its special effects were really bad is Im sure of no surprise.What did surprise me though was the poor writing. The movie started out well enough, (I loved the narrated bits that talked about the differences between movie vampirism and the real thing... At least their movie version of the real thing) but by the time we got into the middle, I could tell that the writer was already running out of ideas. By the end part of the movie, ideas had disappeared altogether.It reminded me of Star Trek Voyager. 50 minutes was spent on building up the story line. Then 10 of it was spent on the climax, which was very anti-climatic.So taking all this into consideration, Id give the movie an overall score of 7 out of a possible 10. Mainly because of its originality.Its worth watching!",3,A very surprising comedy,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2488,"['was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'rate', 'was', 'rate', 'just', 'basis', 'originality', 'creativity', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'Today', 'Hollywood', 'ingredient', 'list', 'making', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'more', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'Most', 'time', 'see', 'same', 'plot', 'lines', 'same', 'ole', 'scripts', 're-hashed', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'Most', 'movie', 'makers', 'today', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'new', 'original', 'exciting', 'movie', 'not', 'meet', 'qualifications', 'original.NetherBeast', 'Incorporated', 'movie', 'corporation', 'run', 'vampires', 'Yeah', 'said', 'vampires', 'not', 'original', 'deserving', 'praise', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'rating', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'solely', 'would', 'have', 'give', '10', 'Ok', 'maybe', '8', '9', 'cause', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'beautifully', 'Im', 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'ya', 'cause', 'dont', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'NetherBeast', 'dark', 'satirical', 'spin', 'office', 'right', 'down', 'goofy', 'boss', 'fact', 'made', 'wonder', 'came', 'first', 'office', 'NetherBeast.NetherBeast', 'few', 'short', 'comings', 'acting', 'par', 'sort', 'independent', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'lacking', 'especially', 'few', 'characters.Though', 'wonder', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'writing', 'direction', 'even', 'best', 'actor', 'actress', 'will', 'suffer', 'poor', 'writing', 'direction', 'Case', 'point', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'dont', 'think', 'quite', 'bad', 'actor', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'be', 'However', 'applaud', 'choosing', 'script', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'very', 'well.This', 'movie', 'probably', 'had', 'next', 'budget', 'fact', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'Im', 'sure', 'surprise.What', 'did', 'surprise', 'was', 'poor', 'writing', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'loved', 'narrated', 'bits', 'talked', 'differences', 'movie', 'vampirism', 'real', 'thing', 'least', 'movie', 'version', 'real', 'thing', 'time', 'got', 'middle', 'could', 'tell', 'writer', 'was', 'already', 'running', 'ideas', 'end', 'part', 'movie', 'ideas', 'had', 'disappeared', 'altogether.It', 'reminded', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', '50', 'minutes', 'was', 'spent', 'building', 'up', 'story', 'line', 'Then', '10', 'was', 'spent', 'climax', 'was', 'very', 'anti-climatic.So', 'taking', 'consideration', 'Id', 'give', 'movie', 'overall', 'score', '7', 'possible', '10', 'Mainly', 'originality.Its', 'worth', 'watching']",Netherbeast Incorporated
