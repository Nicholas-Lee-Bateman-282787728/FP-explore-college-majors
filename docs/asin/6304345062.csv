You have Ben Stiller who's playing a very neurotic young man in search of his real parents.  Although this is the  basic plot; the real/underlying story is about a man who's not satisfied  with his life, but is resurrected to excitment when he meets a beautiful,  but strange woman.  Great film.  The cast is ALL STAR....and there are  really good comedic performances here.  Patrica Arquette for instance is  great in her role as the supporting but getting fed up wife.  If you like  her in this film I would suggest watching LOST HIGHWAY where you get to see  her in a very different kind or role (weird horror/thriller film..she goes  topless in it also).

415937,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304345062,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 15]","Split down the middle about this film, I thought that this second outing by David O. Russell did not capture his full potential, but instead demonstrated his budding capacity behind the camera.  I will begin by agreeing with my wife when she commented that this was one of the best ensemble cast films she has ever seen.  Russell manipulated and moved his characters into the right places at the right time that always felt even.  He controlled the screen and moved the story to levels that I never saw coming.  He continually kept fresh images in front of our eyes, and forced his actors, and us, out of their element to progress the story.  It was obvious that Russell was a master behind the camera and was able to ensure that no zigzagging occurred that would cause us to falter or loose sight of our goal.While there didn't seem to ever be a bubble in the movement of the characters and story, where I found most of the bubbles occurring were the actors that helmed the characters.  While each have their own discreet method of acting, I somewhat felt that they all just didn't mesh well in this story.  Stiller was humorous, but lacked the depth that his character needed for us to really understand his plight.  Arquette was sympathetic, but again the depth factor was obvious and there were times where I felt that she just wasn't giving her full potential.  She was in the scenes, but I knew that it was Patricia Arquette and not the character she was to be playing.  I can honestly say ""ditto"" for Tea Leoni's character.  There was just something missing.  Maybe they needed more back story, perhaps we needed to spend more time with them, or perhaps it was the way that these actors pushed their characters that just didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the film for me.  The only actors that really went above and beyond their call in this film were the secondary actors.  Mary Tyler Moore was well out of her element and loving every minute of it (and so were we), Alan Alda and Liv Tyler were perfect together, and the best buddy-cop scene ever in a film could not have been done by anyone other than Josh Brolin and Richard Jenkins.  They did not only provide some of the funniest moments in the film, but their scenes stole the film literally from everyone else.  I could have watched an entire film on just these two and their idiosyncrasies.  That would have been funny.As I look back onto this film I try to think of why I was so conflicted about my feelings towards it.  It had some elements that I just found hysterical and could see Russell's style, but then there were times where I felt the actors were just flubbing this film completely out of control.  This was a family neurosis movie.  What Stiller was trying to do was find a cure for his (and possibly his newborn son) neurosis.  He thought that by finding his true parents he would be able to bring some closure to his life.  This was the focus of the film, but as I watched him go through the motions around his psudo-parents, I felt we lost focus of this goal.  Russell's direction accurately kept us moving along the path, but Stiller was no guide.  His focus throughout this film was about as solid as ice on a spring day.  There are parts where we know where he is going and he is doing great, but other times he falls through the cracks.  Thankfully, he has the secondary characters to back him up and help him out of his pitfalls.  This film was not a perfect fit for Stiller.  I thought for everyone else (sans Arquette), they fit perfectly into their roles.  Stiller just seemed out of place.A ""find-your-true-family"" caper can be funny.  Russell's ""find-your-true-family"" caper is funny, but not hysterically funny.  The humor could have been more adult and articulate.  I thought this was a decent film, but it didn't blow me away as the other Russell films have.  It almost felt as if he had calmed himself down for this film.  He didn't seem as eccentric as he does in his later outings.  Russell goes through the motions and does very well, but his cast is what ultimately brings this film down a notch for me.  Stiller is not a fit, Arquette character could have been played by a mannequin compared to her, and Tea Leoni needed to get some hot Duchovny action ... and soon!  Again, I cannot thank the surrounding cast for their hard work and dedication because without them I don't think I could have survived this film.  Russell's direction is ample, but Stiller's performance ruins.Overall, this is definitely a ""yheaah"" film.  Not quite a ""yea"" and not quite a ""nea"", but somewhere in-between.  If you are a die-hard David O. Russell fan, I suggest checking this film out at least once to experience his power behind an ensemble cast (which again works well in I Heart Huckabees), but it doesn't deserve more than one viewing.  Russell has made better films than this and I think you should stick to them instead of coming back to this one.  Plenty will disagree, but that is how I feel about this film.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Does anybody actually own a white Taurus...,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,5025,"['Split', 'down', 'middle',

Russell's 'Flirting With Disaster.'  I'm not sure why this movie got overlooked by so many people.  My guess is that since it pre-dates 'Something About Mary' by two years, the general populace had not yet caught on to Stiller's talents as 'the perfect comic foil' (to quote the apropros phrase used in the official amazon.com review).And when these friends *do* eventually see it, their response is unanimous: &quot;Wow, how did I miss that one?  Absolutely hilarious.&quot;Exactly.Beyond Stiller, you get the vastly underrated comedic talents of T&eacute;a Leoni.  [Note to the Coen Brothers and others looking to re-create the Cary Grant-era screwball romantic comedy: T&eacute;a's your girl.]  Plus, there are great performances by supporting actors Richard Jenkins (who seems to turn up everywhere), Josh Brolin, Patricia Arquette and an amazing foursome of Alan Alda, Lily Tomlin (both cast WAY against type), George Seagal and Mary Tyler Moore.The key to the movie is the director's touch - David O. Russell put together a stretch of three great movies: 'Spanking the Monkey,' this one, and then followed it up the promise of those two films with 'Three Kings.'  Russell knows how to stage dark and/or subtle comedy (recall how Clooney, Wahlberg and Ice Cube came upon the secret map in Kings).You will love this film.

415948,A31LHED3SKLWVB,6304345062,Darren,"[0, 0]","Having shocked everyone with his black comedy debut about incest, &#34;Spanking the Monkey&#34;, David O. Russell got even more attention from the industry by executing this relatively mainstream comedy.  This is the work of a young man trying to prove to himself what he can do.  Farce is a good trainer (just ask Shakespeare): it forces the writer to construct a tight plot with a large cast.  If you think it's easy, give it a try sometime.  Luckily for Russell, he was ably assisted by what amounts to a dream cast: Ben Stiller, Patricia Arquette, Tea Leoni, Richard Jenkins, and Josh Brolin, along with some heavyweight legends like Mary Tyler Moore, George Segal, Lily Tomlin, and Alan Alda.  One has to wonder if Stiller, with his family connections, was the factor in wrangling together such a storied cast for Russell.It's a road-movie in which Stiller, an adopted child, discovers who his real mother is and drags his young wife Arquette and baby in tow to seek her out.  They travel from New York to San Diego to Michican to New Mexico, chasing down leads that inevitably prove to be dead-ends.  The plot puts them through the usual farcical paces -- misdirections, physical gags, accidents, mistaken identities.  However, the implausibilities of 1) Leoni as an agent for the adoption agency accompanying them and 2) Jenkins and Brolin as FBI agents &#34;along for the ride&#34; because Brolin and Arquette went to high school together, are too much to swallow, no matter how technically well-constructed the plot.  Yeah sure, Shakespeare got away with *two* sets of identical twins in &#34;The Comedy of Errors&#34;, but Russell isn't Shakespeare, now is he?Well, despite the story flaws, there are items of interest here, such as our married couple's apparent willingness to commit adultery -- Stiller with Leoni, Arquette with the bisexual Brolin.  Most (American) movies, even the silliest of comedies, take the path of most resistance to infidelity, in which the protagonist suffers ulcer-causing angst when such a proposition is even considered.  Following that, we get the Big Fight Scene between the spouses after it's revealed that the protagonist even looked at someone else sideways.  Here, the obvious attraction of Stiller and Arquette to their prospective lovers is merely treated as something else to nag each other for, on the order of whose turn it is to change the diapers.  All very unusual for American comedy, but certainly within the bounds of traditional farce from older European sources.  I found it refreshing.  And the quartet of Moore, Segal, Tomlin, and Alda -- the former two Stiller's adoptive parents (New York, uptight, Jewish), the latter two his &#34;natural&#34; parents (Southwest, pretentious, hippies) -- are a delight to watch, and we wish the movie had more scenes with them.I had a good time watching this.  3 out of 5.",3,Entertaining farce,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,2872,"['Having', 'shocked', 'everyone', 'black', 'comedy', 'debut', 'incest', '34', 'Spanking', 'Monkey', '34', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'attention', 'industry', 'executing', 'relatively', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'work', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'prove', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Farce', 'good', 'trainer', 'just', 'ask', 'Shakespeare', 'writer', 'construct', 'tight', 'plot', 'large', 'cast', 'think', 'easy', 'give', 'try', 'sometime', 'Luckily', 'Russell', 'was', 'ably', 'assisted', 'what', 'amounts', 'dream', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'heavyweight', 'legends', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'George', 'Segal', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'One', 'wonder', 'Stiller', 'family', 'connections', 'was', 'factor', 'wrangling', 'together', 'storied', 'cast', 'Russell.It', 'road-movie', 'Stiller', 'adopted', 'child', 'discovers', 'who', 'real', 'mother', 'young', 'wife', 'Arquette', 'baby', 'tow', 'seek', 'out', 'travel', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Diego', 'Michican', 'New', 'Mexico', 'chasing', 'down', 'leads', 'inevitably', 'prove', 'be', 'dead-ends', 'plot', 'usual', 'farcical', 'paces', 'misdirections', 'physical', 'gags', 'accidents', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'However', 'implausibilities', '1', 'Leoni', 'agent', 'adoption', 'agency', 'accompanying', '2', 'Jenkins', 'Brolin', 'FBI', 'agents', '34', 'ride', '34', 'Brolin', 'Arquette', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'together', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'swallow', 'matter', 'how', 'technically', 'well-constructed', 'plot', 'Yeah', 'sure', 'Shakespeare', 'got', 'away', '*two*', 'sets', 'identical', 'twins', '34', 'Comedy', 'Errors', '34', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'Shakespeare', 'now', 'Well', 'story', 'flaws', 'are', 'items', 'interest', 'here', 'such', 'married', 'couple', 'apparent', 'willingness', 'commit', 'Stiller', 'Leoni', 'Arquette', 'bisexual', 'Brolin', 'Most', 'American', 'movies', 'even', 'silliest', 'comedies', 'take', 'path', 'most', 'resistance', 'infidelity', 'protagonist', 'suffers', 'ulcer-causing', 'angst', 'when', 'proposition', 'even', 'considered', 'Following', 'get', 'Big', 'Fight', 'Scene', 'spouses', 'revealed', 'protagonist', 'even', 'looked', 'someone', 'else', 'Here', 'obvious', 'attraction', 'Stiller', 'Arquette', 'prospective', 'lovers', 'merely', 'treated', 'something', 'else', 'nag', 'other', 'order', 'turn', 'change', 'diapers', 'very', 'unusual', 'American', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'bounds', 'traditional', 'farce', 'older', 'European', 'sources', 'found', 'refreshing', 'quartet', 'Moore', 'Segal', 'Tomlin', 'Alda', 'former', 'two', 'Stiller', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'New', 'York', 'uptight', 'Jewish', 'latter', 'two', '34', 'natural', '34', 'parents', 'Southwest', 'pretentious', 'hippies', 'are', 'delight', 'watch', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'scenes', 'them.I', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', '3', '5']",Flirting With Disaster VHS

I laughed repeatedly during the approximately hour and a half it ran, even at those scenes where &#34;disaster&#34; struck (such as when Ben Stiller's character backed a semi-cab into a little frame post office, destroying it and getting himself and his entourage arrested as a result).

The acting itself is simply superb.Then, why just four stars? The downside is that the premise itself is somewhat improbable (that a person working for an adoption agency would go with a married couple on a cross-country trip to find the husband's birth mother, in an inept attempt to document and video the reunion), and the situations in which the threesome (and eventually the five-some, when they are joined by two federal agents who are along for the ride) find themselves are, to say the least, contrived.

Russell made a ramshackle screwball farce back in 1996 that's well worth revisiting on DVD, at least until his next film comes along. He was able to blend character-driven humor with moments of pure slapstick as he tracks the misadventures of Mel Coplin, a neurotic entomologist on a frantic search for his birth parents to resolve his long-standing issues with identity. Tina Kalb, a leggy, off-kilter adoption agency worker thinks she's found Mel's mother in San Diego, so Mel, Tina, and Mel's sweetly frumpy wife Nancy, nursing their five-month baby, embark on a journey that becomes ever more haphazard with every turn of events. Unsurprisingly, an attraction develops between Mel and Tina, who is anxious to get pregnant herself. They meet a gallery of eccentric characters in what becomes a memorably wacky road trip. The real coup with this underappreciated film is the casting. Long before he sold himself up the river with execrably witless comedies likeMeet the FockersandThe Heartbreak Kid, Ben Stiller was a promising actor of relative subtlety, and he expertly mans the rudder as Mel with his skittish self-containment. An actress who never seems to fulfill her potential, T&eacute;a Leoni brings a mix of klutziness and sexy smarts to the incompetent Tina. As Nancy, Patricia Arquette has a soft, fuzzy quality that makes a nice contrast to Leoni's angularity.Russell was smart to cast four veterans as Mel's two sets of parents. As his adoptive parents, George Segal and a cast-against-type Mary Tyler Moore are hilarious playing classic New York Jewish stereotypes. Moore, in particular, has a field day playing the obnoxious dark side of Rhoda Morgenstern rightfully proud of her unsagging breasts. As the couple who turns out to be Mel's real parents, Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin are equally funny as graying New Mexico hippies heavy into their art and LSD. When Mel meets them, that's when the film becomes a whirlwind,Noises Off-type of farce with all the personal shenanigans coming to a head. Playing a gay couple who happen to be FBI agents, a surprisingly deft Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) and the always dependable Richard Jenkins (superb in this year'sThe Visitor) shine as bickering personality opposites. Glenn Fitzgerald as Mel's psychotic brother and Celia Weston as a Reagan-loving Southern matron round out a razor-sharp cast. It all ends rather abruptly, but Russell shows a genuine talent for juggling a lot of comic possibilities with supple dexterity. The 2004 Collector's Edition DVD is light on extras - just three deleted scenes, a few outtakes that don't compare to the final film, and a brief featurette on the film's development and production.",4,Character-Driven Screwball Farce Still Shines with a Stellar Cast,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,2761,"['Absent', '2004', 'misbegottenI', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'made', 'ramshackle', 'screwball', 'farce', 'back', '1996', 'well', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'DVD', 'least', 'next', 'film', 'along', 'was', 'able', 'blend', 'character-driven', 'humor', 'moments', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'misadventures', 'Mel', 'Coplin', 'neurotic', 'entomologist', 'frantic', 'search', 'birth', 'parents', 'resolve', 'long-standing', 'issues', 'identity', 'Tina', 'Kalb', 'leggy', 'off-kilter', 'adoption', 'agency', 'worker', 'found', 'Mel', 'mother', 'San', 'Diego', 'so', 'Mel', 'Tina', 'Mel', 'sweetly', 'frumpy', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'nursing', 'five-month', 'baby', 'embark', 'journey', 'ever', 'more', 'haphazard', 'turn', 'events', 'Unsurprisingly', 'attraction', 'Mel', 'Tina', 'who', 'anxious', 'get', 'pregnant', 'meet', 'gallery', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'what', 'memorably', 'wacky', 'road', 'trip', 'real', 'coup', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'casting', 'Long', 'sold', 'river', 'execrably', 'witless', 'comedies', 'likeMeet', 'FockersandThe', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'promising', 'actor', 'relative', 'subtlety', 'expertly', 'rudder', 'Mel', 'skittish', 'self-containment', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'mix', 'klutziness', 'sexy', 'smarts', 'incompetent', 'Tina', 'Nancy', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'soft', 'fuzzy', 'quality', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Leoni', 'angularity.Russell', 'was', 'smart', 'cast', 'four', 'veterans', 'Mel', 'two', 'sets', 'parents', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'George', 'Segal', 'cast-against-type', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'are', 'hilarious', 'playing', 'classic', 'New', 'York', 'Jewish', 'stereotypes', 'Moore', 'particular', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'obnoxious', 'dark', 'side', 'Rhoda', 'Morgenstern', 'rightfully', 'proud', 'unsagging', 'breasts', 'couple', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Mel', 'real', 'parents', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'are', 'equally', 'funny', 'graying', 'New', 'Mexico', 'heavy', 'art', 'LSD', 'When', 'Mel', 'when', 'film', 'whirlwind', 'Noises', 'Off-type', 'farce', 'personal', 'shenanigans', 'coming', 'head', 'Playing', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'be', 'FBI', 'agents', 'surprisingly', 'deft', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'always', 'dependable', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'superb', ""year'sThe"", 'Visitor', 'shine', 'bickering', 'personality', 'opposites', 'Glenn', 'Fitzgerald', 'Mel', 'psychotic', 'brother', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'Reagan-loving', 'Southern', 'matron', 'round', 'razor-sharp', 'cast', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'Russell', 'genuine', 'talent', 'juggling', 'lot', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'supple', 'dexterity', '2004', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'light', 'extras', 'just', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'outtakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'final', 'film', 'brief', 'featurette', 'film', 'development', 'production']",Flirting With Disaster VHS

Ben Stiller plays Mel Coplin, the (adult) adopted son of Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal. Their constant arguments are hilarious and neurotic. Mel is married to Nancy, played wonderfully by Patricia Arquette (usually I do not like her but she was great in this role). They have just had a baby boy and cannot seem to name him because Mel has hang ups about it. He decides that in order to name the son and to get on with his life he needs to meet his birth parents. He sees an adoption counselor, Tina Kalb (played annoyingly well by Tea Leoni. She is all right but I don't personally see her appeal). Tina informs Mel that she has located his birth mother in San Diego, and this is where the fun ensues. I won't mention all the details because that will ruin much of the fun... but the mishaps and mistakes and problems encountered all along the way have Mel, Nancy, and Tina running all over the US, meeting up with one of Nancy's high school acquaintances in Michigan after they destroy a US post office. Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play Mel's birth parents, and you will scarcely believe the joys that await everyone when they arrive at their house. I have heard mixed reviews of this film, but my own opinion is that it is hilarious and if you listen to all the dialogue, the observations and discussions the characters have is brilliant. Particularly funny is the part of Paul (Richard E.

415964,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,6304345062,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 3]","Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller), the adopted son of two neurotic New Yorkers (Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal) feels that he can't name his new born baby until he finds his roots. This leads to him taking off on a cross-country road trip with his wife (Patricia Arquette), his baby and a woman from his adoption agency (Tea Leoni), which, as the title suggests, leads them from one comical disaster to another.I have now seen all of David O. Russell's films, and of his four films (the other three being ""Spanking the Monkey"", ""Three Kings"" and ""I Heart Huckabees""), ""Flirting with Disaster"" is the one that I had the hardest time making it through. It took me two attempts to make it to the end of this film, and the only reason why I kept going the second time was because I'm a completist and wanted to be able to say that I'd seen all of Russell's films. Needless to say, this film is far from perfect. Many of the characters are abrasive and in-your-face and take a while to get used to, and the plot of this film is the weakest of all of Russell's. Essentially this is just a road film and a large portion of the film comprises Ben Stiller and his entourage travelling from one place to the next, with a comic set piece at each destination. Furthermore, a lot of the jokes in the first half hour I found to be either crude or obvious. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I stuck with this film because, at around the forty minute mark, suddenly this film became really good. By that point I had grown accustomed to the characters, the set-up was complete, and the jokes became really funny. The final half hour of this film, when Stiller finally meets his biological parents (Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda), is absolutely hilarious and made me understand why Russell fans think this is such a great film.  I think Ben Stiller is a very funny and often underrated actor, but it is Tomlin, Alda, Segal and Moore who steal the show here. Each is perfectly cast and plays his or her role to perfection.I am now glad that I decided to buy this film on DVD, rather than rent it. Now that I know what awaits me at the end of this film, I would happily watch it again. I don't think it's as good as ""Spanking the Monkey"" or ""Three Kings"", but it's definitely a lot easier to watch that ""Spanking the Monkey"" (a film about a teenager who falls in love with his mother) and far less ""out there"" than ""I Heart Huckabees"", so probably a very good start for someone interested in learning more about the films of David O.

415973,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6304345062,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 8]","""Flirting With Disaster"" is a wild romp directed by David O. Russell who burst onto the scene with ""Spanking the Monkey"" and has since directed ""Three Kings"" with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg & Ice Cube and ""I Heart Huckabees.""  He does a good job keeping us off balance and having each new scene and character provide something fresh.Ben Stiller has developed into one of the United States' true comic stars.  Son of Jerry Stiller & Anne Meara, his timing is edgy and his ability to portray confused discomfort in awkward situations is classic.  With better known films like ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""Meet the Parents,"" ""Meet the Fockers,"" ""Dodgeball,"" ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" & ""Starsky & Hutch,"" he's developed a large body of excellent work.  As Mel Coplin, he's a quiet family man who has trouble making decisions, like naming their baby who was born months ago.  As an adoptee, he starts out on a search to find his birth parents.Patricia Arquette plays his wife Nancy.  She recently was nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in a drama for the NBC series ""Medium"" (a show that I watch every episode!).  She's previously acted in ""Holes,"" ""Beyond Rangoon"" & ""Little Nicky.""  As Nancy, she seems to be the anchor for the movie, the lone island of sanity in a sea of strange.As the Coplins, Mel's adoptive parents, George Segal plays the father.  From classic films ""The Owl & the Pussycat"" & ""A Touch of Class,"" his lone Oscar nomination was in 1966 as supporting actor for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" with Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor.  His comic sense is in full flare as he pushes and pulls with his wife in an ongoing struggle.  Mary Tyler Moore plays his wife, self-obsessed, chronically uptight & full of complaint.  Tyler's lone Oscar nomination came as best actress in the Robert Redford-directed 1980 film ""Ordinary People.""  The buzz from this film was that she appeared in a provocative black bra that she does indeed wear well!  :)Mel Coplin is assisted in trying to find his birth parents by a psychology student Tina played by Tea Leoni.  She'll soon be seen in ""Fun With Dick & Jane"" with Jim Carrey & Angie Harmon.  Other films where I've enjoyed her performances are the serious disaster movie ""Deep Impact"" and the funny ""Spanglish.""  Here her character is edgy and neurotic, a divorcee attracted to Mel, trudging to the bathroom in provocative black underwear.  She has an uncanny ability to screw things up & continually throw monkey wrenches into what we think SHOULD have been easier.Midway into the picture after Mel thinks he's met his father, a low-brow truck driver, and takes a driving lesson only to flatten a post office & discover his real parents are elsewhere, we run into two agents from the FBI & Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms.  Josh Brolin, son of actor James Brolin, plays Tony who knew Nancy Coplin from high school.  As an actor, Brolin has appeared in Woody Allen's ""Melinda & Melinda,"" ""Bed of Roses,"" & has ""Into the Blue"" out this year.  His partner we discover is also his gay husband Paul played by Richard Jenkins.  Jenkins will star with Leoni & Carrey in ""Fun With Dick & Jane"" and is best known for the HBO series ""Six Feet Under.""  He was nominated as best supporting actor by the Independent Spirit Awards for this film.  Both characters are a mix of the orthodox and unexpected.  Brolin has a scene-stealer where he licks Nancy's armpit as her husband walks in.  Jenkins has a scene-stealer as he's been laced with an overdose of LSD and flits around the countryside in his tighty-whities.The Coplins eventually find their birth parents who are counter culturals making their living by selling LSD-laced decals of Ronald Reagan.  One of the funnies moments is when Mary Tyler Moore misunderstands their last name ""Schlicting"" and calls them the ""Sh*t Kings.""  Alan Alda, known for the long-running ""MASH"" TV series as well as films like ""The Object of My Affection"" with Jennifer Aniston & Paul Rudd and his recent Best Supporting Actor nomination for ""The Aviator,"" plays Richard Schlicting, an old hippy who followed the Grateful Dead.  His wife Mary Schlicting is played by Lily Tomlin to great affect.  She's the perfect counter-cultural earth mother.  Tomlin, whose lone Oscar nomination was for her supporting role in the 1975 film ""Nashville"" and was a delightful Golden Globe nominee for one of my favorite films, ""All of Me"" in 1984, was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in the Independent Spirit Awards for this film.  Both provide wonderful moments and keep the comedy pace bubbling.  Their misfit punk son Lonnie Schlicting is played to great effect by Glenn Fitzgerald who also appeared with Ryan Gosling in the white supremacist film ""The Believer"" and in ""The Sixth Sense.""  His maladjusted neurosis suits the film's wild comedy perfectly.This is a film that keeps moving with overlapping dialogue & nonstop breakneck pacing.  While the characters can be so strange that they border on the irritating, all in all it's a good piece of comic film worth checking out performed by an all-star cast.

Virtually every scene is funny and there are plenty of surprises, keeping you chuckling and on your toes at the same time.To be honest, since the movie stars Ben Stiller, I expected juvenile humor (you know, I'm thinking about gooey hair gel as in Something About Mary and heads exploding off as in Tropic Thunder. And then there's Starsky and Hutch). But now I see that when Ben gets a great script, like this one, he's very good. Everyone in this great cast works together as an ensemble; no one character steals the show, though they all shine in their own way. This is an example of the sum of the parts being greater - and funnier - than the whole.Some of the themes and scenes touch on sex and sexuality, but I think it's okay to watch with teenage kids, if you have them. It doesn't promote or make light of risky or irresponsible behavior.The DVD contains deleted scenes - there are three of them - and for once I agree with the editors that they should have been cut.If it seems like I'm not saying much about the plot, that's because I don't want to spoil any of the laughs or surprises.
