But to get from the outside and see the inner workings all the different people that come in there.  Not all of them are gay, some straight, bi and you have your transexuals as well.  Also of importance was them talking about being safe and everything.  Especially being with what they do and all the people they sleep with.  Its easy to pass that along.  But there is also a bond and kinship that forms between the different people in the bathhouse.The lead actors play it well one being a newbie and the other a seasoned (very) veteran of the bathhouse.  The new guy falls for the seasoned vet and at first all is going good even though things aren't what they seem.  The new guy soon starts to change his attitude towards people since he's been hurt by that one he loved.  It turns around him later on in the film but i wanna go into all that much detail on it.  It's really a movie that you should check out either rent or whatever you have to do.But give Bathhouse a try i believe you'll walk away better for it...this movie is shot in the same way as the director's previous one.  Just so people know what's what...doesnt detract from the movie at all so enjoy Bathhouse i sure did.",4,"Enjoyable, informative",1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,1284,"['was', 'really', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'how', 'bathhouse', 'actually', 'i', 'know', 'what', 'there', 'get', 'outside', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'different', 'people', 'come', 'there', 'Not', 'are', 'gay', 'straight', 'bi', 'have', 'transexuals', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'importance', 'was', 'talking', 'being', 'safe', 'everything', 'Especially', 'being', 'what', 'do', 'people', 'sleep', 'easy', 'pass', 'along', 'also', 'bond', 'kinship', 'different', 'people', 'bathhouse.The', 'lead', 'actors', 'play', 'well', 'one', 'being', 'newbie', 'other', 'seasoned', 'very', 'veteran', 'bathhouse', 'new', 'guy', 'seasoned', 'vet', 'first', 'going', 'good', 'even', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'new', 'guy', 'soon', 'change', 'attitude', 'towards', 'people', 'been', 'hurt', 'one', 'loved', 'around', 'later', 'film', 'i', 'wan', 'na', 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'really', 'movie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'rent', 'have', 'do.But', 'give', 'Bathhouse', 'try', 'i', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'better', 'movie', 'shot', 'same', 'way', 'director', 'previous', 'one', 'Just', 'so', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'doesnt', 'detract', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Bathhouse', 'i', 'sure', 'did']",Bathhouse

The movie is typical of many Philippino gay films, though this one is a bit different given the director's style.  Essentially, a young man is drawn into the local gay bath house.  There we get some idea of the workings of a Philippino bath house.  Emotions flair, love is made, love is lost, and in the end true love is found.  Overall a good movie that I am glad is now part of my collection.",4,Interesting cultural film,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,460,"['film', 'have', 'had', 'buy', 'list', 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'typical', 'many', 'Philippino', 'gay', 'films', 'one', 'bit', 'different', 'given', 'director', 'style', 'Essentially', 'young', 'man', 'drawn', 'local', 'gay', 'bath', 'house', 'get', 'idea', 'workings', 'Philippino', 'bath', 'house', 'Emotions', 'flair', 'love', 'made', 'love', 'lost', 'end', 'true', 'love', 'found', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'now', 'part', 'collection']",Bathhouse
