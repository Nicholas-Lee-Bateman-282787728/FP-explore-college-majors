689033,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005Y6YD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman"" finds Daryl Hannah in the titular role of this HBO remake of the 1958 exploitation cult classic.  Director Christopher Guest goes whole heartedly for a retro Fifties look in this 1993 which tries to take the best parts (so to speak) of the original and enlarge the rest into a feminist allegory.  Once again the story is about poor little heiress Nancy Archer (Hannah), who has been abused all of her life by men from her father, Hamilton Cobb (William Windom) to her swarmy husband, Harry (Daniel Baldwin), who is devoting his limited attention to local bad girl, Honey Parker (Cristi Conaway).  Out driving around in the desert to relieve her sexual frustration, Nancy encounters a flying saucer that zaps her, thereby starting the growth process that will level off at the 50 ft. level (note: the original is ""Foot"" but the remake is ""Ft."").  The teleplay by Joseph Dougherty (who did his first script for ""thirtysomething"") borrows as much from ""The Feminist Manifesto"" as it does from ""King Kong.""  What becomes important is that not even the U.S. military is going to stop Nancy from getting some much needed attention from hubby Harry.  Sure, she could do a lot better than Harry, but that is not suppose to be the final payoff of this little feminine fantasy.This remake does not have the same sort of tacky charm that makes the original so compelling.  But there is still the great unanswered question from both of these films as to how the giant woman's underwear manages to keep up with her growth spurt.  Daryl Hannah is a lot angrier than Allison Hayes was in the original, and it was the latter's decided sense of disinterest during the final rampage (along with the cloth bikini) that made it one of the enduring images of Fifties science fiction.  Ultimately, this is more Guest's film as director, because the entire art direction and visual style of the film is as much a homage to the genre in the Fifties as the original storyline.  The remake does not stand alone because there is too much that works off of the original to allow that to happen, so you have to have seen the 1958 version to fully appreciation this one.  The main thing is that ""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman"" does not take itself seriously, and that makes up for a lot of the film's shortcomings.",4,Daryl Hannah finally hits the big time in this HBO remake,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,2310,"['Attack', '50', 'Ft.', 'Woman', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'titular', 'role', 'HBO', 'remake', '1958', 'exploitation', 'cult', 'classic', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'retro', 'Fifties', 'look', '1993', 'take', 'best', 'parts', 'so', 'speak', 'original', 'enlarge', 'rest', 'feminist', 'allegory', 'Once', 'again', 'story', 'poor', 'little', 'heiress', 'Nancy', 'Archer', 'Hannah', 'who', 'been', 'abused', 'life', 'men', 'father', 'Hamilton', 'Cobb', 'William', 'Windom', 'swarmy', 'husband', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'devoting', 'limited', 'attention', 'local', 'bad', 'girl', 'Honey', 'Parker', 'Cristi', 'Conaway', 'driving', 'around', 'desert', 'relieve', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'Nancy', 'flying', 'saucer', 'thereby', 'starting', 'growth', 'process', 'will', 'level', 'off', '50', 'ft.', 'level', 'note', 'original', 'Foot', 'remake', 'Ft.', 'teleplay', 'Joseph', 'Dougherty', 'who', 'did', 'first', 'script', 'thirtysomething', 'as', 'much', 'Feminist', 'Manifesto', 'King', 'Kong', 'What', 'important', 'not', 'even', 'U.S.', 'military', 'going', 'stop', 'Nancy', 'getting', 'much', 'needed', 'attention', 'hubby', 'Harry', 'Sure', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'Harry', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'final', 'payoff', 'little', 'feminine', 'fantasy.This', 'remake', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'sort', 'tacky', 'charm', 'original', 'compelling', 'still', 'great', 'unanswered', 'question', 'films', 'how', 'giant', 'woman', 'underwear', 'manages', 'keep', 'up', 'growth', 'spurt', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'lot', 'angrier', 'Allison', 'Hayes', 'was', 'original', 'was', 'latter', 'decided', 'sense', 'disinterest', 'final', 'rampage', 'cloth', 'bikini', 'made', 'one', 'enduring', 'images', 'Fifties', 'science', 'fiction', 'Ultimately', 'more', 'Guest', 'film', 'director', 'entire', 'art', 'direction', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'homage', 'genre', 'Fifties', 'original', 'storyline', 'remake', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'allow', 'happen', 'have', 'have', 'seen', '1958', 'version', 'fully', 'appreciation', 'one', 'main', 'thing', 'Attack', '50', 'Ft.', 'Woman', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'up', 'lot', 'film', 'shortcomings']",N/A

689039,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00005Y6YD,Tom Brody,"[3, 3]","ATTACK OF THE 50 ft. WOMAN (1993) is a 90 minute color movie starring Daryl Hannah and Daniel Baldwin.  The story begins with a bus traveling over a desert road in the American southwest.  The bus unloads a bunch of tourists at a visitor's center.  At the center, a ranger introduces a film narrated by a nerdy scientist.  The center is named after the Cobb family, a prominent family in the business community of the area.  The nerdy scientist's comments segue into a flashback.  Thus, the remaining 85 minutes of the film is a flashback.  The actual story begins as follows.  Daryl's character is the daughter of Mr. Cobb, a real estate developer.  She is the young wife of Baldwin, who plays the part of a philanderer, with no discernible job skills.  Daryl parks her Cadillac in town and chats with an elderly shop owner, who is closing up shop and relocating to her father's new shopping mall.  The shop owner is an old friend of the family, as he states that he made the brooch that Daryl wears, and that he had originally made for her mother.The entire story revolves around Daryl being maltreated by her father, just as the father had maltreated Daryl's mother, that is, treating them both like small children or like farm animals.  The next scene shows Daryl visiting her psychologist, who probingly asks her, ""WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET ANGRY,"" apparently referring to Daryl's complacent acceptance of abuse from her husband and from her father.  That evening, Daryl parks at a motel in town (Tony's Shangri-La) where her husband it getting it on with a pretty hairdresser.  Daryl picks up a boulder from the parking lot, and is about to throw it through the window of her husband's Porsche, but she refrains from doing so.At 14 minutes into the film, two more characters are introduced, namely a sheriff (a plump middle-aged man with a decent personality) and his deputy, a young woman who is a tomboy named Charlie.  Daryl is in tears, and she drives away from the motel, and motors through the desert, where she encounters a flying saucer.  The flying saucer sends down a beam that targets her brooch, which eventually causes Daryl to grow 50 feet tall.I was pleased to see RICHARD EDSON playing the part of Tony, the motel manager.  I recognized this actor from his part as the parking lot attendant in FERRIS BUEHLER'S DAY OFF.The film continues to develop the theme of the husband (Daniel Baldwin) trying to steal the family fortune of the Cobb family, and to trick his wife Daryl into giving up her financial interest in the family fortune.  The FATHER also tries to trick Daryl into giving up her interest in the family fortune.  Another theme that continues to be developed, is Daryl's continued love for Baldwin, even though he is engaged in concupiscent behavior with the hairdresser.At 24 minutes into the movie, starts a charming scene in the desert, with Joshua trees as scenery.  The sheriff and the deputy are poking around for evidence of the flying saucer, which Daryl had reported to them.  They encounter an ancient gold miner, named HARD-LUCK EDDIE.  Eddie says, ""You ain't got no claim out here, this here is my mountain.""  The sheriff asks, ""You seen anything out here tonight, Eddie?""  ""Like what?""  ""Like something unusual,"" responds the deputy (Charlie).  ""This here's a desert girly-girl,"" responds Eddie, using a term that I've heard only once before, that is, in MUSIC MAN starring Robert Preston.  Eddie continues, ""What you call unusual don't mean much around here.  I've seen hailstones as big as your head.  I've seen lightning shoot up the ground, up in the clouds. And I've heard stuff too.  WHEN THE WIND GETS TANGLED UP IN THE POWER LINES, IT MAKES THE WIRES SEEM LIKE A CRAZY WOMAN IN LOVE.  Thirty years out here, ain't nothing unusual to me.""The deputy discusses the possibility that a rocket ship had materialized out in the desert, and she asks the sheriff, ""Do you know what that means?""  He responds, ""I sure do.  Overtime, a whole lot of overtime.""  (This is just one example of the excellent script-writing in this film.  In other words, what is excellent is that the sheriff's response is not what the viewer would expect from the deputy's question.)At 38 minutes into the movie, the flying saucer returns, at a point when Daryl has taken her husband (Baldwin) out to the spot where she'd originally seen the saucer.  The flying saucer beams Daryl up, leaving only her slipper on the ground, in a scene evoking the Cinderella story.  Within ten minutes, the flying saucer returns Daryl, where she finds herself on the roof of the building over the hairdresser.  Daryl has amnesia.  Blood tests are run, and it is discovered that her plasma levels of growth hormone have increased.  At 45 minutes into the movie, Daryl is shown to begin growing, and the scene is reminiscent of one particular scene in ALICE IN WONDERLAND, where Alice eats the mushroom that makes her grow.  The next day, begins with a scene where Daryl wakes up in the family barn, belonging to her wealthy family (the Cobb family).From this point on, Daryl has changed in another way as well, in that she has become more assertive, and is no longer nave-acting.  The film provides an excellent textbook contrast between passive people who allow themselves to be trodden upon, and who pretend that abuse does not exist, and normal people who are more assertive.  The movie also provides an excellent depiction of an unfortunate aspect of the human condition, namely, that a certain fraction of the human population chronically engages in trickery, this fraction of humanity has a chronic need to deceive other people and to take advantage of others.  The dialogue is flawless, and is peppered with subtle 1-liners.At 58 minutes, comes a ten minute episode where the sheriff and the deputy discuss things, and sum things up in a unifying theory.  The deputy wonders why Daryl, who is maltreated by her husband (Baldwin) fails to bail out of their marriage, and why she still acts as though she were in love with him.  In the dialogue between the sheriff and the deputy, a parallel is drawn between Daryl's life and Hard-Luck Eddie's life.  The sheriff explains, ""He's been going after that desert looking for gold . . . if he stops looking, he's got to explain to himself what he's been doing for 30 years.  If he quits, he makes himself a fool, but as long as he keeps going, at least he's got hope . . . there comes a point where hope's all there is.""  Then the deputy tries to connect this to Daryl's situation, and she asks, ""Is that love?""  The sheriff answers, ""No, that's not love.  That's the thing people call love when they don't want to realize they've wasted their lives.""ATTACK OF THE 50 ft. WOMAN is quite similar to ALIEN TRESPASS, except that ALIEN TRESPASS is suitable for children of all ages, while ATTACK OF THE 50 ft. WOMAN might be reserved for kids over 16 years old (and adults) because there are one or two scenes of Baldwin and the hairdresser engaged in intimate congress.  Both movies have glowingly intense colors. Both movies have flying saucers.  ATTACK OF THE 50 ft. WOMAN has excellent special effects, showing Daryl Hannah as a 50 foot woman, for example, where her clothes rip open when she grows, or when she faints and falls through the roof of a farmhouse.  Most male viewers enjoy the fact that Daryl, and the actress playing the hairdresser, are abundantly easy on the eye (though it might be added, that beauty in the eye of the beholder who is writing this review, is measured in part by the number of research publications that the woman has published in the field of biology, e.g., biochemistry or microbiology).  Both movies include a sheriff and a deputy, though the sheriff in ALIEN TRESPASS is a confirmed redneck, in contrast to the sheriff in ATTACK OF THE 50 ft. WOMAN is decent, and is a fine philosopher on the ""human condition.""  I have only disclosed the first hour of the film.  The ending is a gentle one  -- nobody gets blown up or consumed.  This is a great film for repeated viewing, since clever subtleties will be more apparent when the film is watched again and again.  In addition to ALIEN TRESPASS, I would like to add a third movie to this list, namely, THE BLOB starring Steve McQueen.  All three movies share much in common.  This is a trilogy of sci-fi comedies.  FIVE STARS.",5,Excellent ensemble acting.  Not one word of dialogue is out of place.
