It is hands down the best Marvel movie ever made and launched a reboot franchise that is breaking box office records.  Iron Man 2 I downgraded to a 3.8, but it was still very entertaining despite the criticisms.  The Avengers blew my mind and catapulted the viewer score to a 4.5.  But this latest movie in the franchise lacks something the others had:  Character and solid entertainment.  Sure there were great, ground-breaking special effects.  And yes we get to see some really cool ideas and action sequences.  However the characters seemed less important and the soul of the movie was edited out to move along a plot-line that seemed confusing and unoriginal.  With a different director and editor on this film, it didn't fare as well.  Why did Jon Favreau make `Cowboys and Aliens' when he could have made a better Iron Man 3?  Not to say don't see this mind you.  If you like Iron Man, you'll like this film, but you won't love it.  No, it's unfortunately lost most of the charm that the characters demanded of you from the first film.  And the villain was pretty much forgettable and badly written.  I mean, what happened to the Mandarin?  Comic book aficionados should be furious!  So due to the lack of story interest, I give this special effect romp a 3.3/5 stars.  Overall, it's just not as good as the others, but not as bad as most of the other non-marvel action movies that have come along lately.  But if you are gonna see it, do it in the theaters. The home theater will not do this movie justice.

I feel jipped big time. This film is funny, exciting and action packed, but it lacks the cool fun that the first 'Iron Man"" had in spades. Tony is not strong like I wanted my hero to be. Tony goes from being a confident, cocky superhero to a weak confused one. He's having anxiety attacks throughout the entire film and not getting along with Pepper which I thought was dumb and annoying. Also; there is a huge part in the middle of this very long film with Tony Stark and a random young boy. This part could have been cut out and no one would have every missed it. Huge wast of my time. Beware! And the biggest turn off is the negative feelings that are sent out over the awesome Iron Man suits. Every time you see Tony's awesome Iron Man suit it's beat up and damaged. WHAT! WHY?! AND...No one in there right mind would ever blow up those awesome suits on purpose. I hated that part. A lot. The villain (played by Guy Pierce), was good but too strong, seeming too superhuman for a metal suited man to not be able to deck him easily enough. So now the suits are blown up. Is Tony Stark done with the Avengers? What's going on here? Over all this film was sadly a fail for me. I think ""Iron Man"" the first film is a A+ film. The second ""Iron Man 2"" I hated, I give it a D. Now this one was a bit better, but still not as good as the first. Too bad.

He miraculously finds the perfect shed to dump his suit into, and meets the perfect ally in a kid who looks to be about 11. Then he suddenly has access to a car, which he hops into and drives off. Where did that come from?In the scene where Tony is driving and he talks to the boy, it is stated that Jarvis is not all the way back to 100% and that he mixes up the last word in sentences. This happens once during the conversation to underscore the point, but doesn't happen again in the same conversation.The Mandarin was a sloppy disappointment. Enough said there.As someone else stated, why did Tony not have surgery in the beginning to remove the arc reactor? Suddenly this is a viable option?A brief nod is given to the Vice-President being involved in the plot, but that's all. No explanation, or follow up.This movie was just plain sloppy and poor.

Miller,"[1, 2]","Iron Man 3 [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray] [Region Free] [UK Release] Marvel Studios [Marvel Avengers Assemble] unleashes the best Iron Man adventure yet with this must-own, unprecedented global phenomenon starring Robert Down Jr.When Tony Stark/Iron man finds his entire world reduced to rubble, he must use all his ingenuity to survive, destroy his enemy and somehow protect those he loves. But a soul-searching question haunts him: Does the man make the suit&#8230;or does the suit make the man? Featuring spectacular special effects. Marvel&#8217;s Iron Man 3 explodes with exclusive Blu-ray &#8482; content, including a gag reel, deleted scenes and never-before-seen Marvel short film.Cast: Robert Downing Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Paul Bettany, Jon Favreau, Sir Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, William Sadler, James Badge Dale, Ashley Hamilton, Stephanie Szostak, Ty Simpkins, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan, Dale Dickey, Miguel Ferrer and Rebecca MaderDirector: Shane BlackProducers: Jon Favreau, Stan Lee, Charles Newirth, Louis D'Esposito and Victoria AlonsoScreenwriters: Shane Black and Drew PearceCinematographer: John TollComposer: Brian TylerAudio: English: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: 5.1 DTS-HD HR, Flemish/Russian: 5.1 Dolby Digital and English: 2.0 Dolby Audio DescriptionsSubtitles: English, English for the hearing impaired, Arabic, Dutch, Greek, Russian and FrenchResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 2.40:1Region: All RegionsRunning Time: 125 minutesNumber of discs: 2Studio: Marvel/ParamountAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review - After the box office and critical success of 'The Avengers', 'Iron Man 3' is the first entry of Marvel's Cinematic Universe Phase Two. Or, the first stand-alone adventure that will keep audiences happy until 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'.Picking up after &#34;the events in New York City&#34;, we find ex-military industrialist turned self-made superhero, Tony Stark [Robert Downey Jr] a shell of his former self. Sure, he's still acerbic and brilliant and snarky, but Tony's suffering from superhero PTSD. He can't sleep, thanks to recurring nightmares of falling through an inter-dimensional wormhole, and any brief mention of New York is enough to give him an extreme anxiety attack. Tony, being who he is, knows he needs help, but instead spends time tinkering, creating and building an entire fleet of new Iron Man suits.While Tony is close to cracking, two events threaten to send him all the way over the edge. First, an international terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin [Sir Ben Kingsley] is bombing US targets around the world. There have been nine attacks thus far, and the weird part is investigators have been unable to find any trace of the bombs, or The Mandarin. Second, a man named Aldrige Killian [Guy Pearce] returns from Tony's past to pitch Pepper Potts [Gwyneth Paltrow] who is not only Tony's girlfriend, but the President of Stark Industries on a new technology that will allow them to hack and unlock the full potential of the mind. Tony's long time bodyguard, Happy [Jon Favreau], thinks Killian has romantic eyes for Pepper. When Happy is nearly killed in the next Mandarin attack, Tony, in complete denial of his current capabilities, publicly invites The Mandarin to bring his jihad right to Tony's literal front door, where upon Iron Man gets his ass fully kicked and left for dead.An Iron Man adventure where Tony Stark is all alone and stripped of his super-suit. What a terrific challenge. A man who, in previous adventures, flies around the world to blow up his enemies, must rely on wits and MacGyver-style creativity to solve a series of mysterious bombings before The Mandarin can attack on America's highest office. What a fantastic choice to liven up the franchise that seemed a little stalled in its second entry.The action scenes themselves are also well paced and framed, with a clear sense of geography. Having seen the film a couple times now, it's still a pretty exciting thrill ride. Brian Tyler's score is great too, really upping the emotional connection to the story as well as the suspense and tension. The more I watch 'Iron Man 3', the more I like it. The nit-picks listed above aren't even terrible problems, or boring scenes. I'm just wondering if one undercuts tension and the other feels a little forced. And, while I think Tony Stark/Iron Man works best when balanced out by the entire team, there are so many ambitious, bold, and smart choices going on with this movie, it's not hard to rank 'Iron Man 3' as one of the better Marvel features. If you're a little tired of the same old superhero movie, or of the 'Iron Man' franchise, you might just want to give this one another look.3-D Video Quality - Marvel's 3-D conversions have been hit or miss. 'The Avengers 3D' looked pretty great, but darker movies like 'Thor' have been less impressive. 'Iron Man 3' is brimming with night-time action sequences, and they look pretty crummy. You're missing details all around, and colours are muted. The real trouble with this conversion is the film's framing and editing style. 'Iron Man 3&#8217; is clearly shot and edited for two dimensions - meaning, the cuts are a little too quick, and individual shots are framed with lots of out of focus foreground characters / objects. Despite the flaws, not everything is a visual disaster. Like I said, crank up your brightness (if possible), and night sequences look a little better. Even before I made the adjustment, there are some sequences that are outright striking and beautiful. The JARVIS interactive crime scene map is gorgeous. The mansion attack and Air Force One sequences look great too. And, like its 2-D sibling, the film's clarity and overall resolution are top notch, especially during daytime scenes.-D Video Quality - As we expect from modern, digitally shot blockbusters, 'Iron Man 3' excels at resolution and fine details. Everything is sharp and crisp and in focus, even things in darker areas of the frame. The film's colour palette ranges from golden sunsets to cool winter exteriors to lush and vibrant tropical Miami; all render well. Skin tones are even. Visual Effects integration is seamless. The only minor flaws are a couple quick moments of banding in night, or underwater shots, and some slightly grey black levels. Overall 'Iron Man 3' is a fantastic 2-D high definition presentation that is, clearly demo material.Audio Quality - Not to be outdone, Marvel/Paramount's 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track is the equivalent of a fleet of flying, weaponised armours. The surround channel goes big and bold, without ever pushing too hard, losing control, or letting up. Explosions, repulse blasts, thrusters, tearing metal, crumpling steel, clanking suits of destruction, Extreme-powered punches... all backed by incredible power and tremendous presence. All the while, the rear speakers provide constant, ever-reliable backup, with laser-guided directionality, whiplash cross-channel pans, and a fiendishly immersive sound field. Dialogue and dynamics are capital-P perfect as well, with grounded, crystal clear, masterfully prioritized voices and effects, well-balanced action sequences, and carefully infused music. Not a single criticism sullied my notes. By my estimation, Iron Man 3 is armed with a faultless AV presentation that easily stands as one of Marvel/Paramount's best of the year.Special Features and Extras:These Extras are only accessed on the 2nd Blu-ray disc.Marvel One-Shot: Agent Carter (HD 15 minutes) Girl power, circa WWII, comes courtesy of Marvel's latest entertaining &#34;One-Shot&#34; short film: Agent Carter, starring Hayley Atwell as Steve Rogers' wartime flame Peggy Carter, Bradley Whitford as her chauvinistic boss, Tim Trobec as a guard who has a tough time screaming, and Dominic Cooper in a brief appearance as Howard Stark. The plot is simple - Carter, anxious to get in on the action and earn some respect from her male colleagues, tackles a dangerous mission without authorization and all by her lonesome - the action is fierce, and the fun is in full swing.Iron Man 3 Unmasked (HD 11 minutes) A brisk behind-the-scenes featurette that offers a lot of great information before wrapping much too quickly. Another hour of Behind-the-scene footage, production titbits and interviews please. Still, it's well worth watching, and serves as a nice appetizer before digging into the disc's commentary.Deconstructing the Scene: Attack on Air Force One (HD 9 minutes) It's hard to believe how much of the Air Force One scene was shot practically, and this scene breakdown featurette reveals just how much time, effort and ingenuity went into making one of the film's key action sequences as effective as it is.Deleted and Extended Scenes (HD 16 minutes) A rather lengthy toy box packed with cuts, extensions, improvisations, outtakes, and more traditional deleted scenes; some good, some hilarious, some wisely exorcised from the final film.Gag Reel (HD 5 minutes) Downey Jr gets his Stark on, Paltrow drops a few censored F-bombs, Cheadle cracks up, and the rest of the cast join in the hijinks in this semi-decent outtake montage.Exclusive Look at Thor: The Dark World (HD 2 minutes) Short but sweet, this exclusive glimpse at Thor's upcoming sequel is a satisfying - albeit truncated - tease that left me begging for more.Commentary By Shane Black and Drew Pearce: Director/co-writer Shane Black and co-writer Drew Pearce provide a complete and thorough rundown of all things Iron Man 3, with a rapid-fire, dryly funny commentary that slips humour amidst its insight to engaging, eventually revealing ends. The discussion that evolves is quite fascinating too, as it avoids shot-by-shot dissections in favour of broader thematic, philosophical, narrative and cinematic lectures that shed light on a more thoughtful, textural and explorative Iron man 3 than any of us may have realised.Finally, you gotta hand it to Robert Downey Jr, the man owns the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point, and it's hard to imagine it without him. Thanks to a series of smart and subversive choices by the filmmakers, 'Iron Man 3' is a character-based thriller that harkens back to the 90s action movies where co-writer/director Shane Black came of age. As a Blu-ray release, this 3-D version of the film is far from a perfect conversion, but despite this, it was a thoroughly high octane visual experience, that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The 2-D picture quality is outstanding, save for a few extremely minor quibbles. The 7.1 channel surround mix, the same on both discs, is reference quality. Plus also with a brilliant audio commentary (one of the best I've heard in some time), Iron Man 3 comes Highly Recommended. Enjoy.Andrew C.

1559094,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUO72,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Superhero movies are making a HUGE comeback and have continued to rack up dollars at the box office for the past couple years.  You can thank Sam Raimi and Christopher Nolan for revamping our interest in the genre.  With `Iron Man' making a giant splash with critics and audiences in 2008, it was only a matter of time before Robert Downey Jr. became a franchise all his own (since he IS Iron Man), and now in 2013 his name is synonymous with big budget Hollywood franchises.  In fact, if Daniel Craig hadn't snagged the role back in 2006, I'm sure Robert Downey Jr. would have jumped at the chance to be a superhero, a sleuth AND a spy.But, back to `Iron Man'.The reviews and reception of `Iron Man 2' was dismal (and deservedly, since outside of Scarlett Johansson's hotness, the film was a mess) and so they really needed `The Avengers' to be a hit, and it was, to the point that `Iron Man 3' became one of the most anticipated films for all boys over the age of two and under the age of dead.I'm late to this party.  I missed it while it was in the theaters and so I had to wait until Redbox would let me rent it, and even then I waited a few weeks for some reason unknown to myself.  I finally wrapped my eyes around this visual spectacle last night, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I will say this as preface; I really, really loved the first `Iron Man'.  I hated the second one.  I found `The Avengers' to be, quite easily, the most overrated movie of 2012.  I liked it, but my god was it pimped out to be the second coming of superhero movies, and in a year where Nolan closes out the most impressive trilogy in superhero history, you have to do better than that.  It was fun, but rather messy, cluttered and underwhelming.I know that I'm in the minority.`Iron Man 3' takes place after the events that happened in `The Avengers', so if you haven't seen `The Avengers' you're going to be about as confused as my wife was while watching this last night and seeing Tony Stark have spastic panic attacks when someone mentions the word `alien' or `wormhole'.  So Stark is going through his thing, but the world is going through something else.  Explosions are taking lives and some creepy man of questionable (and ambiguous) ethnic decent is taking over the airwaves to make threats and take credit for destruction.  He calls himself Mandarin, and the world is in a state of panic because of him.  Stark is sidetracked, but then things get personal and Tony has to man up, grab the machine by the wires and MAKE.PEOPLE.PAY!Shane Black does a really nice job of keeping the action the center of attention, and the action is worth noting since it is done so well.  The action starts relatively quickly, and it remains steady throughout the film's two hour, ten minute running length.  I'll be the first to point out that the final fight sequence between Stark and his real rival is WAY TOO LONG, but it's still entertaining.  These scenes are glossy and sharp and upgrade the series previous installments, showing growth and not just a lot of the same (the underwater sequence is remarkable).Another thing that `Iron Man 3' gets very right is the balance of humor and realism.  The film has its stark dramatic core and yet Downey Jr. is so easy and effortless in his role that he exudes such natural charm and his humor is spot on.  The dialog between Stark and Hogan and Rhodes are littered with sharp jabs and a lot of fun.And let's just say that Ben Kingsley is amazing here for SO MANY reasons.I never followed the comics, so I can't voice in on the treatment of Mandarin, but I do understand that fans have mixed emotions about it here.  I thought it was brilliant, but that's mostly because Kingsley handles it so well.  The rest of the cast is fine, but nothing remarkable.  Hall is wasting her career, Pearce is too obvious, Cheadle has become so boring and Favreau has so little to do, but Paltrow is great and Badge Dale is effective.It's a tad long, the last act is drug out too much and the finale feels like a `Dark Knight Rises' rip off, but the film is far more focused than `The Avengers' and Downey Jr. was really born for this (a far better fit for him than that of Sherlock Holmes), and those effects are jaw dropping.",4,Third times a charm...,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,4258,"['Superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'making', 'HUGE', 'comeback', 'have', 'continued', 'rack', 'up', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'can', 'thank', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'revamping', 'interest', 'genre', 'Iron', 'Man', 'making', 'giant', 'splash', 'critics', 'audiences', '2008', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'became', 'franchise', 'own', 'Iron', 'Man', 'now', '2013', 'name', 'synonymous', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'franchises', 'fact', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'had', ""n't"", 'snagged', 'role', 'back', '2006', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'would', 'have', 'jumped', 'chance', 'be', 'superhero', 'sleuth', 'spy.But', 'back', 'Iron', ""Man'.The"", 'reviews', 'reception', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'was', 'dismal', 'deservedly', 'outside', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'hotness', 'film', 'was', 'mess', 'so', 'really', 'needed', 'Avengers', 'be', 'hit', 'was', 'point', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'films', 'boys', 'age', 'two', 'age', 'dead.I', ""'m"", 'late', 'party', 'missed', 'was', 'theaters', 'so', 'had', 'wait', 'Redbox', 'would', 'let', 'rent', 'even', 'then', 'waited', 'few', 'weeks', 'reason', 'unknown', 'finally', 'wrapped', 'eyes', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'will', 'say', 'preface', 'really', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'hated', 'second', 'one', 'found', 'Avengers', 'be', 'quite', 'easily', 'most', 'overrated', 'movie', '2012', 'liked', 'god', 'was', 'pimped', 'out', 'be', 'second', 'coming', 'superhero', 'movies', 'year', 'where', 'Nolan', 'out', 'most', 'impressive', 'trilogy', 'superhero', 'history', 'have', 'do', 'better', 'was', 'fun', 'rather', 'messy', 'cluttered', 'underwhelming.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority.', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'place', 'events', 'happened', 'Avengers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Avengers', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'confused', 'wife', 'was', 'watching', 'last', 'night', 'seeing', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'have', 'spastic', 'panic', 'attacks', 'when', 'someone', 'word', 'alien', 'wormhole', 'Stark', 'going', 'thing', 'world', 'going', 'something', 'else', 'Explosions', 'are', 'taking', 'lives', 'creepy', 'man', 'questionable', 'ambiguous', 'ethnic', 'decent', 'taking', 'over', 'airwaves', 'make', 'threats', 'take', 'credit', 'destruction', 'Mandarin', 'world', 'state', 'panic', 'Stark', 'sidetracked', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'personal', 'Tony', 'man', 'up', 'grab', 'machine', 'wires', 'MAKE.PEOPLE.PAY', 'Shane', 'Black', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'keeping', 'action', 'center', 'attention', 'action', 'noting', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'action', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'steady', 'film', 'two', 'hour', 'ten', 'minute', 'running', 'length', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'point', 'out', 'final', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Stark', 'real', 'rival', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'LONG', 'still', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'are', 'glossy', 'sharp', 'upgrade', 'series', 'previous', 'installments', 'showing', 'growth', 'not', 'just', 'lot', 'same', 'underwater', 'sequence', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'very', 'right', 'balance', 'humor', 'realism', 'film', 'stark', 'dramatic', 'core', 'yet', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'so', 'easy', 'effortless', 'role', 'such', 'natural', 'charm', 'humor', 'spot', 'dialog', 'Stark', 'Hogan', 'Rhodes', 'are', 'littered', 'sharp', 'jabs', 'lot', 'fun.And', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'amazing', 'here', 'SO', 'MANY', 'reasons.I', 'never', 'followed', 'comics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'voice', 'treatment', 'Mandarin', 'do', 'understand', 'fans', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'here', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'mostly', 'Kingsley', 'so', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'Hall', 'wasting', 'career', 'Pearce', 'too', 'obvious', 'Cheadle', 'become', 'so', 'boring', 'Favreau', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'Paltrow', 'great', 'Badge', 'Dale', 'effective.It', 'tad', 'long', 'last', 'act', 'drug', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'finale', 'feels', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'rip', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'focused', 'Avengers', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'really', 'born', 'far', 'better', 'fit', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'effects', 'are', 'jaw', 'dropping']",N/A

1559100,AS1ULPDB6F056,B008JFUO72,Ann Romney,"[1, 6]","This movie was fabulous, plain and simple. And one of the interesting things about it is that it just shows you how much it means to be a ""movie star.""I had just watched the Emmys a couple of days ago, and then watched this. There may be few people with less charisma than Neil Patrick Harris, but in this politically correct age, even without charisma, they let him host the Emmys. That said, watching Iron Man 3 shows you just what a movie star is, namely Robert Downey Jr.  Since I had just watched the Emmys, it really started the neurons burning about how great it is to watch a movie star do what movie stars do. Maybe next years the Emmys will get a movie star to host them so they can be interesting.Back to the movie, a couple of reviews say, ""misdirection,"" well yah sure, but it isn't cheating misdirection where they come out of left field and you feel cheated. It is ""complicating the plot,"" as one needs to do to have a complete story. One might also note that Don Cheadle was great and there wasn't any of that ""oh we were slaves"" that seems to be so popular today. Seriously, it would be nice if that could be packed away. Don Cheadle didn't seem to speak ""black English,"" was crisp and good-looking, macho, and overall great. Compare that to the whining Oprah in The Butler? Who doesn't want to be around Don Cheadle so shall we talk racism or shall we talk what kind of person we want to be around...What I really liked about it, if memory is correct, is that even though this is a Shane Black movie, I didn't hear the ""f-word"" even one time. If that isn't a cause for celebration what is? And Gwenyth Paltrow? Well let's celebrate having a woman as the female lead who doesn't have altered breasts.

1559103,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B008JFUO72,Anthony L.,"[10, 15]","Living in China has it's perks.Cinema tickets are dirt cheap, for one. The movies stay in theatres longer. China is the fastest growing movie market, and many big Hollywood films (Looper, Iron Man 3, World War Z, Transformers 4) are catering to China to capitalize investment, leading to cool bonus features, premieres, and early releases.There are downsides, though.On a good year, 15 blockbusters will come out (The only 2013 Hollywood films to come to China so far are: Oz: The Great and Powerful, Jack the Giant Slayer, Oblivion, Iron Man 3, The Croods, Man of Steel, and Star Trek Into Darkness. UPDATE: After Earth, White House Down, Fast and Furious 6, and Pacific Rim have come too). They will ALL have Chinese subtitles. None of them (except for the aforementioned China-Hollywood partnerships) will be released on time, leaving viewers like me waiting as long as a month to see a film. I had to go to Hong Kong to see The Hobbit in theatres. And worst, to watch a film with a Chinese audience is destroy the sacred ritual of movie watching, and open up to a barrage of jabbering, phone calls, and Chinese ads before the movie.But I'm not complaining. Well, I kind of am. But this system means that only the biggest films come into China, sparing us from the chaff and Adam Sandler comedies. Who wouldn't want that?...So that's a run down of foreign cinema in China, told from a first-hand basis. Lets get down to Iron Man 3.The film, directed by Shane Black of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang fame, got a lot of buzz for having roughly 5 minutes of extra, only-seen-in-China bonus features. It was rumoured to star veteran character actor WANG XUEQI and superstar FAN BINGBING (A very popular Chinese actress and model. Think the Chinese Angelina Jolie. I actually had the pleasure of bumping into her one night as she was swarmed around by jubilant fans while visiting the Canton Tower. True story!)...So what of the extra footage? Well, to put it simply - mildly, even...it was TERRIBLE. The scenes had a knack for completely and utterly destroying all tension in the film. They were conveniently placed around action scenes or strategic emotional moments to just let the tension fall from the movie. Don't get me wrong; the bonus scenes did not ruin the film, which I greatly enjoyed, and found it fun, action-packed, emotional, and, at times, hilarious. Review and overview of the scenes below, but first, you'll have to forgive me - my Chinese is not fluent, but I get around. So don't expect fancy translations. Also, I have never seen the foreign theatrical version, so if you people NOT in China have seen a scene here, let me know in the comments.SCENE 1: At the party in 1990, Tony Stark is introduced to a Dr. Wu (Wang Xueqi), by Dr. Yinsen (see Iron Man). He is told Wu is one of the foremost authorities on advanced surgery: something that will come up later on in the film. Wu talks to Tony in straight Chinese. Tony does not understand, but laughs and says, ""I like your style"" and invites him to ""Party sometime"". This is the best of the bonus scenes, and the only time Downey Jr. has contact with any of the Chinese actors.SCENE 2: Dr. Wu is seen back in China, years later. TV screens in the background show Iron Man in Beijing, school-children clapping, and Wu shaking hands with the metal-suited billionaire before he blasts off into the sky. He then gets on the phone with someone who is suspected to be JARVIS (Tony's robot helper), where he talks for several minutes. I have no idea what he was saying, but it was dull, unnecessary, and basically served as filler while they stuck in product placement. I later learned he is looking to contact Stark, urgently.Smack dab in the most obvious place on the screen is the word ""ZOOMLION"" - the name of a construction company.SCENE 3: An unmemorable continuation of the above. Wu continues to talk on the phone. He is careful, reserved, as if talking to someone important.SCENE 4: This scene takes place after the climax. Fan Bingbing is seen walking down a hospital corridor wearing an unconvincing nurse's outfit, but looking gorgeous, carrying some papers. She opens the door to Dr. Wu's office, and OHMIGOD, what in the name of the great green goblin? He's pouring himself a drink. Of a cheap, common soymilk drink, available in every hole-in-the-wall shop. This is the most shameless product placement I have _ever_ seen.SCENE 5: The two characters - Wu, and his assistant, prepare for their operation on Tony Stark. They wash their hands, stare at themselves in mirrors, and put on surgical gloves. This is so melodramatic and overdone it looks like a cheap Chinese soap opera. I wanted to throw something at the damn screen. They talk about how dangerous it is, and what is at stake. They realize they are risking the life of the world's most powerful superhero.SCENE 6: Tony Stark is seen under the knife as Dr. Wu operates on him. Acupuncture needles are seen in his arms, and Wu removes a tiny piece of shrapnel from his chest with forceps, then drops it as it is sucked up by an electromagnet, where several other pieces of shrapnel are seen.SCENE 7: Wu is seen on another phone call, where he is glad to know that the mission worked out all right.All the scenes comprise perhaps 4-5 minutes.BONUS: The two actors get placement in the credits.MEGA-DISAPPOINTMENT: For some unfathomable reason, there is NO post-credit scene with Mark Ruffalo. I stayed until the screen went black. Nothing, nada, &#27809;&#26377;!Conclusion: There is literally _nothing_ to miss in the Chinese scenes, which feature wooden acting, poor plot and dialogue, and shameless product placement. They do not contribute to the film in anyway, but they do not detract from it, as evinced by Iron Man 3's billion dollar payout.................What did I think of the film itself? I liked it very much! Shane Black directs with style, the action is fast-paced, explosive, and engaging, the screenplay is sharp and witty, and filled with twists, Robert Downey Jr. IS _the Bomb_, Ben Kingsley steals the scenes, the plot is action-packed, surprisingly emotional, and with a satisfying conclusion. The score by Brian Tyler is completely fantastic - reminding one of the James Bond theme. My favorite movie soundtrack of the year, tied with Hans Zimmer's operatic Man of Steel score.I predicted this would be a money-making success from the very beginning. It's nothing serious, nothing weighty - just Marvel firing on all cylinders, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster. It _does_ have problems - that Mandarin Twist is now infamous and makes a sizeable portion of the audience feel cheated, and there are numerous plot holes (In one scene, one of the Extremis soldiers heats up his hand to metal-melting temperate...with his WATCH on!)But I chose to play along with the twists, and was swept away with the ride.And what a ride it is!4.1 Stars! Highly Recommended!...I hope you enjoyed my review on the Chinese scenes in Iron Man 3. If you missed them, there is really no need to worry. But if you really DO want to see them, Marvel is releasing a One Shot (short film) called The Prologue that will feature these China only scenes.Cheers from China!",4,Iron Man 3 + Chinese Scenes

1559105,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B008JFUO72,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[5, 8]","3.5 out of 5An evil mastermind terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is wreaking havoc via a rash of bombings, holding the world in his grip. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets on the case and discovers the bombings are initiated by people exposed to the Extremis program, something Stark Industries could've had ties to a long time ago, but chose not to. Turns out those Tony Stark knew back then are neck-deep involved with what's going on now, have re-entered his life, and are making things complicated.While trying to pinpoint the location of the Mandarin, Iron Man aka Tony is also dealing with the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion of New York in The Avengers. Having trouble sleeping, he's been spending all his time constructing various Iron Man armors to help himself cope. This brings tension to his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who he's now living with and is dedicated to.Upon discovering the location of the Mandarin and his true identity, Iron Man and his almost-sidekick the Iron Patriot aka War Machine aka Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) head up against a battalion of Extremis-infected warriors and must pull out all the stops to put an end to their reign of terror. The problem is these Extremis soldiers are so powerful that victory doesn't seem likely.Can Iron Man prevail against an army as strong as he is?I'm not sure what to make of this movie. Sure, it was entertaining and the storyline was fine. I like the idea of making it a direct follow up to The Avengers, and showing how Tony Stark's world--never mind the rest of the world--had been affected by the Chitauri invasion and the presence of the other Avengers.This flick was loaded with solid action, tough bad guys, cool tech, guns and everything else that makes an Iron Man movie a lot of fun. I just wasn't sold on the presentation. This might be harsh, but this flick came off as the Batman Forever of the Iron Man movies. I'm all for humor in even the most serious of movies, but it seemed the jokes were either too forced or too slapstick to make me take this flick seriously. And that's the secret with superhero movies: they need to take themselves seriously--even if they're meant to be a comedy--otherwise they'll never work. There was an awful lot of getting in and out of the Iron Man suits in this film, both by Tony and Rhodey, never mind Pepper getting a shot at wearing it, the President, the Extremis guy--there were so many suit changes that the novelty of watching someone don the Iron Man was quickly spent after the first three times.This film was not directed by Jon Favreau, which might have had something to do with it. Just seems this movie was weighed down with not enough Iron Man and a storyline--which was solid in and of itself--that moved slowly. I realize Tony's aftermath and post-traumatic stress from The Avengers was the focus, but the same goal could've been accomplished had there been more Iron Man. I don't necessarily mean more action--as action-filled movies that are nothing but explosions start to finish get boring after a while--but perhaps him having a love/hate relationship with the suit because being in it nearly killed him at the end of The Avengers, or maybe take the robo-injections to summon the suit to a new level because he's trying to make himself super to be on par with guys like Captain America or Thor and have him deal with that?The extra scene at the end of the credits with Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) picked up on the bromance from The Avengers. A nice touch. Didn't move the Marvel cinematic universe forward in any way, but was a nice touch.If you're a Marvel movie completest, then by all means, check it out. Likewise, pick up the Blu-ray when it comes out to complete your set. For me, I think I'm going to have watch it again and perhaps I'll warm up to it a bit more. I felt let down when I watched the first Spider-Man in 2002, but got more into it with subsequent viewings. Iron Man 3 might be one of those movies.Just think they could've done a lot more with it.",4,It was all right . . .,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,4064,"['3.5', '5An', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'terrorist', 'known', 'Mandarin', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'rash', 'bombings', 'holding', 'world', 'grip', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'case', 'bombings', 'are', 'initiated', 'people', 'exposed', 'Extremis', 'program', 'something', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'ties', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'chose', 'not', 'out', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'knew', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'neck-deep', 'involved', 'what', 'going', 'now', 'have', 're-entered', 'life', 'are', 'making', 'things', 'complicated.While', 'trying', 'pinpoint', 'location', 'Mandarin', 'Iron', 'Man', 'aka', 'Tony', 'also', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'Chitauri', 'invasion', 'New', 'York', 'Avengers', 'Having', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'been', 'spending', 'time', 'constructing', 'various', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armors', 'help', 'cope', 'tension', 'relationship', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'dedicated', 'discovering', 'location', 'Mandarin', 'true', 'identity', 'Iron', 'Man', 'almost-sidekick', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'aka', 'War', 'Machine', 'aka', 'Col.', 'James', 'Rhodey', 'Rhodes', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'head', 'up', 'battalion', 'Extremis-infected', 'warriors', 'must', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'put', 'end', 'reign', 'terror', 'problem', 'Extremis', 'soldiers', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'victory', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely.Can', 'Iron', 'Man', 'prevail', 'army', 'as', 'strong', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'Sure', 'was', 'entertaining', 'storyline', 'was', 'fine', 'like', 'idea', 'making', 'direct', 'follow', 'up', 'Avengers', 'showing', 'how', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'world', 'never', 'mind', 'rest', 'world', 'had', 'been', 'affected', 'Chitauri', 'invasion', 'presence', 'other', 'Avengers.This', 'flick', 'was', 'loaded', 'solid', 'action', 'tough', 'bad', 'guys', 'cool', 'tech', 'guns', 'everything', 'else', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sold', 'presentation', 'might', 'be', 'harsh', 'flick', 'came', 'off', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', ""'m"", 'humor', 'even', 'most', 'serious', 'movies', 'seemed', 'jokes', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'forced', 'too', 'slapstick', 'make', 'take', 'flick', 'seriously', 'secret', 'superhero', 'movies', 'need', 'take', 'seriously', 'even', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'never', 'work', 'was', 'awful', 'lot', 'getting', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suits', 'film', 'Tony', 'Rhodey', 'never', 'mind', 'Pepper', 'getting', 'shot', 'wearing', 'President', 'Extremis', 'guy', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'suit', 'changes', 'novelty', 'watching', 'someone', 'don', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'quickly', 'spent', 'first', 'three', 'times.This', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'directed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Just', 'movie', 'was', 'weighed', 'down', 'not', 'enough', 'Iron', 'Man', 'storyline', 'was', 'solid', 'moved', 'slowly', 'realize', 'Tony', 'aftermath', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'Avengers', 'was', 'focus', 'same', 'goal', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'accomplished', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'Iron', 'Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'more', 'action', 'action-filled', 'movies', 'are', 'nothing', 'explosions', 'start', 'finish', 'get', 'boring', 'while', 'perhaps', 'having', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'suit', 'being', 'nearly', 'killed', 'end', 'Avengers', 'maybe', 'take', 'robo-injections', 'summon', 'suit', 'new', 'level', 'trying', 'make', 'super', 'be', 'par', 'guys', 'Captain', 'America', 'Thor', 'have', 'deal', 'extra', 'scene', 'end', 'credits', 'Dr.', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'picked', 'up', 'bromance', 'Avengers', 'nice', 'touch', 'Did', ""n't"", 'move', 'Marvel', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'forward', 'way', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.If', ""'re"", 'Marvel', 'movie', 'completest', 'then', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'Likewise', 'pick', 'up', 'Blu-ray', 'when', 'out', 'complete', 'set', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'warm', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'Spider-Man', '2002', 'got', 'more', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'movies.Just', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', 'more']",N/A

1559107,A2RPZ4DT6O7TBG,B008JFUO72,A.R. Schultz,"[3, 7]","I am openly conflicted about ""Iron Man 3."" On one hand, I am desperately trying to achieve objectivism in my review. I enjoyed it. It had a solid plot, it tied wonderfully to Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers,"" and a majority of its special effects are a technical marvel. I thought that the casting was superb, and personally the inclusion of Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce always make a filmbetter. All-in-all, the quality of the film sits snugly between the first and the second Iron Man films.However, on the other hand, I was incredibly dismayed to learn that, ""Iron Man 3"" would be Robert Downey, Jr's last standalone Iron Man film. In this context, ""Iron Man 3"" disappoints. It doesn't invoke the same sense of finality that I experienced when watching Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Rises."" ""Iron Man 3"" felt like a strong mid-entry to the series, but not the epic conclusion that should be expected from the franchise. However, it has been pointed out to me that Robert Downey Jr. will reprising his role for ""The Avengers 2,"" so maybe a more adequate `conclusion' to Iron Man will present itself within the confines of an Avengers film.Personal reservations aside, ""Iron Man 3"" is a topnotch Marvel film. It dives into the character by making Iron Man fallible, resulting in a two-hour character exploration--One of both his weaknesses and strengths. The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) and the founder of A.I.M. (Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce) are excellent villains and far superior than ""Iron Man 2's"" subpar Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). I also enjoyed Marvel Studios' deviation from the more-famous Iron Man comic book plots. It held true to the character (for the most part), but was removed enough to surprise comic book and films fans alike.I thought that the special effects were top notch, save for the fire effects used for the A.I.M. henchmen. The were starkly different from the other special effect heavy scenes, which made them appear dated and cheap. The end sequence was gorgeously rendered and nearly all of the scenes involving the Iron Man armor were meticulously dazzling; they were fluid and excellently scripted.My only complaint, besides the shoddy A.I.M. fire effects, is that Stark seems to break character towards the end of the movie. The script alters the very core of the character's personality, and it as-if the exploratory elements of the film override the source of Iron Man. I am curious to see if Joss Whedon carries this new `Tony Stark' into ""The Avengers 2,"" or decides to follow a more comic book-like rendition of the character that was presented to audiences in the first two Iron Man films. Whedon will be struggling between cohesion and character integrity, but with his directing and writing chops I am sure a happy median exists.Overall, ""Iron Man 3"" is a good film. It is better than the last and is on par with the other Marvel Universe films. Besides my own comic book snobbiness and reluctance to see Robert Downey, Jr. leave the mantle, ""Iron Man 3"" is more than worth the price of a couple of movie stubs.I give ""Iron Man 3"" four-stars-out-of-five.",4,Film review: Iron Man 3 (2013),1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3103,"['am', 'openly', 'conflicted', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'one', 'hand', 'am', 'desperately', 'trying', 'achieve', 'objectivism', 'review', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'solid', 'plot', 'tied', 'wonderfully', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Avengers', 'majority', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'technical', 'marvel', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'superb', 'personally', 'inclusion', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'always', 'make', 'filmbetter', 'All-in-all', 'quality', 'film', 'snugly', 'first', 'second', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films.However', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dismayed', 'learn', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'would', 'be', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'last', 'standalone', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'context', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'disappoints', ""n't"", 'invoke', 'same', 'sense', 'finality', 'experienced', 'when', 'watching', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Rises', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'felt', 'strong', 'mid-entry', 'series', 'not', 'epic', 'conclusion', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'franchise', 'However', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'will', 'reprising', 'role', 'Avengers', '2', 'so', 'maybe', 'more', 'adequate', 'conclusion', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'present', 'confines', 'Avengers', 'film.Personal', 'reservations', 'aside', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'topnotch', 'Marvel', 'film', 'character', 'making', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fallible', 'resulting', 'two-hour', 'character', 'exploration', 'One', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'Mandarin', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'founder', 'A.I.M', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'played', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'are', 'excellent', 'villains', 'far', 'superior', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'subpar', 'Whiplash', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'deviation', 'more-famous', 'Iron', 'Man', 'comic', 'book', 'plots', 'held', 'true', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'removed', 'enough', 'surprise', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'fans', 'alike.I', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'save', 'fire', 'effects', 'used', 'A.I.M', 'henchmen', 'were', 'starkly', 'different', 'other', 'special', 'effect', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'made', 'appear', 'dated', 'cheap', 'end', 'sequence', 'was', 'gorgeously', 'rendered', 'nearly', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armor', 'were', 'meticulously', 'dazzling', 'were', 'fluid', 'excellently', 'only', 'complaint', 'shoddy', 'A.I.M', 'fire', 'effects', 'Stark', 'break', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'script', 'very', 'core', 'character', 'personality', 'exploratory', 'elements', 'film', 'source', 'Iron', 'Man', 'am', 'curious', 'see', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'new', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Avengers', '2', 'follow', 'more', 'comic', 'book-like', 'rendition', 'character', 'was', 'presented', 'audiences', 'first', 'two', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'Whedon', 'will', 'be', 'struggling', 'cohesion', 'character', 'integrity', 'directing', 'writing', 'chops', 'am', 'sure', 'happy', 'median', 'exists.Overall', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'good', 'film', 'better', 'last', 'par', 'other', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'films', 'own', 'comic', 'book', 'snobbiness', 'reluctance', 'see', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'leave', 'mantle', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'more', 'price', 'couple', 'movie', 'stubs.I', 'give', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'four-stars-out-of-five']",N/A

I kept thinking 'When is this silliness gonna stop, and when will the real film really start.' Now I don't mind a film being somewhat deceptive so as to hide some things. I take offense to a film or filmmakers being deliberately deceptive with total and utter false advertising. Hey if they are scared to really write and show the Real Mandarin, that is their right. Just leave the character out of the film altogether. Don't give the middle finger to true and longtime fans who have been begging for a true Iron Man/Mandarin showdown since the first Iron Man film was announced. We don't have to go see it a second time. If you really want to pander to kid-friendly audiences that is also your right, but trust me when I tell you this. They don't outnumber real and longtime fans. Your playing a dangerous game. Casual fans eventually move on to something newer or more exciting.As an action film, Iron Man 3 isn't really that bad. This isn't the real Iron Man IMO. It's clear to me that the new director either knows nothing about Iron Man, or simply didn't care. This is a hatchet job if I've ever seen one. Bad enough I don't get to see the Real Mandarin, I also have to endure an annoying little kid throughout and Iron Man barely in one of his many armors.

1559115,A2W75RZ6WA9DCN,B008JFUO72,"Banon ""IronMan004""","[0, 0]","With all the different continuity connected franchises, we&#8217;ve seen Tony Stark quite a few times now. In fact, the appearances of the character are steadily inching towards the James Bond or Godzilla territory in terms of movie screen time. Iron Man 3 marks Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s fifth outing as the titular superhero, and a lot is riding on his shoulders once again. In the wake of Joss Whedon&#8217;s mega hit, The Avengers, this is the first of the Marvel properties to be released after their team-up. It&#8217;s also a dreaded third entry in a franchise, something that&#8217;s all too often proved to be inferior to the movies preceding it. Is Iron Man the hero to finally break a trend that dates all the way back to the Superman movies, or has the armored avenger overstayed his welcome?Picking up not too long after the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark is suffering from a sort of post traumatic stress. He&#8217;s battled gods and aliens, yet the world is expected to just go back to normal. Rather than confront these bizarre new changes, he&#8217;s chosen to hide away in his lab, building armor after armor. While he&#8217;s occupied with his distractions, a mysterious new threat has surfaced, calling himself the Mandarin. A super terrorist hell bent on attacking America, he makes theatrical threats and uses bombs that leave no trace whatsoever. It gets personal when Tony&#8217;s friend Happy Hogan (played by former director Jon Favreau) is caught up in such an explosion, forcing Iron Man to challenge the terrorist at his home. The rest of the movie centers on Tony&#8217;s battles against the Mandarin as he tries to find him and put a stop to his evil schemes.For a third installment in a franchise, a lot of credit should be given to new director and co-writer Shane Black for keeping the story interesting and fresh. The humor is sharp and plentiful, the action is great, and he takes it back to the basics of what made the first Iron Man so good, namely its protagonist. The bulk of the story centers around Tony, who&#8217;s alone, battered, and without his armors. He&#8217;s forced to solve an insurmountable new problem using only his wits and his uncanny resourcefulness. It&#8217;s a testament to the strengths of the character where he can still be found so engaging after so many appearances. It&#8217;s not a rehash of the previous movies, and there are a lot of twists and turns (some more dramatic than others).One of the major and welcome additions to the Iron Man series is the more memorable villains. Ben Kingsly as the Mandarin is a scene stealer and an unexpected take on the classic character. Guy Pearce is also memorable as the slimy Aldrich Killian, the head of A.I.M. who weaponized the Extremis enhancile. Speaking of which, it&#8217;s refreshing to see Iron Man up against super humans rather than armored knock-offs as in the previous films. It makes for different kinds of fight scenes that are interesting and new for these characters.The movie is Tony-centric, dropping almost all references to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers (apart from the occasional remark), wisely keeping the focus on Tony Stark himself. To emphasis this, he&#8217;s often shown out of the armor &#8211; or in only a few pieces of it &#8211; during action sequences. A lot of fun is had with this, in one instance pitting Tony against thugs with only the aid of one gauntlet and boot. The same can be said for Rhodey (Don Cheadle), who&#8217;s given a new paint job for his War Machine armor. They call it the Iron Patriot, but it hardly gets any use from its pilot. Instead, Rhodey gets to shine out of the armor, showing his abilities in actions scenes without it. It&#8217;s in these actions scenes where even Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is given more to do, upgrading from her usual sideline position to a more central role.Speaking of which, the action scenes are spectacular in this, highlighting just about everything that can be done with the armor. One of the most memorable is when Iron Man has to rescue a group of people falling from Air Force One. A lot of the scene was done using practical effects and real skydivers. It&#8217;s quick, intense, and a gripping sequence. The finale is also incredible, matching some of The Avengers in terms of scope and superhero action.Given all that takes place in the movie, and at a fast moving pace, certain aspects are weaker than the rest. Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen is probably the most underwhelming of the new characters, given a short arc that is resolved rather suddenly. She never feels like she played the role that the character was meant to, despite her apparent importance. This pace is also almost too fast for its own good, and the ending seems to gloss over various events that seem somewhat too important for a brief epilogue. These are relatively minor complaints, and are hardly noticeable while watching the movie.In the end, Iron Man 3 is a fantastic and fun action adventure, topping its predecessor and reaching for the heights set by The Avengers. In many ways it succeeds, serving as an excellent starting point for the next batch of Marvel movies. It doesn&#8217;t quite match the first film, but makes for a more than satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.",4,Fun and daring,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,5274,"['different', 'continuity',

Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic and is Iron Man in the same way that Christian Bale owned Batman.  My issue with this title however is how the digital copy redemption has been muddied to the point of being painfully annoying.  Previously, codes were typically available for iTunes or UltraViolet copy.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses which I won't go into in this review.  My complaint with the new trend in digital copies is that now end users are sent to a website to enter their redemption code found inside the jacket.  Once entered, three options are presented.  Amazon Digital Copy, iTunes, or Vudu (UltraViolet).Now, choice is good, heck choice is FANTASTIC.  My complaint however arises from the fact that in order to try to get information about the service you have to click the link first.  Once you click the link, the redemption key is BOUND to that service, whether or not you actually choose to redeem the code.  Case in point, I was interested in reading more about the Amazon Digital Redemption so I clicked it to read the terms.  Decided I would rather have it in my Vudu library and tried to go back... low and behold every click towards another service would return a message that the key was already bound to Amazon.I can understand trying to prevent fraudulent redemption, but how can you build a platform that binds a user to an option before the same user has a chance to read the terms for the provider. At the VERY least, a warning alerting users that once they click on a service the key will be bound would be helpful.  Not to mention linking the TOS for each provider on the FIRST Page so that you can view them before proceeding.I didn't deduct stars because of this issue, the movie itself is fantastic.  Just a word of warning, be careful when you are getting your digital copy!!",5,"Movie is FANTASTIC, Digital Redemption needs some work",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,1891,"['are', 'fan', 'franchise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'fantastic', 'Iron', 'Man', 'same', 'way', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'owned', 'Batman', 'issue', 'title', 'however', 'how', 'digital', 'copy', 'redemption', 'been', 'muddied', 'point', 'being', 'painfully', 'annoying', 'Previously', 'codes', 'were', 'typically', 'available', 'iTunes', 'UltraViolet', 'copy', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'review', 'complaint', 'new', 'trend', 'digital', 'copies', 'now', 'end', 'users', 'are', 'sent', 'website', 'enter', 'redemption', 'code', 'found', 'jacket', 'Once', 'entered', 'three', 'options', 'are', 'presented', 'Amazon', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'iTunes', 'Vudu', 'UltraViolet', '.Now', 'choice', 'good', 'heck', 'choice', 'FANTASTIC', 'complaint', 'however', 'fact', 'order', 'try', 'get', 'information', 'service', 'have', 'click', 'link', 'first', 'Once', 'click', 'link', 'redemption', 'key', 'BOUND', 'service', 'not', 'actually', 'choose', 'redeem', 'code', 'Case', 'point', 'was', 'interested', 'reading', 'more', 'Amazon', 'Digital', 'Redemption', 'clicked', 'read', 'terms', 'Decided', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'Vudu', 'library', 'tried', 'go', 'back', 'low', 'behold', 'click', 'service', 'would', 'return', 'message', 'key', 'was', 'already', 'bound', 'Amazon.I', 'can', 'understand', 'trying', 'prevent', 'fraudulent', 'redemption', 'how', 'can', 'build', 'platform', 'user', 'option', 'same', 'user', 'chance', 'read', 'terms', 'provider', 'VERY', 'least', 'warning', 'alerting', 'users', 'once', 'click', 'service', 'key', 'will', 'be', 'bound', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'Not', 'mention', 'linking', 'TOS', 'provider', 'FIRST', 'Page', 'so', 'can', 'view', 'proceeding.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'stars', 'issue', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'Just', 'word', 'warning', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'are', 'getting', 'digital', 'copy']",N/A

The reason for this is because the movie frequently references things that happened there and they will make more sense to the viewer.  It at least sticks with canon where the films are concerned.  While ""The Avengers"" isn't necessarily ""Iron Man 2.5"", there are things that happen to the Tony Stark character in that film that come into play in ""Iron Man 3"".(Personal side note, I purchased the single disc DVD, just because that was in my budget.  I would have preferred Blu Ray but I am one movie fan who doesn't really nitpick about formats.  I will watch a film on VHS if I want to see it bad enough.)That notwithstanding, it is still a great film on its own.  If you want to see Robert Downey Jr. a LOT, this film will NOT disappoint you in that department, nor will you feel cheated out of special effects galore, stunning and jaw dropping stunts, and great stuff all around.Ben Kingsley is hilarious.  There are many instances where you laugh out loud in this film.It is an all around entertaining way to spend two hours and eleven minutes.The story takes place around Christmas time, which surprised me that it was a summer film.  I guess Paramount figured it would be a better time to launch the third film in the franchise.  It isn't technically a ""holiday"" film anyway, but in any case, Paramount studios dominated movie theaters when this first came out and then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" started playing a week or so later and they ran concurrently there for a while..then ""Star Trek"" got released for home viewing first.One last thing.  Watch all the way through the credits.

The story looked like it was going to be a winner and I liked where it was going.  Then it fell on it's face.  First and foremost, I was rather upset over the lack of Iron Man being in his own film.  What you get is scene after scene of Tony Stark running around playing a high tech James Bond.  No no no.  I paid money to see Iron Man, not his alter ego.  The title of the movie is Iron Man 3, not Tony Stark 3. I don't know if it's the fact that the producers felt the need to show Downey Jr's face over and over, or if they didn't want to spend too much money on special effects.  I don't get it.  Without the suit, it's just another movie.The next thing I had a problem with is the old tired worn out cliche of the wise cracking 12 year old kid who bails out the hero.  OMG, nothing kills drama in a film better than this stupid plot device.  Why was this needed?  How many great hero films have you seen that has a annoying kid rescuing the hero?  Batman Begins?  X2?  Iron Man I?  Nope, can't think of one.  I can think of plenty of garbage films that do though.The third thing that was a disaster for the film was what they did with the Mandarin.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but I cannot figure out why they would do this with that character.  It was incredibly stupid and made no sense.  Was it for humor sake.

Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels.

I can forgive a certain number of plot holes big enough to drive a Audi though (more on that in a second) since the whole point of a action-packed big-budget early-summer block-buster is to entertain, but there were so many problems with this one that my brain kept reminding me that what I was watching was preposterous.  Here are a few that annoyed me the most.1) EVERYBODY seemed to drive an Audi.  Okay, I get Tony owning an R8 and I'll even buy Pepper driving the RS7, but honestly, even the BAD GUY drove an Audi?  Talk about product placement overkill.  Did the pizza delivery guy drive a TT as well?  I'll have to keep an eye out for it in a future extended ""director's cut"" of the movie.2) One size fits all Iron Man suits.  It doesn't seem to matter if you are tall, short, fat, or skinny - an Iron Man suit will fit you and function perfectly.  Tony Stark could make a 2nd fortune as a tailor.3) Something like 500 Iron Man suits (including the Lego suit) that don't actually need a person inside of them to operate as autonomous entities.  'nuff said.4) That kid. One question - why?5) The self-destruct ""button"" in every Iron Man suit.  Even Doctor Doofenshmirtz knows better that to install one of them (and yet he does anyway - so perplexing, but I degrees).6) Pretty much everything that happened in the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Every single sub-plot and open issue is wrapped-up in a convenient (and absolutely ridiculous) montage.  Seriously, the only way it could have been made any more clear that this might be the last movie in the series would have been if Robert Downey Jr. looked right at the camera and said ""THE END!  DO YOU GET IT PEOPLE?  EVERY SUB-PLOT AND LOOSE END HAS BEEN WRAPPED-UP!  THE ONE THING THAT MADE ME TRULY UNIQUE IS GONE!  IT'S OVER!

I can only think of a couple (Toy Story 3 and Return of the King - though even LOTR was really one big movie broken into three installments). Iron Man 3 is better than the first two. The story is tighter, the action sequences are extraordinary, but, most of all, Tony Stark is finally likable. Not just enjoyable to watch, but actually likable. We can thank The Avengers for that. Building on the Iron Man plotline and the new anxieties brought about by the events in The Avengers, Stark now has to figure out how to live in a world where there are gods and aliens, while he's just &#34;a man in a can.&#34; His insecurities humanize him, while his ego remains. In this movie, the right balance for this character has finally been achieved. It's fantastic.One of the problems inherent to Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk is that the main actor essentially disappears for the action sequences, making it less emotionally satisfying. Wisely, Iron Man 3 keeps Tony Stark unmasked for most of those scenes, letting the suits buzz around him, catching and releasing him as needed. It works very well.This is a key moment in Marvel movie history. They've created a great foundation with (mostly) good or great movies. The Avengers film was better than I ever expected, and now they have a chance to go deeper into the characters while taking the action to new heights.

1559150,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008JFUO72,Brian Driver,"[476, 559]","Let me start by saying that I can understand why there are a lot of split opinions about IRON MAN 3.  It's a film full of misdirection and deceptions, and I was a little distressed by a couple of them - which would give away too much to detail here.  Suffice it to say that there were a couple of moments I felt somewhat cheated; and though I'll be vague about it I can say it involved Mandarin. Still, read on; while I gave the movie four stars, I believe down the road I might very well revise this to a five.  I'll explain...First of all, rest assured there is A LOT of action. And there are a lot of the Iron Suits, too...it's just that Tony Stark isn't often the one IN the suit.  I found myself often frustrated by that fact: Iron Man interruptus, if you will. Either the suits were off on their own, or they were on other people, or they weren't working properly...something that seemed to occur almost constantly.I saw it in Imax 3D, and it was well worth the extra $$ to do so (given the fact that $17 is a RIDICULOUS price for a movie ticket in the first place). The movie was lush, packed with detail, and continuously drew me ""inside"" it.  The scenes of (don't panic about spoilers - these are in ALL the promos) Stark's house exploding and falling into the sea are meticulously crafted and extremely inclusive...I really felt the dimensional layers as the house was blown apart: I could feel the force of the detonation, and house collapsing, and the impact of the sea as the house AND Iron Man tumbled into it. Similarly, the moments where his suit fly through the air and ""find"" him, or the death-defying scenes aboard (and outside) Air Force One, and so many others throughout the film really do feel like you're there.When it comes to the action you'd expect from a movie such as this, IRON MAN 3 is a rollicking, smash-mouth treat. Director Shane Black - whose only previous directorial role was onKiss Kiss Bang Bang(which ironically served as Robert Downey, Jr.'s comeback film) - does a more-than-capable job, and the characters and events are big and loud. You'll feel like you are on a roller-coaster; while there are of course moments of crazy adrenaline rushes, there are also emotional ups and down.  But Tony Stark is just as glib as always, causing almost as much damage with his mouth as he does as with his armor.  I laughed a lot during the movie ... for those who care, Tony's mechanical manservant JARVIS (the voice of Paul Bettany) gets a good deal of air play here, and he's just as lovably bumbling as always.Yet - and remember my dichotomy about this - the movie really focuses on Tony Stark OUTSIDE the suit. I wish the promos had clued me into this: our man Tony is experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder because of what happened inThe Avengers. Had I been informed of that I wouldn't have felt slighted, and I think it would have better prepared me for this movie. I found myself constantly disappointed, even cheated, by the absence of Tony WITHIN the suit. I realize now that was the only way I felt Iron man was indeed Iron Man. Yet I will declare that now, looking back, I feel good about the movie, and I'm glad to have seen Tony as a more ""real"" person, as a more human man, a man undergoing a metamorphosis.There are other things about this movie that surprised me - and I'm sure will surprise you - that I will NOT tell you. Just realize that while this is a very action-packed movie, it is also a personal one. It's this kind of writing that has typified the action movies of today, making them stand out above their ""super-hero"" predecessors. Like theThe Dark Knightmovies of Chris Nolan, these new, and better, powerhouse films are focusing on their heroes' moments of personal growth, warts and all.

Then this movie happens. What went wrong? First, Stark has 42 suits of armor to choose from, and he consistently wears the only one that can't fly and has technical difficulties. Second, they choose the Mandarin for his villain (a great choice) and then choose to completely destroy the whole character with this treatment of him. Third, the end of the film drags on forever as Stark just keeps getting beat down and goes up against the villain that just...won't...die! Every time he goes down, there he is again. It gets so horribly monotonous.And here's a thought: why not let Stark actually WEAR ARMOR? This is the third film, shouldn't he be in the suit for at least half of it? And the final wrap up with Stark was absolutely abysmal, as they deviate DRASTICALLY from the comics. I see no way they could do another film for Stark with it left this way.This is a dangerous misstep for Marvel, as this is the beginning of ""Phase 2"" and if their other upcoming films don't do better (and to be fair, Iron Man 3 didn't set the bar very high at all) then this could begin the decline and eventual death of Marvel's movie franchise.So ultimately, how bad is this film?

I've watched them all many times and will do so again: I liked them all that much.That being said; this movie was quite a let down.The high tech that we all loved about the suit in the previous movies has gotten out of hand. They actually have the different parts of the suit having their own rockets and targeting system that can find Tony anywhere. Little parts, like the face plate alone, has rockets and tracking that can fly across the continent and find Tony anywhere. Even to me this was purely unbelievable.Tony is suffering from PTSD. The whole movie we see several iron man suits but Tony isn't in them. They've become drones that are controlled by Jarvis. All the action we see from Tony is out of the suit.I suppose the effort was to make us see and like Tony as just one of us normals. There is a tiny bit of success there when he interacts with the kid, but it falls short.We don't go see Iron Man movies for warm and cozy normalcy.

1559168,A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B008JFUO72,B. Wright,"[0, 2]","Note: Plot Spoilers.There were so many plot misses in this film, I'm not even sure where to begin. Let's start with Iron Patriot. Rhodey was never the Iron Patriot. Instead, the real origin is that Norman Osborne takes control of the War Machine suit from the government and paints it to be the Iron Patriot (at first to be a villain, then later redeems himself as a good guy). Ignoring the film's poorly rewritten origin, the Iron Patriot was absolutely unnecessary to the plot. It added nothing. If Rhodey had been wearing his War Machine suit, the plot would have been identical. It was simply added as a merchandising tactic. How many 'War Machine' toys can you sell? Parents probably aren't even happy by this name. However, the 'Iron Patriot' is a much more uplifting name from a merchandising perspective. Of course, they even point this naming piece out using dialog within the film. I digress.This film completely lost its way nearly throughout. Abduction of the president of the US? Seriously? The vice president is compromised because of his daughter's (plot convenient) missing limb? How much suspension of disbelief are we expected to put forth here? I rolled my eyes as soon as I saw the vice president's role.Unfortunately, it seemed this movie's sole goal was to show us Tony Stark out the Iron Man suit more than in it. If I go to an Iron Man film, I expect to see Iron Man doing Iron Manly things actually IN the Iron Man suit. Not Tony Stark galavanting about in t-shirts and jeans. I also don't expect to see robotic remote control Iron Men all doing random things. Again, it's about Iron Man, not some robotic IronFest.While the actors put forth their level best to reprise their roles, and did so quite well, the plot was just so far off the mark not even the best acting could reel in this story disaster. Yes, it even concluded with fairly cliche  and convenient happy ending, but what it took to get there wasn't really worth the time and effort. And worse, it shows Tony having his shrapnel finally removed. If it were that easy to have had it removed, why didn't that happen at the end of the first film? If it were that easy, why was the electromagnet even necessary?Overall, the Iron Man series should have ended with Iron Man 2.

And I surely liked ""Iron Man""'; even ""Iron Man 2"" was pretty good.  But this time I will be unfortunately the one who needs to discuss the Emperor's New Clothes, at least Tony Stark's.  They seem to come on, and more importantly, off, one too many times.From the opening scene, this film decides that it wants to be cute, and it decides that it wants to be slapstick.  While that might have worked very well when Robert Downey Jr. played ""Chaplin"" -- a film in which I believe he should have won an Academy Award, where slapstick was required due to the subject matter -- slapstick just doesn't work here.  The strong points of the previous films:  a lot of action, and a lot of situations where comedic elements fit in naturally with the dialog of the screenplay.  Here, that comedy seems forced; my eyes were rolling in many places where the jokes just didn't work.  After all, comedy is supposed to be funny, right?And then, of course, it seems that we are required to sit through the superhero-meets-young-boy-and-young-boy-bails-out-superhero junk.  Ouch.

Full of action, humor, and packed with more emotion than it's predecessors.But, in regards to the comic book fans that see this movie: I can see where they would be extremely let down even though I myself wasn't disappointed by the movie at all. The Mandarin and the rings are really main plots in the Iron Man universe and for them to downplay him as much as they did in this film was kind of a slap in the face to the die-hard comic fans. When Killian was introduced as the Mandarin himself I found that to be slightly odd though. Anyway, that's probably the only flaw I saw in the movie.The action scenes with the suits were absolutely amazing. Seeing all of the different marks fighting against the Extremis soldiers made the fangirl in me scream. The effects and animation were impeccable, as they always are when it comes to the Iron Man movies. We even get to see a very, VERY bada-- side to Gwyneth Paltrow using her Extremis powers and even the Iron Man tech!My favorite part of the film was undoubtedly the humor. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual smarta-- Tony Stark attitude that we've come to love, and there are far too many hilarious one-liners and scenes in this movie for me to count. When I heard EIFFEL 65's ""Blue Da Ba Dee"" begin to play when the MARVEL logo came across the screen I cracked up, my friend whispering to me ""You can already tell this is going to be good.""As for the emotional aspect I thought the relationship between Tony and Pepper grew tenfold in this film, as well as the friendships between Tony, JARVIS, and Happy. There's an extremely gut-wrenching scene where Pepper falls 200 feet down into an explosion and you can just see the complete pain on Tony's face when he believes she's died. Unfortunately we do see Tony remove his arc reactor and the shrapnel in his heart at the end of this film, entailing that there probably won't be another huge appearance of Iron Man in the MARVEL movies to come. I do think though that the character evolves immensely in this film and we see Tony Stark grow up a little after all that's happened.Overall I'd give this movie a 5 out of 5. It was an amazing thrill to see in theaters and can't wait to watch it at home as well! You'll find yourself laughing throughout, I guarantee it. One last note though: There was just a bit of language and graphic, disturbing content that I think parents may not enjoy their younger children to hear/see. There's a good amount of terrorist-themed scenes and one where a man gets shot in the head by the fake Mandarin, so parents, make sure that you are aware of this before taking your 6 year old Iron Man fanatic to see it in theaters.Oh, and as all you MARVEL fans know already, STICK AROUND UNTIL AFTER THE CREDITS!!!

It was not necessarily a bad movie so much as it was not the movie I, and I assume many others, wanted it to be.This movie focuses largely on the character development of Tony Stark and his personal struggle to deal with events and the enormous responsibilities that come with his power.  That is all fine and good, but what I wanted to see in an Iron Man movie is (1) Iron Man and (2) Tony Stark being his trademark snarky jerk self.  Instead the vast majority of the movie consists of Tony Stark moping around and having deep, meaningful realizations about his life.  Again, I'm not saying that kind of movie is bad, but it's not what I was wanting to see in a comic book superhero movie.  Seriously, who wants to watch a movie about Tony Stark struggling to deal with anxiety attacks?In short, this movie suffers from the same flaw as The Dark Knight Rises, namely that the costumed superhero has ridiculously little screentime.  The Dark Knight Rises might just as well have been called Bruce Wayne: The Movie, and Iron Man III might just as well been called The Emotional Struggles of Tony Stark.

Men have women in their lives, but keep them for the lovin and keep them away from the action!If you wanted to see this film expecting to see Iron Man, then you might want to watch another movie!  The least that you see in this film is Iron Man.  How can you have a film called ""Iron Man 3"" and hardly show Iron Man?  It was mostly about Tony Stark and his going without the armor.  I guess the producers of this film thought that recovering dope fiend, Robert Downey Jr. was the main attraction to Iron Man.  Maybe they placed too many bets on that, but I don't want to watch a super hero movie to NOT see the super hero, I want to see Iron Man.  You really don't see Iron Man and the little that you do see is half A.  Most of the armors are half done and they seem to get destroyed easily.  Also, the calling on armor pieces for anywhere is not cool.  Yeah, it may be easier to get the armor on instead of the briefcase, but it is silly an unrealistic.  The briefcase was Tony Stark and Iron Man!  It is also what made the character unique in Marvel Comics.  I guess they messed this up.I was not always crazy about the Mandarin, but if they were going to show him, I was expecting the classical Mandarin which this film fools you into believing that you would get.  Instead, you get Mandarin that has no rings and is one that I don't recognize.  I stopped reading comic books around 1988 shortly after Amazing Spider Man #300, so who knows what happened after that?  This film was dull and Hollywood needs to understand, that with super hero films, people don't have time to wait on lame enemies, we want to see as much of the hero as possible and we want to see the villains - interesting villains!  Do that and you can have winners.  More of Iron Man 3 and no one will want to see super hero films anymore.  Given that there are few options for films these days, they need to get these right.  I vote for Dr. Doom as the villain in the next one, along with a minor villain at the start.",2,Iron Man 3: Everything BUT Iron Man!,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,2701,"['can', 'usually', 'tell', 'trailers', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'empty', 'action', 'packed', 'exciting', 'lacking', 'something', 'When', 'saw', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'trailers', 'got', 'feeling', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'was', 'not', 'excited', 'Mandarin', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'excited', 'non-Asian', 'one', 'passed', 'film', 'theaters', 'saw', 'other', 'two', 'theaters.They', 'need', 'give', 'film', 'redirection', 'franchise', 'will', 'come', 'abrupt', 'end', 'reboot', 'needed', 'just', 'get', 'back', 'story', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'More', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'title', 'right', 'LESS', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'even', 'less', 'Pepper', '3', 'Spider-man', 'films', 'suffered', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Women', 'slow', 'down', 'ruin', 'action', 'films', 'Men', 'have', 'women', 'lives', 'keep', 'lovin', 'keep', 'away', 'action', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'see', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'How', 'can', 'have', 'film', 'called', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'hardly', 'show', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'mostly', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'going', 'armor', 'guess', 'producers', 'film', 'thought', 'recovering', 'dope', 'fiend', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'main', 'attraction', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Maybe', 'placed', 'too', 'many', 'bets', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'NOT', 'see', 'super', 'hero', 'want', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', 'little', 'do', 'see', 'Most', 'armors', 'are', 'half', 'done', 'seem', 'get', 'destroyed', 'easily', 'Also', 'calling', 'armor', 'pieces', 'anywhere', 'not', 'cool', 'Yeah', 'may', 'be', 'easier', 'get', 'armor', 'instead', 'briefcase', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'briefcase', 'was', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'also', 'what', 'made', 'character', 'unique', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'guess', 'messed', 'up.I', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'crazy', 'Mandarin', 'were', 'going', 'show', 'was', 'expecting', 'classical', 'Mandarin', 'film', 'believing', 'would', 'get', 'Instead', 'get', 'Mandarin', 'rings', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'stopped', 'reading', 'comic', 'books', '1988', 'shortly', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', '300', 'so', 'who', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'was', 'dull', 'Hollywood', 'needs', 'understand', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'wait', 'lame', 'enemies', 'want', 'see', 'much', 'hero', 'possible', 'want', 'see', 'villains', 'interesting', 'villains', 'Do', 'can', 'have', 'winners', 'More', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'anymore', 'Given', 'are', 'few', 'options', 'films', 'days', 'need', 'get', 'right', 'vote', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'villain', 'next', 'one', 'minor', 'villain', 'start']",N/A

1559193,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUO72,Chris Kennison,"[4, 14]","I'm beginning to think that these superhero movies are toying with their fans and viewers, doing just enough to keep people wanting more with each movie they release. You come expecting to see Batman or Iron Man and mostly you get a lot of scenes of Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark either unable to be their alter egos because their stuck in a hole, hurt, emotionally scarred, trying to fix their suit, or maybe they haven't become their alter-egos yet and we need half the movie to get there. Or maybe the script, in the case of Iron Man 2, is just bad and you get the entire core of the movie without Iron Man; with the exception of a brief scene where Tony Stark is drunk and shooting fruit at a party. Could these billion-dollar franchises be saving money on special effects, or was my initial assessment correct?Iron Man 3 is no exception. Without giving too much away, the middle of the movie is spent with Tony Stark suit less because it needs to be fixed. So, ultimately we get the same thing we got in Iron Man 2; a setup, a big scene in the beginning, a talky middle and a slam-bam finish. The good news is, the middle and mostly Iron Man free part is not without action, it is just Tony Stark doing the action, with some Iron-Manish gadgets. This is why I believe this trend of superhero movies with sparse superhero moments is not unintentional. To me though, ""Iron Man 3"" is without question the best of the trilogy; although that isn't saying much.Fortunately for ""Iron Man 3"", you can't cut out the core of the movie and still get the gist of it. While it does do the same thing as ""Iron Man 2"", the story is intricate, complex and thought provoking. While Stark is out of sorts and without a suit, he becomes a bit of a Sherlock Holmes, figuring out the mystery of who the terrorist `The Mandrin' is and where he will strike next. We miss Iron Man through those scenes, but we are still invested in the film and sure enough when the suit finally reaches its full potential, we get what we paid for in a smash up finale that was right up there with ""The Avengers"".Although, while he spent the entire movie fixing one suit, he manages to call up dozens of suits to help out with this big finale. Which didn't make sense, and once again proves my point about MONEY being the dictator for these scripts instead of LOGIC.It's not like these studios don't have money or know that the current movie they're working on is gonna make its money. This is a billion dollar franchise people. BILLION. With a B. So why do we keep getting the same screenplays where our hero is disabled or unable or emotionally scarred for some unknown reason for most of the movie? I just don't want these studios and all the billions their making off of us, to think they can nickel-and-dime us like everybody else in the world is these days. I'm onto their game. I'm calling them on it. Nonetheless, it is Iron Man, and for now, it's the only Iron Man we got, so I'll probably still buy their nickle-and-diming blu-ray with the money-saving screenplay.

In this review I won't spoil anything from the movie I'm just going to give you some of my feelings about it. First off I don't feel that the characters that they introduce in this movie were all needed. It just kind of sad because Iron Man 1 was such a great movie and Iron Man 2 was kind of a bummer I was hoping Iron Man 3 would redeem the franchise in a big way. The sad thing is there was a lot of potential for this movie. Some of the major issues I have also since this continues right after the of vents of the Avengers where a SHEILD??? they are never mentioned or alluded to at all. And it really kind of takes you out of the universe that Marvel comics universe are trying to build.Also I disagree with with having the child to help the billionaire Tony Stark which obviously was only there to pander to young audiences. And also this director's obsession with having Christmas and all of his movies it gets really boggles the mind why they had to go and ruin this action movie with those kind of subplots. I mean it's Iron Man 3 we don't want to be a Christmas movie.It really is a letdown because like I said earlier iron man three could've been so much more. And the twists you see at the end of the movie aren't that good.I saw it in 3-D and I love movies in 3-D I think the depth it adds really enhances the story in my opinion. But I think a little bit of Iron Man 3's 3-D was sort of just filler 3-D just added to sell tickets. But the effects weren't always that bad.All in all I say this was just an okay comic book superhero movie.

Iron Man was always a favorite and I thought IM 1 & 2 were excellent.  Robert Downey owns the Tony Stark role and really makes these movies worth seeing. Like other reviewers I dislike when these contemporary films feel the need to stray from the source material.  I accepted in IM #1 that Tony revealed his identity as Iron Man contrary to the comics, but in IM #3 they've gone too far.  The Mandarin was a formidable foe now reduced to a joke.  The ending where Tony has surgery to remove the shrapnel threatening his damaged heart and with it the need for the arc reactor (which he tosses into the sea at the end) is bewildering.  Why didn't they operate before if they could?  Speaking of the arc reactor, it was the power for the suits, so how is Iron Patriot powered (Rhodes doesn't have a reactor in his chest) or all those remotely operated suits?  Not sure where they're going with this but I'm worried they'll ruin the franchise (James Bond anyone?).  Another disappointment for me was the lack of Iron Man in this film, Tony is outside the suit for much of this story.  Why these recent superhero adventures choose to have the key character moviegoers pay to see not appear on the screen is beyond me.  The last Batman movie probably the worst example of this trend; when I go to see a movie about Batman, sort of expect to see Batman on screen, not Bruce Wayne nursing a herniated disc in a dungeon for half the movie.

No doubt there are changes and even errors compared to the Iron Man rulebook.  On the other hand, if you can take a step back and realize this is a movie that pokes fun at both itself and current events, it's a lot of fun.  A guess would be that the people involved thought a sequel to the sequel wasn't really necessary but if you're going to do it again, why not have some fun with it?After seeing Man of Steel, which was long, somber, predictable, expensive and really kind of dull, I wasn't expecting a lot from Iron Man.  But I think a comparison is appropriate.  Both these movies cost millions and have state of the art effects.  Iron Man has some wonderful, funny exchanges between Tony Stark and the little kid (nothing like that in Superman) and of course the hilarious Mandarin who deserves a movie of his own.  Whereas Russell Crowe is wasted on corny Krypto-dialog and Diane Lane is hardly in Superman, in Iron Man, Ben Kingsley creates a new, totally incongruous character that people will remember even if they didn't like the movie.Now, what typically happens is, you have to choose between interesting characters and plot or tons and tons and tons of action.

I realize the two are sort of a split persona, but I at least expected a 50/50 split of screen time between the two.  Instead, I sat through a dry movie with a recycled storyline that's been done to death in not just superhero movies, but movies in general.  Within the first few minutes of the opening scene, I immediately knew this was going to be a by-the-book movie.  It setup all the trademarks of rehashed plots we've all seen throughout the years.  There was practically no action and what felt like 30 seconds of Tony being in the Iron Man armor.  The ending with the various versions of armor just seemed like a ploy to sell action figures.  The end credits confirmed my opinion of the film.  There was so little action and so little screen time of Iron Man, that the majority of the action shots shown during the end credits were from the previous films.  I really like the first film for it's mix of comicbook-like action that blended well with a good origin story.  The second had a flew flaws, but was interesting.  The third just seems like a cash-grab.  Hopefully the other Marvel sequels coming out (Thor, Capt.

1559209,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008JFUO72,C. Sawin,"[6, 19]","It has been eight long years since Shane Black unleashed his hilarious little crime comedy known as ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" into theaters. Black was a surprising replacement for Jon Favreau as director of ""Iron Man 3."" Not because Black wasn't up to the task, but a big blockbuster film like ""Iron Man 3"" was just a fascinating way to follow up Black's directorial debut. There's a lot for ""Iron Man 3"" to cover; how the events in The Avengers have affected Tony Stark (the returning Robert Downey Jr), the new terrorist villain The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley), Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) dropping the War Machine for Iron Patriot, and witnessing what Tony's new Mark XLII armor can really do. Then there's the undying question on whether or not a third film in a franchise is any good or not. Will it be better than the last sequel? Can it live up to the first film? Shane Black throws even more sharp wit, laugh out loud humor, ingenious ideas, and even a few unexpected twists and turns into an already well established and beloved superhero franchise.The events of Los Angeles have been affecting Tony Stark more than he lets on. He's been up for three days straight and spends night and day expanding his armory. In 1999, Tony snubbed a nerdy and somewhat handicapped scientist named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who wants Tony's assistance and support for Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). In the present day, Aldrich is a brand new man and AIM has developed the Extremis program, which allows users to heal from extreme injuries. But if the host rejects Extremis, their body gets massively hot and they detonate like an unstable explosive. At the same time, a terrorist mastermind known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has taken over the airwaves and claims that he will kill the President of the United States. As Tony struggles with unpredictable anxiety attacks and keeping Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) safe, he realizes he can no longer stand by and do nothing when security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is caught in the blast of a terrorist attack.If you're a fan of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" then the opening narration will immediately bring you back to that film. Shane Black has also written the ""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""The Monster Squad,"" and ""Last Action Hero."" That buddy cop dynamic really has a chance to shine in ""Iron Man 3"" during the last half hour or so. So not only is it full of action, but the humor and amusing conversation is amplified.The film doesn't shy away from using the advanced technology you've come to expect from these films. Tony rebuilds Happy's crime scene with the technology at Stark Industries, but Aldrich utilizes three small ball bearings that project things like the inside of his brain which is seemingly accessible anywhere and anytime. There are several references to ""The Avengers"" and even one to ""Thor."" Stick around for the after-credits scene for another little gem.The really big action sequences seem to be even bigger this time around. Tony's mansion being demolished is extraordinary, especially when the film switches to a first person perspective and you see something like Tony Stark in the Mark XLII suit being trapped underwater by falling debris. It's intense. The Air Force One sequence is also just incredible. How Tony saves that many people is pretty creative. There was news floating around that Joss Whedon was so impressed with the ending to ""Iron Man 3"" that he has no idea how to top it for ""The Avengers 2."" The finale features some of the most visually impressive and structurally satisfying action sequences to be featured in any superhero film to date.It would feel criminal not to mention Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce in this review. Kingsley is fantastic. The Mandarin role is a complex one, but Kingsley puts this fantastic spin on the character that comic book fans will either find extremely gratifying or completely blasphemous. Pearce isn't quite as despicable or scene demanding as he was in ""Lawless,"" but he proves once again that he knows how to portray a memorable antagonist.""Iron Man 3"" is nearly as good if not completely on par with the original ""Iron Man."" It's innovative, hilarious, and crafted in the same vein of the first film. The closing act is so ridiculously good and gratifying that it'll give you goosebumps. Robert Downey Jr electrifies in the Tony Stark role yet again. Now that Shane Black has proven that he's more than capable of delivering yet another funny, witty, and extremely enjoyable film, can somebody please get this guy to direct more than one film every eight years?",5,An overwhelming dose of sharp wit and sensational action,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4601,"['been', 'eight', 'long', 'years', 'Shane', 'Black', 'unleashed', 'hilarious', 'little',

1559212,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B008JFUO72,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 7]","Following on the heels of one of the greatest superhero films (The Avengers) ever, Iron Man 3 had the daunting task of being the first film to initiate Phase 2 of the next set of Marvel films.  Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3).  Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance.  By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects.  At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications.  Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related?  The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy.  A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role.  Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin.  Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy.  He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience.  It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot.  At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing.There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists.  The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly.  What's a superhero to do?  The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs.  Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections.  Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1.

1559222,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B008JFUO72,DanD,"[2, 4]","Remember how refreshing the first IRON MAN was?  It was fun, witty, fast-paced, with solid acting and an undeniably charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr.  Then we got all hopped up for IRON MAN 2, and we were...underwhelmed.  In fact, to this day, only two things about the sequel stick with me: the absence of Terrence Howard, and that amazing scene between Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke in the prison cell, where you leave two great actors alone in a room together and see what happens.  Everything else is a mediocre, ""oh what might have been"" blur.IRON MAN 3 walks the line between those two films, not as great as the first, not as utterly forgettable as the second.  It's plot is pretty great on the surface: a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is targeting America, using technology so advanced that no one can put their hands on it.  Enter Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, aka ""don't mess with my friends.""  Well, the Mandarin does just that, and suddenly Tony finds himself in a (somewhat) morally complex spiral through terrorism, bureaucracy, and good old fashioned revenge.The film, from director Shane Black (who directed Downey in the grossly underrated KISS KISS BANG BANG), takes a few interesting twists and turns.  This will probably have fanboys wringing their fists (and pounding their keyboards) in frustration.  In part, they're right to do so; the film, like the second, wastes a lot of its potential with a third-act twist that (let's face it) is rather predictable.  BUT, unlike the second film, it at least tries to do something else.  I won't say what, but it's nice to see a blockbuster shy away from conventional expectations.  That being said...it IS still a letdown, albeit one boasted by some great performances (Kingsley in particular, but Guy Pearce has a few good moments as well, and James Badge Dale has some nice scenes).  Rebecca Hall gets little to do, but she does it well; same with returning stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau.Ultimately, how you feel about IRON MAN 3 will come down to your expectations going into it.  If you keep your expectations realistic (remember: IRON MAN 2), then you may be pleasantly surprised...unless you're fiercely loyal to the source material, in which case you're gonna be disappointed.  IRON MAN 3 isn't the film it could have been, but that's actually a two-way street: it could have been better, but could have been much worse.  Take that for what you will, but at least it's another chance for Robert Downey Jr. to quip some one-liners and give the cameras a mischievous glare.",3,"3.5 stars: some great stuff, some ho-hum stuff.",1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,2593,"['Remember', 'how', 'refreshing', 'first', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'was', 'was', 'fun', 'witty', 'fast-paced', 'solid', 'acting', 'undeniably', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Then', 'got', 'hopped', 'up', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'were', 'underwhelmed', 'fact', 'day', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'sequel', 'stick', 'absence', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'amazing', 'scene', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'prison', 'cell', 'where', 'leave', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'alone', 'room', 'together', 'see', 'what', 'Everything', 'else', 'mediocre', 'oh', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'blur.IRON', 'MAN', '3', 'walks', 'line', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'not', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'second', 'plot', 'pretty', 'great', 'surface', 'terrorist', 'known', 'Mandarin', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'targeting', 'America', 'using', 'technology', 'so', 'advanced', 'one', 'can', 'put', 'hands', 'Enter', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'aka', 'Iron', 'Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'friends', 'Well', 'Mandarin', 'just', 'suddenly', 'Tony', 'somewhat', 'morally', 'complex', 'spiral', 'terrorism', 'bureaucracy', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'revenge.The', 'film', 'director', 'Shane', 'Black', 'who', 'directed', 'Downey', 'grossly', 'underrated', 'KISS', 'KISS', 'BANG', 'BANG', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'fanboys', 'wringing', 'fists', 'pounding', 'keyboards', 'frustration', 'part', ""'re"", 'right', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'second', 'lot', 'potential', 'third-act', 'twist', 'let', 'face', 'rather', 'predictable', 'BUT', 'second', 'film', 'least', 'tries', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'nice', 'see', 'blockbuster', 'shy', 'away', 'conventional', 'expectations', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'letdown', 'one', 'boasted', 'great', 'performances', 'Kingsley', 'particular', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'well', 'James', 'Badge', 'Dale', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'little', 'do', 'well', 'same', 'returning', 'stars', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Jon', 'Favreau.Ultimately', 'how', 'feel', 'IRON', 'MAN', '3', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'expectations', 'going', 'keep', 'expectations', 'realistic', 'remember', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', ""'re"", 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'source', 'material', 'case', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'disappointed', 'IRON', 'MAN', '3', ""n't"", 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'two-way', 'street', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'Take', 'what', 'will', 'least', 'chance', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'quip', 'one-liners', 'give', 'cameras', 'mischievous', 'glare']",N/A

1559229,A3QU74B9N0830G,B008JFUO72,Dan Thompson,"[3, 11]","Prior to being released, Iron Man 3 had a lot to live up to. Not only was it the third installment in the wildly successful Iron Man series, it was also the first movie in the Marvel universe to be released after the record-shattering and ultimate team-up flick, The Avengers. With the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. once again in the title role, and with the addition of veteran screenwriter Shane Black at the helm, Iron Man 3 officially kicks off the second phase of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, and brings us Tony Stark in his most vulnerable state yet.Iron Man 3 is a completely different animal than the previous two films in the series. Rather than overusing the spectacle of the Iron Man armors like the previous film, Iron Man 3 tells us the story of the man beneath the armor. In fact, this is very much a story about Tony and his beliefs, and shows the playboy philanthropist donning the armor only a handful of times throughout the movie. There are elements in the film not typically found in superhero flicks, along with underlying themes that really add to the story including the war or terror, propagandization, and revenge. It gives us Tony Stark at the most vulnerable point in his time as Iron Man, and tells a great story of a man trying to reconcile his past.This movie is very much a Shane Black film that's filled with witty dialogue and choppy quips, and has a definite ""buddy cop"" feel to it. Black, the writer behind Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, is a master of smart and pop culture injected lines, of which there is no actor better suited to deliver than RDJ. The direction Black has taken the character tells a darker tale than has been told before, but the outcome is one that works very well.As it turns out, the movie I saw ended up being very different from the one I expected to see...in a good way. The story contains some twists that I did not see coming, and that the marketing team did a good job of hiding in the trailers. There's some spectacular action sequences, particularly the aerial rescue and the final thirty minutes, and a lot more humor than the trailers will have you believe. There's also some memorable performances from the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow, who is given a more action-oriented role, Don Cheadle, who has some fun back-and-forth exchanges with RDJ, Ben Kingsley as the memorable Mandarin (and who steals the show by the way), and Guy Pearce as the mysterious and manipulative Aldrich Killian. I was also pleasantly surprised by the casting of youngster Ty Simpkins, who, somehow, manages to out-banter Tony Stark.It may not be as high-flying or action-packed as the previous films, but it's a very worthy successor to The Avengers, and a terrific addition to the Marvel universe.",5,Great Addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - 4.5 Stars,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2768,"['Prior', 'being', 'released', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'third', 'installment', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Iron', 'Man', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'be', 'released', 'record-shattering', 'ultimate', 'team-up', 'flick', 'Avengers', 'charismatic', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'once', 'again', 'title', 'role', 'addition', 'veteran', 'screenwriter', 'Shane', 'Black', 'helm', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'officially', 'kicks', 'off', 'second', 'phase', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'yet.Iron', 'Man', '3', 'completely', 'different', 'animal', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'Rather', 'overusing', 'spectacle', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armors', 'previous', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'story', 'man', 'armor', 'fact', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'Tony', 'beliefs', 'playboy', 'philanthropist', 'donning', 'armor', 'only', 'handful', 'times', 'movie', 'are', 'elements', 'film', 'not', 'typically', 'found', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'underlying', 'themes', 'really', 'add', 'story', 'including', 'war', 'terror', 'propagandization', 'revenge', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'point', 'time', 'Iron', 'Man', 'great', 'story', 'man', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'past.This', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'Shane', 'Black', 'film', 'filled', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'choppy', 'quips', 'definite', 'buddy', 'cop', 'feel', 'Black', 'writer', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'master', 'smart', 'pop', 'culture', 'injected', 'lines', 'actor', 'better', 'suited', 'deliver', 'RDJ', 'direction', 'Black', 'taken', 'character', 'darker', 'tale', 'been', 'told', 'outcome', 'one', 'very', 'well.As', 'out', 'movie', 'saw', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'expected', 'see', 'good', 'way', 'story', 'twists', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'marketing', 'team', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'hiding', 'trailers', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'aerial', 'rescue', 'final', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'lot', 'more', 'humor', 'trailers', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'also', 'memorable', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'given', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'role', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'fun', 'back-and-forth', 'exchanges', 'RDJ', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'memorable', 'Mandarin', 'who', 'steals', 'show', 'way', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'mysterious', 'manipulative', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'was', 'also', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'casting', 'youngster', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'who', 'somehow', 'out-banter', 'Tony', 'Stark.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'high-flying', 'action-packed', 'previous', 'films', 'very', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Avengers', 'terrific', 'addition', 'Marvel', 'universe']",N/A

The odd thing to see is how much tony's suits are failing, in the first movie alone he perfects the suit and i guess with mark 42 the idea is that he's pushing the boundaries of his skills and thus things are falling apart with his latest suit and his life. I think i just got more insightful than i care to...We get teased along with the whole mark 42 suit because they imply there are upwards of 40 suits lying around. It's no secret due to the trailer that those suits all show up at the end to fight off the baddies. My main reservation is in just how ridiculously strong they made the extremis badguys. I'd have notched their overall abilities down a good 30 percent.The other obvious ridiculous stupidity is that he's in the PROTOTYPE in preparation for a TERRORIST attack...meanwhile he has 40 other suits that are finished and ready and completely autonomous but for some reason he decided to keep them out of it and rely just on the one prototype.... pretty retarded for a genius.and i guess were supposed to believe that after his house is destroyed that he couldn't call them out because the rubble was on top of the chamber. man, if they just had some weapons to blow out of that rubble... oh wait....But honestly that gaping hole wasn't ruining of the film, but if you have a half of a brain it'll make you shake your head.Guy pierce was awesome, loved his character.

Everyone knows the coolest thing about Iron Man is Iron Man himself, Tony Stark in his armor, doing cool things and saving the day. Yet for most of this movie Tony is either not in armor at all or, when he is, it is flimsy, faulty test armor. Another cool thing about Iron Man is Tony is the only Iron Man. They ruined that by putting all kinds of people in the armor and even letting the armor itself become a character, flying around and saving the day all by itself. Apparently Iron Man himself is not only not unique or special, he himself is not even needed. Early on it seemed as if they had at least gotten the idea of having a credibly formidable adversary right but in the end that too turned out to be an empty suit.

Vargas ""DDDL""","[14, 45]","The first Iron Man movie was a pleasant surprise to me, most of the movie tried to be realistic in the context of the kind of superhero that Iron Man is, this is something that i guess we all owe to the last Batman trilogy. Unfortunately this third Iron Man movie broke with that new standard and depicts situations on which i was like ""no way, that's silly!"".SPOILER ALERT, where can I start? Let's be realistic, the superpowers that Killian and his sidekicks develop from just an injection are plain ridiculous (FIREBREATHING? REALLY???), COMMON!! they could have come with something smarter than that! Now the whole smart-suit-parts-that-seek-for-Tony thing is also over the roof. I also hated that in order to try to give a spectacular twist to the movie they wasted Ben Kingsley's ""Mandarin"" character, he could have been a super sinister Joker-like villain... sometimes simpler is better, I am actually surprised that such an excellent actor as Kingsley agreed to that degrading roll. How about a deeper development of Iron Patriot's character with interaction between him and Iron Man? maybe some conflict between them, that could have worked. And, what happened with the Iron Man suit's strength? it seemed like Tony Stark in a move to cut costs outsourced the manufacturing of the armour to China, as easy as the armour was destroyed in several parts of the movie even me myself could have defeated Iron Man just with a can opener. It is also unfortunate that the suits are already autonomous and do not need an actual human inside of them, with this what's the point on Tony Stark risking his life inside an armour? he could retire to Bali and control his suit army from a beach bench with a pina colada in one hand, they took away the human component to Iron Man and that breaks with the essence of Iron Man.Beneath the good things were the great special effects and of course Robert Downey's excellent Tony Stark characterization.

I think since you know all the characters and the world the film has created, they felt they could add more levity this time to the story. Yes Tony still spouts zingers the whole time, Pepper has come into her own and their romance is quirky and cute. The music is all rock and roll, just like the character, and the effects are great, even if a bit unbelievable.If you liked the first two you will love this one.

Frankly, it doesn't fare any better for the effort. That's partially due to the Tony Stark character hitting a wall - his arc has been stagnant for a while now - but I found more culpability in the icy set of cold feet developed around the plot's halfway point. In the blink of an eye, the whole tone of the picture changes from a topical dash of political intrigue (and a pointed metaphor for the US's approach to terrorism) to just another struggle between Stark and the latest in a long line of bland, suit-wearing, self-enhanced business rivals with an eye on one of his inventions. That the Mandarin is downplayed doesn't necessarily bother me. Actually, I found Ben Kingsley wonderful in the role and enjoyed the sudden wheel-jerk of his change in course (those upset about his blasphemous take on a sacred character need look no further than the short follow-up film All Hail the King for vindication). But that sudden, accompanying leap from a new path to a tired, over-familiar formula is a development sour enough to curl toes. This character needed a blast of fresh air, some momentum to carry him through the next phase of Marvel's plans. Instead, he's simply planted his feet deeper in the same vat of quicksand.

KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[5, 15]","I almost skipped opening day of Iron Man 3, but was able to clear the afternoon for my wife and I to go see ol' Shell Head in action for his third solo outing.We went to see it in IMAX 3D as I had a couple of free passes. While the 3D effect is very good, I didn't think it added much to the movie and wasn't nearly as effective as The Avengers was in 3D.Iron Man 3 runs around 2 hours (2 hours long when credits start to roll) and 15 minutes, but feels longer. If not for Robert Downey's ability to captivate an audience, this film may have been a complete bore. It has a decent story even if a bit incoherent, the special effects are excellent with tons of new Iron Man suits and gadgets, but the Iron Man action is quite sparse until the big finale.The trailers showed us Iron Man's arch enemy was going to be the main villain, but The Mandarin is completely wasted in the film and the only association with the character in the comic book is in name only.You would think this would be a huge disappointment, but once I realized the joke being played on us, I got over it and decided to just enjoy the film for what it is. The Mandarin does give the film a few laughs, but it would have been cool to have Iron Man fight another villain instead of variations of Iron Men like in the finale of the first two films.I'm sure there is going to be hell to pay from any Iron Man fan boys seeing this film and I don't blame them. I have gotten to a point where I am just happy to see quality super hero films regardless of such liberties....Life is short, go with it and relax guys.******SPOILER ALERT******All the main characters are back, but it seems like they are all conveniently ""busy"" Happy is in a coma after a run in with the super villain, Pepper is running Stark Industries and also has a run in with the super villain, Rhodes is now Iron Patriot  also has a run in with the super villain...yadda yadda yadda.......******* END OF SPOILER******If not for Downey this film would fall apart, but somehow it doesn't. I was interested throughout even if I wondered from time to time when the hell is Iron Man going to kick some A$$!For some reason in the world of super hero movies, the film makers think that we must give the super hero outrageous disadvantages and put them up against ridiculous odds.While this tactic may work for drama's sake, it is extremely frustrating for fans to have to watch our hero being continually beaten about all the time, Downey takes so much punishment in this outing that he barely keeps his Iron suit on for more than a minute at a time.Of course the end battle is spectacular and in my opinion the best of the three films in this department(one reason being, I'm sick of Iron Man fighting other Iron Men!). After the giant battle the ending is wrapped up quickly and is a little strange too as it leads us to believe that Iron Man is no more, at least as we know him. I doubt this is the case and we all know in the land of movies, no one is ever truly gone.......especially if there is big money to be made!

Smail ""L""","[3, 6]","IRON MAN III -  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, Ben KingsleyPremise: One year after the harrowing events of ""The Avengers"", Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a changed man - he's seen things and now they're taking a toll on his psyche and his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow). When the Mandarin (Kingsley) initiates a series of terrorist attacks against the United States, tragedy hits home for Stark - stirring him to action. As Stark investigates this new foe, he learns about the technological program known as ""Extremis"" which brings him against a new line of cyber-enhanced foes that might be more than a match for Iron Man...Thoughts: Iron Man III is Marvel's unveiling of ""Phase II"" - the lead up to Avengers II - and it presents a subtly different take on Tony Stark/Iron Man. Taking over directorial duties for Jon Favreau is Shane Black (the acclaimed inventor of the Buddy Cop genre with his screenplay for Lethal Weapon), who brings a sharp flair for humorous quirk and sharp wit, which complements Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and enhances it. This film retains the charm of its predecessors while diving head into an exceptionally exciting genre: the technological thriller. On this third go around, the cast gels - Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau and Downey all hit the ground running. The new additions (Pearce, Kingsley, and Hall) all act as very strong foils to each of the main cast and help develop the acclaimed ""Extremis"" story line from the comics. That said, certain stylistic elements were questionable: such as the Mandarin's voice - which has heavily reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker - gets a tad old quickly but with purpose. However, this is overshadowed by better choices: such as Tony's friendship with a young boy named Harley, which illustrates a side of him we have not scene before. The film is full of unexpected surprises and touching emotional moments which make this film a must see. And like all Marvel films, be sure to stick around for after the credits for a nice little post-credit scene involving a character we have seen before in a surprising situation. ;)Should you buy this film? Absolutely. Iron Man III is the first ""Must See"" summer blockbuster and it more than redeems Marvel for their last solo Iron Man film, which felt more like a commercial and less like a movie. Exceptionally crafted, brilliantly directed and realistically dealing with the ""why not just call the Avengers"" problem in a satisfying manner, this film will be a great collection for any fan of comics, Downey Jr. or Shane Black.

1559285,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B008JFUO72,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","When confronted by his own vulnerability, Tony Stark made himself stronger with his Iron Man suit. But now he's seen that for all his power, there are plenty of people out there bigger and badder than him.In that way, &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; isn't really a sequel to the previous &#34;Iron Man&#34; movies, but a sequel to &#34;The Avengers.&#34; With that in mind, director Shane Black brings a more introspective, raw quality to the third movie about the man in the mechanical suit -- there's still plenty of quirky humor and Robert Downey Jr. being awesome, but it's trying to be more introspective.Ever since the events of &#34;The Avengers,&#34; Tony Stark (Downey) has been suffering from panic attacks and insomnia. He's also been compulsively building newer, stronger Iron Man suits, and even injects himself with nanotech that allows him to control the suits with his will. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) isn't pleased about his weird behavior.Then a cruel new terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) unleashes a series of bombings on US soil. When one of the bombings badly injures Happy (Jon Favreau), an angry Tony challenges him to come and get him. Bad idea: the Mandarin bombs Tony's seaside mansion to the ground, and Tony is presumed dead. But he's not dead -- he's just stranded in Tennessee, with a broken suit.And as he works to fix his suit, Tony discovers that the terrorists are somehow involved with an experimental virus known as Extremis -- which the think-tank genius Killian (Guy Pearce) has been showing off to Pepper. Now Tony must not only get himself back together, but unravel an elaborate conspiracy centered around Extremis. If he doesn't, he may lose everything that he loves.Expect &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; to be very different from the previous two movies, because director Shane Black (best known for &#34;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#34;) has a very different style from Jon Favreau. In this case, he's trying to blend together a fiery, fast-moving thriller with a more introspective look at Tony Stark -- who is he and what can he do without his armor? What is most important to him? Is the armor just his security blanket against the big bad world?Don't worry, things don't get too angsty. There's still plenty of Tony's quirky humor (giant stuffed bunny) and some gloriously white-hot action scenes -- which are made even cooler by the presence of Tony's independently-moving Iron Man suits. Awesome. And even in the tense, dark scenes, Black is able to insert some clever dialogue (&#34;Don't shoot! Seriously, I don't even like working here. They are so weird!&#34;) and dark slapstick (Tony running into a truck).The biggest problem? When Tony lands in Tennessee, the plot's momentum grinds to a halt, and it doesn't start up again until he leaves. I don't know why we needed this whole section with Tony's tattooed fanboy and the kid who helps him fix his suit -- it feels totally disconnected from everything else.As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is complete perfection here. On the one hand, he's still the snarky, clever technical genius (&#34;'a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner' could be the name of my autobiography!&#34;), but his Tony is also struggling to deal with his insecurities and fears. Downey gives a beautifully subtle depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder, revealing Tony's fears without making him seem weak.The rest of the cast is almost as great -- Paltrow gets some awesome scenes as a self-assured woman dealing with a very difficult boyfriend, and she even has an awesome action scene. Don Cheadle is awesome, Guy Pearce is wonderfully creepy, and Ben Kingsley... well, who is more perfect to play a charismatic, eerie terrorist? Nobody!&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; suffers from a dead spot in the middle, but otherwise it rounds off the Iron Man trilogy beautifully -- and while it's wrapped up, the door is left open for more adventures.

1559308,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUO72,FNDNreview,"[3, 15]","Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III.  The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is 'can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers?'  The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time.  It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time.  So, how do you follow that kind of success?  The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success - at least any other comic book film, that is.  We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it?  The answer to that question is: momentum.  Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine.  Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film - well, we have that answer for you.Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks.  Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States.  One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire - which quickly gains Stark's attention.  At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an ""explosive"" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis.  Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr.  Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm.  Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress.  The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions.  Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley - who is nothing short of a treat in this film.  They honestly couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character).  Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark - just because he's smarter than everyone else.  Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting villain in the franchise.Now - here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight.  If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption.  The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers.  If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, or Chris Hemsworth - you'll be very disappointed.  Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.  And, the ugly has to begin with an apology.  Sorry, kids - there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy.  This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be.  Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of The Empire Strikes Back.  He gets an ass-kicking in this film that just keeps on giving.  However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films.  For the average movie-goer, Iron Man III is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy.  Iron Man II has the best villains, Iron Man has the best plot, and Iron Man III is just a combination of the first two films.  Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning - in the grand scheme of things - Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.  There's not much of cliffhanger and nothing overly exciting going on to lead into the next Phase II film.  Sure, it's an enjoyable, entertaining fill - but this critic can't help but want more.Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers.  Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) - yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.Overall Film Grade: C+FNDNreview.com",3,Downey Jr. does his best without The Avengers,1367539200,"05 3,

The result of these efforts (and they are darned good efforts, so hats off the writers), is a story in which our superhero feels much more HUMAN, as opposed to SUPERHUMAN, and this works well. The end of the world scenario is fine for superhero movies, but it's been done so many times now, it lacks novelty or any real sense of urgency. This movie's more focused plot (with smaller stakes) is more in line with something like ""Kick Ass"", where the emphasis is on a more personal level, and in my book, way more effective.

The chemistry between Stark and Rhoadie is much better here than in Iron Man 2.  The scene in which Stark's house is destroyed is top-flight filmmaking.The Bad-  The scene where his house is destroyed is the first action sequence of the movie and also the best of the film. That's bad.  For some reason, there are no working Iron Man suits throughout the entire movie (either the weapons system is down but he decides to wear the suit anyway, or all his suits break apart like toys from a thrift shop). The fraility of the suits was annoying. He gives one a karate chop after it goes haywire in response to a nightmare he is having and it crumbles like an old cookie. Huh?  Yet, in the Avengers, he gets caught up in the rotor of the SHIELD heli-carrier and the suit remains intact (as it should, otherwise Tony Stark would be dead). Another negative was the lack of a villian who posed a threat.  In this movie we are promised the Mandarin, but in an act of blatant false advertising the audience is cheated and we are given 'Firedude' as the main villian.  Then, Iron Man must fight Firedude's henchman who have the same power as the main villian (borrrring).  Firedude is too busy constantly making jokes to ever prove a menance to Iron Man.  Super Patriot is completely wasted in this movie.  A cool looking suit, but all he ever does is walk around.  There is also a lot of mistimed humor here, namely, at the film's climax (not really the time for slapstick, but rather, to get the audience pumped up).  The climax is an unmitigated diaster, everyone jumping around as if it were a videogame and ordinary people making jumps with Spider-man like grace.Huh? The end of the film deconstructs what the previous two had  established (see for yourself). Tony Stark is physically in an Iron Man suit for about 15 minutes (probably less) of the 2+ hour movie. Uhhh, isn't that the whole point of the movie?The Deal- Shane Black misses by a country mile here.  While there are some good scenes, the parts are greater than the sum.  I was somewhat disappointed in Iron Man 2, but Iron man 3, makes Iron Man 2 look like Iron Man 1. The story was interesting up until about the mid-way point where the wheels came off in a hurry.  If you like seeing Tony Stark beat up baddies without his armor, then this movie is your cup of tea.  Initially, I was excited about Shane Blank writing and directing.

Obviously not in the near future as this comic book recreation IRON MAN 3 has made almost as much money as HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE - $1,215,439,994 and counting. Money talks and in this case it shouts, so we are likely in for more Iron Man episodes.`A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.' This quote form the film is cogent in that it nods to the feeling of some viewers. The plot is more about `things' than story but incase a story line is needed then the following help decipher the reason this movie takes over 2 hours to tell: `IRON MAN 3 pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) against an enemy Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and his `front' ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?' That makes the film sound like it has a tale to tell.Actually the writing (Drew Pearce, Shane Black, Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Warren Ellis, Adi Granov - whew!) tosses some terrific one-liners that do entertain, but the main character is the special effects crew. Actors Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau, Ty Simpkins, Paul Bettany's voice and a host of real TV personalities help the derring-do do, and likely in 3D this is quick a show.

1559352,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B008JFUO72,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 2]","Before we attend to details about the movie itself, I want to draw your attention to an item I spotted in the lab scene (6:17). When Tony asks for the Christmas music to begin, there's a quick shot of the record player. Nearby, there's a red album cover on the table.It's A Charlie Brown Christmas, the read-along storybook and record album with dialogue from the sound track. This record album was released in the late '70s on the ""Charlie Brown Records"" label, a division of Disneyland/Vista Records. You won't see this factoid anywhere else, nor should you. Apparently talented visionary genius types like Tony Stark like Peanuts -- and cool cartoon records.(AS IN MOST REVIEWS, THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT WHAT SPOILED THE MOVIE)Anyway, I wish the entire film was as satisfactory. Iron Man 3 was certainly entertaining in the current superspetacular movie-as-theme-park-ride way, but there are some serious story flaws that I suspect sprang from whoever forced the filmmakers to add the ""twist"" of the Mandarin being an actor.I do not object to the idea as a comic book fan as so many have, but because you can tell that the rest of the film seems to have been reconfigured to make this micro-managed plot splotch work.It may be a guess, but if the film were not reconfigured, that would make the two years of work by the entire cast and crew seem less than what they are clearly capable of. The film works so well up until the scene in which the fake Mandarin is revealed, I cannot believe that that such an experienced, accomplished team did this by design. Something's fishy, no matter how much the director and screenwriter valiantly try to make excuses for the situation on the otherwise fascinating audio commentary (which reveals more about the personalities of the duo than the film).Robert Downey, Jr. is the heart and soul of the film, optimizing both the dramatic and comic aspects. The Pepper character is just as strong, caring and competent as ever, though her sports bra superpower moments also seem added -- Pepper was plenty strong already folks, without supplements.The special effects are of course, top of the line, especially in the home destruction scene. What is truly remarkable is the nail-biting aerial rescue as the people plummet through the sky. This is what makes this kind of film great. Yet, the climactic battle scene is just one explosion after another, with as many Iron Man suits as they could fit into the scenes -- again, seeming to come from someone saying, ""Let's cram in a lot of suits? That'll make it better!""Again, I have to wonder if the climactic battle was always between Tony and Killian. Guy Pearce is a superb actor in the right role, but he doesn't come across as the ""real"" Mandarin. He's much better as the smarmy, creepy toady of the real boss (like he was in Bedtime Stories).

The movies story was mediocre, just enough to move the movie along.  Then it felt like certain action sequences were added for the sake of action sequences.For non comic fans the switch with the Mandarin not being a real villain, simply an actor may have been okay.  Unfortunately I know a bit about the Mandarin and he is one of the best villains for Iron Man.  Which was disappointing that he was wasted in the manner he was.However even with the movies mishaps Robert Downey Jr. delivers another performance to life.  The movie was vastly entertaining and enjoyable.  The humor and action were placed correctly, in a way that the movie doesn't feel long.  Which make it a fun movie to go see.When the movie is done you won't be like &#34;Whoa! That was amazing&#34; or &#34;Whoa! What a horrible movie.&#34;  You'll be left somewhere in the middle, where you won't be sorry you saw it but it isn't anything to write home about either.

1559356,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B008JFUO72,Grimluke,"[4, 6]","There's been a lot of controversy over this movie (in a matter of accuracy to the comics). Some people weren't very fond of how they portrayed the antagonist of the movie because it was so different than how the comics depicted that character. While I definitely see what they mean (I won't go into details due to spoilers), I don't see that as something worth getting so worked up about. I was very impressed with the way this movie turned out, and it has become one of my favorite films of 2013. The writing was hilarious and has definitely become one of my favorite scripts in any Marvel movie to date. I also really liked how much Tony has matured since the first movie. He's still far from perfect but he's definitely an improvement over the mess he was in Iron Man 2. In fact, I think this movie made better use of Tony Stark than Iron Man himself! Normally I'd consider it a problem to make the secret identity a bigger role than the super hero, but in this case I consider it a positive. When it comes to story, it was also pretty good. They had some pretty interesting plot points throughout the film. This, unfortunately, is  the source of the bad too. Some of these plot points lead into those inaccuracies that I mentioned earlier (and there's a part in the final battle that I consider completely cartoonish and stupid). So basically, in movie standards, the plot is fascinating. In comic book standards, it's gonna raise some eyebrows. I'm not a particular fan of reading comic books, but I like stuff based on comics, and this happens to be one of my favorite comic book adaptions I've ever seen.UPDATE: I just watched the movie a second time on New Year's Eve and thought it was actually better than I remembered! I think this is due to the fact that this time I was prepared for some of those things I didn't like so much (like the inaccuracies).",5,Three's the Magic Number,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,1863,"['been', 'lot', 'controversy', 'movie', 'matter', 'accuracy', 'comics', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'fond', 'how', 'portrayed', 'antagonist', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'how', 'comics', 'depicted', 'character', 'definitely', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'due', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'something', 'getting', 'so', 'worked', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2013', 'writing', 'was', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'scripts', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'date', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'much', 'Tony', 'matured', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'far', 'perfect', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'mess', 'was', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'fact', 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'better', 'use', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'consider', 'problem', 'make', 'secret', 'identity', 'bigger', 'role', 'super', 'hero', 'case', 'consider', 'positive', 'When', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'plot', 'points', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'source', 'bad', 'too', 'plot', 'points', 'lead', 'inaccuracies', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'part', 'final', 'battle', 'consider', 'completely', 'cartoonish', 'stupid', 'So', 'basically', 'movie', 'standards', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'comic', 'book', 'standards', 'gon', 'raise', 'eyebrows', ""'m"", 'not', 'particular', 'fan', 'reading', 'comic', 'books', 'like', 'stuff', 'based', 'comics', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.UPDATE', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'remembered', 'think', 'due', 'fact', 'time', 'was', 'prepared', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'inaccuracies']",N/A

Looking back at the last film, the Avengers, this doesn't make any sense. Spoiler alert: destroying his toys at the end? Completely nave.

This gave us one really touch scene when he uses this capability to protect Pepper.But the middle third of the movie just seemed tedious and drawn out.

After waiting impatiently for 3 years for IM 3 here goes:Firstly, I AM a comic fan so I am familiar with the Marvel universe. Secondly, this was the most OBNOXIOUSLY arrogant film I've ever seen. Shane Black completely RUINED the Avengers continuity--Oh no, not from me but from Joss Whedon himself!! Youtube it--This script had some good dialogue and ideas other than the obvious flaws that the Mandarin was a fake and ridiculous and Tony never wore the suit very much and when he did it would just fall off??(or the hero half the screen time fights unmasked). I'm tired of writers premising a plot that interferes with what the characters are ABOUT. Yes you can throw in the personal character conflict and STILL maintain the action as long as said action includes yep, you guessed it, Iron Man (since that IS the title of movie). I'm also sick of the writers always making our hero a 'bumbling incompetent buffoon' til the end of the movie when they finally 'save the day'. You want personal character conflict address Tony's alcoholism not his panic attacks.The Iron Patriot was useless. The Killian character was never developed--How did they attain their powers? (Yes I know it was from some mutant plant but really they exist...???) Why did some of them spontaneously combust? Why was Killian actually the Mandarin?? How was the actor not spotted by his actor buddies and not exposed as a fraud??The female botanist character was COMPLETELY worthless and added NOTHING to the plot or in any help to Tony.The Christmas Carol character of 'Timmy' the antagonist was annoying and actually made me angry at him.Also, are you telling me ALL of Tony's suits are stored in his Malibu home? All in plain sight?? None in the basement of any of his probably other 20 locales he owns? Not 1??? Also he communicated with Jarvis the whole time why didn't he order up the robot army sooner?? WHY did it take days to charge his worthless suit?? WITH electricity. Why didn't Jarvis summon the Iron Patriot suit?? He can 'overide' all commands thus far...In a life or death situation WHY wouldn't he use a tried and true suit to insure your safety?? A squirrely malfunctioning prototype to protect you from a real threat??? Yeah that's a good idea...And no one thought to call the other Avengers?? At least Captain America?Are you also telling me terrorists needed Stark to publicly tell them his Malibu address to find it they couldn't GPS or google it themselves?? NOR was he in the LEAST prepared for said attack???The regeneration theme was better suited to an X Men movie, NOT Iron Man. IM should be about hi tech villains and gadgetry, not an army of Human Torches which could also be a Fantastic Four movie but I digressThe little kid was in the movie because when Robert Downey makes appearances at Comicons the kids show up in droves to honor IM wearing their mini IM suits and IM gear pointing their pretend laser blasts from their hands at him (you can youtube this if you want to see it). I suppose this was homage/appeasement to their loyalty. This is also possibly why RD doesn't want to play the role of Tony Stark anymore.When Iron Man was flying 100 mph and hit the semi truck going probably 70 on the bridge and it knocks his suit off, Tony had to land on the pavement going at least 80--AND survives??This movie SUCKED on so many levels it makes Cat Woman look like Citizen Kane. When you have Thor, Captain America and The Avengers being taken seriously then you pull this kinda crap on us you should be sent to comic book HELL or at least made to watch Aliens or Predator or Jurassic Park 10 times each to see a REAL action movie.This is what happens when Joss Whedon and Jon Favreau don't direct.I hope Shane Black NEVER works again.BTW, Iron Man 2 ROCKEDI also don't know why our president in 2013 (It is set in OUR current timeline) is STILL GW Bush??? Oh wait--to make our current regime look like bad guys in a movie would be racist gotta keep it old white guys they are the true villains in America right?? NOT our REAL bold face PROVEN liar of a president----Liberal Hollywood at it's finest...3/1/14After seeing Thor: The Dark World is even MORE reason to hate Shane Black--Hey Shane you ever seen a comic book movie??? Or a movie for that matter coz you don't know d$%k about it. The director of Thor in the Marvel One Shot was desperately trying to UNDO what Shane Tard did to the Mandarin and contunuity of the Avengers/Marvel Universe.

1559366,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUO72,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 7]","So Tony Stark, him what's a ""genius billionaire playboy philanthropist,"" is of late going thru a crap time. His stint with the Avengers, his part in stopping the Chitauri invasion, has opened his eyes to the immensity of the universe and his tiny dot of a place in it. Today Tony suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and the wiggy moments and the chronic insomnia that go with that. ""I'm a pipin' hot mess,"" he confesses. Mostly he wants to protect the things he cherishes most, and topping that list is Pepper Potts, the one person he ""cannot live without."" And so you may scratch your head and ponder why Tony would so impulsively publicly challenge the fearsome global terrorist, him what styles himself the Mandarin and is ethnically ambiguous and dresses like a Chinese warlord. Tony, in that brash moment, gives out his Malibu home address on national tv. That moment bites him in the butt.But wait... As Tony, who provides voice-over narration, tells it, this mess originates thirteen years ago. The film opens on New Year's Eve in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, during a technological summit. Tony Stark, back then more warmonger than philanthropist, was busy applying his brand of seduction on hottie botanist - but she's more than a botanist - Dr. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Callous and randy, he dismisses the overtures made by the unkempt, geeky scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Tony literally leaves him out in the cold.Present-day now, and Killian has resurfaced as this sleek, confident entrepreneur, and his big brain is big and brainy enough that it dazzles the normally unimpressed Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, Tony, consumed by his anxiety attacks, has neglected his personal relationships in favor of heavy time in the lab (and if you'd seen the trailers, then you know what he'd been tinkering with down there).The Mandarin's reach spans limitless, seems like. His retaliation to Tony's challenge is rapid and ruthless and comprehensive. The destruction of Tony's world propels him on a quest to root out all those responsible. And maybe that's the smartest move that writer/director Shane Black contributes. Months ago, Black had vowed that, for this movie, he wouldn't pit men in armor against each other, and he holds to that. In fact, the pendulum swings so much the other way that, if anything, there may be a dearth of Iron Man sequences. Instead, Black opts to showcase Tony Stark predominantly outside of his metal shell. When you strip away the CG and the big superhero elements, this movie essentially boils down to a detective story. And it's never ever a dummy move to shoot more of Robert Downey, Jr. in front of the camera. And because this is Downey, Jr. and because this is Tony Stark, Tony's recent emotional damage never quite undercuts the swagger. Downey's comic timing is impeccable, the quicksilver wit flashes plenty, but without compromising the dramatic beats. Downey is so good. Shane Black, who directed him in the awesome KISS KISS BANG BANG, takes full advantage of his star's talents. This is, of course, providing that you're down with - or if you buy into - Stark's having accrued debilitating trauma as a direct result of what he experienced in THE AVENGERS. Some may contend that Tony Stark is so arrogant there's no room in his psyche for a bump of insecurity.IRON MAN 3 is killing it at the box office because folks view it as a direct AVENGERS sequel and because of (mostly) positive word-of-mouth. Much to like about IRON MAN 3, but also a grip of select quibbles.The positives (don't worry, no spoilers):- If you like Shane Black and his slick, high octane formula and his sense of humor, then prepare to get giddy- The screenplay is sharp and emotionally charged and puts Stark thru his paces- More of Downey, Jr. on camera, oozing charisma and demonstrating yet again that Stark is much more than a guy in an iron suit- Expands the roles of Pepper, Rhodey, and even Happy- It presents a startling take on one of Iron Man's classic adversaries. Ben Kingsley threatens to steal scenes from Downey- Neat focus on the Mark 42 armor, on its strengths and weaknesses- Somewhere along the way, Tony finds himself in Tennessee and runs into a kid sidekick (Disney's mandate?) and exhibits wonderful chemistry with him- Ample references made to the Avengers movie (my favorite is probably Happy's comment about Tony's being too busy hanging out with his Superfriends)- Humor, plenty of it- ""Trevor Slattery,"" brilliant- The post-credit scene- Cool armor mayhemThe negatives:- A few dead spots (usually when Downey's not onscreen)- Diehard comic book fans may get upset over the treatment of the Mandarin- Not a faithful adaptation of the fan favorite Warren Ellis ""Extremis"" arc (again depends on how much of a diehard comic book fan you are)- Pretty tired of the often regurgitated super-soldier formula plotline- Was the Ten Rings, a seed planted in the first IRON MAN, even mentioned in IRON MAN 3? (Maybe I missed it)- Rebecca Hall's part is underdeveloped- Late in the film, a cop out of what would've been a hell of a dramatic development- Obstinately sidesteps explaining why none of Tony's Superfriends come to help out- In the interest of having the cake and blah blah blah... not enough Iron Man- May be Downey's swan song (if it is, it's a good way to bow out)",4,"""Who's the hot mess

It's always very important for any movie in a franchise to do well after a big movie, such as the event that was ""The Avengers"". But IM3 totally exceeded the expectations and proved that we fans had nothing to worry about. It combines all the best things from the previous two Iron Man films, with a story and a cast that was still original enough to make for a great movie. Also, the entire Iron Man franchise is very rooted in the ideas of self-destruction and regret. Therefore, if you pay attention to these themes in all three films, then you notice a progressive full-circle kind of thing. The first Iron Man introduced us to the character of Tony Stark and his genius, but there were slight implications of self-destruction in that if he didn't figure out something to do with all of his money and technology, then he would never be able to make up for all the mistakes he made as a weapons supplier/dealer. In IM2, he absolutely has to figure out how to fix his relationships with others and the problem with his arc reactor, or he will most certainly die and regret how he didn't fix them. And now, in Iron Man 3, his obsession with building all these different suits and using them to save the world has finally come back around to bite him in the butt, and he has to figure how to fix it all by himself. This leads to some very welcome flashbacks from Tony's experiences in ""The Avengers"". The film's big twist is surprising and very well thought out/set up. Others have said that this totally eliminates the entire idea of the villain, but the film makes it clear that the villian still exists within the film, just in an unexpected way. Besides, when anyone feels that the physical villain of the film does not satisfy, they can always rely on that self-destructive factor of Tony himself. That is also a villain, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense. Shane Black's direction makes sure there is a definite balance between action, great emotion/feeling, and some comedy. At times in the film, all of these things will exist in one scene, usually one right after the other. Unsurprisingly, RDJ turns in a terrific job once again. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Paltrow and Pearce. IM3 also doesn't disappoint in the general sense of the franchise. While Iron Man was and still is a great movie, Iron Man 2 was all over the place and never did really find a central theme, but there were certain parts of it that were very good and somewhat made up for where it fell short. Now, Iron Man 3 has absolutely wowed the socks off all its appreciative fans, and still is, according to the box office numbers. It featured what we loved from the first Iron Man in spades, while still kicking all of that up a notch with a much stronger central theme. Therefore, it is the best in the series for me.",5,"Unlike IM2, does not disappoint at all.

I have enjoyed many of the movies created from the Marvel Universe of superheroes (especially the most recent Thor movie) BUT this was an absolutely terrible film.#1. Too much time spent on Tony Stark the man rather than Ironman the superhero. Who really cares about Tony Stark. It is his alter ego who is supposed to be the real star.#2. The Mandarin was a real super villain in his first appearances in Ironman comics. He was Chinese. He wore rings of power and he was a deadly threat to Ironman. Here he is a joke, a British actor playing at being him with the real power being AIM.#3. Enough with the modernizing/revising of Marvel super hero history.  I see ,as usual, that many people giving this good ratings have no clue about the history of Ironman. They are dazzled by special effects.#4. This was long, boring, and tedious to watch.#5. The script was awful. Way too many quips and smart ass remarks by Tony Stark and others. Why all the needless scenes that made this movie drag.#6. Stop pandering to people who don't really appreciate what a good old fashioned super hero is supposed to be.#7. Should have simplified the script. All the tech stuff was way too confusing. Not enough Ironman in action. Too much action by his extra Ironman suits without him in them.#8. The script should have created a real Mandarin truer to his origins and made combat between him and Ironman the feature of epic battles. Instead we have a wimpy brainy scientist with a chip on his shoulder who also spends too much time talking and trying to make witty quips (just like Tony Stark).#9. Great art is more characterized by what one leaves out rather than what one puts in. Here they could have edited out so much that was non essential and left in the real essence of Ironman as the star rather than Tony Stark.#10. Jack Kirby would turn in his grave if he saw this film.

1559384,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008JFUO72,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[21, 37]","With last summer's gargantuan financial and critical slam-dunk of Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS, it's sure that any film following that from Marvel Studios would have its work cut out for it. And since it was the franchise that paved the way for THE AVENGERS, it's only natural that the film that would be the follow-up would be the third (and perhaps final) film in the IRON MAN series. With expectations extremely high, but a little shaken after the lukewarm response to IRON MAN 2 (which is a film I do really enjoy despite its flaws), people are sure to go in feeling comfortable in seeing star Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the sardonic wit, effortless charm, and supreme snark of Anthony Stark facing off against what fans consider to be his greatest villain, The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, one of the finest living actors on Earth). And with fresh blood in the director's chair as Shane Black (whose only previous directorial feature was the criminally underrated KISS KISS, BANG BANG, but also is the screenwriter of the first LETHAL WEAPON, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and THE LAST BOY SCOUT) takes over for Jon Favreau, who directed Tony Stark's previous cinematic outings, this seemed sure to be a summer feast for the eyes and ears and mind.But unfortunately, while this film may be somewhat entertaining, both the plot and the star seem to run on autopilot the whole film.The central theme of the film is the answer to the question posed by Captain America to Stark during THE AVENGERS when he asks, ""Big man in a suit of armor; take that away, what are you?"" and this film is very determined to give you that answer. The film, also being a direct sequel to THE AVENGERS deals with Tony Stark's frame of mind in regards to the events of that film. He hasn't slept much, and has somewhat severe anxiety attacks whenever anyone brings up the events that almost led to his death in that film. It has alienated him from his girlfriend and CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, returning again), and he has spent all of his non-sleeping creating new armors. Meanwhile, a mysterious Bin Laden-esque terrorist known only as The Mandarin has been setting off explosions all over the world against American targets, prompting Tony's best friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle, reprising his role he took over from Terrence Howard) to don the War Machine armor retrofitted to adopt a gaudy rebranding as The Iron Patriot. Another explosion hits much closer to home, critically wounding Tony's longtime friend and Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau), prompting Tony to hunt The Mandarin himself essentially inviting an attack on his home. Entering the picture at this time are Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall of THE TOWN), an old flame of Tony's and bioengineering expert and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), rival scientist for Advanced Idea Mechanics, who are both working on a project called Extremis. Tony's newest armor, the Mark 42, fails after the attack on his home, Pepper is kidnapped by The Mandarin, and Tony is forced to rely on his intellect and his savvy to make it to the final confrontation between him and the forces of The Mandarin, where, naturally, the free world hangs in the balance.There are many things about this film that work: The snappy patter in this film is golden, and that's Black's bread-and-butter, if you've ever seen any of the films he's done; Ben Kingsley is absolutely magnetic as The Mandarin; and sequences like the Malibu house attack and parts of the second act where Stark is armorless and the scenes with Tony and Rhodey as they do the Riggs/Murtaugh prototypical buddy action stuff are terrific. However, for everything they do that's right, there's an equivalent number of things that go wrong. First, there is a very distinct lack of Pepper Potts in this film, and that loses big points right there. Black is someone that has never written women particularly well, and tends to use them more as damsels-in-distress rather than fully fleshed-out characters. Black does do a bit of a turn-around at the end with Pepper, but it seems like it was shoe-horned in. Secondly, there are some parts where the effects look downright clunky, but that's seldom. Also the second act is a MAJOR slog to get through, and the sequence where Stark has to MacGyver his way out of an assassin's grasp, while clever, feels very inorganic. The two most troublesome parts, though, are A: the autopilot that Downey is on as Stark, and B: the almost complete absence of actual plot. Tony Stark has become, for better or worse, Downey Jr's definitive role and he wears it brilliantly, but here in IM3, he seems like he's coming in for a visit to this character rather than living in it. Also, what's really going on in this film? Once a huge reveal is made about The Mandarin, the audience is left with far too little information. Why is this group doing all these things? How do certain players really fit in? What's their ultimate motivation? In the first film, Obidiah Stane wanted power. In the second, Vanko wants revenge and Justin Hammer wants the spotlight. Here, the villains seem to exist solely for the purpose of having a villain to fight, and that's just not enough.Black's direction is much more confident in the non-effects oriented scenes, and the final battle sequence is far too spastic to maintain any focus, and the fate that meets one of the main characters that is meant to shock really doesn't provide any shocks. Yet, everything is wrapped up in a neat enough package and we get a post-credits sequence that, while hilariously funny, does nothing to continue setting up the future of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. There are some nice easter eggs for Marvel fans, such as the existence of Advanced Idea Mechanics and Roxxon, but neither are utilized for full effect. And Marvel and Iron Man fans are likely to be very disappointed by the big reveal of The Mandarin. I understand why, to an extent, this was done, and I found it alternately clever and frustrating, which sums up this film perfectly.There's a lot of cleverness to IRON MAN 3 and it's not a terrible film, but ultimately, the film is undone by its own cleverness and that leads to a great deal of frustration in seeing what this film could have been rather than the bloated spectacle it is.2.5 out of

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[4, 8]","Iron Man 3, which is the focus of the Extremis virus and Tony Stark's mental breakdown after the events in The Avengers, is directed and co-written by Shane Black. Here, we see darker action sequences, much more serious plot, but also something that angered hard-core Marvel fans everywhere: The Mandarin, who is literally nothing like the one from the comics. Now, I do love action movies, and comic-to-film movies (DC and Marvel fan), but after watching Iron Man 3, I cannot fathom the stupidity behind the film. First, they turned Tony Stark's most powerful and diabolical enemy into a walking joke (literally) who was supposed to wield the ancient Ten Rings of Power, which came from an alien ship. But no, Shane Black completely removed that plot line from the Avengers universe. Why? Because it wasn't grounded and not realistic enough, and yet, somehow, people who breathe fire and explode is more realistic than aliens. Then, secondly, Aldrich Killian, who was supposed to kill himself for his mistake in creating Extremis, is a main villain here. I will just stop there, because I need to review the movie as a film now.The acting is good, with Downey, Jr. becoming a much more battle-hardened Tony, who must accept the fact that extra-terrestrials exist. Paltrow is great here, showing us a side to Pepper that we have yet to see, and it is awesome. The directing is good, being better than Favreau's in Iron Man 2, but not the first Iron Man. Brian Tyler's musical score is great, capturing both the bombastic action sequences and darkness that is surrounding Tony. The script was good (movie-wise), having a twist that some movie-goers will not see coming. The visual effects were good, but not award-worthy compared to that of other releases (Ex. Pacific Rim, Man of Steel, Oblivion).So, if you have not read the Iron Man comic storyline for ""Extremis,"" then you will like this addition.

However, the news that Shane Black was now involved made my day.For those of you who don't know, Shane Black wrote the first few Lethal Weapon movies and a slew of 90's action vehicles (The Last Boy Scout being one of my favorites when I was a kid).

The plot has a few flaws, but overall, it is the best Iron Man story out of all the Iron Man live action movies.  That said, it takes a page out of the Extremis comic story.  It is far from original.  It features a lot of old Iron Man elements we already saw in the Extremis motion comic (which is free on Amazon Prime Instant Video).  I honestly love the Extremis concept, but that is such a small portion of this movie's plot.  The story centers on Tony Stark's inner turmoil after the alien attack of the Marvel Avengers movie.The characters showed potential for some great backstory moments, but the writing simply did not offer much in terms of backstory, and characters simply did not get flushed out completely.  I think the Mandarin character could have been done in a way closer to the comic character.  I did not appreciate how Mandarin turned out.  Thankfully, the Extremis plot worked out fairly well.  The ending, however, left me wanting more, scratching my head about what happens next.  The writing was simply scattered and felt unfinished.Bonus Features (2/5)The bonus features are terrible for the price.  I would rather they give us the bonus features as separate videos.  Instead, they are formatted as part of the movie, which reminds me of why I don't like VHS tapes.  In this day and age, we should have better organization of features.  Menus have been around since DVD movies, and it is easier to make a menu system for the web, so I feel that they have no valid excuse to not give us properly formatted bonus features.  You could get the movie from Vudu instead and get the bonus features as separate videos.  I wish I did that instead of relying on Amazon Instant Video.The lack of organization aside, the bonus features were somewhat boring.  There was a making-of video that took up maybe 20-30 minutes right after the feature film, and there were bloopers for about 4-5 minutes at the very end of the video.  Between those features, there were some deleted scenes and a Captain America prequel short.  The short was actually pretty good, but it wasn't anything memorable.  The deleted scenes were deleted for a reason, but some of them made nice bloopers in my opinion.Overall, I think Amazon screwed up the formatting of the bonus features, and that is probably the biggest flaw with them.  However, I do not think the bonus features add enough to the movie to make it worth paying extra for.  Save money by buying the movie by itself if you have that option.",4,This is a spoiler-free review of the movie and the bonus features.,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,2573,"['Movie', '4/5', 'Let', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'concepts', 'thrown', 'movie', 'plot', 'few', 'flaws', 'overall', 'best', 'Iron', 'Man', 'story', 'Iron', 'Man', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'said', 'page', 'Extremis', 'comic', 'story', 'far', 'original', 'lot', 'old', 'Iron', 'Man', 'already', 'saw', 'Extremis', 'motion', 'comic', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', 'honestly', 'love', 'Extremis', 'concept', 'such', 'small', 'portion', 'movie', 'plot', 'story', 'centers', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'alien', 'attack', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'showed', 'potential', 'great', 'backstory', 'moments', 'writing', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'much', 'terms', 'backstory', 'characters', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'flushed', 'out', 'completely', 'think', 'Mandarin', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'closer', 'comic', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Mandarin', 'turned', 'out', 'Thankfully', 'Extremis', 'plot', 'worked', 'out', 'fairly', 'well', 'ending', 'however', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'scratching', 'head', 'what', 'next', 'writing', 'was', 'simply', 'scattered', 'felt', 'unfinished.Bonus', 'Features', '2/5', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'terrible', 'price', 'would', 'rather', 'give', 'bonus', 'separate', 'videos', 'Instead', 'are', 'formatted', 'part', 'movie', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'day', 'age', 'should', 'have', 'better', 'organization', 'features', 'Menus', 'have', 'been', 'DVD', 'movies', 'easier', 'make', 'menu', 'system', 'web', 'feel', 'have', 'valid', 'excuse', 'not', 'give', 'properly', 'formatted', 'bonus', 'features', 'could', 'get', 'movie', 'Vudu', 'instead', 'get', 'bonus', 'separate', 'videos', 'wish', 'did', 'instead', 'relying', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video.The', 'lack', 'organization', 'aside', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'was', 'making-of', 'video', 'took', 'up', 'maybe', '20-30', 'minutes', 'right', 'feature', 'film', 'were', 'bloopers', '4-5', 'minutes', 'very', 'end', 'video', 'Between', 'features', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Captain', 'America', 'prequel', 'short', 'short', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'memorable', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'reason', 'made', 'nice', 'bloopers', 'opinion.Overall', 'think', 'Amazon', 'screwed', 'up', 'formatting', 'bonus', 'features', 'probably', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bonus', 'add', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'worth', 'paying', 'extra', 'Save', 'money', 'buying', 'movie', 'have', 'option']",N/A

That's not to say it's a bad film, it just means that I liked the previous two Iron Man films better than this one. I should state that while I've become a big fan of Marvel movies, I was never a big reader of comic books - so my feelings toward the film are more about it's merits/flaws as a movie experience (rather than how true it is to the comics).I think about how far we've come since the first ""Iron Man"" (and it's not in a particularly good direction). That film was refreshing because it played everything totally realistically - everything was tech-based, there was nothing supernatural. And now, in the third film of the series, we've moved on to Extremis (which is by far the most un-realistic concept in any of the three films). Now I'm not against fantasy movies, but up until now I've considered ""Iron Man"" to be one of the more grounded superhero franchises - and I liked it that way.Also, it seems the new mandate from Marvel is to tie their movies together as much as possible, which is fine but it also puts a strain on the individual story being told. This film seemed to draw less on the previous ""Iron Man"" movies and instead focus on the fallout from ""The Avengers"". I understand why the events in that film, notably the battle in New York, would affect Stark emotionally. But that whole storyline feels unnecessary in ""Iron Man 3"", and Tony's random panic attacks seem very out of place (and don't mesh tonally with the rest of the film).PROS:- As always with the Iron Man films, the crowd-pleasers - the action sequences and the moments of humor - were very well-done.- Brian Tyler's score was fantastic, particularly the main theme for ""Iron Man 3"".CONS:- Although I love the song ""Blue"" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music. It just seems odd to not have AC/DC in an Iron Man movie (it fit so well).- To me, Tony's panic attacks felt out of place.- As someone who likes a certain level of realism in movies, the concept of Extremis (and in particular fire-breathing) was another step in the wrong direction.- I just wasn't a fan of the Mandarin's character arc. It was a valid choice the filmmakers made, but it just didn't play well for me.",3,Iron Man 3 - a fun but disappointing entry in the series,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2410,"['NOTE', 'are', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'review', 'nothing', 'would', 'deter', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'film.While', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'think', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'weakest', 'Iron', 'Man', 'trilogy', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'liked', 'previous', 'two', 'Iron', 'Man', 'better', 'one', 'should', 'state', ""'ve"", 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'reader', 'comic', 'books', 'so', 'feelings', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'merits/flaws', 'movie', 'experience', 'rather', 'how', 'true', 'comics', '.I', 'think', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'direction', 'film', 'was', 'refreshing', 'played', 'everything', 'totally', 'realistically', 'everything', 'was', 'tech-based', 'was', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'now', 'third', 'film', 'series', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'Extremis', 'far', 'most', 'un-realistic', 'concept', 'three', 'films', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'up', 'now', ""'ve"", 'considered', 'Iron', 'Man', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'grounded', 'superhero', 'liked', 'way.Also', 'new', 'mandate', 'Marvel', 'tie', 'movies', 'together', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'fine', 'also', 'strain', 'individual', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'seemed', 'draw', 'less', 'previous', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'instead', 'focus', 'fallout', 'Avengers', 'understand', 'why', 'events', 'film', 'notably', 'battle', 'New', 'York', 'would', 'affect', 'Stark', 'emotionally', 'whole', 'storyline', 'feels', 'unnecessary', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Tony', 'random', 'panic', 'attacks', 'seem', 'very', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'tonally', 'rest', 'film', '.PROS', 'always', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'crowd-pleasers', 'action', 'sequences', 'moments', 'humor', 'were', 'very', 'well-done.-', 'Brian', 'Tyler', 'score', 'was', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'main', 'theme', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', '.CONS', 'love', 'song', 'Blue', 'opened', 'movie', 'really', 'missed', 'AC/DC', 'music', 'just', 'odd', 'not', 'have', 'AC/DC', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'so', 'well', '.-', 'Tony', 'panic', 'attacks', 'felt', 'place.-', 'someone', 'who', 'certain', 'level', 'realism', 'movies', 'concept', 'Extremis', 'particular', 'fire-breathing', 'was', 'step', 'wrong', 'direction.-', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Mandarin', 'character', 'arc', 'was', 'valid', 'choice', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'well']",N/A

This was an enjoyable movie also and I am not disappointed that I went to see it, but it was certainly not the best of them and is probably the worst of the four (counting the Avengers).There were lots of good things in the movie.  Robert Downey, Jr. continues to prove that the rebirth of his career (after rehab) is not a fluke. I love to watch him act (as both Tony Stark and as Sherlock Holmes). I also loved that Tony Stark suffered from severe PTSD resulting from the Avengers movie.  That was a neat tie-in.  Also, the special effects were as good as always.  I even liked the fact that Pepper Potts became one of the heroes at the end of the movie, but that was too easily foreseeable the moment Killian (Guy Pierce) injected her with the formula and was even more so foreseeable when she fell into the fire.There were, however, just as many disappointing things as well. (SPOILER) Tony gets his chest piece removed?  Really?  I hated that.  I also hated the whole drone army thing with the suits.  Jarvis may be a really good AI, but somehow I doubt he could have controlled all of those suits in battle... too SkyNet for me... perhaps too Deux Ex Machina... and definitely too over the top.  Guy Pierce continued to be a problem for me personally... I just couldn't watch him without thinking of HG Wells and The Time Machine- but maybe that is my personal problem.  Similarly, I just thought the fire breathing aspect of his character was just ridiculous.  It didn't work for me. Finally, there just wasn't enough Iron Man for my taste.  It was supposed to be an Iron Man movie.  Instead, it was a Tony Stark movie with a little Iron Man and a lot of Jarvis thrown in.  Sure, Tony Stark is Iron Man... but if that is the case then make it so.So... in summary... mixed feelings.",3,Mixed Review...

1559456,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B008JFUO72,John Kwok,"[3, 9]","Directed by Shane Black, ""Iron Man Three"" is a worthy sequel in the ongoing Marvel cinematic franchise, and one intelligent enough to raise the question as to whether the character of Iron Man will return in the future, or will he be replaced by the Iron Patriot, the superhero alter ego of Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle). This is a fast-paced, action-packed film that will remain one of the Summer of 2013's biggest hits, not only due to the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s emotionally complex portrayal of playboy billionaire inventor Tony Stark, but also from Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts - who has a lot more screen time in this sequel than in the prior ""Iron Man"" films - and Guy Pearce's diabolical nanotechnology entrepreneur Aldrich Killian, with Ben Kingsley's character stealing almost every scene he appears. Haunted by the recent alien invasion of Earth and the climactic battle in the streets of - and the sky above - New York City (""The Avengers"") Tony Stark opts to confront the mysterious terrorist ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) with disastrous results for himself and Pepper Potts, forcing him to go on a personal manhunt - without relying on his ""Iron Man"" suits for most of the film - for ""The Mandarin"" and Aldrich Killian, whom he encountered - and snubbed - during a 1999 New Year's Eve party in Switzerland. This time Killian is seeking much more than obtaining Stark's financial help in his then start-up nanotechnology firm; he's going after the President of the United States (William Sadler).  Black does a fine job paying homage to Jon Favreau's directing of the two previous ""Iron Man"" films - with Favreau himself returning in a memorable cameo role - but it would be a stretch to say that this is the best ""Iron Man"" film so far. However, as I have noted, it is a worthy sequel and a thrilling action-packed film that should captivate huge audiences for most of this summer.",5,A Rousing Iron Man Sequel that Unveils Tony Stark's Humanity,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1919,"['Directed', 'Shane', 'Black', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Three', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'ongoing', 'Marvel', 'cinematic', 'franchise', 'one', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'raise', 'question', 'character', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'return', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'superhero', 'alter', 'ego', 'Colonel', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'Summer', '2013', 'biggest', 'hits', 'not', 'only', 'due', 'special', 'effects', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'portrayal', 'playboy', 'billionaire', 'inventor', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'also', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'sequel', 'prior', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'diabolical', 'nanotechnology', 'entrepreneur', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'stealing', 'almost', 'scene', 'Haunted', 'recent', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'climactic', 'battle', 'streets', 'sky', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Avengers', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'confront', 'mysterious', 'terrorist', 'Mandarin', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'forcing', 'go', 'personal', 'manhunt', 'relying', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suits', 'most', 'film', 'Mandarin', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'whom', 'encountered', 'snubbed', '1999', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'Switzerland', 'time', 'Killian', 'seeking', 'much', 'more', 'obtaining', 'Stark', 'financial', 'help', 'then', 'start-up', 'nanotechnology', 'firm', 'going', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Black', 'fine', 'job', 'paying', 'homage', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'directing', 'two', 'previous', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'Favreau', 'returning', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'stretch', 'say', 'best', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'However', 'have', 'noted', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'thrilling', 'action-packed', 'film', 'should', 'captivate', 'huge', 'audiences', 'most', 'summer']",N/A

The villain's motivations are an exact duplicate of the Riddler's from the terrible Batman Forever film. In this film the main villain is heartbroken because Tony Stark stood him up for a date and didn't reciprocate his homosexual feelings. It makes very little sense why someone who barely knew Tony would be so hurt by him as to plot for nearly a decade to get his revenge. The failure here is the same as Mickey Rourke's villainous role in Iron Man 2; very little character development as to why they are so motivated to destroy Tony. i understand that Guy Pearce's character is upset because Tony is not homosexual but there has to be more as to why he would want to kill him. Another thing that was terrible was the little kid as a side kick, that was too cliche for me. the best part of the film is when they put tony's fat butler in a colma (his best contribution to the trilogy by far) and when i thought stupid Pepper Potts had died. I was so overwhelmed with joy i stood up out my seat full of happiness seeing stupid Pepper fall into the inferno...only to see her come back from the dead as phoenix from X-Men. Also the plot twist involving the Mandarin was stupid as they get. The whole time you think the guy is a super terrorist and he just turns out to be ""the Dude"" from the Big Lebowski film. Also the fact that the film makers had to change the Mandarin's character because of political correctness is just pathetic. Anyone that perceives the original comic book character as racist is just a sissified over sensitive dim witted wimp. It just comes across as utterly absurd...I mean really, a cowboy Texan sounding Asian Terrorist called the Mandarin?!

Tony Stark is trying to return to his normal life, but the stress of the attack on New York manifests itself in many sleepless nights and quite a few panic attacks. Sure, Tony can tackle problems like how to make his armor more compact and powerful but the problems of the soul are not his forte. He needs help. Being an alpha male, he doesn't really seek it until his back is against the wall.A terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been bombing various places across America and the world, accusing Americans of deceit, arrogance, and greed. The hits finally come too close to home and Tony recklessly demands the Mandarin come fight him. After his posh cliff-side home (and almost everything he has) is destroyed, Tony has to rebuild his life from the ground up.Meanwhile, Stark Industries and Pepper Potts are being courted by a scientific company, A.I.M., headed by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They are working on bio-tech but aren't too ethical about their practices. Killian had tried to get Tony in years before, but he hopes with new leadership at Stark Industries he can woo Pepper into a merger.The story moves at a good pace and is quite interesting. The dialog is fresh and fast. Performances from the cast are good and the action scenes are exciting if not overly imaginative.Fans of the comics might object to the handling of the Mandarin (who is well-played by Ben Kingsley) but I thought it was an interesting take on the character and worked well for the story. The theme it suggests could have been played up more in the film. The end of the film is a little robbed of drama by the more or less invincible bad guys fighting Tony and his army of Iron Man suits (which we saw in the trailer). Other parts of the ending just don't make sense. It's as if they used up the movie's quota of smarts in the first two thirds of the film.All in all, Iron Man 3 is a fun summer action film.

And honestly I immediately had a flashback to how Spider man 3 started off and when I heard Tony Stark narrate I was worried. I gave Iron Man 3 a chance and while I would not call the movie itself a waste of time or complete garbage, It was a little disappointing. Yes this will be one of my first bad reviews unfortunately. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle, return and I think they all did a great job portraying Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey. Now on to the new additions: we have Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, and Ben Kingsley as Mandarin. They all did good in the movie. And with such a big cast you may be wondering why Iron Man 3 is getting so much criticism? Well here it goes.I am not the biggest Iron Man fan, but the problem with Iron Man 3 is that the cons outweigh the FEW pros it has. Starting with the much talked about ""twist"". God I really hated the twist in Iron Man 3. It was really childish, surprising, entirely unecessary, and just plain wrong. It just made the movie a lot worse. Another problem:IRON MAN was not in the movie enough. Sure Tony Stark's presence is Constant; but this is a SUPERHERO movie. The script was also rather...lazy in some aspect. The movie has its moments, but ultimately it just doesnt have that WOW factor that we are so used to with Marvel movies. Now on to some pros.Say what you want, but Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry. And it does show in Iron Man 3. Which takes me to my next statement: despite the flaws that are present in this movie, Iron Man 3 is more serious and SOMEWHAT more thrilling than Iron Man 2. And finally, I am glad this movie was not any longer than what it was because it could have been a even BIGGER mistake for the movie. It should come as no surprise that I myself will be in NO rush to buy this when it comes out on dvd. I think the question that is on everyone's mind is: do we need/want an Iron Man 4? Sure but please bring the WOW factor and make a better movie the next time around.Seriously.Iron Man 3 is no 5 star movie, and it is not even a 4 star movie strangely enough. But in my opinion Iron Man 3, whether you love it or hate it, gets:3 stars",3,Iron Man 3?,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2349,"['am', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'where', 'begin', 'review', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'unusually', 'favorite', 'hero', 'Tony', 'Stark/Iron', 'Man', 'narrating', 'film', 'honestly', 'immediately', 'had', 'flashback', 'how', 'Spider', 'man', '3', 'started', 'off', 'when', 'heard', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'narrate', 'was', 'worried', 'gave', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'chance', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'complete', 'garbage', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'Yes', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'bad', 'reviews', 'unfortunately', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'return', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Tony', 'Pepper', 'Rhodey', 'Now', 'new', 'additions', 'have', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Maya', 'Hansen', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Mandarin', 'did', 'good', 'movie', 'big', 'cast', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'criticism', 'Well', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fan', 'problem', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'cons', 'outweigh', 'FEW', 'pros', 'Starting', 'much', 'talked', 'twist', 'God', 'really', 'hated', 'twist', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'was', 'really', 'childish', 'surprising', 'entirely', 'unecessary', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'lot', 'worse', 'problem', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'enough', 'Sure', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'presence', 'Constant', 'SUPERHERO', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'lazy', 'aspect', 'movie', 'moments', 'ultimately', 'just', 'doesnt', 'have', 'WOW', 'factor', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'Now', 'pros.Say', 'what', 'want', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'show', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Which', 'next', 'statement', 'flaws', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'more', 'serious', 'SOMEWHAT', 'more', 'thrilling', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'finally', 'am', 'glad', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'longer', 'what', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'BIGGER', 'mistake', 'movie', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'myself', 'will', 'be', 'rush', 'buy', 'when', 'out', 'dvd', 'think', 'question', 'everyone', 'mind', 'do', 'need/want', 'Iron', 'Man', '4', 'Sure', 'please', 'bring', 'WOW', 'factor', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'around.Seriously.Iron', 'Man', '3', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'not', 'even', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'strangely', 'enough', 'opinion', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'love', 'hate', 'stars']",N/A

1559480,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008JFUO72,J. Richardson,"[39, 60]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Coming off of last year's crossover film, Marvel's The Avengers, Iron Man 3 sets the stage for Phase 2 of this generation's Marvel films. It's been three years since fans have received the lukewarm Iron Man 2 and the third entry in the series attempts to right its predecessors wrongs. The end result is one with a lot of passion, but also one filled with many mistakes.The story is more emotionally driven this time around as we follow a troubled Tony Stark trying to cope during the aftermath of the events in New York. He can't sleep and when he does his dreams are filled with nightmares. To help keep his mind off of things he's constantly recreating new models of his suit. He keeps telling Pepper that it's a hobby, but it's pretty clear that this is nothing more than a distraction and, to some degree, an obsession.After the more lighthearted execution of The Avengers film, this darker story might not fare well with the younger audience, but fear not, Iron Man 3 is not without its laughs. Even though Tony is a bit troubled this time around, he's still Tony. So you can still expect his snarky, sarcastic humor. While I found most of the jokes to be fairly entertaining, there were some bits that felt slightly corny and a little bit unnecessary. A good example would be in the beginning as Tony is trying on a new suit. It'll get laughs from the younger crowd, but I couldn't muster more than an awkward sigh.Overall I found the story enjoyable and I thought the more emotional side of Tony was a nice break from the usual stuff we've received thus far. With that said, some of the scenes in here are extremely cliched and formulaic. What's that? Iron Man fell in the ocean? Oh, how about we get him stuck beneath a metal rod as a huge chunk of cement comes crashing down above him. I'm sorry, what was that? Tony ignores an eager young scientist over a decade ago and he's out to seek revenge? Who would've seen that coming?While the story in this entry is much more enjoyable than the one present in Iron Man 2, this third installment suffers from the same fate as its origin story: the lack of an interesting villain. Technically this film has two villains. Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) are the antagonists this time around and they're about as interesting as a sack of potatoes. Killian's character is your recycled fanboy who seeks revenge on the evil idol who payed him no attention and The Mandarin is just a joke. In the comics The Mandarin is a serious force to be reckoned with, but here? He's nothing more than a feeble attempt at gaining some laughs from the crowd.One of the things I found most odd about Iron Man 3 was, surprisingly, the lack of Iron Man. Now Tony's in a good 85-90% of the scenes in this film, but Iron Man? It felt like he got put on the back burner appearing in maybe 25% of the scenes. I think they tried to hold off in anticipation for the big finale, but it just wasn't the same as seeing Tony flying around in the suit. There's a lot of down time where the suit he's with just isn't functioning properly (at the worst possible times of course), adding another layer of cliche to the story.Finally, as expected, the cast in here is pretty great. Robery Downey, Jr. came through with another fantastic performance as Tony and Gwyneth Paltrow might have given her best performance of this series getting a lot more screen time and having a bigger role in the story. Don Cheadle finally found his groove as Rhodey, giving a much more enjoyable performance than the uncomfortable effort in Iron Man 2. Guy Pearce did a great job as Killian and Ty Simpkins was a nice touch as the young Harley who assists the troubled Tony Stark.Overall Score: 7/10 - If you can't tell already I'm about as neutral as neutral can get. The writing for Tony's little side story is very well done, but the main story with these two villains is pretty sub-par. The lead performances from Downey and Paltrow were excellent, but the lack of screen time for Iron Man wasn't. The action was intense, but cliched at times. In short, it was an Iron Man film. We have yet to receive an entry to this series that has been mind blowing, but what makes these so enjoyable is the fact that Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. He is Tony Stark. There's no denying that he was made for this role and I think that's why I keep coming back. If you're looking for a good popcorn flick with a touch of heart then I would say see this. Because as flawed as it is, it's a nice ride.",4,7/10 - It's ok,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,4565,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Coming', 'last', 'year', 'crossover', 'film', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'stage', 'Phase', '2', 'generation', 'Marvel', 'films', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'fans', 'have', 'received', 'lukewarm', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'third', 'entry', 'series', 'attempts', 'right', 'predecessors', 'wrongs', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'lot', 'passion', 'also', 'one', 'filled', 'many', 'mistakes.The', 'story', 'more', 'emotionally', 'driven', 'time', 'around', 'follow', 'troubled', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'trying', 'cope', 'aftermath', 'events', 'New', 'York', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'when', 'dreams', 'are', 'filled', 'nightmares', 'help', 'keep', 'mind', 'things', 'constantly', 'recreating', 'new', 'models', 'suit', 'telling', 'Pepper', 'hobby', 'pretty', 'clear', 'nothing', 'more', 'distraction', 'degree', 'obsession.After', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'execution', 'Avengers', 'film', 'darker', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'younger', 'audience', 'fear', 'not', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'not', 'laughs', 'Even', 'Tony', 'bit', 'troubled', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'Tony', 'can', 'still', 'expect', 'snarky', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'found', 'most', 'jokes', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'were', 'bits', 'felt', 'slightly', 'corny', 'little', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'beginning', 'Tony', 'trying', 'new', 'suit', ""'ll"", 'get', 'laughs', 'younger', 'crowd', 'could', ""n't"", 'muster', 'more', 'awkward', 'sigh.Overall', 'found', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'more', 'emotional', 'side', 'Tony', 'was', 'nice', 'break', 'usual', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'received', 'thus', 'far', 'said', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'extremely', 'cliched', 'formulaic', 'What', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fell', 'ocean', 'Oh', 'how', 'get', 'stuck', 'beneath', 'metal', 'rod', 'huge', 'chunk', 'cement', 'crashing', 'down', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'what', 'was', 'Tony', 'eager', 'young', 'scientist', 'decade', 'ago', 'out', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'coming', 'story', 'entry', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'present', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'third', 'installment', 'suffers', 'same', 'fate', 'origin', 'story', 'lack', 'interesting', 'villain', 'Technically', 'film', 'two', 'villains', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Mandarin', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'are', 'antagonists', 'time', 'around', ""'re"", 'as', 'interesting', 'sack', 'potatoes', 'Killian', 'character', 'recycled', 'fanboy', 'who', 'revenge', 'evil', 'idol', 'who', 'payed', 'attention', 'Mandarin', 'just', 'joke', 'comics', 'Mandarin', 'serious', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'here', 'nothing', 'more', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'gaining', 'laughs', 'crowd.One', 'things', 'found', 'most', 'odd', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'lack', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Now', 'Tony', 'good', '85-90', '%', 'scenes', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'felt', 'got', 'put', 'back', 'burner', 'appearing', 'maybe', '25', '%', 'scenes', 'think', 'tried', 'hold', 'off', 'anticipation', 'big', 'finale', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'seeing', 'Tony', 'flying', 'around', 'suit', 'lot', 'down', 'time', 'where', 'suit', 'just', ""n't"", 'functioning', 'properly', 'worst', 'possible', 'times', 'course', 'adding', 'layer', 'cliche', 'story.Finally', 'expected', 'cast', 'here', 'pretty', 'great', 'Robery', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'came', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Tony', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'best', 'performance', 'series', 'getting', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'having', 'bigger', 'role', 'story', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'finally', 'found', 'groove', 'Rhodey', 'giving', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'uncomfortable', 'effort', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Killian', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'young', 'Harley', 'who', 'troubled', 'Tony', 'Stark.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'already', ""'m"", 'as', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'can', 'get', 'writing', 'Tony', 'little', 'side', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'story', 'two', 'villains', 'pretty', 'sub-par', 'lead', 'performances', 'Downey', 'Paltrow', 'were', 'excellent', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'was', 'intense', 'cliched', 'times', 'short', 'was', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'have', 'yet', 'receive', 'entry', 'series', 'been', 'mind', 'blowing', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'denying', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'think', 'why', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'touch', 'heart', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'see', 'as', 'flawed', 'nice', 'ride']",N/A

If this was the first movie of the 3 Iron Man's, it would have also been THE LAST.  Let me emphasize:Here we have a superhero with astonishing mental and emotional characteristics, which was actually established in the first movie (thanks to Robert's excellent acting). What sets IronMan apart from other superheros is his mortality; without his suit, Tony Stark is just a blood and flesh human being, that is capable of dying of cancer or developing alcohol addiction (as seen in Iron Man 2).  In this movie, Tony Stark displays PTSD, which really added to the character's depth, yet did not seem to fit within the general tone of the movie. Robert's acting was mediocre at best and really seemed out of place with the Disney World tone of this movie.What a clich&eacute;...(Spoiler alert)Tony Stark decides to give up all his incredible abilities and care for society for some bimbo named Pepper. What a bad bad ending... How many times have we seen a Super hero give up his powers (Ex. Superman 2) to live a domestic boring life with some aging woman?  Towards the end of the movie, Tony decides to blow up something like 100 Iron Man Suits, to start a ""New Slate"".  Oh PLEASE, ""let me create 100 ten billion dollars suits, so I can blow them up in a 'beautiful' firework display to impress my boring girlfriend.""  One of many major stinker scenes in this movie.The Villains:Ok, this is the most ridiculous villains I've ever seen.  You have normal people turned into fire breathing red devils, by some magical serum.  Dumb, dumb, dumb..  Is that the best the writers could come up with? What is amusingly idiotic, is that if the bad guys get ""too hot"" they explode like mini atomic bombs. (Spoiler alert) Having the Mandarin turn out to be a Ex-homeless British theater actor was actually kind of humorous, but may not sit well with many avid fans of marvel comic movies.If this movie had left out the cliche ending, dumb villains, bad acting, annoying characters, and Tony's lard butt bodyguard it may have been a decent.. oh wait, that pretty much is everything. (smirk)On the positive side, this movie had a couple of entertaining action scenes, but hardly made up for the rest of this Iron Man tragedy.",2,Disappointing clich&eacute;,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2400,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'sequel.This', 'movie', 'originality', 'solid', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'first', 'movie', '3', 'Iron', 'Man', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'THE', 'LAST', 'Let', 'emphasize', 'Here', 'have', 'superhero', 'astonishing', 'mental', 'emotional', 'characteristics', 'was', 'actually', 'established', 'first', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Robert', 'excellent', 'acting', 'What', 'IronMan', 'apart', 'other', 'superheros', 'mortality', 'suit', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'just', 'blood', 'flesh', 'human', 'being', 'capable', 'dying', 'cancer', 'developing', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'seen', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'PTSD', 'really', 'added', 'character', 'depth', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'general', 'tone', 'movie', 'Robert', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'really', 'seemed', 'place', 'Disney', 'World', 'tone', 'movie.What', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'give', 'up', 'incredible', 'abilities', 'care', 'society', 'bimbo', 'named', 'Pepper', 'What', 'bad', 'bad', 'ending', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'Super', 'hero', 'give', 'up', 'powers', 'Ex', 'Superman', '2', 'live', 'domestic', 'boring', 'life', 'aging', 'woman', 'end', 'movie', 'Tony', 'blow', 'up', 'something', '100', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Suits', 'start', 'New', 'Slate', 'Oh', 'PLEASE', 'let', 'create', '100', 'ten', 'billion', 'dollars', 'suits', 'can', 'blow', 'up', ""'beautiful"", 'firework', 'display', 'impress', 'boring', 'girlfriend', 'One', 'many', 'major', 'stinker', 'scenes', 'movie.The', 'Ok', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'normal', 'people', 'turned', 'fire', 'breathing', 'red', 'devils', 'magical', 'serum', 'Dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb..', 'best', 'writers', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'What', 'amusingly', 'idiotic', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'too', 'hot', 'explode', 'mini', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Having', 'Mandarin', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Ex-homeless', 'British', 'theater', 'actor', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'humorous', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'many', 'avid', 'fans', 'marvel', 'comic', 'movies.If', 'movie', 'had', 'left', 'out', 'cliche', 'ending', 'dumb', 'villains', 'bad', 'acting', 'annoying', 'characters', 'Tony', 'lard', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'decent..', 'oh', 'wait', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'smirk', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'had', 'couple', 'entertaining', 'action', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'made', 'up', 'rest', 'Iron', 'Man', 'tragedy']",N/A

While the movie has a lot of good features to boast about, it's ultimately an unsatisfying ending.Ironman 3 finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) an emotional wreck, reeling from the events that transpired in the Avengers movie. But Stark's past is about to catch up with him in the form of Alldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who has a idea for DNA regeneration that Stark had rebuffed years earlier. The threat to Stark is doubled when the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) appears inducing terrorist attacks across the U.S. To complicate it all is Stark/Ironman's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).Some of the problems begin with the introduction of Aldrich Killian, it seems his plan to take over the United States is remarkably similar to the one Jim Carrey's The Riddler has in Batman Forever. As a matter, of fact Pearce's first appearance and portrayal of Killian is similar to Carrey's portrayal of Edward Nygma, and later Pearce seems to be aping Val Kilmer! Then there's the dependence on the Avengers movie, as a stand-alone movie Ironman 3 is much too dependent on the Avengers movie and the assumption that an Ironman 3 audience would have seen the Avengers. I didn`t, and it left a considerable hole in the story. Then, there's the Ironman suit featured in most of the movie. It seems to have no other practical purpose except the function it will have in the conclusion, that is telegraphed almost from the first. Finally, there's the unfortunate inclusion of the Iron Patriot, Don Cheadle in the role of Colonel James Rhodes who is now the U.S. government's enforcer. But at critical moments in the action, Rhodes doesn't seem to know how to operate the armor.That isn't to say the acting isn't good. Everyone in movie turns in a strong performance. Robert Downey is reliably good as Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow has finally been given something to do in an Ironman movie besides scream and react to Downey's Stark. Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin takes the character from a truly menacing character to parody (it's purposeful) and is believable in the almost dual role. Even for the drawbacks I've mentioned before, Guy Pearce's performance is strong and he's believable in the part.If you're an Ironman fan you're going to see the movie. If you're on the fence, maybe wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray (and the extras it's sure to carry!), or temper your expectations.

It can't go into the new suit because it is just a prototype, the old suits just don't have the same general kick as the Mach series and don't even get me started on the Iron Patriot or the apparently uselessness of Don Cheadle as Rhodes. Sadly no-one seems to care at all, I honestly got more of a kick out of watching the Thor 2 preview that preceded the movie rather than being able to really embrace this and for Marvel to let this slide, well there are no excuses except to say that they've used their 'we just needed to cut paychecks' card.",2,The Great Hope & Hype of a Dark Turnaround,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1041,"['premise', 'trailer', 'false', 'advertising', 'Putting', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'begin', 'second', 'was', 'infinitely', 'more', 'plausible', 'darker', 'first', 'problem', 'third', 'entry', 'refuse', 'go', 'darker', 'Mandarin', 'Joker', 'almost', 'find', 'rooting', 'villains', 'hoping', 'Stark', 'will', 'be', 'commission', 'action', 'decent', 'mad', 'genius', 'brilliance', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'nowhere', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'new', 'suit', 'just', 'prototype', 'old', 'suits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'general', 'kick', 'Mach', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'apparently', 'uselessness', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Rhodes', 'Sadly', 'no-one', 'care', 'honestly', 'got', 'more', 'kick', 'watching', 'Thor', '2', 'preview', 'preceded', 'movie', 'rather', 'being', 'able', 'really', 'embrace', 'Marvel', 'let', 'slide', 'well', 'are', 'excuses', 'say', ""'ve"", 'used', ""'we"", 'just', 'needed', 'cut', 'paychecks', 'card']",N/A

There are a good performances by Ben Kingsley who, as the Mandarin, is not exactly what he appears and (SPOILER!) Guy Pearce, who literally burns up the scenery as this movie's Arch-Villian.

Then the movie was like taking a bite of the apple and finding out it is just sawdust covered in wax.I imagine this would be my conversation with the writers/director/whoever:Wouldn't it be great to see Tony Stark suffering serious post-traumatic stress?My answer is No.How about seeing a constantly malfunctioning prototype Iron Man armor?Nope. That would be a terrible idea.Well, we can have Col. James Rhodes as Iron-War-Patriot-Machine, who gets to do next to nothing.NO, I tells ya!Did I mention that Iron Man's armor constantly falls apart?You have not mentioned that yet, but I NEVER want to see that happen in any Iron Man movie.Um, alright, we'll have The Mandarin in the movie (Great!), he'll be played by Ben Kingsley (Excellent!), he will be of indeterminate nationality (I like it!) BUT . . . it turns out it is a cheap and embarrassing trick where he ends up being just a goofball actor (wrong, wrong and WRONG! Horrible idea!).OK, OK. Well, we'll use the Extremis Virus (that could work) to make people into super-heated, fire-breathing, exploding beasties that can tear Iron Man's 42 different types of armor (wait, what?) into pieces (NO!)Tony will run around wearing just PARTS of his armor, stumbling and bumbling his way around until flaming Pepper (whazza!?) rises from the fire to save him! (Now you've completely lost me. And I am a lifelong fan of comics and superheroes.)Then I would say, ""Well, thank heaven we had this conversation and I stopped Marvel from making a mind-bendingly horrible Iron Man movie."" Wait a minute. They MADE that movie?!! It earned over 1 billion bucks?! But its horrible! Its idiotic! Its . . . And then my nose starts bleeding again and I have to just give up.Anyway, thanks for allowing that rant. I did think this film was just FULL of terrible ideas that ruined it for me. However, the scene where Iron Man saves the people falling from Air Force One is excellent. I loved the special feature about the sky-divers that pulled it off. Those people were absolutely awesome. (Then the director blew it in the movie by having Tony NOT be in the armor and then having him crash it like an idiot into an oncoming truck where his armor (of course) FALLS APART!On a positive note, the Agent Carter short-film was PERFECT. WAY better than IM3. And the kid who works with Tony is NOT annoying and gives a really good performance.You know, I loved the trailer for Iron Man 3, then I felt completely cheated by the movie. I also LOVE the trailers for Thor 2 and Captain America 2. I pray I don't get cheated on THOSE two.

Marvel movies seem to be much lighter in tone, and DC can have lighter instances, but the drama portrayed is darker yet the balance between the two are sufficient. That leads me to ask: why introduce The Mandarin, who clearly presented a real problem for Tony Spark/Iron Man in the comics due to the Ten Rings, who has a ruthless nature, as an idiot?! Borrowing from Iron Man: Extremis, the series written by Warren Ellis and drawn by Adi Granov, these issues were nothing but dark, but obviously there was not enough material for the big screen. That should not have warranted The Mandarin's portrayal being so drastically changed because it just did not work. And introducing Extremis to inflict both its maker & Pepper Potts, again, it was a stretch. Stark had to use Extremis in order to save his life after being punished by Mallen, and having altered it, in the comics, he was able to store the undersuit for his armor in the hollow of his bones, and control his armor with thought. A+ story made into a B rate movie, maybe even a grade lower. Marvel missed the mark with this one, and while you may see what it is about, it's better as a rental. This way, you will not feel gypped.

1559526,A3UXQLM9I775JJ,B008JFUO72,"Kristofer Sandlund ""The Storyteller""","[6, 10]","Good movie. Could have been great. Those of us who have grown up on Marvel understand the wisdom of Stan Lee when he stated,  ""Spider-Man is, and always has been, at the center of the Marvel Universe, but it's success does not come from Spider-Man; rather, this is truly the story of Peter Parker... Peter is the foundation and the very heart of Marvel"" (Paraphrased). I believe this truth is understood by many, but is sometimes overlooked by the movie industry. Certainly, I believe Christopher Nolan nailed it with the Batman trilogy. Remember how long it took to develop characters, and not just the headliners. Each character had time devoted to them, including the thugs, the detectives, the mayor etc. This is not an easy task, and with precious screen time, directors have to edit and cut portions they devoted great resources to. Still, Nolan both ""got it"" and even better, he ""did it"". The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made, and should be a required course for up and coming directors. The true depth of the movie is not from special effects- it comes from character development, which of course requires great acting and a genius script. (Bullseye on both!)...Despite the mistakes of Iron-Man 2, this third offering had several great opportunities to do the same, but ultimately blew it. Here are two riveting character developments- character maturing themes:... 1. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts love for one another. It grew throughout 1 and 2, but was not given enough time nor ""heart"" in 3. Simply put- they didn't slow down the action and let them interact so that we could get to know them as a couple. Compare and contrast this with Peter and Mary Jane in Spidey 1 and 2. GREAT MOVIES, with deep, interesting, and even ""real"" issues that ALL couples face. They grew to know one another, but Sam Rami knew this would take time, and he indeed gave them plenty of screen time to do this: to tease each other, to cry, to misunderstand, to laugh, to sorrow, and ultimately, to grow individually and together! (Read Ecclesiastes- ""there is a season..."") Think about how many ""un-rushed"" wonderful scenes Sam devoted to them: behind their homes after MJ's father demeans his daughter; their frequent ""coincidental"" encounters- yes I know he was in costume, but you felt the heart of Peter and MJ at all times; the encounter in the cafe, interrupted by a car thrown through the window- NOTE, WHAT REALLY MADE THAT SCENE SO WONDERFUL? (Hint- it wasn't the car nor the 8 limbed villain!) Great script- great acting!...2. Tony Starks anxiety- his post traumatic stress. Yes- it's a wonderful opportunity to understand Tony Stark... not Iron-Man. Once again, the concept was great, but the scenes felt rushed. I never felt his anxiety, and a great film maker could have done that to me. (More slower... flashbacks?)....For me, these two great story lines, his loving relationship with Pepper and his severe anxiety condition are a ""match made in heaven""- they are absolutely perfect for each other. Yes, they got it right in concept, but didn't take the screen time to slow down and let this wash over us. I struggle with anxiety, and I only make it some days because of the wonderful woman in my life- my wife of 33 years. Put another way- why did we not see them together more. Guys, you should have given us more of that, and junk 80% of the ""Iron-Man remotes"" at the end. The climax was kind of silly- we were looking for something richer- more endearing.... more human. less robotic... something that wouldn't ""rust"" like iron....SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ WHAT FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE MOVIE. One last opinion: The ""twist"" regarding the Mandarin was brilliant. I never saw it coming!

Not because all the material it presents is essentially puke-worthy, but because it hurtles through all that material way, way too fast. It whooshes its audience along at breakneck speed, slowing as it climbs a hill just long enough for us to ask ""How the heck did we get here?"", then plummeting down the other side before we can arrive at any answer to the question.The Mandarin. Killian. Tony's wormhole-related PTSD. Pepper. Extremis. After spending two-plus hours watching this movie, I felt like each of those subplots had flashed across the screen for about five seconds. And, taking a breather to analyze how they were used, I found myself decidedly unimpressed. I'm not exactly an avid reader of Iron Man comics, but I can see from some simple Wikipedia research that all these concepts lost quite a bit in translation - Extremis in particular. No longer a complex and intriguing method of producing super-soldiers, it now seems to only be capable of turning people into glowing lava monsters. The brief and boring explanation of how it works is an insult to viewers' intelligence. So are a lot of other things about the film - the final resolution in particular. Deus ex machina, anyone?I won't spoil the major twists here, though I wouldn't be robbing you of any great dramatic highs if I did. My main advice regarding this movie is rent, don't buy. There are some character moments and blips of humor that make it watchable. You may like it better than I did, but definitely don't expect anything along the lines of the first Iron Man, or even anything much better than the second.(Of course, if you want the DVD for the Agent Carter one-shot, that's a different story. I've heard it's excellent, though it didn't come with my digital rental, so I haven't seen it myself yet.

Shane Black loves a bit of narration and has different taste in music than Jon Favreau.  (I missed the classic rock.)  But there doesn't seem to be any animosity in the changeover.  In fact, Favreau's role as bodyguard Happy Hogan was expanded.But perhaps the biggest change in Iron Man 3 is that it's not all about Tony Stark.  (Although, in the end, it is.)Much like Favreau, Don Cheadle gets a bigger part to play.  I'm am fully in favor of that, because Cheadle is terrific as Colonel Rhodes.  He's a good guy, but not a boring one.  And when given more screen time, Cheadle imbues Rhodey with enough of a sense of fun that you believe he and Tony Stark could be best friends.And speaking of cast chemistry, Gwynth Paltrow continues to have tons with Robert Downey, Jr.  Her Pepper Potts is competent, compassionate, forgiving, but not a pushover.  She's firm and has zero time for b.s. from her boyfriend or monologuing villains.  I don't care how you feel about Paltrow; I can't imagine anyone else in the role.Same goes for RDJ, who really plays up Tony's vulnerability after sacrificing himself in The Avengers.  He's faced tough situations before, but deliberately choosing to die really did a number on his psyche.  It leads to some great scenes when Tony teams up with a kid who can't keep his mouth shut around a real live superhero.Of course, summer blockbusters and superhero films are all about the big fight scenes.  Iron Man 3 lives up to any expectations I had on that count.  The final battle is kinetic and visually delightful and still allows for some nice character beats.  I would've left the theater with a smile on my face even if the falling action wasn't just as terrific.Iron Man fans, don't miss this one.

1559559,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B008JFUO72,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[3, 7]","Director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) took a screenplay by Drew Pearce (No Heroics, Pacific Rim) and himself and made a fun romp of an adventure in this third film of the Iron Man franchise. It comes complete with a simple premise but a few plot twists that will definitely surprise you in the beginning, middle and the end.Most of this incredibly fun adventure is due to the magnetically charged personality that is Robert Downey, Jr. (Sherlock Holmes, Due Date) as Stony Stark. He is the genius billionaire with the alter ego known as Iron Man who seems to do things under his own agenda, whether anyone likes it or not. His relentless deliveries of sarcasm, wit and humor toward almost everything about himself, his enemies and even his girlfriend, is nothing short of pure delight to watch.Yes there is plenty of action sequences, flying sequences and some pretty impressive special effect sequences, but the heart of this film is his dedication and love for Miss Pepper Pots played even more dynamically this time around by Gwyneth Paltrow (Seven, Contagion). The two of them on screen is nothing but a pure delight of electricity and passion to watch. And, Gwyneth is much more than his pretty `Girl Friday' in this film. Without saying much, she actually gets to wear one of the suits herself - what she does with it - look out!Now without revealing too much, Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List), plays an astonishing role that will literally leave you in a state of shock, as the key villain, or so we think, as he has something unusually strange about himself that is later revealed. Ben does an amazing job in this weird and yet offbeat character he was given to play.Don Cheadle (Crash, Hotel Rowanda) reprises his role as the `patriotic' vversion Iron man with a small chip on his shoulder. Scratch that, a large chip on his shoulder.  In this film he realizes the importance of what Tony Stark is doing and learns that everything is not always as it appears to be, especially in the face of danger.Now throw in a second villain, played artistically evil by Guy Pearce (Momento, The Hurt Locker) and you have a sadistically cruel and vengeful character driven film that literally will keep you guessing all the way to the end. This film sees tons more action and definitely more defined characters than in the second film of the franchise, which was my least favorite of the three.The movie is fast paced and heart-pounding with movement and incredible stunts and effect sequences. The artistry of cinematography and visual effects combined make it almost hard to believe we are not watching it as it `really' happens. Composer Brian Tyler (Eagle Eye, Middle Men) does an amazing score to compliment the entire film with orchestral strides of passion and action combined to make you hum some of the underscore.I personally feel the first Iron Man, although an origin story, still had more depth of story and character development and therefore still making it the best of the three for me.

1559564,A3INANJEZZL8ED,B008JFUO72,"Luke Skywalker ""feilog""","[2, 4]","Let me first go on record saying that I loved the first two ""Iron Man"" films.  The first one followed the origin story pretty closely, and it was fantastic to have an original Iron Man villain in the second film (Whiplash).  I love Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, and I so hoped that the third installment in the Iron Man franchise would ""knock it out of the park"".  Wow was I sorely disappointed, as this movie is woefully sub par.  This film feels nothing like the first two.Tony Stark is a genius whose inventions are the envy of the Government, and his competitors (such as Hammer industries).  Someone please explain to me why none of his stuff seemed to work in this film??!!!!  In the first film he was shot out of the sky by a tank, and a jet, was run over, punched through a bus, and endured an emp pulse.  In the second film, his suit was electrocuted twice, bashed a bunch of time by another Iron Man suit, and was shot repeatedly by more than a few Hammer Drones.  In the Avengers, his suit was dragged smashed and scraped through one of the engines on the shield helicarrier, swallowed by a flying alien lizards, and even endured the cold vacuum of space.  Yet in this film, the Iron Man suit seems to fall apart at the drop of a hat.  Tony Stark has gone from being a genius, to being a hack whose equipment won't stop malfunctioning.  Why???!!!What idiot decided that it would be a great idea to make the most iconic Iron Man villain a joke??!!!  The Mandarin is to Iron Man, what the Joker is to Batman.  The Mandarin is the ultimate Iron Man villain, and they turned him into a pathetic punchline!  Fans, true Iron Man fans, had been waiting to finally see the incarnation of the Mandarin on the big screen, and this is what we get??!!  Why???!!!!!Like Superman 3, Superman 4, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Ghostrider 2 Spirit of Vengance, X3 The Last Stand, and The Wolverine, Iron Man 3 takes its place as yet another comic book movie failure, and just needs to disappear.",1,Why God Why??!!!!!!

I loved it and, even more important (and quite incredible in fact), my wife liked it even MORE! Below you will find more of my impressions. This review in principle is FREE OF SPOILERS.&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; is a merry, cheerful adventure, very fast paced, with excellent fighting scenes, but mostly relying on humor and excellent dialogs, full of typicall Tony Stark's jokes, half acid, half bitter but always pretty funny. The story is mostly about Tony's past coming back to kick him in the butt with the maximum speed and strength, forcing him to visit places even more exotic than the wormhole in &#34;Avengers&#34;, like deep ocean and rural Tennessee - and no more will be said. There are some darker moments, but general mood of this film is light - this is an amusement ride, not the voyage to the heart of the darkness.Robert Downey Jr offers here to his public a spotless, brilliant performance, even better than in previous parts and &#34;Avengers&#34; - and honestly, I think here he is even better (funnier) than in his &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; franchise.Gwyneth Paltrow is a very, very beautiful woman - but in this film she is much more than that. She is HOT, she is smoking hot, she is burning hot, she is lava hot, she literally bursts in flames so hot she is, in fact she is so hot that by moments she outshines the principal hero...))) No, for real, it is not an exaggeration - I will even hasard an opinion that in this film she reaches the degree of hotness never before attained by any other Hollywood actress...)))Guy Pearce does well in this film. The character of Tony Stark's loyal bodyguard named Happy plays an important role. There are also some more hot bad guys and girls involved.Dora the Explorer makes a short but remarkable appearance in her debut on the big screen - but nothing more will be said. And no, this is not a joke!But it is Ben Kingsley, who plays the &#34;Mandarin&#34; who completely steals the show once we arrive to his evil den, which is a place of vile infamy, maleficent plots, decadent delights and rotten corruption so infamous on so many levels that it defies imagination! Believe me, in whole history of cinematographic villains, you have never seen a place so abominably unique as the horrifying hostile heretic hideous hidden hideout of &#34;Mandarin&#34;! And the lord and master of this place matches it in infect depravation!Very exceptionally for a Hollywood super blockbuster, this film is not offensive to French or Muslims. No, really. I am serious.As I already stated above, this film is so good, that my wife, who usually is not at all into comic books and/or superheroes almost died laughing and she actually thanked me for taking her to see it (and that doesn't happen often!). Therefore I recommend it without hesitation for a viewing with your wife or girlfriend - this should be a very pleasant common experience.I will say nothing more here. Go see it in the cinema as long as it still plays - and me, I think I will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it is available!

I'd like to know what you think I'm doing wrong in order to improve.  Remember, the voting system for reviews here is not a ""I agree/I disagree"" thing.  It's a ""I find this helpful/I don't find this helpful"" thing.Iron Man 3 follows on the heels of both previous films Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.  A direct sequel to both films, this is a movie that will please fans of the film franchise but will most likely anger fans of the comic book.A little history, before the analysis, if you can bear with me.  Prior to the release of the first film, Iron Man wasn't a particularly known character outside of comic book reader groups, and even inside it was usually considered a B-lister at best.  This all changed after the release of the first movie, at which point Iron Man's popularity skyrocketed as if propelled by his famous repulsor tech.  The character became more important in real life and inside Marvel's comic universe and all its iterations.  Before all this, some non-comic readers knew about the character due to1994's Iron Man Animated Series, in which his most prominent foe was the one considered his nemesis in the comics: The Mandarin.The Mandarin, who was a powerful sorcerer in the comics and animated series, had been teased in the previous two films in the franchise, and he finally makes an appereance here, re-imagined as a powerful terrorist leader.  The plot of the film focuses on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as he copes with post traumatic effects after the events on The Avengers, while also having to deal with both the threat of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the sudden re-appereance of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce), a man who wants to use Stark's resources to improve the human body beyond its capabilities but actually holds a grudge against Tony due to a past experience and doesn't reveal the true capabilities of his formula, codenamed ""Extremis"".  In the meantime, girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) also has to deal with Killian, who used to be interested in her, and friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly known as War Machine has had his armor outfitted with a new paint job and re-named Iron Patriot in order to instill a sense of security on the population in a time of terrorist threats and the aftermath of an alien attack.Director Shane Black does a fantastic job with this movie.  Keeping with the tradition of the franchise of humor, cool tech and great action scenes (of which there's no shortage this time around), he tells a tale that advances the story and its characters without compromising the action.  Iron Man's new control-remote armor (which brings memories of Duck Tales' Gizmo Duck) is ridiculously cool.  The new biologically-altered foes pack a punch and are very visually appealing.  A scene with dozens of different Iron Man armors is fantastic and offers some great references to both the comics and the animated series.  As an aside, Iron Man finally gets a theme!  It's a great heroic piece, and I recommend you get themovie's Soundtrackjust for it.In the cerebral side of the story, we get to see a pretty hilarious buddy-cop relationship between Tony and a kid, Tony's realization that his past self has brought him more trouble than he could have imagined and his new self has trouble adjusting to a life of responsibility.  RDJ is as great as ever, of course.  Don Cheadle finally finds his footing in the interpretation of James Rhodes, and does a fantastic job.  Guy Pierce's Killian is not a terribly interesting character to begin with, and his story echoes too much The Riddler's from Batman Forever (this analogy is one of the first things that gets noticed the moment the guy shows up on screen at the beginning of the film, though, of course, this character has a more serious tone), but he knows how to be menacing and does bring some terrifyingly realistic villain moments.And then there's the Mandarin.  And here is where the fanbase divides.  Fans of the film who didn't have previous knowledge from the character will have no problem with him.  Fans of the comics are likely to be mad to the point of hating the entire film for it.  I'm trying to be objective, so while I recognize this is a spectacular film, as a comic book fan I find what they did with the Mandarin unforgivable.  You see, I was a fan of the comic since I have memory.  The very first comic book I ever read over 25 years ago was an Iron Man issue in which he faced the Mandarin.  I was fascinated since then and I was excited for his appereance since the release of the first film.  After watching him here I suffered one of the greatest dissapointments in entertainment in my entire life.You see, once word got out that Ben Kingsley was going to play the Mandarin, the fanbase divided (yep, again).  People wanted the Mandarin to be asian which not only it would have made sense considering his origin, but also his name.  I didn't mind much.  Kingsley is a fantastic actor, and considering that in the first film Stark was captured in the Middle East and not in Asia it made sense for the continuity of the franchise.  When the first footage of the Mandarin showed up, the fanbase divided (happens a lot, huh?).  Some people hated it because of the weird voice and looks, while others feared they might do a Nolanesque version and strip the character of his magic power.  I didn't care much, I just wanted to see Iron Man face the Mandarin on the big screen.  Then the movie happened and...SPOILER ALERT!!!It turned out the Mandarin is not real.  He's an invention.  An actor pretending to be a character that doesn't exist to give the press a target, to give the people someone to blame and hate for Killian's crimes.  After that reveal I spent the rest of the film looking for another twist that would either reveal that the guy was lying all along pretending to be a hired nobody and he would show his true power or that they were going to pull a Ra's Al Ghul and show that while Kingsley was a fake the real Mandarin was still in the background.  It didn't happen.  This movie single-handedly destroyed this and all future opportunities for this franchise to represent Iron Man's greatest nemesis.END SPOILERYou see, I understand what they were going for.  And it works great for the film.  But there's absolutely no doubt that they could have easily pulled this off with a villain specifically made for this film.  Or maybe a lesser villain that no one cared about.  Or they could have reversed the roles of Killian and the Mandarin (since in the comics Killian was there just for one story arc, while the Mandarin has a long story of facing Iron Man) Picture if The Dark Knight had revealed at the end that the Joker hadn't killed anyone.  All of his victims were actors hired by the Joker's father to please his son, who was an autist.  And it turned out that the main villain of the movie was King Tut.  They could have easily made the same point without defacing Iron Man's greatest villain.On the plus side, Kingsley is clearly having a lot of fun playing the character, and he does a wonderful job with what he has.  But this only makes me think he would have also made a wonderful job if he had something better to work with.So yeah, while I don't think this particular problem kills the movie, it takes one star away for being a slap to the face of the comic fans, who are the entire reason this franchise exists in the first place.  Make no mistake, this is still a great movie, but sadly there's a huge amount of lost potential.",4,A fantastic film that proves the last one on the trilogy isn't always the worst one,1367712000,"05

It was a fast-paced action film with a reasonable sense of humor and a decent plot. As usual Robert Downey Jr, carries the film on his personality and charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job in a supporting role. They even figure out something useful to do with the character of Happy Hogan. I didn't know what to expect when Ben Kingsley was cast in this thing, but they figured out the perfect role for him. Don Cheadle was also used in a very effective way. The characters all had roles to play in the overall story. None of them stayed too long and their roles in the script were exactly suited to their characters. That I think is the most impressive thing about the writing.The film was directed by Shane ""Lethal Weapon"" Black. Its full of all his usual bits. But it seems fresh because its been a long time since he has done them and he is doing them in a different sort of context. Some moments feel very lethal weapon-ish (the gunplay, the buddy banter, the comedy) but I doubt most of the audience would notice. Black's strength is that he managed to bring out the character and human elements from the material in a way that was complementary to the action sequences.The best part about the script is that rolls out an interesting plot with a fair bit of mystery to it and delivers something worth all the build-up. The only negative is that certain aspects of the plot are *very* 2005. Certain points being made just seem kind of dated or cliche. There were simple way that the same ground could have been covered in a more up to date way. But the film moves so fast over them that it doesn't really matter much.Within its genre, its a really good film. Its pure action and character with excellent writing complemented by a first-rate cast.

It seemed like Tony Stark just randomly delivered his intoxicated dialogue throughout the entire story. The other movies seemed to have Tony with a sort of sarcastic quirky charm but this one seemed like his personality was forced on you. Why am I complaining about that? Well, it makes the movie feel like a movie instead of having a character naturally blend in with the story, it feels like you're just hearing lines you know were meant to get a reaction from the audience. This film plays more on comedy than wit and it gives off a cartoonish vibe. What I never get about any of these Marvel Superhero movies is that they always turn into some lighthearted comedic action movie. When in the comics the characters are pretty complex,serious,and deep. This is more like the Saturday Morning Ironman than the comic book iron man but so be it. What's surprising about the film is that it's light hearted but Tony Starks shoots people with guns and kills them in the film? Why? Iron Man doesn't go around killing people he's not the Punisher. That stuff aside the overall Villain in this movie is typical and that's boring. Ironman 2 YES! That was fun. Iron Man 1 I forgot who he was ever fighting but it didn't matter because it was all about IRON MAN. In Iron Man 3 it's like it has Trilogy Syndrome. It's time for the hero to hang his cape up and go on enjoying his life. Lets not forget that danger still exists and there will always be a need for a superhero or that Tony Starks might need his little inventions again for another threat in the future. It's just the standard cliche super hero Trilogy ending. With Iron Man it leaves on sort of a sad note because I don't think Iron man ever had a true Villain worthy of him fighting at least not depicted properly. The Mandarin is probably one of the bigger let downs of the film. Hopefully the Avengers movie will make up for Iron Man always having such week villains in a universe full of Supervillians from Dr. Doom to Madame Masque that have better movie worthy story lines.

Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 10]","I was impressed by ""Iron Man,"" underwhelmed by the character-stuffing antics of ""Iron Man 2"" and didn't have high hopes for ""Iron Man 3.""  But it's clear that Marvel's Phase 2 of its overall movie plan is actually a plan, not a bunch of execs sitting around a table fretting about what the audience wants, and the results are on screen.  This is the best Iron Man of the bunch.Like the first movie, debonair playboy billionaire Tony Stark (Morton Downey, Jr.) is his usual intense self, but he's evolved in a new direction since the events of ""The Avengers."" Nobody - not Stark, not the rest of the world, not little kids he bumps into during his adventures - forgets that aliens nearly destroyed New York City.  The world has changed: National fears are elevated by a no-longer-existential threat, security and tensions are heightened, and Stark suffers from panic attacks. Old-fashioned terrorism has to raise the game to get anybody's attention.When a Bin-Laden like villain known as the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, doing a brilliant turn in a character far nuanced than the comic archetype would usually warrant) begins hijacking the airwaves with a bomb so intense that it echoes Hiroshima's after-effects of burning shadows into walls, Stark does what he always does.  He calls out the Mandarin by giving him his home address...on national television.The consequences for his action are dire, of course.  ""Iron Man 3"" looks the life of a superhero squarely in the eye and says: this is what happens when you're famous.  It's what keeps Stark up at night too; when you've watched the Hulk in action, is it any wonder he can never sleep again?Forget villains of the week, action figures, and commercial tie-ins.  This movie is about Stark and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Guy Pearce does an excellent turn as the disgruntled founder of AIM, but he largely just sits back and let the other actors do their thing.It's easy to see why this movie is an international hit.  It is at times both breathtakingly cynical and terrifically optimistic. When Stark goes on the run after his aforementioned schoolyard taunt lands him in deep trouble, his relationship with wide-eyed but not innocent Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) grounds the film.  It's a reminder that for all the politics and power suits, Iron Man is still a superhero at heart.  And as the 70s-style credits retrospective reminds us, the Iron Man Franchise is just getting started.  Stay after the credits for a humorous conclusion to Stark's narrative.Welcome back, Tony.

There is a lot of misdirection in this movie, which even hinting about would give away too much.  Some people hated the way that turned out, but I personally did not have much problem with it.  Although the effect of the big twist did make the movie in a way similar (but not the same) as the plot in the second one.This film definitely ratchets up the action.  There are a lot more ""big"" action sequences in this movie, from Stark's house being blown up, to a mid air rescue, to the final battle.  A lot is going on, and the effects are blended very well with live action shots so they look more ""real"" than in any of the other movies.  The plot is somewhat convoluted and like I said above, has twists to it.  Both the characters of Pepper and Rhodes have even more expanded roles in this movie.  Robert Downey Jr continues to nail the Tony Stark role and mixes humor and intensity.  Ben Kingsly is excellent in his role, he was very chilling as Mandarin, and is involved in one of the plot twists.  There is also the usual after the credits scene involving a cameo by one of the Avengers.As far as extras go, there is about an hour of material from making of/behind the scenes features, a short film that reveals events after the end of Captain America, a short look at the next Thor movie, and a gag reel.  In all enough to make those who like the bonus material happy.  Of course the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray for those who get the actual discs.While an argument can be made that the superhero franchises are becoming over saturated, they do not seem to be slowing down over time.  This movie definitely left open the possibility of further stand alone Iron Man movies, but also brought a sense of closure to the Tony Stark origin story.

I am by no means a geek or a comic book guy, but I do know that the Mandarin is supposed to be Iron Man's greatest foe. He is supposed to have the 10 rings of power, not just 10 rings like he wears in the movie, but 10 magical rings that are the source of his power and that give him power. I'd also like to say that I did not mind the directors going with the Mandarin as a modern day terrorist who is the mastermind behind the war on terror. However, when it is revealed that the Mandarin is no more than a crazy druggie and alcoholic actor my heart sank.Also, I question what Guy Pearce was even doing in this movie. If the director was going to make Pearce a bad guy, make him an accomplice of the Mandarin like everyone thought at the begining of the movie. Don't make him the main bad guy and criminal mastermind behind the whole plot!Like I said, 3 stars because of the Mandarin screwup. This movie really deserves 2 stars but I don't dislike the movie enough to give it that. If you are a fan of the Iron Man movies and The Avengers than I would still recomend buying this movie despite its major flaws.

1559610,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B008JFUO72,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""Iron Man 3"" picks up after 2012's ""The Avengers"", with Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) suffering panic attacks as a result of battling aliens in that movie. He copes by building more Iron Man suits and trying obsessively to perfect the Mark 42 suit, which can home in on him and attach itself to Stark in pieces wherever he may be -when it works. Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) carries on as CEO of Stark Industries, but she's annoyed and concerned by Tony's behavior. On the news, a self-proclaimed terrorist named ""The Mandarin"" takes responsibility for a string of bombings of US targets. The White House believes this is national business, not superhero business, so they call in Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) in the form of ""Iron Patriot"" to deal with it. But when Stark Industries' chief of security (John Favreau) is seriously injured in a bombing, Tony Stark vows revenge.Shane Black has replaced John Favreau in the director's seat, and he co-wrote ""Iron Man 3"" with Drew Pearce as well. This is a stronger entry in the franchise than ""Iron Man 2"", which suffered from too many characters and subplots. Tony Stark does a lot of work without his suit this time, which allows Robert Downey, Jr. more screen time. With the franchise's characteristic humor, the film pokes fun at celebrity, actors, and technology, the very things it promotes. But ""Iron Man 3"" is more a morality play than even the first installment. And it doesn't shy away from political commentary. It's a stronger film for that, but by no means perfect. We see too many remote-controlled suits, which are not interesting and defeat the idea of a superhero. The final battle is boring. Apart than that, it's pretty good -though I kind of liked Stark better when he was a big, rich jerk.",4,"Funny, Exciting Morality Tale, though Some Action Could Have Been Better.",1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,1764,"['Iron', 'Man', '3', 'picks', 'up', '2012', 'Avengers', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'suffering', 'panic', 'attacks', 'result', 'battling', 'aliens', 'movie', 'building', 'more', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suits', 'trying', 'obsessively', 'perfect', 'Mark', '42', 'suit', 'can', 'home', 'attach', 'Stark', 'pieces', 'may', 'be', '-when', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'annoyed', 'concerned', 'Tony', 'behavior', 'news', 'self-proclaimed', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Mandarin', 'responsibility', 'string', 'bombings', 'US', 'targets', 'White', 'House', 'national', 'business', 'not', 'superhero', 'business', 'call', 'Col.', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'form', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'deal', 'when', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'chief', 'security', 'John', 'Favreau', 'seriously', 'injured', 'bombing', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'revenge.Shane', 'Black', 'replaced', 'John', 'Favreau', 'director', 'seat', 'co-wrote', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Drew', 'Pearce', 'as', 'well', 'stronger', 'entry', 'franchise', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'suffered', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'subplots', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'lot', 'work', 'suit', 'time', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'franchise', 'characteristic', 'humor', 'film', 'fun', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'technology', 'very', 'things', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'more', 'morality', 'play', 'even', 'first', 'installment', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'political', 'commentary', 'stronger', 'film', 'means', 'perfect', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'remote-controlled', 'suits', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'defeat', 'idea', 'superhero', 'final', 'battle', 'boring', 'Apart', 'pretty', 'good', 'kind', 'liked', 'Stark', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'rich', 'jerk']",N/A
1559611,AR8HCCLIFWQHP,B008JFUO72,Mirror_Matter,"[1, 2]","First off, I don't think any superhero story ends up working well when the main problem is that the hero has lost his or her powers (or in this case the suit doesn't work properly).  We know the powers are eventually going to come back so there is no real drama/suspense.  In the meantime, we vicariously experience frustration (Why doesn't the suit work? Why didn't he stick with the old suit that worked?  Why didn't I just watch one of the previous better Iron Man movies?).Next, most good guy - bad guy movies are only as good as the bad guy is interesting.  Robert Downey Jr. is  a little bit of both and is constantly interesting to watch (not so much here as the previous movies), but he still needs a worthy rival.  I did not even understand the bad guy's motivation.  He wants to &#34;have the monopoly on terrorism&#34; (something like that), but why?  Because Tony Stark left him waiting on a roof?  This is his big revenge motive?  Iron man 2 had a revenge motive (not the most interesting motive), but at least it was for a lifetime of being cast out and perceived theft of ideas (I get how that would make someone a little obsessive).  I think that here they had an idea for the special effect (translucent fire stuff with regenerative properties) and then went from there.Robert Downey is so good in this role and the look of the movie is excellent as are its predecessors.  So you only need a decent story line to create a really good movie.

1559613,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUO72,mitchell5954,"[3, 6]","Iron Man 3 is the first installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2 (Post Avengers. Personally, I think they are off to a strong start. Iron Man 3 is a highly entertaining move and a major improvement to the previous Iron Man installment. The story is competent and engaging, the characters are well developed, the action will get your blood pumping, and the villains are also good, for the most part. There are problems, that bring the movie down for me slightly though. Most of the problems are nitpicks, but one might be a major turn-off for viewers. In my opinion, Iron Man 3 is vastly superior to Iron Man 2, but not quite as good as the first Iron Man.The story is quite interesting and executed much more competently then in Iron Man 2. The story deals with demons from Tony's past come back to bite him in the present. Tony is also plagued by panic attacks from the fight in New York in Avengers. Tony must find a way to defeat his demons before they hurt those he cares for. Unlike Iron man 2 I actually felt Tony's plight, and the big threat is actually legitimate. The story was quite good, though I personally prefer the story too the first Iron Man more. The main characters are the same as the first two films. Tony is back and has a new dilemma he has to face. Unlike the second film, I actually felt for Tony. Tony came off as too arrogant in the second film and made so many stupid decisions that I found myself kind of not liking him until the end. In this film, while still arrogant, I find Tony much more sympathetic and he is actually being smart in this film.Pepper's character, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is more in line with what she was in the first Iron Man, which is a good thing. In Iron Man 2 all she did was nag Tony. In this she is much less annoying, and actually serves the plot. She even helps Tony in the end like in the first film.Rhodey, played again by Don Cheadle is also better in this film. He has much more to do in this film then in the previous films, which is a plus. Though, I wish Rhodey had more time in the suit doing things. The rest of the cast did a fine job for the most part.The villains very good and quite refreshing! Unlike Iron Man 2 the villains, for the most part, can be taken seriously. Plus the villains feel like an actual threat, not a minor inconvenience like the villains in Iron Man 2. Plus it is refreshing that the big threat at the end is not another version of the Iron Man technology.The effects are great as always. The humor is a ton better this time around. The action is one of this movie's strongest points. One thing I did not like about the previous two films is that the action scenes. The action was too short and anticlimactic, especially the final battle. However, in this movie, the action is very ramp up. The final battle is actually satisfying. The film does have a couple problems that do bring it down a little for me. Firstly, the middle was a bit slow passed. The moments with the kid I did not care for that much. The big issue for me is a twist that comes half way through the film. This twist might piss lots of people off. When I learned of the big twist, even I was like: ""What..really?"" The twist did not ruin the film for me, but it might for some people, particularly fans of the Iron Man comic.Overall this is a great addition to the Iron Man franchise.

1559615,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUO72,M. Oleson,"[0, 2]","This 3rd, and I suspect last, entry of Marvel's Iron Man maintains the momentum of the predecessors thanks primarily to Robert Downey, Jr. as rich industrialist/inventor Tony Stark who outed himself as Iron Man in the first film.  Director Shane Black takes over the director's duties replacing Jon Favreau, who's still on board as Tony's friend Happy Hogan.  Even after The Avengers (which includes Iron Man) stomped the aliens month's earlier, human bad guys are still out to get America.  This time it's an Osama bin laden style character known as ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) or Man Darin as he is known in China.The evil Mandarin takes aim at Tony after Stark promises to come after him.  Tony's great house is destroyed with Tony and live-in girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) inside.  The Iron Man suit is malfunctioning and Tony must recover using his wits and plenty of movie magic.  He befriends a pre-teen boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps him get going again.  Tony is homing in on the Miami (!) based lair of The Mandarin who he has vowed to kill.Introduced into the film are Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a man with ideas that Stark shunned years earlier and his technical assistant Maya (Rebecca Hall) who Tony bedded that same night.  It appears Killian is supplying The Mandarin with the warfare needed to terrorize the world.  That includes some newly enhanced soldiers.  This all leads of course, to the big showdown and the filmmakers spare no expense.The film is a bit of an anomaly.  On one hand it is a bit darker.  Tony has developed a case of severe anxiety for example.  But it also has plenty of humor, most of which is supplied by Downey, Jr.  And the Iron Man suits don't always work.  They stumble and fall.  So is there anything wrong?  Well sure.  For one, I would like to see more byplay between Pepper and Tony.  The actors have great chemistry together.  Why not exploit it?  There are some continuity issues.  There's a scene where Tony, without his suit, is fending off the bad guys in a darkened building.  He more than holds his own, both with his fighting and his shooting prowess.

1559625,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B008JFUO72,Moviedude,"[5, 10]","Warning: here be spoilers.Iron Man 3 sets out to return Iron Man to his roots of dark, believable action established in the first movie, while retaining the big-spectacle adventure of Avengers. To that end we see Tony Stark face off against a peculiar new representation of the Mandarin, a snarling, ethnically nebulous terrorist ringleader portrayed by Ben Kingsly. After an exasperated Stark promises to end the Mandarin's reign of terror, the mastermind seemingly orders the destruction of Stark's house, setting him on a quest to locate the Mandarin through an entertaining combination of detective work and MacGuyver-esque trickery. Stark is opposed by an army of mysterious flunkies who have been granted superpowers by Extremis, a genetic modification originally meant to help the disabled (as opposed to military nanites as in the comic).Viewers have made much of this film's twist- that the Mandarin is in fact a puppet of the real villain, AIM director Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who has hired a degenerate English actor to portray a power-mad despot as part of a political misdirection. This was a polarizing twist- for those who are new to the franchise it is a clever, Shyamalan-esque turn, and for serious comic nerds, it's an unexpected twist that is not out of line with the spirit of the franchise. For many, however, the reveal that the Mandarin was not in fact his usual Ming-the-Merciless-esque self, or even real, was a huge disappointment. For me the twist worked- I was disappointed at how generic and ridiculously grimdark the Mandarin initially appeared, but the reveal that he was a fiction- and not a very bad guy in reality- was something I did not expect. One can also read the twist as something of a satire of Ben Kingsly's career, which has been heavily built on playing ethnic and foreign characters, just as his filmic alter-ego does.Another point of contention is that Iron Man spends so much of the film outside his armor. I would assert that this is important- by pitting the largely average Tony Stark against the super-powered AIM operatives who obstruct him we see him acting as a hero without the crutch of dominating technology. It makes for a refreshing reminder that under the armor there is still a hero we can root for.Although it's not as BIG of a movie as Avengers, Iron Man 3 succeeds at being a thriller, and action film, and just a bit funny all at once. It rekindles the new, fresh feel of the first movie in a way that the second missed, and develops all of its characters in entertaining, satisfying directions. Of particular note is Ty Simpkins as Harley, a bratty sidekick who attaches himself limpet-like to the unwilling Tony. I am always leery of kids in movies of this kind, but he's spot on. It's also hard to fault Shane Black, who blends 90s directorial sensibilities with modern FX and camerawork to create a movie that feels different from its predecessors and from the rest of the MCU. Among other things, Black dials back on the CG of Avengers with numerous effective practical effects (I could swear I spotted a cable when Iron Man rescues the crew of Air Force 1, though) and excellent set design and lighting throughout.Were I to complain about any part of the film, it would be the character of Tony's friend James Rhodes, AKA War Machine (Don Cheadle once again). Back when he was Terrance Howard, Rhody didn't even GET to be War machine, and he was only limited in the second film. Here once again the producers seem concerned that audiences will be confused by the presence of two Iron men, as War Machine spends most of his time out-of-scene, and participates in the climax out of his armor. I love Cheadle's take on the character, and would have loved to see him get a better part as what we DO see is well in line with the character as he appears in other media.PROS:-Unique direction makes for a film that feels genuinely different from the other coming attractions-Good acting from a pretty diverse cast of characters-Recaptures the feel of the first Iron ManCONS:-Editing is sloppy in some places-Soundtrack is not particularly memorableFINAL THOUGHTS:Iron Man 3 is a worthwhile entry in MCU canon, and its departures from the comics are justifiable as part of building the film.",5,A worthy successor to the first film,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,4262,"['Warning', 'here', 'be', 'spoilers.Iron', 'Man', '3', 'out', 'return', 'Iron', 'Man', 'roots', 'dark', 'believable', 'action', 'established', 'first', 'movie', 'retaining', 'big-spectacle', 'adventure', 'Avengers', 'end', 'see', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'face', 'off', 'peculiar', 'new', 'representation', 'Mandarin', 'snarling', 'ethnically', 'nebulous', 'terrorist', 'ringleader', 'portrayed', 'Ben', 'Kingsly', 'exasperated', 'Stark', 'end', 'Mandarin', 'reign', 'terror', 'mastermind', 'seemingly', 'orders', 'destruction', 'Stark', 'house', 'setting', 'quest', 'locate', 'Mandarin', 'entertaining', 'combination', 'detective', 'work', 'MacGuyver-esque', 'trickery', 'Stark', 'opposed', 'army', 'mysterious', 'flunkies', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'granted', 'superpowers', 'Extremis', 'genetic', 'modification', 'originally', 'meant', 'help', 'disabled', 'opposed', 'military', 'nanites', 'comic', '.Viewers', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'film', 'twist-', 'Mandarin', 'fact', 'puppet', 'real', 'villain', 'AIM', 'director', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'hired', 'degenerate', 'English', 'actor', 'portray', 'power-mad', 'despot', 'part', 'political', 'misdirection', 'was', 'polarizing', 'twist-', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'franchise', 'clever', 'Shyamalan-esque', 'turn', 'serious', 'comic', 'nerds', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'not', 'line', 'spirit', 'franchise', 'many', 'however', 'reveal', 'Mandarin', 'was', 'not', 'fact', 'usual', 'Ming-the-Merciless-esque', 'self', 'even', 'real', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'twist', 'worked-', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'generic', 'ridiculously', 'grimdark', 'Mandarin', 'initially', 'appeared', 'reveal', 'was', 'fiction-', 'not', 'very', 'bad', 'guy', 'reality-', 'was', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'twist', 'something', 'satire', 'Ben', 'Kingsly', 'career', 'been', 'heavily', 'built', 'playing', 'ethnic', 'foreign', 'characters', 'just', 'filmic', 'alter-ego', 'does.Another', 'point', 'contention', 'Iron', 'Man', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'armor', 'would', 'assert', 'important-', 'pitting', 'largely', 'average', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'super-powered', 'AIM', 'operatives', 'who', 'obstruct', 'see', 'acting', 'hero', 'crutch', 'dominating', 'technology', 'refreshing', 'reminder', 'armor', 'still', 'hero', 'can', 'root', 'not', 'BIG', 'movie', 'Avengers', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'being', 'thriller', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'funny', 'once', 'new', 'fresh', 'feel', 'first', 'movie', 'way', 'second', 'missed', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'directions', 'particular', 'note', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'Harley', 'bratty', 'sidekick', 'who', 'limpet-like', 'unwilling', 'Tony', 'am', 'always', 'leery', 'kids', 'movies', 'kind', 'spot', 'also', 'hard', 'fault', 'Shane', 'Black', 'who', '90s', 'directorial', 'sensibilities', 'modern', 'FX', 'camerawork', 'create', 'movie', 'different', 'predecessors', 'rest', 'MCU', 'other', 'things', 'Black', 'back', 'CG', 'Avengers', 'numerous', 'effective', 'practical', 'effects', 'could', 'swear', 'spotted', 'cable', 'when', 'Iron', 'Man', 'crew', 'Air', 'Force', '1', 'though', 'excellent', 'set', 'design', 'lighting', 'throughout.Were', 'complain', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'character', 'Tony', 'friend', 'James', 'Rhodes', 'AKA', 'War', 'Machine', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'once', 'again', 'Back', 'when', 'was', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Rhody', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'GET', 'be', 'War', 'machine', 'was', 'only', 'limited', 'second', 'film', 'Here', 'once', 'again', 'producers', 'seem', 'concerned', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'presence', 'two', 'Iron', 'men', 'War', 'Machine', 'most', 'time', 'out-of-scene', 'participates', 'climax', 'armor', 'love', 'Cheadle', 'take', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'get', 'better', 'part', 'what', 'DO', 'see', 'well', 'line', 'character', 'other', 'media.PROS', '-Unique', 'direction', 'film', 'genuinely', 'different', 'other', 'coming', 'attractions-Good', 'acting', 'pretty', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters-Recaptures', 'feel', 'first', 'Iron', 'ManCONS', '-Editing', 'sloppy', 'places-Soundtrack', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorableFINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'worthwhile', 'entry', 'MCU', 'canon', 'departures', 'comics', 'are', 'justifiable', 'part', 'building', 'film']",N/A

1559639,A2X9QECJ5W6DOK,B008JFUO72,Natalie W,"[5, 14]","You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this movie!First off, I will admit to being a total Shane Black fangirl, having enjoyed his other work immensely, so I was giddy when I found out he was hired to direct.I must say, I think he did a great job and for those that are familiar with his other work, you'll notice just seconds in that this is definitely ""A Shane Black Movie"". Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than that of it's predecessors, but in my opinion it's a very welcome change. I've seen some reviews say that they disliked the fact that the story had such a dark tone and that it felt too emotional for a superhero flick. I understand where that crowd is coming from. Heavy storylines and superheroes seem to be almost an oxymoron. Usually, the plot for a comic book movie is pretty linear: (Solely my opinion) There's a hero/and/or heroes, a conflict/villain, said villain then causes destruction and the hero(es) face impossible odds but then figure out a way to save the day and the movie ends on a high note.Iron Man 3 is *not* that movie. In fact, I think I enjoyed the third installment that much more because of it's emotion and darker storyline. I enjoyed seeing Tony shattered and desperate, doubting himself, waging an internal war with himself in the wake of the events seen in ""The Avengers"".Even though it's a movie intended to entertain, I think by showing the audience a vulnerable Tony Stark, it let's them know that even ""superheroes"" struggle with everyday problems like everybody else.Besides, we see him struggle with personal issues, guilt and self-doubt all the time in the comics, I found it refreshing that they chose to deal with Tony's anxiety and nightmares directly rather than, presenting the problem, kind of dealing with said problem and then either sweeping it under the rug or forgetting that they put it in the script altogether like they did with Iron Man 2.Now, that doesn't mean the movie is exquisitely perfect. There are plenty of plotholes too and in my opinion, the use of flashbacks really mess up the whole cinematic timeline of Iron Man as we know him and that was the only thing that *really* bothered me. Also, the movie essentially takes several storylines from Iron Man's history and puts them altogether. I'll admit, that's not what I was expecting. I thought the plot would focus more on the Extremis virus than it did, but I didn't mind at all. I think that's one of the main gripes that people have with it. When they said Extremis, I think everyone expected something very similar to Warren Ellis' beautifully written comic.Another thing that will rub some people the wrong way, especially if you're a die-hard comics purist, is the fact that there's a pretty big twist involving The Mandarin. This is another common gripe I've been seeing on various sites. I personally didn't mind it, but judge for yourself.Overall, I thought it was a really fun, entertaining movie and a great way to get the summer started!

1559647,A292163FE9C117,B008JFUO72,"Norma Beishir ""author, The Unicorn's Daughter""","[6, 12]","Darker than the two previous Iron Man movies, Iron Man 3 is a cautionary tale. It reminds me, oddly enough, of an episode of the TV series Touched By An Angel, in which the angel Monica, in an uncharacteristic bad mood, snaps at someone, setting off a chain of events that results in a woman's suicide. One never knows what impact a seemingly unimportant act or comment might have on another.At the start of the film, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), in voice-over, says that he created two of his own demons. He recalls the events of New Year's Eve 1999. His callous treatment of two idealistic young scientists, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), at a party in Switzerland set into motion a thirteen-year quest for revenge that would lead to countless deaths and destruction.When Tony must face those demons, the timing couldn't be worse. He's been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder since his all-too-close brush with death in New York (in The Avengers). He's unable to sleep. He's plagued by self-doubt. He builds one Iron Man armor after another, for a grand total of forty-eight. He worries that he can't protect the one thing--the one person--he can't live without: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), now CEO of Stark Industries. Yet in his manic state, he seems to be neglecting her, and that worries his friend and former bodyguard, now head of Stark security, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau)--especially when Aldrich Killian shows up at Stark Industries one day, presumably in search of funding for his Extremis project (which reminds me a lot of the supersoldier project in Captain America: The First Avenger).Extremis is one of those discoveries that, in the right hands, could have been a gift to humanity--but it's in the hands of a madman, and it's dangerously flawed. But is the madman the Asian terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), or is it Killian himself? Not everything in Iron Man 3 is what it appears to be.The movie could be subtitled Tony Stark Finally Grows Up, because until now, he's been, for the most part, a big kid with a lot of really cool toys. He's the boy who never thought his father loved him. I've often wondered what his relationship with his mother was like, and what role it played in his inability to commit to Pepper through two movies and countless comic books. A shrink could make a career of this guy.Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark than it is about Iron Man. As he searches for the identity of his enemy, he also searches for his own identity in his post-Avengers world, and what he discovers in the midst of all the explosions, battles and confrontations is, I think, as surprising to him as it will be to his audience. I loved it--as always, RDJ delivers the rapid-fire wit in abundance, and though there's less banter between him and Paltrow this time around, there's some funny dialogue between him and best buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), who hates having to trade in War Machine for Killian's flashier Iron Patriot armor--Rhodey's password, WARMACHINEROCKS, pretty much says it all. There's also some great scenes between Tony and a young Tennessee boy (Ty Simpkins) that makes me wonder--could there be a baby in Tony and Pepper's future?",5,"More Tony Stark, Less Iron Man",1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,3245,"['Darker', 'two', 'previous', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'oddly', 'enough', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'angel', 'Monica', 'uncharacteristic', 'bad', 'mood', 'snaps', 'someone', 'setting', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'results', 'woman', 'suicide', 'One', 'never', 'what', 'impact', 'seemingly', 'unimportant', 'act', 'comment', 'might', 'have', 'start', 'film', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'voice-over', 'created', 'two', 'own', 'demons', 'events', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', '1999', 'callous', 'treatment', 'two', 'idealistic', 'young', 'scientists', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Maya', 'Hansen', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'party', 'Switzerland', 'set', 'motion', 'thirteen-year', 'quest', 'revenge', 'would', 'lead', 'countless', 'deaths', 'destruction.When', 'Tony', 'must', 'face', 'demons', 'timing', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'been', 'struggling', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'all-too-close', 'brush', 'death', 'New', 'York', 'Avengers', 'unable', 'sleep', 'plagued', 'self-doubt', 'one', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armor', 'grand', 'total', 'forty-eight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'protect', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'now', 'CEO', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'manic', 'state', 'be', 'neglecting', 'friend', 'former', 'bodyguard', 'now', 'head', 'Stark', 'security', 'Happy', 'Hogan', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'especially', 'when', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'up', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'one', 'day', 'presumably', 'search', 'funding', 'Extremis', 'project', 'lot', 'supersoldier', 'project', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', '.Extremis', 'one', 'discoveries', 'right', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gift', 'humanity', 'hands', 'madman', 'dangerously', 'flawed', 'madman', 'Asian', 'terrorist', 'who', 'Mandarin', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Killian', 'Not', 'everything', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'what', 'be.The', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'subtitled', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Finally', 'Grows', 'Up', 'now', 'been', 'most', 'part', 'big', 'kid', 'lot', 'really', 'cool', 'toys', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'thought', 'father', 'loved', ""'ve"", 'often', 'wondered', 'what', 'relationship', 'mother', 'was', 'role', 'played', 'inability', 'commit', 'Pepper', 'two', 'movies', 'countless', 'comic', 'books', 'shrink', 'could', 'make', 'career', 'guy.Iron', 'Man', '3', 'more', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'identity', 'enemy', 'also', 'own', 'identity', 'post-Avengers', 'world', 'what', 'midst', 'explosions', 'battles', 'confrontations', 'think', 'surprising', 'will', 'be', 'audience', 'loved', 'always', 'RDJ', 'rapid-fire', 'wit', 'abundance', 'less', 'banter', 'Paltrow', 'time', 'around', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'best', 'buddy', 'Rhodey', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'having', 'trade', 'War', 'Machine', 'Killian', 'flashier', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'armor', 'Rhodey', 'password', 'WARMACHINEROCKS', 'pretty', 'much', 'also', 'great', 'scenes', 'Tony', 'young', 'Tennessee', 'boy', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'wonder', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'baby', 'Tony', 'Pepper', 'future']",N/A

I saw it and liked it, but it left me feeling a bit let down. So: four stars.The actors are as good as ever, Downey in particular - my favorite -- as the quick and quirky Tony Stark, dead pan, courageous, and as neurotically obsessed as ever.But I must say that, while the first part and middle of the movie were great fun to watch, the last part - in particular the climactic battle on board a big industrial ship that might have been used for either oil transport or exploration, is something of a mess. I got the feeling the director put together a lot of short fight scenes and could not suffer to part with any of them. The result is hard to follow: something tremendous happens, but before one is sure of what, the scene is cut to the next big explosion that is cut half way to the next bad person being blown to bits that... `Choreographed' it is not a word that describes it very well.In my humble opinion, if the director would had left out half of those takes and gave the remaining ones two or three seconds more each, so one could have enough time to appreciate them and get some overall idea of the mayhem in progress, the effect would have been much more satisfactory.In general, this movie has more in common with the ""Avengers"" than with ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"": here Tony Stark is more like a comic book super hero and less like the bright genius cum regular guy that just happens to have invented and uses these great armored suits, but is otherwise just your basic daredevil billionaire.I know that some critics and people writing here about the movie see depths in it, that some kind of existential doubt assails the hero; to my mind that is ""a bit too much of a muchness"", as the Brits would say.Summing up: this is an action movie with good acting, but it could have been edited better. Mostly fun and worth watching, but not as good as what its predecessors had made me expect. And if this turns out to be the greatest box office success ever on planet earth and even the whole galaxy?

It had one of the best `origin story' films ever (equal with `Batman Begins') and, even when its sequel was underwhelming (as it was with ""Iron Man 2""), it is still a lot of fun.""Iron Man 3"" steps up the sequel game a notch.  While it doesn't quite reach the excellence of the first film, it is an improvement over the second.  The third installment doesn't pick up at the end of ""Iron Man 2"".  Instead, it follows the events from 2012's epic blockbuster, ""The Avengers"", as Tony Stark makes repeated reference to events of the `Battle of New York' causing him problems with sleeping.In ""Iron Man 3"", Tony obsesses with building more Iron Man suits in preparation for the next big threat, to the constant irritation of girlfriend, Pepper Potts.  The next threat is very real due to a series of terrorist attacks executed by a shadowy figure known as the Mandarin.  On the front line of these assaults are a series of genetically engineered super-soldiers who posses enormous recuperative powers.  Tony Stark's first attempt to stand up to the Mandarin backfires horribly, forcing Tony to go on the lam to try and keep the people close to him safe while he investigates the source of the attacks and formulates a response.""Iron Man 3"" has added to an incredibly strong cast with Sir Ben Kingsley portraying the Mandarin and Guy Pearce as the once nerdy, but now suave, Aldrich Killian, whose chance meeting with Stark 13 years earlier had a profound impact on each.Robert Downey, Jr. continues to `own' Iron Man and Tony Stark.  After having enjoyed his performances over several films, it's hard to imagine anyone else so perfectly encompassing Stark's combination of arrogance, insecurity and thirst for justice.  Gwyneth Paltrow still remains solid as Pepper Potts.  And, while I do like Don Cheadle as an actor, I still think Terrence Howard was a better fit as Rhodie.  It's a shame whatever dispute that kept Howard out of the sequels could not be resolved.All in all, the action is as good as in any of the ""Iron Man"" films.

When the Mandarin called the Prez on Air Force One - I said out loud: ""This is the best one yet"". Which as you guessed I retracted approximately 20 minutes later. The Mandarin is an ICONIC Villan the way he was originally written. The script twist was Stupid. It is because of the tone struck right at that point that most movie goers find Super Hero movies juvenile. The Mandarin as revealed to the audience in the first half of the film, was awesome and scary. Then, the desire for a cheap laugh blew the whole thing. Alderidge should have been like Johan Schmidt in Captain America; A second banana who was trying to eclipse his boss. Nice Going, Mr. Black. You single handedly erased all the ground gained by The Avengers with the film goers who are not fans.Number Two - Marvel never should have taken Jon Favreau off the Iron Man  franchise. He knows Marvel, He Knows Tony Stark and the first 2 installments were perfect. When some thing isn't broken, DON""T FIX IT.Number Three - Pepper in the Armor?? Really? Come on! Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame Lame! It seems to me that too many people have gotten to wear that Armor in the movies. It doesn't matter that they wrote those stories lines in the comics..They were bad, and not worth wasting valuable Celluloid on.Number Four - Even if Tony had blown up all his armors and had surgery to remove all the Shrapnel (which makes sense), he wouldn't toss the chest arc reactor in the sea -  No Way.  Again, Stupid.Topping the past 2 Iron Man movies and the Avengers would be really difficult, but not impossible.

1559677,A2GBMLJM53M0FZ,B008JFUO72,PJA,"[1, 4]","Its gotten so tough to figure out where Robert Downey ends and Tony Stark begins, I'll bet there are days that he can't figure it out, either. And, that's great news for fans of great adventure movies; because he is THE rock star of movie superheros.After the bloated self-importance of 'Iron Man 2', this third tale puts Mr. Stark exactly where we want him: in the most serious trouble; and, with nothing but his intellect, ego and eloquence to bail him out. Borrowing from the classic 'Extremis' comic-book arc, IM3 has Stark running from the nightmares he experienced in 'The Avengers', and discovering that old Buckaroo Banzai was right: ""...no matter where you go, there you are."" This angst and and resulting burnout stresses the relationship between Stark and gal-pal Pepper Potts; and, in ways that will prove vital to the film's denouement. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to deftly blend Pott's quicksilver emotions towards her naughty-boy, Supersqueeze: exasperation, elation, devotion and the clear desire to take a maternal wooden spoon to his backside. She is more than his match.Guy Pierce, in yet another 2013 movie performance, proves to be a villain of charm, hubris and intellect who provides a very dark reflection for Stark to contemplate. In addition, the genesis of this new tale ties up elements going back to the first Iron Man movie; and, proves that our actions always catch up with us.Sound a little deep for a superhero flick? Not to worry. The cast and director massage it all in such a way, that it keeps your brain engaged, while providing the visual and auditory assaults we all demand of such movies.There is some well-managed humor from (former Iron Man director) John Favreau as bodyguard/factotum Happy Hogan; and, a kid 'sidekick' for Stark who manages to act like a kid, without becoming an obnoxious jerk (yeah, Short-Round...I'm talkin' to you).Don Cheadle returns as ""Rhodie""/War Machine/ Iron Patriot; and, there is a lot of fun watching this intense actor/character being mercilessly teased by his buddy.The story is suitably sinister, and Pierce's minions are as hiss-able as anyone could ask. A rollicking score, crystal cinematography and tight editing wrap this excellent cine-present up in a tidy bow.Oh, about those extras...Start with 'Agent Carter', a short movie (""Marvel One-Shot"") about Captain America's secret-agent sweetheart. It takes place a year after the end of 'Cap', and puts our Miss Carter at odds with evil spies and FBI male chauvinists, too (gasp!). An absolute little gem.In addition, there is a generous selection of the usual 'making-of' clips and outtakes. However, what I really got a kick out of were some clips of Downey vamping through scenes, at a mile-a-minute, until he gets the version that 'clicks' for him (and, ended up in the theatrical release).Top to bottom, this is 3 hours of soaring, solid action entertainment.That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox!PJA",5,"The best stand-alone Marvel film yet...and, a lot of great 'extras', too!",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2937,"['gotten', 'so', 'tough', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Tony', 'Stark', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'are', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'either', 'great', 'news', 'fans', 'great', 'adventure', 'movies', 'THE', 'rock', 'star', 'movie', 'superheros.After', 'bloated', 'self-importance', ""'Iron"", 'Man', '2', 'third', 'tale', 'Mr.', 'Stark', 'exactly', 'where', 'want', 'most', 'serious', 'trouble', 'nothing', 'intellect', 'ego', 'eloquence', 'bail', 'out', 'Borrowing', 'classic', 'comic-book', 'arc', 'IM3', 'Stark', 'running', 'nightmares', 'experienced', ""'The"", 'Avengers', 'discovering', 'old', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai', 'was', 'right', 'matter', 'where', 'go', 'are', 'angst', 'resulting', 'burnout', 'relationship', 'Stark', 'gal-pal', 'Pepper', 'Potts', 'ways', 'will', 'prove', 'vital', 'film', 'denouement', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'deftly', 'blend', 'Pott', 'quicksilver', 'emotions', 'naughty-boy', 'Supersqueeze', 'exasperation', 'elation', 'devotion', 'clear', 'desire', 'take', 'maternal', 'wooden', 'spoon', 'backside', 'more', 'match.Guy', 'Pierce', 'yet', '2013', 'movie', 'performance', 'be', 'villain', 'charm', 'hubris', 'intellect', 'who', 'very', 'dark', 'reflection', 'Stark', 'contemplate', 'addition', 'genesis', 'new', 'tale', 'up', 'elements', 'going', 'back', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'actions', 'always', 'catch', 'up', 'little', 'deep', 'superhero', 'flick', 'Not', 'worry', 'cast', 'director', 'massage', 'way', 'brain', 'engaged', 'providing', 'visual', 'auditory', 'assaults', 'demand', 'such', 'well-managed', 'humor', 'former', 'Iron', 'Man', 'director', 'John', 'Favreau', 'bodyguard/factotum', 'Happy', 'Hogan', 'kid', 'Stark', 'who', 'act', 'kid', 'becoming', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'yeah', 'Short-Round', ""'m"", 'talkin', '.Don', 'Cheadle', 'returns', 'Rhodie', '/War', 'Machine/', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'intense', 'actor/character', 'being', 'mercilessly', 'teased', 'buddy.The', 'story', 'suitably', 'sinister', 'Pierce', 'minions', 'are', 'as', 'hiss-able', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'rollicking', 'score', 'crystal', 'cinematography', 'tight', 'editing', 'wrap', 'excellent', 'cine-present', 'up', 'tidy', 'bow.Oh', 'extras', 'Start', ""'Agent"", 'Carter', 'short', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'One-Shot', 'Captain', 'America', 'secret-agent', 'sweetheart', 'place', 'year', 'end', ""'Cap"", 'Miss', 'Carter', 'odds', 'evil', 'spies', 'FBI', 'male', 'chauvinists', 'too', 'gasp', 'absolute', 'little', 'gem.In', 'addition', 'generous', 'selection', 'usual', ""'making-of"", 'clips', 'outtakes', 'However', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'were', 'clips', 'Downey', 'vamping', 'scenes', 'mile-a-minute', 'version', 'ended', 'up', 'theatrical', 'release', '.Top', 'bottom', '3', 'hours', 'soaring', 'solid', 'action', 'entertainment.That', ""'m"", 'bloody', 'soapbox', 'PJA']",N/A

There was a lot of intense action, some really funny lines and another look at an aspect of Tony Stark that makes him even more relatable as a person. The essence of Tony Stark/Iron Man from the comics is still there in the movie. Sure, there were some twists that some may not have enjoyed. But when fleshed out were really funny.

He did a great job on this one. But, the writing, script etc was a bit confusing. Not to mention that I remember from the comic books a guy named Mandarin who was an actual guy who wanted world domination etc. This story deviated from that whole scenario quite a bit. ***Spoiler Alert the whole Mandarin as a actor/fool just took something away from the Iron Man storyline, and to be honest I found it confusing. Why not let Mandarin be Mandarin. Why did they need another person who hid behind his persona? There was no need for that unless they were looking for filler. There is a great but unrealistic connection with a little boy whose' garage Tony Stark ends up in. And, how is it he had to drag the iron man costume around. I remember the costume used to fold up into a briefcase. There were way too many conflicting pieces to this Iron Man. Conflicting in the sense that they conflicted with the comic book version that I remembered. When Iron Man landed on the ground in the ice and snow, his suit began to fail. Ok, he got out. Then the suit should have folded up into a neat compact suit that could be carried. Perhaps because this was an experimental suit, maybe I could buy that. Then there was the scene where he saves something like 17 people who are blown out of an airplane, very unrealistic, but hey it's a comic book movie, I'll accept it. That is, until the train shatters his suit and we find out. . . HE WASN'T IN IN IT!!!!!  Talk about confusing and misleading. There were many other plot holes. What does picking up that little tiny piece at the end really symbolize, certainly not what I think it was supposed to. (Have to watch the movie to find out that spoiler).  **** End Spoiler Alert.  All in all I will buy this one when it comes out, only because I want to see it again. That and I own every Marvel Movie that has been put out, so why not this one too? Should you buy it, I think there is enough fun in this one that justifies buying it when it comes down to about $5 or maybe as part of a multi-pack unless you have the others already like I do.Ralph J.

1559703,A39W3263A9HCMN,B008JFUO72,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 8]","Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, ""things are different now, and I'm a different man"". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in ""The Avengers"", and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits.

1559704,A14WVDQ9TWYB93,B008JFUO72,Rezivor,"[4, 12]","Took my son & girlfriend to see Iron Man 3 yesterday in theaters. They both said it is their favorite Iron Man of the 3 films. I enjoyed it a lot. Yet I felt it wasn't how I had expected it to be. The film is packed with action,some humor,great special effects,ect..! But if your like me (& my son) and read and collect comics (including Iron Man). Then you may feel how I do. The villain in this Iron Man is Mandarin (or is it?). The film starts off with Stark saying how he had made a enemy without even knowing it. It. Reflects on a part of his life (New Years eve 1999). After a few minutes, the film is back to current times. As the film progresses. Tony has difficulty sleeping. And also has some occasional panic attacks. Still kinda easing over what had happened in The Avengers film. ""Mandarin"" taps into TV stations air waves & shows clips of war,corruption,ect..while talking about how America is bad. Tony (Iron Man) pretty quickly is approached by media, & threatens Mandarin. Evn giving Mandarin an invitation to bring the fight to him @ his house, then gives out his house address. Some choppers soon start to attack Tony (and Pepper & a another character) while they are inside Tony's house. Tony is believed to be dead. He winds up passing out in his suit, as it is going to a destination. He met a kid while breaking into a garage to repair his suit. The kid ends up helping him out. Meanwhile Rhodey (Iron Patriot/War Machine) is supposed to protect the president. As the film progresses, Tony encounters a few enemies which body heats up. Eventually Stark (Iron Man) works his way to where Mandarin is. However, his suit is recharging in the kid's garage. He encounters ""Mandarin"" and finds out that this man is just an actor protraying as Mandarin. Pepper get's abducted by the real Mandarin. She also is starting to have Mandarin's methods of making skin heat up, done to her. Rhodey loses his Iron Patriot suit to the real Mandarin. And Tony,Rhodey, a army of Stark's Iron Man suits (controlled by Stark) end up all being where Pepper,the president (who also was abducted) and the real Mandarin. Of course a big battle ensues & in the end justice prevails. However, it is Pepper doing some major butt-kicking at the very end! All in all good, solid film. But those that follow comic book story lines may not like the adaptation they see of Mandarin. The ""real"" Mandarin in this film is not even like the Mandarin from the comic storyline. The actor looks like the comic version. And the ""real"" one in the film does not look like him or anything. He didn't have Mandarin's rings or nothing! I was able to look past these differences and enjoy the film. Others however say it ruined the film. Also some don't like that Tony isn't in his suit nearly as much this time. And when he is, it get's ruined shortly after. Aso Rhodey doesn't do much at all in the War Machine/ Iron Patriot suit.  Some may say that if it were more true to the comic storyline, it would be predictable. That's true. But I feel it could've been more true to the comic (character-wise) and comic story line in some ways. But add other elements to make the story/plot different for those that do read the comics! Overall I'd give it a 4 or 4.5 out of 5. I collect & read comics, and still look forward to buying the Blu-ray and watching it again! Is it the best of the 3 films!?! To some yes, to others it is the worst. It all boils down to personal opinions. For me I don't feel it is the best. However, I really like all 3 so I don't know the order of best-worst for me, they all rock!",4,"Great flick, a few things could've been different, but still, awesome!",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,3579,"['Took', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'yesterday', 'theaters', 'said', 'favorite', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'how', 'had', 'expected', 'be', 'film', 'packed', 'action', 'humor', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'ect..', 'son', 'read', 'collect', 'comics', 'including', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Then', 'may', 'feel', 'how', 'do', 'villain', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Mandarin', 'film', 'Stark', 'saying', 'how', 'had', 'made', 'enemy', 'even', 'knowing', 'part', 'life', 'New', 'Years', 'eve', '1999', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'back', 'current', 'times', 'film', 'Tony', 'difficulty', 'sleeping', 'also', 'occasional', 'panic', 'attacks', 'Still', 'easing', 'over', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Avengers', 'film', 'Mandarin', 'TV', 'stations', 'air', 'clips', 'war', 'corruption', 'talking', 'how', 'America', 'bad', 'Tony', 'Iron', 'Man', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'approached', 'media', 'Mandarin', 'Evn', 'giving', 'Mandarin', 'invitation', 'bring', 'fight', '@', 'house', 'then', 'out', 'house', 'address', 'choppers', 'soon', 'start', 'attack', 'Tony', 'Pepper', 'character', 'are', 'inside', 'Tony', 'house', 'Tony', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'up', 'passing', 'out', 'suit', 'going', 'destination', 'met', 'kid', 'breaking', 'garage', 'repair', 'suit', 'kid', 'up', 'helping', 'out', 'Meanwhile', 'Rhodey', 'Iron', 'Patriot/War', 'Machine', 'supposed', 'protect', 'president', 'film', 'Tony', 'few', 'enemies', 'body', 'up', 'Eventually', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'way', 'where', 'Mandarin', 'However', 'suit', 'recharging', 'kid', 'garage', 'Mandarin', 'out', 'man', 'just', 'actor', 'protraying', 'Mandarin', 'Pepper', 'get', 'abducted', 'real', 'Mandarin', 'also', 'starting', 'have', 'Mandarin', 'methods', 'making', 'skin', 'heat', 'up', 'done', 'Rhodey', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'suit', 'real', 'Mandarin', 'Tony', 'Rhodey', 'army', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suits', 'controlled', 'Stark', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'where', 'Pepper', 'president', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'abducted', 'real', 'Mandarin', 'course', 'big', 'battle', 'end', 'justice', 'prevails', 'However', 'Pepper', 'doing', 'major', 'butt-kicking', 'very', 'end', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'follow', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'lines', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'adaptation', 'see', 'Mandarin', 'real', 'Mandarin', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'Mandarin', 'comic', 'storyline', 'actor', 'comic', 'version', 'real', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'look', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mandarin', 'rings', 'nothing', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'differences', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Others', 'however', 'say', 'ruined', 'film', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tony', ""n't"", 'suit', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'get', 'ruined', 'shortly', 'Aso', 'Rhodey', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'War', 'Machine/', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'suit', 'may', 'say', 'were', 'more', 'true', 'comic', 'storyline', 'would', 'be', 'predictable', 'true', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'true', 'comic', 'character-wise', 'comic', 'story', 'line', 'ways', 'other', 'elements', 'make', 'story/plot', 'different', 'do', 'read', 'comics', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'give', '4', '4.5', '5', 'collect', 'read', 'comics', 'still', 'look', 'forward', 'buying', 'Blu-ray', 'watching', 'again', 'best', '3', 'films', 'yes', 'others', 'worst', 'down', 'personal', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'best', 'However', 'really', '3', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'order', 'best-worst', 'rock']",N/A

I do not mind a good twist, but the one in Iron Man 3 is far from good. When do we see the Mandarin? That was the question since the first Iron Man movie. I read somewhere that they did not want to use him because the magic rings would be a silly thing. I think that would have been great, technology vs magic. Anyway, they took Iron Man's greatest enemy and turned him into a joke. A bad one.Ben Kingsley is a great actor, but his talent was wasted here. The story could have been based on the entire Extremis  plot, why mix it up with a fake Mandarin? That scene where Kingsley is coming out of the bathroom, the audience is laughing and my friends look at me and ask: THIS IS THE MANDARIN? You know there is something wrong when everyone is laughing in a movie like this one. It felt like we were watching a parody of Iron Man.It is like tropic thunder, Kingsley is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude. It also reminds me of this other movie (Wag the dog). Is Marvel going to do this often? One good movie, let's do a bad one now. Do not hate me, it is just my opinion and I would like to know about yours.

It has a talented cast and good cinematography. Special effects are over the top as usual for today's action movies. Once in a while it would be nice to see a plot or some interesting dialogue.

About the only films that have maintained any quality was the Indiana Jones series, which also deteriorated with the last one. The Matrix, while a great initial offering, soon began to smell worse with each sequel. I really enjoyed Iron Man. I liked the plot, the actors and the originality. Iron Man 2, not nearly so much. Iron Man 3, forget about it. However, it's not called show art. It's called show business and when Hollywood has a winner, the first thing they do is to wring every last dime out of it.

So let's start with a list of retcons.1. Tony is back in Malibu, his original house, not the Stark Tower built in Avengers.2. Tony has anxiety attacks rather than physical problems to solve.3. His armor splits into pieces that fly and operate on their own rather than being powered by 1 arc reactor.4. War Machine opens like the armor in Avengers, but War Machine is the Mark I and we know how that has to be opened by an external machine seen in Iron Man I.5. Pepper isn't familiar with Tony's former girlfriends and disapproves of them...but she was his personal assistant who 'took out the trash' with them multiple times, and even said that lifestyle was 'ok.'6. Tony becomes stupid, not remembering how his own tech works and has to be reminded by Jarvis, and can't even take down 3 pathetic attack helicopters when he is in his newest armor. And he knows the attack is coming, because he invited the Mandarin 'to his house.'7. The armor isn't air tight, and he gets water in it. In Iron man I and Avengers he goes into space, therefore it is air tight.8. The armor can now be cut in half by the touch of a very hot hand...but only got nicked a bit by Whiplash's energized lashes.9. Tony can't seem to measure distance, because he tells Pepper to let go and he'll catch her, then he misses by a mile with no outside interference. The man is a mechanical genius and has an eye for detail, yet he overestimates the reach of his arm by half a meter? No.10. War Machine can be worn and operated by anyone, not just Tony and Rhodey, including the President.11. Tony building in his workshop is now obsessive behavior jeopardizing his relationship with Pepper.12. Tony's armor is now a 'cocoon' that is holding him back in life.13. The armor and being Iron man is now holding him back from being with Pepper. In Avengers she encourages him to 'do his homework.'14. Tony can have surgery to remove the shrapnel in his chest...this is a big one, and directly contradicts Iron man I and II. In II Tony was dying because he had to have the arc reactor in his chest. Why not have the surgery then?15. Being a superhero, saving the day and people's lives, is now a negative. That's not the Iron man we saw in Avengers who has accepted his role and is happy with it.16. Rhodey leaves the fight to get the President away from harm...and never comes back to help. That is not his character, who would never leave Tony hanging.17. Pepper suddenly turns into a badass fighter with moves that she had no right pulling off.18. Iron Man doesn't do combat missions anymore. Suddenly that's War Machine's job.19. Iron Man's plethora of weapons in his armor suddenly disappears.20. General physics, which was adhered to pretty well in Iron man I, II, and Avengers get thrown out the window with Extremis.Overall, the theme is 'being a superhero is a temporary cool thing that becomes a negative and must be abandoned in order to live a happy, normal life.' By the end of the movie Tony's armor is a bad thing that he has to destroy to get his life back, get Pepper back, and fully heal. THAT isn't Iron Man, and is completely contradictory to what we see in I, II, and Avengers. This movie takes a superhero and turns him into a broken man who has to return to the bliss that is 'being normal,' and that is a total betrayal of the series and of the character.This is a movie I really wish hadn't been made and that I hadn't seen. It leaves a sick feeling in your stomach afterwards, and a sense of WTF just happened?

This movies storyline is very messy and all over the place. It has no real focus. The movie leaves you with more questions than answers. The origins of the bad guys are unanswered and are misleading. The entire movie is a quirky mess. However, just for the pure sake of entertainment it will fill your time very well. I thought this movie was too long; I just wanted it to end after the first hour, which seemed like 2hours because it was so dry. The real action occurs (in) the last 20 minutes of a 2 hour movie. All acting, sets, props, wardrobe, make-up, and effects were spot on. This was NOT the best Iron man movie...they really need to come up with a solid storyline for a Billionaire (man-child) and his flying super suit, with nothing better to do. I definitely will not be watching this movie again; it really was NOT that good, it was downright disappointing. This movie was pieces of strung together special effects, added here and there, but lacking a storyline to tie it all together. However, on a boring Friday night, it makes ideal entertainment.

Then halfway through, it just kind of fell apart, Mandarin was a joke (literally a drug addict/alcoholic actor named Trevor? REALLY?!), the kid's acting progressively got worse, the plot just kind of vanished, Pepper Potts gets powers, Killian shoots fire from his mouth, hundreds of Iron Man suits flying through the air getting destroyed, no development on Rhodey, etc.I can't really blame the actors for what happened, but I can blame Shane Black. Shane Black is known for his  action/comedy flicks &#34;Lethal Weapon&#34;, &#34;The Long Kiss Goodnight&#34;, &#34;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#34;, etc. So there was promise when Jon Favreau stepped down as director and named Shane Black as the new director for Iron Man. Little did I know that this was a mistake, however I should've seen it coming. Admittedly Iron Man is supposed to have comedy because of Stark's snarky comments and such, but when you have to rely on fart jokes, that's pretty sad.I can't really give it a 1 star because Downey's acting was fantastic, as usual, and the beginning half of the movie was just perfect and what I expected from the Iron Man movie. However I can't give it a 3 or 4 star either because the rest of the movie was literally just the biggest middle finger to fans of Iron Man.I can't really recommend anyone watch this, but do as you will.

I will say that Tony Stark has to be the most prepared guy in the universe.After further improvements in his armor and even getting to a point where the armor comes to him and parts of it can act independently, we find the only reason he's doing this is to immerse himself on what he does well - a mechanism for controlling is panic attacks!We forget sometimes that Tony is just a guy.  A very smart guy but really behind that superior faade it must be a shock that there are aliens and gods in the universe and that he was barely able to hold his own with the technology that he has to hand.Rather than being an advertisement for the earlier Avengers film (and that would be a natural conclusion, LOL), it's similar to Ironman 2 - an exploration into Tony the man.I love the Marvel films because they are more than about the heroics.

1559782,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B008JFUO72,Sean Pasek,"[7, 11]","Of the Iron Man the trilogy, the first film is still the best one.  It has a great balance of story, characterization, and action.  However, even in saying that, there is still only one film that, in my opinion, has given us the best and most complete version of Iron Man, and that was ""The Avengers,"" which is still my favorite film with Iron Man (who has always been my favorite superhero).Any time that you sacrifice story for special effects or human connection for spectacle, you end up with a very flat story and film.  George Lucas once stated shortly after the first Star Wars film in 1977 that ""special effects without a good story is a pretty boring thing.""  There is a lot of irony in that statement since he largely broke his own ""rule"" with his latest trilogy, which is also why the newer trilogy is largely considered to be quite inferior to the previous one.Iron Man 3 delves deeply into the mind and psyche of Tony Stark.  We already know that he is a man of great wealth and intellect, who often prefers a drink in his hand or a one-night stand at his side, than to have to deal with any real human connection.  This is an aspect of the character that is largely taken from the comic book storyline of Tony Stark.  In a very real sense, it can be distilled down to ""the man vs. the machine,"" which ironically, is a theme that has been addressed in many science fiction and fantasy storylines.The principal villain of this film is a terrorist known as The Mandarin who is assisted by and orchestrated by AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics), founded by Aldrich Killian (wonderfully portrayed by Guy Pearce) who wishes to demonstrate an unnatural union between scientific advancement and human biology.Tony Stark's world is turned upside down by the Mandarin who instigates an attack upon Tony at his Malibu beach home.  The attack is well orchestrated as we see Tony struggle to save himself, but also the one person in his life that he realizes that he loves even more than himself: Pepper Potts.With many of his suits of armor destroyed, and stuck with his most advanced, yet non-working, M-42 suit of armor, Tony must figure out a way to, not only find out who has masterminded the attacks, but how to stop them and get his life back...largely without the use of the armor that he has become so largely dependent on.Tony Stark realizes how fragile his life is, and how dependent he has become upon his armor.  Perhaps so much so, that he has forgotten the human aspects of himself.  He has done a tremendous amount of good in the world, since the invention of his armor and the alteration of his company's ideals and mission.  However, Tony is also forced to come to terms with his own mortality, which is largely exacerbated by the trauma of nearly being killed in New York while fighting to save the Earth alongside his fellow Avengers.There isn't a whole lot of Iron Man in this film, and those who were really looking forward to seeing a lot of Iron Man may find this film to be largely disappointing.  Iron Man 3 could easily be titled ""Tony Stark,"" because the film's story is about him, not Iron Man.  Robert Downy Jr., who has already immortalized himself as Tony Stark/Iron Man gives us a greater depth of that character than has ever been done before.  And, of course, his performance is as magnificent as it ever has been.The film does have a number of moments that you may find yourself ""raising your eyebrows"" at; situations that just don't seem to fit or situations that might detract from the story.  These elements prevent, in my opinion, this film from becoming even better than it is.Iron Man 3 works because it focuses on the human elements; the connection that the viewer feels with and for Tony Stark; his constant inner battle with who he is and what is really important in his life.  Perhaps he even succeeds in realizing that Iron Man may very well be a part of him, but Iron Man is not all that he is.  And Pepper greatly serves Tony by, perhaps, being the only person to realize this and accept both Tony and Iron Man for who they are.Joss  Whedon gave us an exciting Iron Man as well as a fallible and all-too-human Iron Man/Tony Stark in ""The Avengers"".  We have already seen Tony at his most charming, most selfish, most defensive, most exciting, and most self-sacrificing self.  Iron Man 3 gives us Tony at his most vulnerable state.  And perhaps that is why we can relate to him so well, because facing and dealing with our own vulnerable states is most often that one thing which we most fear to do.",4,Iron Man At His Most Vulnerable Is Done Quite Well,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,4543,"['Iron', 'Man', 'trilogy', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'best', 'one', 'great', 'balance', 'story', 'characterization', 'action', 'However', 'even', 'saying', 'still', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'opinion', 'given', 'best', 'most', 'complete', 'version', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'Avengers', 'still', 'favorite', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'superhero', '.Any', 'time', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'human', 'connection', 'spectacle', 'end', 'up', 'very', 'flat', 'story', 'film', 'George', 'Lucas', 'once', 'stated', 'shortly', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', '1977', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'story', 'pretty', 'boring', 'thing', 'lot', 'irony', 'statement', 'largely', 'broke', 'own', 'rule', 'latest', 'trilogy', 'also', 'why', 'newer', 'trilogy', 'largely', 'considered', 'be', 'quite', 'inferior', 'previous', 'one.Iron', 'Man', '3', 'deeply', 'mind', 'psyche', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'already', 'know', 'man', 'great', 'wealth', 'intellect', 'who', 'often', 'drink', 'hand', 'one-night', 'stand', 'side', 'have', 'deal', 'real', 'human', 'connection', 'aspect', 'character', 'largely', 'taken', 'comic', 'book', 'storyline', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'can', 'be', 'distilled', 'down', 'man', 'machine', 'ironically', 'theme', 'been', 'addressed', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'storylines.The', 'principal', 'villain', 'film', 'terrorist', 'known', 'Mandarin', 'who', 'assisted', 'orchestrated', 'AIM', 'Advanced', 'Idea', 'Mechanics', 'founded', 'Aldrich', 'Killian', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'unnatural', 'union', 'scientific', 'advancement', 'human', 'biology.Tony', 'Stark', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'Mandarin', 'who', 'attack', 'Tony', 'Malibu', 'beach', 'home', 'attack', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'see', 'Tony', 'struggle', 'save', 'also', 'one', 'person', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'Pepper', 'Potts.With', 'many', 'suits', 'armor', 'destroyed', 'stuck', 'most', 'advanced', 'yet', 'non-working', 'M-42', 'suit', 'armor', 'Tony', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'masterminded', 'attacks', 'how', 'stop', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'largely', 'use', 'armor', 'become', 'so', 'largely', 'dependent', 'on.Tony', 'Stark', 'how', 'fragile', 'life', 'how', 'dependent', 'become', 'armor', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'much', 'forgotten', 'human', 'aspects', 'done', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'good', 'world', 'invention', 'armor', 'alteration', 'company', 'ideals', 'mission', 'However', 'Tony', 'also', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'mortality', 'largely', 'exacerbated', 'trauma', 'nearly', 'being', 'killed', 'New', 'York', 'fighting', 'save', 'Earth', 'alongside', 'fellow', 'Avengers.There', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'lot', 'Iron', 'Man', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'largely', 'disappointing', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'titled', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr.', 'who', 'already', 'immortalized', 'Tony', 'Stark/Iron', 'Man', 'greater', 'depth', 'character', 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'course', 'performance', 'as', 'magnificent', 'ever', 'been.The', 'film', 'have', 'number', 'moments', 'may', 'find', 'raising', 'eyebrows', 'situations', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'situations', 'might', 'detract', 'story', 'elements', 'prevent', 'opinion', 'film', 'becoming', 'even', 'better', 'Man', '3', 'human', 'elements', 'connection', 'viewer', 'feels', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'constant', 'inner', 'battle', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'realizing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'part', 'Iron', 'Man', 'not', 'Pepper', 'greatly', 'Tony', 'perhaps', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'realize', 'accept', 'Tony', 'Iron', 'Man', 'who', 'are.Joss', 'Whedon', 'gave', 'exciting', 'Iron', 'Man', 'as', 'well', 'fallible', 'all-too-human', 'Iron', 'Man/Tony', 'Stark', 'Avengers', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Tony', 'most', 'charming', 'most', 'selfish', 'most', 'defensive', 'most', 'exciting', 'most', 'self-sacrificing', 'self', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Tony', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'perhaps', 'why', 'can', 'relate', 'so', 'well', 'facing', 'dealing', 'own', 'vulnerable', 'states', 'most', 'often', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'fear', 'do']",N/A

Iron Man 3 for me was lacking in what made Iron Man, Iron Man. I will say however I do get WHY they decided to go this route with the movie, however I think it was a little over done and lacking in certain areas.Pros:-I LOVED the visuals in this movie. Some of the best I've ever seen.-I liked the different twists this movie had to offer.-I wasn't that big on comics, I watch a movie for entertainment value and AT the theaters I liked the Mandarin Twist.-RDJ does his best Tony Stark yet, and the cast was a really good fit.Cons:-NO point for having war mach...I mean Iron Patriot in this movie except to use him as a plot device. WHY give him a big shoulder canon if he isn't going to use it.-Not enough Tech. I know Stark is mentally broken after the events in NY so I DO understand his suite will have glitches as well as his home security (which by the way that scene was just phenomenal), but I mean ALL of his gadgets break?-After re-watching the movie I saw that that the mandarin plot was dragged on for TOO long until the twist. They should have found a better way to deal with it. Mandarin was set up to be the biggest threat Tony ever faced yet they just used him as a gimmick for a guy that has a grudge against him?-There is ONE deleted scene that should have made it to the final product and they dropped the ball on it. It was the scene with the kid and his bullies. THAT scene would have added so much more depth, character, and relationship to Tony and The Kid.Overall I bought it to complete the trilogy and I give it a solid 7.9-8.1 just because the Blu-Ray features made it a must own.",4,Story and Plot was decent...Direction was Lacking,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1703,"['First', 'movie', 'only', 'garnered', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'due', 'Blu-Ray', 'Special', 'Features', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'was', 'lacking', 'what', 'made', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'do', 'get', 'WHY', 'decided', 'go', 'route', 'movie', 'however', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'done', 'lacking', 'certain', 'areas.Pros', '-I', 'LOVED', 'visuals', 'movie', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.-I', 'liked', 'different', 'twists', 'movie', 'had', 'offer.-I', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'big', 'comics', 'watch', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value', 'AT', 'theaters', 'liked', 'Mandarin', 'Twist.-RDJ', 'best', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'yet', 'cast', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'fit.Cons', '-NO', 'point', 'having', 'war', 'mach', 'mean', 'Iron', 'Patriot', 'movie', 'use', 'plot', 'device', 'WHY', 'give', 'big', 'shoulder', 'canon', ""n't"", 'going', 'use', 'it.-Not', 'enough', 'Tech', 'know', 'Stark', 'mentally', 'broken', 'events', 'NY', 'DO', 'understand', 'suite', 'will', 'have', 'glitches', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'security', 'way', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'mean', 'gadgets', 'break', '-After', 're-watching', 'movie', 'saw', 'mandarin', 'plot', 'was', 'dragged', 'TOO', 'long', 'twist', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'way', 'deal', 'Mandarin', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'biggest', 'threat', 'Tony', 'ever', 'faced', 'yet', 'just', 'used', 'gimmick', 'guy', 'grudge', 'ONE', 'deleted', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'product', 'dropped', 'ball', 'was', 'scene', 'kid', 'bullies', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'relationship', 'Tony', 'Kid.Overall', 'bought', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'give', 'solid', '7.9-8.1', 'just', 'Blu-Ray', 'features', 'made', 'must', 'own']",N/A

And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly. There's a bit more cheese and silliness in Iron Man 3 than the first two, but it all still works well.Who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr.? Man, does he nail the role of Stark or what?! The rest of the cast, especially villain Guy Pearce, was terrific. Pearce does a great comic book-esque bad guy. Don Cheadle (Iron Patriot) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) add some nice flavor to this installment, but I gotta say, the less I see of them in an iron suit in any subsequent films the better.Iron Man 3 picks up whereMarvel's The Avengersleft off and has Stark dealing with two issues: 1) Post traumatic stress disorder, and 2) A slighted scientist from his past. Oh, and a third issue is a terrorist called The Mandarin that ultimately twists beautifully into the film. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written and Shane Black in the director's chair keeps the viewer clamoring more of Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years.Iron Man 3 may not be the best in the Iron Man or Marvel Superhero franchise, but it's still a great movie.

With that in mind, I was looking very forward to the Mandarin as the villain in Iron Man Three.The Mandarin, for all intents and purposes, is Iron Man's nemesis. He pre-dates the Iron Man comic book just as Iron Man does [Iron Man made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39, the Mandarin in issue #50], so I was expecting something... well, I was expecting something epic. Iron Man's greatest foe and all of that. That is not even close to what Marvel delivered with this movie, and I can't say more than that without offering spoilers. Let's just say that I was... disappointed with the Mandarin, especially given that it was Ben Kingsley. Not that Kingsley didn't do a great job; he did. I mean, he was fantastic in the role that they wrote for him; it just wasn't the role I wanted to see him in.Here's the thing, for most of you out there, the vast most of you, the most of you that didn't spend more than a decade reading Iron Man comic books, there will be no issue with the role of the Mandarin at all. See, it works great in the movie. Which is what causes my divergence of opinion. On the one hand, I'm disappointed with the portrayal of the Mandarin, but, on the other, Iron Man Three was completely enjoyable to watch and has a lot going for it. In my head, I know that the continuity that the Marvel movies is setting up is not the same as it is in the comics, but that doesn't change my emotional reaction to it. The &#34;why did they change that?&#34; reaction.Of course, it's comic books, and, maybe, they didn't change anything. It is conceivable that the Mandarin will still become who and what he is in a later movie. Or, maybe, he's that, now, but they're just hiding it.As for the movie itself, it was quite good. Robert Downey, Jr. was amazing as always. It's a more personal movie than the previous two in a lot of ways. Tony is dealing with... issues, mostly brought on by his experiences in New York during the alien invasion in The Avengers. For much of the movie, he's effectively alone without any armor, and it was interesting to see Tony operating as a person rather than an iron man. Downey pulled that off with what appeared to be effortless ease.Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle were respectable in their roles. Even Guy Pearce was adequate. Okay, probably more than adequate, but I really don't like the guy, so, when he plays a villain, he gets an automatic boost from me in that regard, so I actually have a difficult time in telling whether he's doing a good job or not, because I'm not going to like him anyway. I'll know that he can actually act if he ever bothers to play a good guy and he can make me like him. And, as I stated, Ben Kingsley was amazing. He really was.Iron Man Three is slightly different in structure than the other two. It starts with an opening narration, and I don't tend to be fond of narration in movies. Of course, it ties in with the way the movie ends, which almost makes it worth it, but not quite. It also starts and, then, jumps back, which I'm also not fond of, but, at least, it didn't do a &#34;three days earlier&#34; or anything like that.Also, the CGI is a bit... clunky... in this one. I didn't know why until I got home and looked it up: ILM did not do the effects on this one. Now, that is something I completely don't understand. ILM did the effects for both other Iron Man movies and The Avengers, so why switch when Disney owns ILM, now? If it was that they were too busy with the new Star Wars, I could understand, but they have at least half a dozen films coming out this year that they're doing the effects for, so having someone else do this Iron Man seems odd to me. Oh, well, I'm sure it was cheaper. It's always about the money, right?So, yeah, as a movie, I liked it. It's great, in fact. But that doesn't stop me from being ambivalent.",4,Ironbivalence,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,4269,"['One', 'things', 'Marvel', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'series', 'movies', 'been', 'keep', 'characters', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'say', 'Marvel', 'sense', 'movies', 'Marvel', 'done', 'not', 'sense', 'characters', 'look', 'what', 'Sony', 'did', 'Wolverine', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'again', 'summer', 'will', 'find', 'non-Marvel', 'companies', 'have', 'not', 'handled', 'characters', 'quite', 'so', 'faithfully', 'mind', 'was', 'looking', 'very', 'forward', 'Mandarin', 'villain', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Three.The', 'Mandarin', 'intents', 'purposes', 'Iron', 'Man', 'nemesis', 'Iron', 'Man', 'comic', 'book', 'just', 'Iron', 'Man', '[', 'Iron', 'Man', 'made', 'first', 'appearance', 'Tales', 'Suspense', '39', 'Mandarin', 'issue', '50', ']', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'well', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'epic', 'Iron', 'Man', 'greatest', 'foe', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'what', 'Marvel', 'delivered', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'offering', 'spoilers', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Mandarin', 'especially', 'given', 'was', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Not', 'Kingsley', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'job', 'did', 'mean', 'was', 'fantastic', 'role', 'wrote', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'role', 'wanted', 'see', 'in.Here', 'thing', 'most', 'there', 'vast', 'most', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'decade', 'reading', 'Iron', 'Man', 'comic', 'books', 'will', 'be', 'issue', 'role', 'Mandarin', 'See', 'great', 'movie', 'Which', 'what', 'divergence', 'opinion', 'one', 'hand', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'portrayal', 'Mandarin', 'other', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Three', 'was', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'lot', 'going', 'head', 'know', 'continuity', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'setting', 'up', 'not', 'same', 'comics', ""n't"", 'change', 'emotional', 'reaction', '34', 'why', 'did', 'change', '34', 'reaction.Of', 'course', 'comic', 'books', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'anything', 'conceivable', 'Mandarin', 'will', 'still', 'become', 'who', 'what', 'later', 'movie', 'maybe', 'now', ""'re"", 'just', 'hiding', 'it.As', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'amazing', 'always', 'more', 'personal', 'movie', 'previous', 'two', 'lot', 'ways', 'Tony', 'dealing', 'issues', 'mostly', 'brought', 'experiences', 'New', 'York', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Avengers', 'much', 'movie', 'effectively', 'alone', 'armor', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Tony', 'operating', 'person', 'rather', 'iron', 'man', 'Downey', 'pulled', 'off', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'effortless', 'ease.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'were', 'respectable', 'roles', 'Even', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'was', 'adequate', 'Okay', 'probably', 'more', 'adequate', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'guy', 'so', 'when', 'villain', 'automatic', 'boost', 'regard', 'actually', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'telling', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'like', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'know', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'ever', 'play', 'good', 'guy', 'can', 'make', 'stated', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'amazing', 'really', 'was.Iron', 'Man', 'Three', 'slightly', 'different', 'structure', 'other', 'two', 'opening', 'narration', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'be', 'fond', 'narration', 'movies', 'course', 'way', 'movie', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'also', 'then', 'jumps', 'back', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fond', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', '34', 'three', 'days', 'earlier', '34', 'anything', 'that.Also', 'CGI', 'bit', 'clunky', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'got', 'home', 'looked', 'up', 'ILM', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'effects', 'one', 'Now', 'something', 'completely', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'ILM', 'did', 'effects', 'other', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Avengers', 'so', 'why', 'switch', 'when', 'Disney', 'ILM', 'now', 'was', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'could', 'understand', 'have', 'least', 'dozen', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'year', ""'re"", 'doing', 'effects', 'so', 'having', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'Iron', 'Man', 'odd', 'Oh', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'cheaper', 'always', 'money', 'right', 'So', 'yeah', 'movie', 'liked', 'great', 'fact', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'ambivalent']",N/A

Iron Man 3 confirmed all of my fears. Why, it isn't even an Iron Man movie! It is a Tony Stark movie, and a poor one at that. The plot is very poor and at many times during the movie you are just left thinking to yourself, ""what is the point of this scene?"" The movie is filled with cliches that make you wanna drown a bag of puppies, and just when you think it's over Shane Black just shoves another one down your throat.

Rickles,"[3, 5]","This may be the best of the three Iron Man Films to date, and in this reviewer's opinion, certainly one of the most meaningful and entertaining theater releases of the 2013 summer season. Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark is back. However, gnawing at him are the post-traumatic effects of his exposure to the aliens and worm-hole stresses of his work with the Avengers in New York (as experienced in the earlier Marvel's The Avengers film of last year). The effects on his life range from an inability to sleep, to a constant tinkering with variations of his Iron Man robotic suits (reflecting a heightened focus on insulating his body) and an inadvertent distancing of himself from the woman he truly loves, Pepper Potts. And into this uncertain time in his life comes a new threat to world peace who will only identify himself as the mysterious ""Mandarin"" and who Tony learns uses ex-soldiers as unknowing human bombs to accomplish his agenda.  Worse yet, as Downey Jr./Stark narrates from the very film's outset, it's all the result of Stark's own past carelessness with others coming to bite him back in the present. Tony takes a pasting in his initial battles with the Mandarin before realizing the true influence behind the Mandarin's overt terrorist attacks. Along with Robert Downey Jr.'s and Gwyneth Paltrow's own strong acting and familiarity with their roles, the characters and film are abetted by the enjoyable involvement of a ""wiser-than-his-years"" fun ten-year old boy. Despite all his gusto, and all his wealth, Tony Stark has to dig deep within himself, to his own core innovativeness to rescue himself and his world and resolve the obscured complexities he's become enmeshed in - personal and collective. This film offers enthralling action in the tradition of the best of the Iron Man films, and it's also great storytelling with a very human and wonderful moral tale.  The films' resolution is visually and morally uplifting!

1559864,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUO72,The People's Critic,"[3, 7]","I remember being a child reading Marvel comic books by the dozens.  I'm going to get a little nostalgic now, so if you're just interested in a review of the film, move on to the next paragraph.  I'd go to comic books stores weekly to get my favorite issues and become immersed in the stories and the artwork.  The static images were vibrant in my mind, and occasionally as I imagined the action between the comic panels, I'd ponder how glorious it would be to see my favorite heroes come to life.  It seemed like a pipe dream, but now it seems that the day has actually come.  Iron Man 3 represents the eighth spectacular achievement in the Avengers vein by Marvel studios as they revolutionize the concept of the film franchise.  The cinematic universe that Marvel studios has created achieves a detailed serial nature usually reserved for complex television dramas.  The success of these films is often attributed to their effects and unyielding action.  Nevertheless, the greatest titles, Iron Man 3 being one of them, deserve their status because of clever writing and character development.Iron Man 3 finally finds the suited up superhero, Tony Stark pitted against his greatest nemesis, The Mandarin.  While Iron Man's battle with The Mandarin in the comics dates back to 1964, The Mandarin's role in Iron Man's cinematic adventures has only been hinted at in the previous two films.  Thanks to clever and creative writing from director Shane Black and screenwriter Drew Pearce as well as a superb performance by the great Ben Kingsley, The Mandarin was well worth the wait...and that's all I'll say.For the sake of keeping Iron Man 3's impact in tact, plot should be discussed minimally.  What can be said is that a new terrorist, The Mandarin is violently attacking America in order to expose what he believes is a hypocritical and offensive ideology shared by the American people.  At one point, Stark mentions that he ""sounds like a Baptist minister,"" suggesting perhaps that he's using ""crisis"" as a way to force decision, a controversial Baptist philosophy.  It gets personal when Stark's head of security, Happy Hogan (played again by Iron Man 1 & 2 director, Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in one of The Mandarin's attacks.  There is much more to the story including a minor flashback to 1999 where Stark is just hitting his stride.  It is there that he meets bourgeoning scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and ""botanist"" Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), and again...that's all I'll say.Iron Man 3 is a very smartly made film, and while it still addresses comic book staple themes like good/evil, identity, revenge, and freedom, an emergent theme can also be extracted from it - learning from mistakes.  Film series usually start to run out of steam by the third part, with few exceptions.  A third film in a series tends to be darker and excessive in regards to whatever made the first two work be it action, villains, or some sort of familiar formula.  Iron Man 3 learns from others' mistakes and avoids them.  In fact, it can be said that this film acts as a ""how-to"" manual on freshening up conventions.  In scenes where the hero is captured by henchmen who are normally silent and sinister, Shane Black and Drew Pearce devise witty and even humorous dialogue that makes those scenes enjoyable.  At one point, Iron Man must team up with a child, a move that often results in schmaltzy sentimentality, yet in the hands of Black and Pearce it works.  By the end of Iron Man 3, it is clear that these film makers are thinking quite a few moves ahead and have no intention of letting the audience down at any point.  The film has fun with Stark's Iron Man identity being public knowledge and various nods to The Avengers add another level of substance and self-referential fun.  Robert Downey Jr. has certainly found a home in his role as Stark/Iron Man.  This installment is his best as he tactfully and authentically balances humor, intensity, and sentimentality without ever missing a beat.Other favorites are back as well including Rhodey (Don Cheadle) formally War Machine, now dubbed the Iron Patriot and Stark's reliable CFO/lover Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The other star of this film is the Iron Man suit itself.  JARVIS and the suit have made some exciting and enjoyable upgrades that are quite central to the evolution of the story.  Iron Man 3 is another excellent entry into an ever-blooming genre of film.  It is entertaining, gratifying, and most of all - clever. AIron Man 3 is rated PG-13 with a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It should be seen in 2D rather than 3D as nothing is gained from the 3D transfer.

Fans of Spidey (rightly) pointed out how frequently Spidey was shown without mask, with partial mask, or with the focus being on so much of Tobey Maguire.  As Peter Parker is Spider-man and Tobey Maguire played Parker we saw a lot of Maguire, too much for the fans in fact when they believed they should have been seeing Spider-man more than they did.  So too in IM3 where Robert Downey, Jr. plays Tony Stark (who famously says ""I am Iron Man"") and we see a lot (underscored) of Tony Stark, and I mean a lot.  Is he in his armor?  Sure, quite a bit actually.  It's just that it's in various arrays of armor with faceplate up, the suit coming half off, the suit on in pieces, or the suit partially shredded.  Getting Downey, Jr. was a coup to play Stark and the best thing for the Iron Man films but he is here in the movie too much balanced against being in his armor too little.  And that's too bad because the film suffers from this push to expose Downey and get him as much face time as possible as opposed to focusing on some cool and extended shots of him inhabiting his armor.Also whereas Spider-man 1 & 2 were brightly lit and colored 3, while still quite bright, toned the colors down and brought in the metaphorical and lighted-effects of darkness.  IM3, if different, is different only in tone (a grittier all around feel) and that many more of its scenes occur at night or in darkened places.  It is like having an artist that you really enjoy drawing your comic only to have another artist step in whose style is so different that it changes the comic book tonally.  That is what has happened in this movie.  IM2 was rather heavy and dense in its themes and story but the lighted qualities drew you in and kept you interested.  In IM3 you may find that you just want some scenes to end or for it to move back into daytime lighting.Spider-man 2 threw us the curveball that Peter Parker could lose his powers if he was morally conflicted about being Spider-man and then 3 showed us his slide into becoming drunk with power.  IM3 mixes these a bit with Tony Stark using Iron Man as a real and metaphorical crutch, suffering flashbacks and panic attacks from the events of the Avengers alien attack and being briefly and momentarily in another universe.  This is an interesting and organic connection to the previous movie, with PTSD effects fouling up Stark's mental capacities and negatively effecting his choices or causing him to run into his suit to have his body scanned to see if he's dying.  I found that the story-arc around this was actually quite smart except that it didn't just ostracize him from his friends and Pepper Potts but it also ostracized the audience as well; the characters aren't happy and their personalities aren't fleshed out in this iteration as they were in the first and especially second movies.  Stark's accomplishment, if you want to call it that by end of movie (he doesn't ""need"" the Iron Man armors anymore the way that he did throughout the movie--that's all I'll say about that), leaves the viewer at movie's end with unsatisfied questions not as to what will happen next but as to what exactly did all of the quick resolutions really mean.  The brash cock-surity of Stark, something that drew the filmgoer in previously, appears to be in peril at movie's conclusion.If IM1 & 2 were more stories about redemption and realizing and holding onto meaningful relationships IM3 is about overcoming adversity and hoping to hell that you're relationships will just work out.  Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, who was Tony's righthand woman and mental/ emotional sparring partner and equal in the first two movies here is a worn, ""why am I doing this?"" tough-gal for part of the film and a damsel in distress for another part and finally the powerful heroine by movie's end (though she still needs to be saved); none of this felt fresh and IMO she never came across as Tony's equal here (she was his superior) so the relational aspect wasn't as satisfying not nearly by half.  Favreau, the previous director of the first two installments and who has given way to new director Shane Black (go back, Jon, go back!), gets a lot more screen time as former bodyguard now promoted to Stark Industries head of security.  Cheadle, in a revamped suit dubbed ""Iron Patriot"", also gets more screen time.But what of all of the Iron Man armors?  Are there a lot in the film?  Yes, a ton.  And you don't really get a good look at any of them but a brief highlight moment of a few seconds for about 5 of them outside of the main suit.  As far as this fan is concerned that was a complete waste of armor and a very unsatisfying finale to the film.  Notice that in Spider-man 3 he dons more than one suit...but at least they all get decent screentime.You may have noticed that I haven't spent a lot...or any time on the villains of the story.  For those in the know there are elements of the Extremis storyline in here; for those who don't know Extremis manipulates a person's brain's ability to amplify physical energy and regenerative ability.  Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) is using this biological technology to their own end and an Osama bin Laden type of terrorist called The Mandarin is also on hand and provides one of the film's few surprising, and humorist, plot twists.  In Spider-man 3 the way that the villains were presented and jumbled it made for too many in the stew.  I will give credit to this film for having several villains and meshing and balancing them out nicely.  Still, I wish that they were more outlandish.  Where's Mickey Rourke's Whiplash when you need him?This film wasn't horrible by any stretch of the imagination.  It just wasn't that great and definitely the inferior of the three.",3,Iron Man 3 PTSD,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,5859,"['are', 'strong', 'parrallels', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'box', 'office', 'strong',

1559886,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B008JFUO72,Tom Birkenstock,"[3, 7]","For most of the world, Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film following the massively successful Avengers film.  People the world over have waited to see how Marvel will go back to focusing on a single superhero and whether it would satisfy after last summer's superhero binge.  But for some of us Iron Man 3 is important for a very different reason.  For a few movie fans, Iron Man 3 signifies not necessarily the glorious return of a franchise superhero, but rather the reunion between star Robert Downey Jr. and director Shane Black.  You might be unfamiliar with the name Shane Black (and honestly who could forget a name like that), but you almost certainly are familiar with the movies he has scripted.  In the late eighties/early nineties Black became the highest paid screenwriter of all time.  He's most famous for his work on Lethal Weapon and its first sequel and less famous for films like The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight (although, for my money, The Last Boy Scout is entirely underrated).  His movies combined action elements popular in the eighties with a decidedly film noirish cynicism.  It was no surprise, then, when, after nearly a decade missing in action, Shane Black's first directorial effort was a post-modern noir, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.It was overshadowed by the first Iron Man, but Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was without a doubt Robert Downey Jr.'s comeback vehicle.  It may not have reached the kind of audience that a superhero film can, but it once again proved that Robert Downey Jr. possessed impeccable comedic timing and charisma to spare.  And there's a shared comedic sensibility between Downey and Black.  Both seem to revel in freewheeling and unexpected turns, quick wits and big egos.  And while Iron Man 3 is first and foremost a big budget summer blockbuster, both Black and Downey find enough space to fit their own oversized personalities.There's plenty of back story in Iron Man 3, so much in fact that a lot of information is delivered by Downey in the form of a voiceover.  The film begins at the turn of the new millennium when people were still worried about the Y2K virus and Eiffel 65's little ditty, ""Blue,"" was worming its way into our hearts.  One of the central themes of the film is how decisions have long term consequences that we aren't initially aware of, and so early on we are introduced to Maya Hansen, a genius botanist who is developing a procedure that could eventually help re-grow limbs.  We are also introduced to Aldrich Killian, played, at least in this part of the film, as socially awkward computer nerd who walks with a cane and has yet to master basic grooming techniques.  Killian makes his way onto the same elevator as Tony Stark, and he proceeds to pitch his idea for a venture capitalist start up.  In order to get rid of him, Stark promises to meet him up on the roof in a few minutes and then deliberately forgets about it.It should come as little surprise that thirteen years later Killian the socially clumsy computer nerd has become Killian the suave industrialist.  Killian has somehow cured his limp and is macking on Tony Stark's main squeeze, Pepper Potts.  Meanwhile there's a terrorist on the loose by the name of The Mandarin who has been releasing mysterious footage of himself decrying Western decadence while detonating bombs across the country with impunity.  It doesn't take much to figure out that there's a connection between The Mandarin and Killian (but things are either more or less than they seem at first).  While following one of Killian's henchmen, Stark's former body guard and friend, Happy Hogan, gets himself blowed up real good, and in a fit of rage Stark calls out The Mandarin on television, even providing his home address as a challenge.Stark's challenge is accepted, and three heavily armed helicopters show up at Stark's Frank Lloyd Wright inspired mansion and proceed to blow it up.  Stark narrowly escapes, and decides to play dead in rural Tennessee.  While convalescing in a barn, Stark strikes up a friendship with a precocious ten year old named Harvey.  Stark spends most of the film outside of the Iron Man suit, a smart move on the part of the filmmakers.  One of the chief problems with superhero films is that the superpowers can get in the way of the action.  We're never quite certain how much punishment the protagonist can take and after a while watching two nearly invulnerable people pound on each other starts to lose its appeal.  This is why it's much easier to build a movie around Batman than Superman.There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film, and I don't really want to give them away.  Shane Black is a master at setting up expectations just so he can undermine them.  (Watching Iron Man 3 a year after the Avengers got me thinking that maybe Black is the progenitor of Joss Whedon.  Both really want to pull the rug out from under the audience).  A lot of Black's personality really shines through in the film.  Like Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and A Long Kiss Goodnight, the movie takes place at Christmas (this guy loves Christmas).  Much of the dialogue consists of men exchanging quippy exchanges with one another while under nearly fatal doses of testosterone.  And Tony Stark, like Martin Riggs before him, is suffering from mental problems, a case of PTSD following the events of The Avengers.  Hell, the climax of the film even takes place at the docks.  Of course, all of Black's personality is shrouded in the wares of the Marvel Universe, but it's a good fit nonetheless.The film itself isn't perfect, exactly.  The villain's plan is ridiculously convoluted.  There are also a number of moments where the movie attempts to sublimate our collective trauma surrounding 9/11.  Terrorism is used as a plot point, but it's a mostly bloodless kind of terrorism that's meant to be exciting rather than horrific.  Perhaps the most troubling moment in the film happens when Tony Stark calls out The Mandarin, claiming that he's out for pure revenge and not politics, as if the two are mutually exclusive.  If we've learned anything after 9/11, we should have learned that vengeance is an extension of the political.  So the film might read as a piece of propaganda to some (which is true of most of the Iron Man movies) but to others it might be a fascinating depiction of America's failure to fully come to grips with 9/11 even a decade out.  But purely as a work of entertainment, Iron Man 3 is the most accomplished of the series.  Where Iron Man 1 and 2 worked best during moments of comedy and only started flailing during the action sequences, Iron Man 3 balances these two modes perfectly.  It got me thinking that this whole superhero thing might have legs after all.",5,Shane Black Takes a Stab at the Marvel Universe,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,6748,"['most', 'world', 'Iron', 'Man',

He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to ""bring it on."" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on. Overall, little things that bothered me didn't take away from the enjoyment. I give it a B+.",4,Much more realistic & darker then the others. To me that really helped the movie.

1559892,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B008JFUO72,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 6]","Note: I will update this review when I eventually get the Blu-ray.Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, things have been progressing quite nicely. It all started in 2008 with Tony Stark and his claim to fame as the fabled ""Iron Man."" But when the universe eventually escalated into something much more massive by 2012's ""The Avengers,"" an interesting philosophical quandary was posed to the genius inventor by one Steve Rogers. Essentially, the question was, ""does the man make the suit, or does the suit make the man?"" The first film showed us Stark's reason and cause for dawning the armor after he realized his direct/indirect contribution to so much destruction around the world and felt the need to repent. The second film took it slightly further by showing how he dealt with the pressure of being a publicly-known superhero, how it affected him, both, physically and mentally, and asked what kind of legacy he wanted to leave behind. Conversely, it diverges about halfway through the story and, instead, starts to set the dominoes for ""bigger and better"" things, like S.H.I.E.L.D and the Avengers. In this third entry, we get the (final?) full-circle journey that, more or less, will come to establish Tony Stark/Iron Man as one or the other.Some time after the events of ""The Avengers"" we begin with a very restless Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who just can't seem to get a good night's sleep. As widely-known as he is for being Iron Man, and with all the major villains targeting his back, there exists a man by the name of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who is terrorizing the United States causing all kinds of chaos via public bombings and televised threats. After a dear friend of Stark's is severely injured, he takes the attack personally and issues a decree of vengeance. But in typical Tony Stark fashion, he not only paints himself another target, he even invites the trouble by publicly stating his home address. When his home is attacked, he barely escapes and must regroup in order to fight another day. In the meantime, secrets would be revealed and events would unfold as Stark discovers the truth, not only about his enemies, but also about himself.So how do you top ""The Avengers?"" After five excellent prequel films setting up a giant glorious spectacle of quasi-intergalactic proportions, there's nowhere left to go, but higher, right? Well, it depends. If you go by that logic, then you can only go further by making a direct sequel. But what would be the point of exceeding all that successful buildup by not trying to do it again? IM3 marks the beginning of Phase 2 by being less Avengers-centric (aside from a few event references) and by bringing things back down to earth. In doing so, we get to see Tony Stark for the genius, billionaire, playboy (well, not so much since he's with Pepper), philanthropist that he is. At a point in the film, and as obvious by the trailer, his house does, indeed, get blown to smithereens and buried in rubble. And being left with nothing but his ingenuity and resourcefulness, Stark must work his way back up from the ashes to stop a madman from manipulating the world with terror.And so far, based on the mixed reactions by divisive audiences, your expectations may or may not be met depending on what you're really watching the movie for (character development and storytelling or all-out action) and who you believe the true hero is, Tony Stark or Iron Man. I vehemently support the notion that Tony Stark is, without a doubt, the man that makes the suit. He didn't get however many umpteenth degrees in science and technology or create a mini Arc reactor from a box of scraps in a terrorist cave without showing some signs of intellectual capacity and a knack for building stuff. And for as little time as he spends inside of a suit, I think the film really cements him as a greater character than I would've ever expected. Tony Stark *is* Iron Man. He creates the suits, embraces his role, and finally comes to grips with his past.On a side note about the technical aspects, I saw this in 2D, as I'm not quite a believer in post-converted 3D films yet, so I can't tell you which version looks better. I will, however, give my compliments to the production crew on another excellent overall effort. The cinematography was pretty breathtaking on a few occasions (particularly when Stark is rescuing people from Air Force One) and and the final battle sequence with all the backup suits. Musically, Brian Tyler does an equally stupendous job driving the film with a mix between Ramin Djawadi's electronic style of the first film and John Debney's traditional orchestral sound of the second. And whether or not they make more IM films, which I think could be overkill at this point, remains to be seen. But I'm confident enough to say Tony Stark is ready for Phase 2 when it happens. Hopefully, the remaining MCU films will do just as great a job at expanding/establishing these characters and continuing to build up for an even more climactic meeting for when things fall into place for ""The Avengers 2.""Overall rating: 4.5/5.0",5,Iron Man 3 (Theatrical),1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,5114,"['Note', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'when', 'eventually', 'get', 'Blu-ray.Since',

And the villain in this film is the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and now Tony may need to come back and stop this guy to save the day again.

Third time is usually where the gasp of creativity that breathed life into the series to begin with finally starts to run out, leaving the filmmakers with one of two possible options: either keep repeating what has worked already on larger and larger scales ad nauseum, or break the series apart and come at it from a brand new angle.Fortunately, Black is not going to let anyone rest on their laurels. He&#8217;s given a real think at how to advance an Iron Man story beyond what has come before and the result is not only the cleverest action beats in the series to date, but the most work Downey has had to put into them. In fact, for all the many dozens of suits of armor flying around through the film and all the people wearing them (at one point it seems as if the entire cast is put into a suit at one point) Iron Man 3 actually boasts the least Iron Man of the series to date.On the downside, along with the armor, a lot of Tony&#8217;s supporting cast tends to come and go for long periods, particularly once he disappears into rural Tennessee to follow up a lead. Sure they get stuff to do &#8211; Happy follows some suspicious characters and sets the plot in motion, Rhodey once again backs Tony up during the action finish after doing little else the rest of the time, and Pepper actually gets into the action movie game for the first time, particularly during the middle segment when she briefly gets a suit of her own.But then they disappear so that Downey can go off and trade quips with a 10 year old for 30 minutes. Which is, it must be said, far better than it sounds due to Stark&#8217;s inability to actually be sappy but it&#8217;s still hard to feel like you&#8217;re being gipped somehow. After two films setting these characters up and making you care about them, they are shipped off because now no one knows what to do with them.Those are generally small quibbles, though, as &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; continues to set the bar for Marvel&#8217;s solo superhero films through a combination of wit, charm and out and out entertainment.

I did enjoy the movie more the second time I watched it, but it is my least favorite of the three.  I saw the first Ironman because I was a Robert Downey, Jr fan, not a fan of Ironman the superhero.

I didn't know a lot about the movie before watching it and so a couple of things took me buy surprise. First of all this is more of a Tony Stark Film than an Iron Man film. Sure, there are plenty of Iron Man suits in the move its just rare that Tony Stark is in them! However, I do like the anxiety and trauma issues that he is dealing with. That is good character development. I do like how Marvel has heroes that are not perfect and who have flaws. Makes them more human and I can relate to them better.I was not happy with how they turned the Mandarin into a front and a fake for Killian. Sir Ben Kingsley  is a great actor and he was doing a good job as the Mandarin and even though it was a good plot twist, and that scene where the truth is told is great, I would have liked to have seen Kingsley play out the bad guy role. The movie does have a ton of really good action scenes and I did enjoy the story itself. Guy Pierce does an excellent job as the villain, Killian.As usual Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Tony Stark. It is his movie and he provides great quips and attitude and also a real depth of humanity as he deals with his trauma along with the terrifying events that are unfolding.

1559926,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008JFUO72,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[7, 14]","I'm writing this more as a reaction than an actual review as I believe anyone who saw the first two movies - which was a whole lot of people - will want to see this one no matter what any reviews say. Nonetheless, I will try to avoid giving any plot spoilers.But as someone who was a fan of the Iron Man comics since the character first appeared back in the 60's, I absolutely have to say one thing right out of the gate. In the words of Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons:Worst... Mandarin... ever!Seriously, the best advice I can give anyone planning on seeing Iron Man 3 is that if you remember the arch-villain the Mandarin from the comic books, try to purge your mind of everything you ever knew about him. The character in the movie is _not_ the Mandarin from the comic books, not even remotely, though the film is clearly playing on the fact that unwary fans will think he is. I've heard a number of reasons for the changes to the character, the most believable being that the film's producers didn't want to offend the Chinese (i.e. China), who are a major film market these days and who also now own the largest theater chain in the US. It's essentially the same reason the producers of the remake of Red Dawn changed the villains from being Chinese to being North Korean. So this Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley (but not his fault) isn't remotely Chinese, doesn't have awesome power rings, isn't... Actually, his calling himself 'the Mandarin' just makes no sense whatsoever.  So for those of you who know the comic book character, brace yourselves for disappointment. For those of you who don't know the comic book character, you have no idea how fortunate you are.I have other problems with Iron Man 3. It's uneven, particularly in the first half, shifting back and forth between long tediously slow segments and then suddenly jarring action ones. It has plot holes big enough to shove an oil tanker through and at times requires suspension of disbelief that would take the cables from the Golden Gate Bridge to support. And the use of 3D in the film is distinctly unremarkable.  The characterizations resulting from the script are uneven as well. Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce manage to turn in good performances in spite of the script and the direction.  And Stephanie Szostak gives a stand-out performance as a bad-ass henchwoman.  But most of the other actors are largely wasted, most particularly Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle, but also William Sadler and Miguel Ferrer. To his credit, Ben Kingsley does carry off the Mandarin role that the script calls for. Unfortunately it's one that I want to completely purge from my memory.The blame for the film's shortcomings must be laid at the feet of Shane Black, who both directed and wrote most of the script (Drew Pearce co-wrote and evidently provided most of the humor that appears in the film). Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man films (and who plays Happy Hogan in all three) stepped aside for this one and it shows. It's something of a mystery why Black was picked for this film as his only directorial credit was 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. As a screenwriter he does have 1987's Lethal Weapon to his credit, but his record since then has been decidedly spotty with a string of big-budget films like The Last Boy Scout and The Last Action Hero that didn't catch fire with audiences.But all that said, the movie does pick up steam considerably in the last third and the final battle sequences are, to be honest, fairly awesome.A couple of side notes of things to watch for:  Stan Lee (as always) has a cameo in the film, this time as a beauty pageant judge.

Gwyneth Paltrow does the best ever as Pepper Potts. (Among other things, she gets some real action-hero moments.) The villains are truly villainous, and that kid had a great role. The action keeps going to the end, with enough surprises to keep it from being predictable.More than just an effect-fest, though, this has some complexity in at least some of the characters. Stark is forced to face his flaws, vanity in particular, and forced to deal with some very human weakness. In the end, it's not the super-suit that wins the day, it the man and the intelligence that wield the tool. And, if not the most subtle, it reminds everyone, not just scientists, that the best of intentions can be turned to dark purpose.
