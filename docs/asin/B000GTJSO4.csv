1006876,A330WR8UIBXYJ,B000GTJSO4,"D3Jr ""A reader and viewer.....""","[5, 6]","Where to start.  I'll start by saying I have rarely been more disappointed in a series as I am with the 3rd season of The L Word.  I really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd seasons, and how miserably off course this series has strayed is hard to fathom, because the first couple seasons do not remotely resemble the train wreck that is the 3rd season of this series.Was there a writers' strike during this season, because the writing, casting, and character development were absolutely horrid.  Amateurish, at best.  Why, oh why, the writers did what they did during this season is something for which I just don't think there is a logical answer.  For example, the Billie Blaikie character is beyond annoying.  Not only is this character totally irritating, but he's useless in terms of the story line.  A complete and utter bore, and why the writers would decide to infuse this Jar Jar Binks-like personality into The L Word world is beyond me.Moira/Max.  Need I say anything more?  Pairing this character with Jenny made no sense.  Absolutely no sense.  Jenny is devoloping her identity with her newly found orientation, and what do the writers decide to do? Pair Jenny with a woman who wants to become a man.  Can they butcher what could otherwise be a potentially great character (Jenny) any further?  Just how idiotically confusing do they want to make this character, anyway.  I'm sorry, Moira/Max didn't fit in this show and I found her/his character a needless distraction, particularly considering the obvious lack of chemistry with Jenny.Let's not forget about Angus.  Could the writers have found a more dull character this side of the Milky Way?  Ohhhhhh no, not just dull.  Goofy, too.  If they would have limited his role to babysitting Bette and Tina's baby, I would not be so upset.  But come on, having him romantically involved with Kit made me cringe and gave me the willies every time they were together.  Just another example of horrid writing and misplaced character dependencies.Spoiler ahead, folks.  The absolute strategic blunder of the entire series and evidence which is proof positive that the writers were out to lunch for this entire season--killing off Dana.  Why did they do this?  Dana was such a sweet, innocent character who many could empathize with, because her family was so conservative and she had struggled so much with coming out.  I'm really quite bitter with this writing decision, and the decision to take this valuable character off the series simply tells me the writing isn't what it should have been.  A mind numbing lack of vision was involved with this writing decision, because Dana, like all of the core characters, offers the series versatility and great character depth.  A huge and completely unnecessary loss for this series.I'm not happy with the direction of this series.  The writing stinks.  Too many characters make no sense.  Character development is the pits.  Strategic decisions to get rid of important characters is being carried out without much thought, it seems.  I'll see what they have to offer for the 4th season, and if the writers of this series want a legacy for this show, let's hope they apply more logic to subsequent seasons....",2,What happened?

1006878,AP3R7PFGRNBCS,B000GTJSO4,Iryshkidd,"[5, 10]","I have mixed reviews; 4 stars for attempts at change (would have been 3 if this had been the first season). I liked the ""list"" format for this...1. Dana.  Sad but what a story line.  As much as I hated to see that character go, it was a stroke of genious. The ending when they put her ashes into the waterfall pool, and the song ""..I will always be here"" played, PERFECT. The sweetness and beauty of Dana will really be a huge loss.  It will be hard to fill, but vital that the series pick up someone we can love without worrying that she'll turn out to be a creep.2. Alice's emotional level (great acting though) and change from carefee to sullen (and a stalker?) was a drag.  We needed her as she was; we miss her joy! Good bend with Lara - it makes sense and that happens a lot in reality.3. Bette and Tina - UGH!!!  Their story was totally tedious!  Tina has become a complete bore, Bette a miserable shadow of herself. And the ""going straight"" again for Tina?  It was so excruciating.  And hell, if you were ever going to let Bette have an affair, WHY oh WHY not with the fabulous Dana Delaney!?4. Shane. Can the woman get no redemption??  Leaving Carmen at the alter was such a thud - and YEAH, right - boinking that dork Cherrie with Carmen at home?  To take a character that far out into the light, then to have her fail in such a despicable way.  Shane's hard not to like, but, no way will she ever be anything but a ""ho"" - oh, sorry, ""what she is"" from now on, no matter HOW respectable of a woman they try to shove her toward - we'll never buy into any of it.5. Carmen. Too lovely not to keep around. Not a very good job of trying to draw in the Latino angle, but, a good try. Bring in an amazing older woman for her!6. Helena - what a switch from bad to a potentially good person; nice upswing with her, I liked her becoming a decent human being.  Appropriate that she got royally burned by Dylan! ...and the twist with her mother was WONDERFUL!7. Dylan - YES!  God, what a GREAT character and that twist was awesome!!  Loved the ""love scenes"" with her - HOT!!! (Ellen, you dope!)8. Kit and Angus...OK, not very believeable, but kinda sweet.9. Max. I'm sorry but, OMG WHAT?? As hard as it is to stretch our lesbian reality into a pack of all beautiful women, it was nearly impossible to imagine Max breaking into the bunch, she/he was just too ""out there"" - but, if anyone could, it's the ever weird Jenny..10. Jenny. She's just too weird.11. Billie - yeesh, creepy - and that sex scene with Max - did we REALLY need to experience that??12. Glad they're gone: IVAN, Candice, Gabby..13. I'd love to see Marina brought back into the series.14. And how about introducing some really classic actresses who have become legends (pay up, they're worth it to see them in lesbian rolls!)This season was not so much funny, it was more dramatic.  Some of it I loved with the plot surprises and new characters (NOT MAX), but the story with Bette and Tina - I fast forwaded through a lot of that.  I hope it lightens up next year, gets some humor, finds more realistic plots, and let's go of the tedious and far far left issues.",4,"Less humor, more drama.

It is an ""us against them""  mentality. With the exception of one seen with teenagers, this goesbeyond logic. Examples include :1. An employer who openly discriminates during an interview. Not afraid of lawsuits. A little unreal.2. An adoption agent who discriminates against orientation. She is very open and candid about not having a man as a parent.The writers need to do a much better job with logic and realism. The acting is superb, and Danielle deserves a lot of credit.

1006884,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000GTJSO4,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[16, 18]","The third season of the L Word picks right up with all the excitement, romance, and sexual tension of the previous seasons. Alice is struggling to get over the loss of her best friend and her lover while Dana moves on with Lara. One of the biggest turns of the season comes when Dana is diagnosed with breast cancer and the women struggle to help her cope and to deal with it themselves.  Tina and Bette's daughter, Angelica, is six months old and the two have done their best to reconcile and form a stable home for her. Bette is in the process of trying to adopt Angelica, so the couple has routine visits with a social worker. Shane and Carmen are in a committed relationship and living together in Jenny's house. Carmen's job as a dj is starting to pick up and she's even offered a position djing for Russell Simmons at some point. Shane opens a hair studio in the middle of a skateboard shop and, in typical Shane fashion, struggles to stay loyal to her (gorgeous) girlfriend. Jenny is off on a road trip somewhere with a girl named Moira who has a gender identity crisis. At some point during the season Moira becomes Max and decides to transition to a male. Meanwhile Jenny struggles to sell her book. Kit finally gets a storyline besides being the alcoholic has been sister and even finds a love interest. And finally, in one of the best additions, Helena Peabody is finally a full member of the cast and has her own story lines not involving Bette and Tina.This season of the L Word is emotionally charged and takes some chances that they haven't in previous years. With the addition of Moira, the show brings the first transgendered recurring role to network television. Though Jenny's story line typically bores me to tears and, I'll admit, I usually fast forward through a large portion of her scenes, this season actually made me interested to see what would go on. Jenny finally found someone who was her match. The heartbreak that exists with Alice when she sees Dana and Lara constantly is palpable, and completely relatable. I don't think anyone who has ever had their heart broken can look at what she went through without understanding how well done and realistic the emotion was. When we lose Dana later in the seaon, it only intensifies and finally gives Alice a chance to shine as someone besides the confused bisexual girl. On the same token, it's nice not to see Kit sitting around just being everyone else's go to girl and instead having her own story. The addition of Angus, Angelica's manny, as Kit's boyfriend finally brings a little meat to the Pam Grier character.The third season of the L Word is quite possibly the best one yet. A lot of the original characters have story lines that give them a chance to show their artistic range, and the new characters are welcome additions whose stories all add to the plot. I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the fourth season.",4,Quite possibly the best one yet,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2909,"['third', 'season', 'L', 'Word', 'right', 'up', 'excitement', 'romance', 'sexual', 'tension', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Alice', 'struggling', 'get', 'loss', 'best', 'friend', 'lover', 'Dana', 'Lara', 'One', 'biggest', 'turns', 'season', 'when', 'Dana', 'diagnosed', 'breast', 'cancer', 'women', 'struggle', 'help', 'cope', 'deal', 'Tina', 'Bette', 'daughter', 'Angelica', 'six', 'months', 'old', 'two', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'reconcile', 'form', 'stable', 'home', 'Bette', 'process', 'trying', 'adopt', 'Angelica', 'couple', 'routine', 'visits', 'social', 'worker', 'Shane', 'Carmen', 'are', 'committed', 'relationship', 'living', 'together', 'Jenny', 'house', 'Carmen', 'job', 'dj', 'starting', 'pick', 'up', 'even', 'offered', 'position', 'djing', 'Russell', 'Simmons', 'point', 'Shane', 'hair', 'studio', 'middle', 'skateboard', 'shop', 'typical', 'Shane', 'fashion', 'stay', 'loyal', 'gorgeous', 'girlfriend', 'Jenny', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'somewhere', 'girl', 'named', 'Moira', 'who', 'gender', 'identity', 'crisis', 'point', 'season', 'Moira', 'Max', 'transition', 'male', 'Meanwhile', 'Jenny', 'struggles', 'sell', 'book', 'Kit', 'finally', 'storyline', 'being', 'alcoholic', 'been', 'sister', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'finally', 'one', 'best', 'additions', 'Helena', 'Peabody', 'finally', 'full', 'member', 'cast', 'own', 'story', 'lines', 'not', 'involving', 'Bette', 'Tina.This', 'season', 'L', 'Word', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'chances', 'have', ""n't"", 'previous', 'years', 'addition', 'Moira', 'show', 'first', 'transgendered', 'recurring', 'role', 'network', 'television', 'Jenny', 'story', 'line', 'typically', 'tears', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'usually', 'fast', 'forward', 'large', 'portion', 'scenes', 'season', 'actually', 'made', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'go', 'Jenny', 'finally', 'found', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'match', 'heartbreak', 'Alice', 'when', 'Dana', 'Lara', 'constantly', 'palpable', 'completely', 'relatable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'heart', 'broken', 'can', 'look', 'what', 'went', 'understanding', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'emotion', 'was', 'When', 'lose', 'Dana', 'later', 'seaon', 'only', 'finally', 'Alice', 'chance', 'shine', 'someone', 'confused', 'bisexual', 'girl', 'same', 'token', 'nice', 'not', 'see', 'Kit', 'sitting', 'around', 'just', 'being', 'everyone', 'else', 'go', 'girl', 'instead', 'having', 'own', 'story', 'addition', 'Angus', 'Angelica', 'manny', 'Kit', 'boyfriend', 'finally', 'little', 'meat', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'character.The', 'third', 'season', 'L', 'Word', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'lot', 'original', 'characters', 'have', 'story', 'lines', 'give', 'chance', 'show', 'artistic', 'range', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'welcome', 'additions', 'stories', 'add', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'fourth', 'season']",The L Word - The Complete Third Season

I agree with several other posters who  say that key characters' personalities seem to have done 180's.  Bette turns into a marshmallow; Tina suddenly ""needs a man;"" level-headed Alice becomes a pill-popping stalker; and Helena the conniver becomes Helena the connived.Unlike some others, though, I find the Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) storyline interesting and thought-provoking.  The scenes in which Dylan falls for Helena were oh-so-sexy (and I'm straight!); but the video set-up for the sexual harrassment suit was stupid and it was clear to the viewer what would happen next.  I could have done without the Billie character.  Angus and Kit had some cute moments, but the whole menopause storyline could have been far more interesting and real without Angus.And why kill off Dana?  She was, by far, the most entertaining character on the show--coordinated but goofy, smart but out of it.  I can only assume that Erin wanted out of the show for some reason.Now for the DVD's themselves:  what's up with the sad extras?  One of my favorite things about the season 2 DVD's was the commentary by Leisha, Kate, and Erin for the ""Land Ahoy"" episode.  It was hysterical.  When I opened up season 3 and realized there was no commentary on any of the episodes by anyone, I felt really cheated.

Season 3 gives us the death of the one character that has truly developed and grown since the series inception (Dana). Also we have Kit, the character who in my opinion has been a pointless character from day one, getting pregnant as soon as she hits menopause. The fact that Pam Grier (Kit) is old enough to be the grandmother of most of the cast seems to have been overlooked in this particular piece of the storyline. Kit dying of breast cancer would have made for a far more believable plot, even the folks putting the series together admit in an interview on the DVD that it would be unusual for somebody the age of the character Dana dying from breast cancer is unlikely. I appreciate the fact that cancer doesnt discriminate and kills anyone, the way those responsible for the series chose to highlight such an important subject, has for me detracted from the quality of the show.Season 1 was great, season 2 was not quite up to the same standard but the way season 3 developed has taken the show down to the level of an evening version of a day-time soap.

The writing in this season is the best so far.The storyline keeps moving and changing in a way that creates a very unique journey among this group of friends. Once again, commendations for taking on very real topics, including trans identity, menopause, joint parenting, and cancer.The acting shines on almost everyones part. My new favorite character, ""Angus the Manny"" is probably the worst actor, but he's so likeable, it's okay.As others have said, unfortuately the Betty music is still around, but it is _much_ less prevalent and distracting. The rest of the music is actually pretty decent.Another negative point is that not only are old dropped story lines not picked up, but the habit of dropping stories w/o explaination continues. Also, no amazing guest stars ala Cameron Manhiem or Sandra Bernhardt from Season 2.Packaging: They finally got wise and used slim-case design, which is great b/c it doesn't waste space, but now it doesn't match the other 2 seasons. There are some great special features, but there are at least two major spoilers right on the package, so don't look at it too closely as you're putting the discs in.Still a solid 4-star show - can't wait for season 4. Maybe I can finally give it 5 stars...",4,Best Season Yet,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1318,"['breathe', 'huge', 'sigh', 'relief', 'writers', 'have', 'finally', 'seemed', 'hit', 'stride', 'writing', 'season', 'best', 'so', 'far.The', 'storyline', 'keeps', 'moving', 'changing', 'way', 'very', 'unique', 'journey', 'group', 'friends', 'Once', 'again', 'commendations', 'taking', 'very', 'real', 'topics', 'including', 'trans', 'identity', 'menopause', 'joint', 'parenting', 'cancer.The', 'acting', 'shines', 'almost', 'everyones', 'part', 'new', 'favorite', 'character', 'Angus', 'Manny', 'probably', 'worst', 'actor', 'so', 'likeable', 'okay.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'unfortuately', 'Betty', 'music', 'still', 'around', '_much_', 'less', 'prevalent', 'distracting', 'rest', 'music', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent.Another', 'negative', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'old', 'dropped', 'story', 'lines', 'not', 'picked', 'up', 'habit', 'dropping', 'stories', 'w/o', 'explaination', 'Also', 'amazing', 'guest', 'stars', 'ala', 'Cameron', 'Manhiem', 'Sandra', 'Bernhardt', 'Season', '2.Packaging', 'finally', 'got', 'wise', 'used', 'slim-case', 'design', 'great', ""n't"", 'waste', 'space', 'now', ""n't"", 'match', 'other', '2', 'seasons', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'major', 'spoilers', 'right', 'package', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'closely', ""'re"", 'putting', 'discs', 'in.Still', 'solid', '4-star', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '4', 'Maybe', 'can', 'finally', 'give', '5', 'stars']",The L Word - The Complete Third Season
