I came here intending to say something similar: that 'Salmon Fishing' is a sweet, nice little movie...just don't try to over-analyze it.  Many aspects of the film won't withstand a fair level of scrutiny.  But if you called talented screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to task on any incongruities, his reaction would surely be: ""What's your point?"" Mr. Beaufoy is a spinner of screenplay gold - turning the dark novelQ & A: A Novelinto the upliftingSlumdog Millionairewas a work of alchemy.  He works his magic here again.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have two winning, magnetic stars.  I like Ewan McGregor in pretty much everything (he, too, like Christopher Plummer, should have been nominated for his work in last year'sBeginners).  And, if you don't like Emily Blunt, you have no pulse.  Kristin Scott Thomas shows off her comedic chops here as the British PM's publicity flack.  It's an inch-deep role that she tackles with relish.  It's interesting that her roles in French seem so much more serious.  She's almost an entirely different actress in her second language.

In MOULIN ROUGE we discovered he was an astonishingly good singer who had turned down a rock and roll career in favor of an acting career. In the STAR WARS franchise we saw him as an action hero.  In this film he plays an utterly endearing scientist with Asperger's Syndrome.  He is a civil servant in the UK working with fish who suddenly finds himself caught up in a madcap scheme to bring flycasting trout fishing to the country of Yemen at the behest of an incredibly wealthy shiek. Initially it is the UK government which forces him into this but the charismatic shiek himself and a female colleague in distress over her MIA soldier boyfriend totally enmesh him in the scheme. If you are looking for a feel good film after a stressful day, this is it.  It is utterly charming.

1511147,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0067EKY7M,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a scientist who specializes in fish. When he's contacted by Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) about her boss Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) wanting to bring salmon to the Yemen, Fred scoffs at the project and flat out turns them down. Through some convincing and with his job on the line, Fred eventually agrees to try to bring salmon to the Yemen. Despite the uphill battle, Fred discovers that Sheikh isn't quite as crazy as he imagined and Fred begins to look at Harriet as more than just a fellow colleague.Many may view Salmon Fishing in the Yemen as a witty comedy; at least as far as the first half is concerned. To be honest though, it generally irritated me for a good forty five minutes or so. Nearly everyone on-screen came off as a bunch of annoying twits, especially Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas. The comedy wasn't funny either. It was like a string of snarky remarks that were nothing more than obnoxious. Emily Blunt is the only character who really had charm and likeability. Blunt is basically the only person that feels human. Being forced to listen to stuffy and uptight people drone on and on isn't my idea of entertainment or comedy. Did anyone reading this watch ""Scrubs""? You know how Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) rants were funny in small doses, but got on your last nerve if there were too many of them in one episode or if they went on for too long? The feeling is similar to how Salmon Fishing in the Yemen will affect you.Once the Sheik is introduced though, it's as if that unlikeable layer is washed away. All of the snooty characters loosen up a bit and pull the stick out of their rear end. Suddenly a man who was looked at as being out of his mind is the only one speaking logically. Fred begins to warm up to the idea of bringing salmon fishing to an area that seems unlikely. The flaws he makes and the triangle that develops between him, Harriet, and her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) are essentially the heart of the film. The salmon fishing becomes secondary.What's interesting is the first half of the film can be looked at as a straight comedy (this can be debated for some) and the second half is more of this dramatic romantic comedy. Some of the best dialogue of the film happens when Fred and Harriet show up in the Yemen after Sheik has started bringing water to the middle of the desert. They pass a group of people praying and Fred says, ""I don't think I know anyone who goes to church."" Harriet replies, ""Me neither."" Fred pauses before saying, ""On Sunday, we go to Target."" The humor is pretty dry throughout the film, but feels like it doesn't really hit its mark until the second half.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen wasn't the best movie to sit through. A good portion of the film got under my skin, but then it got a bit easier to tolerate before actually becoming halfway decent. The film features some beautiful cinematography with incredibly green scenery and this amazing perspective in the water almost as if you're seeing through the eyes of a fish. Once the majority of the characters stop being such uptight douchebags, they're actually very warm in an almost enchanting sense. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen actually has a pretty powerful message at its core and a philosophy that just about everyone could learn from.",3,First it's sour.

1511153,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B0067EKY7M,Dean A. Anderson,"[4, 7]","The best thing about the film, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"", is the imagery found in the title. The audacious idea of bringing a fishing industry to the desert evokes glorious ideas of rebirth and resurrection. But unfortunately, the soaring nature of this central theme is dragged down by dull, loathsome Hollywood clich&eacute;s.Certainly, the film has an interesting pedigree. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (who made one of the greatest of all coming of age films, ""My Life as a Dog"") and screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (who brings the work of a novelist to the screen as he did with ""Slumdog Millionaire"") gave reason for hope.Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones. (Sidenote - I kept being distracted when people called him Dr. Jones which made me think of another famous movie scientist. Between this and playing Obi-Wan in the prequels, is he trying to redo all of George Lucas' classic characters? Howard the Duck can't be far behind. End sidenote.) Dr. Jones is an ichthyologist / British government drone challenged to help a sheik bring salmon to Yemen.Emily Blunt plays Harriet, a western representative for the sheik who must persuade Jones that the project is not a boondoggle or a joke but a viable possibility. Pressure is also supplied by Kristen Scott Thomas who plays the Prime Minister's Press Secretary desperately seeking a positive story from the Middle East.Thomas as the foul mouthed, devious political schemer provides some of the film's funniest moments, especially in her texting conversations with the Prime Minister, but at times her moments come across as ""In the Loop"" lite.Another fine moment in the film comes when Jones meets with the sheik who ask if Jones is religious. Jones insists he just believes in facts and figures...He's a scientist! But the sheik counters that Jones is a fisherman and by definition that means he is a man of faith. Why else would he spend hundreds of hours waist deep in water with no assured outcome.There are several interesting conversations about religion. Alfred and Harriet both admit they don't know anyone who goes to church, Alfred saying he uses Sundays to go to Target. (This is a little puzzling as before we saw Alfred with his wife practicing in a musical quartet in a church. Whatever.)But as I mentioned before, tiresome clich&eacute;s emerge and to discuss them I must stoop to spoilers.Though is it a spoiler to say that even though Jones is a married man and Harriet is in an affair with a soldier in Afghanistan, that the two will fall and love? For a while I thought that the message of the importance of patience and faith and fishing would be applied to the marriage of Dr. Jones. But no, because I more important rule is that in a Hollywood film the two names at the top of the bill, the pretty people, must come together. ""Casablanca"" is still fresh because lead characters doing what is right rather than what feels good is a rarity in films.There also is lazy characterization in the film. When Blunt's boyfriend becomes inconvenient to the plot, he is shown to be a raciest, as all soldiers seem to be in Hollywood. And the sheik, we are assured, is different, a visionary who believes in peace, romance and fishing. There is talk of the clich&eacute; of ""the magic negro"", an African American figure whose sole purpose is to supply wisdom to the white hero. Amr Waked seems to be playing the Arab version of this role (as he did in ""Syriana""). All the other Arabs seem shady and are probably all terrorists.And the final annoying clich&eacute;, was the talk of ""faith"". In films, it is important to have faith, it doesn't matter what you put your faith in. So it's good for Alfred to put faith in something new and different like a fish hatchery in the desert and a romantic fling, but nothing so drab as an established marriage.But it does, of course, matter what you put your faith in. The film has people who engage in terrorism and they certainly have faith, placed in a wrong and evil place.Paul in I Corinthians 15 argues that if Christians put their faith in the resurrection and it proves untrue, then Christians are fools.So faith in fishing in the Yemen, in peace and prosperity in the Middle East needs to be more than just a pretty thought one believes in, it must be possible. I wish those ideas would have been even more central in the film than another tired boy meets girl story.(The film is rated PG-13 for brief violence and strong language.)",3,Fishing....Faith....Same Thing,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,4448,"['best', 'thing', 'film', 'Salmon', 'Fishing', 'Yemen', 'imagery', 'found', 'title', 'audacious', 'idea', 'bringing', 'fishing', 'industry', 'desert', 'glorious', 'ideas', 'rebirth', 'resurrection', 'unfortunately', 'soaring', 'nature', 'central', 'theme', 'dragged', 'down', 'dull', 'loathsome', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.Certainly', 'film', 'interesting', 'pedigree', 'Directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'who', 'made', 'one', 'greatest', 'coming', 'age', 'films', 'Life', 'Dog', 'screenplay', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'who', 'work', 'novelist', 'screen', 'did', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'gave', 'reason', 'hope.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Jones', 'Sidenote', 'kept', 'being', 'distracted', 'when', 'people', 'called', 'Dr.', 'Jones', 'made', 'think', 'famous', 'movie', 'scientist', 'playing', 'Obi-Wan', 'prequels', 'trying', 'redo', 'George', 'Lucas', 'classic', 'characters', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'far', 'End', 'sidenote', 'Dr.', 'Jones', 'ichthyologist', '/', 'British', 'government', 'drone', 'challenged', 'help', 'sheik', 'bring', 'salmon', 'Yemen.Emily', 'Blunt', 'Harriet', 'western', 'representative', 'sheik', 'who', 'must', 'persuade', 'Jones', 'project', 'not', 'boondoggle', 'joke', 'viable', 'possibility', 'Pressure', 'also', 'supplied', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Press', 'Secretary', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'positive', 'story', 'Middle', 'East.Thomas', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'devious', 'political', 'schemer', 'film', 'funniest', 'moments', 'especially', 'texting', 'conversations', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'times', 'moments', 'come', 'Loop', 'lite.Another', 'fine', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Jones', 'meets', 'sheik', 'who', 'ask', 'Jones', 'religious', 'Jones', 'just', 'facts', 'figures', 'scientist', 'sheik', 'counters', 'Jones', 'fisherman', 'definition', 'man', 'faith', 'Why', 'else', 'would', 'spend', 'hundreds', 'hours', 'waist', 'deep', 'water', 'assured', 'outcome.There', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'religion', 'Alfred', 'Harriet', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'church', 'Alfred', 'saying', 'Sundays', 'go', 'Target', 'little', 'puzzling', 'saw', 'Alfred', 'wife', 'practicing', 'musical', 'quartet', 'church', 'mentioned', 'clich', 'eacute', 'emerge', 'discuss', 'must', 'stoop', 'spoilers.Though', 'spoiler', 'say', 'even', 'Jones', 'married', 'man', 'Harriet', 'affair', 'soldier', 'Afghanistan', 'two', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'while', 'thought', 'message', 'importance', 'patience', 'faith', 'fishing', 'would', 'be', 'applied', 'marriage', 'Dr.', 'Jones', 'more', 'important', 'rule', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'two', 'names', 'top', 'bill', 'pretty', 'people', 'must', 'come', 'together', 'Casablanca', 'still', 'fresh', 'lead', 'characters', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'rather', 'what', 'feels', 'good', 'rarity', 'films.There', 'also', 'lazy', 'characterization', 'film', 'When', 'Blunt', 'boyfriend', 'inconvenient', 'plot', 'shown', 'be', 'raciest', 'soldiers', 'seem', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'sheik', 'are', 'assured', 'different', 'visionary', 'who', 'peace', 'romance', 'fishing', 'talk', 'clich', 'eacute', 'magic', 'negro', 'African', 'American', 'figure', 'sole', 'purpose', 'supply', 'wisdom', 'white', 'hero', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'be', 'playing', 'Arab', 'version', 'role', 'did', 'Syriana', 'other', 'Arabs', 'seem', 'shady', 'are', 'probably', 'final', 'annoying', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'talk', 'faith', 'films', 'important', 'have', 'faith', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'put', 'faith', 'good', 'Alfred', 'put', 'faith', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'fish', 'hatchery', 'desert', 'romantic', 'fling', 'nothing', 'so', 'drab', 'established', 'marriage.But', 'course', 'matter', 'what', 'put', 'faith', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'engage', 'terrorism', 'certainly', 'have', 'faith', 'placed', 'wrong', 'evil', 'place.Paul', 'Corinthians', '15', 'argues', 'Christians', 'put', 'faith', 'resurrection', 'untrue', 'then', 'Christians', 'are', 'fools.So', 'faith', 'fishing', 'Yemen', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'Middle', 'East', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'thought', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'possible', 'wish', 'ideas', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'central', 'film', 'tired', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'story', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'brief', 'violence', 'strong', 'language']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

1511155,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0067EKY7M,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","British writer Paul Torday has written a few best-selling and award winning novels.  His 2006 novel ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was a winner of the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Price for Comic Writing and a Waverton Good Read Award in 2008.The story was so well loved in the UK that it would receive serialization on BBC Radio 4 and eventually receive a film adaptation in 2010 directed by Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolate"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""The Cider House Rules"", ""Dear John"") and written by Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""The Full Monty"", ""127 Hours"").VIDEO:""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The overall picture quality for this film is quite amazing.  Shot in London, Scottland and Morcco, Terry Stacey (""Adventureland"", ""50/50&#8243;, ""P.S. I Love You"") manages to capture the lush greens and the barren desert with efficacy.  Colors are natural, vibrant when they need to be and black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't see any banding issues, nor did I see any artifacts and the detail, may it be during closeups or the clothing of an individual can be seen.  If anything, the film looks great on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  As one can expect from a romantic comedy, the film is dialogue driven and is crystal clear, along with Dario Marianelli's (""Atonement"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Pride & Prejudice"") musical score.  But there is also good use of surround and LFE, primarily during the fishing scenes and you hear the fish jumping in the water to sounds of splashing.  These really come through the surround channels and just the boom from those scenes, it was a nice touch.There area few scenes with crowds and you do get ambiance but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack for ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was quite appropriate and the added touch of the surround channel and LFE sequences were pretty cool to hear!Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" comes with the following special features:Miracles Happen: Making Salmon Fishing in the Yemen - (13:07) The director and cast talk about the making of the film.  From interviews with the fly fishing adviser, shooting in Scotland and what happened when a flood devastated the set and more.The Fisherman in the Middle East: Novelist Paul Torday - (3:14) Novelist Paul Torday talks about how his novel became a film.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that before I review a fishing-related film, I always wonder if it will be about another banal storyline of one trying to find their life through fishing.  Fortunately, this is not the case with ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"".In fact, I found this film to be smart, delightful and quite moving!  While fishing is an important part of the film, what makes ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" so original is that it deals with political spin, as viewers get to see how politicians try to deflect a crisis by trying to find another story that people will follow.In the case of this film, the Prime Minister's press secretary trying to deflect the crisis in Afghanistan and the death of soldiers by trying to build up British and Arab relations by a storyline of two sides working together to bring salmon fishing to the Yemen.  And the concept may seem like a bore when reading it, this film is definitely not boring, thanks to its characters and a wonderful performance by Emily Blunt, Ewan McGregor, Amr Waked and Kristin Scott Thomas.You have one storyline revolving around Harriet (Blunt), who not only has to emotionally deal with her boyfriend having to go to Afghanistan on a mission and not long after, having to deal with the prikish Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor).  But the delightful thing about Harriet is that she embraces her job and Dr. Alfred Jones with humor and just wanting to make sure that she comes through for her client, the Sheikh Muhammed (Waked).And as for Dr. Alfred Jones, a man with Asperger's Syndrome but so qualified and knowledgeable when it comes to fish, talking with others who are not so familiar with fish and streams, he can be rather cold.  But what is interesting about Jones is that under that cold demeanor, he's actually a good guy.  He's just not good with his emotions but yet, Harriet manages to bring the best out of him.And this is where the conundrum begins because Harriet hears of her boyfriend's possible demise (news reports of no survivors involving British soldiers in Afghanistan).  Emotionally withdrawn, Dr. Jones knows that he needs her to complete this Yemen project, so he gradually warms up by being there for her, helping her through this tough time.  And through that tough time of adjusting, not only does he enjoy her as as a colleague, he begins to feel attracted to her.  As she does with him.And to add to the relationship between the two, you add the Sheikh Muhammed.  The Sheikh knows that there are people who will try to derail his plan to bring salmon fishing to Yemen (especially as there are groups who don't like the interaction with the British on working on a  project together).  But the Sheikh has a lot of faith, always positive and for Dr. Jones, he is unable to understand what faith is, but through being with the Sheikh throughout the project, he begins to change and possibly see where his life can be better used to help people.And then you have Kristin Scott Thomas as the press secretary Patricia Maxwell.  A woman who is seen primarily talking on her phone or on chat with the Prime Minister, and she provides a comical look at how the politicians work.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and the lossless soundtrack sounds great, especially for the salmon fishin scenes that tend to use the surround channels and LFE quite effectively.  While not special features heavy, you do get two of them.Overall, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was indeed a treat.  Aside from the wonderful performances, the direction by Lasse Hallstrom is well-done, the cinematography of Terry Stacey is also fantastic and for the most part, Simon Beaufoy's screenplay of Paul Torday's novel manages to be delightful and makes the film quite enjoyable.  It's an original storyline which I don't think will ever be duplicated.If you are looking for a different kind of romantic comedy that is fun and very entertaining, ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is definitely recommended!",4,"(Blu-ray) ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" was indeed a treat!",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,6452,"['British', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Torday', 'written', 'few', 'best-selling',

1511167,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0067EKY7M,D. S. Thurlow,"[4, 5]","""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a nicely-done British romantic comedy, built around a preposterous premise and the charm of two unlikely people falling in love.  Its very British humor won't appeal to everyone, but a strong cast sells the movie.When a wealthy Yemeni Sheik (an excellent Amr Waked) decides to build his own salmon fly-fishing stream in his desert homeland, government media expert Paula Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas) sees an opportunity for favorable publicity and pushes the project on skeptical Fisheries scientist Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor).  The reluctant Jones and hyper-efficient business consultant Harriet Chetwode-Tobin (Emily Blunt)begin to put flesh on the whimsical project, which takes on a life of its own, far up a narrow wadi in the Yemeni mountains.This is a fun movie with several narrative threads.  Maxwell's ruthless and hilarious quest for favorable publicity is one.  A second involves the troubled marriage of Dr. Jones and his careerist wife, and Harriet's stressful quickie wartime romance with a deployed British Army officer.  The main thread is the slow, uneven blossoming of a relationship between Fred and Harriet, as verbal sparring over a seemingly impossible project turns into a shared committment to something that might just work out.  A key scene comes early in the movie, over dinner in a Scottish castle, when the Sheik challenges the scientist's claimed lack of faith, using fishing as a telling metaphor.The movie has some jarring moments of excitement (the sheik has enemies) and some beautiful location shooting, including London, Scotland and Morocco (a stand-in for war-torn Yemen).  Best of all is the superb acting of McGregor and Blunt, putting their understated best into a touching romance.

1511170,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0067EKY7M,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 5]","This one did snag me with a lure most appealing. Be forewarned that this 2012 romantic dramedy is idiosyncratic and full of whimsy, which should come as no surprise as the director is Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m whose most successful films (Chocolat,The Cider House Rules,My Life as a Dog) turn on flights of fancy. Besides, it's certainly not every romantic comedy that encompasses hydro-engineering, environmentalism, Middle East tensions, and British populism. What holds these disparate subjects together is the pipe dream one Yemeni sheikh has to bring salmon fishing to the wadis of his homeland. Adapted by Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) from a popular2006 Brit-lit bookby Paul Torday, the story primarily concerns the two people who get caught up in Sheikh Muhammad's dream - tweedy fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones, Fred to everyone who knows him, and super-efficient public relations consultant Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.They are enlisted by Patricia Maxwell, the hell-on-heels press officer for the British prime minister who is desperate for a feel-good distraction from the bloodshed occurring in Afghanistan. She is immediately drawn to the human interest angle of the salmon fishing story as well as the revelation that there are at least two million anglers in the U.K. Fred thinks the idea is ridiculous and for good reason - the plan is to build a dam (which looks as big as Hoover Dam), construct an elaborate irrigation system, and stock the waters with 10,000 North Atlantic salmon, all for the hefty price tag of fifty million pounds. Alas, Fred gradually succumbs to the deeply spiritual nature and ecological sensibilities of the sheikh's quest as well as Harriet's quiet persistence and demure charms. Complicating matters is the fact that Fred is unhappily married, while Harriet is getting serious with a handsome soldier who gets shipped to Afghanistan.Given the attractive leads, the romantic sparks are not surprising, but their cautious relationship and soulful connection provide much of the movie's unforced charm. The more fanciful events in the last half-hour do bring a level of incredulity for which Hallstr&ouml;m has become renowned, and the terrorist subplot is woefully underdeveloped relative to the love story. However, the actors in exchange deliver nicely turned performances with Ewan McGregor (Beginners) at his most modestly suppressed as Fred. Usually cast in brittle or saucy roles, Emily Blunt (The Young Victoria) brings unfettered charm to Harriet without sacrificing her steely intelligence. Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient) easily steals all her scenes as Maxwell with acidic panache, while Amr Waked (Syriana) brings a charismatic calm to the sheikh. Kudos should go to Terry Stacey (50/50) for his handsome cinematography which captures London, Morocco (subbing for Yemen), and especially Scotland in postcard-worthy tableaux.",4,Fly-Fishing and Romance Mix in a Charming Tale of Fulfilling Dreams Against the Odds,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2890,"['one', 'did', 'snag', 'lure', 'most', 'appealing', 'Be', 'forewarned', '2012', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'idiosyncratic', 'full', 'whimsy', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'Chocolat', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'turn', 'flights', 'fancy', 'certainly', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hydro-engineering', 'environmentalism', 'Middle', 'East', 'tensions', 'British', 'populism', 'What', 'disparate', 'subjects', 'together', 'pipe', 'dream', 'one', 'Yemeni', 'sheikh', 'bring', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'wadis', 'homeland', 'Adapted', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'popular2006', 'Brit-lit', 'bookby', 'Paul', 'Torday', 'story', 'primarily', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'Sheikh', 'Muhammad', 'dream', 'tweedy', 'fisheries', 'expert', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Jones', 'Fred', 'everyone', 'who', 'super-efficient', 'public', 'relations', 'consultant', 'Harriet', 'Chetwode-Talbot.They', 'are', 'enlisted', 'Patricia', 'Maxwell', 'hell-on-heels', 'press', 'officer', 'British', 'prime', 'minister', 'who', 'desperate', 'feel-good', 'distraction', 'bloodshed', 'occurring', 'Afghanistan', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'human', 'interest', 'angle', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'revelation', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'million', 'anglers', 'U.K.', 'Fred', 'idea', 'ridiculous', 'good', 'reason', 'plan', 'build', 'dam', 'as', 'big', 'Hoover', 'Dam', 'construct', 'elaborate', 'irrigation', 'system', 'stock', 'waters', '10,000', 'North', 'Atlantic', 'salmon', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'fifty', 'million', 'pounds', 'Alas', 'Fred', 'gradually', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'nature', 'ecological', 'sensibilities', 'sheikh', 'quest', 'as', 'well', 'Harriet', 'quiet', 'persistence', 'demure', 'charms', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'fact', 'Fred', 'unhappily', 'married', 'Harriet', 'getting', 'serious', 'handsome', 'soldier', 'who', 'shipped', 'Afghanistan.Given', 'attractive', 'leads', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'are', 'not', 'surprising', 'cautious', 'relationship', 'soulful', 'connection', 'provide', 'much', 'movie', 'unforced', 'charm', 'more', 'fanciful', 'events', 'last', 'half-hour', 'do', 'bring', 'level', 'incredulity', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'become', 'renowned', 'terrorist', 'subplot', 'woefully', 'underdeveloped', 'relative', 'love', 'story', 'However', 'actors', 'exchange', 'deliver', 'nicely', 'turned', 'performances', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Beginners', 'most', 'modestly', 'suppressed', 'Fred', 'Usually', 'cast', 'brittle', 'saucy', 'roles', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'unfettered', 'charm', 'Harriet', 'sacrificing', 'steely', 'intelligence', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'English', 'Patient', 'easily', 'scenes', 'Maxwell', 'acidic', 'panache', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'Syriana', 'charismatic', 'calm', 'sheikh', 'Kudos', 'should', 'go', 'Terry', 'Stacey', '50/50', 'handsome', 'cinematography', 'London', 'Morocco', 'subbing', 'Yemen', 'especially', 'Scotland', 'postcard-worthy', 'tableaux']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen
1511171,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0067EKY7M,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Now and then a film comes along with such an 'out of left field' premise, and the producers/director get what it's all about, that it just turns out as the most peasant surprise ever. This is one of those films.Here's the scoop. Ewan McGregor gets an e-mail from Emily Blunt. She has an Arab client with more money than sense who is in love with salmon fishing. He wants McGregor to engineer a system whereby he can introduce salmon into the Yemen ecology. McGregor thinks it's undoable but, since his wife is headed to Geneva on business and Britain needs a public relations coup, (they force the project on him) he might as well see how far he can take it. The results are surprising. There are a couple of sub plots that add to the overall but why spoil?This is a charming film. One of the reasons my wife liked it is because the strongest individuals here are all women. McGregor is very accomplished in his discipline but he's a bit of a milquetoast with little sense of humor. The guy in charge of securing the salmon, and pretty much every male above him in the government, are portrayed as wankers. Emily Blunt is a doll and seeing her and McGregor slowly and quietly grow closer is very satisfying. Something else I liked a lot was that, for the most part, the people here are good-hearted. Even Kristin Scott Thomas, though a bit tough and rough-edged, is not an evil queen. In one scene she's shown playing video games with her son. This is such a jolt, and so quick, it really underlined the type of person she is. There are a lot of nifty touches like that.This is a good looking movie. Even the desert is lovingly photographed. Lasse Hallstrom is a seasoned director and very adept at taking smaller stories and giving them their own gravity. He doesn't disappoint here. You just fall in love with these people and root for them and their cause. The music is good and all the other production values are as good as they need to be to bring this one of a kind film to fruition.

Working with a script by Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Yasmin, etc) adapted from Paul Torday's popular novel by the same name, and selecting a cast of some of our brightest and worthy character actors in the business, he has created a strange story that is at once full of political satire, relationship studies, fragile human frailties and hope, and in doing so has given us one of the surprise best films of the year.Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked, a mesmerizingly fine actor) is a visionary sheik who believes that his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert with the hope that he can make the desert green and a happy home for his people. He has an endless supply of money and instructs his representative Harriet (Emily Blunt) - a bright but relationship-anxious girl who has just started an affair with a soldier, Capt. Robert Mayers (Tom Mison, a dashingly handsome new face on the screen!) - to turn the dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable: the naive Alfred is an idealist whose marriage to his sold wife Mary (Rachael Stirling) is one rocky ground. That is, until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary Bridget (Kristin Scott Thomas in a brilliant character role) latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Now, this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible.In addition to this extraordinary cast there are tasty cameo roles for Conleth Hill as Alfred's blustering Dickensonian boss Bernard Sugden among others.  The concept of taking unlikely colleagues into a life changing relationship on this adventure dreamed by Sheikh Muhammed is more than tender; it is also very intelligently written romance.

To spice it up, the story is set partly in Yemen, where a very wealthy Yemeni sheik wants to build a water project to create an agricultural base for his people, with a side benefit of salmon fishing for him.  The British government is at first an enthusiastic backer, what with 2,000,000 British anglers who vote and who are presumed to also like the idea; and for it's Middle Eastern theme with no explosions or death.  Unfortunately, it's going to take 10,000 salmon hatchlings and the fishermen go up in arms, so the only alternative is farmed salmon.  But will they run?  Will they migrate and establish a fishery?It turns out that, in the real world, farmed salmon do run.  A bit later as they first return to where they escaped or were released, then they miss the anglers who show up earlier to get the native fish, and then they screw up the spawning grounds by trying to lay their own eggs, so there's lots of emerging reasons not to farm salmon as we currently do, but that's not this film.  The point is, the fish DO run, they swim upstream and over the damn (and they swam and they swam right over the dam!).But this is a Western film, with Brits abroad, and it's set in Yemen and all we know about the Middle East is that there's a whole lot of terrorists over there, so that's the way the movie presents the Yemenis.  If they're not just standing around providing local color with their antiquated dress and weather sculpted faces, they're ordering assassinations, and trying to destroy things.  Don't ask why.  Don't consider whether it's our policies that might be causing this animosity, our treatment of the Arab on the street.  That isn't this movie, either.  Worse, the two British characters wander around in casual western wear, no more than one layer, nothing covering their arms or her head, just as if Yemen is a branch of Hyde park.  When she can't sleep, she comes out of  her tent in her pjs, then he comes out in his, and they sit next to each other.  No matter how this might outrage the locals in the real world, or get the Brits killed (it doesn't, the plot won't allow it).The movie is a rather simple romantic adventure, a boy and a girl join a rich sheik in his dream to bring salmon fishing to Yemen.  A few cranky old Arab terrorists and some cynical British politicians get in the way, but in the end &#34;Faith&#34; and Love triumph, and the salmon run.A lot of people thought this was an incredible film.",3,Romantic Adventure With A Cultural Tin Ear Set In An Exotic Setting,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2881,"['Amazon', 'changed', 'stars', 'so', '3', 'means', '34', 'okay', '34', 'film', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'stars', 'old', 'wordless', 'system.This', 'fairly', 'run', 'mill', 'bait-and-switch', 'romance', 'formula', 'popular', 'when', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'were', 'dancing', 'black', 'white', 'Married', 'man', 'woman', 'love', 'interest', 'love', 'previous', 'commitments', 'conveniently', 'fall', 'away', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'then', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'spice', 'up', 'story', 'set', 'partly', 'Yemen', 'where', 'very', 'wealthy', 'Yemeni', 'sheik', 'build', 'water', 'project', 'create', 'agricultural', 'base', 'people', 'side', 'benefit', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'British', 'government', 'first', 'enthusiastic', 'backer', 'what', '2,000,000', 'British', 'anglers', 'who', 'vote', 'who', 'are', 'presumed', 'also', 'idea', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'theme', 'explosions', 'death', 'Unfortunately', 'going', 'take', '10,000', 'salmon', 'hatchlings', 'fishermen', 'go', 'up', 'arms', 'only', 'alternative', 'farmed', 'salmon', 'will', 'run', 'Will', 'migrate', 'establish', 'fishery', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'farmed', 'salmon', 'do', 'run', 'bit', 'later', 'first', 'return', 'where', 'escaped', 'were', 'released', 'then', 'miss', 'anglers', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'earlier', 'get', 'native', 'fish', 'then', 'screw', 'up', 'spawning', 'grounds', 'trying', 'lay', 'own', 'eggs', 'lots', 'emerging', 'reasons', 'not', 'farm', 'salmon', 'currently', 'do', 'not', 'film', 'point', 'fish', 'DO', 'run', 'swim', 'upstream', 'damn', 'swam', 'swam', 'right', 'dam', '.But', 'Western', 'film', 'Brits', 'abroad', 'set', 'Yemen', 'know', 'Middle', 'East', 'whole', 'lot', 'terrorists', 'there', 'way', 'movie', 'Yemenis', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'providing', 'local', 'color', 'antiquated', 'dress', 'weather', 'sculpted', ""'re"", 'ordering', 'assassinations', 'trying', 'destroy', 'things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'policies', 'might', 'be', 'causing', 'animosity', 'treatment', 'Arab', 'street', ""n't"", 'movie', 'either', 'Worse', 'two', 'British', 'characters', 'wander', 'casual', 'western', 'wear', 'more', 'one', 'layer', 'nothing', 'covering', 'arms', 'head', 'just', 'Yemen', 'branch', 'Hyde', 'park', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'tent', 'pjs', 'then', 'out', 'sit', 'next', 'other', 'matter', 'how', 'might', 'outrage', 'locals', 'real', 'world', 'get', 'Brits', 'killed', ""n't"", 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', '.The', 'movie', 'rather', 'simple', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'boy', 'girl', 'join', 'rich', 'sheik', 'dream', 'bring', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'Yemen', 'A', 'few', 'cranky', 'old', 'Arab', 'terrorists', 'cynical', 'British', 'politicians', 'get', 'way', 'end', '34', 'Faith', '34', 'Love', 'triumph', 'salmon', 'run.A', 'lot', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'incredible', 'film']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen
1511181,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B0067EKY7M,G. Teslovich,"[21, 45]","Romance Negatives:(1.) Acting was method, read-the-script unemotional, cutout characterizations. Just stand there and look pretty, not-so-challenging acting. I have seen more natural believable performances from then 9/10 year old actresses Morgana Davies & Garance Le Guillermic.(2.) Formula script of love triangle (two good looking guys chasing one female) so we now know the target audience.(3.) Ethically, a corrupt script. A girl falls into life long love with a soldier who suddenly has to go to Afghanistan. Supposedly a heartfelt and forever love which should survive the dangers that the soldier faces. Subsequently, he goes missing and even possibly killed. His girl's commitment suddenly has a change of heart. She starts falling for her co-worker who happens to be married. His marriage is a bit bland and it's mostly his fault. His solution is to fall in love with the aforementioned more attractive co-worker. The soldier survives and comes back to his love except she is now attracted to that co-worker cheating husband; the one who dissed his wife. Values? Soldier gets dumped while performing his dangerous military duty and cold husband dumps wife for something more attractive.History Negatives:(1.) Movies that pretend to have a real world backdrop should be, at the least, 50% accurate so that the audience has spent some time being more rather than less educated.(2.) Yemen has had a conflict ridden democracy with a President and VP for decades. A Prince would be more accurate for Saudi Arabia - not Yemen. The British, as usual, messed things up in the Middle East after WWII with how they allocated lands and entitlements which is one reason why the area is in constant conflict.  Al-Qaeda and others now take advantage of that and made it into a safe haven war zone. The writer & director have minimized the wealth and religious disparities in that country by scripting a Prince with an ostentatious display of his wealth e.g. using it for a personal fishing stream (irrigation rationale for that geography fails miserably) is irresponsible greed. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie doesn't become a great propaganda tool for Al-Qaeda.(3.) The movie also makes comedic the Yemeni shortage of water. In reality, brief episodes of heavy rain and subsequent ravine flooding makes agriculture there very difficult. This movie's solution is to use aquifer water to sustain the Princes' fishing river year round. A script from out-of-touch writers which makes wasteful misuse of scarce aquifer water a stupid idea and is demeaning to the Yemeni. In this country people are dying because of a lack of water.(4.) The political killings over the decades in Yemen are made movie-comical with an incompetent single assassin who is foiled by our British fish expert by casting a fishing line at him. This was followed by a second assassination attempt created as a not believable river flooding scene meant to drown the Prince; yet again saved by our British fish expert.(5.) It was filmed mostly in Morocco - wonder why. They didn't even bother to show the real Yemen and it's people? Well, they did bother to show fish. Serious out-of-touch writing in showing our British female character inappropriately dressed/behavior as an affront to Islam.(6.) Since salmon occupied such a big part of the movie it would have been more realistic to get Portuguese, Chilean, Californian salmon or better still steelhead.Only Positive:Restaurant scene juxtaposing spaghetti with the tangled iPod earbud cord.

1511184,A3LYXG5HR8ANOQ,B0067EKY7M,ijidude,"[0, 0]","Can the English survive an outlandish plan to bring Western Civilization to Yemen, along the Sinai Peninsula?It's Fishing for Islam in the Yemen, or ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"" the movie.A sheik, played by Amr Waked, is in love with fishing in his posh estate in Scotland, and would like to bring it to more arid land down south.It turns out to be something of a romantic comedy involving two empires - British and Islamic.The movie stars Ewan McGregor as Dr. Afred Jones, Emily Blunt as Harriet Chetwood-Tolbert, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Patricia Maxwell, the prime minister's press secretary.Blunt represents the sheik's financial interests through Fitzharris & Price International Investment Division, with a London office.The breezy contrast between McGregor and the sophisticated Blunt, make the movie work.Maxwell is on the hunt for some good news for His Majesty's Government Press Office and the prime minister to offset the bombing of a mosque in Afghanistan by British military.McGregor is pressured into meeting with Blunt, who represents the sheiks assets in Britain, which includes an estate in Scotland.Yemen gets more rain than Saudi Arabia, she points out to McGregor - up to 250 millimeters of rain per month during some months.The long term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert, she says.McGregor projects the cost at approximately $50 million dollars or pounds.""He's a very keen fisherman,"" she says of the sheik. ""I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheik's motivations. But I will say this. Of all our wealthy clients, he is different. I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.""""A visionary,"" Jones repeats incredulously.""Yes I know, it's not a very fashionable word,"" she says. ""But if you decide to take this project with us, then you can decide for yourself when you meet him.""McGregor leaves, walking into a wall on the way out of her office, prompting a giggle from Blunt.The two join the sheik at his favorite estate in Scotland, where he fishes with Jones.Waked questions McGregor's reluctance to engage in the project.Judged by this particular sheik's behavior, muslim men can act in an honorable and civilized manner.He has benefited from a proper English education, and gained a proper English accent.Can fishing bring a shot of civilization to a Muslim land?It's a question that may be a tale of contrasts between the extreme belief of Islam, and little or no belief by the English, who have mostly given up on God.""You're not a religious man?"" he says to McGregor.""No, I'm not.""""But you are a fisherman, Dr. Jones.""""I'm sorry, I don't follow.""""How many hours do you fish before you catch something? Dozens.""""Hundreds sometimes.""""Is that a good use of your time for a facts and figures man? But you persist, in the wind and the rain and the cold, with such poor odds of success. Why? Because you are a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.""In the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy, with fish.""""With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, your excellency.""""With equal respect, I have to disagree.""""A toast. To faith and fish.""""To faith and fish - and science.""Does fishing demonstrate faith? Or is it simply a sporting way for many English fishermen to pass the time, whether they catch the fish or not?It may be important to point out that is is not necessary to fish in the wind, rain or cold to enjoy fishing.Nevertheless, not only is the sheik a man of great faith, he knows when a woman is unhappy and senses that Blunt is uneasy or unhappy.I have put my feet in it, he says, describing his too sensitive observations.He then violates traditional Muslim culture by shaking hands with Blunt.The sheik gets resistance about the idea from the Muslim tribe in Yemen, who confront him.""These men, they say that by bringing water, life to this dessert, I am bringing the Western ways to our land. They say I have insulted God himself. I say they are fools.""The problem with their argument is that it is actually true.He is bringing Western ways to the dessert, something that Muslims still struggle to accept, even if it means living a better life and saving lives.And the West still has significant problems bringing modern ideas and methods to areas like Afghanistan.Entities like the Taliban make it more difficult to educate young girls in traditional Muslim countries.The Western ideal of helping developing countries to end suffering with modern technology is something that is still being rejected in largely Muslim areas.The sheik has plenty of money to spend on creating an unnatural environment for the fish.And so begins the somewhat wild journey or fantasy, led by an oil-rich sheik.Before the water flows, he addresses the group gathered:""Muslims, Christians - we are all gathered here in an act of faith - and why not.""It's doubtful that there are any British citizens gathered who would claim Jesus Christ or being Christian.It's not even a good idea for Muslims to acknowledge that there are Christians in a Muslim country.Jones does seem to symbolize the British, who don't seem to know what to do with God or faith.It's as though the British are willing to allow the Muslims to take the lead in the faith, since they have become mostly Godless.Though Islam is an extreme religion, producing radical elements, at least the Muslims have more faith than the average British citizen, who believes in his football club more than God.It is a little surprising that the writer included a traditional Islamic weaponry.Though the sheik may be civilized, he still wears his dagger.Traditionally, it isn't used for cleaning fish, but for dismembering infidels. 2012 Larry Ingram",3,Fishing for Islam in the

1511187,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0067EKY7M,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN takes a very unlikely premise and makes it somewhat believable. The movie, based on Paul Torday's acclaimed book of the same title, takes us on a different and somewhat fantasical journey into another side of the Middle East and the mysterious and exotic country Yemen.Egyptian actor Amr Waked stars as an incredibly wealthy sheik who has the dream of bringing salmon visiting to Yemen. Salmon need water and Yemen is not known for its abundance of water nor is it known for cooler temperatures that seem to be the preference of fish. The sheik is a kind-hearted, well-educated and enlighted man who seems to think spending $50 million on this project will bring joy and prosperity to his poor nation.It's up to Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a fisheries expert, to make it work along with the help of the sheik's consultant Harriet (Emily Blunt). The fantasy project comes together after Britain's Prime Minister's press secretary Bridget decides there needs to be a postive story coming out of the Middle East. Why not Salmon fishing in the Yemen. Kristin Scott Thomas is a chain-shoking, hyper-active Bridget who does not know the meaning of ""It can't be done.""The sheik has lofty dreams while Jones is practical. When Harriet's sincere dedication is added to the mix, anything seems possible. There is great chemistry among this cast of talented British and Egyptian actors. They almost get us to believe in the project and its future for Yemen. Unfortunately, the story gets muddled in the waters. Alfred's marriage is falling apart. Harriet's soldier boyfriend who she has just met has disappeared in Afghanistan. Bridget has to deal with angry British fisherman anxious to protect their salmon from being shipped to Yemen. Above all, the sheik's life is in constant dangers from elements within his country who think his project will shame and ruin Yemen.If you've gotten this far, you can probably guess the story and the familiar plot. A fun idea becomes another run of the mill story about boy meets girl under difficult circumstances and a dream brings them together.SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN does have its charm along with beautiful scenery in Scotland and Morocco (who fills in for Yemen--probably not the safest place to film a movie at this time in history). Yemen is a lovely and exotic country and it is sad Morocco had to be the double. It's not a fulfilling movie but pleasant enough with a dream cast of great actors.",4,WELL-INTENTIONAL BUT LACKING STORY OF INSPIRATION,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2466,"['SALMON', 'FISHING', 'IN', 'THE', 'YEMEN', 'very', 'unlikely', 'premise', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'movie', 'based', 'Paul', 'Torday', 'acclaimed', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'different', 'somewhat', 'fantasical', 'journey', 'side', 'Middle', 'East', 'mysterious', 'exotic', 'country', 'Yemen.Egyptian', 'actor', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', 'sheik', 'who', 'dream', 'bringing', 'salmon', 'visiting', 'Yemen', 'Salmon', 'need', 'water', 'Yemen', 'not', 'known', 'abundance', 'water', 'known', 'cooler', 'temperatures', 'seem', 'be', 'preference', 'fish', 'sheik', 'kind-hearted', 'well-educated', 'enlighted', 'man', 'who', 'think', 'spending', '50', 'million', 'project', 'will', 'bring', 'joy', 'prosperity', 'poor', 'nation.It', 'up', 'Alfred', 'Jones', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fisheries', 'expert', 'make', 'work', 'along', 'help', 'sheik', 'consultant', 'Harriet', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'fantasy', 'project', 'together', 'Britain', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'press', 'secretary', 'Bridget', 'there', 'be', 'postive', 'story', 'coming', 'Middle', 'East', 'Why', 'not', 'Salmon', 'fishing', 'Yemen', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'chain-shoking', 'hyper-active', 'Bridget', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'meaning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'sheik', 'lofty', 'dreams', 'Jones', 'practical', 'When', 'Harriet', 'sincere', 'dedication', 'added', 'mix', 'anything', 'possible', 'great', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'talented', 'British', 'Egyptian', 'actors', 'almost', 'get', 'believe', 'project', 'future', 'Yemen', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'muddled', 'waters', 'Alfred', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'Harriet', 'soldier', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'disappeared', 'Afghanistan', 'Bridget', 'deal', 'angry', 'British', 'fisherman', 'anxious', 'protect', 'salmon', 'being', 'shipped', 'Yemen', 'sheik', 'life', 'constant', 'dangers', 'elements', 'country', 'who', 'think', 'project', 'will', 'shame', 'ruin', 'Yemen.If', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'far', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'story', 'familiar', 'plot', 'fun', 'idea', 'run', 'mill', 'story', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'dream', 'together.SALMON', 'FISHING', 'IN', 'THE', 'YEMEN', 'have', 'charm', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Scotland', 'Morocco', 'who', 'Yemen', 'probably', 'not', 'safest', 'place', 'film', 'movie', 'time', 'history', 'Yemen', 'lovely', 'exotic', 'country', 'sad', 'Morocco', 'had', 'be', 'double', 'not', 'fulfilling', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'dream', 'cast', 'great', 'actors']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

Who'd pay attention to something called &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34;?  But I loved this movie enough to recommend it to anybody who'd stand still long enough to listen to me.  Its theme is implausibly simple:  An aggressive English politico, played flawlessly by wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas, decides to &#34;lighten up&#34; the dark and dismal sides of the war in the Middle East  by finding something to distract the public.  That something turns out to be a wealthy sheik's desire to introduce salmon into the bone-dry Yemen.  The technology involved in this goofy idea will cost millions, but he's willing to spend it.  And guess what?  He's not doing this purely so he can selfishly fish in his own backyard; he wants to pull together all those who will be involved in the project, including Emily Blunt, who represents the &#34;agency&#34; that handles his finances; and Ewan McGregor, who believes salmon won't survive in the desert any better than ravens will swim at the bottom of the ocean.Add to this the fact that Emily's soldier boyfriend is mia in Afghanistan and Ewan's marriage should have been scrapped years ago, and you have the unlikely basis for love.  As you'd expect, these two are brought together as their individual and mutual passions for succeeding in their project grow.  Predictably, Emily's boyfriend miraculously survives an attack that killed everyone in his squad, showing up just when things look like they might work out for her and Ewan.  But the resolution is lovely, even if you think it's as improbable as a few salmon surviving the subterfuge that destroys the entire project.Most impressive is that the sheik is shown in a believably favorable light, which flies in the face of present-day racial profiling and bigotry.  Although he is the victim of &#34;bad Arabs&#34;, he's unquestionably a &#34;good Arab&#34;, a visionary, a poet, a man of faith and a believable hero.  It's about time the entire world saw a portrait of a middle-Easterner that was not designed by George Bush.  There is good in every group, and it's nice to be reminded of this in a movie.Please give &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; a look-see.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[82, 87]","The Yemen is a river in the country of Yemen, which occupies the south-western corner of the Arabian Peninsula. As we know, that entire middle-eastern area is hot, dry, and arid. In this Lasse Halstrom-directed dramedy, an oil-billionaire sheik from Yemen owns several estates in Scotland and has developed a fondness for fly fishing. He dreams of a way to bring the sport to his homeland and at the same time encourage his fellow countrymen to upgrade their way of life with an improved water supply.We loved this cast (mostly) from the UK:* Emily Blunt (""The Devil Wears Prada"") is the first person contacted by the sheik. Her job is to research the practicality of the idea and make a recommendation. To complicate matters, her fianc&eacute; is soon reported missing in (military) action in Afghanistan.* Ewan McGregor (""Beginners"") is a mid-level bureaucrat with a touch of Asperger's who loves fly fishing on weekends. When approached about the feasibility of this experiment, he makes outlandish demands, assuming that their cost will deter these foolish people. He is struck dumb when his demands are met, e.g., the engineers who designed the Three Gorges Dam in China.* Kristen Scott Thomas (""Nowhere Boy"") is a blunt, plain-spoken government official who can see the public relations advantages for news from the Mid-east that doesn't include the escalating price of petroleum or body bags. She is hilarious in this (initially) preposterous plot and provides many laugh-out-loud moments. You will LOVE her e-mails!* Amr Waked (""The Father and the Foreigner"") is the fabulously wealthy sheik with the dream. It's obvious that he is intelligent and has already studied the situation. When our troubled heroine denies she is anxious, he says, ""I have too many wives not to know when a woman is upset!"" We can see why this actor is a heartthrob in his native Egypt.* Tom Mison (""One Day"") is our heroine's fianc&eacute;, loving, considerate AND handsome!I haven't read Paul Torday's novel on which this film is based, but knowing salmon are anadromous, I suspect the migration to salt water would be too hot and arduous, so I personally had reservations about feasibility.

1511202,AEJAGHLC675A7,B0067EKY7M,John Williamson,"[2, 2]","WatchingSalmon Fishing in the Yemenfor the fist time, one might think of it as touching, funny, slightly inane, and somewhat unexpected. I should add delightful as well. There are some thoughtful and undeveloped undercurrents of some serious topics here, but this is a movie to just sit back and enjoy.The film was adapted for film by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, from British writer and author Paul Torday's 2006 debut novelSalmon Fishing in the Yemen, which won the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing.We have a plan dreamed up by a visionary sheik played by Amr Waked, and the sheik has the financial resources to turn a Middle Eastern desert into a recreational utopia for sport fishermen. Our sheik seems to be a New Age mystic of sorts, who is given to letting loose with a bit of inspirational gibberish at times... and for this viewer, this just adds to the story. Add in Kristin Scott Thomas's depiction of Patricia Maxwell, the British prime minister's press secretary, and she snaps her dialogue with a real tone of severe icy disdain.The sheik is an avid fly fisherman who has an estate in Scotland, and he visualizes a prodigious water management project that involves the construction of a salmon run in which the salmon can swim upstream to spawn. He declares that this will bring his preferred leisure activity closer to home and will also help his people. The sheik's plan is proposed to the British government by his assistant, Harriet (Emily Blunt), and Patricia Maxwell sees this as a perfect opportunity to distract the public from the conflicts in the Middle Eastern conflicts, resulting in political points for her boss.Dr. Alfred `Fred' Jones (played by Ewan McGregor) is a British fisheries expert is approached to assess the feasibility of the idea, which would involve importing thousands of North Atlantic salmon from Britain to Yemen. He believes this plan to be ridiculous and impossible to carry out, and he dismisses the idea. But Patricia has done her research and has found that two million British voters are fishing enthusiasts, so she pressures Fred's boss to force his participation in this scheme.However there's an uproar that follows when British fishermen learn that their salmon stock will be depleted. The only solution to this dilemma is to use farmed salmon, which have absolutely no river experience. Then comes the big question as to whether farmed salmon will follow their wild brethren's instincts and head upstream.Fred is an unhappily married bureaucrat whose cold wife of two decades leaves him for months at a time to conduct her business in other places. He develops an undeclared romantic attraction to Harriet, but her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) is fighting overseas. She receives news that Robert is missing in action, and she falls apart.There's a perfunctory subplot where the sheik becomes the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, but the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with terrorism: it comes when the farmed salmon are released into the waters of their new home. Will the farmed salmon follow their wild comrades' instincts and head upstream, or will they just swim around in complete confusion? And will Fred and Harriet and Fred get together? You'll have to see the film for those answers.If anyone wonders about the impact of this movie, a May 2012 article in The Telegraph (UK) noted that the Yemen Tourism Promotion Board had been ""inundated"" with requests about the country following the film's release, and that salmon fishing isn't actually that popular in the Western Asian country, though there are sea fishing opportunities there.Salmon Fishing in the Yemencan be quirky in places, but if you likedThe Best Exotic Marigold HotelorLove Actually, then you'll probably enjoy this film.

1511219,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0067EKY7M,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","When I first heard the title of this film I was curious. After learning what the plot was I thought it was ridiculous. After watching the movie I found it was a wonderful film that I knew I could go back and watch again and still be entertained.The premise of the film is that a sheik in Yemen loves fly fishing. He finds it a relaxing way to spend time and dreams of having his own fishing stream in Yemen. The only problem is that there are no salmon in Yemen. It's also not just the fishing that he wants to bring to his country. The sheik is a visionary, wanting to have peace in his country and hoping to change it for the better. To do so he will spare no expense to make it happen.The sheik contacts his investment consultant in London, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) and tells her to get things started. For Harriet and the group she works for nothing is impossible when it comes to the sheik. She contacts the British government and the PR person in charge thinks it will give them some good press in the hopes of building relations between the two countries.  She doesn't think it will work but that doesn't matter as long as it looks good.The program is passed down the line until it arrives at the desk of Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a bureaucrat who's comfortable in his cubicle doing little and being paid for it. A devout fly fisherman himself, he thinks there is no way possible this could work and tells Harriet so. Her reply is for him to find a way to make it work. Apparently working together will be nothing but a cause of friction between these two.Jones gets things running with the hope that the obstacles he finds will prevent the project from moving forward. Instead the doors are opened for each one to be eliminated due to the involvement of the government. Eventually he finds himself meeting with the sheik himself to discuss the project. What he finds, the man he meets and talks with, changes his attitude toward not just the project but his life as well.Against all odds the project does move forward. Salmon are found and a way to relocate them is made. The river that they intend to bring the salmon to is made and will not only be a place for the fish but will change the world of Yemen as well. Unfortunately not everyone in that country agrees with the sheik and problems are set in motion at the same time the project moves forward.The nicest thing about this film is that it isn't just about the building of a river to be stocked with fish not natural to the location. It's about life and people and the effects they have on one another. The images of the salmon swimming upstream make for a wonderful metaphor to life lived in pursuit of a dream, constantly battling the flow of the river in the hopes of reaching a goal.The story also revolves around not just the project but the characters played by Blunt and McGregor. While Blunt is engaged to an MIA soldier and McGregor is married, both are not in relationships they necessarily want. Blunts was short lived, having met the man she fell in love with shortly before he disappeared. McGregor is married to a woman more concerned with her status in life, her career and moving upward in social status than she is in him and his dreams. The pair come together to see the project become a reality and in so doing find one another as well. How that will play out between the return of the missing soldier and McGregor's marriage is resolved before the film ends.The movie is visually attractive, making the area that is supposed to be Yemen attractive in its own way. The possibilities of making this area not just productive but attractive to tourists and the like becomes believable. It would be wonderful for something like this, something that would make this area of the world a beautiful place to be would happen. But as the story progresses the chances of that happening are less than hopeful due to the politics of the land.The romance between the two leads is well played and more tender than one would expect. In a world where most movies find the main characters ready to forget their world and responsibilities and ready to jump into bed at the drop of a hat, these characters slowly find one another. The sexual chemistry between them is one that builds and simmers but never becomes physical.

1511221,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B0067EKY7M,maskirovka,"[4, 5]","I love Emily Blunt.  I think I'd pay to watch a movie where she did nothing but read from a newspaper.  I also think Yemen is a fascinating --albeit in a terrible way-- country.  So I was eager to see this movie that is billed more or less as a breezy romantic comedy set in Yemen.The movie's basic plotting is pretty predictable with Emily Blunt's character worrying over the fate of her soldier boyfriend who is missing in action and slowly falling in love with Ewan McGregor.  But I could put up with a movie like that being predictable as long as it is cute and appealing.But my ability to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the story can't stand up to my knowledge that no one in the modern era would ever consider introducing salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into Yemen, a country:-that suffers from a horrific shortage of water-is beset by terrible poverty that would make the idea of outlaying millions and millions of dollars for such a project almost obscene-is beset by ongoing political turmoil over who will get to rule Yemen ever since the long-serving dictator (er...I mean president...departed from the scene).-is host to the most virulent and vibrant affiliate of al-Qa'ida in the world-also has a slow burning insurgency involving the Houthi tribesmen (Shi'as who hate and are hated by the Sunnis of the country)-that has serious problems over southerners still angry over the forced merger of Yemen over 20 years agoAnother telltale about how implausible this movie is where it was filmed. It was not anywhere near Yemen but in Morocco.Bottom line:  I read about the novel that this film is based on...that it's satirical account of the salmon fishing project.  If the movie had played it like a story out of the Onion, I think ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" would have been a good movie.  But playing it as a gentle, pleasant romantic comedy just doesn't work because Yemen is such a disaster area.  It seems almost in bad taste to set such a story there...the same way a light-hearted romantic comedy in Nazi-occupied Poland would be.So my advice is that it should only be watched if you are a die-hard Emily Blunt fan and you're either ignorant of the reality of Yemen or are somehow able to ignore that reality.",2,I really wanted to like this movie but my knowledge of Yemen made it impossible,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,2237,"['love', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'think', ""'d"", 'pay', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'did', 'nothing', 'read', 'newspaper', 'also', 'think', 'Yemen', 'fascinating', 'terrible', 'way', 'country', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'movie', 'billed', 'more', 'breezy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'Yemen.The', 'movie', 'basic', 'plotting', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'worrying', 'fate', 'soldier', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'missing', 'action', 'slowly', 'falling', 'love', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'could', 'put', 'up', 'movie', 'being', 'predictable', 'as', 'long', 'cute', 'appealing.But', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'just', 'enjoy', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'knowledge', 'one', 'modern', 'era', 'would', 'ever', 'consider', 'introducing', 'salmon', 'sport', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'Yemen', 'country', '-that', 'horrific', 'shortage', 'water-is', 'beset', 'terrible', 'poverty', 'would', 'make', 'idea', 'outlaying', 'millions', 'millions', 'dollars', 'project', 'almost', 'obscene-is', 'beset', 'ongoing', 'political', 'turmoil', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'rule', 'Yemen', 'ever', 'long-serving', 'dictator', 'mean', 'president', 'departed', 'scene', '.-is', 'host', 'most', 'virulent', 'vibrant', 'affiliate', ""al-Qa'ida"", 'world-also', 'slow', 'burning', 'insurgency', 'involving', 'Houthi', 'tribesmen', ""Shi'as"", 'who', 'hate', 'are', 'hated', 'Sunnis', 'country', 'serious', 'problems', 'southerners', 'still', 'angry', 'forced', 'merger', 'Yemen', '20', 'years', 'agoAnother', 'telltale', 'how', 'implausible', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'not', 'anywhere', 'Yemen', 'Morocco.Bottom', 'line', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'satirical', 'account', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'project', 'movie', 'had', 'played', 'story', 'Onion', 'think', 'Salmon', 'Fishing', 'Yemen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'playing', 'gentle', 'pleasant', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'Yemen', 'such', 'disaster', 'area', 'almost', 'bad', 'taste', 'set', 'story', 'there', 'same', 'way', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Poland', 'would', 'be.So', 'advice', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'watched', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'fan', ""'re"", 'ignorant', 'reality', 'Yemen', 'are', 'somehow', 'able', 'ignore', 'reality']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

Salmon Fishing is a cinematic sugar snack that will please most viewers with its sunny, sandy optimism and pleasant leading characters with nary a dark side among them.  Yes, some nasty terrorists show up, and a few humans and fish lose their lives, but this movie pushes on with its gentle, sentimental tones to a place we all know it's headed from the get-go (romantic happiness and professional success in the Arabian peninsula).  Premised almost like a 1930s screwball comedy (and acted by Kristin Scott-Thomas as if she'd been cast in one), the movie unfortunately has far less comic energy (this Salmon's a low-carb snack).  The story takes its sweet time to get to the Yemen and other plot-point destinations, and isn't afraid of melodramatic twists and turns.

1511225,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0067EKY7M,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Lasse Hallstrom is famous for making whimsical films. His movies tend to stand or fall on their screenplays. But with ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen""--with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy, taken from a novel by Paul Torday--Hallstrom taps into an appealing British sense of whimsy that elevates the movie.The story concerns Alfred (Ewan McGregor), a scientist in the British government's Department of Fisheries, and Harriet (Emily Blunt), a public relations executive. Harriet represents a wealthy Yemeni sheik (Amr Waked) who wants to make his country a salmon fisherman's paradise. Alfred at first condemns the plan as ridiculous, but soon the government--seeking any sort of positive news from the Middle East--forces him to take part, and he soon becomes obsessed. He and Harriet also become obsessed with each other, but there are complications: Alfred's brittle, ambitious wife (Rachael Stirling) and Harriet's Army officer boyfriend (Tom Mison). Meanwhile, Islamist fanatics oppose the sheik's plan, and seek to sabotage it by any means possible.There isn't all that much to the story of ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"" but Alfred, Harriet and the sheik are three of the most lovable characters in recent movies, and you come to care deeply about them and their plans. Alfred in particular is delightful, and Ewan McGregor gives one of his best-ever performances playing him. Also a standout is Kristin Scott Thomas as a profane, hard-charging government flack whose enthusiasm for the title project waxes and wanes with the latest opinion polls.

While this sounds preposterous on its surface, there is a section of the country that is mountainous and has a healthy river.  The sheik hires a British consulting firm to explore the possibilities.  In charge of the assignment, Harriet (Emily Blunt) arranges a meeting between the sheik and a fishing expert played by Ewan McGregor.  Pushing things along is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), the Prime Minister's publicist.Director Lasse Hallstrom's film is an unassuming attempt at a romantic comedy, but there is little romance and not much comedy.  I'm not being overly critical as the film evolves into a complicated light drama.  We pretty much know up front that the two charming and attractive stars will eventually get romantically entangled, but both appear to be in solid relationships.  Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor) is married to a woman (Catherine Steadman) with her own career and who travels regularly.  Harriet is in a relatively new relationship with a British soldier (Tom Mison) with a new assignment in Afghanistan.The heart of the movie is the slow appreciation for each other as working partners.  Harriet and Alfred after a contentious beginning find common ground with each other and the project.  Sheik Muhammed is the wise catalyst.  McGregor and Blunt have wonderful chemistry and we certainly want to see them together.  But this is a chaste relationship and their current partners are not unlikeable.  A difficult acting assignment no matter how well the story is written.While I enjoyed this film very much, a couple subplots emerge that are unnecessary.  We are in the Middle East, so I guess that means a potential for terrorist activity.  While brief, this injection just didn't feel right with this film and doesn't help the already dilatory pacing.The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  Shot on film, it looks wonderful in 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ration.  Colors are wonderful, the look is crisp and sharp.  The beautiful photography comes across with no issues that I could see.  The audio, likewise is crystal clear using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.

1511278,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0067EKY7M,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Some movies are written off because of their titles and it takes a while for them to gain an audience. Few people knew what The Shawshank Redemption was before it was released on VHS. Another confusing title is The World's Fastest Indian? Is it about an athlete of some kind? While other movies, such as Freedom Writers and The Reader, simply sound boring. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is in danger of being dismissed due to its title, but that would be a mistake.Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a fisheries expert, and he seems like a boring man. His existence is dull and safe. His relationship with his wife is one of mutual tolerance, and they do not share the same passions. He only drinks alcohol on the weekend, and only after 7pm. Nobody takes him seriously at work either, so he has little to look forward to.Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked) is a keen fisherman, but that's not an easy hobby to satisfy when you are surrounded by sand. He recruits a team to investigate the possibility of building a river in the desert, and populating it with salmon, so that he can pursue his passion for fishing. Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) is given the task of recruiting Jones and anyone or anything else that might be needed to complete the project. She's in a new relationship and loves a soldier, but that is put on hold when he is called up for duty.The movie is heavily influenced by romance. Harriet is in a hopeful new relationship, Jones is in a tired marriage, and could there even be the possibility of romance between the two with them working so closely together? The other main element is humor. The largely British cast influences the tone, and the humor is more subtle and understated than in typical North American comedies. I found myself smiling often, rather than laughing out loud. Most of the laughs come at the expense of Jones, who is set in his routines and is a quirky individual.Jones doesn't treat the project seriously because it sounds so ludicrous, but his outlook changes when he meets Sheikh Muhammed, who is one of the most likable characters in the movie.Blunt is not a typical beauty, but she's a good actress. I was impressed with her performances in Sunshine Cleaning and The Adjustment Bureau, and she's just as effective in this movie. She has a certain warmth and vulnerability that works well for a romantic lead. McGregor most recently caught my attention in The Ghost Writer, and he plays Jones perfectly.However, the movie is more than a romantic comedy. The two leads are required to pull off several emotional scenes, especially in the final act.One character who elicits laughs in every scene in which she appears is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), who plays the British Prime Minister's aide. She's the main villain in the story and is always out to manipulate the situation in order to gain votes and positive mentions in the newspapers.I'm not entirely sure who the movie is aimed at, but it worked for me. It won't change your life with a dramatic message that you've never seen before, but it's an enjoyable place to visit for a while.The Blu-ray presentation is strong and the desert scenes look particularly impressive. Special features are sparse and total just over 16 minutes.Overall score 3.75/5",4,"More than a romantic comedy, but less than a serious drama",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,3267,"['movies', 'are', 'written', 'off', 'titles', 'while', 'gain', 'audience', 'Few', 'people', 'knew', 'what', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'confusing', 'title', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'athlete', 'kind', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'Reader', 'simply', 'sound', 'boring', 'Salmon', 'Fishing', 'Yemen', 'danger', 'being', 'dismissed', 'due', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'mistake.Dr', 'Alfred', 'Jones', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fisheries', 'expert', 'boring', 'man', 'existence', 'dull', 'safe', 'relationship', 'wife', 'one', 'mutual', 'tolerance', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'same', 'passions', 'only', 'alcohol', 'weekend', 'only', '7pm', 'Nobody', 'seriously', 'work', 'either', 'little', 'look', 'forward', 'to.Sheikh', 'Muhammed', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'keen', 'fisherman', 'not', 'easy', 'hobby', 'satisfy', 'when', 'are', 'surrounded', 'sand', 'team', 'investigate', 'possibility', 'building', 'river', 'desert', 'populating', 'salmon', 'so', 'can', 'pursue', 'passion', 'fishing', 'Harriet', 'Chetwode-Talbot', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'given', 'task', 'recruiting', 'Jones', 'anyone', 'anything', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'needed', 'complete', 'project', 'new', 'relationship', 'soldier', 'put', 'hold', 'when', 'called', 'up', 'duty.The', 'movie', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'romance', 'Harriet', 'hopeful', 'new', 'relationship', 'Jones', 'tired', 'marriage', 'could', 'there', 'even', 'be', 'possibility', 'romance', 'two', 'working', 'so', 'closely', 'together', 'other', 'main', 'element', 'humor', 'largely', 'British', 'cast', 'tone', 'humor', 'more', 'subtle', 'understated', 'typical', 'North', 'American', 'comedies', 'found', 'smiling', 'often', 'rather', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Most', 'laughs', 'come', 'expense', 'Jones', 'who', 'set', 'routines', 'quirky', 'individual.Jones', ""n't"", 'treat', 'project', 'seriously', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'outlook', 'changes', 'when', 'Sheikh', 'Muhammed', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', 'movie.Blunt', 'not', 'typical', 'beauty', 'good', 'actress', 'was', 'impressed', 'performances', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'just', 'as', 'effective', 'movie', 'certain', 'warmth', 'vulnerability', 'well', 'romantic', 'lead', 'McGregor', 'most', 'recently', 'caught', 'attention', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'Jones', 'perfectly.However', 'movie', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'required', 'pull', 'off', 'several', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'especially', 'final', 'act.One', 'character', 'who', 'laughs', 'scene', 'Patricia', 'Maxwell', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'aide', 'main', 'villain', 'story', 'always', 'out', 'manipulate', 'situation', 'order', 'gain', 'votes', 'positive', 'mentions', 'newspapers.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'who', 'movie', 'aimed', 'worked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'dramatic', 'message', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'enjoyable', 'place', 'visit', 'while.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'strong', 'desert', 'scenes', 'look', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'sparse', 'total', 'just', '16', 'minutes.Overall', 'score', '3.75/5']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

Men fall all over themselves in this film to be part of Blunt's life, as if her beauty is all any man needs. She says and does nothing in this production to warrant a man's fancy - no fantastic song and dance routine (Barbara Streisand in ""Funny Girl""; no sterling comedic talent (Goldie Hawn in ""Foul Play""). According to this film's producers, Blunt just has to be. What bologna. The only extraordinary thing about Blunt's character, Harriet, in this film is she represents a Yemeni sheikh who has an extraordinary idea, and somehow Harriet is supposed to share credit for that. As if I had been present when Edison invented the light bulb, I get credit for that achievement.The hypocrisy I refer to in title of my review is CBS Films producing a movie in which a ""big oil"" man, and a religious one, is portrayed favorably. CBS Films is a subsidiary of CBS Corp. which willingly allows it's identity to be shaped by it's news organization.

Yet CBS Corp. has no problem portraying a deeply religious ""big oil"" man from Yemeni as wise, compassionate, and visionary.

A visionary sheik (Amy Waked) believes his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fly fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert.  Willing to spare no expense, he instructs his representative, Harriet (Emily Blunt), to turn his dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert, Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor), who thinks the project is both absurd and unachievable. When British government publicist Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas) champions it as a good-will story, however, the unlikely team puts everything on the line to prove the impossible is possible.Metaphorically, the movie contains the message that we can find our oases no matter the desert.  Also resonating is that, with unlimited resources, the wildest, craziest dream can be pursued, if not fully realized.  McGregor and Blunt are the film's best ingredients.  Both have charm, and it's fun to watch the scientifically oriented Dr. Jones become immersed in politics as a romance with Harriet blossoms.

If you're a fan of the Hollywood tropes of ""being in love but finding that there is someone whom you actually love more, or really or truly or whatever, out there and that you can fall in love with them and leave your other love(r) behind"" then this movie may be for you.  When you get down to the bones of it that's what this movie is about though it addresses it in a more complicated, adult manner than romantic comedies like ""Sleeping In Seattle"" or ""You've Got Mail"" do.  The reason that this all feels much more complex or ""deep"" is due to the vision of the Sheikh, a Yemenese man who wants to bring water (not just fishing) to an arid locale and improve his people's socio-political positions and up their general quality of life.  His vision that goes beyond the restrictions of his local politics is the metaphor for the blossomings of love and personhood in the lives of romantic leads McGregor and the lovely Blunt.So an ""A"" for effort in taking a different approach to a particular Hollywood trope but don't be fooled into believing that we can escape into love if we can just find it instead of doing the hard work and loving the people to whom we have already been giving.3.5 stars.",3,A slowly paced movie puts a spin on the same old Hollywood love affair.,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1331,"['Recommended', 'one', 'sister', 'favorite', 'movies', 'little', 'romantic', 'drama', 'think', 'feels', 'bigger', 'actually', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hollywood', 'tropes', 'being', 'love', 'finding', 'someone', 'whom', 'actually', 'love', 'more', 'really', 'truly', 'whatever', 'there', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'leave', 'other', 'love', 'r', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'When', 'get', 'down', 'bones', 'what', 'movie', 'more', 'complicated', 'adult', 'manner', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Sleeping', 'Seattle', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'do', 'reason', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'deep', 'due', 'vision', 'Sheikh', 'Yemenese', 'man', 'who', 'bring', 'water', 'not', 'just', 'fishing', 'arid', 'locale', 'improve', 'people', 'socio-political', 'positions', 'up', 'general', 'quality', 'life', 'vision', 'restrictions', 'local', 'politics', 'metaphor', 'blossomings', 'love', 'personhood', 'lives', 'romantic', 'leads', 'McGregor', 'lovely', 'Blunt.So', 'A', 'effort', 'taking', 'different', 'approach', 'particular', 'Hollywood', 'trope', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'believing', 'can', 'escape', 'love', 'can', 'just', 'find', 'instead', 'doing', 'hard', 'work', 'loving', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'giving.3.5', 'stars']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

After Harriet (Blunt) contacts Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor) about a Shiek from Yemen who wants to bring the sport of salmon fishing to his country he laughs it off. After being given no choice in the matter Jones begins to do just enough to keep his job. After meeting the Shiek and helping Harriet through a crisis his outlook begins to change. He puts everything he has into making the dream possible. The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you interested and makes you like it when you aren't even in the mood to watch it. I wanted to watch this based off the preview, but at the time I sat down to see it I really wasn't in the mood for a movie like this. It did start off a little slow but quickly sucked me in and by the end I was so into it that I couldn't remember why I didn't want to watch it. I have fished many times but I'm not what you would call an avid fisherman. The reason I say that is because this movie has the perfect balance of enough fishing to keep fisherman entertained, but not enough to make it all about fishing, much like the way ""A River Runs Through It"" did. The last twenty minutes of the movie makes you feel a proverbial ""rollar-coaster"" of emotions. Every few minutes something happens that changes how you feel while not turning into the cheesy and sappy ending that it could have been. Overall, a good movie that people who fish and those who don't will both enjoy. I liked it. I give it a B+.",4,"A very entertaining movie that will appeal to everyone, not just fisherman.

Can it even be called a romantic comedy? There is a central love story, but it's mostly between an eccentric, visionary Sheik(Amr Waked) and his love of fly fishing. So much so that he hatches a screwball plan to bring it to the desert highlands of Yemen. His reasons are grandiose and noble, even if the reality of it borders on impossibility. Doesn't really sound like something to take your girlfriend to on date night, does it? Are we sure this isn't some Werner Herzog documentary or something?Balancing a healthy dose of quirky romance with a touch of political gamesmanship, director Lasse Hallstrom(Chocolat)  trims down the disparate elements of Paul Torday's novel into a film that only manages to succeed on the strength of its amazing leads. Ewan McGregor buttons up his natural charm as Dr. Alfred Jones, a dull, married fisheries expert with an inflated sense of his unimportant government job becomes embroiled in the Sheik's ridiculous plot by a publicity seeking press secretary(Kristin Scott Thomas) for the British Prime Minister. Unhappy at home with a loveless marriage, and now forced into a job he doesn't care for, Alfred has little reason placate the sheik's chosen representative, the optimistic Harriet(Emily Blunt), who has a mouthful of a last name that becomes a running joke unto itself.  Suffering as her new boyfriend was recently called to fight in Iraq, she is thrown into her work as a means of coping.Lacking any sort of narrative momentum, the film isn't helped by an uneven script by the usually reliable Simon Beaufoy(Slumdog Millionaire). The very niche hobby of fly fishing isn't all that exciting on its own, in fact the very point of it seems to be the opposite of that. So you can imagine how engrossing it is to listen to McGregor discussing the different varieties of fishing lures, or if salmon taken from captivity will travel in the right direction. A missed opportunity was had with Thomas's character, as she steals the show when on screen with her boorish, invasive attitude. The film often veers into darker territory than such a light and airy comedy was built to handle, especially as the Sheik's own followers violently reject his plans to transform their homeland. The Sheik's reliance on faith to carry him through the difficult project is met with philosophical resistance by Alfred, a man of pure science. Their debates are brief, but provide some of the film's best moments of insight.It's the awkward, budding relationship between Alfred and Harriet that keeps the film afloat, as McGregor and Blunt have a chemistry together that is obvious even if their characters aren't that interesting individually. Starting out a bit chilly with Alfred's stuffy demeanor, they slowly build a bond through the improbability of their task, and the desire to see the Sheik's dream of achieving international harmony. As their familiarity with one another grows, and Alfred stops acting like a stuffed shirt, the two become a joy to watch. Amr Waked, one of the biggest stars in all of Egypt who recently appeared in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, makes for an impressive and charismatic presence.The disparate plot elements never quite coalesce into a satisfying whole, even as McGregor and Blunt prove to be irresistible. While not a complete success, there's something to be said about a film that dares to swim against the tide.",3,Swims against the tide of other romantic comedies,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3530,"['halfway', 'just', 'saying', 'lengthy', 'title', 'clear', 'Salmon', 'Fishing', 'Yemen', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Can', 'even', 'be', 'called', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'mostly', 'eccentric', 'visionary', 'Sheik', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'love', 'fly', 'fishing', 'So', 'much', 'screwball', 'plan', 'bring', 'desert', 'highlands', 'Yemen', 'reasons', 'are', 'grandiose', 'noble', 'even', 'reality', 'impossibility', ""n't"", 'really', 'sound', 'something', 'take', 'girlfriend', 'date', 'night', 'Are', 'sure', ""n't"", 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'documentary', 'something', 'Balancing', 'healthy', 'dose', 'quirky', 'romance', 'touch', 'political', 'gamesmanship', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Chocolat', 'down', 'disparate', 'elements', 'Paul', 'Torday', 'novel', 'film', 'only', 'succeed', 'strength', 'amazing', 'leads', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'up', 'natural', 'charm', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Jones', 'dull', 'married', 'fisheries', 'expert', 'inflated', 'sense', 'unimportant', 'government', 'job', 'becomes', 'embroiled', 'Sheik', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'publicity', 'seeking', 'press', 'secretary', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Unhappy', 'home', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'now', 'forced', 'job', ""n't"", 'care', 'Alfred', 'little', 'reason', 'placate', 'sheik', 'chosen', 'representative', 'optimistic', 'Harriet', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'mouthful', 'last', 'name', 'running', 'joke', 'Suffering', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'recently', 'called', 'fight', 'Iraq', 'thrown', 'work', 'means', 'coping.Lacking', 'sort', 'narrative', 'momentum', 'film', ""n't"", 'helped', 'uneven', 'script', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'very', 'niche', 'hobby', 'fly', 'fishing', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'own', 'fact', 'very', 'point', 'be', 'opposite', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'engrossing', 'listen', 'McGregor', 'discussing', 'different', 'varieties', 'fishing', 'lures', 'salmon', 'taken', 'captivity', 'will', 'travel', 'right', 'direction', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'had', 'Thomas', 'character', 'show', 'when', 'screen', 'boorish', 'invasive', 'attitude', 'film', 'often', 'darker', 'territory', 'light', 'airy', 'comedy', 'was', 'built', 'handle', 'especially', 'Sheik', 'own', 'followers', 'violently', 'reject', 'plans', 'transform', 'homeland', 'Sheik', 'reliance', 'faith', 'carry', 'difficult', 'project', 'met', 'philosophical', 'resistance', 'Alfred', 'man', 'pure', 'science', 'debates', 'are', 'brief', 'provide', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'insight.It', 'awkward', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Alfred', 'Harriet', 'film', 'afloat', 'McGregor', 'Blunt', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'obvious', 'even', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'individually', 'Starting', 'out', 'bit', 'chilly', 'Alfred', 'stuffy', 'demeanor', 'slowly', 'build', 'bond', 'improbability', 'task', 'desire', 'see', 'Sheik', 'dream', 'achieving', 'international', 'harmony', 'familiarity', 'one', 'grows', 'Alfred', 'acting', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'two', 'become', 'joy', 'watch', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Egypt', 'who', 'recently', 'appeared', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Contagion', 'impressive', 'charismatic', 'presence.The', 'disparate', 'plot', 'elements', 'never', 'quite', 'coalesce', 'satisfying', 'whole', 'even', 'McGregor', 'Blunt', 'prove', 'be', 'irresistible', 'not', 'complete', 'success', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'swim', 'tide']",Salmon Fishing in the Yemen

The doctor thinks the sheik's plan is ""fundamentally unfeasible"" and declines politely, but Prime Minister's press secretary Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), believing this is a great chance to improve the UK-Yemeni relationship, would not take no for an answer.""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" greatly benefits from the chemistry between the stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, and the comedic turn from overzealous press secretary by Kristin Scott Thomas, but curiously director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m seems to have ignored the film's potential for a more involving storyline. Based on a bestselling novel in UK by Paul Torday and adapted by Simon Beaufoy of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame, the film could have been something more than a pleasant if formulaic romance.After all, we don't know why the story must be about ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."" Who is Sheikh Muhammed and what does he want? We are told he is a ""visionary"" person, but even a visionary person would do something when he knows his life is in danger. Also, we are not allowed to know much about Captain Robert Mayers (Tom Mison), Harriet's boyfriend.

1511296,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0067EKY7M,Turfseer,"[0, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The interesting thing about 'Salmon Fishing in Yemen' is that the title represents the film's sub-plot and not the main plot. A wealthy Yemeni Sheikh, Muhammed, seeks to introduce salmon fishing to Yemen. His handler in Great Britain, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt), can't convince Alfred ""Fred"" Jones (Ewan McGregor), a government fisheries expert, to support the project since he believes that Yemen doesn't have the necessary cold temperatures and water to sustain salmon. But when the Prime Minister's cynical press secretary, Patricia Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas), needs a feel-good story to counter all the bad news coming out of Afghanistan, suddenly Fred is forced to make nice to Harriet and actually attempt to make the project work.'Fishing in Yemen' works well when it concentrates on all the machinations involving the push to make the Sheikh's project succeed. Various obstacles crop up, including the fishing industry's objection to depleting UK's stock of fresh water salmon. In Fred's estimation, farm raised salmon still can be utilized, and he predicts that those kind of salmon will also swim upstream. There are also local obstacles to the Sheikh's project in Yemen itself. In a rather unlikely scene, Fred's thwarts the assassination of the Sheikh by a bumbling militant, through the intervention of his fishing reel.But the bulk of 'Fishing' has to do with a love triangle between Fred, Harriet and Harriet's new boyfriend, Robert, who is suddenly missing in action during a secret military mission in Afghanistan. Rather predictably, Fred is on the outs with his workaholic wife, Mary, which opens up the possibility that he can start things up with Harriet. Before you know it, Robert is no longer missing, and Harriet must choose between the two men at film's end.Instead of directly murdering the Sheikh and his friendly UK supporters, the local militants end up destroying his project by letting a dam open, flooding the whole area. Fair enough. But what about the resolution of the love triangle? Well, it's utterly predictable and sentimental--at the last moment, guess who Harriet chooses? And after the whole project is wiped out, the two lovebirds decide to remain in order to reignite the ruined experiment, ignoring the fact that they might be eventually murdered by the same militants who attempted to wipe the Sheikh out earlier as well as destroying his dream.Time Out's David Fear couldn't have said it better when he describes the Sheikh as an ""Arabic version of the Magical Negro'. The Sheikh reminds one more of an expert motivational speaker at a New Age Enlightenment convention, than a real Middle Eastern potentate from that part of the world. Amr Waked is fine in that role as are the other principals, Blunt, McGregor and Thomas.I'm told that the original book the film was based on was much more satirical than the rom-com we find here. Salmon Fishing is mildly entertaining, but eventually devolves into some real gooey, sentimental stuff.

1511299,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0067EKY7M,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[42, 45]","Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a hard film to categorize.  Directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy adapted from the novel of the same name by Paul Torday, you could nominally call it a romantic comedy, but it's actually far more than that.  A character-driven human comedy about faith, passion and fishing comes closer.  Add in an absolutely scene-stealing performance by Kristin Scott Thomas as the Prime Minister's take-no-prisoners get-it-done-yesterday! press secretary and you've got Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.The film begins with Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), the British government's leading expert on fisheries, receiving an inquiry about the feasibility of introducing salmon fishing to the Yemen. Jones quickly dismisses the possibility, responding that it is simply impossible for salmon - a fish that thrives in cold fresh-water streams found in northern latitudes - to survive in a hot and arid environment like the Yemen.  The inquiry, it turns out, came from Harriet Chetwood-Talbot (Emily Blunt), a consultant for a company that manages properties for a very wealthy client, Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) from the Yemen. The Sheikh has a vision of salmon fishing, which he became familiar with due to his having an estate in Scotland, as not only a way to create much needed jobs for his people, but also as a way of bringing people together. Undeterred by Jones' initial rejection and buoyed by the persuasive Sheikh's belief in his vision, Harriet persists in pushing for a feasibility study, which Jones continues to dismiss.  Until, that is, the project comes to the attention of the Prime Minister's press secretary, the highly formidable and relentless Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas).A series of recent news items about bombings and other setbacks in the war in Afghanistan, already highly unpopular, has left the government desperately in need of ""Anglo-Arabian news that isn't about something exploding.""  After tasking her staff with ""We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one, and we need it now. You've got an hour. Get on with it!"" Maxwell seizes on the salmon fishing project as ideal for the government's needs and pushes it forward, riding rough-shod over any and all objections as to the project's chances of actually working.  Which in turn sets everything in motion and brings all of the main characters face to face.Ewan McGregor's Fred Jones is a man who muses ""I was wondering if I was genetically programed to dull pedestrian life.""  He's comfortable in his government job where his biggest challenge is picking out pictures of fish to spice up his annual report; he's married but it's a passionless marriage, as becomes poignantly clear when his wife (Rachel Stirling) takes a several-months assignment in Switzerland, only bothering to tell him as she's packing for the trip.  Emily Blunt's Harriet Chetwood-Talbot, on the other hand, is Fred's exact opposite, passionate in her job and in her private life where she's had a whirlwind romance with a hunk of an army officer (Tom Mison) who's just been deployed to Afghanistan.  And Amr Waked's Sheikh rounds out the trio, a philosophical, quietly charismatic man who has a vision that he pursues all the more passionately because it is so impossible.  A chemistry develops among the three as Fred finds himself - much to his surprise - responding to Harriet's optimistic vivacity and to the Sheikh's belief that the more impossible a thing is, the more it is worth pursuing, even when - or rather especially when - all you have to go on is faith.  In addition to becoming not only engaged by but increasingly  optimistic about the salmon project, Fred also finds himself coming to believe that other things are also possible as his working relationship with Harriet blossoms into something else.  Between the two, Fred ends up making his own leaps of faith, with regard to the Sheikh's fantastical project and to the prospect of finding real love with Harriet.But it is Kristin Scott  Thomas' over-the-top press secretary Patricia Maxwell with her take-no-prisoners  approach to everything who supplies the comedy.  A powerhouse on high heels, Maxwell dominates everyone else around her, up to and including the Prime Minister himself, and she has far and away the best lines in the film which she delivers with acerbic glee -  ""Is that the best you cocked-up, Oxford-educated, moronic buffoons can come up with?""  She also has the best scenes, like ones showing her at home where she's kicking her kids' butts at computer games or ordering them off to school, and you realize that she treats the government ministers above and around her exactly the same way as she handles her kids.  And the scenes showing the IM exchanges between her icon and that of the rather hapless Prime Minister are absolutely priceless.In addition to an engaging script and fine performances by the actors, the cinematography is also quite well done, taking you from highly diverse settings of urban London, rural Scotland and the desert wadis of the Yemen (actually shot in Morocco), all beautifully shot.  The scene where the Sheikh discusses his dream project with Jones while the two are fly-fishing is imbued with a grace and tranquility gives added feeling to the Sheikh's vision and you begin to see exactly what he is talking about.My only quibbles about the film are fairly minor.  The way in which Harriet's boyfriend's ill-timed reappearance is handled is dealt with a bit too neatly and ends up feeling out of place.  And the reactions on the part of the Sheikh and Jones when some disgruntled Yemenis attempt to sabotage the project seems more ""message"" oriented than how real people would actually react.  But those aside, the rest of the film flows quite smoothly, leaving you both entertained and with more than a bit of its quietly infectious optimism.Recommended as a quirky but highly enjoyable film and for Kristin Scott Thomas' riotously over-the-top performance.",4,"A character-driven human comedy about faith, passion and fishing",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,6008,"['Salmon', 'Fishing',
