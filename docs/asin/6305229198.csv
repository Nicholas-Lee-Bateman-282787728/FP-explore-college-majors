Rather than the usual eight or ten man elimination tag matches, they decided to have a tournament for the World Title.We had Vince McMahon making an angle that mocked the &quot;real&quot; incident from the 1997 Survivor Series as The Rock became the &quot;Corporate Champion&quot;. The event itself was just all the tournament matches leading up to a battle between The Rock and Mick &quot;Mankind&quot; Foley.

455064,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,6305229198,D.P.,"[0, 0]","For the second time in history (first being WrestleMania IV), a tournament would determine who would be the new WWF Champion.  There were a bunch of issues between going into this tournament between not only the participants themselves but also with Mr. McMahon himself (who was in a wheelchair at the time) as Big Boss Man had returned to be Mr. McMahon's personal bodyguard, his son Shane had turned against his father only to be downgraded to being a referee, Mankind had aligned himself with Mr. McMahon to the point where he received a corporate makeover, Steve Austin was still out for revenge after being screwed out of his championship, and The Rock also had something to prove due to Vince taking his aggression for the people out on ""The People's Champion.""Dwayne Gill vs. Mankind - Mankind was set to have a mystery opponent in the first round only for it to be revealed as former 1980's ""jobber"" in Dwayne Gill (who we currently know as Gillberg).  This was nothing more than a squash match but it was entertaining to see how Dwayne reacted to not only having his own TitanTron but pyro too.Al Snow vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match marked the WWF PPV debut of Jarrett's former manager in WCW, Debra McMichael while it should also be noted that Al Snow's ""Head"" for some reason was wearing Mankind's ""Mr. Socko"" as a headband.  Past those two notes, this was an average match but nothing noteworthy.Steve Austin vs. Big Boss Man - Both men started brawling before the match began with Austin dominating throughout the match with Boss Man resorting to dirty tactics in order to get himself some leverage.  As the match went on, Boss Man's true intentions were revealed as it wasn't about winning a match more than injuring Austin & taking him out of the tournament.X-Pac vs. Steven (William) Regal - Before we would know him as the current William Regal, he had a short run in the WWF this time as a ""Real Man's Man"" & had an issue with X-Pac for being the European Champion despite not being from Europe.  X-Pac showcased his superior quickness early while Regal responded to that by grounding Pac.  It was a nice back & forth match with the only thing bad I can say about it was that the ending got very confusing for a moment.  As a funny side note, pay attention to Jim Ross on commentary as he kept having referring to Regal as Steve Blackman by accident.Goldust vs. Ken Shamrock - As pointed out in the pre-match interview, Shamrock had won two previous tournaments this year alone (King Of The Ring & for the vacant Intercontinental Title) so he was a heavy favorite going into this tournament.  Both men started out with an aggressive start & traded momentum throughout the match in what was an average encounter.The Rock vs. Big Boss Man - The Rock's original opponent was announced to be Triple H however he hadn't recovered from his knee surgery months earlier allowing Mr. McMahon to announce Boss Man as a last minute replacement.  All I can say here is don't blink.Undertaker vs. Kane - Undertaker & Kane both received a bye in the first round so they would meet each other here in the quarter finals (just like Hogan vs. Andre in the first championship tournament) while it should also be noted that Kane was looking for revenge for not only Undertaker turning his back on him a month earlier but also on Paul Bearer for rejoining Undertaker's side.  This was a very slow paced brawl with both men using impactful power moves & evenly matched throughout the bout with Taker targeting Kane's knee.Al Snow vs. Mankind - Jim Ross made a statement during this match that described both of these men perfectly, ""Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fyne, Dr. Howard"" as both men weren't mentally stable to say the least.  It went back & forth between both men with even a chair getting involved but this was more about Mankind finally finding ""Mr. Socko"" and that being enough motivation for him to turn it up & take it out on not only Snow but ""Head"" as well.The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock - For those trivia fans, this was the seventh time these two have faced each other in some type of match on a PPV within a year.  Just like their previous encounters, it was a match that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being once again Mr. McMahon trying to influence the outcome against The Rock only for it to backfire.  They had better encounters throughout the year but still a nice match.Womens Champion Jacqueline vs. Sable - For the record, this was Shane McMahon's first match as a referee for the night. This match wasn't much as it was Jacqueline dominating (and carrying) Sable only for her to make her comeback & victory as this was all about Sable getting her revenge & finally ending the long feud against not only Jacqueline but also Marc Mero on the outside.Steve Austin vs. Mankind - Mr. McMahon & his ""stooges"" were at ringside for this match as Austin came out aggressive & literally beat the clothes off Mankind before taking the brawl to the outside.  A chair got involved with Mankind using it for a DDT while Austin used it to kick Mankind in the face & make a backdrop more painful.  Things got out of control when Vince came out of his seat to make sure Austin didn't get a victory followed by Shane who came into count the fall only to stop at two & give Austin a ""two count"" of his own.  Just like a year earlier, Mr. McMahon just screwed someone out of the WWF Championship.Undertaker vs. The Rock - They traded momentum here & even took the match into the crowd briefly.  Undertaker kept trying to intimidate the referee at times while both men resorted to cheating behind the referee's back just to get an advantage before the involvement from some of their previous opponents from earlier in the night made the deciding factor here in who was going to the finals of the tournament.WWF Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Headbangers vs. D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry - Before the match got started, we saw possibly the biggest & longest sign ever seen in wrestling history dedicated to the Outlaws.  This was your typical average triple threat rules match with both teams using double teaming tactics & trying to steal pins from the other team.  Average encounter but nothing special past the fan sign.WWF Championship Match: The Rock vs. Mankind - Jim Ross described it best during the match when saying ""The Rock turned it up!"" because this was one of the times you saw The Rock get real aggressive in the ring against Mankind along with taking it outside the ring including various moments such as both men using chairs including Rock repeating slamming the chair onto the steel steps which were on top of Mankind & fighting on the announce tables. In the end, The Rock becomes the Corporate Champion using a finish that was complete ""deja vu.""[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]In the end, this event had some good in-ring action & didn't have a bad match on it but there really wasn't anything that stood out or was really memorable past the tournament final but as the tournament itself was more about setting up & pushing storylines but I'm a big fan of 1998 (my favorite year of the Attitude Era) and thought this was one of the top shows that year so this is a tape that I would get.",4,"Mr. McMahon's ""Deadly

455068,A1V0898YIRFAS3,6305229198,Jose,"[1, 1]","My past memories of previous wrestling cards that I still own to this day continues here with the 1998 Survivor Series. This was a unique event for the Survivor Series as this event didn't center on the usual elimination style matches but instead hosted a 14 man tournament to crown a new WWF Champion. For those that don't remember, back at BreakDown in September, Vince McMahon set up a ""master plan"" to remove the WWF Championship from Stone Cold Steve Austin which was successful. However, there was no champion crowned on that night since the other two opponents (Undertaker & Kane) pinned Austin at the same time. That lead to match at Judgment Day between the brothers with Austin being the guest referee with the stipulation on Austin being that if he didn't crown a champion, he would be fired. Well Austin didn't raise the hand of a champion & was fired on the spot only to be rehired by Shane McMahon who a few weeks prior to the event decided to step up to his dad. The result lead to McMahon setting up a 14-man tournament to crown a new WWF Champion & guaranteed to crwon a new champion. Austin wasn't the only one Vince had a problem with as McMahon also had issues against The Rock but once again thanks to Shane McMahon, found himself back in the championship tournament. Along with those problems, Vince finally opened up & seemed to accept Mankind to the point that he gave him a corporate make-over to fit the look of a new corporate champion. The rules were simple to this tournament in which the first round matches would have a 10 minute time limit, the second round having a 15 minute time limit, the semi-finals having a 30-minute time limit & the finals having an hour time limit. Also due to the issues over the past few months, The Undertaker & Kane received ""byes"" into the second round but with the stipulations, the night promised some fast paced action.Mankind vs Duane Gill. The first match of the opening round of the tournament as Mankind was given a mystery opponent hand-picked by Vince McMahon. Jerry Lawler described this best at the end ""was that a match?"" as Mankind made short work of Gill to the point that Gill's intro was longer than the match with the only thing worth mentioning that I found comical was Gill being scared of his own pyro.Al Snow vs Jeff Jarrett. After having minor interactions over the past few weeks, these two battled here. This went back & forth with Snow even doing a bit of high spots with Debra (looking hot at ringside BTW) getting involved in the finish when both men attempted using ""Head"" but only one was successful with their attempt.Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Big Bossman. Bossman wasted no time as he went after Austin while Austin was making his way to the ring only to be introduced to steel steps. This was a high impact brawl from there but the bigger story was the job that Bossman did with his night stick on Austin that may have caused Austin to win the battle & advance but lose the war as he took a great deal of punishment.X-Pac vs Steven Regal. This was Regal's WWF PPV debut as he was wrestling under his ""Man's Man"" gimmick that really went nowhere as Regal quickly went back to WCW after this match. This was another match that went back & forth as Regal focused on X-Pac's neck with neck cranks, wear down holds & suplexes including a double underhook suplex from the top while X-Pac tried to keep the match at a fast pace where he was gaining some offense. The ending was disappointing as it resulted in a double countout just when the match was starting to get better, although I should mention that with this happening, Steve Austin would receive a ""bye"" into the semi-finals which McMahon tried to over rule but couldn't.Ken Shamrock vs Goldust. This match was more of a showcase for Ken Shamrock as he was in control for the most part of the match with Goldust only getting some offense whenever Shamrock started to lose momentum but it wasn't enough as Shamrock got the win here.The Rock vs Big Bossman. Triple H was originally advertised to be in this match but due to his knee injury (that he suffered at SummerSlam for those keeping track), Patterson & Brisco issued a replacement which turned out to be the Big Bossman. My sentence behind this match was longer as this match has gone down as the fastest match in WWF history even to this day, so don't blink.The Undertaker vs Kane. The first match of the second round (or the quarter-finals) of the tournament. This was a unique setting as it was the first time that these two battled on PPV with both men switching roles here as Kane was a face while Taker was the heel along with having Paul Bearer in his corner. This match is actually better than their future encounters such as SummerSlam 2000, WrestleMania XX or even their 2010 feud as both men exchanged power moves in the ring, brawled on the outside area & even Taker doing moves that you haven't seen from him before such as Booker T's reverse axe kick at one point.Mankind vs Al Snow. This match had a funny backstory as Vince McMahon had stolen ""Mr. Socko"" & wrapped it around ""Head"" to motivate Mankind for this match. These two had a better match than their first round matches here as they had brawl around the outside area & even bringing in a chair to use for impactful moves inside the ring. There was also a comedic moment where Mankind found ""Socko"" around the ""Head"" & even decided to beat up ""Head"" in the process.The Rock vs Ken Shamrock. This didn't top their previous KOTR encounter but this was good match as it went back & forth with Shamrock attacking Rock's ankle at times to set up the ankle lock while Rock refused to quit & even landed his famous DDT at one point. However, the bigger story here was the appearance of the Big Bossman who played a factor in this match with his night stick but in a way that he wasn't intending to.WWF Women's Champion Jacqueline vs Sable. Earlier in the night on HEAT, Jacqueline layed out another attack on Sable that you saw her selling in the early going. It should be noted that Shane McMahon was the referee for this match. Everyone that seen a Sable match knows that a Sable is only good when the match is kept short & her opponent heavily sells. That was the case here as Sable was dominate throughout the match with Jacqueline getting a shot here & there but again, Sable was dominant to the point where she even gave Marc Mero a powerbomb on the floor in this short match.Mankind vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. The first of two semi-final matches of the tournament & before the match got underway, Vince McMahon made his way to the ring with Patterson, Brisco & Commissioner Slaughter. This was a wild match between these two as Austin attacked Mankind quickly in the early stages to the point that Austin ripped up Mankind's tuxedo & even nailed him in the head with his own shoes. However, the highlight of this match was Vince McMahon delivering his promise in that Austin would be screwed (doesn't that sound familiar at Survivor Series?) in a huge swerve that nobody, even Austin, saw coming.The Rock vs The Undertaker. Around 7 months before they would go on to their most memorable encounter at the King Of The Ring '99, they battled here in what was a good match that again, went back & forth between the two with Rock again adding some entertainment by mocking Taker & Paul Bearer after delivering a DDT at one point during the match. Just like Rock's previous match, Big Bossman did make an appearance here but it was someone else that had problems not with Rock but with Taker that made a bigger impact on the outcome of this match that even lead to a huge brawl into the crowd.WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs The Headbangers vs D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry. The story here was that the team of the Headbangers, Brown & Henry had made a pact to work together to take out the Outlaws & settle the action among themselves which was shown in the opening video from their attack on the Outlaws earlier in the night on HEAT. This was different than the common triple threat team matches that we see as one person from each team was allowed to be in the ring instead of the usual one-on-one action. This was a good average match between these three teams with the action getting out of control at times that the referee couldn't control the action.WWF Championship Finals Match: The Rock vs Mankind. The finals of the tournament to crown a new WWF Champion. Both men started off a bit cautious in trying to feel each other out with both men going through tough matches in the previous round & as an added fact, Vince & Shane McMahon made their way to the ringside area at one point during the match. This match certainly picked up from there as both men were no longer patient & as Jim Ross said at one point ""turned it up"". They battled in the crowd with Rock hitting Mankind in the head with a trash can, fighting all over the announce tables with Mankind taking a sick fall through the Spanish announce table, both men using chairs & steel steps with a sick moment of Rock slamming the chair into the steps about six times with Mankind being under them. However, the surprise at the end was the conclusion where it was revealed that The Rock was working with the McMahons the whole time with a ""screwjob finish"" similar to last years Survivor Series resulting in The Rock not only becoming the WWF Champion for the first time but also the Corporate Champion.In the end, this is event was very similar to events such as the King Of The Ring, WrestleMania IV & The Wrestling Classic '85 in which due to the structure of the tournament, many matches on the card were kept short including some that looked like was going to get good (X-Pac/Regal) but cut short along with two DUDs (although Rock/Bossman was hilarious & a record-setting match). There were some standout matches throughout the tournament such as Taker/Kane, Rock/Shamrock, Mankind/Austin, Rock/Taker & Rock/Mankind but past that, there was nothing horrible or boring on this card so I enjoyed it overall & would give this a 3.5 star event but again since it can't be done, I would give it a 4 & I would recommend at least taking a look at this one.",4,A Deadly Game,1301788800,"04

455069,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6305229198,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","Last month I reviewed WWF's Judgment Day In Your House from October 1998 & there was no champion at this point for 2 months & this event is known for The Rock winning his 1st of 8 WWF-WWE Championships but is the rest of the show good. This is continuing in a long series of reviews for retro wrestling Pay Per Views which I started off doing NWA-WCW reviews from 1988 to 1994 then I got to WWF PPV's which I started with The 1995 Survivor Series & have continued to this show. Mainly these reviews are geared towards people like me that grew up during this time period in Professional Wrestling. These can good for people who didn't grow up with The Attitude Era & are interested in it. Or you randomly came across this review. Now what has happened since Judgment Day on The October 19th episode of RAW IS WAR Vince McMahon addressed the roster he announced a tournament to crown a new WWF Champion at Survivor Series McMahon who fired Stone Cold Steve Austin was at the arena in cammo he had guns McMahon was taken hostage later on that night he had Vince in the ring where he pulled a 38 revolver on him pulled the trigger out came a flag that said Bang 3 1 6. He caused McMahon to wet himself & he left McMahon a letter. I covered this episode of RAW in my Good Wrestling TV series on The Pro Wrestling Forum here on Amazon. The next week on RAW IS WAR we found out it was Shane McMahon that brought Austin back & signed him to a 5 year deal this was the start of Shane McMahon being an on screen character. The following week on RAW IS WAR Shane McMahon thought he was taking over the company he even gave Stone Cold a WWF title shot for the night after The Survivor Series. Vince McMahon came out he said the only way he's ever going to step down will be the day he dies. He demoted Shane to being a Referee & told Austin he won't get a title shot the day after Survivor Series it will be at The Survivor Series if he can make it the finals of The Deadly Game Tournament. He then turned his anger towards The Rock he was going to take on Ken Shamrock for The Intercontinental Championship McMahon told him if he doesn't win The IC title then he's out of The Deadly Games Tournament the match ended in a DQ he didn't win the title McMahon told The Rock he's out of The Deadly Games Tournament & no longer The Number 1 Contender. The Rock was p  is  s ed he was tearing his Locker Room up. The Police came to arrest The Rock. McMahon also gave Mankind with The Hardcore Championship making him The 1st WWF Hardcore Champion. McMahon had been talking all night long about someone will serve hard times it turned out to be The Stooges cause they walked off 2 weeks earlier when Austin held him hostage. The Big Bossman gave them a really bad beating Austin came down then he got swerved they all started beating up Austin then Shane McMahon came down stood up to The Bossman Vince called them off then The Undertaker came down after Austin they started fighting then Kane came out he sat fire to the cage The Undertaker was double teamed. Now getting back to The Rock on The November 8th episode of Heat McMahon put The Rock in a match against Mark Henry for the next night on RAW & if he lost he would have to leave The WWF but if he won he would be put back in The Deadly Games Tournament. The next night on RAW IS WAR The Rock was attacked in his Locker Room McMahon of course wasn't going to change his mind oh & this episode of RAW was in Dallas he took a shot at The Cowboys he said The Rock was arrested last week he should be at home with The Dallas Cowboys cause most of them are Convicted Felons. Shane came out to confront his Dad & Vince sent The Bossman on him Stone Cold Steve Austin made the save. The Rock came out to compete he fought off The Stooges interference from The Big Bossman & D'Lo Brown to defeat Mark Henry Shane McMahon made the 3 count. On The November 8th episode of Sunday Night Heat Vince McMahon told The New Age Outlaws they would be defending their Tag Team titles at Survivor Series in a Triple Threat Tag Team Match against The Headbangers & Mark Henry & D'Lo Brown. On The October 26th episode of RAW IS WAR Sable challenged Jacqueline for The WWF Women's Championship at Survivor Series. Those were the important events leading into The Survivor Series. The buyrate was an 1.30 that is up from Survivor Series 1997 that got a 0.89.The current champions at the time wereWWF Champion title was declared vacant on September 28th 1998 a tournament was announced on October 19th at Survivor Series to crown a new champion.WWF Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock October 12th 1998WWF European Champion X Pac October 18th 1998WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws Road Dogg Jesse James & BA Billy Gunn.

McMahon called out The Rock. he called out Shane & Stone Cold. Before he could rant at them The Undertaker came out Austin & The Undertaker started fighting X Pac got in & went after The Undertaker. Austin & The Rock were slugging it out. Big Bossman & The Undertaker started slugging it out. You had everybody just about involved in the tournament get in the ring.Then we get to The Pay Per View the opening was good.Now you start off with McMahon making fun of WCW when he called them The Dubbya See Dubbya.

Jim Ross said that wasn't nice of making fun of those less fortunate.McMahon was just gloating he said ""The people sc  re  w  ed the people."" They're just as pathetic & gullible as Mankind he said. He said he will give more details tomorrow night on RAW. He then said ""On behalf of The McMahon Family I was so proud here tonight for a number of reasons 1 of which was that Stone Cold was utterly, totally & royally s  c  re  w  ed in this very ring!"" Vince Told Shane he gave an Academy Award Winning Performance. The Rock who had turned heel after becoming a fan favorite told the fans to kiss his a  ** & ""SMELLLAH WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKIN!""Mankind was wanting to know what was going on since he didn't submit to The Sharpshooter. The Rock hit Mankind in the back of the head with The WWF title put the boots to him then gave him The Rock Bottom. McMahon put the title around The Rock's waist. Stone Cold returned The Rock & Austin started fighting ending with The Rock getting a Stone Cold Stunner. Then he gave Mankind a Stunner. He gave The Rock another beating. The Home Video Footage had The Rock boasting about winning The WWF title & cutting a great promo.Now final thoughts if you're expecting a good wrestling show then don't watch this. I can recommend it if you like layered storylines & swerves when they were fashionable don't hesitate to purchase in fact I'd say buy the Classic 5 Of 1998 Box Set that came out in 99 that way you'll get The Royal Rumble 98 which was a very good show. Wrestlemania XIV a solid show. King Of The Ring 1998 which was another very good show & you'll get Summerslam 1998 an excellent show. Next Pay Per View review whenever I can get to it will be Capital Carnage a UK event from December 1998 then I will review the last WWF Pay Per View from 1998 Rock Bottom In Your House.",2,The 1998

I also didn't like the draw in the Steven Regal vs. X-Pac match and I really didn't like the match between The Rock & The Big Bossman(subbing for Triple H)which was the shortest match in the tournament. Other then that, I like it overall. The Best match in the show was The Rock vs Mankind which was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl. The worst match was Mankind vs Duane Gill which was a short,dumb & one-sided filler. The rest was ok.

455072,A3L2HATRKKXVHS,6305229198,"Scotty M. ""Little Nose""","[0, 0]","Survivor Series '98 brought back the 16 man WWE championship tournament to crown a new WWE champion. The tournament had it highs and it definitely had it lows. McMahon would start off the show to announce there will be a new WWE champion and he also introduces Mankind's mystery opponent which many of the fans where chanting HBK before hand.First Round Matches1. Mankind vs. Dwayne Gill (Gillberg)If this match had any good to it, then it would be where Gill got scared by his pyro which was some/what funny. Match ends under a minute. 0.5/52. Jeff Jarrett w/ Debra vs. Al SnowMuch better than the first match. The King was all for Tennessee in this one. The match had some good reversals and some nice moves. Debra would try to interfere but it would only back fire on Jarrett's part. It had a nice shot with ""head"" towards the end. Pretty average match. 2.5/53. Big Bossman vs. Stone Cold Steve AustinThe match started out with a brawl on the outside before it would move into the ring. Bossman would hit a low blow on Austin but the ref ignored it. There was some good shots but it would end in a dq so Austin would sell his injury throughout the night. 3/54. William Regal vs. X-PacA pretty refreshing match to say the least. The match was very good especially after the poor matches that was placed infront of them. Regal & X-Pac took some hard bumps in this one. Regal would soon apply some holds on X-Pac to wear him down. X-Pac took a lot of punishment on his neck and even takes a hard suplex from the top rope. It was a disappointment when it became a double count-out but this could have been the match of the first round. Pretty good match. 4/55. Ken Shamrock vs. GoldustThis was a pretty good match up as well. Some nice moveneuvers and some reversals. Some nice slams. Shamrock pulled off a nice hurricanrana off the top rope onto Goldust. Good match. 3.5/56. The Rock vs. BossmanIt was originally suppose to be Triple H but he was still out from his knee injury, so Bossman would be the replacement. It ended in about 6 or 7 seconds after the Rock got a quick roll up on Bossman after he entered the ring. Very short match to say the least but I liked it though, I felt it was a good move. 1/5Quarter Finals7. Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer vs. KaneIt was cool to see Kane being the face and Taker being the heel this time around. Some good brawling and some nice shots were taken in the beginning of the match. It had some good action to take place on the outside. Taker would work on Kane's leg to try and beat him down. It had some nice power moves and some nice brawling throughout the match. Not as good as their wrestlemania meeting but you can't help that with this being a tournament match. Nice way to start off the quarter finals. 4/58. Al Snow vs. MankindI don't have no idea how Foley can wrestle a pretty decent match up while wearing a tux but he did it. The match had some good action on the outside and a chair would even get introduced. It had some nice hard shots. One funny stupid part of the match was when Foley found socko around ""head"" and then he would stomp on the head. Pretty nice contest with a good amount of time. 3.5/59. Ken Shamrock vs. The RockI felt this was the best match these two had that year. They had a nice brawl on the outside and some good wrestling in the ring. They pull off some nice counters and some good moves. Bossman would interfere but once again it would only backfire. Good match, much better than their other encounters. 4/510. Women's ChampionshipSable vs. Jacqueline w/ Marc MeroJackie would get a cheap shot on Sable in the early going. Sable would get the advantage and hit the TKO on Jackie. Mero would interefere but would get powerbombed on the outside by Sable. It had some good counters. Sable hit her sablebomb on Jackie to regain the title. Impressive women's title match. 3.5/5Semi-Finals11. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. MankindStone Cold would just come to the ring and just beat on Foley and then just rip his clothes off. He would even hit Foley with his very own shoe. It was a little funny to see foley wrestle in his socks. McMahon and the stooges would come to ringside. Another funny part was when Foley countered the stunner and then ran from the ring. Austin took a hard slam onto the concrete floor. It got physical on the outside for a while. It became a better of a match once it got back into the ring.  A chair would also come into play in this match as well. It had a shocking ending but it all worked well in the end. 3.5/512. The Rock vs. Undertaker w/ Paul BearerThe match started out with a pretty good brawl and soon went to the outside where some more brawling took place. They had a pretty good wrestling match and a nice slugfest as well. Kane would come out and get Taker dqed after chokeslamming the rock. Taker and Kane would then just go and fight all out into the crowd. 4/513. WWE Tag Team ChampionshipNew Age Outlaws vs. Headbangers vs. D Lo Brown & Mark HenryThis match was interesting, cause one member from each team was in the match at the same time. The headbangers seem liked the odd man team where they would try to get the quick pin after the other teams did their dirty work. There was a lot of double team moves apllyed to the outlaws. The match had a few high risk and some nice shots. The Road dogg really gets isolated in this one. It had a pretty good ending. Good match to set up the finals. 3.5/514. Finals for the WWE ChampionshipThe Rock vs. MankindFoley and Rock always had some pretty good matches together and this was no exception. This match also had its share of having some good action to take place on the outside. Foley uses some nice wrestling holds to wear down the Rock. The McMahons would soon come out and stand ringside. Foley & Rock took some hard slams and hard shots on the outside. Foley even crashes through the announce table at one point in the match. This match was defiantly the match of the night, but of course this match is known as the second Survivor Series screw job. Nice way to end the show. 4.5/5After the match, McMahon would address the fans and tell them how the people screwed the people. McMahon would also make reference to Foley and Austin. Austin would soon return and get revenge on Foley and the Rock for what happened earlier in the show.This wasn't the best Survivor Series but if yall like tournaments and if yall can find this somewhere for like 5 bucks or under then I recommend on getting it but it aint really all that special. You can get the final match on the Rock's 3 disc dvd as well.",3,Nice to see a title tournament again but not all that nice,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,6566,"['Survivor', 'Series', ""'98"",
