I have read the books and researched these two freedom fighters on the Internet for many years.THIS MOVIE IS 99% ACCURATE.They were NOT murderers, or ""poor victims of society"". They were merely seeking vengence and JUSTICE. They bravely continued the South's Great War for Freedom.Pinkerton (the bad guy) WAS an @$$hole, as depicted in old manuscripts and letters.The acting, storyline, plot, and everything are perfect. It starts with our heroes, after being released and swearing an oath to the loyalty of the yankees (United States), minding their own business and working on their farm.Suddenly they (including their family) were terrorized by a villian represented by the Railroad of Chicago, Ill. Father was shot dead, brother (Frank James) wounded, and home torched.These two gentlemen (Frank and Jesse) decide to start a gang and rob banks and railroads. As shown in the train scene, the gang ""never takes money from the working man"".I won't give any more away but to just leave on a good note. This is a must-see for fans of the Old West.

He articulates memorable melodies and is able to subtly weave ethnicity when required.The film portrays the brothers within a duality of compassion and ferocity. As such, McKenzie brings the tender with the triumphant. In the former, with cues such as 'Main Title' and 'Marauding' the heroics are conveyed through full string and brass orchestras (actually this is a small orchestra that has been overlayed). In the latter, its a flute or guitar that offers the tender - if not the tragic.

It takes a different approach to the legends based on the true life of the two brothers. In this version Jesse is a hothead, somewhat immature. His older brother Frank tries to keep him in line, including frequently stopping him from killing people. The behavior of carpetbaggers and Jesse's reaction to it, especially the killing of his relative starts the crime wave. Pinkerton goes after the brothers making it his life goal.

380823,A22MG5N2AY9HB8,6303591922,Louise,"[1, 1]","This was a very enjoyable movie. Bill Paxton, Rob Lowe and Randy Travis were great in the film. This movie was true to the basic history with the exception of some legend and myth being thrown into the film. There was no shaking of hands on the train robberies as potrayed in the film. The Northfield Bank Robbery was not followed according to history. The Robbers of the Northfield Bank Robbery were,Jesse James,Frank James,Cole Younger,Bob Younger,Clell Miller,Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell and possibly Jim Cummins.  Only $26.70 was stolen. The James brothers were the only ones to escape death or capture. The life of Frank and Jesse were followed. Jesse did marry his cousin Zerelda called Zee.  Frank was tried for only two robberies/murders-one in Missouri and another in Huntsville Alabama. He was aquitted for Missouri and Alabama. Frank surrendered in Jefferson City in 1882. He quoted 'I have been hunted for twenty-one years,have literally lived in the saddle,have never known a day of perfect peace. It was one long,anxious,inexorable,eternal vigil&#34;. Then he said 'Governor, I havn't let another man touch my gun since 1861', end quote. After the aquittal Frank returned to the James Farm. He died there Feb 18,1915 age 72.He left behind a wife Annie Raltson James and a son. As I said this is history entertwined with myth about the gang and the raids. The James boys were out for revenge against the Union Government and for the atrocities done to the South by the Union after the war. No amount of killing is justified however the way I see it. These gangs, Billy The Kid included were out to make a name for themselves. It is hard to dispute fact from myth in a western because these people were considered heroes but the James and Younger Gangs did not give their booty that they took to the masses. They kept it for themselves. They were not chivilaric. Pinkerton was a jerk to say the least and was hell bent on capturing Jesse. Compared to other films it was the closest thing that you will get to the truth but I would still rather see a documentary. All in all it was full of action well acted and you get some of the history but this is not a documentary but a film for entertainment.",4,Frank and Jesse Outlaws of the West!,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,2211,"['was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'were', 'great', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'basic', 'history', 'exception', 'legend', 'myth', 'being', 'thrown', 'film', 'was', 'shaking', 'hands', 'train', 'robberies', 'potrayed', 'film', 'Northfield', 'Bank', 'Robbery', 'was', 'not', 'followed', 'according', 'history', 'Robbers', 'Northfield', 'Bank', 'Robbery', 'were', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Frank', 'James', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'Bob', 'Younger', 'Clell', 'Miller', 'Charlie', 'Pitts', 'Bill', 'Chadwell', 'possibly', 'Jim', 'Cummins', 'Only', '26.70', 'was', 'stolen', 'James', 'brothers', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'escape', 'death', 'capture', 'life', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'were', 'followed', 'Jesse', 'did', 'marry', 'cousin', 'Zerelda', 'called', 'Zee', 'Frank', 'was', 'tried', 'only', 'two', 'robberies/murders-one', 'Missouri', 'Huntsville', 'Alabama', 'was', 'aquitted', 'Missouri', 'Alabama', 'Frank', 'surrendered', 'Jefferson', 'City', '1882', 'quoted', 'have', 'been', 'hunted', 'twenty-one', 'years', 'have', 'literally', 'lived', 'saddle', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'day', 'perfect', 'peace', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'anxious', 'inexorable', 'eternal', 'vigil', '34', 'Then', 'said', 'hav', ""n't"", 'let', 'man', 'touch', 'gun', '1861', 'end', 'quote', 'aquittal', 'Frank', 'returned', 'James', 'Farm', 'died', 'Feb', '18,1915', 'age', '72.He', 'left', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Raltson', 'James', 'son', 'said', 'history', 'entertwined', 'myth', 'gang', 'raids', 'James', 'boys', 'were', 'out', 'revenge', 'Union', 'Government', 'atrocities', 'done', 'South', 'Union', 'war', 'amount', 'killing', 'justified', 'however', 'way', 'see', 'gangs', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'included', 'were', 'out', 'make', 'name', 'hard', 'dispute', 'fact', 'myth', 'western', 'people', 'were', 'considered', 'heroes', 'James', 'Younger', 'Gangs', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'booty', 'took', 'masses', 'kept', 'were', 'not', 'chivilaric', 'Pinkerton', 'was', 'jerk', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'hell', 'bent', 'capturing', 'Jesse', 'Compared', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'closest', 'thing', 'will', 'get', 'truth', 'would', 'still', 'rather', 'see', 'documentary', 'was', 'full', 'action', 'well', 'acted', 'get', 'history', 'not', 'documentary', 'film', 'entertainment']",Frank & Jesse VHS
380824,AK61LQI92GTCH,6303591922,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[8, 14]","The Civil War ends and Frank and Jesse James have long since mustered out of Quantrill's band of Yankee-hating raiders.  The brothers try to return to the ranch but are forced by circumstances - circumstances in large part created by carpetbagging politicians, greedy railroad men, and eastern bankers - to return to a life of crime.  One particularly ghoulish looking railroad land buyer is rebuffed - Get off'n my land - only to come back a-gunnin' and a-bombin'.  A James or two is killed and the brothers find themselves yet again in the position of guerilla warriors against the United States government.  Or, to put it less sympathetically than 1994's FRANK AND JESSE does, robbing banks and trains is a whole lot easier, and more fun, way to make a living than busting sod.FRANK AND JESSE isn't any more concerned with historical accuracy than most movies. It casts a sympathetic eye at its title characters, treating them as modern day Robin Hoods, ennobling their post-Civil War careers.  I have fewer problems with distorted history than with bad scripts and weak stories.  The boys are ennobled to the same degree the bad guys are debased and whoever was responsible for this script laid `bad' on with a thick trowel.  Bankers are venal and corrupt.  Railroad men are rapacious and corrupt.  The US Army is the corrupt lackey arm of the carpetbaggers.  Even William Atherton, who plays detective and arch-James' nemesis Allan Pinkerton, emerges as a character a shade or so shy of two dimensions.Anyway, the bad guys can't shoot straight (it really does take ten Yankees to kill a Reb!), they'll kick a poor widder women off'n her land less'n she pays an exorbitant mortgage demanded by the Eastern Banker, and The People hate them.  In one of many awkward scenes, the James and the Younger boys discuss reuniting the Gang.  Someone reminds the group ""we've got to keep the heart of the people.""  It sounded forced and phony - a line more appropriate to a bad ad campaign or a bad movie about a bad war than a bad western.  Detective Pinkerton will be surrounded by the James' Gang on more than one occasion, with Yank troopers falling like ten-pins to the right and to the left of him, and escapes without a scratch!FRANK AND JESSE wore me down long before they arrived at Northfield and committed the famous bank robbery.  I wasn't ready for the ludicrous ending.  If you're familiar with Jesse James' life story I'll give you a couple of hints.  Jesse knows the Ford brothers' visit is more than a social call.  Before Jesse adjusts the crooked picture he looks in on his son, who is in bed asking his mother ""We don't have to move again, do we, Mommy?""  Jesse's (Rob Lowe) reaction shot is in soft focus.  If anything, FRANK AND JESSE will demonstrate the lengths some responsible parents used to go to to keep Junior in the same school.There were some bright points.  As usual, Bill Paxton as Frank James gives a subtle and nuanced performance.  Randy Travis (Cole Younger) warbles a pleasant Auld Lang Syne around a campfire.My favorite scene will probably pass by anyone who hasn't seen Walter Hill's THE LONG RIDERS, another story about the Jamess and the Youngers and another that devotes a fair amount of time to the Northfield bank robbery.THE LONG RIDERS combines slow-motion photography, daring stunts and skillful editing to make of the robbery a memorably exciting scene. For instance, a galloping horse is shown exploding through a plate glass window.  Okay - real glass from a real plate glass window would have cut the horse to ribbons, and the movie horse galloped off into the Minnesota wilderness unnicked, but it was visually exciting.  Almost exactly the same situation develops in FRANK AND JESSE.  In Northfield a thundering horse gallops through an empty building.  Floorboards clatter, the rampaging steed leaps and - doink.  The resistable horse is thrown back by the immovable object - aka the malfunctioning prop.  The heavy window, attached by a top hinge, yawns out about four inches.  The stunned beast repurchases his traction, carefully noses the window and sort of squeezes out over the sill.FRANK AND JESSE squeezes out over the screen and clocks in at a bit over an hour and a half.  If you absolutely have to see every movie dealing with the James' Gang get it.",2,Frank and Jesse,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,4311,"['Civil', 'War', 'ends', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'James', 'have', 'long', 'mustered', 'Quantrill', 'band', 'Yankee-hating', 'raiders', 'brothers', 'try', 'return', 'ranch', 'are', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'circumstances', 'large', 'part', 'created', 'carpetbagging', 'politicians', 'greedy', 'railroad', 'men', 'eastern', 'bankers', 'return', 'life', 'crime', 'One', 'particularly', 'ghoulish', 'looking', 'railroad', 'land', 'buyer', 'rebuffed', 'Get', 'off', 'n', 'land', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'a-gunnin', 'a-bombin', 'James', 'two', 'killed', 'brothers', 'find', 'yet', 'again', 'position', 'guerilla', 'warriors', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'put', 'less', 'sympathetically', '1994', 'FRANK', 'JESSE', 'robbing', 'banks', 'trains', 'whole', 'lot', 'easier', 'more', 'fun', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'busting', 'sod.FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', ""n't"", 'more', 'concerned', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'most', 'movies', 'sympathetic', 'eye', 'title', 'characters', 'treating', 'modern', 'day', 'Robin', 'Hoods', 'ennobling', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'careers', 'have', 'fewer', 'problems', 'distorted', 'history', 'bad', 'scripts', 'weak', 'stories', 'boys', 'are', 'ennobled', 'same', 'degree', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'debased', 'was', 'responsible', 'script', 'laid', 'bad', 'thick', 'trowel', 'Bankers', 'are', 'venal', 'corrupt', 'Railroad', 'men', 'are', 'rapacious', 'corrupt', 'US', 'Army', 'corrupt', 'lackey', 'arm', 'carpetbaggers', 'Even', 'William', 'Atherton', 'who', 'detective', 'arch-James', 'nemesis', 'Allan', 'Pinkerton', 'character', 'shade', 'so', 'shy', 'two', 'dimensions.Anyway', 'bad', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'really', 'take', 'ten', 'Yankees', 'kill', 'Reb', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'poor', 'widder', 'women', 'land', 'less', 'n', 'exorbitant', 'mortgage', 'demanded', 'Eastern', 'Banker', 'People', 'hate', 'one', 'many', 'awkward', 'scenes', 'James', 'Younger', 'discuss', 'reuniting', 'Gang', 'Someone', 'group', ""'ve"", 'got', 'keep', 'heart', 'people', 'sounded', 'forced', 'phony', 'line', 'more', 'appropriate', 'bad', 'ad', 'campaign', 'bad', 'movie', 'bad', 'war', 'bad', 'western', 'Detective', 'Pinkerton', 'will', 'be', 'surrounded', 'James', 'Gang', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Yank', 'troopers', 'falling', 'ten-pins', 'right', 'left', 'scratch', 'FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', 'down', 'long', 'arrived', 'Northfield', 'committed', 'famous', 'bank', 'robbery', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'ludicrous', 'ending', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Jesse', 'James', 'life', 'story', ""'ll"", 'give', 'couple', 'hints', 'Jesse', 'Ford', 'brothers', 'visit', 'more', 'social', 'call', 'Jesse', 'crooked', 'picture', 'son', 'who', 'bed', 'asking', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'move', 'again', 'do', 'Mommy', 'Jesse', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'reaction', 'shot', 'soft', 'focus', 'anything', 'FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'lengths', 'responsible', 'parents', 'used', 'go', 'keep', 'Junior', 'same', 'school.There', 'were', 'bright', 'points', 'usual', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Frank', 'James', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'pleasant', 'Auld', 'Lang', 'Syne', 'campfire.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'will', 'probably', 'pass', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'THE', 'LONG', 'RIDERS', 'story', 'Jamess', 'Youngers', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'Northfield', 'bank', 'robbery.THE', 'LONG', 'RIDERS', 'slow-motion', 'photography', 'daring', 'stunts', 'skillful', 'editing', 'make', 'robbery', 'memorably', 'exciting', 'scene', 'instance', 'galloping', 'horse', 'shown', 'exploding', 'plate', 'glass', 'window', 'Okay', 'real', 'glass', 'real', 'plate', 'glass', 'window', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'horse', 'ribbons', 'movie', 'horse', 'galloped', 'off', 'Minnesota', 'wilderness', 'unnicked', 'was', 'visually', 'exciting', 'Almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'situation', 'FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', 'Northfield', 'thundering', 'horse', 'gallops', 'empty', 'building', 'Floorboards', 'clatter', 'rampaging', 'steed', 'leaps', 'doink', 'resistable', 'horse', 'thrown', 'back', 'immovable', 'object', 'malfunctioning', 'prop', 'heavy', 'window', 'attached', 'top', 'hinge', 'out', 'four', 'inches', 'stunned', 'beast', 'traction', 'carefully', 'window', 'sort', 'squeezes', 'out', 'sill.FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', 'out', 'screen', 'clocks', 'bit', 'hour', 'half', 'absolutely', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'dealing', 'James', 'Gang', 'get']",Frank & Jesse VHS
380825,A1ZOIGQHW7FPT2,6303591922,Thorvald,"[6, 11]","This is a pretty good movie...but it has absolutely nothing to do with Frank and Jesse James other than using their names.The movie stars Bill Paxton as Frank James and he does a wonderful job being the moody but sensible one. Rob Lowe as Jesse James is also excellent, playing him as the on-the-edge dangerous one who has a softer, human side. Randy Travis plays Cole Younger as a darkly cold killer. He's also the narrator of the movie. Such a good cast holds together the film.The story departs from reality right from the start and never does return to the real story of the James or Youngers. They do use a few real incidents but even those they twist around and change. If you can watch the film as pure fiction, it's not bad. Just bear in mind IT'S NOT HISTORY. An easy example is the Northfield, Minnesota robbery attempt. They do it in the film but, in this version, it's a pre-planned ambush by Allen Pinkerton who got the info from Charlie Ford (never minding that in reality the Fords joined up _after_ the Youngers were lost to the gang at Northfield). Even in the context of the movie it's a reach that Charlie Ford could know about Jesse James' plan as Charlie was in prison when the plan was made. Anyhow, they arrive in Northfield to an ambush. I counted at least 12 townspeople killed by the gang but not the bank clerk (reality--bank clerk murdered, one townsperson killed in the crossfire). Clell Miller and Fletch Taylor were killed (Fletch Taylor wasn't there). And as they're fleeing they have the scene where Jesse wants to kill the wounded Bob Younger...except in this movie Cole Younger does kill his brother! (Bob Younger really died in prison in 1889). One example out of a movie full of contorted non-history.If you can mentally divorce yourself from any sense of history and watch this as a totally fictional film about two guys who happen to be named Frank and Jesse James, it's pretty good. The guys are cute and ride around on horses shooting things and acting moody and tortured. Nice scenery and atmosphere but a few low budget trick slip through--like showing the guys romping over a hill in slow motion on their horses while a series of newspaper headlines update the story.",3,Good Movie/Bad History,988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,2211,"['pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'James', 'other', 'using', 'names.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Frank', 'James', 'wonderful', 'job', 'being', 'moody', 'sensible', 'one', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Jesse', 'James', 'also', 'excellent', 'playing', 'on-the-edge', 'dangerous', 'one', 'who', 'softer', 'human', 'side', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'darkly', 'cold', 'killer', 'also', 'narrator', 'movie', 'good', 'cast', 'together', 'film.The', 'story', 'departs', 'reality', 'right', 'start', 'never', 'return', 'real', 'story', 'James', 'Youngers', 'do', 'use', 'few', 'real', 'incidents', 'even', 'twist', 'change', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'pure', 'fiction', 'not', 'bad', 'Just', 'bear', 'mind', 'IT', 'NOT', 'HISTORY', 'easy', 'example', 'Northfield', 'Minnesota', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'do', 'film', 'version', 'pre-planned', 'ambush', 'Allen', 'Pinkerton', 'who', 'got', 'info', 'Charlie', 'Ford', 'never', 'minding', 'reality', 'Fords', 'joined', 'up', 'Youngers', 'were', 'lost', 'gang', 'Northfield', 'Even', 'context', 'movie', 'reach', 'Charlie', 'Ford', 'could', 'know', 'Jesse', 'James', 'plan', 'Charlie', 'was', 'prison', 'when', 'plan', 'was', 'made', 'Anyhow', 'arrive', 'Northfield', 'ambush', 'counted', 'least', '12', 'townspeople', 'killed', 'gang', 'not', 'bank', 'clerk', 'reality', 'bank', 'clerk', 'murdered', 'one', 'townsperson', 'killed', 'crossfire', 'Clell', 'Miller', 'Fletch', 'Taylor', 'were', 'killed', 'Fletch', 'Taylor', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', ""'re"", 'fleeing', 'have', 'scene', 'where', 'Jesse', 'kill', 'wounded', 'Bob', 'Younger', 'movie', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'kill', 'brother', 'Bob', 'Younger', 'really', 'died', 'prison', '1889', 'One', 'example', 'movie', 'full', 'contorted', 'non-history.If', 'can', 'mentally', 'divorce', 'sense', 'history', 'watch', 'totally', 'fictional', 'film', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'named', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'James', 'pretty', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'cute', 'ride', 'around', 'horses', 'shooting', 'things', 'acting', 'moody', 'tortured', 'Nice', 'scenery', 'atmosphere', 'few', 'low', 'budget', 'trick', 'slip', 'showing', 'guys', 'romping', 'hill', 'slow', 'motion', 'horses', 'series', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'update', 'story']",Frank & Jesse VHS

Some have been historically accurate, but extremely boring and others have totally ignored history, but are extremely good movies to watch. FRANK AND JESSE falls somewhere in the middle.The movie is really enjoyable to watch. It ignores much of the James' early years and instead focuses on their days as a gang after the Civil War. There are a few historical facts that are presented correctly in the film, but there are a lot more that are totally ignored or changed. Instead, the film is based more upon the legend of the James and Younger gang.There is no doubt that Jesse James and company were bankrobbers who had a ruthless streak to them. Nevertheless, a person cannot deny the fact either that to many people in Missouri and other rural areas in the country, the James and Younger gang were heroes, Robin Hoods of the American West. Pinkerton asserted as much time and time again in his attempts to catch and round up the gang. Having been raised in a rural area not too far from the state of Missouri, I understand why people believed and still believe that in some ways the gang were heroes. In fact, I am inclined to agree. Therefore, this &quot;romanticizing&quot; of the Jesse James' legend isn't anything new. It's just the other side of the same coin and usually makes for a better story.",4,Fact Versus Legend.,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,1386,"['have', 'been', 'dozen', 'movies', 'based', 'life', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'James', 'have', 'been', 'historically', 'accurate', 'extremely', 'boring', 'others', 'have', 'totally', 'ignored', 'history', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'movies', 'watch', 'FRANK', 'AND', 'JESSE', 'somewhere', 'middle.The', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'much', 'James', 'early', 'years', 'instead', 'focuses', 'days', 'gang', 'Civil', 'War', 'are', 'few', 'historical', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'correctly', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'are', 'totally', 'ignored', 'changed', 'Instead', 'film', 'based', 'more', 'legend', 'James', 'Younger', 'doubt', 'Jesse', 'James', 'company', 'were', 'bankrobbers', 'who', 'had', 'ruthless', 'streak', 'Nevertheless', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'Missouri', 'other', 'rural', 'areas', 'country', 'James', 'Younger', 'gang', 'were', 'heroes', 'Robin', 'Hoods', 'American', 'West', 'Pinkerton', 'asserted', 'much', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'attempts', 'catch', 'round', 'up', 'gang', 'Having', 'been', 'raised', 'rural', 'area', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'state', 'Missouri', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'believed', 'still', 'believe', 'ways', 'gang', 'were', 'heroes', 'fact', 'am', 'inclined', 'agree', 'Therefore', 'quot', 'romanticizing', 'quot', 'Jesse', 'James', 'legend', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'just', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'coin', 'usually', 'better', 'story']",Frank & Jesse VHS
