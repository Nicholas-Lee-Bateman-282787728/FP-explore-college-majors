Williams ""Nunah""","[10, 12]","States of Grace is a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly.It is exactly the film my family needed to see at the time that we saw it. An utterly believable, perfectly directed and wonderfully acted inspirational film about sin, repentance, loss, faith and redemption.Being LDS, especially a returned missionary, may help one to get all of the nuance, but I believe that this is a film that should be uplifting to anyone who doesn't just absolutely hate Mormons.My favorite line from the movie... You don't have to die for your sins... someone already did that for you"".Finally this is a great Christmas tale... but you don't get that until the end.If you are in the mood for an inspirational tale, this is a movie for you!

1026732,A32FJQQYGIGTVS,B000JJ4W6A,H. Robertson,"[1, 3]","Why do Mormons hate this film? Because it shows the ugly secret they don't want the world to know and that is their missionaries are not perfect. One missionary in this film does the most unforgivable thing and that is have sex while on a mission. Most members would have you believe, and to be honest, want to believe these things never happen. But they have and they do. The problem is that these guys are human too. Some mess up, it just a fact of life. What is interesting is how Dutcher went outside what would be the normal LDS reaction and decided to show how wonderful grace in these situations can be. But understand while a lot of grace is shown in this film(because I believe it is how Dutcher would like to see Mormonism change to this direction) in real life this kid would have been treated like dirt and even kicked out of the LDS church. I know because my brother was. You can tell Dutcher was exploring his beliefs here concerning grace and forgiveness as shortly after release he left the LDS church. The members left him also hating this film with a passion(just read some of the reviews from LDS members here). As far as I'm concerned the LDS church was the biggest loser this time. They lost one of the very few intelligent filmmakers they had. To Mainstream Christians(of which I count myself among that number) give it a try if for no other reason then to see a Mormon explore how powerful the grace of Jesus really is. To those wondering how I may know so much about Mormonism, I was born and raised in the LDS church and left at the age of 33 when I became Born Again.",5,A Mormon film most Mormons hate.,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,1593,"['Why', 'do', 'Mormons', 'hate', 'film', 'ugly', 'secret', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'world', 'know', 'missionaries', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'One', 'missionary', 'film', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'thing', 'have', 'sex', 'mission', 'Most', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'be', 'honest', 'want', 'believe', 'things', 'never', 'happen', 'have', 'do', 'problem', 'guys', 'are', 'human', 'too', 'mess', 'up', 'just', 'fact', 'life', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'Dutcher', 'went', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'normal', 'LDS', 'reaction', 'decided', 'show', 'how', 'wonderful', 'grace', 'situations', 'can', 'be', 'understand', 'lot', 'grace', 'shown', 'film', 'believe', 'how', 'Dutcher', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Mormonism', 'change', 'direction', 'real', 'life', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'dirt', 'even', 'kicked', 'LDS', 'church', 'know', 'brother', 'was', 'can', 'tell', 'Dutcher', 'was', 'exploring', 'beliefs', 'here', 'concerning', 'grace', 'forgiveness', 'shortly', 'release', 'left', 'LDS', 'church', 'members', 'left', 'also', 'hating', 'film', 'passion', 'just', 'read', 'reviews', 'LDS', 'members', 'here', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'LDS', 'church', 'was', 'biggest', 'loser', 'time', 'lost', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'intelligent', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'Mainstream', 'Christians', 'count', 'number', 'give', 'try', 'other', 'reason', 'then', 'see', 'Mormon', 'how', 'powerful', 'grace', 'Jesus', 'really', 'wondering', 'how', 'may', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'Mormonism', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'LDS', 'church', 'left', 'age', '33', 'when', 'became', 'Born', 'Again']",States of Grace
1026733,AVB7IN1VP08RE,B000JJ4W6A,"JSR700 ""JSR""","[1, 61]","The cover of the DVD says that it is a contemporary ""Christian"" drama. First, this is no Christian drama because a Christian drama focuses on Jesus Christ and not on Mormon missionaries. It is definitely Mormon propaganda because it starts off by having one of the main characters explain that present day Mormons do not practice polygamy anymore. The Mormon faith sanctioned the practice in the past. In fact, Joseph Smith - the so called ""Mormon phrophet"" and LDS founder had several wives. It also shows the main character flashing ""The Book of Mormon."" He says, ""its like the Bible."" Many biblical scholars would disagree to that claim. The Book of Mormon teaches that the Mormon God (Elohim) was once man - a created being and has several goddess wives. In contrast, the Judeo-Christian God ""Jehovah"" or ""Yahweh"" was the beginning and has no creator. He doesn't have any wives. Second, anything that glorifies the good works of man as oppose to salvation through Christ alone is not from Christ. Although, the film has some truths in it, e.g. salvation through Christ, I would not hinge my faith on mixed messages as a previous review said. God does not send out mixed signals. His word in the Bible is clear. Isaiah says that ""all our righteous acts are like filthy rags."" A real Christian drama would NEVER feature bikini clad women and have men oggling them even if they call themselves ""missionaries."" The Bible says that ""Any man who looks at a woman lustfully, has committed adultery in his heart."" Moreover, the book of Mormon teaches that Jesus Christ and Satan are brothers - both of whom are sons of Elohim; that all Mormons will become like God; that Jesus married Mary, Martha and Mary Magdalene (polygamy) and; that Elohim had sex with Mary to conceive Jesus; and that Joseph Smith was the direct descendant of Jesus from one of his marriages. I don't think any Christian faith would espouse these principles. Most importantly, the clear evidence of the Holy Bible's power is in its power to change lives. I've seen drug addicts, homosexuals, criminals, really evil people turn to Christ and leave their lifestyles behind. They come out changed people after hearing Biblical truth. I have a lot of LDS friends. I consider them good people. A lot of them are upper class, white and privileged people. Very different from the drug addicts, etc. I have met. They look prestine from the outside. But, I have yet to see a real change in their lives after reading the Book of Mormon. I can see that the emphasis is good works - the outside. Not what Jesus really looks at - the heart. If you want a genuine Christian drama you'd be better off watching ""The Passion of the Christ,"" ""End of the Spear"" or ""Facing the Giants."" These films give glory to the one who deserves all the glory - JESUS CHRIST, not the ""good works"" of Joseph Smith or 2 dorks on white shirts with black nameplates who do not know what they are talking about.",1,Mormon Propaganda,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2943,"['cover', 'DVD', 'contemporary', 'Christian', 'drama', 'First', 'Christian', 'drama', 'Christian', 'drama', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'not', 'Mormon', 'missionaries', 'definitely', 'Mormon', 'propaganda', 'having', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'explain', 'present', 'day', 'Mormons', 'do', 'not', 'practice', 'polygamy', 'anymore', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'sanctioned', 'practice', 'past', 'fact', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'so', 'called', 'Mormon', 'phrophet', 'LDS', 'founder', 'had', 'several', 'wives', 'also', 'main', 'character', 'flashing', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'Bible', 'Many', 'biblical', 'scholars', 'would', 'disagree', 'claim', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'teaches', 'Mormon', 'God', 'Elohim', 'was', 'once', 'man', 'created', 'being', 'several', 'goddess', 'wives', 'contrast', 'Judeo-Christian', 'God', 'Jehovah', 'Yahweh', 'was', 'beginning', 'creator', ""n't"", 'have', 'wives', 'Second', 'anything', 'good', 'works', 'man', 'oppose', 'salvation', 'Christ', 'alone', 'not', 'Christ', 'film', 'truths', 'e.g', 'salvation', 'Christ', 'would', 'not', 'hinge', 'faith', 'mixed', 'messages', 'previous', 'review', 'said', 'God', 'not', 'send', 'out', 'mixed', 'signals', 'word', 'Bible', 'clear', 'Isaiah', 'righteous', 'acts', 'are', 'filthy', 'rags', 'real', 'Christian', 'drama', 'would', 'NEVER', 'feature', 'bikini', 'clad', 'women', 'have', 'men', 'oggling', 'even', 'call', 'missionaries', 'Bible', 'Any', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'lustfully', 'committed', 'adultery', 'heart', 'Moreover', 'book', 'Mormon', 'teaches', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Satan', 'are', 'brothers', 'whom', 'are', 'sons', 'Elohim', 'Mormons', 'will', 'become', 'God', 'Jesus', 'married', 'Mary', 'Martha', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'polygamy', 'Elohim', 'had', 'sex', 'Mary', 'conceive', 'Jesus', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'was', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Jesus', 'one', 'marriages', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Christian', 'faith', 'would', 'espouse', 'principles', 'Most', 'importantly', 'clear', 'evidence', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'power', 'power', 'change', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'drug', 'addicts', 'homosexuals', 'criminals', 'really', 'evil', 'people', 'turn', 'Christ', 'leave', 'lifestyles', 'come', 'out', 'changed', 'people', 'hearing', 'Biblical', 'truth', 'have', 'lot', 'LDS', 'friends', 'consider', 'good', 'people', 'lot', 'are', 'upper', 'class', 'white', 'privileged', 'people', 'Very', 'different', 'drug', 'addicts', 'etc', 'have', 'met', 'look', 'prestine', 'outside', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'real', 'change', 'lives', 'reading', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'can', 'see', 'emphasis', 'good', 'works', 'outside', 'Not', 'what', 'Jesus', 'really', 'heart', 'want', 'genuine', 'Christian', 'drama', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'End', 'Spear', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'films', 'give', 'glory', 'one', 'who', 'glory', 'JESUS', 'CHRIST', 'not', 'good', 'works', 'Joseph', 'Smith', '2', 'dorks', 'white', 'shirts', 'black', 'nameplates', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking']",States of Grace
1026734,AX5EPK0DQP23Z,B000JJ4W6A,Paul Wake,"[18, 31]","This is mostly a very good movie that deals meaningfully with redemption and the varying states of grace we find ourselves in, and with the need to help each other more than judge each other.  It follows two LDS missionaries and the people they meet, as they struggle with life and with their pasts, and as they try to build better futures.  It isn't a religious tract as one reviewer seems to demand (perhaps he can find himself a black and white filmstrip somewhere in a church library).Up until the end, I was liking this movie considerably, although the truly bizarre mixed messages at the end put the kibosh on that.  Then my wife pointed out that I should have been concerned earlier on by another glaring flaw.  Here are the two problems.  [SPOILERS APPROACHING]  First, one missionary fornicates with a woman living in the apartment next door.  In the broader American culture, that would be no big deal at all.  In LDS missionary culture, where standards are very strict and clear, it is an extremely grave sin.  It means the end of the mission, and automatic excommunication from the church.  The personal results are devastating.  But at the end of the movie the missionary and woman are having a Kumbaya moment by a nativity scene, with the mission president, missionary's mother, and fellow missionaries present.  That would never, ever happen in real life.  It's unthinkable, and it's offensive to most Mormons to even imagine that someone having done that would be holding their dearie as they blithely stare off into the sunset with the people the missionary has betrayed and dishonored all around him.  Why Dutcher would put it in beggars the imagination.  If the point is that we should be instantly forgiving of anything, without a repentance process, then he's so for off the doctrinal mark for his target audience that he's going to leave them wondering if he has a pinwheel for a moral compass.  I myself will take the last scene of Brigham City over this, any day.  Second (but earlier in the film), a gang banger turns his life around and leaves the hood behind, but then his little brother gets himself killed while trying to be a gangsta.  Big brother rounds up his violent homies, riles them up, and they go hunting the killers.  Just as big brother is about to take revenge, he realizes he's better than that, and walks away.  Whereupon his friend goes ahead and kills the killer.  Then big brother goes to a baptism and everyone in his new circle is happy; what just happened is apparently not worth a second thought.  As my wife pointed out, that's just wrong.  Where's the accountability for what he just did?  Legally, it's felony murder at best (if not out and out murder under an accomplice liability theory).  You don't get to be involved in a felony during which someone is killed, and not be liable for murder.  The more I think about it, that whole part of the movie is wierd.  I don't like thinking about what Dutcher's point is here; it seems a lot closer to Babylon than Zion, more like the standardless and all accepting mindlessness of modern pop culture/liberalism/Godless theology than the beliefs most viewers hold dear.Could have been a great movie, especially with Dutcher making it.  Should have been a great movie, especially in comparison to the drivel coming out of Halestorm's LDS-oriented ""comedy"" factory.  Wasn't a great movie.",3,An Abomination.
