In this episode the Federal Government or the IRS is suing an Income tax internet company for allowing illegal aliens to submit fraudulent returns. CBS must be hand fed directly from the Federal Government on this episode simply because it isn't the internet companies responsibility to determine if the income tax refund is illegal or not. It is the responsibility of the IRS's though. And to use the Defense of Marriage ACT that prohibits same sex marriage to carry this issue to the voters should outrage the viewers even more. This broadcaster is trying to link two distinctly different subjects and trying to say the issue the voters should be angry at the federal government for is a less of an issue because it's really a private companies fault in their opinion. Then it turns around and tries to paint the federal government as the underdog for gay rights which is an issue but not one that causes the tax payers of America billions of dollars in income tax refunds. The IRS specific responsibility is to collect taxes and make sure that non paying taxpayers are paying their taxes and to weed out fraud. However, to this day they have not been reimbursed for any of these fraudulent refunds because of the identity theft that has taken place. TIN numbers have been issued to people who don't actually live in this country that have never worked in this country and who are not dependents of the said fraudulent tax filer. And the only people who issue TIN numbers are the IRS.

It's for everyone. Well, there are some scenes that I would keep from children, but for the most part, the character development of this show surpasses pretty much everything else I've seen on television.Also, they keep the characters. There's not a lot of switching to try to get used to new main characters. They weave personal stories with courtroom drama. Some very funny parts in the courtroom occur. I'm not giving anything away by saying this, but for those who have seen it, think, &#34;is that your opinion?&#34; Hahaha!At first I did not care for one of the characters at all. The campaign manager of the husband. However, after a couple episodes with him in the show, he grew on me like mold does on cheese. Sometimes an unbearable character and at other times, flat out hilarious with his facial expressions. I dare say that if I could meet anyone on the show in real life, it would be him.Looking forward to Season 5.

1583252,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00915G6R6,kacunnin,"[37, 48]","I love THE GOOD WIFE.  Season One is one of the best seasons of television, period.  And the best thing about this show has always been the relationship between Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi).  Unfortunately, two decisions made by the writers have irreparably damaged this relationship, and consequently the series.  First, at the end of Season Two the writers decided to reveal that Kalinda slept with Alicia's husband during her stint at the State's Attorney's office two years before the show began.  This undermined the friendship that had grown between these two very different women.  And second, in Season Four, they brought in new character Nick (Marc Warren), Kalinda's long-lost abusive husband.  This guy shows up in the first episode of Season Four as a thug with a criminal record attempting to use Lockhart Gardner to help him get a towing contract from the State.  But his real motive is to move in on Kalinda again and get his hands on some money he believes she stole from him.The problem here is that Kalinda has always been portrayed as a strong and self-sufficient woman.  Yes, she was ""mysterious,"" and it was obvious from the start that she had secrets she was hiding, but it seems totally against character to portray her locked in a love-hate battle with an abusive lunatic.  While things are left a bit murky as to what Kalinda's relationship with Nick really is, they are shown punching each other, going full-on martial arts with each other, pulling guns on each other, and having what can only be called sadomasochistic sex with each other.  In fact, their first ""sex scene"" looks very much like rape, although it is left up in the air as to whether or not Kalinda was into the whole rape scenario.This storyline permeates the first half of Season Four, and the first ten episodes are undeniably marred by its presence.  By mid-season, however, the writers seemed to get it (fans were not happy), and Nick was abruptly written out (although his story was left open-ended).I didn't really begin enjoying Season Four until episode 11 (""Boom De Yah Da""), which is the first without Nick's appearance.  There's also a great scene in that episode between Alicia and Kalinda that recalls their relationship in the first two seasons.  Julianna Margulies has said that she herself could never forgive a friend who had done what Kalinda did (sleeping with Peter), and I think the writers have been influenced by her feelings about the storyline.  That's unfortunate, since I've missed the Alicia/Kalinda friendship and hope to see it get back on track in Season Five.There are some good characters in Season Four, including the return of Louis Canning (Michael J. Fox), Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston), and Mike Kresteva (Mathew Perry).  Notable new additions include Clarke Hayden (Nathan Lane), a trustee appointed to help Lockhart Gardner avoid bankruptcy, and Maddie Haywood (Maura Tierney), a wealthy woman who befriends Alicia and then becomes competition for Peter.  THE GOOD WIFE has always been adept at using guest stars to great advantage, and Season Four is no exception.Overall, if you're a fan of the series (and I most definitely am), you won't want to miss Season Four.  There's plenty of drama as Lockhart Gardner tries to survive an impending financial crisis, and Peter's run for the governorship is equally compelling. Just be aware of the weak first half.  I'm also disappointed in the writers' decision to continue with the on-again-off-again Alicia/Will romance.  While believable, a romantic relationship between these two characters makes Alicia seem weaker, and more vulnerable to the same kinds of things she dealt with in her marriage to Peter.  That said, the conflict in Alicia's mind between her very understandable sexual attraction to Will and her commitment to her husband and children is compelling.  The final moments of Season Four set up a scenario for Season Five that may or may not mean she has finally chosen one path over the other - but the writers leave it brilliantly inscrutable.  Will Alicia jump back into a passionate liaison with Will, or will she recommit to Peter and her family?  It's a delicious dilemma, and I, for one, can't wait!First half of Season Four:  2 starsSecond half of Season Four:  4 starsOverall:  3 stars",3,Weak first half mars otherwise strong season,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,4338,"['love', 'GOOD', 'WIFE', 'Season', 'One', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'television', 'period', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'relationship', 'Alicia', 'Florrick', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Kalinda', 'Sharma', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'decisions', 'made', 'writers', 'have', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'relationship', 'consequently', 'series', 'First', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'writers', 'decided', 'reveal', 'Kalinda', 'slept', 'Alicia', 'husband', 'stint', 'State', 'Attorney', 'office', 'two', 'years', 'show', 'began', 'undermined', 'friendship', 'had', 'grown', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'second', 'Season', 'Four', 'brought', 'new', 'character', 'Nick', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'Kalinda', 'long-lost', 'abusive', 'husband', 'guy', 'up', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Four', 'thug', 'criminal', 'record', 'attempting', 'use', 'Lockhart', 'Gardner', 'help', 'get', 'towing', 'contract', 'State', 'real', 'motive', 'move', 'Kalinda', 'again', 'get', 'hands', 'money', 'stole', 'him.The', 'problem', 'here', 'Kalinda', 'always', 'been', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'self-sufficient', 'woman', 'Yes', 'was', 'mysterious', 'was', 'obvious', 'start', 'had', 'secrets', 'was', 'hiding', 'totally', 'character', 'portray', 'locked', 'love-hate', 'battle', 'abusive', 'lunatic', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'bit', 'murky', 'what', 'Kalinda', 'relationship', 'Nick', 'really', 'are', 'shown', 'punching', 'other', 'going', 'full-on', 'martial', 'arts', 'other', 'pulling', 'guns', 'other', 'having', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'sadomasochistic', 'sex', 'other', 'fact', 'first', 'sex', 'scene', 'very', 'much', 'rape', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'not', 'Kalinda', 'was', 'whole', 'rape', 'scenario.This', 'storyline', 'first', 'half', 'Season', 'Four', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'are', 'undeniably', 'marred', 'presence', 'mid-season', 'however', 'writers', 'seemed', 'get', 'fans', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'Nick', 'was', 'abruptly', 'written', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'left', 'open-ended', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'begin', 'enjoying', 'Season', 'Four', 'episode', '11', 'Boom', 'De', 'Yah', 'Da', 'first', 'Nick', 'appearance', 'also', 'great', 'scene', 'episode', 'Alicia', 'Kalinda', 'relationship', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'said', 'could', 'never', 'forgive', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'what', 'Kalinda', 'did', 'sleeping', 'Peter', 'think', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'feelings', 'storyline', 'unfortunate', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Alicia/Kalinda', 'friendship', 'hope', 'see', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'Season', 'Five.There', 'are', 'good', 'characters', 'Season', 'Four', 'including', 'return', 'Louis', 'Canning', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Elsbeth', 'Tascioni', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Mike', 'Kresteva', 'Mathew', 'Perry', 'Notable', 'new', 'additions', 'include', 'Clarke', 'Hayden', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'trustee', 'appointed', 'help', 'Lockhart', 'Gardner', 'avoid', 'bankruptcy', 'Maddie', 'Haywood', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'who', 'Alicia', 'then', 'competition', 'Peter', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'WIFE', 'always', 'been', 'adept', 'using', 'guest', 'stars', 'great', 'advantage', 'Season', 'Four', 'exception.Overall', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'most', 'definitely', 'am', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Season', 'Four', 'plenty', 'drama', 'Lockhart', 'Gardner', 'survive', 'impending', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Peter', 'run', 'governorship', 'equally', 'compelling', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'weak', 'first', 'half', ""'m"", 'also', 'disappointed', 'writers', 'decision', 'continue', 'on-again-off-again', 'Alicia/Will', 'romance', 'believable', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'Alicia', 'seem', 'weaker', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'kinds', 'things', 'dealt', 'marriage', 'Peter', 'said', 'conflict', 'Alicia', 'mind', 'very', 'understandable', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'Will', 'commitment', 'husband', 'children', 'compelling', 'final', 'moments', 'Season', 'Four', 'set', 'up', 'scenario', 'Season', 'Five', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'mean', 'finally', 'chosen', 'one', 'path', 'other', 'writers', 'leave', 'brilliantly', 'inscrutable', 'Will', 'Alicia', 'jump', 'back', 'passionate', 'liaison', 'Will', 'will', 'recommit', 'Peter', 'family', 'delicious', 'dilemma', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'First', 'half', 'Season', 'Four', '2', 'starsSecond', 'half', 'Season', 'Four', '4', 'starsOverall', '3', 'stars']",The Good Wife: Season 4

Come on, writers, give us meat: tenderloin, not pig slop, not watered down half truths about successful ways to live life. We know what doesn't work. That's what we watch on TV. Now we want to see someone do life the right way. Will and Good Wife are aware of the consequences of their actions. They work together and are attracted to each other. So? Show us their other possibilities- not that they give in to their sexual attraction-but they find another solution/s. Maybe they do what we ask our children to do. They just say No! and get on with life. Surely the writers can be creative in a way that excludes the bedroom, drugs, tasteless language. Using interesting characters-develop them further. Using interesting law cases combined with funny characters-take them a step further. The writers have been so good so far, have done so many things right.

I waited impatiently for the fourth season to become available. Finally, $0.00! But I'm halfway through the series and it's such a letdown. The plot lines have strayed to relationships, while the bread-and-butter stories -- legal and courtroom battles -- are pushed to the side. I'm tired of skipping though the stuff I don't like (and even find repulsive).Here are the Top Ten things I dislike about the fourth season. If most of them don't change, I'm outta here.1. Nick has to go! He's skeevy, ugly and dragging the whole show down.2. Put Kalinda back to work. Hang up her baseball bat and black belt and keep her out of the bedroom.3. There's not enough of Eli! Give us more... but not of his personal life. Keep him on the campaign trail.4. Forget the Will-and-Alicia romance. There's no chemistry there.5. More Will-and-Diane! Their working relationship, I mean. But please don't put them in the bedroom. (Ditch all the bedroom scenes while you're at it. No one needs to go there.) More Cary at work, too.6. Give us more parenting savvy. Zach and Grace are great kids facing universal teen issues. Show us how Alicia and Peter help them through.7. Spare us Alicia's mom! Veronica is ridiculous. (And give her brother, Owen, something to do other than mope.)8. Spare us Peter's mom! Except the scenes with her nurse companion. He's a hoot! But don't make it into a May-December romance.9. Give us more of the political back-biting of Peter's campaign. It's delicious!10. More courtroom and legal drama, please. But keep the violence and graphic images off-stage, as they were at first.

The actors are appealing and the script is frequently delicious, especially when Peter runs for office or has to do a deal with a devil (Wendy Scott-Carr?) in order to buy credibility.  The relationship between Alicia and Peter seems real and complex and just as fraught as you might expect.  As a lawyer, the legal bits of this show are almost unwatchable.  From the very first season it was ridiculous, but it gets ever more so as time goes on and in this 4th season it's downright laughable.  It's like a pointillist version of the law -- if you stay very far away it looks plausible, but as you get closer it looks more and more like nothing.  The basics of the cases are interesting, but the timeframes and behavior of lawyers are just insane and unrealistic.  Kalinda the magical ""law firm investigator"" does not have a job found at most law firms and since she transgresses the law regularly, LG would constantly be in trouble.  Honestly, no big firm is doing that much criminal work, and especially it's not doing blood and guts criminal work. Still, I watch because although the courtroom drama is terrible, the relationships between and among people do feel real.  Law firms do have partners like David Lee, and Diane, and (to a lesser extent) Will and they react in more or less real ways. The personalities of the various judges feel right also.

The title of this show is a bit misleading because it's about a family split apart by a philandering husband who is now in a high position in government and running for governor while trying to keep the facade of his marriage as if all was well though the public is well aware he has had several 'sessions' with prostitutes. The wife is slowly letting him back in her good graces but first has an affair of her own which her husband suspects. The show really spends more time in the courtroom and the offices where the wife has, after 15 years away, restarted her career. The husband played by Chris Noth (of Sex and the City) and Julianna Marquiles (of ER fame) plays his wife but we see more of her as a competent and extremely talented lawyer who could seemingly do well on her own. I have to say I like the Good Wife more than Scandal. The twists and turns the show is taking are just as show-stopping as in Scandal and for no particular reason or reasons I can't express this show has become one of my favorites.Alan Cummings, Stockard Chaning, Christine Baranski (Cybil) are the most well known of the cast  do a damn good job. Nathan Lane gives a amazing performance as well as many other guest stars you would recognize from other shows.If you have not seen The Good Wife do give it a gander....If you are a prime member check out the first four seasons on your tablet or Fire or any Amazon product that will stream to see if you love it and you can go from there.
