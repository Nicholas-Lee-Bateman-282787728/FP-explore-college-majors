Some years ago I rented a copy of Hitchcock's THE FARMER'S WIFE on VHS and it was this version released by Republic Picture. There is NO sound track at all but the picture quality and the projected speed are excellent. So rather then do a hit and miss on finding a decent copy of this delightful romantic Hitchcock silent I jumped at a chance of getting a copy that knew had a decent transfer. Very pleased with it.,4,A DIFFERENT SIDE OF HITCHCOCK,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,499,"['day', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'general', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'anything', 'VHS', 'years', 'rented', 'copy', 'Hitchcock', 'THE', 'FARMER', 'WIFE', 'VHS', 'was', 'version', 'released', 'Republic', 'Picture', 'NO', 'sound', 'track', 'picture', 'quality', 'projected', 'speed', 'are', 'excellent', 'So', 'rather', 'then', 'do', 'hit', 'miss', 'finding', 'decent', 'copy', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'Hitchcock', 'silent', 'jumped', 'chance', 'getting', 'copy', 'knew', 'had', 'decent', 'transfer', 'Very', 'pleased']",Farmer's Wife VHS

The dramatis personae turns round a humble farmer who seeks desperately a bride after his wife has died. He doesn't seem to realize his housekeeper is in love with him since a long time.

In fact Clara Bow's 'It', Lon Chaney's 'The Phantom of The Opera' and Louise Brooks's 'Pandora's Box' are amongst my all-time favourites. But with the exception of 'The Lodger',  Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife'  certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT  when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one  sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus  points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis  introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good)  score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this  DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look  to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock  enthusiast.",2,A Hitchcock Film In Name Only That Goes On For Ever,961891200,"06 25, 2000",2000,887,"['have', 'nothing', 'silent', 'films', 'fact', 'Clara', 'Bow', ""'It"", 'Lon', 'Chaney', ""'The"", 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'Box', 'are', 'amongst', 'all-time', 'favourites', 'exception', ""'The"", 'Lodger', 'Hitchcock', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'going', 'silent', 'films', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'certainly', 'had', 'potential', 'easy', 'going', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'NOT', 'when', '2', 'hours', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'watch', 'film', 'one', 'sitting', 'eyelids', 'feeling', 'increasingly', 'heavy', 'plus', 'points', 'Laserlight', 'dispensed', 'one', 'embarrassing', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'introductions', 'provided', 'newly', 'recorded', 'very', 'good', 'score', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'good', ""'re"", 'tempted', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Hitchcock', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'worth', 'look', 'anyone', 'interest', 'silent', 'films', 'genuine', 'Hitchcock', 'enthusiast']",Farmer's Wife VHS
354749,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,6303073778,Joker,"[1, 1]","This early Hitchcock silent movie is about a farmer who is a widower and is looking for a new wife.  While he's looking and being very selective, all while also being rejected, something else is brewing in his own house.  I won't reveal what it is.  Watch to find out.This movie came out in 1928, just before ""talkies"" started to become to norm.  This movie is well acted, funny at times, and has a good musical score.

Apparently, the wrong film speed was used in transferring the film to DVD, stretching the film by an additional half hour.  The film's tempo is therefore slowed down a great deal, and the pacing and timing of the various comedy scenes are very much ruined.  The DVD does have decent picture and sound (mono) quality.This dated and predictable film was nevertheless well-acted by Jameson Thomas as the farmer and Lillian Hall-Davis as his housekeeper.

354751,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303073778,Randy Keehn,"[5, 7]","OK, let's get this over with; none of us would even consider watching this movie if it weren't for the fact that it was directed by a young Alfred Hitchcock.  Indeed, it's doubtful that the movie would have even survived into the 21st Century if it weren't for the director who was to go on to much greater heights.  Yet Hitchcock WAS the director and we KNOW he was a masterful director so he must have done a GREAT job, right?  Well, not really.  I found myself interested somewhat in ""The Farmer's Wife"" because there is a fair amount of humor in it.  I don't know if I laughed out loud but I smiled a few times.  I considered asking my wife to waych it and see if she thought I'd end up the same way.  However, the one real problem with this movie is that it is TOO long.  Frankly, I breathed a sigh of relief when I thought the movie was over.  ""Maybe it wasn't all that long afterall"" I told myself.  Yet when the film actually did end about 10 minutes after I thought it would, I had to admit, a lot of it belong on the film editor's floor.  For the record, this is a silent movie (Hitchcock directed England's first ""talkie"" shortly after he made ""The Farmer's Wife"").  Silent movies need good expressive acting to succeed and I felt that this movie had that.  It was proably it's stregth (along with the humor).  It's the story of a widower who decides he'll take another wife and how he is angered when his choice of spouse isn't receptive to the idea.  He goes through several disappointments all seemingly in the same day before he discovers the obvious choice.I got this movie as part of an ""Early Hitchcock"" set.  In that sense, I have no qualms that I bought the DVD.  I would have been disappointed to have bought this by itself.  I liked it well enough but I doubt (due to its' length) that I'll ever watch it again.",3,Strictly for the Film Historians,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,1833,"['OK', 'let', 'get', 'none', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'was', 'directed', 'young', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Indeed', 'doubtful', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'survived', '21st', 'Century', 'were', ""n't"", 'director', 'who', 'was', 'go', 'much', 'greater', 'heights', 'Hitchcock', 'WAS', 'director', 'KNOW', 'was', 'masterful', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'GREAT', 'job', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'found', 'interested', 'somewhat', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'fair', 'amount', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'smiled', 'few', 'times', 'considered', 'asking', 'wife', 'waych', 'see', 'thought', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'same', 'way', 'However', 'one', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'TOO', 'long', 'Frankly', 'breathed', 'sigh', 'relief', 'when', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'afterall', 'told', 'when', 'film', 'actually', 'did', 'end', '10', 'minutes', 'thought', 'would', 'had', 'admit', 'lot', 'film', 'editor', 'floor', 'record', 'silent', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', 'England', 'first', 'talkie', 'shortly', 'made', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'Silent', 'movies', 'need', 'good', 'expressive', 'acting', 'succeed', 'felt', 'movie', 'had', 'was', 'proably', 'stregth', 'humor', 'story', 'widower', 'who', ""'ll"", 'take', 'wife', 'how', 'angered', 'when', 'choice', 'spouse', ""n't"", 'receptive', 'idea', 'several', 'disappointments', 'seemingly', 'same', 'day', 'obvious', 'choice.I', 'got', 'movie', 'part', 'Early', 'Hitchcock', 'set', 'sense', 'have', 'qualms', 'bought', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'have', 'bought', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'doubt', 'due', 'length', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",Farmer's Wife VHS
