((Spoiler Alert)) This woman dies and her spirit merges with that of another man who was in an accident with her. The man survives the accident but the woman does not. So the dude is going about minding his own business, when he sees a house for sale and he feels drawn to the house. He meets the owner of the house who is a man who had just lost his wife and he is immediately attracted to the man. To make a long story short the man's wife merged with the other guy and was just returning to her life. So the men form a sort of relationship and things are looking good, until the dude is in another accident and loses the wife's spirit. The men were sad that she was gone, as was the attraction between the two and they cried because for a moment they had both known a great love.

1148582,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00153CLNK,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[32, 33]","""Back Soon"" (2007) read the note that Logan's (Windham Beacham) wife, Adrianne, left for him when she went out to run an errand.  Unfortunately, she was involved in a fatal auto accident and never returned.  It looked to the couple's friends that Logan would never recover from that shock, and they weren't surprised when he decided to sell the couple's dream house, since it held far too many memories.The first morning the house is being shown, Gil (Matthew Montgomery) is the first potential buyer, and immediately feels a ""connection,"" not just with the house but also with Logan.  That connection develops into a close friendship in a very short time, and takes a step beyond that one night, when a sleepwalking Logan enters Gil's bed and these two ""straight"" young men have sex.  This is a surprise to both of them, since they were never attracted to other men before, but it somehow felt right, as do the feelings they have for each other.  In time, the possible cause of those feelings surfaces.This isn't your typical gay romance, and only some minor characters identify as gay.  While done on a tiny budget (and it shows), from a screenplay with more than its share of trite, cheesy lines, and featuring acting (with the exception of the two lead actors named, who made it almost believable) that would be laughed off a high school stage, the story is at least original in its approach to explore the dynamics of attraction and love, with a ""Twilight Zone""-ish twist that is both thought-provoking as well as slightly cringe-inducing.  Reviews are all over the scales on this, since it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  Gay fans of fate and the supernatural may like it more. Good DVD extras include actor and director commentaries, cast interviews and a stills gallery.

Following the untimely death of his wife, Logan is selling their dream home which contains way too many memories. It just so happens that the buyer is the same drunk driver who killed Logans wife Adrianne, who seems to be hellbent as a ghost to put these two men together in a relationship, although both of them are straight. I liked this film, yet at the same time I'm a tad confused as to what this movie is really all about. The concept is pretty neat and original, however the story line lacks delivery big time! It's as if the writer is totally burnt out and didn't care about any attention to detail. There are too many vague areas that need answering. The acting of Windham Beacham is excellent and he was very well cast in this film. His character is refreshing but would shine much more with a well written plot. The ""straightness"" of the two characters who just somehow end up in bed together, is very unbelievable. Matthew Montgomery done a fine acting job, but frankly I didn't feel he was well cast here. Too much contrast between he and Beacham, and not very believable that the two could possibly have anything in common or form any kind of connection. Montgomery's lines especially were very scathe and ill written. I loved the house, the backdrops were mostly all perfect. The hospital scenes were lousy, unrealistic, had a very ameteur overtone that stunk. The friendship of Logan and his brother in law Spencer could have had more background given to it as could the love between Logan and Adrianne. The story begins really too far into the plot, and begins with confusion that takes too long to figure out what's going on. Good concept, good premise, good acting, but not a professionally written film at all! The ending is weird and also left unexplained. One viewer remarked of what an incredible ending. I simply don't understand where that review came from. The ending was much like the rest of the film, sketchy and poorly written. I like the film overall. I can't exactly say I wasted my money, yet I also can't say it was worth it either. In addition to the poorly written story, this film also lacks raw emotion. Beacham tried hard to insert this into his character , however the script just didn't make room for it. I'd love to see this film redone with a better script and a little different casting. All in all, I'd say it's worth watching, but there are far better films you can purchase than this one. If you are a diehard fan of TLA films, you probably won't mind so much, it's a pretty typical run of the mill TLA, but certainly not one of their best.",3,"So, now what do we do?",1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2672,"['am', 'faced', 'same', 'question', 'twice', 'asked', 'film', 'now', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Following', 'untimely', 'death', 'wife', 'Logan', 'selling', 'dream', 'home', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'memories', 'just', 'so', 'buyer', 'same', 'drunk', 'driver', 'who', 'killed', 'Logans', 'wife', 'Adrianne', 'who', 'be', 'hellbent', 'ghost', 'put', 'two', 'men', 'together', 'relationship', 'are', 'straight', 'liked', 'film', 'yet', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'tad', 'confused', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'concept', 'pretty', 'neat', 'original', 'however', 'story', 'line', 'delivery', 'big', 'time', 'writer', 'totally', 'burnt', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'vague', 'areas', 'need', 'answering', 'acting', 'Windham', 'Beacham', 'excellent', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'film', 'character', 'refreshing', 'would', 'shine', 'much', 'more', 'well', 'written', 'plot', 'straightness', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'just', 'somehow', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'done', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'here', 'Too', 'much', 'contrast', 'Beacham', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'two', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'form', 'kind', 'connection', 'Montgomery', 'lines', 'especially', 'were', 'very', 'scathe', 'ill', 'written', 'loved', 'house', 'backdrops', 'were', 'mostly', 'perfect', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'were', 'lousy', 'unrealistic', 'had', 'very', 'ameteur', 'overtone', 'stunk', 'friendship', 'Logan', 'brother', 'law', 'Spencer', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'background', 'given', 'could', 'love', 'Logan', 'Adrianne', 'story', 'really', 'too', 'far', 'plot', 'confusion', 'too', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Good', 'concept', 'good', 'premise', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'professionally', 'written', 'film', 'ending', 'weird', 'also', 'left', 'unexplained', 'One', 'viewer', 'remarked', 'what', 'incredible', 'ending', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'review', 'came', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'sketchy', 'poorly', 'written', 'film', 'overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'wasted', 'money', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'addition', 'poorly', 'written', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Beacham', 'tried', 'hard', 'insert', 'character', 'however', 'script', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'room', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'film', 'redone', 'better', 'script', 'little', 'different', 'casting', ""'d"", 'say', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'can', 'purchase', 'one', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'TLA', 'films', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'pretty', 'typical', 'run', 'mill', 'TLA', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'best']",Back Soon

The premise that two persons, in simultaneous near-death experiences, share a bond when one (a man) revives, though the other (a woman) dies, and the surviving male inherits the love of the woman for her erstwhile husband (with many other things in common with the deceased wife) could make a great sci-fi/fantasy motion picture for Hollywood, or, given the sexual angle, an independent studio of means sufficient to make of such a project a grander work, with more vivid and eerie suggestions of the paranormal, than ""Back Soon"" ever could be and could do on such limited production means.This film nonetheless was made, obviously on a budget too modest to realise fully enough such an ambitious concept, but it still is an interesting one to view.

""Back Soon"" is no exception... but like the others, it has a big ol' heart that keeps the film pumping and an integrity that I liked.Unlike the others, however, it also relies on a bit of the supernatural for its main plot premise.  The big question the film raises is this: Is true love also blind and never-ending?""Back Soon"" says it most certainly is.  I won't give away too much of the story, but there is a big, obvious supernatural reason that straight boys Logan (Windham Beacham) and Gil (Matthew Montgomery) are brought together.  And my favorite parts of the film are when they are examining this paradox.  There's a sensitivity and rawness that struck me as original, fresh and surprisingly real.  Montgomery's gruff, deep performance adds a lot to this dynamic; he carries the film.The stumbling points of the film are all attributable to the relatively cheap budget and ridiculous supporting characters, from the nosy realtor, to the screaming-queen best pal, to the beyond-stereotyped gang-banga, to the ultra-perfect-but-dead wife, to the unbelievably (as in JUST. NOT. BELIEVABLE.) bigoted brother-in-law.  Every time one of these two-dimensional losers graced the screen I couldn't wait for them to get back to the main characters.At its core, ""Back Soon"" is a bit talky, and there are way too many moments of Logan staring off pensively into the distance.  That said, I did love the goofy auditions-on-tape (Logan is an actor by trade) and ""Trixie's Revenge"", the incredibly bad movie-within-a-movie... it's a less than subtle reminder of how low a film like this could sink and doesn't.Overall, the premise of this film saves it for me.

1148591,A28WJ9OIAEEJSI,B00153CLNK,"JakeDee ""Keith Drummond""","[6, 6]","You just don't find ambiguity is most American films.  Period.  And, as we see from some other reviews, here and elsewhere, there are lots of folks who really don't like ambiguity.  I can't say, of course, what Rob Williams was ultimately up to here, but, for my part, I found the whole development believable, touching, and, in one scene at least, profoundly moving.  I've lived too long and seen too many a hitherto straight-identified guy suddenly in a love (or sexual) relationship with another straight dude or (more usually) a gay guy, so THAT didn't bother me.  The whole ghost thing (and Maggie Eilertson is wonderful) is handled in a distinctly Jamesian way.  Think TURN OF THE SCREW.  Or the really unnerving THE INNOCENTS with the great and glorious Deborah Kerr from '61.  Is it all real?  Is what we're seeing some kind of psychological projection? Is Logan so drove up he's got to find a succubus to urge him on to Gil? As to the unlikely mixture of Gil's character and Logan's, while another reviewer said it's unbelievable, again, I disagree.  Gil even addresses that issue.Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham are both, in my opinion, fine actors.  Of a distinctly modern sort, to be sure, but both possess the extraordinary gift of being able to span the gulf between the crazy world of making a film, and our seeing a product that captivates, charms, makes us laugh, or cry.  And that ain't no shabby gift!  I've seen both actors in rather more than a few other films.  Montgomery, who I think is extraordinarily good looking, with a peculiarly testosterone-saturated charisma, I find very attractive indeed.  He's also got one of the most mobile and expressive faces I've ever seen in recent years, able to convey some seriously subtle emotions and riffs going through his head.  Beacham also plays his disparate reactions in such a way that both visibly and audibly you do feel fairly sure you know what's going through his head, too.  What's fascinating is that both men are gay and out and proud, and the ""straight"" characters they create are, as I say, believable and strikingly different:  Gil is clearly the more mature, experienced man to the gawky, somewhat spoiled, and bewildered Logan.I feel more sorry than otherwise for Artie O'Daly, because while I really liked him in LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP, here he's got, well, let's just say an ungrateful part to play. You'll know what I'm talking about when and if you see the film.  On the other hand, may God be thanked for having given us Kelly Keaton.

The next time we see him he is in his living room packing away all the things that made the house a home.  He's selling it, he can no longer live in the house without his beloved wife ""too many ghosts"" as he explains.It's been a year since his wife died; everyone is telling him it's time to move on, to get past it.  But how do you get past losing the only person you have ever loved, or will ever love?  How do you just one day say goodbye and let that be the end.  On the first day of the open house Logan is mistaken for the real-estate agent by a potential buyer Guillermo ""everybody just calls me Gill"" Ramirez.  Logan gives him a tour of the house and is compelled to sell him the house.  Not because of anything other than a gut feeling he's following.  He heart has over ruled his head.That should be the end of it but something strange happens.  Logan and Gill strike up an unlikely friendship.  Even though these are two men from vastly different backgrounds; Logan is a struggling actor with a few bad indie movie credits and Gill as we come to find out is an ex-drug dealer.  One night they become closer than they ever dared imagine possible.  Especially since both men are straight.No this isn't a film about repressed men figuring out who they really are and finding away to live with it and setting themselves and each other free.  We've all seen that story before.  As Gill tells his friend Jamie after first sleeping with Logan ""this is something new.""  These are two straight men, who fall deeply in love with one another but who are not attracted to other men only each other.As the film develops we find out how it can be that these two men can be in love with each other.  We find out that love has no limits, not even death.  And we find out the nature of loss, and what unconditional love can be.",4,Not just another gay love story....,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1989,"['Does', 'love', 'end', 'death', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Logan', 'Foster', 'hospital', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'doctor', 'come', 'out', 'tell', 'how', 'life', 'change', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'living', 'room', 'packing', 'away', 'things', 'made', 'house', 'home', 'selling', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'house', 'beloved', 'wife', 'too', 'many', 'ghosts', 'been', 'year', 'wife', 'died', 'everyone', 'telling', 'time', 'move', 'get', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'losing', 'only', 'person', 'have', 'ever', 'loved', 'will', 'ever', 'love', 'How', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'say', 'goodbye', 'let', 'be', 'end', 'first', 'day', 'open', 'house', 'Logan', 'mistaken', 'real-estate', 'agent', 'potential', 'buyer', 'Guillermo', 'everybody', 'just', 'Gill', 'Ramirez', 'Logan', 'tour', 'house', 'compelled', 'sell', 'house', 'Not', 'anything', 'other', 'gut', 'feeling', 'following', 'heart', 'over', 'ruled', 'head.That', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'something', 'strange', 'happens', 'Logan', 'Gill', 'strike', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Even', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'vastly', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Logan', 'struggling', 'actor', 'few', 'bad', 'indie', 'movie', 'credits', 'Gill', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'ex-drug', 'dealer', 'One', 'night', 'become', 'closer', 'ever', 'dared', 'imagine', 'possible', 'Especially', 'men', 'are', 'straight.No', ""n't"", 'film', 'repressed', 'men', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'finding', 'away', 'live', 'setting', 'other', 'free', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'before', 'Gill', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'first', 'sleeping', 'Logan', 'something', 'new', 'are', 'two', 'straight', 'men', 'who', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'attracted', 'other', 'men', 'only', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'two', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'love', 'other', 'find', 'out', 'love', 'limits', 'not', 'even', 'death', 'find', 'out', 'nature', 'loss', 'what', 'unconditional', 'love', 'can', 'be']",Back Soon

The cover art is unattractive and the plot seemed without nuance, as you know already what's going on without having seen the film.  In fact, the first scene of the movie gives it away.Now, having seen the film and liked it enough to want it in my collection, I can say the cover art is still bad.  And I would suggest the third lead, the female actor, should be the figure looming over the two lead males.I like the leads, both good actors, and I'm sure their contrasting physical appeal will have the audience member favoring one or the other - Montgomery is very angular, sharp-featured, while Beacham is lush, and has a more timeless appeal.  There are a few kisses, but nothing more overt in any male-to-male physical interaction on-screen.The plot has to do with how two straight guys find themselves in love with each other, and how they deal with that.  The conclusion to the film will be a surprise.There are a couple of bad missteps from the filmmaker:  for one, there was no mystery, hence no surprise, as to the motifications behind the brother-in-law's behavior, and it seemed the performance by the actor should have been reined in, as well.  Some of the smaller roles are well-filled, but there are bad dialogue scenes.  Overall, the screenplay needed some finetuning, mainly to eliminate so much of the stereotyping of both male and female.  The screenplay, at times, is unintentionally laughable, and not in a good way, more in a ""this is camp"" way.  When there is too much of that, fortunately the performances of the two leads - both separately and together - saves the day.The worst bit, merely because it's so inappropriate, is when one character ends up brandishing a gun.  I won't go into details, but for some reason the actor points the weapon like the short-lived Hollywood fantasy of gun-slinging that involved shooting sideways.  It was short-lived, because it was laughed at by virtually anyone who's ever handled a gun.  If you hold a gun the way the character did in this film, basically you could be three steps from a barn and still miss it.  So that was a big unintentional eye-popping laughfest during an otherwise tense scene, so the diector blew the big one, so to speak.The director has interesting ideas - his LTR was great in exploring an aspect of being in love I can't recall another filmmaker delving into - but doesn't do some of the basic practical work behind the scenes to ensure a great product before he starts pointing his camera and saying ""Action.""  Hopefully he will have evolved by the time his third offering is set in motion.",4,"Good, but a couple of wrong turns",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2694,"['hesitated', 'over', 'seeing', 'film', 'even', 'loved', 'LONG-TERM', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'same', 'filmmaker', 'cover', 'art', 'unattractive', 'plot', 'seemed', 'nuance', 'know', 'already', 'what', 'going', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'fact', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'away.Now', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'liked', 'enough', 'want', 'collection', 'can', 'say', 'cover', 'art', 'still', 'bad', 'would', 'suggest', 'third', 'lead', 'female', 'actor', 'should', 'be', 'figure', 'looming', 'two', 'lead', 'males.I', 'leads', 'good', 'actors', ""'m"", 'sure', 'contrasting', 'physical', 'appeal', 'will', 'have', 'audience', 'member', 'favoring', 'one', 'other', 'Montgomery', 'very', 'angular', 'sharp-featured', 'Beacham', 'lush', 'more', 'timeless', 'appeal', 'are', 'few', 'kisses', 'nothing', 'more', 'overt', 'male-to-male', 'physical', 'interaction', 'on-screen.The', 'plot', 'do', 'how', 'two', 'straight', 'guys', 'find', 'love', 'other', 'how', 'deal', 'conclusion', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'surprise.There', 'are', 'couple', 'bad', 'missteps', 'filmmaker', 'one', 'was', 'mystery', 'hence', 'surprise', 'motifications', 'brother-in-law', 'behavior', 'seemed', 'performance', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reined', 'well', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'well-filled', 'are', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'Overall', 'screenplay', 'needed', 'finetuning', 'mainly', 'eliminate', 'so', 'much', 'stereotyping', 'male', 'female', 'screenplay', 'times', 'unintentionally', 'laughable', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'more', 'camp', 'way', 'When', 'too', 'much', 'fortunately', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'separately', 'together', 'day.The', 'worst', 'bit', 'merely', 'so', 'inappropriate', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'up', 'brandishing', 'gun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'reason', 'actor', 'weapon', 'short-lived', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'gun-slinging', 'involved', 'shooting', 'sideways', 'was', 'short-lived', 'was', 'laughed', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'handled', 'gun', 'hold', 'gun', 'way', 'character', 'did', 'film', 'basically', 'could', 'be', 'three', 'steps', 'barn', 'still', 'miss', 'was', 'big', 'unintentional', 'eye-popping', 'laughfest', 'otherwise', 'tense', 'scene', 'diector', 'blew', 'big', 'one', 'so', 'speak.The', 'director', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'LTR', 'was', 'great', 'exploring', 'aspect', 'being', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'filmmaker', 'delving', ""n't"", 'do', 'basic', 'practical', 'work', 'scenes', 'ensure', 'great', 'product', 'pointing', 'camera', 'saying', 'Action', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'evolved', 'time', 'third', 'offering', 'set', 'motion']",Back Soon
