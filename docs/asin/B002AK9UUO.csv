1258266,A1SNZ34LO0CQ0B,B002AK9UUO,R. J. Nodes,"[1, 2]","Celtic Thunder adds to their triumphal debut album with this second entry in the series. This time, they're on the road in Ontario, Canada with a live show, and a huge crowd who seem to be made up of enthusiastic Celts, judging by the Irish dancing in the aisles and the signs being waved. The most remarkable aspect of the show is the change in both voice and appearance of young Damian McGinty, now almost 17 years old, and two years removed from the debut performance in Ireland. It is a bit sad to hear his voice has deepened considerably, as he's grown into a taller young man (he's not the little boy you remember from 2007), but his voice now has a new and wonderful quality. There have been changes in singing arrangements necessitated by this: Ryan Kelly now handles some of the ""boy soprano"" parts and Mr. McGinty has taken over the lead singing on numbers such as ""Steal Away"". The addition of two instrumental numbers of the purely Celtic variety allows the showcasing of the musical talents of Neal Byrne, Barry Kerr and a very talented all-female string section, composed of what appears to be two sisters on violins, a viola player, and Megan Sherwood on Cello. They also contribute their vocal talents accompanying Damian on two of his solos. Just as in the first show from Dublin, one sees the end with a regret of not having been there. The act has not visited the American south, except for Atlanta (as far as I know), so I hope someday to see them in person. They have brought true musical joy to thousands of followers around the world, and it's hard to imagine them giving a performance that is not a sellout audience. I highly recommend them and ""Take Me Home"" is as worthy introduction if you haven't heard them before.

This new video is good, but contains far to many songs that were on the first video with out improving on any of them. I do not know if it is because I have heard them so many times or what, but in almost every case I prefer the other video.Damion's voice has changed, as of coarse it should,but I much prefer A BIRD WITHOUT WINGS, in the first video over this one.If you enjoyed the the show on the first video you will most likely enjoy this one, but next time I hope they have some new material.",3,Good but not great,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,574,"['enjoyed', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'new', 'video', 'good', 'far', 'many', 'songs', 'were', 'first', 'video', 'out', 'improving', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'what', 'almost', 'case', 'prefer', 'other', 'video.Damion', 'voice', 'changed', 'coarse', 'should', 'much', 'prefer', 'BIRD', 'WITHOUT', 'WINGS', 'first', 'video', 'one.If', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'first', 'video', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'one', 'next', 'time', 'hope', 'have', 'new', 'material']",Celtic Thunder: Take Me Home

Each member can put on a show alone when they do a solo but when they sing together it's a powerful thing that no one should miss. I can't wait for this DVD release.,5,Loved it! Loved them!

1258273,A1SLVEBLUCOCO2,B002AK9UUO,T. N.,"[3, 4]","While the performance of CT is as mesmerizing as before, the new DVD (Take Me Home) includes mostly the old material already seen in the previous DVD (The Show). Only a handful of songs are new in this program, which makes me feel disappointed, having paid twice for almost the same thing. That said, the new numbers are quite good. Belfast Polka/Pennsylvania Railroad is really fun, especially the female violinists shaking their hips in their silky dresses. Working Man and Yesterday's Men are excellent songs about a worker's life. Take Me Home and Danny Boy showcase how terrific all five talents sound when combined. Damian has grown up quite a bit and his voice has been deepened, but I don't think it's a good idea for him to cover Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen and Breaking Up Is Hard To Do. It's fun for him, as a kid, to play with Puppy Love or Young Love, but at this stage I think he should get more original material such as A Bird Without Wings to match his talent instead of covering outdated mediocrities. And Paul, thanks for You Raise Me Up, which shows beneath your talent there's also a sensitive, lovable soul.",3,Somewhat disappointing,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,1130,"['performance', 'CT', 'as', 'mesmerizing', 'before', 'new', 'DVD', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'mostly', 'old', 'material', 'already', 'seen', 'previous', 'DVD', 'Show', 'Only', 'handful', 'songs', 'are', 'new', 'program', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'having', 'paid', 'twice', 'almost', 'same', 'thing', 'said', 'new', 'numbers', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Belfast', 'Polka/Pennsylvania', 'Railroad', 'really', 'fun', 'especially', 'female', 'violinists', 'shaking', 'hips', 'silky', 'dresses', 'Working', 'Man', 'Yesterday', 'Men', 'are', 'excellent', 'songs', 'worker', 'life', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'showcase', 'how', 'terrific', 'five', 'talents', 'sound', 'when', 'combined', 'Damian', 'grown', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'voice', 'been', 'deepened', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'idea', 'cover', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'Breaking', 'Up', 'Hard', 'Do', 'fun', 'kid', 'play', 'Puppy', 'Love', 'Young', 'Love', 'stage', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'original', 'material', 'such', 'Bird', 'Without', 'Wings', 'match', 'talent', 'instead', 'covering', 'outdated', 'mediocrities', 'Paul', 'thanks', 'Raise', 'Me', 'Up', 'talent', 'also', 'sensitive', 'lovable', 'soul']",Celtic Thunder: Take Me Home
