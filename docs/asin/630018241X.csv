201850,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,630018241X,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[59, 63]","I first saw this film when it came out in the theatres... I was ten (you do the math...) and it was one of those transgressive '70s comedies that all the kids in 5th and 6th grade were psyched to sneak into the theatres to see, all filled with sex and drugs and cuss words. I rented it recently because I was in the mood for some '70s exploit-o-kitsch, and was quite surprised at how much depth the film actually had. Written by future Hollywood honcho Joel Schumacher, ""Car Wash"" is a tragedy that masquerades as a farce, capturing the antics of a dozen clownish, stereotypical losers during a single day spent scrubbing cars at a grimy Los Angeles car wash. They lighten their work day through pranks, daydreams, slapstick and even a little bit of sex, drugs and sweet, funky music. (The theme song by Rose Royce remains one of the best disco-era pop tunes.) Behind the comedic facade, though, lies an earnest exploration of the sadness of a truly dead-end job, and by the film's end, its true heroes are revealed as Abdullah (Bill Duke), an angry, humorless African-American Muslim who is the butt of everyone else's jokes, and Lonnie, the underpaid, ex-con foreman of the gang, who are the only ones facing up to the harshness of their economic situation. They're just trying to hang on to their dignity and not slip through the cracks, while all the other guys have pretty much given up, or just don't care. Admittedly, there's an whiff of condescention to the script, and a film-schoolish formalism to its dualistic structure, but there's also a surprisingly sincere, substantive human element. What seems like an ""Saturday Night Live-"" ish, sketch-based light comedy is actually kind of a painful film at heart. Interestingly enough, the taboo titillations that drew us kiddies to the film back in the day are actually the parts that don't hold up -- George Carlin's episodic gag routines as a foul-mouthed cabbie tracking down a prostitute who skipped out on her fare all fall flat: there's no there there. (Richard Pryor, however, turns in a nice, succinct cameo as a flashy, pimp-suited televangelist who takes his stretch limo through the carwash, and spars with Abdullah about his supposed obligations to the community...) At any rate, the swearing and crass sex gags have largely lost their power to shock (what sounded so nasty back in '76 seems pretty tame now, in comparison to what you can see on TV or even in PG films...) but the film itself is still worth checking out. It captures a certain slice of the 'Seventies, a low-key, unassuming grittiness that didn't rely on the shock tactics of the era's crime films and yet gives us a pretty honest picture of what folks were going through back in a decade of recession, disillusionment and indulgence.",4,Look beneath the surface; it's actually a pretty good film,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,2769,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'was', 'ten', 'do', 'math', 'was', 'one', 'transgressive', 'comedies', 'kids', '5th', '6th', 'grade', 'were', 'psyched', 'sneak', 'theatres', 'see', 'filled', 'sex', 'drugs', 'cuss', 'words', 'rented', 'recently', 'was', 'mood', ""'70s"", 'exploit-o-kitsch', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'actually', 'had', 'Written', 'future', 'Hollywood', 'honcho', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Car', 'Wash', 'tragedy', 'farce', 'capturing', 'antics', 'dozen', 'clownish', 'stereotypical', 'losers', 'single', 'day', 'spent', 'scrubbing', 'cars', 'grimy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'car', 'wash', 'lighten', 'work', 'day', 'pranks', 'daydreams', 'slapstick', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'sex', 'drugs', 'sweet', 'funky', 'music', 'theme', 'song', 'Rose', 'Royce', 'one', 'best', 'disco-era', 'pop', 'tunes', 'comedic', 'facade', 'though', 'earnest', 'exploration', 'sadness', 'truly', 'dead-end', 'job', 'film', 'end', 'true', 'heroes', 'are', 'revealed', 'Abdullah', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'angry', 'humorless', 'African-American', 'Muslim', 'who', 'butt', 'everyone', 'else', 'jokes', 'Lonnie', 'underpaid', 'ex-con', 'foreman', 'gang', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'facing', 'up', 'harshness', 'economic', 'situation', ""'re"", 'just', 'trying', 'hang', 'dignity', 'not', 'slip', 'cracks', 'other', 'guys', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'up', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Admittedly', 'whiff', 'condescention', 'script', 'film-schoolish', 'formalism', 'dualistic', 'structure', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'sincere', 'substantive', 'human', 'element', 'What', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live-', 'ish', 'sketch-based', 'light', 'comedy', 'actually', 'kind', 'painful', 'film', 'heart', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'taboo', 'titillations', 'drew', 'kiddies', 'film', 'back', 'day', 'are', 'actually', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'George', 'Carlin', 'episodic', 'gag', 'routines', 'foul-mouthed', 'cabbie', 'tracking', 'down', 'prostitute', 'who', 'skipped', 'out', 'fare', 'fall', 'flat', 'there', 'there', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'however', 'nice', 'succinct', 'cameo', 'flashy', 'pimp-suited', 'televangelist', 'who', 'stretch', 'limo', 'carwash', 'spars', 'Abdullah', 'supposed', 'obligations', 'community', 'rate', 'swearing', 'crass', 'sex', 'gags', 'have', 'largely', 'lost', 'power', 'shock', 'what', 'sounded', 'so', 'nasty', 'back', ""'76"", 'pretty', 'tame', 'now', 'comparison', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'TV', 'even', 'PG', 'films', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'certain', 'slice', ""'Seventies"", 'low-key', 'unassuming', 'grittiness', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'shock', 'tactics', 'era', 'crime', 'films', 'yet', 'pretty', 'honest', 'picture', 'what', 'folks', 'were', 'going', 'back', 'decade', 'recession', 'disillusionment', 'indulgence']",N/A

For instance, the ZOO DISCO DJ, and the man who played Floyd. With that regard, this movie fits right in to that category. I would say this one is up a notch over TGIF though, although I liked that too, and the similarities between the two are astounding in storytelling comedic soap opera style. Although the stories and adventures in this one are much tighter and move briskly. I do admit I noticed some cutting of some footage, but that doesnt stop the movie from having its appeal, whether you approve of disco or not.The soundtrack, I recall at the time, was a major hit and it does not sound dated here as in TGIF, because the soul jive is mainstream with title cut and many additions, plus some really good ballads like, ""Im Going Down"" & ""I Wanna Get Next To You.""The cameo appearance by Richard Pryor only adds to the chemistry that already exists in the movie, giving it zesty appeal along with the famed Pointer Sisters striking a good song church style in ""You Gotta Believe.""They really do need to compile this movie into its original long running format though, but the songs are there, and so is the comedy.

I was excited when I saw the ad for ""The Wash"" with Dre and Snoop because I thought it was a rendition of ""Car Wash.""  Buuuuzzzz!  Wrong answer, ""The Wash"" was an excuse.  The only thing having to do with ""Car Wash"" was that it was filmed in the same style in the same location, not a remake!  ""The Wash"" stank!  'It' needed a WASH, with a second and third coat of soap and still wouldn't match up to what I though was a remake.  It's cool that the casting department used Rich for ""Daddy Rich"" as it worked as a vehicle to promote the movie, and ultimately allows Rich to make the cameo of all cameos.  The real star of this movie is Bill Duke, now a director in his own right, as the truth and maybe the anger and frustration of every black man on this planet named Abdullah.  That character comes to mind daily at my current job and I try so hard not to go off on folks.  Car Wash represented people in an ensembled-scripted environment at a real location.  If you don't know what an ensemble is, think of, ""Who's Line Is It Anyway?""  An All-Star freestyle session given a few lines to set the pace, and the actors take it from there and beyond.  Several directors have tried and failed, I'm glad this one is the example of the classics.  Others I recommend are, ""After Hours,"" ""Friday (all 3,)"" ""3 Strikes,"" and a couple more I can't think of right now.
