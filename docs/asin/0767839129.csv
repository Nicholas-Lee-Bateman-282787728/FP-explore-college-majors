Jovovich did a spectacular job of portraying Joan. She was innocent and pure, yet crazed and wild. It was extremely  refreshing to see a woman warrior for a change and she pulled it off  amazingly. The movie was a bit dry in spots but honestly the ending was  worth the wait. Unlike the opinions of some others...I thought Hoffman was  brilliant...finally a portrayal of god with a touch of darkness. He makes  you fear him to some subtle extent. I was glad to see God shown in a shade  of grey as opposed to the always white and graceful appearance in most  films. I believe that this movie raises alot of questions as to how Joan of  Arc was deemed a Saint, if this enactment is accuate..and who knows...maybe  she wasn't as blessed as believed. I like movies that make you ask  questions and think.

Milla's over-acting creates a character who is both annoying and difficult to believe. None of the central characters are easy to empathize with so one doesn't really care if they live or die. The violence seems unnecessary and gruesome. The script is choppy and the dialog is forced.

21537,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,0767839129,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[9, 18]","Having been somewhat fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc, and entertained by the French flair of Director Luc Besson's movies, it pains me to say that my disappointment in THE MESSENGER is most profound.  Truly, with such a promising opening scene and more than a couple of excellent actors at its disposal - not to mention a mythical and supernatural aura intertwined with an amazing history - one would expect, even at the very least, a little glimmer of brilliance.Yet, apparently, it never was meant to be.  However, I must say, the movie opens promisingly enough:  There's the pious child, Joan d'Arc, living her bright yet humble life in the 15th century French countryside. - She is portrayed at once as being extraordinarily blessed and preternaturally enlightened, by Heaven.  There's Music of Angels singing ecstatic praise, Visions of Divine Power moving nature around her, and Voices of &quot;Him.&quot; (Be it Deity, Angel, Archangel, or perhaps her own Subconscious Soul?  I cannot tell...) - All so enticing and gravitating her toward Heavenly bliss.Yet it is within minutes of these glorious opening scenes that everything takes a very dark turn.  Suddenly, the child Joan sees the storm clouds culminate as the wolves and the English Army thunder in.  The sight of this is quite ominous -- not only for the child Joan, but for the entire course of the movie as well.  It's a shame - because, from here, THE MESSENGER actually could very well have become a movie of remarkable depth, voice and vision.Instead, the whole thing engulfs itself in blustering failures - its own annihilation ignited with the first sight of Milla Jovovich as Joan, the peasant girl, suddenly all grown up.  She makes her first appearance having somehow made her way to the castle of Chinon with a message to the Dauphin Charles VII, France's heir to the crown.  The movie offers no explanation as to how this unknown teenage girl had come to be known as the &quot;Maid of Lorraine,&quot; nor of how she had made her way into the French Court.Apart from various transitional errors and a stunning lack of continuity, this picture further bears the awesome burden of poor casting and an even poorer script.  John Malkovich (Dauphin Charles VII) did a fine enough job of it - however, the script, relative to the role, was not compatible with his talents - and he was very blatantly miscast.  As for Milla Jovovich:  Well, I cannot say much about that folly, actually, without blasting away all credibility to her as an actress.  Truly, that's something I really do not wish to do.  Really, I must say in her defense that it seems she was obliged to make do with a script that made her sound like a borderline psychotic and rebellious adolescent somewhat of the present-day variety.  It's impossible to buy the possibility that anyone in the French Army would even consider following her lead.Sadly enough, the only reason I halfway speak in her defense is that she seemed to speak her lines as if she hated every single word of them - and her every look seemed to disdain the movie.  OK - Well, regardless, even for that, I guess I cannot in my heart of hearts give her any credit as an actress.Finally, I must give no insignificant amount of credit to Dustin Hoffman (the Voice), Faye Dunaway (Mother-In-Law to the Dauphin, Princess d'Aragon), and Timothy West (Pierre Cauchon - a prominent figure in Joan's final trial) for making the most of a flippant and shallow script.Finally, all the more I can say about this movie is that it could have been great, with only a bit more insight.  It's a shame that it fell the other way....",2,A Conflagration,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,3626,"['Having', 'been', 'somewhat', 'fascinated', 'life', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'entertained', 'French', 'flair', 'Director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'movies', 'say', 'disappointment', 'THE', 'MESSENGER', 'most', 'profound', 'Truly', 'promising', 'opening', 'scene', 'more', 'couple', 'excellent', 'actors', 'disposal', 'not', 'mention', 'mythical', 'supernatural', 'aura', 'intertwined', 'amazing', 'history', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'even', 'very', 'least', 'little', 'glimmer', 'brilliance.Yet', 'apparently', 'never', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'pious', 'child', 'Joan', ""d'Arc"", 'living', 'bright', 'yet', 'humble', 'life', '15th', 'century', 'French', 'countryside', 'portrayed', 'once', 'being', 'extraordinarily', 'blessed', 'preternaturally', 'enlightened', 'Heaven', 'Music', 'Angels', 'singing', 'ecstatic', 'praise', 'Visions', 'Divine', 'Power', 'moving', 'nature', 'Voices', 'quot', 'Him.', 'quot', 'Be', 'Deity', 'Angel', 'Archangel', 'perhaps', 'own', 'Subconscious', 'Soul', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'so', 'enticing', 'gravitating', 'Heavenly', 'bliss.Yet', 'minutes', 'glorious', 'opening', 'scenes', 'everything', 'very', 'dark', 'turn', 'Suddenly', 'child', 'Joan', 'storm', 'clouds', 'culminate', 'wolves', 'English', 'Army', 'thunder', 'sight', 'quite', 'ominous', 'not', 'only', 'child', 'Joan', 'entire', 'course', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'shame', 'because', 'here', 'THE', 'MESSENGER', 'actually', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'become', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'voice', 'vision.Instead', 'whole', 'thing', 'engulfs', 'blustering', 'failures', 'own', 'annihilation', 'ignited', 'first', 'sight', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Joan', 'peasant', 'girl', 'suddenly', 'grown', 'up', 'first', 'appearance', 'having', 'somehow', 'made', 'way', 'castle', 'Chinon', 'message', 'Dauphin', 'Charles', 'VII', 'France', 'heir', 'crown', 'movie', 'explanation', 'how', 'unknown', 'teenage', 'girl', 'had', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'quot', 'Maid', 'Lorraine', 'quot', 'how', 'had', 'made', 'way', 'French', 'Court.Apart', 'various', 'transitional', 'errors', 'stunning', 'lack', 'continuity', 'picture', 'further', 'awesome', 'burden', 'poor', 'casting', 'even', 'poorer', 'script', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Dauphin', 'Charles', 'VII', 'did', 'fine', 'enough', 'job', 'however', 'script', 'relative', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'compatible', 'talents', 'was', 'very', 'blatantly', 'miscast', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Well', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'folly', 'actually', 'blasting', 'away', 'credibility', 'actress', 'Truly', 'something', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'do', 'Really', 'must', 'say', 'defense', 'was', 'obliged', 'make', 'do', 'script', 'made', 'sound', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'rebellious', 'adolescent', 'somewhat', 'present-day', 'variety', 'impossible', 'buy', 'possibility', 'anyone', 'French', 'Army', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'following', 'lead.Sadly', 'enough', 'only', 'reason', 'halfway', 'speak', 'defense', 'seemed', 'speak', 'lines', 'hated', 'single', 'word', 'look', 'seemed', 'disdain', 'movie', 'Well', 'regardless', 'even', 'guess', 'can', 'not', 'heart', 'hearts', 'give', 'credit', 'actress.Finally', 'must', 'give', 'insignificant', 'amount', 'credit', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Voice', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Mother-In-Law', 'Dauphin', 'Princess', ""d'Aragon"", 'Timothy', 'West', 'Pierre', 'Cauchon', 'prominent', 'figure', 'Joan', 'final', 'trial', 'making', 'most', 'flippant', 'shallow', 'script.Finally', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'only', 'bit', 'more', 'insight', 'shame', 'fell', 'other', 'way']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Joan asks forgiveness for her sins - again. She converses with `him', who tells her to be good and take care of people. Joan is happy like any care-free child. She finds a sword in the grass. Then wolves run past her! Her village is attacked and burned by soldiers. Her home is invaded. Her older sister Catherine gives her a hiding place. Murder, robbery, and rape follow. [That grave is too shallow.] Joan will live with her aunt and uncle now. Can she forgive her enemies? Did God save her for some higher purpose? In Chinon the Dauphin waits. There is a message from the Maid of Lorraine, a peasant girl who wants to fight for France. Is she a fake? Simple people believe in her, it could be good for morale. Joan comes to meet the Dauphin. She avoids the fake. [Cold reading?] She has a private message to deliver. She wants to ask the King of England to leave France in peace. Or else.Joan rides to Orleans to defend the city. The people gather around. Joan has a new plan to attack the English. ""So that's it!"" The English reply with a simple message: never. Joan rides to rally the French. ""Follow me to victory!"" They do. They raise a bigger army before attacking the English. ""Bless them all."" Joan speaks to and inspires the French army. ""Follow me!"" Joan leads an attack and is struck by an arrow through her chain mail. The next morning Joan recovers and calls for another attack. Joan has a new tactic with an old tower to break into the castle. The French break down the gates and invade the castle. ""We won."" A glorious victory! But the English are forming on the other side of the river. Joan tells them to ""Go Home"" now in peace. Or be buried in the field. The British retreat, Orleans is free. It's a miracle. The Dauphin is crowned in Rheims. The holy oil of Clovis is used to anoint Charles of Valois the king and ruler of France.There is another battle before the walls of Paris. Where are the reinforcement from the King? Has he lost interest? The costs of a big army are high, diplomacy is cheaper. ""France belongs to God."" Can they stop Joan from attacking the Burgundians? Joan is defeated and captured in front of the city gates. The Duke of Burgundy visits her. British gold is the high bidder, Joan will go to Rouen for trial as a heretic. The Bishop asks her to answer questions. Will Joan see her visions again? Did she see what she wanted to see? Joan is questioned at her trial. Her answers are popular with the people. Can they convict her? What is she had been sent by God? Joan never killed anyone, she said. As expected, she is found guilty of heresy and other sins. The College of Paris agreed with the judgment. [Corporate flunkies?] Will she recant her beliefs? She uses an ""X"" as an signature. ""Take her away."" This is a trick to absolve the Churchmen from her condemnation. Dressing as a man in jail condemns her. Can she save her soul?Everyone knows what happened in the market square when Joan was nineteen on May 30, 1431.Five hundred years later she was canonized as a saint. [This is more than posthumous rehabilitation.] This is a very good story if slow and talky in spots. You can compare it to the earlier version with Ingrid Bergman, if you can find the video. The movie does not go into the political background of France and England. Later in the 15th century the English were involved in the Wars of the Roses. France defeated the Duchy of Burgundy in the early 16th century.Note how Joan was wounded with an arrow in her upper right chest, but at the end of the story she had a healed wound on her upper left chest.

Many dismiss it as just show but Besson knew better and flanked his vision is powerful images of war, horror and outstanding acting! Jovovich deserved an Oscar Nomination for this film but due to the films minor flaws such as its often missed directed musical score and bad casting of John Malkovich, voters went cold. The story takes liberties here and ther but a deeper story is there taht no film has ever touched and to really grab the genrebending myths behind the real Joan of Arc who was really called &quot;Joan The Virgin&quot; makes this film even more compelling. Facts like the French may have been embrassed by a poor woman leading them to victory and that Joan was very afraid of being burned at the stake and jumped from the 70 foot high tower which was her prison without a scratch on her when she landed! obviously she was recaptured and burned but while at the stake the crowd began to change their views and demanded for her release. It took the executioner 5 trys to burn her at the stake due to the fire kept burning out! Joan was not on trial for crimes committed against an English king but for immorally corupt behavior due to her donning mens clothing which magically found its way into her cell! This is what she was killed for being a witch! The english belived it looked bad to give just a mere powerfull, intellignet, brave, self driven-19 yr. old the hand of death but to murder an all powerfull witch her last due was justified! Besson's take on this is brilliant painting Joan as a saint to those who love her and powerfull to those who fear her! The film does not paint her as diluted but as the English would want us to view her! Hoffman is brilliant as the FILMS voice of reason and as a whole the images and sounds take full advantage of the films epic scope!

21541,A3TK2IOP8UQ087,0767839129,"Alabaster Jones ""perpenhopher""","[3, 5]","Ok.. this movie has obviously caused some debate about the legend of joan of arc.  However, it seems obvious that debate was its intention.  I suppose there are those who honestly believe that joan was God's messenger.  And there are others who believe there must have been some other explanation.I think this movie can be described as the story of a girl who is so in love with god, and wants more than anything for him to be pleased with her, that she looks for his presence in everything that she encounters.  This love and desire for God is brought nearer to her, as she witnesses her sister's death and subsequent err.. violation.  She wants to know why the God she so loved would leave her alive, while taking her sister.  The obvious conclusion:  God needs her for something.  From this point, the film starts the portrayal of the historical Joan.Many things are brought into question, such as her motivation, the nature of her visions, and even the consistancy of her actions.  None of which are resolved to any specific conclusion, as far as i can see.  I don't believe there is any reason to assume that this film portrays Joan to be a lunatic.  It merely shows the character of Joan questioning herself about it, by means of her conscience (often humorously portrayed by Dustin Hoffman).  She questions her motives, as any right thinking moral christian would, after directly causing the deaths of so many people.  The conclusions that are drawn near the end of the film, are things that she comes to in her own mind, and nowhere is it stated that she was not sent by god to do her work.. only that she had personal motivation for it, and sometimes acted selfishly.  I came away from the film convinced even more that this was a woman with undeniable courage, unshakable faith, and truly, above all, a servant of the God that she spent her whole life trying to be closer to.

21543,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,0767839129,Alexander Suraev,"[1, 2]","Luc Besson looks now as a man with the Midas touch  surprised for the first time in his life by the result. The thing he'd touched did not turn to gold but to something less valuable - something more like copper.I  was stunned by Nikita - no one was expecting such a cool and modern action  movie from a French director. Professional was much more kitschy but still  enjoyable. The Fifth Element's visuals were so exciting no one really cared  about the content and just enjoyed the extravaganza.Now it seems Luc  Besson was carried away and decided he can create a masterpiece just from a  scrap - from his girlfriend's photo to be exact(see the DVD's  leaflet).He employs and directs the team of very skillful cameramen and  costume designers, gets the adequate funding - it's easy for the most  popular French director planning to tell the story of the most famous  French heroine - employs the most handsome French actors and invites some  Americans. Like an experienced pyrotechnic he puts together the fabulous  fireworks expecting them to burst in the sky in many-colored blaze.What  we have instead? Psssshhhhhhhhhick.Why?Obviously Luc Besson has  nothing to say about Joan of Arc.  He had no coherent idea to express -  just action, design and music.There are 3 definite parts in the film -  The Visions, The Battle, The Trial.When he feels one more vision would  be one too much Luc Besson lets the battle begin. Battle scenes are a genre  in themselves, they can hold the viewer's attention with the gory action  and display of curious war machines, weaponry and armour. But after an hour  it all began to look too much. That is 101th time we are shown &quot;The  True Face Of War&quot; in recent years, all these crows pecking dead flesh  and oozing bloody limbs lying all over are something we expect to see -  their's shocking potential is exhausted.What's next ? The Trial. Nothing  memorable here. Dustin Hoffman contributed his name to the film's posters  and DVD covers. I am sure it helped to sell hundreds thousand of tickets  and copies extra, but the role is just ridiculous. Hoffman in gray beard  and hooded robe looks barely recognizable  - his best disguise since  Tootsie. In a sadistic monotone he is stubbing the girl with his stupid and  pretentious questions.By the way - no doubt that was a fashion these  days but Faye's shaven forehead makes her look so much like RoboCop I could  not concentrate on her words - just enjoyed the unexpected  similarity.But! I think that Milla is perfectly cast. Of course first of  all she is a model, but do we need a Meryl Streep for the role of young  peasant girl, the messenger, the medium? And the girl is so suitably  androginous yet sexy, great to look at  - since the film is obviously not  &quot;serious&quot; I'd prefer to see Milla in a leading role, not someone  with richer inner life but not-so-perfect body.Besides, she is a fellow  Slav. Any French actress with Gallic calculated charm and sophistication  could not be credible in her fervour.The dialogues are contemporary.  When I saw Joan stopping her adjutant on his way out of her chamber to ask  for a hairdresser I was struck by the realisation that Ms. Jovovich in her  The Ritz suite would communicate with a valet in exacctly the same  tone,with the same gesture.Most of the reasoning and the concepts worded  are clearly does not belong to the Middle Ages.Music is so predictable  you hear just what you expect to hear.And the burning scene is so  abrupt! I did not plan to contemplate the death throes, but to finish the  160-minutes long film in the 2-minute haste...Still I can not call the  movie a complete flop. There are some images - Milla with boyish face  and  man's haircut on her white horse, raising the banner,etc - that will stay  in public consciousness. And I was not bored watching the film.Yes, it  could be much better, but still it's definitely worth seeing. I've even  bought the DVD - to continue my Luc Besson collection - but I hope the next  addition will be more rewarding.",3,"It could be much, much better.",955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,4045,"['Luc', 'Besson', 'now', 'man', 'Midas', 'touch', 'surprised', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'result', 'thing', ""'d"", 'touched', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'gold', 'something', 'less', 'valuable', 'something', 'more', 'copper.I', 'was', 'stunned', 'Nikita', 'one', 'was', 'expecting', 'such', 'cool', 'modern', 'action', 'movie', 'French', 'director', 'Professional', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'kitschy', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'visuals', 'were', 'so', 'exciting', 'one', 'really', 'cared', 'content', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'extravaganza.Now', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'was', 'carried', 'away', 'decided', 'can', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'scrap', 'girlfriend', 'photo', 'be', 'exact', 'see', 'DVD', 'leaflet', 'employs', 'team', 'very', 'skillful', 'cameramen', 'costume', 'designers', 'adequate', 'funding', 'easy', 'most', 'popular', 'French', 'director', 'planning', 'tell', 'story', 'most', 'famous', 'French', 'heroine', 'most', 'handsome', 'French', 'actors', 'Americans', 'experienced', 'pyrotechnic', 'together', 'fabulous', 'fireworks', 'expecting', 'burst', 'sky', 'many-colored', 'have', 'instead', 'Psssshhhhhhhhhick.Why', 'Obviously', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'nothing', 'say', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'had', 'coherent', 'idea', 'express', 'just', 'action', 'design', 'are', '3', 'definite', 'parts', 'film', 'Visions', 'Battle', 'Trial.When', 'one', 'more', 'vision', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'battle', 'begin', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'genre', 'can', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'gory', 'action', 'display', 'curious', 'war', 'machines', 'weaponry', 'armour', 'hour', 'began', 'look', 'too', 'much', '101th', 'time', 'are', 'shown', 'quot', 'True', 'Face', 'War', 'quot', 'recent', 'years', 'crows', 'pecking', 'dead', 'flesh', 'oozing', 'bloody', 'limbs', 'lying', 'are', 'something', 'expect', 'see', 'shocking', 'potential', 'next', 'Trial', 'Nothing', 'memorable', 'here', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'contributed', 'name', 'film', 'posters', 'DVD', 'covers', 'am', 'sure', 'helped', 'sell', 'hundreds', 'thousand', 'tickets', 'copies', 'extra', 'role', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Hoffman', 'gray', 'beard', 'hooded', 'robe', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'best', 'disguise', 'Tootsie', 'sadistic', 'monotone', 'stubbing', 'girl', 'stupid', 'pretentious', 'questions.By', 'way', 'doubt', 'was', 'fashion', 'days', 'Faye', 'shaven', 'forehead', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'RoboCop', 'could', 'not', 'concentrate', 'words', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'unexpected', 'similarity.But', 'think', 'Milla', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'course', 'first', 'model', 'do', 'need', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'role', 'young', 'peasant', 'girl', 'messenger', 'medium', 'girl', 'so', 'suitably', 'androginous', 'yet', 'sexy', 'great', 'look', 'film', 'obviously', 'not', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'see', 'Milla', 'leading', 'role', 'not', 'someone', 'richer', 'inner', 'life', 'not-so-perfect', 'body.Besides', 'fellow', 'Slav', 'Any', 'French', 'actress', 'Gallic', 'calculated', 'charm', 'sophistication', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'credible', 'fervour.The', 'dialogues', 'are', 'contemporary', 'When', 'saw', 'Joan', 'stopping', 'adjutant', 'way', 'chamber', 'ask', 'hairdresser', 'was', 'struck', 'realisation', 'Ms.', 'Jovovich', 'Ritz', 'suite', 'would', 'communicate', 'valet', 'exacctly', 'same', 'tone', 'same', 'gesture.Most', 'reasoning', 'concepts', 'worded', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'belong', 'Middle', 'Ages.Music', 'so', 'predictable', 'hear', 'just', 'what', 'expect', 'hear.And', 'burning', 'scene', 'so', 'abrupt', 'did', 'not', 'plan', 'contemplate', 'death', 'throes', 'finish', '160-minutes', 'long', 'film', '2-minute', 'haste', 'Still', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'movie', 'complete', 'flop', 'are', 'images', 'Milla', 'boyish', 'face', 'man', 'haircut', 'white', 'horse', 'raising', 'banner', 'etc', 'will', 'stay', 'public', 'consciousness', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'watching', 'film.Yes', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'even', 'bought', 'DVD', 'continue', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'collection', 'hope', 'next', 'addition', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'rewarding']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

I had hoped it would portray Joan in an updated version. How wrong I was.For starters, the movie ran just too long.  Movies that are long that people don't mind, such as ""Forrest Gump"" are tolerated because they were good.  This movie was just plain bad.Aside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's ""Conscious,"" it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other.The great disservice this screenplay did was portray Joan as insane rather than having a gift from God.  Only a few ""miracles"" were actually illustrated, such as Joan picking Charles out of a crowd.  Jovovich's portrayal of Joan as a shuddering, twitching mental patient was simply unnerving, not at all enlightening.  Historic reports indicated that Joan was not at all like the movie version -- quite the opposite in fact.This movie is also more graphic than I could bear.  The raping of her sister's corpse was just plain disgusting -- as well as false.  This did not happen and Joan's visions began way before any catastrophe...The Messenger concentrates too much on special effects and the action factor of war.  Joan is dismissed as a saint in this movie and merely portrayed as an insane woman who pretty much got lucky with people listening to her rants.  I have never been so disgusted in my life with a biopic, which is usually what we expect -- a factual version of a historical figure.  My recommendation is to SKIP this... and look up an older version of the movie or check out PBS' website for information on specials of Joan of Arc -- they care more about facts than special effects and shock value...",1,Total disservice to the legend of Joan of Arc,1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,2024,"['Being', 'person', 'who', 'admired', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'history', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'releasal', 'Messenger', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'portray', 'Joan', 'updated', 'version', 'How', 'wrong', 'was.For', 'starters', 'movie', 'ran', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'Movies', 'are', 'long', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'such', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'are', 'tolerated', 'were', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad.Aside', 'fact', 'are', 'fabricated', 'characters', 'such', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Conscious', 'was', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Charles', 'interactions', 'Joan', 'had', 'English', 'were', 'looked', 'order', 'spruce', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'wars', 'just', 'simply', 'concentrated', 'wrong', 'topics', 'story', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'Joan', 'not', 'watch', 'soldiers', 'brutalize', 'other.The', 'great', 'disservice', 'screenplay', 'did', 'was', 'portray', 'Joan', 'insane', 'rather', 'having', 'gift', 'God', 'Only', 'few', 'miracles', 'were', 'actually', 'illustrated', 'such', 'Joan', 'picking', 'Charles', 'crowd', 'Jovovich', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'shuddering', 'twitching', 'mental', 'patient', 'was', 'simply', 'unnerving', 'not', 'enlightening', 'Historic', 'reports', 'indicated', 'Joan', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'version', 'quite', 'opposite', 'fact.This', 'movie', 'also', 'more', 'graphic', 'could', 'bear', 'raping', 'sister', 'corpse', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'disgusting', 'as', 'well', 'false', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Joan', 'visions', 'began', 'way', 'catastrophe', 'Messenger', 'too', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'factor', 'war', 'Joan', 'dismissed', 'saint', 'movie', 'merely', 'portrayed', 'insane', 'woman', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'lucky', 'people', 'listening', 'rants', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'disgusted', 'life', 'biopic', 'usually', 'what', 'expect', 'factual', 'version', 'historical', 'figure', 'recommendation', 'SKIP', 'look', 'up', 'older', 'version', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'PBS', 'website', 'information', 'specials', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'care', 'more', 'facts', 'special', 'effects', 'shock', 'value']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

21551,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,0767839129,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[4, 9]","Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here.

Indecisively I say: Besson does not seem to be able to make his mind up whether Joan is  a superheroine or some crazy mixed up little girl. Although I loved the  flashiness and imagination of the 5th Element, something is definitely  missing in this film.It takes Dustin Hoffman's late (and all to brief)  arrival into the film to start giving it the darkness it deserves. After  all, the story seems to be about rebelleion against tyranny, betrayal and  faith.The period is captured well and the battle scenes capture the gore  and dirt well enough (crows and dogs nibbling at the dead adds another  dimension).The big question is of course Milla Jovovich herself. She  spends most of the movie bewildered. She tries to capture the essence of a  woman possessed but ends up making a brave although lacking attempt. This  kind of role requires a masterful performance to bring out all the nuances.  The same indecision seemed to be behind Malkovitch's acting - I was  expecting a Valmont (although Faye Dunaway did a good job as the wicked  step mother).I did like the overblown English accents and the battle  hardened French generals but after the film I was no more wise as to  whether Joan was the messenger of God or a lunatic possessed.",3,Besson is playing with a dulled sword,961977600,"06 26, 2000",2000,1378,"['story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'mythical', 'quality', 'French', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'French', 'director', 'handles', 'tale', 'Indecisively', 'say', 'Besson', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'mind', 'up', 'Joan', 'superheroine', 'crazy', 'mixed', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'loved', 'flashiness', 'imagination', '5th', 'Element', 'something', 'definitely', 'missing', 'film.It', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'late', 'brief', 'arrival', 'film', 'start', 'giving', 'darkness', 'story', 'be', 'rebelleion', 'tyranny', 'betrayal', 'faith.The', 'period', 'captured', 'well', 'battle', 'capture', 'gore', 'dirt', 'well', 'enough', 'crows', 'dogs', 'nibbling', 'dead', 'dimension', 'big', 'question', 'course', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'most', 'movie', 'bewildered', 'capture', 'essence', 'woman', 'possessed', 'up', 'making', 'brave', 'lacking', 'attempt', 'kind', 'role', 'masterful', 'performance', 'bring', 'out', 'nuances', 'same', 'indecision', 'seemed', 'be', 'Malkovitch', 'acting', 'was', 'expecting', 'Valmont', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'wicked', 'step', 'mother', '.I', 'did', 'overblown', 'English', 'accents', 'battle', 'hardened', 'French', 'generals', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'wise', 'Joan', 'was', 'messenger', 'God', 'lunatic', 'possessed']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

21557,A141HP4LYPWMSR,0767839129,Brian E. Erland,"[30, 45]","Director Luc Besson has blessed us with, how shall I say it, a very different interpretation of the legendary French warrior/saint, Joan of Arc. This Joan is not the confident and serene Joan we have seen in other films, or may have read about in books. Besson's Joan is frenetic and unstable, she rambles on, shakes incessantly, appears often times confused and is subject to unexpected bursts of rage. Not exactly traits that would inspire either religious fervor or courage in battle.As a child Joan is portrayed as a obsessive compulsive loner who goes to confession two or three times a day. A child who hears voices and sees dark, disturbing visions of war, bloodshed and savages beasts feeding on human carnage. No cute, chubby angels or beautiful Madonna's for this kid. A child so obsessed with being with Christ, she sneaks into the church santuary at night, fills the holy chalice with wine and drinks it down reciting, ""I want to be at one with you NOW!"" Seeing that fragile little girl standing before the altar with her face and blouse covered with red wine is not only unnerving but vampiric in effect.This is a savage, sometimes barbaric film that uncompromisingly exposes spirituality and warfare in a manner that most of us are unwilling to accept. Dark, haunting, deeply mystical and overtly shamanic in content, 'The Messenger' is a masterpiece waiting to be understood by those open to new artisitic interpretations and diverse interior vistas within the mystical life and calling of a great saint.Most definitely not a film for those in search of sanitized mainstream inspirational entertainment and definitely not suitable for young children. However if you're ready and curious enough to look deeply into the spiritual abyss you might be able to catch a fleeting glimpse of the terror and horror that awaits on the Otherside.Postscript: Most people with a passing familiarity of the Christian faith have heard the verse exhorting us to work out our faith with ""Fear and Trembling.""

That alone makes this one a classic.3) The movie explores Joan's later doubts about her voices/visions being from God very well. They use a imaginary devil's advocate character (played by Dustin Hoffman) to allow her to argue with herself. In the process, we're given a lot to think about ourselves.Worst:1) Milla Jovovich over-acted at times, especially when the camera was close to her face. That made her character a little scary.

Even in my Western Civ class in college, the Hundred Years War was a bit lacking in material, so I cannot claim to be well versed in Joan of Arc.  However, what I do know about her meshes into the film.  What exactly was she?  Who knows.  Crazy?  Maybe.  A faithful servant of her God?  She thought so.  Are there erreors in the movie?  Most movies do.  Are they a detriment to the film?  I really don't know.The film is well produced.  The actors play their roles well, the battle scenes are fantastic, the atmosphere is outstanding.  I think the movie is the best movie Besson has made, over Leon and La Femme Nikita both.  If Joan was a homely girl, or if some sequence in the battle wasn't quite historically accurate, I don't think it matters.  After all, look at Pearl Harbor.

Since 1337 the land has been ravaged by the Hundred Years War between the English, the French, and fickle barons and dukes willing to shift their loyalties for gold, titles, and land in Perfidious Albion, north of the icy Channel. English soldiers, brigands, and madmen roam the countryside, burning, looting and pillaging everything in their path.It is a time of frenzy; it is a time of ecstatic vision.It is a time in which the messianic Joan la Pucelle, later known to history and fate as Joan of Arc (played in wide-eyed wonder by the gorgeous Milla Jovovich), emerged, born into an ensanguined world and bearing the word of God Himself on her lips to the future King of France, the hapless Dauphin Charles.It is this fiery, faith-driven, brink-of-madness world which Luc Besson attempts to conjure up in the uneven ""The Messenger"", which shares a little of the fevered madness of its wild-eyed heroine.What is the true nature of the Divine? How does He talk to His servants? How do you know the voice of God is really the voice of God---and not something else, something malignant, the voice of a demon or possibly madness? To his credit, Besson plunges deep into this dilemma, and the opening sequences in which Joan's young visions come heralded by unearthly winds and a vision of a glowering, leering (and ultimately aging, decrepit, and senescent) Christ are unsettling and horrible, suggesting that the source of her zeal may not be divine in nature.Besson has always had a flair for visual artistry, and ""The Messenger"" is no exception. The imagery, assisted by veteran cinematographer Thierry Arboghast (who worked with Besson on ""The 5th Element"" and also served as Director of Photography for the lush ""Ridicule), is rich, striking, captures the feel of the 15th century battlefield, and throws the viewer into battlefields and siege trenches fertilized with gore and muddy pastures turned into rancid abattoirs with the blood of the dead.The battle sequences are handsomely mounted, vivid, compelling, and brutal, particularly the Siege of Orleans. A sequence introduced by a shot from a trebuchet (a piece of medieval siege artillery) is at once remarkably faithful and dramatically awe-inspiring.Fashion model Milla Jovovich does a fine job with a challenging role, and makes ""The Messenger"" her movie; her expressive face says more with a glance or a turn of the mouth than lesser actresses could with 100 pages of dialogue.John Malkovich is at his purring, brooding best as the Dauphin; Faye Dunaway brings history to life as the devious Yolande D'Aragon; Tcheky Karyo provides the heavy weapons support and uniformly stolid jawline as the phlegmatic, doubting, faithful Dunois; Vincent Cassel seems to be having the time of his life as the laughing Gilles de Rais; and Dustin Hoffman has a shadowy, skulking, gloriously contemporary little part in tempting, tormenting, and confusing Joan.For all of its pageantry and scope, this is a decidedly intimate little film that has far more to say about the nature of Faith and Things Larger than Oneself than it does, necessarily, about the historically enigmatic and ambiguous St. Joan.This ultimately makes Besson's sins (all those of excess, the very best kind) forgivable, because this final inquisition between Joan and her hooded tormentor makes the film so much more accessible to all us, beset as we are by our fears and doubts.The final question, once all the fire and blood and plunder and ruin of ""The Messenger"" succumb to night and silence, is this: do we hear the voice of God because we finally allow ourselves to listen---or because we so desperately want to hear?JSG",4,The Medium is the Messenger,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,3740,"['Divine', 'Message', 'Hysterical', 'Delusion', '1425', 'France', 'corpse-strewn', 'battlefield', '1337', 'land', 'been', 'ravaged', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'English', 'French', 'fickle', 'barons', 'dukes', 'willing', 'shift', 'loyalties', 'gold', 'titles', 'land', 'Perfidious', 'Albion', 'north', 'icy', 'Channel', 'English', 'soldiers', 'brigands', 'madmen', 'roam', 'countryside', 'burning', 'looting', 'pillaging', 'everything', 'path.It', 'time', 'frenzy', 'time', 'ecstatic', 'vision.It', 'time', 'messianic', 'Joan', 'la', 'Pucelle', 'later', 'known', 'history', 'fate', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'played', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'gorgeous', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'emerged', 'born', 'ensanguined', 'world', 'bearing', 'word', 'God', 'Himself', 'lips', 'future', 'King', 'France', 'hapless', 'Dauphin', 'Charles.It', 'fiery', 'faith-driven', 'brink-of-madness', 'world', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'attempts', 'conjure', 'up', 'uneven', 'Messenger', 'shares', 'little', 'fevered', 'madness', 'wild-eyed', 'heroine.What', 'true', 'nature', 'Divine', 'How', 'talk', 'servants', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'voice', 'God', 'really', 'voice', 'God', '-and', 'not', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'malignant', 'voice', 'demon', 'possibly', 'madness', 'credit', 'Besson', 'deep', 'dilemma', 'opening', 'sequences', 'Joan', 'young', 'visions', 'come', 'heralded', 'unearthly', 'winds', 'vision', 'glowering', 'leering', 'ultimately', 'aging', 'decrepit', 'senescent', 'Christ', 'are', 'unsettling', 'horrible', 'suggesting', 'source', 'zeal', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'divine', 'nature.Besson', 'always', 'had', 'flair', 'visual', 'artistry', 'Messenger', 'exception', 'imagery', 'assisted', 'veteran', 'cinematographer', 'Thierry', 'Arboghast', 'who', 'worked', 'Besson', '5th', 'Element', 'also', 'served', 'Director', 'Photography', 'lush', 'Ridicule', 'rich', 'striking', 'feel', '15th', 'century', 'battlefield', 'viewer', 'battlefields', 'siege', 'trenches', 'fertilized', 'gore', 'muddy', 'pastures', 'turned', 'rancid', 'abattoirs', 'blood', 'dead.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'handsomely', 'mounted', 'vivid', 'compelling', 'brutal', 'particularly', 'Siege', 'Orleans', 'sequence', 'introduced', 'shot', 'trebuchet', 'piece', 'medieval', 'siege', 'artillery', 'once', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'dramatically', 'awe-inspiring.Fashion', 'model', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'fine', 'job', 'challenging', 'role', 'Messenger', 'movie', 'expressive', 'face', 'more', 'glance', 'turn', 'mouth', 'lesser', 'actresses', 'could', '100', 'pages', 'dialogue.John', 'Malkovich', 'purring', 'brooding', 'best', 'Dauphin', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'history', 'life', 'devious', 'Yolande', ""D'Aragon"", 'Tcheky', 'Karyo', 'heavy', 'weapons', 'support', 'uniformly', 'stolid', 'jawline', 'phlegmatic', 'doubting', 'faithful', 'Dunois', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'laughing', 'Gilles', 'Rais', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'shadowy', 'skulking', 'gloriously', 'contemporary', 'little', 'part', 'tempting', 'tormenting', 'confusing', 'Joan.For', 'pageantry', 'scope', 'decidedly', 'intimate', 'little', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'say', 'nature', 'Faith', 'Things', 'Larger', 'Oneself', 'necessarily', 'historically', 'enigmatic', 'ambiguous', 'St.', 'Joan.This', 'ultimately', 'Besson', 'sins', 'excess', 'very', 'best', 'kind', 'forgivable', 'final', 'inquisition', 'Joan', 'hooded', 'tormentor', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'accessible', 'beset', 'are', 'fears', 'doubts.The', 'final', 'question', 'once', 'fire', 'blood', 'plunder', 'ruin', 'Messenger', 'succumb', 'night', 'silence', 'do', 'hear', 'voice', 'God', 'finally', 'allow', 'ourselves', 'listen', '-or', 'so', 'desperately', 'want', 'hear', 'JSG']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS
21571,A2G4MGVWR20OOI,0767839129,D. Brown,"[0, 0]","The Messenger: The Story of Joan Of Arc, was extremely moving. I thought the film portrayed Joan Of Arc as she would have likely been. Her constant compulsion to confess her sins, and her visions of God, seemed realistic. For a late-teen, female, during the Hundred Years War, to have convinced the King of France to give her command of an army, Joan Of Arc must have been as eccentric as Milla Jovovich presented her. Jovovich, and her surrounding cast, did a good job.I think the film's use of Dustin Hoffman as Joan Of Arc's conscience was very well done. I noticed in other reviews, that several people found Hoffman's role to be confusing. I understood clearly what his character represented. He symbolized Joan's conscience, and her process of self examination after being captured.Also, I think the film's battle scenes were well done. The costume and prop work was nice too. The Hundred Years war saw the dawn of some amazing advancements in armor, battle tactics, and weaponry, and The Messenger did a good job in demonstrating that. Many other films from this era show only a handful of men-at-arms, with the remainder of the armies being lightly armored infantry. Finally a film had a majority of it's fighting men in full armor, the way they actually were during the closing years of the Hundred Years War.The only flaw that I found was minor and superficial. I found some of the musical pieces to be a little too modern sounding. I do not like it when period films use modern style music. But I only noticed a couple ballads that bothered me. Other than that, I found no problems.Overall, The Messenger receives four stars.

She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role.To add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting?

21573,A274QHZCDFXV4J,0767839129,Dianelos Georgoudis,"[2, 5]","I liked this movie very much. It works well on many levels:Visually it is stunning - a virtuoso work.The acting is terrific, not in the sense that it carries you away but in the sense that you enjoy watching the  actors. It is a theatrical movie in the best sense of the world. The  beauty, passion and fierceness of Joan just emanates out of Jojovich's face  and voice. The scheming queen played by Dunaway is a joy to behold, as is,  as always, Malcovich playing the prince of uncertain age who will become  the future king of France. Dustin Hoffman, having the unique role of Joan's  conscience, is splendid.I found the movie very humorous and also very  French. Many actors speak with a French accent which I think is a very  clever device. You cannot separate the life of a person from the culture in  which this life evolved and I found the movie reflected well on some of the  special tidbits of the French soul.Now the more difficult question about  how close this movie portrays Joan of Arc. I think the important question  is not how realistic the story is, but rather how true it is. First of all  reality as a person lives it is not reality as realistic movies show it to  be. This movie is full of strange surrealistic events seen through Joan's  eyes and a long and wonderful section at the end visualizes Joan's  thinking: her debating with her own conscience. If you want to understand  or communicate your vision about a person, particularly a person as unique  as Joan of Arc, you cannot stick to historical testimony alone. Certainly,  the director Luc Besson took huge liberties with this movie, showing Joan  from the inside, but I think they were well taken. Having Joan act out of a  revenge motive and casting doubt on the divine origin of her  &quot;voices&quot; may disturb a conservative religious mindset, but is  refreshing and believable at least to me. I want to think that Joan herself  would recognize herself better in this movie than in other supposedly more  historically exacting pictures. Should we ever meet her in the afterlife,  in which she undoubtedly believed in, it will be interesting to know how  she herself will judge all the stories told about her.Joan of Arc may  not have been a saint, but her tragic and short life is as close as reality  can get to a miracle. In that sense Besson's &quot;The Messenger&quot;  tells her story in a masterful way. This is one of the best films I have  seen, and one I have already enjoyed seeing several times.

The entire film has an undercurrent of tension that comes from the weight of the subject matter.  Luc Besson has created a visual masterpiece, sometines looking MTV-ish, but in a manner that makes the period come alive for modern audiences rather than being distracting.Even though the aforementioned battles and action scenes are riveting, the best thing about the fim is the cerebral undercurrent.  Does the Dustin Hoffman character represent the Devil, God, something strictly inside Joan's head, or all three?

I was left  wishing that Joan's visions were shown with more subtlety and respect for  the viewer. Overall, the story is interesting, but its exposition is  heavy-handed.

I land on the very positive side.  This is a fascinating film- gorgeous in its settings and costumes, powerful in its depiction of medieval war, and profound in its exploration of the life of a paradoxical heroine.Milla Jovovich's take on Joan is an intriguing blend of shy farm girl, zealot, religious fanatic, saint, and tormented soul.  There is some interesting casting here: Dustin Hoffmann is appropriately eerie as God/Satan/Joan's conscience/Joan's subconscious; John Malkovich, although perhaps a bit too old (the Dauphin/King was only about 9 years older than Joan), is effectively petulant and ethics-free.  Faye Dunaway looks absolutely horrid, thanks in part to the bizarre attire and hair style of the time, and in part to really, really bad plastic surgery.  A large supporting cast demonstrates the extremes that Joan provoked: loyalty, hatred, fear, and adulation.The criticism for the film's lack of historical accuracy makes me laugh.  Some reviewers fervently deride some of the films events, as if they were witnesses to the historical reality.  These events happened almost 600 years ago.  Much of the ""facts"" about Joan's life come from testimony twenty years after her death, when her family was trying to reverse the guilty verdict.  Joan was already a legend, and the testimony of her reality was certainly already tinged by her fame.If you want a 100 percent historically accurate version of the life of Jehanne Darc, find a time machine and head back to Dom&eacute;remy, France, January 6, 1412 (or thereabouts-the exact year of her birth is not known).

Like the life of Jesus, Joan's life is vague on the printed page, and Hollywood has had a history of its own trying to fill in the gaps.  No two films about her are alike.So I guess it comes down to the viewer's faith, whether Joan was a saint or just a simple peasant girl who inspired a nation.This film presents a more human approach to her story, and whether it is historically truthful is beside the point.

21587,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0767839129,"""flickjunkie""","[53, 67]","This is a rather irreverent and disturbing look at the life of Saint Joan of Arc. The portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity and piety that made the child Joan an attractive character.  However, once Milla Jovovich took over as the teen Joan, she became a  raving lunatic. Clearly, this was no accident. She and director Luc Besson  are husband and wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined  interpretation of Joan.The problem with this portrayal was that Joan was  made to be appear so demented that she lost credibility as a believable  character. Her belief in her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism  than unshakeable faith. Personally, I have no problem with this  interpretation, since I am more apt to believe her voices were the result  of an unbalanced psyche than the voice of God. The problem I have is  believing that anyone, even in the 15th century, would give an army to  someone who is so obviously over the edge. Moreover, it is a stretch to  believe that even the most desperate of simple minded men would follow such  a character into battle.If the portrayal were just a little more  balanced, with moments of piety, sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the  other characters around her might be justified in saying, `Is she divinely  inspired or simply mad?' Only when that question resonates has Joan been  portrayed effectively. In this interpretation there was never any question.  She was clearly a madwoman. It was almost a relief when they finally did  away with her.That being said, I must say that from a technical  standpoint this was a brilliantly directed film. Luc Besson has produced a  compelling visual work of art. The opening scenes of young Joan running  through the fields were exquisite. The battle carnage was authentically  grisly and the action realistic. The costumes were wonderful and the  locations and sets well chosen and well crafted. His camera perspectives  gave great impact to every scene. His imagary of supernatural events was  electrifying. In every regard, other than Joan's character interpretation,  this was an inspired work.Milla Jovovich gave a superb performance as  Joan The Mad. Though I don't agree with the interpretation, I can't imagine  such insanity delivered any more effectively. She really seemed well suited  for a jacket with wrap around sleeves. In every scene she exuded white hot  intensity, especially in the battle scenes. Her performance was truly tour  de force.Faye Dunaway was fabulous as the cunning Yolande D'Aragon. She  was so nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving.John  Malkovich did an excellent job portraying Charles VII, however he was a bit  old for the part. Charles was born in 1403 and met Joan in 1429 at the  tender age of 26. Malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no  less 26.Dustin Hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite  well done. Unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never  really put in context. Was he another of Joan's creations or an actual  being? A little defining dialogue would have helped develop his character  better.This is a fine film with a fatal flaw. If the story is to work,  Joan must be a beloved heroine. In this portrayal, she does not endear  herself to the viewer. Contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting  character. For this reason I rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as  a filmmaking 9 or 10.",3,Brilliant filmmaking with a fatal flaw,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,3457,"['rather', 'irreverent', 'disturbing', 'look', 'life', 'Saint', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'portrayal', 'early', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'giving', 'sincerity', 'piety', 'made', 'child', 'Joan', 'attractive', 'character', 'However', 'once', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'took', 'over', 'teen', 'Joan', 'became', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'Clearly', 'was', 'accident', 'director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'are', 'husband', 'wife', 'obvious', 'combined', 'interpretation', 'Joan.The', 'problem', 'portrayal', 'was', 'Joan', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'appear', 'so', 'demented', 'lost', 'credibility', 'believable', 'character', 'belief', 'voices', 'was', 'depicted', 'more', 'mad', 'fanaticism', 'unshakeable', 'faith', 'Personally', 'have', 'problem', 'interpretation', 'am', 'more', 'apt', 'believe', 'voices', 'were', 'result', 'unbalanced', 'psyche', 'voice', 'God', 'problem', 'have', 'believing', 'anyone', 'even', '15th', 'century', 'would', 'give', 'army', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'obviously', 'edge', 'Moreover', 'stretch', 'believe', 'even', 'most', 'desperate', 'simple', 'minded', 'men', 'would', 'follow', 'character', 'portrayal', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'balanced', 'moments', 'piety', 'sincerity', 'lucidity', 'viewer', 'other', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'justified', 'saying', 'divinely', 'inspired', 'simply', 'mad', 'Only', 'when', 'question', 'Joan', 'been', 'portrayed', 'effectively', 'interpretation', 'was', 'never', 'question', 'was', 'clearly', 'madwoman', 'was', 'almost', 'relief', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'away', 'her.That', 'being', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'film', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'produced', 'compelling', 'visual', 'work', 'art', 'opening', 'scenes', 'young', 'Joan', 'running', 'fields', 'were', 'exquisite', 'battle', 'carnage', 'was', 'authentically', 'grisly', 'action', 'realistic', 'costumes', 'were', 'wonderful', 'locations', 'sets', 'well', 'chosen', 'well', 'crafted', 'camera', 'perspectives', 'gave', 'great', 'impact', 'scene', 'imagary', 'supernatural', 'events', 'was', 'electrifying', 'regard', 'other', 'Joan', 'character', 'interpretation', 'was', 'inspired', 'work.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'gave', 'superb', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Mad', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'interpretation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'such', 'insanity', 'delivered', 'more', 'effectively', 'really', 'seemed', 'well', 'suited', 'jacket', 'wrap', 'sleeves', 'scene', 'exuded', 'white', 'hot', 'intensity', 'especially', 'battle', 'scenes', 'performance', 'was', 'truly', 'tour', 'de', 'force.Faye', 'Dunaway', 'was', 'fabulous', 'cunning', 'Yolande', ""D'Aragon"", 'was', 'so', 'nefarious', 'control', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'conniving.John', 'Malkovich', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Charles', 'VII', 'however', 'was', 'bit', 'old', 'part', 'Charles', 'was', 'born', '1403', 'met', 'Joan', '1429', 'tender', 'age', '26', 'Malkovich', 'trouble', 'passing', '46', 'actual', 'age', 'less', '26.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'minor', 'role', 'conscience', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Unfortunately', 'lost', 'effectiveness', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'put', 'context', 'Was', 'Joan', 'creations', 'actual', 'being', 'little', 'defining', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'develop', 'character', 'better.This', 'fine', 'film', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'story', 'work', 'Joan', 'must', 'be', 'beloved', 'heroine', 'portrayal', 'not', 'endear', 'viewer', 'Contrarily', 'disturbing', 'off-putting', 'character', 'reason', 'rated', '7/10', 'easily', 'qualified', 'filmmaking', '9', '10']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Bresson's direction and pacing are not sure enough for this to be a quality film, but his story of a conflicted, manic Joan nevertheless has appeal. I have often wondered how Saints were in real life. Bresson's Joan is both self-confident and self-effacing.  Her self-confidence wins her fame, but it is her honest examination of conscience, her total self-effacement that ultimately makes her a Saint. Joan loves God passionately; her spirituality is real. She eschews amulets as a false and facile form of spirituality.  But she is still fallen in her humanity (as all saints are) and her motives to serve God are perhaps tinged with pride and, possibly, a desire for revenge. Joan's hunger to 'be confessed' is a touching recognition of her sinfulness.

""The Messenger"" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. ""The Messenger"" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic (and more convincing). Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holier-than-thou manner. The film's topics are interesting (was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?), but the execution is poor.

She may be not the one the Church has told us.  She may not be the one written according to the historical documentary.  But she may be the one she could possibly be.One should not forget Catholicism has been constantly evolving, not to say the least Joan was sainted 500 years after her death by the Church who put her on trial in the English territory, city of Rouen.  Our view on the historical heroine might certainly be evolving too.Joan perhaps was the Messenger.  Joan perhaps was the Maid.  Joan could, certainly, be the Revenger, driven by her own desire to make revenge on the Brits for her sister death. We should remember that we are sometimes the servants (or the maids) of God, sometimes we are just driven by our own internal desires. God knows it certainly well.  One could not become a saint on earth while he/ she struggles, but only after his/ her death.  On the contrary, the Holy Mother Church would not turn away (as the Bishop vividly said in the movie) anyone who repent, who make confession to the Church.Yes, Joan constantly asked for confession.  The concept of confession is very important in the Catholicism and in the path to saint.  Luc Besson couldn't be more accurate in portraying Joan's feverish faith in God:  her confession in the beginning of the movie till the last,  the continuous examination by the Conscience, her absolute confidence in God when she was burned at stake.  That she won battle after battle, that she saved France from the foreigner in the 15th century, that her single-mindedness and devotion to her country are only penalized by her fellow countrymen out of greed, jealousy and power.Luc's sense of black humor and MTV-style of cinematography might not appeal to everyone.

In fact it is in many ways incredibly naive and superficial, even in its desire to look and sound profound. Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang.

And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play.

21603,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0767839129,Jason,"[5, 8]","For such a historical figure, I expected a bit more coming into the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie simply because of the story, the action, and the time-period.  Unfortunately, however, Joan of Arc - the catalyst for legendary events in French history, the end of a war, and the first person anyone thinks of when there is even the slightest mentioning of burning at the stake - really deserves more.First, the positive aspects of this movie probably outweigh the bad.  The scenery, style, and medieval genre is represented well.  The film has a very powerful feel, and properly displays how thoughts, beliefs, and energy can be controlled and swayed by the power of religion.  Such greatness has been accomplished through religion, but this film also shows the gritty realism of widespread death that has been brought about from religious intolerance.The bad, however, is two-fold: acting and influence.Joan of Arc was probably not a hyperventilating, over-reacting, deranged, incompetent military leader.  If I were French I would hate this movie.  It basically paints Joan of Arc as a vindictive, revenge-driven, screaming harpy.  The fact that Milla Jovavich seems to have read an ""Acting for Dummies"" book written by Jim Carey - where facial contortions and eyeball bulging trump conveyance of emotion through acting - definitely didn't help either.Whereas Joan of Arc was tried for heresy, to me the people who made this movie should be charged with something similar.  There is nearly no mention of Joan's military prowess, her benevolence, or her true religious devotion.  The fact that there is almost an insinuation that she was speaking to the devil, rather than Jesus, is almost blasphemous.There's also the character I like to call ""Creepy Jesus"".  It's almost as if everyone involved really wanted to show religion as an ugly part of humanity, the possibility of visions being realistic or divine, or that there is inherent value in religion.  There could not have been a weirder actor chosen for the character of Jesus, and there surely couldn't have been a more negative portrayal of religion.The Messenger covers most of the historical details decent enough, entertains the audience quite well, but it's just painfully obvious that the director was interested in psychoanalysis of Joan, her actions, her visions, and religion in general.",3,An entertaining movie with an unfortunate message,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2369,"['historical', 'figure', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'coming', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'loved', 'movie', 'simply', 'story', 'action', 'time-period', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'catalyst', 'legendary', 'events', 'French', 'history', 'end', 'war', 'first', 'person', 'anyone', 'thinks', 'when', 'even', 'slightest', 'mentioning', 'burning', 'stake', 'really', 'more.First', 'positive', 'aspects', 'movie', 'probably', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'scenery', 'style', 'medieval', 'genre', 'represented', 'well', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'feel', 'properly', 'displays', 'how', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'energy', 'can', 'be', 'controlled', 'swayed', 'power', 'religion', 'Such', 'greatness', 'been', 'accomplished', 'religion', 'film', 'also', 'gritty', 'realism', 'widespread', 'death', 'been', 'brought', 'religious', 'intolerance.The', 'bad', 'however', 'two-fold', 'acting', 'influence.Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'hyperventilating', 'over-reacting', 'deranged', 'incompetent', 'military', 'leader', 'were', 'French', 'would', 'hate', 'movie', 'basically', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'vindictive', 'revenge-driven', 'screaming', 'harpy', 'fact', 'Milla', 'Jovavich', 'have', 'read', 'Acting', 'Dummies', 'book', 'written', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'where', 'facial', 'contortions', 'eyeball', 'bulging', 'trump', 'conveyance', 'emotion', 'acting', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either.Whereas', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'tried', 'heresy', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'charged', 'something', 'similar', 'nearly', 'mention', 'Joan', 'military', 'prowess', 'benevolence', 'true', 'religious', 'devotion', 'fact', 'almost', 'insinuation', 'was', 'speaking', 'devil', 'rather', 'Jesus', 'almost', 'also', 'character', 'like', 'call', 'Creepy', 'Jesus', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'really', 'wanted', 'show', 'religion', 'ugly', 'part', 'humanity', 'possibility', 'visions', 'being', 'realistic', 'divine', 'inherent', 'value', 'religion', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'weirder', 'actor', 'chosen', 'character', 'Jesus', 'there', 'surely', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'negative', 'portrayal', 'religion.The', 'Messenger', 'most', 'historical', 'details', 'decent', 'enough', 'audience', 'quite', 'well', 'just', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'director', 'was', 'interested', 'psychoanalysis', 'Joan', 'actions', 'visions', 'religion', 'general']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

The city of Orleans was the limit of what was left of the French Kingdom. The dauphin (prince)Charles was waiting for a miracle in order to reconquer his father's kingdom. He was supported by Yolande of Aragon, his mother in law(supremely played by Faye Dunaway) who pretty much managed to keep what was left of France together.The movie is visually stunning, the costumes and locations are utterly fantastic and accurate. MiLLa Jovovich plays the passionate young peasent girl who claims to be sent by god to fight the English in order to crown the dauphin as Charles VII at Reims cathedral.Some people claim her acting was exagerated and well over the top, but how could a simple peasent woman make herself noticed and obeyed in a time when women were considered to be souless and second class human beings? yes, Joan had to scream, yell and act like a fanatic in order  to be heard. Otherwise she would have been morally crushed by all the sceptic army men around her.This is also very historically accurate and well researched,inspite of a few elements (Joan did know how to sign her own name for instance) Everything, including some of her own words is reproduced on screen.""Better today than tomorow"" was said by Joan many, many times.This film doesn't seek to give the audience a determined opinion of Joan. We don't know whether she is crazy or not.The way she acted makes us doubt if the voices she claimed to have heard were actually God's. The truth is that she ""brought back the fire in the French army""  to quote Yolande of Aragon, and she crowned the dauphin as Charles the VII.

While Mila Jovich, or however you spell her last name, is an AWESOME actress, (she was in ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" and all three ""Resident Evil"" movies) I'm sure that this portrayal of Joan is very inaccurate. In this movie she is portrayed as a screaming, annoying and lunatic b****!! What the hell was the director thinking? He or she clearly did NOT do thier homework. I have seen the 1999 miniseries of ""Joan of Arc"" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the ""Joan of Arc"" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in ""The Messenger"" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries ""Joan of Arc"" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake. And I believe that ""Joan of Arc"" is as accurate as any film could possibly get about the ""the flower of France.""",1,"""JOAN OF ARC"" THE MINISERIES IS WAY BETTER",1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,1894,"['agree', 'most', 'reviews', 'Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Mila', 'Jovich', 'however', 'spell', 'last', 'name', 'AWESOME', 'actress', 'was', 'Return', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'three', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'very', 'inaccurate', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'screaming', 'annoying', 'lunatic', 'b****', 'What', 'hell', 'was', 'director', 'thinking', 'clearly', 'did', 'NOT', 'do', 'thier', 'homework', 'have', 'seen', '1999', 'miniseries', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'starring', 'beuatiful', 'young', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'Leele', 'Sobieski', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Glass', 'House', 'Sobieski', 'Joan', 'innocent', 'brave', 'nineteen-year-old', 'who', 'fought', 'freedom', 'France', 'who', 'sought', 'have', 'French', 'King', 'crowned', 'argue', 'miniseries', 'not', 'entierly', 'accurate', 'again', 'what', 'movie', 'now-a-days', 'still', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'film', 'herione', 'way', 'world', 'miniseries', 'truely', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'dramatic', 'sad', 'big', 'budget', 'version', 'Joan', 'Messenger', 'so', 'twisted', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'impression', 'Joan', 'really', 'was', 'holy', 'point', 'hearing', 'voices', 'saints', 'calling', 'rather', 'Joan', 'simply', 'crazy', 'dillusional', 'anyone', 'comprehension', 'director', 'producers', 'intentionally', 'portrayed', 'Joan', 'mad', 'woman', 'disperate', 'need', 'making', 'known', 'world', 'yet', 'director', 'miniseries', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'stated', 'research', 'even', 'books', 'movie', 'Joan', 'was', 'portrayed', 'sweet', 'loving', 'giving', 'character', 'who', 'strong', 'faith', 'God', 'led', 'ultimate', 'demise', 'SHE', 'choose', 'go', 'flame', 'rather', 'was', 'forced', 'burn', 'stake', 'believe', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'as', 'accurate', 'film', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'flower', 'France']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

I cannot comment on the historical religious facts - however, I was moved by Joan of Arc's passion to pursue her vision(s) from God to reclaim the Kings crown to France (From England).Throughout her life, Joan of Arc was haunted by ""visions from God"" that lead her to believe that she had the religious power to force Englands Army to surrender territory in France rather than face the rath of God.  Mila Jovovich does a spectacular job at playing an unbelievable role of a young lady leading a powerful army.Dustin Hoffman is introduced as her conscience in the later half of the movie - and is haunting!

The dauphin was played admirably as a young bumbling king. Almost all the French Kings of history were buffoons save a few.But what makes this movie stand out is the terribly violent battle scenes. In an age before gunpowder, the imagination used for weapons was truly astonishing. The 'bowling balls' that were dropped and shot out of the castle was something I had never heard of before.

Not much can be known about the true Joan of Arc, but it is known that she supposedly found a sword in a field and used the cause of God to attack the British and try and save her fellow French.  And, just so people know, where do you think the &quot;F&quot; word got its start??  It was back in the middle ages, and thus the evil English like to use it a few times.  But, I'd hardly say its overused.  I counted no more than half a dozen uses of the word, myself, and there is little other swearing in the movie.  Other than that, this movie got 'R' for its very violent and thematically tense content.  This is not a movie for the weak or stomach or heart.  It's take on the reasons for Joan's crusade is displayed perfectly and while this movie doesn't offer any solid view of its own on how her life really happened, it gives us a good idea of what it was like.

I have never seen a review of a movie that evoked so much deeply felt emotion both pro and con, but mostly con, and, to such depth of feeling. It is truly inspiring.Hundreds of reviewers were so moved by what Luc Besson, via Milla Jovovich did in creating this piece of interpretive entertainment that they could not control their rants till all of their feelings, both religious and intellectual were revealed.If movies can be art and art is a means of challenging the intellect then this movie obviously is a success regardless of what, or perhaps even because of what the critics have said.As for me, I am a huge fan of Luc Besson and now, after The 5th Element and The Messenger, Milla Jovovich as well.Only Stanley Kubrick, to my knowledge, has a body of work with such diverse and excellent examples of his vision revealed through film.I loved the Messenger, but perhaps for reasons that many didn't or couldn't, which is to say, I didn't take it as a literal biography of Jeanne D'arc. It seemed clear when it was named The Messenger and not ""The Life and Death of Joan Of Arc"". But, perhaps that's just me.I thought Milla's performance rivaled and reminded me of the young Ingrid Bergman, (For Whom the Bell Tolls). I go so far to say that I was surprised when she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for her work. Seriously.I suspect and hope that M. Besson will continue to challenge and entertain us for many years to come.  I further suspect that Milla will continue to be a talented actress that is unfortunately relegated to rolls of the super-heroine of the ultra-violent films that she has succeeded with so well.  I hope to see her in more rolls that reveal her talent in more benign but revealing characters.

21615,A1HS4595P8TLG8,0767839129,JPS,"[2, 3]","This film has a rather original - and perhaps not always convincing - take on the character of Joan of Arc, played here by Milla Jovovich as being somewhat shrill, or even hysterical at times. One reviewer wondered whethe she was really a Saint inspired by God (but then why would God necessarily take the French's side?) or whether she was ""plain bonkers"". Luc Besson, often original - regardless of whether tou likeor not what he does (and a lot of people tend to not like it - seems to have gone for some mix of the two.This tends to somewhat summarize LUc Besson, his style, and this film in particular. It is spectacular all the way, from the battle scenes - as gory and ""realistic"" as you might expect - to Jeanne's ""voices"", pictured as if in some kind of fantasy or even a horror film. You like it very much or you dislike it just as intensily, or, you like perhaps some of it - the battle scenes are rather good, although they may perhaps feel a bit ""overdone"" -(and ""over gory"" in particlar), but then this is about personal preferences and since none of us were actually there, it's rather difficult to objectively appreciate whether scene A or scene B is ""realistic"" or not.Now, to what extent is this film historically accurate? Here also, reviewers have tended to go to extremes. In fact, the film is generally more accurate than the average film we are used to watching, whether Troy, Brave Heart, Gladiator, Robin Hood (both the older version with Kevin Costner and the one with Russell Crowe), Kingdom of Heaven. However, everything is definitly NOT historical. The Director has taken a number of liberties, as Directors always tend to do. For instance, the beginning of the film, where the farm of Joan of Arc's parents is attacked and her sister gets into trouble, to put it mildly, is one of these inventions. Is it a howler? Not necessarily, unless who require each and every of your films that take place in Antiquity or during the Middle Ages to be as historical accurate as possible, but in such a case, there are hardly any that you will really like. On the other hand, there are also a lot of cases where Luc Besson has stuck to the historical record as much as possible.After the ways in which the ""wicked English"" were rather mistreated in both Brave Heart and the Patriot (Mel Gibson in both cases, I'm afraid), some reviewers have been wondering whether, yet again, the English were being somewhat portrayed and caricatured as ""the baddies"", and were somewhat annoyed at it. In particular, some may have wondered whether depicting the English as insulting Joan and treating her as if she was a witch while also behaving as what could be seens as a cowardly manner, was not tainted with some unpleasant undertones of rench nationalism. This is, of course, a film done by a French Director, something than could fuel such a suspicion until one remembers how superstitious people were in the 15th century and on both sides (and how superstitious most of them were well before and well after). A young and (supposedly) inexperienced maiden leading to war seasoned warriors was simply unheard of at the time. That she was successful and brought victory a couple of times at Orl&eacute;ans, where the six months old English siege was finally broken, and went on to win a convincing victory at Patay and to escort the Dauphin to be crowne in Reims with her army, could only be a tremendous boost to the flaging morale of the French, who were clearly losing the war before her arrival, and, on the contrary, make the English wonder if the she was not Heavenly inspired, since all her enterprises seemed to be successful.Besides, for those who might still doubt and wonder whether the Director is being biased, it is possible to check through the sources. Jeanne, regardlss of whether she was ""inspired"" or not, clearly presented a HUGE problem for the English Kingdom of France and the Duke of Bedford in particular, simply because some, in both camps, could believe that she was inspired by God, and therefore successful. This is alo why some much effort was put in by the English, once she was captured by their Burgundian allies, into having her handig over to them. The English could not afford to have her ransomed by the French because she had become a symbol. Moreover, they needed to destroy this potent symbol, hence her trial for witchcraft and her execution in Rouen.The most interesting question of all is, of course, whether she really was ""inspired"" or not. The French Dauphin (an excellent John Malkovitch) and, even more so, his stately and scheming mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (an excellent Faye Dunaway) certainly chose to believe so, and it clearly suited their interests. The Catholic Church made her into a Saint, but only in 1920. The French have made her into a national heron and she is now one of the symbols of the Far Right nationalist party in France. Interestingly, some revisionist French historians - but not Luc Besson who did not take this kind of risk - have wondered about who she was exactly and whether she really was ""divinely inspired"" or not. The starting point here is that it is highly unlikely for this young teen-ager to have really been a little sheperd girl for at least three reasons. She knew how ro ride. She wore armour and seems to have also known how to fight. She also has no problems in making herself understood at Court once she arried at Bourges, at a time where country folk in France spoke a wide range of dialects and languages - as opposed to Court French.From there, you can start imagining all sorts of conspiracy theories, one of them being that she might have been a bastard half-sister of the Dauphin soon to become Charles VII and that thewhole thing was set up by Yolande of Aragon who knew of her existence and might even have been in charge for her upbringing.Finally, another strong point in this film is the cast of characters. Some have liked Mila's performance. Others have hated it while still others have excused her by saying she was just doing what she was told and that is why she sounds and often appears shrill and hysterical. Granted, she was not, at the time at least, the best or the most professional actor you could think of but she coul have done a lot worse. Other actors are probably much better in their roles, such as Vincent Cassel playing a yound Gilles the Rais or Tcheky Karyo in the role of Dunois, commander-in-chief of the Fenech army and the bastard son of the Duke of Orleans (and therefore the cousin of Charles, future Charles VII). The other actors playing the French captains are rather good also, in particular La Hire, historically known for always swearing and who, to avoid being told of by the young girl, did a huge effort not to swear when she was around, or Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, or the duke of Alenon. These hard and seasoned captains all somehow deferred to Jeanne, however grudgindly, and this is also rather surprising and interesting coming from them. All had much more experience than her. Some were even royal kins. Most behaved more like mercenaries, or at least warlords, happy to kill, burn, loot and rape, but their all obeyed her commands, at least to a certain extent. In itself, this is yet another hint that there was something extremely unsual with Joan of Arc, whatever version you chose to believe.So, at he end of this long review, and despite its limitations - I should have also mentioned the piece where Joan wrestles with her conscious played by Dustin Hoffman as being possibly the worst of the whole film - I believe this very entertaining and spectacular film, which is also more conventional that it may look and feel, is just about worth (a slightly generous) four stars.",4,"Original and spectacular, up to a point",1339891200,"06 17,

It provides a plausible explanation to the ""Joan miracle"", much better than the readily accepted one.No one in this movie is a heroes, a saint, or, for that matter, a devil. Everyone is self-serving in his/her own way and behaving just like a human being. Joan was driven by her single-minded hatred for the English and her wish to drive away the invaders. The French crown prince just wanted his crown. The English wanted Joan convicted as a heretic so as to nullify the claim that ""god is on their side"". The church wanted to stay out of it because it wanted look aloof and impartial to all Christians, French as well as English. It has nothing to gain in engaging in religious controversy.Joan was a charismatic leader because of her single-mindedness and her conviction of a greater purpose. This is a quality people cluster to in a time of turmoil. Think of the Hitlers of our world. It is only human to have doubts, but we are charmed by people who don't. There is a fine line between charm and insanity.The movie is roughly divided into two parts: the first part about the fighting is gritty and realistic, no heroism, just plain and brutal. The second part deals with the question of faith. Had Joan been firm to her believe, no one could accuse her of anything. Her claims of miracle was as legitimate as that of any saints in history. Her incrimination was only possible when she began to doubt herself. Dustin Hoffman was her conscience and self-doubt.Ask yourself this question: if there is a god, why would he take the side of the French? The English king came from a line of Normand aristocrat and has as much claim to the French throne the French crown prince. Why would god take sides in any human conflict at all?

The English get most of the blame in the end, as the church  Inquisitors try to exonerate her but in the end declaring her to be a  martyr for the English.In comparison, the video Joan of Arc played by  Leelee Sobieski has a much better and believable plot than this one.

The apparent point of this movie is to depict Joan as completely insane and no real saint.  So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was ""added"" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.One must wonder what kind of corruption is behind this completely soiled and devaluing version of the story of Joan of Arc and this disgraceful depiction of Jesus.",1,May St. Joan forgive Besson if she can,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1308,"['version', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'complete', 'utter', 'disgrace', 'apparent', 'point', 'movie', 'depict', 'Joan', 'completely', 'insane', 'real', 'saint', 'So', 'insane', 'fact', 'character', 'Joan', 'was', 'completely', 'unable', 'have', 'normal', 'conversation', 'anyone', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'even', 'smidgen', 'respect', 'closest', 'thing', 'respect', 'would', 'be', 'amusement', 'fruits', 'insanity', 'have', 'one', 'way', 'One', 'away', 'feeling', 'not', 'single', 'worthwhile', 'human', 'value', 'was', 'place', 'story', 'traumatized', 'visibly', 'very', 'insane', 'woman', 'inducted', 'elite', 'time', 'useful', 'fool', 'then', 'completely', 'discarded', 'time', 'need', 'literally', 'saving', 'France', 'restoring', 'crown', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Jesus', 'was', 'depicted', 'demonic', 'hideous', 'bulging', 'eyes', 'looking', 'was', 'drag', 'covered', 'blood', 'frightful', 'brutal', 'murder-rape', 'was', 'added', 'story', 'make', 'known', 'Joan', 'was', 'not', 'speaking', 'saints', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'severely', 'traumatized', 'very', 'immediately', 'visibly', 'mentally', 'ill', 'person', 'who', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'own', 'death', 'appease', 'delusions.One', 'must', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'corruption', 'completely', 'soiled', 'devaluing', 'version', 'story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'disgraceful', 'depiction', 'Jesus']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

It is a rather long movie, but that is to be expected considering who the movie is about.The year is 1420.  The English and the French are vying for control over France, with the French being at their lowest point yet; the heir apparent (the Dauphin) is bankrupt, the French are divided and some factions support the English side, militarily they are on the defensive and are losing, while Paris, Orleans, Reims and other cities of importance are in the hands of the English.  It is at this critical moment of desperation and vulnerability that Joan of Arc appears to rally the French behind her banner and the ""Word of God,"" in an effort to send the English ""back to their island.""Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!  The only setback is in relation to the parts where she, yet again, finds herself trembling/twitching/hurting/screaming etc.  Have mercy on us please... Can we have a movie with Milla Jovovich not acting like that (i.e. EXACTLY as she does in the Fifth Element, and in the two Resident Evil movies)?  Is that too much too ask???  It gets so tiring after a while!!!Needless to say, John Malkovich, Vincent Cassel, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.The movie is action packed, while the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the battle sequences are all excellent.There is a wonderful feel of History; the clash between the English and the French is as fascinating as the conflicts between the different French factions, and both are presented very well in the film.History, Battles, Swordfights, and Intrigue, are all about.The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!On the negative side, the film is rather biased against the English portraying them as overly evil, while the French are presented much more favourably and with a stronger sense of honor (even having a better sense of humor).In a nutshell, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.

I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.Some things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity.

(i don't do this [giving stars] since now) i've changed my opinion to this movie. There is someone who has their own belief and way to do things they think they can and must do. All other powerful people doubt and try to stop her but also expect her to do something different, useful and helpful. So it's really a hard work. I don't know why LucBesson think maybe a woman can do this work well, in this circomstances she have to pay high price at last. Maybe He's found a man has always two selves and both are strong. When the second(or actully the first) self let a woman getting pregnant, he's let himself get in troble, he can not just live with the sea and dolphins anymore. Other people maybe are just other people but your child is a part of you and if you choose not to care them, you will get guilty. So to a man other people have the ability to increase his sin. But to a woman, if she's lucky enough if she doesn't need to do things for her country if she's not living in India and some places, she has a chance to be and develop herself all the time. And she can choose to love God. In all places i ever saw God is a He. It's a good news for a woman. The best thing is &quot;he&quot; doesn't tempt you to increase your sin, so he's perfect and good for you. When we can just be ourselves we get some kind of power gradually. We can help ourselves and try to help other people. But we have to be modest to God, otherwise we will loss our powers. I basically like Milla Jovovich and her acting here very much, but it looks sometimes she wants some second level things from God and other people and forgets she deserves (always of course) the first level things, maybe she doesn't feel he is God but feel he is DH sometimes. We know what LB wants to express and it's enough. In The Fifth Element she's just born and now she has her belief and ability, but, still, it's a very difficult road if she don't have BW to help her.

What child would not be terorized by such an event! Heck I was terrified,  and felt the same feelings. Who wouldn't? Comrade? English didn't say those kinds of terms in the 15th century. It was another time. Call it another dimension. It was told she had special training from St Catherine. I told you its far out there.The horror of war...2. The film making was so surreal it puts you right into the battles like nobody else could ever do. She even had visions  of Jesus and her after they retook the Tourelles saying 'what are you doing to me Joan'..and she was horrified about that.

An amazing bit of history for the English. Maybe the most embarrassing.Joan finally understood that faith in God will move those mountains at Patay and no killing needed to be done.And there you shall see the miracle I was sent to make.OOOHHHH I loved every minute.3.

21635,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,0767839129,Marc Cabir Davis,"[8, 12]","One of the greatest motion pictures of all time.Luc Besson achieved directorial greatness more than once, but this film is the peak of his creative vision and success. Casting Ukrainian supermodel Milla Jovovich was a controversial idea at the time, but Besson managed to extract a nuanced performance from her - a feat, considering she is in virtually every frame of this 3-hour epic. To me, this is the greatest `war hero' film ever made - yes, even better than ""Braveheart"", ""Alexander"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"". In fact, the superiority of this motion picture far eclipses the achievements garnered by those films.People often forget that Joan of Arc is one legendary hero about whom there exists indisputable historical evidence, in form of her court deposition (try to find the transcripts online). Even as a teenager she was remarkably mature and well-spoken for her age, and even if God did or not speak to her, her intelligence and political acumen at that young age is quite impressive.The movie is awash in bright colors - the opening shots of the child Jean skipping down her childhood hills of Orleans are quite simply, stunning. Equally enthralling are her visions of `Jesus on the throne' as well as the extended sequence ten minutes into the film where Jean is chased by a pack of wolves, culminating in her discovery of the entire village being torched. If there is one downside to the film, it is that it depicts the English as overly boorish and immoral, while the French are noticeably better looking and far more civilized. Whether this is historically accurate or not, I do not know, but the portrayals of these two sects are quite distracting.At centerstage is Milla Jovovich. This woman was never a great actress. In fact, I knew her more through her musical work (check out her solo album from 1994 ""The Divine Comedy"") than her movie roles. But despite her current success with the Resident Evil series, its obvious that Milla gave this film her all - lending her role with such an aura of vulnerability and authenticity that she virtually becomes Jean through the course of the film.I also liked this movie due to its' non-dependence on fact, and its reliance upon various schools of thought. For example, the question of whether God told Jean to lead France to victory is never totally justified. In fact, her `conscience' (played towards the end of the film by Dustin Hoffman) does a fine job in ripping up Jean's ego and exposing her as a scheming egomaniac who had her own self-esteem issues to address, rather than any form of probably divinity. Again, this is alluded to, not stated as fact. In doing so, Besson opens new doors of possible thinking for the audience, and the director presents these alternate realities before us with rare tenderness that has often escaped in the past.Standout scenes include Jean's trial. Milla's gradual transformation of Jean from a passionate female warrior to a helpless peasant girl behind bars is done in spectacular fashion. In real life, Jean was raped repeatedly by her guards and often appeared at her court trials bleeding and totally disoriented due to her abuse. The film isn't quite so graphic in its' exploration, but it does speak of the various issues she faced behind bars. Of equal importance is how France completely sold her out, and how the country she so fondly fought for, couldn't care less about her execution.The last ten minutes of the film are the most poignant, as Jean is offered to lower her principles so that she can escape being burnt at the stake as a heretic. Milla brings such an award-worthy performance to the table here as her mind, her conscience and her rapidly deteriorating sense of self lead her to make some very forced and confused decisions and by the time politics intervenes and finally hands her the most twisted judgement, its evident that Jean has suffered both a moral and spiritual breakdown. The final scene, of Jean gazing at a cross while being burnt alive, answers the most burning question posed by modern theology - will God be present at the time of your death? The movie does not address this, but again, presents it to us as an issue to think about.I think the most fascinating thing about this film is that Jean of Arc was a real person, and about 60% of what she faced in real life is not even mentioned in the movie. Jean's parents, for example were totally involved in her life until the very end, but in the movie they do not make an appearance anywhere in her adult life.There are few films in which everything just WORKS - and this is a prime example of it. It has long been on my Top 10 list of All Time Greatest Films, and it's a pity to see that in this day and age, it still hasn't developed the cult fan following it so obviously deserves. A superb slice of American technology meeting European Cinematography, ""The Messenger"" is a towering achievement that remains actress Milla Jovovich's most inspired work to date. Personally I thought she deserved the Oscar for this, as she holds our attention most rivetingly for three hours, but that's art for you.Highly Recommended.

21638,AST7UNIXVOAVA,0767839129,Mark Shanks,"[0, 0]","NOW what? For the life of me, I can't imagine why Besson thought that the world needed (yet) another Joan of Arc movie. The &quot;real&quot; Joan wasn't even considered important in France until the 1800's, when her story  was resurrected (and embellished - current scholarship doubts whether  Orleans was actually under siege at all!) But (sigh), he decided to give it  his *treatment*, and this is what we end up with: two and a half hours of  his wife (and &quot;Leeloo&quot; from &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;)  alternately screaming, shrieking, or whimpering in the face of anyone who  happens to be standing by. The scrolling text at the opening of the film  was illegible and flipped by so quickly no one could read it, not that it  seemed to matter. Any &quot;plot&quot; is sublimated to the &quot;art&quot;  - gorgeous photography, lush scenery, and realistically violent battle  scenes. Warning - this is serious stuff, not a candied-up rendition of  medieval warfare. Back in those days, you took out your enemy not by  gunfire, but by debilitating them in as serious fashion as possible,  including maces, axes, the ubiquitous swords, and some even less pleasant  and graphically-demonstrated methods. But along the way, Besson loses  whatever guiding vision originally prompted him to make this film.  Characters start to answer questions with &quot;Whatever&quot;, the  Dauphine (John Malkovich playing the usual invertebrate) seems less  interested in being King than he is in where the cast party will be, Faye  Dunaway snaps and snarls in a puzzling way (one minute she's Joan's biggest  patron, only to turn on her with no discernable motivation), and in one of  the BIGGEST casting bloopers in the last half of the 20th century, Dustin  Hoffman shows up looking like a retread Obi Wan Kenobe, sounding like  Dustin Hoffman, and is supposed to be &quot;The Conscience&quot;  (apparently because the gaping plot holes required SOME sort of cinematic  asphalt to keep the audience at least partially &quot;in&quot; on what is  supposed to be transpiring). This is certainly the most serious problem  with the movie: if Hoffman is intended to be a sort of mental foil ,  voicing Joan's inner doubts, he certainly takes his time in making his  presence known. If the movie is intended to illuminate Joan's  &quot;human&quot; aspects (as opposed to her spiritual side), then  three-quarters of the film is wasted on one battle scene after another with  nary a glimmer of self-doubt or moral questioning. Buckets of blood, to be  sure.No, this isn't the &quot;thinking man's Joan&quot; by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see &quot;whatever&quot;),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current &quot;significant other&quot;  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.",2,Fatally flawed - Leeloo meets Joan,955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,3193,"['NOW', 'what', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'Besson', 'thought', 'world', 'needed', 'yet', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'movie', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Joan', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'considered', 'important', 'France', '1800', 'when', 'story', 'was', 'resurrected', 'embellished', 'current', 'scholarship', 'doubts', 'Orleans', 'was', 'actually', 'siege', 'sigh', 'decided', 'give', '*treatment*', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'wife', 'quot', 'Leeloo', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'quot', 'alternately', 'screaming', 'shrieking', 'whimpering', 'face', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'standing', 'scrolling', 'text', 'opening', 'film', 'was', 'illegible', 'flipped', 'so', 'quickly', 'one', 'could', 'read', 'not', 'seemed', 'matter', 'Any', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'sublimated', 'quot', 'quot', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'lush', 'scenery', 'realistically', 'violent', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Warning', 'serious', 'stuff', 'not', 'candied-up', 'rendition', 'medieval', 'warfare', 'Back', 'days', 'took', 'out', 'enemy', 'not', 'gunfire', 'debilitating', 'as', 'serious', 'fashion', 'possible', 'including', 'maces', 'axes', 'ubiquitous', 'swords', 'even', 'less', 'pleasant', 'graphically-demonstrated', 'methods', 'way', 'Besson', 'guiding', 'vision', 'originally', 'prompted', 'make', 'film', 'Characters', 'start', 'answer', 'questions', 'quot', 'Whatever', 'quot', 'Dauphine', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'usual', 'invertebrate', 'less', 'interested', 'being', 'King', 'where', 'cast', 'party', 'will', 'be', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'snaps', 'snarls', 'puzzling', 'way', 'one', 'minute', 'Joan', 'biggest', 'patron', 'only', 'turn', 'discernable', 'motivation', 'one', 'BIGGEST', 'casting', 'bloopers', 'last', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'up', 'looking', 'retread', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Kenobe', 'sounding', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'Conscience', 'quot', 'apparently', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'required', 'SOME', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'asphalt', 'keep', 'audience', 'least', 'partially', 'quot', 'quot', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'transpiring', 'certainly', 'most', 'serious', 'problem', 'movie', 'Hoffman', 'intended', 'be', 'sort', 'mental', 'foil', 'voicing', 'Joan', 'inner', 'doubts', 'certainly', 'time', 'making', 'presence', 'known', 'movie', 'intended', 'illuminate', 'Joan', 'quot', 'human', 'quot', 'aspects', 'opposed', 'spiritual', 'side', 'then', 'three-quarters', 'film', 'wasted', 'one', 'battle', 'scene', 'glimmer', 'self-doubt', 'moral', 'questioning', 'Buckets', 'blood', 'be', 'sure.No', ""n't"", 'quot', 'thinking', 'man', 'Joan', 'quot', 'looooong', 'shot', 'film', 'irritatingly', 'anachronistic', 'see', 'quot', 'quot', 'crippled', 'hopelessly', 'befuddled', 'motivations', 'seriously', 'one-dimensional', 'acting', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'lead', 'case', 'being', 'director', 'current', 'quot', 'significant', 'other', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'Besson', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'cinematography', 'hyper-kinetic', 'pacing', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'taste', 'subtlety', 'serious', 'philosophic', 'enquiries', 'even', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'will', 'find', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'length', 'hour', 'too', 'long']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS
21639,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,0767839129,Mat,"[6, 8]","(...)The story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.Luc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.Milla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.The battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.Beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a revisioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.What we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.(...)",1,A Beautiful Mess,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3661,"['story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Jeanne', ""d'Arc"", 'call', 'France', 'well', 'known', 'just', 'everywhere', 'Joan', 'poor', 'peasant', 'living', 'small', 'village', 'France', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'England', 'seeing', 'heavenly', 'visions', 'tell', 'God', 'messenger', 'rid', 'country', 'bloody', 'English', 'Somehow', 'Charles', 'Dauphin', 'visions', 'being', 'king', 'give', 'army', 'storm', 'Orleans', 'Using', 'unconventional', 'methods', 'army', 'victory', 'Dauphin', 'crowned', 'king', 'mostly', 'forgets', 'Joan', 'unsuccessful', 'siege', 'Paris', 'given', 'English', 'tried', 'burned', 'stake', 'several', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'sainted', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Messenger', 'most', 'relatively', 'faithfully', 'beautifully.Luc', 'Besson', 'talented', 'director', 'filming', 'such', 'classics', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Professional', 'talent', 'presented', 'here', 'ability', 'create', 'interesting', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'lost', 'creating', 'cohesive', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'story', 'young', 'saint', 'parts', 'earnest', 'recreation', 'revolutionary', 'heavenly', 'visions', 'then', 'parody', 'ends', 'sinks', 'reinventing', 'events', 'asking', 'Joan', 'not', 'visions', 'were', 'real', 'mere', 'psychosis.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'pretty', 'face', 'who', 'mostly', 'been', 'forgettable', 'silly', 'comedies', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'franchise', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'considered', 'silly', 'comedy', 'worth', 'Here', 'two', 'modes', 'acting', 'strange', 'amphetamine', 'delivery', 'lines', 'could', ""n't"", 'spit', 'out', 'fast', 'enough', 'snarled', 'scream', 'acting', 'was', 'merely', 'being', 'loudest', 'person', 'set', 'not', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'entirety', 'film', 'completely', 'place.The', 'battle', 'Orleans', 'tame', 'best', 'are', 'virtually', 'scenes', 'real', 'ambitious', 'spectacle', 'are', 'given', 'nothing', 'inform', 'revolutionary', 'forms', 'combat', 'Instead', 'method', 'be', 'screaming', 'lot', 'jumping', 'horse', 'enemies', 'fence', 'Later', 'storming', 'Paris', 'so', 'humorous', 'sad', 'Joan', 'screams', 'screams', 'back', 'up', 'few', 'soldiers', 'randomly', 'knock', 'must', 'be', 'Paris', 'gates', 'soldiers', 'are', 'so', 'bewildered', 'pathetic', 'looking', 'seem', 'more', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sketch', 'serious', 'film', 'war.Beyond', 'visual', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'Conscience', 'fine', 'performance', 'fine', 'actor', 'peculiar', 'character', 'time', 'questioning', 'Joan', 'own', 'sanity', 'Could', 'visions', 'fact', 'be', 'form', 'psychosis', 'fantasy', 'Could', 'crucial', 'moments', 'life', 'finding', 'sword', 'field', 'fact', 'be', 'simple', 'coincidence', 'Good', 'questions', 'history', 'real', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'seem', 'place', 'here', 'Nowhere', 'film', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Joan', 'nothing', 'real', 'thing', 'Why', 'bring', 'questions', 'play', 'climactic', 'ending', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'believing', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'Joan', 'purpose', 'vision', 'questioning', 'visions', 'beginning', 'revisioning', 'myth', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'Instead', 'legs', 'out', 'bringing', 'question', 'so', 'late', 'film.What', 'get', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'pretty', 'visuals', 'find', 'performance', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Try', 'renting', 'one', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'earlier', 'films', 'pick', 'up', 'anything', 'Hoffman', 'hey', 'day', '70', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'dollar', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'anything', 'thing', 'be', 'found', 'here.']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS
21640,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767839129,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc is at times brilliant and at other times chaotic. In a few scenes it is brilliant and chaotic at the same time. How can this be, you ask? It's because it was made by the brilliant but messy French director, Luc Besson. Besson did two of my favorite pop culture movies, La femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. I admired both of these for the same reasons. Both are high-tech, fast-paced visualizations of absurd stories. They are triumphs of style over substance. Nikita is about a young female criminal who is coerced by the French equivalent of the CIA into becoming an assassin. The Fifth Element is a bizarre science fiction story set in the future. In it, Bruce Willis, aided by a truly weird alien girl, must keep the evilest force in the universe from destroying the human race. I think the reason that Messenger is a weaker film is that Besson's unique style does not work well when he deals with a story set six hundred years in the past.You would think that this filming of the Joan of Arc story would be great because this is a French film with several American stars in the cast. [Don't panic! It's in English.] But, beyond Besson's limitations are the limitations of the story itself, which is shrouded in mystery. In the early 15th Century, a young French peasant girl named Joan had visions that she claimed told her she was to lead an Army that would free her people from English rule. The army was raised by the dauphin, the English retreated, and the dauphin became Charles VII, King of France. Afterwards, Joan's reward was to be tried as a heretic and then burned at the stake. This much seems to be accepted by historians. Whether or not Joan actually lead the army is hotly debated. Who actually tried Joan is also not known for sure. Some think it was the English, others think it was the Catholic church. We do not even know the exact nature of the charges against her. We cannot say for sure what events caused the poor girl to go from heroine to martyr. She was basically forgotten about until the 19th Century, when her story was used as a political tool to advance the cause of French nationalism. Five hundred years after her death, the Church declared her to be a Saint.I tell you all this history because it is my opinion that a satisfactory movie about her will never be made, because it is impossible to tell the story in a way that will please everyone. That leaves us to deal with the successes and failures of The Messenger on a purely cinematic basis. Its strong points include its visual richness. The feel of the period is lovingly rendered. The script adroitly sidesteps the issue of Joan's visions. While it does not deny that her messages may have come from God, it also suggests the possibility that she was simply delusional. It concludes that, whatever the source of her messages, the savageness of her trial made even her doubt her sources.One of the movie's weaknesses lays in casting Milla Jovovich as Joan. I have admired her work in other films, but, like the director, she is not the right choice for a historical epic. The biggest mistake, however, was made in choosing to show in detail several gruesome battles. These occupy perhaps a third of the movie's two and one half hours running time. They become redundant and detract from the more interesting story of Joan - her childhood, her visions, her dealing with royal powers, her interactions with the all-male troops, and her eventual and tragic fall from grace. The result is that Messenger is an interesting movie, but hardly a great one.",3,Focus on battle scenes undermines story of Joan,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3580,"['Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'times', 'brilliant', 'other', 'times', 'chaotic', 'few', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'chaotic', 'same', 'time', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'ask', 'was', 'made', 'brilliant', 'messy', 'French', 'director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Besson', 'did', 'two', 'favorite', 'pop', 'culture', 'movies', 'La', 'Nikita', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'admired', 'same', 'reasons', 'are', 'high-tech', 'fast-paced', 'visualizations', 'absurd', 'stories', 'are', 'triumphs', 'style', 'substance', 'Nikita', 'young', 'female', 'criminal', 'who', 'coerced', 'French', 'equivalent', 'CIA', 'becoming', 'assassin', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'bizarre', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'set', 'future', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'aided', 'truly', 'weird', 'alien', 'girl', 'must', 'keep', 'evilest', 'force', 'universe', 'destroying', 'human', 'race', 'think', 'reason', 'Messenger', 'weaker', 'film', 'Besson', 'unique', 'style', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'when', 'story', 'set', 'six', 'hundred', 'years', 'past.You', 'would', 'think', 'filming', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'French', 'film', 'several', 'American', 'stars', 'cast', '[', 'Do', ""n't"", 'panic', 'English', ']', 'Besson', 'limitations', 'are', 'limitations', 'story', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'early', '15th', 'Century', 'young', 'French', 'peasant', 'girl', 'named', 'Joan', 'had', 'visions', 'claimed', 'told', 'was', 'lead', 'Army', 'would', 'free', 'people', 'English', 'rule', 'army', 'was', 'raised', 'dauphin', 'English', 'retreated', 'dauphin', 'became', 'Charles', 'VII', 'King', 'France', 'Afterwards', 'Joan', 'reward', 'was', 'be', 'tried', 'heretic', 'then', 'burned', 'stake', 'much', 'be', 'accepted', 'historians', 'Whether', 'not', 'Joan', 'actually', 'lead', 'army', 'hotly', 'debated', 'Who', 'actually', 'tried', 'Joan', 'also', 'not', 'known', 'sure', 'think', 'was', 'English', 'others', 'think', 'was', 'Catholic', 'church', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'exact', 'nature', 'charges', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'sure', 'what', 'events', 'caused', 'poor', 'girl', 'go', 'heroine', 'martyr', 'was', 'basically', 'forgotten', '19th', 'Century', 'when', 'story', 'was', 'used', 'political', 'tool', 'advance', 'cause', 'French', 'nationalism', 'Five', 'hundred', 'years', 'death', 'Church', 'declared', 'be', 'Saint.I', 'tell', 'history', 'opinion', 'satisfactory', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'impossible', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'will', 'please', 'everyone', 'deal', 'successes', 'failures', 'Messenger', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'basis', 'strong', 'points', 'include', 'visual', 'richness', 'feel', 'period', 'lovingly', 'rendered', 'script', 'adroitly', 'issue', 'Joan', 'visions', 'not', 'deny', 'messages', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'God', 'also', 'possibility', 'was', 'simply', 'delusional', 'whatever', 'source', 'messages', 'savageness', 'trial', 'made', 'even', 'doubt', 'sources.One', 'movie', 'weaknesses', 'casting', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Joan', 'have', 'admired', 'work', 'other', 'films', 'director', 'not', 'right', 'choice', 'historical', 'epic', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'however', 'was', 'made', 'choosing', 'show', 'detail', 'several', 'gruesome', 'battles', 'occupy', 'perhaps', 'third', 'movie', 'two', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'become', 'redundant', 'detract', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'Joan', 'childhood', 'visions', 'dealing', 'royal', 'powers', 'interactions', 'all-male', 'troops', 'eventual', 'tragic', 'fall', 'grace', 'result', 'Messenger', 'interesting', 'movie', 'hardly', 'great', 'one']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS
21641,A2EXDP1BBSAFQ6,0767839129,Matthew Watters,"[2, 3]","The Messenger is currently airing on cable TV, and I will confess to being so amused and intrigued by the chunks of Luc Besson's big bellyflop that I was seeing in Cinemax's edited and cropped version that I went out and bought the DVD in order to give this film a proper second look. A decade ago, following the fantastic one-two punch of Leon and The Fifth Element, Besson suddenly seemed like the greatest popular moviemaker in the world. So, back then, I went to see The Messenger with sky-high expectations that were only bound to be disappointed. At the time, the movie seemed not only a pointless retelling of a story that has been filmed countless times but, worse yet, a mere star vehicle for Besson's then-girlfriend Milla Jovovich.Ten years later, during which Besson, sadly, has been unable to recapture his earlier promise, but during which Jovovich has actually proven her chops as an actress sans Besson, The Messenger really does deserve to be reconsidered. It turns out to be a smartly-mounted, crisply-edited medieval war movie, more entertaining than Braveheart and others in this genre, and its light, humourous style actually seems prescient in terms of some of the less reverent historical epics that have been produced since. John Malkovich, who, back then, just seemed old and miscast as the Dauphin of France, now somehow seems spot on, a most knowing parody of his own egotistical image, and Jovovich, despite her technical limitations, is full of energy and fire and, as always, looks fantastic. There are even amusing echoes of Besson's more seminal work, with the story bearing striking similarities to that of The Fifth Element (beautiful girl suffused with a higher power saves medieval France instead of the world) and Tcheky Karyo providing a bemused sort of Leon to Jovovich's Mathilda on steroids. Besson's Joan of Arc may not be a candidate for cinematic canonisation, but it's a terrific movie that never deserved to be burned at the stake.",4,Better late than never,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,1977,"['Messenger', 'currently', 'airing', 'cable', 'TV', 'will', 'confess', 'being', 'so', 'amused', 'intrigued', 'chunks', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'big', 'bellyflop', 'was', 'seeing', 'Cinemax', 'edited', 'cropped', 'version', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'order', 'give', 'film', 'proper', 'second', 'look', 'decade', 'ago', 'following', 'fantastic', 'one-two', 'punch', 'Leon', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Besson', 'suddenly', 'seemed', 'greatest', 'popular', 'moviemaker', 'world', 'back', 'then', 'went', 'see', 'Messenger', 'sky-high', 'expectations', 'were', 'only', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'time', 'movie', 'seemed', 'not', 'only', 'pointless', 'retelling', 'story', 'been', 'filmed', 'countless', 'times', 'worse', 'yet', 'mere', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Besson', 'then-girlfriend', 'Milla', 'Jovovich.Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Besson', 'sadly', 'been', 'unable', 'recapture', 'earlier', 'promise', 'Jovovich', 'actually', 'proven', 'chops', 'actress', 'sans', 'Besson', 'Messenger', 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'reconsidered', 'out', 'be', 'smartly-mounted', 'crisply-edited', 'medieval', 'war', 'movie', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Braveheart', 'others', 'genre', 'light', 'humourous', 'style', 'actually', 'prescient', 'terms', 'less', 'reverent', 'historical', 'epics', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'back', 'then', 'just', 'seemed', 'old', 'miscast', 'Dauphin', 'France', 'now', 'somehow', 'spot', 'most', 'knowing', 'parody', 'own', 'egotistical', 'image', 'Jovovich', 'technical', 'limitations', 'full', 'energy', 'fire', 'always', 'fantastic', 'are', 'even', 'amusing', 'echoes', 'Besson', 'more', 'seminal', 'work', 'story', 'bearing', 'striking', 'similarities', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'suffused', 'higher', 'power', 'saves', 'medieval', 'France', 'instead', 'world', 'Tcheky', 'Karyo', 'providing', 'bemused', 'sort', 'Leon', 'Jovovich', 'Mathilda', 'steroids', 'Besson', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'candidate', 'cinematic', 'canonisation', 'terrific', 'movie', 'never', 'deserved', 'be', 'burned', 'stake']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

There are many version of her story, starting with Melies' ""Jeanne d'Arc"" (1899) imagine, almost from the cradle of cinema; going thru Drayer's expressionist ""La Passion de Jean d'Arc"" featuring the unforgettable Maria Falconetti (1928) and Victor Fleming's ""Joan of Arc"" with a very solid Ingrid Bergman's interpretation of The Maiden (1948).Each version focuses in different aspects of this historical drama. Some are more mystic, some as in the present movie, more inclined to a psychological explanation.Director Luc Besson has a short but very interesting filmography. We may note ""Nikita"" (1990) and ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) as his high points.He also co-authored the screenplay and co-produced this movie giving it his very personal view point. He tries to depict a Joan of Arc as a girl shocked and haunted by the dreadful scene of the rape and murder of her sister, which evolves into a young woman driven by her visions. If this ""visions"" are God sent or produced by her own mind, is left to the viewer to decide.The movie is divided in three parts: Joan's child experiences, Joan fulfilling her Mission and Joan subject to judgment by her enemies.Battles against the English invaders are very well enacted. Realistic and accurate stand at the same height as ""Braveheart""'s (1995), but distinctly different.The cast includes many first rate actress and actors such as Dustin Hoffman as The Conscience, John Malcovich as Charles VII, Faye Dunaway as Yolande d'Aragon, and Richard Ridings as La Hire. Notwithstanding the best performances are given by Milla Jovovich fleshing a believable and sensitive Joan and Vincent Cassel as the tragic Gilles de Rais.A very good historical based film, even if opinionated on the subject.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,The Maiden Rides Again!,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,1840,"['Jeanne', ""d'Arc"", 'Joan', 'Arc', 'stirred', 'imagination', 'score', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'many', 'version', 'story', 'starting', 'Melies', 'Jeanne', ""d'Arc"", '1899', 'imagine', 'almost', 'cradle', 'cinema', 'going', 'Drayer', 'expressionist', 'La', 'Passion', 'Jean', ""d'Arc"", 'featuring', 'unforgettable', 'Maria', 'Falconetti', '1928', 'Victor', 'Fleming', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'very', 'solid', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'interpretation', 'Maiden', '1948', '.Each', 'version', 'focuses', 'different', 'aspects', 'historical', 'drama', 'are', 'more', 'mystic', 'present', 'movie', 'more', 'inclined', 'psychological', 'explanation.Director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'short', 'very', 'interesting', 'filmography', 'may', 'note', 'Nikita', '1990', 'Fifth', 'Element', '1997', 'high', 'points.He', 'also', 'co-authored', 'screenplay', 'co-produced', 'movie', 'giving', 'very', 'personal', 'view', 'point', 'depict', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'girl', 'shocked', 'haunted', 'dreadful', 'scene', 'rape', 'murder', 'sister', 'young', 'woman', 'driven', 'visions', 'visions', 'are', 'God', 'sent', 'produced', 'own', 'mind', 'left', 'viewer', 'decide.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'three', 'parts', 'Joan', 'child', 'experiences', 'Joan', 'fulfilling', 'Mission', 'Joan', 'subject', 'judgment', 'enemies.Battles', 'English', 'invaders', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'enacted', 'Realistic', 'accurate', 'stand', 'same', 'height', 'Braveheart', '1995', 'distinctly', 'different.The', 'cast', 'many', 'first', 'rate', 'actress', 'actors', 'such', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Conscience', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'Charles', 'VII', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Yolande', ""d'Aragon"", 'Richard', 'Ridings', 'La', 'Hire', 'Notwithstanding', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'fleshing', 'believable', 'sensitive', 'Joan', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'tragic', 'Gilles', 'de', 'Rais.A', 'very', 'good', 'historical', 'based', 'film', 'even', 'opinionated', 'subject.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Sadly the movie is highly inaccurate to the story about the young French warrior maiden who saved her country. They start off with her childhood (might I add she was 13 when she first heard her voices, not 7 or 8 like the movie seems to think) where she watches the murder and rape of her sister. Joan did have a sister, a younger sister not one who was between the ages 16-18. While I think that Milla Jovovich is a tallented actress she wasn't right for the role in this movie, she made Joan of Arc seem like a lunatic. To make things worse her voices seem very satanic.

21647,A228JH8V9Y700G,0767839129,MortensOrchid,"[3, 4]","The story of Joan of Arc is a myth and legend beyond religious belief and war stories, it is a true triumph of the human spirit.  Anything you set your mind to can be accomplished no matter how strange or outlandish it may be.  And Joan did it, to be glorified for all eternity for her bravery.  This movie came under some flack for some overdramatics and a bit of choppy story flow, but it fleshed out Joan for who she really was and how she was used as well as abused by the higher powers of heaven and earth.Milla Jovovich plays Joan, a simple, illiterate peasent girl who came from a farming town in Lorrain, France out of no where.  In this movie, often ignored by other biographies or cinematic undertakings, we see how she was affected by the toils of war when her sister is murdered by English soldiers.  We also see how with a child's innocence she loves God and wants nothing but to find joy within going to mass and prayer.  Perhaps it is because of these reasons that she has her first visions as a young girl, innocent of the outside world and looking to the church for answers.  At age 19, she leaves her hometown to see the Daulphaine of France, played with the dignity and hauting ability that only John Malcovich can portray.  She seeks an audience with him to tell him that she has been chosen by God to lead his army against the English in the 100 Years War and see him rightly crowned as the King of France.It has often been debated why it was that Charles believed Joan, and this movie offers some insights to more practical reasons rather than a true miracle.  Heavily influenced by his mother in law, played with kind of a creepy, witchlike appeal by Faye Dunaway, Charles has always doubted himself.  There was always a question about his lineage and his right to rule.  There was also a myth about a maid from Lorrain that was sent by God to lead France into victory.  She says it is what simple people believe; and, what the simple people believe is what will give him strength and power.  Also, according to myth and legend, when Joan was presented in the court to Charles, he had an impostor sit upon his throne.  If the maid Joan was truly of God, then she would pick him out of a crowd as the true Dauphaine.  Sure enough, Joan chooses correctly.  Joan and Charles would retreat into another room for a private conversation that only the two of them would witness.  Charles would emerge, according to witnesses, excited and amazed.  Did Joan perform a miracle?  Rather, Joan reassures him that she believed enough in him that he should be the true king of France.  Joan is given her army, and they would march onto victory.The tide quickly turns for Joan after Charles is crowned.  The church as well as the crown are fearful of the power Joan has over the people and her inflating ego.  What would she attempt next?  They begin to clamp down on her, and as her next war attempts would result in a disasterous failure, she is jailed and found guilty of being a heratic.  Joan is burned at the stake for her crimes.  Some say that her heart, as it was pure, did not burn.  Hundreds of years later, she was canonized as a saint.What is the morale of the story?  There are hundreds if not thousands of morales.  Perhaps the most telling of situations is when Joan, in her final days behind bars, is confronted by Dustin Hoffman, her own doubts.  He asks her what her sins have been and how she got into this place.  Her sins were pride and vanity.  Maybe she didn't really hear the voice of God.  Maybe she was just a nutcase who happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Maybe she was the fall guy for a botched military movement, a weak king, or a patriarchal society.  Whatever the reason, Joan was a hero.",4,Joan ...,1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,3748,"['story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'myth', 'legend', 'religious', 'belief', 'war', 'stories', 'true', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'Anything', 'set', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'matter', 'how', 'strange', 'outlandish', 'may', 'be', 'Joan', 'did', 'be', 'glorified', 'eternity', 'bravery', 'movie', 'came', 'flack', 'overdramatics', 'bit', 'choppy', 'story', 'flow', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Joan', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'abused', 'higher', 'powers', 'heaven', 'earth.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Joan', 'simple', 'illiterate', 'peasent', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'farming', 'town', 'Lorrain', 'France', 'where', 'movie', 'often', 'ignored', 'other', 'biographies', 'cinematic', 'undertakings', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'affected', 'toils', 'war', 'when', 'sister', 'murdered', 'English', 'soldiers', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'child', 'innocence', 'God', 'nothing', 'find', 'joy', 'going', 'mass', 'prayer', 'Perhaps', 'reasons', 'first', 'visions', 'young', 'girl', 'innocent', 'outside', 'world', 'looking', 'church', 'answers', 'age', '19', 'hometown', 'see', 'Daulphaine', 'France', 'played', 'dignity', 'hauting', 'ability', 'only', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'can', 'portray', 'audience', 'tell', 'been', 'chosen', 'God', 'lead', 'army', 'English', '100', 'Years', 'War', 'see', 'rightly', 'crowned', 'King', 'France.It', 'often', 'been', 'debated', 'why', 'was', 'Charles', 'believed', 'Joan', 'movie', 'insights', 'more', 'practical', 'reasons', 'rather', 'true', 'miracle', 'Heavily', 'influenced', 'mother', 'law', 'played', 'kind', 'creepy', 'appeal', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Charles', 'always', 'doubted', 'was', 'always', 'question', 'lineage', 'right', 'rule', 'was', 'also', 'myth', 'maid', 'Lorrain', 'was', 'sent', 'God', 'lead', 'France', 'victory', 'what', 'simple', 'people', 'believe', 'what', 'simple', 'people', 'believe', 'what', 'will', 'give', 'strength', 'power', 'Also', 'according', 'myth', 'legend', 'when', 'Joan', 'was', 'presented', 'court', 'Charles', 'had', 'impostor', 'sit', 'throne', 'maid', 'Joan', 'was', 'truly', 'God', 'then', 'would', 'pick', 'crowd', 'true', 'Dauphaine', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Joan', 'correctly', 'Joan', 'Charles', 'would', 'retreat', 'room', 'private', 'conversation', 'only', 'two', 'would', 'witness', 'Charles', 'would', 'emerge', 'according', 'witnesses', 'excited', 'amazed', 'Did', 'Joan', 'perform', 'miracle', 'Rather', 'Joan', 'believed', 'enough', 'should', 'be', 'true', 'king', 'France', 'Joan', 'given', 'army', 'would', 'march', 'victory.The', 'tide', 'quickly', 'Joan', 'Charles', 'crowned', 'church', 'as', 'well', 'crown', 'are', 'fearful', 'power', 'Joan', 'over', 'people', 'inflating', 'ego', 'What', 'would', 'attempt', 'next', 'begin', 'clamp', 'down', 'next', 'war', 'attempts', 'would', 'result', 'disasterous', 'failure', 'jailed', 'found', 'guilty', 'being', 'heratic', 'Joan', 'burned', 'stake', 'crimes', 'say', 'heart', 'was', 'pure', 'did', 'not', 'burn', 'Hundreds', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'canonized', 'saint.What', 'morale', 'story', 'are', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'morales', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'telling', 'situations', 'when', 'Joan', 'final', 'days', 'bars', 'confronted', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'own', 'doubts', 'what', 'sins', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'got', 'place', 'sins', 'were', 'pride', 'vanity', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'voice', 'God', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'nutcase', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fall', 'guy', 'botched', 'military', 'movement', 'weak', 'king', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'reason', 'Joan', 'was', 'hero']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS
21648,A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,0767839129,Mr. A. Pomeroy,"[6, 8]","Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise.

Maybe she was a feminist in an age of male domination who decided to use God as a ladder to French Royalty. All  interesting possiblities. All completely ignored by this film. I doubt that  even Luc Besson could explain what he thought of Joan of Arc and he doesn't  even try to here. Depite battle sequences that are almost on par with those  of Braveheart, a terrifc cast giving superb performances, and stunning  visuals the film falls completely flat . I would've prefered it if the film  had nothing good in it. It would have been easier to dismiss, but the  presence of such great elements makes the whole that much more of a  disappointment. Milla Jovovich gives her all in the lead role, Malkcovich  is as usual terrific as the sly back stabbing king, Faye Dunaway wreaks of  menace despite being underused. Then we come to Dustin Hoffman as The  Conscience, who I think is Besson's attempt at redeaming himself. After  roaming through the first half of the film, giving us battle sequence after  another, dream sequence after another, all which look magnifecent, but by  the third time you see them you start wondering if he is going anywhere  with this, he doesn't. The Conscience is his feeble attempt at  understanding Joan, but it comes too late, and by then we are not so much  interested in understanding her, as much as we are hoping that the film  would end. By the time the film is over you'll be thinking to yourself,  what a waste of lots of great elements in this completely pointless mess.

Lots of silly,  fictitious stuff was added about the various people at court who supposedly  convinced Charles to betray Joan.

And after seeing this movie I don't feel like I know that much more. Actually some bells are ringing in the back of my head, indicating  that some of the elements aren't historically correct. Well, so some  liberties have been taken in the storytelling, but I was still entertained,  and that is usually the point in seeing a movie by Luc Besson.This  version of the story of the famous warrior saint (or was she just crazy?)  is definitely the most colourful one ever made. Milla Jovovich generally  does a good job playing the part of Joan. Sometimes she's absolutely  brilliant, but other times the performance is not that convincing. I take  it that this is because of her having to work with Besson right after their  divorce. But speculations aside, the movie still turned out pretty great.  Generally the acting is quite superb, and the visuals are gorgeous,  something which has become a trademark of Besson. But like other  postmodernistic directors, he seems to focus more on the packaging than the  content. The script never really goes in-depth with the internal struggle  of Joan of Arc, and might be more suited for a regular action movie.Still the visuals and the acting make the film worthwhile, but if you  want to see a historically accurate version of the legend, steer well clear  of this.As it is, this can best be described as &quot;Joan of Arc Light:  the film that tastes sweet, but won't make your intellect fatter.&quot;",4,Joan of Arc becomes action movie star...,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,1529,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'what', 'learned', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'school', 'seeing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'Actually', 'bells', 'are', 'ringing', 'back', 'head', 'indicating', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'historically', 'correct', 'Well', 'so', 'liberties', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'storytelling', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'usually', 'point', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Luc', 'Besson.This', 'version', 'story', 'famous', 'warrior', 'saint', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'definitely', 'most', 'colourful', 'one', 'ever', 'made', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'generally', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'part', 'Joan', 'Sometimes', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'other', 'times', 'performance', 'not', 'convincing', 'take', 'having', 'work', 'Besson', 'right', 'divorce', 'speculations', 'aside', 'movie', 'still', 'turned', 'out', 'pretty', 'great', 'Generally', 'acting', 'quite', 'superb', 'visuals', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'something', 'become', 'trademark', 'Besson', 'other', 'postmodernistic', 'directors', 'focus', 'more', 'packaging', 'content', 'script', 'never', 'really', 'in-depth', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'suited', 'regular', 'action', 'movie.Still', 'visuals', 'acting', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'want', 'see', 'historically', 'accurate', 'version', 'legend', 'steer', 'well', 'clear', 'this.As', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Light', 'film', 'sweet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'intellect', 'fatter.', 'quot']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Although he presented an original angle in showing her to be less than heavenly inspired, Besson has seriously and uneffectively distorted several documented facts about Joan of Arc. This is rendered worse by a bad script and questionable acting.All historical accounts suggest that Joan of Arc was soberly persistent in her pleas for the Dauphin to give her an army but she was never the delusional psychotic as shown in the movie. Her visions were inspired by the Saints and not by Christ Himself. All accounts are conclusive in that Joan of Arc was leading as a symbol of inspiration to the army and never once raised a weapon against the enemy: she never shed any blood. Finally, Joan of Arc never reneged her faith or retracted her statements about her divine mission: that's why she was put on the stake.The film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.  The battle and siege scenes are interesting but perhaps a little exaggerated.The movie is perhaps worth renting once but this is certainly not the best rendition on this most intriguing of Christian saints/martyrs.",2,A Novel Attempt Ruined by A Poor Screenplay and Bad Acting,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,1619,"['Besson', 'film', 'legendary', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'mixed', 'results', 'presented', 'original', 'angle', 'showing', 'be', 'less', 'heavenly', 'inspired', 'Besson', 'seriously', 'uneffectively', 'distorted', 'several', 'documented', 'facts', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'rendered', 'worse', 'bad', 'script', 'questionable', 'acting.All', 'historical', 'accounts', 'suggest', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'soberly', 'persistent', 'pleas', 'Dauphin', 'give', 'army', 'was', 'never', 'delusional', 'psychotic', 'shown', 'movie', 'visions', 'were', 'inspired', 'Saints', 'not', 'Christ', 'Himself', 'accounts', 'are', 'conclusive', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'leading', 'symbol', 'inspiration', 'army', 'never', 'once', 'raised', 'weapon', 'enemy', 'never', 'shed', 'blood', 'Finally', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'never', 'reneged', 'faith', 'retracted', 'statements', 'divine', 'mission', 'why', 'was', 'put', 'stake.The', 'film', 'unique', 'showing', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'more', 'political', 'puppet', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'became', 'liability', 'crowning', 'Dauphin', 'Orleans', 'film', 'also', 'Joan', 'person', 'suffering', 'dissociative', 'disorder', 'rather', 'being', 'divine', 'messenger', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'play', 'roles', 'well', 'Dauphin', 'Regent', 'Queen', 'Mila', 'Jojovich', 'worst', 'performance', 'film', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'quality', 'whole', 'film', 'reduced', 'average', 'battle', 'siege', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'little', 'exaggerated.The', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'worth', 'renting', 'once', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'rendition', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Christian', 'saints/martyrs']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Almost everyone in the (fabulous) cast - even John Malkovich - has one. But alas the hair styles are about the only source of genuine cheer; almost everything else is a let-down.Malkovich had a peach of a part as the dastardly, conniving Dauphin, but played it amazingly straight, with nary a hint of the cheeky chappie the role was crying out for. What would Alan Rickman have made of it, I wonder. Or even Bruce Willis?He certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves).The gratuitous violence is a serious blight on the film; the murder/rape scene was arguably relevant to the plot but still was depicted with more detail and relish than necessary, and the remainder of the film overflows with dogs, wolves and crows gobbling human carrion and more battlefield amputations and decapitations than probability would dictate. I'm sure these earned the film its 18 restriction when, fundamentally, it could have quite easily avoided them.But for all the above, I think the main problem with this film is Luc Besson himself. The early stages are laden with meaningless cliches - wolves streaming through the forest, girl running through meadows - and laboured imagery (crucifix, fire, dripping blood and a combination thereof) which get the film off to a bad start from which it never recovers.And thereafter Besson unwisely tries to have a bob each way. On one hand, he takes the historically faithful/dramatised documentary angle - this is really how it happened, you see - but on the other he plays the dreamy, psychedelic/quasi-spiritual card at the same time. Which isn't how it happened, at all.Most peculiar were Joan's visions of Jesus. It really isn't clear what we are meant to take from these: Did Joan really see visions of Jesus (as a boy and - heavily made up with eye-shadow, a beard and a toga - apparently as a member of Slade), or was she simply a paranoid schizophrenic, not in need of an army to march on the British so much as Professional Help?Besson doesn't answer this fundamental question, and the introduction of Dustin Hoffman at the end of the film, seemingly imbued with magical powers, really doesn't help. I still don't know what Hoffman was meant to do in the film or who he was. Was he Jesus? Was he Joan's conscience? Or just more evidence that she really was nuts?

21660,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0767839129,Only-A-Child,"[1, 3]","If you are wondering about Luc Besson's vaguely heretical ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", try to imagine a cross between ""Excalibur"" and ""Heaven's Gate"". It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess.There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems.Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor.Although there are records of both of Joan's trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation.What hurts ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in ""Leon"". This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history.  And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.But once Milla Jovovich's grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see ""The Dummy"") rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama.But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences.Then again, what do I know?

Joan of Arc was a hard and somewhat fanatical Christian, but in no way was she the blithering idiot that Jojovich's acting makes her out to be. There is also a scene of &quot;self-examination&quot; during Joan's captivity with the Burgundians that serves little point other than to stress the idea that Joan is absolutely nuts. Indeed, all the Damsel of Orleans does through half the movie is to claw and hyperventilate... truly a shameful performance, and abysmal script-writing.If you want a GOOD film about Joan of arc, check out the Criterion Collection and look up Carl Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, don't waste your time with this Hollywood-produced piece of glitz, filth and shallowness.",1,Abysmal doesn't even cover it.,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2223,"['unsightly', 'contribution', 'Milla', 'Jojovich', 'career', 'quite', 'well', 'aside', 'looking', 'breathless', 'panting', 'screaming', 'actress', 'can', 'not', 'tackle', 'serious', 'acting', 'challenge.A', 'true', 'mockery', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'film', 'make', 'Poucelle', ""D'Orleans"", 'seem', 'deranged', 'woman', 'incapable', 'controlling', 'army', 'historical', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'showed', 'eerie', 'capacity', 'military', 'manoeuvres', 'fame', 'became', 'widespread', 'entire', 'cities', 'surrendered', 'mention', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'gates.Through', 'dictated', 'letters', 'was', 'presumably', 'illiterate', 'recorded', 'answers', 'Inquistion', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'born', 'Domremy', 'was', 'unusually', 'lucid', '16-year-old', 'was', 'burned', 'stake', 'age', '19', 'gift', 'words', 'may', 'give', 'credibility', 'was', 'actually', 'related', 'Dauphin', 'bloodline', 'Anne', 'Adultress', 'thus', 'must', 'have', 'received', 'degree', 'education', 'as', 'well', 'sharing', 'distinction', 'being', 'middle', 'age', 'most', 'distinguished', 'transvestite', 'sharing', 'same', 'historical', 'period', 'Basque', 'transvestite', 'noblewoman', 'Catalina', 'de', 'Erauzo', 'Lieutenant', 'Nun', '.Milla', 'Jojovich', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'insulting', 'anyone', 'ever', 'studied', 'remarkable', 'character', 'giving', 'instead', 'histrionic', 'half-mad', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'composture', 'second', 'who', 'apparently', 'resolution', 'twig', 'fueled', 'battle', 'unknown', 'fervors', 'vanish', 'as', 'soon', 'battle', 'scene', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'was', 'hard', 'somewhat', 'fanatical', 'Christian', 'way', 'was', 'blithering', 'idiot', 'Jojovich', 'acting', 'out', 'be', 'also', 'scene', 'quot', 'self-examination', 'quot', 'Joan', 'captivity', 'Burgundians', 'little', 'point', 'other', 'stress', 'idea', 'Joan', 'absolutely', 'nuts', 'Indeed', 'Damsel', 'Orleans', 'movie', 'claw', 'hyperventilate', 'truly', 'shameful', 'performance', 'abysmal', 'script-writing.If', 'want', 'GOOD', 'film', 'Joan', 'arc', 'check', 'out', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'look', 'up', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'Hollywood-produced', 'piece', 'glitz', 'filth', 'shallowness']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Do we believe religious zeal and fervor, and willingness to believe in divine spiritualism?  Or, do we believe the pragmatic conclusions offered by Hoffman?Constantly we are shot by the bullets of doubt throughout the film.  Joan is suspiciously fervent and ardent-and simultaneously inclined to be both wrathful and forgiving.  She becomes God--her will is misinterpreted, even by herself.

21676,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0767839129,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson's `The Messenger: The  Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile  wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous  stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually  generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those  mind-boggling historical incredibilities.Joan was, of course, the  deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed  were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a  glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army -  managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the  field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle  experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.  We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety,  attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of  ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and,  eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape  and murder of her beloved older sister. We see the French royalty, so  driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the  brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this  child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into  what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories. But glory  is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it  is gained - and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of  restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no  longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by  the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for  the crime of witchcraft.Given this fascinating and astonishing series  of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in  interest and insight. And, indeed, `The Messenger' is, perhaps, a better  film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would  indicate. The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of  the tale. The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant  adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all  these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the  film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to  apply some psychological depth to the character. After a particularly  sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and  limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair  over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight. From then on, her actions  arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her  being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic  teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her  trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder  whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an  obsession for personal glory and power. We're a long way from the astute  psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the  story, `The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc,' but `The Messenger' does take  occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the  question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention  or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion  borne of insanity. Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of  Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as  she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this  otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly  familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out  of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud -  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the  stake. Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the  film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not  arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.In terms of  dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable  Hobson's Choice: should the writers employ language that reflects the  reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated  by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more  modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also  possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that  weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the  elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of  `The Messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading  to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and  `I'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter  word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could  ever do without.Those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence  had best be forewarned: the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited,  register high on the bloodletting scale.Of the performers, none matches  in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that  adorn the film. Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving  more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles  occurring at the root of her personality. John Malkovich, as the would-be  French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his  moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film  to allow him to create a multifaceted performance. Faye Dunaway brings a  cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative  mother-in-law.`The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying  mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story  to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews  that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.",3,imperfect

I've seen most of the Joan films except the one with Ingrid Bergman, which I haven't been able to find. I'm not an expert on the historical Joan, but I can compare films. The Joan films have been good, bad, and indifferent. The silent film is beyond compare. This one falls somewhere between bad and indifferent. Someone else mentioned the mix of accents. It drove me crazy. Most of the French army sounded more English than the English and Joan sounded like she was from Illinois. I also get extremely annoyed with historically based films that feel compelled to dumb down the dialogue by salting the dialogue with contemporary-usage obscenities and vulgarities. As a historical novelist myself, one of the things I research meticulously is the slang of the period. Nothing pulls you out of a historical moment like a 20th century slang coming form a long-ago character. I guess ultimately I have to say it's an ok movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend money on it.

I'd give any St. Joan movie 5/5 stars anytime, but this one portrayed St. Joan as somewhat ""mad"". St. Joan wasn't always an angry, raving girl with looking to pick a fight with everyone around her! Wrong depiction of a historical figure from director Luc Beeson!If you like sensational Hollywoood movie war scenes and computer graphics,watch this movie.OK, look, it has a good opening start! Modern people want to see ancient maps and history. It's awesome to see how movie showed audiences what happened, when and where at the very graphical opening start of the movie, and how St. Joan begin her life's story at the time of war. I'd give 5/5 stars on how this movie was told at the start, but everything else seems to go downhill from the second half.Don't be lazy, go read decent historical books about St. Joan instead if you want to study her.If you need to watch a modern movie about St. Joan, I'd recommend watching ""Joan of Arc"" (DVD) starring actress Leelee Sobieski (she looks like actress Helen Hunt). Her saintly aura shines out more in Leelee Sobieski. Her body type also more or less accurately depicts how the historical St. Joan may have looked like.Milla Jovovich, my Lady, continue on with your ""Resident Evil"" series and sexy ""Ultraviolet"" movie roles! You fare much better in sci-fi action movies. You disappointed me, your fan, in this role as a saint! Throw the director's silly script aside, read the books on St. Joan, get inside her head while transporting yourself back to her world, then start acting as St. Joan in the 21st century.Too bad the French have forgotten one of their famous saints these days!Can someone competent make an epic Hollywood blockbuster of St. Joan?",3,"Sexy actress, wrong role.

21686,A2YRDIRL316QJL,0767839129,Stephen M. Kerwick,"[1, 1]","I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated (in the US) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri's  Queen Margot.  Not quite!  There are certainly aspects of brilliance here  both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich's performance, but there is a  tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the  plot.  Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known, but many times, the  director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins.  It's a long  film, but that shouldn't be a vice.  Here it is, because long portions  could be cut without harming the overall effect.  Better yet, the themes  could have been better established and linked and the character development  focused better.  Apart from the title character, everyone else was pretty  much constructed of cardboard.What really offended me about The Messenger was the  dialogue, which in many places is simply ludicrous.  There is plenty of  90's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche, but very little authentic  sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French  nobility (and royalty) and peasants.  At the same time, there are some  cheap, Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble  like the Three Stooges, while Joan takes some implausible action.  In these  respects, at least, The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest  common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well.  This sort of  triviality really disappoints me, as I think it did a lot to mediocratize  another film which should have been very good, Mel Gibson's Patriot.

21687,A12A8LU93A132U,0767839129,Steve,"[0, 0]","Let me say that I like the movie and Jovovich's performance.  The film is also more historically accurate to Joan life then the TV series with Sobieski. You aren't reading this to hear if you want to see the movie, but  if you want to buy the DVD, so I'll review the DVD and this International  version which is different from the American version shown in theaters.  The picture quality is good especially the battle scenes and landscapes  although in somewhat dim scenes the background did not have a lot  definition which I don't remember from the theater. The sound quality was  fine.  I'll break down the difference from the International version with  the American theater release version one by one and my own take them.2:30 minutes was added to the scene where the Dauphin chooses who will  be the impostor.  This is a good addition because it introduces the  characters that will be Joan's captains in the following battles.A  single line, where Joan tells the Dauphin her message.  I didn't like this  because the Dauphin never told anyone what Joan said to him to make him  believe in her.  The American version left this a mystery too.7 minutes  (a whole chapter, 3 scenes) was added right after the private audience  where various officials examine and interview Joan.  I liked this because  historically this is what happened, although I don't agree about how it was  done, a bit ridiculous, and it could have been cut in half.A few lines  here and there that I don't remember, particularly during the battle scenes  that made the battles seem a little bit less intense. For example, ""Do  something!"" ""What do you want me to do?"" ""I don't care, just do something!""  which are lines I don't remember, but I could be wrong. None-the-less some  parts of the battles seemed less intense to me from what I remember.I  may be mistaken, but there seemed to be some deleted scenes too.  The trial  seemed shorter in the International version, which makes sense considering  Americans love of the TV trial a la O.J. Simpson; they would have made it  longer.  I also think the lines where Joan screams out ""Jesus!"" were  deleted which I didn't care for because it was reported that she did scream  out his name.  The final burning scene seemed rather abrupt. I could have  sworn they had a scene where they brought her out, tied her down, and read  the charges before burning her.  I'd definitely buy this DVD if you like  the movie.  It would have been nice to get both versions of the film on  this DVD much like they did for the Abyss.

Despite many excellent film performances, especially his superb role in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, David has also drawn fire from people who seem unwilling to acknowledge that he is also a fine actor as well as a brilliant singer-songwriter.Milla Jovovich portrays a reluctant Warrior Woman who clearly had some kind of ongoing psychic experiences, and who was traumatized by male brutality at an early age. Whether she had a sister or not, she saw other females being raped and killed, as did Queen Boadicea, who was herself raped, along with her daughters.Boadicea made the Romans pay for their brutality, just as Joan of Arc made the English pay for theirs. Neither woman would have been like the simpering milk-toast versions of Joan that we have seen elsewhere. They would have been almost psychotic and able to rouse thousands of male warriors with their fire alone.To me, Milla Jovovich played the part flawlessly.",5,From stone(r) to Joan,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1775,"['Having', 'first', 'seen', 'Milla', 'stoner', 'chick', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'was', 'mightily', 'impressed', 'powerful', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'made', 'Art', 'Movie', 'what', 'totally', 'accept', 'many', 'valid', 'points', 'sketchy', 'casting', 'certain', 'figures', 'groups', 'even', 'bending', 'history', 'movie', 'just', 'power', 'own', 'certain', 'shortcomings', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'graphic', 'approach', 'violence', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'reminded', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'stunning', 'interpretation', 'Shakespeare', 'Henry', 'V', 'Besson', 'Joan', 'definitely', 'same', 'Classic', 'feel', 'it.Being', 'top', 'model', 'suspect', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'experienced', 'same', 'kind', 'jealousy-based', 'animosity', 'multi-faceted', 'talent', 'was', 'also', 'stunning', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'David', 'Bowie', 'many', 'excellent', 'film', 'performances', 'especially', 'superb', 'role', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'David', 'also', 'drawn', 'fire', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'unwilling', 'acknowledge', 'also', 'fine', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'brilliant', 'singer-songwriter.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'reluctant', 'Warrior', 'Woman', 'who', 'clearly', 'had', 'kind', 'ongoing', 'psychic', 'experiences', 'who', 'was', 'traumatized', 'male', 'brutality', 'early', 'age', 'had', 'sister', 'not', 'saw', 'other', 'females', 'being', 'raped', 'killed', 'did', 'Queen', 'Boadicea', 'who', 'was', 'raped', 'daughters.Boadicea', 'made', 'Romans', 'pay', 'brutality', 'just', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'made', 'English', 'pay', 'theirs', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simpering', 'milk-toast', 'versions', 'Joan', 'have', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'psychotic', 'able', 'rouse', 'thousands', 'male', 'warriors', 'fire', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'played', 'part', 'flawlessly']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Cinematography, sets, costumes are all perfection. Mystical sequences are suitably bewildering...are they from the mouth of God or madness? The seemingly endless battle scenes, the thick dark brutality of 15th century warfare, the ruthless machinations of power and betrayal are filmed mercilessly to great effect. The blunt, relentless savagery bludgeons us as we are plunged ferociously into the fray, urged on by a frenzied, schrieking berserker with an angel's face. Regardless of whether you prefer to see Joan's story as myth or history or a combination of the two, this film is a powerful depiction of the mayhem and miracles of martyrdom that can occur when an individual's voice of conscience and reason are lost in the blast of an angry god's screams of retribution. Whether manufactured by religion, manipulated by the state, morphed from some secret personal madness, ""holy war"" has never been the work of the Creative and Loving Spirit that moves the Universe. Suffering and the horrors of war come from people. I didn't see this film when it was in the theatres, but saw it on VHS three years later.  It stikes me that the people behind the 9/11 tragedy, the people who clamored for the death penalty the moment the D.C. snipers were caught, the kamikaze pilots of World War II, and all those down through history who call upon death with a righteous voice have a little of Joan of Arc within them. Who spoke to Joan...the God or the Satan of her religion? Or were the voices from the deep well of her own psyche twisted and turned about by the times in which she lived? Can it be that Bin Laden and Joan of Arc are cut from the same cloth? When will it end? When will it ever end?

The inclusion, two hours in, of Dustin Hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience's doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic on this scale. Unfortunately, it's also the point when the film almost crosses the line into Monty Python - the dialogue's just too funny too often, and somehow the notion of a 15th Century French Catholic peasant girl's conscience manifesting itself as a 62-year-old New York Jewish actor in a cowl doesn't seem overly likely. Curiously, these scenes work better on a second viewing when you're not caught so off-guard by them.On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom) to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally's role in The Mission. It's not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that's long overdue for reappraisal.Columbia's DVD includes the European cut of the film (some 10 minutes longer than the US version), featurette Beyond the Icon, isolated score track and teaser and full trailer.",4,"""I don't think.

21696,A26UW8DNN74AGK,0767839129,"""unhelpful""","[21, 29]","If two great film artists, Carl-Theodore Dreyer and Robert Bresson, saw fit to restrict their talents to Joan of Arc's &quot;passion&quot; and &quot;trial,&quot; then what on earth Luc Bresson thought he could do with  her whole story is sheer megalomania.  An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.  Viewers  should purchase the newly restored and gloriously remastered Passion of  Joan of Arc to get glimpses of what art can do with the enigma of Joan.",2,No luck for Luc,959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,1480,"['two', 'great', 'film', 'artists', 'Carl-Theodore', 'Dreyer', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'saw', 'fit', 'restrict', 'talents', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'quot', 'passion', 'quot', 'quot', 'trial', 'quot', 'then', 'what', 'earth', 'Luc', 'Bresson', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'story', 'sheer', 'megalomania', 'action', 'film', 'director', 'simply', ""n't"", 'skill', 'capture', 'one', 'history', 'greatest', 'enigmas', 'film', 'even', 'large', 'budget', 'international', 'cast', 'clearly', 'besotted', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'else', 'why', 'would', 'cast', 'Fifth', 'Element', ""'the"", 'perfect', 'human', 'so', 'depth', 'role', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'turning', 'poor', 'Joan', 'complete', 'neurotic', 'film', 'real', 'puzzle', 'history', 'not', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'led', 'French', 'army', 'battle', 'won', 'Dauphin', 'ministers', 'actually', 'permitted', 'apparent', 'nut', 'case', 'do', 'so', 'obviously', 'had', ""n't"", 'imagination', 'did', 'Besson', 'look', 'deeply', 'young', 'woman', 'soul', 'find', 'something', 'authentic', '15th-century', 'peasant', 'girl', 'made', 'so', 'ecstatic', 'visions', 'voices', 'made', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'convinced', 'enough', 'countrymen', 'was', 'sent', 'liberate', 'can', 'think', 'maybe', 'two', 'three', 'living', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', ""'re"", 'far', 'too', 'old', 'play', '19-year-old', 'Viewers', 'should', 'purchase', 'newly', 'restored', 'gloriously', 'remastered', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'get', 'glimpses', 'what', 'art', 'can', 'do', 'enigma', 'Joan']",The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS

Amazingly she succeeds; Joan changes history and leads the French army for 2 years. The English, faced with a feared lunatic leader, loose the first battle and retreat from the other. The dauphin is crowned King of France.Happy with his crown, the king wants to negotiate with The English, while Paris is starving and under siege. Joan is not convinced and wants an army to liberate Paris.To get rid of her, he leads her to a trap where she gets caught by the English soldiers.Joan of Arc is burned at the stake for heresy only to be glorified 500 years later as a legendary icon.
