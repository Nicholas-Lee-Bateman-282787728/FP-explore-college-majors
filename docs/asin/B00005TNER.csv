It's not as over-the-top as the Olivia Newton-John extravaganza ""Xanadu"",but it comes pretty close. There's a song every ten minutes, making the movie a music video with a threadbare plot. Stars like Terrence Howard,Padma Lakshmi (host of Top Chef),and R&B; singer Eric Benet (Halle Berry's ex) give the film more glitter than it would otherwise have.Mariah Carey stars as the androgynously named Billie Frank,whose black mother and white father are at odds,and whose mother has drug issues. Billie is dropped off at an orphanage(?) where she meets Tia Texada and Da Brat. In the meantime,there are some painful blinding white flashbacks and dizzying camera work that seems to have been inspiration for ""Cloverfield."" Billie does some backup singing for the conceited diva Silk (Lakshmi) Soon,she catches the ear of DJ Dice (Max Beesley) She gets catapulted into instant fame without much effort on her part. She sings,and audiences are smitten. Terrence Howard does a great job as a sleazy producer--he hustles&flows; his way through the movie. Billie and Dice go on an odd date accompanied by a song that's a smooth jazz radio station sample,one in which Billie spends most of the time sniffing a rose at the restaurant. As is expected,the instant love affair culminates in instant sex thereafter. As Billie's success grows, Dice becomes jealous and controlling. She leaves him, has a successful dance duet with Eric Benet, then has a sold-out one-song concert at Madison Square Garden (where she's learned that Dice has been killed) It ends,amazingly,with the limo driver taking Billie all the way from New York City to her mother's place in the Maryland wilderness.""Glitter"" is the R&B;/pop version of ""A Star is Born."" There's a pervasive,heavy-handed ""no smoking"" message,from Billie's mother accidentally burning down the house to Dice's hinted-at lung cancer.

681947,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005TNER,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","It is not bias when I say that the best thing about this movie is Mariah Carey; that is fact.  Sadly, nothing else about this movie is even remotely worthy of the viewer's attention.  In fact, Carey's own dedication isn't really worth our attention either.  I mean, she tries, but she doesn't really succeed.The film is your generic fluff regarding a young underprivileged aspiring singer who happens to catch a break when a DJ hears her sing in a club.  Soon she's swept away from her thankless backup gig (for a ridiculously untalented yet hilarious Padma Lakshmi) and thrown front and center in a world she isn't really used to.Like I said; generic.The acting here is practically atrocious, especially on the part of Max Beesley, who may give the worst male performance of the decade.  He is just wholly unbelievable, and he tries WAY TOO HARD, and unlike Carey, it shows.  To say that Carey comes off unscathed is rather preposterous since she is the focal point of this horribly bad film.  She does put in the best performance (outside of Padma, who is campy caricature deliciousness) but she isn't given anything noteworthy to do.  Da Brat is just plain awful here (any doubt?) and the rest of the supporting cast fails to do anything memorable.In the end, I must say that my biggest disappointment was the music.  I LOVE Mariah Carey, and this time in her career (released around the time that `Butterfly' and `Day Dream' were making their universal impact) should have resulted in a brilliant soundtrack.  Instead, this album proves to be her WORST, one that is just atrocious with maybe ONE (if any) memorable song.In the end the film turns out to be sappy, predictable and sloppy.  Nothing comes together right here.  Carey is a phenomenal singer, one of the best to ever grace the earth with her presence, but she is no actress (well, she was OUTSTANDING in `Precious', but that is another story).

Here's a quick rundown of the ""plot"" for those of you who have yet to see it (don't bother):  As a little girl, Mariah's character Billie Frank (said to be tribute to two of Mariah's real-life idols Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra) is turned over to child welfare after her alcoholic and/or drug addicted mother (it never really is specified) nearly gets both of them killed in a house fire.  Flash forward about fifteen years later to 1983 where Billie, and her friends since childhood, Louise (Da Brat, who does a wonderful job here as the comedy relief) and Roxanne (Tia Texada) get an offer to sing back up for an attractive, albeit tone-deaf singer named Sylk.  It is at Sylk's lyp synched performance to a track featuring Billie's voice that Billie and company meet a DJ named Julian ""Dice"" Black (Max Beesely, in the only other stand-out role in the film).  He sweet talks Billie into letting him produce her. Within a matter of weeks, she with record deal in hand, ends up getting him in the sack.  The rest is pretty predictable.  Stardom eventually leads to lost friendships, lost love relationships and death.  This film (I'm sorry to even admit it) had the potential to be an okay movie.  There were certain points where the movie tries to be poignant and touching i.e. like when Billie finds out that Dice has been murdered or when she is finally reunited with her long-lost mother.  The sad, but all too obvious fact is Mairah's stiff wooden-like acting and inability to emote onscreen doesn't allow the aforemntioned scenes to have the impact they were intended to.  It is also further proof that Mariah should have stuck to singing and that the filmmakers could have casted a more convincing leading lady.  The box office failure had little to with the release date.  It could have been released in theatres six months prior to September 11th and it, no doubt, would have still earned the same acidic reception and scathing reviews, if not more so. An interesting side note about ""Glitter"" is the same screenplay writer also wrote the script to the far superior Oscar-nominated Tina Turner biopic ""What's Love Got To Do With It.""  Imagine that.All in all, the movie was only about a star and a half.  It was an overused, poorly constructed formula that seemed to very much be a direct rip off of the three aformentioned films.  One review I had read beforehand had described this movie as ""The Mariah Carey Vanity Project"" and that's EXACTLY what it was.  Like it or not, not every entertainer who tries their hand at acting is good at it.  In my opinion, the only good singers-turned-actors are:  Cher, Bette Midler, Janet Jackson, Aaliyah (R.I.P.), DMX, Busta Rhymes and, even though I hate to admit it, Diana Ross.  If you're looking for a great story, then rent ""Postcards From the Edge.""  Its star Meryl Streep is living proof that just because you are good in one realm of the entertainment biz, doesn't mean you automatically HAVE to do the other.",1,A retread on very familiar territory leaves a lot to be desired.,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,3502,"['saw', 'movie', 'two', 'months', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'went', 'theatre', 'where', 'admission', 'was', 'only', '2.00', 'Lucky', 'considering', 'bad', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'proved', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'was', 'just', '[', 'bad', ']', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'more', 'successful', 'predecessors', 'such', 'Rose', 'A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'Mahogany', 'name', 'few', 'positive', 'reviews', 'are', 'doubt', 'Mariah', 'legions', 'fans', 'whom', 'affectionately', 'lambs', 'Sheep', 'more', 'Here', 'quick', 'rundown', 'plot', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'little', 'girl', 'Mariah', 'character', 'Billie', 'Frank', 'said', 'be', 'tribute', 'two', 'Mariah', 'real-life', 'idols', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'turned', 'child', 'welfare', 'alcoholic', 'and/or', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'never', 'really', 'specified', 'nearly', 'killed', 'house', 'fire', 'Flash', 'forward', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', '1983', 'where', 'Billie', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Louise', 'Da', 'Brat', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'here', 'comedy', 'relief', 'Roxanne', 'Tia', 'Texada', 'get', 'offer', 'sing', 'back', 'up', 'attractive', 'tone-deaf', 'singer', 'named', 'Sylk', 'Sylk', 'lyp', 'synched', 'performance', 'track', 'featuring', 'Billie', 'voice', 'Billie', 'company', 'meet', 'DJ', 'named', 'Julian', 'Dice', 'Black', 'Max', 'Beesely', 'only', 'other', 'stand-out', 'role', 'film', 'sweet', 'talks', 'Billie', 'letting', 'produce', 'matter', 'weeks', 'record', 'deal', 'hand', 'up', 'getting', 'sack', 'rest', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'Stardom', 'eventually', 'lost', 'friendships', 'lost', 'love', 'relationships', 'death', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'even', 'admit', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'okay', 'movie', 'were', 'certain', 'points', 'where', 'movie', 'be', 'poignant', 'touching', 'i.e', 'when', 'Billie', 'out', 'Dice', 'been', 'murdered', 'when', 'finally', 'reunited', 'long-lost', 'mother', 'sad', 'too', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Mairah', 'stiff', 'wooden-like', 'acting', 'inability', 'emote', 'onscreen', ""n't"", 'allow', 'aforemntioned', 'scenes', 'have', 'impact', 'were', 'intended', 'also', 'further', 'proof', 'Mariah', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'singing', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'casted', 'more', 'convincing', 'leading', 'lady', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'had', 'little', 'release', 'date', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'theatres', 'six', 'months', 'prior', 'September', '11th', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'earned', 'same', 'acidic', 'reception', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'Glitter', 'same', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'far', 'superior', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'Imagine', 'that.All', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'star', 'half', 'was', 'overused', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'formula', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'direct', 'rip', 'three', 'aformentioned', 'films', 'One', 'review', 'had', 'read', 'beforehand', 'had', 'described', 'movie', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Vanity', 'Project', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'not', 'entertainer', 'who', 'hand', 'acting', 'good', 'opinion', 'only', 'good', 'singers-turned-actors', 'are', 'Cher', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Aaliyah', 'R.I.P', 'DMX', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'even', 'hate', 'admit', 'Diana', 'Ross', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'story', 'then', 'rent', 'Postcards', 'Edge', 'star', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'living', 'proof', 'just', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'realm', 'entertainment', 'biz', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'HAVE', 'do', 'other']",Glitter

681961,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005TNER,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 1]","After ""Glitter"" and her interviews from the ""I Love the 80s Strikes Back"" specials, I had a startling epiphany about Mariah Carey: she's a very boring woman in person.  No offense, she is a great singer (more than I would ever admit in public), but while she's an angelic Goddess that could cry out the fountain of youth on stage, as a normal being, she has all the tone and enthusiasm of a soul-crushed cubicle worker.  This film showcased many of her inabilities: her limited range when acting, her monotonous deliveries, her consistently mellow expression even when she's angry, and the way she pouts whenever she has tear drops in her eyes. She was so dull in her acting, she makes Britney Spears look like Barbara Streisand.  In all probability, she could be the primary flaw of this whole film.No way am I going to be lenient with ""Glitter"", but I do acknowledge how this film had put Mimi in a serious state of depression.  I am going to be nice and say this movie ISN'T worth getting despaired over, as it is slightly better then the likes of ""From Justin to Kelly"" and ""Spice World"" for two reasons: one, it has an actual narrative, unlike ""Spice World""; and two, unlike that American Idol movie, the songs in ""Glitter"" were quite listenable.  In many ways, this is a mirror image to the Britney Spears movie, ""Crossroads"", which I thought was okay.  Both it and ""Crossroads"" are self-indulgent with their leading singer, both deal with mommy issues, and both---ahem---""struggle"" to reach a certain career that they desire. But while ""Crossroads"" could focus on other characters besides the singer and she had to face trials to get ahead of herself, this movie is all about Mariah Carey and she's not taking the hard route.The movie's set in the 1980s, even though the characters didn't act, dress, or walk like it's the '80s. Billie Frank (Carey) and her two best friends since orphanage tried to get into the music. Billie's voice was heard by a Disk Jockey named Dice, and Dice decided to buy her off of her manager, played by Terrance Howard; amusingly enough, Dice didn't pay him up front and yet he acquired the mixed-breed anyway (not a wise decision,DJay). From then on, Billie heads the career stardom as the movie practically ignored her friends just for more of Billie and a bit of her relationship with Dice.Billie's journey is how the movie truly faltered. There's no tension or effort in her progress, she's essentially getting a free ride to fame; no real struggle to care or get involved. Even if there's scenes that have potential for drama, they quickly gets shuffled over: when Billie has trouble wearing a bikini on a video shoot, Dice just dragged her off stage; when her manager threatened Billie over Dice's debts, Dice proceeds to beat the crap out of the manager in the next scene; finally, the heated argument between Billie and Dice due to business arrangements was only brief. The only dramatic moment that stood out was a pretty tragic one, but it happened on the final ten minutes, which led to Billie's impromptu song that the concert band somehow harmonize without knowing the track in advance. Plus, that led to one of the most cop-out endings I've ever laid my glowing face on.""Glitter"" is so easy on the lead character, so superficial on the dilemmas that there's nothing substantial worth seeing; nevermind how horrible the editing is and how warped the scene transitions are.

681963,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005TNER,D. Litton,"[24, 40]","It all began back in 1990, when a young music sensation with a vision of love set out to make it happen, giving us emotions deeper than we'd ever dreamed of, and warning us that someday, ooh, someday, she'd be the only one we'd be wishing for. And for a while, when this hero came along, with the strength to carry the world of music along, it seemed as if we couldn't live if living was without her.Let it be known, Mariah Carey was a favorite during my formative years, her music providing an outlet for emotional grief as well as jubilant bliss. As I grew up, it seemed she did not, as her music generated into little more than Britney Spears for the over 30's. And like most musicians and singers, Carey decided to take the fateful step into mega-stardom by bringing her voice, her looks, and her breasts, onto the big screen.That's where ""Glitter"" comes in, though I doubt the movie is more of a rise for the starlet than it is a crushing blow. It couldn't have come at a worse time, too, as Carey, suffering from various mental breakdowns and delusions of the booty-licious Jennifer Lopez trying to steal her fame, was more or less fragile. And while it may not be cordial to kick people when they're down, I think the atrocity that is ""Glitter"" is enough exception to this rule.The movie is pretty much a fictionalization of Carey's own rise to stardom, beginning with the life of young girl Billie Frank, whose mother works as a lounge singer. One night, a carelessly lit cigarette results in a change in Billie's life: she is forced to leave her mother and become the property of the state, living in a child care home and making two best friends who, you guessed it, will remain by her side, through thick and thin, throughout the entire movie. This I can stomach, but I'd like someone to explain to me just how her cat, seen as a kitten in Billie's younger years, also remains by her side throughout the entire movie.Getting back to the story, the movie skips a couple of years to find itself in 1983, where Billie is working as a backup singer, until she is discovered by famous DJ Dice (Max Beesley), who makes a deal for her contract and begins making her into a star. But while Billie wants to spread her wings and prepare to fly, Dice sees fit to rule over her decisions, his antics keeping her from such prestigious events as the USA Music Awards, and coming between her and her tag-along best friends.So what's a diva to do? Leave him, go back to him, pout and leave again... you see a pattern here? Of course you do: ""Glitter"" makes it so that no event, no plot development, however well-intentioned, is not foreseen at least half an hour before it arrives. The rags-to-riches story is so old, so worn out, that the film is like a slap in the face to the intelligence of moviegoers everywhere. The movie makes attempts to get our attention with two main subplots: Billie's search for her long-lost mother, and Dice's debt to Billie's former producer. Sadly, neither of these carry enough potency to make us believe in the material.I guess one could enjoy ""Glitter"" as an unintentional comedy, with its hilariously uproarious depiction of the 80's club scene in the Big Apple, and the abundance of lines like ""I can't do this without you"" and so forth. The real gut-buster is seeing Carey trotting around in front of the camera, putting forth her best effort, and seeing her fall flat on her face on almost every attempt.

This film could have easily derailed his career but compared to some megaton loads of excess that have been released in the theaters (Showgirls), I don't think many people had high expectations in her acting ability to begin with. Madonna had already blazed that trail, and the only good movies she seemed to be in were where she was in a supporting role.I think that because she is overly self-conscious, it winds up in the film, there are love scenes, daytime soaps show way more.

Finally I did and I thought it was great.  Yeah it wasn't exactly Oscar-winning material but I think Mariah deserved more credit then she got.  ""Glitter"" is a semi-autobiographical tale of girl named Billie Frank (Mariah Carey) who grows up without a mother but finds pleasure in singing.  Her mother was originaly a singer as well.  She meets two kids who remain friends with her throughout the film: Louise (Da Brat) and Roxanne (Tia Texada).  They are a very humerous pair and liven up the movie.  Billie meets a newcomer producer/DJ named Julian Dice (Max Beesley) who eventually offers Billie a record deal after meeting at a New York club.  She accepts, but not knowing there are some hidden strings attached to this once and a lifetime oppertunity.  Another subplot is Billie attempting to find her mother, with no luck.  I'm not going to reveal the rest of the storyline because I want you to see it for yourself, and not judge the movie based on all the bad reviews.  It also stars the R&B singer Eric Benet who meets Billie later in the movie.  The DVD includes Trailers, Director's Commentary and music videos for ""Loverboy (remix)"" and ""Never too far"" (great for us who dont get MTV!).

Her unhinged personal life and the headlines it's generated have translated into a great deal of personal contempt for her and her work.Those expecting a movie that's so bad that it's campy good fun will have to look to masterworks like ""Showgirls.""

There are other movies that you watch simply because of all of the negative press about the movie and you wonder if the film can really be as bad as ""everyone"" has said.  ""Glitter"" falls into the second category of movies.  This was Mariah Carey's first starring role (after a small supporting role in ""The Bachelor""), and both the movie as well her acting were absolutely trashed by critics and ""Glitter"" was a box office bomb.Mariah Carey stars as Billie Frank, a rising pop star in the early 80's.  We open the film when Billie is only a child.  Her mother is a longue singer (or perhaps, a bar singer) who brings Billie on stage so they can sing together.  Her mother seems weary of everything, and when their house burns down (it is implied that the mother is the accidental cause), young Billie is put into foster care.  We are flashed forward to the early 80's and Billie is dancing (with her friends, presumably the two she met in the group home) in a club.  She is signed to sing backup for a solo artist, but it is really Billie's voice that is being used to sell the records.  This is a rags to riches story where Billie starts out with nothing and with the help of a producer (Max Beesley) who hears Billie sing, ends up to be a star.  It mirrors, in a way, the story of Mariah Carey herself.So, is ""Glitter"" really as bad as its reputation suggests?  No.  It couldn't possibly be.  ""Glitter"" is your average rags to riches film and is simply an average movie.  What this movie does is give Mariah a vehicle to show off her singing ability.  It's a movie about a singer going from the smalltime to the big time.  ""Glitter"" seemed to exist more to give Mariah...excuse me, Billie...another opportunity to sing rather than give the character the chance to grow or develop (and thus give Mariah a chance to show off her acting ability).

Mariah's reputation as an actress is secure because she not only produced the movie, she also produced the soundtrack. Society and media needs to acknowledge Mariah's potential as an actress instead of having a disdainful view toward her.""Glitter"" shows how her character(Billie) rose to musical stardom despite her hardships. Her mother was an extraordinary taleted jazz singer who is down on her luck due to her drug and alcohol addiction.  Billie's father is a rich married white guy who had a one night stand with her mother and have never showed any interest in her at all. He simply threw money at her mother who was recently fired from the nightclub and told them never to show up in the affluent neighborhood again. Her mother was forced to give up her lovely daughter after an accidental fire in their run down house, due to carelessness, to a state-run orphanage. Once again, her father didn't take her in. Her mother promised that she would fetch for her once she got herself clean.  The truth is that she never cleaned herself of drug and alcohol and was shown roaming the streets of New York until later in the film when she finally cured herself of those things that ailed her. The film never fully explained the cause of her addiction.Billie met her two companions, Roxie and Louise, at the orphanage, who were played by Tia Texada and Da Brat respectively, who became her lifelong friends. The three were eventually adopted into a loving family who genuinely cared for them until adulthood.In the early 80s, Billie was given a chance to shine in the entertainment world with help from her soon-to-be boyfriend named Dice, a little-known New York DJ who first discovered her singing talent when she was a backup singer for mediocre singer Sylk. She moved into her boyfriend's house soon after and he helped her develop her musical talent.  Trouble came later when her boyfriend became resentful of her astronomical success as well as an unpaid debt to her old producer who is Silk's boyfriend.  She broke up afterwards.  Then she hook up with an aspiring singer played by Halle Berry's husband, Eric Benet, who had done a duet with her.  Then later on in the film, her ex-boyfriend was murdered and she and her mother finally reunited in rural Maryland at the end of the film.Please have an open mind.

681994,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005TNER,Lawyeraau,"[14, 21]","I viewed this film with some trepidation, given the panning it got from the critics. Well, to my surprise, it is nowhere near the worst movie of the year. While it is not in the same league as the film, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, from which it borrows heavily, it is certainly not without some redeeming qualities.The film basically chronicles the rags to riches story of talented singer, Billie Frank (Mariah Carey). Her mother, a woman with a substance abuse problem, sang in dives for a living, before abandoning Billie to the custody of the state. Motherless, Billie grew into a lovely, young woman. Having inherited her mother's talent, she, too,  became a singer, working as part of a trio, until discovered by DJ of the Year, Dice (Max Beesley).Dice, in effect, becomes her manager and producer. They also become an item, until his svengali act wears a bit thin. Struggling to be her own person, they part company still loving each other. Just before disaster strikes, they realize just how much each loves the other. Billie also realizes that, despite personal trials and tribulations, the show must go on.While Mariah's performance has been heavily criticized, I think that she has taken a drubbing that has not been totally warranted. Her singing in the film is top notch, though her acting, admittedly, is a bit wooden and limited. It runs the gamut from sheepish grins to deadpan delivery. She needs work in the acting department, no doubt about it.Max Beesley, however, is surprisingly  good in the role of Dice,  though he is hampered somewhat by the screenplay. His lines are not much better than Mariah's, though his delivery of the lines is superior to that of her delivery. The rest of the cast is fine, doing the best that they can with the lines with which they have to work.Part of the problem, obviously, is the material with which the cast had to work. Kate Lanier's screenplay is nothing to write home to mother about, with stilted dialogue and a story line that fades once it stops borrowing from &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. The thing to do, when borrowing heavily from another film, is to do it better not worse. In this, the screenplay fails.The screenplay, however, is not the only problem with this film. Director Vondie Curtis Hall was a trifle ham handed in his direction, at times. This is no surprise, if his his commentary, which was surprisingly inarticulate, is any indication.Still, though not the best film, it is far from the worst.

681998,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,B00005TNER,Luis Hernandez,"[11, 20]","Following the lead of many pop divas who want to make the transition from the music charts to the box office, Mariah Carey stars in this big-budget turkey that had flop written all over it from the start. In a film that she claims is semi-autobiographical, Mariah proves that she no longer is the sweetheart of the mainstream American pop scene in what many will see as an attempt by Ms. Carey to move from predominately caucasian audiences to one that is urban.In ""Glitter,"" Carey plays Billie Frank, a biracial child who was the product of a fling between a black lounge singer and a married caucasian man. Billie, who is placed in a foster home and grows up there with the support of two friends (played by rapper Da Brat and Tia Texeda) appears to be on the verge of major success. While singing back up for a talentless singer named Sylk, Billie is discovered by a New York deejay, Julian Dice (played by Max Beesley), who pours his energy into producing the next big thing in the New York music scene.As the movie progresses, Billie and Julian develop a relationship that not only involves romance, but also plenty of success along the way. Ultimately, like in many romances there is a tragic ending, however the film ends with a positive conclusion that some might find heartbreaking (not to me). The film, which was supposed to be Mariah's vehicle to film stardom was also tied to the release of an album by the same name under her new short-lived contract with Virgin Records (that contract was canceled and Mariah was given a fee to walk away from the company due to the terrible sales of the album) was a major dud upon its' release in theaters and soon found itself on video store shelves soon after.""Glitter,"" directed by Vonde Curtis Hall, is not an Oscar-calibre film worth watching. If you are tired of hearing about Mariah's antics on the news, than this film won't help you relieve you from such pain. Besides the fact that film has excellent zooming of scenes and the fact that in one scene we can see both towers of the World Trade Center still standing before that horrible day in September 2001, there is not a reason in this world to watch this turkey. Someone should have named this film ""Butterball,"" because just like a turkey, it stuffed with ... and will put you to sleep in a short time. ""Glitter"" only gives us proof that Mariah is over the hill and that she not only alienated audiences due to the bad publicity she had in 2001, but also due to her confusion about her ethnic roots. Mariah was born on Long Island, New York, and not in New York City. Mariah's mother is Irish (as in caucasian) and her father is of mixed Afro-European descent (he is Venezuelan). Mariah was discovered due to the good deed her friend, singer Brenda K. Starr, did for her when she forwarded a tape of Mariah's vocals to Sony Music Head Tommy Mottola (Mariah's ex-husband). Therefore if she claims this is a semi-autobiographical film, than Mariah must be on something if she can't honestly tell her own life story.If you are looking for a sedative, ""Glitter"" is the film for you.

681999,AXLW246TETRY1,B00005TNER,Lunchbox,"[8, 11]","First, I need to justify the reason why I rented this film: I simply wanted to have a good laugh, because I knew it had won a lot of Golden Raspberries, and there's Mariah Carey in it, so it had to be really awful.Awful it was. We follow the very ordinary and pathetic path of a young woman who suddenly becomes a superstar. Wow! How original! I heard that even though Mariah is playing a fictional character, the story is inspired by Mariah's career. I guess she just added some semi-dramatic (as we are trying not to laugh when something bad happens to her) elements in the story to make it an even bigger cliche collection.There are no SO ridiculous or absurd parts in this film, because it stays very simple (and I don't think anyone from this film has the IQ to go for something more complex), but it really simply sucks. There are many scenes where the director clumsily put occasions for Mariah to show her supposedly amazing voice. I guess that gave Mariah a reason to release a new album and make more money (and also get fired from her label HA HA!). When you get to the rolling credits, you just can't understand how the film could last one hour and forty minutes and leave you with the impression that you slept for one hour and forty minutes, even if you didn't. This film is empty. Period.With some awful acting from Mariah Carey, who should first: stop acting and second: stop singing, you are left with the impossible belief that they took her as the lead actress. She never sounds natural, she will get on your nerves with her shallow acting when she tries to demonstrate feelings other than simply smiling like an idiot like she does all the time on MTV. I know that may sound very mean, but it really leaves you that impression, especially if you don't really like pop music/movies. As an actress, she has no charisma, physically (I really don't think this woman is attractive at all) and she simply doesn't have a believable enough psychological aspect in her character to mention it. She is not the only bad actress in Glitter, there's also the boyfriend. He's not EXTREMELY bad, but noticeably. The mother is also pretty awful, and the black guy that is some kind of &quot;gangster&quot; is one of the worst.The directing is conventional, it has nothing special, nothing good, nothing bad, except for the fact that it gives a product entitled &quot;Glitter&quot;. That's all I had to say for the directing.Overall, &quot;Glitter&quot; is, without being the worst thing I've seen in my life, a very pathetic piece of cinema and a very meaningful failure for Mariah Carey.

When I first saw the trailer for Mariah Carey's &quot;Glitter&quot; and heard those fateful words, the knell of doom sounded in my mind.Still, when someone offered me a free ticket for a sneak preview I could not resist.  If nothing else, it would be good for a few laughs, I thought.But no.  &quot;Glitter&quot; takes itself deadly seriously, as does Mariah, and that turns what could have been a so-bad-it's-funny film into 100 minutes of tedium and eye-rolling.The plot, as it usually is for recording artists' vanity vehicles, is simple--Mariah plays Billie Frank, a poor kid from the other side of the tracks (alcoholic mother, absent father, blah, blah, blah) who ascends to divahood with the help of her dj/producer (Max Beesley), who then grows jealous of her success.  Anyone who has seen &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (or &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; for that matter) will know exactly how the film turns out.  It roughly follows the path of Mariah's own success, complete with mean Tommy Mottola and Brenda K. Starr clones (FYI, Mariah got a start singing backup for Brenda).What makes the film ultimately ludicrous is that it is purported to take place in the mid-eighties, but the look, slang and fashions are straight outta &quot;TRL,&quot; since these days the majority of Mariah's fans weren't even born when Reagan was president.  Why this particular time frame was chosen is a mystery.  Anyone over the age of 25 who sees this film will have a great deal of fun marveling at what we were supposedly wearing and listening to back then (dreadlocks?  rapping?  In 1983 we were wearing color-coordinated flouncy miniskirt sets and listening to Duran Duran in the clubs!).  And Billie's supposedly self-penned 1983 hit, &quot;I Didn't Mean To Turn You On,&quot; was a Robert Palmer song--that came out in 1985!  Videos, with the exception of Michael Jackson, were still pretty much straight performance shots, but nope, there Mariah is in a dreamy dance sequence clad in a silver bikini.This movie misses on so many levels it's amazing.  At the sneak preview I attended, there were two girls, around 14 or so, sitting in front of my friend and I.  Rabid Mariah fans both, they were bouncing around excitedly when the movie began.  By the end, they were sitting in as much of a daze as the rest of the audience.  As we filed out, one of them said, &quot;I still love Mariah, but that movie was really bad.&quot;Out of the mouths of babes ...",1,"Uh, Mariah?

If one were to examine most blockbuster films, it would appear that most such movies have a central event or storyline. In 'Glitter', this is not at all the case. One moment, Billie (mariah) tries to cope with finding her mother, another moment she's in the process of cutting a record, and at the same time, she's fending off the jealousy pangs of her boyfriend...All in all, there are just too many events occuring and they somewhat don't relate well to one another...In a nutshell, the movie has covered much more breadth than depth and as a result, it becomes awfully superficial and somewhat cheesy.It is also a somewhat badly directed movie. Why are the 'cute' transition effects appearing in this movie at all? Unless the movie was intended to be a fantasy or dreamy movie, such embellishments are simply inappropriate. Indeed, Glitter was more of serious drama rather than some whimiscal fantasy film.I suppose the failure of Glitter could have been attributed by Mariah Carey's desire to put her life story onto the big screen. However, more thought could have given to design a specific theme, and then to include only the events that help to reinforce each other, instead of just dumping everything possible into the film.Not surprisingly, with its whole array of events occuring randomly throughout the movie, one does get 'confused' at the end of it all. What was the most important event in the movie? Does the movie provide any meaning at all?

It is about this young girl named Billie with a troubled past. She used to sing, but not anymore. When Billie grows up and becomes and adult, she meets this bad boy club DJ named Dice who discovers that she is a very talented singer and tries to get her a record deal--he also ends up falling in love with her. Kind of predictable, but what Hollywood-based movie isn't these days?Mariah Carey is actually a talented actress, and I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan. I'm saying this because she truly is a talented actress. I found GLITTER to be a very underrated film, and was put down by a lot of people and critics because it's Mariah's first. It is a crowd-pleasing film, and Max Beesley who plays Dice is also talented and is quite a fine-looking guy, which never hurts.The DVD is a nice touching finish to the project, and it includes the music videos for &quot;Loverboy&quot; and &quot;Never Too Far&quot; both performed by Mariah Carey. It also gives us a commentary by the director, Vondie Curtis-Hall, and theatrical trailers. This DVD comes in both widescreen and full frame formats, which is nice because you don't have to go out and buy two separate DVDs.But really though, this is a film that only true Mariah Carey fans can appreciate, because everyone else who sees it would just bash it and find it to be bad. I didn't think GLITTER was all that bad because trust me, I've seen worse movies. For Mariah Carey fans, this film is highly recommended.

Right up there with Xanadu, Endless Love, and Grease 2.  The story is a very simple one about how a girl who lived a tough life and ends up as the biggest pop star of her day.For starters, any period piece for a show-business story should NOT be set in the 80s.  The costumes are far too distracting to care about anything else most of the time.The acting is at best really [bad].  Mariah Carey, who can sing like nobody's business, does not have the same acting ability.  Her facial expression doesn't change at all throughout the whole film, and her line delivery can be anywhere from wooden to hamming it up.  I forgot this movie wasn't supposed to be a scene from a soap opera.The writing itself is just sacriledge.  Full of really bad phrases and[] sentences, you just cringe hearing some of them.  To give you a taste: ""The glitter can't overpower the artist,"" ""Shake your chi-chi,"" and my favorite, ""Woe is me?  What the hell is that?""  Even Dawson's Creek was written better than this.Now, the story is just plain sad.  So many important details are overlooked and just poorly explained.  In the beginning, the mother falls asleep on the couch and drops a lit cigarette between the cushions.  The house burns down, and the viewer is supposed to understand that the mother has a substance abuse problem?  Just because someone gets drunk one in the beginning doesn't mean they're an alcoholic.  Show her trying to go on without it, or going through desperate measures to get some liquor and then I'll buy it.  And how about the cat that disappears thoughout most of the movie and then all of a sudden is back?I can't go on much more.  This film is not bad enough to be good.

682019,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005TNER,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 4]","""Glitter"" deserves its reputation as a hackneyed rags-to-riches story that has been told and re-told many times. After the opening credit sequence, which surely must hold some kind of record for most pointlessly drawn out credit sequence in film history, we meet a young Mariah Carey. Here Mariah plays Billie Frank, a talented young singer who has a meteoric rise to the top, but (surprise!) finds that the high life has its own set of challenges. I was especially amused by a conversation among producers when the assertion ""He just signed Chilly D"" was taken as great praise. That made me think was it Chilly D as played by Lorenzo Lamas in ""Body Rock,"" or Chilly D that Melvin Van Peebles made famous in ""Identity Crisis?"" After watching the film, sadly it seems likely it was the former.Billie's overprotective producer and boyfriend Dice, played by Max Beesley (who?,) provides much of the conflict in the film: please especially note his ridiculous overreaction to seeing Billie in a bikini during a video shoot. Note also that a musical montage shopping spree with the girls makes it all better: no problem, it was the same decade that Madonna sang about a material girl, after all. The film has numerous subplots including a pathos-filled story about looking for the mother that gave her up for adoption and about rival would-be music mogul Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) who has a backroom deal for her contract, which leads to fisticuffs and ultimately Dice's untimely demise. It's all very dramatic. The film, annoyingly set in the 1980's with the requisite clothes and utterly wretched music, perfectly suits Carey's talents. Perhaps the single biggest annoyance was the repetitious use of ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On,"" made famous by Robert Palmer on the 1986 album ""Riptide."" They got the rights to the song, and they got their money's worth.This film got terrible reviews and deserved every single one of them. Mariah Carey may have a great voice (nobody's saying otherwise,) but a leading lady she is not.

682021,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005TNER,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 7]","What happens when an insecure late 20s pop singer fears her fifteen minutes of fame are almost up? She tries to cross over into other entertainment mediums she knows nothing about such as acting. What happens when said singer tries to act with no training? You get the disaster known as ""Glitter.""""Glitter"" doesn't ""Sparkle"" for Mariah Carey or help her attain her the ""Fame"" of her 80's contemporary Irene Cara. The plot is so predictable you know what's going to happen after watching the opening credits. Billie Frank abandoned by her mother and sent to a group home is going to grow up and MAKE IT BIG. On this journey down the yellow brick road to the riches her manager ""Dice"", two group home buddies and a cat that replaces Toto. Sadly the cat is smart enough to split halfway through this nightmare of a film and not come back until near the final act. If only I were as lucky as he is.The story is supposed to be about life in New York City in 1983. I never got a sense of that period watching that film. (I grew up in NYC during the 80's and I wish it were that nice or that safe.) Glitter looked like the Disneyfied 2001 New York City not the grim gritty 1983 New York City. There was no ""urban jungle"" of burnt out buildings, dilapidated apartments, junkies, graffiti painted subways and dirty streets. Music was important to people because it was the only thing besides education that gave them hope in all that despair. For a lot of people it was their only ticket out of the ghetto. Had the producers of this film studied the era they put this film in (Fort Apache, the Bronx, Krush Groove, and Beat Street would have been great reference material to use for research) they would have understood how the dark mood of the city motivated so many to work towards their dreams. Instead they develop a shallow screenplay that glosses over those important that would improve the story and ignores cinematic details like mood, tone and atmosphere that would have made this boring film somewhat interesting. A story set in the REAL grim gritty 1983 NYC would give Billie some REAL motivation to beat the odds and make it big. She'd be singing her heart out because there would be no way else to go but in the grave.The horrible cinematography makes Pearl Harbor's quick cut editing appears Oscar worthy. The camera doesn't stay in one place but a second before moving someplace else. I had to wonder if the cinematographer had ADHD. If you look closely you'll realize there isn't a close up to be found in this film, every shot is a wide shot that keeps you from focusing on the actor's faces. I guess the director was trying to cover for how bad the acting is in this film. And boy, does it stink. I've seen better acting in an eighth grade play than in this film.Mariah Carey is wretched in the role of Billie Frank. She has a grand total of TWO facial expressions: Happy and confused. That's some acting range. Irene Cara (Sparkle) Diana Ross (Lady Sings the blues, Mahogany) and Judy Garland (A star is born) at least had some screen presence and gave good performances. Eric Benet is the only person to give a WORSE performance (ONE facial expression; a silly grin.) Everyone else phones it in realizing ""all hope is lost,"" praying no one will see them in this horror of a movie or see it on their resume.Unless you're a MST3K producer looking for a film Mike and the bots to bash avoid this trash.

Whitney Houston's acting was even more wooden than Mariah Carey's, and comparatively, the story was less believable.  And the music in ""Bodyguard"" was worse.""Glitter's"" story is actually pretty good, if a bit tired.  Mariah Carey plays Billie Frank, a beautiful young woman who faces down hard times and despair to become a national singing success in mid-1980's New York.  The camera work and pacing is actually pretty good; the movie doesn't drag along excessively.  Great performances by Da Brat (who knew!) and Tia Texada as Billie's backup singers and girlfriends keep it real, and Max Beesley puts in a decent performance as Billie's manager / love interest, Dice.The biggest problem with ""Glitter,"" I think, is that it's Mariah Carey in a starring role.  She's trying hard, to be sure, but she's not leading lady material.  I think that people love to hate her because of her bigger than life marketing and those sappy songs.  That would be a good reason, I guess.  (Note to Jennifer Lopez:  BEWARE!).  It's hard to believe that she could take herself seriously although if you compare what she's made musically to what Elton John or Cher has turned out in the past ten or so years, she's a little less campy by comparison.There are some funny parts in ""Glitter"", especially the video shoot and the time she thinks she found her estranged mother and it turns out to be a junkie,  but it's sappy and a little contrived and yet strangely earnest.

At an orphanage, she befriends Louise and Roxanne. Flash forward to 1983. Billie and her friends are spotted by a record producer, Timothy Walker, who wants them to sing backup for his latest pop-music discovery. But when super DJ Dice hears Billie's incredible voice, he makes a shady deal with Timothy to get her out of that dead-end situation. Soon, Billie and Dice are making hits inside the studio, and falling in love outside of it. Eventually, the pressure of her newfound celebrity puts too heavy a strain on Billie, forcing her to decide what it is she really wants from Dice, and what she wants for herself.

The disturbing thing is Carey is middle aged, getting close to 50, yet she asks us to buy her as someone barely out of her teens.

The result was, my realization that sometimes critics and I can agree.Probably, Mariah Carey is not responsible for choosing the wrong materials for the film; playing a singer is not a bad idea, if you get a strong support from somewhere else.  Look at, for example...So, what is wrong with the film? The lack of good script is one reason; so many things are put into the film.  So the pace of the film is too fast, and sometimes suddenly stops to showcase her singing.  This, however, should be still OK, but there was a serious moment concerning alcohol and lost mother.  The film suffers at his moment because, somehow, we cannot dissociate the real Mariah from the character she is playing.  I know the film is a fiction, but I could not help thinking, ""Did she (Mariah) really experience these things?"" As you know, these serious scenes should be suitable in films like ""Tina,"" but they are hardly desirable alongside Mariah's persona.  That is why the last scene (which tries to wring tears from us) fails, because we KNOW she is just playing the part.I don't think this is a vanity product, but still a result of misguided judgment.  Why not strong supporting cast? (Eric Benet appears, giving a good, but too brief support.)  Why not another director?  Vondie Curtis-Hall, known as director of ""Glidlock'd,"" though I liked the film itself, hardly is a right choice.

GLITTER is an enjoyable, light movie to watch. Mariah does OK on her first try as an actress. I admit, some scenes are a bit cheesy but it's not THAT bad. GLITTER begins with flashbacks of Billie's (Mariah's Character) past as a child with her mom. Her mom is a struggling singer that performs at bars/clubs. Soon after Billie's mom puts her in a foster home. Then, GLITTER fast forwards to 1983 in the club scene. Billie is now a young woman working at the club as a dancer. Anyways, to make a long story short she gets discovered by this guy (Dice) and he becomes her boyfriend/mananger. Billie now tries to make it as a singer in the 80's.
