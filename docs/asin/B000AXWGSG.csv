Our family watched them when they originally aired on the Disney Channel and became instantly hooked.  By the time the series completed it's run, the characters were so familiar they felt like family.  I purchased series one from Sullivan Entertainment in Canada but found the price to be prohibitive and figured I wouldn't be able to own the rest of the show.  Thankfully Disney has released season one in an affordable package and I can only hope they will do the same with series 2-7.

934185,A2BRAS9ZQW7GJ5,B000AXWGSG,"L. M. Anderson ""movie addict""","[68, 69]","I was so excited when I found out Disney was selling ""Tales from Avonlea"", aka ""Road to Avonlea"" for around $29.00. I had been wanting to buy the series for years but in most stores the cost of one season (13 episodes)from the Sullivan release ranged from $69.99 to $99.99 and I just couldn't come to terms with paying that price for so few episodes. So when this title came out from Disney for 1/3 to 1/2 the cost I decided to buy it figuring they changed the name due to copy rights but it must be the same show.Well, it's the same show all right but each episode has been shortened by 10 to 13 minutes. While I was watching it I really felt like some scenes didn't make sense and it felt very choppy so I went to the Sullivan website and read the reviews and found out that episodes had been shortened on the Disney release to allow enough time for commercials and other comments were that they had lost or couldn't find the minutes that were missing. It wasn't 100% clear as to the real reason why it was shortened but it was.I decided to buy Season one and two of Road to Avonlea at Music World today for $69.99 each and watched the original pilot episode from season one with the pilot episode of season one of the Disney release side by side at the same time and sure enough 13 minutes were missing throughout the Disney release.If you are a true, die hard fan, of this Canadian Classic Television show I recommend that you buy the Sullivan release of Road to Avonlea instead. All 7 seasons are now available and if you look around you can get them for a fair price. It will be double the cost of this one but you will get all the episodes complete along with a lot of extras/special features which this set does not have.If you are not a die hard fan of the show and only saw these episodes on the Disney channel and don't care if you miss some scenes then buy this set cause you don't know what you're missing anyway. LOL!!!Oh and both versions of the show do have a poor DVD transfew of picture and sound but considering the show is almost 20 years old and Canadian it shouldn't really interfere with your enjoyment of this amazing classic.I hope this info helps.",1,Don't waste your money.....buy Road to Avonlea instead.,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,2173,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Disney', 'was', 'selling', 'Tales', 'Avonlea', 'Road', 'Avonlea', '29.00', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'buy', 'series', 'years', 'most', 'stores', 'cost', 'one', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'Sullivan', 'release', 'ranged', '69.99', '99.99', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'terms', 'paying', 'price', 'few', 'episodes', 'So', 'when', 'title', 'came', 'out', 'Disney', '1/3', '1/2', 'cost', 'decided', 'buy', 'figuring', 'changed', 'name', 'due', 'copy', 'rights', 'must', 'be', 'same', 'show.Well', 'same', 'show', 'right', 'episode', 'been', 'shortened', '10', '13', 'minutes', 'was', 'watching', 'really', 'felt', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'felt', 'very', 'choppy', 'went', 'Sullivan', 'website', 'read', 'reviews', 'found', 'out', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'shortened', 'Disney', 'release', 'allow', 'enough', 'time', 'commercials', 'other', 'comments', 'were', 'had', 'lost', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'minutes', 'were', 'missing', 'was', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'clear', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'shortened', 'decided', 'buy', 'Season', 'one', 'two', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'Music', 'World', 'today', '69.99', 'watched', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'pilot', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'Disney', 'release', 'side', 'side', 'same', 'time', 'sure', 'enough', '13', 'minutes', 'were', 'missing', 'Disney', 'release.If', 'are', 'true', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Canadian', 'Classic', 'Television', 'show', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Sullivan', 'release', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'instead', '7', 'seasons', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'look', 'can', 'get', 'fair', 'price', 'will', 'be', 'double', 'cost', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'episodes', 'complete', 'lot', 'extras/special', 'features', 'set', 'not', 'have.If', 'are', 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'show', 'only', 'saw', 'episodes', 'Disney', 'channel', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'miss', 'scenes', 'then', 'buy', 'set', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'anyway', 'LOL', 'Oh', 'versions', 'show', 'do', 'have', 'poor', 'DVD', 'transfew', 'picture', 'sound', 'considering', 'show', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'old', 'Canadian', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'amazing', 'classic.I', 'hope', 'info']",Tales From Avonlea - The Complete First Season
934186,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B000AXWGSG,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[29, 32]","Finally after all these years the first season of the Disney Channel series comes to DVD. Known as ""Road to Avonlea"" in Canada, ""Avonlea"" as it is known in the US, is a spin off series of the popular canadian mini-series ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" (AKA ""Anne of Green Gables: The Sequal"").The first season of the show revolves around the adventures of Sara Stanley, a young child who has to go to live with her Aunt in the small town of Avonlea after her father is involved in a embessleing scam.This season in particular of the show features a couple of characters from the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series such as, Marilla Cuthbert who appears in two episodes and Rachel Lynde who appears in 3 or 4.  This particular season features the first appearences of some of ""Avonlea's"" most beloved characters including Jasper Dale, Peg Powen, and of course Sally Potts.This particular season is pretty kidieish if I do say so myself. With most of the episodes revolving around the adventures of Sarah, Felicity, Felix, and Andrew King. In other words, the kids. There are some adult plot lines but not many.  Overall, it's just a nice family show that the whole family can watch and enjoy. It is also good to keep in mind that season 1 doesn't really do justice to the entire series.  From season 2-5 this was with out a doubt one of the best shows on telivision.It is also worth noteing that these DVD's have been available for quite some time in Canada, however the US releases seem as if they are going to be as much as $60 CHEAPER!!! Of Course you get what you pay for.This DVD is butchered within a inch of its life. I know everyone has been saying how poorly this DVD is edited and they are all right. It's not just that these episodes are edited down to their syndicated running time, there are essential scenes that are important to the plot, that have been just ripped from the DVD! This is horrible and not acceptible. I have purchased one of the ""Road to Avonlea"" seasons (number 5 to be exact). The transfer is done well, ALL of the scenes are there, except the opening credits aren't there, and the DVD's are double sided. So, what to do? Well sad to say there isn't anything fans can do but complain. Sullivan isn't getting it right and nor is Disney. We fans what the shows that we sat down to watch on the Disney channel in the early to mid-90's.So in closing if your new to the show, or don't mind having 10 minutes of each episode ripped from the DVD then go with this purchase. If not, I would reccomend purchasing the videos. You can buy every episode of season one on video and they are totally complete, opening credits and all!",3,"It's about time, but this is still not right!",1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2660,"['Finally', 'years', 'first', 'season', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'series', 'DVD', 'Known', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'Canada', 'Avonlea', 'known', 'US', 'spin', 'series', 'popular', 'canadian', 'mini-series', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'AKA', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Sequal', '.The', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'adventures', 'Sara', 'Stanley', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'go', 'live', 'Aunt', 'small', 'town', 'Avonlea', 'father', 'involved', 'embessleing', 'scam.This', 'season', 'particular', 'show', 'couple', 'characters', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'series', 'such', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'two', 'episodes', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'who', '3', '4', 'particular', 'season', 'first', 'appearences', 'Avonlea', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'including', 'Jasper', 'Dale', 'Peg', 'Powen', 'course', 'Sally', 'Potts.This', 'particular', 'season', 'pretty', 'kidieish', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'most', 'episodes', 'revolving', 'adventures', 'Sarah', 'Felicity', 'Felix', 'Andrew', 'King', 'other', 'words', 'kids', 'are', 'adult', 'plot', 'lines', 'not', 'many', 'Overall', 'just', 'nice', 'family', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'also', 'good', 'keep', 'mind', 'season', '1', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'entire', 'series', 'season', '2-5', 'was', 'out', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'telivision.It', 'also', 'worth', 'noteing', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'quite', 'time', 'Canada', 'however', 'US', 'seem', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'much', '60', 'CHEAPER', 'Course', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'for.This', 'DVD', 'butchered', 'inch', 'life', 'know', 'everyone', 'been', 'saying', 'how', 'poorly', 'DVD', 'edited', 'are', 'right', 'not', 'just', 'episodes', 'are', 'edited', 'syndicated', 'running', 'time', 'are', 'essential', 'scenes', 'are', 'important', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'ripped', 'DVD', 'horrible', 'not', 'acceptible', 'have', 'purchased', 'one', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'seasons', 'number', '5', 'be', 'exact', 'transfer', 'done', 'well', 'scenes', 'are', 'there', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'DVD', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'Well', 'sad', 'say', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fans', 'can', 'do', 'complain', 'Sullivan', ""n't"", 'getting', 'right', 'Disney', 'fans', 'what', 'shows', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Disney', 'channel', 'early', ""mid-90's.So"", 'closing', 'new', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', '10', 'minutes', 'episode', 'ripped', 'DVD', 'then', 'go', 'purchase', 'not', 'would', 'reccomend', 'purchasing', 'videos', 'can', 'buy', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'video', 'are', 'totally', 'complete', 'opening', 'credits']",Tales From Avonlea - The Complete First Season

Garlock ""Radical Feminist""","[123, 127]","I was looking forward to buying this since the dvd packages released in Canada are twice as expensive as this release.I was planning on buying it and then I started reading reviews on other sites where people have access to both the Canadian dvds and Disney's. While the Canadian dvds do has missing scenes, it is because the scenes got lost due to lack of preservation over time. (Both Sullivan and Disney had access to the same material to produce the dvds, so even Disney would not have been able to recover these missing scenes.)Disney's contains missing scenes as well--however, these scenes have been purposefully edited out to cut down the runtime. Each episode on the Disney dvd has been edited to take out as much as 15 minutes per episode.This is a much beloved series and why Disney would edit down the storylines makes no sense at all. I would rather pay more for a dvd that has ALL the material from the episode rather than a cheaper version that PURPOSELY edited out material. Furthermore, Disney is messing with the artistic integrity of the series by editing out scenes. (Disney aired the series commercial-free and with all their content intact, which makes the editing of the series for dvd release even more perplexing.)Disney may have had very valid reasons for editing the material, however, they can't rightly call it a 'complete' season when it is INcomplete.If Disney plans to release a season 2 of TfA, let's hope that they include all the scenes.",1,Disney's Tales are NOT complete,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1472,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'buying', 'dvd', 'packages', 'released', 'Canada', 'are', 'twice', 'as', 'expensive', 'release.I', 'was', 'planning', 'buying', 'then', 'started', 'reading', 'reviews', 'other', 'sites', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'access', 'Canadian', 'dvds', 'Disney', 'Canadian', 'dvds', 'do', 'missing', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'got', 'lost', 'due', 'lack', 'preservation', 'time', 'Sullivan', 'Disney', 'had', 'access', 'same', 'material', 'produce', 'dvds', 'so', 'even', 'Disney', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'recover', 'missing', 'scenes', 'Disney', 'contains', 'missing', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'however', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'purposefully', 'edited', 'out', 'cut', 'down', 'runtime', 'episode', 'Disney', 'dvd', 'been', 'edited', 'take', 'out', 'as', 'much', '15', 'minutes', 'episode.This', 'much', 'beloved', 'series', 'why', 'Disney', 'would', 'edit', 'down', 'storylines', 'sense', 'would', 'rather', 'pay', 'more', 'dvd', 'material', 'episode', 'rather', 'cheaper', 'version', 'PURPOSELY', 'edited', 'out', 'material', 'Furthermore', 'Disney', 'messing', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'series', 'editing', 'out', 'scenes', 'Disney', 'aired', 'series', 'commercial-free', 'content', 'intact', 'editing', 'series', 'dvd', 'release', 'even', 'more', 'perplexing', 'Disney', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'valid', 'reasons', 'editing', 'material', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rightly', 'call', ""'complete"", 'season', 'when', 'INcomplete.If', 'Disney', 'release', 'season', '2', 'TfA', 'let', 'hope', 'include', 'scenes']",Tales From Avonlea - The Complete First Season
