I thought it was going to be another worthless movie about kids and their pets, where the plot is just like in every other movie, just with better special effects and of course, hollywoods voices. I disliked Owen's voice as for Marmaduke. Every time he spoke, I saw a picture of him in my mind, not the dog. The problem is that the actor is famous, I saw a lot of movies with him. And his voice is easy to recognize. So when Owen speaks I always notice that. The thought of that doesn't go and just sits there. As the movie was playing further, it started to feel more catchy. I liked the cat that played there and the relationship between dog and the cat and dogs with other dogs. Frankly I didn't care much about humans. Why? because they are the second main actors in this and all the other movies. I wanted something new and instead it's basically the same plot just with better animation. I didn't really like the main dog character Marmaduke. It just didn't catch me. For kids Marmaduke will be fine, but it wasn't for me. Honestly I liked the cat more and the rescue dog. She caught more of my attention. And I don't think that was only because Marmaduke was always goofing around like other dogs in other movies. As it hit the point in the movie where Marmaduke met the other dogs, I felt like giving it 3-4 stars. And finally the drama moment. There must be one. Just like in every other movie. Well, that made me like the movie even more. And that was when I agreed with myself on giving it 5 stars. I'm not greedy, the movie was done well, just not entirely original. Therefore I still gave it 5 stars.",5,"From 1 to 5 stars, and that is how and why",1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,1669,"['When', 'started', 'watch', 'movie', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'worthless', 'movie', 'kids', 'pets', 'where', 'plot', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'just', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'hollywoods', 'voices', 'disliked', 'Owen', 'voice', 'Marmaduke', 'Every', 'time', 'spoke', 'saw', 'picture', 'mind', 'not', 'dog', 'problem', 'actor', 'famous', 'saw', 'lot', 'movies', 'voice', 'easy', 'recognize', 'So', 'when', 'Owen', 'always', 'notice', 'thought', ""n't"", 'go', 'just', 'sits', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'further', 'started', 'feel', 'more', 'catchy', 'liked', 'cat', 'played', 'relationship', 'dog', 'cat', 'dogs', 'other', 'dogs', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'humans', 'Why', 'are', 'second', 'main', 'actors', 'other', 'movies', 'wanted', 'something', 'new', 'instead', 'basically', 'same', 'plot', 'just', 'better', 'animation', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'main', 'dog', 'character', 'Marmaduke', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'kids', 'Marmaduke', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'Honestly', 'liked', 'cat', 'more', 'rescue', 'dog', 'caught', 'more', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'only', 'Marmaduke', 'was', 'always', 'goofing', 'other', 'dogs', 'other', 'movies', 'hit', 'point', 'movie', 'where', 'Marmaduke', 'met', 'other', 'dogs', 'felt', 'giving', '3-4', 'stars', 'finally', 'drama', 'moment', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'Just', 'other', 'movie', 'Well', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'when', 'agreed', 'giving', '5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'greedy', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'Therefore', 'still', 'gave', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Having had three of them at one time or another, I can definitely guarantee it.  Seeing Marmaduke sit on the couch, like a human would do, reminded me so much of my first Dane, Courageous who used to sit side by side with me watching TV.  Even the fictional character's unwillingness to engage in a fight with another dog was so like my dogs.  It was sort of ""let's discuss this"" with Courageous.  Even the dominant dog in the park scene was familiar.  I took my dog Tempo to a dog park starting as a puppy.  A cane corso mounted him every time to prove he was dominant over Tempo.  Then one day he walked up to Tempo, saw that his butt was actually too high up off the ground to actually even attempt it, and just walked away.  After that it never came up again.  Taking the human for a walk, even the complaints about hearing the comments about ""where's the saddle?"" all the time are also familiar!  For anyone who has never had the blessing of being loved by one of these wonderful animals, this is a perfect introduction.

That's when the fun begins.Like others, I can't really associate this movie with the comic strip I read growing up. Mainly because Marmaduke from the comic strip never spoke a word.

Also, Carlos (the fluffy cat voiced by George Lopez) was hardly in the movie?? I have the same problem with the ""Chupadogra"" character (Sam Elliot).  The viewer gets one lecture from Chupadogra then that's it??  Plus, like other reviewers, why did the movie start and end with a fart joke??  Is that the movie's idea of coming full circle???

1307305,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG98DC,C. Sawin,"[3, 5]","Talking dogs must be Hollywood's formulaic answer to attempting to pull a family friendly blockbuster out of thin air. Nearly every live action film featuring a talking dog seems to play out similarly or at least have all the same big moments. Underdog, Scooby Doo, and the Cats & Dogs movies are all guilty of this. We see the dog(s) living it up while partaking in whatever activity they do best, things eventually go wrong, dog learns its lesson, dog does some sort of selfless act that ends up saving the day, and then there's a big, overblown, CGI infested finale featuring something like flying dogs, dancing dogs, dogs using jet packs, or something equally as unbelievable. So in walks a clumsy dog named Marmaduke that follows in the same pawprints of every dog related film before it.The special effects don't really have any redeeming qualities about them. It's like the people who keep doing these types of movies never learn that a completely computer generated animal looks terrible when it's thrown in the real world. Marmaduke does use real animals the majority of the time, but the way the animals talk looks pretty bad. Some animals look better when they talk (Mazie) than others (Marmaduke), but it still looks awkward. It's as if they just move the bottom lip of the animal while stretching or shrinking its eyes to portray emotion. It's like a visual aid for abusive use of botox on animals or something. Not to mention they always decide to blow everything out of proportion in movies like this. It's like they have more of the budget at that point of the movie than they originally intended and they come up with this outrageous scheme to have something to appeal to younger audiences, but dog surfing and choreographed dance featuring large groups of dogs? It's not amusing, especially when you can tell it's not real animals being used. The CG is weak all around though. It's subtle when it's used to make animals talk, but it looks forced and it feels overdone in the scenes that lean on CG to be successful. There's no happy middle ground.I hope you're a fan of bad puns. Marmaduke is practically overflowing with them. Twist my paw (arm), off the leash (chain), bone-illionaire, barkanova, chupadogra, and licking butt. Just when you think you've heard the worst one, three more pop up just as bad or worse. The cast is also filled to the brim with people overacting the entire time. Most of the actors involved probably won't be too shocking; Owen Wilson, George Lopez, and a few of the Wayans taking part sounds about right. Kiefer Sutherland playing Bosco was a bit of a shock though. Lee Pace having a large role in the movie was, too. The guy was so promising in ""Pushing Daisies"" and The Fall. It's disappointing to see him reduced to this. At least William H. Macy manages to act like himself in this.I wouldn't suggest actually thinking about the story points either. It's pretty brainless. The dog park being like a high school for dogs is probably around the time you'll want to jump out of the nearest window. Then there's the dogs playing Dance Dance Revolution and dogs making gopher and horse noises. It's just hard to imagine anyone finding something so lame entertaining at all. Also, seriously, this is like the third family movie I've watched in a row featuring a heavy emphasis on urine. Is urine funny now? The whole concept seems really disgusting to me, especially since Marmaduke makes it a point to circle back around to the subject several times. The farting scenes probably didn't help matters either.Marmaduke is just a really unpleasant excuse of a family movie. It's clich&eacute; and predictable, littered with overacting, filled with just the worst puns imaginable and borderline obscene when it comes to the amount of animal bodily fluids used throughout the movie. It's very Beethoven in tone, but even goofier and more melodramatic. Even though Marmaduke feels like every other live action talking dog film before it, the cast also feels worn out even though they all seem relatively new to being exposed to this level of atrocity. Delivering a journey that is both dull and agonizing with a destination that could barely be considered lukewarm, you'll be begging for Marmaduke to be put down long before he even has the chance to breakdance (I wish I was making that part up...).",1,"Filled with urine and generic effects, Marmaduke is a bust",1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,4341,"['Talking', 'dogs', 'must', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'formulaic', 'answer', 'attempting', 'pull', 'family', 'friendly', 'blockbuster', 'thin', 'air', 'Nearly', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'featuring', 'talking', 'dog', 'play', 'out', 'similarly', 'least', 'have', 'same', 'big', 'moments', 'Underdog', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'movies', 'are', 'guilty', 'see', 'dog', 'living', 'up', 'partaking', 'activity', 'do', 'best', 'things', 'eventually', 'go', 'wrong', 'dog', 'lesson', 'dog', 'sort', 'selfless', 'act', 'up', 'saving', 'day', 'then', 'big', 'overblown', 'CGI', 'infested', 'finale', 'featuring', 'something', 'flying', 'dogs', 'dancing', 'dogs', 'dogs', 'using', 'jet', 'packs', 'something', 'equally', 'unbelievable', 'So', 'walks', 'clumsy', 'dog', 'named', 'Marmaduke', 'same', 'pawprints', 'dog', 'related', 'film', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'people', 'who', 'keep', 'doing', 'types', 'movies', 'never', 'learn', 'completely', 'computer', 'generated', 'animal', 'looks', 'terrible', 'when', 'thrown', 'real', 'world', 'Marmaduke', 'use', 'real', 'animals', 'majority', 'time', 'way', 'animals', 'talk', 'pretty', 'bad', 'animals', 'look', 'better', 'when', 'talk', 'Mazie', 'others', 'Marmaduke', 'still', 'awkward', 'just', 'move', 'bottom', 'lip', 'animal', 'stretching', 'shrinking', 'eyes', 'portray', 'emotion', 'visual', 'aid', 'abusive', 'use', 'botox', 'animals', 'something', 'Not', 'mention', 'always', 'decide', 'blow', 'everything', 'proportion', 'movies', 'have', 'more', 'budget', 'point', 'movie', 'originally', 'intended', 'come', 'up', 'outrageous', 'scheme', 'have', 'something', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audiences', 'dog', 'surfing', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'featuring', 'large', 'groups', 'dogs', 'not', 'amusing', 'especially', 'when', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'real', 'animals', 'being', 'used', 'CG', 'weak', 'subtle', 'when', 'used', 'make', 'animals', 'talk', 'forced', 'overdone', 'scenes', 'lean', 'CG', 'be', 'successful', 'happy', 'middle', 'ground.I', 'hope', ""'re"", 'fan', 'bad', 'puns', 'Marmaduke', 'practically', 'overflowing', 'Twist', 'paw', 'arm', 'off', 'leash', 'chain', 'bone-illionaire', 'barkanova', 'chupadogra', 'licking', 'butt', 'Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'worst', 'one', 'three', 'more', 'pop', 'up', 'just', 'bad', 'worse', 'cast', 'also', 'filled', 'brim', 'people', 'overacting', 'entire', 'time', 'Most', 'actors', 'involved', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'shocking', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'George', 'Lopez', 'few', 'Wayans', 'taking', 'part', 'about', 'right', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'playing', 'Bosco', 'was', 'bit', 'shock', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'having', 'large', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'guy', 'was', 'so', 'promising', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', 'Fall', 'disappointing', 'see', 'reduced', 'least', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'act', 'this.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'actually', 'thinking', 'story', 'points', 'pretty', 'brainless', 'dog', 'park', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'dogs', 'probably', 'time', ""'ll"", 'want', 'jump', 'nearest', 'window', 'Then', 'dogs', 'playing', 'Dance', 'Dance', 'Revolution', 'dogs', 'making', 'gopher', 'horse', 'noises', 'just', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'finding', 'something', 'so', 'lame', 'entertaining', 'Also', 'seriously', 'third', 'family', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'row', 'featuring', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'urine', 'urine', 'funny', 'now', 'whole', 'concept', 'really', 'disgusting', 'especially', 'Marmaduke', 'point', 'circle', 'back', 'subject', 'several', 'times', 'farting', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'either.Marmaduke', 'just', 'really', 'unpleasant', 'excuse', 'family', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'littered', 'overacting', 'filled', 'just', 'worst', 'puns', 'imaginable', 'borderline', 'obscene', 'when', 'amount', 'animal', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'used', 'movie', 'very', 'Beethoven', 'tone', 'even', 'goofier', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'Even', 'Marmaduke', 'feels', 'other', 'live', 'action', 'talking', 'dog', 'film', 'cast', 'also', 'worn', 'out', 'even', 'seem', 'relatively', 'new', 'being', 'exposed', 'level', 'atrocity', 'Delivering', 'journey', 'dull', 'agonizing', 'destination', 'could', 'barely', 'be', 'considered', 'lukewarm', ""'ll"", 'be', 'begging', 'Marmaduke', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'long', 'even', 'chance', 'breakdance', 'wish', 'was', 'making', 'part']",N/A

It is a film that can be watched again and again.  It is a family film that kids will enjoy, but not only.  When you are stressed, tired, angry, down, or just plain not interested in thinking about something deep - car crashes, homicide, rape, or the state of the economy for example - this is the film to watch.  Of course it helps if you are an animal lover - actually that is probably a necessity.  Essentially it is about a Great Dane (Marmaduke) played by a real live Great Dane (probably Danes), which is a real trick since they are stubborn, thick headed, and most reluctant to obey on command.  The surrounding cast is also played by real live cat and dogs with the voices well syncronized to the action.  Marmaduke is anything but and alpha male and .. well, see the film and enjoy!

I've never actually read any of the comics, so I can't compare it. Marmaduke is a huge Great Dane that lives with the Winslow family. They soon move to California, and it gives Marmaduke a chance to reinvent himself. At the dog park, he makes friends with Mazie, Guiseppe, and Raisin. He also makes an enemy with Bosco, who is very controlling and jealous when it comes to Jezebel. Eventually, he'll have to decide who truly are his friends. It gets a little emotional toward the end.

1307336,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG98DC,Turfseer,"[0, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Since I'm a big dog lover (and I loved 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua'), I had great expectations for 'Marmaduke'. It's based on a well-known comic strip but isn't as intense as 'Chihuahua'. The plot focuses on Phil, a marketing consultant, who moves his family from Kansas to Orange County, California after being hired by Don Twombly (William H. Macy), owner of Bark Organics, a new age pet food company. Phil owns the star of the film, a Great Dane named Marmaduke (who speaks to the film audience but cannot be heard by the characters in the film). Marmaduke the film is less sophisticated than 'Chihuahua' since its human antagonist, Twombly, is a wacky passive-aggressive type as opposed to the more realistic, sinister gang member/dog napper in Beverly Hills Chihuahua (BHC).Just like in BHC, Marmaduke, our dog protagonist, is opposed by an aggressive and intimidating canine, Bosco (a Beauceron). Phil's internal arc is linked to Marmaduke's as they both make the mistake of becoming social climbers and turn their back on family and friends. In Phil's case, he comes up with an ad campaign involving a dog surfing contest, designed to attract Petco as a possible buyer of Bark Organic pet food. Phil becomes so involved in his job that he doesn't pay enough attention to his children.Meanwhile, Marmaduke is trying to impress Bosco's girlfriend, a beautiful collie named Jezebel, by staging a fight with his cat friend, Carlos, at a dog park (George Lopez voices Carlos and also can be heard as a canine sidekick in BHC). Soon afterward, Marmaduke wins the dog surfing contest but alienates the Petco executives when he gets into a fight with Bosco.Things only get worse for the human and dog protagonists. Marmaduke's mixed breed friends which include Mazie (who jealously watches from afar when Marmaduke goes on a 'dream date' with Jezebel) Raisin, a brainy Dachshund with an English accent and Giuseppe, a fearful Chinese crested pooch, boycott the party he throws for the pedigree dogs from the dog park. After Bosco exposes the link between Carlos and Marmaduke, the uppity pedigree dogs led by Bosco, trash Phil's house and leave Marmaduke with a shattered ego. Crushed by the rejection by those who he considered his friends, Marmaduke runs off to the woods where he meets a dog in the wild, Chupadogra, an old English Mastiff who is reputed to have killed his owner.Chupadogra reinforces the theme of the movie: never judge a book by its cover. Chupadogra, in actuality, was the leader of a pack of strays who abandoned him. He's not as scary once you get to know him and ends up saving Marmaduke by chasing off a rather unpleasant dog catcher. Meanwhile, Phil returns from his work/vacation and promptly drops his laptop in the backyard pool which contains his final ad campaign to woo Petco.Phil finally realizes that he has betrayed his values and tells Don he can't attend the big meeting with Petco since he has to find the lost Marmaduke. In a dramatic denouement, Phil saves Marmaduke from drowning after he falls into a rainwater conduit and is swept away by raging waters. Marmaduke too sees the light by returning to the dog park, speaks out against prejudice (he argues mixed breeds are just as good as pedigrees) and wins over all the dogs, except for Bosco who exits, vowing revenge.Unlike BHC, where I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes, 'Marmaduke' will not have you rolling on the floor. A lot of the jokes are pretty corny (especially the bit about Marmaduke farting). Nonetheless, at its core, 'Marmaduke' has a positive message in its rejection of careerism and the need for tolerance between people who come from diverse backgrounds.",3,Talking dogs provide corny but wholesome family entertainment,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,3714,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Since', ""'m"", 'big', 'dog', 'lover', 'loved', ""'Beverly"", 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', ""'Marmaduke"", 'based', 'well-known', 'comic', 'strip', ""n't"", 'as', 'intense', ""'Chihuahua"", 'plot', 'Phil', 'marketing', 'consultant', 'who', 'family', 'Kansas', 'Orange', 'County', 'California', 'being', 'hired', 'Don', 'Twombly', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'owner', 'Bark', 'Organics', 'new', 'age', 'pet', 'food', 'company', 'Phil', 'star', 'film', 'Great', 'Dane', 'named', 'Marmaduke', 'who', 'film', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'heard', 'characters', 'film', 'Marmaduke', 'film', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'human', 'antagonist', 'Twombly', 'wacky', 'passive-aggressive', 'type', 'opposed', 'more', 'realistic', 'sinister', 'gang', 'member/dog', 'napper', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', 'BHC', '.Just', 'BHC', 'Marmaduke', 'dog', 'protagonist', 'opposed', 'aggressive', 'intimidating', 'canine', 'Bosco', 'Beauceron', 'Phil', 'internal', 'arc', 'linked', 'Marmaduke', 'make', 'mistake', 'becoming', 'social', 'climbers', 'turn', 'back', 'family', 'friends', 'Phil', 'case', 'up', 'ad', 'campaign', 'involving', 'dog', 'surfing', 'contest', 'designed', 'attract', 'Petco', 'possible', 'buyer', 'Bark', 'Organic', 'pet', 'food', 'Phil', 'so', 'involved', 'job', ""n't"", 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'children.Meanwhile', 'Marmaduke', 'trying', 'impress', 'Bosco', 'girlfriend', 'beautiful', 'collie', 'named', 'Jezebel', 'staging', 'fight', 'cat', 'friend', 'Carlos', 'dog', 'park', 'George', 'Lopez', 'voices', 'Carlos', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'canine', 'sidekick', 'BHC', 'Soon', 'afterward', 'Marmaduke', 'dog', 'surfing', 'contest', 'Petco', 'executives', 'when', 'fight', 'Bosco.Things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'human', 'dog', 'protagonists', 'Marmaduke', 'mixed', 'breed', 'friends', 'include', 'Mazie', 'who', 'jealously', 'afar', 'when', 'Marmaduke', ""'dream"", 'date', 'Jezebel', 'Raisin', 'brainy', 'Dachshund', 'English', 'accent', 'Giuseppe', 'fearful', 'Chinese', 'crested', 'pooch', 'party', 'pedigree', 'dogs', 'dog', 'park', 'Bosco', 'link', 'Carlos', 'Marmaduke', 'uppity', 'pedigree', 'dogs', 'led', 'Bosco', 'trash', 'Phil', 'house', 'leave', 'Marmaduke', 'shattered', 'ego', 'Crushed', 'rejection', 'who', 'considered', 'friends', 'Marmaduke', 'woods', 'where', 'dog', 'wild', 'Chupadogra', 'old', 'English', 'Mastiff', 'who', 'reputed', 'have', 'killed', 'owner.Chupadogra', 'theme', 'movie', 'never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Chupadogra', 'actuality', 'was', 'leader', 'pack', 'strays', 'who', 'abandoned', 'not', 'scary', 'get', 'know', 'up', 'saving', 'Marmaduke', 'chasing', 'off', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'dog', 'catcher', 'Meanwhile', 'Phil', 'work/vacation', 'promptly', 'laptop', 'backyard', 'pool', 'final', 'ad', 'campaign', 'woo', 'Petco.Phil', 'finally', 'betrayed', 'values', 'tells', 'Don', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attend', 'big', 'meeting', 'Petco', 'find', 'lost', 'Marmaduke', 'dramatic', 'denouement', 'Phil', 'Marmaduke', 'drowning', 'rainwater', 'conduit', 'swept', 'away', 'raging', 'waters', 'Marmaduke', 'too', 'light', 'returning', 'dog', 'park', 'out', 'prejudice', 'mixed', 'breeds', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'pedigrees', 'dogs', 'Bosco', 'who', 'vowing', 'revenge.Unlike', 'BHC', 'where', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'jokes', ""'Marmaduke"", 'will', 'not', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'lot', 'jokes', 'are', 'pretty', 'corny', 'especially', 'bit', 'Marmaduke', 'farting', 'Nonetheless', 'core', ""'Marmaduke"", 'positive', 'message', 'rejection', 'careerism', 'need', 'tolerance', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'diverse', 'backgrounds']",N/A

1307338,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002ZG98DC,Z Hayes,"[21, 26]","This summer, we took our five-and-a-half year old to watch several kid friendly movies such asHow to Train Your Dragon (Single Disc Edition),Toy Story 3, Shrek 4, etc. It is rather difficult to find a movie that a child and adults can enjoy together. When ""Marmaduke"" popped up at our local dollar movie theater, we decided to give it a try after receiving positive feedback from our friends with kids.I can't really compare this movie with the comic strip which I grew up with. The writers have definitely used some creative license with the plot. Here, Marmaduke the Great Dane (voiced by Owen Wilson) is living happily in Kansas with his human family, the Winslows when Phil Winslow (Lee Pace) gets offered a promising new job with Bark Organics in the OC, California. The rest of the family is reluctant to make the big move but they do it anyway. Marmaduke finds himself in strange new surroundings, and discovers how even dogs' lives can be complicated with a social divide between the pedigrees, led by Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend Jezebel (Fergie) and the non-pedigree breeds aka mutts such as Maizie (Emma Stone),Raisin and Giuseppe. Marmaduke falls hard for Jezebel and inevitably ends up in a pickle when he attempts to be something he is not in a bid to win Jezebel's affections and gain the respect of the other dogs.The human-centered plot is secondary to the dog-centered story, mainly revolving around Phil's attempts to please his demanding, eccentric boss (played by William Macy) and balancing the demands of work and family, which Phil fails at miserably.The action is fast-paced so the youngsters in the audience don't get a chance to get fidgety (a great plus!), but the story is rather derivative and if you have high expectations for a well-plotted, intelligent movie then this is not it. On the other hand, if you just want to watch a fun movie with lots of dogs (many different breeds, and lots of well-groomed beautiful dogs such as Afghan hounds, etc.) then this might just entertain. It kept our daughter's attention and oh, we also loved Marmaduke's step-brother Carlos the Cat (George Lopez) and the Chupadogra (voiced by Sam Elliott)!",3,"Fun and family-friendly movie, especially for those who love dogs",1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,2182,"['summer', 'took', 'five-and-a-half', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'several', 'kid', 'friendly', 'movies', 'such', 'asHow', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Single', 'Disc', 'Edition', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Shrek', '4', 'etc', 'rather', 'difficult', 'find', 'movie', 'child', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'When', 'Marmaduke', 'popped', 'up', 'local', 'dollar', 'movie', 'theater', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'receiving', 'positive', 'feedback', 'friends', 'kids.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'movie', 'comic', 'strip', 'grew', 'up', 'writers', 'have', 'definitely', 'used', 'creative', 'license', 'plot', 'Here', 'Marmaduke', 'Great', 'Dane', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'living', 'happily', 'Kansas', 'human', 'family', 'Winslows', 'when', 'Phil', 'Winslow', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'offered', 'promising', 'new', 'job', 'Bark', 'Organics', 'OC', 'California', 'rest', 'family', 'reluctant', 'make', 'big', 'move', 'do', 'anyway', 'Marmaduke', 'strange', 'new', 'surroundings', 'how', 'even', 'dogs', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'complicated', 'social', 'divide', 'pedigrees', 'led', 'Bosco', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'girlfriend', 'Jezebel', 'Fergie', 'non-pedigree', 'breeds', 'aka', 'mutts', 'such', 'Maizie', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Raisin', 'Giuseppe', 'Marmaduke', 'hard', 'Jezebel', 'inevitably', 'up', 'pickle', 'when', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'bid', 'win', 'Jezebel', 'affections', 'gain', 'respect', 'other', 'dogs.The', 'human-centered', 'plot', 'secondary', 'dog-centered', 'story', 'mainly', 'revolving', 'Phil', 'attempts', 'please', 'demanding', 'eccentric', 'boss', 'played', 'William', 'Macy', 'balancing', 'demands', 'work', 'family', 'Phil', 'miserably.The', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'youngsters', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'fidgety', 'great', 'story', 'rather', 'derivative', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'well-plotted', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'then', 'not', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'fun', 'movie', 'lots', 'dogs', 'many', 'different', 'breeds', 'lots', 'well-groomed', 'beautiful', 'dogs', 'such', 'Afghan', 'etc', 'then', 'might', 'just', 'entertain', 'kept', 'daughter', 'attention', 'oh', 'also', 'loved', 'Marmaduke', 'step-brother', 'Carlos', 'Cat', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Chupadogra', 'voiced', 'Sam', 'Elliott']",N/A
