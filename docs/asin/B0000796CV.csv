725214,A3QCYYGURVRKV7,B0000796CV,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","...I bought my copy of Father Ted Vol. 3 from Amazon.com, and I've watched it almost everyday since it arrived in the post.  I've collected all three of the Father Ted DVD sets, and I must say that this is the best.  The discs contain 9 episodes of Father Ted and happily two are my very favorite of the entire series, ""Are You Right There,  Father Ted?"" and ""Speed 3"".  I watch these episodes all the time and I laugh just as hard everytime!  In ""Are You There, Father Ted?"", Father Ted accidently offends the Chinese community on Craggy Island, and everytime he attempts to apologize, something happens to make matters worse!  Of course, that's what's expected in the life of Father Ted.  And in ""Speed 3"", Father Ted discovers that the local milkman, has been having improper relations with the women on Craggy Island and has him fired.  The vengful milkman attaches a bomb to the bottom of the milkcar that Father Dougal has taken upon himself to takeover.  The bomb is activated when the milkcar goes over 4 mph, and it's up to Father Ted to save Father Dougal.  Yes, it is as silly as it sounds which makes it so funny!The picture of the DVD is crystal clear and the sound is perfect.  Also, there are tons of Special Features offered on the second DVD that will keep you laughing for ages.  The only disappointment is know that there will be no more Father Ted since the sudden passing of Dermot Morgan, who played Father Ted Crilly. However, thankfully we fans have him forever or these wonderful DVD's to keep us laughing for years to come and remember the joy and laughter he brought to us.",5,The Best DVD Volume Set of Father Ted!!!,1049414400,"04 4, 2003",2003,1600,"['bought', 'copy', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Vol', '3', 'Amazon.com', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'almost', 'everyday', 'arrived', 'post', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'three', 'Father', 'Ted', 'DVD', 'sets', 'must', 'say', 'best', 'discs', 'contain', '9', 'episodes', 'Father', 'Ted', 'happily', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'favorite', 'entire', 'series', 'Are', 'Right', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Speed', '3', 'watch', 'episodes', 'time', 'laugh', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'everytime', 'Are', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Father', 'Ted', 'accidently', 'Chinese', 'community', 'Craggy', 'Island', 'everytime', 'apologize', 'something', 'happens', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'course', 'what', 'expected', 'life', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Speed', '3', 'Father', 'Ted', 'local', 'milkman', 'been', 'having', 'improper', 'relations', 'women', 'Craggy', 'Island', 'fired', 'vengful', 'milkman', 'bomb', 'bottom', 'milkcar', 'Father', 'Dougal', 'taken', 'upon', 'takeover', 'bomb', 'activated', 'when', 'milkcar', '4', 'mph', 'up', 'Father', 'Ted', 'save', 'Father', 'Dougal', 'Yes', 'as', 'silly', 'so', 'funny', 'picture', 'DVD', 'crystal', 'clear', 'sound', 'perfect', 'Also', 'are', 'tons', 'Special', 'Features', 'offered', 'second', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'ages', 'only', 'disappointment', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'Father', 'Ted', 'sudden', 'passing', 'Dermot', 'Morgan', 'who', 'played', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Crilly', 'However', 'thankfully', 'fans', 'have', 'forever', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'keep', 'laughing', 'years', 'come', 'remember', 'joy', 'laughter', 'brought']",Father Ted - Complete Series 3

725216,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B0000796CV,"B-MAN ""B""","[45, 46]","Finally the long awaited final season of Father Ted comes to DVD! Season 3 originally aired from March to May 1998 and it is just as strong as Seasons 1 & 2 in writing, laughs, and brilliant performances by Dermot Morgan (Ted), Ardal O'Hanlon (Dougal), Frank Kelly (Jack), and Pauline McLynn (Mrs. Doyle).  Its obvious that Father Ted would not have ended as soon as it did if not for the unfortunate and untimely passing of Dermot Morgan (1952-1998) at age 45.  Its also completely understandable that the show could not continue without him.  Father Ted is one of the most original and hilarious sitcoms ever and like another sitcom on BBC video, Black Adder, it accomplished more in its 24 episodes than countless other sitcoms did in hundred episode runs: Brilliant writing and laughs that only increase with each episode.  God Bless Father Ted and all those involved in creating this masterpiece.  The season 3 DVD set consists of 2 DVDs with all 8 episodes.  I'm also very happy to say that the '96 Christmas special is also included which was recently released in the U.K. as a separate DVD!  Here's the episodes on this set:1. Are you right there, Father Ted?2. Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep3. Speed 34. The Mainland5. Escape from Victory6. Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse7. Night of the Nearly Dead8.

GOING TO AMERICA is a fitting finale, with a montage of previous episodes as tribute to Dermot Morgan who died after filming finished.The humour is quite layered (like the Simpsons) with subtle satirical references to the Church as well as good old fashioned slapstick (Father Jack throwing his 'pet' brick at Father Ted's head).This is the most innovative comedy ever on British TV, with good old fashioned sit-com values, but with a touch of surrealism - buy it today!",5,I don't believe it!,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,826,"['Sadly', 'last', 'series', 'Father', 'Ted', 'eight', 'episodes', 'general', 'six', 'second', 'series', 'had', 'ten', 'episodes', 'confusing', 'Dougal', 'would', 'say', '.My', 'favourites', 'are', 'MAINLAND', 'where', 'Ted', 'Dougal', 'get', 'stuck', 'old', 'caves', 'SPEED', '3', 'where', 'Dougal', 'temporary', 'milkman', 'milkfloat', 'can', 'not', 'go', '4', 'miles', 'hour', 'GOING', 'TO', 'AMERICA', 'fitting', 'finale', 'montage', 'previous', 'episodes', 'tribute', 'Dermot', 'Morgan', 'who', 'died', 'filming', 'finished.The', 'humour', 'quite', 'layered', 'Simpsons', 'subtle', 'satirical', 'references', 'Church', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'slapstick', 'Father', 'Jack', 'throwing', ""'pet"", 'brick', 'Father', 'Ted', 'head', '.This', 'most', 'innovative', 'comedy', 'ever', 'British', 'TV', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sit-com', 'values', 'touch', 'surrealism', 'buy', 'today']",Father Ted - Complete Series 3

While possibly not quite as great as the second series, the series still bows out on a high note, as Father Ted himself  (Dermot Morgan) died right after the season was shot - a poignant montage of highlights from all three series marks the end of the last episode, a fitting way to make his legacy.None of this should overshadow 8 brilliant half hours that range from farcical to surreal.  The running &quot;phone&quot; jokes from the second series are largely absent, but a bunch of old characters re-appear.  Perhaps the best episode is Speed 3, where Dougal must keep a milk float above 4 mph or be blown to pieces (&quot;The Poseidon Adventure - there was a priest in that!&quot;).The second DVD includes the 1996 Christmas special, an hour-long episode that is equally hilarious -although at times one does get the feeling that the writers are knowingly stretching some jokes to fill time (a la the Simpsons), for example at the start when Ted opens the door to find a baby that has been left there by mistake and then the mother comes an picks it up &quot;Oh can you imagine us looking after a baby?

Father Ted ran for three seasons for a total of 25 episodes. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo. The frame is 1.33:1. It is unknown if Season three was supposed to be another Season one with a shorter run of 6 episodes or 10 episodes as Season two did. In the end we get 8 episodes of Season three. ""Are You Right There, Father Ted?"" has Ted accidentally appearing looking like Hitler after he is mistaken by a local Chinese community as a fascist. ""Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep"" is the King of the Sheep 98' competition. If you like sheep you will like this one. ""Speed 3"" may be one of the funniest television episodes ever when Dougal's milk float is rigged to explode if he drops below 4 mph. This episode is widely considered one of the best, if the not the best comedy TV instalments ever aired. ""The Mainland"" sees Ted & co. leaving Craggy Island for a trip when all hell breaks loose. Jack goes to an AA meeting! If you want to see a 5 a side - over 75 - football match then look no further than ""Escape from Victory"". Will Ted's fake rubber arms fool the referee? ""Kicking Bishop Brennan up the A*se"" is exactly what it means. Here Ted in a forfeit to Dick Burn must kick Bishop Brennan while Dougal takes the photograph. It is a gem in the series. ""Night of the Nearly Dead"" is a pull on the Irish singer Daniel O' Donnel who is loved by all women over the age of 50. Here he visits Craggy Island to see Mrs. Doyle only for Ted to find that the house is under siege by the elderly-zombies who are dying to see their favorite singer. ""Going to America"" is the final episode of the series. Her Ted is offered his own parish in California which he thinks he can cash in on. The only catch is that he can't take Dougle, Jack or Mrs. Doyle with him. It ends with a lovely montage of all the episodes. It appears that this episode may have been the last one on the schedule to be shot and that there was talk that Father Ted would end with this season. After shooting Dermot Morgan (Father Ted) announced that ""I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years."" This was taken to mean that effectively the Father Ted series had finished. He said that he was working on a new comedy television series. It is believed that this would be about two retired football players living together, but just weeks before the first episode of Season three was to air, during a dinner party in his home, Dermot Morgan had a sudden massive heart attack and died. He was only 45. It seems that the ending of last episode of Season three is still cut short as if something has been removed and the montage put in instead. It actually ends on a sort of a sad note, happy, but sad and a tribute to this great character, man and series.
