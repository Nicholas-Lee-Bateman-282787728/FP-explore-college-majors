394084,AKMXCZXE0KD5H,6303980368,"Golden Girls fan ""Adam""","[11, 11]","As a writer I can clearly understand the world Janet Frame lived in growing up. I myself was sent to a shrink for being a writer as well as for being shy and introverted. However, this is an outstanding drama of human  proportions. It echoes forthcoming images of what Campion did with  &quot;The Piano&quot; three years after she made this film. The life of  Janet Frame is beautifully realized from her youthful days with a  lower-class family, suffering heartbreak, loss, labeled as insane, and  finding ultimate redemption in her talent as a writer. The film explores  both her personal and social conflicts as well as with the men who changed  her life and stirred her emotions. Very few writers and directors can ever  tell a story so vividly real and powerful as Campion and Laura Jones have  done here. It should offer hope and strength to those who have great dreams  of success in this life yet feel mowed down by overnight sensations and  those who threaten to tear down their goals. The music score adds to the  emotion this film evokes. The world of a writer was never more stunningly  pictured than how it is here. I highly recommend this film, especially to  my fellow writers out there in this world. It is a gem of a film from one  of the most gifted writers and directors our movie industry has ever known.",5,"Stunning, hauntingly brilliant.",924480000,"04 19, 1999",1999,1324,"['writer', 'can', 'clearly', 'understand', 'world', 'Janet', 'Frame', 'lived', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'sent', 'shrink', 'being', 'writer', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'shy', 'introverted', 'However', 'outstanding', 'drama', 'human', 'proportions', 'forthcoming', 'images', 'what', 'Campion', 'did', 'quot', 'Piano', 'quot', 'three', 'years', 'made', 'film', 'life', 'Janet', 'Frame', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'youthful', 'days', 'lower-class', 'family', 'suffering', 'heartbreak', 'loss', 'labeled', 'insane', 'finding', 'ultimate', 'redemption', 'talent', 'writer', 'film', 'personal', 'social', 'conflicts', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'who', 'changed', 'life', 'stirred', 'emotions', 'Very', 'few', 'writers', 'directors', 'can', 'ever', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'vividly', 'real', 'powerful', 'Campion', 'Laura', 'Jones', 'have', 'done', 'here', 'should', 'offer', 'hope', 'strength', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'dreams', 'success', 'life', 'yet', 'feel', 'mowed', 'down', 'overnight', 'sensations', 'who', 'threaten', 'tear', 'down', 'goals', 'music', 'score', 'emotion', 'film', 'world', 'writer', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'stunningly', 'pictured', 'how', 'here', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'fellow', 'writers', 'out', 'there', 'world', 'gem', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'writers', 'directors', 'movie', 'industry', 'ever', 'known']",An Angel at My Table VHS
394085,A2R3FDDGZG7K9E,6303980368,I. Rodriguez,"[7, 7]","A unique and original work from a gifted film artist. It tells the story of Janet Frame, one of New Zealand's most important writers. The film follows Janet's life from the time she's a small girl in school, trying to  buy friends with candy, to the adult, painfully shy introvert played by  Kerry Fox. It is an insightful look at the life of a woman who finally  learns to appreciate herself.

394086,A2T4MHPAV4HVLZ,6303980368,Kosovar,"[12, 17]","This movie broke my heart in pieces the first time I saw it. I haven't been informed about Janet Frame's life before and this movie based on her autobiographies gave me the big picture that I find it too difficult to put it out of my mind.Janet is lovely girl by all means, generous and caring to her friends, she has crooked teeth in her younger days but she was always an owner of a diamond heart. She was painfully shy too, and God knows how stupid people judged her as schizophrenic in the best days of her life. It was so scary to see stupid peoplediagnosing a genius as schizophrenic when it was them who shouldhave been diagnosed like that. Anyways,they took eight years of her life, best part of her life in hospitals with real mentally ill people. It's a wonder how did she manage to stay sane in those circumstances but she did.Today, Janet Frame is an old woman and I hope with all my heart that people will award her with a great world prize for the long eight years she spent in hospitals when nothing was wrong with her. She absolutely deserves some recognition as long as she's still alive.She has written so many books apart from her autobiographies and I love her with all my heart for setting a great example to humanity that GOOD PEOPLE will ALWAYS TRIUMPH (un)fortunetaly in the long run that is.A must see movie.",5,Get to know a remarkable woman,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,1333,"['movie', 'broke', 'heart', 'pieces', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'informed', 'Janet', 'Frame', 'life', 'before', 'movie', 'based', 'autobiographies', 'gave', 'big', 'picture', 'find', 'too', 'difficult', 'put', 'mind.Janet', 'lovely', 'girl', 'means', 'generous', 'caring', 'friends', 'crooked', 'teeth', 'younger', 'days', 'was', 'always', 'owner', 'diamond', 'heart', 'was', 'painfully', 'shy', 'too', 'God', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'judged', 'schizophrenic', 'best', 'days', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'scary', 'see', 'stupid', 'peoplediagnosing', 'genius', 'schizophrenic', 'when', 'was', 'who', 'shouldhave', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'Anyways', 'took', 'eight', 'years', 'life', 'best', 'part', 'life', 'hospitals', 'real', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'wonder', 'how', 'did', 'manage', 'stay', 'sane', 'circumstances', 'did.Today', 'Janet', 'Frame', 'old', 'woman', 'hope', 'heart', 'people', 'will', 'award', 'great', 'world', 'prize', 'long', 'eight', 'years', 'spent', 'hospitals', 'when', 'nothing', 'was', 'wrong', 'absolutely', 'recognition', 'as', 'long', 'still', 'alive.She', 'written', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'apart', 'autobiographies', 'love', 'heart', 'setting', 'great', 'example', 'humanity', 'GOOD', 'PEOPLE', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'TRIUMPH', 'un', 'fortunetaly', 'long', 'run', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",An Angel at My Table VHS

394088,A35NVOZDHB4NXN,6303980368,"""valeska_""","[26, 28]","Based on the autobiographies of  Janet Frame. And from director Jane Campion (The Piano)This is a wonderful portrait of the New Zealand author. Who was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic, she endured numerous treaments  of electric shock therapy (over 200!) Spent eight traumatic years in a mental institution. And came very close to having a lobotomy!It would be years before she would find the diagnosis of schizophrenia was wrong.This movie examines Janet's early life to adulthood. A very hard childhood hampered by poverty. And many tragedies. Her older sister, Myrtle, drowned when Janet was young. One of her other sisters Isabel died (also by drowning!) when Janet was in college. And her older brother suffered from epilesy. In a time when there was not more they could do about it. He often had seizures, made him a vulnerable target for bullies at school, and it left him unfit for most work. And Janet herself suffered with terribly painful decaying teeth, she had to have ALL of them pulled at a very young age.After her thankful release from the hospital she then went on a trip, first to England then to Spain. Where she met a young American poet, who she would formed her first relationship with.It is a long film, but don't let that discourage you. There is never a dull moment. It's a facinating story. It's visually beautiful. Filled with tragedy but also funny and wonderfully touching moments. And the performances are fabulous. About an incredible woman who wasn't schizophrenic...just ""different""It's always remained one of my favorite films, the kind I can watch over and over.",5,AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE,1028937600,"08 10, 2002",2002,1596,"['Based', 'autobiographies', 'Janet', 'Frame', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'Piano', 'wonderful', 'portrait', 'New', 'Zealand', 'author', 'Who', 'was', 'misdiagnosed', 'schizophrenic', 'endured', 'numerous', 'treaments', 'electric', 'shock', 'therapy', '200', 'Spent', 'eight', 'traumatic', 'years', 'mental', 'institution', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'having', 'lobotomy', 'would', 'be', 'years', 'would', 'find', 'diagnosis', 'schizophrenia', 'was', 'wrong.This', 'movie', 'Janet', 'early', 'life', 'adulthood', 'very', 'hard', 'childhood', 'hampered', 'poverty', 'many', 'tragedies', 'older', 'sister', 'Myrtle', 'drowned', 'when', 'Janet', 'was', 'young', 'One', 'other', 'sisters', 'Isabel', 'died', 'also', 'drowning', 'when', 'Janet', 'was', 'college', 'older', 'brother', 'suffered', 'epilesy', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'could', 'do', 'often', 'had', 'seizures', 'made', 'vulnerable', 'target', 'bullies', 'school', 'left', 'unfit', 'most', 'work', 'Janet', 'suffered', 'terribly', 'painful', 'decaying', 'teeth', 'had', 'have', 'pulled', 'very', 'young', 'age.After', 'thankful', 'release', 'hospital', 'then', 'went', 'trip', 'first', 'England', 'then', 'Spain', 'Where', 'met', 'young', 'American', 'poet', 'who', 'would', 'formed', 'first', 'relationship', 'with.It', 'long', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'facinating', 'story', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'Filled', 'tragedy', 'also', 'funny', 'wonderfully', 'touching', 'moments', 'performances', 'are', 'fabulous', 'incredible', 'woman', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'schizophrenic', 'just', 'different', 'always', 'remained', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'kind', 'can', 'watch']",An Angel at My Table VHS
