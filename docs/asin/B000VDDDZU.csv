I didn't see all the episodes while they were being aired on tv, so this is my first time watching a good many of them. I just received this a few days ago and have not even broken the seal yet.

I don't expect there is any chance that this series will ever be re-released in high definition, but if it is I will buy it all over again.

If CBS and Paramount have decided not to release future seasons because the current seasons are not selling, this is because the current seasons have been released in two volumes for twice the price of every other TV seasons out there (except pricy sci-fi sets).  Buying season 4 of Touched by an Angel in two volumes costs as much as buying two seasons of most other shows.  No wonder they aren't selling!

1100810,A3PHM3ANENDGCF,B000VDDDZU,The Red Aaron,"[17, 17]","Touched By An Angel is a show that can stand the test of time. For those that say the show is repetitive, they've missed the whole point and purpose of the show. The show dealt with the human condition, and I think touched based with every experience one could go through; always delivering the message that God loves us through it all. This is the second half of Season 4 with episode descriptions below. The season is thought to have been split because at it's height, the show was extremely popular and had numerous Promise Land crossover episodes, giving the season(s) an abnormal amount of episodes. The show hasn't been fairing as well financially as say Sex & The City or Lost so I encourage everyone to support and buy these season sets if they can. I enjoy and learn something from every episode I watch.14. Deconstructing HarryMonica and Tess arrive at the DMV where Tess has been instructed to obtain a driver's license. Her instructor is Doris (Lainie Kazan). Midway through the driving test, Doris tells Tess to follow a hearse, which leads them, both to the funeral of Harry Applegate. Doris enters the funeral and steals the ashes of her former lover with the wife chasing after them.15. The TriggerAs Monica gives Tess an ice skating lesson we meet the seemingly happy Craig family at the rink where the son, Alex is finishing hockey practice. This family is Monica's next assignment as she gets a lesson that things aren't always what they seem with the family.16. DoodlebugsAfter the death of his wife, small town miister Erskine gave up his ministry and his lack of faith has spread to the rest of the townspeople. His children, Andy & Bits are loners, not knowing who to turn to with their problems. But when a man says God miraculously helped him win the lottery over the phone the children wait by their phone to hear from God, and they miraculously get an answer!17. Redeeming LoveAs Monica and Tess take a walk through the city streets, they stumble across Monica's next assignment, a young woman sleeping under a pile of garbage. The woman's name is Lydia and while she is a tenderhearted person, she is a crack addict. After giving birth to an unexpected baby Monica and a choir of angels help Lydia through her 7 day withdrawal.18. Flights of AngelsRichard is an artist diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, a terminal sickness that has a debilitating effect on one's motor functions. Richard is in denial about the prognosis but his wife Sally is not, and she prays for guidance for her family. Richard is a painter and it's Andrews job not only to help him finish the painting but help him not take for granted the time he has left with his family.19. Breaking BreadA timid baker named Matt Colletti is closing up his bakery one evening when two white men attack his black assistant in the street. Matt witnesses the crime but is too frightened to come forward. Tess tells Monica that is their job to help him take a stand against the criminals, members of a white supremacist group.20. God and CountryRafael enters the army in an attempt to befriend a bitter soldier named Tomas. Tomas hates the army, in particular his commanding officer Colonel Victor Walls who the angels later find out is related to Tomas.21. How Do You Spell Faith?Monica and Tess arrive in the life of a single mother, Mary, to help her reconcile her relationship with her son Aaron. Herself a former athlete, Mary relates to her eldest son Michael, who is the star wrestler of Olympus High School. Aaron, on the contrary, is more cerebral and spends the majority of his time spelling out words to hide the pain he feels for not having a father and not being closer to his mother. When Michael (whom Aaron looks up to) dies, Aaron is distanced from his mother more than ever.22. Seek and Ye Shall FindCan Angels get amnesia? Well Monica does when she falls and hits her head outside a bus station in Savage, MI. Dr. Chester Crayton reluctantly treats Monica's injuries inside rather reluctantly.  The doctor is on the way to a prison to watch the execution of a man who murdered his wife, whom he cannot forgive.23. Cry, and You Cry AloneFour aging comics sit around a diner table reminiscing about their careers and celebrating the fact that one of them is soon to leave on a cruise ship gig. One of the men offers to tell the story of Salt and Pepper, a famous comic team who suddenly broke up before they hit it really big. In the story Monica is a waitress at a Diner who tries to bring Salt and Pepper back together.24. Perfect Little AngelMonica and Tess meet their next assignment, Tracy Beringer as she achieves some very bad news via a letter in her mailbox. When she sees an ad in the paper for the Miss Colorado pageant, she tries to sign up to raise money. But she is worried that she could be kicked out and forfeit the winnings if the information contained in the letter is discovered.25. ElijahJacob Weiss, a bitter slumlord, is sentenced to spend two weeks in one of his own tenements and the angels arrive to help him understand the error of his ways.26.  Last DanceThe pressure to abstain from sex before getting married is almost as great for teenagers Greg and Jill, as the pressure from their mothers to be perfect students. Jill's mother, Candace, still dealing with issues with her own past, demands complete chastity from her daughter. It is Monica and Tess' assignment to make sure these relationships don't self-destruct.27. The Spirit of Liberty MoonPerhaps the landmark episode of the series, The Spirit of Liberty Moon is a 2-hour special. The angels escort Edward Tanner CEO of Tanner Toys to China where Edward will decide if he should start manufacturing toys in Beijing. He brings along a worker, Jean Chang, who claims to be Korean but knows Chinese. After arriving in Beijing it is learned by the angels and Edward that Jean is really Chinese and searching for her husband, who got taken and ""reformed"" during the Cultural Revolution. Jean is considered an outlaw by the Chinese government and when taken and tortured Monica stays forever by her side. This episode is considered by many to be the most violent and the most heart-wrenching episode of the season.Touched By An Angel is a show for people of all ages and generations. It speaks of the unchanging truth that God loves and watches over us along with his angels.",5,Be Touched again this December!,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,6359,"['Touched', 'Angel', 'show', 'can',
