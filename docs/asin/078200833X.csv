40583,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,078200833X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Some will have trouble watching a film like `The Pawnbroker'.  If doesn't really seem to go much of anywhere.  This is not a film about a specific event as much as it is about one man's inner turmoil over events past.  This is the definition of a character study, and as such it can be slightly difficult to become absorbed in, considering that the character being studied is drenched in a coldness he uses as an escape from his own memory.  If one can get passed the idea of no real progression of events (although there is a subplot that permeates some of the air) then they'll be able to accept the film for the power it truly brings to the table.Sol Nazerman is a Nazi concentration camp survivor who has practically shut down from his life completely after losing everything he ever loved.  He's obviously years removed from the atrocities and yet he cannot let them go; but who could expect him to?  He runs a pawnshop in quiet desolation and hides his pain, or at least the painful memories themselves, from those around him.  He builds a wall that refuses to allow others inside, creating an icy demeanor that keeps him protected, in a way, from feeling the gut-wrenching pain he's already faced when he lost his wife and children.  Despite having those around him who either try to understand him or try to befriend him, he cannot and will not allow them to reside in his heart because he cannot face the prospect of losing again.Much has been said over the film's climax, which is tragic as much as it is bewildering.  In effect, the final frames encompass Sol's own acceptance of his current state and the realization that he has wounded himself even more by refusing to let anyone inside his heart.  Steiger's towering performance (his Oscar loss is a travesty) conveys so much emotional depth without overselling a single moment.  As he struggles to feel something, anything, his act of self-mutilation pulls the audience into his severe emotional state and allows us to bleed right alongside him.  His deadness is revealed as an emotional crutch and we see as his face contorts that he is trying desperately to let go of that crutch.The question still remains; was he able to?",5,Learning to walk on water...,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2190,"['will', 'have', 'trouble', 'watching', 'film', 'Pawnbroker', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'go', 'much', 'anywhere', 'not', 'film', 'specific', 'event', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'man', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'events', 'past', 'definition', 'character', 'study', 'such', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'difficult', 'become', 'absorbed', 'considering', 'character', 'being', 'studied', 'drenched', 'coldness', 'escape', 'own', 'memory', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'passed', 'idea', 'real', 'progression', 'events', 'subplot', 'air', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'film', 'power', 'truly', 'table.Sol', 'Nazerman', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivor', 'who', 'practically', 'shut', 'down', 'life', 'completely', 'losing', 'everything', 'ever', 'loved', 'obviously', 'years', 'removed', 'atrocities', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'who', 'could', 'expect', 'pawnshop', 'quiet', 'desolation', 'pain', 'least', 'painful', 'memories', 'wall', 'allow', 'others', 'creating', 'icy', 'demeanor', 'protected', 'way', 'feeling', 'gut-wrenching', 'pain', 'already', 'faced', 'when', 'lost', 'wife', 'children', 'having', 'who', 'try', 'understand', 'try', 'befriend', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'reside', 'heart', 'can', 'not', 'face', 'prospect', 'losing', 'again.Much', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'climax', 'tragic', 'as', 'much', 'bewildering', 'effect', 'final', 'frames', 'encompass', 'Sol', 'own', 'acceptance', 'current', 'state', 'realization', 'wounded', 'even', 'more', 'refusing', 'let', 'anyone', 'heart', 'Steiger', 'towering', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'loss', 'travesty', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'overselling', 'single', 'moment', 'feel', 'something', 'anything', 'act', 'self-mutilation', 'pulls', 'audience', 'severe', 'emotional', 'state', 'bleed', 'right', 'deadness', 'revealed', 'emotional', 'crutch', 'see', 'face', 'contorts', 'trying', 'desperately', 'let', 'go', 'crutch.The', 'question', 'still', 'was', 'able']",N/A
40584,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,078200833X,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 5]","In Sidney Lumet's THE PAWNBROKER (1964), Rod Steiger gives one of the greatest acting performances in cinematic history.At the story's outset, we see Sol Nazerman and family on an idyllic picnic. A lovely scene turns suddenly nightmarish when Nazis arrive to arrest them. This dream image crowds Sol's brain as the 25th anniversary of the terrible event approaches. With increasing frequency and unpredictability, Nazerman flashes back to witnessed or endured concentration camp horrors-- while they last these memories emotionally disable him.When not tortured by thoughts of Auschwitz, misanthropic Harlem pawnbroker Nazerman endures poverty-stricken, drunk or drugged-out customers, a street gang that boosts stolen items, and his pushy Hispanic assistant, Jesus Ortiz (Jaime S&aacute;nchez), who calls Sol 'Teacher,' a term the former professor hates. Lastly, there's 'Rodriguez' (Brock Peters), a local crime boss using Sol's shop to launder cash obtained through his cathouse.Sol's home life offers him little comfort. Second wife/ex-sister-in-law Tessie (Marketa Kimbrell) badgers him for enough money to take the family on an extended Continental tour. She fondly recalls Europe as having a ""certain atmosphere,"" but Sol's bitter response is he remembers that ""it stinks of death.""Tessie's elderly bed-ridden father, Baruch (played by director Lumet's dad) hates that Sol sleeps with his dead wife's sister, and his two teenaged kids are noisy, quarrelsome pains. Nazerman thus has no peace at home, or at work, or in the recesses of his own mind. A brief attempt to connect with social worker Marilyn Birchfield (Geraldine Fitzgerald) also fails.Mobster Rodriguez threatens painful death if Sol doesn't sign some illicit papers. Meanwhile, Ortiz orchestrates a closing-time robbery with the gang of thugs. When the heist ends in tragic violence, an unimaginable act of self-inflicted pain is probably Sol's last tenous hold on sanity and life itself.Steiger (as Sol) silently screaming in agony at this final straw that 'broke' him is something you will never forget. Zombie-like, he wanders from his still-open shop and shuffles past a crowd of onlookers, but where will the defeated Nazerman go, what will he do, and what does it matter to an unfortunate victim of the worst pain that life can inflict?Steiger got a Best Actor nod here, but lost. Two years later he did win forIN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, but this award may actually have been recognition for ""Pawnbroker,"" his very finest work.",5,"""I do not believe in God, or art, or science, or newspapers, or politics, or philosophy.""",1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2503,"['Sidney', 'Lumet', 'THE', 'PAWNBROKER', '1964', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'one', 'greatest', 'acting', 'performances', 'cinematic', 'history.At', 'story', 'outset', 'see', 'Sol', 'Nazerman', 'family', 'idyllic', 'picnic', 'lovely', 'scene', 'suddenly', 'nightmarish', 'when', 'Nazis', 'arrive', 'arrest', 'dream', 'image', 'Sol', 'brain', '25th', 'anniversary', 'terrible', 'event', 'approaches', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'unpredictability', 'Nazerman', 'back', 'witnessed', 'endured', 'concentration', 'camp', 'horrors', 'last', 'memories', 'emotionally', 'disable', 'him.When', 'not', 'tortured', 'thoughts', 'Auschwitz', 'misanthropic', 'Harlem', 'pawnbroker', 'Nazerman', 'poverty-stricken', 'drunk', 'drugged-out', 'customers', 'street', 'gang', 'stolen', 'items', 'pushy', 'Hispanic', 'assistant', 'Jesus', 'Ortiz', 'Jaime', 'S', 'aacute', 'who', 'Sol', ""'Teacher"", 'term', 'former', 'professor', 'hates', 'Lastly', ""'Rodriguez"", 'Brock', 'Peters', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'using', 'Sol', 'shop', 'launder', 'cash', 'obtained', 'cathouse.Sol', 'home', 'life', 'little', 'comfort', 'Second', 'wife/ex-sister-in-law', 'Tessie', 'Marketa', 'Kimbrell', 'enough', 'money', 'take', 'family', 'extended', 'Continental', 'tour', 'fondly', 'Europe', 'having', 'certain', 'atmosphere', 'Sol', 'bitter', 'response', 'death', 'Tessie', 'elderly', 'bed-ridden', 'father', 'Baruch', 'played', 'director', 'Lumet', 'dad', 'Sol', 'dead', 'wife', 'sister', 'two', 'teenaged', 'kids', 'are', 'noisy', 'quarrelsome', 'pains', 'Nazerman', 'thus', 'peace', 'home', 'work', 'recesses', 'own', 'mind', 'brief', 'attempt', 'connect', 'social', 'worker', 'Marilyn', 'Birchfield', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'also', 'fails.Mobster', 'Rodriguez', 'painful', 'death', 'Sol', ""n't"", 'sign', 'illicit', 'papers', 'Meanwhile', 'Ortiz', 'closing-time', 'robbery', 'gang', 'thugs', 'When', 'heist', 'tragic', 'violence', 'unimaginable', 'act', 'self-inflicted', 'pain', 'probably', 'Sol', 'last', 'tenous', 'hold', 'sanity', 'life', 'itself.Steiger', 'Sol', 'silently', 'screaming', 'agony', 'final', 'straw', ""'broke"", 'something', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Zombie-like', 'still-open', 'shop', 'shuffles', 'crowd', 'onlookers', 'where', 'will', 'defeated', 'Nazerman', 'go', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'matter', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'worst', 'pain', 'life', 'can', 'inflict', 'Steiger', 'got', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nod', 'here', 'lost', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'did', 'win', 'forIN', 'THE', 'HEAT', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'award', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'recognition', 'Pawnbroker', 'very', 'finest', 'work']",N/A
40585,ARA48345JZPZR,078200833X,Archmaker,"[13, 14]","This devastating film about a holocaust survivor living (or rather existing) in Spanish Harlem NY, was an important, controversial and courageous exercise in 1965, and it retains its power all these years later.  With what is without doubt Rod Steiger's finest performance, this study of a man haunted by his memories, and so traumatized by survivor's guilt and grief that he has numbed his emotions beyond human touch, and isolated himself completely from the humanity surrounding him, might even stun and disturb today's cynical sophisticates.The only thing Sol Nazerman, the Pawnbroker, hasn't lost is his life.  Everything he loved has been taken from him, and the wall he has erected to separate himself from his pain has likewise enured him to any human emotion, even pity and compassion for the human flotsam that daily appears before him with their pathetic possessions to pawn.  He has no longer the ability to love, hate, desire or despair.  He simply transacts, without care or consideration.  Rod Steiger could be a bombastic and over-the-top actor, so his restrained, thoughtful, carefully modulated performance here is a revelation and an acting masterpiece.Filmed with gritty realism on location in black and white (absolutely correct for this piece), it is a very adult, mature, and somber work.  It was controversial in its time for nudity and because the gangster that uses Nazerman's pawnshop to launder money is black.  That, and an unflinching look at the Spanish Harlem of junkies, prostitutes and so on.  Today, all of this seems completely appropriate.The supporting cast led by Jaime Sanchez as the assistant, Geraldine Fitzgerald as the kind and lonely social worker & Brock Peters as the malevolent entrepeneur, the ruthless gangster with a taste for refinement,are excellent.  There are nice bits by Jauno Hernandez, Rene Santoni, and others as the Pawnbroker's customers.Sidney Lumet provides his customary skill and precision in direction, not to mention bringing out Steiger's tremendous performance.  The editing by Ralph Rosenblum intercuts Nazerman's terrible memories in flashback with his present surroundings brilliantly.  Quincy Jones's score works nicely.But the show is Steiger.  His lesson to Sanchez on the ""mercantile heritage"" of the Jew is a classic scene.  And the careful buildup to the shattering climax of the piece, as Nazerman becomes increasingly overwhelmed with the images of his lost family and the wreckage of his past that culminates in his crashing breakthrough into the present and the onslaught of his emotions will not be forgotten by anyone loving great acting and filmmaking.This is not an easy film.  It does not sell out its story cheaply to any kind of audience-friendly ending.  This is modern tragedy, done with care and guts, and well worthwhile for those who treasure that.Footnote: And they gave the Oscar to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou.

Lumet uses flashbacks from the concentration camp period to make his point, as well as various other symbols. Steiger's performance is excellent, but the subject matter is inevitably bleak and I found the movie hard to enjoy because of it. For me it had little entertainment value. It sure is great when a movie makes you think, like this one, but what if all the thoughts that it evokes are depressive ones? At least that was the effect on me.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, 1965, and should easily have won--although he did not.

Into his store come lowlifes of all sorts--hookers, junkies, thieves.  Nazerman is a survivor of the Holocaust and carries enormous psychic scars that refuse to stop tearing at his soul.As a vicious menacing crime figure, Brock Peters is also superb--the present-day reminder to Nazerman of how evil never dies.  Other cast members include Geraldine Fitzgerald as a sympathetic caseworker and Jaime Sanchez as Nazerman's young Latino assistant who is of another generation and another culture, and cannot understand his boss' terrible anguish.Director Sidney Lumet has done an outstanding job here conveying the lifelong suffering that horrific evil brings with it.  This is not a graphic film, but one that delivers its message before the days of special effects via pure drama.

Not even the trailer! And yet this is a significant film. It is the best film ever made about a Holocaust survivor. The National Council of Churches voted it best film of the year (1965 in the USA - but it was first released the prior year in - guess where - Berlin). Steiger was robbed by the Academy when he did not get the Best Actor award. The film is not well known. I can remember seeing it decades ago on TV (surely with the nude scenes cut). According to the DVD it was released by American International - an outfit I remember as a kid for making cheepie science fiction films which were so bad that even back then I knew they were bad.Why has this film been shortchanged?The answer is contained within the film itself, but also within its historic context in the 1960's.Rod Steiger plays Sol Nazerman, a survivor of a concentration camp living two decades later in a New York City suburb and running a pawnshop in Harlem. Sol is what we should now recognize as a typical PTSD sufferer. (I don't believe the term existed back then.) He is convinced that his suffering is ""unique."" If you listen to these people - whether they came out of a concentration camp or out a war in Vietnam, Afghanisttan or Iraq - you always hear the same thing: ""You can't understand unless you were there!"" They cling to their suffering like a security blanket. It ruins their life but at the same time it IS their life. They can't imagine giving it up.In the film, we see Sol confronted at work everyday with people who have suffering of their own. We learn that what people bring to a pawnbroker are not so much things as memories. In most cases the ""memories"" are false, the fantasies of crazy people or deliberate lies that insult your intelligence. And yet...everyone of them believes his or her memories to be worth money! Sol despises these people. He regards them as subhuman - Untermenschen, to use the German. He believes that only his suffering has value; that only his experience is ""unique.""About two thirds into the film something happens. I won't give it away. But it causes Sol to radically change his opinion. The event is actually of a triffling nature - causing Sol to see something he could easily have seen all along. In practical terms it changes nothing - but in psychological terms it changes everything.And here we must step out of the film and into history. Not the history of ""the Holocaust"" - but the history of the invention of the Holocaust as a cultural event.The view of the Holocaust presented in this film is not what we may call the canonical view. That view did not become canonical until after the 1967 War. I assume you know something about it. The suffering of the Jews under the wicked Nazis is ""unique"" and cannot be compared with anyone else's suffering. It does not matter that more Russians and Ukranians were killed under Stalin, and more Chinese were killed under Mao. No, those were only pale reflections of THE HOLOCAUST- which we cannot call ""the Jewish Holocaust"" as that would imply that perhaps it is of concern only to Jews.This view of the Holocaust - this canonical view - is precisely the view of Sol Nazerman in the movie - when he is totally wrong. It is the view which this film rejects. It is the view which cuts Sol off from humanity causing him to be at war with everyone. And it is the view which he repudiates too late.This view which is refuted here in magnificent detail and with complete moral objectivity - why did this become the only politically correct view?  Because if you have a ""Jewish State"" which violates all international law - which wages wars of aggression against all of its neighbors - which uses assassination and terrorism as state policy - which stockpiles weapons of mass destruction - which shells Palestinian hospitals with white phosphorus -and which regards itself totally outside of all rules of humanity  - the only way to justify that is by saying this state is ""unique"" and its people bear a ""unique"" suffering putting their actions beyond judgment.That is the politically correct view in the USA. And that is why this movie has been dropped down a memory hole.",5,the Anti-Holocaust,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,4257,"['barebones', 'DVD', 'get', 'movie', 'division', 'chapters', 'extras', 'commentary', 'Not', 'even', 'trailer', 'yet', 'significant', 'film', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'National', 'Council', 'Churches', 'voted', 'best', 'film', 'year', '1965', 'USA', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'prior', 'year', 'guess', 'where', 'Berlin', 'Steiger', 'was', 'robbed', 'Academy', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'film', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'ago', 'TV', 'surely', 'nude', 'scenes', 'cut', 'According', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'American', 'International', 'outfit', 'remember', 'kid', 'making', 'cheepie', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'knew', 'were', 'bad.Why', 'film', 'been', 'shortchanged', 'answer', 'contained', 'film', 'also', 'historic', 'context', ""1960's.Rod"", 'Steiger', 'plays', 'Sol', 'Nazerman', 'survivor', 'concentration', 'camp', 'living', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'suburb', 'running', 'pawnshop', 'Harlem', 'Sol', 'what', 'should', 'now', 'recognize', 'typical', 'PTSD', 'sufferer', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'term', 'existed', 'back', 'then', 'convinced', 'suffering', 'unique', 'listen', 'people', 'came', 'concentration', 'camp', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'Afghanisttan', 'Iraq', 'always', 'hear', 'same', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'were', 'there', 'cling', 'suffering', 'security', 'blanket', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'giving', 'film', 'see', 'Sol', 'confronted', 'work', 'everyday', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'suffering', 'own', 'learn', 'what', 'people', 'bring', 'pawnbroker', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'memories', 'most', 'cases', 'memories', 'are', 'false', 'fantasies', 'crazy', 'people', 'deliberate', 'lies', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'yet', 'everyone', 'memories', 'be', 'worth', 'money', 'Sol', 'people', 'subhuman', 'Untermenschen', 'use', 'German', 'only', 'suffering', 'value', 'only', 'experience', 'unique', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Sol', 'radically', 'change', 'opinion', 'event', 'actually', 'triffling', 'nature', 'causing', 'Sol', 'see', 'something', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'seen', 'along', 'practical', 'terms', 'nothing', 'psychological', 'terms', 'everything.And', 'here', 'must', 'step', 'film', 'history', 'Not', 'history', 'Holocaust', 'history', 'invention', 'Holocaust', 'cultural', 'event.The', 'view', 'Holocaust', 'presented', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'may', 'call', 'canonical', 'view', 'view', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'canonical', '1967', 'War', 'assume', 'know', 'something', 'suffering', 'Jews', 'wicked', 'Nazis', 'unique', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'anyone', 'else', 'suffering', 'not', 'matter', 'more', 'Russians', 'Ukranians', 'were', 'killed', 'Stalin', 'more', 'Chinese', 'were', 'killed', 'Mao', 'No', 'were', 'only', 'pale', 'reflections', 'THE', 'HOLOCAUST-', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'Jewish', 'Holocaust', 'would', 'imply', 'perhaps', 'concern', 'only', 'Jews.This', 'view', 'Holocaust', 'canonical', 'view', 'precisely', 'view', 'Sol', 'Nazerman', 'movie', 'when', 'totally', 'wrong', 'view', 'film', 'view', 'Sol', 'humanity', 'causing', 'be', 'war', 'everyone', 'view', 'too', 'late.This', 'view', 'refuted', 'here', 'magnificent', 'detail', 'complete', 'moral', 'objectivity', 'why', 'did', 'become', 'only', 'politically', 'correct', 'view', 'have', 'Jewish', 'State', 'international', 'law', 'wars', 'aggression', 'neighbors', 'assassination', 'terrorism', 'state', 'policy', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Palestinian', 'hospitals', 'white', 'phosphorus', '-and', 'totally', 'rules', 'humanity', 'only', 'way', 'justify', 'saying', 'state', 'unique', 'people', 'bear', 'unique', 'suffering', 'putting', 'actions', 'judgment.That', 'politically', 'correct', 'view', 'USA', 'why', 'movie', 'been', 'dropped', 'down', 'memory', 'hole']",N/A

40608,A2T0L6RPRVP3UC,078200833X,Nobody,"[6, 7]","`The Pawnbroker' was directed in 1965 by: Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men,1957; Serpico, 1973; Dog Day Afternoon, 1974)The film deals with a Holocaust survivor suffering survivor's guilt after his wife and children died in the camps. He is now experiencing flash-backs to his experiences in the camps. He is clearly a man at war with himself and seeks to isolate himself from the world and people believing only in absolutes. Several people who appear to be lonely and desperate come into the store simply seeking company or help only to be turned away by his now cold indifference. Essentially this is a wonderful character study of man who has given up on life believing the world to be cruel and inhumane. I found the film well worth watching because it avoids a lot the sentimentality that can be seen in films of this nature.Cinematography on `The Pawnbroker' was by Boris Kaufman the younger brother of Dziga Vertov (Man With A Movie Camera,1929) He had shot perhaps the finest of all poetic realist films, `L'Atalante' (1934, Jean Vigo) as well as `Zero For Conduct' (1933. Jean Vigo). In 1942 he moved to America where he made a name for himself by working with Elia Kazan on `On The Waterfront'(1954)and `Baby Doll' (1956) winning an Oscar for the former. His cinematography had a high contrast monochromatic element to it that can be clearly seen in `The Pawnbroker'. It has the same grittiness that can also be seen in the films of John Cassavettes. Music was composed by Quincy Jones which gives it a sixties Harlem flavour. The film stars the underrated Rod Steiger (On The Waterfront, 1954; In The Heat Of The Night, 1967; Fist Full Of Dynamite, 1972) in the lead role.",4,An unsentimental look at survivor's guilt,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,1678,"['Pawnbroker', 'was', 'directed', '1965', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '12', 'Angry', 'Men,1957', 'Serpico', '1973', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', '1974', 'film', 'deals', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'suffering', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'wife', 'children', 'died', 'camps', 'now', 'experiencing', 'flash-backs', 'experiences', 'camps', 'clearly', 'man', 'war', 'isolate', 'world', 'people', 'believing', 'only', 'absolutes', 'Several', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'come', 'store', 'simply', 'seeking', 'company', 'help', 'only', 'be', 'turned', 'away', 'now', 'cold', 'indifference', 'Essentially', 'wonderful', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'believing', 'world', 'be', 'cruel', 'inhumane', 'found', 'film', 'well', 'watching', 'lot', 'sentimentality', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'films', 'nature.Cinematography', 'Pawnbroker', 'was', 'Boris', 'Kaufman', 'younger', 'brother', 'Dziga', 'Vertov', 'Man', 'A', 'Movie', 'Camera,1929', 'had', 'shot', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'poetic', 'realist', 'films', ""L'Atalante"", '1934', 'Jean', 'Vigo', 'as', 'well', 'Zero', 'Conduct', '1933', 'Jean', 'Vigo', '1942', 'moved', 'America', 'where', 'made', 'name', 'working', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Waterfront', '1954', 'Baby', 'Doll', '1956', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'former', 'cinematography', 'had', 'high', 'contrast', 'monochromatic', 'element', 'can', 'be', 'clearly', 'seen', 'Pawnbroker', 'same', 'grittiness', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'films', 'John', 'Cassavettes', 'Music', 'was', 'composed', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'sixties', 'Harlem', 'flavour', 'film', 'underrated', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Waterfront', '1954', 'Heat', 'Night', '1967', 'Fist', 'Full', 'Dynamite', '1972', 'lead', 'role']",N/A

Sol is a lonely man, unable to relate to other people's neediness for personal connection.  He is so detached from the world that only random comments from his store customers or friends and family can stir angry replies from him.  Sol believes that world is governed by greed, which he resents in spite of the fact that he has lots of money himself.  It is also sad to see him in his shop, closed behind bars and locks.  It is almost as if he is self-imposing the imprisonment on himself.  A few friends and family and even his long time lover, are financially dependent on him.  While he needs them to remind him of his past, he also resents them.  Flashbacks from Sol's past are terribly hard to watch.  We see WWII rob him of his children, parents and beautiful wife.  The way they perish is of constant anguish to him and 25 years later, his emotional pain os so hard that he wants to die more than anything else.  Sol rejects everything and everyone around him because he is either dead inside already, or he is afraid that if he gets close to people and sincerely starts caring about them, he will get hurt again.

40613,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,078200833X,Robert Amsel,"[15, 32]","""The Pawnbroker"" is a bleak, shattering character study concerning the ravages of guilt on a holocaust survivor who has psychologically shut down his emotions in order to survive.  Sol Nazerman's (Rod Steiger) guilt is based on his inability to save his family at Auschwitz while he himself has continued to live.  His emotional shutdown results in his ability to empathize with the desperate, pathetic customers who pawn their valuables at his store, or to care about his mistress, his Puerto Rican employee, or anyone else.  However, through a sort of cinematic stream of consciousness, director Sidney Lumet is able to reveal how current situations act as catalysts on Sol, enabling memories of the past, through flashback, to return and haunt him still. This is arguably the best performance of Rod Steiger's career, with exceptional support from the entire cast.So what's the flaw? Well, the filmmakers convincingly show where the horrors of hatred and bigotry that led to the Holocaust can lead.  And then the filmmakers proceed to promote another form of hatred, as if this were somehow acceptable.  The problem for me is that for no positive reason, several of the arch villains in this piece are shown to be gay men, and one can't help but wonder at the homophobia behind the director or author's choice in this.  The main villain of the piece is Rodriguez (excellently played by Brock Peters), who uses the pawnship as a money-laundering ""front"" for his personal crime syndicate, and pays Sol well for his compliance.  Rodriguez is continually shown with his blond male lover, a handsome but subservient figure in a non-speaking role.  After one threatening interchange between Rodriguez and Sol in Rodriguez's living room, Rodriguez and the lover are seen ascending the stairs, presumably to the bedroom, to turn in for the night, leaving the distraught and vanquished Sol by himself. [...]And then there are the three evil thugs who decide to rob the pawnshop.  Prior to this robbery attempt, we see one of robbers lovingly examining the photos in a men's muscle magazine.  Again, why??The movie even contains an East Harlem nightclub scene, in which a pathetic drag queen of advanced age struts his sad stuff in a performance worthy of ""The Gong Show"" before removing his wig at the dance's end.  For the third time, why???This facile use of homosexuality to highlight modern-day evil is quite frankly repugnant and both tarnishes and sabotages an otherwise brilliant film.  If the filmmakers are attempting to show where hatred toward one minority group can lead, how can the writer and director justify reviling yet another persecuted minority group?  Were they not aware that hundreds of thousands of gay men and women also perished in the death camps? Was the suffering of the concentration camp prisoners who were forced to wear a yellow star more valid than the suffering of the prisoners who were forced to wear a pink triangle?",4,Brilliant film but with one inexcusable flaw,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,2948,"['Pawnbroker', 'bleak', 'shattering', 'character', 'study', 'concerning', 'ravages', 'guilt', 'holocaust', 'survivor', 'who', 'psychologically', 'shut', 'down', 'emotions', 'order', 'survive', 'Sol', 'Nazerman', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'guilt', 'based', 'inability', 'save', 'family', 'Auschwitz', 'continued', 'live', 'emotional', 'shutdown', 'results', 'ability', 'empathize', 'desperate', 'pathetic', 'customers', 'who', 'pawn', 'valuables', 'store', 'care', 'mistress', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'employee', 'anyone', 'else', 'However', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'able', 'reveal', 'how', 'current', 'situations', 'act', 'catalysts', 'Sol', 'enabling', 'memories', 'past', 'flashback', 'return', 'haunt', 'still', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'career', 'exceptional', 'support', 'entire', 'cast.So', 'what', 'flaw', 'Well', 'filmmakers', 'convincingly', 'show', 'where', 'horrors', 'hatred', 'bigotry', 'led', 'Holocaust', 'can', 'lead', 'then', 'filmmakers', 'proceed', 'promote', 'form', 'hatred', 'were', 'somehow', 'acceptable', 'problem', 'positive', 'reason', 'several', 'arch', 'piece', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'gay', 'men', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'homophobia', 'director', 'author', 'choice', 'main', 'villain', 'piece', 'Rodriguez', 'excellently', 'played', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'who', 'pawnship', 'money-laundering', 'front', 'personal', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Sol', 'well', 'compliance', 'Rodriguez', 'continually', 'shown', 'blond', 'male', 'lover', 'handsome', 'subservient', 'figure', 'non-speaking', 'role', 'one', 'threatening', 'interchange', 'Rodriguez', 'Sol', 'Rodriguez', 'living', 'room', 'Rodriguez', 'lover', 'are', 'seen', 'ascending', 'stairs', 'presumably', 'bedroom', 'turn', 'night', 'leaving', 'distraught', 'vanquished', 'Sol', ']', 'then', 'are', 'three', 'evil', 'thugs', 'who', 'decide', 'rob', 'pawnshop', 'Prior', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'see', 'one', 'robbers', 'lovingly', 'examining', 'photos', 'men', 'muscle', 'magazine', 'Again', 'why', 'movie', 'even', 'East', 'Harlem', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'pathetic', 'drag', 'queen', 'advanced', 'age', 'sad', 'stuff', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Gong', 'Show', 'removing', 'wig', 'dance', 'end', 'third', 'time', 'why', 'facile', 'use', 'homosexuality', 'highlight', 'modern-day', 'evil', 'quite', 'frankly', 'repugnant', 'tarnishes', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'attempting', 'show', 'where', 'hatred', 'one', 'minority', 'group', 'can', 'lead', 'how', 'can', 'writer', 'director', 'justify', 'reviling', 'yet', 'persecuted', 'minority', 'group', 'Were', 'not', 'aware', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'also', 'perished', 'death', 'camps', 'Was', 'suffering', 'concentration', 'camp', 'prisoners', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'wear', 'yellow', 'star', 'more', 'valid', 'suffering', 'prisoners', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'wear', 'pink', 'triangle']",N/A
40614,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,078200833X,Robert Morris,"[10, 10]","This is one of only a few films in which there are certain scenes which, for various reasons,  I find almost unbearable to watch again. The others include the scene at the train station when Sophie must make her choice, the sequence of murders in In Cold Blood, the burning of the church in The Patriot, the multiple hangings in The Ox-Bow Incident, and the evisceration of William Wallace in Braveheart.Brilliantly directed by Sidney Lumet, with equally brilliant cinematography by Boris Kaufman (both of whom should have at least been nominated for an Academy Award), this is among the first films to dramatize with high levels of seriousness and sensitivity the essential evil of the Holocaust. Sol Nazerman is the central character, played by Rod Steiger who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor. Lee Marvin received that award for his role in Cat Ballou. (I thoroughly enjoyed Marvin's performance but still think Steiger deserved the award. To his credit, so did Marvin and said so.) Nazerman is a pawnbroker in New York City, having long ago lost (or so it seems) his ability to have any feelings for anyone else...or even for himself. His mind may be especially alert but his heart seems numb after so much emotional pain.In terms of plot, not much happens. Most of the the film focuses is on Nazerman's dysfunctional interactions with other people, notably with Marilyn Birchfield (played by Geraldine Fitzgerald) and Jose Ortiz (Jaime Sanchez) who works for Nazerman. What's Nazerman's problem? With meticulous care, Lumet gradually reveals the past from which he emerged but, in certain respects, from which he has not survived. His ""problem"" is that he has lost his will to live but not to exist.Many of those who have seen the film will insist that, in the final scene, when Nazerman screams out in pain, the sound of that scream has haunted them ever since. In fact, there was no sound. Steiger later explained that his approach to that climactic moment in the film was inspired by Picasso's anti-war mural, Guernica, which portrays unprecedented atrocities committed on April 27th, 1937, against the civilian population of Guernica, a small Basque village in northern Spain. To Steiger's and Lumet's everlasting credit, Nazerman's silent scream allows the film to have the greatest possible subliminal impact on those privileged to experience it.",5,The Sounds of Silence,1057104000,"07 2, 2003",2003,2374,"['one', 'only', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'various', 'reasons', 'find', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'again', 'others', 'include', 'scene', 'train', 'station', 'when', 'Sophie', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'sequence', 'murders', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'burning', 'church', 'Patriot', 'multiple', 'hangings', 'Ox-Bow', 'Incident', 'evisceration', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Braveheart.Brilliantly', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Boris', 'Kaufman', 'whom', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'first', 'films', 'dramatize', 'high', 'levels', 'seriousness', 'sensitivity', 'essential', 'evil', 'Holocaust', 'Sol', 'Nazerman', 'central', 'character', 'played', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'received', 'award', 'role', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Marvin', 'performance', 'still', 'think', 'Steiger', 'deserved', 'award', 'credit', 'so', 'did', 'Marvin', 'said', 'so', 'Nazerman', 'pawnbroker', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'having', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'so', 'ability', 'have', 'feelings', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'especially', 'alert', 'heart', 'numb', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'pain.In', 'terms', 'plot', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'Most', 'film', 'Nazerman', 'dysfunctional', 'interactions', 'other', 'people', 'notably', 'Marilyn', 'Birchfield', 'played', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'Jose', 'Ortiz', 'Jaime', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'Nazerman', 'What', 'Nazerman', 'problem', 'meticulous', 'care', 'Lumet', 'gradually', 'past', 'emerged', 'certain', 'respects', 'not', 'survived', 'problem', 'lost', 'will', 'live', 'not', 'exist.Many', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'insist', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Nazerman', 'out', 'pain', 'sound', 'scream', 'haunted', 'ever', 'fact', 'was', 'sound', 'Steiger', 'later', 'explained', 'approach', 'climactic', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'inspired', 'Picasso', 'anti-war', 'mural', 'Guernica', 'unprecedented', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'April', '27th', '1937', 'civilian', 'population', 'Guernica', 'small', 'Basque', 'village', 'northern', 'Spain', 'Steiger', 'Lumet', 'everlasting', 'credit', 'Nazerman', 'silent', 'scream', 'film', 'have', 'greatest', 'possible', 'subliminal', 'impact', 'privileged', 'experience']",N/A

There is a beautiful scene in slow-motion of children romping happily on a lawn, of great domestic happiness.The shattered life of the survivor Nazerman begins to fall apart on the twenty- fifth anniversary of his wife's death. Rod Steiger plays the Pawnbroker and his performance is a most brilliant one. We see a character so disturbed so angry so locked in himself so unable to communicate with others or accept their affection. Steiger is absolutely convincing .What I found a bit difficult was that the reactions he has to his suffering correspond with Anti- Semitic sentiments. So one old Anti- Semitic hate- teaching about Jews is that they will give up everything for money. Nazerman trusts in the film , only money , and as Pawnbroker is cruel to others. I too did not like the implication ( if generalized) about his replying to the horrible evil done to him by being unkind to others. That is, I am not bothered if it remains on the level of one character and one story. I am bothered how people might generalize from this.This film is relentless and in a way merciless.

40616,A1VBYS3G8NQUY1,078200833X,SKOLVK,"[3, 3]","The Pawnbroker follows the story of Sol, A pawn store owner in a shady part of New York. To Sol nothing matters but the almighty dollor. The memory of warmth and kindness have long since abandoned him. At first you might find yourself disliking Sol for his rude and self centered nature untill his painful past is slowly revealed. The film flashbacks periodically, showing how Sol and his wife where captured and placed in a concentration camp during WWII.(One flashback that is particually painful is when Sol's wife is seperated from him and placed in the camp's joy division) Sol copes with these painful memories by killing his emotions. His past leaves him unforgiving and emotionally dead to the world. The beauty of ""The Pawnbroker"" is that it shows the devastating effects that the holocaust had on the lives of it's survivors. Many movies have dealt with the holocaust but none of them have showed such an intimate view of a man broken by it. One image I've kept from the Pawnbroker is of Sol looking painfully at the bar code tatooed on his forearm. A horrible reminder that no matter what, his past will always haunt him. A beautiful film that everyone should see at least once.",5,simply haunting,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,1189,"['Pawnbroker', 'story', 'Sol', 'A', 'pawn', 'store', 'owner', 'shady', 'part', 'New', 'York', 'Sol', 'nothing', 'matters', 'almighty', 'dollor', 'memory', 'warmth', 'kindness', 'have', 'long', 'abandoned', 'first', 'might', 'find', 'disliking', 'Sol', 'rude', 'self', 'centered', 'nature', 'untill', 'painful', 'past', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'periodically', 'showing', 'how', 'Sol', 'wife', 'where', 'captured', 'placed', 'concentration', 'camp', 'WWII', 'One', 'flashback', 'particually', 'painful', 'when', 'Sol', 'wife', 'seperated', 'placed', 'camp', 'joy', 'division', 'Sol', 'painful', 'memories', 'killing', 'emotions', 'past', 'unforgiving', 'emotionally', 'dead', 'world', 'beauty', 'Pawnbroker', 'devastating', 'effects', 'holocaust', 'had', 'lives', 'survivors', 'Many', 'movies', 'have', 'dealt', 'holocaust', 'none', 'have', 'showed', 'intimate', 'view', 'man', 'broken', 'One', 'image', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'Pawnbroker', 'Sol', 'looking', 'painfully', 'bar', 'code', 'tatooed', 'forearm', 'horrible', 'reminder', 'matter', 'what', 'past', 'will', 'always', 'haunt', 'beautiful', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once']",N/A

But the most immediately devastating aspect of this film is Rod Steiger's performance and the intensity of restraint Lumet uses to try to keep the lid on what has to be one of the most seething characters in all of film history.Sidney Lumet at his best was known for extracting life-time performances out of his cast, and this is certainly one of those moments.  The clenched fist growl that Nazerman allows himself at one point is more powerful than a legion of devil's howling, and the wringing out my soul went through watching it will always stand as one of my greater film experiences.
