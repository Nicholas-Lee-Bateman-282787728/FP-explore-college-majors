He doesn't watch Army Wives, and for a long time, I didn't either, but I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. he show really has a lot of conservative values, which is refreshing at a time when liberalism reigns. Tough issues come up, but they're handled well, for the most part. and unlike most TV dramas that are full of sex, this one keeps the sex between the married couples mostly. And it doesn't show graphic love scenes anyway, you just know they happen. The two times in all the seasons that there is adultery, both only happen once, and both times, the cheating spouse confesses and it is dealt with. The only complaint I have is the episode when the pregnant girl balked at letting a lesbian couple adopt her child. That specific episode really made a mockery of Christianity.

Although I don't watch much television, my wife told me about this some time ago, so I took a chance and bought the first season on DVD--and then the second, third, fourth, and now the fifth. For the past couple of days I have done little else but watch it; it was hard to stop at the end of an episode and go do something else, such as eat and sleep!Now I retired from the Air Force 20 years ago after serving 24+ years--both as an officer and as an NCO. The culture of the Air Force is different from that of the Army, so I couldn't totally ""feel"" the pulse of the show from (1) an Army perspective or (2) a wife's perspective. But still, I loved it. At times, I felt that I could in some way identify with most of the main characters, and always I found myself completely wrapped up in the series. I laughed, I became angry, I cried.The last episode of Season Five would seem to be the end of the entire series, but according to one of the special features, a sixth season may be on the horizon. If so, I will definitely buy it when it becomes available on DVD.Despite some aspects that may not be completely true to life, the dynamics among the various personalities and the challenges each character faces are very realistic and down to earth.
