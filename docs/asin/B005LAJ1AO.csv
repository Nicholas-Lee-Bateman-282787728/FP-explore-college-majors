1492193,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005LAJ1AO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I'm not sure if I'd prefer to call Chris Lilley an outrageous comedian or a convincing character actor because, truthfully, he is both. Having been a tremendous fan of Lilley's most recent endeavor ""Summer Heights High"" in 2007, I was eager to look into this new project. ""Summer Heights High"" had Lilley playing various characters in a mockumentary about a typical Australian high school. The series skewered every conceivable cliche of that world in highly amusing ways and yet still had great heart and warmth. The show won the Australian Film Institute's top prizes for Best Actor in a Television Comedy for Lilley as well as Best Comedy Series. Lilley aims for something much bigger and broader in ""Angry Boys."" Here, the various plot threads are not confined to one setting but spread across the world! It's an interesting approach but one that isn't as instantly accessible as some of Lilley's other pieces. At first, I had certain favorite characters that I felt stole the show. But as things progressed, the interrelationships started to appear (although tentatively) before Lilley brought everyone closer for the finale.The eccentric characters that Lilley portrays here include the rambunctious and troublemaking Sim twins (previously seen in We Can Be Heroes), their grandmother who is a tough but fair reform school matron, a ruthless Japanese businesswoman willing to exploit her skateboarding son, a laconic surfer who is still living his boyhood dream despite his adult responsibilities, and a surprisingly successful American rapper. At first, it would appear that these four disparate stories would have little common ground, but Lilley makes each of these diverse character types quite distinctive. The heart of the show has to be the Sim family led by battling twins Nathan and Daniel. There is a mercilessness to their hilarious dysfunction, but genuine feeling underneath it all. And I quite identified with Blake Oakfield, the aging surfer. He may not always have the most colorful comedy segments, but there is a real depth to the characterization. Lilley goes for more shock value with Jen Okazaki and rapper S.Mouse. Of course, having Lilley playing alternate genders and races might already make one uncomfortable (if you are sensitive to such things), but Lilley pushes these storylines beyond good taste to great affect. Okazaki is monstrous, but her sheer selfishness plays so over-the-top that it's hard not to appreciate its outrageousness. And S.Mouse is a fascinating combination of cluelessness and bravado. A poser and wannabe that had an inexplicable hit with the ludicrous ""Slap My Elbow,"" he struggles to reclaim his waning 15 minutes of fame.""Angry Boys"" is comprised of 12 half hour episodes. The characters and stories weave in and out, and not everyone is featured in every individual episode. As I mentioned, some characters will appeal to you more than others as should be expected. With its broader goals, I'm not sure that ""Angry Boys"" is as instantly addictive as Lilley's other programs, but I appreciated this ambitious scope. It's hard to poke fun at your characters but still give them genuine pathos, and Lilley is an expert at combining the absurd with the real. That's why this stands out. Lilley has an affection for the ridiculousness of the human race. And in that world view, there is a lot to laugh at in these twelve episodes!

1492196,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005LAJ1AO,Tommy Dooley,"[4, 4]","The comedy genius of Chris Lilley of `Summer Heights High' fame returned with this rocking gem of a series. Chris plays a number of characters including identical twins, Daniel and Nathan Sim. Nathan is going profoundly deaf and reluctantly their mum has decided he has to go to Deaf School. So Daniel decides to throw the most awesomest farewell party ever in the uninspiring backwater where they live called `Dunt'.  They also have a guinea pig loving grandmother, who works in a juvenile correction facility and is simply called `Gran, Chris also plays her.We also get to see the lives of their `Legends', who are all being invited to the party. These heroes are surfing legend Blake Oakfield, African American rapper Schwayne Jr who is also called S.mouse! and has all the intellect of a door mouse and a girlfriend with the best name ever - Lasquisha. Chris Lilley plays both of these too. Then their third `Legend' is skate boarding hero Tim Okazaki, who has inspired his over controlling mother to turn him into a global brand, based on the fact that he is gay and therefore everything is `Gay Style', problem is that Tim is in fact straight. His mum is played by Chris too and is my favourite character in the whole show, but they are all pretty good if not excellent.There are twelve episodes and the stories are all woven together really well and this is done in a documentary style, with interview pieces to camera as well as action footage.  The humour can be quite gross in places especially where the twins are concerned and the language can be quite adult, but I just loved it heaps and was totally stoked by it enough to watch it twice. So if a bit of down under humour is your thing then you won't go far wrong with Angry Boys - oh and the opening titles are great too - ripper!",5,I Loved This Heaps,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1795,"['comedy', 'genius', 'Chris', 'Lilley', 'Summer', 'Heights', 'High', 'fame', 'returned', 'rocking', 'gem', 'series', 'Chris', 'number', 'characters', 'including', 'identical', 'twins', 'Daniel', 'Nathan', 'Sim', 'Nathan', 'going', 'profoundly', 'deaf', 'reluctantly', 'mum', 'decided', 'go', 'Deaf', 'School', 'So', 'Daniel', 'throw', 'most', 'awesomest', 'farewell', 'party', 'ever', 'uninspiring', 'backwater', 'where', 'live', 'called', 'Dunt', 'also', 'have', 'guinea', 'pig', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'who', 'juvenile', 'correction', 'facility', 'simply', 'called', 'Gran', 'Chris', 'also', 'her.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'lives', 'Legends', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'invited', 'party', 'heroes', 'are', 'surfing', 'legend', 'Blake', 'Oakfield', 'African', 'American', 'rapper', 'Schwayne', 'Jr', 'who', 'also', 'called', 'S.mouse', 'intellect', 'door', 'mouse', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'name', 'ever', 'Lasquisha', 'Chris', 'Lilley', 'too', 'Then', 'third', 'Legend', 'skate', 'boarding', 'hero', 'Tim', 'Okazaki', 'who', 'inspired', 'controlling', 'mother', 'turn', 'global', 'brand', 'based', 'fact', 'gay', 'therefore', 'everything', 'Gay', 'Style', 'problem', 'Tim', 'fact', 'straight', 'mum', 'played', 'Chris', 'too', 'favourite', 'character', 'whole', 'show', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'are', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'stories', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'style', 'interview', 'pieces', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'footage', 'humour', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'gross', 'places', 'especially', 'where', 'twins', 'are', 'concerned', 'language', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'adult', 'just', 'loved', 'heaps', 'was', 'totally', 'stoked', 'enough', 'watch', 'twice', 'So', 'bit', 'down', 'humour', 'thing', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'wrong', 'Angry', 'Boys', 'oh', 'opening', 'titles', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'ripper']",N/A
