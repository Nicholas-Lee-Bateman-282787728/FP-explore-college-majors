They are forever on the run from nomadic bands of cannibals. One day they discover a woman and reluctantly take her in. Then they are besieged by the cannibals.Then they discover their new addition is actually a cannibal herself. Then there is a climactic battle.Sort of a yawn, actually.Well, Tooth and Nail has EXACTLY THE SAME PLOT! Only this movie is REALLY FREAKING GOOD! At some points I wondered if it wasn't sort of a class warfare statement from the POV of the elite middle class. All the heroes look and dress like J Crew models, and the cannibals are definitely prols. But then at the end it turns into a pure exploitation.

1119379,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B000YE1REA,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[2, 4]","For those of us who have seen countless horror films and have developed - deliberately or unconsciously - a higher standard of expectations which is not easily satisfied merely by excessive gore or extreme content, or by various other sensationalist elements (although female nudity never hurts) has evolved.  In spite of reluctance and even skepticism about the remarkably bold claims which were made by the trailers for Horrorfest 2006.  Many of those among us who were a little more savvy recognized that the audacious claims that the advertisements were making about the supposedly extreme content of the allegedly ground-breaking films was most likely hype rather than having a basis in fact.  As it turned out, the claims were simply farfetched exaggerations - if not outright falsehoods.  Since their release, most of these films from the first Horrorfest have made their way to the Sci-Fi channel with only moderate editing which is not necessarily more rigorous or content-related than for ""mainstream"" horror films with an R rating.  Many small budget straight-to-rental releases, in an effort to be competitive in their niche markets, in fact have far more graphic and ""extreme"" content than any of the films from the Horrorfest series.Though skeptical, we were nonetheless intrigued by the skillful advertising campaign and engaging trailers.  Upon seeing the 8 films offered by this highly touted marketing campaign, the results were mixed in terms of audience reaction, although disappointment seems to be at least as common (if not moreso) than praise and positive feedback.  In reviews I have written about films from the first Horrorfest (2006) campaign, I mused aloud as to whether the initial success of the marketing campaign would justify - or even if there was any chance to prevail over - what would likely (and has turned out to) be the largely lukewarm-to-disappointed reaction of the highly touted and sensationalized films, and if this would have an adverse effect on any plans to launch a subsequent campaign (or series).  Recent events have addressed this matter, as the second installment of Horrorfest (2007) was released.As I had expected, Horrorfest 2007 did not pull in the same amount of success as its predecessor, although I had to admit that the batch of films they were offering not only looked interesting, but even more intriguing than the first batch of films from Horrorfest 2006.  Once these films became accessible after their minimal theater run, I was interested in seeing them.  The first one I was able to rent was TOOTH AND NAIL.For those who don't know the premise/plot of this film and are interested, TOOTH AND NAIL takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting in an indeterminate year.  A group of `survivors' referred to as the ""Foragers"" is hold up in an abandoned but primitively functional hospital.  They are pitted against the ""Rovers"", a band of vicious cannibalistic (though surprisingly groomed and well-fed, especially for being in a nearly abandoned city without utilities) homicidal nomadic marauders who besiege the aforementioned hospital.  In spite of the potential for Mad Max/Road Warrior-type imaginative possibilities in the film and script, the movie instead takes on a plodding and unimpressive rendition of a slasher-film - with tedious acting and dismal pacing.The acting was not very good.  Though this is in fact a bit of an understatement, I won't go into great length or detail to describe all the various and notable weaknesses.  Suffice it to say the quality of acting was marginal to poor from the lesser known castmembers and disappointing from the more famous and experienced ones.  The principle lead (Nicole DuPort) is not particularly skilled as an actress.  Not only is her delivery and presence rather stilted and flat and languid, but she is very unconvincing in both her role and her mannerisms, and is especially hard to believe in the transformative characterization she takes on in the film's insipid and laughably banal conclusion [WARNING: Semi-Spoiler ahead] whereby she single-handedly goes on a lethargic and questionably plausible killing rampage against the momentarily-incapacitated savages.Even the recognizable veterans of films (most of whom are talented performers) are at their minimum levels of participation - both in terms of appearance time and effort.  Michael Madsen continues on his depressing journey of status regression.  His appearance was rather brief and rather uninspired.  Robert Carradine continues in his recent pattern of minor roles in obscure films.  His appearance was flat and lethargic - even for him.  Vinny Jones, becoming increasingly more ubiquitous in film appearances - even when his accent is conspicuously out-of-place and inappropriate - was also scarcely and poorly used.  Michael Kelly, a capable supporting character-actor who has a healthy resume' of respectable film-work credits over the last several years, does the best job.  But even his appearance lacks the energy and dimension that he generally brings to his film roles, and what seemed like a promising character which could have certainly helped the film overall was relegated to an anti-climactic and unsatisfying finale.  And finally Rachel Miner, the current ubiquitous 20-something doyenne of C-grade horror films, makes yet another featured appearance in a Horrorfest outing.  Although she may not be considered the finest actress of her generation, she is a better actress (or at least capable of better) than indicated in this subpar film, and yet it is one of the more solid performances in the film.  That's not to say hers is especially good.  But compared to the other clumsy performances or lackluster appearances, she is practically a pillar to the otherwise rickety shack that is the film TOOTH AND NAIL.Frankly, I am surprised that these more notable and famous actors agreed to do this project.  The reasons are not immediately obvious or clear, or even logical.  This film most certainly did not help the standings of their careers.  Indeed, this kind of film is not only a low point of a reknowned (or successful) Hollywood actor's resume' but can even possibly or potentially damage the viability of their career - or could at least affect their hirability for future casting considerations.  Experienced pros that they are, they had to know this project might not be a good reflection on their credentials.  I hope it's not a financial necessity for them.  It would be nice to believe that it was their dedication to supporting independent and/or small-budget film-making, which is an admirable trait (though one would think they would have chosen projects with more creativity and more capable direction and/or talented writing and/or better production quality - which is a vastly wide-open field to pick from).The production values were minimal - not just for a major studio release, but even for a no-budget indie film done by school chums with a digital camcorder over summer break or a long weekend.  I say this as someone who has actually helped produce micro-budgeted local indie films with both part-time and professional actors.  My personal bias aside, I would earnestly rather watch anything with Kirsten Maryott or Miranda McCauley or Valerie Friedlander or Venda D'abato or Andy Bruce or Kendall Frazier or Jeanie Jones or Nicole Damon or Elizabeth Granville - or many of the other earnest and talented castmembers I have had the good fortune and privilege to work with - rather than watch weak and boring dreck with ""big name"" actors giving listless and uninteresting performances such as in TOOTH AND NAIL.  Based on the short time they appeared in the film and my own experiences with shooting schedules, it is my belief that the more famous members in the cast (excepting Ms. Miner) might have only filmed for one day or so each.  I can feasibly see how it could be done, though it is just speculation.Small budget is not synonymous with a lack of quality, much like a large budget is not a guarantee of a good quality or successful film (see anything that Jennifer ""J-Lo"" Lopez has starred or appeared in other than THE CELL as evidence).  However, more resources essentially means having more options, and if used competently or effectively, then it is a good indicator for better or even superior results.  Based on my observations while and after viewing TOOTH AND NAIL, I am convinced that whatever budget they had was either miniscule to begin with and/or squandered on guild scale per-diem rates.But acting is only a part (albeit an important one) of a film's content & substance.  A good story or skilled direction can sometimes overcome marginal or relatively weak performances.  Unfortunately, the writing was bland and unimaginative, which highlighted the issue.  The plot and premise were not especially creative, in spite of the possible potential for some interesting story elements.  In fact, the acting was flat and lethargic and stilted.  The plot was not very imaginative, and the ending was predictable.  The direction was tepid and marginal.  This aspect might have made a difference in that capable or effective directing can sometimes overcome weak writing and ever subpar acting, but instead it highlighted those weaknesses.  The pacing was nearly as languid and dreary as that of a Liv Ulman film festival.  It was a hackneyed effort throughout, which prompted the frequent use of the Fast Forward button in the (ultimately futile) attempt to find a portion of the film that would sustain interest.  These can all be attributed to Mark Young - the writer & director of this unsatisfying effort.Though budget may have played a part in limiting what this disappointing and lackluster project could achieve, it is ultimately not an acceptable/compelling excuse, since much better films have been made on very little money (less than this one).  What those films may lack in production resources, they make up for in innovation or creativity or daring/boldness or better acting (there is an ENOURMOUS wealth of talent and enthusiasm to select from when you don't limit your casting by discriminating against those who don't belong to - or could not get in - a guild or union).The biggest question (and/or disappointment) is what this film is doing classified as a Horror film - and oh, not just any horror film, but as part of the sensationally vaunted and supposedly extreme (and somewhat over-hyped) HORRORFEST (8 FILMS TO DIE FOR) line-up for 2007.  The advertisements for the films allege that their content is too shocking and ""extreme"" for theatrical release - something that separates them from `ordinary' horror films.  But this film wasn't even scary at all - let alone deserving of the hyperbole regarding its alleged fear-inducing nature.Although I railed on this film throughout this review, I wouldn't say this is a terrible movie.  However, there wasn't much about this film I liked.  Even though it had the most notable and/or recognizable cast of any HORRORFEST film, it turned out to be the weakest one I had seen so far (until CRAZY EIGHTS), and is likely one of the weaker from the two years (soon to be three years) of this annual campaign.  The films from the first HORROFEST (2006) ranged from decent to subpar in terms of quality.  If TOOTH AND NAIL and CRAZY EIGHTS are any indication, this most recent batch (HORRORFEST 2007) is not off to a good start.{UPDATE: since I began writing this review, I have had the chance to watch the film THE DEATHS OF IAN STONE - another Horrorfest 2007 release.  It wasn't that bad of a film, and was at least imaginative and quasi-original.  Here's hoping that there are other adequate films in the series.}",2,promising idea gets scuttled by lackluster film,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,11726,"['who', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'horror',

My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.The world has run out of gas, which precipitates a world full of violence and death.  In only a few years, two-thirds of the Earth's population has either frozen or starved to death, and the remnants struggle to survive as best they can.  In Philadelphia, a small group of survivors hunker down in an abandoned hospital, trying to recreate a viable society one day at a time.  Unfortunately, a group of Thunderdome outcasts are more interested in having them over for dinner.There are so many things that this movie does to make itself unbelieveable and silly that it's hard to point to just a few and make the case that they sink the film alone - it is, instead, an accumulation of them all that nearly make this film unwatchable.  In order for them to have any chance of working, movies like this have to make it possible for me to willingly suspend my disbelief - if they can get me to that point, then they also must work to stay there.  'Tooth and Nail' begins shakily enough with the idea that running out of gas propels the utter breakdown of society.  What the world will look like if that happens is anyone's guess - it could even be as severe as this movie makes it out to be, but I don't think 'T&N;' makes that case as well as it really needed to in order to get my full attention.But I'm pretty easy on films like this, so I go with it.  Eventually we meet the 'Foragers', the group living in the hospital.  As Robert Carradine, the leader of the group, introduces them to a new girl just joining them, the movie takes another hit as the names of the characters - Viper, Torino, Ford, Nova, et al - sound absolutely ridiculous.  Obviously, in its longing for the old world, parents in this new one are transferring their misty-eyed memories for their cars onto their children.Soon members of the group start disappearing, and we find out it's the fault of a cannibalistic group called the 'Rovers' who have found themselves a new food source in the foragers.  Ford (Rider Strong, looking like a fourteen-year-old Dennis Miller) tries to take charge of the foragers, but the others swing their support to the new girl, Neon.  Poor defensive choices make them easy pickings, and the foragers are nearly slaughtered.  Well...some are completely slaughtered, only a couple survive.  But then a twist that is not entirely unexpected puts the foragers completely in the rovers power, yet a lucky break allows one to escape, decorate her face with warpaint, and then extract her gory revenge.This film reminded me of some horrible hybrid of 'Dawson's Creek' and 'The Road Warrior'.  Aside from the setting and the names, the dialogue never rang true, mostly consisting of the foragers squabbling over who was going to be their leader.  Characters usually sounded one note, which also defined them, and the leader of the rovers was preposterous at best.  Unfortunately, all I've described doesn't necessarily seem as though it should only add up to one star, but it is the utter failure of this movie to ever capture my interest that really sinks it.  If I didn't make a habit of reviewing films, I would have turned it off.The input of Michael Madson and Vinnie James does little to offset the low points - in fact, it may make things worse by raising expectations.  Their roles are minor, and by giving them first billing on the product page, it sets up the idea that they are much more involved with the film.  The other young actors are all competent enough, given the script they have to work with, but not to the degree that they make the film worth seeking out.  In the end, it is implausible and annoying, like tooth and nails raked across a chalkboard.",1,Fingernails across chalkboard,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,3863,"['Disclaimer', 'watched', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'disc', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.The', 'world', 'run', 'gas', 'world', 'full', 'violence', 'death', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'two-thirds', 'Earth', 'population', 'frozen', 'starved', 'death', 'remnants', 'struggle', 'survive', 'best', 'can', 'Philadelphia', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'hunker', 'down', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'trying', 'recreate', 'viable', 'society', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'group', 'Thunderdome', 'outcasts', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'unbelieveable', 'silly', 'hard', 'point', 'just', 'few', 'make', 'case', 'sink', 'film', 'alone', 'instead', 'accumulation', 'nearly', 'make', 'film', 'unwatchable', 'order', 'have', 'chance', 'working', 'movies', 'have', 'make', 'possible', 'willingly', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'can', 'get', 'point', 'then', 'also', 'must', 'work', 'stay', 'there', 'Nail', 'begins', 'shakily', 'enough', 'idea', 'running', 'out', 'gas', 'propels', 'utter', 'breakdown', 'society', 'What', 'world', 'will', 'look', 'anyone', 'guess', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'as', 'severe', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'T"", 'N', 'case', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'needed', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'attention.But', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'easy', 'films', 'go', 'Eventually', 'meet', ""'Foragers"", 'group', 'living', 'hospital', 'Robert', 'Carradine', 'leader', 'group', 'new', 'girl', 'just', 'joining', 'movie', 'hit', 'names', 'characters', 'Viper', 'Torino', 'Ford', 'Nova', 'et', 'al', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Obviously', 'longing', 'old', 'world', 'parents', 'new', 'one', 'are', 'transferring', 'misty-eyed', 'memories', 'cars', 'children.Soon', 'members', 'group', 'start', 'disappearing', 'find', 'out', 'fault', 'cannibalistic', 'group', 'called', ""'Rovers"", 'who', 'have', 'found', 'new', 'food', 'source', 'foragers', 'Ford', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'looking', 'fourteen-year-old', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'take', 'charge', 'foragers', 'others', 'swing', 'support', 'new', 'girl', 'Neon', 'Poor', 'defensive', 'choices', 'make', 'easy', 'pickings', 'foragers', 'are', 'nearly', 'slaughtered', 'Well', 'are', 'completely', 'slaughtered', 'only', 'couple', 'survive', 'then', 'twist', 'not', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'foragers', 'completely', 'rovers', 'power', 'yet', 'lucky', 'break', 'one', 'escape', 'decorate', 'face', 'warpaint', 'then', 'extract', 'gory', 'revenge.This', 'film', 'reminded', 'horrible', 'hybrid', ""'Dawson"", 'Creek', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'setting', 'names', 'dialogue', 'never', 'rang', 'true', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'foragers', 'squabbling', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'leader', 'Characters', 'usually', 'sounded', 'one', 'note', 'also', 'defined', 'leader', 'rovers', 'was', 'preposterous', 'best', 'Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'described', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'seem', 'should', 'only', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'star', 'utter', 'failure', 'movie', 'ever', 'capture', 'interest', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'habit', 'reviewing', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off.The', 'input', 'Michael', 'Madson', 'Vinnie', 'James', 'little', 'offset', 'low', 'points', 'fact', 'may', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'raising', 'expectations', 'roles', 'are', 'minor', 'giving', 'first', 'billing', 'product', 'page', 'up', 'idea', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'film', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'competent', 'enough', 'given', 'script', 'have', 'work', 'not', 'degree', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'end', 'implausible', 'annoying', 'nails', 'raked', 'chalkboard']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release
1119382,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YE1REA,Chris Pandolfi,"[16, 18]","Imagine a future that has seen the end of the world. Now imagine that a virus, overpopulation, nuclear war, a meteor, or even global warming did not cause the end: ""We simply ran out of gas."" These words were spoken via a voiceover narration at the beginning of ""Tooth & Nail,"" a post-apocalyptic thriller founded on the idea that the world's gasoline reserves will be completely drained by the year 2012. This doesn't sound too devastating, but think about it--no gas means vehicles will be unable to operate, and inoperative vehicles means that vital goods and services can no longer be delivered. But it's even worse than that. No gas also means no electricity, and no electricity means no way of making, packaging, and preserving food. In this new world, most of the population died because they starved to death.This idea is quite original and interesting. Unfortunately, it's merely the framework for the actual plot, and I'm sorry to say that the plot is pretty weak. It begins as an engaging character study but ends as a brutal, bloody slugfest, and this is bad because it actually tries to be a morality play at the same time. It also relies on a predictable plot twist that doesn't do justice to the originality of the idea--by then, the story was less interesting and more routine. I had high hopes for ""Tooth & Nail,"" simply because it started off so well; it begins with three foragers wandering the streets of Philadelphia, searching for whatever they can use to survive. Ford (Rider Strong) sees a figure running off after slitting a man's throat, and just as he's about to take the dead man's watch, they find a young woman, weak, hurt, and begging for help. Ford opts to leave her, but Dakota (Nicole DuPort) and Shepherd (Patrick Durham) decide to do the more humane thing and take her with them.For these three foragers, home is an abandoned Philadelphia hospital, and they share it with a number of other survivors. A scholarly-type named Darwin (Robert Carradine) leads this group. Because he spends a great deal of time designing a gasoline-related contraption, he doesn't do much to help the others with their daily chores, such as fixing the water pump and maintaining security. As he's introduced, the passive nature of the followers indicates that he's rapidly losing their respect. Only one--the quick-tempered Viper (Michael Kelly)--vocally opposes Darwin's methods, which puts him at odds with the rest of the group. It gets even worse when the rescued girl enters the picture: her name is Neon (Rachel Miner), and right off the bat, Viper doesn't trust her. Where did she come from? Why is she in Philadelphia? Who was the dead man she was found with? Not knowing the answers to these questions is too risky in Viper's book.But as it turns out, they have more important things to worry about. A savage band of cannibals called Rovers close in on the hospital, and they begin well-orchestrated attacks every night. Led by the sadistic whistler Jackal (Michael Madsen), their assaults are violent and downright disgusting; they rely on a myriad of weapons to make kills--such as axes, bats enhanced with nails, and meat cleavers--and every death scene features over the top gore effects. According to Neon, who claims to have lost her entire family to the Rovers, they don't rely on dead bodies for food simply because they rot too quickly. This makes sense: fresh meat is always better.At a certain point, when only a small portion of Darwin's group is left, Neon's knowledge of the Rovers gets her elected as a leader. Not that anyone is comfortable with the idea; if anything, they accept her begrudgingly, more the result of desperation than respect. A plan needs to be worked on soon--the Rovers are getting hungrier, and food is well within their reach.The rest of the film follows a formula that puts twists and turns ahead of appropriate storytelling; it seemed as if secrets were revealed just for the sake of revealing secrets, of showing how cleverly constructed a screenplay can be. But is this level of structural development necessary? Does the plot really need a hidden agenda to surprise the audience with? In this case, I don't think so; ""Tooth & Nail"" took the time to introduce an original concept, and it should have been given the chance to actually utilize it. By the end, all we end up getting is a run of the mill shock fest, a film that pays lots of attention to violence and blood but not enough to plot.Take, for example, the character of Nova (Emily Catherine Young)--she's a mute young girl who clings to Dakota like a frightened child, and she spends a great deal of time rollerblading down the halls of the hospital. This is virtually all we know about her, and that's incredibly disappointing. I wanted to know so much more about her, especially when it comes to her relationship with Dakota. Why do the two share such a strong bond? Is there a pseudo mother/daughter relationship alluded to, here? I unfortunately can't answer these questions. However, I can say plenty about the Rovers: the way they kill; the way they eat; the way some of them file their teeth down to sharp points, giving them the authentic look of carnivores. If the intention of ""Tooth & Nail"" was to be a gory exploitation film--and it seems to me that it is--then the gas-related framing device is essentially meaningless. That requires more intellectual processing than horror-driven blood and violence can handle.",3,What's Eating You?,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,5451,"['Imagine', 'future', 'seen', 'end', 'world',

Metzger ""horror expert""","[1, 2]","The opening of this film is very interesting.It's basically saying that neither war,mother nature,overpopulation or anything has caused mankind to become doomed.Rather its something much more simple.We simply ran out of gas.A simple idea that seems like a good one.Later on we learn that the experts said that we had plenty of gas left but they were wrong.With this begins the  post-apocalyptic thriller that is Tooth and Nail.The story centers around a group of survivors who take refuge in an abandoned hospital in Philly.The group is lead by Darwin who seems to be the smart,scholarly type.Also in the group are Ford(Rider Strong),Shepherd,Viper(kind of the outcast) Dakota and a young mute named Nova.One day outside of the hospital they find a girl outside(Neon) whimpering and they decide to take her in despite the protest of a few in the group.After some disagreements about chores to do Viper leaves and later that night Darwin is killed.There is blood everywhere but no body.Upon discovering this they set out to find his body.Neon then tells them they can't go outside cause they are being watched by a group of people called The Rovers.She informs them that since there is no food left they have turned to cannibalism kind of in a survival of the fittest  formula.Eventually they have a vote and Neon is elected the new leader cause she has knowledge of this group the Rovers.She has them all split up and hide when the Rovers break in the hospital.Eventually the group is  dwindled down to only a few survivors(Dakota,Neon,Nova and Ford who was attacked and beaten badly).After this there is a nice twist involving Neon and later on the reemergence of Viper.I don't want to give way the ending but overall I liked this movie a lot.The whole running out of gas idea was really good and the fact that people resorted to eating other humans for survival is  chilling.Some scenes where they show the Rovers actually sharpening their teeth with a file is cool also.While not over the top in gore or scares this film still manages to be entertaining and thought provoking.Check it out.",4,Not If I eat you first,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,2092,"['opening', 'film', 'very', 'interesting.It', 'basically', 'saying', 'war', 'mother', 'nature', 'overpopulation', 'anything', 'caused', 'mankind', 'become', 'doomed.Rather', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'simple.We', 'simply', 'ran', 'gas.A', 'simple', 'idea', 'good', 'one.Later', 'learn', 'experts', 'said', 'had', 'plenty', 'gas', 'left', 'were', 'wrong.With', 'post-apocalyptic', 'thriller', 'Tooth', 'Nail.The', 'story', 'centers', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'take', 'refuge', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'Philly.The', 'group', 'lead', 'Darwin', 'who', 'be', 'smart', 'scholarly', 'type.Also', 'group', 'are', 'Ford', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'Shepherd', 'Viper', 'kind', 'outcast', 'Dakota', 'young', 'mute', 'named', 'Nova.One', 'day', 'hospital', 'find', 'girl', 'Neon', 'whimpering', 'decide', 'take', 'protest', 'few', 'group.After', 'disagreements', 'chores', 'do', 'Viper', 'leaves', 'later', 'night', 'Darwin', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'body.Upon', 'discovering', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'body.Neon', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'outside', 'cause', 'are', 'being', 'watched', 'group', 'people', 'called', 'Rovers.She', 'food', 'left', 'have', 'turned', 'cannibalism', 'kind', 'survival', 'fittest', 'formula.Eventually', 'have', 'vote', 'Neon', 'elected', 'new', 'leader', 'cause', 'knowledge', 'group', 'Rovers.She', 'split', 'up', 'hide', 'when', 'Rovers', 'break', 'hospital.Eventually', 'group', 'dwindled', 'down', 'only', 'few', 'survivors', 'Dakota', 'Neon', 'Nova', 'Ford', 'who', 'was', 'attacked', 'beaten', 'badly', '.After', 'nice', 'twist', 'involving', 'Neon', 'later', 'reemergence', 'Viper.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'way', 'ending', 'overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot.The', 'whole', 'running', 'gas', 'idea', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'fact', 'people', 'resorted', 'eating', 'other', 'humans', 'survival', 'chilling.Some', 'scenes', 'where', 'show', 'Rovers', 'actually', 'sharpening', 'teeth', 'file', 'cool', 'also.While', 'not', 'top', 'gore', 'film', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking.Check', 'out']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release

1119394,AGMIIXPJ4597P,B000YE1REA,"J. Davis ""A Duck's Opinion is Greatly Influen...","[5, 6]","""Tooth and Nail"" takes place in a post-apocolyptic world caused by the world's supply of fuel running out. The film follows one group of survivors taking shelter in an abandoned hospital being hunted by a gang of cannibals. Overall, it was a decent flick. The picture quality was good and it appears they had a more then acceptable budget to work with as well as a good cast. ""Tooth and Nail"" had a very original concept that (I think) was just poorly executed.Downsides-My main problem with the film was the writing.Let's start with the characters. It appears that the writer just went to his local car dealership for inspiration. Here's a few of the character names in ""Tooth and Nail;"" Ford, Neon, Viper, Dakota, Torino, and Nova.  Are we supposed to believe that four years from now when the apocolypse comes we just give ourselves sweet car nicknames? (These are grown adults wanting to be called Viper and such)Other then that, apparently in a post-apocolyptic world the only weapons in existance in an entirely abandoned city are two guns, a bow and arrow, and two knives.When six people are fighting a dozen cannibals who don't have any guns, the best strategy is to run and hide. I mean you wouldn't want to hurt any of them or try to defend yourself right? Your guns are no match for their scary faces.The writing/acting was weak. At points it seemed a fourteen year old wrote and directed the scenes.Some completely unneeded sex scenes. Apocalypse films don't need sex unless its actually for plot development (i.e. Boy and His Dog).Too many plot loopholes, (i.e. a character states everyone moved south, but all the good hunting is up north. In a world dealing with starvation why would you move away from natural food and water sources and towards mass gatherings of people?)Upsides-Better then majority of the films that came out in the '06 Horror fest bunch.Good Cast.I enjoyed the premise of the film but still feel it could have been better.""Tooth and Nail"" is worth a rent on a rainy day or when your tired of rising fuel prices.

1119397,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000YE1REA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","The opening narration of ""Tooth and Nail"" will absolutely drive you up the wall.  Writer-director Mark Young (""Southern Gothic,"" ""Dead Bodies"") wants to tell the story of a small group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, so he needs a rationale for getting rid of two-thirds of the world's population.  So what does he come up with?  The world runs out of gas in 2012.  That means--wait for it--there is no electricity, because there is no gas for the trucks to take the coal from the mines to the electrical plants.  Really.  Detroit kept making gas guzzling cars instead of switching to hybrids or even electric cars (duh).  Without electricity, civilization falls and Darwin's survival of the fittest comes into play with a vengeance rarely scene outside of post-apocalyptic horror films.  There was a reason why in ""The Day After"" there were only vague hints as to why the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were lobbing nuclear missiles at each other, because the whole point was to show what the aftermath of a nuclear war would be like rather than come up with a plausible scenario for such insanity.  Your mind can just explode pointing out the problems with this scenario. Just know that the scenario in ""Tooth and Nail"" is stupid and decide to either go with the premise and see what Young does with it or hit the eject button.Watching these Horrorfest films is becoming an exercise in movie math, by which I mean that you can describe these movies by adding together movies that you have seen before.  This may be a way of reaffirming that there is nothing new under the moon when it comes to horror films, but it seems it is pretty much impossible to watch a horror film that does not remind you of other films you have seen.  So in ""Tooth and Nail"" you have a group of young people in Philadelphia trying to survive the end of the world as we know it, like in ""Dawn of the Dead"" (and countless other films), holed up in a hospital like in ""Halloween II,"" where they are assaulted by a gang that look like rejects from ""The Road Warrior"" who happen to be cannibals, but more in a ""Cannibal Holocaust"" kind of way that theHannibal Lecterculinary approach to eating human flesh.  The cannibalism part bothers me from a practical standpoint, because I do not really see the need to turn to human flesh.  Of course having seen ""I Am Legend"" I would have to think it would be easier for animals to overrun Philadelphia than it was for them to overrun New York.  But this is a world devoid of rats and squirrels or dogs and cats, as well as solar power or wind power.Everybody has code ""Top Gun""-like names, such as Jackal, Mongrel, Darwin, Neon, Viper, Dakota, Nova, etc.  By the time you get to Shepherd and Wolf the film's master metaphor should be painfully clear.  In terms of familiar faces in the crowd there is Michael Madsen as Jackal, a Rover who likes to hum a happy tune.  Robert Carradine, is trying to play the role of the professor for this group of castaways, has a familiar name, but his father, brothers, and daughter are all better known as actors.  There are also an interesting pair of Horrorfest double-dipper, with Rider Strong from this year's ""Borderland"" and Rachel Miner from last year's ""Penny Dreadful"" showing up.  This is one of those movies where they avoid telegraphing who is going to be ""the last man standing,"" so you might as well enjoying finding out who that ends up being instead of me revealing that aspect of the film here.The best part of ""Tooth and Nail"" is the ending, and I am not just being snide and saying that because of feelings of great joy that the movie was over.  Given the lame premise and the impulse of the characters to behave stupidly, it was nice to see somebody use their brains at the end.  I liked the ending, and in a world where I am usually woefully disappointed by the endings of horror films, that is enough to justify rounding up on this 2007 film.  I should also add that for all those times you wonder why people in a horror movie in desperate fear for their lives would take time out to have sex, this film provides a pretty realistic reason for one couple to do so.  However, once again all we get for special features on the DVD are the Miss Horrorfest contest webepisodes, which I am starting to take as a bad sign.  With the first crop of Horrorfest DVDs there were scads of extras; so far I have only watched three of the second set of 8 films 2 die 4, and already two of the DVDs have nothing new in terms of bonus features.  Is Lionssgate pinching pennies or are these writer-directors simply unwilling to push, or even just stand behind, their work?

COME ON !the only bad thing about this might be the bad clothing of the cannibals, they looked a bit silly..but thats a minor thingIt might not be as scary as other horror fest movies, but it is the most entertainingI saw about half of the 07 horror fest, and i think tooth and nail is the best out of them, to me it was better thanMulberry Street - After Dark Horror Fest (2007)and better theBorderland - After Dark Horror Fest..Tooth and nail is the best, followed byCrazy Eights - After Dark Horror Fest..In summary, give this a chance, its really good ! a solid 4.5 stars",5,Very good  thriller..why would anyone give this a zero ?,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1640,"['Hi..I', 'had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'i', 'mean', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', '2007', 'Horror', 'fest', 'movies', 'especially', 'tooth', 'nail..So', 'i', 'statred', 'watching', 'more', 'i', 'watched', 'more', 'i', 'got', 'found', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'movie..I', 'guess', 'most', 'know', 'postapocalyptic', 'thriller', 'involving', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'settle', 'deserted', 'hospital', 'get', 'attacked', 'group', 'cannibals', 'pretty', 'simple', 'huh', 'pretty', 'good', 'first', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'i', 'was', 'surprised', 'familiar', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'also', 'high', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'indy', 'type', 'production', 'got', 'surprised', 'proper', 'productions.the', 'plot', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'started', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'built', 'up', 'thrills', 'action..lots', 'chasing', 'hiding', 'dark..i', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'big', 'hospital', 'setting', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place..I', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'time', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'surprised', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'gave', 'zero', 'COME', 'ON', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'clothing', 'cannibals', 'looked', 'bit', 'silly..but', 'minor', 'thingIt', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'scary', 'other', 'horror', 'fest', 'movies', 'most', 'entertainingI', 'saw', 'half', '07', 'horror', 'fest', 'i', 'think', 'nail', 'best', 'was', 'better', 'thanMulberry', 'Street', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest', '2007', 'better', 'theBorderland', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest..Tooth', 'nail', 'best', 'followed', 'byCrazy', 'Eights', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest..In', 'summary', 'give', 'chance', 'really', 'good', 'solid', '4.5', 'stars']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release

I watched ""Mulberry Street"" and ""Borderland"" and, personally, I thought this film blew them both away.Michael Madsen's part had been described as too small.  I agree that his part should have been larger; however, his acting ability made that part live as, perhaps, only he can do, with the character having an evil, yet carefree air to it.I love ""End of the World"" movies and the reason for this one was very interesting (I won't give it away as some did).Sure there were some screwy parts as well as some parts of the movie that flopped a bit.  But, as a suspense thriller horror film, I found it kept my attention for most of the film (therefore, the 4 rating instead of 5"".  The film explained itself well and it was not an impossible setting; not one of those films that you had to ""forget"" some parts in order for it to be realistic.  This one could happen.I think I loved it best because, in the tradition of ""Aliens"", it has a woman as the heroine as well as a little girl.  To make it even better, there was a woman as the head of the baddies.  The battle scenes were well-done and the film did not have to have the women running around in skimpy little outfits (not that that is a bad thing) to keep the viewer's attention.

Rachel Miner{Penny Dreadful} has a relatively large role as well.Basically its the story of a group of survivors trying to stay alive after society has fallen apart due to all gasoline supplies being quenched. A group of cannibals taking survival of the fittest a bit too far makes matters much worse.The origin story is very original. all gasoline has been drained from the earth. all reserves are gone. without gasoline, there is no electricity, theres not even a way transport coal for power at this point. with no transportation of goods, most people die from starvation(2/3 of the world's population) thus setting up out story. there are a few holes, like what about wind and solar power? generally everything is handled really well though.as the movie starts, it takes some time to get to know the characters and their surroundings. all the sane survivors in the area have barricaded themselves inside a large building to try and stay safe from the dangers of the roaming cannibals. as time goes on we're introduced to the previously mentioned menaces, and believe me, they're ruthless.there is much better production value than any others ive seen in the series. theres great lighting/camera work that perfectly sets the mood of this post-apocalyptic thriller. great acting all around, and brutally convincing effects make this one heck of a ride. any fans of horror/the apocalypse should at leased give this one a rental.",5,the end is nigh,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2006,"['ive', 'seen', '3', '8', 'films', 'die', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'Mulberry', 'St', 'Nightmare', 'Man', 'other', 'Nail', 'deffinitely', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'easily', 'anything', 'last', 'year', 'opinion.An', 'star', 'cast', 'leased', 'compared', 'others', 'series', 'led', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'full', 'smaller', 'roles', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'recognize', 'including', 'two', 'stone', 'cold', 'tough', 'guys', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Resevoir', 'Dogs', 'Kill', 'Bill', '1+2', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Snatch', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'major', 'bonus', 'points', 'including', 'two', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'relatively', 'large', 'role', 'well.Basically', 'story', 'group', 'survivors', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'society', 'fallen', 'apart', 'due', 'gasoline', 'supplies', 'being', 'quenched', 'group', 'cannibals', 'taking', 'survival', 'fittest', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'matters', 'much', 'origin', 'story', 'very', 'original', 'gasoline', 'been', 'drained', 'earth', 'reserves', 'are', 'gone', 'gasoline', 'electricity', 'not', 'even', 'way', 'transport', 'coal', 'power', 'point', 'transportation', 'goods', 'most', 'people', 'die', 'starvation', '2/3', 'world', 'population', 'thus', 'setting', 'up', 'out', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'what', 'wind', 'solar', 'power', 'generally', 'everything', 'handled', 'really', 'well', 'though.as', 'movie', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'sane', 'survivors', 'area', 'have', 'barricaded', 'large', 'building', 'try', 'stay', 'safe', 'dangers', 'roaming', 'cannibals', 'time', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'menaces', 'believe', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'production', 'value', 'others', 'ive', 'seen', 'series', 'great', 'lighting/camera', 'work', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'post-apocalyptic', 'thriller', 'great', 'acting', 'brutally', 'convincing', 'effects', 'make', 'one', 'heck', 'ride', 'fans', 'horror/the', 'apocalypse', 'should', 'leased', 'give', 'one', 'rental']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release

But I'll always give a film a chance, so I figured, hey, why not give these guys a shot, see if they ever get up from this table and let something happen to them.I didn't look up any plot outline or actors before watching this film, so this was quite a leap for me, since I literally had NO IDEA if anything might happen to them, except for the knowledge that films usually involve conflict and despite a pathetic leadership struggle amoung the survivors of a POSTAPOCALYPTICFUTURE there didn't seem to be any yet.It turns out the conflict is that Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones  want to eat them.The film starts out as if it's going to be a one-by-one slasher movie, but as soon as it starts to pick up its stride in that direction it decides to be a gang of cannibals attacking movie. Except that they only really attack three times. And I didn't feel half as tense as I did when I thought it was a slasher movie. At least with the slasher, I didn't know it was coming. But then we switch to CANNIBALS WHO ATTACK AT NIGHT so clearly it will happen at night, although the advantage to this was that it gave time for some terribly boring attempts at character development. I could feel the director just begging me to feel involved with these people. Pleading with me to feel tension that these family killers were coming. And, according to the film, it's not watching your family die that gets you, it's the waiting!At least I can say watching my family die would be more unpleasant than waiting for the film to end.Vinnie Jones was great as the crazy homicidal man, which is good because if he did it wrong after all these years I'd be worried about his future.But other than the popular names in the cast, I felt like I've seen this film before. Several times. The production was low and lacked style. Maybe they should have dropped the stars to allow for some money to be freed up elsewhere. I've seen a lot better work for a lot less than the 4.2 million dollars wikipedia says they spent on it.Finally, the film rounds up with a reasonably predictable ending (except for the sole survivor donning ridiculous gear and facepaint in a scene that it seemed was meant to be emotional and adrenaline pumping but of course wasn't.) and I'm left debating whether I should waltz into the rest of the After Dark films I haven't watched or if I should prepare myself better.",1,not very good,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,2514,"['have', 'seen', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'involve', 'people', 'sitting', 'looking', 'glum', 'about', 'ruined', 'film', ""'ll"", 'always', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'figured', 'hey', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'guys', 'shot', 'see', 'ever', 'get', 'up', 'table', 'let', 'something', 'happen', 'them.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'up', 'plot', 'outline', 'actors', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'leap', 'literally', 'had', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'anything', 'might', 'happen', 'knowledge', 'films', 'usually', 'involve', 'conflict', 'pathetic', 'leadership', 'struggle', 'survivors', 'POSTAPOCALYPTICFUTURE', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'yet.It', 'out', 'conflict', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'want', 'eat', 'them.The', 'film', 'out', 'going', 'be', 'one-by-one', 'slasher', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'pick', 'up', 'stride', 'direction', 'be', 'gang', 'cannibals', 'attacking', 'movie', 'only', 'really', 'attack', 'three', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'half', 'as', 'tense', 'did', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'slasher', 'movie', 'least', 'slasher', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'coming', 'then', 'switch', 'CANNIBALS', 'WHO', 'ATTACK', 'AT', 'NIGHT', 'so', 'clearly', 'will', 'happen', 'night', 'advantage', 'was', 'gave', 'time', 'terribly', 'boring', 'attempts', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'feel', 'director', 'just', 'begging', 'feel', 'involved', 'people', 'Pleading', 'feel', 'tension', 'family', 'killers', 'were', 'coming', 'according', 'film', 'not', 'watching', 'family', 'die', 'waiting', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'watching', 'family', 'die', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'waiting', 'film', 'end.Vinnie', 'Jones', 'was', 'great', 'crazy', 'homicidal', 'man', 'good', 'did', 'wrong', 'years', ""'d"", 'be', 'worried', 'future.But', 'other', 'popular', 'names', 'cast', 'felt', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'before', 'Several', 'times', 'production', 'was', 'low', 'lacked', 'style', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'dropped', 'stars', 'allow', 'money', 'be', 'freed', 'up', 'elsewhere', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'better', 'work', 'lot', 'less', '4.2', 'million', 'dollars', 'wikipedia', 'spent', 'it.Finally', 'film', 'up', 'reasonably', 'predictable', 'ending', 'sole', 'survivor', 'donning', 'ridiculous', 'gear', 'facepaint', 'scene', 'seemed', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'emotional', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'left', 'debating', 'should', 'waltz', 'rest', 'Dark', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'should', 'prepare', 'better']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release
1119405,A2ZRV40FWALSQB,B000YE1REA,"Richard Nervous ""Dedicated Horror Fan""","[1, 2]","Oh my lord, how much more can I take of these After Dark Horrorfest movies being adventure/action movies?  I've watched all of the first year movies and at least they all had a semblance of horror but this 2nd year crop (I'm behind a little since the 3rd year is in theaters as I type) has been a serious hit and miss horrorfest!  I mean Borderland was a decent flick (slow at times) but there was not an ounce of true horror.  Now we have Tooth and Nail.  It starts out promising and sets up some interesting shots but this is just another futuristic action/adventure movie!This reminds me of many of the 80's Roger Corman future flicks that he produced where the roving bands of mutants/killers go around in medieval attire and kill the ""good"" guys.  While this movie was not terrible, it was not a HORROR film, isn't that the point of a horrorfest?The story begins in the year 2012 when gasoline has run out and people started rioting and killing everyone because there was no way to heat their homes or run their machines.  That's the explanation given (I guess this is the message in the movie that we need to develop alternative energy sources now and to not believe the government) in the movie and we join a small band of people that are ""surviving.""  The group comes across a couple (one with his throat slit) and a woman and bring her back to their ""camp"" in a hospital.  Well we learn that there are roving bands of people that eat people called (real original name here) rovers!  Boy it must have taken several months to come up with that original name.  The rest of the movie is having this group battle the rovers.  That's it.  Where's the HORROR?If the movies continue like this they should call it adventurefest.  There are a couple of splattery kill scenes but overall this movie really doesn't have many horror elements.  I would have liked it better if it wasn't part of the horrorfest.It's ok as a futuristic action/adventure movie but it's not a horror film and because of that I only can give it 2 stars.  I sure hope the others in this series are better, I still have about 5 to go.  I'm starting to get tired of this series but I still have my allegiance to anything called horror. Again this is not a horrible movie but it's not what I was hoping for.  Just because there are cannibals in a movie doesn't make it a horror film.

There is little about this flick that is new. While it takes place in a postapocalyptic world, there is limited relevance about that. There is a brief prologue describing recent events (really, the explanation is quite mundane), then we're off to meet a small group of survivors who have found refuge in an abandoned metropolitan hospital. Their plan for civility comes apart abruptly when they are faced with the ""Rovers.""The Rovers are a cannibalisitic, sadistic, muscle bound band of survivors who act as the hunters, as opposed to the gatherers holed up in the hospital. There are good guys and bad guys. No ambiguity here, as an intelligent movie might suggest. No backstory. No explanation. Just big hungry men who hunt after dark.One might think an enormous hospital would provide fertile grounds for hiding. One might also think that living in the hospital would breed some familiarity..particulalry where there might be dead ends. Alas, those would be incorrect assumptions. As in most horror movies, our heroes and heroines are not very bright.Having said that, there are real moments of fear when the Rovers are hunting. And a plot twist or two does lead to a satisfying conclusion. The filmmakers do a nice job of creating tension and there are very few moments where the pace slows to anything that would lead to disinterest. Even the acting is competent for such low budget fare. This movie is ultimately about hide and seek, the weak against the strong, survival, and revenge. Circumstances and causes are just window dressing. From that standpoint, this is an entertaining, if not forgettable, thriller to add to your collection.",3,A solid three stars,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,1864,"['First', ""'d"", 'say', 'not', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'stretch', 'imagination', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'namely', 'horror', 'fests', 'measure', 'up', 'reasonably', 'well', 'little', 'flick', 'new', 'place', 'postapocalyptic', 'world', 'limited', 'relevance', 'brief', 'prologue', 'describing', 'recent', 'events', 'really', 'explanation', 'quite', 'mundane', 'then', ""'re"", 'meet', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'refuge', 'abandoned', 'metropolitan', 'hospital', 'plan', 'civility', 'apart', 'abruptly', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'Rovers', 'Rovers', 'are', 'cannibalisitic', 'sadistic', 'muscle', 'bound', 'band', 'survivors', 'who', 'act', 'hunters', 'opposed', 'gatherers', 'holed', 'up', 'hospital', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'ambiguity', 'here', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'might', 'suggest', 'backstory', 'explanation', 'Just', 'big', 'hungry', 'men', 'who', 'hunt', 'dark.One', 'might', 'think', 'enormous', 'hospital', 'would', 'provide', 'fertile', 'grounds', 'hiding', 'One', 'might', 'also', 'think', 'living', 'hospital', 'would', 'breed', 'familiarity..particulalry', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'dead', 'ends', 'Alas', 'would', 'be', 'incorrect', 'assumptions', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'bright.Having', 'said', 'are', 'real', 'moments', 'fear', 'when', 'Rovers', 'are', 'hunting', 'plot', 'twist', 'two', 'lead', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'creating', 'tension', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'pace', 'anything', 'would', 'lead', 'disinterest', 'Even', 'acting', 'competent', 'such', 'low', 'budget', 'fare', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'hide', 'seek', 'weak', 'strong', 'survival', 'revenge', 'Circumstances', 'causes', 'are', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'standpoint', 'entertaining', 'not', 'forgettable', 'thriller', 'add', 'collection']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release
1119407,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000YE1REA,trashcanman,"[3, 3]","Tooth and Nail was an entry into the reasonably successful After Dark HorrorFest film festival series, and it's an outstanding one at that. While ADHF titles rarely live up to their advertising as being too extreme for theatrical release, I find them to be almost across-the-board watchable-to-enjoyable. I never trip over myself rushing to see the 8 annual releases, but I don't avoid them either. Pretty decent low-budget horror flicks overall, but never mind-blowing. This one comes to me a couple years late and shapes up to be one of my favorite ADHF films I've seen thusfar. It's kind of surprising that this movie hasn't been done before since cannibalism is a rather common theme in dystopian sci-fi, but it's never to my knowledge been done this way and I very much like it.Tooth and Nail opens in a world after the end of civilization. No nuclear war, no plague, no meteors, no climate change; not even a zombie in sight. The world ended when we simply ran out of gas. Even as the last drop of oil was pumped from the Earth, Detroit continued cranking out gas-guzzlers, and in our own stubbornness we kept on living like nothing was wrong. But with no fuel for our power plants or the trucks to deliver food, society collapsed almost instantly with mankind killing each other with everyone trying to gather every scrap of what was left for themselves. This may well be the most plausible apocalypse yet.  We meet our group of survivors holed up in a large hospital and in pretty good spirits all things considered. They've got food, shelter, sexy time, a benevolent and intelligent leader, and cool nicknames for everyone. There's even the requisite mute kid to dote on. The characters are very well established in typical Stephen King style. Now comes the good stuff. Shortly after rescuing a wanderer (quite the looker, too) from a murderer in Mad Max garb, the band's leader, The Professor, turns up missing with only his glasses and a whole lot of blood to show for it. What follows is a harrowing bit of suspense and terror that was very successful in pulling me into the plight of the survivors. Trapped and surrounded by a gang of brutal cannibals, our heroes/victims face the prospect of losing one of their number each night and each must choose whether to abandon their friends to their fate and attempt to escape by themselves, or stick together and try to repel the invaders. What would you do?What makes this film work is the suspense of the cannibals only taking one survivor a night, preferring fresh meat. The systematic and methodical nature of the predators stalking their victims through the hospital until one of them makes a kill and then leaving for another 24 hours while the remaining survivors stew in their own terror is what horror is all about for me. And when Michael Madsen (slowly whistling ""I've Been Working on the Railroad"" as he goes) and Vinnie ""Mahogany"" Jones are two of the predators, that is some freaky stuff. The story never goes over-the-top and is portrayed quite realistically, which I wholeheartedly applaud. I was literally wracking my brain coming up with escape plans of my own as I watched the film unfold and that is how you spell success in a movie like this. The only reason this doesn't get a higher rating from me is I do feel that the story takes no chances, coming off as a bit standard and the twist was extremely obvious to me almost from the beginning. But honestly, the film does not rely on said twist and really it was more of a realistic portrayal of how such an organization would work in that kind of landscape then a true twist so you can't really blame the filmmaker for exploiting the gullibility of the innocent. It wouldn't work on me, though. Tooth and Nail didn't really thrill me with it's boldness (a little more exploitation would have earned it major bonus points), but it is pretty rock-solid in it's portrayal of post-apocalyptic cannibalism so I'd consider it a must-see for fans of that sort of thing. Slasher fans will be well-served as well. I wanted more gore (I think the 70's cannibal craze kind of ruined me), but what is there is pretty effective so you won't be terribly wanting for violence.Tooth and Nail is a credit to the ADHF series and shouldn't be missed by those who enjoy exploring the potential horrors of the end of civilization. I've seen better and bolder, but this one absolutely nails down what it is trying to do and serves up legit horror with a strong story and nearly-flawless pacing.3 1/2 stars, rounded up because post-apocalyptic cannibals are the coolest cannibals of all.",4,"""Not if I eat you first.""",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,4594,"['Nail', 'was', 'entry', 'reasonably', 'successful', 'Dark', 'HorrorFest', 'film', 'festival', 'series', 'outstanding', 'one', 'ADHF', 'titles', 'rarely', 'live', 'up', 'advertising', 'being', 'too', 'extreme', 'theatrical', 'release', 'find', 'be', 'almost', 'across-the-board', 'watchable-to-enjoyable', 'never', 'trip', 'rushing', 'see', '8', 'annual', 'releases', 'do', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'Pretty', 'decent', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flicks', 'overall', 'never', 'mind-blowing', 'one', 'couple', 'years', 'late', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'ADHF', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thusfar', 'kind', 'surprising', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'cannibalism', 'rather', 'common', 'theme', 'dystopian', 'sci-fi', 'never', 'knowledge', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'very', 'much', 'it.Tooth', 'Nail', 'world', 'end', 'civilization', 'nuclear', 'war', 'plague', 'meteors', 'climate', 'change', 'not', 'even', 'zombie', 'sight', 'world', 'ended', 'when', 'simply', 'ran', 'gas', 'Even', 'last', 'drop', 'oil', 'was', 'pumped', 'Earth', 'Detroit', 'continued', 'cranking', 'out', 'gas-guzzlers', 'own', 'stubbornness', 'kept', 'living', 'nothing', 'was', 'wrong', 'fuel', 'power', 'plants', 'trucks', 'deliver', 'food', 'society', 'collapsed', 'almost', 'instantly', 'mankind', 'killing', 'other', 'everyone', 'trying', 'gather', 'scrap', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'plausible', 'apocalypse', 'yet', 'meet', 'group', 'survivors', 'holed', 'up', 'large', 'hospital', 'pretty', 'good', 'spirits', 'things', 'considered', ""'ve"", 'got', 'food', 'shelter', 'sexy', 'time', 'benevolent', 'intelligent', 'leader', 'cool', 'nicknames', 'everyone', 'even', 'requisite', 'mute', 'kid', 'dote', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'established', 'typical', 'Stephen', 'King', 'style', 'Now', 'good', 'stuff', 'Shortly', 'rescuing', 'wanderer', 'looker', 'too', 'murderer', 'Mad', 'Max', 'garb', 'band', 'leader', 'Professor', 'up', 'missing', 'only', 'glasses', 'whole', 'lot', 'blood', 'show', 'What', 'harrowing', 'bit', 'suspense', 'terror', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'pulling', 'plight', 'survivors', 'Trapped', 'surrounded', 'gang', 'brutal', 'cannibals', 'heroes/victims', 'face', 'prospect', 'losing', 'one', 'number', 'night', 'must', 'choose', 'abandon', 'friends', 'fate', 'attempt', 'escape', 'stick', 'together', 'try', 'repel', 'invaders', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'What', 'film', 'work', 'suspense', 'cannibals', 'only', 'taking', 'one', 'survivor', 'night', 'preferring', 'fresh', 'meat', 'systematic', 'methodical', 'nature', 'predators', 'stalking', 'victims', 'hospital', 'one', 'kill', 'then', 'leaving', '24', 'hours', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'stew', 'own', 'terror', 'what', 'horror', 'when', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'slowly', 'whistling', ""'ve"", 'Been', 'Working', 'Railroad', 'Vinnie', 'Mahogany', 'Jones', 'are', 'two', 'predators', 'freaky', 'stuff', 'story', 'never', 'over-the-top', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'realistically', 'wholeheartedly', 'applaud', 'was', 'literally', 'wracking', 'brain', 'coming', 'up', 'escape', 'plans', 'own', 'watched', 'film', 'unfold', 'how', 'spell', 'success', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', ""n't"", 'get', 'higher', 'rating', 'do', 'feel', 'story', 'chances', 'coming', 'off', 'bit', 'standard', 'twist', 'was', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'almost', 'beginning', 'honestly', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'said', 'twist', 'really', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'how', 'such', 'organization', 'would', 'work', 'kind', 'landscape', 'then', 'true', 'twist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'filmmaker', 'exploiting', 'gullibility', 'innocent', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'though', 'Tooth', 'Nail', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'thrill', 'boldness', 'little', 'more', 'exploitation', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'major', 'points', 'pretty', 'rock-solid', 'portrayal', 'post-apocalyptic', 'cannibalism', ""'d"", 'consider', 'must-see', 'fans', 'sort', 'thing', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'well-served', 'well', 'wanted', 'more', 'gore', 'think', '70', 'cannibal', 'craze', 'kind', 'ruined', 'what', 'pretty', 'effective', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'terribly', 'wanting', 'violence.Tooth', 'Nail', 'credit', 'ADHF', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'who', 'enjoy', 'exploring', 'potential', 'horrors', 'end', 'civilization', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'bolder', 'one', 'absolutely', 'down', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'serves', 'up', 'legit', 'horror', 'strong', 'story', 'nearly-flawless', 'pacing.3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'post-apocalyptic', 'cannibals', 'are', 'coolest', 'cannibals']",Tooth & Nail Theatrical Release
