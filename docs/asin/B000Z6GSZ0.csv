There's one really amusing scene about 70% through the movie that is worth holding on for, but for the rest it's as predictable as any Hollywood product. Although I tend to favor European movies over their US counterparts, this is one film that could easily have been made on the West Coast. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of chemistry between the two protagonists - although we all expect them to get together and the plot moves laboriously towards the inevitable conclusion, it's just not believable in any way when it finally happens.

It's original title in France, ""Prte-moi ta main"" (""Lend Me Your Hand""), captures what the movie is about: Chabat's Luis effectively renting Gainsbourg's Emma's hand as part of his self-hatched, complicated plot to get his overbearing family off his back on the question of marriage and stability.

No matter how far-fetched the premise, how dumb the dialogue, or how predictable the plot, most of us have fallen for a romcom.I DO (or, ""How to Get Married and Stay Single"") is a guilty pleasure to enjoy without shame. It is a smart, well-written, well-made comedy. It's populated with terrific characters and plausible complications that keep you guessing.Luis (Alain Chabat) is the little brother in a family of older, domineering women. He has been unsuccessful in securing a wife. This fact is fine with him, but not with his mother and sisters who constantly nag him to find a nice woman and settle down.With the help of a friend, he hatches a plan. He will meet and become engaged to the fetching Emma (Charlotte Gainsbourg). And she will dramatically leave him at the altar, thus indelibly breaking his heart. This trauma, he feels, will quiet the nags for once and for all.But it won't work out that way, of course.

1121239,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B000Z6GSZ0,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[18, 18]","This is a little French comedy that kind of sneaked up on me, turned out to be funny and romantic, without being sappy. It is pretty typical of popular French films, good ensemble cast, good filming, beautiful locations, sexual tension, and a simple story.Luis is ""the nose"" at a perfume company. He is the only son with five sisters and a mother; his father Hercules died when Luis was young. Luis is 42 and unmarried. His sisters and mother not only do his laundry and are essentially his wives; they also rule his life. At dinner they decide it is time for Luis to get married. They place ads for him, chat on line with potential dates, and set him up over and over again. Finally he tires of this, in order to get his sisters and mother off his back, he decides to hire a girl to agree to marry him, but leave him at the altar (in the French case, its not show up at City Hall for the official legal wedding). He hires Emma (Charlotte Gainsbourg). The humor really starts at this time.I happen to love Charlotte Gainsbourg, the daughter of Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. Charlotte has the beauty and subtle sexiness of her mother. Her voice and look is reminiscent of Jane Birkin's singing voice and acting during the 70's. Charlotte delivers a funny and sexy performance in I Do (or Prete-moi Ta Main - literally lend me your hand in marriage). The chemistry builds very slowly with Luis (Alain Chabat, a fairly well known character actor in France). This slow build is just exactly right, its courtship at its best. The sisters are just so funny at telling Luis what to do. The whole cast is pretty decent.The film is 90 minutes long. The last 20 minutes are a bit long, the film needed to get moving a bit more at the end. Otherwise the pacing was excellent up that point. The scenes in Paris are beautiful. Its worth looking up from the subtitles to study the background - Places des Vosges, Hotel de Ville, and some other random squares. Luis is truly a skinflint at spending money, he drives a very old Peugeot 504, in contrast to the amount of money he actually pays Emma. The framing, movement, and cutting are all work a day standard fare; nothing creative or new, just well done.I Do is only available in French with English subtitles off or on. The translation is generally pretty good. There was an odd slip when Emma and Luis are talking about money and the French was 3,000 but the subtitle said 5,000. Oh nothing serious.The film is not rated, but would probably be R for language, sexual references, and a few kinky scenes. There is no nudity. In France, this film is U 'All Audiences.' The DVD contains a few extra features not very worth watching. Deleted scenes, all needed to stay deleted. A goof reel that is edited for the jokes, not funny. A Making Of Featurette about 23 minutes long, very bad. A producers version of the trailer for the film - sort of tells the whole story all the way to the end. And finally previews from Lions Gate.With some funny jokes. Some good sexual humor. An interesting story that does show how not so bright men can be. A very lovely Charlotte Gainsbourg.

1121242,A3Q7ZXHEZBE4IJ,B000Z6GSZ0,"Judith Johnson ""JJ""","[0, 1]","I Do (Prte-moi ta Main) is a tres entertaining flick starring Alain Chabat (Beaumarchais the Scoundrel) as a rather insufferable womanizing bachelor (Luis) and the unconventionally beautiful singer and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane Eyre) as an Angleina Joile-type, free spirited woman (Emma). The initial premise that the womanizing perfumer Luis is spoiled rotten and his assorted sisters are tired of doing his housecleaning, laundry, etc. is rather thin since he could obviously hire a housekeeper.However, it allows for several moderately entertaining montages and introduces us to Emma, his best friend's single sister, who is pretty desperate for a job and accepts Luis' offer to pose as his fiancee who will jilt him at the altar and get his family off his back.This being a romantic comedy, you can probably figure out the plot resolution for yourself.  All the cast is very good but Gainsbourgh is stellar and makes her outlandish yet vulnerable character so appealing that one roots for her to emerge a winner.

Unfortunately, I've either set the bar too high, or I'm unfairly comparing it to the aforementioned French gems. Either way, I'm disappointed.Prte-moi ta main (the original French title) centers around Luis Costa (Alain Chabat), the lone XY chromosome in a sea of female siblings. Luis is a nose, creating scents for a major cosmetics company run by a melodramatic CEO. His best friend is a skinflint co-worker who would rather starve than pay for coffee. Luis is pleased with his life, as-is, until an evening meal with his mother and sisters. The movie jumps the shark in the first 15-minutes when - without any real build up - his sisters turn on him all at once (they are tired of handling chores that would be expected of a wife, such as laundry) and inform him he will be married.Even if I believed they could dictate to a 40-something year old man that he was going to marry - and honestly, I don't buy that part one bit - things take a turn for the bizarre when Luis decides he's going to fake a marriage to get them all off his back. Enter the miser's sister Emma (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who is currently single and jobless, but wants to adopt a child. It's hardly unexpected that they don't hit it off - otherwise the movie would be over in 30 minutes - and of course a series of comic high jinks and misunderstandings follow.There are a number of very funny moments, and to their credit the actors commit themselves to the roles. The problem is, even after 80 minutes there really doesn't seem to be any reason for the two of them to get together. Friends? Maybe. Love and romance? Quoi!? Luis has consistently been a heel, and Emma's expressed little interest beyond her possible adoption. Formula demands that the two get together, but much the way the movie started off with an unbelievable familial demand, it ends with a poorly engineered pairing. Discovering the other person is not a complete jerk transforms mercenary tendencies to true-love in seconds. It's as implausible as... having your sisters dictate to you when you're going to marry.For me, compared to the wonderful fare offered by other French directors such as Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Francis Veber, this falls short.

I liked the film the first time I saw it so much that I played the DVD several additional times.I enjoy comedy, and I really appreciate one that deals with the intrigue that can often appear in a family.  Granted, I was not raised in a family with five sisters, and I successfully resisted family pressures that were brought during my life which tended to push me to date certain girls, prepare for a certain career, and the like.  I can identify with certain family pressures.There is something really appealing about a film that has a certain naive gentleness that seems so lacking in most movies today. Some of the things portrayed are typical of a comedy of manners, and some of them may appear to be trite, but I found it nonetheless well put together and well acted.  I love films with happy endings.I was impressed by the fact that this film was nominated for three C&eacute;sar awards (French equivalent of Academy Awards), for Best Actor, Alain Chabat, Best Actress (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and Best Supporting Actress (Bernadette Lafont).

I've like Charlotte Gainsbourg since I first saw her in ""Jane Ayre"", and Alain Chabat is a fixture overseas, so give it a try, I thought.  It didn't disappoint.Basically, the story is Chabat's creation: single, aging, Lothario with a nose for perfume wants to get his overbearing, all watching family off his back because they want him to finally get married.  He devises a scheme in which he hires a woman(Gainsbourg)to pretend to be his fiancee so that eventually, for different tried reasons, they break up, or she dumps him and/or his family hates her, etc., and his clan will finally just leave him alone.Of course, the best laid plans misfire, and misfire, and misfire, no matter what he does.  And his 'finacee' continues to charge more for each fiasco.  She has her own reason for securing stability in her life, but there's no intent of either becoming romantically involved with each other.  At least not at first.  Thus the romantic part of the romantic comedy.Chabat's expressions and reactions are hilarious.  Gainsbourg comes across at first a woman in charge, cool and sarcastic, but underneeth, quite vulnerable and charming, eventually, trying to wake up the dope to reality.  The family and friends like any good RC are both quirky and caring in their own way.

Turns out this movie is quite delightful.""I Do"" (90 min.; originally released in France in 2006) is a light-hearted French comedy about a 43 yr. old guy (Alain Chabat) who is pested about his family regarding his unsettled marriage status. Alain hires the sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg) of a co-worker in an elaborate plan to charm his family and then have a supposedly disastrous outcome at a fake wedding. Many problems arise and along the way, Alain and Charlotte happen to actually start liking each other. You'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out but Charlotte oozes charm throughout the movie.In all, this is quite a charming rom-com, delightfully done French-style, and I ended up enjoying this quite a bit. As a complete aside, Charlotte Gainsbourg has a strong musical career in addition to acting, and her 2010 album ""IRM"" met with a lot of critical acclaim (with a strong assist from Beck, who wrote all of the songs). I had the good fortune of catching Charlotte in concert at last year's Coachella music festival, and her set was one of THE highlights of the festival for me.

A grown up man of 43 years old, Louis Castros (or affectionately known as Pipou to his family) still had his mother & 5 sisters looking after his well-being.  One day, they had enough & they wanted him to find a wife to take over their duties.  So, he concocted a seemingly perfect plan: hired himself a woman who pretended to be his girlfriend & on his wedding day, she would have a no-show & he would feign depression & so his family wouldn't bother him ever again about marriage.  That woman came in the form of his best friend's sister, Emmanuelle who was desperate to get a stable job & to be qualified for his adopted son from Brazil.  Thus, a contractual relationship was struck when both of them needed one another's help.  Louis was dumbfounded when his first plan failed miserably.  So, a second plan was hatched.  This time, Emma needed to be a bitch to the point that the family would resent her & they would perhaps told Louis not to marry her.  That worked but the problem was they fall in love for real.  How would Louis cope with this situation when his family this time told him to choose between them or Emma?  Would Louis be a grown man and dealt with it properly or he would simply run away from his responsibility?  A light-hearted comedy that was never trite.

Also, it is one of the few films that I have seen in the realm of romantic comedy that focuses solely on romance and love compared to buddy comedies like I Love You, Man. The film is surprisingly effective and compact enough with reasonably done performances especially from the humourously uncontrollable Chabat playing Luis Costa. Also, it takes much of its heart and soul to focusing on how people react and struggle in quick-time situations without bogging down too much into the philosophy or slowness of it all. It feels very much like a Hollywood film but that can sometimes be at fault on certain occasions especially when considering the film does lag in some of its emotional bite and story structure.For a commercial foreign-language work, I Do is not all that bad but it is not all that great. It can be said as somewhere in the middle but the film, as a whole, works best for quirky men 25 and older who feel disillusioned about relationships and the messages and questions it may provide about its story and subject matter are all convincing and bold. Bold out of concern that the state of marriage and relationships are very shaky and dysfunctional these days with high divorce rates or infidelity.""",3,"A light-hearted rom-com that manages to provide intriguing discussion about dating, marriage, and relationships",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1765,"['Prete-moi', 'ta', 'main', 'surprisingly', 'French', 'ta', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'la', 'be', 'used', 'instead', 'hand', 'not', 'considered', 'possessive', 'noun', 'Lend', 'Me', 'Your', 'Hand', 'rough', 'translation', 'English', 'title-', 'Do', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Alain', 'Chabat', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'story', 'man', 'trying', 'please', 'family', 'marrying', 'woman', 'being', 'late', '43', 'years', 'old.I', 'Do', 'Rent', 'Wife', 'countries', 'one', 'few', 'French', 'films', 'not', 'entirely', 'hailed', 'important', 'arthouse', 'classic', 'Amelie', 'A', 'bout', 'souffle', 'Also', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'realm', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'solely', 'romance', 'love', 'compared', 'buddy', 'comedies', 'Love', 'Man', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'compact', 'enough', 'reasonably', 'done', 'performances', 'especially', 'humourously', 'uncontrollable', 'Chabat', 'playing', 'Luis', 'Costa', 'Also', 'much', 'heart', 'soul', 'focusing', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'struggle', 'quick-time', 'situations', 'bogging', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'philosophy', 'slowness', 'very', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'fault', 'certain', 'occasions', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'film', 'lag', 'emotional', 'bite', 'story', 'structure.For', 'commercial', 'foreign-language', 'work', 'Do', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'film', 'whole', 'best', 'quirky', 'men', '25', 'older', 'who', 'feel', 'disillusioned', 'relationships', 'messages', 'questions', 'may', 'provide', 'story', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'convincing', 'bold', 'Bold', 'concern', 'state', 'marriage', 'relationships', 'are', 'very', 'shaky', 'dysfunctional', 'days', 'high', 'divorce', 'rates', 'infidelity']",N/A
