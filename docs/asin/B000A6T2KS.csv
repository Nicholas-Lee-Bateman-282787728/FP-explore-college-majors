Live plays for me brings out something that when on film just doesn't do. Great story where Madea is letting some of her family stay with her and you know Madea she puts them in their place when need to be. The songs in this play was awesome. Tyler knows just what type of songs to chose for these play's. The play's always gets me in a spiritual move.

Meet the Browns was a real disappointment to me and was bad enough for me to discourage anyone else buying this collection. This play doesn't feature the Madea character though she is alluded to in the story. I felt so embarrassed for the actors of these characters because their actions just didn't make sense in any meaningful way, The performers seem good but the music seemed to be a lot of screaming and repetitive melodies. The funeral scene in the last part of the play I really felt the play humiliated many of the characters with a sparse plot line and nonsensical and unfunny craziness. Lots of WTF moments. It ends with the standard positive messages of the rest of Perry's plays but by then I had just lost interest and hope in the play being able to redeem itself.I just watched the movie version of ""Meet the Browns"" and Perry nailed it in this version.All of David Mann's craziness along with the other characters is put in a much better perspective that is hilarious but still makes sense.",3,3 OUT OF 4 ARE GOOD,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1122,"['other', '3', 'plays', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'are', 'good', 'very', 'entertaining', 'feature', 'character', 'Madea', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'else', 'buying', 'collection', 'play', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Madea', 'character', 'alluded', 'story', 'felt', 'so', 'embarrassed', 'actors', 'characters', 'actions', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'meaningful', 'way', 'performers', 'seem', 'good', 'music', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'screaming', 'repetitive', 'melodies', 'funeral', 'scene', 'last', 'part', 'play', 'really', 'felt', 'play', 'humiliated', 'many', 'characters', 'sparse', 'plot', 'line', 'nonsensical', 'unfunny', 'craziness', 'Lots', 'WTF', 'moments', 'standard', 'positive', 'messages', 'rest', 'Perry', 'plays', 'then', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'interest', 'hope', 'play', 'being', 'able', 'redeem', 'itself.I', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'version', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'Perry', 'nailed', 'version.All', 'David', 'Mann', 'craziness', 'other', 'characters', 'put', 'much', 'better', 'perspective', 'hilarious', 'still', 'sense']",The Tyler Perry Collection: (I Can Do Bad All By Myself / Madea's Class Reunion / Meet the Browns / Madea's Family Reunion)

Creator Tyler Perry and his alter-ego, the opinionated, pistol-packing, chain-smoking (never lit, by the way) ""Madea,"" have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans, mostly African-American, nationwide.Though the stories feature the tried-and-true clich&eacute;d characters (the belligerent teenager, the devoted wife, the straying husband, the vixens, the lotharios, etc.) and situations (infidelity, promiscuity, straying from the church, comedic funerals, obnoxious and overbearing family members), Perry's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story's ending dependent upon DIVINE INTERVENTION making things right. Some of the acting performances are a little over the top, and the musical selections, though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists, are weak in the lyrics department; however, as a whole, the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational.Perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood, and is having great success on both the stage and screen.This compilation lets the viewer experience and/or revisit those money-making stage shows.",4,"Everybody has a ""Madea"" in his/her family!",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1326,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'Johnny-come-lately', 'Madea', 'series', 'finally', 'seeing', 'compilation', 'insistence', 'teenaged', 'niece', 'Creator', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'alter-ego', 'opinionated', 'pistol-packing', 'chain-smoking', 'never', 'lit', 'way', 'Madea', 'have', 'starred', 'several', 'successful', 'stage', 'plays', 'subsequent', 'theatrical', 'film', 'versions', 'delight', 'fans', 'mostly', 'African-American', 'stories', 'feature', 'tried-and-true', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'belligerent', 'teenager', 'devoted', 'wife', 'straying', 'husband', 'vixens', 'lotharios', 'etc', 'situations', 'infidelity', 'promiscuity', 'straying', 'church', 'comedic', 'funerals', 'obnoxious', 'overbearing', 'family', 'members', 'Perry', 'productions', 'also', 'introduce', 'bit', 'spirituality', 'story', 'ending', 'dependent', 'DIVINE', 'INTERVENTION', 'making', 'things', 'right', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'little', 'top', 'musical', 'selections', 'sung', 'gusto', 'relish', 'gifted', 'vocalists', 'are', 'weak', 'lyrics', 'department', 'however', 'whole', 'respective', 'productions', 'are', 'entertaining', 'inspirational.Perry', 'tapped', 'market', 'unconsciously', 'ignored', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'great', 'success', 'stage', 'screen.This', 'compilation', 'viewer', 'experience', 'and/or', 'revisit', 'money-making', 'stage', 'shows']",The Tyler Perry Collection: (I Can Do Bad All By Myself / Madea's Class Reunion / Meet the Browns / Madea's Family Reunion)
