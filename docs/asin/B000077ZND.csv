725069,A34GAJBZQW6IT7,B000077ZND,"Anne B. ""anneb""","[1, 1]","I adore Josh Groban.  He's creative, non-conformist, compelling.  This was his first and most classical concert DVD.  It's quite different from his later work.  He presents as this well-groomed, clean cut classical musician with a lot of passion.  Only later did he start presenting as a brilliant, creative slob with his own revolutionary sound.  In his early work, his voice sounds much more classical than later.  The style is softer, less booming.  The transitions between baritone and falsetto are smoother than his more recent work.  And, of course, his voice sounds sweeter and younger than the later stuff.Still, Josh's stuff even then, was of the sort I can listen to over and over without becoming bored.  The instrumentals are complex, challenging, beautiful, and harmonious.  The sounds are unpredictable, unexpected.  The Italian, to a non-Italian speaker, is an almost mystical experience, of partially understood suggestion, nameless passion, and pure music unalloyed by meaning.Definitely get this.

I had seen Josh on Church's Enchantment DVD.I saw the Josh Groban DVD in stores and resisted buying it, thinking he probably did not have enough interesting material yet.However I saw all the 5/5 ratings on this web site so I caved in and bought it.My first reaction was that most of the songs are very good but that there were some fillers.  On first reaction I would have given it 4/5.  However I have seen it three times since then and each time enjoy it more.  I am now hopelessly in love with this DVD.The DTS 5.1 on the disk is outstanding.  So is Josh's voice.At first I didn't really like the Angie Stone version of the prayer, but even that has grown on me.The only complaint I have is that &quot;English Subtitles&quot; put english subtitles for the english songs and italian subtitles for the italian songs.  I would naturally have enjoyed seeing english subtitles for the italian songs.If you have heard and like Josh's voice then you MUST buy this DVD!

725076,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B000077ZND,Furiae,"[51, 52]","I've been a Josh Groban fan ever since I saw his performance on Sarah Brightman's La Luna concert DVD.  I was ecstatic when I found out he was releasing his own CD, and was doubly excited to learn he was releasing a DVD.I rushed to buy this DVD the day it was released, and all I have to say is the other viewers aren't lying when they're saying this is good stuff.  The quality of this recording is second to none.  Everything from technical quality to artistic quality is superb.  Josh's style is very simplistic; he's a minimalist.  However, as the saying goes: &quot;The simplest melodies are the hardest to play.&quot;  Josh truly proves that.  He has just enough flair- not too much as to detract from his voice- and it's just enough pizazz to come off as classy and sublime.Josh Groban is on his way to becoming one of the greats.  He is truly the only singer who's managed to unite heavy metalheads, rap fans, sugar high pop fans, grunge fans, and classical fans under one roof.  I have not met a single person who's listened to him and not replied with something to the effect of &quot;Wow&quot; regardless of their musical preference.  Such is the power of Josh Groban.  Rick Dees even dubbed him &quot;the annointed one.&quot;His genius is his ability to channel into a deep reservoir of emotion, so even though he might be singing in a different language, listeners can understand the song through feeling... and he's only in his early 20's!  If you enjoyed his CD, just wait till you get this DVD and can watch him!Aside from Josh, the thing I was most impressed with on this DVD was the sound.  This DVD features CD quality sound, which is a delight.There's also a whole debate about Angie Stone singing with Josh on 'The Prayer.'  I'll have to admit I actually enjoyed Ms. Stone's version more than the CD version with Charlotte Church.  I felt, personally, that Ms. Stone's technique was better than Charlotte's.  No, I'm not saying Charlotte doesn't have talent- she is a powerhouse of talent- but experience counts for just as much.  Charlotte, lately, has a tendency to waver just below or just above the actual note.  She falls either flat or sharp of the note.  Ms. Stone may hail from an R&amp;B background, but she hit each note on key, and she brought a different flavor to the song, one that was very vibrant and natural.  Suffice to say, I really enjoyed the change-up.

I agree with previous reviewer that Angie Stone, although a great singer, was a major letdown for me.  Was Charlotte simply unavailable?  If so, they should have waited untill she was available.  It would have been worth the wait and would have made this the ultimate Groban concert video of a lifetime.It might seem I'm making a big deal out of Charlotte not appearing, but to fans like me who love &quot;The Prayer&quot;, my favorite pairing will always be Church/Groban.  Always.I now even wonder if Charlotte declined to appear here because she was maybe asked to sing the secondary part?  I guess we'll never know exactly why Charlotte didn't appear, but it's going to bug me every time I watch this concert.Still, Groban is at his very best here, and I think turns in a performance even better than his debut CD.  Josh has seemingly matured in very subltle ways (probably just getting better with experience), and the tone quality and maturity of his voice is stunning.The result is a lifetime performance that Josh himself may not even be able to surpass.  Josh here is relaxed, enthusiastic, connected to the audience, happy, fun, and just plain incredibly sounding good.But the highlight for me was the Bach piece, &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring&quot;.  I was blown away with the beautiful Lili Hayden (she sings while playing the violin) and Groban's powerful voice, each of them projecting reverence and joy in Bach's timeless music.  It's the ultimate expression of aspiring to God's love, in a musical journey, almost as if we've all been transported to Heaven where only joy, happiness, and love exists, in a pure ecstasy.

Witnessing the PBS taping of Josh in LA which will also be covered on this DVD, I can attest to you all that it is truly an amazing concert. Josh will be singing all of his songs from his first album in a live concert with a backup orchestra. I just want to relive that moment through this DVD. Interestingly, from what I heard(which can still change)the DVD will also contain special features like additional footage of Josh with David Foster, John Williams, and friends. The included CD is a plus which I think will contain some of Josh songs not covered by his first album. One indication is that Josh have one christmas song, ""O Holy Night"" in it. In any rate, this CD\DVD package will truly be treasured by many and are eagerly anticipating its release.

725091,AI0KXH1O95X0H,B000077ZND,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[5, 5]","Today is the 22nd of February 2007 and I asked myself where I was during the last four years of my life to have neglected the talent of Josh Groban. I have also asked myself today why it is only now that I have come across Josh's first concert DVD and how come it never crossed my mind to look for it before. I have heard Josh's voice over the radio many times during the past years with his rendition of ""You Raise Me Up"" but thought that he was only a very good singer (I still like Brian Kennedy's and Tracey Campbell-Nation's duet-rendition of this song better than Josh's.) Seeing this DVD on this Chinese New Year of 2007 proved that he was more than that!!! He is not only a very good singer, but a really great and towering one. This concert is nearly flawless. The stage production is elegant and richly done with light and shadow effects: ultimately beautiful to behold at.What makes it all work though is Josh's great voice and the earnestness he puts with each song he sings. Here's a different definition of ""soul"" for you folks out there. The pieces ""Broken Vow,"" ""To Where You Are"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"" are sure to impress and touch you. The only part of the concert I find a bit weak is the duet with Andrea Corr. I find Miss Corr's voice comparatively weak against Josh Groban's. And, her voice was done electronically!! For me, this is a bit of a setback.But for sure, you will soon forget this tiny flaw when you hear the next offering, a duet with Angie Stone for ""The Prayer."" It is my firm belief that this is actually the highlight of the whole concert. Personally, I can't understand why some of the reviewers here have criticized Miss Stone's performance as mismatched against Josh's. In my opinion, it is perfect and mature. The two performers' voices blend perfectly, and there isn't even a hint of one overpowering the other. I especially like Miss Stone's style of half-saying and half-singing the lyrics. It holds up very, very well to Josh's own singing style.One of the merits of this DVD is that you can turn on the Subtitle feature and there you have the song lyrics. However, they did forget to include the titles to each song. How come this negligence? Also, it would have been great if the Italian and Spanish songs were provided a separate English subtitle so that we know their meanings. Knowing the meaning of foreign songs greatly improves on the experience of listening to them.Overall, this is a first-rate production. Most of the songs are inspirational so therefore, it is safe to say that the DVD is collectible. The beauty of this concert production does justice to the great talent that is Josh Groban. This DVD is a definite keeper.Feb. 23, 2007: The next DVD concert I got to see was Andrea Bocelli's ""Under the Desert Sky."" In it, there was also a duet for ""The Prayer"" performed by Andrea Bocelli and Heather Headley. After seeing their performance, I finally realized why I liked the Groban-Stone version so much. In my opinion, it doesn't do to sing this song too perfectly. What it needs is SOUL, and a sense of world-weariness. After all, it is a prayer. Angie Stone's voice seems to convey both these qualities when she sang ""The Prayer"" with Josh Groban.",5,Go Go Groban!!!!,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3213,"['Today', '22nd', 'February', '2007', 'asked', 'where', 'was', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'life', 'have', 'neglected', 'talent', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'have', 'also', 'asked', 'today', 'why', 'only', 'now', 'have', 'come', 'Josh', 'first', 'concert', 'DVD', 'how', 'come', 'never', 'crossed', 'mind', 'look', 'have', 'heard', 'Josh', 'voice', 'radio', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'years', 'rendition', 'Raise', 'Me', 'Up', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'still', 'Brian', 'Kennedy', 'Tracey', 'Campbell-Nation', 'duet-rendition', 'song', 'better', 'Josh', 'Seeing', 'DVD', 'Chinese', 'New', 'Year', '2007', 'proved', 'was', 'more', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'really', 'great', 'towering', 'one', 'concert', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'stage', 'production', 'elegant', 'richly', 'done', 'light', 'shadow', 'effects', 'ultimately', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'at.What', 'work', 'Josh', 'great', 'voice', 'earnestness', 'song', 'Here', 'different', 'definition', 'soul', 'folks', 'there', 'pieces', 'Broken', 'Vow', 'Where', 'Are', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'are', 'sure', 'impress', 'touch', 'only', 'part', 'concert', 'find', 'bit', 'weak', 'duet', 'Andrea', 'Corr', 'find', 'Miss', 'Corr', 'voice', 'comparatively', 'weak', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'voice', 'was', 'done', 'electronically', 'bit', 'setback.But', 'sure', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', 'tiny', 'flaw', 'when', 'hear', 'next', 'offering', 'duet', 'Angie', 'Stone', 'Prayer', 'firm', 'belief', 'actually', 'highlight', 'whole', 'concert', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'criticized', 'Miss', 'Stone', 'performance', 'mismatched', 'Josh', 'opinion', 'perfect', 'mature', 'two', 'performers', 'voices', 'blend', 'perfectly', ""n't"", 'even', 'hint', 'one', 'overpowering', 'other', 'especially', 'Miss', 'Stone', 'style', 'half-saying', 'half-singing', 'lyrics', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'Josh', 'own', 'singing', 'style.One', 'merits', 'DVD', 'can', 'turn', 'Subtitle', 'feature', 'have', 'song', 'lyrics', 'However', 'did', 'forget', 'include', 'titles', 'song', 'How', 'come', 'negligence', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Italian', 'Spanish', 'songs', 'were', 'provided', 'separate', 'English', 'subtitle', 'so', 'know', 'meanings', 'Knowing', 'meaning', 'foreign', 'songs', 'greatly', 'experience', 'listening', 'them.Overall', 'first-rate', 'production', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'inspirational', 'therefore', 'safe', 'say', 'DVD', 'collectible', 'beauty', 'concert', 'production', 'justice', 'great', 'talent', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'DVD', 'definite', 'keeper.Feb', '23', '2007', 'next', 'DVD', 'concert', 'got', 'see', 'was', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'Desert', 'Sky', 'was', 'also', 'duet', 'Prayer', 'performed', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'Heather', 'Headley', 'seeing', 'performance', 'finally', 'realized', 'why', 'liked', 'Groban-Stone', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'do', 'sing', 'song', 'too', 'perfectly', 'What', 'SOUL', 'sense', 'world-weariness', 'prayer', 'Angie', 'Stone', 'voice', 'convey', 'qualities', 'when', 'sang', 'Prayer', 'Josh', 'Groban']",N/A
