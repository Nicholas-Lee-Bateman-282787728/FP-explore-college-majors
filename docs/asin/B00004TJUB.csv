550862,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00004TJUB,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I am been involved lately, on a blog site that I belong to, in a friendly but spirited ""debate"" over whether Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis was the real ""king of the hill"" in the early days of rock & roll. I have argued that, pound for pound, Jerry Lee had more energy, more musical skill, more ..., well, you get the picture, than Elvis could ever dream of. And with some exceptions, noted below, this movie, ""Jailhouse Rock"" based on the successful recording of one of his most famous early songs only buttresses that argument. Any Elvis aficionado would have to agree that this film is probably Elvis' best cinematic effort (most of the others being merely vehicles for promoting his latest songs of the time). Overall, however, after fifty years it does not stand the test of time.The premise of the film is not a bad one, paralleling in some senses the real life Elvis' story of a backwoods kid who has two strikes against him trying for the brass ring- and winning. Elvis (Vince), as an ex-con is up against it in trying to crash into the record business. After falling flat on his face trying to get the established record companies to give him a shot he goes on to set up his own record company (not as hard to do in those days as one would think and certainly much easier than trying to do that today, Internet or not). After some frustrations and a few fights, verbal and otherwise, he catches the elusive break. Talent, will out.  Oh, did I mention that he has a partner (two, really, but I want to discuss only one)? A young, vibrant and upscale woman who sees potential in a bad boy from across the tracks. She has faith in him. A classic 1950's teen movie cinematic trope. T he class struggle here, oops, the love struggle, forms the backdrop to the action of the film. Naturally after the now cocky Vince gets his comeuppance the couple live happily ever after making platters and making the hearts of teenage girls in the 1950's spin.Now one and all will agree that the movie script deserves no Academy Award nomination. Moreover, these kinds of movies were made to cash in on Elvis' sex appeal and to promote his songs. However, except for the classic ""Jailhouse Rock"" scene where we get high swiveling Elvis at his best the rest of the songs are sleepers. His acting, as the alienated youth trying to find his own way in a hard world that he didn't make, rings false. The alienated youth image was done better, a million times better, by James Dean who made an art form out of that alienation. On Elvis it seems contrived. In any case, I will give Elvis his big moment in that ""Jailhouse Rock"" scene. But if you have one scene to think about musically from the 1950's doesn't Jerry Lee Lewis playing like a crazy man on ""High School Confidential"" on the back of a flat top truck on the way to the local high school really represent a better iconic image of what early rock & and roll was about in the late 1950's.

550863,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004TJUB,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","My whole life I've been told I look like Elvis Presley.  As a kid I became obsessed with his music as a way to validate the comparison.  That really has no relevance to this review whatsoever, but it was something I felt like sharing.  Even today, I get the Elvis thing a lot.  I think it's because of the comparison or whatever, but I've always had a special place in my heart for all things Elvis, even though I never really took the time to dig into his life or career, past his music.  TCM has been playing a lot of his films lately, and so I decided to dip my toe in, and what better place to start than with `Jailhouse Rock'.The film itself, heavily lauded as his finest cinematic achievement, isn't very good.  Its plot is simplistic and clich&eacute; ridden and Elvis's lead performance feels a little stilted.  The basic premise is that a young hothead named Vince gets in an argument with a `woman beater' in a bar and winds up beating the man to death.  For that, he serves fourteen months in prison.  While in prison, he learns to play guitar from his cellmate, Hunk.  Upon his release, Vince tries to capitalize on his newfound gift and with some ambition he becomes a star, but he also starts to forsake those who helped him along the way because of his arrogance.  The film's climax feels really forced and somewhat laughable, yet oddly appropriate.That is the thing with `Jailhouse Rock'; it is truly entertaining and fun to watch, despite the fact that it really isn't that good of a film.  I was really disappointed in the actual musical numbers because Elvis's lip-syncing was so off that it was obvious he wasn't doing any of the singing live (which is the norm for films like this, but it should have looked natural) and he also lacked the presence I remember him having in my youth.  It felt like Elvis, playing Elvis while trying to channel James Dean.  There were moments in the film's beginning where I felt like his performance may turn out to be something special, but he ultimately fell flat for me.The film's true highlight was Mickey Shaughnessy, who played Hunk with a true sense of depth.I love the song Jailhouse Rock, and I'll admit that that particular segment (lip-syncing aside) was fun and made the movie, and the sets and costumes were stellar and eye catching, but overall I was expecting something more, something better, and so I was letdown sadly.",3,It doesn't quite rock...,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2390,"['whole', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'look', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'kid', 'became', 'obsessed', 'music', 'way', 'validate', 'comparison', 'really', 'relevance', 'review', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'something', 'felt', 'sharing', 'Even', 'today', 'get', 'Elvis', 'thing', 'lot', 'think', 'comparison', 'whatever', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'things', 'Elvis', 'even', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'dig', 'life', 'career', 'music', 'TCM', 'been', 'playing', 'lot', 'films', 'lately', 'so', 'decided', 'dip', 'toe', 'what', 'better', 'place', 'start', 'Jailhouse', ""Rock'.The"", 'film', 'heavily', 'lauded', 'finest', 'cinematic', 'achievement', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'simplistic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'Elvis', 'lead', 'performance', 'feels', 'little', 'stilted', 'basic', 'premise', 'young', 'hothead', 'named', 'Vince', 'argument', 'woman', 'beater', 'bar', 'up', 'beating', 'man', 'death', 'fourteen', 'months', 'prison', 'prison', 'play', 'guitar', 'cellmate', 'Hunk', 'release', 'Vince', 'capitalize', 'newfound', 'gift', 'ambition', 'star', 'also', 'forsake', 'who', 'helped', 'way', 'arrogance', 'film', 'climax', 'feels', 'really', 'forced', 'somewhat', 'laughable', 'yet', 'oddly', 'appropriate.That', 'thing', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'fact', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'actual', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Elvis', 'lip-syncing', 'was', 'so', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'singing', 'live', 'norm', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'natural', 'also', 'lacked', 'presence', 'remember', 'having', 'youth', 'felt', 'Elvis', 'playing', 'Elvis', 'trying', 'channel', 'James', 'Dean', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'beginning', 'where', 'felt', 'performance', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'ultimately', 'fell', 'flat', 'me.The', 'film', 'true', 'highlight', 'was', 'Mickey', 'Shaughnessy', 'who', 'played', 'Hunk', 'true', 'sense', 'depth.I', 'song', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'particular', 'segment', 'lip-syncing', 'aside', 'was', 'fun', 'made', 'movie', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'stellar', 'eye', 'catching', 'overall', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'something', 'better', 'so', 'was', 'letdown', 'sadly']",N/A
550864,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00004TJUB,Austin Somlo,"[3, 3]","Viewed: 6/12Rate: 96/12: Most critics panned the film Jailhouse Rock when it first came out, and they found Elvis Presley's acting ""stilted."" I strongly disagree. There are two memorable scenes for me from Jailhouse Rock. One, obviously, is the music video that is very famous for two reasons. It's the first music video of its kind, and the whole video is well choreographed, actually by Elvis himself. Yet it was just a rehearsal. That is what made the whole thing amazing. The scene has been reported to be the first scene shot during the filming schedule, so they started with the best and worked their way down. The black-and-white on Elvis is simply beautiful. Two, while not as universally acknowledged, I found the kissing scene along with that iconic quote ""That ain't tactics, honey. It's just the beast in me."" between Judy Tyler and Elvis Presley to be one of the best scenes I've seen, considering the fact that I've seen thousands of films. But this is as perfect as it gets. Elvis played that one perfectly. I replayed that one several times, and it was just flawless. In the entire time watching Jailhouse Rock, I've felt that Elvis was trying to imitate Marlon Brando and (more of) James Dean, and my suspicion was confirmed by that fact that he studied their styles. This one was a good move because that particular style suited him well. If he was taken seriously as an actor especially in dramas, I think he would have been as good. The old question back then was: ""Can he sing?"" We knew the answer. Now, it is, ""Can he act?"" I emphatically say yes. This was a very good piece of acting, considering that he had no formal training of any kind. Back to Jailhouse Rock, it was quite all over the map, lacking a real direction. Some were peeved by Vince's arrogance, and others hate it for the sake of hate. I thought he played his part in an amusing, adorable way. Sadly, Judy Tyler died in an automobile accident after the movie production was wrapped up, and it's been reported that Elvis had never seen the film (it is possible he may have) in his lifetime. Had Elvis saw it once, he would have been impressed with himself. One more thing, great writing...exceptionally well done...fantastic lines. All in all, Jailhouse Rock is a great and historical film. All I can say is: it's just too bad for people not to realize how gifted of an actor Elvis Presley could have been.",5,Elvis' Unrealized Acting Talent.,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,2394,"['Viewed', '6/12Rate', '96/12', 'Most', 'critics', 'panned', 'film', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'acting', 'stilted', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'are', 'two', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'One', 'obviously', 'music', 'video', 'very', 'famous', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'music', 'video', 'kind', 'whole', 'video', 'well', 'choreographed', 'actually', 'Elvis', 'was', 'just', 'rehearsal', 'what', 'made', 'whole', 'thing', 'amazing', 'scene', 'been', 'reported', 'be', 'first', 'scene', 'shot', 'filming', 'schedule', 'started', 'best', 'worked', 'way', 'down', 'black-and-white', 'Elvis', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'Two', 'not', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'found', 'kissing', 'scene', 'iconic', 'quote', 'ai', ""n't"", 'tactics', 'honey', 'just', 'beast', 'Judy', 'Tyler', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'considering', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousands', 'films', 'as', 'perfect', 'Elvis', 'played', 'one', 'perfectly', 'replayed', 'one', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'flawless', 'entire', 'time', 'watching', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'Elvis', 'was', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'more', 'James', 'Dean', 'suspicion', 'was', 'confirmed', 'fact', 'studied', 'styles', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'particular', 'style', 'suited', 'well', 'was', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actor', 'especially', 'dramas', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'question', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'Can', 'sing', 'knew', 'answer', 'Now', 'Can', 'act', 'emphatically', 'say', 'yes', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'piece', 'acting', 'considering', 'had', 'formal', 'training', 'kind', 'Back', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'was', 'quite', 'map', 'lacking', 'real', 'direction', 'were', 'peeved', 'Vince', 'arrogance', 'others', 'hate', 'sake', 'hate', 'thought', 'played', 'part', 'amusing', 'adorable', 'way', 'Sadly', 'Judy', 'Tyler', 'died', 'automobile', 'accident', 'movie', 'production', 'was', 'wrapped', 'up', 'been', 'reported', 'Elvis', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'possible', 'may', 'have', 'lifetime', 'Had', 'Elvis', 'saw', 'once', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'great', 'writing', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'fantastic', 'lines', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'great', 'historical', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'people', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

As most fans know, the later movies became very formulaic, and are sometimes embarrassing to watch Elvis being forced to degrade himself in such a way because Colonel Parker had roped him into a terrible contract.

550886,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B00004TJUB,jude pepper,"[2, 9]","when it comes to rock (maybe even music in general), the quintessence of overrated is one Elvis Presley. the man's claim to the title ""King Of Rock & Roll"" is dubious at best for two reasons...the first is that he was reasonably talented but HARDLY a genius. he only tried to write songs, to CREATE rather than simply RELAY music, once or twice. usually, he didn't even bother to participate in the selecting the next single release. and of course he was anything BUT an innovator. his act was modeled as exactly as possible on those of a thousand black artists who weren't about to get anything close to the same level of exposure, what with being black. indeed, Elvis' '50s heyday was marked by a uniquely shameless musical racism: numerous songs, including such anthems as ""Sh-Boom"" and ""Shake Rattle & Roll,"" were marginal semi-hits for the black artists who created them, then major nationwide smashes for the white artists who liberally appropriated them. and that's what Elvis' career was built on, really: the experiment had reached the point where a commodity could be made not of merely a song, but of a singer.(i grant you none of this was common knowledge at the time, but what about today, decades after the cat escaped the bag? you'd think that if there's one thing that should spell certain doom for Elvis worship - not necessarily Elvis fondness or appreciation, but certainly Elvis WORSHIP - it's the effective death of the misapprehention that he was an original. so why didn't it? God alone knows, and He's not talkin'.)the other strike against him is a simple question of timing. Muddy Waters sangs that the blues got pregenant, and they called the baby Rock & Roll. well, the '50s was the gestation period, and certain elements would need more time to crystalize. this scrappy little lovechild of blues and country will find it's own identity and establish it's own purpose - come of age, if you will - in the '60s. to declare King Of Rock & Roll someone who preceeds The Beatles and The Stones is like declaring King Of Literature some Neanderthal scribbling on his cave wall. or King Of Medicine whoever came up with releasing ""demons"" by drilling holes in the skull.but for all that, music was indeed Elvis' niche. (i repeat, i take exception not to his existing or having a career, but his being misrepresented as a pinnacle. you have to do more than simply sing whatever random song you get handed to qualify there.) his music may be unexceptional, but it wasn't terrible, and he was talented enough to get some fun out of it.the notorious train wreck that is his movie career is another matter entirely. your serious movie critics tend to have about as much affection for Elvis as they have toward Charles Manson, and even the most fanatic Elvis zealots have been known to grudgingly admit that there's a reason for that. even Elvis himself is said to of had only so much tolerance for the sort of assembly-line fluff-pieces he tended to end up in.this is what makes JAILHOUSE ROCK a semi-landmark. (it may be no CITIZEN KANE, but since the Elvis machine never set the bar that high, that's a moot point.) Elvis was one of those ""actors"" who was best suited to basically playing himself, and this film enables him to do so without drowning him in the usual Vegas-style schmaltz. not that there aren't still a few loose ends. in the beginning, for instance, when he goes to court for murder, he could plead self-defense. the only reason he doesn't is because there's no further story if he does. but all in all this tale of an angry young man's attempts to break into the business suits Elvis and his meager acting chops, to say nothing of the fact that the title track is his single best song.the fact still stand, though, that Elvis was the King Of Rock & Roll like Charles Manson was the King Of Law & Order. incredibly, some have actually asked, in complete earnestness, what would've become of Rock & Roll without Elvis. given that Elvis was a cypher and a puppet, the answer is, precisely what did become of Rock & roll. it's a fact: in a world without an Elvis, Colonel Parker would've just found some other stooge.rock & roll without THE BEATLES, now THAT would've been a catastrophe of Vesuvius proportions!!",3,A Brief Moment Of Cinematic Quasi-Glory...,1346544000,"09 2,

After his release, Vince stumbles onto a hot, new singing style. With the help of record promoter Peggy Van Alden, played by child actress Judy Tyler, he takes the entertainment industry by storm. Later, Hunk joins Vince's entourage, which becomes larger as the ambitious young singer fights his way to the top. Unfortunately, Vince leaves Peggy behind, despite her love for him. Attempting to teach the arrogant young Vince a lesson, Hunk punches Vince in the throat, injuring his vocal cords. A repentant Vince then realizes his love for Peggy, and his voice is miraculously restored.Jailhouse rock showcases Elvis Presley the rebel. Elvis's character - Vince Everett - is self-centered, overly aggressive toward women, and somewhat greedy. Though he exhibits a change of heart toward the end of the movie, it is his unruly behavior and defiant attitude that many remember from the film. This is Elvis at his finest showing off his ability to be as tough as James Dean or Marlon Brando.Far from being greedy or selfish, in real life Elvis was known throughout his life for his generosity toward friends, acquaintances, and even complete strangers. After principle photography for Jailhouse Rock had been completed, Elvis presented all 250 crew members large envelopes inscribed with, ""Thanks to the entire cast and crew"". Inside each envelope was a personally autographed photo of Elvis, plus a small gift.Elvis was devastated shortly after the production of Jailhouse Rock had wrapped when news was given that costar Judy Tyler and her new husband Gregory Lafayette were killed in a gruesome car crash near Billy The Kid, Wyoming. It was disclosed to a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal that ""Elvis broke down and cried"".Produced for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Pandro S. Berman. Released October 17, 1957.

The black and white photographed story of a young fellow who beats a man to death(just to waaatch him die!), goes into the jug where he learns a trade and comes out to become a major rock and roll and movie star. He also is a major jerk who has to learn a lesson about humility or some such.The movie is okay. Another of those dreary late 50s movies where everyone and everything is miserable. The songs are organic to the story....in recording studios and in concert so the film is not really a musical in the MGM/RKO sense and so lacks the exhileration that I expect from the genre. The acting is pretty good. Everyone is miserable and unpleasant and the viewer feels miserable and unpleasant throughout. VIVA LAS VEGAS is far more fun.However the film had one happy surprise. While The King and Shaughnessy are sitting in the prison dining room eating slop, a burly tough looking convict suddenly stands up, shouts ""I ain't gonna eat this slop no more!"" and starts a riot.And who should it be but Glenn Strange!!!I was quite delighted and rather saddened that the film continued on with The King instead of staying with Strange's determined quest not to eat slop no more.Alas.",2,I ain't gonna eat slop no more!!!!,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1501,"['So', 'eternal', 'effort', 'see', 'variety', 'different', 'types', 'films', 'decided', 'knuckle', 'down', 'watch', 'second', 'movie', 'starring', 'King', '.ah', 'would', 'be', 'Elvis', 'Presely', 'JAILHOUSE', 'ROCK', '1957', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Thorpe', 'starring', 'along', 'King', 'hottie', 'named', 'Judy', 'Tyler', 'Mickey', 'Shaughnessy', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'black', 'white', 'photographed', 'story', 'young', 'fellow', 'who', 'man', 'death', 'just', 'waaatch', 'die', 'jug', 'where', 'trade', 'out', 'become', 'major', 'rock', 'roll', 'movie', 'star', 'also', 'major', 'jerk', 'who', 'learn', 'lesson', 'humility', 'such.The', 'movie', 'okay', 'dreary', 'late', '50s', 'movies', 'where', 'everyone', 'everything', 'miserable', 'songs', 'are', 'organic', 'story', 'recording', 'studios', 'concert', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'musical', 'MGM/RKO', 'sense', 'so', 'exhileration', 'expect', 'genre', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'Everyone', 'miserable', 'unpleasant', 'viewer', 'feels', 'miserable', 'unpleasant', 'VIVA', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'far', 'more', 'fun.However', 'film', 'had', 'one', 'happy', 'surprise', 'King', 'Shaughnessy', 'are', 'sitting', 'prison', 'dining', 'room', 'eating', 'slop', 'burly', 'tough', 'looking', 'convict', 'suddenly', 'up', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'eat', 'slop', 'more', 'riot.And', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'Glenn', 'Strange', 'was', 'quite', 'delighted', 'rather', 'saddened', 'film', 'continued', 'King', 'instead', 'staying', 'Strange', 'determined', 'quest', 'not', 'eat', 'slop', 'more.Alas']",N/A
