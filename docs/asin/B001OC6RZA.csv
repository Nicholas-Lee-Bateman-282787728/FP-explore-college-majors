1222370,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001OC6RZA,Amazon Customer,"[19, 24]","Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death / B001OC6RZAMy family and I are long-time lovers of ""Wallace and Gromit"", but we just hated ""Loaf and Death"". Someone on the production team apparently felt that W&G; needed a 'dark and edgy' upgrade to appeal to a wider demographic, so ""Loaf and Death"" was created with all the basic plot points of ""Close Shave"", but with the violence and insanity ramped up to 11, and with all the charm sucked out with nary a backward glance.""Close Shave"" was fun and amusing because, despite the potentially dark subject matter of sheep being stolen in a nefarious plot to grind them into dog meat, (a) nobody ever got seriously hurt (including the villain, due to a timely Made of Steel revelation), and (b) the plot was so over-the-top amusing, with hilarious moments that burned indelibly into the memory: most memorably the ""organized"" motorcycle riding sheep.""Loaf or Death"" has none of those amusing moments, despite a few throw-away jokes. The story is immediately darker than ""Close Shave"", as human bakers in the area have been murdered in a recent crime spree. The lady of the hour, Wallace's new love, is of course the culprit - and the movie makes no bones about the fact that she is incredibly insane (filling her bedroom with wooden clothes models, wearing the baker hats of her dead lovers) and that she is abusing her French poodle. Yes, you read that right - the ""Shaun the Sheep"" of this movie is a pretty girl poodle who is openly abused by her mistress - even being hit so hard with a shovel that she leaves a cartoon 'outline' in the shovel. Ha, ha, ha, I'm not laughing. In yet another ""funny"" moment, Wallace's insane fiance bites her own arm in order to incriminate Gromit - the scene is way more disturbing than it sounds.Although ""Loaf and Death"" retains the iconic W&G; look, the feel is that of a series that has been handed over to a brand new team of writers and developers. Even W&G; have been flanderized - Wallace's signature neglect and misunderstanding of Gromit has blossomed into outright abuse of his position as 'master', such as when Wallace decides not to go out in the rain on an errand and 'cunningly' sends Gromit instead. This sort of character change really undermines the entire relationship between the two main characters - as Wallace becomes less of an innocent dupe in need of defending and just another human-who-won't-see-Gromit-as-an-equal, and therefore deserving of their fate.I would not recommend this new featurette.

And like anything, e.g., a music group, there are great albums and there are good albums (and there are bad ones, too).  ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" is a good show...not a great show, not a bad show, but a good show.Regardless of where you are coming from you have got to love all of Wallace's unecessary gadgetry and Gromit's eye rolling patience with his dim master, er, pet, er, who own's whom here anyway!?I have to admit that the set-up for the story line starts with a jolt rather than a bang.  Wallace and Gromit are bakers!?  Where did that come from?  Of course Wallace and Gromit pull the bakery business off all right, but did I miss something or did Wallace's fascination with the TV ad bread girl appear from nowhere?That aside, I really liked the former bread model and her particular motivation for action.  You really fear for Wallace as you would an old friend.  In fact I liked nearly everything about the show, though I thought that the poodle was designed with much less class as she deserved (and that Gromit deserved too :-D).All in all this is a 4-star offering for me and other seasoned Wallace and Gromit fans, but my guess is that if this show were a person's first experience with this duo that they'd have a tougher time ""getting it"" and would tend toward a 3 star experience.  But if you already know Wallace and Gromit you will enjoy the show quite a bit.I do have to say though that I thought some of the animation was a half a step to a full step below what I've come to expect from this production crew.L'amour!  4 stars for Wallace and Gromit fans.",4,"Spotted it, bought it, watched it, liked it!

This installment was conceived, planned, blocked and filmed for the widescreen 1.78:1 (16:9) format and it has been butchered into a 4:3 presentation by its cheap American distributor (Lionsgate), making this the official ""Dumb American"" version. The action and the characters are incomprehensible in this format. Too many things go on at once in too many complicated set pieces for the viewer to follow or even have a dim understanding of what he is supposed to be watching. The viewer is essentially missing half the action and a 100 % of the artistic intent. Worst of all, the crucial painstakingly-rendered facial interactions of the main characters with each other are simply missing, destroyed or nullified from not being shown in the same frame. The same massacre was perpetrated on every installment of ""Shaun the Sheep"" available on DVD for its weight in gold, on this side of the Atlantic, from the same unscrupulous distributor (complete with PAL-to-NTSC ghosting). The only way you can see the complete episode in North America, as well as ""The Wrong Trousers"" in its original 1.66:1 ratio and ""A Close Shave"" in its original 1.77:1 ratio - is to buy the whole collection on Blu-Ray. I don't own a Blu-Ray player but this may be the deciding factor for me to acquire one. This DVD also only comes in 2.0 Dolby whereas the film was intended for 5.1 Dolby. Need I say more?To add insult to injury, the 20-min enhanced-for-widescreen ""Making Of"" documentary shows extended scenes of the wonderful 16:9 presentation of what the buyer has been missing.For the wholesale and pointless desacration of several British animation masterpieces, heartless money-grubbing corporation Lionsgate should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity and our planet's artistic heritage.UPDATE Oct. 8, 2009: This product is still being sold by Amazon.com after going out of stock, probably because of huge demand.

Where to begin?  First, the film comes across as very crammed & rushed in terms of it's overall pace to painfully squeeze into it's 30 minute running time and it really shows.  Second, there is a scene of animal cruelty where the villian hits her little dog and you hear a very cringingly real yelp of pain that I felt to be very innappropriate for a film that's supposed to be open for children to watch.  Third, it's just lacking in the subtle english humor of the previous films which made me love the W&G; movies in the first place.Lastly the movie was made to be seen in anamorphic widescreen, but Lion's Gate has decided to deny American audiences of over 33% of the full picture and are only releasing the film in ""pan-&-scan"" full-screen, which is a real shame as the makers of W&G; have made the best film yet in terms of technical expertise of their work with plasticine.Good things about the film are two-fold, one is that physical motion and facial expressions of all characters have hit a new high by Aardman, and the other is of course simply to see Wallace & Gromit interacting together as they always do.

The film's visual inventiveness had me chuckling throughout and belly-laughing much of the time.I have to admit that, even more than usual, I wanted to brain Wallace for being so blind to the intelligence and loyalty of Gromit, who is smarter than Wallace by at least a multiple of ten. And I also must concede that the plot developments in ""A Matter or Loaf or Death"" are considerably more dire than in any previous W&G; outing, so that it can't be recommended for children under the age of seven or eight.

I'm not sure if this has to do with the animation process being perfected or the infusion of Ardman resources from three successful DreamWorks collaborations, but it's great that gang has been able to follow up a solid effort with another solid effort so quickly.Returning to its typical 30-minute runtime, A Matter of Loaf and Death places Wallace and Gromit into but another new business venture.From window washers, to rabbit control, this time 62 West Wallaby Street converted into bakery-mode complete with ovens, robotic kneading arms, and contraptions that can only be described as ""Wallace-esque"".  Calling their new venture ""Top Bun,"" profits are raising right along with the bread dough up until the moment Wallace falls head over buns in love with a seductive bread-industry icon, Piella Bakewell.Oblivious-er than usual, Wallace is high on life with the course of events but Gromit finds himself concerned by the news that 12 local bakers disappeared mysteriously and all of them seemed to have had connections with one miss Piella Bakewell.The humor, once more, is spectacular.  If the low key comedic bits don't capture your attention the first time through, the scene that spoofs the famous pottery wheel/ Righteous Brothers bit from the movie Ghost certainly will!  I was also quite enamored with the segment that spoofs the pay-loader suit made famous in James Cameron's ALIENS.I'm surprised to observe around the web the general consensus that this one happens far too quickly (or is too short as the complaints seem to balk).  Interestingly, save for the Where-Rabbit, all of Wallace and Gromit's films have been 30-minutes or under.  How quickly we get spoiled!To counter such complaints, truly this team does their absolute best work when the proverbial clock is ticking.  The pacing here and the near-frantic exposition harkens back to the early-shorts, particularly reminiscent of the structure of A Close Shave.I must confess to having inadvertently viewing this one out of order but as a result of the error, can state with absolute certainty that despite the general consensus, this one looks and feels a lot more like the original W&G; shorts than it does the slightly out of place Where-Rabbit full length feature.In all, some argue that A Matter of Loaf and Death is too short in runtime or not as clever as the earlier entries of the franchise but I completely disagree with these sentiments.  Having been afforded the luxury of viewing the entire Wallace and Gromit collection within the course of a week, I can state with absolute conviction that this one more closely resembles the original features than it does the more Hollywood-finessed Where-Rabbit that preceded it.

1222399,A14PKCQB69QYYM,B001OC6RZA,R. A. Bishop III,"[1, 3]","OK.  First to the people who complain about the full-frame aspect ratio:  Yes is it full frame (filmed in 16:9), but you know that by reading the packaging before you buy.  And the run time of 87 minutes on the package is misleading.  But these are not problems with the film.  Which, while seeming a bit more violent that previous W&G, more than holds its own against A Grand Day Out,  A Close Shave, and Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and only trails the masterpiece, The Wrong Trousers.  Everything you have come to love in a W&G is there:  Rube Goldberg machinery galore.  Witty word play for the grown-ups, pop culture references, and a dark side.  This time the boys nemesis is a serial killer instead of a sheepnapper (and would be murderer), hair triggered diamond thief, or demented hunter, so we are headed to a slightly darker place. For adults that is, but not for the little ones.  The darker aspects are implied, with the exception of an owner striking her dog, and my son found the blow less troubling than Gromit being kicked out of his room and abandoned in The Wrong Trousers.  There are some great gags, like Wallace using stale muffins as brake pads,  Gromit making an airport-ready metal detector, and Ghost and Aliens references, to name a few.  It just feels more like a W&G film that Were-Rabbit does to me:  No down time in the story, only two speaking parts, no cgi (at least not obvious to me),  and more Gromit!",4,Great addition to the W & G family of film!,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,1434,"['OK.', 'First', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'full-frame', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Yes', 'full', 'frame', 'filmed', '16:9', 'know', 'reading', 'packaging', 'buy', 'run', 'time', '87', 'minutes', 'package', 'misleading', 'are', 'not', 'problems', 'film', 'Which', 'seeming', 'bit', 'more', 'violent', 'previous', 'W', 'G', 'more', 'own', 'Grand', 'Day', 'Out', 'A', 'Close', 'Shave', 'Curse', 'Were-Rabbit', 'only', 'masterpiece', 'Wrong', 'Trousers', 'Everything', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'W', 'G', 'there', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'machinery', 'galore', 'Witty', 'word', 'play', 'grown-ups', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'dark', 'side', 'time', 'boys', 'nemesis', 'serial', 'killer', 'instead', 'sheepnapper', 'would', 'be', 'murderer', 'hair', 'triggered', 'diamond', 'thief', 'demented', 'hunter', 'are', 'headed', 'slightly', 'darker', 'place', 'adults', 'not', 'little', 'ones', 'darker', 'aspects', 'are', 'implied', 'exception', 'owner', 'striking', 'dog', 'son', 'found', 'blow', 'less', 'troubling', 'Gromit', 'being', 'kicked', 'room', 'abandoned', 'Wrong', 'Trousers', 'are', 'great', 'gags', 'Wallace', 'using', 'stale', 'muffins', 'brake', 'pads', 'Gromit', 'making', 'airport-ready', 'metal', 'detector', 'Ghost', 'Aliens', 'references', 'name', 'few', 'just', 'more', 'W', 'G', 'film', 'Were-Rabbit', 'down', 'time', 'story', 'only', 'two', 'speaking', 'parts', 'cgi', 'least', 'not', 'obvious', 'more', 'Gromit']",Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf or Death

A Matter of Loaf or Death keeps the good streak intact, and is fine entertainment, albeit perhaps not as quite as good as A Close Shave or The Curse of the Wererabbit, in my opinion.  But I've been anxiously awaiting release of A Matter of Loaf or Death here in the States, and it finally arrived today.Although the package states that the running time is 87 minutes, the actual feature is only about 30 minutes.  Also included is a ""making of"" segment, and a ""Shaun the Sheep"" episode, so counting all three of these probably is how the 87 minutes were derived.So, I popped the DVD into the player, gathered the wife and kiddies around (the kids are only two and four years old, but they love Wallace and Gromit), and we watched the feature.  It was funny, and the animation was great, as usual.  However, it was more violent than previous entries, and I felt a bit uncomfortable at some of the scenes as my two and four year old watched them, particularly with regards to how Gromit and another dog are mistreated.  The kids didn't have any problems or get scared, but you may want to watch the feature first before showing it to your young children.  Its mostly cartoonish violence, but the other dog's owner, Miss Piella Bakewell, is a bit mean.But I'm pleased with my purchase, and strongly recommend A Matter of Loaf and Death.
