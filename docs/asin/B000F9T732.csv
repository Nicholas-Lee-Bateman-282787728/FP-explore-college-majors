It is the only series that I allow my 16 month old watch and he loves it. Each episode begins with Grandpa Winks telling his grandchildren a story of growing up with his friends in Ireland and then the episode shows Grandpa's adventures as a youngster, ""Piggley Winks"". Each story has a lesson and the series shows the importance of family and friends. Also, you know it's got to be good if Mel Brooks is involved (he supplies the voice of Wiley the sheep).",5,Jakers!
