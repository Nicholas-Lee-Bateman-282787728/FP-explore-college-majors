1696723,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00JKPHUE0,Adam,"[30, 49]","In the sequel to Amazing Spider-man, Peter Parker struggles with keeping his promises to Captain Stacy to keep Gwen out of the dangers entailed in being Spider-man as he continues to be in love with her. At the same time, Spider-man faces new threats with the creation of Electro, and then Harry Osborn ascends to Oscorp believing that only the blood of Spider-man can cure him of the degenerative disease he inherited from his father.Plus side:The biggest plus of this movie that makes it work is Andrew Garfield. Garfield portrays the best and most likable Spider-man ever. He's still human, flawed, and struggling, but he's not near as whiny as previous versions.Spider-man has grown from the brooding teenager to a compassionate and caring hero. The scenes with kids are priceless. Spidey can take on threats and kick tail and take names but that's not the first resort. His efforts to talk down Electro and Green Goblin are great. Peter Parker has some great moments with Aunt May and Gwen Stacy. You never get a feeling that Spidey or Peter's being a jerk.I also have to applaud the way Spidey's webslinging was portrayed. He's never more graceful and being Spider-man never looked more fun than in this movie.I think that Garfield could be to Spider-man what Christopher Reeves was to Superman in the 1970s or what David Tennant was to the new Doctor Who.Emma Stone was also great as Gwen Stacy and Dante DeHaan turned in a muli-faceted performance as Harry Osborn.NegativesThis is a case where great actors were betrayed by a mediocre and often undisciplined script. Director Marc Webb cut two scenes featuring Shailene Woodsley as Mary Jane Watson in order to make the film more focused. I don't fault him for that. The problem was that Webb didn't go far enough to produce a film that could be focused. The movie actually begins with long flashback scene featuring Peter's dead father Richard Parker fighting a bad guy to to ensure his file is uploaded. Yes, we have the most expensive Uploading a File Scene in history.We also have scenes that go nowhere. When Max Dillon is turned into Electro as a result of an Oscorp accident, Gwen, who works for Oscorp, becomes suspicious and searches the company directory and finds she's not there which arouses suspicion and she's chased by Oscorp security. She tells this to Peter and theorizes that Electro is Dillon and that Oscorp is covering it up and our heroes do nothing about it and once Ms. Stacy leaves the building , the villains don't seem to care about it either.The biggest offenses has to do with the two villains. It's not just that the movie has both Electro and Green Goblin, it's how it handled both villains. Electro can be an awesome threat in the comics and could be a great movie villain, but here the character isn't really given a chance to shine. He has one battle with Spidey and is then locked up for most of the film and then has a second battle with Spidey. Both are too short.The Green Goblin has historically been Spider-man's most destructive foe, one who battled him to the point of death multiple times. In the movie, Harry Osborn stumbles upon Goblin equipment in a place he's been led to for something else and so in a matter of minutes, grabs the suit and glider and flies to battle Spider-man. that makes the battle with Venom in Spider-man 3 look well-designed.The film also features a key death and this person was helping Spidey fight Electro and after Electro was dealt with, this newly powered Goblin shows up and causes the death in an utterly cheap scene.With a lesser actor, this movie was absolutely reak, but Andrew Garfield is a joy to watch as Spider-man even though the script is a deadlier foe than either the Green Goblin or Electro.The movie ends on a cliffhanger and hints of a Sinister Six film. It's a prospect I have mixed feelings on. On the one hand, Spidey v. the Sinister Six is the type of classic battle that can be awesome if done right. However, If Webb bad this much trouble managing a film with two villains, how is he going to do with six?",3,So This is the Focused Vesion?,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,4062,"['sequel', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'keeping', 'promises', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'keep', 'Gwen', 'dangers', 'entailed', 'being', 'Spider-man', 'be', 'love', 'same', 'time', 'Spider-man', 'new', 'threats', 'creation', 'Electro', 'then', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Oscorp', 'believing', 'only', 'blood', 'Spider-man', 'can', 'cure', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'inherited', 'father.Plus', 'side', 'biggest', 'plus', 'movie', 'work', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Garfield', 'best', 'most', 'likable', 'Spider-man', 'ever', 'still', 'human', 'flawed', 'struggling', 'not', 'as', 'whiny', 'previous', 'versions.Spider-man', 'grown', 'brooding', 'teenager', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'hero', 'scenes', 'kids', 'are', 'priceless', 'Spidey', 'can', 'take', 'threats', 'kick', 'tail', 'take', 'names', 'not', 'first', 'resort', 'efforts', 'talk', 'down', 'Electro', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'are', 'great', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'great', 'moments', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'Spidey', 'Peter', 'being', 'jerk.I', 'also', 'have', 'applaud', 'way', 'Spidey', 'webslinging', 'was', 'portrayed', 'never', 'more', 'graceful', 'being', 'Spider-man', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'fun', 'movie.I', 'think', 'Garfield', 'could', 'be', 'Spider-man', 'what', 'Christopher', 'was', 'Superman', '1970s', 'what', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who.Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Dante', 'DeHaan', 'turned', 'muli-faceted', 'performance', 'Harry', 'Osborn.NegativesThis', 'case', 'where', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'betrayed', 'mediocre', 'often', 'undisciplined', 'script', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'cut', 'two', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Shailene', 'Woodsley', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'focused', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'problem', 'was', 'Webb', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'produce', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'focused', 'movie', 'actually', 'long', 'flashback', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Peter', 'dead', 'father', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guy', 'ensure', 'file', 'uploaded', 'Yes', 'have', 'most', 'expensive', 'Uploading', 'File', 'Scene', 'history.We', 'also', 'have', 'scenes', 'go', 'nowhere', 'When', 'Max', 'Dillon', 'turned', 'Electro', 'result', 'Oscorp', 'accident', 'Gwen', 'who', 'Oscorp', 'suspicious', 'company', 'directory', 'not', 'suspicion', 'chased', 'Oscorp', 'security', 'Peter', 'Electro', 'Dillon', 'Oscorp', 'covering', 'heroes', 'do', 'nothing', 'once', 'Ms.', 'Stacy', 'building', 'villains', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'biggest', 'offenses', 'do', 'two', 'villains', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'Electro', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'how', 'handled', 'villains', 'Electro', 'can', 'be', 'awesome', 'threat', 'comics', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'villain', 'here', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'one', 'battle', 'Spidey', 'then', 'locked', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'then', 'second', 'battle', 'Spidey', 'are', 'too', 'short.The', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'historically', 'been', 'Spider-man', 'most', 'destructive', 'foe', 'one', 'who', 'battled', 'point', 'death', 'multiple', 'times', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Goblin', 'equipment', 'place', 'been', 'led', 'something', 'else', 'so', 'matter', 'minutes', 'grabs', 'suit', 'glider', 'flies', 'battle', 'Spider-man', 'battle', 'Venom', 'Spider-man', '3', 'look', 'well-designed.The', 'film', 'also', 'key', 'death', 'person', 'was', 'helping', 'Spidey', 'fight', 'Electro', 'Electro', 'was', 'dealt', 'newly', 'powered', 'Goblin', 'up', 'death', 'utterly', 'cheap', 'scene.With', 'lesser', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'reak', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'joy', 'watch', 'Spider-man', 'even', 'script', 'deadlier', 'foe', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Electro.The', 'movie', 'cliffhanger', 'hints', 'Sinister', 'Six', 'film', 'prospect', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'hand', 'Spidey', 'Sinister', 'Six', 'type', 'classic', 'battle', 'can', 'be', 'awesome', 'done', 'right', 'However', 'Webb', 'bad', 'much', 'trouble', 'managing', 'film', 'two', 'villains', 'how', 'going', 'do', 'six']",N/A

I may watch part 2 one more time along the way but I have no great desire to do so. The villains horribly flop in that the costumes that give them uniqueness and identifiability from the comics have been altered drastically.  Electro's face was gimmicky looking while his powers have been seen time and again in any film that uses electricity as a sci fi  focal point. How did he end up with a costume with little lightening bolts on the arms? The Green Goblin who's name I never heard uttered ( but could have missed) had a non threatening look. A real goblin mask would have added to the character. His glider was straight out of the prior Spider-Man films as  well. Is the Rhino worth mentioning?. I understand the&#34; machine&#34; angle but it didn't work. And, we're left hanging with a half engaged battle.Dialogue and character building are great, in a good film, and this film wasn't good because it completely overkilled with long monotonous explanations and trumped up emotional responses from most of the characters. Garfield , although good at times, seemed off in many scenes and just boring. The action sequences were far apart from one another to the point where the film played out like a drama that didn't seem to have,a place for such outlandishness when it occurred. The film had a very negative vibe to it and the connective reasons as to why things appear or need to be seemed rushed.  Areas that needed true explanation got none.I also felt like I could distantly hear the director yelling, &#34;cut&#34;  when Spidey was in perilous scenes. The character of Spider-Man just came off as ultra silly . Seeing a big spider logo in the beginning being stamped onto the film was cheesy and with the accompanying music was more befitting of Superman moment than Spider-Man. I was shocked at my own disappointment in the film. Even Spidys graceful web slinging flights through NYC seemed overly animated. Emma Stone's interesting quirks and cuteness was all that I saw redeemable . The kids will initially  love it, but you might catch them snoring in half hour intervals .

1696726,A2EO4O7D7BA2K8,B00JKPHUE0,Blood,"[4, 8]","Despite it not receiving the kindest critical reviews during its initial release, I was a huge fan of 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". A brand new re-imagining of the popular comic book story, it had surprisingly great performances and amounted to one of the most entertaining films of that year. And after being so keen on the first movie I was extremely excited to hear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was finally going to hit theaters. It may not have lived up to my immense expectations but notwithstanding its many flaws, I really enjoyed it.We pick up our story with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he struggles to balance his relationship with Gwen (Emma Stone) along with his responsibility as Spider-Man.  With fresh villains emerging, including an uber-cheesy Jamie Foxx as Electro and a creepy Green Goblin, he is forced to choose between his own problems and the dangers that face the city. On a much bigger scale than its predecessor, and wildly more lively, it's more of a crowd-pleaser than anything else.It has various issues concerning the antagonists, but the strongest points lie in the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who provide the most heartwarming and endearing scenes. I realize the film may not be for everyone, but I found to be charming and amusing amidst its problems.

Andrew Garfield is a great Spider-Man, he & Emma Stone do have wonderful chemistry on screen. The special effects are well done for the most part. Nicely shot action sequences. The look itself is bright & colorful like the comic books. Very much an improvement over the last film, but suffers with huge flaws. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is a complete utter mess. It's SPIDER-MAN 3 all over again, although not as convoluted as that was. Each backstory for the villains were so simple & little effort put into it. Dane DeHaan is a good Harry Osborn, but he's crowbar in the last 10 minutes once he becomes the Green Goblin. He looks & acts like Evil Ed from FRIGHT NIGHT. Jamie Foxx is completely wasted as Electro, he's so underused here. He's like a cross between Richard Pryor (SUPERMAN III) & Jim Carrey (BATMAN FOREVER). Paul Giamatti is just a cameo as The Rhino, he might as well not been there. He's just a future villain for the next sequel. The storyline structure was so sloppy & so strung together...no pun intended. After seeing the trailers & TV spots, I feel like I saw about 80% of the movie before actual seeing it, that's just sad. What could have been the next great comic book sequel like THE DARK KNIGHT, just ends up not quite hitting the mark. As a SPIDER-MAN sequel? Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 is still far superior. Overall, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is not so amazing, but more like THE SO SO SPIDER-MAN. It feels less like a sequel & more like setup for next installment & future spin-offs. It does have it's moments here & there. It just too long, too bloated, & too overstuffed. See it as a low rental, go into it with low expectations. But if you are obligated to see it anyway in the theater, then see it for cheap at a dollar theater at the earliest matinee showing.

1696731,A1VLZTJ7C7L732,B00JKPHUE0,Chongo,"[3, 7]","I was quite taken back at how this sequel differed greatly from Marc Webb's first Amazing Spider-Man movie. I really loved that particular film. That was a very much more grounded & grittier interpretation that we really hadn't seen with the Sam Raimi movies & I'm not saying ones better than the other since the Raimi & Maguire trilogy is a totally different beast than what Marc Webb's doing, & I'm all for escapism. Personally, we've gotten so caught up in a post Nolan superhero movie genre where everything now has to be pure realism or nothing that we've forgotten that sense of fun & fantasy. But I digress. In this follow up which is more of a mixed bag, its still a brave attempt at perhaps wanting to have a bit more fun in the way of campy villains & easter eggs galore. Besides the top notch special effects & live action, Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Electro truly seems like he's right out of Joel Schumacher's Batman flicks as does the hammy German doctor at Ravencroft Institue. That really left me scratching my head. Was I back in 1995?? Actually I was quite surprised that Electro didn't have a much bigger role in the movie as he was pretty much being promoted as movie Spidey's new major threat yet at the same time I enjoyed that the film really centered on Garfield's Peter Parker more than anything else & not getting itself sidetracked with the bad guys or the brief trivial cameos by characters from the Spidey comics (eg; Alistair Smythe, Felicia Hardy, J. Jonah Jameson, etc.). Rhys Ifans' Lizard was a much more compelling antagonist & just seemed much more successfully realized but while Jamie Foxx's brief scenes don't seem to really add up to anything important besides some eye candy, Dane Dehaan really shine's here as a new movie interpretation of wealthy heir Harry Osbourne. He also successfully brings to life a menacing & vile Green Goblin that's much more appropriate than the Willem Dafoe version ever was. Amazing Spider-Man 2 also successfully ties up some loose ends in regards to his parents disappearance from the first film & while I don't wish to give too much away, Sally Field continues to be perfect as Aunt May & her scenes with Andrew are spectacular as is Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. With a powerful & haunting finale to this movie I still felt somewhat short changed since SEVERAL scenes & dialogue that were present in ALL of the various trailers & TV spots are COMPLETELY ABSENT from the theatrical cut. That annoyed me the most because if you've been following the production of this movie since day one, you will certainly notice a lot of scenes just gone from what you had been seeing for months. That sort of changes your perception of the movie after you've finished watching it & to that end the film comes across as incomplete. Yet I have faith the third film will get back on a more focused track but perhaps a directors cut in the meantime Sony?",4,What a tangled web we weave.....,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,2906,"['was', 'quite', 'taken', 'back', 'how', 'sequel', 'differed', 'greatly', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'first', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'really', 'loved', 'particular', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'grounded', 'grittier', 'interpretation', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'ones', 'better', 'other', 'Raimi', 'Maguire', 'trilogy', 'totally', 'different', 'beast', 'what', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'doing', ""'m"", 'escapism', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'post', 'Nolan', 'movie', 'genre', 'where', 'everything', 'now', 'be', 'pure', 'realism', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'sense', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'digress', 'follow', 'up', 'more', 'mixed', 'bag', 'still', 'brave', 'attempt', 'perhaps', 'wanting', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'fun', 'way', 'campy', 'villains', 'easter', 'eggs', 'galore', 'top', 'notch', 'special', 'effects', 'live', 'action', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'portrayal', 'Electro', 'truly', 'right', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Batman', 'as', 'hammy', 'German', 'doctor', 'Ravencroft', 'Institue', 'really', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'Was', 'back', '1995', 'Actually', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Electro', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'being', 'promoted', 'movie', 'Spidey', 'new', 'major', 'threat', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'really', 'centered', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'bad', 'guys', 'brief', 'trivial', 'cameos', 'characters', 'Spidey', 'comics', 'eg', 'Alistair', 'Smythe', 'Felicia', 'Hardy', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'etc.', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Lizard', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'antagonist', 'just', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'successfully', 'realized', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'brief', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'add', 'up', 'anything', 'important', 'eye', 'candy', 'Dane', 'Dehaan', 'really', 'shine', 'here', 'new', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'wealthy', 'heir', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'also', 'successfully', 'life', 'menacing', 'vile', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'version', 'ever', 'was', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'also', 'successfully', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'regards', 'parents', 'disappearance', 'first', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Sally', 'Field', 'be', 'perfect', 'Aunt', 'May', 'scenes', 'Andrew', 'are', 'spectacular', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'powerful', 'haunting', 'finale', 'movie', 'still', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'short', 'changed', 'SEVERAL', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'were', 'present', 'ALL', 'various', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'are', 'COMPLETELY', 'ABSENT', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'annoyed', 'most', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'production', 'movie', 'day', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'notice', 'lot', 'scenes', 'just', 'gone', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'seeing', 'months', 'sort', 'changes', 'perception', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'watching', 'end', 'film', 'incomplete', 'have', 'faith', 'third', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'more', 'focused', 'track', 'perhaps', 'directors', 'cut', 'meantime', 'Sony']",N/A
1696732,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00JKPHUE0,Chris Kennison,"[6, 13]","I really have grown tired of the endless comparisons of the two series' of Spiderman, the 'Tobey Maguire' trilogy and the reboot &#8220;Amazing Spiderman&#8221;. In this age of cynicism and free technology, it seems that there is no pleasing everybody and the truth is; that's correct. The 'Tobey Maguire' trilogy had its qualities that peaked with the second installment and then lost its way despite 6-films being planned. The third movie was a scripting mess that had multiple villains and still managed to have half the movie taken up with romance and talking about romance. The fourth movie never took off because despite numerous rewrites and retools, Director Sam Raimi continued to &#8220;hate it&#8221;; no surprise from me after seeing &#8220;Spiderman 3&#8221;.Spiderman was rebooted in 2012 with &#8220;The Amazing Spiderman&#8221;, picking up where Raimi's &#8220;Spiderman 4&#8221; was supposed to go; with the Lizard. Yet, many continued to cling to Tobey Maguire's version of Peter Parker like he were the characters originator. Despite the fact that &#8220;The Amazing Spiderman&#8221; has more depth, better acting, better scripting and better more fulfilling action sequences, people don't like change and as usual, fans don't like Hollywood taking liberties with the things they've wrapped their mind around already.&#8220;Amazing Spiderman 2&#8221;, upon first observation looked as though it were going to fall into the same pitfall as numerous other superhero movies with too many story-lines going on. Early on it did have a couple awkward scene transitions. Although, for the most part, this is a movie about Spiderman and Electro with Oscorp and Harry Osborne in the background. As I said before, the scripting is well done, the balance is well juggled and regardless which story-line they are giving us, it all ties together in the end; a sign of much better writing than the original series.I don't judge movies based upon what came before, what is 'supposed' to be or what my brain may have scripted for the movie, I judge based upon the movie at hand. &#8220;The Amazing Spiderman 2&#8221; is a tremendously fun, funny, dramatic and emotional success. Sally Field and Andrew Garfield bring a personality and depth to the character's that has done exactly what the creator's intended; rebooting the series and taking it to a new level.I was excited after the first &#8220;Amazing Spiderman&#8221; because I knew that the establishment of Spiderman was out of the way; again, and that the second installment would be more fulfilling and more action packed. I was not disappointed and I can't wait for whatever is next in the Spiderman universe. For those who are still clinging to Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi; they aren't coming back. They are in the past.

Him idolizing spiderman, him hating spiderman later on just did not make sense whatsoever to me- THE LOVE STORYOkay i get all superhero movies need love stories but this movie just over-did it.  They pushed too much romance into it and the film focused way too much on gwen and him rather than rhino electro or goblin, I paid to see spiderman vs electro and epic fight scenes, not a love story because we ofcourse havent seen that done many times. It just gets boring.Now finally on to the good things.+spiderman (the movie shows way too much in the trailer i admit spiderman had his moments, lots of action and good stunts)+green goblin great character and much better villian then electro in my opinion, i just wish he was more in it+i liked the aunt may moments in the movie+Aside for some romantic scenes, no scene honestly was boring or felt dragged on+ i liked all the oscorp plot revealsThis movie knows when it neeeds to be serious and also had its comedy moments that actually worked unlike thor 2. but anyways it answers alot of questions from part 1 and i loved the ending, they are setting part 3 up to be the biggest movie and im very excited.

1696734,ACJVGDN8G386P,B00JKPHUE0,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[2, 6]","Stan Lee's original idea in the creation of Spider-man was to portray a typical teenage kid with all the navigation problems of someone of that age while also including a superhero alter-ego in the mix. Peter Park, who becomes Spider-man, was in his original conception an orphaned science wiz-kid who was bitten by a radioactive spider which gave him powers and abilities similar to those of a spider while still remaining a human being. Unfortunately, the present installments of &#34;the Amazing Spider-man&#34; on film with Andrew Garfield as Spider-man has changed much about what made Peter Parker a compelling character.While Garfield is a relatively convincing actor playing roles 10 years younger than his real age, the studios have opted to re-invent Peter Parker as a cool hip late teen. Instead of the nerdy wiz kid of the 1960's and 70's, the new Parker looks more like the lead singer of the latest all-boy teen pop sensation. The problem with Garfield as Peter Parker is he's just too cool and good-looking. He dates the best-looking girl in school, who also happens to be the valedictorian, and sports perfect hair and complexion which were probably made possible by the make-up artists of Vogue Magazine. Peter Parker of the original never quite fit in as a teen in school, and his becoming Spider-man helped him act out a kind of fantasy which he couldn't as Peter Parker. I think the biggest problem I had with believing Garfield was Parker was that I didn't see why the best-looking male in school would need to don a costume and right wrongs. For the nerdy not perfect-looking Parker it makes more sense. For the way-too-cool Garfield who looks like Justin Bieber's older brother, I couldn't buy him as Peter Parker, the brilliant but geeky kid who wasn't popular. Garfield comes off as the not-so-brilliant but highly popular teen who would have a waiting list of girls who desire to date him.Aside from the problem with casting, the current film has some interesting aspects and very confusing plot elements. The film begins with a flash-back of a couple we learn later were Peter Parker's true parents, Richard and Mary Parker. Richard has been engaged in some kind of top secret project which turns out to be both lucrative and very dangerous. Fast-forward to the present. Parker, now just graduated from high school, learns that his father and his boyhood friend Harry's father were both involved in research to foster regeneration through DNA found in spiders. Harry has now inherited his father's corporation, Oscorp, but also has inherited a degenerative disease. He comes to believe a transfusion of Spider-man's blood will offer him the regenerative abilities he needs to cure himself.At the same time, at Oscorp, a lowly but brilliant technician through an accident, gains power through electricity, becoming one of Spider-man's archenemies, Electro. At first, the person who became Electro and Harry appear to be on good terms with Peter Parker. Eventually, they both become his adversaries. Intertwined through the story is the love affair between Parker and Gwen (Emma Stone). For some reason, I felt the love story aspect was allowed too much screen time, and the other plots about Harry and Electro were underdeveloped. The story becomes a kind of foursome, with Harry and Electro challenging Spider-man and in some ways his girl Gwen, who also works for Oscorp.A decent but somewhat confusing story. Much screen-time is devoted to long action sequences and the love story, but the plot about the corporation and the secret research is underdeveloped and not explained thoroughly. While still relatively entertaining, the script probably needed about 2 or 3 more rewrites. Less Spider-man flying around and more about his father and the secret research. It kind of gets better as it goes along but I had many questions which were left unanswered by film's end.",3,Too-Cool Garfield as Spider-man and Disjointed Storyline Make for Mixed Superhero Cinema,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,3897,"['Stan', 'Lee', 'original', 'idea', 'creation', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'portray', 'typical', 'teenage', 'kid', 'navigation', 'problems', 'someone', 'age', 'also', 'including', 'superhero', 'alter-ego', 'mix', 'Peter', 'Park', 'who', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'original', 'conception', 'orphaned', 'science', 'wiz-kid', 'who', 'was', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'gave', 'powers', 'abilities', 'similar', 'spider', 'still', 'remaining', 'human', 'being', 'Unfortunately', 'present', 'installments', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', '34', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Spider-man', 'changed', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'compelling', 'character.While', 'Garfield', 'relatively', 'convincing', 'actor', 'playing', 'roles', '10', 'years', 'younger', 'real', 'age', 'studios', 'have', 'opted', 're-invent', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'cool', 'hip', 'late', 'teen', 'Instead', 'nerdy', 'wiz', 'kid', '1960', '70', 'new', 'Parker', 'more', 'lead', 'singer', 'latest', 'all-boy', 'teen', 'pop', 'sensation', 'problem', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'just', 'too', 'cool', 'good-looking', 'best-looking', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'valedictorian', 'sports', 'perfect', 'hair', 'complexion', 'were', 'probably', 'made', 'possible', 'make-up', 'artists', 'Vogue', 'Magazine', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'original', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'teen', 'school', 'becoming', 'Spider-man', 'helped', 'act', 'out', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'could', ""n't"", 'Peter', 'Parker', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'believing', 'Garfield', 'was', 'Parker', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'best-looking', 'male', 'school', 'would', 'need', 'don', 'costume', 'right', 'wrongs', 'nerdy', 'not', 'perfect-looking', 'Parker', 'more', 'sense', 'way-too-cool', 'Garfield', 'who', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'older', 'brother', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'brilliant', 'geeky', 'kid', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'Garfield', 'off', 'not-so-brilliant', 'highly', 'popular', 'teen', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'waiting', 'list', 'girls', 'who', 'desire', 'date', 'him.Aside', 'problem', 'casting', 'current', 'film', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'very', 'confusing', 'plot', 'elements', 'film', 'flash-back', 'couple', 'learn', 'later', 'were', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'true', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Mary', 'Parker', 'Richard', 'been', 'engaged', 'kind', 'top', 'secret', 'project', 'out', 'be', 'lucrative', 'very', 'dangerous', 'Fast-forward', 'present', 'Parker', 'now', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'father', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'Harry', 'father', 'were', 'involved', 'research', 'foster', 'regeneration', 'DNA', 'found', 'spiders', 'Harry', 'now', 'inherited', 'father', 'corporation', 'Oscorp', 'also', 'inherited', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'believe', 'transfusion', 'Spider-man', 'blood', 'will', 'offer', 'regenerative', 'abilities', 'cure', 'same', 'time', 'Oscorp', 'lowly', 'brilliant', 'technician', 'accident', 'gains', 'power', 'electricity', 'becoming', 'one', 'Spider-man', 'archenemies', 'Electro', 'first', 'person', 'who', 'became', 'Electro', 'Harry', 'appear', 'be', 'good', 'terms', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Eventually', 'become', 'adversaries', 'Intertwined', 'story', 'love', 'affair', 'Parker', 'Gwen', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'reason', 'felt', 'love', 'story', 'aspect', 'was', 'allowed', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'plots', 'Harry', 'Electro', 'were', 'underdeveloped', 'story', 'kind', 'foursome', 'Harry', 'Electro', 'challenging', 'Spider-man', 'ways', 'girl', 'Gwen', 'who', 'also', 'Oscorp.A', 'decent', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'story', 'Much', 'screen-time', 'devoted', 'long', 'action', 'sequences', 'love', 'story', 'plot', 'corporation', 'secret', 'research', 'underdeveloped', 'not', 'explained', 'thoroughly', 'still', 'relatively', 'entertaining', 'script', 'probably', 'needed', 'about', '2', '3', 'more', 'rewrites', 'Less', 'Spider-man', 'flying', 'around', 'more', 'father', 'secret', 'research', 'kind', 'better', 'had', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'left', 'unanswered', 'film', 'end']",N/A
1696735,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B00JKPHUE0,Cool Breeze,"[8, 14]","When it comes to the reimagining of a previous iteration of a beloved movie, the initial reaction is the desire to compare, contrast, and the pass judgment on the quality of the remake against the previous version.  This is especially true when the remake is released not too many years after the original.  Hollywood seems to be doing a lot of reimagining lately; and in some cases this reimaging takes place within a couple of years of the original. There is the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (loved it), Let Me In (loved it), Man of Steel (liked it), The Punisher (hated it) and so many more. Are these new movies necessary? I think it depends on the type of movie, and if there is an appetite for it.  And based upon the critical reception and economic fortunes of these movies, people don't seem to mind too much. I did mind that someone thought that is was a good idea to reboot The Punisher though. I just want to put that out there.I am happy that Sony thought it was a good idea to reboot the Spiderman series.  I was surprised that the movie studio had decided to reboot the series just three years after Sam Raimi had completed work on the previous Spiderman series(I can only describe it as mediocre), but happy nonetheless.  The main reason for my elation is the ever increasing pace of technological advancement.  Technological advancement has given the filmmaker the means to create a superhero movie that can satiate the needs of the most critical comic book fan boys; and wow a general audience. I am not lying when say that I saw many mouths agape during a 3D screening of the first Amazing Spiderman film in 2012.For those of you who cannot stop extolling the wonderfulness of Sam Raimi's Spiderman films and think it necessary to trash the Amazing Spiderman 2, I say this: keep an open mind. Because of the technology that was used to create the action scenes in the Amazing Spiderman 2, Sam Rami's Spiderman movies look somewhat outdated; Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker and Spiderman than Tobey McGuire.  Garfield fully inhabits the physical and emotional character of Peter Parker while Tobey McGuire plays a version of his character in the movie Pleasantville; and Emma Stone's performance as Peter Parker's love interest complete blows Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary Jane out of the water. But Raimi's Spiderman movies are much better stories than the Amazing Spiderman movies; and an insufficient storyline is the main problem with Marc Webb's Amazing Spiderman 2.The Amazing Spiderman is two and one half hours long, but I couldn't help but feel as if the storylines for all of the major players in this movie were rushed.  Electro (played by Jamie Fox), The Green Goblin (Dane Dehann), and the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) each have an origin story in this movie, and all of them are revealed at a breakneck pace, especially in the case of Jaime Fox.  I do like Jaime's portrayal of Electro in this film; however, his metamorphosis from geeky engineer to bad ass super villain seems to take place within a ten minute span, and is eerily reminiscent of Jim Carry's transformation from nerdy admirer of Batman to the Riddler in Batman Forever.  And after ten years of estrangement and the death of a father, Harry Osborne and Peter Parker reunite and become friends again in the next scene?  It's all too rushed and choppy.And why do all of the villains of the Amazing Spiderman 2 have to have an origin story?  In each of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, the Dark Knight is confronted by more than one villain; however the director does not feel the need to flesh out all of their backstories.  The Joker, Bane, and the Scarecrow are already established villains at the time of their introductions in their respective films, and by spending less time on their origin stories the film makers are able to devote more of their time on essential aspects of the movie that help to tell the story. Perhaps The Amazing Spiderman's creators should have looked to Nolan for inspiration?There is rampant speculation that the producers at Sony are formulating a plan to release a Sinister Six movie.  After the success of the Avengers movie-the current gold standard for the multi-superhero/villain film- I don't begrudge them for it.  However, there is no guarantee that this Sinister Six film will be a good movie.  And if I were the creators of these Spiderman movies, I would be careful.  Everyone remembers The Batman and Robin movie that Joel Schumacher made in 1997; the one with George Clooney wearing the Batman nipple suit that nearly ruined the entire Batman franchise.With all of that said, I think that The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a good time at the movies.  That scene where Spiderman is flying through the skies of New York City, while his Spiderman suit ripples in the wind is so exhilarating.  This movie-like many of the other superhero movies that are being made today-is sort of a miracle. The fact that movie makers are able to create a credible movie about an alternate world, where a young man or woman is so otherworldly in his/her talent is pretty amazing.  So watch the Amazing Spiderman 2.  You won't fall asleep during the film and the kids will love it too.",4,A Fun Movie with Problems,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,5213,"['When', 'reimagining', 'previous', 'iteration', 'beloved',

1696736,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00JKPHUE0,C. Sawin,"[6, 14]","The comic book fan in you will rejoice when it sees Spider-Man web sling in &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2.&#34; Spider-Man finally moves the way you've always imagined. The perspectives used while he's swinging through the air are astounding as you see and hear the fabric of his costume blow in the wind while the gargantuan scope of the city is captured whenever the camera zooms out to show how small Spider-Man really is in comparison. It's almost as if the film is trying to show you that Spider-Man really is like a spider compared to the size of New York.&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; is extremely overzealous when it comes to how many stories it tries to juggle in its 142-minute duration. It was confirmed as of late that Sony plans to expand the Spider-Man universe by doing spinoff films such as &#34;The Sinister Six&#34; and &#34;Venom.&#34; The proper seeds would begin being planted in this sequel and the next one before the release of the two spinoffs and finally culminating with &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 4.&#34; The concept sounds harmless and intriguing, but it just seems to be executed in a similarly disastrous way that you've already seen before.Between Peter's ongoing drama with Gwen, Electro's desire to be worshiped, Harry's rise in Oscorp, and Peter's ongoing road to discovering the truth about his father, &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; has a lot of side stories to intertwine, coexist, and somehow deliver a film that's cohesively sound for audiences to enjoy. Sprinkle in these little Easter eggs to future films and villains along with whatever other shout outs the creators deem necessary (B.J. Novak portrays Alistair Smythe, the creator of the Spider-Slayers) and the superhero film becomes more than a little unbalanced.The dialogue is laughably atrocious at times. Spider-Man's quick wit and motor mouth do sneak through the cracks, but Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci should be ashamed of what is said in this film. Electro's &#34;It's my birthday and it's time for me to light my candles,&#34; line has you waving the white flag early on but throw in little nuggets like Spidey's, &#34;Come to daddy,&#34; line Harry's &#34;Fairy Godmother&#34; speech, and Electro's, &#34;Right as rain,&#34; phrase and you have a bunch of out of date phrases that even the most antiquated of gentlemen would stroke their mustache and shake their head at.Grazing over the numerous times you're forced to see Andrew Garfield take his shirt off, the massive amount of lens flares that take a nod from J.J. Abrams, and ignoring the fact that Electro mostly looks like a dog turd with an electrical current coursing through it, the other big issue is how fast the film speeds through the Harry Osborn storyline. Harry was brought in for one specific purpose that is very obvious if you're at all familiar with the comic books. Harry's evolution to super villain status is almost as rushed as Sinestro's in &#34;The Green Lantern.&#34;Even though the film is almost two and a half hours long, &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; scrambles through half a dozen storylines and easily draws comparisons to the sloppy &#34;Spider-Man 3.&#34; Andrew Garfield is as strong as ever as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker and the on-screen chemistry between the main cast is mesmerizing. &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; suffers from trying to cram too much fanfare into one pudgy film, which can't be saved by its overflowing surge of spectacular special effects.",3,My spider-sense is chaotic and convoluted.,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,3485,"['comic', 'book', 'fan', 'will', 'rejoice', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'web', 'sling', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2.', '34', 'Spider-Man', 'finally', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'imagined', 'perspectives', 'used', 'swinging', 'air', 'are', 'astounding', 'see', 'hear', 'fabric', 'costume', 'blow', 'wind', 'gargantuan', 'scope', 'city', 'captured', 'camera', 'out', 'show', 'how', 'small', 'Spider-Man', 'really', 'comparison', 'almost', 'film', 'trying', 'show', 'Spider-Man', 'really', 'spider', 'compared', 'size', 'New', 'York.', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'extremely', 'overzealous', 'when', 'how', 'many', 'stories', 'juggle', '142-minute', 'duration', 'was', 'confirmed', 'late', 'Sony', 'expand', 'Spider-Man', 'universe', 'doing', 'spinoff', 'films', 'such', '34', 'Sinister', 'Six', '34', '34', 'Venom.', '34', 'proper', 'seeds', 'would', 'begin', 'being', 'planted', 'sequel', 'next', 'one', 'release', 'two', 'spinoffs', 'finally', 'culminating', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '4.', '34', 'concept', 'harmless', 'intriguing', 'just', 'be', 'executed', 'similarly', 'disastrous', 'way', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'before.Between', 'Peter', 'ongoing', 'drama', 'Gwen', 'Electro', 'desire', 'be', 'worshiped', 'Harry', 'rise', 'Oscorp', 'Peter', 'ongoing', 'road', 'discovering', 'truth', 'father', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'lot', 'side', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'coexist', 'somehow', 'deliver', 'film', 'cohesively', 'sound', 'audiences', 'enjoy', 'Sprinkle', 'little', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'future', 'films', 'villains', 'other', 'shout', 'creators', 'deem', 'necessary', 'B.J', 'Novak', 'Alistair', 'Smythe', 'creator', 'Spider-Slayers', 'superhero', 'film', 'more', 'little', 'unbalanced.The', 'dialogue', 'laughably', 'atrocious', 'times', 'Spider-Man', 'quick', 'wit', 'motor', 'mouth', 'do', 'sneak', 'cracks', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'Roberto', 'Orci', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'what', 'said', 'film', 'Electro', '34', 'birthday', 'time', 'light', 'candles', '34', 'line', 'waving', 'white', 'flag', 'early', 'throw', 'little', 'nuggets', 'Spidey', '34', 'Come', 'daddy', '34', 'line', 'Harry', '34', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', '34', 'speech', 'Electro', '34', 'Right', 'rain', '34', 'phrase', 'have', 'bunch', 'date', 'phrases', 'even', 'most', 'antiquated', 'gentlemen', 'would', 'stroke', 'mustache', 'shake', 'head', 'at.Grazing', 'numerous', 'times', ""'re"", 'forced', 'see', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'take', 'shirt', 'massive', 'amount', 'lens', 'flares', 'take', 'nod', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'Electro', 'mostly', 'dog', 'turd', 'electrical', 'current', 'coursing', 'other', 'big', 'issue', 'how', 'fast', 'film', 'speeds', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'storyline', 'Harry', 'was', 'brought', 'one', 'specific', 'purpose', 'very', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'comic', 'books', 'Harry', 'evolution', 'super', 'villain', 'status', 'almost', 'as', 'rushed', 'Sinestro', '34', 'Green', 'Lantern.', '34', 'Even', 'film', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'scrambles', 'dozen', 'storylines', 'easily', 'draws', 'comparisons', 'sloppy', '34', 'Spider-Man', '3.', '34', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'as', 'strong', 'as', 'ever', 'Spider-Man', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'main', 'cast', 'mesmerizing', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'suffers', 'trying', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'fanfare', 'one', 'pudgy', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved', 'overflowing', 'surge', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects']",N/A
1696737,A1BB4H9G9APMT3,B00JKPHUE0,Da Jester,"[8, 15]","Wow. Just when I thought a movie couldn't be worse than Spider-Man 3, along comes the Amazing Spider-Man 2.Yes, Spider-Man 3 had its issues, huge ones. However, in comparison to a movie franchise that apparently had to be rebooted due to it's predessoser, it's at least more fun to watch....unlike the sequel to a reboot.The huge noticeable problem, the Villians. Did Jaime Foxx watch Batman Forever before going onto set? It's 2014 people. The age of super cheesiness should be over. Yes, I understand this is a film based on a comic book, but if you are going to have cheesey elements for humor's sake, THEN HAVE IT FUNNY OR ENTERTAINING! Not groaningly awful to watch. Like Halle Berry in Catwoman, here's hoping that Foxx recieves a golden Raspberry for the year.Contributing to the cheese is the soundtrack for Electro's screen time. Everytime Electro (even prior to transformation) is viewed, we have this whispering dubstep playing. Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams probably thought it was innovative to have this attached for thier villian, but its more annoying and uneeded.Next up, Harry Osborn. The intention is to have this guy be a rich bratty kid who asks too much for his own sake. What we get is an actor who does nail it on a emo teen level, but has some of the hardest dialogue to stomach through. To make Harry's undeniably cheesey fate even worse in the film, it slams right into an area of,""what, wait, why!? that's retarded"" level."" To reasoning and logic behind the transformation of Harry into Green Goblin  was executed poorly and just laughable. Do not expect much from it. Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, tacked onto the end for...the hell of it I guess.The Rhino: Already a dumb villain to begin with in the comics, but once again, could have just stayed completely out. I agreed with the idea  of a the exo-mech suit version from watching the trailers, but when you actually it in action, it's  very awful looking. Good thing there isn't that much screen time of it.What's definetly improved from the previous entry is Andrew Garfield's acting. This time he actually made an effot to make Peter Parker less annoying, and more like the Spider-Man us comic nerds love. I'm not sure if that was intentional since he was more of a teenager in the Amazing Spider-Man and now more mature. Possibly the director listened to critics about Garfield's performance of the last film and understood that angst and Shia Lebouf stammering is never a fun thing to watch. But remember, this was an effort and an effort that still does not help amend the terrible things in this movie.It was nice to see more of a real person wearing the suit and interacting with other actors during calmer sections. Spider-Man is one of the few super heroes protrayed in movies where the city he protects actually appreciate the vigilante. The Spidey-humor in TASM2 is actually good this time and not jerkish as the previous installment displayed. The script writers actually inserted some good one lines for the web head and I'll admit that I actually laughed. Not in spite, but it was actually funny. The web slinging CGI action is significantly improved. Even some Electro parts are well done.However, much like how I felt about Man of Steel, eventually something else dumb happens and I am immediately reminded of why I hate this movie. Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker moments can literally tie the movie down. The chemistry is good between the characters, but you could get a vibe that Marc Webb's forte is directing romance interactions better than the main scifi action material. The Continuity and the sci fi reasoning for why Oscorp is the way it is undeniably typical and too obvious. It's a cliche that we have seen so many times from watching movies, TV, and playing video games. In the original Spider-Man trilogy, Oscorp was just a backdrop. Only James Franco's Harry and Willam Defoe's Norman were the real villians. The explanation of Norman's disease and his ""disapointment"" with young Harry is explained poorly and just idiotic. Get ready to be forced fed ""The Corporation is really this or the corporation is really that"" scenario. Come on, could they not have thought of something else more sinister, like Iron Man's The ten Rings as the emodiment of the true evil? Once again, it's like Sony wrote this movie to display what they envisioned of a Spider-Man film. Not a filmaker's vision, not a comic book geek's ideal, but a company...The irony here is actually hilarious when you think of it.""No, Spider-Man is our expirament! And we'll reboot him as many times as we need to with terrible movies that convey no real vision of the character! BWAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"" More movies! More crappy video games! More!"" --Some Sony executive.Look, if Joss Whedon and other directors of the Disney Marvel movies can make demi-gods, men in machine armor, the Hulk, and a WW II super soldier interesting for a present day setting, then why the hell is the Amazing Spider Man 2's struggling at this? All of the kinks should have been ironed out with this installment, and yet more problems emerged. I wish Sony would give it up and hand it over to Marvel. It's severely obvious Marvel knows how to make thier source material watchable instead of putting franchise property ownership first. A true Spider-Man fan can notice that and not that it ""needed"" the rebooted due to one movie. ""But Spidey always had web shooters!"" Sorry, that is just not enough of a reason, guys. What we are inclinced to get in the future of this franchise are probably more poorly executed what-could-have-beens or sounded-good-on-paper-but-dumb-to-watch movies.Good god, even the Stan Lee Cameo

I would of just left green goblin out and focused on some other villians. but the guy who played harry did a good job. and I think paul giamuati is going to be a good rhino. he was only in the movie for like 5 minutes but I think they will have him in the third film. for those who saw the movie you know what I mean. and I believe  they are taking the sinister six route cause if you look carefully in the movie where they are doing a little montage in the special area in oscorp you will see familiar stuff. so look close for those who have not seen the movie. and I can't wait to see 3. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,5,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,985,"['movie', 'amazing', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'playing', 'Electro', 'nailed', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'changed', 'green', 'goblin', 'origin', 'guess', 'did', 'right', 'first', 'movie', 'guess', 'can', 'change', 'little', 'would', 'just', 'left', 'green', 'goblin', 'focused', 'other', 'villians', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'harry', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'think', 'paul', 'giamuati', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'rhino', 'was', 'only', 'movie', '5', 'minutes', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'third', 'film', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'believe', 'are', 'taking', 'sinister', 'six', 'route', 'cause', 'look', 'carefully', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'doing', 'little', 'montage', 'special', 'area', 'oscorp', 'will', 'see', 'familiar', 'stuff', 'so', 'look', 'close', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', '3.', 'movie', 'awesome', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'recommend', 'do']",N/A
1696739,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00JKPHUE0,D. Holmes,"[8, 20]","I despised The Amazing Spider-Man, Sony's first bid to reboot the web-slinging franchise only a few short years after the lucrative and largely satisfying Tobey Maguire-led trilogy concluded.  Despite the charming romantic energy shared by freshman stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, I found the film to be a lethargic, unimaginative, and at times even unpleasant copy without distinction.  The second film (or one could call it the fifth) is a tad more satisfying, perhaps because it is more absurd and therefore more distinctive by default.  It is still, however, flawed through and through, further cementing poor Spider-Man as a hero with a fading star compared to, among others, Batman, Iron Man, and the X-Men.  Garfield and Stone are once again a pleasant pair, even when forced to go through predictable motions involving standard-issue secret-identity-versus-romantic-stability tension and a potential move to England for her.The most dire problem here, as already diagnosed by many, is the vast amount of character and story crowded into every corner of its overlong two-and-a-half-hour length.  There is so much going on!  An example which illustrates the overall issue is the character of Harry Osborn, the troubled heir who is foe to Spider-Man, but friend to his alter-ego, Peter.  Dane DeHaan, replacing James Franco in the role, is a fantastic up-and-coming actor.  His icy blue eyes rivet, and he can sneer with style.  There is only so much he can do, though, when, within the space of this single film, Osborn is introduced, established as an old friend of Peter's, pushed to the edge of desperation, and then spends around five minutes as the notorious Green Goblin, complete with elf ears, a half-decomposed face, and a maniacal chortle reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz.  There is no grace, no sense of a natural human trajectory.  The character is always pushed by the mechanical requirements of the storyline, so the intended impact of every turn is at the very least halved.  This charge holds for most of the film's elements, including Jamie Foxx as Electro and an ongoing espionage-flavored mystery regarding Peter's parents, a bit of intended intrigue unique to this vein of Spider-Man films which is beyond uninteresting.  Kinetic, if plastic action sequences and a gifted cast can only compensate so much for a forced, soulless narrative.",2,"Mediocre sequel, yet still a minor improvement",1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,2369,"['despised', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'Sony', 'first', 'bid', 'reboot', 'web-slinging', 'franchise', 'only', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'lucrative', 'largely', 'satisfying', 'Tobey', 'Maguire-led', 'trilogy', 'concluded', 'charming', 'romantic', 'energy', 'shared', 'freshman', 'stars', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'lethargic', 'unimaginative', 'times', 'even', 'unpleasant', 'copy', 'distinction', 'second', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'fifth', 'tad', 'more', 'satisfying', 'perhaps', 'more', 'absurd', 'therefore', 'more', 'distinctive', 'default', 'still', 'however', 'flawed', 'further', 'cementing', 'poor', 'Spider-Man', 'hero', 'fading', 'star', 'compared', 'others', 'Batman', 'Iron', 'Man', 'X-Men', 'Garfield', 'Stone', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'pleasant', 'pair', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'go', 'predictable', 'motions', 'involving', 'standard-issue', 'secret-identity-versus-romantic-stability', 'tension', 'potential', 'move', 'England', 'her.The', 'most', 'dire', 'problem', 'here', 'already', 'diagnosed', 'many', 'vast', 'amount', 'character', 'story', 'crowded', 'corner', 'overlong', 'two-and-a-half-hour', 'length', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'example', 'overall', 'issue', 'character', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'troubled', 'heir', 'who', 'foe', 'Spider-Man', 'friend', 'alter-ego', 'Peter', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'replacing', 'James', 'Franco', 'role', 'fantastic', 'up-and-coming', 'actor', 'icy', 'blue', 'eyes', 'rivet', 'can', 'sneer', 'style', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'though', 'when', 'space', 'single', 'film', 'Osborn', 'introduced', 'established', 'old', 'friend', 'Peter', 'pushed', 'edge', 'desperation', 'then', 'around', 'five', 'minutes', 'notorious', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'complete', 'elf', 'ears', 'half-decomposed', 'face', 'maniacal', 'chortle', 'reminiscent', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'grace', 'sense', 'natural', 'human', 'trajectory', 'character', 'always', 'pushed', 'mechanical', 'requirements', 'storyline', 'intended', 'impact', 'turn', 'very', 'least', 'halved', 'charge', 'most', 'film', 'elements', 'including', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Electro', 'ongoing', 'espionage-flavored', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'Peter', 'parents', 'bit', 'intended', 'intrigue', 'unique', 'vein', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'uninteresting', 'Kinetic', 'plastic', 'action', 'sequences', 'gifted', 'cast', 'can', 'only', 'compensate', 'so', 'much', 'forced', 'soulless', 'narrative']",N/A

I went into the theater with low expectations after reading some lukewarm reviews. I ended up being even more disappointed than I expected.The film starts out very good, but with too many distractions to really tell a well thought out story. Peter and Gwen's relationship, Peter and Aunt May, Peter's search for the truth about his parents and so on and so forth. The problem with all of these little diversions is that it gets in the way of character development and that is where this film fails miserably.  We don't care about the villains ( and our hero and his girlfriend or aunt for that matter) in this film because they have no substance.Villain design is weak, Electro isn't bad, but it would have been a nice nod to the comic version if they could have had the electric in his body sort of shooting out of his head to mimic the lightning bolt mask his comic counterpart wore.  The Goblin is especially weak with some ridiculous non-sense about a strange family disease which is fatal, but why the spider venom turns him into a greenish lunatic is a mystery? The Rhino looks cool, but we'll get to that in a minute....After the opening sequence there isn't much action for a long time and I found myself getting bored. The entire sub plot about Peter's parents should have been dropped from this film. It wasn't too distracting in the first film as it didn't bog things down, but in the film it is totally unnecessary and it isn't really engaging enough to take away from developing the characters of Max and Harry, so the development of the villains is basically non existent.When we do get action the special effects are great but the baddies seem to get beaten much too quickly. The goblin appears and then gets defeated in a minute and you're left thinking ""that's it?"" The worst of all is the Rhino which is just a shameless plug for a future installment. When the film ended I didn't feel satisfied at all. In fact I was disappointed with most of it.The best parts of Spider Man 2 are when we get to see ol' web head doing what he does best, cracking jokes and swinging through the city. Garfield  may have Spider Man down, but he isn't nearly as interesting as McGuire was as Parker. Garfield's Parker is much too sure of himself and seems out of character as the genius nerd he should be. Sure he grew into his confidence later in the comics, but that was way later in comic history.  Garfield's Parker had confidence right from the get go in the first movie so we don't see much growth. The Parker from the early comics would have never stood up to Flash ( before being bitten by the spider) like he does in the first film.The chemistry between him and Stone is very good thou and probably the strongest point in both films( besides the great special effects), but they spend too much time with their drama and it isn't nearly as interesting as McGuire and Dunst from the Raimi trilogy. I don't ever want to hear how bad Spider Man 3 was again because compared to this film it was the Citizen Kane of super hero films!I usually wait for the video release to come out before I review a film, but I wanted to write this while it was fresh in my mind, hopefully I'll like it more the second time around, but I doubt it.",3,"DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL, 3 STARS FOR WHAT THEY DO GET RIGHT!",1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3346,"['Spider', 'Man', '2', 'one', 'thing', 'reboot', 'Spider', 'Man', 'will', 'never', 'top', 'Raimi', 'trilogy', 'went', 'theater', 'low', 'expectations', 'reading', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed', 'expected.The', 'film', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'many', 'distractions', 'really', 'tell', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'story', 'Peter', 'Gwen', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Peter', 'search', 'truth', 'parents', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'problem', 'little', 'diversions', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'where', 'film', 'miserably', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'villains', 'hero', 'girlfriend', 'aunt', 'matter', 'film', 'have', 'substance.Villain', 'design', 'weak', 'Electro', ""n't"", 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'nod', 'comic', 'version', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'electric', 'body', 'sort', 'shooting', 'head', 'mimic', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'mask', 'comic', 'counterpart', 'wore', 'Goblin', 'especially', 'weak', 'ridiculous', 'non-sense', 'strange', 'family', 'disease', 'fatal', 'why', 'spider', 'venom', 'greenish', 'lunatic', 'mystery', 'Rhino', 'cool', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', '.After', 'opening', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'long', 'time', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'entire', 'sub', 'plot', 'Peter', 'parents', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'distracting', 'first', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bog', 'things', 'down', 'film', 'totally', 'unnecessary', ""n't"", 'really', 'engaging', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'developing', 'characters', 'Max', 'Harry', 'development', 'villains', 'basically', 'non', 'existent.When', 'do', 'get', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'baddies', 'seem', 'get', 'beaten', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'goblin', 'then', 'defeated', 'minute', ""'re"", 'left', 'thinking', 'worst', 'Rhino', 'just', 'shameless', 'plug', 'future', 'installment', 'When', 'film', 'ended', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'satisfied', 'fact', 'was', 'disappointed', 'most', 'it.The', 'best', 'parts', 'Spider', 'Man', '2', 'are', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'ol', 'web', 'head', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'swinging', 'city', 'Garfield', 'may', 'have', 'Spider', 'Man', 'down', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'McGuire', 'was', 'Parker', 'Garfield', 'Parker', 'much', 'too', 'sure', 'character', 'genius', 'should', 'be', 'Sure', 'grew', 'confidence', 'later', 'comics', 'was', 'way', 'later', 'comic', 'history', 'Garfield', 'Parker', 'had', 'confidence', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'first', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'growth', 'Parker', 'early', 'comics', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'stood', 'up', 'Flash', 'being', 'bitten', 'spider', 'first', 'film.The', 'chemistry', 'Stone', 'very', 'good', 'thou', 'probably', 'strongest', 'point', 'films', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'drama', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'McGuire', 'Dunst', 'Raimi', 'trilogy', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'want', 'hear', 'how', 'bad', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'was', 'again', 'compared', 'film', 'was', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'usually', 'wait', 'video', 'release', 'come', 'out', 'review', 'film', 'wanted', 'write', 'was', 'fresh', 'mind', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'like', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'doubt']",N/A

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I really like Andrew Garfield and hope to see him in many other movies. Still, both this and the first one were good enough. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was disappointed in them. They pretty much met up to my expectations. Spidy is back and this time his foe is his best friend Harry Osborn or the Green Goblin and Max Dillon or Electro played by Jamie Fox. This one, like the third one in the McGuire trilogy, just had too much going on. It was too bogged down and wasn&#8217;t able to flesh the plot out more. My favorite thing about this movie is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. You can tell those two are together in real life. They work perfectly together. I just love Emma Stone. She is great in everything. I also think Dane DeHaan, was a perfect actor for Harry, but I though Jamie Fox was a little miss-cast. He was convincing as the nerd side, but not as much as Electro somehow. Jamie Fox, like everyone else in this are quality actors who did the best with the script they had.

1696744,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00JKPHUE0,FNDNreview,"[9, 25]","Growing up a massive comic book fan, Spider-Man was always the superhero that I found myself following and relating to more than any other.  Spidey&#8217;s playful personality, filled with humorous quips and charming banter, showcases his endless charismatic potential. Throw in his wall crawling ability, unique Spidey sense, and fearless web-slinging, and you have the make-up of a character that any kid can admire.  But, outside of being Spider-Man, there has consistently been a soap opera-like appeal to the unique love life of Peter Parker, beginning with his on-again, off-again relationship with that innocent-looking blonde girl &#8211; Gwen Stacy.  But, just when their 1970s romance started to fully blossom, tragedy stuck and ripped it all away.  Now, that fateful moment is in serious danger of repeating itself (in cinematic fashion) during the highly anticipated sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2.Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) returns to the director&#8217;s chair for the comic book sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 &#8211; starring Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy.  Little has changed since we last saw the web-slinger as he continues to thwart the efforts of criminals, while balancing the life of a typical teenager.  However, Peter is still unable to ignore the promise he made to Gwen&#8217;s late father, Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), and struggles with whether or not to maintain a relationship with his high school sweetheart.Meanwhile, an Oscorp electrical scientist, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), has his own struggles &#8211; mainly being treated as an insignificant employee.  However, an unfortunate accident changes everything when he obtains the power to feed off and control electricity.  At the same time, Peter&#8217;s old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns to tend to his ailing father, Norman (Chris Cooper), only to be informed that he too is suffering from the inherited degenerative disease that&#8217;s slowly killing his father.The dark secrets of Oscorp know no bounds, engulfing the lives of not only the Osborn family, but also Peter&#8217;s family, too &#8211; intertwining with the ultimate fate of his parents, Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz).  As Peter continues to dig into the past workings of his father, he eventually learns that the blood of Spider-Man might be the key to saving Harry&#8217;s dwindling health.  Unfortunately for Spider-Man, the duo of new foes, the Green Goblin and Electro, simply decide it&#8217;s easier to take his blood by force &#8211; which could have a devastating impact on the lives of both Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy.In case you didn&#8217;t notice from the synopsis, there&#8217;s a whole lot going on throughout the course of this sequel, though easily highlighted by the wonderful chemistry between the film&#8217;s stars (and real life couple), Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.  Naturally, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy are thrust into an impossible situation that (if you read the comics) led to the heart-wrenching demise of Gwen Stacy (though, you&#8217;ll have to watch the movie to learn Gwen &#8216;s cinematic fate).  Regardless, the complexity of maintaining a relationship is a major part of Spider-Man&#8217;s allure, yet I can&#8217;t help but think that only diehard comic book readers will buy into this film&#8217;s romance between Gwen and Peter, which feels stiffly rushed and occasionally melodramatic.  Still, their struggle between sensibility and love has this comic reader fully invested in their ill-advised passion.Getting back to the acting, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are proving they are each the right choice for their respective roles.  Honestly, Garfield&#8217;s portrayed as Spider-Man is far superior than anything Toby Maguire accomplished with the character, but that&#8217;s not a knock on Toby &#8211; but rather the difference in character development attributed to the scriptwriters.  Although, as enjoyable as Garfield is in the role of Spidey, Emma Stone is relentlessly more delightful and quickly steals his spotlight in each and every scene.  And, while we&#8217;re briefly on the subject of the Sam Raimi trilogy, it should be noted that Dane DeHaan swiftly and superbly removes any remnants of that Franco guy.  Still, whoever takes on the future role of Mary Jane Watson (and it looks as though it will not be Shailene Woodley), they will be hard-pressed to outshine Kirsten Dunst.While Spider-Man receives the greatest amount of attention, the series&#8217; villains garner their own amount of rightful attention.  For fans, The Lizard was a far cry from an outstanding antagonist in the first film, and Jamie Foxx, for all his previous accolades, does little to provide any substantial or additional interest as the superfluous villain, Electro (who&#8217;s origin annoyingly resembles that of The Riddler&#8217;s in Batman Forever).  The insignificance of Electro is pinpointed in the fact that the writers deemed it necessary to add a second villain, the Green Goblin &#8211; who was figuratively abused to no end in the previous trilogy.  Unfortunately, this movie, like an abundance of other superhero films, is burdened with one too many bad guys.  Personally, the Green Goblin could have at least taken on the role of the underutilized Spider-villain, the Hobgoblin.  Instead, he we are helplessly stuck in the middle of another Osborn-centric storyline.Due to the brief incorporation of several new characters (like Paul Giamatti as Rhino and Felicity Jones as Felicia Hardy), along with attempting to find something to do with the old ones (like Sally Field&#8217;s Aunt May), the plot is seriously jumbled at times.  The incorporation of Peter&#8217;s parents is an element that didn&#8217;t necessarily need to be explored again, and their repeated inclusion clearly steals screen time from other noticeably absent supporting characters (it&#8217;s a crime J. Jonah Jameson and the Daily Bugle are nowhere to be found &#8211; other than via email).  Obviously, if the Spider-Man franchise is going to continue down this crowded path, hopefully some of these minor characters are allotted time in the upcoming Spidey spin-offs (reportedly Venom and the Sinister Six, thus far).Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a welcome addition to the franchise.  Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are worth the price of admission alone, plus there are plenty of superhero antics and action sequences to boot.  Sadly, it&#8217;s difficult to escape the sadness that&#8217;s required to make Spider-Man the loveable character we&#8217;ve all come to cherish.  With great power comes great responsibility - a motto that Peter Parker (in comics and on screen) is destined to learn the hard way.  However, the conclusion of this sequel &#8211; for better or worse &#8211; lays the groundwork for future installments, all of which appear to be primed for success.  By no means is this a perfect sequel, and it will rightfully warrant its fair share of complaints, but the positives supremely outweigh the negatives, making this a summer blockbuster that&#8217;s not to be missed.GRADE:  B+FNDNreview.com",5,"'Spidey 2' swings to new heights with stars Garfield, Stone",1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,7200,"['Growing', 'up', 'massive', 'comic', 'book', 'fan',

1696745,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B00JKPHUE0,fsnva,"[1, 8]","I picked up my first Spider-Man comic book many decades ago now, so I have seen more incarnations of the Wall Crawler than I care to count-Todd McFarland's might be my favorite-not to mention reboots, relaunches and countless continuity tweaking.  And that's just in the comics; the movie versions are something else altogether.  I am a real fan of the Sam Raimi/Toby McGuire trilogy (didn't hate the third film, but didn't like it either), but I've grown very partial to the Sony reboot and their take on Spidey, finding a lot to like in this latest version.  THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN set things up with retelling of the origin story where nerdy Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes the title hero, falls in love with Gwen Stacy and battles The Lizard.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 picks up pretty much where the first movie left off, although they do take the time to fill in the back story of Peter's parents and just what his father was doing at Oscorp back in the day.  The second installment is divided between Peter's romance with Gwen, which is haunted by his promise to her late father to keep her safe from his life as Spider-Man, and his battles with three new villains.  A lot has been shoe horned into the second movie and I give director Marc Webb credit for not letting it turn into another BATMAN AND ROBIN and keeping the whole thing coherent.I think the main reason for this is how well the movie gets the characters right: Peter Parker is clearly having a blast being Spider-Man and the way he gets off quips and cracks jokes as he battles criminals is very true to the way Stan Lee and Steve Ditko conceived the character way back in 1962.  In Gwen Stacy he has found the perfect match, both in courage and smarts, and their romance never turns sappy; we care about these kids because they will obviously be happy together; she knows his secret and he can trust her.  Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are terrific in their parts, creating wholly believable heroes.  I give a lot of credit to the film makers for having the guts to stay true to the original Gwen Stacy story line.Then there is the villains; this is the most vital part of any super hero movie, because it just doesn't work if the antagonist is not the equal in strength and power to the hero.  In THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 they stay true to the great Marvel concept of having the bad guy be a flawed individual who often be the victim of a tragic twist of fate or their own bad choices.  That is certainly true of Max Dillon/Electro and Harry Osborn/The Green Goblin, as we get basically get a two in one movie origin story for both of them.  Max, played by Jamie Foxx, is a geeky technician at Oscorp, a pushed around nobody who develops a bad case of hero worship when Spider-Man saves him from being crushed by a car in the opening scene; later Max will fall into a vat of enhanced electric eels and gain the power to command electricity (not to mention turning blue).  In the blink of an eye, this powerless wimp becomes omnipotent and it drives him completely over the edge and into a murderous rage when his former idol appears to turn against him.  The scene where Foxx's Max gives himself a birthday party in his empty apartment is great character defining.Harry Osborn, on the other hand, is the powerful CEO of Oscorp and Peter's former childhood best friend, but he is powerless against a fatally inherited genetic disease and desperate for a cure.  Harry thinks he's found one in Spider-Man's blood, but when Spidey says no to a donation because of the unknown risks, Harry turns to the research of Peter's father (which he enlists the help of Electro to obtain) and injects himself with mutated spider venom, transforming into the Green Goblin.  Feeling betrayed by Spider-Man and Peter, the Goblin sets out to get himself some payback.  Dane DeHann (who was in a decidedly different super hero movie, CHRONICLE)is superb as Harry; if we don't feel sympathy for him, at least we understand where he's coming from and knows he's not just another super villain who is evil just because he's evil.The third villain is Aleksi Sytsevich, the Rhino, played by Paul Giamatti, who basically is in two scenes, but makes the most of them.  Sytsevich is a Russian thug who is causing mayhem in the streets if Manhattan in the film's opening and then returns later in a suit of battle armor.  It's implied that the Rhino will be back in later films, which is good news for us Giamatti fans.The special effects and the battle scenes are everything they need to be in a super hero movie and the throw downs between Spidey and his foes are just what us fans expect: lots of stuff getting broken and lots things going boom.There are lots of nods to the Marvel universe popping up here and there like the Ravenscroft Prison for the Criminally Insane, hints at future appearances by Doc Ock and the Vulture (perhaps in a projected Sinister Six film), Alistair Smythe and Felicia Hardy (The Black Cat) working at Oscorp.  Bit by bit we are getting the Spiderverse; which of course means a returning Sally Field as an Aunt May decidedly not as decrepit as the one in the comics (who somehow survived two dozen heart attacks over the years).THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 has its faults, chief among them is a running time that is just too long by a half hour, and by my count has at least four climatic scenes before it is done.  They also do some tweaking with the characters that might not suit the fanboys. I really did not like it that we're done with Norman Osborn so quickly; in the comics, he is a pivotal villain and it would have been nice to have seen a great actor like Chris Cooper stick around for awhile.But this second movie definitely left me wanting more: where's Flash Thompson?  They simply can't do another Spidey movie without J. Jonah Jameson and the Daily Bugle newsroom.  And what about Mary Jane Watson?  Shailene Woodley is set to play her and actually filmed a few scenes for ASM 2 that were cut.Of course the bigger question is where will the Spider-Man franchise go in the future; ultimately I hope Marvel/Disney will get the rights to Spidey and the X-Men back from Sony and we'll have an Avengers movie that unites all of Marvels great super heroes.  And after that, could we dare hope for an Avengers vs JLA match up on the big screen?

1696746,A28C7103WO6CPD,B00JKPHUE0,Fuinnimh,"[1, 3]","People will agree to disagree or disagree to disagree which is the best Spider Man movie. I will always think of the original Spider Man 2 movie directed by Sam Raimi as the best, Spider Man 3 was a franchise killer necessitating a franchise reboot.Yet Amazing Spidey 2 has several memorable moments, and I think delivers the most shocking and unexpected moment you are likely to see in any Spider Man movie, or perhaps any movie you will see this year, which while it shocked me at the time, in hindsight I applaud as courageous storytelling.Spider Man's lives in a mutant driven world, where someone always seems a careless slip away from becoming a mutant or being killed by one. In this case, a weird electric geek gets a little careless above a pool of electric eels, while Harry Osborne seeks the cure for a fatal inherited disease with a blood sample from our web slinging hero.Meanwhile things get complicated between Spidey and Gwen. It's hard being a superhero balancing your superhero life with your romantic life, when a mutant emergency can call you away at a moment's notice. But our Spidey will always have these dilemmas. If only he did not date someone quite so intelligent, who may be able to get a scholarship to Oxford. Meanwhile, the mystery of what happened to Spidey's own parents continues to trouble him, and why were his fathers studies so dangerous that he had to disappear at a moment's notice leaving little pre Spidey to grow up without a father and troubled by abandonment issues. You will discover the answers to these mysteries when you watch the movie.If Spidey wanted to give it all up for love, would the mutants give up terrorizing New York City. Not for a New York minute. You see the difficulty, the work of a superhero never ends. Just when you think you're out, they pull you back in. And when your friends become mutants, with the added risk of suspecting or even guessing your identity, that can put you and your girlfriend Gwen in a whole stew of trouble. These dilemmas preoccupy our web slinging friend. And what do you when your girlfriend has had enough, and tells you to sling it.And some people think you are more of a nuisance than a hero, unless there's a crisis, and then who do they want. People can be so fickle about their superheroes. And when one crisis is contained another emerges. Such are the vicissitudes of a superheroes life.You see Spidey alone of all the mutants uses his new abilities for good, while others are simply insane, or have an agenda that brings them into direct confrontation with Spider Man. No one can doubt Spidey's courage or determination, but even a superhero has his limits.I enjoyed the performances in the movie, particularly Emma Stone as Gwen. I don't know if I have her enthusiasm for Andrew Garfield who she proclaims the best actor on the planet. She might be a little biased. I found Electro was an interesting villain, and I could even see how he might defeat Spidey, but in the end what I will remember most is that surprising moment which seemed to go on forever. At one point I had a slight sense of vertigo as Spidey plunged from a tall building.If you're like me you may discover love is harder than you think, relationships are hard, they take work, sometimes love isn't enough and that it's dangerous to think you can contain a mutant menace, and you never know the next place a mutant is going to morph out of.My one beef with Spidey as with many Marvel movies is the essentially cookie cutter approach to the story, with the obligatory story arc with extended action and special effects which for me can get a little formulaic, although I have to admitIron Man 2 was amazing, in this case the wit and charm of Robert Downey ttanscends the other elements.I cannot guarantee you will like this more than other Spidey movies but I do think they are all better than that nadir Spider Man 3, which almost made me give up watching Spidey movies entirely. It's difficult to know where the Spidey franchise goes from here.

But before i begin i will say that the amazing spiderman 2 was a little step up from the first one, that being that the costume in this movie was much better and the movie was much less dark in trying to incorporate that dark knight feel but unfortunately was the only good things about this movie.The amazing spiderman 2 is definitely in the list of the worst comic book movies ever to transition to the silver screen, most of the time i felt like i was watching a video game and NOT an actual movie. It's simply laughable and just down right stupid in most parts. The main villain electro played by jamie foxx was just horrendous to say the least, why o why did they cast this guy ? not to say that jamie foxx is a bad actor, he was just totally wrong for this role. Electro is one of spiderman's MOST feared and powerful villains and they casted a comedian, mark webb totally made a grave error in casting in general. Whether or not people even wanna admit it the amazing spiderman 2 also branched of sam raimi's spideman 3 by having to much going on. Which means there was very little chance for story which in turn made this film convoluted. This movie overall was just terrible, horrible actors, wasted and unused villains that serve no purpose, terrible sequence and a shi**y dialogue.

1696749,A1XJWXF9LDFSL0,B00JKPHUE0,Hwang,"[8, 19]","As a child, I have always been a fan of Marvel comic creations such as Conan, Kull, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Ka-zar, Dr. Strange, Dracula, Satana, and Son of Satan, however, I have never liked the general fodder among comicdom fans from D.C. such as Superman, Green Lantern and Tarzan, any more than I acceptable popular icons from Marvel such as Batman, Spiderman, Daredevil, X-men or Fantastic Four; with that being said, I, nevertheless, religiously patronized all Hollywood adaptations of comic books on the hope that, being block buster movies, that they will be sufficiently reinvented as to be interesting, entertaining and enjoyable on the big screen, only to find a mixed batch that varies from the brilliantly imaginative and engrossing - such as The Amazing Spider Man, Man of Steel and The Avengers, to the disappointing and uninspired such as The Superman quad ology, Superman Returns, The Batman trilogy - save for The Dark Knight (which was passable), The Spiderman trilogy - save for Spiderman (which was mediocre), The Ironman trilogy - save for Ironman (which was better than expected), Daredevil (which I hated), Green Lantern (which was slightly above average), The Hulk franchise - which I never fancied save for The Incredible Hulk - featuring one of my childhood idols, Lou Ferrigno, The X-man franchise - save for X-man First Class and Wolverine ( which were better than average), and The Fantastic Four trilogy - save for Fantastic Four (which was okay).Having said that, The Amazing Spiderman blew me away with an engrossing narrative featuring one of the best screenplays ever written for Marvel adaptations, well developed and endearing characters - played dramatically well by Andrew Garfield and the gorgeous Emma Stone (who will literally take your breath away), interesting and convincing dialog (tete-a-tete) between the characters, an engrossing storyline that will serve well as escapism and make you forget all your problems for the duration of the movie, fantastic Spiderman costume design - which constitutes the best ever featured in a movie, great cinematography, impeccable editing and use of trajectory in film, well developed pace, great soundtrack and unobtrusive incorporation of music to enhance the visual aspects of the movie, and, best of all, the best web-swinging action ever captured on film - courtesy of great stunt work and awe-inspiring CGI from Sony's Imagework, which I believe will be a force to be reckoned with in the field of special effects in the foreseeable future, as well as the best 3D generated effects since Avatar.So, when the sequel to the Amazing Spiderman, The Amazing Spiderman - Rise of Electro, was officially launched in Malaysian cinemas, I was among the first to catch it in 3D, only to leave the theatre with mixed feelings regarding the movie - in part, pacified but predominantly greatly disappointed, given the fact that the movie showed incredible promise during the first half of the feature film - with apt performances by Andrew Garfield and the ever gorgeous Emma Stone, an interesting storyline - that is only marred by the slight digression incorporating an annoying regurgitation of the plot in the first movie and the irritating and somewhat superfluous dwelling on Peter Parker's father's past that serve only to detract from the main plot, the ever endearing characters that elicit empathy from the audience, the well written screenplay that managed to create an engrossing film, awe-inspiring CGI from Imagework and fantastic action sequences that thrill and excite, which transforms into a big let-down upon the introduction of Electro, played by the ever annoying Jamie Foxx - whose character appeared somewhat one-dimensional and unconvincing, and, upon his transformation into Electro, witnessing CGI that appear unrealistic and overblown and, that rather enhancing the action sequences only serve to despoil the thrill generated during the first half of the movie, coupled with the fact that neither the costume design for Electro and the Hob Goblin nor the transformer-like suit for the Rhino were anywhere near inspiring, the incontrovertible fact that all three of Spidey's nemesis were too easily defeated in what constitutes anti-climactic fight sequences, and that the story begins to replicate the formula for part one during the second half with Gwen attempting to convince Peter Parker to accept her assistance and, eventually, prevailing.The sequel appears to be the fledging and misdirected attempt by Marc Webb to introduce new villains whom he can spin off for future instalments, in the hope of generating more revenue for Sony Pictures and Columbia.",2,Disappointing

1696750,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00JKPHUE0,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 23]","Marc Webb's AMAZING SPIDER-MAN films thus far have depended upon eye-blistering spectacle and the charm of its two leads together. I don't want to turn this into another Raimi vs Webb tirade, but the thing that Raimi's first two SPIDER-MAN films got right was that storytelling is important, but even more important is allowing a plot to grow from the characters and not the other way around. Everyone knows that Raimi's third entry is a huge mess, but the less said about that, the better. He and the writers of those films, though, did know how to condense time and expand the universe more efficiently as well. In the first film, Peter goes from high school student to collegian in about an hour, and we also get a larger world with his introduction to The Daily Bugle as well as Oscorp.Okay, enough. I could go on and on. But let's get back to this mess. This film is, more than anything, an exercise on showcasing state-of-the-art CG effects as well as the opportunity to expand the Spider-verse since we already know that Sony/Columbia intends to create a film around the character of Venom as well as a Sinister Six film that will feature other villains such as The Vulture, a new Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter and more hinted at throughout this film. Unfortunately, this film doesn't seem to learn anything from its predecessor. Again, a lot of the action takes place at night, and gives the film too dark an aesthetic for a Spider-Man film. He's a colorful, quippy guy and more opportunity should be given to show him bathed in light. No matter how dark the content was in MAN OF STEEL, at least Zack Snyder rarely showed Superman in darkness.Everyone really knows the plot of this film already, but I want to concentrate on the characters in the film. Easily the best work in the film goes to Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, despite the fact that he already played this role in CHRONICLE, but since he was so great in that, it would stand to reason that him playing a young man feeling marginalized or ignored by his friend who suddenly gets more power than he should is right in his wheelhouse. Jamie Foxx... he's rarely ever good, and while he was fine in DJANGO UNCHAINED, and the idea that Max Dillon is more of a Rupert Pupkin deranged-fan character was an interesting tack taken by mega-hit writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (some of the TRANSFORMERS films, the rebooted STAR TREK films). However, Foxx plays him with no urgency and an almost campy take on a comic-book villain, speaking in hushed stage-whispery tones that suggest that Foxx knows he's playing a comic-book villain and wants to talk like one, but in real life. The best actors in the film, though, are the most marginalized. Sally Field as Aunt May, Paul Giamatti as The Rhino, and Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn all have far too little to do. As an on-screen couple, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are adorable. They have the right chemistry and the right energy, particularly for this type of film, but their roles are sadly either underwritten (Stone) or overwritten (Garfield). Seriously, to have Gwen Stacy giving her high-school graduation speech, talking about how short life is... that's just FAR too much foreshadowing. And Peter Parker, well, he's just a HUGE jerk.The lesson that Peter was SUPPOSED to learn is with great power comes great responsibility. This film displays that with great power comes just being great. Peter LOVES being Spider-Man in this film. It's a real thrill for him. And as much as I can admire people trying to do things a bit differently with a character, Peter is just way too happy being Spider-Man. Responsibility is a BURDEN, not a kid with a new toy. He actually shirks away from responsibility every chance he gets and then gets away with a lot of it because Spider-Man is cool. He's a jerk to his grieving aunt, he's a jerk to his ailing best friend, he's a jerk to everyone. But the film's plot allows enough contrivances that he can walk away not being a jerk, because Spider-Man is supposed to be cool.Here's the problem: While Spider-Man IS cool, Peter Parker is NOT. Peter is awkward, geeky, put upon, and in a constant spiral of not getting what he wants even if he might deserve it. He's broke. He comes from a home that's not taking in enough money. His jobs are low-paying and it puts even more pressure on him. He knows that he has to help people, but he also knows that helping those other people might prevent him from helping himself. This is something that the the Raimi films understood INCREDIBLY well, but these films do not. In the first film, I thought that some of Peter's decisions could have been jerky due to his teen angst. In this film, though, he seems angst-free. He's defied the dying wishes of a man that was a true hero so that he could be with his true love, and that costs him. But that never really seems to come back up on him, other than through a passage-of-time montage. It reinforces the idea that nothing in this world is EARNED, not even the consequences of death. People make fun of Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter as a huge cry-baby, but very little noise is made about Garfield SHOULD be crying but is too busy being a jerk.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 leaves you feeling like you should be sad, because what happens in the film is tragic, but it only seems to happen because it happened in the comics, and therefore doesn't stick the landing (no pun intended). I know that might seem like a hypocritical statement since I've just lamented how much stuff that's in the comics isn't present here at all, but this major event that happens in this film really only happens because Spider-Man fans know it's supposed to happen and not because it SHOULD happen. I will NOT be seeing the third film, mostly because I have no faith that Webb, Garfield and Orci/Kurtzman can construct a good Spider-Man film. However, I will be in line to see the SINISTER SIX film. Why? Because Drew Goddard, that's why.",2,Peter Parker is a jerk.

And of course, our favorite guy is the one to confront them and save the world. This sequel is bigger, louder, with more vehicular mayhem and endless blowie uppie stuff, which is too bad, because this cast has skillful actors who can do anything. Watch for the lengthy scene with Peter and Aunt May; they are both terrific!We have:* Andrew Garfield (&#34;Never Let Me Go&#34;) is Spider-Man/Peter Parker, the guy we just like. He's really dorky and his shy affection for Gwen is very effective.* Emma Stone (&#34;The Help&#34;) is Gwen Stacy, his steadfast girlfriend, in on his secret identity and smart as a whip; but we have to remember, Peter had promised her father he would stay away from her...* Jamie Foxx (&#34;Django Unchained&#34;) is Electro/Max Dillon, the nerdy guy everyone overlooks...even on his birthday. Finally, he gets MAD!* Dane DeHaan (&#34;In Treatment&#34;) plays Green Goblin/Harry Osborn, once a close friend of Peter's, soon to become a sworn enemy. Their fathers were fellow scientists working on that experimental spider serum.* Sally Field (&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34;) returns as Aunt May, who can't help but worry about her sweet nephew because he persists in asking questions about his parents.In this one we learn more about Peter's father, which is a welcome addition, and the relationship between Peter and Gwen is easy and fun. Another plus, this had more humor, with one-liners and goofy physical comedy. The late-in-the-movie evolution of Harry Osborne to Green Goblin is nothing but a prequel to the next movie.To me, this felt like three movies...1) a nice PG-13 movie for Spider-Man fans, 2) an overwhelming eyeful for lovers of CGI, and 3) that aforementioned prequel. I enjoyed it, but found myself yawning during the lengthy scenes in which Midtown Manhattan is demolished. The screening version I saw was in 3D, so I dutifully ducked from flying debris and marveled at a snowfall.

One framed shot in particular had me exclaiming out loud.This time around Garfield gives us an angsty and partly stupid Peter Parker which once again grated, but Emma Stone and Sally Field excelled despite the quality of the script.The decision to add new aspects to the origin story felt completely unnecessary and, if anything, reduced the impact of the iconic Uncle Ben (not to mention stretching the very limits of credibility).

1696755,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00JKPHUE0,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[7, 18]","Amazing Spider-Man 2 is about Peter (Andrew Garfield) trying to date Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) despite Captain Stacey asking him not to. The image of Gwen's dad everywhere he goes and the promise he made; hurts their relationship. The fact that she might go to a University in England doesn't help.While Peter's old friend Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) finds he has a genetically passed disease and wants Peter to get Spider-man's blood for a cure. And of course you have Max Dillion (Jamie Foxx) who worships Spider-Man. When he becomes Electro after a lab accident; anger fills him that he's hated and not loved like Spider-Man. So he becomes a super-villain of course.That's about it story wise. It's not the strongest script ever but Peter and Gwen is a much stronger relationship than Peter and MJ in all 3 Raimi films. When Peter and Gwen argue, it makes sense. Gwen isn't just being a jealous you know what; like MJ in Spider-man 3. While DeHaan is a much better Harry Osborne than James Franco. And Jamie Foxx really sucks in the beginning as Max Dillion but makes a pretty menacing and awesome Electro.I just felt the film was overly hokey at times with some bad pacing. For instance after a fight with Electro, Peter suddenly finds it's time to do research about his father's death again. Oh and Dillion being a nerd who's a fan of the hero but turns bad when he feels betrayed by that hero is cliche. We already saw that in Batman Forever and Iron Man 3.Last but not least, a Spider-Man film is missing part of it's soul with no Jonah Jameson!  We just hear Peter talk about pictures he has taken. JJ himself could have been used for comic relief. Still, I'd recommend Amazing Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man 3 any day!

1696757,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00JKPHUE0,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 4]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Just as some reviewers disapproved of a perceived erratic, unfocused, villain-heavy plot structure in Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman 3"", I suspect a similar charge has been leveled against Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" (hereafter ""AmSp2"").  It's a legitimate criticism, I suppose, which I happen to respectfully disagree with in both movies.  Yes, numerous plot threads have been spun out in ""AmSp2"", with Oscorp at the center of all:1)  Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy's (Emma Stone's) high school graduations and tumultuous,  rocky romance, and Gwen's Oxford College prospects, complicated by Peter's/Spiderman's promise to Gwen's deceased father, Police Chief George Stacy (Denis Leary) to stay away from his daughter, for her own good.2)  More revelation of Peter's parents', especially his father Richard Parker's (Campbell Scott) mysterious link with and scientific research for Oscorp and the purpose of that research, and whether Richard is an American traitor or not.3)  The transformation of geeky, overlooked Oscorp electric engineer Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into supremely powerful, embittered, and vengeful electricity master Electro.4)  The business, personal, and medical dilemma of Oscorp heir and Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who seeks Spiderman's spider-serum blood to reverse a genetic disorder and gradually transforms into the supremely powerful, embittered, and vengeful Green Goblin.5)  Peter's efforts to live as normal a life as a superhero can, without his Aunt May (Sally Field) discovering her secret, while in turn Aunt May tries to keep her moonlighting stint as a nurse's aide to help pay Peter's college tuition a secret from him as long as possible.6)  Oh, yes, the transformation of flamboyant Russian mobster Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) into the Rhino (or more appropriately, Iron Rhino Man Tank) after Spidey thwarts his plutonium theft from, apparently, yes, Oscorp.7)  Peter's methodical efforts to untangle, solve, and resolve the six previous plot threads, even drawing an elaborate map on his bedroom wall to link things up.So, yeah, I guess you can argue ""AnSp 2"" is busy, overplotted, and too reliant upon soap-opera coincidences and melodrama.  And yet, I think that is part of the movie's charm.  ""AmSp2"" reflects just that soap opera charm that made the various Spidey comic permutations so popular and memorable.  Also, that charm elevates the movie above simply an exclusive and eventually tiresome hero/villain slugfest.For example, no doubt, the Spidey/Electro and Spidey/Green Goblin battles are energetic and suspenseful.  But they also illustrate a specific interconnectedness between Spidey and his enemies.  In a way, these villains are dopplegangers or distorted reflections of Spider-man, put-upon, neglected, tormented, ultimately sympathetic souls suddenly gifted with enormous powers, except of course they use their powers for evil.  But consider, there but for the grace of Uncle Ben/Aunt May would go Spidey.  In other words, Uncle Ben's/Aunt May's love and care of Peter have helped keep Peter from going similarly astray.  Furthermore, he does not necessarily get full satisfaction from defeating them.As another example, Spider-man does not monopolize ""AmSp 2"". As in the first ""Amazing Spiderman movie"" Peter Parker and his compassion, sense of duty, scientific ability, and deductive reasoning get at least as much attention as his alter-ego.  He does his best to protect the people he cares for and loves and balance his normal, everyday tasks with his superhero crimefighting.  Spiderman may not always succeed and may suffer another personal tragic loss, as in his climactic encounter with the crazed Green Goblin, but he always finds the courage and spiritual strength to honor the memories of the fallen by carrying on, as alluded to in Gwen Stacy's inspirational valedictory speech.Therefore, even in Spider-man's fantastic, intertwined world of sinister CEOs, unscrupulous ""Kafkaesque"" scientists, genetic manipulation, and power-hungry supervillians in ""AmSp2"", there is still room to remind the viewer that we all have the power (super or not) to find hope to keep on living, keep on hoping, and keep on making a positive difference in people's lives.

But few movies are.&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; is just plain boring.  I lost count of how many times I squirmed in my seat, just praying it would end.  The film could benefit from some serious editing -- lose about 40 minutes of running time and MAYBE it will be tolerable.Three, count 'em, THREE villains in this film.  The one that appears first (and also last) can be taken out of the film completely and you'd never miss him.  The primary villain is Electro, but you don't really root against this guy so much as stare at him in confusion.  It's hard to grasp why he's so heck-bent on killing Spidey.  The motivation he is given in the script is very, very feeble.I don't know anyone who really cares that much about Peter Parker's birth parents or how they died.  Yet the two of them get a very long and absurdly Jason Bourne-esque action setpiece near the beginning of the film.  It feels tacked-on and unnecessary.And Sally Field as Aunt May is given way more to do than her character's presence calls for.  You just gotta see it to believe how absurd it is.The script is long, unfocused, and feels like it was written by committee.  There's very little natural flow to the story.

Just like the first one, this movie includes false advertising. Much of what was shown in the trailers wasn't in the final cut of the film.

1696760,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00JKPHUE0,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[9, 18]","I honestly didn't expect much from this movie. I thought the first Amazing Spider Man was incredibly average and with all the trailers, promotions, sneak peeks, etc I felt like I already saw a fourth of the movie. You don't build excitement for a movie by giving it all away in the previews, you build it by keeping most of the movie in the dark and leaving your potential audience guessing. More is not always better. More is, in fact, quite often worse. A good marketing campaign doesn't tire you out before actually seeing the movie. Sure I wanted to see it, but I was very cautious about getting my hopes up.It's been a few years since the events of the firs Amazing Spider man, and New York has really opened up to their friendly neighborhood Spider Man. Though we're treated to the by now clich&eacute; comments about vigilante justice, and their role in society (groan) for the most part people appreciate a hero doing the job the police are too stupid, it seems, to do themselves. Peter Parkers love life is also on solid grounds as he's started dating Gwyn Stacy again, despite his promise to her father not to do that. Overall things seem to be going pretty well for the web swinger. He even gets to save Jami Fox and stop some criminals from stealing plutonium. That must have been pretty cool.Okay, so first let me tell you what I liked about this movie. First off, I don't think there's any doubt about who is the superior Spider Man now. I loved the original Tobey Maguire movies (well, the first two at least) but Andrew Garfield blows him out of the water with his performance. He is absolutely amazing as both Spider Man, and as Parker. His sarcastic and good natured super hero persona is funny as hell and brings the character from the comics and old TV show to life perfectly. The original trilogy never got that part right, so I'm happy to see this new series decided to stay truer to the character. Parker, likewise, spends a fair amount of time agonizing over the preventable death of Gwyn Stacy's father and blaming himself for what happened. Though there were quite a few times when the script and directing really let him down Garfield delivered a believable character anyway. Even his ""cry face"" is better than Maguire's. Really though, all of the cast delivered solid performances. Emma Stone again gave us all a believable and relatable Gwyn Stacy while Dane DeHaan was brilliant as Harry Osborne. Even Jami Fox had a good performance, though I mostly hated his character, but more on that later.Second, the special effects and most of the action is very well done. This wasn't a surprise, of course, as we've seen a TON of it in the trailers already. The film looks amazing from opening shot to the end. And that ending, God that was a good ending. This is a spoiler free review, so no worries, but I will say that for a film that's mostly light hearted fun they really managed to bring it back to earth with a final that's both shocking (for those not familiar with Spider Man lore at least) and emotional. It took a lot of guts to do what they did, so for that I salute you Marc Webb.It was also great to see that the trailer was mostly misleading. I know that sounds like it should be a negative but here me out. I really thought this movie was going to seem crowded in the same way Spider Man 3 was crowded. We already had Electro taking up screen time, but then we also had Green Goblin and Rhino making an appearance as well. Not only that but it was also hinted that maybe Vulture and Dr. Octopus would show up at some point. Well let me put that fear to rest. We do get three villains here, but only one has any sort of screen time, so it never felt crowded. One villain per movie I always say. Very few films can get away with more than that.The problems for this film come mostly from the conflicting tones within it. Most super hero films fall into one of two categories; the dark brooding serious film like The Dark Knight and The Winter Soldier, or the light hearted good natured action romp, like The Avengers and the first Iron Man. Either their gritty and realistic, or fantastic and family friendly. Neither is better than the other, it all just depends on the tone the director wants to set. Problems arise, however, when you try to mix the two together. Surly The Dark Knight wouldn't have been the same with the added ingredients of slapstick comedy and ""will they won't they"" teenage puppy love anymore then The Avengers would have benefited from torture, brutal death scenes, and completely over the top conspiracy theories. The Amazing Spider Man 2 tries to do all these things at once and ends up coming out as a big fat sloppy mess. It at times wants me to take it seriously, then changes course and turns into a feel good super hero romp, and then switches again to dark and dreary. There's a very inconsistent tone and theme here which just left me confused and conflicted. It doesn't help that the music they scored for this film is so awful and distracting that I wished they would turn it off. It's not that I didn't like its individual pieces, but they just don't go together all that well. The pieces are greater than the finished product, which is a shame because I do think that with better editing this could have been a far better movie.Another point of contention for me was the character of Max Dillon, played by Jami Fox. Now I loved Electro, I thought he was an excellent villain AFTER he ditched his old shelf and gave in complexity to his new persona, but I didn't like him as Max. For one his character motivation is just so ridiculous and stupid I couldn't take him seriously at all. For most of the film I thought he was mentally handicapped, maybe suffering from Asperger's or another form of autism, but by the end of the film he'd dropped that completely. Turns out he was just a socially awkward looser the whole time. It could have been pretty interesting had he been slightly mentally handicapped. Could have brought up an intriguing dilemma, but nope he's just a looser and hates Spider Man for... taking the spotlight away from him? Spraying him with water? Not remembering his name? I... I don't know, and nor do I care. He's just not a compelling character. He's a compelling villain, sure, with his Dr. Manhattaning and all that, but a lame character.I really wish Sony would give Spider Man back to Marvel. I have no doubt that if the web slinger was allowed to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe we would get a film to rival the original Spider Man 2 (still my favorite SM movie to date) and would eventually see what we've all want; Spider Man teaming up with The Avengers. Is that going to happen? Probably not, though the end credits scene provides some interesting possibilities for an alternative cross over. Not the cross over I want, God no, but an interesting one non the less.",3,The Average Spider Man.,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,6874,"['honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'thought',

1696761,A24UPY3K2IMZYV,B00JKPHUE0,Joseph Elliott,"[6, 12]","Its been days since I saw The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I've felt a nagging to go see it again. I haven't had that much fun with a summer blockbuster movie in a long time. I grew up on Raimi's Spider-Man movies, so when the first Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, I wasn't very happy with it. It retread old ground, had a weak villain, and just wasn't much fun. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a huge improvement, taking the groundwork of the first film and taking it in an exciting new direction that differs from Raimi's Spiderman. And as much sentimental value as Maguire's Peter Parker has for me, Garfield, objectively speaking, does a better job with the role. Its odd to watch something you love be surpassed and outdone. Other than Spider-Man 2, this is the best movie in the franchise to date. It has a lot of flaws, namely that its just a bit overstuffed; there's too many plot threads and characters that the movie is trying to develop and resolve. There's also some abrupt tonal shifts, but all of the individual scenes are executed well, and the movie just has this infectious, giddy sense of fun about it. I found it to be such a pleasant movie-going experience that its problems really didn't bug me. Nowadays, superhero movies have the misfortune of being compared to Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, which are excellent films, but are on a different level of film-making entirely. They are the superhero films from the skeptical adult's perspective; examining the very idea of the superhero and making an argument for superheroes being a bad thing and making matters worse. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the superhero movie you would have wanted to see as a kid. Its amusingly campy and ridiculous (Jamie Fox's Electro is so over the top its hilarious), the action scenes are exhilarating, and the drama is solid, considering what it could have been in a movie such as this.  If you can take it for what it is, its a blast. If you're looking for The Dark Knight, then steer clear of it; it doesn't reinvent the wheel.

1696762,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00JKPHUE0,Josh,"[8, 16]","I have many favorite heroes, on both (Marvel and DC respectively) but if anyone was to ask who my favorite Marvel property is, then my answer would be Spider-Man. From my younger days,  I can remember the first time seeing Spider-Man as a child on television. And from then on, I was immediately hooked. Sure there were Power Rangers, Catdog, and shows of that nature but few have caught my attention the way the character of  Spider-Man has. Not surprisingly, my very first comic book was a Spider-Man comic; and after that you can imagine where my allowance would be spent. Spider-Man is just a significantly inspiring character in my opinion. If you have seen my review for The Amazing Spider-Man you know how I feel about that particular movie, with all due respect to Sam Raimi's original trilogy. And after the long wait, here is my review on The Amazing Spider Man 2.As our movie begins, we see Peter's father Richard Parker in a flashback and Richard is recording a message in detail about why certain things are the way they are;  soon he and wife Mary Parker board a plane where danger is lurking. Now fast-forward a spider bite and a red and blue suit later, Peter  is living a double life as a boyfriend and nephew to his Aunt May, all the while protecting the citizens of New York. In one instance Spider-Man happens upon Max Dillon who secretly has an obsession with Spidey. After an accident gone horribly wrong at (where else?) Oscorp, Max Dillon is no longer who he was before. Electro is born, and so begins our movie.I gotta say this was one of those films I monitored even the tiniest details and rumor mills on. From Dane Dehaan(I'll get to him in a minute) being cast as Harry Osborn, Jamie Foxx being cast as Electro, and other actors/actresses being cast; I was absolutely puzzled/clueless at  how this was all gonna turn out. I trusted Marc Webb after the first film, but I definitely had some doubts.It is safe to say that for now, there is no other clear cut choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was extraordinary once again as Spidey; in my opinion he improved even more. He has always reminded me of the Ultimate version of the character. The humor, the cleverness, and the overall attiude he brought in the 2012 movie is substantially better this time around. And how about Emma Stone you might ask? Well she was just as good! She definitely knows the character of Gwen Stacey. Jamie Foxx did good in his role as Max Dillon/Electro; he brought a kind of odd somberness to the character and it worked. Chris Cooper was one of the unexpected casting choices to the movie, but he did well enough as Norman Osborn, for me to not be disappointed. And as for Dane Dehaan,  he steals the show as Harry Osborn. He portrays Harry in the darkest light, and I gotta say each time I see Dane Dehaan I get more and more good vibes from his acting and definitely no shortage here.  The Effects are nicely improved this time around, and while another popular rumor was that Hans Zimmer would score the film; I had no idea how well he would do it but during the movie I quickly found out.  The music that is present during the movie goes in great with each sequence. Once again, chemistry is a worthwhile experience as Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone set sparks while having quite a few aww filled moments. As for the script, well there is a lot of good detail in the story. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is definitely more emotion ridden than the previous movie; I enjoyed how Peter acknowledged the fact that he made a promise to Captain Stacy in the first film. I also like how they re visited the mystery behind Peter's parents as well.Now I don't like talking bad about something but when it comes to movies, even the ones I enjoy or am overly hyped about; but I do feel the need to discuss them. There are a FEW times where certain scenes happen too quickly and I feel that more time was needed for those scenes to develop more. And much to my surprise, Paul Giamatti who is not a bad actor, I feel did not do justice to my favorite Spider-Man villain Rhino. His portrayal just did not excite me the way I had hoped. For everyone else it may or may not be that big of a deal but if he returns, I personally hope he has more of a backstory or a more brute force to the character. There are many people (a few of those people I am friends with actually) who have no interest in seeing this movie mainly because of the dislike of the first installment, and some just do not want to see it. I understand and see some of the criticisms and similarites between the two (Raimi vs Webb). And as a Spider-Man fan I say this: just give the movie a chance. I enjoyed the film for the most part. As a movie it does have its problems, but interestingly enough, Marc Webb leaves us with more unanswered questions like: Who is this mysteriously attractive Felicia? Who is the guy in the hat? And where does our hero go after this adventurous journey? While It may not be the amazing improvement I thought it would be, I rate The Amazing Spider-Man 2:7.7/10Rated PG-13Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane Dehaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti, Chris Cooper, Felicity Jones, Sally Field,",4,"Yes it does have its problems, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not a bad sequel",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,5202,"['have', 'many', 'favorite', 'heroes',

1696763,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00JKPHUE0,J. Richardson,"[8, 14]","When it was first announced that the Spider-Man franchise was getting a reboot after Sam Raimi's trilogy, I approached the first film with a hesitant interest. Raimi's set of films was not perfect by any means, and they arguably did more things wrong than right, but Tobey Maguire was an enjoyable enough Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and I had a hard time envisioning ""that kid from The Social Network"" playing the part. However, after witnessing Webb's take on the classic character, I was pleasantly surprised with how well it turned out, and I eagerly anticipated the sequel.Unfortunately, this anticipation began to wane as the details of the next film started getting announced. A blue Electro? Jamie Foxx? A Rhino who resembles a Transformer more than the actual character? Paul Giamatti? They're seriously trying the ""three villain"" thing again? It appeared they were doing everything wrong, and I honestly didn't want any part of it. I knew I was still going to see it, though (it was a new Spider-Man movie, after all). The only difference was I wasn't going opening night/weekend, and I wasn't excited. At all.Surprise surprise, this latest installment in Webb's universe pretty much failed in all the categories I expected it to. What I didn't expect, however, was the way it redeemed itself in other areas of the film. Yes, Electro looks like a cross between Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze and Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, and Foxx's performance is as stiff as cardboard, but the writers absolutely nailed Spider-Man's personality. This was something they dabbled with a little bit in the first film, but they went all out this time around.I can honestly say we finally have a Spidey on screen who embraces the webslinger's humor. I'm not talking one or two jokes here and there, either. I'm talking about 140 minutes of consistent laughs. From start to finish, there is an endless barrage of jokes from your friendly neighborhood arachnid, and I was relishing in their inherent corny-ness. Because, come on, Spider-Man isn't suppose to have the ""best jokes."" They need to be cheesy, and I'm glad a team of writers were finally able to properly execute this aspect of his personality.The success of Spider-Man as a character also comes from Andrew Garfield's performance, as well. I had some issues with certain areas of his portrayal/performance of Peter in the first film--certain things were out of his hands, of course--but he really stepped his game up and found his groove. He's erratic and quirky, but he manages to pull it off without looking like he's trying too hard. He's no longer trying to be Peter Parker, he kind of just is. His performance is arguably more fluid this time around, which helps authenticate some of the more emotional scenes in the film.Some other highlights include the romantic chemistry between Garfield and Stone, and Dane DeHaan's portrayal of Harry Osborn. After watching the real-life couple on screen together, I am thoroughly convinced that all on-screen couples should be played by couples in real life. It brings an entirely new dynamic to the performances, and the actors don't have to convince the audience that their characters are in love because the actors themselves are in love. It makes the relationship between Gwen and Peter all the more genuine, and the film benefits greatly because of it.Of course, it would be a crime to go through this entire review without at least mentioning DeHaan because he exceeded any and all expectations I had for his performance. This man is quickly becoming a favorite of mine because he really submerges himself into his characters, and he continued this trend with his performance as Harry. Although he may not look like Harry Osborn from an aesthetic perspective, he nails his personality in ways Franco could only dream of. It is made 100% clear that he despises his father, and as the film progress, and Harry starts losing it, DeHaan's wonderful acting truly comes into play.Unfortunately, in addition to all of the negative points listed above, all of these great elements are weighed down by a huge flaw: the film is too content heavy. This is not to say it is hard to follow along with what's going on, but it did reach a point where I felt like there was just too much to digest at once. There were four or five different plot lines in the story, there was a constant tonal shift between what was going on with Max/Electro and what was going on with Harry, there were Peter's relationship issues, Peter searching for the truth about his parents. It never stopped. They could have easily split this into two coherent films, instead of one onslaught of information.Some last minute inclusions: I was glad that Webb didn't include any of the weird POV shots that were found in the first film, and I loved the new suit. These were two of my biggest complaints with his first offering, so I was more than happy to see these minor details addressed in the sequel. Also, for the most part, the cinematography is beautiful. There was a fight scene in the beginning that had some nauseating shaky cam, and the scene where Harry transforms into the Green Goblin has some terrible lighting, but other than that, the set pieces, action sequences, and CGI are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also a lot of fun to watch.Overall Score: 6.8/10 - Let me make one thing clear: I wanted to like this movie. I may have went in with low expectations, but this is still Spider-Man, so I didn't want to hate it. To be perfectly honest, I don't. I may not feel like this was a proper follow-up to its predecessor, but I certainly don't hate it. I will watch it again, and I will buy it on Blu-Ray, but this is more of a testament of me as a fan, and not of the quality of the film itself. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does a lot of things right, this is true, but for every accomplishment there is an accompanying failure, and the film as a whole suffers because of it.",3,6.8/10 - An

1696764,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00JKPHUE0,judy,"[2, 6]","Go Spidey Go! This was my most anticipated film of the summer and probably of the year. And I'm not going to lie when I tell you I was let down. As I write this, I have seen a total of four films that have been released this year. Each of which received a rating of 3 stars or below, and that is not good. I was highly surprised when I saw the reviews of 'Amazing Spiderman 2' clocked in at a mediocre 2.5 rating out of a possible 5.0 star rating. That's about average. I thought this was going to be better, and while I won't say it was that mediocre it was certainly a step down from the much superior 'Amazing Spiderman' as well as the original trilogy. My review of 'The Amazing Spiderman 2'.'The Amazing Spiderman 2' follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) who after the events of 'Amazing Spiderman' struggles to discover the mystery of his mother and father's disappearance as well as his ever growing love for Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). But when an old friend arrives (Dane DeHaan) as well as a spider obsessive (Jamie Foxx) who's horrible accident causes him to become a electricity charged super villain who calls himself Electro, come into town it is up to Spiderman to save the day!So much happens in Amazing Spiderman 2, it is hard to compress a summary f it all for you guys, without spoiling anything. With all this stuff going on, it's hard to focus on anything. Beside's that sub plot with Peter Parker's father and mother, we also have a subplot with Oscorp, a subplot with 'Dane DeHaan', a subplot with Garfield and Stone, a subplot with 'Sally Field', a subplot with 'Jamie Foxx', a subplot with Ravencroft Institute.... TO MANY SUBPLOTS. And to top it off we have the main plot which is on Spiderman fighting villains! Director 'Marc Webb' tries's to cram so much story into a 2 and a half hour film it's hard to comprehend or become attached to anything.While we're talking about overstuffing with plot, let's get to the overstuffing of characters. There are WAY too many characters in this. The film tries to stuff all of 'Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborne's character development into one film and it doesn't work. Not to mention with all these characters it's hard to focus on who's the main one. Jamie Foxx's Electro is supposed to be the main villain yet he gets lost among the characters, and becomes sort of just there. Unlike in the first film, Gwen Stacy is just there. All she is meant to do, is walk around and say 'I can't be with you Peter' or 'I love the real you Peter'. It's upsetting as Emma Stone truly is a gifted actress, but her character got side-saddled to suit the large ensemble of characters. Don't even get me started with Paul Giametti's Rhino, who is there just to be there for about 5 minutes of film. I'm pretty sure, that the studio wanted to try and cameo almost every single Spiderman character there is.With all the characters you aren't become emotionally involved in any of them, and that includes the ending, which should of left me in tears but it didn't. Harry Osborne's discovery should have left me sad, but it didn't. Electro's character should of left me with symphony for the guy, but it didn't.I'm not going to lie, the visuals were amazing. While there are few action sequences to speak of those we do view are pretty breathe taking. Electro's fight on Times Square was just gorgeously rendered, as was Electro himself. Dane DeHaan's transformed Green Goblin was amazingly done. And way superior to the cheap looking one done for the original Goblin. And Spiderman himself, when he flies thru the sky is beautiful and realistic looking.The performances were fine. 'Andrew Garfield' and 'Emma Stone' who share romance off the screen, share great chemistry on the screen as well. The relationship they implied was realistic, and both actors have charm and charisma. Not to mention Garfield's almost perfect sense of comedic timing. Spiderman was made for Garfield. And Stone holds her own, I mean it, I would see another spiderman movie just for her alone. 'Sally Fields' is underused to say the least, but in what meager scene's she has, she makes the most of it, playing a sweet and lovable Aunt May. 'Jamie Foxx' is Electro. Yeah, I was skeptical at first, when I heard he had been cast but now I'm sure he was perfect for the part. While he kind of when a bit far in his performance, in was still nice enough and he tried hard. 'Dane DeHaan' plays a creepy Harry. While I won't say he was better than Franco, he was pretty solid. And out of anybody who could play Osborne after James Franco, I would have said DeHaan. And then there's 'Paul Giametti' as Rhino. He's over the top and too hammy. And his accent is probably one of the accents I have heard, I could not comprehend anything he said.The costume design and make up affects are also well put to use. I liked Spiderman's new suit.The editing was way too choppy during action sequences, particularly during the opening scene involving a plane, as well as a scene in the end involving a very green goblin.The music was well chosen for the scenes used, it added emotional under tones, as well as a sense of fun when particular scene become a bit too serious. I particularly liked the end credit music from 'Alicia Keys'. It was a catchy tune.All and All 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' has an over abundance of characters, choppy editing, less then successful character development, but still the film works with the help of a nice chemistry between leads 'Andrew Garfield' and 'Emma Stone' as well as some nice supporters including 'Jamie Foxx' and' Dane DeHaan'. Plus, it helps that the visuals are spectacular and the music, fun. Plus kudos goes to director 'Marc Webb' for a very surprising, very emotionally gripping and powerful ending. But this Spidey sequel still was a disappointment. C+ 5/11/14'The Amazing Spiderman 2' is rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence, some scenes that may disturb or frighten young children, and some language.",3,Character overload with choppy editing but Garfield does give an amazing performance and that ending...

Do have an open mind and enjoy the new take on the comic, it's not Raimi, it's not a copy or comparison to Sam Raimi's  Spiderman trilogy. I am a bit puzzled by people who are always confused when there is more than one villain. Reviewers complained in Spidey 3, that it was &#34;confusing&#34; &#34;too much going on&#34;  &#34;too long & boring&#34;  and now Amazing Spiderman 2 is getting a lot of the same knocks. Doesn't make sense to me, the plot wasn't confusing and it wasn't boring. Some fans are just going to reject new takes on films, and some are knocking it because Jaime Fox was Electro. I liked Superman with Christopher Reeves but I also like Man of Steel with Henry Cavill, I thought that was a new take on a classic and it worked. CGI is a part of every film, even Raimi used CGI, what would Star Wars have been without them?  Remember MJ has to enter the story, even in the animated series they got married, MJ was always a more established and significant character than Gwen Stacy. God bless Andrew & Emma in their personal life, perhaps they are lifelong partners, but in Spiderman, Peter Parker's  lifelong companion is MJ.",5,Fun Movie!

1696766,A1CJ8JS6X7K41Y,B00JKPHUE0,K. Craig,"[13, 36]","You will like this if all you want are special effects and battle scenes which are spectacular in the last third of the movie.  Jamie Fox was wonderful as Electro once he gets the powers but before that he was painful to watch (think Meteor Man without the comedy).  Emma Stone was charming, smart and gorgeous as usual.  Unfortunately you will have to put up with the first 2/3 and last 10 minutes of the movie for that sweet spot.  Other than that you will get the full emotional roller coaster that is Peter Parker/Spider Man which can appear very bi-polar (unreasonable/irresponsible highs and crushing lows); a terribly predictable story; the tragic death of a beloved character while many police and bystanders inexplicably avoid death or injury when they most certainly should have (building debris and heavy machine gun fire fail to injure anyone despite huge crowds lining up to watch the battles like it's a Macy's Day parade).As a youthful fan/collector of comic books and an enthusiastic adult watcher of superhero movies I was shocked and revolted by the first battle that took place in this movie as I saw Spiderman make a bunch of smart ass comments and basically screwing around while the villains crushed police and civilian vehicles and shot indiscriminately in every direction.  It's true that traditionally Spiderman does have a comedic tone during battle but never at the expense of innocents as this movie depicts.For those of you who have seen the trailers some of those scenes are no longer in the theatrical version (the elder Osborne having Peter watched for example).",1,I regret giving Sony any money for this and will likely avoid future Sony made Spiderman movies,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1594,"['will', 'like', 'want', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Electro', 'once', 'powers', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'think', 'Meteor', 'Man', 'comedy', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'charming', 'smart', 'gorgeous', 'usual', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'first', '2/3', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'sweet', 'spot', 'Other', 'will', 'get', 'full', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider', 'Man', 'can', 'appear', 'very', 'bi-polar', 'unreasonable/irresponsible', 'highs', 'crushing', 'lows', 'terribly', 'predictable', 'story', 'tragic', 'death', 'beloved', 'character', 'many', 'police', 'bystanders', 'inexplicably', 'avoid', 'death', 'injury', 'when', 'most', 'certainly', 'should', 'have', 'building', 'debris', 'heavy', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'fail', 'injure', 'anyone', 'huge', 'crowds', 'lining', 'up', 'watch', 'battles', 'Macy', 'Day', 'parade', '.As', 'youthful', 'fan/collector', 'comic', 'books', 'enthusiastic', 'adult', 'watcher', 'superhero', 'movies', 'was', 'shocked', 'revolted', 'first', 'battle', 'took', 'place', 'movie', 'saw', 'Spiderman', 'make', 'bunch', 'smart', 'ass', 'comments', 'basically', 'screwing', 'around', 'villains', 'crushed', 'police', 'civilian', 'vehicles', 'shot', 'indiscriminately', 'direction', 'true', 'traditionally', 'Spiderman', 'have', 'comedic', 'tone', 'battle', 'never', 'expense', 'innocents', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'trailers', 'scenes', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'version', 'elder', 'Osborne', 'having', 'Peter', 'watched', 'example']",N/A
1696767,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00JKPHUE0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 5]","Okay, I'll start this review off by stating that I've enjoyed most of the recent Spider-man films.  I liked &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; despite its flaws and all of the flicks in Tobey Maguire's run as Spidey except for the third film in that franchise.  It was poorly executed, had the kid from That 70's Show in it ruining Venom, and just had too much going on all at once.I figured that &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; would fall into the same category as &#34;Spider-Man 3.&#34;  Thank goodness that I was wrong.The film starts off with Spidey (Andrew Garfield)  facing off against Rhino (albeit without his armored suit shown in the previews).  That little event leads up to Peter Parker's graduation from school and brings viewers up to speed on the state of the Wallcrawler in relation to the city and, more importantly, to Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).  The city loves him for the most part, but a few detractors believe he's getting in the way or needs to back off a bit.  Gwen still loves Peter, and he struggles daily with the promise he made to her father in the previous film to stay away from her.Meanwhile, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is bumbling his way through life.  Despite being extremely intelligent, Dillon coasts from day to day as a relative nobody.  Oscorp has taken credit for his work, and he has a really terrible self-image.  All he wants is to be noticed, and when Spider-Man saves him early in the film, he embraces Spidey (at least in his mind) as his best friend.Through events that I'll leave out so as not to spoil anything, Dillon becomes Electro, and all of Dillon's insecurities turn into hatred of pretty much everyone, including Spider-Man.  After clashing with the Webslinger once and failing, Electro makes a pact with Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), freshly ousted from Oscorp and bent on revenge against Spider-Man himself.  I won't give the reason why he wants revenge, just know that it ultimately leads to him becoming the Goblin.This leads up to Spider-Man clashing once again with Electro and then facing off against the Goblin.  Can Spidey stop them both?  You'll have to watch the film to find out.Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  Yes, there's plenty to complain about, such as the off-kilter actions of some of the characters and the terrible CGI Rhino suit that will hopefully be fixed if Rhino shows up in the next film.  However, the strength of this film lies within its cast, specifically Garfield, Stone, and DeHaan.Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker.  He perfectly embodies the smart-aleck kid who mouths off to villains the entire time he is fighting with them.  The crowd laughed throughout Spidey's battles because he was extremely funny.  Stone, despite having multiple sugary sweet interactions with Garfield throughout the film, made Gwen a likeable character.  She and Garfield played off of each other perfectly, making scenes between lovestruck young adults bearable.  DeHaan came out of nowhere to give one of the best performances in the film.  I was not aware of any of his previous work, but his portrayal of Harry was spot on.  The only hiccups in the film were from Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon and Paul Giamatti wasting space as Rhino.  Dillon was terrible, and Foxx failed at the portrayal.  However, once Foxx became Electro, he became much more interesting and just a slight bit more believable.  Giamatti has two brief appearances in the film, so he doesn't effect the overall story that much.  He's basically injected to open and close the film with a little bit of humor.  I could have done without him.The film, despite being almost two and a half hours long, moves at a very fast clip and held my attention throughout.  There is one particularly heart-tugging moment at the climax of the film, and while I myself didn't cry during that moment, a lot of people did.So, is &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#34; better than the films that proceeded it?  Yes, except for &#34;Spider-Man 2,&#34; which is one of my favorite superhero films of all time.I recommend this film to fans of comic movies and for anyone who loves excellent action with a lot of humor (laced with some very disturbing moments as well).",4,"The Good, The Bad, And The Rhino",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,4190,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'start', 'review', 'off', 'stating', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'most', 'recent', 'Spider-man', 'films', 'liked', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '34', 'flaws', 'flicks', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'run', 'Spidey', 'third', 'film', 'franchise', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'had', 'kid', '70', 'Show', 'ruining', 'Venom', 'just', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'once.I', 'figured', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'would', 'fall', 'same', 'category', '34', 'Spider-Man', '3.', '34', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'Spidey', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'facing', 'off', 'Rhino', 'armored', 'suit', 'shown', 'previews', 'little', 'event', 'up', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'graduation', 'school', 'viewers', 'up', 'speed', 'state', 'Wallcrawler', 'relation', 'city', 'more', 'importantly', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'city', 'most', 'part', 'few', 'detractors', 'believe', 'getting', 'way', 'back', 'off', 'bit', 'Gwen', 'still', 'Peter', 'daily', 'promise', 'made', 'father', 'previous', 'film', 'stay', 'away', 'her.Meanwhile', 'Max', 'Dillon', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'bumbling', 'way', 'life', 'being', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'Dillon', 'coasts', 'day', 'day', 'relative', 'nobody', 'Oscorp', 'taken', 'credit', 'work', 'really', 'terrible', 'self-image', 'be', 'noticed', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'early', 'film', 'Spidey', 'least', 'mind', 'best', 'friend.Through', 'events', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'out', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'Dillon', 'Electro', 'Dillon', 'insecurities', 'turn', 'hatred', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'including', 'Spider-Man', 'clashing', 'Webslinger', 'once', 'failing', 'Electro', 'pact', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'freshly', 'ousted', 'Oscorp', 'bent', 'revenge', 'Spider-Man', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'reason', 'why', 'revenge', 'just', 'know', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'Goblin.This', 'up', 'Spider-Man', 'clashing', 'once', 'again', 'Electro', 'then', 'facing', 'off', 'Goblin', 'Can', 'Spidey', 'stop', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'complain', 'about', 'such', 'off-kilter', 'actions', 'characters', 'terrible', 'CGI', 'Rhino', 'suit', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'fixed', 'Rhino', 'up', 'next', 'film', 'However', 'strength', 'film', 'cast', 'specifically', 'Garfield', 'Stone', 'DeHaan.Andrew', 'Garfield', 'IS', 'Spider-Man/Peter', 'Parker', 'perfectly', 'smart-aleck', 'kid', 'who', 'mouths', 'off', 'villains', 'entire', 'time', 'fighting', 'crowd', 'laughed', 'Spidey', 'battles', 'was', 'extremely', 'funny', 'Stone', 'having', 'multiple', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'interactions', 'Garfield', 'film', 'made', 'Gwen', 'likeable', 'character', 'Garfield', 'played', 'other', 'perfectly', 'making', 'scenes', 'lovestruck', 'young', 'adults', 'bearable', 'DeHaan', 'came', 'nowhere', 'give', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'previous', 'work', 'portrayal', 'Harry', 'was', 'spot', 'only', 'hiccups', 'film', 'were', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Max', 'Dillon', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'wasting', 'space', 'Rhino', 'Dillon', 'was', 'terrible', 'Foxx', 'failed', 'portrayal', 'However', 'once', 'Foxx', 'became', 'Electro', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'slight', 'bit', 'more', 'believable', 'Giamatti', 'two', 'brief', 'appearances', 'film', ""n't"", 'effect', 'overall', 'story', 'much', 'basically', 'injected', 'open', 'close', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'him.The', 'film', 'being', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'moves', 'very', 'fast', 'clip', 'held', 'attention', 'one', 'particularly', 'heart-tugging', 'moment', 'climax', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'moment', 'lot', 'people', 'did.So', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'better', 'films', 'proceeded', 'Yes', '34', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'one', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'films', 'time.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'comic', 'movies', 'anyone', 'who', 'excellent', 'action', 'lot', 'humor', 'laced', 'very', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'well']",N/A

I was expecting an &#34;average&#34; movie and saw a &#34;good&#34; one. Gwen is fabulous as played by Emma Stone. Peter is a bit too talkative and hyper for me. He is distinctly different from the comics from 1966 throughout the early 90's. Toby McGuire's and especially the comics of that era portrayed Peter as an unpopular geeky bright guy who is way out of his league with Gwen Stacey (His first love- comics) and/or Mary Jane (First trilogy). It was only when he dawned the outfit that he became really cool- and that strikes a chord with many- pretty much everyone who hated high school....A few positives:...Spider-man physically looks like Peter. This was not the case in the trilogy nor in the early comics. Before, it was more than his confidence that grew behind the mask- his muscles grew as well! I really like this portrayal, where that doesn't happen....Electro is amazing! Fox's acting is solid and the special fx are like nothing I've ever seen before. They are..., &#34;Electric&#34;! Sorry- just had to say it....The actor playing Norman Osborne is fantastic! He really fills up a screen- reminds me of Leonardo Dicaprio in many ways. Only negative was the makeup for his goblin scenes. Not to my liking....SPOILER ALERT. The movie follows the comic with regards to Peter and Gwen. I won't spell it out, but this was an extremely important part of Peter's story- practically as big as his Uncle Ben's death....A few negatives:...A bit long for my liking, but this is relatively minor unless you're bringing younger children. The second act drags at times....As Stan Lee once explained: Marvel is Spider-man and visa versa; however, Spider-man is more a tale of Peter than it is of Spidey. Peter Parker is the key, and always has been. Once again, Toby McGuire's Peter was familiar to me- the 2014 Peter is not- but who knows... you may like him better!",4,Not your father's Peter Parker,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1927,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', '2', 'was', 'expecting', '34', 'average', '34', 'movie', 'saw', '34', 'good', '34', 'one', 'Gwen', 'fabulous', 'played', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Peter', 'bit', 'too', 'talkative', 'hyper', 'distinctly', 'different', 'comics', '1966', 'early', '90', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'especially', 'comics', 'era', 'portrayed', 'Peter', 'unpopular', 'geeky', 'bright', 'guy', 'who', 'way', 'league', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'first', 'love-', 'comics', 'and/or', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'First', 'trilogy', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'dawned', 'outfit', 'became', 'really', 'cool-', 'chord', 'many-', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'hated', 'high', 'school', 'few', 'positives', 'Spider-man', 'physically', 'Peter', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'trilogy', 'early', 'comics', 'was', 'more', 'confidence', 'grew', 'mask-', 'muscles', 'grew', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'portrayal', 'where', ""n't"", 'happen', '.Electro', 'amazing', 'Fox', 'acting', 'solid', 'special', 'fx', 'are', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'are', '34', 'Electric', '34', 'Sorry-', 'just', 'had', 'say', 'actor', 'playing', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'fantastic', 'really', 'up', 'screen-', 'reminds', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'many', 'ways', 'Only', 'negative', 'was', 'makeup', 'goblin', 'scenes', 'Not', 'liking', '.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'movie', 'comic', 'regards', 'Peter', 'Gwen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'was', 'extremely', 'important', 'part', 'Peter', 'story-', 'practically', 'as', 'big', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'death', 'few', 'negatives', 'bit', 'long', 'liking', 'relatively', 'minor', ""'re"", 'bringing', 'younger', 'children', 'second', 'act', 'drags', 'times', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'once', 'explained', 'Marvel', 'Spider-man', 'visa', 'versa', 'however', 'Spider-man', 'more', 'tale', 'Peter', 'Spidey', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'key', 'always', 'been', 'Once', 'again', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'Peter', 'was', 'familiar', 'me-', '2014', 'Peter', 'not-', 'who', 'may', 'like', 'better']",N/A
1696770,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B00JKPHUE0,Kurt Russell,"[5, 10]","This is quite possibly the most overstuffed movie ever made. It's hard to think of another film that attempts to dump so many antagonists, subplots, love interests, etc. into one film. If you didn't like the similarly excessive Spider-man 3, you'll loathe this one too.For some reason, the filmmakers keep pushing the mystery of Peter Parker's parents (though Uncle Ben doesn't even get mentioned here.) So be prepared to thrill at numerous scenes of an angst-ridden Peter Parker sleuthing through old newspaper clippings and grainy videos, often during an emo-backed montage. This is only a mystery for the sake of there being a mystery, as the subplot has zero impact on the actual narrative and is not particularly gripping either. I guess it's just another shameless trick to try and lure you back for more in future installments too.So beyond that waste of time, you have Peter's personal relationships with Gwen, May and now the newly introduced Harry. The two boys pal around in a laughably corny sequence to show you how they're BFFs though you never heard of the guy till 5 minutes ago. And let's have Spider-Man battle Electro, Goblin and Rhino. Need more? Let's cram some more story in like Harry's illness, Oscorp's takeover, Gwen's school application, Electro's nonsensical origin and motives. Don't forget the horribly out-of-place &#34;detective Peter&#34; subplot too. The whole stew would've been far more palpable if done better, but it's a complete hodgepodge of ideas. Tonally, the movie haltingly shifts gears from polar opposites like childish comedy to techno-thriller within seconds. Perhaps the Peter/Gwen chemistry is decent, though their scenes together are the same &#34;love you, but can't be with you&#34; claptrap which is rehashed ad nauseum.What works is Spider-man and the spider action. The glib tone and attitude of everyone's favorite web-crawler is spot on. The soaring and spinning camerawork is a blast too. Raimi's original sequences were superior, but this version's wild fights and rescues while dishing out silly quips are still great. Unfortunately, those moments are in short supply, and the advertisements reveal all the best parts. (I don't know if that phenomena is because a bad movie needs to desperately sell all its finest parts, or if a movie becomes bad because the viewer is not thrilled by these moments anymore. Probably a combination of both. Anyhoo...)A final needless and overstuffed insult arrives at the end with a big, shocking event, which should have left the characters helplessly reeling from its heavy ramifications. But instead, the can't-do-enough Amazing Spider-man 2 takes this final revelation and squeezes an entire movie's worth of consequences and emotions into another nifty little 10-minute span. The rushed ending/epilogue is another offense to all of the characters we're supposed to care for and relate to, giving them short shrift in the process.The hurried and unresolved style of the story makes the entire film feels like a giant prologue. This comic-book movie is easily the worst offender of rushing to spawn a never-ending franchise in the future versus making a good movie in the present. But I have a feeling Batman v Superman might steal that title shortly.",2,A tangled mess,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3249,"['quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'overstuffed', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'hard', 'think', 'film', 'dump', 'so', 'many', 'antagonists', 'subplots', 'love', 'interests', 'etc', 'one', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'similarly', 'excessive', 'Spider-man', '3', ""'ll"", 'loathe', 'one', 'too.For', 'reason', 'filmmakers', 'keep', 'pushing', 'mystery', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'parents', 'Uncle', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'mentioned', 'here', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'thrill', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'angst-ridden', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'sleuthing', 'old', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'grainy', 'videos', 'often', 'emo-backed', 'montage', 'only', 'mystery', 'sake', 'being', 'mystery', 'subplot', 'zero', 'impact', 'actual', 'narrative', 'not', 'particularly', 'gripping', 'guess', 'just', 'shameless', 'trick', 'try', 'lure', 'back', 'more', 'future', 'installments', 'too.So', 'waste', 'time', 'have', 'Peter', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Gwen', 'May', 'now', 'newly', 'introduced', 'Harry', 'two', 'boys', 'pal', 'around', 'laughably', 'corny', 'sequence', 'show', 'how', ""'re"", 'BFFs', 'never', 'heard', 'guy', 'till', '5', 'minutes', 'ago', 'let', 'have', 'Spider-Man', 'battle', 'Electro', 'Goblin', 'Rhino', 'Need', 'more', 'Let', 'cram', 'more', 'story', 'Harry', 'illness', 'Oscorp', 'takeover', 'Gwen', 'school', 'application', 'Electro', 'nonsensical', 'origin', 'motives', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'horribly', 'out-of-place', '34', 'detective', 'Peter', '34', 'subplot', 'too', 'whole', 'stew', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'more', 'palpable', 'done', 'better', 'complete', 'hodgepodge', 'ideas', 'Tonally', 'movie', 'haltingly', 'shifts', 'gears', 'polar', 'opposites', 'childish', 'comedy', 'techno-thriller', 'seconds', 'Perhaps', 'Peter/Gwen', 'chemistry', 'decent', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'same', '34', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', '34', 'claptrap', 'rehashed', 'ad', 'Spider-man', 'spider', 'action', 'glib', 'tone', 'attitude', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'web-crawler', 'spot', 'soaring', 'spinning', 'camerawork', 'blast', 'too', 'Raimi', 'original', 'sequences', 'were', 'superior', 'version', 'wild', 'fights', 'rescues', 'dishing', 'out', 'silly', 'quips', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'moments', 'are', 'short', 'supply', 'advertisements', 'reveal', 'best', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'phenomena', 'bad', 'movie', 'needs', 'desperately', 'sell', 'finest', 'parts', 'movie', 'bad', 'viewer', 'not', 'thrilled', 'moments', 'anymore', 'Probably', 'combination', 'Anyhoo', 'final', 'needless', 'overstuffed', 'insult', 'end', 'big', 'shocking', 'event', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'characters', 'helplessly', 'reeling', 'heavy', 'ramifications', 'instead', ""can't-do-enough"", 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', '2', 'final', 'revelation', 'entire', 'movie', 'worth', 'consequences', 'emotions', 'nifty', 'little', '10-minute', 'span', 'rushed', 'ending/epilogue', 'offense', 'characters', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'care', 'relate', 'giving', 'short', 'shrift', 'process.The', 'hurried', 'unresolved', 'style', 'story', 'entire', 'film', 'feels', 'giant', 'prologue', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'easily', 'worst', 'offender', 'rushing', 'spawn', 'never-ending', 'franchise', 'future', 'versus', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'present', 'have', 'feeling', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'might', 'steal', 'title', 'shortly']",N/A

1696772,A24WWT2W1M61AQ,B00JKPHUE0,"Lisa Traverso ""tripleSps3""","[5, 8]","To me, incredible art has always been imperfection. Why is art even worth talking about if we cannot debate the pros and cons, and offer our own interpretation and analysis of each individual work of art? The beauty of art is that it is such an individual experience. We are creators of art ourselves, but we also look at a piece of art and it impacts us in a different kind of way. Some people may look at a piece of art through a pair of specks and believe that it is flawless, another person may be able to see its flaws and not be able to look past it, while the flaws and imperfections of another piece of art may be the reason why we love that piece of art: because imperfection is how art relates so closely to the human experience.Spider-Man is exactly that, and this quality and many more is what makes the character evolve so effortlessly into whatever time period, and it is one of the many reasons why he is my favorite fictional character of all time. However, like the character himself, his source material has ranged in perfection and imperfection. Spider-Man has had some of the greatest sources of stories and media in the recent decades, but he has also had stumbles in every form of media, including some of the comics from the 1990s, as well as some over-cluttered blockbuster films (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, SPIDER-MAN 3!). Spidey material aims for greatness, but like the character, sometimes does and sometimes does not hit the mark.Returning two years after a fairly successful reboot and being reloaded with three villains and multiple storylines, the important question is this: does The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hit the mark?The Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up shortly after the events of the first film. Whereas the majority of the previous film dedicated the majority of its time to developing Peter Parker into Spider-Man, the sequel establishes right away that Peter is indeed an amazing Spider-Man. He is really good at being Spider-Man at this point, he loves it, and this gives Peter a boost of confidence both in and out of costume. Of course, as we know from most Spider-Man stories, Peter has about as much luck as Superman does a home planet... to put it bluntly, he has none. Peter is internally struggling with keeping the promise that he made to Gwen Stacy's father to stay away from her, is struggling to be both Peter Parker and Spider-Man while trying to please people who encounter either one (or, in some cases, both), and is still emotionally impacted by the disappearance of his parents when he was a kid.However, another big, underlying conflict of Peter is the external conflict: super villains. These of which include Max Dillon, a slightly obsessive electrician whose freak accident and hunger for power turns him into Electro, Harry Osborn, an old childhood friend who is eventually turned into a greater threat, and Aleksei Sytsevich who has a cameo appearance as the Rhino. Without spoiling too much about their involvement in this film, the villains, in the end, are linked through one central component: OsCorp.With everything going on, one might be thinking of Spider-Man 3 with the number of villains and subplots. Being a hater of Spider-Man 3, the early word from critics had me worried somewhat about that. However, rest assured that this is NOT Spider-Man 3. If you're worried about the number of villains, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is able to balance the characters well, putting more emphasis on some characters, and less on others necessarily.And while there are a lot of events packed into this two hour and twenty two minute long film (which flows by without a dull moment by the way), suffice to say, it all feels pretty well connected together. And unlike Spider-Man 3, the structure is not burdened by plotlines that don't need to exist; the content here feels necessary for the story being told, which not only ties up loose conflicts from the first film, but is also able to create new elements that are even better.Let's talk villains. Rhino is ultimately there primarily as a cameo, and while his role is fun and ridiculous, it isn't as relevant to the plot. One of the main villains is Electro. Electro in the film is essentially carries a part of us inside: we all want to be that cool person; the one who inspires us. We all want to believe in that. In an unfortunate turn of events, however, the bad luck of Peter Parker causes Electro to feel betrayed by Spider-Man, even when it wasn't his fault. It causes his perfect image that he built up in his head to be crushed. Some people may say that Max is just a crazy guy, but the concept of building up people in our heads only to be let down by them is an interesting concept. It makes for a villain who is well developed and, while may not have the amount of time that one individual villain would have, has plenty of enough development to understand him, and to fear him when push comes to shove.The main villain of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, however, is Harry Osborn. Harry Osborn in this film is given the most screentime of the three, and justifiably so. Without giving away exactly what role he plays, his motives and characterization is by far one of the best I have seen of the character in any interpretation. At the start, his character is extremely likable, and even as he goes down the path of evil, his motives remain understandable and relatable. Furthermore, when the motives push him over the line and full on turn him into an antagonist, he is extremely creepy. And I mean that in the best way possible. He is easily the leading antagonist in this huge plot.While to some this may be considered a flaw, one of the things that I found unique (and to me quite awesome) about the script in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the structure felt a lot like a comic book. What I mean is, like a comic book, the film's story jumps between some quieter moments to louder moments to excite the audience and then back to quiet again. Some have complained about these creating awkward tonal shifts, but I never found the tone to be inconsistent. What was effective about this style of storytelling is it added to the comic book feel of the universe that they were attempting to establish with this film.And speaking of that comic book world, what a world it is. Now that the origin story is out of the way, director Marc Webb and confidence have gained a sense of confidence going into this story, and thus are not afraid to expand on the elements of the Spidey verse that work so well. They add a small amount of classic Spidey cheese without making it overbearing, they continue to expand Spidey's humor in satisfying ways, and they introduce villains and plotlines from the comics that, while take some liberties, ultimately translate incredibly well on screen. The little kid inside of me (or, okay, I am mostly a kid still) shouted from inside multiple times as these characters were brought to life in ways that embraced the source material. It leads to a more entertaining product, and if for nothing else, the confidence in the story makes for a film that is incredibly fun to watch.What's even more amazing is, if you take a moment to analyze the film further, there is a lot of deep content to find thematically. Giving away specifics would risk spoiling the film, but every conflict in the story has some sort of impact on the character of Peter Parker. What works so well about the multiple plot line storyline is that the script consistently asks this question: How does this impact Peter Parker? The question of emotional impact is a difficult question to answer effectively with this scale of story, but Marc Webb is able to overcome the challenge. Every conflict mentioned above has a meaningful impact on Peter Parker and his development throughout the story. It may not appear as surface level as in some movies, but like a great story, that is the fun of digesting the film. There are layers here that the script, and director Marc Webb, create to make not only the other characters and conflicts have more meaning, but to make Spider-Man one of the most fleshed out characters in a comic book movie.Of course, while the themes of the film are fantastic upon deeper inspection, there is still a lot to love from a casual audience standpoint. The humor has been vastly improved from the first Amazing Spider-Man film, there are villains with personality and life, and regardless of whether you are a casual audience member or not, there is a lot of heart in this story. After seeing the film two times right now (if this section doesn't go away, that means this has not changed since my first two viewings), there were multiple moments where I cried during the film, there were a dozen laugh out loud moments, and there were many moments in terms of satisfying comic book content and satisfying storytelling content that made me want to stand up and cheer.Yes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has a lot going on. If it were under different direction, or handled with less care, it could have been a mess. However, the amount of ambition that the filmmakers had with this project, amazingly, turned out to be in their favor, as The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a heck of a ride that phenomenally combines great comic book spectacle with genuine heart and some of the most truly impactful sequences I have ever seen in a comic book film. It all adds to a film that extracts a ton of emotions, including fear, excitement, joy, sadness, and many more. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is able to extract all of these without ever losing sight of the excellent source material that it is based around.One of the biggest strengths of the first Amazing Spider-Man film came from its cast, and this film is no exception.One of the biggest surprises was Sally Field's performance as Aunt May. While I loved her in the first film, the content she is given in this sequel proves to be even more emotionally satisfying, and giving Sally Field the room to perform creates a few of the film's most memorable moments. Just as effective are the three antagonists in the film: Jamie Foxx is great as the awkward and at the same time menacing Max Dillon (one particular scene made me feel genuine sympathy and fear at the same time), Paul Giamatti has a lot of fun as the insane and over the top Aleksei Sytevich, and my goodness is Dane DeHaan the perfect choice for Harry Osborn. DeHaan brings out the most essential elements of the character (mild jealousy, selfishness, yet kindness) from the comics and making them his own. It is a great interpretation of the character, and one that I think will be a great addition for this franchise for years to come.Of course, the real stars of the film are the same stars as the first film: Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. Emma Stone is absolutely electric on screen. She has great comedic timing, is strong willed, smart, THE OPPOSITE of a damsel in distress, and sweet and charming. Emma doesn't really seem to be acting here, as these qualities seem so natural in this role. You can really see why Peter falls in love with her; she is truly the best female love interest in a comic book movie. Like the first film, we fall in love with Gwen Stacy, and her chemistry with Garfield only enhances this sense of love that we as an audience feel towards her.Speaking of Garfield... wow. I was absolutely blown away by his portrayal of the character in the first Amazing Spider-Man film, but his performance here is even better. Garfield not only has great comedic timing for the Spidey quips, and he not only has just the right amount of awkwardness for the character of Peter Parker (despite his confidence boost). Garfield also has a heart of gold. Anyone who complained that Peter was unlikable in the first film can rest easy. He is absolutely selfless and caring, while also staying true to himself and his moral values, even in the face of great potential danger. It is so true to the character that I fell in love with, and Garfield has as much fun playing Spidey as I do watching it. Garfield displays a true genuine sense of humanity to every single scene he does, which, amazingly, is not broken when he goes in costume. You can practically feel him crawling out of the suit even when he is in it.The cast does a phenomenal job, and the visual effects department is just as strong. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 includes truly some of the most beautiful Spider-Man imagery I have seen on screen. For once, the 3D effects are fantastic, the CGI is so seamless that at times I thought it was a real stunt, and the choreography of the fight sequences is great. The action scenes are just long enough to feel a sense of excitement and satisfaction, without dragging on too long to feel heavy handed like they did in some films like The Avengers and Man of Steel (both of which I still liked, though!). Furthermore, the cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning. Practically every shot in this film feels like it was ripped straight off the pages of a comic book, especially with the vibrant colors as a result of the new tone that is established in this film. And oh is it great.Webb is confident with his story, confident with his cast, confident with his action, but what is even better is the fact that you can see elements of him being just a great filmmaker, period. One particular thing that he does exceptionally well is match visual elements with music. And no, I don't just mean the great uses of Hans Zimmer's fantastic new Spidey score. Remember the skateboarding montage in the first film with the song &#34;Till Kingdom Come&#34; by Coldplay? There are a couple of scenes like that in this film as well, and they are excellent. It really displays that this director really isn't just interested in spectacle, or just romance; he is interested and passionate about the entire filmmaking process. And these sequences, along with many others, result in a film that is constantly extracting emotion even during the quietest moments.And this is a testament to the creative team behind the film. Yes, this new Spider-Man franchise was created so that Sony could hold onto the rights of the Spider-Man character, but it is clear that the creative team behind the film care about Spider-Man. They care so much that they have created a film that is truly a comic book film in every sense of the phrase: progression of story, style of imagery, and presentation of themes. With a character as strong as Spider-Man with so many great stories to tell, this is probably the smartest decision that they have made.Going back to what I said earlier about art, the interpretation of it is in the eye of the beholder, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is truly a testament to that. There are people who will see the plot as crammed, the action as far between, and the tone to be too comic book style for their liking. However, what many people consider to be flaws in art are seen as enhancements of it. To me, the scale of the story only adds to the emotional scale, and the payoff is oh so satisfying. The action sequences are great and give us just enough to be satisfied without shoving it down our throats. And, while these films came to be because of companies not wanting to lose their most successful property, the filmmakers behind The Amazing Spider-Man 2 clearly have one goal in mind: to create the most amazing (no pun intended) Spider-Man experience for an audience.There are a lot of pieces of this puzzle to fit into place in order for this to happen: you have to have a script ready for ambition, you need a cast ready to face that challenge of ambition (and to accept the criticism), and you need people to put as much time into their editing process as comic book artists do into their coloring. What's so amazing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is that it does all of these things. In the end, they have created a film that is truly Spider-Man, the character and lore that I have had a ridiculous obsession with since I was four. Films and comic books, of course, are entirely different mediums, but it is about time that film audiences are able to experience the somewhat foreign territories of the comic book lore while also experiencing the native territory of great filmmaking.The masterfully executed combination of these two things is what is most amazing of all.",5,"""There's no place like home.""",1404086400,"06 30,

1696773,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B00JKPHUE0,MacJunegrand,"[7, 16]","EDIT: As Amazon has done their usual nonsensical grouping of reviews for all different editions of this product, my original half-joking review makes no sense for most people, so I'm going to include a real review of the film here, if anyone happens to be interested in my opinion, followed by my original one.SHORT (for my usual writing) REVIEW FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2:It's OK.  It's better than the previous film in some areas, but its quality suffers in other ones.  The action scenes are the best part, they're fantastic, fun, visually striking and make good use of every character's abilities.  The cast for the movie is (no pun intended) amazing, specially newcomer Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn.  His intensely creepy performance will stay with you for a long time.Unfortunately, the cast isn't given much to work with.  The characters are just poorly written.  Max Dillon is really fun, but once he turns into Electro, he becomes a one-dimensional character that would be at home in Spidey's 1967 cartoon series.  As great as he is, Foxx just doesn't have enough to work with, and asking of him to make Electro a compelling villain would be to ask a chef to bake a cake with one egg and a spoonful of flour.  Gwen has been reduced to a exposition-spewing caricature (also, she goes back to the tired old clich&eacute; of the unsuportive superhero girlfriend), and DeHaan's screentime as the Green Goblin is so small that Venom from Spider-Man 3 embarrases him.  Sally Field's Aunt May has a couple of scenes that try to be tear jerking, but the dialogue she's given is so weak you can't help but think ""Yeah, yeah I got the point, stop droning"".Director Marc Webb yet again thinks the audience is dumb, so his story is condescending and frankly insulting at some points.  Interviews reveal he's frankly surprised when people figure out the obvious plot points he believed to be subtle clues, so there's clearly no one to blame but him.  I really wish he stopped thinking he's so brilliant and gave audiences a little more credit.  I don't say he's dumb, but he clearly thinks we are.Also, this film clearly shows Webb hasn't learned much from the problems with the previous franchise.  There are two main villains in this film (Rhino's bulk screentime is just what you see in trailers, no more, I tell you this so you won't be dissapointed), yet both get even less screentime than the villains in Spider-Man 3.  The motivations of the villains are even weaker this time than in that film and the reveal for ""the untold story"" that has been slammed on us since the first film is laughable.  It's like those friends who keep hyping a girl they want to set you up with and then when they introduce her it turns out she's a chihuahua.  Literally.So, do I recommend this film?  Well, yeah.  Despite its flaws, it's still a really fun film, and isn't that what we all want?  It's not going to change your life, move you or be the best Spider-Man film, but it's going to entertain you, and I think that's the important part of a film....ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR ELECTRO COLLECTOR'S EDITION:$100 down from $150 for the privilege of having Jamie Foxx's creepy mugshot stare at you while you watch bootleg skinemax films in your mother-in-law's tablet?  Ridiculous, considering you can get the real Jamie Foxx to do the same for about $70.Even more ridiculous if you consider that for $10 you can get Nicolas Cage to do the same plus clean your house and cook your meals.  For an extra $5 he'll even officiate as your personal table/chair/clothes rack.Hmmm, I'm told this comes with a movie included, probably as an excuse to charge a little more for this collectible... Amazing Spider-Man 2... I have no idea what that has to do with Foxx's little know stint in the Blue Man Group this figure is clearly based on, but whatever, I guess I'm going to have to review that as well.Review of the film ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"":It's OK....I'm told I'm supposed to elaborate on this, so fine, jeez...Review of the film ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", part deux:Fantastic action, cool effects, great acting, bad script, convoluted plot, poorly written characters, looks more like a trailer for Sinister Six.  In short, it's OK.  I still don't see what it has to do with that time Jamie Foxx blue himself.",3,A little pricey for what you get... or not (UPDATED),1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,4290,"['EDIT', 'Amazon', 'done', 'usual', 'nonsensical', 'grouping', 'reviews', 'different', 'editions', 'product', 'original', 'half-joking', 'review', 'sense', 'most', 'people', ""'m"", 'going', 'include', 'real', 'review', 'film', 'here', 'anyone', 'be', 'interested', 'opinion', 'followed', 'original', 'one.SHORT', 'usual', 'writing', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'OK', 'better', 'previous', 'film', 'areas', 'quality', 'suffers', 'other', 'ones', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'part', ""'re"", 'fantastic', 'fun', 'visually', 'striking', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'character', 'abilities', 'cast', 'movie', 'pun', 'intended', 'amazing', 'specially', 'newcomer', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'intensely', 'creepy', 'performance', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time.Unfortunately', 'cast', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'Max', 'Dillon', 'really', 'fun', 'once', 'Electro', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'Spidey', '1967', 'cartoon', 'series', 'As', 'great', 'Foxx', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'work', 'asking', 'make', 'Electro', 'compelling', 'villain', 'would', 'be', 'ask', 'chef', 'bake', 'cake', 'one', 'egg', 'spoonful', 'flour', 'Gwen', 'been', 'reduced', 'exposition-spewing', 'caricature', 'also', 'back', 'tired', 'old', 'clich', 'eacute', 'unsuportive', 'superhero', 'girlfriend', 'DeHaan', 'screentime', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'so', 'small', 'Venom', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Aunt', 'May', 'couple', 'scenes', 'try', 'be', 'tear', 'jerking', 'dialogue', 'given', 'so', 'weak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'got', 'point', 'stop', 'droning', '.Director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'yet', 'again', 'audience', 'dumb', 'story', 'condescending', 'frankly', 'insulting', 'points', 'Interviews', 'reveal', 'frankly', 'surprised', 'when', 'people', 'figure', 'out', 'obvious', 'plot', 'points', 'believed', 'be', 'subtle', 'clues', 'clearly', 'one', 'blame', 'really', 'wish', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'so', 'brilliant', 'gave', 'audiences', 'little', 'more', 'credit', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'dumb', 'clearly', 'are.Also', 'film', 'clearly', 'Webb', ""n't"", 'learned', 'much', 'problems', 'previous', 'franchise', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'villains', 'film', 'Rhino', 'bulk', 'screentime', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'trailers', 'more', 'tell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'yet', 'get', 'even', 'less', 'screentime', 'villains', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'motivations', 'villains', 'are', 'even', 'weaker', 'time', 'film', 'reveal', 'untold', 'story', 'been', 'slammed', 'first', 'film', 'laughable', 'friends', 'who', 'keep', 'hyping', 'girl', 'want', 'set', 'up', 'then', 'when', 'introduce', 'out', 'chihuahua', 'Literally.So', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'Well', 'yeah', 'flaws', 'still', 'really', 'fun', 'film', ""n't"", 'what', 'want', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'life', 'move', 'be', 'best', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'going', 'entertain', 'think', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'REVIEW', 'FOR', 'ELECTRO', 'COLLECTOR', 'EDITION', '100', '150', 'privilege', 'having', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'creepy', 'mugshot', 'stare', 'watch', 'bootleg', 'skinemax', 'films', 'mother-in-law', 'tablet', 'Ridiculous', 'considering', 'can', 'get', 'real', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'do', 'same', '70.Even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'consider', '10', 'can', 'get', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'do', 'same', 'clean', 'house', 'cook', 'meals', 'extra', '5', ""'ll"", 'even', 'officiate', 'personal', 'table/chair/clothes', 'rack.Hmmm', ""'m"", 'told', 'movie', 'included', 'probably', 'excuse', 'charge', 'little', 'more', 'collectible', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'Foxx', 'little', 'know', 'stint', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'figure', 'clearly', 'based', 'whatever', 'guess', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'review', 'well.Review', 'film', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'OK', '.I', ""'m"", 'told', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'elaborate', 'so', 'fine', 'jeez', 'Review', 'film', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'part', 'deux', 'Fantastic', 'action', 'cool', 'effects', 'great', 'acting', 'bad', 'script', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'poorly', 'written', 'characters', 'more', 'trailer', 'Sinister', 'Six', 'short', 'OK', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'do', 'time', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'blue']",N/A

Superhero is enjoying life and mainly not doing anything. New villain comes to town, and screws things up for superhero. Superhero ultimately defeats villain and saves his loved ones. End titles.&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man 2,&#34; a continuation of Marc Webb&#8217;s 2012 reboot to the Spider-Man series, doesn&#8217;t really follow said formula - for better and for worse.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is in an odd on-again-off-again with his true love Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and is enjoying public admiration. Max (Jamie Foxx) is a genuinely nice guy who inadvertently becomes the villain (Electro) by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) causes trouble too, but is kind of glossed over to make room for Electro.Andrew Garfield did a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire in the first of the film reboots. This one almost witnesses the death of his acting abilities. He nails the big emotional scenes near the end of the film, but has an odd way of delivering normal lines in the earlier portion of the film, which is really off-putting and kind of disappointing that this actor sank so fast within the length of one movie. However, like I said, he does the important scenes in the end well.Supporting actors like Sally Field and Jamie Foxx have nice moments, but supporting characters are often glossed over in movies like this. A major plot event in the film&#8217;s third act that all of the comic book fans saw coming almost ruined the film for me. It is something that these movies don&#8217;t tend to do. I give Webb and the writers credit for staying true to what was in the comics, but at the same time, I can&#8217;t help but think they shouldn&#8217;t have.The film also does an iffy-at-best job of showing Max Dillon&#8217;s journey from normal guy to villain. You get the idea this guy never wanted to hurt anybody in the first place. So how is the audience supposed to react accordingly to this villain when we don&#8217;t really know his full story?Overall, I left the movie not thinking it was a massive improvement over the first film, like I did with the second film in the previous Spider-Man trilogy. It was more or less a continuation of the first one, and a commercial for the next film. And a commercial for Sony, Netflix, Blu-Ray, and everything illuminated in lights at Times Square during a pivotal battle scene. Product placement kind of ruined the mood in a scene where there should be bigger things on the audience&#8217;s mind. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m done with these films. But they really need to step up their game in the third installment.Grade: C+",3,"""Spider-Man"" reboot sequel stays enjoyable enough, but disappoints in aspects.",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2933,"['Superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'easy', 'please', 'follow', 'basic', 'formula', 'originated', 'comic', 'book', 'predecessors', 'followed', 'religiously', 'movie', 'form', 'superhero', 'sequel', 'Hero', 'reeling', 'events', 'previous', 'film', 'where', 'defeated', 'villain', 'mainly', 'came', 'out', 'top', 'Superhero', 'enjoying', 'life', 'mainly', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'New', 'villain', 'town', 'screws', 'things', 'up', 'superhero', 'Superhero', 'ultimately', 'villain', 'loved', 'ones', 'End', 'titles.', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '34', 'continuation', 'Marc', 'Webb', '8217', 's', '2012', 'reboot', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'doesn', '8217', 'really', 'follow', 'said', 'formula', 'better', 'worse.Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'odd', 'on-again-off-again', 'true', 'love', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'enjoying', 'public', 'admiration', 'Max', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'villain', 'Electro', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'trouble', 'too', 'kind', 'glossed', 'make', 'room', 'Electro.Andrew', 'Garfield', 'did', 'better', 'Spider-Man', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'first', 'film', 'reboots', 'one', 'almost', 'death', 'acting', 'abilities', 'big', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'end', 'film', 'odd', 'way', 'delivering', 'normal', 'lines', 'earlier', 'portion', 'film', 'really', 'off-putting', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'actor', 'sank', 'so', 'fast', 'length', 'one', 'movie', 'However', 'said', 'important', 'scenes', 'end', 'well.Supporting', 'actors', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'have', 'nice', 'moments', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'glossed', 'over', 'movies', 'major', 'plot', 'event', 'film', '8217', 's', 'third', 'act', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'saw', 'coming', 'almost', 'ruined', 'film', 'something', 'movies', 'don', '8217', 'tend', 'do', 'give', 'Webb', 'writers', 'credit', 'staying', 'true', 'what', 'was', 'comics', 'same', 'time', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'think', 'shouldn', '8217', 'have.The', 'film', 'also', 'iffy-at-best', 'job', 'showing', 'Max', 'Dillon', '8217', 'journey', 'normal', 'guy', 'villain', 'get', 'idea', 'guy', 'never', 'wanted', 'hurt', 'anybody', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'audience', 'supposed', 'react', 'accordingly', 'villain', 'when', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'know', 'full', 'story', 'Overall', 'left', 'movie', 'not', 'thinking', 'was', 'massive', 'improvement', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'second', 'film', 'previous', 'Spider-Man', 'trilogy', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'continuation', 'first', 'one', 'commercial', 'next', 'film', 'commercial', 'Sony', 'Netflix', 'Blu-Ray', 'everything', 'illuminated', 'lights', 'Times', 'Square', 'pivotal', 'battle', 'scene', 'Product', 'placement', 'kind', 'ruined', 'mood', 'scene', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'bigger', 'things', 'audience', '8217', 'mind', '8217', 'not', 'saying', '8217', 'done', 'films', 'really', 'need', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'third', 'installment.Grade', 'C+']",N/A
1696776,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00JKPHUE0,M. Oleson,"[3, 7]","Theatrical review.I was somewhat mystified as to why Spider-Man had to be re-started back in 2010, but I admit I liked the movie for the fresh enthusiasm Andrew Garfield brought to Peter Parker's Spidie transformation.  I'm not one of those haters who criticized the Tobey Maguire/Kirsten Dunst chemistry, but I have to admit that Garfield and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy have something special.  The fact that they are off-screen romantic partners probably helps.  In fact, the best scenes in this movie are when they are together.  For me the banter and the development of their characters is essential in the story line, especially in the final act.I was also taken with Sally Field as Peter's Aunt May who finally gives Peter some answers about his parent's disappearance years ago.  In fact we learn about those events in the excellent opening sequence, shown in flashback.  Director Marc Webb, perhaps best known for the fine romantic comedy ""(500) Days of Summer,"" seems to have a good handle on the many action sequences.  The traditional chase sequence follows the flashback and is pretty dumb.This is where we meet one of the 3 villains, Rhino/Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who is making a run for it in an armored car after stealing some sort of radioactive material.  That is followed by villain number 2, Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) and finally Green Goblin/Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan).  To be sure the film has one too many bad guys that poor Spidie has to deal with.  It adds nothing to the current story other than an extra 30 minutes that I could have done without.  Action freaks would probably want to slash some of the more intimate moments in the mid-section.  Still there is plenty for everybody and provides for a good sequel in this series.",4,Pretty amazing too,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1768,"['Theatrical', 'review.I', 'was', 'somewhat', 'mystified', 'why', 'Spider-Man', 'had', 'be', 're-started', 'back', '2010', 'admit', 'liked', 'movie', 'fresh', 'enthusiasm', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'brought', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spidie', 'transformation', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'haters', 'who', 'criticized', 'Tobey', 'Maguire/Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'chemistry', 'have', 'admit', 'Garfield', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'have', 'something', 'special', 'fact', 'are', 'off-screen', 'romantic', 'partners', 'probably', 'fact', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'when', 'are', 'together', 'banter', 'development', 'characters', 'essential', 'story', 'line', 'especially', 'final', 'act.I', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Peter', 'Aunt', 'May', 'who', 'finally', 'Peter', 'answers', 'parent', 'disappearance', 'years', 'ago', 'fact', 'learn', 'events', 'excellent', 'opening', 'sequence', 'shown', 'flashback', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'fine', 'romantic', 'comedy', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'have', 'good', 'handle', 'many', 'action', 'sequences', 'traditional', 'chase', 'sequence', 'flashback', 'pretty', 'dumb.This', 'where', 'meet', 'one', '3', 'villains', 'Rhino/Aleksei', 'Sytsevich', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'making', 'run', 'armored', 'car', 'stealing', 'sort', 'radioactive', 'material', 'followed', 'villain', 'number', '2', 'Electro/Max', 'Dillon', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'finally', 'Green', 'Goblin/Harry', 'Osborn', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'guys', 'poor', 'Spidie', 'deal', 'nothing', 'current', 'story', 'other', 'extra', '30', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Action', 'freaks', 'would', 'probably', 'want', 'slash', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'mid-section', 'Still', 'plenty', 'everybody', 'good', 'sequel', 'series']",N/A

Does that mean it's great? No, it's still horribly weak and flawed, but at least it seemed to have a purpose, even if it was executed poorly. Amazing Spidey 2 didn't seem to have a purpose. It was more of a teenage soap opera than a superhero flick, focusing more on the personal issues that Gwen and Peter are going through instead of fleshing out both characters and telling a halfway decent story.There were some good action scenes though. I particularly liked the battle(s) with Electro, though I didn't care much for him as a villain. Jamie Foxx does pretty well in his portrayal though.Also, I'm not a fan of the re-imagined Harry Osborn / Goblin at all. Instead of coming off as an arrogant piehole, this version comes off as a whiny and annoying.brat. Franco pulled off Harry's smugness just perfectly in the Raimiverse movies. And, maybe it's just me, but I also find Garfield's Parker more of a wimp than Maguire's. Of course Maguire's Parker had his moments too, but, always seemed to redeem himself. Garfield's Parker has that too, but it only seems to pop up when someone pries it out of him.Finally, the climax just drove me batty. Yeah, sad, but it seemed like such a cop out to me, so disappointing.Concluding analysis is: It's an OK movie, but it's a one dimensional movie choosing relationship issues over actual character development.

I liked this movie more than I thought I would. It&#8217;s thoughtful, character-driven, and is perhaps the most human superhero movie I&#8217;ve seen. They changed a few things from the &#8220;official&#8221; Spider-man mythology, so of course, Marvel purist fans that can&#8217;t handle change will howl.2. The movie has a lot of storylines going at the same time - Peter being Spider-man; Peter&#8217;s conflicted relationship with his girlfriend; the mystery of Peter&#8217;s father and his secret project; the introduction of Harry Osborne on his way to becoming the Green Goblin; and the creation of Electro. This makes the movie seem a little rushed sometimes (there is even a scene in the official trailer that would have added another subplot, but it doesn't appear in the actual movie).3. The acting in this movie is awesome, particularly for a superhero movie. Almost everyone really nails their character, especially Andrew Garfield. He made Peter a real, confused, normal young man with a lot of issues.4. Jamie Foxx is great as the mentally unstable electrical engineer that turns into electricity or whatever. From the trailer, I thought he would suck, but he turned out to be one of the best villains in this Spider-man world, because they gave him a really empathetic backstory.5. The action scenes are great. The whole movie is beautiful to watch, and there are some really cool 3D parts. Especially the Electro scenes.6. For a movie that is almost 2 hours long, there are relatively few action sequences. There is a bigger focus on character development and drama. While some people may find it boring, I thought it was refreshing and interesting.7. I usually hate romantic subplots, but the story of Peter and Gwen worked for me. They had real chemistry, and they made me actually feel for them.8. The only thing I really hated about the movie is Spider-man&#8217;s stupid little jokes and one-liners. They really pulled me out of the movie. I mean, can&#8217;t we have a super-hero that isn&#8217;t a cheesy smart-ass when he talks to bad guys?9. The movie is ostensibly about hope (it gets hammered into us repeatedly). But below the surface, the movie is really about abandonment, betrayal, helplessness, and coming to terms with the fact that you can&#8217;t save everyone, no matter how superheroic you may be.",4,"A thoughtful, human superhero movie",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,2416,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', '8221', 'USA', '2014', '1', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'thought', 'would', '8217', 'thoughtful', 'character-driven', 'perhaps', 'most', 'human', 'superhero', 'movie', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'changed', 'few', 'things', '8220', 'official', '8221', 'Spider-man', 'mythology', 'course', 'Marvel', 'purist', 'fans', 'can', '8217', 'handle', 'change', 'will', 'howl.2', 'movie', 'lot', 'storylines', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'Peter', 'being', 'Spider-man', 'Peter', '8217', 'conflicted', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'mystery', 'Peter', '8217', 'father', 'secret', 'project', 'introduction', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'way', 'becoming', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'creation', 'Electro', 'movie', 'seem', 'little', 'rushed', 'sometimes', 'even', 'scene', 'official', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'subplot', ""n't"", 'appear', 'actual', 'movie', '.3', 'acting', 'movie', 'awesome', 'particularly', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'really', 'character', 'especially', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'made', 'Peter', 'real', 'confused', 'normal', 'young', 'man', 'lot', 'issues.4', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'great', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'electricity', 'trailer', 'thought', 'would', 'suck', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'Spider-man', 'world', 'gave', 'really', 'empathetic', 'backstory.5', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'whole', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'are', 'really', 'cool', '3D', 'parts', 'Especially', 'Electro', 'scenes.6', 'movie', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'bigger', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'drama', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'boring', 'thought', 'was', 'refreshing', 'interesting.7', 'usually', 'hate', 'romantic', 'subplots', 'story', 'Peter', 'Gwen', 'worked', 'had', 'real', 'chemistry', 'made', 'actually', 'feel', 'them.8', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'hated', 'movie', 'Spider-man', '8217', 'stupid', 'little', 'jokes', 'one-liners', 'really', 'pulled', 'movie', 'mean', 'can', '8217', 't', 'have', 'super-hero', 'isn', '8217', 'cheesy', 'smart-ass', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', '9', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'hope', 'hammered', 'repeatedly', 'surface', 'movie', 'really', 'abandonment', 'betrayal', 'helplessness', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'can', '8217', 'save', 'everyone', 'matter', 'how', 'superheroic', 'may', 'be']",N/A

Electro was played out to be a huge part of this movie yet there are two scenes he is actually featured in, the last one being the only significant one...which just happened to be the only action packed 30 minutes of the movie not interrupted with some mundane and poorly written drama scene. It actually reminded me a lot of a Twilight movie, but at least Twilight is not under the guise of an action film. And it is amazing that despite Peter Parker going through all of this drama he can still crack stupid jokes while fighting bad guys. The corny jokes were pretty bad this time around, most not worth even a chuckle. The film tries to be darker like the latest Batman series, yet still continues attempts at poorly placed humor that just is not funny.I actually enjoyed the first one and the darker side it took from the cheesy first Spider man films, but this one was just bad.

I waited for the DVD so I could see it at home.Quite frankly, it was extremely forgettable for a debut showing reboot of a much beloved franchise. I had a different feeling about this one, call it spidey sense, but I knew I would not have to endure another blossoming report of how it all began, once again, as I am overly exhausted at superhero origins movies, something the Hollywood nerds are overly stuck on, but at least they get on with it eventually.And it was in 3D, a feature I am now absolutely hooked onI could watch a two hour version of a non stop action superhero battle without any emotional set up or backdrop and be totally happy. I don't need to venture any further into the making of a criminal, or for that matter, the making of a superhero, just give me those spectacular superhero effects of which this movie has plenty of, the 3D Electro electrical scenes were brilliant.Andrew Garfield himself is an amazing actor, and he does spidey as well as he fits in that suit. Emma Stone is an amazing actress and it's a pity what they did do her character as she was much more highly digestible than the Mary Jane character of previous because MJ was an emotional wreck having to deal with bitter home life and a failing career.I wish Hollywood would continue these cinematic glories as they are very fun to watch, and extremely entertaining, & even breathtaking.

Having said that, ASM 2 is a movie with a little bit of everything, lots of action, romance, comedy, tragedy, hope, and more action.What Works?-- The acting is very good. Pretty much across the board. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a real chemistry, and Jamie Foxx allows the viewer to follow along with his character's evolution from comic relief to dangerous threat. Dane DeHaan was new to me, but I thought he was excellent.-- The special effects are phenomenal. I am not a fan of 3D movies, but this should be seen in 3D, as it is probably the best 3D effects I can recall seeing. The motion of web-swinging scenes is a little frenetic, particularly early on, but it smooths out.-- Lots of little dropped names and visuals in the background, planting seeds for future movies.What Didn't Work?-- Peter's quest to learn more about his parents is a plot that gets a lot of airtime, but didn't seem to further the overall story. It just felt like it was there to create a mystery that didn't serve a purpose or have an acceptable payoff.-- There are some serious heavy moments, one of which really stalls out the joy and adventure in the film. This cost the movie a five star review from me.All told, this is a *very* good movie, which I wish had a slightly edited plot, so as not to derail the great momentum that was built for the movie and the franchise. Because of the effects, it should be seen on the movie screen, and in 3D or IMAX, or whatever fancy options are available. I don't often say that about movies, but this one deserves it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,"Non-Spoiler - Phenomenal effects, great acting, emotion all over the place",1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1722,"['hard', 'review', 'write', 'discussing', 'movie', 'what', 'work', 'not', 'spoiling', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'do', 'Having', 'said', 'ASM', '2', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'lots', 'action', 'romance', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'hope', 'more', 'action.What', 'Works', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Pretty', 'much', 'board', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'viewer', 'follow', 'along', 'character', 'evolution', 'comic', 'relief', 'dangerous', 'threat', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'was', 'new', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent.', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'am', 'not', 'fan', '3D', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'seen', '3D', 'probably', 'best', '3D', 'effects', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'motion', 'web-swinging', 'scenes', 'little', 'frenetic', 'particularly', 'early', 'out.', 'Lots', 'little', 'dropped', 'names', 'visuals', 'background', 'planting', 'seeds', 'future', 'movies.What', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Work', 'Peter', 'quest', 'learn', 'more', 'parents', 'plot', 'lot', 'airtime', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'further', 'overall', 'story', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'create', 'mystery', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'purpose', 'have', 'acceptable', 'payoff.', 'are', 'serious', 'heavy', 'moments', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'joy', 'adventure', 'film', 'cost', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'review', 'me.All', 'told', '*very*', 'good', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'slightly', 'edited', 'plot', 'so', 'not', 'derail', 'great', 'momentum', 'was', 'built', 'movie', 'franchise', 'effects', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'screen', '3D', 'IMAX', 'fancy', 'options', 'are', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'say', 'about', 'movies', 'one', 'it.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

I did like the Sam Raimi versions, but this actor has really gotten down the wisecracking wallcrawler down pat.The story is one of relationships, of making decisions and of paying the consequences, some of which are not that great.There are many deviations from the original comic book story by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, but I am happy with the whole Gwen Stacy/Peter Parker story.  Unlike the Raimi films that concentrated on Mary Jane Watson, it was Gwen who was one of Peter&#8217;s very first loves (yeah, Betty Brant was there too, but I digress).Another variation is that they&#8217;re not high school kids but college grads.  Gwen makes a great valedictorian speech about hope and about what to do when there is every reason to give up.Another subplot deals with Peter&#8217;s dad, Richard Parker.  Why was he abandoned?  Why was Peter left with thinking his dad was a bad guy?Plots!Wait, am I describing a comic book movie or what?One thing about this film is that a general audience who has a passing interest in comics will like the film.  Women will likely love the Peter/Gwen relationship, and how the ghost of Capt. Stacy gets in the way of Peter&#8217;s decisions regarding her.Guys will like the wallcrawler spinning through NYC, capturing the bad guys and being interesting in the corporate plans of Oscorp, an ostentatiously benign group that has been working on plans for domination, making a better world through intimidation perhaps.Bullied!Jamie Fox is great as the unwitting subject of an experiment that turns him into Electro, who becomes an intelligent force of Nature.  How will Spidey defeat him?  And the Goblin, Harry Osborn, also at the short end of the stick when it comes to be accepted by those who matter most.  I hope there is more of him to come.  Lots of potential here.Secret labs, a crazy Harry Osborn who has a fatal disease, the Goblin as you&#8217;ve never seen him and some hints that a Doc Octopus or a Vulture is in the works (check out the secret lab with its armored tentacles or the vulture-like wingspan on display).Listen to the ringtone, old timers.  Guess from where that is?Final Word:  And check Sally Field &#8211; she has not lost her flare for drama as an Aunt May who knows her boy is not her bio son, but she raised him that way.  Pretty powerful performance.Check it out.  And stay through the credits!  Amazing how people still walk out when there is so much more to know about our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.A mid-credit scene, but my theater did not have an end-of credit scene.Go see it!  See the first film first, as that will fill in the gaps in discussions regarding the Lizard and what he was all about.",5,Does Whatever a Spider Can!,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,2749,"['Review', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', '2Wow', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'versions', 'actor', 'really', 'gotten', 'down', 'wisecracking', 'wallcrawler', 'down', 'pat.The', 'story', 'one', 'relationships', 'making', 'decisions', 'paying', 'consequences', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'many', 'deviations', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'am', 'happy', 'whole', 'Gwen', 'Stacy/Peter', 'Parker', 'story', 'Raimi', 'films', 'concentrated', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'was', 'Gwen', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'Peter', '8217', 's', 'very', 'first', 'loves', 'yeah', 'Betty', 'Brant', 'was', 'there', 'too', 'digress', '.Another', 'variation', '8217', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'college', 'grads', 'Gwen', 'great', 'valedictorian', 'speech', 'hope', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'reason', 'give', 'up.Another', 'subplot', 'deals', 'Peter', '8217', 'dad', 'Richard', 'Parker', 'Why', 'was', 'abandoned', 'Why', 'was', 'Peter', 'left', 'thinking', 'dad', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'Plots', 'Wait', 'am', 'describing', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'what', 'One', 'thing', 'film', 'general', 'audience', 'who', 'passing', 'interest', 'comics', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'Women', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'Peter/Gwen', 'relationship', 'how', 'ghost', 'Capt', 'Stacy', 'way', 'Peter', '8217', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'her.Guys', 'will', 'like', 'wallcrawler', 'spinning', 'NYC', 'capturing', 'bad', 'guys', 'being', 'interesting', 'corporate', 'plans', 'Oscorp', 'ostentatiously', 'benign', 'group', 'been', 'working', 'plans', 'domination', 'making', 'better', 'world', 'intimidation', 'perhaps.Bullied', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'great', 'unwitting', 'subject', 'experiment', 'Electro', 'who', 'intelligent', 'force', 'Nature', 'How', 'will', 'Spidey', 'defeat', 'Goblin', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'also', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'when', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'matter', 'most', 'hope', 'more', 'come', 'Lots', 'potential', 'here.Secret', 'labs', 'crazy', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'who', 'fatal', 'disease', 'Goblin', '8217', 'never', 'seen', 'hints', 'Doc', 'Octopus', 'Vulture', 'works', 'check', 'out', 'secret', 'lab', 'armored', 'tentacles', 'vulture-like', 'wingspan', 'display', 'ringtone', 'old', 'timers', 'Guess', 'where', 'Final', 'Word', 'check', 'Sally', 'Field', '8211', 'not', 'lost', 'flare', 'drama', 'Aunt', 'May', 'who', 'boy', 'not', 'bio', 'son', 'raised', 'way', 'Pretty', 'powerful', 'performance.Check', 'out', 'stay', 'credits', 'Amazing', 'how', 'people', 'still', 'walk', 'out', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'know', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spiderman.A', 'mid-credit', 'scene', 'theater', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'end-of', 'credit', 'scene.Go', 'see', 'See', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'will', 'fill', 'gaps', 'discussions', 'regarding', 'Lizard', 'what', 'was']",N/A

I enjoyed the first but it just felt like it was lacking sustenance. Yes it was a good reboot. Yes it stayed true to the character. And yes it was &#34;Amazing&#34; (see what I did there? haha). But, ASM2 surpassed it by far. Director Marc Webb took what worked for the first and mastered it for the second. The action was in your face. The web slinging was true to character. And there was a lot more depth to this movie. Andrew Garfield this time around was in his comfort zone and portrayed Spider Man I believe in ways that other guy couldn't. (Yes I know his name is Toby Maguire). I mean he did satisfactory because he was the first to play the web crawler, but Garfield in MY opinion is a better fit the role. Jamie Foxx did a FANTASTIC Electro. Paul Giamatti was , meh, as Rhino. I just felt his Russian acting was a bit corny. Last but not least the two main characters that I think stole the show were Dane DeHaan and Emma Stone who played Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy respectively. They were the connection to Peter and they it was perfectly executed. The broken Friendship and the Broken Relationship played on Peter's emotions to the point he almost gave up and that to me made for better story telling. So here are my likes and dislikes of the film.Pro's:- The action was on point.- Graphics were phenomenal.- The Relationship between Peter and Gwen had more depth and felt more real.- The villains made sense and didn't feel like they were thrown in just for a royal rumble.- Movie had me actually tear up at the end. It was well executed.- Stayed true to the comics (not spoiling it for you)Cons:- The movie seemed lacking in Fluidity between scenes. There were no easy transitions- Rhino was mediocre at best. Very corny.- There was no MAIN Villain. I kinda wished it was someone in the shadows working the angles rather than a couple people coming together because they disliked Spider-Man.All in all I give this movie a solid 8.7/10. It was very enjoyable and I believe this time around it was done right. Sure it has it's flaws but the positives outweighed the negatives. GO SEE IT!",4,Great Sequel.

1696789,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00JKPHUE0,StrangePegs,"[4, 10]","Let me just state right here at the beginning that I am still not in favor of Sony's reboot of the Spider-Man franchise; however, seeing that they have, and that this movie is based off of the previous (un)Amazing movie and not Raimi's series, I have to say... okay, I'll sum it up like this: This one made me tear up.I think I've mentioned before that I don't cry at movies.I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but I am going to talk a bit about the set up. More movies need a good exposition; it sets up the emotional impact.There's a significant difference between &#34;starting in the middle of the action&#34; and starting in the middle of some action. Increasingly, &#34;starting in the middle of the action&#34; is a bad thing to do. AS2 chooses to start in the middle of some action, the obligatory car chase. This action scene, though, serves as the setup for much of the rest of the movie: we see that Peter is haunted by the death Captain Stacy (and his admonition to safeguard Gwen by staying away from her), Spider-Man saves Max Dillon (though, in one of the few just nonsensical moments in the movie, he stops to save this one guy from getting hit by a car while doing nothing to stop the dozens of cars that are being destroyed), and we are introduced to Aleksei Sytsevich.This scene sets up two of the three major conflicts for the movie: the romantic conflict between Peter and Gwen, and the physical conflict between Spider-Man and Electro. The third conflict revolves around Peter's continued exploration into the deaths of his parents, a story line they are developing at a nice pace and are handling better than expected. [This is spoilery, but, being someone who never knew his father, the scene between Peter and May was excellent. His assertion to her in the face of her reluctance to tell him anything that &#34;it's not about you&#34; is so right.]And that's as far as I can go without giving things away but, from an emotional standpoint, this movie is way beyond the first one. Garfield really brings you along on his emotional ride as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, and I don't think that's a small thing. Like I said, I teared up.Emma Stone put in a great performance as Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx was much better as Max Dillon than as Electro, although it's hard to tell how much of anything he did as Electro. Dane DeHaan put in a convincing enough Harry Osborn [although I'm not sure how I feel about them bringing that character in as Peter's &#34;best friend&#34; when they hadn't seen each other in a decade]. And Paul Giamatti was almost unrecognizable as the Russian thug Aleksei Sytsevich. Sally Field continues to not really do it for as Aunt May, but I'll give her a pass, sort of, for that one scene with Peter about his parents.Also, kudos for introducing us to the character of Felicia, whom I have to suppose is Felicia Hardy and the future Black Cat.The only real flub of the movie is a stupid science thing they did during a discussion about spiders and how spiders have cells that can &#34;self repair&#34; while humans don't. If humans' cells couldn't self repair, we'd all die the first time we got a cut or a broken bone or whatever. Sure, they're trying to talk about the rapid-style healing/regeneration of, like, Wolverine, but they do it in a piss-poor manner that makes it sound like people can't heal from, well, anything.But that moment aside, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better movie than its predecessor.

The fans (AKA fanatics) approach the movie story of their hero in tights with memories of past comic books, going over the character's history like scriptural literalists cross-checking every passage. A misplaced comma might be equated with blasphemy. Most amusingly, literal faithfulness and realism are often demanded in movies about characters who started off wearing underwear outside of their pants. If a critic dares to say something negative about the funny-paper deity, they may receive death threats, as did the first professional critic who publicly panned Dark Knight Rises (and never mind that said critic was right).  Of course, the fanboys may only resort to mockery, as they did with Roger Ebert, ridiculing him for dying of cancer, when he dared to give a negative review to Thor (2011). These are the Marvel and DC Taliban; their behavior is so nonsensical it is mind-boggling.It is perhaps ironic (or perhaps not) to find as much of a level of obsessiveness over characters created by modern Westerners as over those created by ancient Jewish writers. Primitive figures spun from tribal tales have been replaced by Superman, Batman, and Spiderman. We get just as offended by liberties taken with the Caped Crusader as we do liberties taken with Noah. We root for Hulk to wallop puny false gods with the same hip-hip-hooray we afforded Mel's Lethal Jesus taking one more bloody blow to prove how much of a true ""guts and glory"" God he is. Ben Affleck as Batman is as heterodox as a wimpy eco-friendly deity who has the audacity to care about the world he created.Spiderman should be the hero least prone to this type of obsessiveness. He is not like Superman, doused in all that sloppy pious savior mythology. Nor is he is a brooding billionaire crusader for truth like the Dark Knight. Peter Parker, as created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, was an idiosyncratic angst-filled teen who had everyday problems like the rest of us. He was never destined for canonization .John Semper, producer of ""Spiderman: The Animated Series"" (1994-1998) perhaps said it best: ""It does not matter who Spiderman's villain is. What matters is Peter Parker can't pay the rent and has girlfriend problems."" That's pretty simple advice to remember, which Spiderman 3 (2007), with its smorgasbord of villains, failed to heed. Director Sam Raimi had already  delivered two financial, critical hits. Rather than trust Rami's track record, Sony interfered, and the result was franchise implosion. Amazingly, Amazing Spiderman 2 (2014) failed to learn that lesson, and delivers the worst film to date about a super arachnid.The first sign of a here-we-go-again bad omen with Amazing Spiderman 2 is the presence of seven writers credited for the screenplay. That many writers working on Green Lantern (2011) indicated movie-making by committee, and it turned out to be just that. The plethora of chefs here deliver a stale Snickers bar with the guts squeezed out, which is surprising since the Amazing Spiderman (2012) at least seemed to be aware of what had gone wrong in Spiderman 3 and went some distance towards correcting the misstep.Andrew Garfield returns as Peter Parker, and he has angst in his spandex regarding girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). In the first film of the reboot series, Stone's Stacy proved a better love interest than Kristin Dunst's self-pitying, eye-lash batting Mary Jane. At the end of Amazing Spiderman, it seemed that Parker's promise to distance himself from Stacy had been resolved. However, in the sequel, we are subjected to an extended rehash of that promise. Parker also has the backstory of his parents to contend with. That backstory was the reboot's most pointless addition, but at least it was kept to a minimum. Here, it receives full blown treatment. Aunt May (Sally Field) has become a suburban bore, but she solicits more sympathy than her nephew, who has already lost much of his charm. The scenes with Parker and Stacy are what the film is really about, or rather, should be. However, that set-up is mostly squandered for something that begs description. Pressed, a synopsis could possibly be found, by why would one want to?Amazing Spiderman 2 is akin to Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin (1997): an aluminum Christmas tree on circuit overload. Seldom has so much excess been thrown onto a screen. The answer for such a mess, at least the answer for returning director Marc Webb, is big-name stars. Here, Jamie Foxx, as Electro, fills the same sort of shoes Sir Arnold wore as Mr. Freeze. Joining Foxx in the super-villain team-up is Paul Giamatti as a metallic rhinoceros and Dane DeHaan as an emaciated Goblin.  Webb proves as inept as Schumacher or Zach Snyder at handling action sequences, and we feel his lethargy, gorging on AC/DC colored CGI. With a solid dramatic base, such gluttony would be forgivable, except the dramatic elements here are as apathetically handled, with far too many witless one-liners used as exclamation points. Stone, who was the freshest thing about the first film, is wasted here.It would be easy to dismiss this as a video game (as opposed to a movie), except that games are supposed to be fun. The only people who may find any joy in Amazing Spiderman 2 are unimaginative, in-denial Marvel fundamentalists; but whether those folks are really human or not is open to debate.

1696794,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B00JKPHUE0,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 5]","TASM2 is a superhero flick that's far more concerned about the emotional relationships of its main characters over the pyrotechnics and flashiness of the superheroics and fighting, though you still get a lot of that too.TASM2 strikes an emotional chord with its two leads Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).  Their late teen young love relationship is believable and feels like it runs deep.  Parker, concerned for Stacy's safety and haunted by the promise he made to Captain Stacy, her father, at the time of his death continues to try to distance himself from her in order to keep her from harm's way.  And he's a bit miserable for it.  Stacy too is unhappy about this and her strong independence slaps Parker's pushing away across his face; she loves him and will not be denied and the two cannot stay away from each other for long.  Emma Stone is a bright light in this surprisingly dark tale (though punctuated with timely Spidey action and more classic Spidey verbal snarkiness), conveying warmth and fidelity and longing and determination through her incredibly expressive face and vulnerable eyes.  Andrew Garfield is tasked with being funny, coy, and conflicted and thus has the more difficult acting role here; he does a pretty good job with it.While Parker and Stacy's on-again off-again relationship is at the heart of this film and comprises a huge portion of this tale of love and loss there is also the backstory of Peter's parents, his relationship with aunt May, and a boyhood relationship with Harry Osborn that also spin our heads with additional stories of love and loss.  There's possibly a bit too much thrown in with all of this adding with it not just the film's central &#34;villain&#34; Electro (I enclose &#34;villain&#34; in quotes because here we have Jamie Foxx playing a social outcast who also seems mentally ill--or is he a social outcast because he's mentally ill? the film doesn't ask or attempt to answer this question--as a person who develops a megalomaniacal complex not in line with any classic villain who is &#34;bad&#34; because they don't care about the suffering of others) but also brings in the Rhino too little and too late and gives a short and unsatisfying span of time to (yet again) the Green Goblin.The performances with these characters are fine, engaging even, and though this SM iteration doesn't throw them all into the stew at the same time as Spider-man 3 had it still ends up feeling like a case of overload (I couldn't resist an electrical pun) or crowding out the film unnecessarily.  Mind you this film handles it much better than SM3 plied it.  There are also several pieces set in place for future films and for the rumored spin-off movie &#34;Sinister Six&#34; but these are likely only to be spied by the eyes of comic book fandom and not by the casual eyes of the general moviegoer.My last comment is a caution to the adults with particularly young children who will want to be seeing this film (the trailers for it are simply great): this is a much less family-friendly Spider-Man movie with far darker elements, including the surprisingly violent opening of the movie that would be especially difficult for a child to place in context of the larger film.  Parents may want to heed the PG-13 rating in this case (not much language and no sex though) and view it themselves before showing it to the under 10 set.3.75 stars.",4,Spinning a web of love and loss.,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,3415,"['TASM2', 'superhero', 'flick', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'emotional', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'pyrotechnics', 'flashiness', 'superheroics', 'fighting', 'still', 'get', 'lot', 'too.TASM2', 'emotional', 'chord', 'two', 'leads', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'late', 'teen', 'young', 'love', 'relationship', 'believable', 'feels', 'deep', 'Parker', 'concerned', 'Stacy', 'safety', 'haunted', 'promise', 'made', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'father', 'time', 'death', 'try', 'distance', 'order', 'keep', 'harm', 'way', 'bit', 'miserable', 'Stacy', 'too', 'unhappy', 'strong', 'independence', 'slaps', 'Parker', 'pushing', 'away', 'face', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'two', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'away', 'other', 'long', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'bright', 'light', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'tale', 'punctuated', 'timely', 'Spidey', 'action', 'more', 'classic', 'Spidey', 'verbal', 'snarkiness', 'conveying', 'warmth', 'fidelity', 'longing', 'determination', 'incredibly', 'expressive', 'face', 'vulnerable', 'eyes', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'tasked', 'being', 'funny', 'coy', 'conflicted', 'thus', 'more', 'difficult', 'acting', 'role', 'here', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'it.While', 'Parker', 'Stacy', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'heart', 'film', 'huge', 'portion', 'tale', 'love', 'loss', 'also', 'backstory', 'Peter', 'parents', 'relationship', 'aunt', 'May', 'boyhood', 'relationship', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'also', 'spin', 'heads', 'additional', 'stories', 'love', 'loss', 'possibly', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'thrown', 'adding', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'central', '34', 'villain', '34', 'Electro', 'enclose', '34', 'villain', '34', 'quotes', 'here', 'have', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'playing', 'social', 'outcast', 'who', 'also', 'mentally', 'ill', 'social', 'outcast', 'mentally', 'ill', 'film', ""n't"", 'ask', 'attempt', 'answer', 'question', 'person', 'who', 'megalomaniacal', 'complex', 'not', 'line', 'classic', 'villain', 'who', '34', 'bad', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'suffering', 'others', 'also', 'Rhino', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'short', 'unsatisfying', 'span', 'time', 'yet', 'again', 'Green', 'Goblin.The', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'engaging', 'even', 'SM', 'iteration', ""n't"", 'throw', 'stew', 'same', 'time', 'Spider-man', '3', 'had', 'still', 'up', 'feeling', 'case', 'overload', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'electrical', 'pun', 'crowding', 'out', 'film', 'unnecessarily', 'Mind', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'SM3', 'plied', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'pieces', 'set', 'place', 'future', 'films', 'rumored', 'spin-off', 'movie', '34', 'Sinister', 'Six', '34', 'are', 'likely', 'only', 'be', 'spied', 'eyes', 'comic', 'book', 'fandom', 'not', 'casual', 'eyes', 'general', 'moviegoer.My', 'last', 'comment', 'caution', 'adults', 'particularly', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'seeing', 'film', 'trailers', 'are', 'simply', 'great', 'much', 'less', 'family-friendly', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'far', 'darker', 'elements', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'violent', 'opening', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'difficult', 'child', 'place', 'context', 'larger', 'film', 'Parents', 'may', 'want', 'heed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'case', 'not', 'much', 'language', 'sex', 'view', 'showing', '10', 'set.3.75', 'stars']",N/A

1696797,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B00JKPHUE0,William Kendall,"[1, 5]","After a brief interlude set in the past, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 starts off with a bang, featuring our hero Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) chasing down a Russian named Aleksei (Paul Giamatti) involved in a heist. He happens to save the life of an engineer at OsCorp, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), while bringing down his quarry. Peter's been at the hero game for awhile, working as a photographer, dealing with a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and feeling guilty over the death of her father (Denis Leary), what with the police captain showing up in visions warning him to stay away from Gwen.As is usually the case in these matters, fate steps in as a childhood friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to Manhattan to visit his dying father Norman (Chris Cooper). With the passing of the old man, Harry takes on the mantle of the company and quickly starts showing us an unpleasant side (it's an Osborn thing). Max, meanwhile, goes from socially awkward to something else entirely in an accident involving electric eels and ends up a powerhouse generating his own electricity. Thus sets the stage for Peter to swing into action, with lives at stake, more than one villain to tangle with, and his very blood being sought after. So, another day in the life of Peter Parker.Director Marc Webb returns from the first film, bringing along a committee of four writers for the story, which at times feels like it's setting up the stage for the next movie (this happens, of course, when you're dealing with a franchise). Nonetheless, they turn back to the comics for inspiration, and that's a good source. Perhaps even more than Peter's driving motto &#34;with great power comes great responsibility&#34; is the character's sense of guilt. It starts with the death of his uncle, a death he could have prevented, the motivating factor for the rest of his life. The writers play that out in how Peter relates to his aunt May (Sally Field), and in the guilt he feels over the death of Captain Stacy, whose apparition lingers about like the ghost of Hamlet's father. They also take the dynamics of Peter's relationship with Gwen, and the friendship with Harry, from the comics, moving things in different directions. It's a bit convoluted at times- and I say that as a comics fan. The better moments of the film are not those sweeping special effect sequences, but the personal and the human.The special effects crews do well with their work. Where physical filming leaves off, they seamlessly weave in CGI as needed, and the combined effect does well, as it did in the first film, of giving us a wall crawler swinging his way through the streets of New York. More importantly, the way the new villains are rendered works. The primary villain in all of this is Electro, looking different from his comic book origins. The way he uses electricity is dynamic, and the special effects team render that well, giving him a look that's spooky. The crew also do much the same for the encore appearance of Aleksei, sporting a techno-armour that might make Iron Man think twice. Where the appearance of the Rhino in the comics just wouldn't work in the movies, rendering the character operating essentially a lumbering tank is a more inspired choice. And we get a Green Goblin out of the mix, with a character design that's more fitting and deranged than the two Goblins of the Sam Raimi trilogy.The cast is well suited to their roles. Sally Field returns as Aunt May, still younger than the ancient crone in the comics (letters of outrage can be sent to my idiot ex-brother-in-law). She's in mourning of course, and worries about her nephew, continuing to play the role with understated strength, wisdom, and patience. Cooper, one of my favourite actors, is a surprise in only making a brief appearance as Norman Osborn. Instead of playing the role as flat out crazy as Willem Dafoe did in the first Raimi film, he goes for reserved as a dying man, while hiding many secrets that will come out as time goes along. Colm Feore turns up as well. He's one of those character actors you've seen in countless films and series, and he plays an OsCorp executive here, with the gravity you'd expect from the actor. Marton Csokas, another character actor who appeared in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, turns up playing a director of a high-security mental hospital.The trio of villains bring different strengths to their roles. Paul Giamatti is a terrific character actor whose turn here is brief, but book ends the start and end of the film. When we first meet him as Aleksei, he's a temper tantrum having a bad day when a heist goes wrong, something that we might expect out of the character as we know him from the comics. Giamatti can certainly convey anger and rage, and he does that in spades here, and at the end of the film when we see him in armour as an unexpected Rhino. DeHaan was new to me in this film. He plays Harry Osborn in different ways, which fits the character's history. There's a tormented side to him with a difficult history with his father. He seems most like himself when he meets Peter again and they're just relating to each other as friends. But he takes a different path, and DeHaan must convey his descent into darkness in a way that makes sense. He does so, and I'd like to see more out of him. Foxx is perhaps the biggest surprise among the new players. This is an actor who has hits and misses in his resume, but when he's good, he's very good. Performances in Ray or The Kingdom have established his credentials and his range. He starts out Max as a social misfit- smart enough to be an engineer, but oblivious and awkward in other ways. The accident that transforms him also unhinges him, and Foxx conveys that aspect well. The comics version of Electro has always been a formidable enemy, one that Peter had to use his mind to bring down. Foxx takes the character in some different directions, but brings across just how dangerous Electro can be in his performance.The two leads are still in fine form as they were in the first film. Emma Stone plays Gwen they way the story writes her- smart, confident, assured. She's a young woman with her future ahead of her, who knows what she wants out of life, and can be resourceful and ingenious at times. And she also brings across the playful, caring side of the character. Her chemistry with Garfield feels real. Andrew Garfield continues to play the character of Peter as something of an outsider with a rebellious streak, a wise cracker who uses the sarcasm as a kind of mask. He tries to find balance in life between the thrills that his powers allow, and the responsibility that those powers have placed upon him. He copes with guilt over the past, struggles to find answers to questions he has about himself and others.",4,The Patented Parker Guilt Complex,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,6790,"['brief',
