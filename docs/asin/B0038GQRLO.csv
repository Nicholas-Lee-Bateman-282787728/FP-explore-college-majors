Just like it was said that only Nixon could have gone to China then only someone like Norman can press for fairness in the Palestinian cause.  He is not hung up on being Jewish but rather the fact that so many have used religion to gain sympathy for their cause without sympathy for the victims.  I am proud to add this to my library collection of documentaries worth seeing.,5,A Well Needed Voice,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,461,"['What', 'bravery', 'go', 'grain', 'Norman', 'done', 'paid', 'price', 'Just', 'was', 'said', 'only', 'Nixon', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'China', 'then', 'only', 'someone', 'Norman', 'can', 'press', 'fairness', 'Palestinian', 'cause', 'not', 'hung', 'up', 'being', 'Jewish', 'rather', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'used', 'religion', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'cause', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'am', 'proud', 'add', 'library', 'collection', 'documentaries', 'seeing']",American Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein

Barad,"[9, 23]","According to NF, his mother came to believe that she had ""Created a Frankenstein"", and there could possibly be some truth to this assessment.  From what I can gather, he has emerged as a self-made political and social pariah, and his unusual high-pitched voice adds a somewhat hysterical flavor to the overall oddness. At one point, he draws an analogy, comparing himelf to Albert Einstein. According to the film, he can't find a teaching job and hasn't been able to hold the ones he's had. By NF's account, this is due to his anti-establishment line, and the fact that his enemies are legion and relentlessly pursuing him for his beliefs.  One such critic is even demonized as a plagiarist, although the charges were later determined to be unfounded.  Keep in mind that there are many vociferous anti-establishment types who have succeeded immensely in academia--most notably NF's friend Noam Chomsky.In any case, this film portrays a pretty angry man who now makes a fairly decent living eviscerating his critics and promoting his books to enthusiastic students in Canada, many of whom are shown wearing Middle Eastern garb.  He clobbers his opponents remorselessly, and there may even be something of a sadistic steak when he is questioned by weeping college student.  I think I read somewhere that NF (or his supporters) believe that that student was a ""Plant.""  But does it really matter?  NF thought she was genuine at the time.  Just saying.In sum, I heartily give this film 4-stars for its originality, production values and the eccentricity of its subject. You will not be disappointed if you have any interest in things political. Judging from his modest living arrangements, success on the college speaking tour, his extensive international travel and notoriety, the man has probably accomplished many of his goals. How many of us can say the same?

This movie shows us what it is like to come out and speak about atrocities committed by a gang that has a very strong political backing and an almost airtight manipulative defense system. I watched Norm's detractors act like a bunch of (  albeit varnished articulate educated and IMMENSELY powerful) thugs. I didn't hear any factual arguments from these big name detractors against Norm- just emotionalism gang groupthink. Because they don't like it that Norm, a child of holocaust survivors- is a jewish jew hater ( their words) and a protector of the Arab side in the conflict- they make sure that he gets punished and big time. It's not enough to make sure he gets denied tenure and is broke and out of a job because he has offended some big names, but they want to see him evicted from his home in America, and he is forbidden entry into Israel. The film was eye opening for me - even in the highest echelons I see that these hyper acclaimed academics are no better than the Chicago mobs of the 30's- there is no room for dissent- Like another famous thug says- you're either with us or against us. I like Norm , he fights for who he believes is wronged even though it has cost him a great deal. I haven't read his works but may do so now as a result- and I will give him wide berth because I believe that he is uncorrupted and driven because he abhors injustice.",5,What courage looks like,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1488,"['Norm', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'put', 'pedestal', 'ego', 'most', 'adulated', 'academics', 'politicians', 'have', 'movie', 'what', 'come', 'out', 'speak', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'gang', 'very', 'strong', 'political', 'backing', 'almost', 'airtight', 'manipulative', 'defense', 'system', 'watched', 'Norm', 'detractors', 'act', 'bunch', 'varnished', 'articulate', 'educated', 'IMMENSELY', 'powerful', 'thugs', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'factual', 'arguments', 'big', 'name', 'detractors', 'Norm-', 'just', 'emotionalism', 'gang', 'groupthink', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Norm', 'child', 'holocaust', 'survivors-', 'jewish', 'jew', 'hater', 'words', 'protector', 'Arab', 'side', 'conflict-', 'make', 'sure', 'punished', 'big', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'sure', 'denied', 'tenure', 'broke', 'job', 'offended', 'big', 'names', 'want', 'see', 'evicted', 'home', 'America', 'forbidden', 'entry', 'Israel', 'film', 'was', 'eye', 'opening', 'even', 'highest', 'echelons', 'see', 'hyper', 'acclaimed', 'academics', 'are', 'better', 'Chicago', 'mobs', ""30's-"", 'room', 'dissent-', 'famous', 'thug', 'says-', ""'re"", 'like', 'Norm', 'who', 'wronged', 'even', 'cost', 'great', 'deal', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'works', 'may', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'result-', 'will', 'give', 'wide', 'berth', 'believe', 'uncorrupted', 'driven', 'injustice']",American Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein

What this film is: This is a very touching film about one of the most passionate and tragic figures in academia. A well respected scholar on the Middle East conflict, the political scientist Norman Finkelstein is loved by his students and many of his colleagues but has garnered enmity due to his vocal voice crusading for the rights of the Palestinians. His enemies, many of whom are not scholars on the conflict and not worthy to sharpen his pencils, have mounted successful attacks to discredit him in the general media and in the public's eyes. That's unfortunate as many of his views are mainstream and not that controversial. He is for the Two State Solution and is for the consensus views on a variety of human rights and international legal issues. What grates his opponents so much is his acerbic tone, his unrelenting efforts, and his willingness to sacrifice even his own welfare (including his means to make a living) to live by the high moral standards he has set for himself. His enemies, such as the Harvard law professor, Alan Dershiwitz, are wealthy, powerful and very influential, and using that influence, have gotten him fired from his own academic institution (despite his stellar publication and teaching record). Finkelstein has been banned from Israel due to his critical stance towards the country, a country that gives Jews a Right of Return based on the rationale that Jews everywhere should always have a safe haven to go which they can call home despite the fact that both Finkelstein's parents are Holocaust survivors.We see much of the history of the making of such a character. How the experiences of his parents in the concentration camps has solidified a kind of integrity and strength that refuses to compromise core principles in the face of evil. We see the price one sometimes must pay to live a just life in an unjust world. This is an unforgettable biographical portrait of a great scholar and activist.",5,portrait of a tragic academic,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,2069,"['What', 'film', 'not', 'not', 'introduction', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflict', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'two', 'What', 'film', 'very', 'touching', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'passionate', 'tragic', 'figures', 'academia', 'well', 'respected', 'scholar', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflict', 'political', 'scientist', 'Norman', 'Finkelstein', 'loved', 'students', 'many', 'colleagues', 'garnered', 'enmity', 'due', 'vocal', 'voice', 'crusading', 'rights', 'Palestinians', 'enemies', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'not', 'scholars', 'conflict', 'not', 'worthy', 'sharpen', 'pencils', 'have', 'mounted', 'successful', 'attacks', 'discredit', 'general', 'media', 'public', 'eyes', 'unfortunate', 'many', 'views', 'are', 'mainstream', 'not', 'controversial', 'Two', 'State', 'Solution', 'consensus', 'variety', 'human', 'rights', 'international', 'legal', 'issues', 'What', 'opponents', 'so', 'much', 'acerbic', 'tone', 'unrelenting', 'efforts', 'willingness', 'sacrifice', 'even', 'own', 'welfare', 'including', 'means', 'make', 'living', 'live', 'high', 'moral', 'standards', 'set', 'enemies', 'such', 'Harvard', 'law', 'professor', 'Alan', 'Dershiwitz', 'are', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'very', 'influential', 'using', 'influence', 'have', 'gotten', 'fired', 'own', 'academic', 'institution', 'stellar', 'publication', 'teaching', 'record', 'Finkelstein', 'been', 'banned', 'Israel', 'due', 'critical', 'stance', 'country', 'country', 'Jews', 'Right', 'Return', 'based', 'rationale', 'everywhere', 'should', 'always', 'have', 'safe', 'haven', 'go', 'can', 'call', 'home', 'fact', 'Finkelstein', 'parents', 'are', 'Holocaust', 'survivors.We', 'see', 'much', 'history', 'making', 'such', 'character', 'How', 'experiences', 'parents', 'concentration', 'camps', 'solidified', 'kind', 'integrity', 'strength', 'compromise', 'core', 'principles', 'face', 'evil', 'see', 'price', 'one', 'must', 'pay', 'live', 'just', 'life', 'unjust', 'world', 'unforgettable', 'biographical', 'portrait', 'great', 'scholar', 'activist']",American Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein
1330359,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B0038GQRLO,Robert Blake,"[7, 12]","Few characters in any documentary will display the kind of iron moral convictions and warrior spirit of Norman Finkelstein. ""American Radical"" is the portrait of a scholar taking on a world of lies, comformity and propaganda using the truth as his sword and finding himself viciously attacked by the gatekeepers of popular myth. Finkelstein's specialty is the issue of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, using nothing but the facts he condemns Israel as a brutal regime that needs to stop what it's doing or suffer the consequences. But as Finkelstein himself states in the film, the truth is often a bitter pill to swallow.""American Radical"" follows Finkelstein during his lecture tours and into his personal life. The portrait we get is of a man who's parents survived the Holocaust and who's mother raised him with a real hatred for injustice and compassion for human life. Finkelstein regularly cites his mother's convictions as having deeply influenced his own, and we see him confront pro-Israel hawks with fiery rhetoric which is never sensationalist. His words burn because they feel so honest and he uses facts like bullets, it is interesting to see pro-Israel fanatics like Alan Dershowitz dismiss Finkelstein as ""sick"" while they themselves virtually embody the word. Dershowitz especially hates Finkelstein because Finkelstein exposed the frauds and questionable sources for one of his books.Some of the most intriguing moments in the documentary involve Palestinians in the West Bank describing their time with Finkelstein when he stayed in the occupied territories during the Intifada of the 1980s. In a moving scene a Palestinian man describes how Finkelstein broke down everytime he recounted witnessing the shooting of a Palestinian boy by Israeli soldiers. We get the sense that Finkelstein is the true definition of an internationalist, this is not a man who has the time for pathetic nationalist loyalties. In the film he travels to Lebanon and admits admiration for Hezbollah, not because of their political program, but because people have the right to resist the foreign invasion of their country.""American Radical"" is not a probing look at Finkelstein's books, it is a study of the man. We see him at home and at the airport, discussing his convictions and attitudes. This is a surprisingly balanced documentary in the sense that it also allows his detractors to speak, it doesn't even attempt to paint them in a negative light because they do that themselves by slamming Finkelstein with offensive slurs while Finkelstein only responds with facts and truth. ""American Radical"" is a great introduction to Finkelstein the man for those unfamiliar with him, but hopefully it will inspire many to check out his actual work which ranks up there with the likes of Noam Chomsky and Chris Hedges.
