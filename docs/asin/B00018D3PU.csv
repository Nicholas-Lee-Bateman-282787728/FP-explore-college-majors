The woman with ""...the face that launched 1,000 ships..."" (Helen of Troy - Elizabeth Taylor). The Burtons produced this film version following their appearance in the stage version at Burton's alum, Oxford University. And, the film utilizes most of the Oxford players as well. The play, written by Christopher Marlowe (no Shakespeare he), centers around the opening line of this review. It would be difficult to resist such a sale with Elizabeth Taylor as the temptation. Despite several limitations, most notably budget, this film is quite intriquing. Mostly because of Taylor. Although she does not speak one word, appearing only as ""visions"" and ""temptations"", she is simply breathtakingly beautiful, even if somewhat zoftig. And, the music written by Mario Nascimbene, particularly ""Helen's Theme"", is nothing short of haunting. The film itself is nothing extrordinary, but Taylor, her costumes, and the music make it all worthwhile for me.",3,"Not a great film, but quite interesting on many levels",1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,1053,"['Would', 'sell', 'soul', 'devil', 'desire', 'Doctor', 'Faustus', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'would', 'desire', 'woman', 'face', 'launched', '1,000', 'ships', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Burtons', 'produced', 'film', 'version', 'following', 'appearance', 'stage', 'version', 'Burton', 'alum', 'Oxford', 'University', 'film', 'most', 'Oxford', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'play', 'written', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'Shakespeare', 'centers', 'opening', 'line', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'resist', 'sale', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'temptation', 'several', 'limitations', 'most', 'notably', 'budget', 'film', 'quite', 'intriquing', 'Mostly', 'Taylor', 'not', 'speak', 'one', 'word', 'appearing', 'only', 'visions', 'temptations', 'simply', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'even', 'somewhat', 'zoftig', 'music', 'written', 'Mario', 'Nascimbene', 'particularly', 'Helen', 'Theme', 'nothing', 'short', 'haunting', 'film', 'nothing', 'extrordinary', 'Taylor', 'costumes', 'music', 'make', 'worthwhile']",Doctor Faustus

Richard Burton is very convincing in the role of Faustus, a scholar who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for power, wealth, and knowledge. Elizabeth Taylor appears briefly several times as Helen of Troy and other characters, but she does not even speak except for her laughing at the end. Burton contributes much more with his fine acting and delivery of great lines from the play such as ""Is the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Illium?"" Was Liz Taylor as Helen really that beautiful? I guess that's for her admirers to decide.  The film's music is also haunting and moving. All of the great acting and sombre atmosphere help to make up for the movie's being limited almost entirely to a simple stage and inexpensive props.The DVD has fairly good sound and picture quality, although it doesn't seem that any restoration was done to the film.

794911,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00018D3PU,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I always enjoyed Cliff Marlowe's ""Dido Queen of Carthage,"" ""Dr. Faustus,"" ""Edward II,"" and ""Massacre At Paris.""For those of you who don't know the story (at least as Marlowe wrote it), it's basically this. Faustus is a known and respected scholar who feels that the legitimate knowledge of this world is not enough. After talking with some 'under the table scholars,' he makes a deal with the devil so that he can have unlimited knowledge. But somewhere along the line, he forgets his original goal and starts to indulge himself in amoral and sick practical jokes. Finally, so many years later, Faustus realizes the horror of what he has done, but repentance comes too late, and the devil gets his due.Richard Burton portrays the role of Faustus quite well. From his early arrogance, to his degenerating indulgence, to his final moments of terror. (This is often seen as one of the highest points of Marlowe's writing.) Elizabeth Taylor has no lines. But she does portray her role of the distracting temptress as well as can be expected without any opportunities to speak. Mephostophilis is an interestingly complex character. On one hand he is the agent of Lucifer following directions to move Faustus to damnation. But we don't really get the impression that he's enjoying it. And towards the end, we can sense some sadness and regret on his part.Overall, the movie follows Marlowe's play quite well, and it gives me little to complain about. However, there are a few things. I feel the march of the 7 deadly sins could have followed Marlowe's writing better. It's important because it  provides some comic relief. But it also helps us to see just how much Faustus has degenerated by his delight at this spectacle. Also, some people (myself included) could be disappointed by the absence of the scene where Faustus sells an innocent bystander a horse that disappears when he is ridden through water.Finally, I think the movie moves just a little too quickly. Part of what makes this play so great is the gradual pace. There is the eerie start where Faustus sells his soul; he starts to regret it, but then he is side tracked by the 7 deadly sins which shows his degeneration. Then for the 3rd and 4th act, Faustus (and the reader) seem to forget about what has happened as Faustus starts to indulge himself in amoral and sick practical jokes. It isn't until the 5th act where reality starts to reenter and Faustus starts getting concerned about the coming consequences of his actions.The movie (at 90 minutes) seems to move too quickly. There's hardly any time between when Faustus makes the unholy pact and when he starts to become frightened of the coming consequences.It's not perfect, but it's still a great film that tries to be faithful to what Marlowe wrote. And even though I have some complaints, I can still suggest the film.",4,"It's Very Good, But Not Perfect.",1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,2882,"['Giving', 'brief', 'rundown', 'where', 'stand', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Cliff', 'Marlowe', 'Dido', 'Queen', 'Carthage', 'Dr.', 'Faustus', 'Edward', 'II', 'Massacre', 'Paris', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'least', 'Marlowe', 'wrote', 'basically', 'Faustus', 'known', 'respected', 'scholar', 'who', 'legitimate', 'knowledge', 'world', 'not', 'enough', 'talking', ""'under"", 'table', 'scholars', 'deal', 'devil', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'unlimited', 'knowledge', 'somewhere', 'line', 'original', 'goal', 'indulge', 'amoral', 'sick', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Finally', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'Faustus', 'horror', 'what', 'done', 'repentance', 'too', 'late', 'devil', 'due.Richard', 'Burton', 'role', 'Faustus', 'quite', 'well', 'early', 'arrogance', 'degenerating', 'indulgence', 'final', 'moments', 'terror', 'often', 'seen', 'one', 'highest', 'points', 'Marlowe', 'writing', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'lines', 'portray', 'role', 'distracting', 'temptress', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'opportunities', 'speak', 'Mephostophilis', 'interestingly', 'complex', 'character', 'one', 'hand', 'agent', 'Lucifer', 'following', 'directions', 'move', 'Faustus', 'damnation', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'impression', 'enjoying', 'end', 'can', 'sense', 'sadness', 'regret', 'part.Overall', 'movie', 'Marlowe', 'play', 'quite', 'well', 'little', 'complain', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'feel', 'march', '7', 'deadly', 'sins', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'Marlowe', 'writing', 'better', 'important', 'comic', 'relief', 'also', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Faustus', 'degenerated', 'delight', 'spectacle', 'Also', 'people', 'included', 'could', 'be', 'disappointed', 'absence', 'scene', 'where', 'Faustus', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'horse', 'when', 'ridden', 'water.Finally', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'Part', 'what', 'play', 'so', 'great', 'gradual', 'pace', 'eerie', 'start', 'where', 'Faustus', 'soul', 'regret', 'then', 'side', 'tracked', '7', 'deadly', 'sins', 'degeneration', 'Then', '3rd', '4th', 'act', 'Faustus', 'reader', 'seem', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', 'Faustus', 'indulge', 'amoral', 'sick', 'practical', 'jokes', ""n't"", '5th', 'act', 'where', 'reality', 'reenter', 'Faustus', 'getting', 'concerned', 'coming', 'consequences', 'actions.The', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'move', 'too', 'quickly', 'hardly', 'time', 'when', 'Faustus', 'unholy', 'pact', 'when', 'become', 'frightened', 'coming', 'consequences.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'faithful', 'what', 'Marlowe', 'wrote', 'even', 'have', 'complaints', 'can', 'still', 'suggest', 'film']",Doctor Faustus
794912,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00018D3PU,Brian E. Erland,"[21, 22]","`Doctor Faustus', the '68 re-visioning of the Faustus/Mephistophelian Mythos produced, directed and starring Richard Burton is somewhat of a mixed bag, moving from immensely satisfying to plodding and back again. Burton is perfect as Doctor John Faustus, the ultimate Renaissance man whose thirst for knowledge takes him beyond the confines of conventional wisdom into the forbidden mysteries which can only be accessed by a pact with the Devil in exchange for a human soul. This is the role he was was born to play, plummeting the depths of the psyche and all the angst that goes with it has always been what he does best.Andreas Teuber's portrayal of Mephistopheles is the perfect counterbalance to the histrionic Faustus. Disturbingly quiet, attentive and thoughtful his demonic persona wavers subtly between melancholy and malignant.  It's amazing how his expressionless face could convey so much unspoken meaning.While the story is classic, the visuals at times hypnotic and Burton and Teuber superb, I found the presence of Elizabeth Taylor distracting and an unnecessary addition to the film. Aware of Richard and Liz's highly publicized love/hate relationship made her inclusion as his otherworldly lover a parody of their off-screen antics and detracted from the intended mood and mystery of the film. Fortunately this shortcoming may no longer apply to a younger generation unfamiliar with their on again off again romance.All and all an enjoyable thought provoking film for the Faustus in all of us.",4,"""Now Faustus What Would Thou Hast We Do?"" ~ At What Cost Wisdom",1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1510,"['Doctor', 'Faustus', 're-visioning', 'Faustus/Mephistophelian', 'Mythos', 'produced', 'directed', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'bag', 'moving', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'plodding', 'back', 'again', 'Burton', 'perfect', 'Doctor', 'John', 'Faustus', 'ultimate', 'Renaissance', 'man', 'thirst', 'knowledge', 'confines', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'forbidden', 'mysteries', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'accessed', 'pact', 'Devil', 'exchange', 'human', 'soul', 'role', 'was', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'plummeting', 'depths', 'psyche', 'angst', 'always', 'been', 'what', 'Teuber', 'portrayal', 'Mephistopheles', 'perfect', 'counterbalance', 'histrionic', 'Faustus', 'Disturbingly', 'quiet', 'attentive', 'thoughtful', 'demonic', 'persona', 'wavers', 'subtly', 'melancholy', 'malignant', 'amazing', 'how', 'expressionless', 'face', 'could', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'unspoken', 'story', 'classic', 'visuals', 'times', 'hypnotic', 'Burton', 'Teuber', 'superb', 'found', 'presence', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'film', 'Aware', 'Richard', 'Liz', 'highly', 'publicized', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'made', 'inclusion', 'otherworldly', 'parody', 'off-screen', 'antics', 'detracted', 'intended', 'mood', 'mystery', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'shortcoming', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'apply', 'younger', 'generation', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'romance.All', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'Faustus']",Doctor Faustus
794913,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00018D3PU,Chip Kaufmann,"[15, 15]","Back in 1967 when this film was first released, critics jumped all over it as just a Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vanity project which it was but that's all they saw. Now that Dick and Liz have been supplanted by Tom and Katie and Brad and Angelina the film is ripe for rediscovery and there is much to discover here. The beauty of Christopher Marlowe's play lies in the poetry of the lines and the philosophical and theological points the playwright raises. This Oxford University production which Burton co-directed captures its stage origins but is cleverly opened up in a number of ways which turn it into a fascinating cinematic experience thanks to an imaginative use of lighting, beautiful cinematography, and a haunting musical score by Mario Nascimbene (ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.). And then there is Richard Burton.His intense portrayal of the title character is a joy to behold and serves as a vivid reminder of just what a charismatic performer he was. His glorious voice speaks the Elizabethan text as if it were everyday conversation but with a power and conviction that must be heard to be believed and thanks to the optional DVD subtitles you can follow along as he speaks if you wish. The rest of the cast is made up of members of the Oxford Dramatic Society and they fufill the other roles satisfactorily with Andreas Teuber an absolute standout as a melancholy Mephistopheles. Last but not least there is Elizabeth Taylor. She is required to do nothing more than look beautiful in various guises (she has no dialogue) but she makes her presence felt throughout considering how beautiful she was back then. Chances are no one will redo Marlowe's play on film anytime soon and so there is even more reason to celebrate this version which clearly shows what the play has to offer as a great precursor to Shakespeare and how to make a major film on a minor budget.",4,Ripe For Rediscovery.,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1878,"['Back', '1967', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'critics', 'jumped', 'as', 'just', 'Richard', 'Burton-Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'vanity', 'project', 'was', 'saw', 'Now', 'Dick', 'Liz', 'have', 'been', 'supplanted', 'Tom', 'Katie', 'Brad', 'Angelina', 'film', 'ripe', 'rediscovery', 'much', 'discover', 'here', 'beauty', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'play', 'poetry', 'lines', 'philosophical', 'theological', 'points', 'playwright', 'Oxford', 'University', 'production', 'Burton', 'co-directed', 'stage', 'origins', 'cleverly', 'opened', 'up', 'number', 'ways', 'turn', 'fascinating', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'thanks', 'imaginative', 'use', 'lighting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'Mario', 'Nascimbene', 'ONE', 'MILLION', 'YEARS', 'B.C.', 'then', 'Richard', 'Burton.His', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'title', 'character', 'joy', 'behold', 'vivid', 'reminder', 'just', 'what', 'charismatic', 'performer', 'was', 'glorious', 'voice', 'Elizabethan', 'text', 'were', 'everyday', 'conversation', 'power', 'conviction', 'must', 'be', 'heard', 'be', 'believed', 'thanks', 'optional', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'wish', 'rest', 'cast', 'made', 'members', 'Oxford', 'Dramatic', 'Society', 'fufill', 'other', 'roles', 'satisfactorily', 'Andreas', 'Teuber', 'absolute', 'standout', 'melancholy', 'Mephistopheles', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'required', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'look', 'beautiful', 'various', 'guises', 'dialogue', 'presence', 'felt', 'considering', 'how', 'beautiful', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'Chances', 'are', 'one', 'will', 'redo', 'Marlowe', 'play', 'film', 'anytime', 'soon', 'so', 'even', 'more', 'reason', 'celebrate', 'version', 'clearly', 'what', 'play', 'offer', 'great', 'precursor', 'Shakespeare', 'how', 'make', 'major', 'film', 'minor', 'budget']",Doctor Faustus

I found Marlowe to be quite a bit easier to understand while still maintaining a fine sense of poetry.  And I enjoyed Marlowe's portrayal of a man's realization of his imminent damnation, something that would seem like the stuff of a medieval morality play, but it's very much brought to life by Marlowe's dialogue and Burton's performance.  Burton, in fact, is what makes this film worth seeing.  As others have noted, the sets may look a bit Vincent Price-y, and maybe Burton didn't block the scenes very well, and I'm not sure why it was necessary to have a gratuitous battlefield scene or pie fight, but when Burton's speaking, the power and precision of his delivery make those faults seem small.  I found the choice of a very understated Mephistopheles to be an intriguing one, and one that worked quite well.  As far as Elizabeth Taylor, I honestly could have done without her and her continual drifting into scenes to stare (supposedly captivatingly) at Faustus, with the same (somewhat irritating) musical score playing every time.  Just another form of Burton's obsession with her, it seems, another episode in the ongoing ""Dick and Liz Show"" that filled up the popular media of the time.  But others have felt that she adds a lot, and she doesn't say anything so she really doesn't steal the show, so it's another thing I can overlook.I will watch this again for the pure pleasure of hearing Burton say his lines.",4,Low-budget vehicle for a brilliant performance by Burton,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1535,"['watched', 'wanted', 'hear', 'what', 'Marlowe', 'when', 'performed', 'constrast', 'Shakespeare', 'found', 'Marlowe', 'be', 'quite', 'bit', 'easier', 'understand', 'still', 'maintaining', 'fine', 'sense', 'poetry', 'enjoyed', 'Marlowe', 'portrayal', 'man', 'realization', 'imminent', 'damnation', 'something', 'would', 'seem', 'stuff', 'medieval', 'morality', 'play', 'very', 'much', 'brought', 'life', 'Marlowe', 'dialogue', 'Burton', 'performance', 'Burton', 'fact', 'what', 'film', 'seeing', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'sets', 'may', 'look', 'bit', 'Vincent', 'Price-y', 'maybe', 'Burton', 'did', ""n't"", 'block', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'have', 'gratuitous', 'battlefield', 'scene', 'pie', 'fight', 'when', 'Burton', 'speaking', 'power', 'precision', 'delivery', 'make', 'faults', 'seem', 'small', 'found', 'choice', 'very', 'understated', 'Mephistopheles', 'be', 'intriguing', 'one', 'one', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'honestly', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'continual', 'drifting', 'scenes', 'stare', 'supposedly', 'captivatingly', 'Faustus', 'same', 'somewhat', 'irritating', 'musical', 'score', 'playing', 'time', 'Just', 'form', 'Burton', 'obsession', 'episode', 'ongoing', 'Dick', 'Liz', 'Show', 'filled', 'up', 'popular', 'media', 'time', 'others', 'have', 'felt', 'lot', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'so', 'really', ""n't"", 'steal', 'show', 'thing', 'can', 'overlook.I', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'Burton', 'say', 'lines']",Doctor Faustus

As in the original play, it is a very erudite work and features players from Oxford University as well as Burton at the height of his powers and his famous love for Elizabeth Taylor projected here in the role of Helen of Troy. A wonderful and haunting score in the opening credits and throughout the movie adds to the flavor of this intellectual delight. (The score is available on CD if you know where to look) This movie is DEEP. VERY DEEP! With lines such as ""Settle thy studies Faustus, and begin to sound the depth of that thou wilt profess"" Have a Latin dictionary nearby and don't let your attention wander!

794923,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00018D3PU,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[8, 9]","XXXXXThis movie is based on the play ""The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus"" (1588) by Christopher Marlowe (1564 to 1593).The movie begins with the printed word:""A tragic legend written down in the sixteenth century wherein a learned scientist honored with the laurels of his university, sold his soul to the devil for still greater knowledge and power in the unknown.""This brief introduction also summarizes the entire movie (except for the ending).Dr. Faustus (the legendary Richard Burton, 1925 to 1984) actually signs a contract in his own blood with Mephistopheles (a disciple of the devil played by Andreas Teuber) present (and who asks the question that titles this review).  Faustus is unsure of his decision but quickly adapts to his new life gaining not only power but other delights including the satisfaction of his lust for Helen of Troy (Elizabeth Taylor), ""the face that launch'd a thousand ships.""  Besides he is told that,""In Hell is all manner of delight.""But when Faustus begins to strongly regret his decision, it's too late and he has nothing to look forward too but ""eternal damnation.""This movie is a tour de force for Richard Burton (who also co-directed and co-produced).  The almost Shakespearean dialogue flows off his tongue and his acting as Dr. Faustus is superb.  I sensed that he was really enjoying this role.Surprisingly, Andreas Teuber who plays Mephistopheles (this was his first major movie role) also gives a convincing performance as the devil's assistant.Be aware that Elizabeth Taylor as Helen has no speaking parts in this movie.  At the end, she laughs wickedly.The scenery and costumes were, I felt, fantastic.  All filming took place in Rome.  The background music adds to each scene.A note on the language.  Above I said it was ""almost Shakespearean.""  This is because I find that Marlowe's language is not nearly as difficult to understand as Shakespeare's.  However, I still recommend turning on the English subtitles.  (Those viewers who are used to Elizabethan language should easily understand this movie.)I should mention that this movie was put down by critics when it first came out.  For myself, I can't understand why.  This movie stayed with me long after I finished watching it (mainly due to Richard Burton's performance).Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has no significant extras.In conclusion, in my opinion, this movie brings Christopher Marlow's classic play to life!

794924,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B00018D3PU,The JuRK,"[1, 6]","I've always been a fan of Richard Burton.  He was a powerful actor and a fascinating personality.  His voice elevates whatever he speaks, whether it's Hamlet or a guest shot on ""The Fall Guy.""  He was a man conflicted about everything in his life, battling the bottle and then everything else with the bottle.  He went from a poor Welsh upbringing to starring in the biggest movie ever made (CLEOPATRA) and in love with the glamorous star in the world (Elizabeth Taylor).So you would think that a man who appears to have made a Faustian bargain in his personal life would be perfect in a film of that legend...but I found the character inconsistent and it disrupted the movie as well.As powerful as Burton can be, roaring and raging his way through the highs and lows of wisdom and damnation, I couldn't follow his character arc and wondered at times where he was going with this.Best example: Burton's invisible Faustus ridicules and torments a meeting of the Pope and his underlings (these terribly officious members of the clergy are made up so pale that they appear--and are played--as clowns).  Considering Burton's feelings about faith and the church, this is a pretty accurate portrayal of the actor's beliefs...but I wondered what this had to do with the lofty goals of Faustus once he'd made his deal with the devil.But maybe Burton's take on the Faust legend has more to do with Burton than Faust: the actor runs through the character the way the actor ran through his life, living in high style, drinking and partying to an early grave, marrying glamor queens.  His wife at the time, Elizabeth Taylor, wanders through the film without ever saying a word as Burton/Faust stares with desire and trepidation.  (If Faustus was really dragged into Hell, why would it be by a green Elizabeth Talyor and not some ugly and repellent witch?).I'd be curious to see how the actual stage play read compared to the film.  If you're a fan of Burton and Taylor, you might stay interested.  Burton certainly has some great moments but you get a little tired of the same music that plays every time Liz walks through.",2,An Actor's Conviction and a Character's Consistency,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,2111,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'was', 'powerful', 'actor', 'fascinating', 'personality', 'voice', 'Hamlet', 'guest', 'shot', 'Fall', 'Guy', 'was', 'man', 'conflicted', 'everything', 'life', 'battling', 'bottle', 'then', 'everything', 'else', 'bottle', 'went', 'poor', 'Welsh', 'upbringing', 'starring', 'biggest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'CLEOPATRA', 'love', 'glamorous', 'star', 'world', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', '.So', 'would', 'think', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'Faustian', 'bargain', 'personal', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'film', 'legend', 'found', 'character', 'inconsistent', 'disrupted', 'movie', 'well.As', 'powerful', 'Burton', 'can', 'be', 'roaring', 'raging', 'way', 'highs', 'lows', 'wisdom', 'damnation', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'character', 'arc', 'wondered', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'this.Best', 'example', 'Burton', 'invisible', 'Faustus', 'ridicules', 'torments', 'meeting', 'Pope', 'underlings', 'terribly', 'officious', 'members', 'clergy', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'so', 'pale', 'appear', 'are', 'played', 'clowns', 'Considering', 'Burton', 'feelings', 'faith', 'church', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'actor', 'beliefs', 'wondered', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'lofty', 'goals', 'Faustus', 'once', ""'d"", 'made', 'deal', 'devil.But', 'maybe', 'Burton', 'take', 'Faust', 'legend', 'more', 'do', 'Burton', 'Faust', 'actor', 'character', 'way', 'actor', 'ran', 'life', 'living', 'high', 'style', 'drinking', 'partying', 'early', 'grave', 'marrying', 'glamor', 'queens', 'wife', 'time', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'wanders', 'film', 'ever', 'saying', 'word', 'Burton/Faust', 'desire', 'trepidation', 'Faustus', 'was', 'really', 'dragged', 'Hell', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'green', 'Elizabeth', 'Talyor', 'not', 'ugly', 'repellent', 'witch', '.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'actual', 'stage', 'play', 'read', 'compared', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'might', 'stay', 'interested', 'Burton', 'certainly', 'great', 'moments', 'get', 'little', 'tired', 'same', 'music', 'time', 'Liz', 'walks']",Doctor Faustus
