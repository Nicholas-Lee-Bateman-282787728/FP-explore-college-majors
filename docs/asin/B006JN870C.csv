And here we have more classic epsidoes such as Save The Tree & New Teacher, The Longest Monday & Eugenes Pet, and one of my favorite episodes from the set while growing up....MONKEY BUSINESS & BIG CAESAR. There was something creepy about that whole episode. While not my favorite Hey Arnold Episode(leave that to haunted train) the whole thing where Helga thinks shes going to be monkey and the whole nightmare sequence was well done. And the second half the fish episode where they try to catch big caesar and do but let him go. Another one of my favorites on here is OPERATION: Arnolds Halloween! How could one not like this episode! I always wanted to pull the prank off when i was a kid, with our towns water tower but realized i couldn't do it. This show what is nostalgic about it does bring back memories. I remember it started airing when i was in kindergarten and continued airing till i was in 4th grade, and i remember saying at one point hey im as old as arnold. The show reminded me a lot of me and my best friend from then we used to always have adventures, but never as crazy like the one in the show.

I won't deduct any stars for the lack of extra content because the show you're getting is so original but I should note again that these DVD's are bare bones episodes but one should care more when the original content is so great, a behind the scenes look at are beloved show from the producers would be greatly appreciated.

1516365,A3BZ06T8L9LV8C,B006JN870C,XZero,"[2, 3]","For me, Hey Arnold was at the end of my time with Nick. I grew up on the classics like Ren and Stimpy, Doug, Rocko, and Rugrats. Arnold and Angry Beavers sort of fit in there, but they're definitively at the tail end of my nostalgia. That said, I have some fond memories of Hey Arnold, particularly the earlier seasons. If you do too, this set is a great buy.This is Hey Arnold Season 2 Part 1. Let's get something out of the way on that. Hey Arnold Season 1 was a complete season, whereas this is only half of a season. Apparently retailers don't want to carry full seasons of kids' shows, and so they get split into parts. This is consistent with other shows as well (walk through a Wal Mart and you'll probably see Dragon Ball Z Season 1 Part 1 for $10-15). This leaves us with a bit of a problem. On the one hand, getting only half a season with releases like this is frustrating and basically doubles the cost to collect the whole show. However, the alternative is not getting them at all because the reality is that Shout Factory can't release something that stores are going to refuse to stock. So while it's far from ideal, Shout Factory is not the company to blame. Point the finger of blame at brick and mortar retailers who won't carry slightly more expensive season sets because they're no longer impulse buys at $19.99 like they are at $14.99.As for the DVDs here, they're pretty consistent with the first season. The case is clear plastic and has some nice artwork on the back and inside. Standard menus and no real extras, which is a shame. The video quality is fair; it's not great and clearly was not remastered in any real way, but it's not unwatchable either. The episodes included in this set are pretty solid across the board. In the second segment of the first episode, we meet the new teacher Mr. Simmons (after a particularly humorous bout with Mr. Goose, aka Lieutenant Major Goose, a militant teacher who controls Arnold's class with an iron fist). Hey Arnold is another one of those shows where it's not too hard to find some more adult-oriented jokes and material scattered throughout, though it's far from competing with the likes of Ren & Stimpy or Rocko's Modern Life.In sum, this is a nostalgia buy for a lot of people. No, it's not ideal to buy part 1 and part 2 of the second season when they just as easily could have been one release in theory. But you shouldn't hold that against Shout Factory, nor should you boycott this release in hopes of getting a complete Season 2. It's highly unlikely one will ever come out unless the current market perspective changes. I gave this release 4 stars out of 5 for a few reasons. First, the video quality isn't particularly good. As discussed above, it's not bad, but it would have been nice to see it remastered. Second, there are no extras. Had this been a full season release for season 2, these issues would have been overlooked. Under the circumstances, I just can't justify giving this release a 5 out of 5 in all candor.",4,Another Nostalgic Dose of Arnold,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,3003,"['Hey', 'Arnold', 'was', 'end', 'time', 'Nick', 'grew', 'up', 'classics', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'Doug', 'Rocko', 'Rugrats', 'Arnold', 'Angry', 'Beavers', 'sort', 'fit', 'there', ""'re"", 'definitively', 'tail', 'end', 'nostalgia', 'said', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'particularly', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'do', 'too', 'set', 'great', 'buy.This', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1', 'Let', 'get', 'something', 'way', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'complete', 'season', 'only', 'half', 'season', 'Apparently', 'retailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'carry', 'full', 'seasons', 'kids', 'shows', 'so', 'get', 'split', 'parts', 'consistent', 'other', 'shows', 'well', 'walk', 'Wal', 'Mart', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Season', '1', 'Part', '1', '10-15', 'bit', 'problem', 'one', 'hand', 'getting', 'only', 'season', 'releases', 'frustrating', 'basically', 'cost', 'collect', 'whole', 'show', 'However', 'alternative', 'not', 'getting', 'reality', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'release', 'something', 'stores', 'are', 'going', 'refuse', 'stock', 'So', 'far', 'ideal', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'not', 'company', 'blame', 'Point', 'finger', 'blame', 'brick', 'mortar', 'retailers', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'carry', 'slightly', 'more', 'expensive', 'season', 'sets', ""'re"", 'longer', 'impulse', 'buys', '19.99', 'are', '14.99.As', 'DVDs', 'here', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'consistent', 'first', 'season', 'case', 'clear', 'plastic', 'nice', 'artwork', 'back', 'inside', 'Standard', 'menus', 'real', 'extras', 'shame', 'video', 'quality', 'fair', 'not', 'great', 'clearly', 'was', 'not', 'remastered', 'real', 'way', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'either', 'episodes', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'board', 'second', 'segment', 'first', 'episode', 'meet', 'new', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simmons', 'particularly', 'humorous', 'bout', 'Mr', 'Goose', 'aka', 'Lieutenant', 'Major', 'Goose', 'militant', 'teacher', 'who', 'Arnold', 'class', 'iron', 'fist', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'one', 'shows', 'where', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'find', 'more', 'adult-oriented', 'jokes', 'material', 'scattered', 'far', 'competing', 'likes', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'Rocko', 'Modern', 'Life.In', 'sum', 'nostalgia', 'buy', 'lot', 'people', 'No', 'not', 'ideal', 'buy', 'part', '1', 'part', '2', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'just', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'release', 'theory', 'should', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'should', 'boycott', 'release', 'hopes', 'getting', 'complete', 'Season', '2', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'current', 'market', 'perspective', 'changes', 'gave', 'release', '4', 'stars', '5', 'few', 'reasons', 'First', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'discussed', 'not', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'remastered', 'Second', 'are', 'extras', 'Had', 'been', 'full', 'season', 'release', 'season', '2', 'issues', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'circumstances', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'giving', 'release', '5', '5', 'candor']","Hey Arnold!
