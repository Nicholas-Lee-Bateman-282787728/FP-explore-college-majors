1245396,A2KDOM0C6R910Q,B001XURPM2,"F. Sod ""Flyingsod""","[4, 4]",A mid quality independent film worth watching if you like this sort of thing. It's comedy and meant to be so. It's also a horror action flick. The Skeleton gave me the best laugh I've had in quite a while. It has a decent and interesting plot and sub plot. The acting is good enough from the main characters to not be annoying. There's some quality issues with blurryness and bad sound in a few spots but overall its fine. It's kinda longer than it needs to be but its entertaining enough when there's nothing else to do.,3,mid quality indy,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,521,"['mid', 'quality', 'independent', 'film', 'watching', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'comedy', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'also', 'horror', 'action', 'flick', 'Skeleton', 'gave', 'best', 'laugh', ""'ve"", 'had', 'quite', 'while', 'decent', 'interesting', 'plot', 'sub', 'plot', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'be', 'annoying', 'quality', 'issues', 'blurryness', 'bad', 'sound', 'few', 'spots', 'overall', 'fine', 'kinda', 'longer', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'do']",The Night Shift

A bigger budget may have helped it a bit but I can't bring myself to give it more than 3 stars for effort. The script was ok and some of the actors were able to carry their lines but to be honest it was a chore setting through it.

Sometimes a bit blurry.  Sound quality is acceptable.Premise/comedy/execution are interesting overall but often the movie feels slow; a bit plodding.Definitely low buck and shows it.I wouldn't personally rent it or buy it but I liked it and felt it was worthwhile if not paying extra due to Prime membership.
