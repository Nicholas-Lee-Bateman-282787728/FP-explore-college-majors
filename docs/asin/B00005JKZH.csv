593074,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00005JKZH,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[2, 2]","Dragonfly stars Kevin Costner as an Emergency Room doctor who's wife is presumed dead in Venezuela.  I was channel surfing and tuned this in for what would have been a few seconds.  Surprisingly gripped I watched to the end.Directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson the film begins with Emily's (Susanna Thompson) bus being lost in a storm and Joe Darrow (Costner) working 'round the clock to avoid mourning his pregnant wife.  The title comes from Emily's fascination with dragonflies and we learn Dr. Darrow is a sceptic when he tells a patient who attempted suicide, ""this crappy world is all there is"".  Soon he starts getting what he believes are messages from Emily via kids who have near death experiences, and everyone including his friend (Kathy Bates) tells him he's crazy.  When the messages are consistent from different kids as well as a nun who studies near death experience, an adult ""brain dead"" patient, and even his parrot, he starts to figure out what she's trying to say from beyond the grave.Most of the film is consistent, except for one scene that is a bit distracting for its lack of believability, namely when he jumps into the lake, ends up underwater, is rescued, and then is perfectly fine the next minute.  The scene is too over-the-top and really should have been cut, especially in a film where there is some good subtlety otherwise.  The ending is a great fairytale type ending, but also suffers from being too over-the-top to be believable.However this film is well worth watching as an interesting take on the near death experience and a good vehicle for Kevin Costner.  Easily superior to the ridiculous film Sixth Sense, and even better than Ghost, as this one has subtlety.  I believe the NDE and afterlife are worth exploring in a deep serious manner, and this film at least has a hint of that.  I believe consciousness is basically eternal.",4,Well Done Thoughtful take on afterlife communication,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1907,"['Dragonfly', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'doctor', 'who', 'wife', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Venezuela', 'was', 'channel', 'surfing', 'tuned', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'seconds', 'Surprisingly', 'gripped', 'watched', 'end.Directed', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'written', 'Brandon', 'Camp', 'Mike', 'Thompson', 'film', 'Emily', 'Susanna', 'Thompson', 'bus', 'being', 'lost', 'storm', 'Joe', 'Darrow', 'Costner', 'working', 'clock', 'avoid', 'mourning', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'title', 'Emily', 'fascination', 'dragonflies', 'learn', 'Dr.', 'Darrow', 'sceptic', 'when', 'patient', 'who', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'crappy', 'world', 'Soon', 'getting', 'what', 'are', 'messages', 'Emily', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'near', 'death', 'experiences', 'everyone', 'including', 'friend', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'crazy', 'When', 'messages', 'are', 'consistent', 'different', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'nun', 'who', 'studies', 'death', 'experience', 'adult', 'brain', 'dead', 'patient', 'even', 'parrot', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'grave.Most', 'film', 'consistent', 'one', 'scene', 'bit', 'distracting', 'lack', 'believability', 'namely', 'when', 'lake', 'up', 'underwater', 'rescued', 'then', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'next', 'minute', 'scene', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'especially', 'film', 'where', 'good', 'subtlety', 'otherwise', 'ending', 'great', 'fairytale', 'type', 'ending', 'also', 'suffers', 'being', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'believable.However', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'interesting', 'take', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'good', 'vehicle', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Easily', 'superior', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'even', 'better', 'Ghost', 'one', 'subtlety', 'believe', 'NDE', 'afterlife', 'are', 'worth', 'exploring', 'deep', 'serious', 'manner', 'film', 'least', 'hint', 'believe', 'consciousness', 'basically', 'eternal']",N/A

The premise was intriguing, at least for those who appreciate paranormal storylines, and it seemed as though everything would fall satisfyingly into place.  Unfortunately, the &quot;twist&quot; at the end undid every good thing the filmmakers had already established.  I don't require a film to be believable-that seems to miss the point of the medium's capabilities altogether.  However, I detest mediocrity.  And &quot;Dragonfly&quot; is mediocre.Kevin Costner seems uncomfortable in his role, as though he can never quite find the right way to inhabit Joe Darrow's grief.  Susanna Thompson, radiant on &quot;Once and Again&quot;, is completely wasted here as Costner's wife.  Kathy Bates is excellent, as always, but her superiority as an actor makes Costner's performance look even thinner than it might have otherwise.There are a few good thrills here.

593076,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKZH,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 7]","The concept of death surrounds me recently.  Not that friends and/or family or passing away, but with the films and television programs that I have been watching recently, it seems to be a common occurrence.  I am in the middle of viewing full seasons of ""The 4400"" which deals with the death of some to cause a ""ripple effect"" that would heal the world, ""Monk"" - which in each episode someone dies and it is up to Shalhoub to solve the mystery of the dead person, and surprisingly I am trying to figure out ""Lost"", which is teetering on the exploration of the possible death/purgatory of its central characters.  So, with all this ""death"" surrounding me, why not pick up a film that may give me a chuckle (due to the director's prior comedic turns) as well as give me a new insight on the unknown explanation of the death phenomenon.  One would hope that this would be the case with ""Dragonfly"", but upon a second viewing - as well as the voice of director Shadyac informing us that he didn't enjoy the final cut of this film - it was only discovered that Kevin Costner cannot paint us a picture of death - nor should we ever ask him to.To be utterly up front with anyone reading this review, I am not going to paint a pretty picture of what I witnessed with this outing.  There was nothing, I repeat, nothing of value with this film that tried to blend the teary eye of Costner with that of ""The Sixth Sense"".  First time drama director Shadyac (who would be better known as the founder of ""Ace Ventura""), cannot seem to grasp this film as he continually combines clich&eacute; elements from other films, random occurrences that never quite link us to the ending, and a complete waste of actual talent.  He has the blocks to build the story, but instead he just tosses them into a waterfall hoping that they will land upright.  Was this a supernatural thriller, was it a romantic drama, or was it just another venue for Kevin Costner to attempt to apply his ""leading man"" status to?  For me, I couldn't quite see where Shadyac was going or what genre he was interacting with.  The trouble begins with the story, of which couples with soul-mates, dragonflies, and coming back from the dead, as well as what a popular majority thinks.  Listening to the commentary, Shadyac explains that his cut of the film wasn't as received as the final cut because too many people knew the ending prior to it happening.  In my eyes - that is worthwhile if the story continues to attract us - but in ""Dragonfly"" that is not the case.  The story is trite and quite dull, leading to an ending that surprises mainly because you don't care any further.  Joe Darrow lost his wife, cannot cope even months later, and begins to think that she is contacting him from the dead - but for what reason?  If you weren't pulled in by my synopsis, then I do not suggest viewing this film because in 22 words, I have probably told you everything.The acting is atrocious, possibly the worst roles created for two very talented actors.  I am speaking of both Costner and that unknown talent that normally reverberates from Kathy Bates, but seemed to be missing this time.  Perhaps it is the tone, the vague symbolism, or just the fact that these two needed paychecks that soured this film, but instances were not connecting.  By the big ""surprise"" at the end, we are either so tired of the events or have (in my case) forgotten them, that there is no ""gasp"" or shock, merely just excitement to have a finale to this horrid broadcast.  Shadyac has talent as a director, I even find myself laughing at ""Bruce Almighty"", but drama is not his cup of tea.  This film was too dark without any signs of light, which can be a good thing for skilled directors, but not for first-time Shadyac.  He needed a blend of comic with the eerie unknown, which would have offset the disaster this train was headed towards.  Costner couldn't carry Shadyac's work, and became murky and muddled through the middle.  He had no central focus, so we  - as audience members - didn't know who he was.  Was he crazy or just in love?  How come we never saw his love for his wife?  Unanswered questions that Shadyac and Costner never allowed anyone to answer.To add to my disgust was the filming overall of this movie.  Just as I was confused as to the real ending to the film, I am sure that those involved were equally as confused.  We move, rather quickly, from children seeing the dead, to dragonflies, to white water rafting, all the way back to some native tribe in South America.  It just seemed like we were jumping rather quickly, but in the wrong direction.  Without giving it away, I had forgotten the main element to the ending when we got to it because we were muddled with so many other un-needed moments that the ending just seemed watered down and dull.  Honestly, I was bored with this movie because it lead us down one path, somehow jumped to another, and tried to make it back to that original path that was already lost and forgotten.  The music didn't match with the actions or emotions of the characters, the hints were hidden and expected, there was no moment of self-discovery.  There wasn't a scene in the film where I suddenly went, ""oh, I get it"" -- and that is sad.  ""Dragonfly"" had the potential, I just felt that Shadyac was behind the wheel of a vehicle that he couldn't control, and as you listen to the commentary, you can sense (and at times hear) that he didn't want to be behind the wheel at all.""Dragonfly"" is a pointless corporate film driven to bring in more money while capitalizing on the income produced by ""The Sixth Sense"".  There are borrowed elements that Shadyac cannot control as well as actors that walk through their scenes wondering when the paycheck will arrive at their doorstep.  This is the worst film to see Kathy Bates perform, and Costner continues to dig himself a bigger hole.  As you listen to the commentary, this film underwent quite a bit of changes due to viewer issues and response, which I think is the worst way to edit a film.  Shadyac has no problems saying that he edited this wrong, and that he didn't like ""x"" scene, and that he felt this was completely amateurish - which only helps solidify a inner feeling of disappointment with the film.  He selflessly promotes ""Bruce Almighty"" during this film, which drove the nail further into the already built ""Dragonfly"" coffin.  I do not suggest this film to anyone unless you like your water from the tap, meaning that if you don't mind drinking muddled, tainted, and possibly poisoned liquid - than ""Dragonfly"" will be the film for you.  It was that bad.Shadyac, take it from me and TLC, don't go chasing waterfalls.Grade: * out of *****",1,"Shadyac, take it from me and TLC, don't go chasing waterfalls.",1179446400,"05 18,

Kevin Costner's portrayal of a doctor in mourning is convincing although his eager acceptance of the supernatural seems a little oddly motivated initially.  As plot gets more bizarre his reactions get more extreme and that's where the film excels.  Some other performances, particularly the child actors', are less believable.On the DVD version the deleted scenes are interesting, but not as sharp as the rest of the film.  (Maybe deleted scenes are always like that, I've never been interested enough to watch them on any other DVD, which is a real compliment to the depth of this film.)The bonus material also includes the personal story of Betty Eadie's near death experience which is convincing and fascinating.  Her story lends the movie a sense of believability even though Dragonfly focuses more on grief and belief than actual near death experiences.  (If you're unfamiliar with Eadie's autobiographical ""Embraced by the Light"", look for it.  It's one book that can really shatter your perceptions.)

593080,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKZH,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Everything about this movie, outside of the cleverly shielded climax (which is better than expected) is really a bore.  I don't really know why I expected more, and yet I did.Kevin Costner can't seem to emote very well unless he's playing drunk (thank you `The Upside of Anger' for proving me wrong about Costner being completely useless) and so his variation of a man emotionally tormented comes off void of any real emotion period.  I think that is a problem that a lot of `less talented' actors have in films of this nature.  They think that simply stripping emotion from your face will portray depression precisely, but it doesn't work that easily.  You have to work for it just as you would any other emotion.Costner doesn't work at it, and while Kathy Bates may have perfected her gusto-supporting role, its use here is more of a distraction (even if it is a seeming highlight).Seriously, outside of the films relatively shocking conclusion, `Dragonfly' is a misfire.It had a chance to build something more profound out of its prose (the whole spiritual aspect of things seems horrifically underdeveloped when you consider the fact that this film was toted as a `spiritual journey') but instead it fell into generic clich&eacute;s that circle supernatural thrillers.

Mesa,"[8, 10]","Dragonfly is one of those rare sleeper films about the supernatural and spiritual that comes and goes in the theatre without much of a buzz (no pun intended)!Or even if it did make a buzz was somehow forgotten by the movie going public ! While it's been compared to everything ever made in the film world about ghosts and the afterlife one thing remains to make it stand apart from the rest; It truly does tell a damn good story from beginning to end. The way it was directed and written keeps the viewer guessing to the very end as to what's inside the &quot;rainbow&quot; or at the end of the rainbow ! As astute as I like to think that I am when watching this genre of film even I wanted to know where Joe (Kevin Costner) was going (insane or to an actual place spiritual or otherwise)...Was his character's wife alive or dead ? I still could not figure out where the ending was leading to, until...well, just watch the film !Performance by Costner is, well Kevin Costner playing Kevin Costner,...which means that unless you're a fan of his (which I've never been) or enjoy films of the spiritual and supernatural then this will satisfy. Kathy Bates' neighbor/lawyer supporting role is cynical yet caring who watches out for Joe (and &quot;Big Bird&quot;) but begins to seriously think he's loosing his grip on reality !She insists that he &quot;move on&quot; and &quot;go on a trip&quot;.

I buckled down, however, and sat through it and (gulp) actually enjoyed it. I'm surprsied at all the negative reviews here because even though this movie isn't the best thing that ever happened to cinema (and how often does that happen? honestly, hardly ever!), it's still a good movie.Costner stars as Dr. Darrow, a grieving widow. We get pictures of his wife, flashbacks, and glimpses of what her death was like. She was on a bus in South America that went down a hill and into a raging river. Or is she really dead? I found the overall tone to be quite creepy, and even though I figured the movie out about fifteen minutes in, I still enjoyed watching the story unfold and figuring out just what all the clues he was receiving from ""the beyond"" actually meant. I saw it coming, but hey, I still liked the ending. It's the kind of ending that's ridiculous and believable at the same time.I think Costner's great in this movie. His uneasiness made me uneasy. Kathy Bates co-stars as the nice-neighbor-lady-who-always-helps-when-he-needs-it, and she's good as well. I wouldn't have recommended this to anyone to see in the theater (I seldom do-- it has to be a great action flick a la Star Wars for me to give a theater recommendation-- hey, tickets are expensive, and you only get ONE viewing!)

As a result of her death Darrow buries himself in his work, helping in situations where he can preserve life (birth scene) and trying to ignore death (he refuses to treat a suicide attempt at first). But soon it becomes apparent that there are unseen forces at work: Strange voices, objects moving. A kid who's a patient at the hospital where Joe works claims Joe's wife has spoken to him. In addition to this, Joe's pet parrot is displaying the same behaviours it did while his wife was alive- like greeting her when she arrived home from work. Could she be contacting Joe from beyond the grave? Or by some miraculous coincidence is she still alive?DRAGONFLY is not a brilliant movie, but it holds your attention for its 100 minutes. Oddly, the dragonflies shown in the movie's trailer don't even appear in the film! Kathy Bates has a supporting role as Joe's neighbour.DVD extras include Director's commentary, location doco, deleted scenes and an interview with author Betty Eadie recounting a near-death experience she had; with her expressing her views of how the film-makers handle the subject of death and near-death experiences in the movie, which are apparently meant to be accurate.

593090,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JKZH,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I'm truly confused why so many people admire Dragonfly.  The acting is atrocious, and the entire movie feels like one of those Hallmark made for TV-type movies you normally see around the holidays.  There's extremely cheesy dialogue around every single corner, coming mostly from Kevin Costner's underwhelming performance, and most of it is so bland it just comes across like pointless secondrate nonsense.The only reason I'm not giving the film one star is because at least Kathy Bates saves a few scenes whenever she gives some words of encouragement to Costner's character concerning his missing wife, otherwise we're force fed one uninteresting scene after another.The storyline is about Kevin Costner believing he's receiving messages from his wife who supposedly died in a bus accident.  He receives these messages by way of sick children at a hospital, weird drawings on his house windows, and a pet bird that was utterly pointless.The film wastes no time getting the plot moving along- right from the beginning we see the accident take place, and from there we see Kevin Costner walking around the hospital all day talking to, as I mention above, sick children who are apparently sending signals and messages to Kevin Costner concerning his wife.The storyline *finally* becomes enticing enough to be considered watchable when Kevin's character goes in search for his wife where the accident took place... but it took ALL the way until the final 20 minutes of film to get to this particular point.Many big name actors and actresses star in Dragonfly, and while watching the generic storyline roll along, it honestly felt like wasted potential by just about everyone involved.A common message Kevin's character would receive is this particular signal that looked like two lines crossing into each other.  I guess it was supposed to be the dragonfly symbol.  This stuff seriously makes Ghost Whisperer and Medium seem believable and frightening.Dragonfly is just terribly campy the entire time.

All I could see was Kevin Costner wandering around a hospital trying to deal with the death of his wife.  Costner's character Joe is an unbeliever, a man who doesn't think a heaven exists.  He's staunch in his beliefs, at least till wierd [stuff] starts happening in his house.At this point I thought I might be watching ""What Lies Beneath"" again.  Even though Joe doesn't believe in heaven or ghosts, his wife decides to contact him, and proceeds to wreak utter havoc upon his life.  Kids die and come back to life with messages for him, he sees a wierd symbol all over the place, his pet parrot goes crazy on him, and stuff starts breaking.  Then, as a kicker, she starts rearranging things in the house.She's very lucky she didn't drive him to suicide--that's what I would have done.  But, somehow, he starts believing and is led to a tribe of primitives in the jungles of Venezuela, and there he discovers the reason she's been pestering him.  Then the movie gets all touching and you almost feel bad for making fun of the cheesy ghost theme at the beginning.This really isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that good either.  It's a somewhat worn-out ghost story, complete with symbols, messages from beyond, even a crazy parrot.  There is nothing new here, but at least the story has a point, and the ending IS good.  Costner's acting is decent, and there is no gaping hole in the plot.  It's not a bad movie to watch once, but only once.If you're the kind of person who likes ghost movies, by all means watch this one.  You will not be disappointed.  And, if you like getting startled by dead people suddenly coming back to life or animals freaking out, you'll also be very impressed.

Pfleeger,"[3, 4]","Tom Shadyac's Dragonfly bills itself as a spiritual journey and this may or may not be the case.All in all the film is not really bad but it moves at a glacial pace, is bogged down by heavy acting and has an ending so contrived as to make one feel that he was watching a Hallmark presentation rather than a feature film.Listening to the commentary to this fim is the most enlightening part of the experience. Shadyac, known as a comedy director explains in some detail that had he the chance to do it all over again he would have made differnet choices. Like I said the movie isn't really bad biut it isn't Academy award material either.The story follows the life of Dr. Joe Darrow (Costner) following the sudden death of his wife. Darrow refuses to grieve burying himself in his job as an emergency room doctor. This is when the wierd stuff begins to happen. It seems that the deceased wife is trying to contact him. The question is for what reason?The film hasa great deal of under used talent. Little more than cameos by Ron Rifkin, Joe Morton, Linda Hunt, and Kathy Bates. One feels that had some of the supporting actors been able to be developed a little better this would have been a better film. It appears that Shadyac was holding out for the surprise ending which is not really a surprise if the viewer pays the slightest bit of attention.For a film that deals with questions of faith this is not realy a religious movie but a personal exploration of belief by the main character. This is a good date movie however it does not offer the viewer that experience that it could have had it been developed a little betterListen to the commentary after you see the movie because it does expose the surprise ending in its first few moments. The balance of the special features include an interview with Betty Eadie on her near death experience and some deleted scenes without commentary.

The pacing is so slow you could knit a sweater between scenes and not miss anything. There are continuity errors abounding (Kevin receives an internet order his late wife placed. In the first scene the label shows Dr. Emily Darrow. In the next the label shows Emily Darrow. Hmmn.) Kathy Bates is completely wasted in a nothing role with a butch haircut, making peculiar references to a dead female who could've been her partner or her child. It's never clarified. So that one's up for grabs, but it's always sad to see a gifted performer struggle to infuse life into something that will not, just will not get up and breathe. And while Costner gives a decent performance as a grief-stricken new widower, the plot is so foolish that it's almost painful to sit through this movie. I predicted the ending about a third of the way through and there's a whole lot of nonsense to get through before that ending finally comes. Meanwhile the landslide that did in Dr. Emily purportedly revealed a previously undiscovered tribe. Yet when Kevin finally returns to Venezuela and hires someone to fly him to the region, this tribe has a truck (wonder how it got there, given the need to fly into the place) and machine guns.This is a script that purports to be about faith. I think the only faith involved is the viewer's in believing it's worth the price and it is not.

That, my friends, is scary.Anyway, that's what happened to me and I don't like a film doing that without a purpose. However, like dealing with weirdo deserts, it takes an adventurous, open-minded approach to get into whatever ingredients are being thrown at you. So I tried that.Here, Dr. Joe ""Joe!! JOE!!! JOE!!!!! Darrow (Costner) tragically loses his beloved wife Dr. Emily Darrow (tv personality Susanna Thompson) in a bus accident in South America. He should have accompanied her, he knows, he knows! It was a humanitarian mission! For the Indians!! What a pr*ck you are, Joe!Actually I was essentially lost with that part of the plot. Why did dear Dr. Emily, who cares so much for her young cancer patients, suddenly run off to Venezuela or wherever?--to die, apparently.So, Dr. Joe is loping around the ER haunt per his job and begins hallucinating Emily's presence, hearing her speak through dying patients and kids with cancer. Joe becomes obsessed with discovering whether or not the dead (or the comatose) can communicate with us. He really loses his cool, but this is Costner so we aren't going to see a plethora of skilled emoting here.I loved Helen Hunt as a feisty nun who is an expert on near-death experiences (NDEs). The writing in this film at times bordered on offensive, as she describes to Joe the way dying kids make ""the perfect laboratory"" for near-death experience information. What the hell is this, an episode of Ghost Hunters?!You can guess the rest but never the ending. Joe, having been ordered on sabbatical, runs off to the land of strange Indians, bananas, giant mosquitoes and snakes to see if his wife survived the accident or not. What he finds there I will leave for you to discover...but it is, like the weird desert, sort of unmatched and untried in cinematic history...the third star is for that alone.Costner has apparently left his directing days behind, and more's the pity. DANCES WITH WOLVES, WYATT EARP, either one was sufficient to cement Costner's directing power. He has simply sunk back into any mediocre thing that comes along, and this film bored me enough at times to make me start trying to recall what was the gizmo Costner tried to sell to BP to stop the oil spill.In the end, I will say: DRAGONFLY (accept no substitutes, there are tons of ""Dragonflies"" out there) is worth one viewing. Not for anything but the ending: as a film that should have held up well in comparison to THE SIXTH SENSE, this thing falls flat. Though my wife did say it was ""excessively spooky and dead people should not go around doing those sorts of things to their loved ones.""",3,"Stop it, you're scaring me...oh, it's just Costner's 'acting'",1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2922,"['DRAGONFLY', '2002', 'film', 'came', 'see', 'only', 'quite', 'recently', 'too', ""'spooky"", 'considering', 'what', 'ultimately', 'convey', 'odd', 'sort', 'desert', ""'ve"", 'never', 'tried', 'first', 'taste', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'get', 'not', 'love', 'despise', 'lose', 'track', 'own', 'thought', 'processes', 'friends', 'scary.Anyway', 'what', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'doing', 'purpose', 'However', 'dealing', 'weirdo', 'deserts', 'adventurous', 'open-minded', 'approach', 'get', 'ingredients', 'are', 'being', 'thrown', 'So', 'tried', 'that.Here', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'JOE', 'JOE', 'Darrow', 'Costner', 'tragically', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Emily', 'Darrow', 'tv', 'personality', 'Susanna', 'Thompson', 'bus', 'accident', 'South', 'America', 'should', 'have', 'accompanied', 'was', 'humanitarian', 'mission', 'Indians', 'What', 'pr*ck', 'are', 'Joe', 'Actually', 'was', 'essentially', 'lost', 'part', 'plot', 'Why', 'did', 'dear', 'Dr.', 'Emily', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'young', 'cancer', 'patients', 'suddenly', 'run', 'off', 'Venezuela', 'wherever', 'die', 'apparently.So', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'loping', 'ER', 'haunt', 'job', 'hallucinating', 'Emily', 'presence', 'hearing', 'speak', 'dying', 'patients', 'kids', 'cancer', 'Joe', 'obsessed', 'discovering', 'not', 'dead', 'comatose', 'can', 'communicate', 'really', 'cool', 'Costner', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'plethora', 'skilled', 'emoting', 'here.I', 'loved', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'feisty', 'nun', 'who', 'expert', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'NDEs', 'writing', 'film', 'times', 'bordered', 'offensive', 'Joe', 'way', 'dying', 'kids', 'make', 'perfect', 'laboratory', 'near-death', 'experience', 'information', 'What', 'hell', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'can', 'guess', 'rest', 'never', 'ending', 'Joe', 'having', 'been', 'ordered', 'sabbatical', 'land', 'strange', 'Indians', 'bananas', 'giant', 'mosquitoes', 'snakes', 'see', 'wife', 'survived', 'accident', 'not', 'What', 'will', 'leave', 'discover', 'weird', 'desert', 'sort', 'unmatched', 'untried', 'cinematic', 'history', 'third', 'star', 'alone.Costner', 'apparently', 'left', 'directing', 'days', 'more', 'pity', 'DANCES', 'WITH', 'WOLVES', 'WYATT', 'EARP', 'either', 'one', 'was', 'sufficient', 'cement', 'Costner', 'directing', 'power', 'simply', 'sunk', 'back', 'mediocre', 'thing', 'along', 'film', 'bored', 'enough', 'times', 'make', 'start', 'trying', 'recall', 'what', 'was', 'gizmo', 'Costner', 'tried', 'sell', 'BP', 'stop', 'oil', 'spill.In', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'DRAGONFLY', 'substitutes', 'are', 'tons', 'Dragonflies', 'there', 'worth', 'one', 'viewing', 'Not', 'anything', 'ending', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'comparison', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'thing', 'flat', 'wife', 'did', 'say', 'was', 'excessively', 'spooky', 'dead', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'around', 'doing', 'sorts', 'things', 'loved', 'ones']",N/A

""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a chilling supernatural thriller where a man obsessed with the drawings of his dead wife finds his way to a town where people are getting messages from the unknown.  ""Dragonfly"" is a syrupy tale about a despondent man obsessed with the drawings of children claiming to be in contact with his dead wife that lead him to the unknown.  A coincidence?  I doubt it.The films are different as night and day.  Mothman is a true supernatural thriller, replete with suspense, fright and eerie messages from the other side.  Dragonfly attempts to be a transcendent romance with love so strong that death cannot contain it.  There is nothing remotely spooky about it.  Most of the film concentrates on Joe's (Kevin Costner) inability to cope with the death of his wife.The film drags, with Joe traversing the same emotional ground again and again.  We keep having scenes repeated over and over between Joe and the children who contacted his wife, and Joe puling to Mrs. Belmont (Kathy Bates) who keeps trying to talk some sense into him.  The final scenes in Venezuela border on goofy, but to the writers' credit at least the ending wasn't totally predictable.Kevin Costner gives us his standard depressed nice-guy rendition only a bit whinier than usual.  Kathy Bates is feisty as always as his stalwart friend.  Linda Hunt is intense in her role as the nun who believes in near death experiences.This film is far too sappy to be a thriller and misses the romantic interaction of films like ""Ghost"" and ""Always"" in its attempt to be transcendent.  It fails to distinguish itself in any meaningful way and slides aimlessly into mediocrity.  I rated it 5/10.

The main reason I went is because I enjoy films about the supernatural and this one didn't disappoint.  When Joe loses his wife in a bus accident, he is unable to get past her death.  A disbeliever, he is sure that he will never see her again until he begins to visit a children's ward and begins to receive messages through the dying children.  From there on, he has to struggle with these signs and visitations, trying to figure out what is happening to him and if she still might be alive.This film is very frightening and the building suspense works very well.  Its a subtle yet frightening film that will give you goosebumps if you watch it late at night.  Both frightening and at the end uplifting, its a great film with a superb performance by Kevin Costner.  To me this is one of his better films.

Kevin Costner plays a doctor, who, after his wife's tragic death, is perplexed when a rash of ""supernatural"" events take place in his home and the hospital he works in. He believes his wife may be trying to connect to him in some way, but others are skeptical, believing that there is some rational explanation for the occurances. He continues to look for clues and tries to uncover the truths about his wife's death.One negative about this movie was the apparent lack of depth to some characters. Kevin Costner, in his role as Joe, seems to just be going through the motions at times, rather than acting. It is not a problem that detracts from the overall impression of the movie, but it is a slight problem nonetheless. Also, I felt like Joe's supervisor at the hospital was kind of a ""stock"" character, playing the mean-spirited supervisor who tells Joe he needs to take a break from his role as doctor and then gets angry with Joe when Joe tries to go back to the hospital.Another negative is the ending. This could have been done better. It just seemed kind of far-fetched. I won't give it away, you'll just have to see it yourself and decide.Despite the negatives, this was an enjoyable movie to watch. It was finally one of those movies that was both gripping and enlightening at the same time. There are a few ""edge-of-your-seat"" parts when Joe is alone in the house (when he doesn't really feel alone). However, they don't overdo these, and most of the story concentrates on the plot. Joe's journey is discovering what life and death truly mean.Rating :  3 1/2",3,3.5 Stars,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,1670,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'taking', 'relatively', 'original', 'idea', 'running', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'doctor', 'who', 'wife', 'tragic', 'death', 'perplexed', 'when', 'rash', 'supernatural', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'home', 'hospital', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'connect', 'way', 'others', 'are', 'skeptical', 'believing', 'rational', 'explanation', 'occurances', 'look', 'clues', 'tries', 'uncover', 'truths', 'wife', 'death.One', 'negative', 'movie', 'was', 'apparent', 'lack', 'depth', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'role', 'Joe', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'times', 'rather', 'acting', 'not', 'problem', 'overall', 'impression', 'movie', 'slight', 'problem', 'nonetheless', 'Also', 'felt', 'Joe', 'supervisor', 'hospital', 'was', 'kind', 'stock', 'character', 'playing', 'mean-spirited', 'supervisor', 'who', 'Joe', 'take', 'break', 'role', 'doctor', 'then', 'angry', 'Joe', 'when', 'Joe', 'go', 'back', 'hospital.Another', 'negative', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'seemed', 'kind', 'far-fetched', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'decide.Despite', 'negatives', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'was', 'finally', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'gripping', 'enlightening', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'parts', 'when', 'Joe', 'alone', 'house', 'when', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'alone', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'most', 'story', 'plot', 'Joe', 'journey', 'discovering', 'what', 'life', 'death', 'truly', 'mean.Rating', '3', '1/2']",N/A

If the first third of the film has some problems, the picture improves notably since the dialogue with the children and then you will be a honr guest to participate of an intimate and powerful message. The use of the dragonfly as the vehicle between both worlds was a real hit!I must recognize this theme required perhaps a major approach and the presence of a script more ellaborated.If Jean Cocteau has been the supreme master in these journeys to the death considered as the last frontier, Orpheus showed us that the same death may fall in love with the life and sacrifice by its own to find its bliss.The personal tragedy of Joe Darrow due his beloved wife' s death will be the first step to establish an unavoidable call from the death's world. And the reason why will constitute the dramatic device, the haunting ending when the death bets for the life and wins.The film has little details; it's far to be a pretentious puzzle mind; it's very simple to follow the clues. Kathy Bates is splendid in that secondary role as the material lawyer who supports the emotional and emotive fissures of Dr. Darrow, but even she is not able to avoid the boring dialogue. She makes all what she can, but sometimes it os not enough.Somehow, this movie might be the complement vision of the Sixth sense.

It is interesting because of the way it describes the reactions of normal people in front of something, or someone that does not satisfy their expectations of what they call sanity. Anything or anyone that looks suspiciously insane in our society is at once rejected, becomes suspicious, and is supposed to be pushed aside into some kind of social sabbatical, or even worse is hassled by the guardians of normality in our social order, i.e. priests, and cops, and doctors. The point is that the story that supports this fact is so hectic and farfetched that it gets the true fact down the chute along with the unbelievable elements in the story. Believing is essential, provided what is believed is believable. Otherwise the film becomes pure entertainment, and it is too somber to be pure entertainment.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,Believing is not necessarily enough,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,1707,"['amazing', 'thriller', 'kind', 'logic', 'Everything', 'wrong', 'resolutely', 'wrong', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'doctor', 'mind', 'take', 'bunch', 'kids', 'jungle', 'deep', 'Venezuela', 'adventurous', 'sabbatical', 'accident', 'school', 'bus', 'down', 'river', 'survivors', 'husband', 'doctor', 'then', 'victim', 'visions', 'hallucinations', 'seizures', 'kind', 'very', 'quickly', 'signs', 'trying', 'speak', 'where', 'thus', 'led', 'going', 'back', 'where', 'died', 'village', 'Indians', 'living', 'foot', 'waterfall', 'where', 'met', 'fate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'interesting', 'thrilling', 'suspense', 'rather', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'interesting', 'way', 'reactions', 'normal', 'people', 'front', 'something', 'someone', 'not', 'satisfy', 'expectations', 'what', 'call', 'sanity', 'Anything', 'anyone', 'suspiciously', 'insane', 'society', 'once', 'rejected', 'suspicious', 'supposed', 'be', 'pushed', 'aside', 'kind', 'social', 'sabbatical', 'even', 'worse', 'hassled', 'guardians', 'normality', 'social', 'order', 'i.e', 'priests', 'cops', 'doctors', 'point', 'story', 'fact', 'so', 'hectic', 'farfetched', 'true', 'fact', 'chute', 'unbelievable', 'elements', 'story', 'Believing', 'essential', 'provided', 'what', 'believed', 'believable', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'too', 'somber', 'be', 'pure', 'entertainment.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Kathy Bates does a great job as Joe's helpful neighbor, Miriam Belmont. Susanna Thompson also does a great job as Dr. Emily Darrow. The director, Tom Shadyac, also dis a fantastic job.The DVD is really good, but what else would you expect from Universal. The picture quality is crystal clear. The sound is aas good as ever on a DVD. The special features include: an audio commentary by the director, deleted scenes, a featurette on the making of the movie, and much more.Dragonfly is about Dr. Joe Darrow who is having trouble believing his wife is dead. Everyone around him tries to help, but he wont accept it. One night in the hospital he hears a little boy yell &quot;JOE!&quot;. All of a sudden a boy flatlines and is rushed into the emergency room. They believe he's dead. Dr. Joe walks ur to him and he comes alive. The next day he goes to see the little boy. The little boy says he saw him in the emergency room the night before, but that he saw him from the roof. He said that his wife had something ergent to tell him. The little boy couldn't remember what it was. Joe's misson is now to find out what his wife wanted him to know. Many eerie things happen that he can't explain.Overall Dragonfly is A+ work.

In WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN, he tried mightily to portray himself as a dashing adventure hero.  He fizzled in both, but these two films had much else to recommend them.  What we see in DRAGONFLY is a fuzzy movie that is all dressed up in themes from other movies, but winds up having no place to go.  In DRAGONFLY, the viewer is not sure whether he is watching a standard ghost/reincarnation movie, an exciting save-the-lost-wife film, or a man who must come to grips with accepting his loss movie.  What the viewer gets, instead, is some weird New Age mess that borrows shamelessly from the symbol-driven but more successful THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Costner plays Joe Darrow, an emergency room doctor who is happily married to Emily (Suzanna Thompson).  She takes off for Columbia to tend to the needy sick.  They argue about this, but since he cannot stop her anyway, off she goes, even though she is heavily pregnant.  There is an unwritten rule that whenever the female lead is pregnant, that pregnancy must somehow function into the plot.  Thus, when she and a busload of natives are swept away by a flood, the viewer is sure that her pregnancy is not a moot issue.  Joe has trouble accepting the reality of her death, mostly because he sees not so subtle ghostly hints that her spirit, if not her body, still inhabits this earthly plane.  I have a problem with accepting any movie that purports to be scary if in trying to be so, the evidence usually resides in a corpse suddenly reanimating in a way that only the hero can see.  Such an approach reminds me of alien encounter movies in which only the hero in solitude can see the spaceship.  Further, I distrust movies that rely on maps to invigorate the plot.  By mid-movie, Joe looks at a map, sees some by now recognizable symbols of spiritual possession, and he (and we) know what comes next. Lost in this mishmash is a superb supporting performance by Kathy Bates, who seems to relish her second banana status.  Ultimately, THE DRAGONFLY is the sort of movie whose obviously high pretensions of ghostly status instead degenerate into a brief itch that is resolved only by swatting away that annoying dragonfly.",2,Dragonfly: Annoys Rather Than Entertains,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,2261,"['DRAGONFLY', 'not', 'first', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'lead', 'WATERWORLD', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'tried', 'mightily', 'portray', 'dashing', 'adventure', 'hero', 'fizzled', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'much', 'else', 'recommend', 'What', 'see', 'DRAGONFLY', 'fuzzy', 'movie', 'dressed', 'up', 'themes', 'other', 'movies', 'up', 'having', 'place', 'go', 'DRAGONFLY', 'viewer', 'not', 'sure', 'watching', 'standard', 'ghost/reincarnation', 'movie', 'exciting', 'save-the-lost-wife', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'accepting', 'loss', 'movie', 'What', 'viewer', 'instead', 'weird', 'New', 'Age', 'mess', 'shamelessly', 'symbol-driven', 'more', 'successful', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT.Costner', 'Joe', 'Darrow', 'emergency', 'room', 'doctor', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'Emily', 'Suzanna', 'Thompson', 'Columbia', 'tend', 'needy', 'sick', 'argue', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'anyway', 'even', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'unwritten', 'rule', 'whenever', 'female', 'lead', 'pregnant', 'pregnancy', 'must', 'somehow', 'function', 'plot', 'Thus', 'when', 'busload', 'natives', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'flood', 'viewer', 'sure', 'pregnancy', 'not', 'moot', 'issue', 'Joe', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'reality', 'death', 'mostly', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'ghostly', 'hints', 'spirit', 'not', 'body', 'still', 'earthly', 'plane', 'have', 'problem', 'accepting', 'movie', 'be', 'scary', 'trying', 'be', 'so', 'evidence', 'usually', 'corpse', 'suddenly', 'reanimating', 'way', 'only', 'hero', 'can', 'see', 'approach', 'alien', 'encounter', 'movies', 'only', 'hero', 'solitude', 'can', 'see', 'spaceship', 'Further', 'distrust', 'movies', 'rely', 'maps', 'invigorate', 'plot', 'mid-movie', 'Joe', 'map', 'now', 'recognizable', 'symbols', 'spiritual', 'possession', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'Lost', 'mishmash', 'superb', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'relish', 'second', 'banana', 'status', 'Ultimately', 'THE', 'DRAGONFLY', 'sort', 'movie', 'obviously', 'high', 'pretensions', 'ghostly', 'status', 'instead', 'degenerate', 'brief', 'itch', 'resolved', 'only', 'swatting', 'away', 'annoying', 'dragonfly']",N/A

I suppose it's a rhetorical question because, whenever a movie asks such a question, its answer is invariably ""No way!"" Otherwise, there would be no movie.There is the hope / dream / belief in almost all mankind that there is something beyond life as we know it. But, I suspect that, if anyone called you from the beyond the way Kevin Costner's dead wife does in ""Dragonfly"", you'd wind up in a mental institution before you found out what she was trying to tell you. Actually, the secret she's trying to reveal is kind of neat. Too bad the movie's makers felt it necessary to resort to obvious and pedestrian storytelling.Costner plays Joe Darrow, an emergency room doctor. His wife [Susanna Thompson], also a doctor, dies in a flood in Venezuela, where she has gone to treat an indigenous tribe. Joe doesn't have much of a spiritual side, but that doesn't stop his wife's ghost from blowing out light bulbs, rearranging the house, moving objects, driving the couple's pet parrot insane, and, best of all, reaching out to Joe through the near-death experiences of former child patients of hers.On and on the movie goes. Not trusting the audience to accept subtle clues and messages, it hits us over the head with obvious signs and events. Its methodology is to rely on gullible viewers' desire to believe in the most simplistic and silly New Age ideas.Sadly, ""Dragonfly"" does nothing to revive the flagging career of Mr. Costner, who is entirely wrong for the role.

Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2  Ever since it hit pay dirt with ""Ghost"" back in the summer of 1990, Hollywood has been fascinated with tales about dead people attempting to contact their grieving loved ones from beyond the grave.  The latest variation on the theme, a film called ""Dragonfly,"" turns out to be one of the sappiest entries in the genre.In the film, Kevin Costner, sporting a noticeable paunch for the occasion, plays Dr. Joe Darrow, a well-respected Chicago surgeon, whose wife dies in a bus accident while she is working as part of a Red Cross operation in rural Venezuela.  Almost immediately after her death, Joe begins to experience a series of strange phenomena that seem to suggest that the spirit of Emily may be trying to get in touch with her distraught husband in order to deliver some kind of profound message to him.  As in virtually all films of this type, Joe starts off, rather predictably, as an agnostic cynic, a by-the-book science type who pooh-poohs anything that he can't experience and verify through the use of his own five senses.  He needs, obviously, to be taught a lesson, to be shown that a reality exists beyond the scope of mere mortal comprehension.  And who better to teach him that lesson than a dead wife whom the doubter clearly loved and cherished?  Then, when he begins to come over to the other side, to actually start believing in the existence of a world beyond our own, he has a devil of a time trying to convince anyone around him that he is not simply going off his rocker as a result of the enormous psychic shock inflicted by his wife's death.To make this sort of nonsense palatable, one would need a lot more originality and depth than are exhibited here (two qualities that ""Ghost"" had in abundance, by the way).  Part of the problem is that this Grieving Widower Syndrome seems to have been done to death in the past several years, most recently in ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" which also featured a man getting in touch with the supernatural after the demise of his dearly beloved wife.  (Moths, dragonflies?  Is there a pattern here?)  This technique of killing off an adored spouse seems to have become the easiest and tritest way to achieve the ""sensitive man"" character that certain women seem to require for a successful romantic drama.  One wonders why men in movies seem to be this enamored of their wives only when the women themselves wind up dead.  In fact, the rule seems to be that the happier a marriage seems at the beginning of a movie, the more likely it is that one or the other of the spouses will be departing the scene not long after the opening credits have rolled by (usually determined by which of the two is the lesser star).""Dragonfly"" tires hard to achieve an ethereal quality, but the mundane script keeps it relentlessly earthbound.  The film is neither suspenseful nor romantic nor intriguing enough to make it truly effective as either a thriller, a love story, a fantasy or - as the film undoubtedly would prefer - a combination of all three.Instead, think of ""Dragonfly"" as merely ""Ghost-Lite.""",2,"""Ghost"" - Lite",1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,3061,"['**1/2', 'Ever', 'hit', 'pay', 'dirt', 'Ghost', 'back', 'summer', '1990', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'fascinated', 'tales', 'dead', 'people', 'attempting', 'contact', 'grieving', 'loved', 'ones', 'grave', 'latest', 'variation', 'theme', 'film', 'called', 'Dragonfly', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'sappiest', 'entries', 'genre.In', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'sporting', 'noticeable', 'paunch', 'occasion', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'Darrow', 'well-respected', 'Chicago', 'surgeon', 'wife', 'bus', 'accident', 'working', 'part', 'Red', 'Cross', 'operation', 'rural', 'Venezuela', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'death', 'Joe', 'experience', 'series', 'strange', 'phenomena', 'seem', 'suggest', 'spirit', 'Emily', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'get', 'touch', 'distraught', 'husband', 'order', 'deliver', 'kind', 'profound', 'message', 'virtually', 'films', 'type', 'Joe', 'rather', 'predictably', 'agnostic', 'cynic', 'by-the-book', 'science', 'type', 'who', 'pooh-poohs', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'experience', 'verify', 'use', 'own', 'five', 'senses', 'obviously', 'be', 'taught', 'lesson', 'be', 'shown', 'reality', 'scope', 'mere', 'mortal', 'comprehension', 'who', 'better', 'teach', 'lesson', 'dead', 'wife', 'whom', 'doubter', 'clearly', 'loved', 'cherished', 'Then', 'when', 'come', 'other', 'side', 'actually', 'start', 'believing', 'existence', 'world', 'own', 'devil', 'time', 'trying', 'convince', 'anyone', 'not', 'simply', 'going', 'off', 'rocker', 'result', 'enormous', 'psychic', 'shock', 'inflicted', 'wife', 'death.To', 'make', 'sort', 'nonsense', 'palatable', 'one', 'would', 'need', 'lot', 'more', 'originality', 'depth', 'are', 'exhibited', 'here', 'two', 'qualities', 'Ghost', 'had', 'abundance', 'way', 'Part', 'problem', 'Grieving', 'Widower', 'Syndrome', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'most', 'recently', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'also', 'featured', 'man', 'getting', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'demise', 'dearly', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Moths', 'dragonflies', 'there', 'pattern', 'here', 'technique', 'killing', 'off', 'adored', 'spouse', 'have', 'become', 'easiest', 'tritest', 'way', 'achieve', 'sensitive', 'man', 'character', 'certain', 'women', 'seem', 'require', 'successful', 'romantic', 'drama', 'One', 'why', 'men', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'enamored', 'wives', 'only', 'when', 'women', 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'fact', 'rule', 'be', 'happier', 'marriage', 'beginning', 'movie', 'more', 'likely', 'one', 'other', 'spouses', 'will', 'be', 'departing', 'scene', 'not', 'long', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'usually', 'determined', 'two', 'lesser', 'star', 'Dragonfly', 'hard', 'achieve', 'ethereal', 'quality', 'mundane', 'script', 'relentlessly', 'earthbound', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'romantic', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'make', 'truly', 'effective', 'thriller', 'love', 'story', 'fantasy', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'would', 'prefer', 'combination', 'three.Instead', 'think', 'Dragonfly', 'merely', 'Ghost-Lite']",N/A

I know to make the story work - Joe's character had to debate with a doubter co-worker - but I found this character a bit too annoying. Overall - I love this movie. Fairly deep about the concepts of the 'After-Life' and/or 'NDE' experiences. Here's the part I can't stand about the Director's commentary; Tom Shadyac's memory sucks for remembering the secondary actors/actresses - he couldn't even bother to have notes of their names or have one of his helpers do some prep work for this bonus audio. He kept saying, 'Oh - I forget this actor's name. - But they did a great job.' Or 'I know I'm saying this actress's name wrong, But she is wonderful!'. Come on you lazy bum!! - If they did such a great job (and they did) - at least look up their names and get them right!! - Why doesn't he forget or mislabel his own name in the credits!! I won't give away the ending. I will say for me - it is more of an ending that is for women.

And now Emily's `Joe' in Dragonfly.Those of you have read my reviews, few as they are, know I hate BS movies (except Deuce Bigalowe). I don't feel poor movies need to be reviewed, but forgotten. This is not a movie to be fotgotten.Joe is an emergency room doctor. his wife is also a doctor, renouned for her kindess and presence. But she dies in a freak bus accident. And Costner plays the deliberate picture of solidarity. But children in the hospital, dying of cancer, tell him she is calling for him. And from there, it begins.To reveal the course of this movie is a crime. Only cheap reviewers give away the flick.I won't.If you do nothing else, rent this movie, and watch it at least once. The blue imaging reminds you of Unbreakable. The calm and subdued pace is a la Sixth Sense, and Costner exudes a sense of loss and sadness I never thought he had in him (except in Dances). And then, cones the weird side. Very much `The Haunting' style (the Liam Neison version) where nothing is shown to you while it is happening, but presented after the fact.Think of when your dad he had you hold the plug wire on the lawn mower while he gave the starter a tug. remember the shocks?

DON'T say anything like &quot;heart-warming&quot; or &quot;spiritual,&quot; misleading her to believe that this is another piece of work like superb &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot;  Yes, though some part of &quot;Dragonfly&quot; is surely giving a life-affirming message to us (in what way, that is another matter), and covers the same territory as &quot;Ghost,&quot; the film contains actually many elements plucked from your regular B horror flicks -- you know, like, sudden big noise or shadow standing by the window.The story is interesting at first.  Chicago ER doctor Joe Darrow (Costner), his wife recently missing in Venezuela and believed to be dead, is feeling so devastated that his boss Joe Morton suggests he take a vacaton for a month.  Stubbornly refusing the advice from him, or kindly neighbor Kathy Bates or co-worker Ron Rifkin, Joe continues to work at hospital, and one day he starts to see signs sent from his lost love (so he thinks) -- he sees such messages in a paperweight, mysterious words from a hospitalized boy, and a strangely drawn cross on the floor.  Is it possible that Joe is receiving a message?  Or is he just dreaming?The premise is interesting, but the way the director Tom Shadyac conducts the whole things is simply awful.  When you need very subtle handling of this subject matter, he simply throws every conceivable device at you, trying to attract your  heart like a brick dropping from above.  The film keeps moving  on like, 'here's a surprise,' 'here's a possible logical explanation,' and 'another surprise again,' and ... well, like this, with few delicate touch.  And Mr. Shadyac has directed in the past such films as Jim's &quot;Ace Ventura,&quot; Eddie's &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; and Robin's sugar-coated &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (the last one ridiculed, quite understandaly, in one John Waters film).  On and on this endless story goes until the climax (before one needless action segment ala Butch and Sundance, and a beautiful rainbow -- the same 'butterfly device' he employed in &quot;Patch&quot;) which, I frankly want to say folks, is too unbelievable.There are so many unwise choices; see, for example, the casting of Joe's wife Emily played by Susanna Thompson, who was previously seen in Harrison Ford's &quot;Random Hearts&quot; where she played Mr Ford's wife.  If I am not mistaken, her role there undergoes a very similar situation there.  This is worse than typecast; it gives me the taste of run-of-the-mill pre-production process.  Or see the name of David Seltzer as a co-writer of the script.  Remember his name?  He wrote a bestseller called &quot;The Omen,&quot; and the director is from &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;?  What a combination, anyway?Please, Kevin Costner's fans, don't say this half-hearted film is good.

Kevin Costner appears a Joe Darrow, a recently widowed doctor. Probably widowed, because his wife's body was never found after a tragic end to her third-world relief mission.But is she really gone? As a doctor, Joe comes in contact with many patients who are or once were close to death - whatever 'death' means. When they come back, they bring a message from her to Joe, and the urgency of that message seems to ratchet up day by day. It sends Joe on a mission of his own, deep into the jungle to the place where she died ...Saying more would say too much, but the last third of the movie makes it worthwhile. Not just the action but the personal drama reach levels that the movie's first big part never hinted at. If you can get past the early part, the movie's powerful ending makes up for the wait.-- wiredweird",4,Enjoyable sleeper,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,885,"['material', 'potential', 'off', 'snoozable', 'start', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Joe', 'Darrow', 'recently', 'widowed', 'doctor', 'Probably', 'widowed', 'wife', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'tragic', 'end', 'third-world', 'relief', 'mission.But', 'really', 'gone', 'doctor', 'Joe', 'contact', 'many', 'patients', 'who', 'are', 'once', 'were', 'close', 'death', 'means', 'When', 'come', 'back', 'bring', 'message', 'Joe', 'urgency', 'message', 'ratchet', 'up', 'day', 'day', 'Joe', 'mission', 'own', 'deep', 'jungle', 'place', 'where', 'died', 'Saying', 'more', 'would', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'Not', 'just', 'action', 'personal', 'drama', 'reach', 'levels', 'movie', 'first', 'big', 'part', 'never', 'hinted', 'can', 'get', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'powerful', 'ending', 'up', 'wait.', 'wiredweird']",N/A
