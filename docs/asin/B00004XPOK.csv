""The Man"" is whoever is in power over the decent, hard working common folk.Billy Jack takes on ""The Man"" in this great DVD collection.

Better watch out when Billy Jack takes off his boots!Billy Jack is not some mindless machine of violence. He usually ends up in a debate with Jean, the woman he loves, over the use of violence as a problem solving tactic.By today's standards, these movies are kinda slow, full of dialog and debate over civil rights, government corruption, and being hassled by ""The Man.""

Billy Jack was a war hero of a hated war.  On top of that he was a half-breed Indian/White mix who lived on the reservation and was its policeman.  All of these facts helped to make the films great (in particular, Billy Jack).  They get into Native American Mysticism and draw a clear line in the sand between right and wrong.  They may not have the best scripts, nor the best acting, but they are definitely among the best B-movies ever made.  Additionally, Billy Jack had the best theme song ever.  ""One Tin Soldier"" by Coven was even banned from the radio for a time.  The message of the song and the movie definitely go hand and hand.

I bought it because I'd seen the first 3 films when I was a kid and wanted to see them again out of nostalgia. I also wanted to see the 4th film - now that I have I can see why it never really got released. It's easily the worst of the lot.It's funny to see hippies and wannabe flower children praising this dreck. Laughlin's message of pacificity and non-violence is laughable when the moments everyone watches these films for are the ones where Billy takes off his boots and delivers a whooping to ""The Man"". Doesn't anyone see the hypocrisy in this?Look how the ""Freedom School"" students behave. They come across as pretty angry in the second film, and the violence in the third film is totally their fault. What about the ""peace"" and ""love"" they keep harping about? The evil townspeople are more reasonable than the supposedly peaceful hippie kids!Also, Laughlin should have learned the fine art of the edit. There are line flubs that were just left in the film, and as tortuously long as these films are, you have to get the feeling that he put everything he shot into the finished product. Boring speeches, tedious dialogue and horrid folk songs abound! And don't get me started on all of the street-theater and rap-session junk.Look - Tom Laughlin made a few movies that were wildly successful and made himself a ton of money, that can't be disputed. The first movie is actually not that bad, and the Billy Jack character is at least reasonable in that film. But it all went to hell in a handbasket after that - the last 3 films were pretty horrid.To all of you who are lauding this stuff, really watch these movies and see what message Laughlin was trying to send - really tune in to his worldview at the time. He saw this country as a hate-filled, ugly nation, and the paranoia represented is over the top. Here's where the grandiosity complex comes in. Who can save us all but someone like Billy Jack? Even though he's the biggest hypocrite of the lot (but I don't think we're supposed to notice that), he's represented as a force of ""good"". That's highly debatable if you really look at Billy Jack's actions. Look at the stuff Laughlin has written since these films - it's almost like he thinks he really is this movie antihero he's made up.Laughlin tapped into the counterculture psyche and made a fortune's worth of that filthy green money that hippies so despised. Ironic, hm?I gave this collection 2 stars only because if you want to torture yourself or a loved one or few, $15 for the set is a good deal.

The acting is bad, but it has many great lines and the subject matter is solid. It just has bad acting similar to a lot of late-sixties movies. ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is probably the best movie of the collection. It has the best acting and some really good film work.

A movie that led to films like ""Walking Tall"", ""Macon County Line"" and more.  These movies are very dated, but fun to watch.

556681,A34UX3N0AO73CK,B00004XPOK,HollyNYC,"[2, 2]","""The Complete Billy Jack Collection"" is suitable for inclusion in a time capsule of pop cultural artifacts from the decade of the 1970s. The Billy Jack films helped to capture and define the zeitgeist of that remarkable decade in American history. And, as movie-watching experiences, the films (mostly) work on a certain, B-movie level. At times the acting and camerawork can border on the amateurish, but for Billy Jack fans that is part of their charm. Tom Laughlin always valued the sincere over the slick, which kept him well out of the Hollywood mainstream. The irony is that in his way he was a filmmaker in the truest myth-making Hollywood tradition.This collection contains all four Billy jack films, beginning with ""Born Losers,"" a 1967 AIP release with a typical storyline about anti-social yet sexually alluring motorcycle gang members and the groovy mixed-up chicks who love them.  What elevates ""Born Losers"" is Laughlin's performance as Billy Jack, a Vietnam vet trying to readjust to a society that is in the throes of generational and political meltdown. Laughlin here begins establishing himself as a cinematic persona to be reckoned with, placing himself in the great movie tradition of stolid, mostly silent leading men, the type of hero who is a step or two outside of the general community and is slow to anger , but once he does get going not a bad guy is left standing. In essence, Laughlin is trying to create a  Gary Cooper/John Wayne-style  hero for the growing counter-culture.The second film, ""Billy Jack,"" is where Laughlin hit the commercial jackpot, winning the hearts of young people everywhere looking for a hero the Establishment couldn't kill, imprison, or buy out. In ""Billy Jack"" Laughlin turns the Western genre on its head, both subverting it while paying homage at the same time. Unlike the traditional western, where the hero protects the townspeople from the ""Others"" living on the outskirts, threatening all that is good and holy in American civilization, this time the hero is defending the ""Others"" (the multi-racial students at the special school being run on an Indian reservation) from the townspeople. The movie's conclusion is one of the most memorable film endings  since ""Spartacus.""""Billy Jack"" had two sequels, also included here, ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" (1974) and ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" (1977). ""Trial"" is in many ways the most ambitious of the Billy Jack films, clocking in at close to three hours (but it never really drags) and focusing on the question of violence so prevalent in American society. The trial here is not so much Billy jack's  legal one (which only occupies the first 15 minutes or so of the movie)  as Billy Jack's spiritual trial as he struggles to overcome his own violent demons, set against a backdrop of government-sanctioned massacres ranging from Vietnamese villages to American campuses. A ""vision quest"" sequence in the desert, in which Billy Jack sees how various types of people respond to  violence, contains the most important message you'll ever see in a movie.""Washington"" is a real curiosity. The movie never had a commercial release, but a series of screenings seems to have earned it status as a  1977 feature film. While ""Washington"" is in many ways the most technically competent film in the series, and features such mainstream performers such as E.G. Marshall and Sam Wanamaker, it suffers from heavy cutting and re-editing (the Leonard Maltin Guide gives it a running time of 155 minutes, the version in this collection clocks in at 114 minutes). A storyline concerning a shadowy conspiracy involving a nuclear power industry scandal which dominates much of the first half of the film is virtually absent in the film's second hour. Indeed, much of the last half of the film is about a filibuster staged by Billy Jack, now a senator. This was back in the day when a filibuster was a historic, stop-the-presses event, not the routine everyday Senate way of conducting (or not conducting) business that it is today. The film is interesting in how it parallels the journey America took from the late 1960s, the age of Johnson & Nixon, to the late 1970s, with the Bicentennial and the election of Jimmy Carter. Most Americans were still willing to believe the country was good at heart, and its governing institutions could still work, if only the voice of the people could be heard, and the public good would overcome the special interests and back-room deal makers. Americans would never be so innocent again.have always believed that Laughlin was under-rated as a filmmaker, andThe Complete Billy Jack Collection (Born Losers/Billy Jack/The Trial of Billy Jack/Billy Jack Goes to Washington)confirms it. Critics have tended to focus on what they see as Laughlin's simplistic utopianism politics or perceived hypocrisy in preaching peace while delivering  plenty of karate chops and martial arts action.Close viewing of this movies, however, reveals that Laughlin was more nuanced that critics gave him credit for. In ""Billy Jack"", for example, the main villain is a young man about the same age as the target audience. The film's main authority figure, the town sheriff, is depicted as a basically decent man, trying to hold the center together. Neither side in the generational conflict, Laughlin is saying, has a monopoly on good and evil. In the Kent State-style massacre that concludes ""Trial,"" the National Guardsmen are depicted as nervous kids, placed in a high stress situation by powerful forces beyond their control, a metaphor for soldiers in any war any where.As for the charges of hypocrisy, Laughlin the filmmaker knows that movies have to work on an emotional level, and yes, for many in the audience seeing bigoted rednecks or CIA assassins getting karate kicks to the head can be a cathartic  experience. And the movies do wrestle with the ethical question of the role of violence in effecting social change, a dilemma  many were struggling with in the wake of the riots and assassinations of the late 1960s. I believe Laughlin deserves credit for facing these type of issues head-on, instead of just ducking them.The movies in ""The Complete Billy jack Collection"" have excellent sight and sound quality, and include audio commentary by the filmmakers.""Billy Jack"" alone is probably an essential must-have for any movie collector who wants a representative sample of movies that defined the 1970s. This ""Complete Collection"" gives you four movies essentially for the price of one. You may not always agree with Laughlin's politics or you may at times roll your eyes at some of the bad production values and acting (check out Elizabeth James' performance in ""Born Losers"" which is a clinic in out of this world line readings) but you won't find many other movies released in the past 40 years that are anything like them.",4,One Tin Soldier,1372982400,"07 5,

One thing about &#34;Billy Jack&#34; films, they decline in government confidence with each movie on. It is a very immature set of bully films where evil landowners,and especially big daddy government, rape and kill innocent passive minded liberals and Indians in particular. They are period pieces, centered in the 70s. The Trial of Billy Jack places him in Vietnam when Lt. William Caley gives the order to kill a bunch of innocent civilians with Jack refusing to participate and subsequently placed in custody and that is the positive part! The last film IS Mr. Smith Goes to Washington almost to a &#34;T&#34;, which is probably the reason it was never released. The Government is really bad, post-Watergate and Nixon and uses everything at it's disposal to cheat honest men and women. Well, who would have thought that Billy Jack films would be somewhat prophetic in this day and age! As we enter an age where Government resembles something out of an Orwell novel, even Billy Jack can't Karate the technology laden evil that pervades modern society. This leads us to consider what would a Billy Jack character do about the situation today? He'd probably be an &#34;Oath Keeper&#34;, appear on &#34;Coast to Coast&#34;, join Chuck Norris in a political strategy and be the new spokesman for the NRA....and be a victim of a remote missile fired from a drone flying over Indian territory in Arizona.",4,From Born Losers to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1505,"['first', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'film', '34', 'Born', 'Losers', '34', 'something', 'day', 'was', 'new', 'interesting', 'One', 'thing', '34', 'Billy', 'Jack', '34', 'films', 'decline', 'government', 'confidence', 'movie', 'very', 'immature', 'set', 'bully', 'films', 'where', 'evil', 'landowners', 'especially', 'big', 'daddy', 'government', 'rape', 'kill', 'innocent', 'passive', 'minded', 'liberals', 'Indians', 'particular', 'are', 'period', 'pieces', 'centered', '70s', 'Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Vietnam', 'when', 'Lt.', 'William', 'Caley', 'order', 'kill', 'bunch', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'Jack', 'refusing', 'participate', 'subsequently', 'placed', 'custody', 'positive', 'part', 'last', 'film', 'IS', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'almost', '34', 'T', '34', 'probably', 'reason', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'Government', 'really', 'bad', 'post-Watergate', 'Nixon', 'everything', 'disposal', 'cheat', 'honest', 'men', 'women', 'Well', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'prophetic', 'day', 'age', 'enter', 'age', 'where', 'Government', 'something', 'Orwell', 'novel', 'even', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Karate', 'technology', 'laden', 'evil', 'modern', 'society', 'consider', 'what', 'would', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'character', 'do', 'situation', 'today', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', '34', 'Oath', 'Keeper', '34', 'appear', '34', 'Coast', 'Coast', '34', 'join', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'political', 'strategy', 'be', 'new', 'spokesman', 'NRA', '.and', 'be', 'victim', 'remote', 'missile', 'fired', 'drone', 'flying', 'Indian', 'territory', 'Arizona']",Billy Jack

Ever since I first saw Tom Laughlin in ""Born Losers"" in the role he created I've been a fan of Billy Jack.Thanks to Image Entertainment fans of Tom Laughlin can once again experience the world of ""Billy Jack"" in this incredible 4 disc boxed set. Image Entertainment states that all 4 films feature a new spectacular high-definition digital transfer for unsurpassed film quality! While the films have been cleaned up considerably for this DVD release, the transfers still suffer from little blemishes here and there but nothing to detract from the overall viewing experience. These new video transfers are better than any previous versions I've ever seen and the new 5.1 surround sound is a definite improvement in my opinion.This fantastic 4 disc set from Image Entertainment is well done and any ""Billy Jack"" fan would be happy to own it. The disc packaging is great. Each disc comes in a nicely decorated slim case with slip cover and disc artwork. Each film contains two Audio Commentaries from the filmmakers and I personally found them very interesting. Tom Laughlin fans can now rejoice ""Billy Jack"" is here to stay!Film Breakdown:Born Losers:  A motorcycle gang harasses the residents of a small town and Billy Jack saves the day.Billy Jack: Billy Jack is a karate expert who protects a school from a group of local bigots.Trial of Billy Jack: The sequel to Billy Jack. Billy Jack is found guilty and sent to prison. Upon his release from prison he is forced to save the students of the school again.Billy Jack Goes to Washington: Billy Jack gives Washington a taste of real Justice using his hands and feet.

That being said, I always try to review a video that is rated way to high or low.  This video deserves a ""minus 5"" for many reasons. First the sound quality was totally lacking with cracking, popping and with horrible volume fluctuations and listening to the low budget ""fireside"" songs were pure torture. The student composition and reason for being of the unbelievably ridiculous school charter, and actions of the townspeople was totally amateurish. The combination of terrible wrting and directing even for T. C. Frank made it worse. This low budget video obviously used unskilled actors with a weak story line and plagued with time filling ""skits"". Even the ""kung Fu"" actions shots were obviously choreographed in slow motion, and played back at high speed. This 40 year old film was re-released with the promotional catch phrase of ""A box-office success with an attractive plot for modern-day youth' while clever, it lacked any realistic basis. Even the amateurish acting was over done or totally lacking and the long songs to fill up the almost 2 hours of film was embarrassingly high school quality.
