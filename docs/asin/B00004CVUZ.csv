547269,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00004CVUZ,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","Cast a Giant Shadow, 1966 filmThe story begins with newsreels about WW II (to set the background). It is Christmas in 1947 New York City. The major characters were real. Two men are being followed. A lawyers is approached by a Major in the Haganah, who is on a secret mission. [Note the toy machine gun for young boys.] Can the new state of Israel defend itself? Marcus will go to Israel as a military advisor; this won't be a desk job. There is a scene from the past where Colonel Marcus is flown to France. B-17 bombers fly paratroopers (101 Airborne) to France. The French cheer their liberators. ""I don't mean water."" Marcus arrives in Palestine and is greeted. ""Shalom."" An armored bus is attacked by armed men. There is a death penalty for possessing a firearm. [That was like in Occupied France!] The British are leaving, the Arabs are arming themselves.The Arab leaders hate each other, their troops aren't highly motivated. A ship lands immigrants, are they illegal? Can they be stopped? Will changing clothes disguise them? ""Such a stubborn people!"" There is a scene at a concentration camp (tastefully handled). An Arab chief provides entertainment at a meeting. There is humor in a serious political discussion abut arms in Syria. Will they act to destroy these arms? Will there be casualties? Can they get arms? Can they unify the separate groups to act in unison? A convoy of trucks on a road comes under fire. ""Come on, Magda!"" They arrive in Jerusalem. Marcus learns about his wife's illness back home, and returns. `I'm only guessing."" A British diplomat talks to Marcus about the Middle East. Marcus explains the situation to the Lt. General: they need arms for self-defense.A South American cargo plane flies in with Mauser rifles, surplus arms from WW II. Can Israel survive attacks from the Arab countries? Marcus wants to use strategy by attacking with improvised weapons. Can a Piper Cub attack tanks? Audacity? Will the tanks be led into an ambush? The Arab Legion has moved in to cut the road to Jerusalem, where people are starving. Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzer and Titus of Rome; it must be saved as the symbol of the nation. One fort controls the road to Jerusalem; can they be forced out? An attack from the rear might do it. Their soldiers attack the fort with flame throwers and dynamite. They are untrained but enthusiastic. An Arab chief provides information about another route to Jerusalem. Assigning more men to this project will shorten the schedule. The outflanked enemy not withdraws, opening the road to Jerusalem. Marcus knows how to clear a disabled truck from this road. They reach Jerusalem in time for the cease-fire. Marcus plans to return home. But a young soldier is scared in the night, the last casualty before peace is the result of a mistake.This movie is entertaining and educational in it story about the founding of Israel. Note how surplus Mauser rifles armed the Israeli forces. Surplus Messerschmidt ME-109s also provided an air force. Such irony is not unknown in history. You can search the Internet for more information on Colonel Marcus.",4,Their War for Independence,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,3112,"['Cast', 'Giant', 'Shadow', '1966', 'filmThe', 'story', 'newsreels', 'WW', 'II', 'set', 'background', 'Christmas', '1947', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'major', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'Two', 'men', 'are', 'being', 'followed', 'lawyers', 'approached', 'Major', 'Haganah', 'who', 'secret', 'mission', '[', 'Note', 'toy', 'machine', 'gun', 'young', 'boys', ']', 'Can', 'new', 'state', 'Israel', 'defend', 'Marcus', 'will', 'go', 'Israel', 'military', 'advisor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'desk', 'job', 'scene', 'past', 'where', 'Colonel', 'Marcus', 'flown', 'France', 'B-17', 'bombers', 'fly', 'paratroopers', '101', 'Airborne', 'France', 'French', 'cheer', 'liberators', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'water', 'Marcus', 'Palestine', 'greeted', 'Shalom', 'armored', 'bus', 'attacked', 'armed', 'men', 'death', 'penalty', 'possessing', 'firearm', '[', 'was', 'Occupied', 'France', ']', 'British', 'are', 'leaving', 'Arabs', 'are', 'arming', 'themselves.The', 'Arab', 'leaders', 'hate', 'other', 'troops', 'are', ""n't"", 'highly', 'motivated', 'ship', 'immigrants', 'are', 'illegal', 'Can', 'be', 'stopped', 'Will', 'changing', 'clothes', 'disguise', 'Such', 'stubborn', 'people', 'scene', 'concentration', 'camp', 'tastefully', 'handled', 'Arab', 'chief', 'entertainment', 'meeting', 'humor', 'serious', 'political', 'discussion', 'abut', 'arms', 'Syria', 'Will', 'act', 'destroy', 'arms', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'casualties', 'Can', 'get', 'arms', 'Can', 'unify', 'separate', 'groups', 'act', 'unison', 'convoy', 'trucks', 'road', 'fire', 'Come', 'Magda', 'arrive', 'Jerusalem', 'Marcus', 'wife', 'illness', 'back', 'home', 'returns', ""'m"", 'only', 'guessing', 'British', 'diplomat', 'talks', 'Marcus', 'Middle', 'East', 'Marcus', 'situation', 'Lt.', 'General', 'need', 'arms', 'self-defense.A', 'South', 'American', 'cargo', 'plane', 'flies', 'Mauser', 'rifles', 'surplus', 'arms', 'WW', 'II', 'Can', 'Israel', 'survive', 'attacks', 'Arab', 'countries', 'Marcus', 'use', 'strategy', 'attacking', 'improvised', 'weapons', 'Can', 'Piper', 'Cub', 'attack', 'tanks', 'Audacity', 'Will', 'tanks', 'be', 'led', 'ambush', 'Arab', 'Legion', 'moved', 'cut', 'road', 'Jerusalem', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'starving', 'Jerusalem', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Nebuchadnezzer', 'Titus', 'Rome', 'must', 'be', 'saved', 'symbol', 'nation', 'One', 'fort', 'road', 'Jerusalem', 'can', 'be', 'forced', 'out', 'attack', 'rear', 'might', 'do', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'fort', 'flame', 'throwers', 'dynamite', 'are', 'untrained', 'enthusiastic', 'Arab', 'chief', 'information', 'route', 'Jerusalem', 'Assigning', 'more', 'men', 'project', 'will', 'shorten', 'schedule', 'outflanked', 'enemy', 'not', 'withdraws', 'opening', 'road', 'Jerusalem', 'Marcus', 'how', 'clear', 'disabled', 'truck', 'road', 'reach', 'Jerusalem', 'time', 'cease-fire', 'Marcus', 'return', 'home', 'young', 'soldier', 'scared', 'night', 'last', 'casualty', 'peace', 'result', 'mistake.This', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'story', 'founding', 'Israel', 'Note', 'how', 'surplus', 'Mauser', 'rifles', 'armed', 'Israeli', 'forces', 'Messerschmidt', 'ME-109s', 'also', 'provided', 'air', 'force', 'Such', 'irony', 'not', 'unknown', 'history', 'can', 'search', 'Internet', 'more', 'information', 'Colonel', 'Marcus']",N/A

547272,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00004CVUZ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","Kirk Douglas, John Wayne, Yul Brenner and Frank Sinatra. With star power like that, how can a movie lose? It's a good, but not a great, movie about the early days of the State of Israel.Mickey Marcus (Kirk Douglas) has just come home from World War II, and he's thinking about spending some quality time with his wife. But a secret agent for the underground Israeli forces contacts him and convinces him to come be their military adviser.Marcus and the General (they never tell us the name of Wayne's character) toured one of the concentration camps just after liberation at the end of the war, and both found it pretty hard to take. Marcus was assigned to help with getting the prisoners food and medical care, etc., and the General agreed to help him get what he needed, even if they had to steal the ambulances and blankets. So when Marcus goes to the General for permission to go to Israel, the General tells him not to do it, or if he's going to do it anyway, not to go in uniform or mention his rank in the U.S. Army. He's there strictly as a private citizen.Most of us know something about what the Israelis faced in those days. Before the British left, they were interfering with ships coming in bringing Jewish refugees from all over the world. They blockaded Israel from getting weapons or vehicles from the U.S. or elsewhere, but they were openly helping the Palestinian Arabs. Once they left, the Arabs took to shooting and bombing and making things miserable generally.I can't tell the whole story here, but one frustration I had was trying to guess who the various people were, when my own memory for history is so lousy. Like ""the General,"" the big shot (Secretary of State?) of the State of Israel is never mentioned by name, but from the wild white hair, maybe it's Ben Gurion. Anybody know enough Israeli history to tell me? I think Yul Brenner was playing Asher Lev.The movie is all about courage in the face of overwhelming odds, as well as ingenuity. At one point Frank Sinatra, playing an airplane pilot, bombs the Arabs with bottles of seltzer water. They make a weird whistling sound when they fall, and explode on impact. Not much damage, but a lot of noise to scare people.And there are love conflicts. Marcus' American wife doesn't want him to go, and gets pregnant just before he leaves. Then his translator and aid-de-camp is a beautiful Israeli woman who falls in love with him. When his wife suffers a miscarriage, he hurries home to Brooklyn, only to find that there's a big welcome home party going on, and his wife is out of the hospital and recovering well. She didn't write him about the miscarriage until after she was out of danger, and he's pissed that he came home unnecessarily.As I said, it's a good movie, but not a great one. Hard to follow at times, as if the screenplay assumes we know the history well enough not to need any helps like people's names. And perhaps just a little too much emphasis on how brave the Israelis were, and how callous, ignorant and cowardly the Arabs were. It gets only three stars, but still I think it's worth seeing.",3,Intense Israeli War Story,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,3092,"['Kirk', 'Douglas', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'star', 'power', 'how', 'can', 'movie', 'lose', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'early', 'days', 'State', 'Israel.Mickey', 'Marcus', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'just', 'come', 'home', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'thinking', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'wife', 'secret', 'agent', 'underground', 'Israeli', 'forces', 'convinces', 'come', 'be', 'military', 'adviser.Marcus', 'General', 'never', 'tell', 'name', 'Wayne', 'character', 'toured', 'one', 'concentration', 'camps', 'just', 'liberation', 'end', 'war', 'found', 'pretty', 'hard', 'take', 'Marcus', 'was', 'assigned', 'help', 'getting', 'prisoners', 'food', 'medical', 'care', 'etc.', 'General', 'agreed', 'help', 'get', 'what', 'needed', 'even', 'had', 'steal', 'ambulances', 'blankets', 'So', 'when', 'Marcus', 'General', 'permission', 'go', 'Israel', 'General', 'not', 'do', 'going', 'do', 'anyway', 'not', 'go', 'uniform', 'mention', 'rank', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'there', 'strictly', 'private', 'citizen.Most', 'know', 'something', 'what', 'Israelis', 'faced', 'days', 'British', 'left', 'were', 'interfering', 'ships', 'coming', 'bringing', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'world', 'blockaded', 'Israel', 'getting', 'weapons', 'vehicles', 'U.S.', 'elsewhere', 'were', 'openly', 'helping', 'Palestinian', 'Arabs', 'left', 'Arabs', 'took', 'shooting', 'bombing', 'making', 'things', 'miserable', 'generally.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'here', 'one', 'frustration', 'had', 'was', 'trying', 'guess', 'who', 'various', 'people', 'were', 'when', 'own', 'memory', 'history', 'so', 'lousy', 'General', 'big', 'shot', 'Secretary', 'State', 'State', 'Israel', 'never', 'mentioned', 'name', 'wild', 'white', 'hair', 'maybe', 'Ben', 'Gurion', 'Anybody', 'know', 'enough', 'Israeli', 'history', 'tell', 'think', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'was', 'playing', 'Asher', 'Lev.The', 'movie', 'courage', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'as', 'well', 'ingenuity', 'one', 'point', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'playing', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'Arabs', 'bottles', 'seltzer', 'water', 'make', 'weird', 'whistling', 'sound', 'when', 'fall', 'explode', 'impact', 'Not', 'much', 'damage', 'lot', 'noise', 'scare', 'people.And', 'are', 'love', 'conflicts', 'Marcus', 'American', 'wife', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'pregnant', 'just', 'Then', 'translator', 'aid-de-camp', 'beautiful', 'Israeli', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'When', 'wife', 'miscarriage', 'home', 'Brooklyn', 'only', 'find', 'big', 'welcome', 'home', 'party', 'going', 'wife', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'miscarriage', 'was', 'danger', 'pissed', 'came', 'home', 'unnecessarily.As', 'said', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'Hard', 'follow', 'times', 'screenplay', 'know', 'history', 'well', 'enough', 'not', 'need', 'helps', 'people', 'names', 'perhaps', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'how', 'brave', 'Israelis', 'were', 'how', 'callous', 'ignorant', 'cowardly', 'Arabs', 'were', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'still', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

I have not read Ted Berkman's biography of this great hero.  Still, I get the impression that the 1966 film tries to be faithful to the historical reality.  We even learn about Marcus' disloyalty to his marriage vows.  Was this necessary?  The scenes involving his wife (Angie Dickinson) and mistress (Senta Berger), however, admittedly do help us better understand him.Mickey Marcus was primarily a big picture military planner.  He sought opportunities to bravely put his life at risk---but working behind the scenes and organizing an effective military force was his real specialty.  The Jews of Palestine were often at odds with each other.  Marcus had to find a way to unite them to fight the common foe, the self pitying and bigoted Arabs. The appearances of John Wayne, Yul Brenner, and Frank Sinatra added to my enjoyment of the film.Cast a Giant Shadow was made thirty nine years ago.  It is the last major movie depicting Israel as a land of decency and honor.  Did Hollywood turn anti-Israel soon afterwards?  What is the chance it might be made today?  Less than zero?

Kirk Douglas plays a recently demobilized American military expert who returns home from WWII only to find he still has fighting and wanderlust in his blood.

I know, I know, naysayers may claim that Hollywood is run by Jews, etc, and that this is proof,  but I think it was fair in presenting all sides, Brits, Arabs, and Jews were not cartoonishly portrayed as heroes vs. villains, but it did raise some questions of the motivation of each, with some interesting portraits of human strengths and weaknesses in each. Told from the standpoint of the Jews, it was actually self-deprecating in a lot of spots, with jokes about their hard-headedness. Well, after all, this is history, and one can't argue with that, the end result really happened.

547285,A3Q5S5SAN4GF3B,B00004CVUZ,"Elizabeth A. Cohen ""future author""","[0, 0]","This movie has a star studded cast. Kirk Douglas in the starring role, Topol as an Arab Sheik, Yul Brenner as an Israeli Soldier, John Wayne as an unnamed General (but we all know it is Patton), and Frank Sinatra as Corporal Pasaic, a WWII pilot from New Jersey. There are others in this movie that were great but I don't have the room to type them all in.Kirk Douglas plays a WWII Colonel, in the now ended war. He was a lawyer attached to the Judge Advocates office and never saw action on the front. So, he cons his way onto a plane bound for France on D-day, Liberates Dachau Concentration camp, and gets chewed out by John Wayne. Meanwhile in Israel, they are trying to become an independent state, still bringing in victims from the camps, or better yet sneaking them in since the British would not let them in, and training them to fight the Arabs. They send an Israeli soldier (there were no ranks at that time), to convince Col. Marcus (Douglas) to come help them fight. At first he refuses, but in the end he goes.He wants to play soldier but all the leaders of Israel want is his knowledge on coordinating a military campaign. &#34;Frankly no one else wanted the job&#34; says Jacob Zion (Ben Gurion), played by Lou Adler.The movie shows Kirk going from a secular, I don't want to be a Jew to becoming a true Israeli General the first in 2000 years, Joshua being the first. He brought together the Irgun (an Israeli terrorist group, so called because they attacked the British), The Palmach, and the Haganah. Today we know them as the Israeli Defense Force. He became one of the first Heroes of the war for independence.Of all the WWII movies, this one stands out as one of the best. Kirk Douglas is great in this movie, he plays his part so well that he brings Col. Marcus alive. All these actors are a blend that can't be repeated. It shows the determination by men of character willing to put their lives on the line to help a nation of people who were being systematically slaughtered. Even showing the liberation of Dachau was done in a tasteful manner, if that can be possible considering what they found. The cameras on John Wayne's face said it all.It was a difficult time for the Jewish people then and there were not many countries who would stand by her, but the few that did gave them reason to fight, and Col. Marcus gave them the Army to do it with. It shows how even many Arabs wanted things to change and knew that the Jewish people would make the desert bloom and many fought with them and for them. Topol depicts such an Arab with humor, yet with strength.If you like history in movie form, then this one has plenty of that! It is realistic in that they use Hebrew where needed to bring in the realism. The bus turns into a sort of tank and so on. I don't want to spoil this for others, so I will stop here just saying: This is such a wonderful movie, shows the determination of a people struggling to find a place in this world where they could be safe. Shows a Colonel who is struggling with his own identity saying: &#34;I was angry since they circumcised me without my permission.&#34;Take time to watch this movie, you won't regret it.",5,The birth of a nation,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3169,"['movie', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'starring', 'role', 'Topol', 'Arab', 'Sheik', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'Israeli', 'Soldier', 'John', 'Wayne', 'unnamed', 'General', 'know', 'Patton', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Corporal', 'Pasaic', 'WWII', 'pilot', 'New', 'Jersey', 'are', 'others', 'movie', 'were', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'type', 'in.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'WWII', 'Colonel', 'now', 'ended', 'war', 'was', 'lawyer', 'attached', 'Judge', 'Advocates', 'office', 'never', 'saw', 'action', 'front', 'So', 'way', 'plane', 'bound', 'France', 'D-day', 'Liberates', 'Dachau', 'Concentration', 'camp', 'chewed', 'out', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Meanwhile', 'Israel', 'are', 'trying', 'become', 'independent', 'state', 'still', 'bringing', 'victims', 'camps', 'better', 'yet', 'sneaking', 'British', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'training', 'fight', 'Arabs', 'send', 'Israeli', 'soldier', 'were', 'ranks', 'time', 'convince', 'Col.', 'Marcus', 'Douglas', 'come', 'help', 'fight', 'first', 'end', 'play', 'soldier', 'leaders', 'Israel', 'want', 'knowledge', 'coordinating', 'military', 'campaign', '34', 'Frankly', 'one', 'else', 'wanted', 'job', '34', 'Jacob', 'Zion', 'Ben', 'Gurion', 'played', 'Lou', 'Adler.The', 'movie', 'Kirk', 'going', 'secular', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Jew', 'becoming', 'true', 'Israeli', 'General', 'first', '2000', 'years', 'Joshua', 'being', 'first', 'brought', 'together', 'Irgun', 'Israeli', 'terrorist', 'group', 'so', 'called', 'attacked', 'British', 'Palmach', 'Haganah', 'Today', 'know', 'Israeli', 'Defense', 'Force', 'became', 'one', 'first', 'Heroes', 'war', 'independence.Of', 'WWII', 'movies', 'one', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'great', 'movie', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'Col.', 'Marcus', 'alive', 'actors', 'are', 'blend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'repeated', 'determination', 'men', 'character', 'willing', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'help', 'nation', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'being', 'systematically', 'slaughtered', 'Even', 'showing', 'liberation', 'Dachau', 'was', 'done', 'tasteful', 'manner', 'can', 'be', 'possible', 'considering', 'what', 'found', 'cameras', 'John', 'Wayne', 'face', 'said', 'all.It', 'was', 'difficult', 'time', 'Jewish', 'people', 'then', 'there', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'countries', 'who', 'would', 'stand', 'few', 'did', 'gave', 'reason', 'fight', 'Col.', 'Marcus', 'gave', 'Army', 'do', 'how', 'even', 'many', 'Arabs', 'wanted', 'things', 'change', 'knew', 'Jewish', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'desert', 'bloom', 'many', 'fought', 'Topol', 'depicts', 'such', 'Arab', 'humor', 'yet', 'strength.If', 'history', 'movie', 'form', 'then', 'one', 'plenty', 'realistic', 'use', 'Hebrew', 'where', 'needed', 'bring', 'realism', 'bus', 'sort', 'tank', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'others', 'will', 'stop', 'here', 'just', 'saying', 'such', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'determination', 'people', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'safe', 'Colonel', 'who', 'struggling', 'own', 'identity', 'saying', '34', 'was', 'angry', 'circumcised', 'permission.', '34', 'Take', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

I was especially interested in seeing it because the hero of the film, Mickey Marcus, supposedly attended the same Synogogue  in Brooklyn.that I did.  It was a good film that sadly was not very successful.  Not long afterward I read a book entitled &#34;How to Make a Jewish Movie&#34; written by the producer of the film, Melville Shavelson.  I was surprised to learn that the movie would have never been make without the help of the Duke himself, the great John Wayne.Apparently, no one wanted to finance this film because of the fear of a boycott in the Arab world.  They needed a star who was capable of bringing big box office and at the time there was no one bigger than the Duke.  So Shavelson contacted Wayne with whom he made a film before and sent him a script which Wayne loved.  He felt that the film made a statement about America having an American army officer, Marcus, sacrifice everything to become the first General of Israel.  However Wayne felt that no one would believe him playing a Jew from Brooklyn, so he called Kirk Douglas (with whom he had made two other films,) in the middle of the night and sent him the script.  Douglas did the film and Wayne's son Michael signed on as Executive Producer and the film was a Batjac (Wayne's company,) production.  (This story is mentioned briefly in the excellent new biography of the Duke.)  Wayne also did a cameo as an American General who is friends with Marcus.  There is an excellent scene involving a close-up of Wayne's eyes when they discover the concentration camps: a great star and a fine actor.)Anyway, Kirk Douglas does his usual enthusiastic job as Marcus and Senta Berger, than at the height of her popularity, plays the Israeli freedom fighter with whom Douglas falls in love.  (I'm really not sure that this ever really happened.)  The lovely Angie Dickinson plays Marcus' wife, Emma, home pining away for him in Brooklyn while he serves the new country of Israel (and romances Berger.)  Other than Wayne, there is an amusing cameo from Frank Sinatra as a freelance pilot helping the Israelis.  Yul Brynner also appears as another Israeli officer.  Hes listed as a guest star like Wayne and Sinatra, however it is a major role.Anyway, this is an excellent film.  The ending is ironic and hard to believe, but true.  And despite the appearance of John Wayne, the film still did not do particularly well.

The characters of Marcus played by Douglas and Asher played by Yul Brynner may indeed be typical of the heroes  Hollywood war movies, but the background battle scenes, and life of Pre-state and early re-established Israel, the stirring Hebrew songs and Israeli dances, the battle scenes of the War of Independence are truly authentic filmed in Israel in the 1960s. And we get a sharp idea of how the out-gunned and out manned Israeli forces (drawn form the survivors of the Holocaust) won against such incredibly overwhelming odds.The heroism is there, the desperation and Israeli chutzpah is there.

Melville Shavelson wrote and directed this sprawling biographical action picture about (Colonel) &quot;Mickey&quot; Marcus (Kirk Douglas), a West Point graduate and an adviser to President Roosevelt during W.W.II, who, at the request of the Israelis, went to there in the late 40s to re-organize their army. In this account, based on a book by Ted Berkman, Mickey Marcus is the master strategist who leads the Israelis to victory in the war with the Arabs. Melville Shavelson admires him, making him the cool but enigmatic leader. Shavelson is very eager to please the audience enough to throw in numerous guest stars, such as Frank Sinatra and Yul Brynner, and agonizes over Mickey's moral conflict between Angie Dickinson, the wife he leaves at home in the U.S., and Senta Berger, the female warrior he takes up with.

547299,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00004CVUZ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","I was very eager to finally discover this 1966 war film and I expected a lot - but albeit watchable it proved to be disappointing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1. The real story.David Daniel ""Mickey"" Marcus was a United States Army colonel, veteran of World War II, who also served in Israeli army (Haganah) during the 1947-49 Israeli War of Independace. As a trusted and precious military advisor to David Ben Gurion he ultimately was promoted to the rank of general (Aluf) - and, as other Israeli high officers didn't have official ranks in this time, he became de facto the first general in modern Israeli history...Although initially confined to advisory and staff duties (he organised the first modern command and control structure for Haganah) Marcus ultimately took also command of some important military operations, like the two summer 1948 attempts against Latrun fortress held by the elite Arab Legion from Jordan Army, commanded by British officers (both times the Israelis were defeated). His greatest contribution was however the supervision of the construction in a record time of a mountainous road (nicknamed ""Burma Road"") which allowed to go around the lines of Arab siege and resupply the hardly pressed Jewish fighters defending Jerusalem.Marcus is still well remembered today in Israel and many streets in Israeli towns are named after him - as is at least one kibbutz.2. The film.The cast of this film is simply STELLAR! Kirk Douglas was certainly a great choice for this role - he was in this time a great star, he was of right age and of course he is Jewish himself. Also, even if both real Marcus and Kirk Douglas were already born in USA, their parents were dirt-poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe... Angie Dickinson plays his American wife Emma and Austrian actress Senta Berger plays his local love interest Magda. Yul Brynner, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra and Topol appear also in supporting roles.The director however made a really POOR use of this huge legion of stars. Kirk Douglas was asked to act as if all this story was a kind of joke. He is all the time cheerful, wise-cracking and in fact he seems to amuse and enjoy himself mightily, never taking anything too seriously - there is hardly any moment in this film that reminds us that for the Israelis this war was about sheer survival as nation, because if they were defeated the Israelis would be physically removed from the Holy Land, either by extermination or by massif, merciless ethnical cleansing...I am not exactly certain if Marcus adulterous relation with Magda is a historical fact, but it certainly takes a large place in this film. Honestly I think that even if it was true, this relation takes way TOO MUCH screen time and if it was not a real thing then I honestly can't imagine why the heck the director included it.Most of the great actors named above are also heavily underused. John Wayne makes just a cameo - a nice one, even if it short. Yul Brynner has hardly any screen time and he is hardly ever shown doing or saying something interesting - when in the same time supposedly playing the commander of the elite Palmach military unit! Angie Dickinson also appears little, but there is at least a good explanation for that, as she remained in USA when her unfaithful husband went to war in Holy Land. But the worst thing happens to Frank Sinatra, who plays an American volunteer pilot fighting on Israeli side - he is simply a clown and the one military operation he performs is shown with a deliberately burlesque comedy accents, something which I HATED! Finally, Topol, who plays an Arab sheik (the only Arab we really get to know in this film), portrays his character as a total caricature, featuring every Arab clich&eacute; in the book and inventing some new ones...That brings me actually again to the issue of lack of seriousness. This was a great, important and tragic war and many fell on both sides before it was over - and in fact it was NEVER over, because this same war still rages on, even today. Israelis still face the threat of extermination (the only nation on Earth to live under such a dark shadow) and Arabs still mourn their lost territories and refuse to accept this loss...

547311,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B00004CVUZ,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[7, 27]","The problem with a film like this today is that it will evoke passionate responses from both Arabs and Jews. I think a non-semetic person is needed to provide an honest assessment. As an American I have no great feelings for either Isreal or the varied Arab States. I think both sides have little to recommend them even to this day. This film portrays the creation of the modern Isreali army from a bunch of feuding militias. Kirk Douglas plays his usual out-spoken leader part which comes over ok. John Wayne as a WW2 general and State Department official is almost amusing, but does convey how the US government probably felt toward events in the Middle East at this time.I was surprised at the reasonable portrayal of the British in this film, as they are usually vilified by pro-Isreali elments most times. It shows how the British vainly tried to keep both sides apart, and explains a little of their own position for a change. It was a thankless task for them. The almost saintly portrayal of the Isrealis does give one the impression that this film was funded by the Jewish Defense League in the US! They are always seen as long suffering as they prod along singing and dancing to their dour and flat music! The Arabs don't get much better treatment either, and little individual attention at all, excepet for one dissident chieftain who seems to throw his lot in with the Jews. His portrayal is a bit standard, but is amusing and not that inaccurate for the time.What the movie does show well is the chaotic nature of the fighting in 1948 with the first Arab-Isreali War. We see Jewish columes being attacked from the mountains and bloody sacrefices being made. The Arab forces are shown a bit better armed than I think they actually were, but there can be no doubt that they had some initial advantages against the nascent state of Isreal which they threw away. 1947-48 was the only chance the Arab World would get to crush Isreal, and they have only themselves to blame for not doing it. The Isrealis once again proved the superiority of Western forces against Eastern ones. Even with the chaotic nature of the fighting, and their poor strategic situation, they were able to hang on and prevail through sheer grit and determination. Kirk Douglas represents the many mercinaries and outside supporters who were vital in giving the Isrealis the technical expertise, help and leadership that they so badly needed. Without them Isreal no doubt would have been crushed.This movie is a bit sentimental and heavy-handed at times, but it probably conveys a general impression of the times better than any Hollywood production could today. Frank Sinitra flying around in his little plane has got to be funniest thing in this entire opus! Yul Brenner is pretty good also as a downcast Isreali leader. The women in the movie are probably the most compelling aspect. Kirk Douglas's wife and the Isreali girl are both lovely and compelling. Their pull on him has symbolic meaning in the story. There is some good dialouge in this movie, some of it with decent historical references. Viewers should try not to get too involved with the plot and characters, and just try to see it as a grand rolling epic with some scant relation to history! I guess it would help if you are not pro-Isreali or Arab as well. Just sit back, have a few chuckles and gain an appreciation for the complexity of the events which are conveyed in this epic. You can at least begin to understand the current mess in the Middle East today by viewing it.

547314,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B00004CVUZ,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[0, 0]","Cast a Giant Shadow, starring Kirk Douglas as David ""Mickey"" Marcus, a major force for Israeli independence during its formative years in 1948.The film for me played like a documentary, complete with stock footage and some marching military music, and followed along a fairly straight path of what the real Marcus did and saw.The various plot points are pretty predictable and solid -- Marcus' wife, played by a subdued Angie Dickenson (ah, Police Woman!) sleepwalked through this part.  When she loses her baby and Marcus shouts, ""The baby was mine, too!"", she takes it all in blandly, and sniffs a bit.  Dang!The story tries to create tension with another woman, the activist Magda, played by Austrian actress Senta Berger.  Senta's character is sexy, brave, and man, what a kisser!  I've not seen her in too many films since, being mostly in the German film industry (per our favorite resource, ""Wiki!"").The all-star cast is wasted.  Yul Brynner plays one of the Israeli commanders who plays it cool and loose.  Marcus calls him and his ragtag army a ""bunch of losers"" and says ""attack, attack!""  The idea of bluffing the enemy is a good one, but Brynner's character is a bit bland.Another performance that is unintentionally funny is John Wayne as Marcus' commanding officer, who encourages him to go back to Israel to fight the good fight.  Their banter back and forth adds some humor to an otherwise mild script.Battle scenes are actually quite good.  One reviewer said they were ""sanitized""  but I disagree.  The extras playing the soldiers and the common people however were at times a bit bland as well, like something out of a 1940s Life magazine rather than a ragtag force of desperate men and women.  Not enough emotion for me.The reason I'm so critical is because I've seen John Wayne, Yul Brynner, and a small performance by Frank Sinatra in films where they really shone, where their brilliance came across in their characters.  I did not see that here.Marcus' story comes to an end and is a fair reenactment of what happened in real life.  Sad, and we never really see the results in the USA of Marcus' activity.Bottom Line:Although Kirk Douglas does shine in several scenes, the domestic scenes are disappointing, the battle scenes are terrific in parts and the concept of duty, honor, and yes even cowardice in battle are mildly shown.

There is a love triangle thrown in for good measure, as Marcus falls for a beautiful Israeli woman Magda Simon (Austrian actress Senta Berger).The battle scenes are a notch above what one would expect.  The military tactics on display by the Israelis are believable, as they are terribly outnumbered by their foes, and they have little in the way of modern weapons.

The cinematography cannot be beaten, the film is shot in the dirty kibbutzim, Jerusalem hills and Negev desert.  Although the battles are stylized and the Egyptian tanks are not accurate, the film maintains many accurate aspects.  It truthfully shows the non-support given by the U.S to nascent Israel.  It also gives many accurate details regarding the Egyptian advance, the battles for Jerusalem, the Burma road and the ALA. It fairly depicts the arab irregulars, and in this many are wrong, the depiction of Israeli organization and Arab disorganization is fairly portrayed.  The Israelis are shown to be full of bravado, lacking many military skills, but with much efficiency and zeal while the Arabs are truthfully shown to be made up of a variety of competing interests, including irregulars, sheikhs and regular troops.Many small details are accurate and fair.  The cast is brilliant, including Kirk Douglas, Frank Sinatra(in a bit part) and John Wayne.  The Hebrew is simple and helpful for the begginer.

Backed by an impressive supporting-cast that includes John Wayne, Yul Brynner, and Frank Sinatra, this is the Hollywoood version of Col. Marcus' great adventure in the Holy Land. Sadly, Col. Marcus died in a rather unfortunate and avoidable incident of friendly-fire, and did not get to witness the final triumph of the army he helped build.In the years between the end of World War II, and the founding of the great state of Israel in May of 1948, vast groups of Jewish refugees and immigrants converged on the Holy Land.Even after the atrocities of the Holocaust were made public, there was still a significant level of blatant anti-Semitic hostility toward the survivors. This was particularly virulent in the Soviet Union and its new satelite dominions. In fact, a large number of Jewish people were forcibly expelled from the communist half of Europe. When Israel became a fact, rather than a concept, entire populations of Jews were expelled from predominantly islamic ""nations"", from Iran to Morocco.The ""United"" Nations, in its typical impotence, debated endlessly. As usual, after all was said and done, ...more was SAID than DONE.The brave Isralis were making their preparations to re-establish a state in their ancient homeland. The U.N. made sure that an arms embargo severely limited any shipments to what was to become Israel. Meanwhile, Britain, and other nations, were openly selling vast hoardes of modern military-surplus armaments of all types (artillery, armored vehicles, aircraft, small-arms, and all the necessary ammunition), ...to the surrounding arab ""states"".The entire world watched, ...and expected Israel to by ruthlessly crushed within hours of its founding.Colonel Marcus, and other noble souls from the West, arrived in Israel to assist in whatever manner they could. The Israeli army was a polyglot  force composed of not only indigenous Jews, but great swaths of European Jews, most of them arriving with little more than the clothes they wore. No one spoke the same language! They had some combat-veterans amongst them, but most of the volunteers were untrained, ...many of them Holocaust survivors. What arms they possessed, were frequently of dubious quality, often improvised, or of a highly random sampling of whatever weaponry they could buy or capture.As soon as Israel was recognized as a new nation, six islamic armies invaded. Enormously out-numbered and out-gunned, the Israelis pulled off a miracle! Why? They had MORE GUTS than the enemy. The world watched and learned,  ...that its not the SIZE of the dog, its the SIZE of the FIGHT in the dog!Now, 63 years later, Israel is STILL there. A thriving island of freedom amidst a stagnant Middle-eastern morass. Many attempts at invasion were made by Israel's hostile neghbors in those years.
