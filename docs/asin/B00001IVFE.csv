There are no graphic sex scenes and only shadowed nudity using a body double.  The only reason I can think of as to why it was  controversial is because the novel to which it was based was controversial.  This film is one of the best films of the decade, blending scathing humor  with a great story.  It is a very sad film, but one worth seeing.  In case  you have no clue as to what it's about, the storyline goes like this: As a  young boy (at age 14), Humbert Humbert fell deeply in love with a girl,  also aged 14.  He considered her to be perfect in every way.  But their  relationship is cut short when she dies.  So, even in his adulthood, he  searches for someone exactly like her.One of the best films of all time taken  straight from one of the best novels of all time.

510710,A39ULQ3KTNM8NV,B00001IVFE,"""aelwen""","[99, 100]","There is a moment in Adrian Lyne's LOLITA that effectively captures the twisted, yet surprisingly innocent feeling that Vladimir Nabokov wanted to portray with his novel. When Lolita, wonderfully played by newcomer Dominique Swain, is rushing up the stairs to say goodbye to Humbert Humbert  (Jeremy Irons), before she leaves for summer camp, you realize that the  look of excitement in Jeremy Irons face, and the nervous posture he has is  that of an innocent child in love.Indeed it is true that Humbert is a  child at heart, a fact which becomes clear early in the movie, when we  learn a little bit about Humbert's first encounter with love and its  subsequent painful and unexpected loss.It seems impossible to not  compare Lyne's version with Stanley Kubrick's version, made over 35 years  ago. I have to admit that I am an avid Kubrick fan, and that I always  thought his version of Nabokov's novel, if not faithfully reproduced, was a  classic. So it was that with apprehension (and some morbid curiosity) I  decided to watch Lyne's version. Boy was I blown away.It is a terrible  thing that our society as a whole, at this day and age, can't see pass the  taboo that apparently clogs the story. It is sad because Lyne's LOLITA is  an excellent and beautiful film in every respect. From Lyne's carefully  crafted visual style, to the outstanding performance given by both Swain  but especially by Irons (this is his movie), to the heart-breaking music  score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. Everything is in place  here.It is clear that Lyne has a profound understanding of the novel, he  successfully directs the story in a way the slowly engulfs you and never  seems to fall into the traps that plagued Kubrick's version. There are a  great many things that you will discover in this movie, not the least of  which is the realization that, deep down inside, there is a place in each  and everyone of us where love seems to have no age. In the end you  understand the reasons behind the story, you will see Humbert's joy  reflected in your eyes and his tears will fall down your face, but perhaps  most shocking of all, you will feel like him.Please, do yourself a favor  and see this movie on DVD. Trimark has done an excellent job by including a  very insightful commentary track by Adrian Lyne, a wealth of deleted scenes  (some of which I wish were on the film), theatrical trailers, and perhaps  the most wonderful feature of all, a casting session with Jeremy Irons and  Dominique Swain, where you see them rehearse a scene, and later get to see  the final scene.

510711,A2TLEB18074L4S,B00001IVFE,Alexander Leach,"[10, 15]","Strongly recommended.  I began last evening intending to watch one of the 20 (!) DVDs in my 'to view' pile, everything from Vertigo to The Luzhin Defence.  I picked out Grosse Pointe Blank which I had bought on a friend's recommendation.  Needless to say I loathed it and ejected the DVD after half an hour and put Lolita on instead.This beautifully shot film really kept me involved for its 2+ hours running time.  The performances are superb: Jeremy Irons is outstanding as always, but it is Dominique Swain's portrayal of Lolita which is really astonishing, considering that this was her first film role.The script is a very close adaptation of Nabokov's book (unlike Kubrick's version).  The story of a man's obsession with his stepdaughter is powerful and ultimately tragic, with the final scene almost unbearably poignant.  Meg Ryan and Frank Langella have smallish roles which are well handled, but it's Irons and Swain who are on screen for 95% of the time.Adrian Lyne's direction is wonderful, subtle and highly cinematic.  He also demonstrates that it is possible to infuse a film with an erotic charge (and this film is erotic on occasions) without resorting to excessive nudity.The DVD is excellent, with a very fine 1.85:1 anamorphic image.  There are a few flecks during the opening credits, but after that the transfer is virtually flawless.  It is not a spectacular transfer (like JFK for example), but the beautiful photography comes across marvellously: 8 or 9 out of 10.  The orthodox but seductive orchestral score by Morricone comes over very well on the soundtrack.The extensive extras include a very interesting excerpt (shot on videotape) of a couple of scenes in rehearsal with Irons and Swain: fascinating to see how this ends up in the film itself, as the scene is shown again just after the rehearsal clip.",4,Stunning adaptation.,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1834,"['Strongly', 'recommended', 'began', 'last', 'evening', 'intending', 'watch', 'one', '20', 'DVDs', ""'to"", 'view', 'pile', 'everything', 'Vertigo', 'Luzhin', 'Defence', 'picked', 'out', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'had', 'bought', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'Needless', 'say', 'loathed', 'ejected', 'DVD', 'hour', 'put', 'Lolita', 'instead.This', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'really', 'kept', 'involved', '2+', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'outstanding', 'always', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'portrayal', 'Lolita', 'really', 'astonishing', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'role.The', 'script', 'very', 'close', 'adaptation', 'Nabokov', 'book', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'story', 'man', 'obsession', 'stepdaughter', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'final', 'scene', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'poignant', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'have', 'smallish', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'Irons', 'Swain', 'who', 'are', 'screen', '95', '%', 'time.Adrian', 'Lyne', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'subtle', 'highly', 'cinematic', 'also', 'possible', 'infuse', 'film', 'erotic', 'charge', 'film', 'erotic', 'occasions', 'resorting', 'excessive', 'nudity.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'very', 'fine', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'image', 'are', 'few', 'flecks', 'opening', 'credits', 'transfer', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'not', 'spectacular', 'transfer', 'JFK', 'example', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'marvellously', '8', '9', '10', 'orthodox', 'seductive', 'orchestral', 'score', 'Morricone', 'over', 'very', 'well', 'soundtrack.The', 'extensive', 'extras', 'include', 'very', 'interesting', 'excerpt', 'shot', 'videotape', 'couple', 'scenes', 'rehearsal', 'Irons', 'Swain', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'up', 'film', 'scene', 'shown', 'again', 'just', 'rehearsal', 'clip']",N/A

It's when we get to the plot that things don't work as well.The reason I believe for the toning down of sexual activity in the film by the Director was not because of the worry about controversy, since his previous works were much heavier than this; it was the censors and lawyers themselves who kept a vigilant eye on the film during the editing and filming stages that dropped the plot down a notch.The basic story of Lolita is still present but in a more compact package. Dominique Swain, to me, is the perfect Lolita as is Jeremy Irons as Humbert. The supporting cast fit well, too.

Jeremy Irons is perfectly  cast as Humbert. His superb portrayals of obsession include: Damage, Dead  Ringers, M. Butterfly, Swann in Love, and Betrayal, so it is not surprising  that he is so convincing as Humbert.  What is astounding is the chemistry  between Irons and Dominique Swain as Lolita.  Swain who had no previous  acting experience simply either cues off Irons or puts her own natural  instincts as a fourteen year old in Director Lyne's hands and delivers not  only a stunning nymphet portrayal, but its destructive effect upon her  life.In the novel Humbert maintained he, &quot;...had the utmost respect  for ordinary children with their purity and vulnerability....But how his  heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon  child...maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many time  older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic  (that is demoniac)&quot;. It is this delusional obsession of his that traps  Lolita.

510719,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B00001IVFE,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[66, 77]","Beginning with one of the most famous opening lines in literary history (""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta."") we are introduced once more to the inimitable Humbert Humbert and his elusive quest for the Holy Grail in the form of ""nymphness"" personified. And oh what a sordid sorry trek it is, taking him and his young orphaned charge to some of the seamier spots of a fifties era American landscape. To cheap hotel rooms in little podunk towns where he can for a few fleeting days share a bit of privacy with his nubile naiad. Then of course, we follow the happy pair to the final confrontaion with one Clare Quilty, the only character in cinema/literary history who could make a pedophile like Humbert Humbert look wholesome by comparison.Remakes of movies always draw varying responses. Many critics and viewers were reluctant to favor this 1997 Adriane Lyne/Stephen Schiff/Jeremy Irons remake to the Kubrick/Nabokov/James Mason 1962 original. It's hard to argue when a novelist of the stature of Nabokov had such a direct hand in writing the screenplay (Kubrick was an uncredited co-author). Surely the work's creator would be better able to realize his vision cinematically? Yet, I believe the later film actually does a much better job in capturing the essence ot the novel.It boils down to casting. Shelley Winters was probably more right for the role of Lolita's Mom, Charlotte Haze, than was Melanie Griffith (almost universally described as the weakest link in the remake). That role aside, however, I think that every casting choice in the '92 version was spot-on. Irons, though he doesn't conjure up the physical characteristics of the Humbert that comes across in the novel, nevertheless did a better job than Mason in conveying Humbert's rakish libertinism. I'm so glad Dustin Hoffman, originally considered for the role, didn't land the part. This is amongst Irons' strongest performances. Dominique Swain, chosen over thousands of hopefuls who tried out for the part of Lolita, is the embodiment of all things young and lovely. I thought she also did a much better job than Sue Lyons at capturing the childish petulence that underlies most of the 12-year-old Lol's actions and reactions. She's just more believable, thanks in large part to Lyne's expert direction. Frank Langella was also much more convincing as Clare Quilty, a truly despicable fictional character, if there ever was one. Peter Sellers, due to his indelible comedic cinema persona, just could not come across as all that menacing on screen. He did, in fact, play the character for laughs, so the final confrontation came off more as farce and lost its effect.Finally, while Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in cinema history, he may have not been best suited for this particular novel. Plus, the era he was working in was much less conducive to a fully realized treatment of such touchy subject matter. He'd hit his comedic stride two years later, with Dr. Stragelove. Lyne had a bit more artistic leeway, although the history of the film's distribution was still rather bumpy, to say the least.Lyne has now come up with two of my favorite relatively recent films, this and the 1990 Horror film, Jacob's Ladder. He's another in what's become a rather large batch of excellent contemporary British directors. Please give this, his masterpiece thus far, a try.BEK",5,Outdoes Kubrick,1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,3389,"['Beginning', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'opening', 'lines', 'literary', 'history', 'Lolita', 'light', 'life', 'fire', 'loins', 'sin', 'soul', 'Lo-lee-ta', 'are', 'introduced', 'once', 'more', 'inimitable', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'elusive', 'quest', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'form', 'nymphness', 'personified', 'what', 'sordid', 'sorry', 'trek', 'taking', 'young', 'orphaned', 'charge', 'seamier', 'spots', 'fifties', 'era', 'American', 'landscape', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'little', 'podunk', 'towns', 'where', 'can', 'few', 'fleeting', 'days', 'share', 'bit', 'privacy', 'nubile', 'naiad', 'Then', 'course', 'follow', 'happy', 'pair', 'final', 'confrontaion', 'one', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'only', 'character', 'cinema/literary', 'history', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'pedophile', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'look', 'wholesome', 'comparison.Remakes', 'movies', 'always', 'draw', 'varying', 'responses', 'Many', 'critics', 'viewers', 'were', 'reluctant', 'favor', '1997', 'Adriane', 'Lyne/Stephen', 'Schiff/Jeremy', 'Irons', 'remake', 'Kubrick/Nabokov/James', 'Mason', '1962', 'original', 'hard', 'argue', 'when', 'novelist', 'stature', 'Nabokov', 'had', 'direct', 'hand', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'uncredited', 'co-author', 'Surely', 'work', 'creator', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'able', 'realize', 'vision', 'cinematically', 'Yet', 'believe', 'later', 'film', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'ot', 'novel.It', 'down', 'casting', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'right', 'role', 'Lolita', 'Mom', 'Charlotte', 'Haze', 'was', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'almost', 'universally', 'described', 'weakest', 'link', 'remake', 'role', 'aside', 'however', 'think', 'casting', 'choice', ""'92"", 'version', 'was', 'spot-on', 'Irons', ""n't"", 'conjure', 'up', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'Humbert', 'novel', 'nevertheless', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Mason', 'conveying', 'Humbert', 'rakish', 'libertinism', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'originally', 'considered', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'land', 'part', 'amongst', 'Irons', 'strongest', 'performances', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'chosen', 'thousands', 'hopefuls', 'who', 'tried', 'out', 'part', 'Lolita', 'embodiment', 'things', 'young', 'lovely', 'thought', 'also', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'capturing', 'childish', 'petulence', 'most', '12-year-old', 'Lol', 'actions', 'reactions', 'just', 'more', 'believable', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Lyne', 'expert', 'direction', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'truly', 'despicable', 'fictional', 'character', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'due', 'indelible', 'comedic', 'cinema', 'persona', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'menacing', 'screen', 'did', 'fact', 'play', 'character', 'laughs', 'final', 'confrontation', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'farce', 'lost', 'effect.Finally', 'Kubrick', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'cinema', 'history', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'best', 'suited', 'particular', 'novel', 'era', 'was', 'working', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'conducive', 'fully', 'realized', 'treatment', 'such', 'touchy', 'subject', 'matter', ""'d"", 'hit', 'comedic', 'stride', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Dr.', 'Stragelove', 'Lyne', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'artistic', 'leeway', 'history', 'film', 'distribution', 'was', 'still', 'rather', 'bumpy', 'say', 'least.Lyne', 'now', 'come', 'up', 'two', 'favorite', 'relatively', 'recent', 'films', '1990', 'Horror', 'film', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'what', 'become', 'rather', 'large', 'batch', 'excellent', 'contemporary', 'British', 'directors', 'Please', 'give', 'masterpiece', 'thus', 'far', 'try.BEK']",N/A

510727,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00001IVFE,Dennis Littrell,"[18, 23]","The first thing amiss with Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"" is that Melanie Griffith is entirely wrong for the part of Charlotte Haze.  ""The Haze woman"" must be unattractive.  Shelly Winters in Kubrick's Lolita (1962) was perfect for the part because she was a woman who had lost her looks.  Charlotte must be unattractive as a contrast to Lo (and not just in Humbert's mind); furthermore the references to her as a ""fat cow"" and Humbert's disinclination to make love to her, do not play well if she's attractive.  Melanie Griffith is actually better looking than the young star, Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita.  Swain is pretty enough, however, and although not the great beauty that Sue Lyon (who played Lolita in the original) was, she does the coquettish muggings better than Sue Lyon did and she is allowed more latitude.  Humbert never even kissed Lolita in Kubrick's version!Nonetheless, the second thing wrong with this interpretation is Swain herself.  Although wonderfully directed, she is ironically too old to be Lolita.  She is hardly a nymphet.Jeremy Irons does a superior job of making us feel how sad and trapped Humbert is.  Frank Langella as the libertine Claire Quilty is excellent and wonderfully cast, but his role is limited.  Whereas Peter Sellers played several parts, including the school psychologist, Langella speaks in only two scenes, briefly at the Enchanted Huntress as a spats-wearing past-post Romeo, and then of course in the finale.Where the Lyne film is clearly superior is in the minutia of the late-forties world of highway America: the country and western stations on the radio, the &quot;Notices&quot; on the back doors of the motels, the movie magazines and comics, the jaw-breakers and the gum under the dashboard, the many mid-drift children's outfits that Swain wears, the vintage motel and gas station signs, etc., etc.  Lyne also does a number of nice visuals.  The price tag hanging from the dark glasses Humbert is trying on as he desperately tries to see through two windows inside the gas station to what Lolita is doing with whom on the other side of their station wagon is an example.  And then there is that symbolic single cow at the end in the field with Humbert and the station wagon, suggesting a reincarnated Charlotte Haze observing what has befallen Humbert.Unfortunately Lyne's attention wanders at times.  He has Humbert stare at Lolita in the important scene when he first spots her on the lawn much, much too long so that Charlotte could not help but notice his noticing.  And in the scene on the front porch, with the three of them together on the swing, Charlotte would have to be blind not to see the sex play between the two. And when Melanie quotes Humbert from his diary calling her ""that fat cow"" we can see by just looking at her that she is anything but.  And the scene with her on his lap while he is trying to read at his desk is totally ineffective since Melanie is quite fetching and most males would be happy to carry her off to bed.  Corny and tiresome were Lo's vanilla ice cream and milk mustaches.  And we could have been spared the obvious and trite &quot;symbolism&quot; of the bananas and lipstick as Lo rides in the car thinking of Quilty.But it is entirely right that Lyne makes the motel rooms sorted and cheap.  He shows a sign advertising ""Children under 14 free"" at one of Humbert's choice stopping places, slyly reminding the cognoscente that Nabokov's nymphet should be younger than Shakespeare's Juliet, who was thirteen.  (Given the puritanical nature of the American psyche, neither Lyne nor Kubrick was able to make a ""true to the book"" film.)  She becomes a prostitute, effectively speaking, as she negotiates with Humbert over coins for her favors.  When Humbert tries to grab her saved-up money for fear she will use it to escape him, she shouts indignantly, ""I EARNED that money!""The really terrible thing about Nabokov's tale that both directors got right is the unrelenting possessiveness of Humbert.  That was his undoing of course, and really shows the perverted nature of his love for her.  If he had really loved her, he would have stepped aside and let her live a normal life.  That's what fathers do.  That he loved her as a woman is not as much a tragedy as the jealousy and control.  Lolita makes this clear when as the pregnant ""Dolly,"" looking common and matronly in a cheap house with a working-class husband, she sees Humbert for the last time.  He begs her to go with him, but she tells him she would almost rather go back to Quilty.  Lyne adds a final wound by having Humbert ask her if she can ever forgive him for what he did to her, allowing Lolita to reply (addressing the dog) ""Molly, say good-bye to my Dad.""  ""Some Dad!"" is Lyne's message.This interpretation will be more agreeable to some since it reenforces the idea that teen sexuality is wrong.  As usual, we see that nobody cares about the girl.  The feminists know she has the sexual power, and they are jealous.  They want her off limits so that they have a better currency themselves.  This is the political position of the sexual wars, and Lyne has fallen into it.  I think we need a French Lolita, as done by somebody like the late Louis Malle.  I don't expect this for another hundred years, however.

Somebody should've waved some under spineless Humbert Humbert's nose to have him wake up and take control of his life.  Watching LOLITA is like watching a slow-motion train wreck, yet more frustrating, simply because the characters are totally unpleasant--and because the wreck is so easily avoidable.Jeremy Irons gives a wimpy sleaziness to the role of Humbert:  a revulsion akin to having some slimy creature crawling up your pants leg.  Only Humbert is crawling all over an adolescent girl, young Lolita Haze (Dominique Swain).  The obsession Humbert has for this immature, boorish teenager is revolting, and little Lolita--bless her vampy heart--responds by playing Humbert like a classical violin.  Accordingly, the viewer is forced to watch the dysfunctional development of a one-sided relationship, with the manipulative Lolita firmly in charge of an alleged grown man.Such a relationship is destined for heartbreak, tragedy, and doom, and in this respect LOLITA doesn't disappoint.  We see several lives shattered, including a most bizarre confrontation between Humbert and another jellyfish competing for Lolita's prurient desires, the chain-smoking Clare Quilty (Frank Langella).  I had to book a double session with my shrink after watching that ugly piece of cinema, and I'm still having recurring nightmares.Ultimately, LOLITA is the story of a man who fails dismally at being a man.

This movie is a closer adaptation of Nabokov's book than the Kubrick version.  One flaw of the Kubrick film was that it begins with the end and it gives away crucial plot points and takes away suspense.  In the Lyne version, the scene at the beginning takes place again near the end but this time, it reveals nothing.  Dominique Swain is excellent as the title character.  She looks and acts the part of the nymphet that Sue Lyons could have never have pulled off. Some have suggested that Miss Swain was too old to play a 12 year old child but Dolores Haze is not 12 for the whole book.  A good portion of the novel takes place after she is 12.  When they are on the road, she is 13.  When she is in the all girl's school, she is 14.  She is 17 at the end.  The movie is not without flaws however.  Some scenes of humor with Irons falls flat.  I found Melanie Griffith to be very annoying but then again Lolita's mother was suppose to be.  Thankfully she's only on screen for a short time.Lolita is shown eating bananas in the movie.  Besides the phallic references, the bananas were used because the inspiration for Lolita came when Nabokov read a newspaper article about the first monkey to paint a picture.  The scientist gave him the tools to draw and the first thing he drew was the bars of his cage.  I can't say that this version of Lolita is better than the Kubrick, they each contain what the other misses.  Kubrick's version contains the humor that Lyne's version is lacking and Lyne's version contains the sadness that Kubrick missed.  Including reading Lolita, I would recommend that the viewer get both films.  For Lolita, is both a satire and a sad story rolled into one.  The two films in a way compliment each other.",5,a great new adaptation of Lolita,995587200,"07 20, 2001",2001,1845,"['Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', '40ish', 'professor', 'who', 'love', 'disastrously', '12-year', 'old', 'nymphet', 'movie', 'closer', 'adaptation', 'Nabokov', 'book', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'One', 'flaw', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'was', 'end', 'away', 'crucial', 'plot', 'points', 'away', 'suspense', 'Lyne', 'version', 'scene', 'beginning', 'place', 'again', 'end', 'time', 'nothing', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'excellent', 'title', 'character', 'part', 'nymphet', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'have', 'suggested', 'Miss', 'Swain', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', '12', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'Dolores', 'Haze', 'not', '12', 'whole', 'book', 'good', 'portion', 'novel', 'place', '12', 'When', 'are', 'road', '13', 'When', 'girl', 'school', '14', '17', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'however', 'scenes', 'humor', 'Irons', 'flat', 'found', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'then', 'again', 'Lolita', 'mother', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'Thankfully', 'only', 'screen', 'short', 'time.Lolita', 'shown', 'eating', 'bananas', 'movie', 'phallic', 'references', 'bananas', 'were', 'used', 'inspiration', 'Lolita', 'came', 'when', 'Nabokov', 'read', 'newspaper', 'article', 'first', 'monkey', 'paint', 'picture', 'scientist', 'gave', 'tools', 'draw', 'first', 'thing', 'drew', 'was', 'bars', 'cage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'version', 'Lolita', 'better', 'Kubrick', 'contain', 'what', 'other', 'misses', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'humor', 'Lyne', 'version', 'lacking', 'Lyne', 'version', 'sadness', 'Kubrick', 'missed', 'Including', 'reading', 'Lolita', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'get', 'films', 'Lolita', 'satire', 'sad', 'story', 'rolled', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'way', 'compliment', 'other']",N/A
510730,AZR02UVFP8EQB,B00001IVFE,"E. Mathews ""Emat""","[0, 1]","First let me say I never read the book. I watched the film on YouTube, in about 14 parts, and part 1 was missing so I know nothing of Hubert's past. I do know that Jeremy Irons' acting is, as always, breathtaking (as is he, physically, in this film); he acts with his eyes and it's amazing to behold. He is such a fine actor that it's hard for us to even bring ourselves to be repulsed by his relations with his late wife's daughter.  He makes even that hot.  It's just a very sexy movie.  Now, having said that, the Lolita character is just downright annoying (and I think she is supposed to be), and a manipulative little tease...which she is supposed to be! But somehow the relationship is endearing.  A more talented actress (did Natalie Portman turn this down?) woudl have made it better.In a nutshell: Keep expectations reasonable, enjoy the Jeremy Irons eye candy factor and fine acting, and bear with it when it descends into total stupidity with the Frank Langella character.  I also want to note that Adrian Lyne is a genius and my favorite director, bar none. I just don't think even he could make something of this. It's all about Irons.

510731,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00001IVFE,"""eurotrashgirl""","[8, 10]","This movie is well-directed and acted. Period music fills it with an authentically '40's feel. I think the film has a touch of film noir as  well. (There are some rainy night scenes, several scenes of shadows,  darkness, blue light and smoke, and some mysterious characters and plot  twists.) Also, Lolita and Humbert are &quot;on the run&quot; for much of  the film, which adds some suspense (and makes it even more film noir). (I  find it funny that Amazon includes this film in its &quot;Murder and  Mayhem&quot; category. I didn't know there was such a thing!)In any  event, I think that's what I loved most about the film, the constant  travelling, moving on. I thought it was interesting too that the only  constancy between them as they drove from place to place was each other,  and that it was in this way that they really got to know one another and  love each other, two souls meandering. It seems an altogether American  story (road-trip/adventure) in that sense. I also liked seeing the actual  cars from that era, and the hotel rooms with the coin-operated music  players, etc. I think the director did a nice job with all of these  details.Critics of the subject matter should know that this is not an  all-or-nothing movie, and that part of the tragedy of the story lies in the  very thing which creates it, ie: Humbert's obsession with girls who are  almost, but not quite yet, women. In other words, no one escapes  scot-free.Jeremy Irons, true to form, digs deep into his character and  does an amazing job at showing the depth of Humbert's feelings, both the  elation he feels in his love/lust/relationship with Lolita, and the despair  when he realizes he can never really capture her in the way he wants/needs.  Lolita is his heaven and his hell.Swain gives a solid performance as  Lolita (&quot;Dolores Hayes&quot;). She captures well all the  (contradicting) elements of graceful &quot;nymphette&quot; and awkward,  un-ladylike teenage girl. (It is this very contradiction that Humbert  himself tells us would not likely be enough for a &quot;normal&quot; man,  but which transfixes Humbert to his very soul.) With such a well-acted  first role, she shows great promise as an actress.All in all, an  interesting way to spend an evening.PS: The video I rented included a  behind-the-scenes segment which featured commentary by British director  Adrian Lyne and the cast. I found it interesting, but would suggest  watching it *after* viewing the film, because it shows scenes from the  whole movie, and may take some of the magic out of watching the plot unfold  by watching the film itself.",4,"1940's Road Trip: Love, Lust and Tragedy",966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2614,"['movie', 'well-directed', 'acted', 'Period', 'music', 'authentically', 'feel', 'think', 'film', 'touch', 'film', 'noir', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'rainy', 'night', 'scenes', 'several', 'scenes', 'shadows', 'darkness', 'blue', 'light', 'smoke', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'Also', 'Lolita', 'Humbert', 'are', 'quot', 'run', 'quot', 'much', 'film', 'suspense', 'even', 'more', 'film', 'noir', 'find', 'Amazon', 'film', 'quot', 'Murder', 'Mayhem', 'quot', 'category', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'event', 'think', 'what', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'constant', 'travelling', 'moving', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'too', 'only', 'constancy', 'drove', 'place', 'place', 'was', 'other', 'was', 'way', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'one', 'love', 'other', 'two', 'souls', 'meandering', 'altogether', 'American', 'story', 'road-trip/adventure', 'sense', 'also', 'liked', 'seeing', 'actual', 'cars', 'era', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'coin-operated', 'music', 'players', 'etc', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'details.Critics', 'subject', 'matter', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'all-or-nothing', 'movie', 'part', 'tragedy', 'story', 'very', 'thing', 'Humbert', 'obsession', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'yet', 'women', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'scot-free.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'true', 'form', 'digs', 'deep', 'character', 'amazing', 'job', 'showing', 'depth', 'Humbert', 'feelings', 'elation', 'love/lust/relationship', 'Lolita', 'despair', 'when', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'capture', 'way', 'Lolita', 'heaven', 'hell.Swain', 'solid', 'performance', 'Lolita', 'quot', 'Dolores', 'Hayes', 'quot', 'well', 'contradicting', 'elements', 'graceful', 'quot', 'quot', 'awkward', 'un-ladylike', 'teenage', 'girl', 'very', 'contradiction', 'Humbert', 'would', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'enough', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'man', 'transfixes', 'Humbert', 'very', 'soul', 'well-acted', 'first', 'role', 'great', 'promise', 'actress.All', 'interesting', 'way', 'spend', 'evening.PS', 'video', 'rented', 'included', 'behind-the-scenes', 'segment', 'featured', 'commentary', 'British', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'cast', 'found', 'interesting', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', '*after*', 'viewing', 'film', 'scenes', 'whole', 'movie', 'may', 'take', 'magic', 'watching', 'plot', 'unfold', 'watching', 'film']",N/A
510732,A742NFYPDU2P,B00001IVFE,Evan E. Richards,"[8, 11]","This films greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. This movie plays Humberts obsession with Lolita seriously and sympathetically. You can't help but feel bad for Humbert by the end of the movie as it is really Lolita who takes advantage of him and not the other way around. That is the film's strength but also the weakness; Lolita is 12 years old. That's just creepy. This film tries to make you feel bad for a man who, for all intents and purposes, uses his charm and status as stepfather to sleep with his 12 year old daughter. I find it disturbing. Surely this was not Nabokov's intention when he wrote the novel.Jeremy Irons is very good at the role he plays, but he isn't the character the books gives us. The character in the book was not a nice man. He drugged his wife, he planned to drug Lolita to take advantage of her while she slept, he lied and manipulated, he planned in his mind to kill his wife and probably would have had she not been killed before he could get to it. But Jeremy Irons is not like that at all. His character is just a lonely man in the wrong place at the wrong time; he is haunted and almost, it seems, justified in his love(?) for Lolita by the sad events of his childhood.Melanie Griffith is not a good Charlotte at all. She is not nagging enough, she is far too good looking, and until she give Humbert her love letter there is no indication that she is in love with him. There definitely needed to be more time spent developing her character.Doninque Swain seemed far too aware of what she was doing at times, and far too childish at other times. The film made her look like the bad guy for seducing Humbert and using his obsession with her as a weapon against him. That isn't how the books played her at all.Clare Quilty is all but absent in this film. He has a very short appearance at the hotel, and then we don't see him again until the end of the film. The book gives him a lot of charisma that was completely absent; in this film he is just a dirty old man. Look to Sellers performance in the 1962 version for a much more rounded and exact portrayal of Quilty.Overall, this was not a bad film if it stood on its own. The camera work is excellent in expressing the emotions of the film and Jeremy Irons is excellent is his portrayal of a Humbert (albeit a different one that was presented to us in the book) but this film misses the message of the book even if it is a more literal cinematic translation of the book.",4,Close but so far away...,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,2469,"['films', 'greatest', 'strength', 'also', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'movie', 'Humberts', 'obsession', 'Lolita', 'seriously', 'sympathetically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bad', 'Humbert', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'Lolita', 'who', 'advantage', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'film', 'strength', 'also', 'weakness', 'Lolita', '12', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'creepy', 'film', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'man', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'charm', 'status', 'stepfather', 'sleep', '12', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'find', 'disturbing', 'Surely', 'was', 'not', 'Nabokov', 'intention', 'when', 'wrote', 'novel.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'very', 'good', 'role', ""n't"", 'character', 'books', 'character', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'nice', 'man', 'drugged', 'wife', 'planned', 'drug', 'Lolita', 'take', 'advantage', 'slept', 'lied', 'manipulated', 'planned', 'mind', 'kill', 'wife', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'killed', 'could', 'get', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'not', 'character', 'just', 'lonely', 'man', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'haunted', 'almost', 'justified', 'love', 'Lolita', 'sad', 'events', 'childhood.Melanie', 'Griffith', 'not', 'good', 'Charlotte', 'not', 'nagging', 'enough', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'give', 'Humbert', 'love', 'letter', 'indication', 'love', 'definitely', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'developing', 'character.Doninque', 'Swain', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'aware', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'times', 'far', 'too', 'childish', 'other', 'times', 'film', 'made', 'look', 'bad', 'guy', 'seducing', 'Humbert', 'using', 'obsession', 'weapon', ""n't"", 'how', 'books', 'played', 'all.Clare', 'Quilty', 'absent', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'appearance', 'hotel', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'end', 'film', 'book', 'lot', 'charisma', 'was', 'completely', 'absent', 'film', 'just', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'Look', 'Sellers', 'performance', '1962', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'rounded', 'exact', 'portrayal', 'Quilty.Overall', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'stood', 'own', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'film', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Humbert', 'different', 'one', 'was', 'presented', 'book', 'film', 'message', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'literal', 'cinematic', 'translation', 'book']",N/A

510735,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00001IVFE,"""flickjunkie""","[20, 24]","This is an excellent adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant book about the sordid relationship between a grown man and a teenage girl.  Although still disconcerting, the subject of pedophilia is far less shocking today than when the book was published almost 50 years ago.  Yet, despite the subject matter, the book was wildly popular because it was a literary work of art, beautifully written with some of the most splendid metaphors and descriptive narrative in American literature.  This was all the more amazing when one considers that English was Nabokov's second language.Director Adrian Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9  weeks, Indecent Proposal) is no stranger to stories with perverse sexual content.  His presentation of the story does the book justice although certain interpretations may not have been what Nabokov had in mind.  Lynn gives us a presentation that is very sympathetic to Humbert.  Nabokov's Humbert was very complex, partly a victim of his fixation on young girls, partly a sexual predator and partly a hopeless romantic.  Nabokov's Lolita was extremely innocent, just approaching the threshold of sexual curiosity and urges, more playful than consciously provocative.  While Nabokov hints at a mutual seduction, he leans far more heavily towards Humbert as the cause of the events even though Humbert is clearly helpless in the face of his obsession.  Lolita entered into the sexual relationship more as a result of longings burgeoning from her blossoming sexuality than a desire to seduce Humbert in particular, who was not even her first lover.Lynn's presentation transforms Humbert from the seducer into the seduced, whose weakness for young girls is manipulated by a sexually precocious siren tempting him to dash himself on the shoals of pedophilia.  Lynn portrays Lolita as the aggressor, an adolescent temptress who knows she is desired and simultaneously teases and entices him to do her lustful bidding, knowing he is powerless to resist.  Lynn's Humbert is more of a hapless romantic than a fiend, ennobling him as a victim of love rather than the confounded sociopath he really is.  In Lynn's version, Humbert becomes the fly to Lolita's spider.However, after the initial seduction when they take to the road, the film is very true to the book in chronicling the decay of the relationship showing Humbert's further plunge into feelings of romantic desperation and Lolita's shrewish exploitation of him as she increasingly uses sex as a weapon.  The book was very effective at portraying the relationship as a symbiosis of two deficient beings, each selfishly taking from the other what was needed.  Lynn does an excellent job of portraying that here.  As the relationship degenerates, Lynn is effectual at portraying the ugly side of both characters.  The bitterness and rancor that results is compelling.  To his credit, he understands that Nabokov's story was more of a character study than a sex story and Lynn avoids the temptation of becoming too lurid, focusing instead on solid character development of two very flawed beings.I must take a moment to give Lynn the highest praise for his period renderings.  This is one of the finest portrayals of 1940's Americana I can remember.  The costumes, hairstyles, cars, furniture, locations and sets create a 40's reality that is like being hurtled back in a time machine.  The music is not just precise for the period, but it is perfectly integrated with the story.  As the two travel, the music changes to reflect the region.  Having Lolita dance and sing to period music on the radio is a nice touch because that is exactly what teenage girls of any era are apt to do.The acting is first rate all around.  When the film was made, Dominique Swain was 17, and although she looked young for her age, she could never pass for 12.  So for the first part of the film before Charlotte's demise, she is simply too mature.  However, for the road trip she is ideal.  Though I don't agree with Lynn's early interpretation of Lolita as the teenage temptress, I can't imagine it being done any better than the performance Swain delivers.  She is playful and provocative in a childlike manner, part pixie and part vamp.  Once they get on the road, Swain hits stride with a performance that is almost a force of nature.  She is powerful and intense, effortlessly moving back and forth between sweet innocence and the emotional torrent typified by the ""murder me"" scene.  It is an outstanding performance with depth and breadth that is very unusual for an actor so young.Jeremy Irons is wonderful as Humbert, giving him as amiable a personality as one could possibly imagine for a character with such vile intentions.  Irons injects a good deal of wry humor into the part in addition to giving Humbert an almost quixotic romantic quality.  Melanie Griffith is just the wrong actress to play Charlotte.  She looks nothing like the portly and plain character described in Nabokov's book.  Though her acting is fine and she is appropriately obsequious, she is far too attractive to be the repulsive troll Humbert despised.  It takes away from Humbert's desperation because it hardly seems like a great sacrifice to have married Charlotte to be near Lolita.Frank Langella (Dracula) is more obnoxious than mysterious as Quilty, making the audience want to exhort Humbert to pull the trigger as he confronts Quilty with the revolver.  Again, I think this is probably Lynn's doing since his vision is clearly that of a Humbert sympathizer.This is a fine film with great production values, terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book, even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks.",4,"Humbert the noble, or how to make a pedophile lovable.",1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,5845,"['excellent', 'adaptation', 'Vladimir',

510737,A2EIRCMHTO7CUI,B00001IVFE,Frank Messely,"[1, 1]","Adrian Lyne's LOLITA is a great achievement, a movie that wonderfully succeeds in evoking the atmosphere of Nabokov's classic of a doomed love.  Even though Dominique Swain is just that little bit too mature physically to be a convincing Nabokovian nymphet, her superb acting amply makes up for it.  She is both seductress and victim.  And unlike the pathetic pervert Mason/Humbert in Kubrick's version, Irons is the perfect choice here, a passionate poet instead, manipulated by Lo as well as his never fulfilled desires.  Kubrick is a creative genius because he always refused to compromise, and that's exactly the reason why he shouldn't have made LOLITA, at least not back then (it seems the seventies would have been the right time).  In the nineties the world was already suffering from that amplified fear of the future, frenetically over-protecting its only hope, children (Jock Sturges, and, more recently, Bill Henson), a course of action that will ultimately result in what the moral crusaders so desperately want to avoid.  What makes Adrian Lyne's film so good is that he shows us two victims, Lolita as well as Humbert.  The true demon, as in the novel, is Clare Quilty, not a desperate lover of innocence and beauty here, but a true exploiter of children, also convincingly portrayed by Frank Langella.  Ennio Morricone's music is some of his finest, in which one can almost hear the haunting call `Lo-li-ta' repeated over and over again.  LOLITA is one of the saddest love stories adapted to the screen, and Adrian Lyne's version is a must-see for lovers of great literature.  Not hard to understand that in a society that grows increasingly materialistic, rational, and, above all, paranoid of its own specters, that such a fine adaptation of great literature didn't reach the audience (or was hardly allowed to do so).",5,Of poets and perverts,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,1836,"['Adrian', 'Lyne', 'LOLITA', 'great', 'achievement', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'evoking', 'atmosphere', 'Nabokov', 'classic', 'doomed', 'love', 'Even', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'mature', 'physically', 'be', 'convincing', 'Nabokovian', 'nymphet', 'superb', 'acting', 'amply', 'up', 'seductress', 'victim', 'pathetic', 'pervert', 'Mason/Humbert', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Irons', 'perfect', 'choice', 'here', 'passionate', 'poet', 'instead', 'manipulated', 'Lo', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'fulfilled', 'desires', 'Kubrick', 'creative', 'genius', 'always', 'refused', 'compromise', 'exactly', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'LOLITA', 'least', 'not', 'back', 'then', 'seventies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'time', 'nineties', 'world', 'was', 'already', 'suffering', 'amplified', 'fear', 'future', 'frenetically', 'over-protecting', 'only', 'hope', 'children', 'Jock', 'Sturges', 'more', 'recently', 'Bill', 'Henson', 'course', 'action', 'will', 'ultimately', 'result', 'what', 'moral', 'crusaders', 'so', 'desperately', 'want', 'avoid', 'What', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'two', 'victims', 'Lolita', 'as', 'well', 'Humbert', 'true', 'demon', 'novel', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'not', 'desperate', 'lover', 'innocence', 'beauty', 'here', 'true', 'exploiter', 'children', 'also', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'music', 'finest', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'haunting', 'call', 'Lo-li-ta', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', 'LOLITA', 'one', 'saddest', 'love', 'stories', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'version', 'must-see', 'lovers', 'great', 'literature', 'Not', 'hard', 'understand', 'society', 'increasingly', 'materialistic', 'rational', 'paranoid', 'own', 'specters', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'great', 'literature', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'audience', 'was', 'hardly', 'allowed', 'do', 'so']",N/A

Although it's probably unfair to this movie,  I would have liked it much better had I not just reread Nabokov's great novel. There is no way to convey visually what the novelist does with language since he is forever playing word games on the reader. Also the comic aspects of the written word are difficult visually although Irons has some success at this.Given those reservations,the first half of the movie is beautifully done.

The fact that its author was not a native speaker of English makes his achievement all the  more amazing.  &quot;Lolita&quot; simply must be read, and any attempts to  convert it to the medium of film must inevitably suffer in comparison.  That said, Adrian Lyne's film is as close to perfect a translation from  book to screen as one could hope to find.  The performances are  pitch-perfect:  Dominique Swain, in her first film role captures the  essence of Nabakov's creation, at once gangly and seductive; endearing,  infuriating and a definite &quot;starlet&quot;.  The viewer, like Humbert,  is quickly wooed and won.  Melanie Griffith gives her small role as  Charlotte a tarnished dignity and a weary grace, and Frank Langella does  what he can with the enigmatic, barely-seen Quilty.  But Jeremy Irons  simply carries the film.  Known for plumbing baser human emotions in all  his films, he embues Humbert Humbert with a simple humanity that is  heartbreaking to watch.  To admit to liking Humbert even a little is  uncomfortable--it means empathizing on some level with the force that  drives him, even as we may be disgusted by his actions, but it is  impossible not to be charmed.  Irons drops his customary reserved demeanor  to mine the humor in the role, and his voice-overs of dialog straight from  the book are most effective.This film version succeeds where Stanley  Kubrick's 1962 version failed in remaining true to the spirit of Nabakov's  vision.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's just a shame that the  self-serving hypocrisy of the studio heads involved prevented its American  theatrical release when so much commercial swill packed with violence and  degradation of all kinds passes for entertainment in this country.",5,Long Overdue Tribute to Nabakov a Masterpiece,939859200,"10 14, 1999",1999,1880,"['novel', 'quot', 'Lolita', 'quot', 'justly', 'been', 'called', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'written', 'English', 'language', 'Shakespeare', 'fact', 'author', 'was', 'not', 'native', 'speaker', 'English', 'achievement', 'more', 'amazing', 'quot', 'Lolita', 'quot', 'simply', 'must', 'be', 'read', 'attempts', 'convert', 'medium', 'film', 'must', 'inevitably', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'said', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'translation', 'book', 'screen', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'find', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch-perfect', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'essence', 'Nabakov', 'creation', 'once', 'gangly', 'seductive', 'endearing', 'infuriating', 'definite', 'quot', 'starlet', 'quot', 'viewer', 'Humbert', 'quickly', 'wooed', 'won', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'small', 'role', 'Charlotte', 'tarnished', 'dignity', 'weary', 'grace', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'what', 'can', 'enigmatic', 'barely-seen', 'Quilty', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'simply', 'film', 'Known', 'plumbing', 'baser', 'human', 'emotions', 'films', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'simple', 'humanity', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'admit', 'liking', 'Humbert', 'even', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'empathizing', 'level', 'force', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'disgusted', 'actions', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'charmed', 'Irons', 'customary', 'reserved', 'demeanor', 'mine', 'humor', 'role', 'voice-overs', 'dialog', 'straight', 'book', 'are', 'most', 'effective.This', 'film', 'version', 'where', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1962', 'version', 'failed', 'remaining', 'true', 'spirit', 'Nabakov', 'vision', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'just', 'shame', 'self-serving', 'hypocrisy', 'studio', 'heads', 'involved', 'prevented', 'American', 'theatrical', 'release', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'commercial', 'swill', 'packed', 'violence', 'degradation', 'kinds', 'passes', 'entertainment', 'country']",N/A

But, the most striking feature of this film is the cinematography which gives the story a much more evocative feel.  While it is through Humbert Humbert that we see Lolita, Lyne finds more subtle ways to probe Lolita than did Kubrick, who treated her very much as an object.  I suppose in that sense it may have been a little closer to Nabokov's original telling, but Lyne has a more sensitive eye to detail and the devastating relationship that forms between Humbert and Lolita.  The script stays close to the novel.  Lyne lavishes much attention on the cross-country trip and the rain-soaked stay in New Orleans.  I felt Jeremy Irons did a better job than James Mason in capturing Humbert's psyche, better able to convey the emotions that led to his ill-fated obsession in Lolita.  The film also evocatively recalls the genesis for Humbert's obsession.

510747,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B00001IVFE,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[8, 11]","Its grotesquely unfair to such talented folks as director Adrian Lyne, Jeremy Irons, Frank Langella, and Dominique Swain but its impossible to really give their efforts to create the second film version of Nabakov's dark comedy a totally fair hearing.  If you've seen Kubrick's brilliant 1962 version, its hard to watch this second film without comparing the two.  If you want more explicit raciness, than you'll probably have a better time with Lyne's version (and to be honest, who doesn't sometimes want more explicit raciness?).  However, if you're looking for a film that manages to capture Nabakov's sly wit and the wonderful perversity of his language, Kubrick's version remains unparralelled.Anyway, taken on its own merits, Adrian Lyne's Lolita is a more-or-less average film dealing with Humbert Humbert's sexual obsession with the young nymphet Lolita Haze.  Lyne has always been a flashy director but on the whole, he's far more subdued here than he has been in the past and that works to the film's credit.  Since soft-core variations of this same premise have been showing up on Cinemax for the past few decades, Lyne doesn't sensationalize Humbert's attraction but proceeds rather matter-of-factly.  In short, he directs the film in the exact opposite of the way we'd expect him to direct it and that brings a needed level of surprise to a story that is no longer as shocking as it once was.  Though the script is never more than mediocre (jettisoning much of Nabakov's complex wordplay, probably to make the film more &quot;accessible&quot;), Lyne does come up with some beautiful images.  While Kubrick's film showed us how beautiful black-and-white can be, it would be unfair not to mention that Lyne's version does the same thing for color.  Another reviewer put it best (and so I won't try to claim this insight for my own) when they said that Lyne's images supply the eloquence of Nabakov's original prose.As for the acting, its a mixed bag.  As Lolita's mother, Melanie Griffith is rather shrill and never seemed to be truly into the character.  As readers of the book know, the character is one that can both break your heart and annoy you to death.  Griffith does neither.  She just seems to be Melanie Griffith, slumming.  Jeremy Irons is a perfect choice for Humbert and there lies the problem.  His casting is too obvious and there's nothing really subversive or shocking about discovering this man is a pedophile.  Its a bit like making a film about an overeducated gentleman who is revealed to be a cannibal and then casting Anthony Hopkins in the role.  Sure, we know Hopkins can play the part but who's really going to be surprised?  Frank Langella, as the equally perverse Clare Quilty, shows the potential to be a fascinating character but Lyne doesn't seem to know what to do with him and as a result, Langella just sort of pops up whenever the story needs to be pushed forward.  However, Dominique Swain is an excellent Lolita and, unlike Sue Lyon in the original, shows evidence of being a fine actress in her own right.  She brings a beguiling sense of self-centered innocence and a destructively niave sexuality to her role and, finally, she makes the film worth watching.",3,More evidence that life is unfair,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,3210,"['grotesquely', 'unfair', 'such', 'talented', 'folks', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'impossible', 'really', 'give', 'efforts', 'create', 'second', 'film', 'version', 'Nabakov', 'dark', 'comedy', 'totally', 'fair', 'hearing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kubrick', 'brilliant', '1962', 'version', 'hard', 'watch', 'second', 'film', 'comparing', 'two', 'want', 'more', 'explicit', 'raciness', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'time', 'Lyne', 'version', 'be', 'honest', 'who', ""n't"", 'sometimes', 'want', 'more', 'explicit', 'raciness', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'capture', 'Nabakov', 'sly', 'wit', 'wonderful', 'perversity', 'language', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'unparralelled.Anyway', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Lolita', 'more-or-less', 'average', 'film', 'dealing', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'young', 'nymphet', 'Lolita', 'Haze', 'Lyne', 'always', 'been', 'flashy', 'director', 'whole', 'far', 'more', 'subdued', 'here', 'been', 'past', 'film', 'credit', 'soft-core', 'variations', 'same', 'premise', 'have', 'been', 'showing', 'up', 'Cinemax', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'Lyne', ""n't"", 'sensationalize', 'Humbert', 'attraction', 'proceeds', 'rather', 'matter-of-factly', 'short', 'film', 'exact', 'opposite', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'direct', 'needed', 'level', 'surprise', 'story', 'no', 'longer', 'as', 'shocking', 'once', 'was', 'script', 'never', 'more', 'mediocre', 'jettisoning', 'much', 'Nabakov', 'complex', 'wordplay', 'probably', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'quot', 'accessible', 'quot', 'Lyne', 'come', 'up', 'beautiful', 'images', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'showed', 'how', 'beautiful', 'black-and-white', 'can', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'not', 'mention', 'Lyne', 'version', 'same', 'thing', 'color', 'reviewer', 'put', 'best', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'claim', 'insight', 'own', 'when', 'said', 'Lyne', 'images', 'supply', 'eloquence', 'Nabakov', 'original', 'prose.As', 'acting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Lolita', 'mother', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'rather', 'shrill', 'never', 'seemed', 'be', 'truly', 'character', 'readers', 'book', 'know', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'break', 'heart', 'annoy', 'death', 'Griffith', 'just', 'be', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'slumming', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Humbert', 'problem', 'casting', 'too', 'obvious', 'nothing', 'really', 'subversive', 'shocking', 'discovering', 'man', 'pedophile', 'bit', 'making', 'film', 'overeducated', 'gentleman', 'who', 'revealed', 'be', 'cannibal', 'then', 'casting', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'role', 'Sure', 'know', 'Hopkins', 'can', 'play', 'part', 'who', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'surprised', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'equally', 'perverse', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'potential', 'be', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Lyne', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'result', 'Langella', 'just', 'sort', 'pops', 'whenever', 'story', 'be', 'pushed', 'forward', 'However', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'excellent', 'Lolita', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'original', 'evidence', 'being', 'fine', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'beguiling', 'sense', 'self-centered', 'innocence', 'destructively', 'niave', 'sexuality', 'role', 'finally', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

510751,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00001IVFE,Josh Hitchens,"[21, 29]","Although Adrian Lyne's Lolita is a good film adaption of Vladimir Nabokov's superb novel, it contains fatal flaws. First I will say that the cinematography is glorious and the score by Ennio Morriconne lush and romantic. I expected Jeremy Irons as the obsessed Humbert Humbert to turn in a mind blowing performance. Unfortunately, he stands around looking glum most of the time. Dominique Swain as the nymphet Lolita does have several impressive moments, but ultimately is unconvincing as she comes across as nothing more than a 90s brat. I will say though that the relationship between Humbert and Lolita does have its very powerful moments, just not enough of them.I don't hold these faults to the actors. I think Adrian Lyne, the director is responsible for the films flaws. For one thing, he seems to want to make Lolita look as unattractive as possible every chance he gets. She takes out her retainer before performing oral sex on Humbert, and is frequently seen munching on bananas and getting milk mustaches. Also in one scene, we see Lolita sitting diown, laughing as she reads a comic book. The camera moves away to reveal that Humbert is making love to her. This and other scenes make the relationship between Humbert and Lolita repulsive, and if you're going to make a film based on Lolita, their relationship can't be portrayed as disgusting. The audience must be made to feel the love that Humbert has for this girl. It only partially succeeds. Irons also fails most in the ending scene where Lolita tells Humbert that she never loved him. Irons merely cries for two seconds and leaves. James Mason in Kubrick's version is much more moving. I also have a problem with the fact that Lyne seems to have duplicated the Kubrick film shot by shot in that scene.My last qualm is that this adaption is nearly completely devoid of humor, which is an essential aspect of Nabokov's story. Melanie Griffiths gives a fine performance as Charlotte Haze, but she is given far too little screen time. Frank Langella as Quilty is also quite amusing, too bad he only gets ten minutes to show it. Thus, when a 17 year old Lolita reveals to Humbert that it was Quilty who put her away, we don't care. It should be a revelation, but it is not.

Kubricks version was funny, it was less graphic and it wasn't as sad. Another thing that played a large part in my liking of the film is the fact that Dominique Swain is hotter than Sue Lyons. Melanie Griffith isn't as good as the original actress and I agree with other viewers, that she is the weak link in the film. Frank Langella is a lot more mysterious than Peter Sellers. Jeremy Irons performance is a lot sadder than James Mason's. I though that this movie was terrific. One thing I liked was director Adrian Lynes choice not to show Langellas face until the end. And one thing I didn't like was Lyne's choice not to show Swain naked except for (quite literally) a split second. Nudity, is necessary for a film like this, The film is about a man named Humbert Humbert (Irons),  who has received a teaching job in America and needs a place to stay for the summer. So, he moves in with Charlotte Haze (Griffith) who takes quite a liking to Humbert. Humbert however dislikes Charlotte, but is smitten with her daughter, Dolores,whom he calls Lolita. Lolita reminds Humbert of a girl in his younger years who died. But the love Humbert has for Lolita is not a pedophiles lust, but a deep love he has for her as a person. This love however is challened by playwright Clare Quilty(Langella). Irons is great in his best performance and this is one of the saddest films I have viewed. I liked Kubricks, but there is one thing I need to add. At the end of Kubricks it tells you what happened to Humbert, not Lolita. In Lyne's version it tells you what happened to Lolita, which seems to soften the blow. But only makes the film sadder. Great Film. A+.",5,A Very Well Done Film.

The acting (in particular by the marvellous Jeremy Irons and newcomer Dominique Swain)was fascinating. Both actors captured the ambivalence of the relationship between Humbert & Dolores(Lolita) perfectly.Irons excelled at portraying Humbert's obsession with Lolita; there were moments when one cringed at his self-delusion and his (perhaps) deliberate manipulation of his role of stepfather and yet one also felt as if he were swept away by inner forces he could not contain. Swain created a Lolita who was an intriguing mix of corrupted innocence and childish promiscuity, with a twist of cruelty that added depth to Humbert's ambiguous role in her life. As they fenced and toyed with each other, their repressed antagonism as powerful as their desire, the on-screen chemistry between Humbert and Swain intensified as the inevitable conclusion to their relationship approached.Adrian Lyne's directing was excellent - he created an atmosphere of fervent passion and uncontrollable emotions in a discreet and classy manner, proving that being subtle and leaving things to the imagination is often more effective and moving than blatant eroticism. The music score by Ennio Morricone was beautiful and enhanced the on-screen tension, while Howard Atherton's cinematography was superb.There were a few unexplained moments in the film which, if I'd read the book previously may have been less perplexing, but the movie was strong enough to hold the viewer's attention throughout the nearly 2 and 1/2 hours running time.

However, this is very good approximation of it.Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as Humbert, and captures the kind of clueless social fumbling and bumbling which is a large part of the character in the novel. Humbert is not comfortable around people of any age. Domenique Swain, in her first role, pulls off an acceptable version of the title character, both vulnerable and crafty. Although Frank Langella is no Peter Sellers, his rendition of Clare Quilty is much more realistic and true to the novel - even the over-the-top death scene with the ballet-like movements and red spit-bubble is almost straight from the book. A real problem was casting Melanie Griffith as Charlotte - unfortunately she was completely wrong for the part - being too shrill and light.The cinematography was excellent. The feeling of travel - 27,000 miles in the course of a couple years, and geography plays a substantial part in the book, and was well represented in the movie.Beautiful score by Morricone, who also did the well-regarded ""The Mission"" score.For all the good things in the movie, the same three things in both the Lyne and Kubrick versions bother me, as I feel it robs Humbert of some nuance to his character:1. No mention of pre-Lolita first wife. He was not always just into nymphets.2. No mention of post-Lolita second wife, Rita, (and taping the goodbye note to her navel so she would find it as he goes off to track down Lo).3. The last page and a half from the book was left out. This is possibly the most moving passage of the novel - when Hubert offers his apology for all his nastiness, and his admonition to Lolita, and the revelation that neither Lolita nor Humbert are alive as we read the book, and his pathetic summation...""I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.""The title cards at the end detailing the demise of the characters was a cheap out in both versions of the movie. Had there been a narration of the last page over, say, a scene of Humbert writing in jail (which in the novel is where the book is written in 56 days of captivity), I'd give this movie 5 stars.The DVD has a lot of extras including a commentary, rehearsal footage and 8 deleted scenes.Nothing replaces the book, and I suggest the ""Annotated Lolita"" version which has 140 pages of notes, helping with the nuances in the complex, convoluted novel.",4,"O lente currite noctis equi!

That may sound strange but this version of Lolita portrays her as more sexually wise than Humbert from the moment he first lays eyes on her. Melanie Griffin is dreadful.

Her Charlotte was a silly, stupid woman but she was also clearly a  vulnerable woman who was lonely and in love for the first time in her life. Her death is a sad, pitiable thing.Frank Langella is a sophisticated and completely evil Claire Quilty, he's good but I found myself thinking back to Peter Sellars' evil with a smiling face version of the character.  There are two really beautiful scenes in the film but they come at the end : first, when Humbert begs Lolita to come away with him and is soundly rejected and second, when he realizes that the big tragedy is not that Lolita is no longer in his bed but that she's not enjoying a normal teenaged life---in part because of Quilty yes, but mainly because of him and his insatiable need for her.

A great actor, he has been wonderful in many roles, but he is not Humbert Humbert.  Humbert was big and dark and hairy, handsome and educated but the opposite of Irons' catfoot delicacy.  Beyond this, Irons and Swain have no heat regardless.  The love scenes have this golden Hallmark falsity to them that could not possibly be further from Nabokov's intent.  This movie is a misfire in all ways, an absolute disaster.  I can envisage a wonderful adaptation of Lolita; what I cannot envision is where it will come from.  The US and UK are more uptight now than they were in the 50's and France isn't much interested in American stories, even when they are penned by a Russian internationalist.

You're drawn into the dreamlike quality of the scenery and music, it's like a gorgeous sleep that comes over you.  And yet, you go in fully knowing that it's a tragedy which is about to happen or has already happened.Jeremy Irons plays Humbert Humbert, a man with a penchant for young girls that he just cannot get past.  He moves into a house as a boarder with Charlotte, a grown up version of her daughter, Lolita.  While Charlotte has a thing for Humbert, he stays because he is in love with her daughter, Lolita.  Lolita is the nymphet, the deadly demon, who loves to provoke and tease to her heart's content.  A series of tragic accidents and purposeful things occur, and then Humbert is at last alone with Lolita.  The two of them embark on a journey which is as much as a cross country adventure as it is an exploration of what is or isn't happening between them.  It's oddly hard to keep in mind that Humbert is the villain in this saga, that he is the monster that we warn kids about who is seemingly innocent and hard working and yet we are silently hoping for him at the same time.  Lolita is as much a plaything as she is a demon, who knows she can use what she has in a power trip over Humbert to get the things that she wants and uses it quite a bit.  How it ends?  Won't give that away, but we know based on this horrible, tragic event that it's doomed.It's rather slow moving and yet you wouldn't want it any other way.  Perhaps it's all about wanting to be innocent and happy again with someone or something that you want to be just so innocent and happy with.",4,"light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.

The fact that Dominique had zero previous acting experience was of course the very reason that she could not possibly have won. I mean that would point out a rather obvious fact about Hollywood.....Anyway this movie is very atmospheric and will make you happy, sad, sick, and angry. Which is exactly what a good movie is supposed to do....drag out your feelings/emotions. This is a timepiece movie and you really get a feel for the 1940's. We all know the story about an older man infatuated with a young girl so I won't rehash any of that...it is the backbone of the whole thing. Mr. Irons is absolutely perfect in the role of the hopelessly torn and consumed Humbert. He has a way of saying so much without having to say a word. Mr. Langella is the perfect villain and whereas you have empathy for Humbert, you have none for Quilte. Melanie Griffith gives a good performance as the unaware and overbearing mother who herself falls hard for Humbert.I especially liked the fact that Dominique was never shown nude. This actually increases the erotic element of their relationship and keeps an edge on the movie. The emphasis on the girls bare feet and legs puts a punctuation mark on her coltish figure and her ""barefoot girl next door"" image that is so cute and yet so seductive, in a natural and innocent way.There is also a very interesting point made (Humberts first tragic love...) regarding ""sexual imprinting"" that boils down to your first sexual experience sometimes being the reason you gravitate towards a certain type of person whether it be age, weight, or even sex. It is like you become fixated based on moment in time and you just continue to loop on that fixation. A most interesting theory. It may provide insight into the situation where an older adult falls hard for a young boy or girl.Dominique makes the movie. You can't fake being a nymphette. You either are or you aren't...and she is. She is so natural, playful, and innocently sexual she literally embodies everything that is attractive about young women. Easily the best performance by an actress I have seen in a long time.

I have seen many mixed reviews about it.  Mainly concerning the acts of Domonique Swain (Lolita).  But I found that this movie mimics the novel almost perfectly.  I was amazed at how well the actors portrayed the characters and brought them to life.  In the novel you get a good feel for the characters, but it is something very different to see them on screen.Swain is the perfect Lolita.  Although she was given braces in the movie, that is the only difference I could find.  The director is great, he really brings out Lolitas tomboy ways with certain camera angles that show her ""I dont care"" attitude, like putting her feet on a dest while wearing a skirt.I have to admit that between the music and the atmosphere of this wonderful love story, I became very water eyed.

Unfortunately, being faithful to the book is its major downfall as no one in the story has any chemistry with each other and the movie fails to bring out the humor of the book.If you only saw this version of the movie and not read the book, you might think this a good film. If you read the book, chances are, you have seen the Kubrick and this version and will inevitably make comparisons of the three. The book stands on its own and one could not realistically be made into a film using the book as the only reference. Nabokov wrote the script for Kubrick, but was eventually heavily edited by Kubrick (although still given screenplay credit). The book has too many subtleties and linguistic atmosphere that gets lost in cinema and so is compensated elsewhere.Adrian Lynne chose Melanie Griffith as Delores Haze, Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dorothy Swain as Lolita. All of them have their own merit, but together in this film they do not seem to get along to create substantial chemistry that gives the audience any feeling for them. Griffith has a flat affect in every line of dialogue and her scene where she discovers Humbert's secret is soft and expressionless. She comes off as dismissive more than angry or outraged. She seemed far too much in control. Jeremy Irons always seemed aloof and dumbstruck, especially in the scenes with Lolita. But this reaction never came across as the character Humbert in any way as intellectual. Humbert is not passionate nor a stuffy intellect, nor does any of his foolishness come through in the performance. Lastly, Swain as Lolita was just plain annoying. Yes, the book version of Lolita had her childish whims and charms, but there was an appealing quality that is not shown here.All of the characters all seem to be going through the motions of whats on the script, but no one ever really understanding the characters and missing the comedy as well. Which, as mentioned, this is a more faithful version of the book, but it seems to me that Lynn only saw it as a serious drama and not as a comedy of characters. Which is why, although Kubrick's version is not as faithful, keeps Nabokov's style of writing in tact within the film. Mason, Lyons and Winters as well as Sellers are perfect in their roles and know their characters from the 1962 version. There is much more psychology and irony in Kubrick than in this version.Adrian Lynne, whose past works include 9 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal, Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction are all sex themed stories, which makes me wonder if there was a type of exploitive quality that reduced this story to be about sex and not about Humbert Humbert's (albeit twisted) understanding of love.",2,A Close Adaptation Does Not Translate to Great Film,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2821,"['Adrian', 'Lyne', 'who', 'directed', 'newer', 'version', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'classic', 'love', 'story', ""'Lolita"", 'effort', 'be', 'true', 'book', 'Unfortunately', 'being', 'faithful', 'book', 'major', 'downfall', 'one', 'story', 'chemistry', 'other', 'movie', 'bring', 'out', 'humor', 'book.If', 'only', 'saw', 'version', 'movie', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'might', 'think', 'good', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'chances', 'are', 'have', 'seen', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'will', 'inevitably', 'make', 'comparisons', 'three', 'book', 'own', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'realistically', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'using', 'book', 'only', 'reference', 'Nabokov', 'wrote', 'script', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'eventually', 'heavily', 'edited', 'Kubrick', 'still', 'given', 'screenplay', 'credit', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'subtleties', 'linguistic', 'atmosphere', 'lost', 'cinema', 'so', 'compensated', 'elsewhere.Adrian', 'Lynne', 'chose', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Delores', 'Haze', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'Dorothy', 'Swain', 'Lolita', 'have', 'own', 'merit', 'together', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'along', 'create', 'substantial', 'chemistry', 'audience', 'feeling', 'Griffith', 'flat', 'affect', 'line', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'where', 'Humbert', 'secret', 'soft', 'expressionless', 'off', 'dismissive', 'more', 'angry', 'outraged', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'control', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'always', 'seemed', 'aloof', 'dumbstruck', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Lolita', 'reaction', 'never', 'came', 'character', 'Humbert', 'way', 'intellectual', 'Humbert', 'not', 'passionate', 'stuffy', 'intellect', 'foolishness', 'come', 'performance', 'Lastly', 'Swain', 'Lolita', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'Yes', 'book', 'version', 'Lolita', 'had', 'childish', 'whims', 'charms', 'was', 'appealing', 'quality', 'not', 'shown', 'here.All', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'whats', 'script', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'understanding', 'characters', 'missing', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'Which', 'mentioned', 'more', 'faithful', 'version', 'book', 'Lynn', 'only', 'saw', 'serious', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'characters', 'Which', 'why', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'not', 'faithful', 'Nabokov', 'style', 'writing', 'tact', 'film', 'Mason', 'Lyons', 'Winters', 'as', 'well', 'Sellers', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'know', 'characters', '1962', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'psychology', 'irony', 'Kubrick', 'version.Adrian', 'Lynne', 'past', 'works', 'include', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'Unfaithful', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'are', 'sex', 'themed', 'stories', 'wonder', 'was', 'type', 'exploitive', 'quality', 'reduced', 'story', 'be', 'sex', 'not', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'twisted', 'understanding', 'love']",N/A

Director Lyne's cop-out textual ending of 'what happened to Lolita' is reason enough to dismiss this overly sentimental film as a misinterpretation of the novel.The character of Claire Quilty is so poorly realized, I could only conclude that Lyne produced this for people who don't have the ability to read the book... that way, his audience couldn't say he got it wrong.  There's just one oddity after another in the interpretation.Best thing I can say is that Dominique Swain makes a better nymphet than Kubrick's Sue Lyon.  Another plus is the perky, pleasant art direction.  Everything light as a summer's day.  But on balance, this tends to just make the whole thing strangely sappy and sentimental, with an added effect of placing the controversial plot in a time and place that no longer exist.  I have to wonder if Lyne was just too scared of what people would say.For a rather better adaptation (considering especially the era of its production), do buy and watch (over and over) Kubrick's creepy stunner of the same title.

We know his back-story, we understand, we sympathize.  But it's unavoidable that it'll turn sour.  Without restraint, it's just inevitable.  It turns into the father-figure grounding and imposing parental-like restrictions on his daughter/lover to keep her to himself, and the daughter-figure manipulating her stepfather sexually/romantically to get what she wants as a rebellious dependent.  They're both abusing their roles, distorting them, using, being used, and becoming damaged in the process.  Crossing that boundary is playing with fire.  This is a lovely, powerful, tragic film in its own right.  And like all great tragedies, there's the effortless, absorbing setup.  Freakishly well cast.  Beautifully photographed.  Scored by one of the greats.  Yes, I noticed that Swain looks significantly older in certain scenes (though all of it was shot during the course of less than a year).  It was completely unintentional, but oddly enough, it works.  They did the first bed scene near the end of the shoot, and it makes the giving-in-to-temptation more believable with Swain looking much more mature...like we're getting into the psychology of the moment.  We accept how all the inhibitions could suddenly dissolve away for the protagonist.  And like the previous reviewer said, in the next scene she goes back to looking young again, sucking on a jawbreaker, and it's very effective at throwing us off.I'm not going to claim this is more faithful than Kubrick's.  That all depends on how you interpret it.  Both films take a lot of liberties, but in different ways.  This film is perhaps reminiscent of Lynch's adaptation of Dune, where that director became fixated on making doorknobs and bedboards look exactly as described in the novel, but left out whole themes.  Lyne gets obsessed with the look and sound of an ice box, but at least many of the themes and traces of satire are vaguely in tact, though deemphasized.  In a film adaptation, you have to make choices.  Kubrick and Nabokov chose the Satire Of America focus for the first.  In this one, the deeper character and tragedy study is carried through.  At least both versions went back to the book, each independently, rather than referring to each other.  You have to admit that's rare (e.g. Dune, red hair, etc).  Some scholars of Nabokov consider any concept of serious tragedy, character, or dramatic relationship at the expense of the satire to be a complete misinterpretation of Lolita.  Others consider the opposite to be true.  That's what's great about art, and I suppose the critics, too.

510770,A2DWA454V2VFFT,B00001IVFE,Richard Sibley,"[0, 0]","Dominique Swain (Lolita) is not a better actress than Sue Lyons (the 1962 Lolita), but the long script allows her to portray a 14-year-old girl in greater depth. (The novel had Lolita as 12 years old, but some decision-makers for each film could not stomach that in ""Lolita"" as a general-audience movie.) Swain's Lolita is a girl who has been raised for part of her life without a father -- and thus, statistically, is more likely to experiment with sex. She is never luscious as Sue Lyon is luscious --- she is adventurous. The book's Lolita is wistful. Dominique is never wistful, but one of the DVD covers shows wistfulness. That scene apparently was cut from the movie. I suspect that the tinge of anger on her face on the DVD cover is from how her facial muscles configure when she is relaxed and bemused.I do not see this as a love story. The only (mild) love that I detect in both films is when Lolita and Humbert part for good. In the 1987 movie, despite her dislike of Humbert, Lolita calls him ""Dad"", which tells me that she feels a tinge of daughterly love because she has no other older person.  She overlooks the dysfunction in their relationship and she pulls out enough function from her memory to label him as her ""Dad."" (Nietzsche wrote that if a person does not have an adequate father, then he/she would create one.)Humbert is somewhat sociopathic. Jeremy Irons' Humbert is less so than James Mason's Humbert. (Sociopathy involves, in part, no conscience, no compassion, possession instead of love, and an overwhelming desire to WIN.)  Humbert never comes across as clinically sociopathic, the type who can, in the words of a psychiatrist at the New Mexico State Penitentiary, ""look right through you"".Irons' Humbert is the one who does not plot to shoot his wife. Like Mason, he is obsessed and wants to possess Lolita; and even after Lolita is hopelessly lost to him, he -- like Mason -- is desperate to WIN somehow or other by destroying his mysterious rival for Lolita's attention. But both show some generosity toward the end. And in the very end, Irons shows real compassion.This movie adheres less to the novel than does the 1962 version, but I found this one more interesting to watch, largely for its detail.  It came out a generation later than the first, was less fettered by Hollywood norms as to what a general audience film could show, and had a bigger production budget.I have described Humbert here, since Nabokov describes Humbert.  But it would be interesting if someone were to convincingly write a companion novel that shows how Lolita felt about all of this.This is trivial, but there are two anachronisms.  In the beginning, Lolita says, ""See you later, alligator.""  The story is set in 1947, and I believe that ""See you later, alligator"" started with a songwriter in 1951 or 52, and was sung by Bill Haley.  Later in the movie, Lolita asks Humbert if she has a zit.  I was born in 1942 and I feel certain that ""zit"" was not spoken until the 1960s.",5,"Possession, not Love",1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,2989,"['Dominique', 'Swain', 'Lolita', 'not', 'better', 'actress', 'Sue', 'Lyons', '1962', 'Lolita', 'long', 'script', 'portray', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'greater', 'depth', 'novel', 'had', 'Lolita', '12', 'years', 'old', 'decision-makers', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'stomach', 'Lolita', 'general-audience', 'movie', 'Swain', 'Lolita', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'part', 'life', 'father', 'thus', 'statistically', 'more', 'likely', 'experiment', 'sex', 'never', 'luscious', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'luscious', 'adventurous', 'book', 'Lolita', 'wistful', 'Dominique', 'never', 'wistful', 'one', 'DVD', 'covers', 'wistfulness', 'scene', 'apparently', 'was', 'cut', 'movie', 'suspect', 'tinge', 'anger', 'face', 'DVD', 'cover', 'how', 'facial', 'muscles', 'configure', 'when', 'relaxed', 'bemused.I', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'love', 'story', 'only', 'mild', 'love', 'detect', 'films', 'when', 'Lolita', 'Humbert', 'part', 'good', '1987', 'movie', 'dislike', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'Dad', 'tinge', 'daughterly', 'love', 'other', 'older', 'person', 'dysfunction', 'relationship', 'out', 'enough', 'function', 'memory', 'label', 'Dad', 'Nietzsche', 'wrote', 'person', 'not', 'have', 'adequate', 'father', 'then', 'he/she', 'would', 'create', 'one', 'Humbert', 'somewhat', 'sociopathic', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Humbert', 'less', 'so', 'James', 'Mason', 'Humbert', 'Sociopathy', 'involves', 'part', 'conscience', 'compassion', 'possession', 'instead', 'love', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'WIN', 'Humbert', 'never', 'across', 'clinically', 'sociopathic', 'type', 'who', 'can', 'words', 'psychiatrist', 'New', 'Mexico', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'look', 'right', '.Irons', 'Humbert', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'plot', 'shoot', 'wife', 'Mason', 'obsessed', 'possess', 'Lolita', 'even', 'Lolita', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'Mason', 'desperate', 'WIN', 'somehow', 'other', 'destroying', 'mysterious', 'rival', 'Lolita', 'attention', 'show', 'generosity', 'end', 'very', 'end', 'Irons', 'real', 'compassion.This', 'movie', 'less', 'novel', '1962', 'version', 'found', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'largely', 'detail', 'came', 'out', 'generation', 'later', 'first', 'was', 'less', 'fettered', 'Hollywood', 'norms', 'what', 'general', 'audience', 'film', 'could', 'show', 'had', 'bigger', 'production', 'budget.I', 'have', 'described', 'Humbert', 'here', 'Nabokov', 'Humbert', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'someone', 'were', 'convincingly', 'write', 'companion', 'novel', 'how', 'Lolita', 'felt', 'this.This', 'trivial', 'are', 'two', 'anachronisms', 'beginning', 'Lolita', 'See', 'later', 'alligator', 'story', 'set', '1947', 'believe', 'See', 'later', 'alligator', 'started', 'songwriter', '1951', '52', 'was', 'sung', 'Bill', 'Haley', 'Later', 'movie', 'Lolita', 'Humbert', 'zit', 'was', 'born', '1942', 'feel', 'certain', 'zit', 'was', 'not', 'spoken', '1960s']",N/A

Not so with ""Lolita."" Humbert Humbert is as normal and as realistic as any other fictional character, and so are his human traits. He just so happens to fall in love/lust with Dolores, the fourteen year old daughter of Charlotte Haze, a widow with a room to rent. It is an unspoken fact that most men are attracted to teenage girls, yet are afraid to admit it because it is not acceptable for adults to act on these impulses. Most people see this as taking advantage of someone not yet old enough to make important decisions like this on their own. Even though Humbert acknowledges the socially unacceptability of this relationship and keeps it hidden from everyone, at the same time he indulges his fantasies and exploits his new-found fortunes. Although details would most likely differ, this sad tale is ultimately practical about the fate of a man who disregards reality and ignores potential consequences when he takes a fourteen year old girl as his lover. Many men would like to do this, John Mark Carr being one of the latest, yet few do because of the consequences. Most men can envision the effects of their actions and conclude both that this girl will not stay this age forever and he would not be able to keep this relationship secret indefinitely. In that sense, it is a cautionary tale for those who fantasize about this sort of thing. Conversely, it allows everyone else to experience a glimpse into the mind of someone who acts on this type of fantasy.

I'd read the book in college (20 years ago) and I'd seen Kubrick's film several times but I hadn't seen Adrian Lyne's film version.How did the book read now that I'm older?  A little creepier, especially since our society is rife with child abuse and child predators.  The book is still a controversial classic, brilliantly designed and written.To really appreciate this film version, it would help to read the novel.  The attention to detail is really something to see.Jeremy Irons was a great choice to play Humbert and the script really humanizes his otherwise criminal desires.  Dominique Swain at first looks like a gangly teenager but her sexuality seeps through the childish antics.Melanie Griffith at first looks too young and sexy as Charlotte but her voice and manner quickly becomes grating.  She still isn't the sad, pathetic character as Shelley Winters but she works very well.Frank Langella has huge shoes to fill as Clare Quilty after Peter Sellers' daffy, perverse take on the role, but he does a great job of playing the evil doppelganger in his brief scenes.  He isn't the chameleon-like tormentor of Kubrick's film but he is wonderfully menacing and shadowy, giving his shoes and fingers a sleazy presence in close-ups.Another big plus of this film: they filmed the great Chapter 35 closer to the novel's version, even including the bloody ""pink bubble.""This is a great adaption, but I'd recommend reading the novel before watching this film.",4,Very Close to the Novel,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1546,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Nabokov', 'LOLITA', 'then', 'watched', 'films', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'college', '20', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'version.How', 'did', 'book', 'read', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'little', 'creepier', 'especially', 'society', 'rife', 'child', 'abuse', 'child', 'predators', 'book', 'still', 'controversial', 'classic', 'brilliantly', 'designed', 'written.To', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'version', 'would', 'help', 'read', 'novel', 'attention', 'detail', 'really', 'something', 'see.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'Humbert', 'script', 'really', 'otherwise', 'criminal', 'desires', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'first', 'looks', 'gangly', 'teenager', 'sexuality', 'childish', 'antics.Melanie', 'Griffith', 'first', 'looks', 'too', 'young', 'sexy', 'Charlotte', 'voice', 'manner', 'quickly', 'grating', 'still', ""n't"", 'sad', 'pathetic', 'character', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'very', 'well.Frank', 'Langella', 'huge', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'daffy', 'perverse', 'take', 'role', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'evil', 'doppelganger', 'brief', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'chameleon-like', 'tormentor', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'menacing', 'shadowy', 'giving', 'shoes', 'fingers', 'sleazy', 'presence', 'close-ups.Another', 'big', 'plus', 'film', 'filmed', 'great', 'Chapter', '35', 'closer', 'novel', 'version', 'even', 'including', 'bloody', 'pink', 'bubble', 'great', 'adaption', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'reading', 'novel', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

Unfortunately this film's version of the main character Humbert isn't Nabokov's, and that's a shame because the strength of the story is Nabokov's detail in how addicted to 12-14 year old girls Humbert was.  It's as if the screenwriter and director were given a synopsis of the story and never took the time to actually read the novel.  That being said, Jeremy Irons was very good but you expect that from a serious actor.  This gets only one star for taking a great novel and not being true to the original author's main character.

After a perfunctory glance at the main character's past, we are suddenly thrust into his intense infatuation with the 'nymphette' of the title. We are rarely given a clue into who he really is, and only ever see him as he is when overwhelmed with a pathological sexual obsession with a teenage girl. Throughout the rest of the film, we are only introduced to two other characters, and we have no reason to like any of them; more to the point, there is no reason to care what happens to any of them.The director is at pains to continually refresh our memory as to the fact of Lolita's age (she is 14, unlike in Kubrick's earlier version, which made her 16, for obvious reasons) usually at the moment just where she is most sexually alluring, by giving us some visual reminder of her youth: braces; bubble-gum. The effect is quite sickening, but it is not enough to make us feel anything for the character.

But, I can honestly say that I do not have a  slightest desire to see Lolita again (at least, not any time soon). The  controversy around it went way out of proportion and may be done this film  a disfavor, unlike to other films.  Irons is so predictable and familiar  that viewers, who know his previous roles, can practically guess his every  gesture.
