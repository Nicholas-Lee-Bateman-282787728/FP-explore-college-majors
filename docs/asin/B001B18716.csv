I saw it coming in the third season, but I didn't  thought  that it will hit him so hard. All his speeches were like editorials. I miss Boston Legal's past quality  that confronted both sides of political views, like  the fights between pals Denny Crane and Alan about issues like gun control, or death penalty, to me those funny confrontations were more political effective than all the recents pontified speechs of Alan; and I miss characters  like Brad and Denisse, who were obviously not the cup ot tea of liberal Alan, but  were likable to most viewers and made Crane, Poole & Smith a more believable  law firm  that  the nut house that Carl is trying to put in order.From this season I enjoyed Carl, he is a great character. And I loved Kathy, she's the nicest lawyer of Crane, Poole & Smith, but so intelligent at the same time.  An Shirley, as always, is the best. If needed, she definetely  be my lawyer of choice. Alan Shore, this season, as much as I used to loved him, was too boring in his political correctness.",3,Not my favorite season,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,1298,"['season', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', 'producers', 'political', 'statements', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'most', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'lost', 'charming', 'amoral', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'become', 'perfect', 'political', 'preacher', 'saw', 'coming', 'third', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'will', 'hit', 'so', 'hard', 'speeches', 'were', 'like', 'editorials', 'miss', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'past', 'quality', 'confronted', 'sides', 'political', 'views', 'fights', 'pals', 'Denny', 'Crane', 'Alan', 'issues', 'gun', 'control', 'death', 'penalty', 'funny', 'confrontations', 'were', 'more', 'political', 'effective', 'recents', 'pontified', 'speechs', 'Alan', 'miss', 'characters', 'Brad', 'Denisse', 'who', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'cup', 'ot', 'tea', 'liberal', 'Alan', 'were', 'likable', 'most', 'viewers', 'made', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Smith', 'more', 'believable', 'law', 'firm', 'nut', 'house', 'Carl', 'trying', 'put', 'order.From', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'Carl', 'great', 'character', 'loved', 'Kathy', 'nicest', 'lawyer', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Smith', 'so', 'intelligent', 'same', 'time', 'Shirley', 'always', 'best', 'needed', 'definetely', 'be', 'lawyer', 'choice', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'loved', 'was', 'too', 'boring', 'political', 'correctness']",Boston Legal: Season 4
1169704,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B001B18716,A Forest Fan,"[0, 0]","This was election year, so the series would have even more advertisements to vote Democrat and shun those thoughtless Republicans (as represented by strawman Denny Crane). But the stories were really working this season, no matter how outlandish the lawsuits.Watching this season on DVD helped me and my family accurately predict the 'not guilty' outcome of the Casey Anthony trial on television. We had watched too much Boston Legal to believe the prosecutors had made their case in that real life trial. Alan Shore educated us on the concept of 'reasonable doubt'. You can't beat that sort of education from a fictional show.Prescience is something of an art, as I noted in previous seasons, this show missed the mark predicting that electing a Democrat president would get rid of Guantanamo Bay detentions, domestic wiretapping, and wasteful foreign wars. Oops!But in this season's ""Glow in the Dark"", Alan Shore does something remarkable. In arguing against the building of a new nuclear power plant, Alan gives an off-the-cuff warning of the danger of earthquakes and nuclear power plants. This was original aired in February 2008. Imagine the lives saved if this show had been a hit in Japan these past few years. (At least Japan's power companies might have been pressured to make the plants sturdier in case of earthquakes.)While Boston Legal always strove to stay on topic with the day's headlines (such as when Denny Crane accidentally 'taps his foot' to another man in a courthouse bathroom in the episode 'Oral Contracts'), it often ends up being timeless for future viewers.

Cherrington,"[1, 1]","From the peak of the successful season's two and three (or the first half of it anyway) we enter a VERY different looking offices of Crain, Poole and Schmitt.  In fact you could very well think that the show has been taken over by the liberal left...And sadly, it has.The usual wizzbanger of a season beginning case is found wanting with new headmaster, Carl Sakk landing on the firm like a sledge hammer.  Intimidating Clarence Bell, Jerry Espenson, and newbee Kate Hedges, John Larocquet soon settles in as the inforcer.  However he has very little influence on Allen and Denny who soon turn into bumbling sideshows espousing their opposing political agendas that we are familiar with.A surprise character, Lorrane, played by British actor Saffron Burrows is more for show than substance, mainly to keep Allen Shore amused. Shirley is still snooping around the corridors reminding everyone that she IS the main named partner.  With only token apperances by Paul Lewiston, and Brad Chase, it's such a shame that the 'hitmaker' characters are no longer relavent.Sadly the lead (Shore) is a shadow of his former self, more into ranting about the Bush Administration and the American way of life derailing. He finally getting a real nemisis in the return of Melvin Palmer, who tells everyone that Allen, can ""fire and shoot a breeze at the same time"". Brought back by popular demand, he will make an apperance in season five leaving Allan Shore speechless. A mid-western or Texas spin off with Melvin Palmer would be a real hoot! However too little too late.It would have been nice to see a visit by Edwin Poole, Donny Crain and the much talked about return of Tara Wilson, none of which have made a reapperance.The season plods along untill abruptly is cut short by the real workers in Hollywood...So we have a Season Five, and the end.",3,...And so the beginning of the End.,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1835,"['peak', 'successful', 'season', 'two', 'three', 'first', 'half', 'anyway', 'enter', 'VERY', 'different', 'looking', 'offices', 'Crain', 'Poole', 'Schmitt', 'fact', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'show', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'liberal', 'left', 'sadly', 'has.The', 'usual', 'wizzbanger', 'season', 'beginning', 'case', 'found', 'wanting', 'new', 'headmaster', 'Carl', 'Sakk', 'landing', 'firm', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'Intimidating', 'Clarence', 'Bell', 'Jerry', 'Espenson', 'newbee', 'Kate', 'Hedges', 'John', 'Larocquet', 'soon', 'inforcer', 'However', 'very', 'little', 'influence', 'Allen', 'Denny', 'who', 'soon', 'turn', 'bumbling', 'sideshows', 'espousing', 'opposing', 'political', 'agendas', 'are', 'familiar', 'with.A', 'surprise', 'character', 'Lorrane', 'played', 'British', 'actor', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'more', 'show', 'substance', 'mainly', 'keep', 'Allen', 'Shore', 'amused', 'Shirley', 'still', 'snooping', 'corridors', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'main', 'named', 'partner', 'only', 'token', 'apperances', 'Paul', 'Lewiston', 'Brad', 'Chase', 'such', 'shame', ""'hitmaker"", 'characters', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'relavent.Sadly', 'lead', 'Shore', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'more', 'ranting', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'derailing', 'finally', 'getting', 'real', 'nemisis', 'return', 'Melvin', 'Palmer', 'who', 'everyone', 'Allen', 'can', 'fire', 'shoot', 'breeze', 'same', 'time', 'Brought', 'back', 'popular', 'demand', 'will', 'make', 'apperance', 'season', 'five', 'leaving', 'Allan', 'Shore', 'speechless', 'mid-western', 'Texas', 'spin', 'off', 'Melvin', 'Palmer', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'hoot', 'However', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'visit', 'Edwin', 'Poole', 'Donny', 'Crain', 'much', 'talked', 'return', 'Tara', 'Wilson', 'none', 'have', 'made', 'reapperance.The', 'season', 'plods', 'untill', 'abruptly', 'cut', 'short', 'real', 'workers', 'Hollywood', 'So', 'have', 'Season', 'Five', 'end']",Boston Legal: Season 4

So I honestly wasn't planning on buying this right away. But being over here, in the Army with nothing really to do except go to work, and pretend I'm not here, I picked it up. Well I really couldn't resist because William Shatner is my biggest hero, and I love the character of Denny Crane.Watching this season from the beginning to end I realized this show was a lot better than I had expected, in fact better than season three, which kind of left me wanting a little bit more. Season Four brings back a lot of characters and stories from past seasons, more so from season two; witch is my favorite season over all.I was going to give this set a four star, because a few of the episodes it was a little hard to suspend disbelief, like when Alan go to the U.S. Supreme Court, I find it hard to believe they wouldn't have shut Alan down when he just unloads on them. But I had to give it five stars, because even though some episodes are hard to believe, for the most part, it tries to be fair when it comes to both sides of the issues, more so than Fox news itself, which they even take shots at from time to time. That's cool for a show that's a Fox property. But more than that I found myself laughing so hard in some episodes, I completely forgot that I was in this bleak and desolate country and felt like I was back home in the states among friends.It is sad that this next season is going to be short and last season, which surprises me because of all the praise and awards this show, has received over the years. But that falls on the suits at ABC, which they also take a few potshots at towards the end of this season.

The main characters are brought into sharper relief with some better stories that revolve around better things than plastic love dolls and the like. The interplay between the new female staff (Katie, Lorraine, Whitney) is most intriguing. Denny Crane gets trapped in one ridiculous situation after another and Jerry Espenson shows us ever deeper dimensions of his neurotic brilliance, but most assuredly we are laughing with them and not at them.

Perhaps my one criticism is that we don't always get the most satisfactory explanation as to how Denny and Alan manage to win some of the more preposterous cases (I mean, sometimes it seems just a bit too easy) and, in the event that they were to actually lose, would they be moping rather than celebrating at the closing scene?
