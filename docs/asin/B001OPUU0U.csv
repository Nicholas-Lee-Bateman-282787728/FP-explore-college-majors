If it wasn't for an almost fair script and acting I would have totally flipped the channel. The story revolves around a wacked out archeologist wanting to bring Ba'al back to life. Two people unite to stop his fiendish plot to become a god himself. I've certainly scene better (pun intended) but after watchingMega Shark vs Giant Octopus / 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, I'm willing to give more latitude to other SciFi movies. Afterall the intelligent dialogue and directing (Ziller) here was certainly better. Even with this, watching a giant storm and boring people arguing about how to stop it just didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.

Take the hokiest supernatural movie you've seen and combine it with the most ridiculous disaster movie you've seen, and you get a pretty good picture of what's going on with ""Ba'al: The Storm God.""  The thing that made me enjoy the stupid thing is that the writers actually spent a little effort trying to understand Sumerian mythology.  It's almost but not quite ""The Da Vinci Code"" with even more ancient mythology.  I see now the DVD costs less than $5.  That's about what it's worth.  But if you're a few dollars shy of getting free shipping, you could do worse than to tack this breezy, diverting confection onto your order.  Keep your expectations suitably low and the story is pretty much a hoot. And the special effects aren't too bad, either.  Harkens back to the days of cheesy drive-in movies and matinee specials.  It's not great cinema by any stretch, but it's pretty fun, and you might even learn a little about why some archeologists are so intrigued by Sumerian culture, which might, in some ways, have contributed to the Hebrew mythology that lies at the bedrock of much that is Western civilization.",4,"Four stars, but I LIKE bad movies, and Sumerian codes...",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,1141,"['dopey', 'movie', 'Take', 'hokiest', 'supernatural', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'combine', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'disaster', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'picture', 'what', 'going', ""Ba'al"", 'Storm', 'God', 'thing', 'made', 'enjoy', 'stupid', 'thing', 'writers', 'actually', 'spent', 'little', 'effort', 'trying', 'understand', 'Sumerian', 'mythology', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'even', 'more', 'ancient', 'mythology', 'see', 'now', 'DVD', 'less', '5', 'what', 'worth', ""'re"", 'few', 'dollars', 'shy', 'getting', 'free', 'shipping', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'tack', 'breezy', 'diverting', 'confection', 'order', 'Keep', 'expectations', 'suitably', 'low', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'hoot', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'back', 'days', 'cheesy', 'drive-in', 'movies', 'matinee', 'specials', 'not', 'great', 'cinema', 'stretch', 'pretty', 'fun', 'might', 'even', 'learn', 'little', 'why', 'archeologists', 'are', 'so', 'intrigued', 'Sumerian', 'culture', 'might', 'ways', 'have', 'contributed', 'Hebrew', 'mythology', 'bedrock', 'much', 'Western', 'civilization']",Ba'al: The Storm God

This one was stupid. It somehow confounded the Dead Sea Scrolls (Hebrew about 2,000 year ago) with Sumerian (4,000 years ago) or 12,000 years ago according to some stones in the movie. The two do not mix. They could have used some actual Sumerian/Akkadian tablets, but no one would have heard of them, hence the Dead Sea Scrolls. An old archaeologist is attempting to find and dig up 4 hidden Sumerian amulets buried around the world. These amulets were supposed to be well hidden so no one would find them and dig them up, except for maybe the one that had four markers by it! One was placed in a nuclear test site because as a test site it has a lack of air. I didn't quite grasp that one, nor did I even try to figure out how the ancient Sumerians would know this would be a nuclear test site. Now after these amulets are dug up, a beam of light (1980's special effects) shoots out up to the sky and causes destruction. Why this old archaeologist and his team is doing this is uncertain, the old man believes it may cure his cancer, but the reasoning behind the madness is uncertain. The movie has a subplot at a highly guarded military weather center, which really doesn't play much of a role, other than eat up some time and fill in some plot points. The lead actor, Jeremy London, runs around acting and looking like Brenden Fraser's clone. His inability to act is seen after the first light beam shines up to the sky and he says ""Oh my God"" with a severe lack of emotion. The movie looks like it was made for TV. It has no bad language, sexual scenes or innuendos, or nudity. Not even a naked statue of Ishtar.
