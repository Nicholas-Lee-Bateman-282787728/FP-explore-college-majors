Allen ""meeko_2003""","[13, 14]","One of television's greatest comedy teams, George Burns and Gracie Allen, take center stage in this video showcasing two episodes from their show's first season. Gracie is genius as her ditzy and naive alter-ego. Her oblivious nature makes her not only funny, but extremely likable as well. George Burns plays a great straight man for her zany schemes, as well as delivering witty monologues between scenes.  Bea Benaderet (who would latter portray Cousin Pearl on ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Betty Rubble on ""The Flintstones"") also puts in a great performance as Blanch Morton, Gracie's best friend and neighbor. Each episode of the tape not only showcases the actor's talent, but also the show's great irreverence, with George always breaking the ""fourth wall"" and popping in and out of scenes unnoticed by the characters performing in them. I would defiantly recommend these shows to anyone looking for some real comedy.",5,An Overlooked Gem of Early TV,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,926,"['One', 'television', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'teams', 'George', 'Burns', 'Gracie', 'Allen', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'video', 'showcasing', 'two', 'episodes', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'Gracie', 'genius', 'ditzy', 'naive', 'alter-ego', 'oblivious', 'nature', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'extremely', 'likable', 'as', 'well', 'George', 'Burns', 'great', 'straight', 'man', 'zany', 'schemes', 'as', 'well', 'delivering', 'witty', 'monologues', 'scenes', 'Bea', 'Benaderet', 'who', 'would', 'latter', 'portray', 'Cousin', 'Pearl', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Betty', 'Rubble', 'Flintstones', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'Blanch', 'Morton', 'Gracie', 'best', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'episode', 'tape', 'not', 'only', 'actor', 'talent', 'also', 'show', 'great', 'irreverence', 'George', 'always', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'popping', 'scenes', 'unnoticed', 'characters', 'performing', 'would', 'defiantly', 'recommend', 'shows', 'anyone', 'looking', 'real', 'comedy']",N/A

They rolled off her tongue as if she really believed it herself.It is said to be digitally remastered. The clarity is very good quality considering it is 1950. The sound, well that part they forgot to remaster, it has to be high to hear what they are saying sometimes.As for Burns, his lines were about half good jokes and the delivery of his was not that great. Good thing he was an excellent writer.For the bad news... this particular one, there are only two episodes. The third didn't make it on the disk and the first episode was copied twice. So the first and third episode are the same.

Rivers,"[2, 2]","Wonderfully surreal, ""The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"" (which ran on CBS during the 1950s) moves at a relaxed, vaudevillian rhythm that differs from most television comedies. This Delta release offers four early kinescopes in reasonably good quality. Along with George and Gracie's timeless routines, you also get Bill Goodwin's contrived plugs for Carnation Evaporated Milk.
