At the time I first saw this program, I was lost, depressed, afraid and at the end of my rope.  I had spent 39 years of my life struggling to find a balance of success, happiness and fulfillment and felt like I was failing utterly at all three.  I was HUNGRY for something that really made sense AND that really WORKED.  One night, when I was lying awake in bed with nothing to do, I stumbled on this program on PBS ... I KNEW something important had happened.I could tell you how amazing the ideas are in this program and what I think they mean ... but what I want to tell you is something a lot more important.  I USED what I learned here ... and I built on it ... I took what Dr. Dyer offered here, went out and learned more, applied what I learned in my life ... changed how I looked at life and how I LIVED life ... day by day ... and I have completely changed my life, for the better.  Then, I was lost, lonely, unhappy, afraid ... not any more.  The last three years of my life have been the happiest, most fulfilling most successful I have ever experienced.  And THIS program is where it began for me.  THIS is where it started.  Since viewing this program, I have read many other books by Dr. Dyer and others ... viewed and listened to a lot of other programs ... made HUGE changes to my life ... inside and outside ... and SO much has changed and it's ALL for the better.  I am now happy, loved, in love, successful, fulfilled, filled with peace and confidence ... I AM where I once thought I never could be.  And I can tell you that THIS program is where it began for me.  I remember it QUITE clearly.  THIS is where it all started.I posted this review largely in response to the person who wrote a rather scathing review of this program and gave it one star.  Here is my response.  A) No self help material ever written can be used by everyone, without regard to where they are in life.  Each of us has to find the material suited for who we are and where we are in our journey.  Clearly, this wasn't what this person needed.  B) I studied, researched and applied what I learned here ... I WORKED at it ... I didn't just read it and toss it aside.  I TRIED it ... I LIVED it ... and it HAS changed my life completely.  YOU, as a potential viewer, have to decide which of these two assessments speaks to YOU.  If this sounds like something you couldn't possibly benefit from ... maybe you're right.  All I can tell you is my personal experience ... I viewed it ... dug into it ... studied it in depth ... researched it for 2 years ... applied it for 4 years ... added to it ... LIVED IT ... and my life is completely changed.Decide for yourself.  :)",5,The beginning of an AMAZING Journey,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2915,"['first', 'viewed', 'material', 'How', 'Get', 'What', 'Really', 'Really', 'Really', 'Really', 'Want', 'back', '2002', 'now', 'four', 'years', 'later', '2006', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'learned', 'material', 'inspiration', 'gained', 'completely', 'changed', 'life', 'time', 'first', 'saw', 'program', 'was', 'lost', 'depressed', 'afraid', 'end', 'rope', 'had', 'spent', '39', 'years', 'life', 'struggling', 'find', 'balance', 'success', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'felt', 'was', 'failing', 'utterly', 'three', 'was', 'HUNGRY', 'something', 'really', 'made', 'sense', 'really', 'WORKED', 'One', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'lying', 'awake', 'bed', 'nothing', 'do', 'stumbled', 'program', 'PBS', 'KNEW', 'something', 'important', 'had', 'happened.I', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'amazing', 'ideas', 'are', 'program', 'what', 'think', 'mean', 'what', 'want', 'tell', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'important', 'USED', 'what', 'learned', 'here', 'built', 'took', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Dyer', 'offered', 'here', 'went', 'learned', 'more', 'applied', 'what', 'learned', 'life', 'changed', 'how', 'looked', 'life', 'how', 'LIVED', 'life', 'day', 'day', 'have', 'completely', 'changed', 'life', 'better', 'Then', 'was', 'lost', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'afraid', 'not', 'more', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'happiest', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'most', 'successful', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'THIS', 'program', 'where', 'began', 'THIS', 'where', 'started', 'viewing', 'program', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'other', 'books', 'Dr.', 'Dyer', 'others', 'viewed', 'listened', 'lot', 'other', 'programs', 'made', 'HUGE', 'changes', 'life', 'inside', 'outside', 'SO', 'much', 'changed', 'ALL', 'better', 'am', 'now', 'happy', 'loved', 'love', 'successful', 'fulfilled', 'filled', 'peace', 'confidence', 'AM', 'where', 'once', 'thought', 'never', 'could', 'be', 'can', 'tell', 'THIS', 'program', 'where', 'began', 'remember', 'QUITE', 'clearly', 'THIS', 'where', 'started.I', 'posted', 'review', 'largely', 'response', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'rather', 'scathing', 'review', 'program', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'Here', 'response', 'self', 'help', 'material', 'ever', 'written', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'everyone', 'regard', 'where', 'are', 'life', 'find', 'material', 'suited', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'journey', 'Clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'person', 'needed', 'B', 'studied', 'researched', 'applied', 'what', 'learned', 'here', 'WORKED', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'read', 'toss', 'aside', 'TRIED', 'LIVED', 'HAS', 'changed', 'life', 'completely', 'YOU', 'potential', 'viewer', 'have', 'decide', 'two', 'assessments', 'YOU', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'benefit', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'right', 'can', 'tell', 'personal', 'experience', 'viewed', 'studied', 'depth', 'researched', '2', 'years', 'applied', '4', 'years', 'added', 'IT', 'life', 'completely', 'changed.Decide']",N/A

550238,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00004TBG7,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[124, 129]","On my bedside table a tiny smooth stone sits quietly. The word ""Believe"" is engraved in the beautiful mustard colored stone. When I see this stone I remember to believe in the future and to have faith in my dreams.To me, Wayne Dyer's words are like smooth stones that ""speak out"" wisdom. I want to put them all in the pocket of my soul and carry them with me wherever I go. The wisdom is then ready for me to toss into the pool of my own consciousness. The ripples can then move through my life and awaken my soul to move towards enlightenment.In the first video: ""How To Get What You Really, Really, Really, Really Want,"" you will literally be on the edge of your seat hanging on every word you are hearing. His presence, even on video, is very powerful and awakens something deep inside of you. The craving for truth can be a very powerful emotion which draws us to those who have truth. Wayne has researched truth through the ages and speaks confidently from a wealth of knowledge and personal experience.Everyone wants to find meaning in life and Wayne explains how we can get what we want by first wishing, then desiring (asking). We then move to a point where we use our ""will"" to show ""intention."" In the final stage we develop a passion for life and for our purpose. We simply become what we think we can become.In this first video I felt that I was a student who was ready to learn and the teacher appeared! You will feel inspired by this wonderful journey of spiritual discovery.In the second video: ""Improve Your Life Using The Wisdom Of The Ages,"" Wayne explains how ""highly functioning"" individuals are too busy ""being"" to worry about what people think of them. They are not controlled by the opinion of others.I was so captivated by his every word. He explained the philosophy of how people through the ages have all believed in a world beyond the physical and that they have felt spiritually connected to this world.Wayne also gives an introduction to his book: ""Wisdom of the Ages: 60 days to Enlightenment."" This is a book filled with quotes and passages from 60 ""masters"" of life. They did what they loved and loved what they did. They chose to advance confidently in the direction of their own dreams. They lived their lives by cultivating their own garden. They had no concept of failure and lived their lives with enthusiasm. These teachers had profound wisdom to share and Wayne Dyer researched their lives and their writings and then wrote a message to us about what he though they would want us to know in this day and age. He also tells a wonderful fable about a cat in this video.Do you want to feel blissful in your life? Is there someone in your life who causes you to react in a negative way? Do you want to find the path to peace? As you walk the path of enlightenment with Wayne Dyer, pick up the smooth stones of wisdom along the way. Put them in your pocket. You never know when you might need some inspiration once you get back to walking your own path in life.It has always been my theory that when you seek out truth and find it, you will know it for what it is.~The Rebecca Review",5,The Wisdom of the Ages for today!,983232000,"02 27, 2001",2001,3117,"['bedside', 'table', 'tiny', 'smooth', 'stone', 'quietly', 'word', 'Believe', 'engraved', 'beautiful', 'mustard', 'colored', 'stone', 'When', 'see', 'stone', 'remember', 'believe', 'future', 'have', 'faith', 'dreams.To', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'words', 'are', 'smooth', 'stones', 'speak', 'out', 'wisdom', 'want', 'put', 'pocket', 'soul', 'carry', 'wherever', 'go', 'wisdom', 'then', 'ready', 'toss', 'pool', 'own', 'consciousness', 'ripples', 'can', 'then', 'move', 'life', 'awaken', 'soul', 'move', 'towards', 'first', 'video', 'How', 'Get', 'What', 'Really', 'Really', 'Really', 'Really', 'Want', 'will', 'literally', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'hanging', 'word', 'are', 'hearing', 'presence', 'even', 'video', 'very', 'powerful', 'something', 'deep', 'inside', 'craving', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'who', 'have', 'truth', 'Wayne', 'researched', 'truth', 'ages', 'speaks', 'confidently', 'wealth', 'knowledge', 'personal', 'experience.Everyone', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'Wayne', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'first', 'wishing', 'then', 'desiring', 'asking', 'then', 'move', 'point', 'where', 'use', 'will', 'show', 'intention', 'final', 'stage', 'develop', 'passion', 'life', 'purpose', 'simply', 'become', 'what', 'think', 'can', 'become.In', 'first', 'video', 'felt', 'was', 'student', 'who', 'was', 'ready', 'learn', 'teacher', 'appeared', 'will', 'feel', 'inspired', 'wonderful', 'journey', 'spiritual', 'discovery.In', 'second', 'video', 'Improve', 'Your', 'Life', 'Using', 'Wisdom', 'Ages', 'Wayne', 'how', 'highly', 'functioning', 'individuals', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'being', 'worry', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'not', 'controlled', 'opinion', 'others.I', 'was', 'so', 'captivated', 'word', 'explained', 'philosophy', 'how', 'people', 'ages', 'have', 'believed', 'world', 'physical', 'have', 'felt', 'spiritually', 'connected', 'world.Wayne', 'also', 'introduction', 'book', 'Wisdom', 'Ages', '60', 'days', 'Enlightenment', 'book', 'filled', 'quotes', 'passages', '60', 'masters', 'life', 'did', 'what', 'loved', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'chose', 'advance', 'confidently', 'direction', 'own', 'dreams', 'lived', 'lives', 'cultivating', 'own', 'garden', 'had', 'concept', 'failure', 'lived', 'lives', 'enthusiasm', 'teachers', 'had', 'profound', 'wisdom', 'share', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'researched', 'lives', 'writings', 'then', 'wrote', 'message', 'what', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'day', 'age', 'also', 'wonderful', 'fable', 'cat', 'video.Do', 'want', 'feel', 'blissful', 'life', 'there', 'someone', 'life', 'who', 'react', 'negative', 'way', 'Do', 'want', 'find', 'path', 'peace', 'walk', 'path', 'enlightenment', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'pick', 'up', 'smooth', 'stones', 'wisdom', 'way', 'Put', 'pocket', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'might', 'need', 'inspiration', 'once', 'get', 'back', 'walking', 'own', 'path', 'life.It', 'always', 'been', 'theory', 'when', 'seek', 'out', 'truth', 'find', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
