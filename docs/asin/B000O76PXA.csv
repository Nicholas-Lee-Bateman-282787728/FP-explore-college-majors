1062494,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,B000O76PXA,AC,"[1, 1]","After watching this film, and then learning that it had been awarded the Jury Prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, I was surprised -- not because it didn't deserve such an award, but that such an award had ever been given to something so bleak, let alone 20 years ago (and the award seems to have garnered new 'respect', in my eyes, as a result).Knowing just what to say, in a review of this film, leaves me wishing anew for a non-existent feature of Amazon that I wish existed -- that we were allowed a limited number of special 'flags', so to speak, as a kind of 'highlighted substitution redirect' of sorts, when it comes to a few items for which someone else has expressed what we would want to say...The following review is 'spot on', in my opinion --http://www.amazon.com/review/R105LNEP4ZMY6P/And the succinct comments conveyed in the following review are also relevant, when it comes to my 'take' on the film --http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2ISFSOZRRT2/The only things I would add to what is communicated in those reviews are --1) Various blurbs on the cover art of the DVD 'packaging' of the film, and miscellaneous reviewers online, have somehow stated that this film is ""very funny"", ""brimming with good humor"", etc. -- and nothing could be further from the truth (it truly baffles me as to how those comments were made, let alone that they were chosen to 'market' the film, when it comes to the inclusion of such on its cover art, etc.). While there are initially a few laughs in the beginning, before one understands the true nature and 'scope' of what is taking place in the film, the overall 'tone' of the film is that of a deeply moving, intense look at something emotionally difficult, and for me, given the depth of my compassion, the painful realities associated with this realistic 'look at' poverty, when combined with the great performances by the actors in this film, and the emotional gravity and 'tenor' of the subject matter -- and the entire production, ended up making this a difficult film for me to watch.2) The beginning of this film, in particular, involves some rapidly spoken dialogue that is delivered with relatively 'thick' Scouse accents, and is riddled with idioms -- as good as I am with various 'difficult' English accents, let alone if/when conveyed in rapid speech, I was left largely 'adrift', when it came to that part of the film, and it's one of the few English language -based movie-watching series of moments when I would have benefited from subtitles (and it is my understanding that a later release of this film includes such).As a side note, regarding the accent ---------------------------------------Scouse is notable in some circumstances for a fast, highly accented manner of speech, with a range of rising and falling tones not typical of most of northern England. [...]Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects [...]Many natives of northern Europe, and especially the Scandinavian region, have suggested that scousers 'sound like they sing when they talk' due to the flowing rhythm and pitch.-------------------------------------Lastly, a primary supporting actor in this film is Eric Tomlinson (stage name Ricky Tomlinson), who will be familiar to (among others) fans of the UK drama series ""Cracker"" (a UK series that more than a few Americans have 'found their way to').This was a gripping film, and I would recommend it, but would also recommend that one be 'in the right frame of mind' to 'take in' something that is bleak, and is a reminder of the difficult lives lived by so many (not that such reminders are not 'needed' -- but for those with empathy and compassion, these can be rather painful films to watch -- let alone, to have 'echoing' in your mind, long after viewing such).  I didn't have the luxury of 'being prepared' for the type of viewing experience this film 'represents' -- I mistakenly believed the blurbs (on the cover art) which stated that the film was funny -- and got a bit 'blindsided' by the intensity and emotional depth of the film.",5,"Powerful, and at times, difficult to watch...",1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,4047,"['watching', 'film', 'then', 'learning', 'had', 'been', 'awarded', 'Jury', 'Prize', '1993', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'surprised', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'such', 'award', 'award', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'given', 'something', 'so', 'bleak', 'let', 'alone', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'award', 'have', 'garnered', 'new', ""'respect"", 'eyes', 'result', '.Knowing', 'just', 'what', 'say', 'review', 'film', 'wishing', 'anew', 'non-existent', 'feature', 'Amazon', 'wish', 'existed', 'were', 'allowed', 'limited', 'number', 'special', ""'flags"", 'speak', 'kind', ""'highlighted"", 'substitution', 'redirect', 'sorts', 'when', 'few', 'items', 'someone', 'else', 'expressed', 'what', 'would', 'want', 'say', 'following', 'review', ""'spot"", 'opinion', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/review/R105LNEP4ZMY6P/And', 'succinct', 'comments', 'conveyed', 'following', 'review', 'are', 'also', 'relevant', 'when', ""'take"", 'film', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/review/R2D2ISFSOZRRT2/The', 'only', 'things', 'would', 'add', 'what', 'communicated', 'reviews', 'are', '1', 'Various', 'blurbs', 'cover', 'art', 'DVD', ""'packaging"", 'film', 'miscellaneous', 'reviewers', 'online', 'have', 'somehow', 'stated', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'brimming', 'good', 'humor', 'etc', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'truly', 'how', 'comments', 'were', 'made', 'let', 'alone', 'were', 'chosen', ""'market"", 'film', 'when', 'inclusion', 'such', 'cover', 'art', 'etc.', 'are', 'initially', 'few', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'one', 'true', 'nature', ""'scope"", 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'film', 'overall', ""'tone"", 'film', 'deeply', 'moving', 'intense', 'look', 'something', 'emotionally', 'difficult', 'given', 'depth', 'compassion', 'painful', 'realities', 'associated', 'realistic', ""'look"", 'poverty', 'when', 'combined', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'film', 'emotional', 'gravity', ""'tenor"", 'subject', 'matter', 'entire', 'production', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch.2', 'beginning', 'film', 'particular', 'rapidly', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'relatively', ""'thick"", 'Scouse', 'accents', 'riddled', 'idioms', 'as', 'good', 'am', 'various', ""'difficult"", 'English', 'accents', 'let', 'alone', 'if/when', 'conveyed', 'rapid', 'speech', 'was', 'left', 'largely', ""'adrift"", 'when', 'came', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'English', 'language', '-based', 'movie-watching', 'series', 'moments', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'subtitles', 'understanding', 'later', 'release', 'film', 'such', '.As', 'side', 'note', 'regarding', 'accent', '-Scouse', 'notable', 'circumstances', 'fast', 'highly', 'accented', 'manner', 'speech', 'range', 'rising', 'falling', 'tones', 'not', 'typical', 'most', 'northern', 'England', '[', ']', 'Scouse', 'highly', 'distinguishable', 'other', 'English', 'dialects', '[', ']', 'Many', 'natives', 'northern', 'Europe', 'especially', 'Scandinavian', 'region', 'have', 'suggested', 'scousers', ""'sound"", 'sing', 'when', 'talk', 'due', 'flowing', 'rhythm', 'pitch.', '-Lastly', 'primary', 'supporting', 'actor', 'film', 'Eric', 'Tomlinson', 'stage', 'name', 'Ricky', 'Tomlinson', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'others', 'fans', 'UK', 'drama', 'series', 'Cracker', 'UK', 'series', 'more', 'few', 'Americans', 'have', ""'found"", 'way', '.This', 'was', 'gripping', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'one', 'be', ""'in"", 'right', 'frame', 'mind', ""'take"", 'something', 'bleak', 'reminder', 'difficult', 'lives', 'lived', 'so', 'many', 'not', 'such', 'reminders', 'are', 'not', ""'needed"", 'empathy', 'compassion', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'painful', 'films', 'watch', 'let', 'alone', 'have', ""'echoing"", 'mind', 'long', 'viewing', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', ""'being"", 'prepared', 'type', 'viewing', 'experience', 'film', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'blurbs', 'cover', 'art', 'stated', 'film', 'was', 'funny', 'got', 'bit', ""'blindsided"", 'intensity', 'emotional', 'depth', 'film']",N/A
1062495,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000O76PXA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","""Raining Stones"" is one of those films that initially looks like it is going to be painful to watch. The despair of the blue-collar English, working hard to make ends meet, the idea that religion is a part of the family, and a proud father willing to do anything for his daughter feels more like a Mike Leigh film than a Loach drama, but Loach stands up and demonstrates his ability to produce amazing cinema. It is a scene we have seen many times before, a father down on his luck with his family and life does anything (sewage, bounce, and sheep stealing) to provide a brand new dress for his daughter's first Communion. He is determined to give his daughter a memory she will always cherish, but he is also determined to prove his worth to his entire family. This is where the drama and real humanity of all Loach's characters begin to shine.This didn't initially seem like a film worth watching, hesitantly I worried this would be one of those over dramatic family dramas that pulled everything out of you only to leave you bored, desensitized, and counting the final minutes - within the first ten minutes of Loach's film, I knew that I was wrong. To begin, our main protagonist, completely full of flaws, but boiling over with pride, captures your attention. Our patriarch, Bob (played delicately by Bruce Jones), is immediately recognizable and relatable. Loach gives him that blue-collar, everyman appeal that isn't sugar-coated or fabricated. The instances may seem episodic at times, but what happens to Bob is real. Add to this mix his devotion to the Catholic faith, and we have a powerfully well-rounded character that leads us in and out of difficult times. With Bob is his conscious, or voice of future, the unemployed Tommy creates this very sad world, but it isn't bleak. Jobs are found, dresses are ordered, and money is used - it is the destination with this film, not the journey. Bruce Jones' ability to control each scene, whether it is getting a bitter or going door to door searching for work, he is someone that we stand proudly next to. Loach has crafted a man that screams sympathy. During every moment of this film, we root for Bob, we cheer when he finds work, and each downfall we feel as well. That is a great accomplishment as both a director and an actor if each scene can bring out such emotion.Not only is the acting Oscar worthy, but Loach's (with Jim Allen) story is outstanding. From that opening scene, he pulls you into this world that feels real, that seems plausible, that demonstrates the struggle without being vulgar or gross. It is a normal town, these are trying times, Bob wants to provide for his family, and what he goes through to accomplish this is breathtaking. As Loach introduces religion into this story, a very vital element to this film, it seems only natural that when in trouble, when you feel like you can turn to nobody, the Church is there, God is there, your local priest is there to talk you through the trouble. It isn't overbearing, it isn't preachy, it is a way of life for these characters and Loach doesn't force this down our throats. It is again, this feeling of realism that makes ""Raining Stones"" stand above other films of this nature. If there were a complaint about this film, it would be the sense of timing with Bob. In one moment he has no money, in another he is suddenly debt ridden. It happens rather quickly in a 90-minute film. Also, would a man with no money to his name really spend that much on beer during the week - wouldn't he save it? Or was this Loach's commentary on the blue-collar worker? Never enough money for things that count, but plenty of time for beer and religion. An odd twist...Overall, this was an impressive film from the beginning all the way to the final moment that put this smile on your face. It was dramatic, it was grounded, and it was passionate for all the right reasons. Loach has proved himself as a director with ""Raining Stones"", and this is a perfect example of a ""don't judge"" cover. Again, this wouldn't have been a typical film for me, but what came out of the DVD player was a cinematic dinner. Everything was in place, and you were satisfied by the end. I can only recommend this film to everyone excited about a low-budget, no CGI, drama that shows humanity at its best and worst. It will make you think, make you smile, and make you understand the struggles of life.Watch this film!Grade: **** 1/2 out of *****",4,Where Unemployment Hurts the Most...,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,4439,"['Raining', 'Stones', 'one', 'films', 'initially', 'going', 'be', 'painful', 'watch', 'despair', 'blue-collar', 'English', 'working', 'hard', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'idea', 'religion', 'part', 'family', 'proud', 'father', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'daughter', 'feels', 'more', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'film', 'Loach', 'drama', 'Loach', 'up', 'ability', 'produce', 'amazing', 'cinema', 'scene', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'father', 'down', 'luck', 'family', 'life', 'anything', 'sewage', 'bounce', 'sheep', 'stealing', 'provide', 'brand', 'new', 'dress', 'daughter', 'first', 'Communion', 'determined', 'give', 'daughter', 'memory', 'will', 'always', 'cherish', 'also', 'determined', 'prove', 'worth', 'entire', 'family', 'where', 'drama', 'real', 'humanity', 'Loach', 'characters', 'begin', 'shine.This', 'did', ""n't"", 'initially', 'seem', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'hesitantly', 'worried', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'dramatic', 'family', 'dramas', 'pulled', 'everything', 'only', 'leave', 'bored', 'desensitized', 'counting', 'final', 'minutes', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Loach', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong', 'begin', 'main', 'protagonist', 'completely', 'full', 'flaws', 'boiling', 'over', 'pride', 'attention', 'patriarch', 'Bob', 'played', 'delicately', 'Bruce', 'Jones', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'relatable', 'Loach', 'blue-collar', 'everyman', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'sugar-coated', 'fabricated', 'instances', 'may', 'seem', 'episodic', 'times', 'what', 'Bob', 'real', 'Add', 'mix', 'devotion', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'have', 'powerfully', 'well-rounded', 'character', 'difficult', 'times', 'Bob', 'conscious', 'voice', 'future', 'unemployed', 'Tommy', 'very', 'sad', 'world', ""n't"", 'bleak', 'Jobs', 'are', 'found', 'dresses', 'are', 'ordered', 'money', 'used', 'destination', 'film', 'not', 'journey', 'Bruce', 'Jones', 'ability', 'control', 'scene', 'getting', 'bitter', 'going', 'door', 'door', 'searching', 'work', 'someone', 'stand', 'proudly', 'next', 'Loach', 'crafted', 'man', 'sympathy', 'moment', 'film', 'root', 'Bob', 'cheer', 'when', 'work', 'downfall', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'director', 'actor', 'scene', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'such', 'only', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Loach', 'Jim', 'Allen', 'story', 'outstanding', 'opening', 'scene', 'world', 'real', 'plausible', 'struggle', 'being', 'vulgar', 'gross', 'normal', 'town', 'are', 'trying', 'times', 'Bob', 'provide', 'family', 'what', 'accomplish', 'breathtaking', 'Loach', 'religion', 'story', 'very', 'vital', 'element', 'film', 'only', 'natural', 'when', 'trouble', 'when', 'feel', 'can', 'turn', 'nobody', 'Church', 'there', 'God', 'there', 'local', 'priest', 'there', 'talk', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'overbearing', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'way', 'life', 'characters', 'Loach', ""n't"", 'force', 'down', 'throats', 'again', 'feeling', 'realism', 'Raining', 'Stones', 'stand', 'other', 'films', 'nature', 'were', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'sense', 'timing', 'Bob', 'one', 'moment', 'money', 'suddenly', 'debt', 'ridden', 'rather', 'quickly', '90-minute', 'film', 'Also', 'would', 'man', 'money', 'name', 'really', 'spend', 'that', 'much', 'beer', 'week', 'would', ""n't"", 'save', 'was', 'Loach', 'commentary', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'Never', 'enough', 'money', 'things', 'count', 'plenty', 'time', 'beer', 'religion', 'odd', 'twist', 'Overall', 'was', 'impressive', 'film', 'beginning', 'way', 'final', 'moment', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'was', 'dramatic', 'was', 'grounded', 'was', 'passionate', 'right', 'reasons', 'Loach', 'proved', 'director', 'Raining', 'Stones', 'perfect', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'cover', 'Again', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'typical', 'film', 'what', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'cinematic', 'dinner', 'Everything', 'was', 'place', 'were', 'satisfied', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'excited', 'low-budget', 'CGI', 'drama', 'humanity', 'best', 'worst', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'make', 'smile', 'make', 'understand', 'struggles', 'life.Watch', 'film', 'Grade', '****', '1/2', '*****']",N/A
1062496,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B000O76PXA,Brian,"[2, 2]","A few minor technical differences are apparent between the two Lorber releases of Ken Loach's ('My Name Is Joe,' 'The Navigators') gut-wrenching 1993 social drama 'Raining Stones.'  First, the 1999 Fox-Lorber/Winstar disc features a non-anamorphic 1.66:1 widescreen picture without subtitles while the 2007 Koch-Lorber re-issue is anamorphic widescreen (similar aspect ratio) with subtitles.  As often happens during reformatting for 16x9 consumption a small amount of information at the top and bottom of the screen is sacrificed.  Other than that the prints look just about identical.  The film was shot on fairly grainy 35mm stock (which enhances its documentary-like feel), so if the newer edition has been restored to any significant degree it isn't readily noticeable.  As far as extras, the former contains a couple pages of production credits plus filmographies of three cast members and the director which don't appear on the latter, although the latter includes a theatrical trailer absent from the former.  While none of these incidentals seems to be a deal-breaker, I imagine the most valuable overall contribution is the 2007 version's addition of subtitles.  A quick note about the movie itself:  I read several blurbs by critics (including the Amazon reviewer) hailing RS as a laugh riot.  It is not.  While there are some warm moments amidst the tears and pain, it is a grim and at times devastating depiction of life in a society where jobs-- by whatever mechanisms one chooses to blame-- are supplanted by handouts.
