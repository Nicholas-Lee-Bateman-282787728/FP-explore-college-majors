1586335,A1VRVLZG5SQMDI,B0096RC57O,Alex S,"[10, 11]","Please note that I am a TV on DVD reviewer and base the following on actually seeing the episodes rather than speculation regarding the release. Those of you who are interested in my other reviews are welcome to visit my site at [...]Shout Factory's December 4, 2012 release of the DVD set of ""Hazel"" S4 is the latest example of Shout earning deity status among hard-core sofa spuds for releasing sets of previously abandoned shows every few months.This classic '60s sitcom revolved around the titular character, who was a live-in maid/busybody for successful attorney George Baxter and his nuclear family. Plots typically involved either Hazel, who was played by legendary actress Shirley Booth, undermining ""Mr. B's"" authority, trying to manipulate him, or interfering in the lives of her friends and neighbors.Much of the humor came from Hazel's common sense and street smarts succeeding where Mr. B's ""book learnin'"" failed.The nice thing about the fourth season was that the overall friendly disputes between Hazel and Mr. B. had toned down significantly since the more rancorous, but highly entertaining, first season.One episode had Hazel surprisingly obey Mr. B's order to only respond ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""maybe"" if the visiting governor of their state asked her a question. Similarly, the Thanksgiving episode included a scene in which Hazel encouraged Mr. B. to eat a piece of pie in contrast to scenes from earlier seasons in which she vigorously and stubbornly denied him sweets.Similarly, the well done Christmas episode had Hazel gently encouraging Mr. B. to buy his wife Dorothy a relatively inexpensive gift in response to his declared war on the commercial aspects of the holiday. First season Hazel would have likely charged an expensive gift to the Baxter account and shamed her employer into accepting that outcome.On the other side, Mr. B. was less harsh regarding Hazel and seemed more sensitive to her feelings.This ""kinder gentler"" tone helped make S4 very tasty television comfort food. Like a well-made macaroni-and-cheese, each episode satisfied without making an unduly strong impression.These episodes also offer a nice reminder of the ""good old days"" when families seemed to get along better than they do now, people sat down for dinner together, neighborhoods were real communities, and people were not isolated in the forms of constantly being glued to their cell phones, iPods, iPads, or other electronic devices.One of the better of a good lot of episodes had Hazel getting Mr. B. provide the family's wonderfully daffy and aristocratic neighbors badly needed financial planning. Mayhem regarding missing bearer bonds was very amusing.Another especially good episode had Hazel and lady of the house Dorothy team up to convince Mr. B. to pay to have the kitchen remodeled. Their chosen technique was much more subtle than the (perhaps literal) sledgehammer approach that Hazel likely would have used in the first season.Further, S4 Mr. B. was a very good sport. S1 Mr. B. likely would have drawn the line at buying a new toaster.It is worth noting as well that this was the final season in which Hazel worked for George and Dorothy Baxter. Those unfamiliar with the show must wait until Shout releases S5 to learn of the new format.Shout's extras for the S4 set are entertaining vintage promos for the series.",5,Maid to Perfection,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3339,"['Please', 'note', 'am', 'TV', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'base', 'following', 'actually', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'rather', 'speculation', 'regarding', 'release', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'welcome', 'visit', 'site', '[', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'December', '4', '2012', 'release', 'DVD', 'set', 'Hazel', 'S4', 'latest', 'example', 'Shout', 'earning', 'deity', 'status', 'hard-core', 'sofa', 'spuds', 'releasing', 'sets', 'previously', 'abandoned', 'shows', 'few', 'months.This', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'revolved', 'titular', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'live-in', 'maid/busybody', 'successful', 'attorney', 'George', 'Baxter', 'nuclear', 'family', 'Plots', 'typically', 'involved', 'Hazel', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'legendary', 'actress', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'undermining', 'Mr.', 'B', 'authority', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'interfering', 'lives', 'friends', 'neighbors.Much', 'humor', 'came', 'Hazel', 'common', 'sense', 'street', 'smarts', 'succeeding', 'where', 'Mr.', 'B', 'book', 'learnin', 'failed.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'overall', 'friendly', 'disputes', 'Hazel', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'had', 'toned', 'down', 'significantly', 'more', 'rancorous', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'first', 'season.One', 'episode', 'had', 'Hazel', 'surprisingly', 'Mr.', 'B', 'order', 'only', 'respond', 'yes', 'maybe', 'visiting', 'governor', 'state', 'asked', 'question', 'Similarly', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'included', 'scene', 'Hazel', 'encouraged', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'eat', 'piece', 'pie', 'contrast', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'vigorously', 'stubbornly', 'denied', 'sweets.Similarly', 'well', 'done', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'had', 'Hazel', 'gently', 'encouraging', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'buy', 'wife', 'Dorothy', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', 'gift', 'response', 'declared', 'war', 'commercial', 'aspects', 'holiday', 'First', 'season', 'Hazel', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'charged', 'expensive', 'gift', 'Baxter', 'account', 'shamed', 'employer', 'accepting', 'outcome.On', 'other', 'side', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'was', 'less', 'harsh', 'regarding', 'Hazel', 'seemed', 'more', 'sensitive', 'feelings.This', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'tone', 'helped', 'make', 'S4', 'very', 'tasty', 'television', 'comfort', 'food', 'well-made', 'macaroni-and-cheese', 'episode', 'satisfied', 'making', 'unduly', 'strong', 'impression.These', 'episodes', 'also', 'offer', 'nice', 'reminder', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'families', 'seemed', 'get', 'along', 'better', 'do', 'now', 'people', 'sat', 'down', 'dinner', 'together', 'neighborhoods', 'were', 'real', 'communities', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'isolated', 'forms', 'constantly', 'being', 'glued', 'cell', 'phones', 'iPods', 'iPads', 'other', 'electronic', 'devices.One', 'better', 'good', 'lot', 'episodes', 'had', 'Hazel', 'getting', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'provide', 'family', 'wonderfully', 'daffy', 'aristocratic', 'neighbors', 'badly', 'needed', 'financial', 'planning', 'Mayhem', 'regarding', 'missing', 'bearer', 'bonds', 'was', 'very', 'amusing.Another', 'especially', 'good', 'episode', 'had', 'Hazel', 'lady', 'house', 'Dorothy', 'team', 'up', 'convince', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'pay', 'have', 'kitchen', 'remodeled', 'chosen', 'technique', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'perhaps', 'literal', 'sledgehammer', 'approach', 'Hazel', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'first', 'season.Further', 'S4', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'sport', 'S1', 'Mr.', 'B.', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'drawn', 'line', 'buying', 'new', 'toaster.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'Hazel', 'worked', 'George', 'Dorothy', 'Baxter', 'unfamiliar', 'show', 'must', 'wait', 'Shout', 'S5', 'learn', 'new', 'format.Shout', 'extras', 'S4', 'set', 'are', 'entertaining', 'vintage', 'promos', 'series']",Hazel: Season 4

Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of &#34;Mr. B&#34; the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as &#34;Sport,&#34; who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode.

They've gifted us with THREE sets this calendar year (and I hope the final one is released sometime early in 2013), and I've enjoyed each one immensely. Like the old saying goes ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". Bear in mind, these are not new digitally-remastered transfers taken from the original film elements. Shout had to make due with video masters likely made in the 1980s, so the picture quality is not of Hi-Def Bluray quality here. Still, I'd rather have these than nothing at all.

The quality on this season 4 set is really not that bad. A few of the episodes seemed to suffer from a bit of color fade and I believe one of the episodes may have been an edited down version, I'm not sure.

As a classic TV collector, I really appreciate them taking the rights for ""Hazel"" and ""Police Woman"" and running with it. They've been especially quick with their rapid-fire releases of Seasons 2, 3 and 4 of ""Hazel""...and for that, I can't thank them enough.This DVD set does contain a bonus feature -- the original pre-production booklet pushed to potential sponsors for the program before its 1961 debut is contained on the 4th and final disc.Others have given reviews for Season 4 and I can't really add much to what has been written. It was my impression, watching Season 4 unfold on my DVD player, that the series was well past its prime by the time Season 4 started. The first six episodes were quite weak...not what any series would want at the beginning of a new season, especially with tough time slot competition that included national phenomenon ""Peyton Place"".  I didn't really laugh a lot until I got to episode 7. ""Hazel"" did pick up steam as the season progressed but perhaps I had become accustomed to Hazel and her machinations during this season but it just didn't seem as good as the other seasons. That may be why NBC decided to cancel the series after this season; it had run its course and it was increasingly difficult to keep the series fresh. The inclusion of Harry Noll and his wife as semi-regulars was more annyoying than anything else; I'd have rather seen more of the Sunshine Girls and the Johnsons but those supporting characters have only occasional glimpses here. There IS more of Harvey Griffin and his blustery nature...which was a good thing.That is not to say that Hazel, herself, had changed. She was still the hard-headed butt-insky that we all loved, getting herself into all sorts of messes. And some of the episodes were chucklers. Season 4, though, had more than its share of clunkers, especially early.All of that being said...I'm glad I have Season 4 on DVD now and I give this season 4 stars...1 for Shout!
