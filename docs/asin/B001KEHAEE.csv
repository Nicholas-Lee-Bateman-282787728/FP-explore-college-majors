1207807,A30AO422P01XK0,B001KEHAEE,Daniel Mackler,"[4, 6]","The story upon which this movie is based is fantastic---a tale of bravery and courage. However, this movie---a semi-fictionalized version of the real events---had some fatal flaws which undermined the power inherent in the tale.But first, its positives:1) Brilliant depictions of the horror of the Japanese occupation of China2) Especially good (that is, disturbing) depiction of the Rape of Nanjing3) Good use of Mandarin and Japanese interspersed with English.  So many movies do not mix languages well---this one pulled it off.4) EXCELLENT ending, or post-ending:  using actual footage of the now-grown men whom Hogg helped rescue.  It was actually the most powerful part of the movie.5) Chow Yun Fat is an excellent actor, and does not fail here.And its deadly flaws:1) The two main characters (Hogg and the nurse) were too pretty and had weak acting ability.  That combination made the movie seem FAKE and shallow.  Had they gotten average, normal-looking actors OF QUALITY the movie might have worked.2) The shallow acting made the characters' motives and relationships with others seem cheesy.  Hollywood strikes again!  (Strikes out, that is.)3) The romance was unnecessary and insincere.So, overall:  I felt like I was watching Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie rescue more non-white orphans.  What's sad is that the real George Hogg, from what I gather (via the internet and from the profoundly sincere words of the actual people he nurtured), was no Brad Pitt.

1207813,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B001KEHAEE,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[4, 7]","Chronicling the life of English journalist George Hogg during WWII, ""The Children of Huang Shi"" attempts to show the atrocities faced by the Chinese people during the Japanese occupation of the country in the early stages of the war.Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ambitious (albeit naive), young journalist trying to get to Nanjing. Under the guise of a Red Cross worker, he gains entrance, but quickly finds out this assignment will test all of his survival skills. His journalist peer (David Wenham) is killed, Hogg is stranded in Nanjing with an extremely aggressive (and murderous) force of Japanese soldiers, and to top it off, he is captured with the evidence of the atrocious behavior of the Japanese (killing of innocent villagers-men, women and children).It is only the fortuitous presence of a Chinese Nationalist (played with tremendous credibility by Chow Yun-Fat) that Hogg eventually escapes, making his way to an orphanage, partially looked after by Lee Pearsons (played with a lack of credibility by Radha Mitchell-a fine actress, but not her brightest hour). Befriending the boys-scared, lonely, starving, and diseased-isn't Hogg's easiest task, but he manages to convey a strong sense of self in the children, aided by Merchant Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) advice and supplies.Upon learning of the Japanese army's advancement into the orphanage territory, and knowing the boys could be conscripted at any time, Hogg decides to make the dangerous, 700 mile trek through the famous `Silk Road' (of Marco Polo fame). This is where this epic film should have risen to the occasion, with grandeur and wide-angle scope, but there is a definite disconnection with the viewer of the hardship faced by Hogg, Lee, and the children. The time feels shortened and compressed during the most challenging portion of the film, and when Hogg succumbs to tetanus, one feels cheated.""The Children of Huang Shi"" had much potential, but fell a little flat overall.

Initially there to cover the occupation and all that that entails, he and another journalist manage to infiltrate into an area where they are not welcome disguised as Red Cross workers. Things take an ugly turn, and George finds himself alone and wounded, captured by the Japanese, and about to be executed when he is rescued by a Chinese partisan. He is whisked away to a remote orphanage in the hills to recuperate, and what is at first only tolerated by the invalid becomes his mission in life.With the help of the Chinese partisan (the great Chow Yun Fat) and a young Australian woman adventurer/nurse (Radha Mitchell), George undertakes an almost unbelievable task: to evacuate the sixty orphan boys in the orphanage he has turned into a school 700 miles through China mountain passes on the Silk Road to the edge of the Gobi Desert, to save them from being conscripted into war.Beautifully filmed, the movie portrays mid-twentieth century China against breathtaking vistas and crowded cities amidst ancient buildings and sweeping deserts. The full vast scope of China is so gorgeously shown it makes you want to go there, and retells the story of George and his sixty young charges to a new generation of moviegoers who most likely have never heard of the Japanese Occupation.

1207817,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001KEHAEE,Grady Harp,"[12, 14]","THE CHILDREN OF HUANG SHI is a long (greater than two hours) epic tale that happens to be a true story of an extraordinary hero's life and gift to humanity during World War II.  If as a film the telling of this story is a bit shaky in spots, it is probably due to the episodic series of events that happened very quickly and under existing conditions of  profound stress.  Yet despite the occasional misfires in production this remains a bit of history we all should know.George Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a journalist assigned to Shanghai in 1937 and with his colleagues he plans to explore the extent of the invasion of China by the Japanese.  Under the guise of Red Cross workers his small band manages to enter Nanjing where now alone due to the loss of his friends to battle he observes and photographs the atrocities of mass murders of the people of Nanjing. He is captured by the Japanese, tortured when his confiscated camera reveals his terrifying photographs, and it is only by acts of fortune and the aid of a Chinese Nationalist Chen Hansheng (Chow Yun-Fat) that he escapes. Hogg probes the Chinese countryside for further evidences of the evil of the Japanese invasion, and he finds a village of children (adults are all absent) and realizes that he is in an orphanage without a leader.  At first reluctant to assume the role of guardian of these impoverished and filthy frightened children, he soon accepts his responsibility and is challenged by an Australian nurse Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell) to become not only the caretaker but also the father/teacher/provider/role model these children so desperately need.Seeing the advancing of the Japanese, Hogg decides to take his wards 700 mile away to a small village by the Gobi desert reachable only by the infamous Silk Road.  It is this journey and the way both the children and Hogg are affected by the challenge that absorb the greater part of the film.  Observing the transformation of George Hogg's view of the world is made credible by Jonathan Rhys Meyers' performance.  The cast of children often steals the limelight, but with supporting cast members such as Chow Yun-Fat, Radha Mitchell and Michelle Yeoh as an opium merchant the story never lacks color and character.  The look of the film is dark, but the message of this story is full of light.  Here is a bit of Chinese history we should all know!

1207828,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B001KEHAEE,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 2]","I was attracted to see this movie because it is set in late 1930s in China.  I personally knew very little about the internal civil war that was going on there between the imperial army and emerging communist force. It finally helepd me understand how Japanese had audacity to invade that country many times their size and keep it occupied throughtout the World War II.Main chracter of the movie is a young British reporter George Hogg, an Oxford educated journalist.  His job took him initially to US, then Japan and finally to China.  Seeking to report in Europe what is truly happening in the far east, he finds his way to Shanghai in desire to reach Nanjing where Japanese occupying army is killing civilians.  However, fate has other plans in store for George.George ends up in a countryside in an orphanage full of boys of all ages who know only of starvation and horrific loss of their families.  Slowly, George accepts his role of becoming their surrogate father, teacher and caretaker, until it becomes obcvious that Japanese army is closing in and Chinese army wishes to use boys for their own purposes as soldiers.For fans who saw Michelle Yeoh in her former films, there is a surprise.  This agile, martial arts actress has transformed herself in a dignified, beautiful local merchant full of grace, quiet determination and wisdom.

1207830,A205NEEKCQY4F8,B001KEHAEE,Tycereom,"[0, 0]","""The Children of Huang Shi"" is a smaller variation of ""Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, a young British man travels to Japanese occupied China in the 1930's and goes to great lengths to protect a large group of Chinese orphans, just as Schindler fought to protect a group of Jews in Germany. This is not a sweeping big budget war movie, but rather a smaller drama about the young British man and the Chinese orphans he saves. As such, it's fairly well made, but rather cliched. Leading man Meyers is okay, but leading woman Radha Mitchell does a bad job of acting, looking stiff. Maybe with good supporting actors Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh, there was no money in the budget for a better female lead. If you're looking for an epic war movie, this is not it, but it is an okay drama set during a war.

1207831,A1GOV026FYAXPE,B001KEHAEE,Wayne Brink,"[0, 0]","This movie started out pretty bold as George Hogg makes his way into occupied Nanjing and sees frightening atrocities. Captured by the Japanese and escaping by the slimmest margin, he finds himself eventually at an orphanage for boys and is forced by circumstance into the role of leader.To this point it was an exciting story, but from here it slowed down considerably.  I can't claim to be a movie critic, but I can say that the movie took on a very restricted feeling at this time. I was reminded of special movie presentations for television. Safe, taking no chances, taking an exciting and very interesting story and almost boring us with it.And the story itself is an amazing one. Hogg becomes a better person for his experiences and rises very much to the occasion. But even when there is a natural tension in the story, the storytelling is flat. I'm not sure that it is the fault of the actors. Certainly Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh can bring a lot to a movie. The other two actors, playing the lead roles, may have been fine, though they didn't inspire me particularly.  Their fault or that of the director? I'm not sure it matters.In the end, I think it is an important story, and it was told in a very workmanlike way.
