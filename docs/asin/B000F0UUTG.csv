A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[7, 7]","""Monk"" is one of those intelligent cult shows that usually dies a quick and painful death -- and this is one of the few that has lasted more than a few weeks. The obsessive compulsive detective returns on DVD with his fourth season of bizarre, seemingly unsolvable crimes, from homicidal dentists to amnesia.As the season opens, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) encounters a nasty new obstacle -- an inept private eye, Marty Eels (Jason Alexander), has suddenly become better than him. Everyone thinks Mart is a genius -- but Monk knows better. And when Eels' case explodes in his face, he calls on Monk and Natalie (Traylor Howard) to bail him out.As the series goes on, Adrian deals with all sorts of weird cases -- murderous dentists, black widows, a case of amnesia that has him thinking he's married to the town weirdo, a wine tasting, a stolen diamond with a million-dollar reward, deals with his boss's marital problems, fashion models, and a Christmas party that turns deadly. Worst of all, he's called on to do jury duty, and has to solve two crimes without leaving the room.And on the personal front, Monk reunites with his even-more-neurotic brother Ambrose for a Halloween mystery. But when Adrian shows signs of overcoming his disorder, Natalie sees what seems to be his dead wife Trudy walking around San Francisco -- and she's implicated in a murder.""Monk"" just wrapped its fifth season (which wasn't quite as good as this one), which is something of a record for any semi-intelligent TV show. And for the fourth season of a detective series, it has aged quite well -- the stories are still unusual and cleverly written.The writing is still quite solid, albeit with one or two lesser episodes (""Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage"" just feels incredibly awkward). But the comedy and unique crimes continue, to the point where Monk can even solve crimes without leaving his bed. And the series continues to chronicle Monk's struggles against his OCD, while reminding us that he could be worse.The characters continue to be well-fleshed out: We get some flashbacks to Monk's school years. And though more time has passed, he's still in love with his late wife -- one of the most charming scenes of the season has him slowly turning in the snow, thinking of Trudy.For the supporting characters: Stottlemeyer's marital problems continue with shocking results, and Randy Disher's secret rock'n'roll dreams get revealed when he quits the police force. And we get to see more of Natalie's background -- she comes from a moneyed socialite family, complete with a snotty mom.The fourth season of ""Monk"" is still solid and enjoyable, with the lovable obsessive-compulsive detective.

981133,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000F0UUTG,Mark Baker,"[31, 35]","Everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive phobic detective is back!  Police consultant Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) has sixteen more cases to solve.  They're sure to leave him terrified and us helpless with laughter.In this batch of episodes, Monk is faced with a brand new set of puzzles.  Who shot the pizza delivery guy?  Why did a masked man break a stock analyst's right hand?  Did Monk's late wife fake her death?  Who tried to run over Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford)?  And how could an astronaut commit murder when he was in space?  While working on answering these puzzles, he must face the challenge of dealing with the dentist, the flu, a cubical, a hangover, and amnesia.Once again, the plots here are a little on the thin side.  Heck, Monk usually tells us 15 minutes into the show who done it.  The problem is figuring out how the person did it.  I usually can't put all the pieces together until Monk explains it at the end, and then I feel foolish for missing it.Of course, the heart of the show is the humor.  The writers go out of their way to put Monk into situation that make him uncomfortable to show him over reacting to things.  Yet they keep him human, making us care for him.  This is best shown in ""Mr. Monk and the Astronaut.""  In one scene, we're laughing at his reaction to the laser pointers, the next we're feeling sorry for him as the suspect in the case belittles him.  Yet by the end we're proud as always of the way Monk overcomes his fears to save the day.  Overall, this keeps Monk human.Of course, the show works because the acting is so good.  The actors take the material and make it shine.  The cast is lead by Tony Shalhoub who brings Monk to life expertly.  This is the first full season with Traylor Howard as Monk's new assistant Natalie.  I may be in the minority, but she continues to grow on me each time I see her.  There is an innocence and sweetness that compliments Monk so well.  And Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford continue their great work as the police who constantly have to call on Monk to solve their hardest cases.Unfortunately, this season does have a couple of negatives.  While Monk's wife's murder is mentioned a few times, that storyline seems to have been dropped.  I like the few clues we were given each season to advance that story.  And this season has the single worst episode of the show yet.  ""Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist"" misses the comedy mark and becomes really dark really fast.  While I liked the fact they made Lt. Disher smart for a change, the rest of the episode just didn't work for me.Those who have been buying the previous seasons know what to expect here.  All sixteen episodes are presented in widescreen and Dolby sound on four discs.  The set is light on extras, this time giving us only two both on the last disc.  The first is a fifteen-minute look at the process the writing staff goes through to create an episode, looking specifically at ""Mr. Monk and the Big Reward.""  Despite what the box says, the actual second bonus feature is a brief profile of Jon Perkins, the detective who consults on the show to help add a bit of realize to it.On the whole, this is another fine season of a great dramedy.  This is the perfect way to preserve the show to watch over and over again.",5,Fear Not.

The writers seem to wisely reveal more of Monk as the season progresses.It is fairly evident that the writers seem to be trying to shoehorn Natalie into the Sharonna ""mold"", but they need an actress of higher caliber to take that on. Wisely, many shows focus on Monk, and the Christmas special has a few key highlights on Captain Stottlemeyer.THE DVD: Nice Menu Setup. However, it seems like the running joke seems to be to make an order mistake ( See disc four and the Clip cover, that differ). Oddly enough, whilst the Show sound is mainly 2.1, the special about the writing process, too short at 15 minutes, is in 5.1; The behind the scenes may have been in 5.1 as well, but I was disgusted that such a potentially good topic is under 4 minutes.Tony Shalhoub is still the Master of this show.

981149,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B000F0UUTG,"the one and only ""david""","[0, 1]","Monk Season 4 is one great season to add to your Monk collection. If you've never seen Monk before, I recommend you watching seaons 1-3 just to get up to date on who this guy is. Monk goes all over the place in this one. From bumping his head and losing his memory, to hearing Lieutenant Disher claim he saw his dentist murder a man while he was under sedation, to even having another detective come in and show him up during a crime. This is one great set of episodes.This 4 disk set comes with 16 episodes full of great comedy, drama, and even some suspense as you can't help but try to solve the cases before Monk makes his big revelation on who did it and how.Episodes Include:Monk and The Other Detective: Jason Alexander guest stars as another detective who starts showing Monk up with his seemingly implausible ways of solving the case. While others think he is a new genius, Monk believes the man is faking.Monk Goes Home Again: Halloween is here and someone is stealing candy from kids who trick or treated at Monks old home. It doesn't seem that important until the death of a security guard is brought up with it.Monk Stays in Bed: Mr. Monk gets sick for the first time in his life. But while he is in bed he must solve the case of a murdered judge that includes a pizza boy.Monk Goes to the Office: In this one a millionaire gets his hand broken by someone who also kills a security guard. Monk is sent undercover into the office building to find out who did it and why.Monk Gets Drunk: In this one at a wine tasting party Monk gets drunk and remembers talking to a man the night before that no one can seem to remember. Did he leave or is something else going on?Monk and Mrs. Monk: Monk starts getting over his O.C.D. However things look bad when Natalie and others start seeing Monk's dead wife, Trudy, walking around the city.Monk Goes to a Wedding: After Lt. Disher is hit by a car while arriving at the wedding of Natalie's brother, Monk suspects the brother's wife is the one who did it.Monk and Little Monk: After seeing an old flame from middle school, Monk has flashbacks to when he was a kid.Monk and the Secret Santa: A police officer is poisoned after drinking a bottle of wine he got during the Christmas season. Monk has to find out who did it and why.Monk Goes to the Fashion Show: After his shirt cleaning lady asks Monk for help for her son, Monk learns the young man has been charged with a crime he could not have committed.Monk Bumps His Head: Monk gets hit in the head after trying to find a new lead on his wife's murder and wakes up in a small town. While there he still has his cime solving skills and takes on the case of a murdered waitress.Monk and The Big Reward: Monk must find a stolen diamond worth 1 million dollars. However he is not the only one after the reward for whoever finds the diamond and returns it.Monk and The Astronaut: In this one Monk must prove a famous astronaut killed a woman while the man was in space when the murder happened.Monk Goes to the Dentist: Lt. Disher claims he saw his dentist kill a man while he was under sleeping gas in the chair. No one believes him, except Monk of course.Monk Gets Jury Duty: Monk has to solve a case he is one jury duty for, but also has to stop a drug kin pin from escaping the same courthouse.This is one great set of epsisodes. Every single one has a different unique twist and plenty of laughs. The murder revelations are also great to watch to see how they unfold. If you are a Monk fan or even a crime solving fan, buy this season.Highly recommended.",5,One of my favorite seasons....,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,3558,"['Monk', 'Season', '4', 'one', 'great', 'season', 'add', 'Monk', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Monk', 'recommend', 'watching', 'seaons', '1-3', 'just', 'get', 'up', 'date', 'who', 'guy', 'Monk', 'place', 'one', 'bumping', 'head', 'losing', 'memory', 'hearing', 'Lieutenant', 'Disher', 'claim', 'saw', 'dentist', 'murder', 'man', 'was', 'sedation', 'even', 'having', 'detective', 'come', 'show', 'up', 'crime', 'one', 'great', 'set', 'episodes.This', '4', 'disk', 'set', '16', 'episodes', 'full', 'great', 'comedy', 'drama', 'even', 'suspense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'try', 'solve', 'cases', 'Monk', 'big', 'revelation', 'who', 'did', 'how.Episodes', 'Include', 'Monk', 'Other', 'Detective', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'guest', 'stars', 'detective', 'who', 'showing', 'Monk', 'up', 'seemingly', 'implausible', 'ways', 'solving', 'case', 'others', 'think', 'new', 'genius', 'Monk', 'man', 'faking.Monk', 'Goes', 'Home', 'Again', 'Halloween', 'here', 'someone', 'stealing', 'candy', 'kids', 'who', 'trick', 'treated', 'Monks', 'old', 'home', ""n't"", 'seem', 'important', 'death', 'security', 'guard', 'brought', 'up', 'it.Monk', 'Stays', 'Bed', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'sick', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'bed', 'must', 'solve', 'case', 'murdered', 'judge', 'pizza', 'boy.Monk', 'Goes', 'Office', 'one', 'millionaire', 'hand', 'broken', 'someone', 'who', 'also', 'security', 'guard', 'Monk', 'sent', 'undercover', 'office', 'building', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'why.Monk', 'Gets', 'Drunk', 'one', 'wine', 'tasting', 'party', 'Monk', 'drunk', 'remembers', 'talking', 'man', 'night', 'one', 'can', 'seem', 'remember', 'Did', 'leave', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'Monk', 'Mrs.', 'Monk', 'Monk', 'getting', 'O.C.D', 'However', 'things', 'look', 'bad', 'when', 'Natalie', 'others', 'start', 'seeing', 'Monk', 'dead', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'walking', 'city.Monk', 'Goes', 'Wedding', 'Lt.', 'Disher', 'hit', 'car', 'arriving', 'wedding', 'Natalie', 'brother', 'Monk', 'brother', 'wife', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'it.Monk', 'Little', 'Monk', 'seeing', 'old', 'flame', 'middle', 'school', 'Monk', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'was', 'kid.Monk', 'Secret', 'Santa', 'police', 'officer', 'poisoned', 'drinking', 'bottle', 'wine', 'got', 'Christmas', 'season', 'Monk', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'why.Monk', 'Goes', 'Fashion', 'Show', 'shirt', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'asks', 'Monk', 'help', 'son', 'Monk', 'young', 'man', 'been', 'charged', 'crime', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'committed.Monk', 'Bumps', 'Head', 'Monk', 'hit', 'head', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'lead', 'wife', 'murder', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'still', 'cime', 'solving', 'skills', 'case', 'murdered', 'waitress.Monk', 'Big', 'Reward', 'Monk', 'must', 'find', 'stolen', 'diamond', 'worth', '1', 'million', 'dollars', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'reward', 'whoever', 'diamond', 'returns', 'it.Monk', 'Astronaut', 'one', 'Monk', 'must', 'prove', 'famous', 'astronaut', 'killed', 'woman', 'man', 'was', 'space', 'when', 'murder', 'happened.Monk', 'Goes', 'Dentist', 'Lt.', 'Disher', 'saw', 'dentist', 'kill', 'man', 'was', 'sleeping', 'gas', 'chair', 'one', 'Monk', 'course.Monk', 'Gets', 'Jury', 'Duty', 'Monk', 'solve', 'case', 'one', 'jury', 'duty', 'also', 'stop', 'drug', 'kin', 'pin', 'escaping', 'same', 'courthouse.This', 'one', 'great', 'set', 'epsisodes', 'single', 'one', 'different', 'unique', 'twist', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'murder', 'revelations', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'unfold', 'are', 'Monk', 'fan', 'even', 'crime', 'solving', 'fan', 'buy', 'season.Highly', 'recommended']",Monk: Season Four
