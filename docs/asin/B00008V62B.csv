David Friend and Simon Morley are captured here on DVD doing what has made them famous - dick tricks.  Sophmoric? Yes!  Easy to do at home? Yes!  But it is the two's easy-going matter of fact nature that makes this such a fun romp!  You get better seats by watching the show in this format than if you made it into the theatre.  The camera moves in very close, and the result is abstract and not pornographic in the slightest.  It actually would be a family-friendly show except for the nudity.  The guys do not use foul languange, and none of this is sexy - just silly.  There is an innocent glee almost as if these adult men are still in junior high!  It's a gigglefest.",5,Genital Origami to tickle your funny bone!,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,714,"['Never', 'male', 'member', 'been', 'so', 'funny', 'David', 'Friend', 'Simon', 'Morley', 'are', 'captured', 'here', 'DVD', 'doing', 'what', 'made', 'famous', 'dick', 'tricks', 'Sophmoric', 'Yes', 'Easy', 'do', 'home', 'Yes', 'two', 'easy-going', 'matter', 'fact', 'nature', 'such', 'fun', 'romp', 'get', 'better', 'seats', 'watching', 'show', 'format', 'made', 'theatre', 'camera', 'very', 'close', 'result', 'abstract', 'not', 'pornographic', 'slightest', 'actually', 'would', 'be', 'family-friendly', 'show', 'nudity', 'guys', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'foul', 'languange', 'none', 'sexy', 'just', 'silly', 'innocent', 'glee', 'almost', 'adult', 'men', 'are', 'still', 'junior', 'high', 'gigglefest']",N/A
747617,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00008V62B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[0, 0]","I first heard of these guys on one of HBO's Real Sex documentaries. The short clip that was shown was rather funny & made this group seem as it would be hilarious to watch. Unfortunately there were no recordings of their act that I could get my hands on (no pun intended) & I didn't live close to anyplace these guys were performing.A month ago I discovered that there was a DVD of their act, so immediately I netflixed it into my queue. Talk about a disappointment! The act itself just didn't really seem much to write home about. Like another review wrote, much of the video was shots of the audience reactions. I don't mind watching audience reactions but that's not really why I rented the DVD! Then there was the quality of the video. It was terrible! The video was very dark & it was somewhat hard to see what the guys were really doing. How can I laugh at the things they do when the theater was too dark to see properly & the camera man wouldn't always zoom in to show what we were supposed to be seeing? The result was that I just couldn't get into the video.I'm sure these guys are very funny, but the quality of this video is just terrible. If you can see the group in person, do so. Just don't waste your money on this DVD unless you've already seen all of the things already.",2,Dissapointing...,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1288,"['first', 'heard', 'guys', 'one', 'HBO', 'Real', 'Sex', 'documentaries', 'short', 'clip', 'was', 'shown', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', 'made', 'group', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'recordings', 'act', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'pun', 'intended', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'close', 'anyplace', 'guys', 'were', 'performing.A', 'month', 'discovered', 'was', 'DVD', 'act', 'immediately', 'netflixed', 'queue', 'Talk', 'disappointment', 'act', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'much', 'write', 'home', 'review', 'wrote', 'much', 'video', 'was', 'shots', 'audience', 'reactions', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'audience', 'reactions', 'not', 'really', 'why', 'rented', 'DVD', 'Then', 'was', 'quality', 'video', 'was', 'terrible', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'guys', 'were', 'really', 'doing', 'How', 'can', 'laugh', 'things', 'do', 'when', 'theater', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'see', 'properly', 'camera', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'always', 'zoom', 'show', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'seeing', 'result', 'was', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'video.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'quality', 'video', 'just', 'terrible', 'can', 'see', 'group', 'person', 'do', 'so', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'things', 'already']",N/A
747618,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00008V62B,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[34, 34]","PUPPETRY OF THE PENIS was an unexpected hot ticket in London and New York--a fifty minute comedy act that involves to two men who give a new meaning to the phrase &quot;show and tell&quot; by stripping buck naked and twisting their genitalia into, well, object d'art.  So to speak.  And this DVD offers the show before a live audience, so you can sit in on the twisting and pulling in an up-close and personal sort of way.This sounds a lot more bizarre than it really is, as any man who ever spent part of their teenage years in the highschool locker room can tell you.  Yes: it really is teenage boy humor, and Austrailian comics Simon Morley and David Friend have snatched it out of the locker room and plunked it on stage for all the world to see.  There's &quot;the boomerang,&quot; &quot;the eye,&quot; &quot;the Loch Ness Monster,&quot; &quot;the baby bird,&quot; and a host of other penis impersonations--all of which are good for a giggle and some of which are downright hilarious.Although the show is done in the nude, it isn't in the least erotic, so if that's what you're looking for you had better go some where else.  And in truth, this is a show that probably works much better on stage, where there it no doubt has an &quot;in your face&quot; factor that leads the audience to embarrassed hilarity--and indeed, the camera spends almost as much time on audience reaction as on the performers.Now, this is never going to make any one's short list of &quot;must own live comedy shows.&quot;  After all, the material will only stretch so far...  but taken in the right spirit, it is quite amusing, and it might be the perfect video for that next party you're thinking about giving--just imagine the possibilities!  The DVD package also includes a documentary on the creation of a second PUPPETRY OF THE PENIS performing company, which is also amusing in a bizarre sort of way, and a small booklet that will let viewers follow along at home if they are so inclined.

747619,AI4E5IFOT4QER,B00008V62B,James M. Shertzer,"[9, 12]","Having heard so much about this show, I certainly expected more. The show runs 50 minutes and at least 30 of those are redundant audience shots, swarmy or silly stage chatter and other assorted time-fillers. The ""tricks"" themselves aren't that spectacular: women and men may be uncomfortable watching them, but for very different reasons. The guys themselves are nothing special to look at and their equipment, apart from its (hmmm) elasticity, is nothing remarkable either. For a commercial release, the stage show video is poorly filmed and directed. The picture is subpar, the music is annoying jokey and the direction usually cuts to the audience before it shows you the dick trick everyone's laughing at uproariously. Slightly more interesting, but only slightly, is an added documentary on how the show was put together and the casting for a replacement company.",2,Stretches the material,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,868,"['Having', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'certainly', 'expected', 'more', 'show', '50', 'minutes', 'least', '30', 'are', 'redundant', 'audience', 'shots', 'swarmy', 'silly', 'stage', 'chatter', 'other', 'assorted', 'time-fillers', 'tricks', 'are', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'women', 'men', 'may', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'guys', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'look', 'equipment', 'apart', 'hmmm', 'elasticity', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'either', 'commercial', 'release', 'stage', 'show', 'video', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'directed', 'picture', 'subpar', 'music', 'annoying', 'jokey', 'direction', 'usually', 'audience', 'dick', 'trick', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'Slightly', 'more', 'interesting', 'only', 'slightly', 'added', 'documentary', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'casting', 'replacement', 'company']",N/A

It became the ""in"" thing to see and blab to your friends about. Since I wasn't able to make it, I've looked forward to watching this DVD. Filmed in front of a live audience, the cameras are trained far too much on audience reaction. You're shown over and over again people laughing hysterically and doubling over and sliding down in thier seats--when you want to feast your eyes on the two puppet masters. Both are very attractive and fascinating to watch as they exhibit zero inhibitions about appearing nekkid before a crowd. Their tricks are startling but after awhile you become tired of them. But this isn't the feature that will fascinate you. It's the extra included on the disc--""Cockstars"", a documentary about the process of auditioning other males who can carry on this grand tradition in another touring show. Their surprise ""star"", Steve, is beyond adorable. He's like a very hunky college guy in Australia or New Zealand who doesn't brag or joke or preen. He's very down-to-earth and sweet. You watch him and the others go on stage for their first appearance and you can almost feel the nervous chills. Unfortunately again, the camera continues to dart away after giving us just tiny little peeks at the nude Steve and his cohorts. This would make a perfect party video to show your guests. It's fun to watch hunky guys with no modesty get up on stage and play with themselves.",3,Weird!
