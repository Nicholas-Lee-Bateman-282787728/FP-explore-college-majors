They are all interwoven flawlessly together.There is so much information about Doctor Franklin, his contemporaries, and events in history, that this needs to watched several times to absorb all of it.Doctor Franklin, who was given an honorary doctorate degree from Oxford University, had only two years of formal education.  He was self taught in many areas and had many diverse interests and talents.  He was a scientist, inventor, writer, business man, philanthropist, ambassador, and helped to establish and secure our country as a legitimate one Europe's eyes.  He is the only person to have his signature on three of the most important documents in our history, The Declaration of Independence, the treaty with England after the Revolutionary War, and The Constitution of the United States.  Finally, he was also a husband, father, and grandfather.I could write pages on what I had learned from watching this DVD, but it would be better if you purchase it and discover the enormous contribution that this man made to this country and the world for yourself. :)",5,A fascinating and educational three and a half hours,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,1302,"['DVD', 'made', 'combination', 'historical', 'reenactments', 'interviews', 'actors', 'quoting', 'real', 'character', 'words', 'comments', 'made', 'authors', 'historians', 'other', 'assorted', 'well', 'read', 'people', 'history', 'Franklin', 'family', 'are', 'interwoven', 'flawlessly', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'Doctor', 'Franklin', 'contemporaries', 'events', 'history', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'absorb', 'it.Doctor', 'Franklin', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'honorary', 'doctorate', 'degree', 'Oxford', 'University', 'had', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'formal', 'education', 'was', 'taught', 'many', 'areas', 'had', 'many', 'diverse', 'interests', 'talents', 'was', 'scientist', 'inventor', 'writer', 'business', 'man', 'philanthropist', 'ambassador', 'helped', 'establish', 'secure', 'country', 'legitimate', 'one', 'Europe', 'eyes', 'only', 'person', 'have', 'signature', 'three', 'most', 'important', 'documents', 'history', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'treaty', 'England', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Constitution', 'United', 'States', 'Finally', 'was', 'also', 'husband', 'father', 'grandfather.I', 'could', 'write', 'pages', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'watching', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'purchase', 'discover', 'enormous', 'contribution', 'man', 'made', 'country', 'world']",Benjamin Franklin

730118,A1S03AS1WLT2OH,B00007KE63,I. Chiang,"[14, 14]","This film is about another founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin. It categorizes three parts to decipt him and I think this arrangement is pretty adequate.The first part, Let the Experiment Be Made, is about his enthusiasm on the science and the impacts to the world. The most famous story may be the kite and the lightning. In addition, this part also talks about his early life. Some of his scientific works are scattered in the other parts of this film.The second part, The Making of a Revolutionary, is about how he becomes a Patriot rather than sticking to a Loyalist. It is somewhat ironic since he regards himself as an Englishman rather than an American most of his life. At last, this turns out to be his darkest time since he and his son, who helped him in the kite and lightning experiment, are separated for different political beliefs.The third part, The Chess Master, is mostly about his endeavors in France during the Revolution War. After winning the independence, he is also a key man for the peace treaty with England and France and the U.S. Constitution. It is not straightforward as we might think to reach the peace treaty with the European powers because they had their own agendas. The U.S. Constitution is also not seemed to work at that time since no one is satisfied with it due to so many compromises and fears. Overall, these make him the only one sign in the three most important documents in the early U.S. history, the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Paris and the U.S. Constitution.The time is well spent after I have finished it. The narration and comments from experts are smooth and on focus. It's very pleasing to watch during the whole running time.

Kaminski ""j_s_k""","[2, 2]","Many would say Abraham Lincoln, some maybe George Washington...but in my opinion, Benjamin Franklin was, and is, the greatest American.  Why?  Franklin was accomplished in so many areas, you'd have a hard time just trying to keep track of everything he did.  Luckily, this program does it for you, and does it rather well.It is split into three episodes, but throughout, you will see the many sides of Franklin:  statesman, diplomat, inventor, scientist, philosopher, self-made businessman, humanitarian, visionary...and that's just what I can remember!  Franklin was one of those rare individuals who was able to succeed at seemingly anything he tried; a multi-talent who, really, was a giant among his peers.  That's what it comes down to, and one of the historians interviewed at the end of this program nailed it:  Franklin was, simply put, a genius.His story is told in a variety of ways - re-enactments, readings from Franklin's ""Autobiography,"" letters, on-site location filming, commentary from noted authors, and more.  It is all woven together rather neatly, which helps to make the 3+ hour program pass without noticing.  In the end, even though Franklin lived to be 84 years old, you are left wishing there was more to tell.Five stars.

Bernabo,"[11, 11]","This PBS documentary traces the epic life of Benjamin Franklin from his humble beginnings in Boston to his worldwide fame as a scientist, writer, Founding Father, and diplomat.  Originally premiered on PBS on November 19-20, 2002, the documentary breaks Franklin's life into three parts:(1) &quot;Let the Experiment Be Made&quot; (1706-1753) looks at how Franklin quickly rose from his humble origins to become a prominent printer and publisher in Philadelphia.  He &quot;retired&quot; to become a gentleman of leisure and devote his time to studying the new science of electricity.  His discoveries not only freed the world from the harmful effects of lightning but also made him a major figure on the world stage.  Throughout the series, Franklin's scientific work, from inventing the Franklin stove to charting the Gulf Stream, keep popping up along with their importance at that time.(2) &quot;The Making of a Revolutionary&quot; (1775-1776) finds Franklin moving to London where he ended up in the middle of the growing dispute between England and the American colonies.  The focus is on how this dispute turned Franklin, a loyal subject of the British empire who had his illegitimate son William made the Royal Governor of New Jersey, into a revolutionary who would return home to help draft the Declaration of Independence.  Keep in mind that this is happening in a world where getting a message back and forth across the Atlantic took weeks if not months.(3) &quot;The Chess Master&quot; (1776-1709) follows Franklin on the most important mission of his long life as he became the American diplomatic representative to France during the American Revolution.  Despite the less than helpful presence of John Adams and others, Franklin manages to play a pivotal role in getting France to recognize the new nation of the United States of America.  After the war, ends his public service helping to create the U.S. Constitution and being the only one of the Founding Fathers to actively campaign against the institution of slavery.Narrated by Colm Feore, this documentary features Dylan Baker as the young Franklin and Richard Easton as the older version.  The major strength of the production is that it relies heaving upon Franklin's own writings and those of his contemporaries, which are performed by Baker, Easton and other actors addressing the camera.  Easton especially does a marvelous job of catching the wisdom behind Franklin's wit and even his righteous anger when somebody gets on his bad side.  The result is that Easton ranks with Howard de Silva (&quot;1776&quot;) in the first rank of those who have portrayed Franklin on screen.  There are also talking heads, such as Gordon Wood (whose &quot;The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin&quot; I read last year), who providing historical insights and perspective.  But mostly you are going to remember what Ben tells you (e.g., the story of paying too much for the whistle), and have a much better sense of both the man and his accomplishments after spend 3  hours watching this documentary.There is a short featurette on the making of the series and some program &quot;outtakes,&quot; which consist of more examples of talking heads, primarily Franklin, reciting various writings (apparently the people at PBS are so sheltered they do not know these would be better characterized as deleted scenes, or at least excerpts).  As is the case with most PBS DVD Videos you can go to their excellent website for &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; and find a Teacher's Guide and other Resources for teachers and students to learn more about Franklin.",5,Benjamin Franklin: An Extraordinary Life.

730128,A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1,B00007KE63,Tom B.,"[52, 52]","This clever and entertaining look at the life and times of Benjamin Franklin would be a great addition to the library of any Franklin buff or history buff for that matter.It is well written, and entertainingly presented with a mix of narration and live action.  Richard Easton does a fantastic job portraying Franklin and the cast does well acting out actual correspondences and written first hand accounts from the time.The film is broken down into three segments showing the life of Franklin. Let the Experiment Be Made, The Making of a Revolutionary, and The Chessmaster.Let the experiment be made shows the early life of Franklin, how a genius was made and his contributions to science.The Making of a Revolutionary shows how a man who once considered himself a loyalist became a fierce proponent of independence.The Chessmaster detailed his years in France gaining support for the war, the treaty of France, and the building of the American Experiment in democracy.Ultimately this film does a great job portraying Franklin as a man.  Sometimes flawed, as we all are, but a man who contributed so many things to making America what we know today.It does it with wit, humor, and narration that moves quick and keeps you interested.",5,Near perfect account of an American Icon,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,1234,"['clever', 'entertaining', 'look', 'life', 'times', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'library', 'Franklin', 'buff', 'history', 'buff', 'matter.It', 'well', 'written', 'entertainingly', 'presented', 'mix', 'narration', 'live', 'action', 'Richard', 'Easton', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'Franklin', 'cast', 'well', 'acting', 'out', 'actual', 'correspondences', 'written', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'time.The', 'film', 'broken', 'down', 'three', 'segments', 'showing', 'life', 'Franklin', 'Let', 'Experiment', 'Be', 'Made', 'Making', 'Revolutionary', 'Chessmaster.Let', 'experiment', 'be', 'made', 'early', 'life', 'Franklin', 'how', 'genius', 'was', 'made', 'contributions', 'science.The', 'Making', 'Revolutionary', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'once', 'considered', 'loyalist', 'became', 'fierce', 'proponent', 'independence.The', 'Chessmaster', 'detailed', 'years', 'France', 'gaining', 'support', 'war', 'treaty', 'France', 'building', 'American', 'Experiment', 'democracy.Ultimately', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Franklin', 'man', 'Sometimes', 'flawed', 'are', 'man', 'who', 'contributed', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'making', 'America', 'what', 'know', 'today.It', 'wit', 'humor', 'narration', 'quick', 'interested']",Benjamin Franklin
