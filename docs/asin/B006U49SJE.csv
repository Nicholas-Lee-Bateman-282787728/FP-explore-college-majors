Nine college friends reunite after the death of their millionaire philanthropist friend, and to receive a six-figure inheritance, must all spend a week together at his mansion as part of a reunion. Old grudges are reunited, and past relationships and secrets brought to the surface.The problem was there was too much stale dialogue, and most of the characters weren't fleshed out enough, or given enough backstory. The only three characters we really get any attention on is Jamal, the has-been rapper, Gary, the porn director, and Lisa, the fiance to an NBA star. And then instigator Ebony on the final night. Other characters, like Storm and Aaron, are just sort of there to stand in the background, and have very few lines. Even Terrell Owens' character of Jackson is treated as a 'more important' character, even when his reputation is portrayed as negative and unloyal to his woman.Personally, I wish some characters had more lines and dialogue. I would've liked it if Stacy Keibler as Storm had more lines, as her being the half-White character made her stand out and people question why she would be in the group of Howard University alumni to begin with. The same with Ebony, as her bitterness and nasty attitude is never really explained much. Especially considering these are supposed to be her only friends. It's implied that she's jealous and self-loathing, and that her husband left her to be with another man, but that's as much as we get about Ebony.Overall, the script was kinda weak, and the directing so-so, but the story had a lot of heart. It's worth renting for a dollar or two. It's a nice movie, but it has it's bumps along the way, so just don't expect greatness.STACEY DASH  - Lisa: Uptight law student and fiance to Jackson.TERRELL OWENS - Jackson: Storm's ex and disgraced NBA star, currently cheating on Lisa.WESLEY JONATHAN  - Brett: Advertising executive in a failing marriage.DATARI TURNER - Aaron: Lisa's ex and a sports writer.JASON WEAVER  - Gary: Adult movie director trying to go mainstream.PERSIA WHITE  - Trenyce: B-movie actress suffering from depression.REAGAN GOMEZ-PRESTON  - Ebony: Unemployed jaded b*tch, gold-digger and instigator.CHRISTIAN KEYES  - Stylz: Effeminate and flamboyant male model.

We have seen these type of impracticable ""will"" movies before. The characters include a washed up rapper who still thinks he has a career, a film star who does direct to DVD movies, a porno director, a business man cheating on his wife, A male model, a couple of gold diggers, a women engaged to an athlete and a sports writer who still loves said woman. Ebony (Reagan Gomez-Preston) is the chief antagonist in this group of friends which you wonder how they ever put up with each other in the first place. Dennis was apparently the glue that held the group together. Meagan Good, which is billed as a star in the film has a minor role and is not part of the group.The first 2 days they spend together, the acting and dialouge are horrible. If you can make it into day 3 the movie starts to get interesting, as if a new writer and cast were hired. Even TO did well. The problem is I couldn't connect with any of the characters, who were introduced late, so when things are supposed to get interesting, I was bored. Days 3 and 4 showed promise and gave us material for the climatic dinner at day 5 which returned to the terrible dialouge of earlier.There was a feel good ending.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity, sex talk.",3,YOU LOOK LIKE MEAGAN GOOD,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1346,"['When', 'rich', 'guy', 'Dennis', 'something', 'will', 'college', 'friends', 'spend', '5', 'days', 'together', 'house', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'impracticable', 'will', 'movies', 'characters', 'include', 'washed', 'up', 'rapper', 'who', 'still', 'career', 'film', 'star', 'who', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movies', 'porno', 'director', 'business', 'man', 'cheating', 'wife', 'male', 'model', 'couple', 'gold', 'diggers', 'women', 'engaged', 'athlete', 'sports', 'writer', 'who', 'still', 'said', 'woman', 'Ebony', 'Reagan', 'Gomez-Preston', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'group', 'friends', 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'first', 'place', 'Dennis', 'was', 'apparently', 'glue', 'held', 'group', 'together', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'billed', 'star', 'film', 'minor', 'role', 'not', 'part', 'group.The', 'first', '2', 'days', 'spend', 'together', 'acting', 'dialouge', 'are', 'horrible', 'can', 'make', 'day', '3', 'movie', 'get', 'interesting', 'new', 'writer', 'cast', 'were', 'hired', 'Even', 'TO', 'did', 'well', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'introduced', 'late', 'so', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'get', 'interesting', 'was', 'bored', '3', '4', 'showed', 'promise', 'gave', 'material', 'climatic', 'dinner', 'day', '5', 'returned', 'terrible', 'dialouge', 'earlier.There', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'ending.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'sex', 'talk']",Dysfunctional Friends
