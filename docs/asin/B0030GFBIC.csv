1315424,A21FWV7IMMPSXP,B0030GFBIC,"Jeffrey Peter A. Hauck ""Guerrilla Reader""","[3, 3]","Review of the DVD ""Achieving Kicking Excellence, Volume One: Basic Principles of Execution,"" by Shawn Kovacich.I was thrilled to learn that Shawn Kovacich was creating a complementary DVD series to support his outstanding Ten Volume ""Achieving Kicking Excellence"" textbook series.Shawn is, in my opinion, the martial arts master of kicking and any interested practitioner would be well advised to seek the counsel he offers in both book and of course DVD format.  Although both medium could stand on their own, the 2 disc volume currently being reviewed brings the Achieving Kicking Excellence book series to life.  Shawn, in painstaking detail, breaks down each kick offering technique points, principles, and advice to ensure smooth execution and power.For example, one kick that I was particularly having trouble with was the Axe Kick.  This is a Tae Kwon Do kick requiring a mid-body arc and then downward pull or ""chop"" of the leg allowing the heel (or arguably the ball) of the foot to connect on target.  It requires a lot of abdominal as well as leg strength to execute.  Following Shawn's guidance I was able to see a demonstrable difference in my technique, execution, and as a result, the force I could bring down on a target.  To me this is the ""gold standard"" of instructional materials and is the hallmark of Shawn's books and DVD.Expect no gimmicks or glitzy commercialization in this two disc set.  Using simplicity as his strength Shawn gets right to the ""nuts and bolts"" of his kicking instruction.  That is what makes it so useful!  No lengthy lead-ins or martial arts philosophical pontification.  The only material he expounds upon is relevant to the course at hand; kicking!If you are interested in improving your kicks or learning the proper way to execute them in the first place, then take my advice and order Shawn's books and DVD.  Shawn's DVD makes an excellent training partner!  I rate this DVD set at five stars for bringing back simple and thorough martial arts instruction.  If I could add a couple of stars I would because it offers so much information to the viewer.  Very, very well done.Jeffrey-Peter Hauck, JD, CPO, CII[...]",5,"""Achieving Kicking Excellence"" Lives Up To It's Title!",1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2162,"['Review', 'DVD', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'Volume', 'One', 'Basic', 'Principles', 'Execution', 'Shawn', 'Kovacich.I', 'was', 'thrilled', 'learn', 'Shawn', 'Kovacich', 'was', 'creating', 'complementary', 'DVD', 'series', 'support', 'outstanding', 'Ten', 'Volume', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'textbook', 'series.Shawn', 'opinion', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'kicking', 'interested', 'practitioner', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'seek', 'counsel', 'book', 'course', 'DVD', 'format', 'medium', 'could', 'stand', 'own', '2', 'disc', 'volume', 'currently', 'being', 'reviewed', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'book', 'series', 'life', 'Shawn', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'breaks', 'down', 'kick', 'offering', 'technique', 'points', 'principles', 'advice', 'ensure', 'smooth', 'execution', 'power.For', 'example', 'one', 'kick', 'was', 'particularly', 'having', 'trouble', 'was', 'Axe', 'Kick', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'kick', 'requiring', 'mid-body', 'arc', 'then', 'downward', 'pull', 'chop', 'leg', 'allowing', 'heel', 'arguably', 'ball', 'foot', 'connect', 'target', 'lot', 'abdominal', 'as', 'well', 'leg', 'strength', 'execute', 'Following', 'Shawn', 'guidance', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'demonstrable', 'difference', 'technique', 'execution', 'result', 'force', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'target', 'gold', 'standard', 'instructional', 'materials', 'hallmark', 'Shawn', 'books', 'DVD.Expect', 'gimmicks', 'glitzy', 'commercialization', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'Using', 'simplicity', 'strength', 'Shawn', 'right', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'kicking', 'instruction', 'what', 'so', 'useful', 'lengthy', 'lead-ins', 'martial', 'arts', 'philosophical', 'pontification', 'only', 'material', 'upon', 'relevant', 'course', 'hand', 'kicking', 'are', 'interested', 'improving', 'kicks', 'learning', 'proper', 'way', 'execute', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'take', 'advice', 'order', 'Shawn', 'books', 'DVD', 'Shawn', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'training', 'partner', 'rate', 'DVD', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'bringing', 'back', 'simple', 'thorough', 'martial', 'arts', 'instruction', 'could', 'add', 'couple', 'stars', 'would', 'because', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'viewer', 'Very', 'very', 'well', 'done.Jeffrey-Peter', 'Hauck', 'JD', 'CPO', 'CII', '[', ']']",N/A
1315425,A1URMXEEWEQR6V,B0030GFBIC,Jeremiah L. Olson,"[3, 3]","I have not seen anyone take this much time and break down every detail to help the student fully learn and understand the technique.  I am a judo player so I do not use any kicks.  I have read Shawn's books and some books on Muay Thai but have no other practical experience with kicks.  As a person with minimal knowledge of kicks, this was a video for me.  It was very helpful to see the kick broken down several times and each one of the dynamics in the kick explained.  I am glad that he also discussed exercises to improve kicks and the importance of stretching and endurance.  There were also many humorous moments in the video in which Shawn made jokes about a pink thong, his wife not washing his uniform, and appeared overly concerned about his hairly legs.  This is a very helpful instructional DVD and I would recommend it for anyone who is learning kicks and would like to practice them in the privacy of their own home.",5,Exhaustingly thorough,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,931,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'anyone', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'break', 'down', 'detail', 'help', 'student', 'fully', 'learn', 'understand', 'technique', 'am', 'judo', 'player', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'kicks', 'have', 'read', 'Shawn', 'books', 'books', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'have', 'other', 'practical', 'experience', 'kicks', 'person', 'minimal', 'knowledge', 'kicks', 'was', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'helpful', 'see', 'kick', 'broken', 'down', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'dynamics', 'kick', 'explained', 'am', 'glad', 'also', 'discussed', 'exercises', 'improve', 'kicks', 'importance', 'stretching', 'endurance', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'humorous', 'moments', 'video', 'Shawn', 'made', 'jokes', 'pink', 'thong', 'wife', 'not', 'washing', 'uniform', 'appeared', 'overly', 'concerned', 'hairly', 'legs', 'very', 'helpful', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'learning', 'kicks', 'would', 'like', 'practice', 'privacy', 'own', 'home']",N/A
1315426,A2IO1ESNSIAXG3,B0030GFBIC,L. A. Kane,"[1, 1]","This volume covers the fundamentals of kicking, illuminating the principles necessary for executing accurate and powerful back, wheel, axe, crescent, reverse crescent, front, hook, hatchet, roundhouse, and side kicks. It is style agnostic, applicable to anyone who practices an art that strikes with the foot such as taekwondo, karate, or kung fu. While this DVD stands alone, it works even better in concert with Kovacich's outstanding Achieving Kicking Excellence book series. Either way, the materials offer more depth and breadth than I have ever seen in one place.My only complaint is the sound quality, which is less than stellar with a bit of a hum in the background, yet it's easy enough to understand what's going on nevertheless. The disk is well indexed so you can refer back or skip forward to sections with ease (this is one of those disks you'll want to play over and over again). The video is pretty vanilla, no fancy 3D effects or glowing blue aliens, but it is more than adequate to get the job done. Disk one covers the intro and an overview of the ten primary kicks then goes on to cover proper technique, correct stance, conditioning, muscular control, kicking foot, pivoting, stability, eye contact, breathing, and striking surface. Disk two continues with accuracy, alignment, impact, follow-through, distance, timing, height, visualization, and conclusion. All together, it's more than 2 1/2 hours of world-class instruction.No dojo darling, Kovacich really knows what he is talking about. A fourth-degree black belt in both karate and taekwondo, he has competed in full contact sparring tournaments (including the prestigious Sabaki Challenge) and is the world-record holder for both endurance- and high-kicking as certified by the Guinness Book of World Records. Kovacich has been teaching martial arts since 1985 and this knowledge, skill, and ability really shine through in the instruction.This DVD will make a big impact on your training. It is a volume that every serious martial artist should own.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Blinded by the Night, among other titles",5,Top notch instruction,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2091,"['volume', 'fundamentals', 'kicking', 'illuminating', 'principles', 'necessary', 'executing', 'accurate', 'powerful', 'back', 'wheel', 'axe', 'crescent', 'reverse', 'crescent', 'front', 'hook', 'hatchet', 'roundhouse', 'side', 'kicks', 'style', 'agnostic', 'applicable', 'anyone', 'who', 'practices', 'art', 'foot', 'such', 'taekwondo', 'karate', 'kung', 'fu', 'DVD', 'alone', 'even', 'better', 'concert', 'Kovacich', 'outstanding', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'book', 'series', 'way', 'materials', 'offer', 'more', 'depth', 'breadth', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'place.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'sound', 'quality', 'less', 'stellar', 'bit', 'hum', 'background', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'nevertheless', 'disk', 'well', 'indexed', 'can', 'refer', 'back', 'skip', 'forward', 'sections', 'ease', 'one', 'disks', ""'ll"", 'want', 'play', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'video', 'pretty', 'vanilla', 'fancy', '3D', 'effects', 'glowing', 'blue', 'aliens', 'more', 'adequate', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Disk', 'one', 'intro', 'overview', 'ten', 'primary', 'kicks', 'then', 'cover', 'proper', 'technique', 'correct', 'stance', 'conditioning', 'muscular', 'control', 'kicking', 'foot', 'pivoting', 'stability', 'eye', 'contact', 'breathing', 'striking', 'surface', 'Disk', 'two', 'accuracy', 'alignment', 'impact', 'follow-through', 'distance', 'timing', 'height', 'visualization', 'conclusion', 'together', 'more', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'world-class', 'instruction.No', 'dojo', 'darling', 'Kovacich', 'really', 'what', 'talking', 'about', 'fourth-degree', 'black', 'belt', 'karate', 'taekwondo', 'competed', 'full', 'contact', 'sparring', 'tournaments', 'including', 'prestigious', 'Sabaki', 'Challenge', 'world-record', 'holder', 'endurance-', 'high-kicking', 'certified', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records', 'Kovacich', 'been', 'teaching', 'martial', 'arts', '1985', 'knowledge', 'skill', 'ability', 'really', 'shine', 'instruction.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'big', 'impact', 'training', 'volume', 'serious', 'martial', 'artist', 'should', 'own.Lawrence', 'KaneAuthor', 'Blinded', 'Night', 'other', 'titles']",N/A

As a guy who has been kicking and punching since 1965, I learned lots of little nuggets and a few gold bars that I didn't know or had forgotten. There were a couple things that I didn't agree with, but that's just the nature of different approaches to the martial arts, and it in no way detracts from the outstanding information in this DVD.If you're a beginner, Shawn's information will clarify and enhance what you have learned in your school. If you're a veteran martial artist, you will be reminded of critical elements that might have disappeared from your kicks, learn interesting tidbits that will make them even better, and pick up some teaching tips that will help your students.Highly recommended.Loren W.

Besides working with competent instructors at the local school I explored and deepened my knowledge of Kicking with Mr. Kovacich's books, ""Achieving Kicking Excellence.""I was waiting for the DVD with great expectations! However, I had no idea what they would cover. Part of me hoped for a ""visual"" counterpart of the books but as I played the DVD I realized that it was not so. Well, that&iexcl; really not really correct! All 10 kicks are reviewed in one chapter of the DVD; he just doesn&iexcl; give you any deeper information about them (but recommends you to study them from the books).The two DVDs that come in the set cover one of the most important aspects of martial arts: the Basics. As I am advancing in my studies (as I write, I am getting ready to test for Black Belt), my instructor is putting more and more emphasis on the basics - stances, pivoting, etc. We are going back and restudy all the forms (from white to red), focusing on each and every move. It's all about the fundamentals of the Art!This DVD set contains all those precious information that any martial artist, no matter the discipline, no matter the rank, must constantly go back to; therefore, this DVD set - in my opinion - is a ""must have"" in anyone's library.The material is organized logically and Mr Kovacich explains and demonstrates the material with the ease of an expert teacher. I also appreciate the humor that he uses in order to make the point (I wonder what the wife said after hearing the comment about now washing the uniform :) ). Another good point of the organization of the material is that each chapter is quite short, so I can review the material quickly without listening to lengthy explanations (which, again, anyone can find them in the books).Some improvements could be made, however. There is only one camera, fixed on the Mr Kovacich. Lighting is a problem: the instructor is over exposed, in my opinion. Sometimes it's hard to see his face. Sound: you can hear the ""humming"" of the lights (I think that's where it comes from) in the background.All this, however, takes nothing from the information that is contained in the DVD. I do not need or want DVDs with state of the art effects but with poor information. I need ""effective"" material that makes my kicking better. This DVD set helps me to review the basic/fundamentals of Kicking when I am not working at the school. It accomplishes what it says it would do. It's a keeper! Can't wait for the other ones.",5,"Because it's all about the Fundamentals, this DVD is a gem!",1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,2554,"['entered', 'world', 'Martial', 'arts', 'later', 'life', 'am', '40+', 'studying', 'Taekwondo', 'working', 'competent', 'instructors', 'local', 'school', 'explored', 'deepened', 'knowledge', 'Kicking', 'Mr.', 'Kovacich', 'books', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'was', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'great', 'expectations', 'However', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'cover', 'Part', 'hoped', 'visual', 'counterpart', 'books', 'played', 'DVD', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'Well', 'iexcl', 'really', 'not', 'really', 'correct', '10', 'kicks', 'are', 'reviewed', 'one', 'chapter', 'DVD', 'just', 'doesn', 'iexcl', 'give', 'deeper', 'information', 'study', 'books', '.The', 'two', 'DVDs', 'come', 'set', 'cover', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'martial', 'arts', 'Basics', 'am', 'advancing', 'studies', 'write', 'am', 'getting', 'ready', 'test', 'Black', 'Belt', 'instructor', 'putting', 'more', 'more', 'emphasis', 'basics', 'stances', 'pivoting', 'etc', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'restudy', 'forms', 'white', 'red', 'focusing', 'move', 'fundamentals', 'Art', 'DVD', 'set', 'precious', 'information', 'martial', 'artist', 'matter', 'discipline', 'matter', 'rank', 'must', 'constantly', 'go', 'back', 'therefore', 'DVD', 'set', 'opinion', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'library.The', 'material', 'organized', 'logically', 'Mr', 'Kovacich', 'material', 'ease', 'expert', 'teacher', 'also', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'order', 'make', 'point', 'wonder', 'what', 'wife', 'said', 'hearing', 'comment', 'about', 'now', 'washing', 'uniform', 'good', 'point', 'organization', 'material', 'chapter', 'quite', 'short', 'can', 'review', 'material', 'quickly', 'listening', 'lengthy', 'explanations', 'again', 'anyone', 'can', 'find', 'books', '.Some', 'improvements', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'however', 'only', 'one', 'camera', 'fixed', 'Mr', 'Kovacich', 'Lighting', 'problem', 'instructor', 'exposed', 'opinion', 'hard', 'see', 'face', 'Sound', 'can', 'hear', 'humming', 'lights', 'think', 'where', 'background.All', 'however', 'nothing', 'information', 'contained', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'want', 'DVDs', 'state', 'art', 'effects', 'poor', 'information', 'need', 'effective', 'material', 'kicking', 'better', 'DVD', 'set', 'review', 'basic/fundamentals', 'Kicking', 'when', 'am', 'not', 'working', 'school', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'keeper', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'other', 'ones']",N/A
