I found myself laughing a lot during the movie ... especially the scenes with Eugene Levy's ""repli-character.""  This movie is basically about a guy who clones a girl he likes (by accident).  He and his friend decide to teach her ""guy stuff"" ... teach her to love football, wrestling, to love to drink bear, have casual sex, etc.  This ""Repli-Kate"" doesn't turn out all that well.  Sure she's hot, just like the original, but she burps and only likes to sit on the couch and eat pizza and watch football ... and she doesn't like ""emotional girly stuff.""  Every guys dream girl, right?  EEEEE... WRONG!  I definitely think Ali Landry did a good job portraying both her regular self and her clone.  I like when they go shopping for bras, and the sales lady asks what size she is, so she pulls up her shirt and exposes her breasts and says, ""I don't know, you tell me.""  All in all I liked the movie.  It had some good laughs, and the concept was pretty inventive.  Good acting.  The ending was great.  I give it a B-.  :)  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a laid-back comedic adventure!",4,Where's Repli-Jonas???,1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,1190,"['Haha', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'found', 'laughing', 'lot', 'movie', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'repli-character', 'movie', 'basically', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'accident', 'friend', 'decide', 'teach', 'guy', 'stuff', 'love', 'football', 'wrestling', 'love', 'drink', 'bear', 'have', 'casual', 'sex', 'etc', 'Repli-Kate', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'Sure', 'hot', 'just', 'original', 'burps', 'only', 'sit', 'couch', 'eat', 'pizza', 'watch', 'football', ""n't"", 'like', 'emotional', 'girly', 'stuff', 'Every', 'guys', 'dream', 'girl', 'right', 'EEEEE', 'WRONG', 'definitely', 'think', 'Ali', 'Landry', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'regular', 'self', 'clone', 'like', 'when', 'go', 'shopping', 'bras', 'sales', 'lady', 'what', 'size', 'up', 'shirt', 'breasts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'tell', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'laughs', 'concept', 'was', 'pretty', 'inventive', 'Good', 'acting', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'give', 'B-', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'laid-back', 'comedic', 'adventure']",N/A

You'll love this film.  This movie is sort of an upated version of &quot;Weird Science&quot; for the guys who were the right age to love that movie when it came out in the 80s.Just like &quot;Weird Science&quot;, there's the nice guy and his  somewhat funny and somewhat annoying friend.  Instead of being kids in high school they now work in a lab at a University (I think they filmed it at UCLA), instead of parents they have a controlling boss, and instead of a mean older brother they have something far much worse.  They don't create a woman from a barbie doll this time, they clone a real woman.  So, they have the original woman to deal with.The girl is updated too.  The guy and his friend mold the clone into the ulitmate man in a woman's body.  She loves drinking beer and watching sports.  The type of guys I mentioned at the beginning of this review would do anything to be dating a girl like this.However, for everyone else, the movie does have some nice moments.  Some of the actors give funny performances including Desmon Askew and (the always great) Eugene Levy.  Ali Landry does a very good job in both her roles (playing the real girl and the clone).  Also, the special effects for the scenes where the real girl meets her clone are fairly well done.Like I said, this movie is made for a certain type of man, but there are a few things in it that would appeal to other types of people.",4,Very funny....for the right type of person,1029024000,"08 11, 2002",2002,1596,"[""'re"", 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'quot', 'Man', 'Show', 'quot', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'TV', 'magazines', 'quot', 'FHM', 'quot', 'quot', 'Maxim', 'quot', 'then', 'movie', 'immedaitely', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'movie', 'sort', 'upated', 'version', 'quot', 'Weird', 'Science', 'quot', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'right', 'age', 'love', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '80s.Just', 'quot', 'Weird', 'Science', 'quot', 'nice', 'guy', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'friend', 'Instead', 'being', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'work', 'lab', 'University', 'think', 'filmed', 'UCLA', 'instead', 'parents', 'have', 'controlling', 'boss', 'instead', 'mean', 'older', 'brother', 'have', 'something', 'far', 'much', 'worse', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'woman', 'barbie', 'doll', 'time', 'clone', 'real', 'woman', 'So', 'have', 'original', 'woman', 'deal', 'with.The', 'girl', 'updated', 'too', 'guy', 'friend', 'mold', 'clone', 'ulitmate', 'man', 'woman', 'body', 'drinking', 'beer', 'watching', 'sports', 'type', 'guys', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'review', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'dating', 'girl', 'this.However', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'have', 'nice', 'moments', 'actors', 'give', 'funny', 'performances', 'including', 'Desmon', 'Askew', 'always', 'great', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Ali', 'Landry', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'playing', 'real', 'girl', 'clone', 'Also', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'where', 'real', 'girl', 'clone', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'said', 'movie', 'made', 'certain', 'type', 'man', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'would', 'appeal', 'other', 'types', 'people']",N/A
704717,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000068MBD,Chris Kennison,"[15, 15]","I normally would withhold a 5 star rating for a classic like REAR WINDOW or BRAVEHEART... something of that calibur.  But, for what REPLIKATE is.... it deserves 5 stars.  And what it is, is a movie that didn't get a sliver of recognition, a sliver of publicity and holds more bust out laughs than any movie of recent that I can remember.I gathered my brothers and sister around the other day and told them that they had to see this movie that nobody had heard about.  I had already watched it 4 times and was prepared to watch it again.  My sister was ready to go home, but instead we all gathered around and laughed our butts off.Contemporary comedies are all trying to capture the laughs that movies like CADDYSHACK, AIRPLANE and BLAZING SADDLES received, but most of them fail because of one reason: they're afraid to offend anybody.  By the time movies hit the screen, the EXECS have cut out all the funny stuff in order to be politically correct and not hurt people's feelings.  Well, in a way, that's why REPLIKATE works so well.  Because nobody cared about it, and it went straight to video, THEY ACTUALLY LEFT THE FUNNY STUFF IN!The movie is a cross between AMERICAN PIE, REAL GENIUS and WEIRD SCIENCE, and funnier then all three.  Lots of gender and sex jokes.  The best way to describe it is to say that it feels like a movie made by the writers of MAXIM or STUFF magazine.  Believe me, if you can find a copy of it, watch it, you won't be disappointed.Also, and the most important point to make is that I never really had an opinion about Ali Landry before REPLIKATE, but after watching it, I think she's a hoot.  On the surface, this girl is BEAUTIFUL, but underneath, she's good.  Really good.  She had to have a lot of charm and charisma to pull this off and she was overflowing with it.  You'll fall in love with her... both of her.It's unfortunate that a lot of people aren't going to see this gem of a comedy and miss the performance that she gives, but I think and hope that ALI LANDRY has a long career, and someday does something big.By the end of the movie, you'll be saying ""I WANT ONE"".

I first saw this movie on sale today in a French supermarket. the theme of the movie caught my eyes but i thought this is probably a very bad movie. It just looks good but there is nothing behind it. I went to Amazon to check the critics and they were excellent but only 6 of them. The movie is practically unknown to the public. Then I decided &quot;let's go for it&quot; and I returned to buy it along with a pizza and a pack of beer. Let me tell you that there is no need to sip the beers to enjoy this movie. I have seen so many movies those last 20 years and You can trust me if I tell you that this is a great comedy! it doesn't even look in any way as a cheap movie. Just is a great one.
