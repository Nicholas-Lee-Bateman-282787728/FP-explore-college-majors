616238,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JMBQ,Alistair McHarg,"[1, 1]","There's a point in Neil LaBute's razor sharp satire, The Shape Of Things, where the protagonists, Adam and Evelyn, are discussing a show they've just seen.  Their graphic description sounds suspiciously like Karen Finley, whose zany antics helped galvanize the extreme right wing against all things liberal and artistic.  I saw Finley perform and will freely concede that watching her pour chocolate sauce on her naked body was amusing, diverting, and tested the perimeter of what may seriously be called art.  Finley's position was that she herself was her own artistic statement.  Evelyn, played brilliantly by Rachel Weisz, takes this concept one step further.Although it reads like a play adapted for film, it is, The Shape Of Things is really more like a slow burning horror movie that builds to an unbearable climax.  It's urbane and clever, a yuppified Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf in its sensibility.  Plenty of fun references for all the liberal arts major out there.  But beneath all this smart banter is a basic assumption laying the groundwork for cruelty to come.  That is, when we fall in love, we fall in love with the person who we will have shaped out of the person who is before us now.  We don't even see the actual person in front of us; we see what that person might become.In this regard, The Shape Of Things is a ""high concept"" film, because it addresses a clearly defined philosophical problem.  But the great irony here is that almost all of us are ultimately disappointed because efforts to change the objects of our affection are doomed to failure; people simply don't change unless they must.  Thus, the day comes for us when we look across the breakfast table and see the actual person, at last, and most often, that individual is not from royal lineage.  We say goodbye to the imaginary person we thought we could shape, and feel a sense of loss.The dynamic between Adam and Evelyn poses the opposite question - what if you succeeded in shaping a person to your will?  What then?  What would you have gained?  What would be the consequences of such an act, especially the unintended consequences?  It's a fascinating question with many layers of complexity, and LaBute is to be congratulated for raising it in his compact, disciplined film.  All four players come through admirably, Weisz is amazing, and Paul Rudd delivers the goods in a deceptively understated way.  Evelyn's sketchy motives for remaking Adam are clearly the lynch pin of The Shape Of Things, but all the human interactions in this film will get you thinking and keep you thinking.

616239,A28JQL7U33I18P,B00005JMBQ,Ann,"[6, 6]","The Shape of Things is one of those films whose ambition is greater than its achievement.  It clearly provokes thought but to what price?  The film had the potential to be a brilliant exploration of the morality of art and contemporary culture, but as it stands, LaBute's vision is challening, piquant, overly simplistic, and frequently just tonally off.  Still, two days after first seeing this film, I long to revisit what I enjoyed- and like an oddly pleasing pressure point, endure the parts of the film that irked me.The film, based on LaBute's stage play and featuring all the original actors, depicts a metaphorical and artificial conceit owing to such sources as Pygmalion and Genesis.  Without revealing the central conceit, the unraveling of which, may surprise viewers, the plot is as follows: Adam (Paul Rudd) a truly nerdy museum guard meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) an ""art terrorist"" to quote LaBute.  As the relationship progresses, Evelyn gradually persuades Adam to change his appearance and lifestyle.  After getting a nose job (Rudd sports a hilarious prosthetic in the film's first half), several pounds, and a bad haircut, the handsome Rudd as we have come to know him finally emerges in the latter half of the film: the fruit, if you will, of Evelyn's labors.  Jenny (Gretchen Mol) and Philip (Fred Weller)- an engaged couple and Adam's friends- seek to intervene, complicating the plot's outcome.The story is told entirely through these four characters using point-and-shoot setups.  In other words, this film is pure dialogue: rhythmic, intelligent, but inherently artificial and contrived.  Frequently the characters sputtering out these pungent and quirky lines seem more like marionettes to LaBute's writerly wit than thinking, breathing entities.  However, once in a while, LaBute lets the characters overcome the artificiality and emerge as real people.  For instance, when Evelyn and Phil get in a fight about controversial art, the passions ignited between the two is palpable- and hilarious.  Evelyn and Phil felt real in that scene and the fact that they both present their arguments poorly is refreshingly realistic and ambiguous.  Another perfect- and hilarious- moment occurs after Jenny first sees Adam post-rhinoplasty and asks him, concerned and curious, ""How much weight *did* you lose?""  It's moments like these that present LaBute as a genuinely unique voice with an understanding of everyday human behavior.However, the overarching themes that the film raises are frequently undermined by the aforementioned artificiality of the characters.  For instance, how can we, as an audience, accept a treatise on the callousness of modern art- the way it dehumanizes- when LaBute himself fails to effectively present the realities of the human experience?  LaBute has been called ""misanthropic"" for this failure.  I think a more appropriate term would be ""lazy.""  As an artist with a fixed agenda, he should realize that his perception of the world resonates better when it addresses multiple sides of the considered issue.  Up until the weirdly melodramatic last scenes and excepting the intermittently brilliant little scenes, the human element- so critical in understanding Evelyn's perception of art- is all but replaced by the stagy artificiality of marionette puppets in the hands of a witty and angry God.  (If the Adam and Eve reference holds true, then LaBute is surely the God).Perhaps the crowning achievement of The Shape of Things is the way that LaBute elicits a tremendous performance from Rachel Weisz.  An actress sadly known for her soulless blockbusters like The Mummy movies and Constantines, she shows a range of emotion as Evelyn- a darkly ominous restlessness that I found highly engaging and rare.  She's alternately sympathetic and contemptible, sometimes at the same time.  Weisz also happens to pull off what seems to be one of the most contrived and ridiculous endings ever- LaBute's weakest moment as a director.  Rudd, Weller, and Mol all shine in their roles, but it is Weisz who most transcends her director's artificiality and achieves something that, ironically, her character most dismisses: humanity.",4,disjointed but interesting and well-acted esp by weisz,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,4169,"['Shape', 'Things', 'one', 'films', 'ambition', 'greater', 'achievement', 'clearly', 'thought', 'what', 'price', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'brilliant', 'exploration', 'morality', 'art', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'LaBute', 'vision', 'challening', 'piquant', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'frequently', 'just', 'tonally', 'off', 'Still', 'two', 'days', 'first', 'seeing', 'film', 'long', 'revisit', 'what', 'enjoyed-', 'oddly', 'pleasing', 'pressure', 'point', 'endure', 'parts', 'film', 'irked', 'me.The', 'film', 'based', 'LaBute', 'stage', 'play', 'featuring', 'original', 'actors', 'metaphorical', 'artificial', 'conceit', 'owing', 'such', 'sources', 'Pygmalion', 'Genesis', 'revealing', 'central', 'conceit', 'unraveling', 'may', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'plot', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'truly', 'nerdy', 'museum', 'guard', 'meets', 'Evelyn', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'art', 'terrorist', 'quote', 'LaBute', 'relationship', 'Evelyn', 'gradually', 'Adam', 'change', 'appearance', 'lifestyle', 'getting', 'nose', 'job', 'Rudd', 'sports', 'hilarious', 'prosthetic', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'several', 'pounds', 'bad', 'haircut', 'handsome', 'Rudd', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'finally', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'fruit', 'will', 'Evelyn', 'labors', 'Jenny', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Philip', 'Fred', 'Weller', 'engaged', 'couple', 'Adam', 'friends-', 'seek', 'intervene', 'complicating', 'plot', 'outcome.The', 'story', 'told', 'entirely', 'four', 'characters', 'using', 'point-and-shoot', 'setups', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'pure', 'dialogue', 'rhythmic', 'intelligent', 'inherently', 'artificial', 'contrived', 'Frequently', 'characters', 'sputtering', 'pungent', 'quirky', 'lines', 'seem', 'more', 'like', 'marionettes', 'LaBute', 'writerly', 'wit', 'thinking', 'breathing', 'entities', 'However', 'once', 'while', 'LaBute', 'characters', 'overcome', 'artificiality', 'emerge', 'real', 'people', 'instance', 'when', 'Evelyn', 'Phil', 'get', 'fight', 'controversial', 'art', 'passions', 'ignited', 'two', 'palpable-', 'hilarious', 'Evelyn', 'Phil', 'felt', 'real', 'scene', 'fact', 'present', 'arguments', 'poorly', 'refreshingly', 'realistic', 'ambiguous', 'perfect-', 'hilarious-', 'moment', 'occurs', 'Jenny', 'first', 'Adam', 'post-rhinoplasty', 'concerned', 'curious', 'How', 'much', 'weight', '*did*', 'lose', 'moments', 'present', 'LaBute', 'genuinely', 'unique', 'voice', 'understanding', 'everyday', 'human', 'behavior.However', 'overarching', 'themes', 'film', 'raises', 'are', 'frequently', 'undermined', 'aforementioned', 'artificiality', 'characters', 'instance', 'how', 'can', 'audience', 'accept', 'treatise', 'callousness', 'modern', 'art-', 'way', 'dehumanizes-', 'when', 'LaBute', 'effectively', 'present', 'realities', 'human', 'experience', 'LaBute', 'been', 'called', 'misanthropic', 'failure', 'think', 'more', 'appropriate', 'term', 'would', 'be', 'lazy', 'artist', 'fixed', 'agenda', 'should', 'realize', 'perception', 'world', 'better', 'when', 'multiple', 'sides', 'considered', 'issue', 'weirdly', 'melodramatic', 'last', 'scenes', 'excepting', 'intermittently', 'brilliant', 'little', 'scenes', 'human', 'element-', 'so', 'critical', 'understanding', 'Evelyn', 'perception', 'art-', 'replaced', 'stagy', 'artificiality', 'marionette', 'puppets', 'hands', 'witty', 'angry', 'God', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'reference', 'true', 'then', 'LaBute', 'surely', 'God', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Shape', 'Things', 'way', 'LaBute', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'actress', 'sadly', 'known', 'soulless', 'blockbusters', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'Constantines', 'range', 'emotion', 'Evelyn-', 'darkly', 'ominous', 'restlessness', 'found', 'highly', 'engaging', 'rare', 'alternately', 'sympathetic', 'contemptible', 'sometimes', 'same', 'time', 'Weisz', 'also', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'contrived', 'ridiculous', 'endings', 'ever-', 'LaBute', 'weakest', 'moment', 'director', 'Rudd', 'Weller', 'Mol', 'shine', 'roles', 'Weisz', 'who', 'most', 'director', 'artificiality', 'something', 'ironically', 'character', 'most', 'dismisses', 'humanity']",The Shape of Things

616243,A109GUGWXC0KIT,B00005JMBQ,"David Hampton ""The St Paul Kid""","[0, 0]","Interesting yet true look at relationships is probably the best film we have had on the subject in a very long time. The topics raise are true in a lot of ways and it does require multiply viewing just to understand the underlying message that Neil Labute its trying to say. Its very easy to say that what Evelyn did to Adam was wrong but in essence if you saw the movie little more closely, you would have notice the fact that she had told Adam numerous time on what she was up to. So Evelyn is really not that responsible for the outcome of the film, and Adam is not as innocent as some might think he was. He did after all let her to it to him, and he did it willingly, despite the warnings and the hints she gave him.  So to put it in a better perspective, the only honest character in the whole film was in fact Evelyn, and that is because you knew where she stood. The other characters in the film ether lived in denial or just did not know what they really wanted.The acting in this film is a major factor, and the entire cast should be commented for their great performances. Paul Rudd gave a tight woven performance that walked the balance between innocents and desire. You root for Adam and feel sorry for him but deep down, you know that he was asking for the betrayal, and deep down you know that he somewhat deserved it. Gretchen Mol is fantastic as Jenny, the woman who had her eye on Adam since the beginning and is more attracted to him now since his makeover. Her performance is a contrast of character and emotions because while she desire Adam, she also wants to believe that her boyfriend Phillip can change, despite the fact that he will not. Frederick Weller is great as Phillip, a man torn between his own macho ego and his own insecurities. He wants to protect Adam from Evelyn but he is doing it more out of fear than friendship, even though his heart may be in the right place. He portrays the right amount of macho grace but lying beneath lies an insecurity that he wants to keep hidden. The best performance out of the entire cast belongs to Rachel Weisz, who brings a raw and uninhibited sense of independence to her role as Evelyn. She walks a fine line between rebellion and insecurity, displaying Evelyn's own strength and weakness in full view of the audience. Her role is the riskiest one of all and the most dangerous, especially in the last act where her speech to the audience is not only the pay off of the entire movie but a real look at a character who is emotionally damage in every sense of the word. Rachel Weisz is an extraordinary actress with uncanny talent, and she brings out the best in every movie she has ever done. She is simply amazing in this film, and her performance in this film will go down as one of the best performances I have ever seen an actor do in a film.Neil Labute has an eye on the ugliness of the Human spirit, but if you look closely at his work, you would notice that he is simply warning people of the evil that we can inflict on others and ourselves.

The film is about a different perspective, thinking outside the box, the meaning of things subjective versus a collective reality.

You cannot annihilate your audience, then expect them to love you and your work when you show them how stupid and uninformed you think they are. That's pretty narrow-minded, and is anything but artistic.How easy it must be to think you have all the answers, to be able to force-feed your perspective and walk away feeling superior, whether or not you are agreed with.It's offensive.

In THE SHAPE OF THINGS he has transferred his four character play (using the original actors) to the screen without resorting to a lot of cinematic chicanery to alter his message about art imitating life imitating art.  Though the dialogue feels stilted in the beginning (the ending of the story is so well concealed that we the audience are literally part of the charade), LaBute guides his quartet of actors through vignettes that trap us deeper and deeper into the jolting ending with phenomenal ease.  Rachel Weisz is the guiding charlatan on this adventure and her willing model is Paul Rudd, believably undergoing the transformation from an overweight nerd into a fit and classy man about campus (the college of scene is aptly named 'Mercy College').  The unknowing other 'players' in this tale are Gretchen Mol and Frederick Weller who add a dimension of reality to the progressing project.  In the end we understand that we have been witnessing the dark side of comedy and we are left with the question &quot;What constitutes Art?&quot; - and it is at this point that we wish we could return to the beginning and fully appreciate just how fine is LaBute's writing.

From reading about his other movies, those who are fans of his would be more likely to see it coming I imagine!The basic story involves only four characters and from what I've read, is adapted from a 4-person play which explains a lot of the extended scenes.  Adam (Paul Rudd) is an overweight nerd who works in a museum.  When Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) comes in and attempts to deface a statue's genitalia, the two meet.  Adam is immediately smitten and is surprised when the beautiful, artsy Evelyn flirts with him.  The two begin a relationship and Evelyn steadily begins to change things about Adam.  At first, she just gets him to change his hair style and start jogging.  The changes get steadily larger and include getting plastic surgery on his nose, getting rid of his favorite jacket and him getting a tattoo of her initials.  She also gets him to ditch his best friends, engaged couple Phillip and Jenny (Frederick Weller and Gretchen Mol).While I say I wasn't prepared for the shocking conclusion, I did realize soon in to the film exactly what Evelyn was up to.  I was expecting there to be some sort of twist to it that would make Adam wise up to her, but there wasn't any of that.  I was a little disappointed because it seemed way too obvious what Evelyn was going to do.  Also, the way the ending was pulled off was a little awkward and stiff.  The rest of the movie was much better, I don't think the ending did it justice.Overall the acting in the film was good, the only complaint I would have is Frederick Weller was a little over the top with his character.  There are some scenes, especially the one in the park between Adam and Jenny, that were obviously shot in one take, which is impressive!  Rarely do you see a 10-15 minute scene done in one long take anymore.  The film was shot in very few locations, I think only around ten.  I'm assuming this is because it was originally a play, it wasn't meant to have dozens of sets.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 1]","Some people may not feel this movie the same way others do, as it seems to be a Conversationalist film and not a so much the college love story you may expect. At first it definitely does feel like love is brewing between the two main characters but after a while it loses the love and gains a ton of drama. The best thing about The Shape of things is that after a little bit of time the film becomes unpredictable. This movie is filled with talk and even ends in a lot of talk but it is more interesting than boring and you get hooked to see where the story is going.Adam (Paul Rudd) meets his future girlfriend Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) in the museum he works security. Unfortunately they meet while Evelyn is closing in on a very important sculpture but the can of spray paint in her hand lets Adam know she's not there for a closer look. Now I figure that trouble is coming but the two are almost perfect for each other and they settle for a number exchange. Evelyn is a loud and sometimes obnoxious art soldier and loves anything she can do to make a statement. Paul on the other hand is a nice, calm, and shy guy or geek. Paul's two friends Phillip and Jenny who are engaged give the story that gigantic load of drama it needed to keep the viewer interested.The four-man cast does a great job making you believe that love or some affection is involved between them but the mystery is who actually loves each other. The genius in the Shape of Things though lies within the belief that one thing is going on and then bam your hit with an unexpected ending and a nicely done performance from Rachel Weisz. She never gives off the secret that she's hiding from her new boyfriend.This is a movie not only about well kept secrets but psycho girls willing to do anything to get what they want, dishonesty, betrayal, an unlikely love, and most astonishing humiliation for a good grade on an art project. Though to some this film would seem to be unoriginal it was very well done. The style that it was made with was very smooth even though it's mostly talk. It's a great movie and I'm sure that girls will enjoy it on almost all levels especially the ending that is sure to destroy any guy and Rachel Weisz definitely nailed the coffin shut. The story tries to get you to wonder why Evelyn is with Adam but the real story and mystery is why she gets him to change so much or her obsession with photographing and taping themselves but eventually she tells you and it makes the movie pretty good.",4,The Shapes Are Diabolical,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,2488,"['people', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'others', 'do', 'be', 'Conversationalist', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'college', 'love', 'story', 'may', 'expect', 'first', 'definitely', 'feel', 'love', 'brewing', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'while', 'love', 'gains', 'ton', 'drama', 'best', 'thing', 'Shape', 'things', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'film', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'filled', 'talk', 'even', 'lot', 'talk', 'more', 'interesting', 'boring', 'get', 'hooked', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'going.Adam', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'future', 'girlfriend', 'Evelyn', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'museum', 'security', 'Unfortunately', 'meet', 'Evelyn', 'closing', 'very', 'important', 'sculpture', 'can', 'spray', 'paint', 'hand', 'Adam', 'know', 'not', 'there', 'closer', 'look', 'Now', 'figure', 'trouble', 'coming', 'two', 'are', 'almost', 'perfect', 'other', 'settle', 'number', 'exchange', 'Evelyn', 'loud', 'sometimes', 'obnoxious', 'art', 'soldier', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'statement', 'Paul', 'other', 'hand', 'nice', 'calm', 'shy', 'guy', 'geek', 'Paul', 'two', 'friends', 'Phillip', 'Jenny', 'who', 'are', 'engaged', 'give', 'story', 'gigantic', 'load', 'drama', 'needed', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested.The', 'four-man', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'love', 'affection', 'involved', 'mystery', 'who', 'actually', 'other', 'genius', 'Shape', 'Things', 'lies', 'belief', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'then', 'bam', 'hit', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'nicely', 'done', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'never', 'secret', 'hiding', 'new', 'boyfriend.This', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'about', 'well', 'kept', 'secrets', 'psycho', 'girls', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'dishonesty', 'betrayal', 'unlikely', 'love', 'most', 'astonishing', 'humiliation', 'good', 'grade', 'art', 'project', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'unoriginal', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'style', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'very', 'smooth', 'even', 'mostly', 'talk', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'girls', 'will', 'enjoy', 'almost', 'levels', 'especially', 'ending', 'sure', 'destroy', 'guy', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'definitely', 'nailed', 'coffin', 'shut', 'story', 'get', 'wonder', 'why', 'Evelyn', 'Adam', 'real', 'story', 'mystery', 'why', 'change', 'so', 'much', 'obsession', 'photographing', 'taping', 'eventually', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good']",The Shape of Things

One day he meets a graduate art student at the gallery where he works and asks her out. She accepts which is a surprise to him since he's slightly overweight, wears glasses, has never had much success with ladies, and she is--in a word--stunning.Soon into their relationship things about Rudd's character start to change. He begins working out, dressing better, and starts to consider cosmetic surgery. In direct proportion to how much time he spends with his artistic, creative, and beautiful girlfriend he starts to see more of these qualities in himself. In fact, so much so that he's willing to sacrifice his friendships to become closer to her. Then comes the day that her final art project is revealed and Rudd begins to question the validity of their entire relationship.This was one of those films that makes you not want to be around people because you can't help but think that everyone might be as unfeeling and uncaring as some of the characters in this film. To put someone else's feelings and wellbeing in jeopardy for the sake of one's own art is incomprehensible to me... and fascinating to watch. The Shape of Things is one of those films that makes you think about things and is therefore, in my opinion, worthwhile. Like Voltaire once said, ""I may not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.""  I hate the message that this film presents. I hate the bleak picture it paints for the state of people's emotions and the way that people can overlook the bounds of common courtesy for their own selfish ends. But that being said, I understand that it happens every day, and this film does a great job of portraying the banality of human thoughtlessness.I think it's also important to watch the introduction to the film by director Neil LaBute that's included as one of the DVD extras.

616258,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00005JMBQ,Lleu Christopher,"[9, 14]","The Shape of Things is based on a play, which is one strike against it from the start. Neil Labute, in adapting it for the screen, scarcely makes it into a movie at all, with the same four characters running into each other in various unpopulated and nondescript settings and having long conversations. For the first three-quarters of the film I felt like I was watching some kind of improvisational exercise from an acting class. Then, around the last twenty minutes, we find out that the movie is actually about something. This reverses the usual flow of bad-to-mediocre movies, where the high concept usually runs out of steam around the middle and the end is a complete disaster. The end of The Shape of Things is actually quite interesting, though this cannot redeem the tedium of the beginning and middle. Paul Rudd plays Adam, a nerdy museum guard who meets the attractive and enigmatic Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), a graduate art student who is about to deface a musuem sculpture. This opening scene sets the stage for most of the film; it is drawn out and talky and the actors don't succeed in conveying that they are really involved in what's going on; Evelyn doesn't seem like a fanatical avant-garde artist about to commit a crime and Adam doesn't seem especially concerned. They seem, rather, like two actors improvising dialogue that might be spoken in such a situation. The introduction of Adam's friend Phillip (Frederick Weller) and Phillip's fiancee Jenny (Gretchen Mol) mainly gives the film about an hour's worth of dialogue and superfluous (as far as the real theme is concerned) activity. Evelyn and Phillip hate each other but might actually be attracted to each other; Adam and Jenny are attracted to each other; Phillip finds out that Adam and Jenny have kissed so Phillip and Adam have a long talk; Jenny and Evelyn have a long talk...yawn. Meanwhile, Evelyn is gradually getting Adam to make all kinds of little and not so little changes in his life, from his hairstyle to his clothes. Like Labute's prior film, In the Company of Men, The Shape of Things explores the manipulation and deviousness that often characterize relationships. The problem with the present film is that it takes way too long to reveal what it's really about and sidetracks us with too many unnecessary diversions. The film actually raises some fascinating questions (again, not till the very end) about the relationship between art and real life. Finally, it asks whether the artist is some kind of Nietzschean being who is above morality. I only wish more of the film focused on these questions.",2,"High concept, poor execution",1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,2592,"['Shape', 'Things', 'based', 'play', 'one', 'strike', 'start', 'Neil', 'Labute', 'adapting', 'screen', 'scarcely', 'movie', 'same', 'four', 'characters', 'running', 'other', 'various', 'unpopulated', 'nondescript', 'settings', 'having', 'long', 'conversations', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'kind', 'improvisational', 'exercise', 'acting', 'class', 'Then', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'find', 'out', 'movie', 'actually', 'something', 'usual', 'flow', 'bad-to-mediocre', 'movies', 'where', 'high', 'concept', 'usually', 'steam', 'middle', 'end', 'complete', 'disaster', 'end', 'Shape', 'Things', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'can', 'not', 'redeem', 'tedium', 'beginning', 'middle', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Adam', 'nerdy', 'museum', 'guard', 'who', 'attractive', 'enigmatic', 'Evelyn', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'graduate', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'deface', 'musuem', 'sculpture', 'opening', 'scene', 'stage', 'most', 'film', 'drawn', 'out', 'talky', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'conveying', 'are', 'really', 'involved', 'what', 'going', 'Evelyn', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fanatical', 'avant-garde', 'artist', 'commit', 'crime', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'seem', 'especially', 'concerned', 'seem', 'rather', 'two', 'actors', 'improvising', 'dialogue', 'might', 'be', 'spoken', 'such', 'situation', 'introduction', 'Adam', 'friend', 'Phillip', 'Frederick', 'Weller', 'Phillip', 'fiancee', 'Jenny', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'mainly', 'film', 'hour', 'worth', 'dialogue', 'superfluous', 'as', 'far', 'real', 'theme', 'concerned', 'activity', 'Evelyn', 'Phillip', 'hate', 'other', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'attracted', 'other', 'Adam', 'Jenny', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'Phillip', 'out', 'Adam', 'Jenny', 'have', 'kissed', 'so', 'Phillip', 'Adam', 'have', 'long', 'talk', 'Jenny', 'Evelyn', 'have', 'long', 'talk', 'yawn', 'Meanwhile', 'Evelyn', 'gradually', 'getting', 'Adam', 'make', 'kinds', 'little', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'changes', 'life', 'hairstyle', 'clothes', 'Labute', 'prior', 'film', 'Company', 'Men', 'Shape', 'Things', 'manipulation', 'deviousness', 'often', 'characterize', 'relationships', 'problem', 'present', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'reveal', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'sidetracks', 'too', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'diversions', 'film', 'actually', 'fascinating', 'questions', 'again', 'not', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'relationship', 'art', 'real', 'life', 'Finally', 'artist', 'kind', 'Nietzschean', 'being', 'who', 'morality', 'only', 'wish', 'more', 'film', 'focused', 'questions']",The Shape of Things

After fifteen minutes I could saw that she was extremely bored, so I stopped the ""tape"" (because in this DivX days tape is at all used any more) and asked her what happened.  ""It's a boring movie"", she said, ""and the boy is really not cute"".  She was conditioned to think that in an American movie with a male and female character the two of them must be attractive.  She looked at the surface, at the shape of things.  Would she die of horror if she had seen the end?  I doubt so.  The human kind has a considerable capacity for cover what nobody should seen or thought of.Neil LaBute wrote a theorem for the stage, and translated (effectively I must add) to the screen.  Each gesture and line from his four actors is refined with the assurance that only months of rehearsal can give.  I could not think of another way to convey to the broad public, or at least to the segments of them that wants to chew thought food, this piece of existential question that the one LaBute choose.  With static settings and nuanced camerawork the attention drifts toward what each character does, what he says and how he says it.  The movie is constructed in a number of scenes joined by slices of Elvis Costello music that refers to the plot.And what is it?  Boy meets girl, girl has a great influence over him.  Like a teenager comedy from the eighties.  And without a twist.  If you read other reviews, they would tell you that a wicked twirl of a regular plot awaits you.  But the truth is that LaBute decided to play with the silenced consequences of devotion in the love game.  And they aren't a deviation from the regular portray of romance in movies but only the result of a little bit of interest in the moral results of it.  In a romantic unbalanced couple there is always one that dominates.  The question is if everything that derive from this domination is justified in the name of love.  LaBute uses art instead of love, because the last one is too much integrated in our thinking like a big justifier that could cover all moral ambivalence.  But art, in my opinion, is only here a proxy.LaBute has been compared to Todd Solonz in his cold treatment of human relationships and hypocrisy.  But if Solondz goes for a shock that always pays off, LaBute thinks in terms of an idea surrounded by little examples about it.  That sometimes goes wrong (as in ""Your Friends & Neighbours"") and sometimes goes well (like here).  The obsession and conformity with the surface, our ""immoral"" behavior, betraying friends (that tries to correct misfortunes but goes berserk and is paid for later), the question about our goodness, all are there in those two LaBute movies.""The Shape of Things"" is more streamlined, more energetic in his dialogs, better of the same.

For some, these are aspects of life and relationships best not explored in films. For all others, there is Neil LaBute, a writer/director who's fearless when it comes to exploring the darker side of human nature. LaBute exploded onto the scene in 1997 with the controversial ""In The Company Of Men,"" a film about two young men who play a devastatingly cruel trick on a deaf female coworker. Subsequent efforts such as ""Your Friends And Neighbors"" and ""Nurse Betty"" showed LaBute continuing to push the envelope while enlisting A-list actors such as Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger and Ben Stiller.""The Shape Of Things"" shows LaBute at the top of his game. Paul Rudd plays Adam, a shy, nerdy college student who works part-time at a local museum. While working one day he meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), an attractive graduate art student who surprisingly takes a liking to Adam. The two begin seeing each other, later embarking on an ill-fated double date with Adam's former roommate Philip (Fred Weller), a cocky jock who delights in mocking Adam; and Jenny (Gretchen Mol), a fellow student who the gregarious Philip ""stole"" from Adam.Before long, Adam has fallen hard for Evelyn, who fulfills his every sexual desire and slowly begins transforming his physical appearance. She changes his hair, gets him to lose weight via a new running regiment, overhauls his wardrobe and more. As Adam's physical transformation progresses, he changes emotionally as well, gaining a newfound sense of confidence. His new demeanor catches the attention of Jenny, and flirtation ensues. From there the games of deception begin, and it all builds to a brutal climax in which more than one character experiences the ultimate in humiliation.It sounds like the potential stuff of soap opera. But LaBute is the rare filmmaker who strikes a raw nerve with his words and cinematic style, and he uses the setup to make one stingingly perceptive observation after another about art, humanity, and relationships. The film, adopted from LaBute's play (which starred the same actors) sometimes feels stagy, but with dialogue this sharp, who's complaining?Each actor is standout. Weisz, the most well known of the crew, is surprisingly good, even delivering lengthy monologues about the nature of art with ease, and looking stunning every minute. Rudd, who had a long-running role on ""Friends,"" makes the transformation from nebbish nerd to sharp-dressed stud with impressive ease. Weller also makes a strong impression as the classic slimy-male LaBute character. The solid Mol, another future star, rounds out the impressive cast. My only complaint: Where's LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart, one of the best actors in the biz?Stellar acting aside, the movie belongs to LaBute, who with each of his films continues to show that's he one of the most unique voices in American cinema. It may not be perfect, but it's still exciting to watch LaBute climb out on a limb and take chances.

One problem with this movie is that, despite claims to the contrary, it still comes off like a play, which is what it was originally. Unfortunately, the playwright-director, Neil LaBute, couldn't quite get this to work on the screen. The scenes lack life and perspective. There's also an absence of continuity, which might have been remedied with the use of, say, a musical score or better segues between acts. Instead, there are too many pregnant silences that presumambly would have been filled with the responses from a live audience,  but, since it's not a live play in a theater,  remain- embarrassingly silent. In truth, the character of the production smacks of something David Mamet might do, but it lacks that level of quality- which leads to my other objection: beginning lightly it turns dark and then darker, but not with subtle nuance. Granted, there is a basis to make us curious, and the dialogue contains occasional witty lines. Nonetheless, we're being misled as we also get mauled.  We discover, too late, that we've been given a moral lesson.  It's not that the message itself is disturbing- it's the bombast with which it is ultimately delivered. Even less tolerable is the imbalance along the way- the tedious, laborious journey accompanied by too many annoying instances of rudeness (crudeness). Buried amidst the rubble is a good performance by Rudd, and another by an ill-utilized Gretchen Mol (reminder: I chose this to see more of her). Weisz is also worth mentioning, but she's a bit too (read: VERY)intense. Would her character have behaved this way in real life? Perhaps- but the stark brashness does not seem necessary to make the point. I guess this could be considered interesting, but it's not worth the (uncomfortable) time you'll spend waiting for the ending.

Paul Rudd plays Adam, a dorky security guard that meets an outcast named Evelyn play by the beautiful and extremely talented Rachel Weisz. They begin to go out with each other, and Evelyn begin to change Adam a little at first in his appearance and demeanor. The change slowing gives Adam the confidence he always wanted and the people in his life begins to take notice in the sudden changes in him. Then the way Evelyn continues to change Adam becomes a bit extreme, even going as far as to have him go and get plastic surgery. In true Neil Labute fashion, nothing is what is meant to be, and the reasons for the changes in Adam becomes horrifying clear in the end, and nothing will ever be the same again for him, and the people around him.This is hands down Neil's best movie since In the Company of Men. The only problem I have with the film is the fact that it can't shake off it's stage roots and some of the scenes feel too off key to be real but besides that, its as scary and as disturbing as it's predecessor. Paul Rudd is great as the low maintenance Adam, and he brings a sense of humanity to his role and a sense of mischief as well. Gretchen Mole and Fred Weller are good as his bewildered friends, but It's the phenomenal performance of Rachel Weisz, who blends a sense of danger, insecurity, and deadly smarts in her role of Evelyn that makes this film as powerful as it is. Weisz is down right riveting, and you can not take your eyes off of her. She is so good in fact that in a way, you sympathize with her character, and kind of root for her even when you know deep in your gut that she is up to no good.

This movie felt like a comedy of manners/character ensemble at first and I was looking for fun personality quirks and that kind of detail, but the playwrite was really working towards making a _Statement About Art_, a kind of philosophical Point - something very rare in American cinema. I was surprised - I would expect it more in a French movie.I found it easy to fall for Rachel Weisz myself, and morover I thought the male friend was just a repellent jerk.  So although Rachel was obviously trying to mold him in a certain direction, it felt agreeable and OK because his resistence wasn't very strong and the people and traits he was getting away from were not necessarily a reflection of his true nature. They were personality ticks holding him down. She was improving him.That she turned out to be a strangely uncaring sociopath at the end..well it made sense in hindsight, and it was a good hook to hang a movie around, so I guess this film succeeded on its own terms.

616271,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMBQ,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 9]","'The Shape of Things' has gifted acting talents marred by the self-indulgent director.  I'm talking about Rachel Weisz and Neil LaBute, and if you love Ms. Weisz, anyway you like the film, no matter what taste it leaves in your mouth.  One thing is clear; she can act, but has a straneg penchant for selecting the wrong project.This film is based on the London stage production (in which Rachel Weisz was in), about four young art college students.  Weisz is sexy and independent-thinking Evelyn, who meets an unassuming, slightly geeky boy Adam (Paul Rudd) in a museum.  After the surprisingly light, casual conversations exchanged between them, they start to date each other.Naturally, it is Evelyn who leads the relations between them, and she changes Adam into a more sophisticated, attractive guy.  As this metamorphosis is going on, Adam's realtions with other friends (and a couple in love with one another) Jenny and Philip begin to be influenced, not always in a favorable way.Neil LaBute loves controversial matters and shows it full-scale.  I don't discuss the ending, or Evelyn's personality, but the origin of the film is too clear.  'The Shape of Things' is an inverted version of 'My Fair Lady' (to which the film refers briefly), and well, the diretor surely made the point.But the film cannot hide its too stagy nature, and more damaging thing is, though the film is impressive in revealing the hidden (so he supposes) motives in our relations, more cool, rational thinking would inevitably lead you to the conclusion that the film's characters are just cyphers.  If you know, directly or indirectly, someone who acts like Evelyn, please raise your hand.  No one?The good thing, and perhaps the only thing for you to see here, is the acting of Rachel Weisz.  Her deft performance makes the character of Evelyn more human than the one found on Mr. LaBute's misguided script, and if you do not believe in the whole 'presentation' (which no college would allow, I am sure), Rachel Weisz barely makes you, giving a realistic touch to the otherwise monsterously incredible character.Again, I say, Rachel Weisz's great acting is the only reason for you to see the film unless you want to see the 'Truths' about the manipulative relations between humans.  No matter how these views in the film are distorted by someone's 'original' visions, her acting talent is a genuine one.",3,"Rachel Weisz Is Great, The (Awfully Nasty & Stagy) Film Not",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,2386,"[""'The"", 'Shape', 'Things', 'gifted', 'acting', 'talents', 'marred', 'self-indulgent', 'director', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'love', 'Ms.', 'Weisz', 'anyway', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'mouth', 'One', 'thing', 'clear', 'can', 'act', 'straneg', 'penchant', 'selecting', 'wrong', 'project.This', 'film', 'based', 'London', 'stage', 'production', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'was', 'about', 'four', 'young', 'art', 'college', 'students', 'Weisz', 'sexy', 'independent-thinking', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'unassuming', 'slightly', 'geeky', 'boy', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'museum', 'surprisingly', 'light', 'casual', 'conversations', 'exchanged', 'start', 'date', 'other.Naturally', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'relations', 'Adam', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'attractive', 'guy', 'metamorphosis', 'going', 'Adam', 'realtions', 'other', 'friends', 'couple', 'love', 'one', 'Jenny', 'Philip', 'begin', 'be', 'influenced', 'not', 'always', 'favorable', 'way.Neil', 'LaBute', 'controversial', 'matters', 'full-scale', 'do', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'ending', 'Evelyn', 'personality', 'origin', 'film', 'too', 'clear', ""'The"", 'Shape', 'Things', 'inverted', 'version', ""'My"", 'Fair', 'Lady', 'film', 'refers', 'briefly', 'well', 'diretor', 'surely', 'made', 'point.But', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'too', 'stagy', 'nature', 'more', 'damaging', 'thing', 'film', 'impressive', 'revealing', 'hidden', 'motives', 'relations', 'more', 'cool', 'rational', 'thinking', 'would', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'cyphers', 'know', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'someone', 'who', 'Evelyn', 'please', 'raise', 'hand', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'see', 'here', 'acting', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'deft', 'performance', 'character', 'Evelyn', 'more', 'human', 'one', 'found', 'Mr.', 'LaBute', 'misguided', 'script', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'whole', ""'presentation"", 'college', 'would', 'allow', 'am', 'sure', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'barely', 'giving', 'realistic', 'touch', 'otherwise', 'monsterously', 'incredible', 'character.Again', 'say', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'great', 'acting', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'want', 'see', ""'Truths"", 'manipulative', 'relations', 'humans', 'matter', 'how', 'views', 'film', 'are', 'distorted', 'someone', ""'original"", 'visions', 'acting', 'talent', 'genuine', 'one']",The Shape of Things
