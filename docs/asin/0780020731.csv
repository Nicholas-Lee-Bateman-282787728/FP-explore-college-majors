24974,AAZRWLML88IZK,0780020731,A kids review,"[2, 2]","I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not at all interested in anything in between. Francois TruffautFrancois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" is one of the most intensely touching stories ever made about a young adolescent. Inspired by Truffaut's own early life, it shows a resourceful boy growing up in Paris and apparently dashing headlong into a life of crime. Adults see him as a troublemaker. We are allowed to share some of his private moments, as when he lights a candle before a little shrine to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking directly into the camera. He has just run away from a house of detention, and is on the beach, caught between land and water, between past and future. It is the first time he has seen the sea.Antoine Doinel was played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who has a kind of solemn detachment, as if his heart had suffered obscure wounds long before the film began. This was the first in a long collaboration between actor and director; they returned to the character in the short film ""Antoine and Collette"" and three more features: ""Stolen Kisses"", ""Bed and Board"" and ""Love on the Run""The later films have their own merits, and ""Stolen Kisses"" is one of Truffaut's best, but ""The 400 Blows,"" with all its simplicity and feeling, is in a class by itself. It was Truffaut's first feature, and one of the founding films of the French New Wave. We sense that it was drawn directly out of Truffaut's heart. It is dedicated to Andre Bazin, the influential French film critic who took the fatherless Truffaut under his arm at a time when the young man seemed to stand between life as a filmmaker and life in trouble.Little is done in the film for pure effect. Everything adds to the impact of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with his mother and stepfather in a crowded walkup where they always seem to be squeezing out of each other's way. The mother is a blond who likes tight sweaters and is distracted by poverty, by her bothersome son, and by an affair with a man from work. The stepfather is a nice enough sort, easy-going, and treats the boy in a friendly fashion although he is not deeply attached to him. Both parents are away from home a lot, and neither has the patience to pay close attention to the boy: They judge him by appearances, and by the reports of others who misunderstand him.At school, Antoine has been typecast by his teacher as a troublemaker. His luck is not good. When a pinup calendar is being passed from hand to hand, his is the hand the teacher finds it in. Sent to stand in the corner, he makes faces for his classmates and writes a lament on the wall. The teacher orders him to decline his offending sentence, as punishment. His homework is interrupted. Rather than return to school without it, he skips. His excuse is that he was sick. After his next absence, he says his mother has died. When she turns up at his school, alive and furious, he is marked as a liar.And yet we see him in the alcove that serves as his bedroom, deeply wrapped in the work of Balzac, whose chronicles of daily life helped to create France's idea of itself. He loves Balzac. He loves him so well, indeed, that when he's assigned to write an essay on an important event in his life, he describes ""the death of my grandfather'' in a close paraphrase of Balzac, whose words have lodged in his memory. This is seen not as homage but as plagiarism, and leads to more trouble and eventually to a downward spiral: He and a friend steal a typewriter, he gets caught trying to return it and is sent to the juvenile detention home.The film's most poignant moments show him set adrift by his parents and left to the mercy of social services. His parents discuss him sadly with authorities as a lost cause. And so he is booked in a police station, placed in a holding cell and put in a police wagon with prostitutes and thieves, to be driven through the dark streets of Paris, his face peering out through the bars like a young Dickensian hero. He has a similar expression at other times in the film, which is shot in black and white in Paris in a chill season; Antoine always has the collar of his jacket turned up against the wind.Truffaut's film is not a dirge or entirely a tragedy. There are moments of fun and joy. One priceless sequence, shot looking down from above the street, shows a physical education teacher leading the boys on a jog through Paris; two by two they peel off, until the teacher is at the head of a line of only two or three boys. The happiest moment in the film comes after one of Antoine's foolish mistakes. He lights a candle to Balzac, which sets the little cardboard shrine on fire. His parents put out the flames, but then for once their exasperation turns to forgiveness, and the whole family goes to the movies and laughs on the way home.There is a lot of moviegoing in ""The 400 Blows,'' with Antoine's solemn face turned up to the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself escaped to the movies whenever he could, and there is a shot here that he quotes later in his career. As Antoine and a friend emerge from a cinema, Antoine steals one of the lobby photos of a star. In ""Day for Night'', which stars Truffaut himself as a film director, there is a flashback memory to the character, as a boy, stealing down a dark street to snatch a still of ""Citizen Kane"" from in front of a theater.The cinema saved Francois Truffaut's life, he said again and again. It took a delinquent student and gave him something to love, and with the encouragement of Bazin he became a critic and then made this film by his 27th birthday. If the New Wave marks the dividing point between classic and modern cinema, then Truffaut is likely the most beloved of modern directors -- the one whose films resonated with the deepest, richest love of moviemaking. He liked to resurrect old effects and pay tribute.Truffaut died too young, of a brain tumor, at 52, but he left behind 21 films, not counting shorts and screenplays. His ""Small Change"" returns to the sharply remembered world of the classroom, to students younger than Doinel, and recalls the almost unbearable tension as the clock on the wall creeps toward the final bell. Even while directing a film a year, he found time to write about other films and directors, and did a classic book-length, film-by-film interview with Hitchcock.One of his most curious, haunting films is ""The Green Room"", based on the Henry James story ""The Altar of the Dead,"" about a man and a woman who share a passion for remembering their dead loved ones. Jonathan Rosenbaum, who thinks ""The Green Room"" may be Truffaut's best film, has said he thinks of it as the director's homage to the auteur theory. That theory, created by Bazin and his disciples, declared that the director was the true author of a film -- not the studio, the screenwriter, the star, the genre. If the figures in the green room stand for the great directors of the past, perhaps there is a shrine there now to Truffaut. One likes to think of the ghost of Antoine Doinel lighting a candle before it.",5,The 400 blows,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,7202,"['demand', 'film', 'express', 'joy', 'making', 'cinema', 'agony',

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[7, 7]","The movie announced the talent of Francois Truffaut and still makes a powerful impact 50 years later.We follow the life of Antoine, a 13-year-old Parisian kid with a knack of getting himself into trouble. He's persecuted in turn by his stupid French literature teacher, his adoptive father and his cold, neglectful mother and winds up in a juvenile institution after stealing a typewriter from his father's office, failing to sell it and getting caught trying to return it.Antoine is basically not a bad kid but each petty lie and immature stunt gets him deeper and deeper into trouble from a system that seems capable only of punishing and never of understanding him.We learn that Antoine's mother never wanted him and sees him as a nuisance and a burden; that his adoptive father has no real investment in his success and that the authority figures he meets are interested only in processing him and never relate to him as a person.This movie is full of exuberant cinemagraphic moments: the camera swoops up and down like a bird watching a clueless teacher taking his class for exercise and having the kids run off behind his back one by one. Antoine and his friend emerge from the Metro and a flock of pigeons explodes into the air. Antoine spends the night alone, surrounded by the cold, unfeeling statues of the Tuileries Gardens.One notable aspect: every single adult in this movie is an idiot and most are also casually cruel.The message of this humanistic film is that children need love to thrive.

24976,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0780020731,Alex Udvary,"[3, 3]","""400 Blows"" was Francois Truffaut's debut film, and it remains in my opinion, his best film. That right there is saying a lot considering this is the same man who directed films like, ""The Last Metro"", ""Love on the Run"",""The Wild Child"", & ""The Soft Skin"". 1959 was a year when America became exposed to the ""French new wave"" when such directors like Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette were dazzling audiences with their views on love and life and there ""new style"" of filmmaking that has influenced many American filmmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen.Truffaut's semi-autobiography, is one of those rare films that can make of laugh and cry. Truffaut examines issuses that we can all relate to. There's that human dramatic element needed to make a great drama what it is.""400 Blows"" was the first film in the ""Antoine Doinel"" series, which included films like ""Stolen Kisses"",""Bed & Board"" and ""Love on the Run"". It was also the first film for it's star, Jean-Pierre Leaud. Who even as a child seemed to show amazing acting skills.But, what do we all really love about this film? I guess it's that we can all connect with it's lead character. We can all think back to when we were younger and perhaps felt exactly the same way Antoine does in this film. This is one of those movies that puts our own feelings on screen and confront issusses we normally shy away from dealing with.""400 Blows"" was the first film I ever saw by Truffaut and as time has gone on, he is now one of my all time favorite directors. I think if anyone wants to start a collection of Truffaut films this is the place to start.

24977,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,0780020731,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[5, 5]","THE 400 BLOWS was an international sensation when first released in 1959, and with good reason.  This film has the objectivity and immediacy of a documentary but with the passion and social realism of OLIVER TWIST and the charm of Jean Constantin's vibrant music for jazz flute, which it incorporates brilliantly.  Not to mention that the performances are top-notch and the direction, handled with masterly assurance, succeeds equally whether in kitchen-sink close up or in Truffaut's magnificent crane shots of workaday Paris.  That this all fits together so well -- and for a rookie director, Francois Truffaut -- seems no less a miracle now than it was back then.The story focuses on young Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a kid from a working-class Paris neighborhood, who has to contend with bickering and aloof parents, schooling where regimentation seems an end to itself, a grind of a home life and a chronic lack of money.  A plot precis doesn't do justice to Antoine's story, which would chart the boy's descent from disaffected pre-adolesent schoolboy to (in society's eyes, at any rate) budding criminal.  Yet Truffaut handles Antoine -- a near-copy of his young self -- with a sympathy that communicates very well to us in the audience.  He ends the film on a hopeful if ambiguous note.I can unqualifiedly recommend this seminal film, which remains so fresh even to this day.  I am a little reluctant to insist on the new ART HOUSE ESSENTIAL edition for sale here, because the CRITERION COLLECTION version, also available through Amazon, costs (as of this writing) only US$2.50 more, has multiple bells-and-whistles, and includes two commentary tracks, one by a film scholar and one by Truffaut's best friend from childhood.  I am not favoring one competitor over another because JANUS - CRITERION and ""Art House"" are all the same company.  In the absence of company specs to the contrary, the ART HOUSE version seems to lack those enlightening extras.  But it does not alter my five-star rating.One small semantic note -- it would be logical to assume that ""400 blows"" refers to corporal punishment, which would be a literal translation from the French.  Instead, it's a French idiom that means more along the lines of ""raise some hell"" or ""sow wild oats,"" a far less violent and sympathetic understanding of the phrase.

Maybe, I identify with our main character and his exploits all too well. During the movie I found myself 'musing' with my wife about doing the same kinda stuff when I was a child. I thought it remarkable that these children found so many ways to be conniving  and pesky. My smile strectched from ear to ear and at some point I thought that the director must have reflected on personal experience and that he himself was probally a deviant at some point. When the movie closed out with the beach scene I was pleased but somewhat disappointed. I thought the director missed a golden opportunity to use flashback to relate his current adult state to - say, a problem child of his own, thus showing us the circle of life nad though troubled that he wound up OK.

24979,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780020731,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","In all my movie watching and movie reviewing I tend to praise a lot of work.  As you glance over my past reviews (if you so chose to ever do so) you will see a lot of `five-star' or `Grade A' reviews, yet in all honesty there are rarely times when I am so enamored by a film I am moved to claim it a masterpiece.  Sure, I may say that a film is a genre masterpiece (I think I made that claim when speaking of `The Dark Knight') but for a film to transcend genre and become a clear and present masterpiece of film it has to have that extra something that is rarely found in films; that extra connective tissue that links its importance, its soul to our soul and thus becomes a part of us.`Scenes from a Marriage', `8 ', `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'; these are those type of films.You can add `Les Quatre Cents Coups' (The 400 Blows) to that list.  This film is a staggering look at the power of neglect and the affect that it has on those receiving the brunt of its affliction.  Francois Truffaut's visionary debut film rests high on my list of cinematic achievements for it captures the very essence of this tragic life and this young boy's desperate search for love, peace and eventual freedom.The film tells us of young Antoine Doinel.  His mother seems almost irritated with his existence and his step-father, as caring as he may seem, is still merely a step-father.  His behavior in school seems to mirror his unhappiness at home, for he often finds himself acting out for attention as apposed to sitting quietly and paying attention.  Instead of seeking out answers to Antoine's issues, his teacher and his parents only seem concerned with immediate action; discipline.  Even Antoine's seemingly earnest attempts at improvement are degraded and slighted and eventually he finds himself in a reform school after a series of serious lapses in good judgment.What is so moving about `Les Quatre Cents Coups' is the way in which the film is delivered.  This is not an abrasive and deeply emotional film, at least not in the obvious sense.  It is a rather relaxed and almost passive film, a film that simply states the facts without overly dramatic embellishment.  It thus has a lightness that makes the overall impact a little more acceptable.  It's not harsh, as it certainly could have been considering the poignant subject, and it has a very easy and fluid pace that makes the film both engaging and moving.  When you strip away the Hollywood dramatization you find a raw and realistic approach to filmmaking, which is in full effect here.When you take a richly realized script, very delicate and focused direction and a superb performance given by an astonishing young actor (in this case Jean-Pierre Leaud, who was merely fourteen when he landed this amazing role) you are left with a brilliant look at the most intimate aspects of life itself.Yes, `Les Quatre Cents Coups' is a masterpiece.",5,A film that will literally blow you away...,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,2898,"['movie', 'watching', 'movie', 'reviewing', 'tend', 'praise', 'lot', 'work', 'glance', 'past', 'reviews', 'so', 'chose', 'ever', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'five-star', 'Grade', 'A', 'reviews', 'yet', 'honesty', 'are', 'rarely', 'times', 'when', 'am', 'so', 'enamored', 'film', 'am', 'moved', 'claim', 'masterpiece', 'Sure', 'may', 'say', 'film', 'genre', 'masterpiece', 'think', 'made', 'claim', 'when', 'speaking', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'transcend', 'genre', 'become', 'clear', 'present', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'have', 'extra', 'something', 'rarely', 'found', 'films', 'extra', 'connective', 'tissue', 'importance', 'soul', 'soul', 'thus', 'part', 'us.', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', '8', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'are', 'type', 'films.You', 'can', 'add', 'Les', 'Quatre', 'Cents', 'Coups', '400', 'Blows', 'list', 'film', 'staggering', 'look', 'power', 'neglect', 'affect', 'receiving', 'brunt', 'affliction', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'visionary', 'debut', 'film', 'rests', 'high', 'list', 'cinematic', 'achievements', 'very', 'essence', 'tragic', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'desperate', 'search', 'love', 'peace', 'eventual', 'freedom.The', 'film', 'young', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'mother', 'almost', 'irritated', 'existence', 'step-father', 'as', 'caring', 'may', 'seem', 'still', 'merely', 'step-father', 'behavior', 'school', 'mirror', 'unhappiness', 'home', 'often', 'acting', 'out', 'attention', 'apposed', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'paying', 'attention', 'Instead', 'seeking', 'out', 'answers', 'Antoine', 'issues', 'teacher', 'parents', 'only', 'seem', 'concerned', 'immediate', 'action', 'discipline', 'Even', 'Antoine', 'seemingly', 'earnest', 'attempts', 'improvement', 'are', 'degraded', 'slighted', 'eventually', 'reform', 'school', 'series', 'serious', 'lapses', 'good', 'judgment.What', 'so', 'moving', 'Les', 'Quatre', 'Cents', 'Coups', 'way', 'film', 'delivered', 'not', 'abrasive', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'obvious', 'sense', 'rather', 'relaxed', 'almost', 'passive', 'film', 'film', 'simply', 'facts', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'embellishment', 'thus', 'lightness', 'overall', 'impact', 'little', 'more', 'acceptable', 'not', 'harsh', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considering', 'poignant', 'subject', 'very', 'easy', 'fluid', 'pace', 'film', 'engaging', 'moving', 'When', 'strip', 'away', 'Hollywood', 'dramatization', 'find', 'raw', 'realistic', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'full', 'effect', 'here.When', 'take', 'richly', 'realized', 'script', 'very', 'delicate', 'focused', 'direction', 'superb', 'performance', 'given', 'astonishing', 'young', 'actor', 'case', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'who', 'was', 'merely', 'fourteen', 'when', 'landed', 'amazing', 'role', 'are', 'left', 'brilliant', 'look', 'most', 'intimate', 'aspects', 'life', 'itself.Yes', 'Les', 'Quatre', 'Cents', 'Coups', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Two gripes:Your options for tailoring the presentation to suit your needs are limited.  You can have the sound on French with no subtitles or with English subtitles, but that's about it.  There are no subtitles in French or in any other language besides English, and as for the audio tracks, the only other one besides the French is the running Truffaut appreciation by Robert Lachenay, a close friend of Truffaut (done in English).The lack of French subtitles really grates on me, because I'm quite good at French (thank you very much), but not quite so good that I can follow every word of these urchins' slang.  Hence I would appreciate some French subtitles to help bridge the gap when my French isn't up to snuff.  No such luck.  So now I'm stuck with a whole bunch of distracting English, most of which I don't need.The subtitles are in white, with little black borders around the letters.  There are no problems with visibility (as in my previous VHS copy), because the subtitles are printed for the most part beneath the frame line (you're getting the widescreen edition here), although often subtitles do in fact obtrude onto the image itself.Fortunately, the white of the subtitles is a much more blazing white than even the whitest of white images contained in the film.  So at least you don't have that problem.Also: although Criterion Collection has suggested that they have lovingly restored the print, I'm not bowled over.  The picture is obviously much sharper and more detailed than the one you may have been used to on the VHS edition, but to my annoyance specks of dust can plainly be seen gettin' jiggy all over the print right up until the end of the movie.  I'm surprised and disappointed that these were either not cleaned off or fixed digitally before they released this.  Heads should roll!The other mistake I made was not buying the boxed set of five Antoine Doinel films.  Although ""The 400 Blows"" is certainly the most famous, anybody who gets into early Truffaut will inexorably be driven to the others, which I am sorry I do not possess.

I watched a Fellini movie, an Ingmar Bergman and a Francois Truffaut. The Ingmar was rather like reading Cormac McCarthy-great quality but sometimes difficult to understand and just plain sad. The Passion of Anna was bleak and depressing. 8 1/2 by Fellini seemed mad cap, zany, but good. I've read that one needs to view this movie multiple times to understand all the meaning inside the film. My favorite by far was The 400 Blows by Truffaut.Truffaut brings his rough childhood to light in this tale of a young, misunderstood youth with a bad teacher and frustrated but removed parents. This is a survivor's tale with wonderful acting and a story you don't need to go to film school to understand. I read this is a trilogy staring the young man who plays Truffaut and you see Jean-Pierre Leaud grow up in these films which is quite a unique experiment. I look forward to watching the rest of the films. Truffaut has a very honest approach in this film which shows the innocence of youth being looked upon as bad character. This is a very, very good movie.Jean-Pierre Leaud is brilliant in this movie-such talent for being so young. The backdrop of Paris is stunning throughout the movie.

First movie of the director, THE 400 BLOWS, shot in b&amp;w,  presents the first adventures of Antoine Doinel, played by a lunar  Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud. This character will reappear in 4 or 5 other Truffaut  movies during the sixties and the seventies. He is, so to speak, the double  of the director who is able through Antoine Doinel to live a second  (imaginary) life. Quite unique in Movie History.THE 400 BLOWS stands  very well the test of time and can still be considered as a masterpiece 42  years after its theatrical release. Anyway, with Jean Renoir's GRAND  ILLUSION, also a Criterion release, it's the best movie I've seen since the  beginning of the year.Admirable work of Criterion that has understood  that DVDs can be considered as books and deserve the same treatment than  our friends made of paper.A DVD for your library.",5,BIRTH  OF  A  MYTH,966038400,"08 12, 2000",2000,1221,"['years', ""'ve"", 'avoided', 'director', 'Franois', 'Truffaut', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'was', 'perhaps', 'many', 'european', 'movie', 'lovers', 'intimately', 'convinced', 'Cinema', '=', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'maybe', 'unanimous', 'critical', 'adoration', 'surrounding', 'director', 'really', 'little', 'reluctance', 'have', 'decided', 'take', 'look', 'THE', '400', 'BLOWS', 'presented', 'Criterion', 'First', 'movie', 'director', '400', 'BLOWS', 'shot', 'b', 'amp', 'first', 'adventures', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'played', 'lunar', 'Jean-Pierre', 'L', 'eacute', 'aud', 'character', 'will', 'reappear', '4', '5', 'other', 'Truffaut', 'movies', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'so', 'speak', 'double', 'director', 'who', 'able', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'live', 'second', 'imaginary', 'life', 'Quite', 'unique', 'Movie', 'History.THE', '400', 'BLOWS', 'stands', 'very', 'well', 'test', 'time', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'considered', 'masterpiece', '42', 'years', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Anyway', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'GRAND', 'ILLUSION', 'also', 'Criterion', 'release', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'beginning', 'year.Admirable', 'work', 'Criterion', 'understood', 'DVDs', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'books', 'deserve', 'same', 'treatment', 'friends', 'made', 'paper.A', 'DVD', 'library']",N/A
24990,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,0780020731,darragh o'donoghue,"[10, 14]","In terms of plot, 'the 400 Blows' is re-fried neo-realism; the scenes where the adolescent hero Antoine is locked up like an animal and sent to a  borstal, is so manipulative, even de Sica might have balked.  What makes 'Blows' film the masterpiece it is, is Truffaut's style, galvanised by freedom: personal freedom, freedom from the dead French cinema past, freedom from the studio, freedom to break the rules.He doesn't quite do the latter - the film is meticulously classical in its structure - but there is a bracing fresh air throughout, the camera as light and supple as a wave of the hand, Truffaut willing to assert comedy in the most dismal situations, relishing digressions, gags, unexpected bloopers, horseplay.'Blows' is a film about entrapment, but if Antoine is caged and institutionalised, he also finds freedom caged at the funfair, where a zoetrope-like cylinder gives him a new way of looking at the world, just as Truffaut takes cinema back to year zero, starting again, making the world and our eyes new again.  'Blows' makes you feel anything is possible, even if 40 years of formulaic mundanity suggests otherwise.  When Antoine famously runs across a beach, the very sand seems to move under him.  Like the chapter in Joyce's 'Ulysses' it quotes, we are asked to transform a rigid external world with our minds.",5,400 blows for freedom.,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,1335,"['terms', 'plot', '400', 'Blows', 're-fried', 'neo-realism', 'scenes', 'where', 'adolescent', 'hero', 'Antoine', 'locked', 'up', 'animal', 'sent', 'borstal', 'so', 'manipulative', 'even', 'de', 'Sica', 'might', 'have', 'balked', 'What', ""'Blows"", 'film', 'masterpiece', 'Truffaut', 'style', 'galvanised', 'freedom', 'personal', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'dead', 'French', 'cinema', 'past', 'freedom', 'studio', 'freedom', 'break', 'rules.He', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'latter', 'film', 'meticulously', 'classical', 'structure', 'bracing', 'fresh', 'air', 'camera', 'light', 'supple', 'wave', 'hand', 'Truffaut', 'willing', 'assert', 'comedy', 'most', 'dismal', 'situations', 'relishing', 'digressions', 'gags', 'unexpected', 'bloopers', 'horseplay', ""'Blows"", 'film', 'entrapment', 'Antoine', 'caged', 'institutionalised', 'also', 'freedom', 'caged', 'funfair', 'where', 'zoetrope-like', 'cylinder', 'new', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'just', 'Truffaut', 'cinema', 'back', 'year', 'zero', 'starting', 'again', 'making', 'world', 'eyes', 'new', 'again', ""'Blows"", 'feel', 'anything', 'possible', 'even', '40', 'years', 'formulaic', 'mundanity', 'otherwise', 'When', 'Antoine', 'famously', 'beach', 'very', 'sand', 'move', 'chapter', 'Joyce', ""'Ulysses"", 'are', 'asked', 'transform', 'rigid', 'external', 'world', 'minds']",N/A

24992,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0780020731,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[13, 13]","In 1959, Francois Truffaut released a semibiographical film about his life with ""the 4oo blows"" (Les quatre cents coups).  A film highly regarded as a definitive film that showcases French New Wave (a term to describe a group of French filmmakers in the 1950's-1960's that were inspired by classic Hollywood cinema and Italian Neorealism).The film won several awards which include ""Best Director Award"" at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and ""Best Original Screenplay"" at the 32nd Annual Academy Awards.  Needless to say, the film made Francois Truffaut and young actor Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud Internationally known and definitely gave movie fans a taste of the French New Wave film.""the 400 blows"" is the first of five films spanning around 20 years based on the character of Antoine Doinel (played by Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud).  Each film showcases the character's life as a teenager through his 30's but for ""the 400 blows"", the film focuses on the life of a troubled teenager.Although not based 100% on Director Francois Truffaut's real life, a large part of the film was based on his troubled family life and in order for him to capture that life he had, he picked the right person with Jean-Pierre Leaud, an unknown actor (who was just as an antisocial loner) who was 13 and a half years old but had that rebellious nature that Truffaut found.  A boy who would not have to learn a script but to use his his own words.  This added to the realism of the film and what made this film so fantastic and engrossing just to watch.VIDEO & AUDIO:""the 400 blows"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1. Black bars and the top and bottom of the screen are normal for this format and the transfer is much different from the previous DVD release from Criterion years go as this was a high-definition digital transfer cared on a Spirit Datacine form a 35mm composite fine-gain master positive.As with most Criterion Blu-ray releases, the company also had thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.  The picture quality, although in black and white, looks incredible for a film released back in 1959.  Black are nice and deep but you can see a lot more detail in the surroundings.Suffice to say, THE CRITERION COLLECTION releases films with how the director intended the film to be.  There is no DNR (digital noise reduction) and no softness and the film keeps the grain and retains its film-like quality.  The film just looks beautiful on Blu-ray!As for audio, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical soundtrack and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The audio has an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  My Onkyo receiver received a multichannel signal (via bitstream) but overall, I did not select a monaural setting when watching the film but I found the dialog to be clear and understandable.  Music by Jean Constantin was also also clear.Subtitles are featured in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""the 400 blows"" comes with the following special features:* Audio commentary by cinema professor Brian Stonehill - Brian Stonehill's audio commentary is very informative.  This commentary was featured on the original Criterion DVD release and goes into depth about the themes of the film and overall, a solid commentary in which Stonehill also has included interviews with people involved with the film.* Audio commentary by Francois Truffaut's lifelong friend Robert Lachenay - Robert Lachenay is Antoine's Rene.  When they were younger, Truffaut's parents thought he was the bad influence and vice versa.  But these two remained friends for a long time and with Lachenay working as an assistant to the film, we learn about the comparisons of Antoine Doinel and Truffaut. Similarities and differences of what really happened in the life of Director Francois Truffaut.* Audition footage of Jean-Pierre Leaud, Patrick Auffay and Richard Kanayan - (6:24) A short segment featuring rare 16mm screen tests the auditions for the main talents auditioning for the role of Antoine Doinel, Rene and one of the Les Enfants, Richard Kanayan (who appeared in Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player"" in 1960).* Cannes 1959 - (5:51) A short newsreel frim Francois Chalais and JacquesPlanche's ""Reflets de Cannes 1959' of Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud as he goes to Cannes and is interviewed by press and the ovation the film received by the audience.* Cineaste de notre temps - (22:26) This featurette is an excerpt from ""Francois Truffaut ou l'espirit critique"" episode from ""Cineaste de Notre temps"" which was shown in France back in December 2, 1965.  Truffaut discusses his childhood, learning about his passion of watching films, his writing of Cahiers du cinema and the character of Antoine Doinel.  The segment also features interviews with Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud (Antoine), Albert Remy (father) and Claude de Givray (a friend of Truffaut who knew him when he was younger).* Cinepanorama - (6:52)) An excerpt from the TV show ""Cinepanorama"" from February 20, 1960.  The host France Roche interviews Director Francois Truffaut who was awarded for ""Best Foreign Film"" by the New York Film Critics Circle for ""The 400 Blows"".  Director Truffaut talks about how the films reception Internationally and about the film.* Theatrical Trailer - (3:47) The original theatrical trailer for ""the 400 blows"""".* An essay book from film scholar Annette Insdorf - A quad-fold booklet titled ""Close to Home"" with production credits on one side and a two page essay by Columbia University, Professor and Director of Undergraduate Film Studies, Annette Insdorf discussing the similarities of Antoine Dionel and Francois Truffaut.  But also differences and the importance of some shots.JUDGMENT CALL""the 400 blows"" is one of those films that surprised me from beginning to end.  It's not that I haven't seen classic films that seem realistic but I found the film quite enjoyable in the fact that the film really goes indepth in the life of a Parisian youth who does bad things but that the connection between bad/or lack of thereof, parenting can be to blame.Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud is simply fantastic as Antoine Doinel and that is because Director Francois Truffaut allows him to be himself.  As Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud has commented himself, he is very much like Antoine in some respects and he eventually puts his trust in Truffaut to capture his emotion and his focal point through the camera.  If anything, to make this character come out alive and in that sense, Truffaut succeeds and L&eacute;aud is magnificent.Claire Maurier (who plays Antoine's mother Gilberte Doinel) is surprising in her role as a cold mother.  She's one of those mothers who has her life hampered with having a child but tries to live her free life as if she didn't have a child.  There is a strong disconnection between mother and son but how quickly she tries to change when her son catches her with another man.  Claire Maurier does a fine job with her role.  As with Albert Remy as Julien Doinel.  The busy at work father who has more leeway towards Antoine but is not quick to be cold to his son like his mother.  It's just when the trust is broken between father and son, is when you see Julien having to do things that he doesn't want to do and in essence becomes more like his wife.There is a significant reveal at the end of the film of why Antoine does the things that he does but what the film does quite well at is showing how derelict parents can affect a child's behavior.  Letting a child to do what he wants and there are no responsibilities but taking out the garbage.  There is no love in the family and thus, it has a cause and effect towards Antoine.Truffaut is simply a legendary director for helping catapult the French New Wave.  With its similarities to Western classic films and Italian Neorealism in terms of really depicting the life of the poor in France, Truffaut gives us a glimpse of what his life was like.  How he watched films when he ditched from school and just his overall experiences and troubles he had endured.  When he's lying, he is treated badly at home and at school.  When he's telling the truth, there is no difference.  And for any parent, this is a true injustice for a child who needs that motivation that they can prevail, that they are wanted and they can succeed.  And unfortunately, that was not the case for Antoine at 14-years-old.I give THE CRITERION COLLECTION another applause for their treatment of ""the 400 blows"".  Similar to a film like ""THE SEVEN SAMURAI"", although once released, the company went back and gave it a new, restored High-Definition digital transfer with an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.Another awesome release on Blu-ray from THE CRITERION COLLECTION and for those who have never had a taste of French New Wave films, ""the 400 blows"" is definitely a great film to start out with.",5,Blu-ray: An absolutely awesome release on Blu-ray but now I hope Criterion releases the Adventure of Antoine Doinel on Blu...,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,8943,"['1959', 'Francois',

24993,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780020731,Dennis Littrell,"[10, 10]","An idiomatic translation of the French title of this movie, Les quatre cents coup, would be something like ""Raising Hell,"" understood ironically.  Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel, played very winningly by Jean-Pierre Leaud, doesn't suffer ""400 blows,"" although he does get mistreated quite a bit, and he doesn't mean to raise hell or to be a problem to his parents or society.  He's just a boy being a boy.  Unfortunately his mother (Claire Mauier), who is more like a wicked step-mother than the boy's biological mother (although she is that) would like to be rid of him so that she can spend more time pursuing her hobby, which is adultery.  His cuckolded step-father (Albert Remy) is no help, although he seems to care more for the boy than his mother.  And the institutions of society, as represented by his school, the Parisian police, and the social services people, seem intent on turning poor Antoine into a criminal.  Truffaut ends the movie at a spot where it is still far from clear where Antoine is really headed, but we can guess that his spirit will be undaunted.Some have called this, Francois Truffaut's first feature, realism, but if it's realism, so is Charles Dickens.  This is an extended slice of life, a coming-of-ager stopped before the boy does become of age, and in this sense original.  Truffaut paints everybody but the boy and his best friend in such a negative hue that we cannot help but identify with Antoine.  This is not realism, but it doesn't matter because this is a splendid film, perhaps not as great as some have claimed, but very much worth watching because of Leaud's fine performance and Truffaut's original and charming presentation of Paris in the 1950s.  In one sense Truffaut makes the City of Light a child's playground, and in another, it is a repressive, indifferent monolith.  Antoine's transgressions--ditching school, telling lies, stealing from his grandmother--are trivial.  But Truffaut wants to make sure we don't misunderstand so he has the boy get into trouble for (1) having a magazine passed to him in class, (2) unconsciously memorizing Balzac (he is accused of plagiarism by his fascist teacher) (3) returning a typewriter, which admittedly he had lifted, and (4) lighting a candle in honor of Balzac (which starts a fire).My favorite scene is the one with the psychiatrist in which we hear her questions, but the camera stays on Antoine.  His candid, eminently reasonable and entirely sane answers to her questions demonstrate that he is a completely normal, even admirable boy, and that it is society and its stupid adults that are off the mark.The faces of the children at the Punch and Judy show are wonderful and the sequence of Antoine running and running so gracefully and seemingly with little effort symbolizes the longing that all children have to be free.While I think this famous movie is perhaps a little over-rated, I can tell you that if you haven't seen it you are in danger of being labeled a cinematic illiterate.",4,Sympathetic and engaging,1022198400,"05 24, 2002",2002,2992,"['idiomatic', 'translation', 'French', 'title', 'movie', 'Les', 'quatre', 'cents', 'coup', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Raising', 'Hell', 'understood', 'ironically', 'Twelve-year-old', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'played', 'very', 'winningly', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', ""n't"", 'suffer', '400', 'blows', 'get', 'mistreated', 'quite', 'bit', ""n't"", 'mean', 'raise', 'hell', 'be', 'problem', 'parents', 'society', 'just', 'boy', 'being', 'boy', 'Unfortunately', 'mother', 'Claire', 'Mauier', 'who', 'more', 'wicked', 'step-mother', 'boy', 'biological', 'mother', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'rid', 'so', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'pursuing', 'hobby', 'adultery', 'cuckolded', 'step-father', 'Albert', 'Remy', 'help', 'care', 'more', 'boy', 'mother', 'institutions', 'society', 'represented', 'school', 'Parisian', 'police', 'social', 'services', 'people', 'seem', 'intent', 'turning', 'poor', 'Antoine', 'criminal', 'Truffaut', 'movie', 'spot', 'where', 'still', 'far', 'clear', 'where', 'Antoine', 'really', 'headed', 'can', 'guess', 'spirit', 'will', 'be', 'undaunted.Some', 'have', 'called', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'first', 'feature', 'realism', 'realism', 'so', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'extended', 'slice', 'life', 'coming-of-ager', 'stopped', 'boy', 'become', 'age', 'sense', 'original', 'Truffaut', 'paints', 'everybody', 'boy', 'best', 'friend', 'such', 'negative', 'hue', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'identify', 'Antoine', 'not', 'realism', ""n't"", 'matter', 'splendid', 'film', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'have', 'claimed', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'Leaud', 'fine', 'performance', 'Truffaut', 'original', 'charming', 'presentation', 'Paris', '1950s', 'one', 'sense', 'Truffaut', 'City', 'Light', 'child', 'playground', 'repressive', 'indifferent', 'monolith', 'Antoine', 'transgressions', 'ditching', 'school', 'telling', 'lies', 'stealing', 'grandmother', 'are', 'trivial', 'Truffaut', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'so', 'boy', 'get', 'trouble', '1', 'having', 'magazine', 'passed', 'class', '2', 'unconsciously', 'memorizing', 'Balzac', 'accused', 'plagiarism', 'fascist', 'teacher', '3', 'returning', 'typewriter', 'admittedly', 'had', 'lifted', '4', 'lighting', 'candle', 'honor', 'Balzac', 'fire', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'psychiatrist', 'hear', 'questions', 'camera', 'Antoine', 'candid', 'eminently', 'reasonable', 'entirely', 'sane', 'answers', 'questions', 'demonstrate', 'completely', 'normal', 'even', 'admirable', 'boy', 'society', 'stupid', 'adults', 'are', 'mark.The', 'children', 'Punch', 'Judy', 'show', 'are', 'wonderful', 'sequence', 'Antoine', 'running', 'running', 'so', 'gracefully', 'seemingly', 'little', 'effort', 'longing', 'children', 'have', 'be', 'free.While', 'think', 'famous', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'little', 'over-rated', 'can', 'tell', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'danger', 'being', 'labeled', 'cinematic', 'illiterate']",N/A

24995,AQIRBENYADT43,0780020731,Eddy,"[4, 6]","Francois Truffaut's mastery of the Parisian backdrop is one of his most appealing qualities and also one of the talents that helped him become such a cornerstone of French cinema. From the opening shots of 'Les Quatres-Cent Coups' (The Four-Hundred Blows), we are shown some of the sights and sounds of this historic city, that forms the colourful backdrop to the dubious adventures of Antoine Doinel.It is said that this film is heavily autobiographical and that the child actor Jean-Pierre Leaud was chosen because of his physical resemblance to Truffaut as a child. This is unsurprising given the sympathetic and almost paternal way in which Truffaut treats his protagonist. He is what many of the adults around him would see as a troublesome little brat. However in reality he is just a child who feels alienated from his surroundings. With a lack of love and attention both at home and at school, he feels a longing to escape to something else, even at this young age.It is testament to Truffaut's ability as a film maker that he is able to portray the existence of a troubled child, without the slightest hint of condescension or stereotype. This would also further the ideas of the films autobiographical underpinnings. Truffaut presents Antoine's youthful curiosity as something to be cherished and not repressed by anyone, be they parents teachers or his military academy.This encapsulating film of the childhood of Antoine Doinel is one of the most beautifully shot in the history of French cinema and indicates the arrival of one of Europe's most talented and important directors.",5,Truffaut's outstanding debut,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,1591,"['Francois', 'Truffaut', 'mastery', 'Parisian', 'backdrop', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'qualities', 'also', 'one', 'talents', 'helped', 'become', 'such', 'cornerstone', 'French', 'cinema', 'opening', 'shots', ""'Les"", 'Quatres-Cent', 'Coups', 'Four-Hundred', 'Blows', 'are', 'shown', 'sights', 'sounds', 'historic', 'city', 'colourful', 'backdrop', 'dubious', 'adventures', 'Antoine', 'Doinel.It', 'said', 'film', 'heavily', 'autobiographical', 'child', 'actor', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'was', 'chosen', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Truffaut', 'child', 'unsurprising', 'given', 'sympathetic', 'almost', 'paternal', 'way', 'Truffaut', 'protagonist', 'what', 'many', 'adults', 'would', 'see', 'troublesome', 'little', 'brat', 'However', 'reality', 'just', 'child', 'who', 'alienated', 'surroundings', 'lack', 'love', 'attention', 'home', 'school', 'longing', 'escape', 'something', 'else', 'even', 'young', 'age.It', 'testament', 'Truffaut', 'ability', 'film', 'maker', 'able', 'portray', 'existence', 'troubled', 'child', 'slightest', 'hint', 'condescension', 'stereotype', 'would', 'also', 'further', 'ideas', 'films', 'autobiographical', 'underpinnings', 'Truffaut', 'Antoine', 'youthful', 'curiosity', 'something', 'be', 'cherished', 'not', 'repressed', 'anyone', 'be', 'parents', 'teachers', 'military', 'academy.This', 'encapsulating', 'film', 'childhood', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'history', 'French', 'cinema', 'arrival', 'one', 'Europe', 'most', 'talented', 'important', 'directors']",N/A

24997,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0780020731,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into ""raising hell"", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan (who has a minor role as a schoolmate) is amusing for his Satchmo-inspired rendition of ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island's Tattoo, Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat, but Truffaut's emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker, even at this stage of his career, make this essential viewing.",5,Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,3226,"['seminal', 'work', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', '1959', 'directorial', 'debut', '27-year', 'old', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'vaunted', 'reputation', 'final', 'film', 'bound', 'disappoint', 'However', 'pristine', 'print', 'new', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'really', 'realize', 'what', 'brave', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'film', 'made', 'ostensibly', 'own', 'troubled', 'adolescence', 'worth', 'seeing', 'twice', 'once', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'listen', 'newly', 'recorded', 'commentary', 'Truffaut', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Lachenay', 'true-life', 'inspiration', 'Rene', 'film', 'Speaking', 'French', 'subtitled', 'English', 'insights', 'story', 'context', 'film', 'film', 'scholar', 'even', 'production', 'associate', 'could', 'possibly', 'provide', 'point', 'comparison', 'listen', 'by-the-numbers', 'commentary', 'film', 'scholar', 'Brian', 'Stonehill', 'recorded', 'back', '1992', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'researched', 'devoid', 'human', 'factor.The', 'film', 'title', 'French', 'colloquialism', 'raising', 'hell', 'appropriate', 'reference', 'story', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'hellion', 'named', 'Antoine', 'living', 'poor', 'section', 'Paris', 'neglected', 'parents', 'downright', 'arrogant', 'dysfunctional', 'nature', 'Antoine', 'consequently', 'street', 'urchin', 'life', 'people', 'authority', 'parents', 'teachers', 'police', 'rather', 'sadly', 'truth', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'Truffaut', 'Antoine', 'life', 'series', 'dispiriting', 'episodes', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'reformatory', 'caught', 'returning', 'stolen', 'typewriter', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'tire', 'responsibility', 'Truffaut', 'immense', 'credit', 'film', 'feels', 'stark', 'naturalistic', 'resorting', 'dramatic', 'manipulation', 'ideal', 'Antoine', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'who', 'out', 'confusion', 'angst', 'wandering', 'attention', 'character', 'realistic', 'terms', 'especially', 'impressive', 'apparently', 'improvised', 'scene', 'where', 'interviewed', 'school', 'authorities', 'why', 'life', 'come', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'how', 'bleak', 'life', 'becomes', 'yet', 'Leaud', 'incorrigible', 'often', 'intolerable', 'side', 'Antoine', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'extras', 'included', '2006', 'DVD', 'package', 'starting', 'two', 'separate', 'interviews', 'Truffaut', 'first', 'year', 'film', 'release', 'discussing', 'film', 'impact', 'second', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'more', 'reflective', 'mood', 'cinematic', 'influences', 'Leaud', 'featured', '16mm', 'screen', 'test', 'footage', 'where', 'naturally', 'ebullient', 'personality', 'emerges', 'then', '1959', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'puberty', 'apparently', 'kicked', 'then', '1965', 'comparatively', 'reserved', 'twenty-year', 'old', 'screen', 'test', 'Richard', 'Kanayan', 'who', 'minor', 'role', 'schoolmate', 'amusing', 'Satchmo-inspired', 'rendition', 'When', 'Saints', 'Go', 'Marching', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'Tattoo', 'Herve', 'Villechaize', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'downbeat', 'Truffaut', 'emotional', 'investment', 'consummate', 'abilities', 'filmmaker', 'even', 'stage', 'career', 'make', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A

Even though I don't see it that way, because I think it is pretty boring and lousy compared toBlackboard Jungle(1955), it has its merits.Young Antoine (Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud) is an adolescent who seems drawn to a life of petty crime and general mischief-making. His seemingly worthless parents send him into juvie after he steals a typewriter, and from thence he escapes. End of plot, story arc and everything. Some classic! I can't even discover what the damned title is supposed to mean, though according to another reviewer it is a French expression that means something like ""paint the town red"". In other words, go out and have fun.The thing has a quiet, meditative air - not surprising because young Antoine is rather sweet for a hoodlum. The jaunty Mexican-Cuban style dance music (music like that which I heard growing up) adds a sort of innocent air to the activities of Antoine and his pal. Guy Decomble is particularly hilarious as their frustrated teacher, and I wish there had been more of that before moving on to the juvenile hall scenes.Since I believe this film actually set the tone for the films of the 1960s, it is certainly worth watching just to say you have watched it. The whole thing struck me as funny because I just read something the other day about the worthlessness of those who haven't seen this - yet there is this notion that film does not begin or end with this, either.My personal slant: this film is highly overrated. Can someone tell me why it seems rated above the closest thing I can find to it, THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE? Why it ranks above Kurosawa's work of the period, especiallyThe Hidden Fortress (The Criterion Collection)(1958) orYojimbo (The Criterion Collection)(1961)? It seems like any other French film to me - and it is not even meant for kids. It is about a kid - big difference.Oh well.

It was said in an interview of an actress I'm fond of, to be one of her favorite movies of all time.I normally dont go for the old black and white movies, but I descided to give it a shot.I was pleasently suprised to see, though an older movie, the acting was rather good, and the plot wasnt borring at all.The 400 Blows, I still dont understand the title, is a French movie by a man named Francois Truffaut.Normally I'm not a fan of Subtitles because the reader can loose attention to the plot by trying desperately to read along.  But that wasnt the case here, the dialog went so naturally it was no trouble to keep in the moment.The story is about a kid named Antoine.  He looks to be in eigth grade.  Antoine doesnt behave in class and is a cronic lier.  Antoine's vandalism and theft start out at petty levels, but as the movie goes on they get more natural and in the moment.The back bone relationship of this movie is between Antoine and his Mother.  She seems to view him as more of a probluem then a child.At first glance of his father you are led to believe they are two pees in a pod.  Indeed, despite his faults, Antoine's Father is a good man and a good father.  Later we find out that he is not Antoine's biological father, to his credit I think it is wonderfull that he tried to be.Another important character of the film is Antoine's best friend.  The kid comes from an obvious upper middle class family, and is guilty of that common alement of not knowing how good you have it, and pretending your a tuff street kid.To his credit, Antoine's friend is loyal and tries hard to do right by Antoine.There is a school teacher in this film, Sourpuss, that makes me think the English Teach from a later film called, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" was based on the Truffaut character.For the most part I was simpathetic of Antoine in his plight, but once he plagurized that essey things started to be stop being his parents fault, and started being his fault.All in all it was good movie.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I may be a stupid American for wanting this, but I like to know what happens to a character.  The ending left me a little dissapointed, but maybe that was the point.

Last week I finally just forgot about renting any other movie, though I almost took home another great movie.  Back on the subject.  The movie is great.  I never knew what was going to happen next.  So many movies today are done by the paint by numbers system of film making... so predictable.  The 400 Blows is never predictable, it's fresh till the last second.  My only problem with this DVD was the quality of the picture.  I can forgive so-so audio quality, but when I see digital remnants all over the picture I wonder what kind of transfer was done.

Films likeEasy Rider [Blu-ray] for example also show this New Wave influence.  This Criterion release though is admirable given the very good picture and sound quality restoration treatment it has received and this moving autobiographical film of Truffaut's deservedly won the award at the Cannes Festival.The story which reminds me a lot of the Iranian director Kiarostami's work in ""The Traveler"" concerns a mischievous but otherwise harmless child who is resourceful and intelligent but is bored at school and so not unlike so many other children throughout the world tries to avoid school in order to do anything else together with his good friend a fellow classmate.  Things however go awry after he catches his own mother in an affair and this betrayal of his father who he clearly loves and respects causes great disquiet and confusion in the child and his playful misdemeanors somehow lead him into big trouble.  The final scene is extremely poignant and shows the futility of his attempts at escape from his predicament.  Like any classic this film rewards repeated viewing and causes its audience to think and to reflect.

Behind that, the gray life of a little family trying to survive in the Paris of the 50s.The child is lovely and the camera tries to view the world from his position of powerless, but Truffaut does not completely indulge him: he is surrounded by a narcissistic mother, a helpless father, an incompetent and authoritarian teacher and agressive schoolmates, yet it is himself who - somewhat freely - chooses petty crime and ends up behind bars.Seen as a (fiction) documentary of a boy living in a poor french urban household during the 50s, being parented by people too busy working to take care of him and the potential consequences of that, it is very good. But as a pure movie the feelings it produces are inconclusive: sometimes you understand the boy but at the end you make him responsible for his own actions, his family environment is unhealthy but his parents, in their own way, can do little to change it.

Through a series of measured vingettes--unsentimental and unsensationalized--The 400 Blows chronicles the life of its young protagonist with unflinching honesty and pitch-perfect emotional tone.  This film is in many ways the mirror opposite of Small Change: while that (also excellent) film was about the joys of childhood, this is primarily concerned with its pains.  Its a bleak world, one in which adults are at best emotionally stunted, and more often simply vicious.  However, it ultimately inspires rather than depresses: in spite of mangling him mercilessly in its machinery (yes, I hate that alliteration as much as you do), the world is unable to crush Antoine.  The ending shot is destined to haunt you for years to come.The acting is uniformly good.  L&eacute;aud, in the lead role, isn't quite virtuosic, but he doesn't need to be for his character to be effective, given the film's naturalistic manner.  It's difficult to imagine anyone else doing better.  Also--and maybe noting this is missing the point of the film, but it's undeniable--the cinematography is beautiful; Antoine's world is brilliantly realized.I really can't recommend The 400 Blows any more highly.

Christal,"[1, 1]","I just saw Francois Truffaut's 400 Blows again, and this indeed is the epitomy of the New Wave by making a story which can be seen like a French neo-realist reaction, and being as such it gets its chance to shine in the hands of the debut Truffaut.  It's a lovely, wonderful cinema experience.In a partially autobiographical tale, Truffaut's protagonist is Antoine Doinel, a pre-teen-ish youth who can be identified with by most who are at or older than his age viewing his tale- he hates school, goes to the movies as escape, and has parents who tend to be over-bearing and un-attentive.  After a string of events occur (one of which getting thrown out of his school) he tries to live on his own, which proves un-successful in a caught theft, which gets him into an ""observatory for delinquent youth"", or juvenile prison.One of the truly fascinating qualities of the film is that it all goes along in a totally naturastic manner, or at least natural for the characters presented, and there aren't any over-stylings to go along with the drama.  The stylings that are apparent give the film a perfect balance: the spellbinding scene on the carnival-twister, the un-broken shot of the boy running down the road, and shots that add emotional weight merely by the time allowed on the object.

Antoine is perhaps 12--on the brink of maturity but still a child. He is troubled--he engages in petty theft, and gets into minor trouble at school. Slowly the picture at home emerges. He was unwanted, his pretty mother is bored, his step-father kind but easily exasperated. The black and white film reminds us that WWII was a mere 15 years in the past--pre-war Paris has survived, but life is a struggle.Made almost 50 years ago, the film was a sensation when it was released. The camera angles are startling--we follow a troop of children from above as an oblivious physical fitness instructor trots along and boys peel away until no one is left. One of my favorite scenes is of a Punch and Judy show--Truffaut focuses on the faces of children laughing, rapt, scared--so close up and yet so natural, a reminder of a long ago time when puppets were a treat.This is a sad film. Antoine's quiet pain grows on us, as we see him shunted through what passed for a child welfare system at the time.  The ending is enigmatic; I still can't tell if we were meant to see hope or desperation. You may find the film slow-moving at first--I did.

The 400 Blows came out in 1959; French director Francois Truffaut directed the film, which follows the difficult existence--both at home and at school--of a very young boy, Antoine (Jean Pierre Leaud).The film's opening scene is in a classroom. The teacher sits at the head of the classroom; his sharp voice rings out over the students. A pin-up photo makes its rounds on the student's desks. The teacher is preoccupied, his head is down, and he is reading from his notes. But at the precise instant Antoine passes the pin-up, the teacher looks up and catches Antoine red-handed. The teacher orders Antoine to stand in the corner while his classmates run out for a recess in the schoolyard. Right off the bat, it's established that Antoine will suffer consequences for everything that he does. While serving his sentence in the corner of the classroom, Antoine attempts a poem on the chalkboard. The teacher sees the poem and orders Antoine to clean it off of the chalkboard. Antoine gets some rags to wipe off the chalkboard. The teacher yells at Antoine for making even more of a mess.At home, Antoine's parents treat him as a tenant. His mother, Madame Doinel (Claire Maurier), isAntoine's young and beautiful mother; Monsieur Doinel (Albert Remy) is Antoine's nave stepfather. Money is short, and late at night, Antoine's parents yell at each other. They argue about money. They are behind on the bills. They argue about Antoine eating too much and getting himself into trouble at school. Antoine develops an interest in Balzac. Again, this gets Antoine into trouble. He builds a small shrine to Balzac in his parent's home. He lights a candle and places it inside this shrine. This gesture nearly burns down the apartment.One day, Antoine skips school to have fun. He has some explaining to do the following day. His teacher is cynical and sarcastic; he's heard every excuse from Antoine.  Antoine tells the teacher that his mother died. This lie wins the sympathy of his teacher. Then, a boy stops by Antoine's home. The boy asks how Antoine's feeling. Antoine missed school the day before. Antoine's parents are pissed. They go to the school and to Antoine's classroom. The teacher sees Antoine's mother; she isn't dead. The teacher feels betrayed. The angry stepfather smacks Antoine in front of his teacher and classmates. Antoine is disgraced, but he'll get more when he goes home. Instead, he runs away. Things don't get any better from this point.400 Blows is a semi-biographical film written, produced, and directed by Francois Truffaut. The film's not all gloom. There are many funny moments to offset film's serious message.

Filmed in black and white, with very simple music and the raw look of a low-budget documentary, it is a glimpse into the life of troubled adolescent.  Antoine Doinel is poor, has cold and indifferent parents and teachers, and spends his days cutting school and getting into trouble.  When his parents give up on him, he is sent to a juvenile detention facility that resembles a jail.The cinema verite style of unsentimental photography and gritty locales manages to make even Paris look tawdry, almost ugly, because that's how Antoine views his life.  Growing up neglected and misunderstood has made him a streetwise child who dreams of escape.  The stark and sudden ending allows the viewer to decide what might happen to Antoine next (although Truffaut found the character so intriguing, he made three more movies about Antoine as he grows older).Jean-Pierre Leaud (Antoine) heads an excellent cast of actors who manage to look like they're not acting at all; rather that a camera just happened to intrude on their lives.

25022,AE1ML5LA0CJ4S,0780020731,Lawrence A. Schenbeck,"[4, 4]","If you are coming late to this pathbreaking film after having seen and enjoyed other Truffaut movies, be forewarned: it's not much like Jules et Jim, or The Bride Wore Black, or even the later Antoine Doinel features. Truffaut spent his childhood watching movies, especially the American studio products turned out by men who became his heroes -- Hawks, Ford, Hitchcock, Ray. In his later films, he unabashedly adapted their styles, combining commercial narrative techniques with his own New Wave sensibility. The result was a type of French cinema that could both entertain and dig deeper than a typical Hollywood vehicle.In The 400 Blows, his first full-length film, Truffaut opted instead for a documentary style that he felt offered the best chance of telling the truth. (He knew this truth very well, because the story is largely autobiographical.) Elements that typically enhance a studio film and nudge the viewer toward a certain reaction are almost totally absent. The camera ""passively"" records whatever is taking place, allowing fairly long scenes to unfold in real time. There are few quick cuts or editing that calls attention to itself or to particular lines. The music seems perfunctory, serving more to bridge scenes or otherwise offer continuity (again, in the manner of a documentary) than to prompt emotional responses or underline the psychology of a moment. Dialogue is usually banal, i.e., naturalistic. The characters, even the least sympathetic ones, don't get sorted into heroes or villains. We can sympathize with all of them even as we discern their obvious limitations.In other words, not a great date movie. Just a courageous first effort by someone who wasn't afraid to translate strong ideas about film into an actual film. I'm glad I finally watched it, although I will probably continue to treasure other Truffaut movies much more.The Blu-Ray transfer seems superb. Rich variations of black and gray and white. Beautiful visual detail. Wide-screen format, which surprised me, as with Jules et Jim. (Why have I always assumed that the great European film-makers of the 50s and 60s stuck with Academy Ratio?)

I have a lot more respect for the reviews on this site that had something original and iconoclastic to say about the film.  I don't respect the reviews that line up to say how wonderful this film is, because it isn't.There isn't any intensity in this movie.  It's about a boy who is a liar and a thief.  His mother is worse than he is, a tramp, utterly self centered, with no love either for her husband or her son.  I think there is more of a story here about the mother than about the wandering son.  I think a movie about the worthless bag of garbage that is Antoine's mother would be much more interesting than this film is.  Unfortunately she is a minor character and we only get to watch her son play hookie and get into trouble. The boy runs away, and the mother is happy about that and doesn't want him back.Whatever original ideas have been attributed to Truffaut from the 400 Blows don't change the fact that this movie doesn't really get into it.  It leaves us less than half satisfied.  It's like going out to eat and only having the lettuce and tomato salad.It's somewhat interesting to watch the French boys doing whatever they're doing, but this is not a great film.

In this, his first full-length motion picture, the humor is warm, the pace is brisk, and despite numerous obstacles, there is a very real sense that -- like its hero -- the director always knows where he wants to go next. It is a far cry from the aimless meandering in ""Jules and Jim"" and later films. (I happen to like some films that seem to have no aim or plot, it is just that Truffaut's or Fellini's works in that category are not good examples of how to do this successfully.)It is said that everyone can write at least one pretty good book, namely one's autobiography.

Thirteen year old Jean-Pierre Leaud is remarkable as Antoine, an otherwise bright kid mostly neglected by his parents except when he misbehaves...which is often.  Beautifully shot in glorious black and white, Truffaut allows the camera to linger on Antoine's face throughout the film.  While some of his antics are wrong, his motives are more mischievous than malicious.While at times a bit ponderous there are several noteworthy scenes in this early French New Wave film.  Check out the long scene where scores of young children watch a puppet show of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" with an ominous wolf.  The camera is mostly focused on the children's faces whose expressions range from fright to joy to satisfaction.  Once Antoine's missed classes and other transgressions leads to thievery, his parents send him to reform school.  It is clear that while his life there is perhaps better than the one he left behind, his ultimate goal is freedom.  He eventually escapes and heads for the ocean, which he had never seen.  The long closing scene brilliantly captures his short journey that ends with a long walk from the grassy fields to the beach and to the perceived freedom of the sea.I was curious about the title which has no logical reference in the film.  It is a straight translation from the French title, ""faire les quatre cents coups"" which means ""to raise hell.""  That does make sense, but the original American release was re-titled ""Wild Oats."" The film's distributor didn't like that title for whatever reason, so it reverted back to ""The 400 Blows.""This Criterion Blu ray disc is pretty much what you would expect from Criterion, excellent given the age of the original print.

Unlike some other classic films, one doesn't need to be a film buff to enjoy this.  One only has to like good films.Jean-Pierre Leaud is terrific as Antoine Doinel, a lonely Parisian boy who lives with his neglectful mother and flaky step-father.  At school, Doinel has become a target of wrath for his sadistic English teacher.  Doinel begins to hang out more and more with his deliquent friend.  Together, they skip school, go to the amusement park, and watch films (the young Truffaut was an avid movie watcher).Truffaut's Paris is certainly not a friendly place for children.  Parents are neglectful and teachers are more interested in bringing students into line than in teaching.  Indeed Doinel's English teacher seems to believe in harsh punishments over the most minor offense.  The more the world tries to bring Doinel into line, the more he is compelled to rebel.  Finally, Doinel steals a typewriter to be pawned to pay for his escape from home.  Having a change of conscience, he tries to returns it, but is caught and sent to a home for juvenile delinquents.Truffaut directs this semi-autobiographaphical film with great feeling, showing us the humor, triumph, and most of all sadness of his tragic childhood.

25033,AKI1CK229BDUC,0780020731,PsyRC,"[1, 1]","Despite the year this film was made, I believe the issues it addresses remain exceedingly current.  I think it is somewhat of a synecdoche of what society at large instills in people nowadays.  It is very difficult to tread outside of the very well-delineated lines our superego has drawn for us.  Antoine seems to be spiraled into this vertiginous voyage of soul destruction on almost a whim.  I think it is symptomatic of our culture to ""lend"" our views of the world to the children, stating how they should feel and act, while not allowing their free expression of emotion.  It is tragic, yet it reveals the parents' own unresolved issues and their need to project their own unwanted aspects into their kids, in whom they can exercise a more strict control.  So, in the end, children not only have to carry the burden of their own emotionally chaotic and ever-changing inner world, but they need to shoulder the brunt of their parents' failings as well; perhaps this was best exemplified when Antoine's parents demand that he take the garbage out, they need to remind him that in the final analysis he is responsible for dealing with everybody's waste.  What ensues in someone who has been so brow-beaten by life, without ever having their own emotions validated, is that they doubt the reality of their emotions, and encapsulate themselves into a protected world that is numb to any further assault by the world, what Sidney Klein would term an ""autistic cyst.""  The destruction of all that is externally good is symbolized when he is being taken away in the police wagon, the tears he sheds represent the death of emotion in itself, in a cathartic manner.  When the end rolls around, even fantasy cannot save him.  He approaches the ocean and when he sets foot in the water, her starts to walk sideways and eventually turns away with an emotionless face... the world has nothing left to offer him.  His mother also plays out her own intrapsychic dynamic very well; she suffers between the pull of her id and her superego; her id is represented by Antoine, since he was conceived out of wedlock, and he is the personification of her rebellious side.  Society (including her husband) puts demands on how her child should be reared, and since he represents such a powerful force in herself, a selfobject coruscating with a lust she perhaps wishes she could reclaim, there must be hell going on inside her head.  She eventually succumbs to the oppressive punitive superego, and the only way she can eliminate her pulsating id is to eliminate her contact with its concrete representation, her son.  She isolates her affect and summarily casts him into the destructive world that in essence destroyed her as well.",4,Dehumanizing to be non-threatening,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,2712,"['year', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'believe', 'issues', 'remain', 'exceedingly', 'current', 'think', 'somewhat', 'synecdoche', 'what', 'society', 'large', 'instills', 'people', 'nowadays', 'very', 'difficult', 'tread', 'very', 'well-delineated', 'lines', 'superego', 'drawn', 'Antoine', 'be', 'spiraled', 'vertiginous', 'voyage', 'soul', 'destruction', 'almost', 'whim', 'think', 'symptomatic', 'culture', 'lend', 'views', 'world', 'children', 'stating', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'act', 'not', 'allowing', 'free', 'expression', 'emotion', 'tragic', 'parents', 'own', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'need', 'project', 'own', 'unwanted', 'aspects', 'kids', 'whom', 'can', 'exercise', 'more', 'strict', 'control', 'So', 'end', 'children', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'carry', 'burden', 'own', 'emotionally', 'chaotic', 'ever-changing', 'inner', 'world', 'need', 'shoulder', 'brunt', 'parents', 'failings', 'well', 'perhaps', 'was', 'best', 'exemplified', 'when', 'Antoine', 'parents', 'demand', 'take', 'garbage', 'out', 'need', 'remind', 'final', 'analysis', 'responsible', 'dealing', 'everybody', 'waste', 'What', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'brow-beaten', 'life', 'ever', 'having', 'own', 'emotions', 'validated', 'doubt', 'reality', 'emotions', 'encapsulate', 'protected', 'world', 'numb', 'further', 'assault', 'world', 'what', 'Sidney', 'Klein', 'would', 'term', 'autistic', 'cyst', 'destruction', 'externally', 'good', 'symbolized', 'when', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'police', 'wagon', 'tears', 'represent', 'death', 'emotion', 'cathartic', 'manner', 'When', 'end', 'even', 'fantasy', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'ocean', 'when', 'foot', 'water', 'starts', 'walk', 'sideways', 'eventually', 'away', 'emotionless', 'face', 'world', 'nothing', 'left', 'offer', 'mother', 'also', 'out', 'own', 'intrapsychic', 'dynamic', 'very', 'well', 'pull', 'id', 'superego', 'id', 'represented', 'Antoine', 'was', 'conceived', 'wedlock', 'personification', 'rebellious', 'side', 'Society', 'including', 'husband', 'demands', 'how', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'reared', 'powerful', 'force', 'selfobject', 'coruscating', 'lust', 'perhaps', 'could', 'reclaim', 'must', 'be', 'hell', 'going', 'head', 'eventually', 'succumbs', 'oppressive', 'punitive', 'superego', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'eliminate', 'pulsating', 'id', 'eliminate', 'contact', 'concrete', 'representation', 'son', 'affect', 'summarily', 'destructive', 'world', 'essence', 'destroyed', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The problem for me is that the boy in question is spared any responsibility for his actions by the direction that the film leads us.  His is a flawed character and blaming the flaws on his environment struck me as a shallow escape from personal responsibility.  I felt sympathy for him but exasperation as well as he seemed to lead himself astray.Part of the problem I had with ""The 400 Blows"" was that I saw it the same weekend that I saw ""Salaam Bombay"" and ""Amarcord"".  In the case of ""Amarcord"" the same deliquencies that happened in school were cause for laughter while in ""The 400 Blows"" they were cause for dismay.  More telling, however, was the youth of the same age in ""Salaam Bombay"" who faced far greater challenges with far less help available and far more honor, self-respect and self-determination.  I guess I was looking for as much out of Paris as I got out of Bombay.  Both movies made a point that abandoned youth was a crisis in our midst.  The fact that one made the message more effectively kept me from rating ""The 400 Blows"" higher than I did.",4,No Winners,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1917,"['tough', 'movie', 'evaluate', 'fact', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'testament', 'power', 'fact', 'film', 'obvious', 'answer', 'issues', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'testament', 'depth', 'analysis', 'problem', 'came', 'away', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'not', 'were', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'had', 'difficulty', 'relating', 'victims.This', 'story', 'young', 'lad', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'home', 'life', 'love', 'step-father', 'more', 'attentive', 'mother', 'school', 'one', 'autocratic', 'institutions', 'heart', 'patience', 'one', 'care', 'Where', 'love', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'urbanized', 'industrialized', 'society', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'first', 'film', 'immense', 'talent', 'inclination', 'make', 'social', 'statement', 'film', 'problem', 'boy', 'question', 'spared', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'direction', 'film', 'flawed', 'character', 'blaming', 'flaws', 'environment', 'struck', 'shallow', 'escape', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'exasperation', 'as', 'well', 'seemed', 'lead', 'astray.Part', 'problem', 'had', '400', 'Blows', 'was', 'saw', 'same', 'weekend', 'saw', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'Amarcord', 'case', 'Amarcord', 'same', 'deliquencies', 'happened', 'school', 'were', 'cause', 'laughter', '400', 'Blows', 'were', 'cause', 'dismay', 'More', 'telling', 'however', 'was', 'youth', 'same', 'age', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'who', 'faced', 'far', 'greater', 'challenges', 'far', 'less', 'help', 'available', 'far', 'more', 'honor', 'self-respect', 'self-determination', 'guess', 'was', 'looking', 'as', 'much', 'Paris', 'got', 'Bombay', 'movies', 'made', 'point', 'abandoned', 'youth', 'was', 'crisis', 'midst', 'fact', 'one', 'made', 'message', 'more', 'effectively', 'kept', 'rating', '400', 'Blows', 'higher', 'did']",N/A

Most people say the film is depressing and sad but I found it to be kind of uplifting, and the ending is perfect. Other reviews already explained the plot so I wont go into it, but the film was shot great and the music adds a nice classic smooth jazz feel to it.

25039,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,0780020731,RMurray847,"[5, 5]","Antoine Doniel is a juvenile delinquent.  He disrespects his teachers, lies even when the truth might suit him, deceives his parents, cuts class and is generally a trouble-maker.  This is bad enough.  What makes him a delinquent is the fact that he defaces school property, commits numerous acts of theft (and not just by sneaking money from his parents) and trespasses.  He thumbs his nose at all authority.Because Antoine is the hero of Francois Truffaut's semi-autobiographical first film THE 400 BLOWS, we are apparently supposed to forgive all that.  After all, he's got the soul of an artist...he lights up when watching movies and perhaps has an insight into them beyond his years.  His parents did not show him significant enough amounts of love.  So it's okay that he can't follow the simplest rule, or even care to try.  He does what feels good to him, regardless of who it inconveniences or hurts.On its surface (and below much of the surface too), THE 400 BLOWS is a film with an utterly unlikable central character.  I give the kid no credit for being a ""misunderstood artist."" He's clearly excited by what he reads when he first encounters Balzac, but rather than taking inspiration from the word, he plagiarizes it for a homework assignment.  Word for word.  So for me, an appreciator of arts and artists...Antoine is a snot-nosed kid who needs a comeuppance.THE 400 BLOWS is set in `50s France, and was on the leading edge of the French New Wave in film.  I'll readily admit I know little about those films, and the more I read about the socialist ideology of many of its purveyors, the less I care to know.  It is all filmed on location, with many fantastic shots of this marvelous city.  Paris is as much a character as Antoine's mother or father.  The gorgeous black and white exterior shots are a treat.  The viewer really gets a sense of being immersed in a primarily lower middle class city.  The film is very briskly paced, even as relatively little of real consequence happens.  Although the film is primarily a slice-of-life drama, it is full of funny moments, characters and vignettes.  I greatly appreciated its breezy tone and the naturalistic filming approach.  While it's too self-consciously a movie to have a documentary feel to it...I did appreciate the clearly improvisational nature of many of the scenes.And, while I dislike the central character, I really liked the remarkable young actor Jean-Pierre Leaud who played him.  He's got a soulful face, and filmed right on the edge of his teen years, he's got a cherubic affect to go along with his far more mature misbehaviors.  I never rooted for the character, per se...but I couldn't help smiling at his many malfeasances, even as he exasperated me.  He has an attractive mother who clearly isn't enamored of being a mom (and has a few more secrets I won't spoil), but for much of the film, I also appreciated that he had a gruff but remarkably patient and understanding father.  The father clearly understood that Antoine was a source of irrational irritation on the part of his mother, and worked hard to shield the child, even when his own temper was tested.  I found his character to be interestingly complex.  And he too has some secrets.  Other characters, such as the schoolteacher, teeter too close to caricature.  Yes, he's an awful teacher.  But given what teaching was like in those days, is he deserving of the utter derision Antoine pours on him?I know for some, THE 400 BLOWS is some sort of testament to either the miseries of being a misunderstood ""artist's soul.""  For others, it's a statement on how too little love can damage a kid.  Or the harshness of society, etc. etc.  I find any messages like that to be unconvincing and delivered with too heavy a hand.  However, the fast pace, gorgeous cinematography, lovely locations, generally solid acting and generous doses of humor to make this a film worth recommending despite my hesitations.I viewed the Criterion Blu-ray, and must say that the bonus materials are particularly fun.  There are numerous interviews over the years with Truffaut...who is a lively subject.  And there are some great shots of young Leaud as he auditioned for his role, and during interviews while making the rounds at Cannes.  He's an interesting person to learn about.  The bonus essay was a bit skimpier than I'm used to with Criterion, but worthwhile nonetheless.  Once again, Criterion has done an exceptional job.  THE 400 BLOWS is an important movie in film history, and Criterion has given it an appropriate showcase.",4,"Despite my dislike of central character, simply too many good things to dismiss",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,4559,"['Antoine', 'Doniel', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'teachers', 'lies', 'even', 'when', 'truth', 'might', 'suit', 'parents', 'cuts', 'class', 'generally', 'trouble-maker', 'bad', 'enough', 'What', 'delinquent', 'fact', 'school', 'property', 'numerous', 'acts', 'theft', 'not', 'just', 'sneaking', 'money', 'parents', 'trespasses', 'thumbs', 'nose', 'authority.Because', 'Antoine', 'hero', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'semi-autobiographical', 'first', 'film', 'THE', '400', 'BLOWS', 'are', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'forgive', 'got', 'soul', 'artist', 'up', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'insight', 'years', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'significant', 'enough', 'amounts', 'love', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'simplest', 'rule', 'even', 'care', 'try', 'what', 'feels', 'good', 'regardless', 'who', 'hurts.On', 'surface', 'much', 'surface', 'too', '400', 'BLOWS', 'film', 'utterly', 'unlikable', 'central', 'character', 'give', 'kid', 'credit', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'artist', 'clearly', 'excited', 'what', 'when', 'first', 'Balzac', 'rather', 'taking', 'inspiration', 'word', 'homework', 'assignment', 'Word', 'word', 'So', 'appreciator', 'arts', 'artists', 'Antoine', 'snot-nosed', 'kid', 'who', 'comeuppance.THE', '400', 'BLOWS', 'set', '50s', 'France', 'was', 'leading', 'edge', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'film', ""'ll"", 'readily', 'admit', 'know', 'little', 'films', 'more', 'read', 'socialist', 'ideology', 'many', 'purveyors', 'less', 'care', 'know', 'filmed', 'location', 'many', 'fantastic', 'shots', 'marvelous', 'city', 'Paris', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'Antoine', 'mother', 'father', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'exterior', 'shots', 'are', 'treat', 'viewer', 'really', 'sense', 'being', 'immersed', 'primarily', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'city', 'film', 'very', 'briskly', 'paced', 'even', 'relatively', 'little', 'real', 'consequence', 'happens', 'film', 'primarily', 'slice-of-life', 'drama', 'full', 'funny', 'moments', 'characters', 'vignettes', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'breezy', 'tone', 'naturalistic', 'filming', 'approach', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'movie', 'have', 'documentary', 'feel', 'did', 'appreciate', 'clearly', 'improvisational', 'nature', 'many', 'scenes.And', 'dislike', 'central', 'character', 'really', 'liked', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actor', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'who', 'played', 'got', 'soulful', 'face', 'filmed', 'right', 'edge', 'teen', 'years', 'got', 'cherubic', 'affect', 'go', 'along', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'misbehaviors', 'never', 'rooted', 'character', 'se', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smiling', 'many', 'malfeasances', 'even', 'exasperated', 'attractive', 'mother', 'who', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'enamored', 'being', 'mom', 'few', 'more', 'secrets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'much', 'film', 'also', 'appreciated', 'had', 'gruff', 'remarkably', 'patient', 'understanding', 'father', 'father', 'clearly', 'understood', 'Antoine', 'was', 'source', 'irrational', 'irritation', 'part', 'mother', 'worked', 'hard', 'shield', 'child', 'even', 'when', 'own', 'temper', 'was', 'tested', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'interestingly', 'complex', 'too', 'secrets', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'schoolteacher', 'teeter', 'too', 'close', 'caricature', 'Yes', 'awful', 'teacher', 'given', 'what', 'teaching', 'was', 'days', 'deserving', 'utter', 'derision', 'Antoine', 'pours', 'know', '400', 'BLOWS', 'sort', 'testament', 'either', 'miseries', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'artist', 'soul', 'others', 'statement', 'how', 'too', 'little', 'love', 'can', 'damage', 'kid', 'harshness', 'society', 'etc', 'etc', 'find', 'messages', 'be', 'unconvincing', 'delivered', 'too', 'heavy', 'hand', 'However', 'fast', 'pace', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'locations', 'generally', 'solid', 'acting', 'generous', 'doses', 'humor', 'make', 'film', 'recommending', 'hesitations.I', 'viewed', 'Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'must', 'say', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'particularly', 'fun', 'are', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'years', 'Truffaut', 'who', 'lively', 'subject', 'are', 'great', 'shots', 'young', 'Leaud', 'auditioned', 'role', 'interviews', 'making', 'rounds', 'Cannes', 'interesting', 'person', 'learn', 'about', 'bonus', 'essay', 'was', 'bit', 'skimpier', ""'m"", 'used', 'Criterion', 'worthwhile', 'nonetheless', 'Once', 'again', 'Criterion', 'done', 'exceptional', 'job', '400', 'BLOWS', 'important', 'movie', 'film', 'history', 'Criterion', 'given', 'appropriate', 'showcase']",N/A

25047,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0780020731,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""The Four Hundred Blows,"" (1959) a drama with comic touches, was the first full-length feature film from famed French director/movie critic Francois Truffaut, and is generally considered the first ""Nouvelle Vogue"" film - that is, new wave.  Truffaut had previously been active as a movie critic on ""Cahiers du Cinema,"" a well-known French magazine devoted largely to American films, when, almost on a bet, he decided to try his hand at film-making. The result, ""400 Blows,"" at 99 minutes, made when he was just 28, is, of course, world-famous.  It is generally considered a pioneering film, and a triumph of movie-making.  It's still fresh, interesting, closely-observed, and intense, after all these years.  The filmmaker would, of course, continue to do significant work: seeFrancois Truffaut's Adventures of Antoine Doinel (The 400 Blows / Antoine & Collette / Stolen Kisses / Bed & Board / Love on the Run) - Criterion Collection;Jules and Jim - Criterion Collection, orShoot the Piano Player - Criterion Collection.Truffaut both wrote and directed his script.  It's set in dreary wintertime Paris, in the part of the city where Truffaut grew up, the working class ""banlieus"" of Montmartre, far from its iconic tourist attractions. Much of the film is set in an extremely cramped apartment, six flights up, typical working class housing of the time, where the young Antoine Doinel is nightly sent down with the garbage.We see Antoine, meant to be 12 years old, and instinctively played by the 15-year old Jean-Pierre Leaud, at home, with his somewhat neglectful, distracted parents.  His kindly stepfather, Julian Doinel (Albert Remy), married his beautiful mother Gilberte (Claire Maurier), giving his name to her illegitimately-born son, who initially lived with his grandmother.  His mother doesn't seem to much care for her boy.  We also see Antoine at school, where he is definitely not a teacher's pet.  We're supposed to believe that the boy's somewhat unsupportive environment causes him to run away and predisposes him to a life of petty crime.  Though frankly, compared to the horrors we've seen, in the way of abusive families and dysfunctional schools, nothing about his young life seems that terrible to me.  Be that as it may, Doinel does run away; with his young friend Rene, he goes to the movies a lot, and slips into petty criminality.  He's found out, goes through the justice system, as his parents wash their hands of him, and is sent to reform school.Truffaut told interviewers he was strongly influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock,( seeAlfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection (Psycho / Vertigo / Rear Window / The Birds / Shadow of a Doubt / Family Plot / Frenzy / The Man Who Knew Too Much / Marnie / Rope / Saboteur / Topaz / Torn Curtain / The Trouble with Harry)); and, closer to home, Jean Renoir,(seeJean Renoir 3-Disc Collector's Edition (Whirlpool of Fate / Nana / Charleston Parade / La Marseillaise / The Doctor's Horrible Experiment / The Elusive Corporal)), son of the famous painter Pierre Auguste.  Trufffaut proudly told interviewers he believed that this first film of his was the first film to center on a child, in an unsentimental way, and to treat its material in an almost documentary style.  All sources agree that the picture is strongly semi-autobiographical:  Truffaut was illegitimately born, and raised by his grandparents; he started his heavy movie-going at age seven.  He was a great reader but not a good pupil, and left school at 14 to get a job.  He was sent to jail for desertion from the army.The movie, an accretion of wonderful interludes, endlessly rewards close attention.  There's a schoolboy ripping his copybook apart, as his pen keeps blotting the pages.  A punch and judy show filmed before a live audience of little children, showing their fresh, unguarded reactions, as it was done with a hidden camera.  A jog, supposedly supervised by the gym teacher, taken through the streets of Paris by the schoolboys: Truffaut's camera shows the boys quietly peeling off.  Antoine's shaken-up ride in a gravitron at a local amusement park.  The little shrine Antoine sets up at home to famed French author Honore Balzac, whose work he loves: he lights a candle to the author, and sets the apartment on fire.  And, finally, a remarkable long tracking shot of Antoine running, running, running away from the reform school towards the sea, which he's never seen.  And a freeze-frame shot at the seashore that film scholars will probably argue about for a good long time.",4,It Endlessly Rewards Close Attention,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,4542,"['Four', 'Hundred', 'Blows', '1959', 'drama', 'comic', 'touches', 'was', 'first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'famed', 'French', 'director/movie', 'critic', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'generally', 'considered', 'first', 'Nouvelle', 'Vogue', 'film', 'new', 'wave', 'Truffaut', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'active', 'movie', 'critic', 'Cahiers', 'du', 'Cinema', 'well-known', 'French', 'magazine', 'devoted', 'largely', 'American', 'films', 'when', 'almost', 'bet', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'film-making', 'result', '400', 'Blows', '99', 'minutes', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'just', '28', 'course', 'world-famous', 'generally', 'considered', 'pioneering', 'film', 'triumph', 'movie-making', 'still', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'closely-observed', 'intense', 'years', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'course', 'continue', 'do', 'significant', 'work', 'seeFrancois', 'Truffaut', 'Adventures', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', '400', 'Blows', '/', 'Antoine', 'Collette', '/', 'Stolen', 'Kisses', '/', 'Bed', 'Board', '/', 'Love', 'Run', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Piano', 'Player', 'Criterion', 'Collection.Truffaut', 'wrote', 'directed', 'script', 'set', 'dreary', 'wintertime', 'Paris', 'part', 'city', 'where', 'Truffaut', 'grew', 'up', 'working', 'class', 'banlieus', 'Montmartre', 'far', 'iconic', 'tourist', 'attractions', 'Much', 'film', 'set', 'extremely', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'six', 'flights', 'up', 'typical', 'working', 'class', 'housing', 'time', 'where', 'young', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'nightly', 'sent', 'down', 'garbage.We', 'see', 'Antoine', 'meant', 'be', '12', 'years', 'old', 'instinctively', 'played', '15-year', 'old', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'home', 'somewhat', 'neglectful', 'distracted', 'parents', 'kindly', 'stepfather', 'Julian', 'Doinel', 'Albert', 'Remy', 'married', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'Gilberte', 'Claire', 'Maurier', 'giving', 'name', 'illegitimately-born', 'son', 'who', 'initially', 'lived', 'grandmother', 'mother', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'care', 'boy', 'also', 'see', 'Antoine', 'school', 'where', 'definitely', 'not', 'teacher', 'pet', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'boy', 'somewhat', 'unsupportive', 'environment', 'run', 'away', 'life', 'petty', 'crime', 'frankly', 'compared', 'horrors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'way', 'abusive', 'families', 'dysfunctional', 'schools', 'nothing', 'young', 'life', 'terrible', 'Be', 'may', 'Doinel', 'run', 'away', 'young', 'friend', 'Rene', 'movies', 'lot', 'petty', 'criminality', 'found', 'out', 'justice', 'system', 'parents', 'wash', 'hands', 'sent', 'reform', 'school.Truffaut', 'told', 'interviewers', 'was', 'strongly', 'influenced', 'films', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'seeAlfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Masterpiece', 'Collection', 'Psycho', '/', 'Vertigo', '/', 'Rear', 'Window', '/', 'Birds', '/', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', '/', 'Family', 'Plot', '/', 'Frenzy', '/', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', '/', 'Marnie', '/', 'Rope', '/', 'Saboteur', '/', 'Topaz', '/', 'Torn', 'Curtain', '/', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'closer', 'home', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'seeJean', 'Renoir', '3-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Whirlpool', 'Fate', '/', 'Nana', '/', 'Charleston', 'Parade', '/', 'La', 'Marseillaise', 'Doctor', 'Horrible', 'Experiment', '/', 'Elusive', 'Corporal', 'son', 'famous', 'painter', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Trufffaut', 'proudly', 'told', 'interviewers', 'believed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'center', 'child', 'unsentimental', 'way', 'treat', 'material', 'almost', 'documentary', 'style', 'sources', 'agree', 'picture', 'strongly', 'semi-autobiographical', 'Truffaut', 'was', 'illegitimately', 'born', 'raised', 'grandparents', 'started', 'heavy', 'movie-going', 'age', 'seven', 'was', 'great', 'reader', 'not', 'good', 'pupil', 'left', 'school', '14', 'get', 'job', 'was', 'sent', 'jail', 'desertion', 'army.The', 'movie', 'accretion', 'wonderful', 'interludes', 'endlessly', 'rewards', 'close', 'attention', 'schoolboy', 'ripping', 'copybook', 'apart', 'pen', 'keeps', 'blotting', 'pages', 'punch', 'judy', 'show', 'filmed', 'live', 'audience', 'little', 'children', 'showing', 'fresh', 'unguarded', 'reactions', 'was', 'done', 'hidden', 'camera', 'jog', 'supposedly', 'supervised', 'gym', 'teacher', 'taken', 'streets', 'Paris', 'schoolboys', 'Truffaut', 'camera', 'boys', 'quietly', 'peeling', 'off', 'Antoine', 'shaken-up', 'ride', 'gravitron', 'local', 'amusement', 'park', 'little', 'shrine', 'Antoine', 'up', 'home', 'famed', 'French', 'author', 'Honore', 'Balzac', 'work', 'candle', 'author', 'apartment', 'fire', 'finally', 'remarkable', 'long', 'tracking', 'shot', 'Antoine', 'running', 'running', 'running', 'away', 'reform', 'school', 'sea', 'never', 'seen', 'freeze-frame', 'shot', 'seashore', 'film', 'scholars', 'will', 'probably', 'argue', 'good', 'long', 'time']",N/A

I initially gave it a 4/5 and found it interesting, but it's growing on me and is now a 4.5/5.The story is bleak, but very realistic, which isn't surprising considering that it's semi-autobiographical. Truffaut's early life must have been hard. His parents tried at times, but treated him badly or with indifference at other times.Much of the early part of the film is set in a classroom and we meet his classmates and learn his general attitude toward school. The discipline was very different than what we might expect today. He has one particular friend who encourages him to skip class and we see their shared experiences on the streets of Paris.The friend is partly responsible for leading him astray and encouraging him to steal which leads into the second part of the story where we see the consequences of his bad behavior and his lies.Some of the school scenes remind me of my childhood, although I had a much happier upbringing.The main thing that brings Antoine happiness is cinema and the happiest time spent with his parents involves a trip to see a film.The film also provides a snapshot of Paris in the late 50s. Shot in black and white and told from Antoine's viewpoint, we often see exactly what he sees through the choice of camera angles. His perspective also shows us that he thinks of himself in very different ways from the way in which he is viewed by others. We can empathize with his situation completely.The film demonstrates how frightening, daunting and impossible life can seem when you're growing up.Truffaut died aged 52 after making 21 features and this makes me want to see more of them.Picture quality: 4/5 (excellent for the vintage)Audio 5/5 (the music really added to the experience and everything was clear)",5,One of the best stories about childhood,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,2062,"['Directed', 'Francois', 'TruffautStarring', 'Jean-Pierre', 'L', 'eacute', 'Claire', 'Maurier', 'Albert', 'R', 'eacute', 'Guy', 'Decomble99', 'minutesBlack', 'white', 'French', 'languageVideo', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1Audio', 'French', 'LPCM', 'MonoSubtitles', 'EnglishThis', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'seeing', '400', 'Blows', 'initially', 'gave', '4/5', 'found', 'interesting', 'growing', 'now', '4.5/5.The', 'story', 'bleak', 'very', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'considering', 'semi-autobiographical', 'Truffaut', 'early', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'parents', 'tried', 'times', 'treated', 'badly', 'indifference', 'other', 'times.Much', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'set', 'classroom', 'meet', 'classmates', 'learn', 'general', 'attitude', 'school', 'discipline', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'today', 'one', 'particular', 'friend', 'who', 'skip', 'class', 'see', 'shared', 'experiences', 'streets', 'Paris.The', 'friend', 'partly', 'responsible', 'leading', 'astray', 'encouraging', 'steal', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'where', 'see', 'consequences', 'bad', 'behavior', 'lies.Some', 'school', 'scenes', 'childhood', 'had', 'much', 'happier', 'upbringing.The', 'main', 'thing', 'Antoine', 'happiness', 'cinema', 'happiest', 'time', 'spent', 'parents', 'trip', 'see', 'film.The', 'film', 'also', 'snapshot', 'Paris', 'late', '50s', 'Shot', 'black', 'white', 'told', 'Antoine', 'viewpoint', 'often', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'choice', 'camera', 'angles', 'perspective', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'way', 'viewed', 'others', 'can', 'empathize', 'situation', 'completely.The', 'film', 'how', 'frightening', 'daunting', 'impossible', 'life', 'can', 'seem', 'when', ""'re"", 'growing', 'up.Truffaut', 'died', 'aged', '52', 'making', '21', 'features', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'them.Picture', 'quality', '4/5', 'excellent', 'vintage', '5/5', 'music', 'really', 'added', 'experience', 'everything', 'was', 'clear']",N/A

THE 400 BLOWS is a gentle and compassionate movie. It isn't overwhelmed by its anger, although a few characters, particularly the coming-of-age hero's mother and his school teacher, aren't terribly sympathetic.  Being new to THE 400 BLOWS, I found the commentary by Premiere magazine film critic Glen Kenny especially helpful in understanding French New Wave cinema in general and Truffaut in particular.

The period between childhood and adulthood is fraught with awkwardness and insecurity.  Francois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" examines the life of one such child as he takes his first baby steps toward a new stage in his life.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is a young man who lives with his mother (Claire Maurier) and stepfather (Albert Remy) in Paris.  He has his troubles but is not really a bad child - he is just a confused boy looking for adventure, attention, and guidance.  However, a serious error in judgment leads Antoine to steal a typewriter and he is sent off to a juvenile detention home.  He eventually escapes his confinement and heads for the beach.  While staring out at the sea, Antoine tries to make some sense out of his life.""The 400 Blows"" is a restrained version of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (1955).  It deals with the problem of juvenile delinquency and the confusion of adolescence from a stark and minimalist perspective.  There are no drag races or switchblade fights to sensationalize the proceedings.  This is a film more concerned with personal introspection and the harsh realities of the real world.  Yet, while there is a richness to the film's texture, ""The 400 Blows"" is a trying film to watch.  It is a technically-sound film that will appeal to the film student but will not appeal to the casual viewer.  Truffaut captures the nuances of everyday life so well that the film mimics life's routine nature to perfection.  The end result is a viewing experience that becomes too monotonous to be enjoyable.",2,"""Not everybody has a tongue like yours.""",1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,1643,"['Adolescence', 'difficult', 'time', 'child', 'not', 'matter', 'where', 'grow', 'up', 'what', 'era', 'period', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'fraught', 'awkwardness', 'insecurity', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', '400', 'Blows', 'life', 'one', 'such', 'child', 'first', 'baby', 'steps', 'new', 'stage', 'life.Antoine', 'Doinel', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'mother', 'Claire', 'Maurier', 'Albert', 'Remy', 'Paris', 'troubles', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'child', 'just', 'confused', 'boy', 'looking', 'adventure', 'attention', 'guidance', 'However', 'serious', 'error', 'judgment', 'leads', 'Antoine', 'steal', 'typewriter', 'sent', 'off', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'home', 'eventually', 'confinement', 'heads', 'beach', 'staring', 'out', 'sea', 'Antoine', 'make', 'sense', 'life', '400', 'Blows', 'restrained', 'version', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', '1955', 'problem', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'confusion', 'adolescence', 'stark', 'minimalist', 'perspective', 'are', 'drag', 'races', 'switchblade', 'fights', 'sensationalize', 'proceedings', 'film', 'more', 'concerned', 'personal', 'introspection', 'harsh', 'realities', 'real', 'world', 'richness', 'film', 'texture', '400', 'Blows', 'trying', 'film', 'watch', 'technically-sound', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'film', 'student', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'casual', 'viewer', 'Truffaut', 'nuances', 'everyday', 'life', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'mimics', 'life', 'routine', 'nature', 'perfection', 'end', 'result', 'viewing', 'experience', 'too', 'monotonous', 'be', 'enjoyable']",N/A
25051,A27YE6HPUFIWI4,0780020731,Taylor T. Carlson,"[1, 1]","This review is for the Blu-Ray edition.The 400 Blows is directed by Francois Truffaut. The film stars Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud, Claire Maurier, Albert R&eacute;my, and Guy Decomble.The 400 Blows is the first major film directed by Francois Truffaut, formerly a film critic known for his brutally-honest reviews. The film, based loosely on Truffaut's childhood, follows the story of Antoine Doinel, a young man in his early teens. His life is a mess - he's frequently getting into trouble in school, his parents fight all the time and are hard on him, he lives in a low-income household, and to make things even worse, discovers that his mother is having an affair with a co-worker. He tries to make ends meet, but nothing seems to work. The film is the story of this young man's struggle in society, and the consequences that befall him.Truffaut's first major feature film is also his finest. With the film he creates believable characters, and a true-to-life story that anyone who has ever been young will be able to relate to. The movie runs a brisk 100 minutes, and never outstays its welcome. Every second feels authentic.The characters and the actors who portray them make this film their own. The obvious stand-out actor his a young Jean-Pierre Leaud, who stars as Antoine Doinel. Truffaut created the character has a version of himself at a younger age, which may be the reason that director and actor alike are able to make this character so three-dimensional and be lievable. If you've ever been young, you'll be able to relate to Leaud in this role. Who amongst us hasn't hated a teacher in school, gotten in trouble, and been hollered out by our parents? And unlike other rebellious youngsters of the era captured on film, Antoine doesn't use violence to rebel, or talk back to his superiors. He wants to be free, but he obviously doesn't want to hurt or offend anyone in his life, which makes him all the more a sympathetic, tragic figure who learns the hard way that freedom isn't free.The 400 Blows won audiences over at Cannes way back in 1959. Half a century later, its message is as strong as ever. A brilliant piece of cinema that manages to be believable throughout its duration, it's no wonder Truffaut became hailed as one of France's finest filmmakers. With this film, he launched the French New Wave and hundreds of imitators. There's no denying it - this is one of the greatest films ever made.All in all, The 400 Blows looks pretty damn good in 1080p. This isn't a leaps-and-bounds improvement over Criterion's most recent standard-def disc, but there are noticeable improvements, and it definitely looks better on a large HDTV screen than the normal DVD does. The image is clear and detailed throughout (I was able to pick out details I couldn't see on SD and read some text that was unreadable on the original DVD), it definitely looks better than I expected for a film this old. My only complaint is that there are a few scenes in which the grain level tends to spike. However, this is a very minor complaint, and it certainly doesn't detract from enjoyment of the film. This isn't the best-looking black and white film I've seen on Blu (Casablanca still holds that honor), but it's definitely in the upper tier. Dialogue is presented in the original French Mono, and the track has been beautifully remastered and is free of any annoying pops or hisses. Needless to say, English subtitles are included. Criterion knows how to do faithful transfers right for classic films, and this Blu-Ray Disc is proof. Their transfer here has me looking forward to 1080p transfers of other vintage foreign/classic films.As if the gorgeous transfer wasn't good enough, Criterion has included plenty of bonus material as well .. In addition to the obligatory booklet the company includes with their releases (in this case it contains an essay, well worth reading), there are some interesting featurettes included on this disc. We get to see an interview with Jean-Pierre Leaud about his opinions of the film and acting, a French television program episode on film directors that focuses on Truffaut, as well as two commentaries and rare audition footage. When Criterion releases a movie, they almost always put out the definitive edition. This release of The 400 Blows proves that will be true for their Blu-Ray releases as well.The 400 Blows is that rare century-old movie whose message is as powerful today as it has ever been. With brilliant direction by Truffaut and a great performance from a young Jean-Pierre Le aud, this is the definitive film from the French New Wave.

It's a far more complex film than its simple plot would suggest which is why the film has such a powerful impact. Twelve year old Antoine seems to be a typical of a boy his age, but finds himself getting into trouble. We assume it will be mischief, but learn he has no real anchors to keep the mischief from getting more serious. His home life is unstable though from the outside it would appear he has doting and dedicated parents. There are also his teachers who seem to notice his infractions but none seem to get close enough to reach him. It is only later in the film where we realize the effects of the negligence and hurt on Antoine. Though the film concludes, we do not feel that the story is over. We want to know what happens to Antoine. Fortunately there are four other films with the character of Antoine Doinel all performed by Jean-Pierre Leaud so the viewer can once again become immersed in the ups and downs of Antoine's life.The film was critically acclaimed when it was shown at Cannes and Truffaut won awards for his direction and an award for best Catholic film (though the film is not based on a religious theme nor doe sit have specific Catholic references). We get a sense that something new is happening in this film, and we see the genius that will later be associated with Truffaut. The film is set in Paris and throughout we get a glimpse of typical Parisian life. The background music is somewhat basic with a 1950's Jazz like feel, but it is used effectively. Its' remorseful when the situation calls for it, but it is light and airy when Antoine is experiencing the adventures of childhood. The acting is superb, particularly Jean Pierre Leaud as Antoine and Patrick Aufay as his friend Rene.

He took risks with his story, adding details apparently as much from his own experience as from his imagination.  For  instance, the scene of the school outing in which the students marching  down the boulevard escape one by one or in pairs down this alley or that is  lifted from Vigo's Zero de Conduite.  But so many of the more painful  scenes involving Doinel's internment in juvenile camps feels closer to  experience than invention.  Truffaut elicits sympathy for the parents as  well as for Doinel's harrassed teachers.  But the boy, played with absolute  truth by Jean-Pierre Leaud (who would grow less believable with age), is  the heart and soul of the film - Truffaut's heart and soul, in fact. The  final freeze-frame ends the film with a poetic pause.

Everything, from Antoine's tragic personal history to his larger aspirations are merely talked about. Show don't tell.No doubt any comments on this review will talk about how I didn't get it.
