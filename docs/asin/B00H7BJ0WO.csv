No other complete season cost anywhere near that! Complete Fifth Season is $45.51 and Complete Sixth Season is $51.35. Perhaps the person at Amazon in charge of pricing goofed. If it is not Amazons fault then the producing studio wants to gouge (""screw"" would be more apropos) fans who have consistently bought each season. The price for the complete Season Seven needs to be adjusted SHARPLY DOWNWARD!!",1,A great series but fans are being taken to the clearners!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,577,"['one', 'great', 'series', 'Golden', 'Age', 'TV', 'said', 'gave', 'ONE', 'STAR', 'price', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'OF', 'LINE', '90.00', 'complete', '7th', 'Season', 'OBSCENE', 'other', 'complete', 'season', 'cost', 'anywhere', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', '45.51', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', '51.35', 'Perhaps', 'person', 'Amazon', 'charge', 'pricing', 'goofed', 'not', 'Amazons', 'fault', 'then', 'producing', 'studio', 'gouge', 'screw', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'apropos', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'consistently', 'bought', 'season', 'price', 'complete', 'Season', 'Seven', 'be', 'adjusted', 'SHARPLY', 'DOWNWARD']",Rawhide: Season 7 - Volume 1

1683909,AAQMDSR9B2EDR,B00H7BJ0WO,Midwest Reviewer,"[9, 10]","I just bought both of the Season 7 volumes at Walmart tonight for $19.96 each.  That's less than half of the price it is being sold for here on amazon.Rawhide is a great classic western TV series and long-term fans should be able to buy it at a reasonable price.  If you live within driving distance of a Walmart, call them and ask if your local store has this in stock, and the current price. It could be worth driving a few extra miles vs the current price of $44 here on amazon.I am really surprised amazon has not discounted this DVD release.UPDATE - 6/22/14:  Walmart no longer has this set in stock.  Amazon still has the price way too high. If you want to buy this, you probably will be better off waiting until later in the year, or next year, as the history of the prices on the previous sets has been a substantial discount after a year or more.  As far as the content of the DVD itself, the video quality is excellent, and although some of the episodes in Season 7 are unusual for Rawhide and not up to the standards of the prior seasons, overall it's still strong material you will want in your collection.",5,Here's where to find this cheaper!,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1118,"['just', 'bought', 'Season', '7', 'volumes', 'Walmart', 'tonight', '19.96', 'less', 'half', 'price', 'being', 'sold', 'here', 'amazon.Rawhide', 'great', 'classic', 'western', 'TV', 'series', 'long-term', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'reasonable', 'price', 'live', 'driving', 'distance', 'Walmart', 'call', 'ask', 'local', 'store', 'stock', 'current', 'price', 'could', 'be', 'worth', 'driving', 'few', 'extra', 'miles', 'vs', 'current', 'price', '44', 'here', 'amazon.I', 'am', 'really', 'surprised', 'amazon', 'not', 'discounted', 'DVD', 'release.UPDATE', '6/22/14', 'Walmart', 'no', 'longer', 'set', 'stock', 'Amazon', 'still', 'price', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'want', 'buy', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'waiting', 'later', 'year', 'next', 'year', 'history', 'prices', 'previous', 'sets', 'been', 'substantial', 'discount', 'year', 'more', 'As', 'far', 'content', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'Season', '7', 'are', 'unusual', 'Rawhide', 'not', 'standards', 'prior', 'seasons', 'overall', 'still', 'strong', 'material', 'will', 'want', 'collection']",Rawhide: Season 7 - Volume 1

1683911,A21X2QV24T7S9J,B00H7BJ0WO,Tomasi,"[1, 2]","Rawhide season seven,volume 1, is from the executive producing team of Bernard Kowalski and Bruce Geller, who would be replaced in the latter third of the season by Andre Bohem. The Kowalski/Geller shows, which have the busts of Rowdy, Mr Favor and Wishbone at the opening, are then mixed in with the Bohem shows (which feature Sheb Wooley as Pete Nolan in the opening credits). The last episode of the season, Incident Of The Gray Rock Hotel, guest starring Lola Albright, is a holdover from the K & G team, and wears a 1964 copyright date (the Bohem episodes all say copyright 1965). Season seven is a mixture of quality versus problem shows, which then slide into the poorly produced Ben Brady era episodes of season 8.",5,The Beginning Of The End For Rawhide,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,722,"['Rawhide', 'season', 'seven', 'volume', '1', 'executive', 'producing', 'team', 'Bernard', 'Kowalski', 'Bruce', 'Geller', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'latter', 'third', 'season', 'Andre', 'Bohem', 'Kowalski/Geller', 'shows', 'have', 'busts', 'Rowdy', 'Mr', 'Favor', 'Wishbone', 'opening', 'are', 'then', 'mixed', 'Bohem', 'shows', 'feature', 'Sheb', 'Wooley', 'Pete', 'Nolan', 'opening', 'credits', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'Incident', 'Gray', 'Rock', 'Hotel', 'guest', 'starring', 'Lola', 'Albright', 'holdover', 'K', 'G', 'team', '1964', 'copyright', 'date', 'Bohem', 'say', 'copyright', '1965', 'Season', 'seven', 'mixture', 'quality', 'versus', 'problem', 'shows', 'then', 'slide', 'poorly', 'produced', 'Ben', 'Brady', 'era', 'episodes', 'season', '8']",Rawhide: Season 7 - Volume 1
