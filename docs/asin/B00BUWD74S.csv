These are concerning renegade doctors of the &#34;Anti-Hypocratic&#34; Society who feel that the Hypocratic oath of the medical field holds medical science back.The real terror here is, the movies make it seem plausibly real.  I will hand it to the Germans for making me feel scared of doctors over this one.",5,Anatomy 1 & 2  Are worth the watch,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,421,"['know', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'winner', 'here', 'Anatomy', 'Anatomy', '2', 'are', 'German', 'made', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'concerning', 'renegade', 'doctors', '34', 'Anti-Hypocratic', '34', 'Society', 'who', 'feel', 'Hypocratic', 'oath', 'medical', 'field', 'medical', 'science', 'back.The', 'real', 'terror', 'here', 'movies', 'make', 'plausibly', 'real', 'will', 'hand', 'Germans', 'making', 'feel', 'scared', 'doctors', 'one']",Anatomy / Anatomy 2

After watching them, I felt they were good as far as the acting went. But that's about it. The story was ok, but could've been more evenly paced. the star, Franka Potente, was in the first one, but only had a couple of brief appearances in the second one. Only ok as thrillers.",3,"Good acting , okay movies",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,369,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'only', 'bought', 'were', 'inexpensive', 'watching', 'felt', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'went', 'story', 'was', 'ok', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'evenly', 'paced', 'star', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'only', 'had', 'couple', 'brief', 'appearances', 'second', 'one', 'Only', 'ok', 'thrillers']",Anatomy / Anatomy 2

The sequel, although not nearly as good, was still a decent sequel and pleasant to watch. Great price on this set. This set does have English subtitles for both films.
