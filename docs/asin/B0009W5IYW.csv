914214,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B0009W5IYW,Amanda Richards,"[40, 41]","Don't let this brightly colored CGI cartoon fool you into thinking it's only for kids.  This is one you can watch for the umpteenth time without rolling your eyes way up in your head, and is one of the most entertaining shows to come out recently.Each adventure takes place in the imagination of five young friends who turn their shared backyard into different fantasy worlds, each episode full of song and dance numbers of various music genres. Imagine hearing your kids singing `20s Jazz tunes while cartoon characters tap dance across the screen, and you'll pretty much get the idea.This DVD has four episodes:1. It's Great to Be a Ghost: This is the `20s Jazz episode, where Pablo (the blue penguin), Tyrone (the brown moose) and Uniqua (the pink spotted female of indeterminate species) pretend to be ghosts haunting an old house, and do their best to scare Tasha (the yellow hippo) an ""unsuspecting stranger"" who drops by the house.2. Monster Detectives: This one has an early rock n' roll theme, and features Tyrone as a detective and Uniqua, who has lost her soccer ball, as they go to the castle of Pablo the Soccer Monster to get it back.3. The Key to the Nile is another musical adventure, where Queen CleoTasha and her attendants Pablo, Tyrone and Austin (the purple kangaroo) seek three treasures of the Nile to present to the sphinx Uniqua.4. Pirate Treasure is my favorite, set to a reggae beat, as the friends learn to work together to uncover buried treasure. Arrrr!Janice Burgess has created a truly enjoyable, educational and fun series for all ages.Amanda Richards, December 27, 2005",5,A show for children that parents can actually enjoy,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1603,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'brightly', 'colored', 'CGI', 'cartoon', 'fool', 'thinking', 'only', 'kids', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'way', 'head', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'shows', 'come', 'out', 'recently.Each', 'adventure', 'place', 'imagination', 'five', 'young', 'friends', 'who', 'turn', 'shared', 'backyard', 'different', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'episode', 'full', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'various', 'music', 'genres', 'Imagine', 'hearing', 'kids', 'singing', '20s', 'Jazz', 'tunes', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'tap', 'dance', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'idea.This', 'DVD', 'four', 'episodes:1', 'Great', 'Be', 'Ghost', '20s', 'Jazz', 'episode', 'where', 'Pablo', 'blue', 'penguin', 'Tyrone', 'brown', 'moose', 'Uniqua', 'pink', 'spotted', 'female', 'indeterminate', 'species', 'pretend', 'be', 'ghosts', 'haunting', 'old', 'house', 'do', 'best', 'scare', 'Tasha', 'yellow', 'hippo', 'unsuspecting', 'stranger', 'who', 'drops', 'house.2', 'Monster', 'one', 'early', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'theme', 'Tyrone', 'detective', 'Uniqua', 'who', 'lost', 'soccer', 'ball', 'go', 'castle', 'Pablo', 'Soccer', 'Monster', 'get', 'back.3', 'Key', 'Nile', 'musical', 'adventure', 'where', 'Queen', 'CleoTasha', 'attendants', 'Pablo', 'Tyrone', 'Austin', 'purple', 'kangaroo', 'seek', 'three', 'treasures', 'Nile', 'present', 'sphinx', 'Uniqua.4', 'Pirate', 'Treasure', 'favorite', 'set', 'reggae', 'beat', 'friends', 'learn', 'work', 'together', 'uncover', 'buried', 'treasure', 'Arrrr', 'Janice', 'Burgess', 'created', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'educational', 'fun', 'series', 'ages.Amanda', 'Richards', 'December', '27', '2005']",The  Backyardigans - It's Great To Be A Ghost
914215,A1L8EJ3MTE72B8,B0009W5IYW,Anthrophile,"[0, 0]","I adore this series and I am a grown person, not to mention childless and single. I'm collecting these for my hypothetical future toddlers! The characters are adorable without being the least bit sappy or excessive, the variety  -- and authenticity!-- of dance and music styles presented are just lovely, and the lessons taught are subtle and sweet.  (It helps that I am also a big fan of computer animation.)My only complaint (hence the star deduction) is the same I have for most children's and ""children's"" (eg, sneaky adults') DVD releases -- why are they always put out in dribs and drabs, 2 or 3 episodes per DVD, rather than per season as most ""adult"" or mainstream series are? I feel slightly exploited whenever that happens. Other Nick shows have learned this lesson (""Avatar"" comes to mind) and have released larger collections -- why not ""Backyardigans""?I'll collect them anyway -- perhaps high sales will encourage them to put out the larger collections.

914216,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B0009W5IYW,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","As far as I'm concerned, The Backyardigans is one of the few shows for kids that really can be enjoyed by both children and their parents. The characters are cute and have their own personalities, nearly every single song is memorable, the music rocks, and the theme for each episode is always fun. I won't deny watching episodes until they're over, even if my daughter goes off and does something else if she loses interest. Heck, if I found a shirt with Tyrone on it, I'd go for it. This dvd has 4 episodes, like most of them do, and there's a good variety here. 2 of them are listed as 'bonus episodes', but why bother listing them as that when they're the same length as the 2 'main' ones, and no one would've probably bought this if it was just 2 episodes?First up is the title one, It's Great To Be a Ghost. Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua pretend to be ghosts in a spooky mansion when Tasha, the unsuspecting stranger, comes in uninvited. It's all in good fun, and they're not trying to hurt her or anything. The music for this episode is early jazz (1920s), and you can't help but snap your fingers along when Pablo sings his song.Monster Detectives has detective Tyrone help Uniqua find her soccer ball after it ends up at a castle where Pablo the Soccer Monster lives. The intro for this episode is really cute, and the gang even acknowledges humans in a rare instance, mentioning soccer legend Pel&eacute;. This episode's music is early rock (1950s) and they did a great job making it sound like the original jukebox hits. Someone's gotta edit a music video using the Soccer Monster song and footage of Happy Days.The Key to the Nile is one of my favorites, and an episode that has Tasha as the leader for a change. She's an Egyptian queen (CleoTasha) and has her servants help her find three treasures to give to the Sphinx, who's played by Uniqua. This episode teaches the importance of saying 'please' and 'thank you', and being appreciative to others who help you. For the music, you get more of a Broadway style, if that makes any sense. 'hard to explain really, but the songs are all memorable, especially 'I Want My River Back'.Finally is Pirate Treasure, which features reggae and ska for the soundtrack. Uniqua and Pablo are pirates looking for treasure using half of a treasure map, but pirates Tyrone and Austin are doing the same and happen to have the other half of the map as well. The Backyardigans sing a different version of the classing song 'Drunken Sailor' but calling it 'Scurvy Pirate' here so there's nothing objectionable. Just like the other episodes, the songs here are all a blast and the tone of the episode is just plain cheery.The only con to this dvd? Like all other Nick Jr. titles, there are TONS of previews you have to skip through at the beginning. Other than that, this is another must buy for any parents of kids who love the Backyardigans...or something to have as a kind of guilty pleasure if you can't admit to loving these tracks!",5,RIP Pablo.

914217,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0009W5IYW,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[16, 16]","""The Backyardigans"" is a fairly new series now airing in the United States and Canada about a group of five friends who get together and have adventures in their backyards. There's a lot of singing (all really quite good) and the animation is crisp CGI. The characters each have different and interesting personalities and the stories are strong. This is a Nelvana production and includes many staff that have worked on shows such as ""Franklin."" You'll also find if you check the credits that many former members of the ""Blue's Clues"" crew write for this show as well. So if you like either of those shows, or even if you don't, there's a good chance you or your kids will like this!This DVD has four complete episodes of the show --- ""It's Great To Be a Ghost!,"" ""Monster Detectives,"" ""The Key to the Nile,"" and ""Pirate Treasure."" These episodes have things to teach about bravery, politeness, facing your fears, speaking up and other important themes. So not only will you / your kids learn a lot, but you'll be entertained too.The special features are as follows:Promos --- These included promos for ""Dora's Dance to the Rescue,""Blue's Room"" on video and DVD, full length Dora specials and ""My Little Pony's A Very Minty Christmas."" You can't skip the promos at the start on the DVD version, although you can fast-forward through them.""A Pirate Says Arr"" Music Video --- The best special feature on the disc. A music video version of one of the best songs from the included episodes.Meet the Backyardigans --- Each Backyardigan is shown while an instrumental version of the main show theme plays. Facts about the characters are displayed on the screen, but aren't read out loud.How to Be a Backyardigan --- Tips on how to dress up and stuff to become various things that the Backyardigans become, such as ghosts or pirates.While the special features weren't thrilling, they were kind of nice. That's why I've given this four stars and not five --- I believe that in order for DVDs of this type to really stand out and be deserving of five stars, they must include great special features.The audio does not have any subtitles available, but you can turn on close-captioning.

Now my daughter can take time out from playing, and watch/sing/dance to some entertaining characters, it is one show I am glad she watches and will watch with her.",4,Entertaining at any time.,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,798,"['just', 'recently', 'bought', 'daughter', 'department', 'work', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Backyardigans', 'tv', 'am', 'glad', 'have', '4', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars.The', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'vibrant', 'songs', 'are', 'pleasent', 'catchy', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'one', 'annoying', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'interested', 'other', 'shows', 'Dora', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'etc', ""'m"", 'glad', 'interested', 'Backyardigans', 'along', 'even', 'laughs.I', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'something', 'GOOD', 'child', 'watch', 'Thank', 'Nick', 'Jr', 'having', 'decent', 'show', 'out', 'Now', 'daughter', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'playing', 'watch/sing/dance', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'one', 'show', 'am', 'glad', 'watches', 'will', 'watch']",The  Backyardigans - It's Great To Be A Ghost
