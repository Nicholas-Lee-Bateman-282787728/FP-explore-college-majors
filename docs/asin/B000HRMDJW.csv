It seems to be a shame that it was a true story becuse it had such tragedy in it.,3,It was good,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,163,"['think', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'sometimes', 'be', 'shame', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'such', 'tragedy']",N/A
1015802,A3J6ZKBPU8YTX8,B000HRMDJW,Kate70,"[0, 0]","Being fond of Tess Harper, I made a point of catching this when it was on network TV. The young actors do a competent job, but I find that Harper is so quintessential in bringing out even a minor role such as the mother of the missing girl. Based on a true story, the plot revolves around a spoiled selfish rich boy who has his all-American sweetheart at his own school, and another lusty interest played by Soleil Moon Frye, a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks. The pacing is interesting with the scenes switching from one love interest to another as if to compare the emotional intensity of the two relationships. However, Tess Harper steals the show as the worried mom concerned about her missing daughter. Worth the time.",4,I'm a Tess Harper fan...,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,735,"['Being', 'fond', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'made', 'point', 'catching', 'when', 'was', 'network', 'TV', 'young', 'actors', 'do', 'competent', 'job', 'find', 'Harper', 'so', 'quintessential', 'bringing', 'out', 'even', 'minor', 'role', 'such', 'mother', 'missing', 'girl', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'plot', 'around', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'rich', 'boy', 'who', 'all-American', 'sweetheart', 'own', 'school', 'lusty', 'interest', 'played', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'poor', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'pacing', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'switching', 'one', 'love', 'interest', 'compare', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'two', 'relationships', 'However', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'show', 'worried', 'mom', 'concerned', 'missing', 'daughter', 'time']",N/A
