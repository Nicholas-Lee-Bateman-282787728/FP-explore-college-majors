None of the episodes contain anything jaw dropping, and its short length works against it, but it's still a very fun, mostly episodic series. Well worth the tenner I spent on it.In case you're anywhere, Gokusen is about a yakuza gang leader (of sorts) teaching a class of delinquents. Comedy ensues as she tries to hide her other identity and not show her students her martial art skills.What helps the series out is its small cast of characters. While the 13 episode length prevented me from ever getting to know all of the cast in depth, I still learned enough about the lesser members to understand them and the more important characters did receive some development. It worked rather well as a comedy series with a small scope.I can't say I understand why a fugly dog, who could walk on two legs, smoked and had thoughts in English was included, though. Most viewers of Gokusen hate the pointless dog with passion.It's a shame the anime only lasts for 13 episodes. The manga has 15 volumes, so there was a lot more than what was included that could've been used. From what I've read, the one thing the short length of the anime did was allow for the story to flow better and not leave the viewer thinking the plot was wandering aimlessly for lengthy periods, but I still would've liked to see more episodes. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have found myself too bored if the series had lasted for 26 episodes...In terms of plot threads I wanted to see the until completion, the conclusion of the KumikoxShin/teacherxstudent subplot, which had been building since the start, would've been nice to see. I doubt it would've gone anywhere because of their age difference, but there was definitely something there - Shin even got jealous in the final episode.Watching Gokusen has made me want to watch the GTO anime at some point. The manga is a bit too long and expensive. The problem is, at present it'd cost 43 or so to import the two R1 box sets...unless I try TRS. Not bad but I'd rather wait to see if the pound raises in value more - it isn't as if I'm in a rush, after all.",4,GTO 2,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,2141,"['Gokusen', '8/10A', 'great', 'alternative', 'GTO', 'Great', 'Teacher', 'Onizuka', 'None', 'episodes', 'contain', 'anything', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'short', 'length', 'still', 'very', 'fun', 'mostly', 'episodic', 'series', 'Well', 'tenner', 'spent', 'it.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'anywhere', 'Gokusen', 'yakuza', 'gang', 'leader', 'sorts', 'teaching', 'class', 'delinquents', 'Comedy', 'ensues', 'hide', 'other', 'identity', 'not', 'show', 'students', 'martial', 'art', 'series', 'out', 'small', 'cast', 'characters', '13', 'episode', 'length', 'prevented', 'ever', 'getting', 'know', 'cast', 'depth', 'still', 'learned', 'enough', 'lesser', 'members', 'understand', 'more', 'important', 'characters', 'did', 'receive', 'development', 'worked', 'rather', 'well', 'comedy', 'series', 'small', 'scope.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'understand', 'why', 'fugly', 'dog', 'who', 'could', 'walk', 'two', 'legs', 'smoked', 'had', 'thoughts', 'English', 'was', 'included', 'though', 'Most', 'viewers', 'Gokusen', 'hate', 'pointless', 'dog', 'passion.It', 'shame', 'anime', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'manga', '15', 'volumes', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'included', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'one', 'thing', 'short', 'length', 'anime', 'did', 'was', 'allow', 'story', 'flow', 'better', 'not', 'leave', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'plot', 'was', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'lengthy', 'periods', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'too', 'bored', 'series', 'had', 'lasted', '26', 'episodes', 'terms', 'plot', 'threads', 'wanted', 'see', 'completion', 'conclusion', 'KumikoxShin/teacherxstudent', 'subplot', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'start', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'doubt', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'anywhere', 'age', 'difference', 'there', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'there', 'Shin', 'even', 'got', 'jealous', 'final', 'episode.Watching', 'Gokusen', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'GTO', 'anime', 'point', 'manga', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'expensive', 'problem', 'present', ""'d"", 'cost', '43', 'so', 'import', 'two', 'R1', 'box', 'sets', 'try', 'TRS', 'Not', 'bad', ""'d"", 'rather', 'wait', 'see', 'pound', 'value', 'more', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'rush']",N/A

I mean I wish one of my teachers would have stuck-up for me!The short story of Kumiko Yamagushi, the GokuSen, and her effort to ""raise"" her class of delinquents is fun and not without silly humor.  I laughed quite abit. There is, artless, swearing (mostly a.., b..ch and G.d d.mn).  There is no nudity although there is some sexual inuendo.  What would you expect from high school age boys?  There is single, class against class and gang rivalry featured in this tale which many may find familiar from their high school days.All in all it's a pretty light and tight short story of the adventures of a high school junior class and their, first year, homeroom teacher who just happens to be an Ojuo (Yakuza heiress).
