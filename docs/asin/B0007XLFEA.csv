Not only this but also the sound of a classic church hymnal as background music sets the tone for a Christian religious movie.  The narration that follows, is by no means boring or soporific, as the music and voice and images presented are very engaging and intellectually stimulating.This documentary focuses solely on ""The Life, Convictions and Martyrdom of"" a man by the name Dietrich Bonhoeffer at the orders of no other than Adolf Hitler and his henchmen.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a pastor, theologian, university professor, anti-Nazi conspirator, and martyr who detected early on the evils of a new monster rising amidst his germanic countrymen (Adolf Hitler as Fuehrer, racism as means of national liberation, the deification of state authority, the corruption of the state churches) and amidst Christendom before the break of WWII in September 1939. His theology and actions also saved the lives of some Jews he personally helped escape to Switzerland.The presentation is rich in quotes from his writings, church sermons, and letters he wrote.  One gets the feeling of familiarity with his books (""Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Faith in Community,"" ""Cost of Discipleship / Nachfolge,"" ""Letters and Papers from Prison"") after viewing this film.  Also quite a bit of time is spent explaining the geopolitical and social situation of Germany between the end of WWI and capitulation of German army in 1945 and during Dietrich's time abroad in Barcelona/Spain, American, and England.This Christian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, had a living theology and a theology that was alive.  And his life and writings are as relevant to our post-modern lives as they were to the turbulent 30s and murderous 40s.As a companion (especially for the un-churched or non-Christians) I would also recommend the 2003 First Run Features production of ""Bonhoeffer - Pastor, Pacifist, Nazi Resister"" also found on Amazon DVD.Because His ""grace"" is ""costly!""

The story of Bonhoeffer starts out slowly (with his family history, growing up, etc.) but draws one in as the Nazis not only take over Germany but also its churches.

""Hanged On A Twisted Cross"" is a informative and engaging documentary on the life, times, and thought of this man who was martyred for his beliefs. Drawing upon archival footage, historical documents, and visits to original locations, ""Hanged Upon A Twisted Cross"" provides an intimate and insightful portrait of a man whose life and writings grew (and continue to grow) in their theological influence within the Christian community, and still powerfully speak to contemporary issues a half century after Bonhoeffer's death. Viewers will benefit from Bonhoeffer's views on how men of peace come to employ violence when combating unrestrained evil. What is to be done when deep-seated patriotism and their religion-based ethics compels Christians to oppose their fatherland and its demonic leader. The DVD format is thoroughly ""user friendly"". With a total running time of two hours, ""Hanged On A Twisted Cross"" is strongly recommended viewing and a welcome contribution to personal, seminary, and academic Christian Studies collections.",5,"A informative and engaging documentary on the life, times, and thought of this man who was martyred for his beliefs",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,1164,"['Biblical', 'Theologian', 'Dietrich', 'Bonhoeffer', 'was', 'executed', 'Nazis', 'just', 'days', 'Allies', 'defeated', 'Germany', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Hanged', 'A', 'Twisted', 'Cross', 'informative', 'engaging', 'documentary', 'life', 'times', 'thought', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'martyred', 'beliefs', 'Drawing', 'archival', 'footage', 'historical', 'documents', 'visits', 'original', 'locations', 'Hanged', 'A', 'Twisted', 'Cross', 'intimate', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'man', 'life', 'writings', 'grew', 'continue', 'grow', 'theological', 'influence', 'Christian', 'community', 'still', 'powerfully', 'speak', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'half', 'century', 'Bonhoeffer', 'death', 'Viewers', 'will', 'benefit', 'Bonhoeffer', 'views', 'how', 'men', 'peace', 'come', 'employ', 'violence', 'when', 'combating', 'unrestrained', 'evil', 'What', 'be', 'done', 'when', 'deep-seated', 'patriotism', 'religion-based', 'ethics', 'compels', 'Christians', 'oppose', 'fatherland', 'demonic', 'leader', 'DVD', 'format', 'thoroughly', 'user', 'friendly', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'Hanged', 'A', 'Twisted', 'Cross', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'welcome', 'contribution', 'personal', 'seminary', 'academic', 'Christian', 'Studies', 'collections']",N/A

Dr. Bonhoeffer challenged the church of his day calling them to abandon the cheap grace of faith without obedience inThe Cost of Discipleship.  Many can rant against the cowardice that leads Christians to compromise with Ceaser - few can live that challenge to it's inevitable conclusion as Bonhoeffer did.  He chose to speak out against Nazism when the majority of Christians in Germany confused their nationalist message with patriotism.  He chose to speak for peace against the tide of Christians who glorified war.  Finally, torn by a commitment to peace and doing nothing in the face of mass murder, he chose to seek Hitler's death.  He paid with great honor and dignity with his life.  His was a life devoted to Christ and his sufferings through obedience.  His story is an inspiration that all Christians, Catholic and Protestant, need desperately to resist compromise for the sake of expediency.Very highly recommended for Christians of all persuasions.
