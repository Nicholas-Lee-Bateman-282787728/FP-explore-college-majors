What I'm writing here is to urge you to purchase the DVD set, if you are like me.  The set is impeccable - the brightness and clarity of the images are outstanding and the set is flawless.  The three hours, 24 minutes of extras are full of illuminating bits and pieces and the 46 minutes of each actual show (mercifully minus the commercials) is an easier take than the original airings were with all the commercial distraction.

Cullum,"[3, 4]","Before Danni Behr hosted THE LITTLEST GROOM on Fox she could be seen mincing around hosting this gay version of THE BACHELOR which had a secret twist in that ""Some of the eligible (?) gay men have been replaced with straight ones!""

Some are very obvious, and some are not.  But in the end do you care was the real question?SURVIVOR, TOP MODEL ... some reality shows are fraught with competition and feats of skill (okay TOP MODEL has catwalks - but it is a skill damn it!).  Here we get group dates and suspicions.  Entertaining yes.  Edifying? um ... no!  James the potenital bachelor is cute beyond belief and the idea he would have trouble getting dates is beyond me.  Oh, but then there is his annoying fag hag friend who literally goes ballistic when she learns of the UNFAIR twist.  She screams and cries like a banshee!  Yeesh!  So THAT'S WHY HE CAN'T GET A DATE!  Ditch the straight girl and all will be well.  The guys are all cute to some degree, and it's not a bad watch ... but I felt like I needed a shower by the end of its short run on Bravo.I'm all for the idea that gay or straight we're all human!

I understood them both cause even if it was a reality game dating show,feelings are something not to play with,& friendships & love was truly developing among each other. Crucial moment to reveal the real plot of the show. Plus the purpose of the show too was to let the viewers open their minds more to the gay community & see us as equal cause we truly are with the exception of our sexual preferences.All in all this show is very good & very entertaining,you'll get to see the similarity & the difference between gay & straight people which is not that much of a big deal cause we're all human beings.",5,Hesitation at first sight,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1351,"['cable', 'package', 'never', 'BRAVO', 'So', 'obviously', 'never', 'got', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'when', 'saw', 'dvd', 'release', 'online', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'hesitated', 'lot', 'purchasing', 'cause', ""'m"", 'not', 'reality', 'show', 'viewer', 'decided', 'purchase', 'show', 'dvd', 'getting', 'more', 'info', 'online.I', 'needed', 'be', 'sure', 'money', 'invested', 'show', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'so', 'reading', 'reviews', 'reviews', 'show', 'changed', 'mind', 'gave', 'fair', 'chance.Honestly', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'stopping', 'humor', 'situations', 'plot', 'was', 'fantastic', 'real', 'plot', 'was', 'revealed', 'JAMES', 'ANDRA', 'knew', 'were', 'straight', 'guys', 'contestants', 'caused', 'ANDRA', 'throw', 'history', 'making', 'tantrum', 'understood', 'cause', 'even', 'was', 'reality', 'game', 'dating', 'show', 'feelings', 'are', 'something', 'not', 'play', 'friendships', 'love', 'was', 'truly', 'developing', 'other', 'Crucial', 'moment', 'reveal', 'real', 'plot', 'show', 'purpose', 'show', 'too', 'was', 'let', 'viewers', 'open', 'minds', 'more', 'gay', 'community', 'see', 'equal', 'cause', 'truly', 'are', 'exception', 'sexual', 'preferences.All', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'similarity', 'difference', 'gay', 'straight', 'people', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'big', 'deal', 'cause', ""'re"", 'human', 'beings']",N/A

I was hoping it would come to dvd and I got my wish! It's definitely worth watching! If you enjoy reality shows like the bachelor or any of those dating shows, and you want to see gay men, here it is. Obviously this isn't premium cable, so you're not going to see much eye candy (except for one nude scene of a straight guy in a shower on the dvd), but you will see plenty of bare chests. I thought the leading man, James seemed like a nice guy along with his friend, Andra. Speaking of her, if you've ever seen Mad TV make fun of her, you'll see why when you watch this set! That tantrum she threw was classic (not that I blame her) and they even have the entire unedited version of that segment as a special feature on the bonus disc. Its pretty lengthy too (about 30 to 35 minutes!) There also other special features on the bonus disc like unaired interview spots with the gay and straight men, deleted scenes, a ""where are they now"" letter update from each of them (unfortunately the star, James, didn't send his update in nor did a few others), and some other features.

816793,A283RV05QVUTVI,B0001XARNQ,"Michael L. Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[0, 0]","I think between 2003 and now we have seen enough contrived ""reality"" shows bordering on cruelty (starving people, people thrown against stationary objects, people eating bugs, etc.) that we can rest our righteous indignation about the ""twist"" on this show for long enough to enjoy it for what it is.A very handsome and VERY well-composed ""leading man,"" James is looking for love, or something like it, in a sea of 15 very eligible (read: cute) bachelors.  We get to watch him, and his gal pal Andra, negotiate the contrived speed dates and ""mingle dinners"" in their ongoing efforts to determine which bachelor is the right one for James.  The ""twist"" is both the silver bullet that ups the ante enough to make the stress palpable (and leads to a LOT of drama) and the Achilles heel that makes the show feel less like reality and more like a bad game show at points.This one-shot series is full of humor, suspense, tears, hellos and goodbyes, and has some real astonishing moments.  If it's true that men are unwilling or unable to express their emotions, then James is the proof (well, sometimes) and the other guys are the proof otherwise as they movingly grieve the loss of their friends after eliminations.  Andra, too, is the embodiment of all the emotions James cannot express, and her inclusion in the show helps to tell the whole story.If it's true that editing makes the difference between a good show and a boring one, then the editors need some extra credit for this one.  There is hardly a moment that doesn't have significance.  The great houses and landscapes fill out the scenario nicely.Being the eternal optimist, I choose to believe that most of the people on the show and behind the scenes had good intentions.  There are a number of lessons to be learned, including the human capacities for deceit as well as compassion, the differences (or lack thereof) between straight and gay men, and certainly studies in how to conduct yourself with grace (or not, Andra) under fire.  I think most people can look through the ""bad"" to see the good; it's certainly there.Highly recommended.

816794,A2R9J5LULVKF6T,B0001XARNQ,Michael T. Rognlien,"[31, 33]","I never actually watched this show when it aired because in the initial round of advertising, we, the viewers, were actually told what James was not: that of the 15 guys fighting for James' attention, 8 were straight.  However, I admit that in a moment of weakness, the absolutely adorable star of the show was enough to get me to fork over the cash to see what the heck it was actually about.When watching 'reality' TV one has to realize that 'reality' TV has nothing to do with reality at all; rather, it's an opportunity to take the non-famous and put them in dangerous/ridiculous/humiliating circumstances and see how they deal with it.  This show was no exception - and while I'm glad that Bravo has been delving into gay-themed television, shame on them.There's a catch, here, though.  If you actually get the DVD's, a few key points shine through.  Number one, James and Andra truly ARE quality people.  On the third disc, there is a 30+ minute segment just showing their discussion about their manipulation by the producers of the show and how disappointed they were that they had become pawns in a stupid gay-for-pay game.  For those fans of 'reality' TV - take a good hard look at this segment and maybe you'll learn a bit more about what the networks DON'T show - people getting hurt and not wanting to be used for entertainment purposes.The rest of the set with the shows themselves are fairly forgettable simply because the premise itself was deceptive not only to the participants but to the audience.  It's almost excruciating to watch James develop feelings for people who are simply there for the cash 'n grab.  While James is beautiful and sweet and charming (there's hope after all, kids) it's a shame that he and his friend (and most of the 'contestants') were used for the sake of a television show.
