1436107,AD72JX34ADM8H,B0050UEVQY,Joseph Stinson,"[3, 4]","After about the third season being released I immediately purchased Part 1 and 2 for Season 3. After watching both of them I can honestly say that it didn't disappoint me. I really enjoyed the first season of this show, and then when watching the season it seemed like it started off really well and just started to drag out toward the end of part 2 season 2. This season has taken it and pushed it back up to where it was at the beginning of the second season for me. If I had to rank this in comparison to Part 1 of this season, I'd say that Part 2 comes out on top. There is plenty to laugh at as usual so go try it and enjoy your copy today.",5,If you liked the first two seasons you'll like this.,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,645,"['third', 'season', 'being', 'released', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'Part', '1', '2', 'Season', '3', 'watching', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'then', 'when', 'watching', 'season', 'seemed', 'started', 'off', 'really', 'well', 'just', 'started', 'drag', 'out', 'end', 'part', '2', 'season', '2', 'season', 'taken', 'pushed', 'back', 'up', 'where', 'was', 'beginning', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'rank', 'comparison', 'Part', '1', 'season', ""'d"", 'say', 'Part', '2', 'out', 'top', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'as', 'usual', 'so', 'go', 'try', 'enjoy', 'copy', 'today']","Shin Chan: Season 3, Part Two"

That's just one of the many reasons this show should have ore than 3 seasons.  The last episode is hysterical and just makes you want more!!!,5,To be a man you must have honor....,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,284,"['.I', 'would', 'finish', 'line', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'out', 'season', '1', 'conclusion', '.and', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'trouble', 'language', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'ore', '3', 'seasons', 'last', 'episode', 'hysterical', 'just', 'want', 'more']","Shin Chan: Season 3, Part Two"
