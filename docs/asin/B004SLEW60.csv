The cast was solid at best ** The main characters (females and males for you ladies) are very easy on the eyes and that helps**. It had a few laugh/funny moments and some serious times. The plot was surprisingly well thought out and for a play it was watchable. I guess the problem my wife and I had was why any of this (actions of the 2 lead characters) even took place. ***** This is not a spoiler just some of the plot/beginning first 5-10 min play that is already stated*****  Russell (Christian Keys) and Bailey (Jazsmin Lewis) call their marriage over years ago but they agreed to stay together until their son left for college. He leaves and Bailey (Jazsmin Lewis)does try to work it out with him but he has no interest in making it work. Why????? that little bit is missing for me (In my opinion). Her best friend then sets her up on a blind date etc.... There is a brief conversation and mention that they broke up because he cheated on her and she was not taking care of business at home etc.. Maybe we were just to assume that he cheated a few times maybe hit her or something and they argued a lot etc... Since none of that ever happened on stage (yes I know it's a play and can only have a certain run time) I just did not see why they could not get along and work it out.I guess if they did work it out we would not have this play LOL. Aside from that we enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars.,4,Not A+ but worth a watch,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,1489,"['Not', 'too', 'sure', 'how', 'review', 'one', 'wife', 'happen', 'catch', 'one', 'night', 'TV', 'cast', 'was', 'solid', 'best', 'main', 'characters', 'females', 'males', 'ladies', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'helps**', 'had', 'few', 'laugh/funny', 'moments', 'serious', 'times', 'plot', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'play', 'was', 'watchable', 'guess', 'problem', 'wife', 'had', 'was', 'why', 'actions', '2', 'lead', 'characters', 'even', 'took', 'place', '*****', 'not', 'spoiler', 'just', 'plot/beginning', 'first', '5-10', 'min', 'play', 'already', 'stated*****', 'Russell', 'Christian', 'Keys', 'Bailey', 'Jazsmin', 'Lewis', 'call', 'marriage', 'years', 'ago', 'agreed', 'stay', 'together', 'son', 'left', 'college', 'Bailey', 'Jazsmin', 'Lewis', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'interest', 'making', 'work', 'Why', 'little', 'bit', 'missing', 'opinion', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'etc', 'brief', 'conversation', 'mention', 'broke', 'up', 'cheated', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'home', 'etc..', 'Maybe', 'were', 'just', 'assume', 'cheated', 'few', 'times', 'maybe', 'hit', 'something', 'argued', 'lot', 'etc', 'none', 'ever', 'happened', 'stage', 'yes', 'know', 'play', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'certain', 'run', 'time', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'work', 'guess', 'did', 'work', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'play', 'LOL', 'Aside', 'enjoyed', 'gave', '4', 'stars']",Perfect Man

They can pretend to be anyone, doing any kind of job, CEOs, PRESIDENTS of Corp, Millionairs, Moguels, and all other kinds of lies they tell to meet a woman, and get over.This guy,Jason, said he was celebit 3 yrs; own his own company; lied he gave his heart to someone else, and he died after it ended. She fell for it when he said he was celebit.It's a shame that it takes only a little bit for a man to say a few chosen words before a woman faLL all over herself for him and eat every word up he says, lies and all.  Womem can be so gullible being desperate for a man.  Need to love yourself first, and date yourself, love you, get to know you and who you are, and be YOUR BEST FRIEND,FIRST, BEFORE YOU LOVE ANOTHER.  That's where women get lost and get messed over so badly. Looking for a man to fulfill them instead of being fulfilled within yourself and In God.Dont let a man idendify who you are. You are someone without a man.Her girlfriend was too eager to get her out on a date  soon after her husband left instead of encouraging her to be a good wife to her man. Had a baby and gave it all to him and left hubby alone. He got tired of being alone with no love from her and found it someone else. That is when friends, parents, pastor, someone responsible  should have counselled them/her to take care of your man also or you will lose him.Jason showed up at her house with wine and rose petals and hubby came in and she put him out over Jason in his house. But Jason was a snake and put a mickey in her drink to rape her, and was saved by son and hubby.You'd have to see it to find out what happened.  I did not like he girls gettting together looking and acting ghetto. We can do better than that making these plays. We have to stop making the world think this is the only way African American are and act.  IT'S A LIE. We must come out of the box white hollywood put us in and show the true life of many great black relationship, dating and families.",3,INTERNET DATING IS DANGEROUS - STUPID.,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,2025,"['Everybody', 'internet', 'looking', 'date', ""'LIES"", 'LIES', 'LIES', 'can', 'pretend', 'be', 'anyone', 'doing', 'kind', 'job', 'CEOs', 'PRESIDENTS', 'Corp', 'Millionairs', 'Moguels', 'other', 'kinds', 'lies', 'tell', 'meet', 'woman', 'get', 'over.This', 'guy', 'Jason', 'said', 'was', 'celebit', '3', 'yrs', 'own', 'own', 'company', 'lied', 'gave', 'heart', 'someone', 'else', 'died', 'ended', 'fell', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'celebit.It', 'shame', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'man', 'say', 'few', 'chosen', 'words', 'woman', 'faLL', 'eat', 'word', 'Womem', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'gullible', 'being', 'desperate', 'man', 'Need', 'love', 'first', 'date', 'love', 'get', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'be', 'YOUR', 'BEST', 'FRIEND', 'FIRST', 'YOU', 'LOVE', 'ANOTHER', 'where', 'women', 'get', 'lost', 'get', 'messed', 'so', 'badly', 'Looking', 'man', 'fulfill', 'instead', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'God.Dont', 'let', 'man', 'idendify', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'someone', 'man.Her', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'too', 'eager', 'get', 'out', 'date', 'soon', 'husband', 'left', 'instead', 'encouraging', 'be', 'good', 'wife', 'man', 'Had', 'baby', 'gave', 'left', 'hubby', 'alone', 'got', 'tired', 'being', 'alone', 'love', 'found', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'friends', 'parents', 'pastor', 'someone', 'responsible', 'should', 'have', 'counselled', 'them/her', 'take', 'care', 'man', 'also', 'will', 'lose', 'him.Jason', 'showed', 'up', 'house', 'wine', 'rose', 'petals', 'hubby', 'came', 'put', 'out', 'Jason', 'house', 'Jason', 'was', 'snake', 'put', 'mickey', 'drink', 'rape', 'was', 'saved', 'son', 'hubby.You', ""'d"", 'have', 'see', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'gettting', 'together', 'looking', 'acting', 'ghetto', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'making', 'plays', 'have', 'stop', 'making', 'world', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'African', 'American', 'are', 'act', 'IT', 'A', 'LIE', 'must', 'come', 'box', 'white', 'hollywood', 'put', 'show', 'true', 'life', 'many', 'great', 'black', 'relationship', 'dating', 'families']",Perfect Man
