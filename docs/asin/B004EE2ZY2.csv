Terry,"[3, 12]","If I hadn't read up on All-Star Superman before it came out and knew it'd be based on the comics, I'd have been very displeased with this entry.As such, knowing which comic line of Superman it's based on helps. As an animated adaptation of the comics, it's not bad, they did manage to find and create a common thread throughout the story, but it still creates a largely episodic feel and you can really pick out 4-5 major episodic moments or shorts all tied together. When Superman creates the serum for Lois Lane so she can experience what it's like to have superpowers, I'm very much reminded of a series of comics from the early career of superman where there were some off the wall stories between superman and lois.I wouldn't reccomend the 2-Disc feature just to get the two Superman the Animated series episodes. If you've collected up the complete Animated series prior to this, you've got the episodes already. Stick with the one-disc, that's more worth the time and money.I will give kudos towards the end of the movie, when Luther has drunk the super serum, the line of dialogue he has and ""This is how Superman sees us?"" when talking about being able to see atoms and how everything and everyone is connected, we're not separate. That's good and makes for a redeeming factor to this movie.So disjointed, episodic. It is good for someone who knows Superman, but doesn't know him that well where history and continuity are concerned.

1397947,A3IVAJOW2BP5DT,B004EE2ZY2,Anonymous,"[5, 6]","The major problem with ALL-STAR SUPERMAN is that it tries too hard to emulate the original 12-part storyline, but without the creativity or pacing that storyline contained.  Grant Morrison was able to take several seemingly random & quirky plot elements, and make them work because he's just that good of a writer.  It also didn't hurt to have Frank Quitely as an artist.Unfortunately, you had people on this film who simply read the comics at face value and attempted to make a carbon copy animiated film out of them.  And not suprisingly, it just doesn't work.  The subplots come across as out-of-place and it takes away the emotional impact of the central storyline and conclusion.  None of it really felt connected.  It also didn't t help that the voice acting is very uninspired - as if the actors were just reading their lines as they come across a teleprompter.So why give it 3 stars?  Because I do applaud them for NOT deviating from the source material as they did with SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY.  There is a strong effort to stay true to the original storyline, even if they didn't execute it properly.  And the animation is outstanding in spite of the poor pacing.My recommendation would be to try and watch this via NETFLIX, and not necessarily waste money on the individual BLU-RAY or DVD.",3,Uneven,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1295,"['major', 'problem', 'ALL-STAR', 'SUPERMAN', 'too', 'hard', 'emulate', 'original', '12-part', 'storyline', 'creativity', 'pacing', 'storyline', 'contained', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'several', 'seemingly', 'random', 'quirky', 'plot', 'elements', 'make', 'work', 'just', 'good', 'writer', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'have', 'Frank', 'Quitely', 'artist.Unfortunately', 'had', 'people', 'film', 'who', 'simply', 'read', 'comics', 'face', 'value', 'attempted', 'make', 'carbon', 'copy', 'animiated', 'film', 'not', 'suprisingly', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'subplots', 'come', 'out-of-place', 'away', 'emotional', 'impact', 'central', 'storyline', 'conclusion', 'None', 'really', 'felt', 'connected', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 't', 'help', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'uninspired', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'reading', 'lines', 'come', 'teleprompter.So', 'why', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'do', 'applaud', 'NOT', 'deviating', 'source', 'material', 'did', 'SUPERMAN', 'DOOMSDAY', 'strong', 'effort', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'storyline', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'execute', 'properly', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'spite', 'poor', 'pacing.My', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'try', 'watch', 'NETFLIX', 'not', 'necessarily', 'waste', 'money', 'individual', 'BLU-RAY', 'DVD']",N/A
1397948,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B004EE2ZY2,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[1, 2]","The Man of Steel is dying after receiving an extreme dose of solar radiation. Trying to live out his last days and wrap up all loose ends, he spends it with Lois and gives her a special serum that grants her superpowers for twenty-four hours. When unexpected twists and turns arise, the two must save Metropolis together. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has plans of his own and when he gets his hands on the serum that granted Lois superpowers, he becomes as powerful as Superman.Can the Last Son of Krypton stop his arch nemesis while also saving the Earth from a damaged sun before he perishes?When I think of classic Superman, I think of this story. The reason is because this story involves all of the classic elements of Superman lore, everything from the basics like Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, all the way to the Fortress of Solitude, the bottle city of Kandor, a full array of superpowers--and in the case of this story, some new ones, which reminds me of the ""bonus"" powers portrayed in Superman IV (though they're not silly in this one like they were in that flick)--the Phantom Zone, Superman using not only his super brawn but also his super brains, Lois having superpowers (which has happened quite a lot in Supes's history--she's got a cool costume in this, by the way), and a ton more.Based on the graphic novel by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, this flick asks the hard questions about Superman's mortality, if such a thing is possible, and if it is possible, then how would that possibly play out? Unlike Superman's death when the Man of Steel went up against Doomsday, this story isn't about a giant slugfest, but about a slow death caused by the very thing that gives Superman his powers: the sun. It's about him coming to terms with his own mortality and setting things in order before his final moment arrives.One of the great things about these direct-to-DVD super flicks from DC is they're all stand-alone features based on a graphic novel and by being so, they also carry with it the same art style from the book. In this case, it's Frank Quitely's art animated. I admit it took a while for his art to grow on me. Perhaps because it's so simple and clean, yet by being that way, he's able to create some pretty realistic-looking superheroes. Seeing it animated like we do in this flick brings Superman et al. to life and makes this comic book fan very happy.Out of all the Superman adaptations done thus far, All-Star Superman is one of the greats and gets high props for being an awesome animated flick with a great cast, great art direction, a great story and, most importantly, having the greatest hero of them all, one who's definitely an all-star: Superman.Highly recommended.",5,Good Super-Flick!,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,2697,"['Man', 'Steel', 'dying', 'receiving', 'extreme', 'dose', 'solar', 'radiation', 'Trying', 'live', 'out', 'last', 'days', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Lois', 'special', 'serum', 'superpowers', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'When', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'arise', 'two', 'must', 'save', 'Metropolis', 'together', 'Meanwhile', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'plans', 'own', 'when', 'hands', 'serum', 'granted', 'Lois', 'superpowers', 'as', 'powerful', 'Superman.Can', 'Last', 'Son', 'Krypton', 'stop', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'also', 'saving', 'Earth', 'damaged', 'sun', 'When', 'think', 'classic', 'Superman', 'think', 'story', 'reason', 'story', 'classic', 'elements', 'Superman', 'lore', 'everything', 'basics', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'way', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'bottle', 'city', 'Kandor', 'full', 'array', 'superpowers', 'case', 'story', 'new', 'ones', 'bonus', 'powers', 'portrayed', 'Superman', 'IV', ""'re"", 'not', 'silly', 'one', 'were', 'flick', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'Superman', 'using', 'not', 'only', 'super', 'brawn', 'also', 'super', 'brains', 'Lois', 'having', 'superpowers', 'happened', 'quite', 'lot', 'Supes', 'history', 'got', 'cool', 'costume', 'way', 'ton', 'more.Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'Frank', 'Quitely', 'flick', 'hard', 'questions', 'Superman', 'mortality', 'thing', 'possible', 'possible', 'then', 'how', 'would', 'possibly', 'play', 'out', 'Superman', 'death', 'when', 'Man', 'Steel', 'went', 'up', 'Doomsday', 'story', ""n't"", 'giant', 'slugfest', 'slow', 'death', 'caused', 'very', 'thing', 'Superman', 'powers', 'sun', 'coming', 'terms', 'own', 'mortality', 'setting', 'things', 'order', 'final', 'moment', 'arrives.One', 'great', 'things', 'direct-to-DVD', 'super', 'flicks', 'DC', ""'re"", 'stand-alone', 'features', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'being', 'so', 'also', 'carry', 'same', 'art', 'style', 'book', 'case', 'Frank', 'Quitely', 'art', 'animated', 'admit', 'took', 'while', 'art', 'grow', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'simple', 'clean', 'yet', 'being', 'way', 'able', 'create', 'pretty', 'realistic-looking', 'superheroes', 'Seeing', 'animated', 'do', 'flick', 'Superman', 'al', 'life', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'very', 'happy.Out', 'Superman', 'adaptations', 'done', 'thus', 'far', 'All-Star', 'Superman', 'one', 'greats', 'high', 'props', 'being', 'awesome', 'animated', 'flick', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'great', 'story', 'most', 'importantly', 'having', 'greatest', 'hero', 'one', 'who', 'definitely', 'all-star', 'Superman.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

On a positive note, after viewingDcu All-Star Superman (Two-Disc Special Edition), I'm looking forward to reading the series...but unfortunately, without having read them first, I found the video confusing, stilted, and surprisingly uninvolving, a disappointment after several terrific previous video entries.The Bonus Feature, 'Superman Now', on Disc Two, is a must, to understand what Morrison (in a wonderful, if nearly incomprehensible brogue) was intending; the concept of using classic myths of solar-influenced Gods (such as Apollo and Helios) as an inspiration, and returning to the Man of Steel his nearly God-like powers of the 1950s-1960s (reversing the 1980s make-over, and attempt to 'humanize' him), is intriguing, if more than a bit retro, for a 'new' look. The idea does allow two elements I really enjoyed; Lex Luthor, complaining that, while HE gets older, Superman DOESN'T (an idea straight out of Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" that I always liked), and the concept that Supes could 'overchage' on solar radiation, increasing his powers dramatically, but inevitably resulting in an overdose that would kill him. Things, unfortunately, get pretty mixed-up, beyond this...Supes tells Lois they could never have children, as their DNA is too different...but he possesses a 'future telescope', allowing him to chat with his descendents(?)...um, who was the female ancestor? Wonder Woman? Lex has an offspring (Nasthalthia)? And he LIKES Clark Kent, sort of? Fellow Kryptonians Lilo-El and Bar-El appear and disappear abruptly, as do super-powered(?) Samson and Atlas; the whole Krull subplot; events jumble up, and the time-frame gets muddied; a way to recreate Superman through his DNA is offered by Lex, but now it WILL take Lois (or another human woman's) DNA, to complete to task...Huh??? And Lois waits, expecting Supes to launch out of the Sun, cured...HUH???I accept that the 12 graphic novels probably puts all this into perspective, but the video can't, in just 74 minutes.I was disappointed by James Denton's vocal interpretation of Clark/Supes, also. Perhaps he was aiming for Godlike and aloof, but it seemed one-note, and flat, which was a shame, as Christina Hendricks (Lois), Anthony LaPaglia (Lex), Ed Asner (Perry White) and Finola Hughes and Arnold Vosloo (Lilo-El and Bar-El), were all superb.I do admit, however, the line artwork for each character was exceptional, as were the backgrounds and animation, some of the best work, ever.All-in-all, a surprisingly uninvolving entry...c'mon, DC, you can do better than this!",3,"Intriguing Concept, but Flat, Uneven Superman Reboot...",1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,2789,"['When', 'Scottish', 'writer', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'was', 'invited', 'reboot', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'making', 'more', 'relevant', '21st', 'century', 'vision', 'became', 'foundation', '12-issue', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'collection', 'All-Star', 'Superman', 'positive', 'note', 'viewingDcu', 'All-Star', 'Superman', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'reading', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'having', 'read', 'first', 'found', 'video', 'confusing', 'stilted', 'surprisingly', 'uninvolving', 'disappointment', 'several', 'terrific', 'previous', 'video', 'entries.The', 'Bonus', 'Feature', 'Now', 'Disc', 'Two', 'must', 'understand', 'what', 'Morrison', 'wonderful', 'nearly', 'incomprehensible', 'brogue', 'was', 'intending', 'concept', 'using', 'classic', 'myths', 'solar-influenced', 'Gods', 'such', 'Apollo', 'Helios', 'inspiration', 'returning', 'Man', 'Steel', 'nearly', 'God-like', 'powers', '1950s-1960s', 'reversing', '1980s', 'make-over', 'attempt', ""'humanize"", 'intriguing', 'more', 'bit', 'retro', ""'new"", 'look', 'idea', 'allow', 'two', 'elements', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'complaining', 'HE', 'older', 'Superman', ""N'T"", 'idea', 'straight', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'always', 'liked', 'concept', 'Supes', 'could', ""'overchage"", 'solar', 'radiation', 'increasing', 'powers', 'dramatically', 'inevitably', 'resulting', 'overdose', 'would', 'kill', 'Things', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'pretty', 'mixed-up', 'Supes', 'Lois', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'children', 'DNA', 'too', 'different', ""'future"", 'telescope', 'allowing', 'chat', 'descendents', 'um', 'who', 'was', 'female', 'ancestor', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Lex', 'offspring', 'Nasthalthia', 'LIKES', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'sort', 'Fellow', 'Kryptonians', 'Lilo-El', 'Bar-El', 'appear', 'disappear', 'abruptly', 'do', 'super-powered', 'Samson', 'Atlas', 'whole', 'Krull', 'subplot', 'events', 'jumble', 'up', 'time-frame', 'muddied', 'way', 'recreate', 'Superman', 'DNA', 'offered', 'Lex', 'now', 'WILL', 'take', 'Lois', 'human', 'woman', 'DNA', 'complete', 'task', 'Huh', 'Lois', 'waits', 'expecting', 'Supes', 'launch', 'Sun', 'cured', 'HUH', 'accept', '12', 'graphic', 'novels', 'probably', 'perspective', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', '74', 'minutes.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'James', 'Denton', 'vocal', 'interpretation', 'Clark/Supes', 'also', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'aiming', 'Godlike', 'aloof', 'seemed', 'one-note', 'flat', 'was', 'shame', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Lois', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Lex', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Perry', 'White', 'Finola', 'Hughes', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Lilo-El', 'Bar-El', 'were', 'superb.I', 'do', 'admit', 'however', 'line', 'artwork', 'character', 'was', 'exceptional', 'were', 'backgrounds', 'animation', 'best', 'work', 'ever.All-in-all', 'surprisingly', 'uninvolving', 'entry', ""c'mon"", 'DC', 'can', 'do', 'better']",N/A

The story is weak and it seems to be written by someone who does not know the Superman character, or just started reading him after DC started competing with Marvel for more ""in depth and personal"" views of their characters.  Please note, this applies to the comic as much as the feature.  As someone pointed out, Superman is not everyone's favorite because he is always the boy scout, always comes out on top and even in death, you know he will overcome anything.  So, for this to end as it did, it shows that even the story teller is trying to make his mark more than he is carrying on the tradition of Superman.  But let's not stop there...the flaws with this film go beyond the bad subject story.  The story itself is told very poorly.  I have stated my biggest complaint, but there is also too much going on in this piece to have a cohesive timeline.  I get that they want to include as much as possible from the All Star series, but at least those books made sense (as much as comics make sense).  And they made sense because there was some sort of order and reason behind what occured.  Not here.  Kryptonian Astronauts only as a 5 minute aside?  The Parasite chases Clark Kent and Luthor and Lex is too obtuse to figure that the being of immense power the Parasite is pursuing is not him?  Come on now.  Once again, a bad story being poorly retold by someone who does not know the characters and is more interested in making his own mark, and does so at the expense of the story, the icons about which he writes and the viewers.  The only reasons it gets more than one star is because I am a fan of Superman and I cannot ""hate"" anything with him in it.",2,"I normally love the DC Animated products, but...",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,1774,"['will', 'admit', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Animated', 'features', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'product', 'story', 'weak', 'be', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'Superman', 'character', 'just', 'started', 'reading', 'DC', 'started', 'competing', 'Marvel', 'more', 'depth', 'personal', 'views', 'characters', 'Please', 'note', 'comic', 'as', 'much', 'feature', 'someone', 'pointed', 'out', 'Superman', 'not', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'always', 'boy', 'scout', 'always', 'out', 'top', 'even', 'death', 'know', 'will', 'overcome', 'anything', 'So', 'end', 'did', 'even', 'story', 'teller', 'trying', 'make', 'mark', 'more', 'carrying', 'tradition', 'Superman', 'let', 'not', 'stop', 'flaws', 'film', 'go', 'bad', 'subject', 'story', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'poorly', 'have', 'stated', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'piece', 'have', 'cohesive', 'timeline', 'get', 'want', 'include', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'All', 'Star', 'series', 'least', 'books', 'made', 'sense', 'as', 'much', 'comics', 'make', 'sense', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'sort', 'order', 'reason', 'what', 'occured', 'Not', 'here', 'Kryptonian', 'Astronauts', 'only', '5', 'minute', 'aside', 'Parasite', 'chases', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Luthor', 'Lex', 'too', 'obtuse', 'figure', 'being', 'immense', 'power', 'Parasite', 'pursuing', 'not', 'Come', 'now', 'Once', 'again', 'bad', 'story', 'being', 'poorly', 'retold', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'characters', 'more', 'interested', 'making', 'own', 'mark', 'so', 'expense', 'story', 'icons', 'viewers', 'only', 'reasons', 'more', 'one', 'star', 'am', 'fan', 'Superman', 'can', 'not', 'hate', 'anything']",N/A

And surprisingly, it was very good though I still consider New Frontier and Under the Red Hood best of the bunch.The animation was very good, though I'm used to how Parasite looked from the animated series rather than how he appears here. The story feels very episodic, almost reminding me of Gotham Knight but that movie's story was all over the place, while still maintaining continuity. But I feel they could've dropped the bit with the other Kryptonians. They add nothing to the story except a brief obstacle to overcome after Superman left to find a new home for the city of Kandor. Though I'm sure the comic handles this a lot better than what the movie could (I've never read it), stringing together separate issues of a storyline vs. one that had a straight-forward one (Under the Red Hood or Doomsday) could prove difficult if not handled correctly (which this was). It just felt like the movie ended one bit (like with Samson and Atlas) and picked up on the next part (which was Clark visiting Luthor in prison I think).The voice casting was fantastic! Though to be honest, I've never heard of James Denton (Clark Kent/Sueprman), Christina Hendricks (Lois Lane) or Anthony (I hope I spelled that right) Lapalgia (Lex Luthor) but all were very good, second only to the actors from the animated series, and were much better picks, I think, than the actors who voiced them in Doomsday.I feel that the people behind these films did a far better job here than the last film but not everything can be A+ material.",4,Better Than Superman Returns,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,1795,"['stated', 'review', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'was', 'seriously', 'considering', 'not', 'continuing', 'DCU', 'films', 'feeling', 'were', 'losing', 'steam', 'putting', 'out', 'three', 'movies', 'year', 'lot', 'work', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'just', 'last', 'month', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'consider', 'New', 'Frontier', 'Red', 'Hood', 'best', 'bunch.The', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'used', 'how', 'Parasite', 'looked', 'animated', 'series', 'rather', 'how', 'here', 'story', 'feels', 'very', 'episodic', 'almost', 'reminding', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'place', 'still', 'maintaining', 'continuity', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'dropped', 'bit', 'other', 'Kryptonians', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'brief', 'obstacle', 'overcome', 'Superman', 'left', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'city', 'Kandor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'comic', 'lot', 'better', 'what', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'stringing', 'together', 'separate', 'issues', 'storyline', 'vs.', 'one', 'had', 'straight-forward', 'one', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Doomsday', 'could', 'prove', 'difficult', 'not', 'handled', 'correctly', 'was', 'just', 'felt', 'movie', 'ended', 'one', 'bit', 'Samson', 'Atlas', 'picked', 'up', 'next', 'part', 'was', 'Clark', 'visiting', 'Luthor', 'prison', 'think', '.The', 'voice', 'casting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'James', 'Denton', 'Clark', 'Kent/Sueprman', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Anthony', 'hope', 'spelled', 'right', 'Lapalgia', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'only', 'actors', 'animated', 'series', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'picks', 'think', 'actors', 'who', 'voiced', 'Doomsday.I', 'feel', 'people', 'films', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'here', 'last', 'film', 'not', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'A+', 'material']",N/A

Make no mistake this is a very good adaptation of Grant Morrison's and Frank Quietly series so If you are wondering whether you will like it or not, at least browse the comics.  If you like the comics chances are you are going to enjoy the movie, if not, please don't even watch the movie because as movie goes... Its a good comic book adaptation.The comic was written by Grant Morrison, who happens to be famous for his complex out of the box story telling, so the comic is complex and pulls the superman lore to that complexity. The comic is not your typical Superman story, so the movie IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL SUPERMAN MOVIE.Both the movie and the comic occur outside normal comic book continuity and revolve around the premise of Superman dying. Specifically, they try to answer the question: What would the Man of Steel do if he knew that he was dying from some weird decease?As any of us would do if dying from a conical decease, Superman says his goodbyes and make preparations for the last trip, so the movie will be ""episodic"" as the series was (in the series we saw Superman taking care of a different issue with each episode or couple of episodes of the series).That does not help for the flow or the rhythm of the movie, but doesn't make it a bad one.Animation is really quite good on its own style (which tries to emulate Frank Quietly's art in the comics) but don't be expecting anime like quality or drawings. Again, browse the comics to see if you like Mr. Quietly's style because although I love it, many people hate it...

And, honestly, I find the source material extremely overrated, to the point where I doubted I could write an unbiased review. But, I am absolutely floored with the end result, it's actually good!That said, the film has a few missteps.  James Denton plays a honest sounding Superman and that's good. Lois lane, played by Christina Hendrix, is so light and easy going that it's almost unbelievable. Then, Anthony LaPaglia as Lex Luthor has too deep a voice. Those are just my opinions on how they sound, performance wise, they're flawless. I don't like the writing in the source material, but when the cast speaks it, I find it genuine.Also, part of my gripes with the voices are tied into the animation. At the beginning of the movie, Luthor says he's getting old, but you can't see it in anybody's face. Clearly, Superman has been around for 10-20 years, but everyone still looks like they're in their mid-30s. Lois isn't that shocked when things happen around her, because it's implied that it happens all the time, but she doesn't look like she's been doing it for years.On the positive side, I know I'm not the only one who thinks Frank Quietly makes people look puffy and fat. That's all been fixed in the animation. One-third of the Graphic Novel is cut out (Doomsday, Time Travel, the Bizarros), and what they kept boiled down to it's essentials. Unfortunately, if you cut it down to the story of Superman, Lois, and Luthor, it wasn't enough for the film, so they kept the Kryptonian Astronauts.  They leave almost as quickly as they show up, but at least they try to tie into the theme of the story.From looking at other critical reviews, I thought I was going to hate this movie. I wasn't just ""pleasantly surprised,"" this movie left me energized. It made me feel good. By itself, All Star Superman is a solid 4, but what makes it perfect are the extras.Commentary with Grant Morrison and Bruce Timm.

That could've been an entire movie.Two Kryptonian Astronauts who survived the destruction of Krypton find Earth and try transforming it into a new Krypton while Superman's been in deep space trying to free the shrunken Kryptonian city of Kandor.

Is it possible for Superman to have children?  Would Lex Luthor ever use his intellect for the good of humanity?  Who would write Superman's obituary for the Daily Planet?  Would the meek and mild reporter named Clark Kent perform a heroic act?All Star Superman answers those questions and many more.  It is a love story.  It's a hero story with some nasty villains besides Alexander Joseph Luthor.The main story takes place on Lois Lane's birthday where Superman whisks her off to the Fortress of Solitude.  There she discovers more about Superman and Clark Kent.The Fortress is a museum, workshop, laboratory and most of all a homage to an ancient planet known as Krypton.  This hermitage is where Superman pursues his various interests and vocations.  Except for his robot helpers it is a lonely, isolated place.Perhaps this is the core of the film--Superman's unique loneliness and isolation.  Growing up in Smallville he had his earth parents and special friends like Lana and Pete.  In Metropolis he had Jimmy and Lois, but all in all Superman's existence was a lonely plight of a strange visitor from another world untouched by humanity's mortality.The various battles, the inspiring music and the sad overtones of a demi-god facing his end are wrapped into a neat package.  The poignant conversation between Superman and Lois about their genetic incompatibility is touching.The conversation between Clark and Lex as they fight for survival in a prison riot reveals how Lex feels about Clark and how Clark feels about Lex.

Instead of revolving around Superman vs. some villain, this one explores the intimate details of Superman's humanity as he ties loose ends in anticipation of his death.  The concept is great, but unfortunately, the execution was poor.  If I were to read the script, it would seem amazing, as it delves into several inner aspects of Superman's truly unique perspective of the world that have never been showcased before.  And then I might think it would be difficult to adapt into an animation.  Sure enough, the directing was found wanting.  It had all the elements of a good flick, but it just lacked all the potential magic that an animation has over a bare script.  Even the voice actors somehow seemed to lack life in their lines.

1397983,A26O0T192IBKY1,B004EE2ZY2,J. Alford,"[1, 3]","Superman has been the focus of several movies, both animated and live-action. Although, almost none of them since Superman 2 has been able to capture the pure joy and out-of-this-world splendor of the comic books. Granted, Superman Returns was a great return to the idea of the original 70s-80s films, but still steered pretty clear of some of the main comic book ideals. However, as part of the DC Universe series of animated movies, it was decided to take one of the best maxi-series ever done of the Man of Steel and turn it into a great made-for-video production. All-Star Superman was originally one of two titles that DC Comics was doing as their answer to Marvel's line of Ultimate series that did a fresh modern day retake of existing characters without having to be familiar with decades with of backstory. The other comic done for this was All-Star Batman And Robin by Frank Miller & Jim Lee, but has been universally panned as being one of the worst comics about the Caped Crusaders ever made(and is still incomplete!), while the Superman one though took place seperately from that storyline in its own universe and dealt with an updated version of the super-science Supes from the 50s. Grant Morrison of X-Men and JLA fame, and drawn by Frank Quietly who is currently doing Batman And Robin(not the All-Star one).The movie starts out with billionaire scientist Dr. Quinton(an original character from the book)who is in jeopardy as his spaceship is in danger of crashing into the sun after Lex Luthor has rigged one of his clone workers into sabotaging their star trek. Superman shows up and saves the ship, but his exposure to the sun's solar radiation has increased his strength and given him some new superpowers. The down side is that this is far beyond Superman's capability to process solar energy from Earth's yellow sun, which is what also gives him his powers. Realizing that he only has a short amount of time before this ""solar cancer"" eats away at him, he decides to take care of alot of things he's always meant to do. He reveals his secret identity to Lois Lane, and gives her a special 24-hour formula that gives her Kryptonian powers. While stopping an invasion from subterranean dinosaur man, they run across the original time-travelling heroes, Atlas and Samson, who Superman fends them off from trying to pick up Lois. Then, Clark Kent goes to interview Luthor in jail on death row, but the Parasite begins to mutate after being exposed to Superman's new power boost, and causes a prision riot. Clark learns that Luthor planned Superman's solar infection, so he resolve another of his longstanding issues by taking the shrunken city of Kandor to another planet far out in space. Superman returns two months later to discover that Earth has been visited by a couple from Krypton. They tried to influence the Earthlings at first and plan on taking over, but unfortunately succumb to Kryptonite poisoning, so Superman sends them to the Phantom Zone where they won't be affected by Kryptonite. Superman then begins writing his final journal, but the Earth is invaded by the evil artificial sun Solaris. It turns Earth's sun blue, and Superman and his army of robots take him down. While this is happening, Luthor makes his own version of Lois' super-formula, and breaks out of prision. Superman uses a special gravity gun to speed up Lex's 24 hours. Just as Superman's body is about to give into the solar energy he's absorbed, he heads out into the sun to repair the damage that Solaris has caused. In the wake of Superman's apparent death, Luthor give Dr. Quinton the means to create a Superman clone that Lois would give birth to.All-Star Superman is definatley so far the best adaptation of a comic story amoung the DC Universe movies. There were a few things from the original comic left out, like the Smallville and Bizarro chapters, but it was pretty spot-on with the rest of it, even though Luthor's redemption at the end was slightly tagged on. The late Dwayne McDuffie wrote the screenplay for this, and it was produced Bruce Timm. James Denton from Desperate Houswives plays a very sympathetic Superman, and Anthony LaPaglia brings the megalomania back to Luthor in a slick way. The animation is really top notch, and up there with theatrical quality. For only even the passing Super-fan, this splendid sci-fi spectacular is an epic look into the life of a hero and his impact on the world he leaves behind.",5,Superman's Bucket List,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,4444,"['Superman', 'been', 'focus', 'several', 'movies', 'animated', 'live-action', 'almost', 'none', 'Superman', '2', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'pure', 'joy', 'out-of-this-world', 'splendor', 'comic', 'books', 'Granted', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'great', 'return', 'idea', 'original', '70s-80s', 'films', 'still', 'steered', 'pretty', 'clear', 'main', 'comic', 'book', 'ideals', 'However', 'part', 'DC', 'Universe', 'series', 'animated', 'movies', 'was', 'decided', 'take', 'one', 'best', 'maxi-series', 'ever', 'done', 'Man', 'Steel', 'turn', 'great', 'made-for-video', 'production', 'All-Star', 'Superman', 'was', 'originally', 'one', 'two', 'titles', 'DC', 'Comics', 'was', 'doing', 'answer', 'Marvel', 'line', 'Ultimate', 'series', 'did', 'fresh', 'modern', 'day', 'retake', 'existing', 'characters', 'having', 'be', 'familiar', 'decades', 'backstory', 'other', 'comic', 'done', 'was', 'All-Star', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'been', 'universally', 'panned', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'comics', 'Caped', 'Crusaders', 'ever', 'made', 'still', 'incomplete', 'Superman', 'one', 'took', 'place', 'seperately', 'storyline', 'own', 'universe', 'dealt', 'updated', 'version', 'super-science', 'Supes', '50s', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'X-Men', 'JLA', 'fame', 'drawn', 'Frank', 'Quietly', 'who', 'currently', 'doing', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'not', 'All-Star', 'one', 'movie', 'out', 'billionaire', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Quinton', 'original', 'character', 'book', 'who', 'jeopardy', 'spaceship', 'danger', 'crashing', 'sun', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'rigged', 'one', 'clone', 'workers', 'sabotaging', 'star', 'trek', 'Superman', 'up', 'ship', 'exposure', 'sun', 'solar', 'radiation', 'increased', 'strength', 'given', 'new', 'superpowers', 'down', 'side', 'far', 'Superman', 'capability', 'process', 'solar', 'energy', 'Earth', 'yellow', 'sun', 'what', 'also', 'powers', 'Realizing', 'only', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'solar', 'cancer', 'away', 'take', 'care', 'alot', 'things', 'always', 'meant', 'do', 'secret', 'identity', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'special', '24-hour', 'formula', 'Kryptonian', 'powers', 'stopping', 'invasion', 'subterranean', 'dinosaur', 'man', 'run', 'original', 'time-travelling', 'heroes', 'Atlas', 'Samson', 'who', 'Superman', 'off', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'Lois', 'Then', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'interview', 'Luthor', 'jail', 'death', 'row', 'Parasite', 'mutate', 'being', 'exposed', 'Superman', 'new', 'power', 'boost', 'prision', 'riot', 'Clark', 'Luthor', 'planned', 'Superman', 'solar', 'infection', 'longstanding', 'issues', 'taking', 'shrunken', 'city', 'Kandor', 'planet', 'far', 'out', 'space', 'Superman', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'discover', 'Earth', 'been', 'visited', 'couple', 'Krypton', 'tried', 'influence', 'Earthlings', 'first', 'plan', 'taking', 'over', 'unfortunately', 'succumb', 'Kryptonite', 'poisoning', 'Superman', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'affected', 'Kryptonite', 'Superman', 'then', 'writing', 'final', 'journal', 'Earth', 'invaded', 'evil', 'artificial', 'sun', 'Solaris', 'Earth', 'sun', 'blue', 'Superman', 'army', 'robots', 'take', 'down', 'happening', 'Luthor', 'own', 'version', 'Lois', 'super-formula', 'prision', 'Superman', 'special', 'gravity', 'gun', 'speed', 'up', 'Lex', '24', 'hours', 'Just', 'Superman', 'body', 'give', 'solar', 'energy', 'absorbed', 'out', 'sun', 'repair', 'damage', 'Solaris', 'caused', 'wake', 'Superman', 'apparent', 'death', 'Luthor', 'give', 'Dr.', 'Quinton', 'means', 'create', 'Superman', 'clone', 'Lois', 'would', 'give', 'birth', 'to.All-Star', 'Superman', 'definatley', 'so', 'far', 'best', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'story', 'DC', 'Universe', 'movies', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'original', 'comic', 'left', 'out', 'Smallville', 'Bizarro', 'chapters', 'was', 'pretty', 'spot-on', 'rest', 'even', 'Luthor', 'redemption', 'end', 'was', 'slightly', 'tagged', 'late', 'Dwayne', 'McDuffie', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'was', 'produced', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'James', 'Denton', 'Desperate', 'Houswives', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Superman', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'megalomania', 'back', 'Luthor', 'slick', 'way', 'animation', 'really', 'top', 'notch', 'up', 'there', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'only', 'even', 'passing', 'Super-fan', 'splendid', 'sci-fi', 'spectacular', 'epic', 'look', 'life', 'hero', 'impact', 'world']",N/A

Granted its not 5 stars but it is a solid and engaging movie about Superman based strongly on the All Star Superman Graphic Novel. I read the novel and enjoyed it and liked the track it took and the weapon used to ""kill"" Superman. A nice twist on that one. I felt this movie was engaging interesting and developed a good depth of character development with Superman and other characters involved. To some it maybe be too slow and not as action packed but for me this essense made it more of a story than an action comic.

He has weeks to live as he must fulfill everything he's always dreamed of including revealing his secret identity to Lois (Christina Hendricks) and must do everything he can to live his life through the weeks of dying for he also must do battle against his old foes besides Lex like Parasite (Michel Gough, Atlas (Steve Blum) and even Samson (John Dimaggio).Nicely done adaptation of Grant Morrison's graphic novel is an emotional and exciting Superman animated adventure and one of the better DC animated movies.

For one thing, Superman's powers are utilized properly here as the movie makes excellent use of his less frequently shown/mentioned abilities like freeze breath, telescopic sight, and the personal ""field"" extension that keeps his suit from tearing apart so easily.Of note is the adult atmosphere being portrayed here.  When Superman is weak, he is weak... period (no lifting Kryptonite islands here out of shear will power).  If it take 3 weeks to reach an alien planet, he's not going to make it in 2 1/2, just because he was really confident.  In one scene, a woman makes a sexual comment about a window cleaner and people clearly die on screen.  Bad, terrible things happen to enemies that wouldn't normally happen in a DC cartoon.  There's even an instance of Luthor insulting a priest for his religious beliefs.  Superman's death is handled well; actually, it's handled so well that I think it's the way Superman (an immensely powerful, solar-powered alien being) should actually die.  And what they did with the Parasite is just greatness.Some of the acting is a little hammy, (for example, when the doctor gives Superman his diagnosis, or when Lois learns the truth), which I think is a product of time-constraints.  And there's an incident with the Phantom Zone being portrayed as some sort of Heaven just for an emotional grab that I totally didn't accept, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.For all the good things I can say about this movie, some will not enjoy it, simply because it's more about characters instead of mindless action.

It wasn't and it didn't.By incorporating four different mini-stories using a weak thread to tie them together, Liu essentially derailed the project. Instead of a steady, strong build-up to an unspeakable climax - we're left grateful that the blended mishmash was finally over.Example:What's the point of the entire Atlas and Samson sub-plot? Watching something that has NOTHING to do with what Superman is dealing with - to prove what? That he's stronger than the two egocentric arrogant jackwads? And if this was a display for Lois Lane that she ""picked"" the right guy - seriously - that's a huge insult to her character. That she needs convincing at this point about her love suggests she's a weak silly skank willing to take off with any super strong knucklehead that passed her way. Really?And hey, guess what, another bunch of Kyptonians survived the death of their planet, made their way to Earth and tried to conquer it. Inane retread anyone?Shockingly, we aren't able to feel connected to anything, despite our collective investment in the characters we know so well.

Here's a hint: it involves Superman as a superstar and Superman as a super star, literally. In a carefully orchestrated Lex Luthor plot, Superman is manipulated into being overexposed to the sun's rays with a special kind of cancer unique to his physiology.  Superman is dying, and this animated film is an opportunity to look at Superman/Clark Kent's legacy.With nothing to lose, Superman starts working on wrapping up loose ends.  He tells Lois whom he really is, a truth she doesn't believe for a second.  Being that this film is firmly rooted in the history of the Superman comics, it's easy to see why.  Clark Kent has been ""outed"" multiple times with dozens of excuses as to why he's not really Superman, such that even when Superman plainly states his secret identity it's no longer believable.  Nor is it really relevant in the big scheme of things.What ""All-Star Superman"" does well is emphasize that Superman isn't an alien, but a god among men.  What does a god do in his spare time?  Collect dangerous but endangered alien creatures, synthesize super-power formulas, and rebuild the Titanic.  This is Superman as a comprehensive being who is both endlessly compassionate and terrifyingly powerful.  It's hard to conceive of Superman without his Clark Kent personality to ground him -- a fact brought into stark contrast by two Kryptonians who revel in their newfound power on Earth and carelessly abuse it.There are other plots, led primarily by Luthor as an architect of destruction on death row that sees Superman's existence as an affront to humanity's destiny.  But it's not until Luthor truly gets a chance to walk in Superman's shoes that he sees the world as the Kryptonian sees it -- and realizes how much he has wasted his life in trying to thwart someone who has only tried to help.Although ""All-Star Superman"" doesn't have the luxury of truly digging into every plot point (there are two time travel superbeings who show up that feel out of sync with the rest of the film's tone) it culminates in a critical question: When you can witness the suffering of even the smallest blade of grass, wouldn't you do everything in your power to ease it?Luthor -- and by extension, all of mankind -- realizes only too late how pitifully short we fall of our noblest goals thanks, in part, due to the limited perceptions of our humanity.

A couple weeks ago I almost bought this movie to add to my collection. Boy am I glad I didn't. While the animation was fine, the voice acting was some of the worst I can remember. The actors who played Lois and Superman had very generic voices. Not only were they generic sounding, but also emotionless, which gave much of the dialogue an unintentionally creepy feel. James Denton particularly sounded like he was imitating HAL 9000 for 2001 a Space Odyssey.Aside from the voice acting, All Star Superman had a lot more wrong with it With so many competing plots it fealt like I was watching a medly of scenes from a dozen unrelated episodes of a Superman cartoon. And some of what was on screen just seemed silly. In one scene Superman is using old fashioned blacksmith tools to work on a miniature sun. Then there's Lex Luthor who, despite being on death row, gets to build devices in a special prison lab, work out in an olympic style gym, enjoy visitors, and generally wander around while escorted by 4 terrified armed guards. Seriously...? Even in the DC univere, event with Eric Holder as attorney general, would anyone really allow a super-villian on death row to wander around prisons and build scientific devices that can be used as weapons?Then there's the time travelling strong men who want to challange Superman to a contest of strength (winner gets to keep Lois Lane). And finally there are reptile men who live in the Earth's core, that look so silly I expected Space Ghost to make a cameo appearence.

Like with Superman Doomsday this movie had much potential. However, like Superman Doomsday, I do not think the movie really lived up to that potential. When I first watched the movie I did not care for it much at all. However, viewing it again, I liked more the second time, though I still think it is a bit of a lackluster film. I liked this film more than Superman Doomsday mainly because unlike Doomsday, this film did not ruin a story that I am a big fan of. I am not too familiar with the All-Star Superman comic. I only know what I have heard about it online.This movie has many of the same issues that Superman Doomsday had. The pacing is too fast and things were changed or cut from original comic from what I've heard. All-Star Superman story, like the Death of Superman, is much too long to fit into an hour and fifteen minute movie. Plus, I found the film to be very boring during the middle half. The beginning and end of the film were exciting, but the middle portion nearly put me to sleep, especially when I first saw the movie.I did not care much for the voices either. James Denton as Superman/Clark Kent is okay but nothing special. The same can be said for Christina Hendricks (Lois Lane), Anthony LaPlagia (Lex Luthor), and the rest of the cast.The art of the movie took some getting used to, but after-a-while I grew accustomed to it. The animation is also very smooth. The art and animation are easily the best parts about the film. The action was also fairly entertaining. The action is not as explosive as Superman Doomsday's, but it is above average.Overall this film, like Doomsday, is a film that does not live up to its potential.

All-Star Superman finds the Man of Steel (voiced by James Denton) facing his own mortality as his arch nemesis Lex Luthor (voiced by Anthony LaPaglia) has finally managed to find a way to kill Superman.  With his death imminent, Superman embarks on a journey that begins with declaring his love for Lois Lane (voiced by Christina Hendricks) and ending with a last confrontation with his greatest foe.  What shocks me the most about All-Star Superman is how faithful it winds up being to Morrison's comic.  Though there is a good deal lost in translation here (they are squeezing a twelve issue series into one 75-minute feature after all), this adaptation remains a great achievement regardless.

I despise him for very geeky, and humanistic reasons.  I believe in the train of thought that suggests that Superman is a God among men, a would be tyrant that only finds acceptance because of his shear strength and powers and the fact that he is a 'small town boy made good'...humans love stuff like that. I believe that Superman not only despises human beings..but thinks we are weak, bumbling, socially awkward, and a bit naive.  All of this is evident by the way he chooses to 'blend' in with the human race...by pretending to be  weak, bumbling, socially awkward, and a bit naive...that is how he sees humans..it's what he thinks of you.  I hate SUPERMAN!  (granted...this argument is similar to Lex Luthor's view of him..but...does that mean it's incorrect?)Anyway...to the review of the DVD.If you have read any of my reviews, then you know that I love the direct to DVD animated movies that have been coming out from DC and MARVEL in the last five or so years and this offering is another stellar addition to my DVD collection.The story is excellently translated from the comic, and brilliantly animated.  I know one of the reviewers was balking on the voice talent..but they all did a really good job in my opinion.  The characters where tweaked a little to bring them up to date..or modernize them...and while at first I did not know what to think about this...it works and was a good idea for those of us who aren't the biggest Superman fan.  The story is another of those where Lex Luthor tries to defeat Superman stories.  We have all seen Lex try this countless times before...and it does sound a little cliche...but it is surprisingly fresh, made so by the clever writing and character development.  What I really like most about this DVD is that the characters really shine.  Lex IS an evil genius bent on world domination and the destruction of Superman.  Superman is a god like alien who is obviously ego centric and arrogant but pretends not to be.  The only down side I can mention for this DVD is that in my opinion they spent too much time on the romantic teasing between Lois and Supermen...but the story overall is a good one and works.I won't give the whole story away..as the devil is in the details and this one is chock full of minute little instances of brilliance that the viewer will enjoy discovering on their own.There is also a very cool sneak peak at the upcoming ""Green Lantern Emerald Knights""...Henry Rollins plays Killowog...I can't wait.Anyway...If you are a lover or a hater of the Man of Steel...this DVD will deliver a great story for the guy who can probably be called the ""FIRST SUPERHERO""..go out and buy it..if not for you then for your children...or that special comic geek in your life.",4,All star Superman,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2865,"['am', 'going', 'preface', 'review', 'fact', 'love', 'comics', 'superhero', 'stuff', 'loathe', 'DC', 'Big', 'Blue', 'Boyscout..SUPERMAN', 'despise', 'very', 'geeky', 'humanistic', 'reasons', 'believe', 'train', 'thought', 'Superman', 'God', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'tyrant', 'only', 'acceptance', 'shear', 'strength', 'powers', 'fact', ""'small"", 'town', 'boy', 'made', 'good', 'humans', 'love', 'stuff', 'believe', 'Superman', 'not', 'only', 'human', 'beings..but', 'are', 'weak', 'bumbling', 'socially', 'awkward', 'bit', 'naive', 'evident', 'way', ""'blend"", 'human', 'race', 'pretending', 'be', 'weak', 'bumbling', 'socially', 'awkward', 'bit', 'naive', 'how', 'humans..it', 'what', 'hate', 'SUPERMAN', 'granted', 'argument', 'similar', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'view', 'him..but', 'mean', 'incorrect', 'Anyway', 'review', 'DVD.If', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'then', 'know', 'love', 'direct', 'DVD', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'out', 'DC', 'MARVEL', 'last', 'five', 'so', 'years', 'offering', 'stellar', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection.The', 'story', 'excellently', 'translated', 'comic', 'brilliantly', 'animated', 'know', 'one', 'reviewers', 'was', 'balking', 'voice', 'talent..but', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'opinion', 'characters', 'where', 'tweaked', 'little', 'bring', 'up', 'date..or', 'modernize', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'Superman', 'fan', 'story', 'where', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'defeat', 'Superman', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'Lex', 'try', 'countless', 'times', 'sound', 'little', 'cliche', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'made', 'so', 'clever', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'What', 'really', 'most', 'DVD', 'characters', 'really', 'shine', 'Lex', 'evil', 'genius', 'bent', 'world', 'domination', 'destruction', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'god', 'alien', 'who', 'obviously', 'ego', 'centric', 'arrogant', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'can', 'mention', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'romantic', 'teasing', 'Lois', 'Supermen', 'story', 'overall', 'good', 'one', 'works.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'whole', 'story', 'devil', 'details', 'one', 'chock', 'full', 'minute', 'little', 'instances', 'brilliance', 'viewer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'own.There', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'sneak', 'peak', 'upcoming', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Emerald', 'Knights', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'Killowog', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait.Anyway', 'are', 'lover', 'hater', 'Man', 'Steel', 'DVD', 'will', 'deliver', 'great', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'called', 'FIRST', 'SUPERHERO', 'out', 'buy', 'it..if', 'not', 'then', 'children', 'special', 'comic', 'geek', 'life']",N/A
1398015,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B004EE2ZY2,NF,"[3, 4]","This is an adaptation of a story by Grant Morrison. The story begins with a scientific trip to the sun, a trip that is sabotaged by Lex Luthor, who had previously been released from prison to work for the government on scientific research. Superman saves the mission but the real target of the sabotage was Superman himself. Luthor has engineered events to over-saturate Superman's cells with solar radiation, more than they can handle. In a word: Superman is dying. The remainder of the movie consists of small vignettes dealing with how Superman handles his last days on Earth.Vignette 1: Superman finally reveals himself to Lois as Clark Kent. And, for her birthday, gives her a potion that gives her super-powers for 24 hours.Vignette 2: Samson and Atlas, musclebound clowns, arrive to court Lois since, as time travelers, they know of his impending death. After a series of events, Superman settles things with an arm-wrestling contest.Vignette 3: Clark Kent shows up at Luthor's jail cell for an exclusive interview with the condemned scientist. In the process, we find out more about Lex's antipathy towards Superman: &#34;Doesn't his very existence diminish you? Diminish us all? ... Next to Superman, even Lex Luthor's greatness is overshadowed.&#34; Unfortunately, as they pass by the Parasite's cell, the Parasite manages to absorb some of Superman's power remotely and breaks free.Vignette 4: Superman reveals to Lois that he's dying and takes the bottle city of Kandor to a remote planet, leaving the Earth for a few weeks. When he gets back, he finds that matters have changed and that Earth has new &#34;protectors,&#34; a couple of astronauts from Krypton who were lost in space for decades. They have a decidedly different idea on how to behave, a belief that might makes right, that Earthmen are little more than apes, and that Superman is a deluded, ineffectual dreamer. Their goal is to create a new Krypton and if that means getting rid of everyone on Earth, then so be it. The vignette ends abruptly as the pair find that they are dying. They repent their arrogance as Superman sends them to the Phantom Zone until a cure can be found for them.Vignette 5: Superman visits Luthor in prison but Luthor remains unrepentant. Luthor is subsequently sent to the electric chair but he has a surprise for his captors, as he has imbibed a 24-hour super serum of his own, a serum he stole from Superman's fortress. Luthor has made a bargain with Solaris, a stellar super-computer from the future who eats suns. Solaris has put himself between the sun and the Earth, turning the sun's rays red to de-power Superman. Unfortunately for Solaris, Superman has a baby sun-eater. Between Superman and the sun-eater, Solaris is defeated.Meanwhile, back on earth, Luthor is taking advantage of his super-powers to attack Metropolis. A dying Superman takes him on but is overpowered by Luthor. Superman has one final trick up his sleeve, though, as he speeds up Luthor's clock, so that the 24-hour serum expires in just a couple of hours. Unfortunately for everyone, Solaris had double-crossed Luthor, and has turned the sun blue. Only one person can halt that chain reaction, as Superman, now visibly showing the signs of his affliction, flies off to perform one final (?) heroic deed.I have to confess that I'm not a big fan of the original source material. Luthor's plot was an interesting idea but the various vignettes don't really hang together and some of them just strike me as rather silly. The movie is relatively faithful to the original source material, although a few stories were omitted (a Bizarro story, a Jimmy Olsen story where Superman is exposed to Black Kryptonite and Olsen has to turn himself into Doomsday to stop him, a story where he teams up with future Superman to take on the Chronovore); the only problem it is that they had to compress the stories down to make them fit.The animation is pretty good and so are the voice actors. Nobody really stands out as exceptional but there aren't any weak players here, either. As noted, the story just isn't that good and the ambiguous ending is really unsatisfactory. I really like the DC Universe movies from the Warner Brothers animation team but this is probably their weakest effort and I just can't recommend it.",2,Confused adaptation of a flawed story,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,4290,"['adaptation', 'story', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'story', 'scientific', 'trip', 'sun', 'trip', 'sabotaged', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'work', 'government', 'scientific', 'research', 'Superman', 'mission', 'real', 'target', 'sabotage', 'was', 'Superman', 'Luthor', 'engineered', 'events', 'over-saturate', 'Superman', 'cells', 'solar', 'radiation', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'word', 'Superman', 'dying', 'remainder', 'movie', 'small', 'vignettes', 'dealing', 'how', 'Superman', 'last', 'days', 'Earth.Vignette', '1', 'Superman', 'finally', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'birthday', 'potion', 'super-powers', '24', 'hours.Vignette', '2', 'Samson', 'Atlas', 'musclebound', 'clowns', 'arrive', 'court', 'Lois', 'time', 'travelers', 'know', 'impending', 'death', 'series', 'events', 'Superman', 'things', 'arm-wrestling', 'contest.Vignette', '3', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'up', 'Luthor', 'jail', 'cell', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'condemned', 'scientist', 'process', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Lex', 'antipathy', 'towards', 'Superman', '34', ""n't"", 'very', 'existence', 'diminish', 'Diminish', 'Next', 'Superman', 'even', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'greatness', 'overshadowed.', '34', 'Unfortunately', 'pass', 'Parasite', 'cell', 'Parasite', 'absorb', 'Superman', 'power', 'remotely', 'breaks', 'free.Vignette', '4', 'Superman', 'reveals', 'Lois', 'dying', 'bottle', 'city', 'Kandor', 'remote', 'planet', 'leaving', 'Earth', 'few', 'weeks', 'When', 'back', 'matters', 'have', 'changed', 'Earth', 'new', '34', 'protectors', '34', 'couple', 'astronauts', 'Krypton', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'space', 'decades', 'have', 'decidedly', 'different', 'idea', 'how', 'behave', 'belief', 'might', 'right', 'Earthmen', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'apes', 'Superman', 'deluded', 'ineffectual', 'dreamer', 'goal', 'create', 'new', 'Krypton', 'getting', 'rid', 'everyone', 'Earth', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'vignette', 'abruptly', 'pair', 'find', 'are', 'dying', 'repent', 'arrogance', 'Superman', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'cure', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'them.Vignette', '5', 'Superman', 'visits', 'Luthor', 'prison', 'Luthor', 'unrepentant', 'Luthor', 'subsequently', 'sent', 'electric', 'chair', 'surprise', 'captors', 'imbibed', '24-hour', 'super', 'serum', 'own', 'serum', 'stole', 'Superman', 'fortress', 'Luthor', 'made', 'bargain', 'Solaris', 'stellar', 'super-computer', 'future', 'who', 'suns', 'Solaris', 'put', 'sun', 'Earth', 'turning', 'sun', 'rays', 'red', 'de-power', 'Superman', 'Unfortunately', 'Solaris', 'Superman', 'baby', 'sun-eater', 'Between', 'Superman', 'sun-eater', 'Solaris', 'defeated.Meanwhile', 'back', 'earth', 'Luthor', 'taking', 'advantage', 'super-powers', 'attack', 'Metropolis', 'A', 'dying', 'Superman', 'overpowered', 'Luthor', 'Superman', 'one', 'final', 'trick', 'up', 'sleeve', 'though', 'up', 'Luthor', 'clock', '24-hour', 'serum', 'just', 'couple', 'hours', 'Unfortunately', 'everyone', 'Solaris', 'had', 'double-crossed', 'Luthor', 'turned', 'sun', 'blue', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'halt', 'chain', 'reaction', 'Superman', 'now', 'visibly', 'showing', 'signs', 'affliction', 'perform', 'one', 'final', 'heroic', 'deed.I', 'have', 'confess', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Luthor', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'various', 'vignettes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hang', 'together', 'just', 'strike', 'rather', 'silly', 'movie', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'few', 'stories', 'were', 'omitted', 'Bizarro', 'story', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'story', 'where', 'Superman', 'exposed', 'Black', 'Kryptonite', 'Olsen', 'turn', 'Doomsday', 'stop', 'story', 'where', 'up', 'future', 'Superman', 'take', 'Chronovore', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'compress', 'stories', 'down', 'make', 'fit.The', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'are', 'voice', 'actors', 'Nobody', 'really', 'out', 'exceptional', 'are', ""n't"", 'weak', 'players', 'here', 'either', 'noted', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'really', 'unsatisfactory', 'really', 'DC', 'Universe', 'movies', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'animation', 'team', 'probably', 'weakest', 'effort', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend']",N/A

It's an ""Elseworlds"" story, which is DC speak for ""doesn't fit in with the current continuity of our characters.""  The plot lines up with the original series, with certain deletions.  Issue by issue, it goes like this:1.  Save the sun ship2.  Superman and Lois in the Fortress of Solitude3.  Superman, Atlas, and Samson vs. the Lizard People4.  Superman vs. Jimmy Olsen (deleted)5.  Clark, Lex, and the Parasite6.  The future Supermen (deleted)7.  Bizarro world pt 1 (deleted)8.  Bizarro world pt 2 (deleted)9.  Superman vs. the Kryptonians10.  Kandor and the microverse (deleted)11.  Superman vs. the Tyrant Sun12.  Superman vs. LexAs far as the original comic series goes, one of the following must be true 1) it is the best Superman story ever told, 2) I have amnesia, or 3) I haven't read the best Superman story yet (I still don't have ""Superman: Secret Identity""  or ""Supeman for all Seasons"" yet). Even more than ""Watchmen"", even more than ""Dune"", I feel very strongly that you should not see this movie until after you have read the original series, because I believe it would ruin your appreciation of the original (see the 1 and 2 star reviews).Why is this?  The story was told originally as a comic book, with nearly each issue being both a complete story, yet with themes and subplots running through it.  Each issue is in its way its own little movie.  Converting this directly into a movie doesn't quite work.  When in the movie you jump, for instance, from Superman kissing Lois goodnight to Lex Luthor on trial, you've just jumped from the last page of Issue #3 to the first page of issue #5.Another problem with the movie is the essential unreality of it all.  Back in the ""Silver Age"" (the '50's and '60's) you would get a wacky plot like ""Lois Lane temporarily gets superpowers.  Atlas and Samson travel through time to compete with Superman for her affections.""  This could even be straight out of ""Lois Lane issue #53"" for all I know.  The genius of Grant Morrison is that he can take a wacky plot like this and make you believe it.  In the COMIC.  However, in the MOVIE, you just aren't going to buy it.  You aren't used to this.  You didn't grow up reading this kind of story, you don't see this on TV, they wouldn't even do it on a Saturday morning cartoon these days.So, I'm cheating.  I really think this is worth about 3.2 stars.  The animation is okay, but not outstanding.  It does capture the feel of Frank Quietly's art, though.  The voice acting...well, how do they record these things?  Does each actor come in separately and record his/her dialogue and then leave?  It never feels as though the characters are actually talking to each other.  But, I'm rounding it up to 4 stars because I love the orginal series so much.  And with the 2 disc set you get a nice 30 minute bit with Grant talking about the comic.P.S.

With a Man's Courage""","[9, 14]","Watch this movie:There has been some criticism of this film, let me address that.All Star Superman was the best comic adaptation of Superman in decades, and this film is hardly different from that. Due to time constraints (though I don't know why they didn't just make it the necessary two hours), the story is a little jumpy and not enough is made of Superman's great feats/challenges. A lot is changed and dropped, subplot-wise, and the voice acting is acceptable but not the best I've seen. I say this is 4/5 stars for a casual fan, and to give it less than three is unnecessary hyperbole. For me, it's a no-brainer five stars. I just love this Superman. The source material is brilliant, the adaptation is acceptable, the animation is the best in a DC movie you've ever seen, the acting is solid, the ending is truly great, and is different from the comics.If there is a flaw with this film, I already touched on it. The disjointedness of all the little subplots is confusing, and it ends up feeling like you're watching a few 15 minute episodes in between the main story. Still, that isn't to say those stories are unenjoyable.Again, 4 stars when taking into consideration its imperfections.

1398018,AHF97M45JFCB,B004EE2ZY2,ONENEO,"[20, 27]","Allow me, for the sake of justifying my complaints about this piece from the onset, to say that I am a subscriber to the theory that the DCAU crew is responsible for the absolute best incarnations of the DC comic characters of all time.  Whenever I begin to burn out on the whole animated comic hero industry, a trip to my Batman the Animated Series collection or through a few Justice League Unlimited episodes are all it takes to remind me of everything that is right about the concept of turning static comic panels into animated life.That said, I've noticed many of the crew responsible for the aforementioned properties (Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, the late Dwayne McDuffie and company) have since shifted gears from weekly serial production to animated feature film work exclusively.  While a few of these features have been pretty darn impressive (I enjoyed Batman: Under the Red Hood, Superman/ Batman Public Enemies and Justice League Crisis on Two Earths to mention a few) but All Star Superman is one of the oddest animated films I've encountered, DCAU or otherwise, in quite some time.All-Star Superman, on which this picture is based, is a twelve-issue comic book series featuring Superman that ran from November 2005 to October 2008. The series was written by Grant Morrison, drawn by Frank Quitely, digitally inked by Jamie Grant and published by DC Comics.The film incarnation is actually the tenth in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line released by Warner Premiere and the first in the line that is rated PG (as opposed to the usual PG-13 rating).The plot goes like this: Dr. Leo Quintum and his P.R.O.J.E.C.T. Team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped, genetically enhanced Lex Luthor clone. Superman saves the doomed crew, but it turns out that in the process has been overdosed with radiation that, while responsible for increasing his power initially, is actually slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death.Playing off the unique angle of the arch nemeses responsible for the inevitable death of the other, there is a lot of potential in this plot structure.  Sadly, I felt as though the delivery of these ideals never manages to live up to the possibilities.For starters, this 76-minute film suffers from the undeniable feeling of trying to fit entirely too many key moments from the 12-issue book run into a little over an hour's worth of narrative.  As expected, this mash of plot threads often comes off as completely disconnected from one another.  Characters appear frequently, do something completely contrived, then vanish for the duration of the film.  Detours like Superman's encounter with Samson and Atlas and even the Kryptonian scientists will leave even the most diehard fans of the franchise scratching their heads in ""what in the world was that?"" theatrics.These threads work out in the books on which this film is based simply because they are given due time to develop.  Perhaps had they been integrated here more subtly earlier on and allowed to play out in the background to the seriousness of the larger issues at hand, they may have worked out here as well.  Instead they come off as unnecessary plot devices.However, in all fairness there are a few qualities here that prevent this one from sinking like a cinder block.  Among these are the opportunity to witness Frank Quitely's bright crisp art work come to animated life and a modern take on the Lois Lane character.In all though the end result here is quite a muddled mess.  The story itself is interesting and arguably tragic enough to warrant looking into the mini-series but the film will most certainly under-whelm both fans of the books and of past DCAU efforts alike.",3,An Intriguing Tale Not Up To DCAU's Standards,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,3849,"['sake', 'justifying', 'complaints', 'piece', 'onset', 'say', 'am', 'subscriber', 'theory', 'DCAU', 'crew', 'responsible', 'absolute', 'best', 'incarnations', 'DC', 'comic', 'characters', 'time', 'Whenever', 'begin', 'burn', 'out', 'whole', 'animated', 'comic', 'hero', 'industry', 'trip', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'collection', 'few', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'episodes', 'are', 'remind', 'everything', 'right', 'concept', 'turning', 'static', 'comic', 'panels', 'animated', 'life.That', 'said', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'many', 'crew', 'responsible', 'aforementioned', 'properties', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'Alan', 'Burnett', 'late', 'Dwayne', 'McDuffie', 'company', 'have', 'shifted', 'gears', 'weekly', 'serial', 'production', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'work', 'exclusively', 'few', 'features', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'darn', 'impressive', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Superman/', 'Batman', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Justice', 'League', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'mention', 'few', 'All', 'Star', 'Superman', 'one', 'oddest', 'animated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'DCAU', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'time.All-Star', 'Superman', 'picture', 'based', 'twelve-issue', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'featuring', 'Superman', 'ran', 'November', '2005', 'October', '2008', 'series', 'was', 'written', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'drawn', 'Frank', 'Quitely', 'digitally', 'inked', 'Jamie', 'Grant', 'published', 'DC', 'Comics.The', 'film', 'incarnation', 'actually', 'tenth', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Animated', 'Original', 'Movies', 'line', 'released', 'Warner', 'Premiere', 'first', 'line', 'rated', 'PG', 'opposed', 'usual', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'plot', 'Dr.', 'Leo', 'Quintum', 'P.R.O.J.E.C.T', 'Team', 'are', 'exploring', 'Sun', 'when', 'are', 'sabotaged', 'booby-trapped', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'clone', 'Superman', 'doomed', 'crew', 'out', 'process', 'been', 'overdosed', 'radiation', 'responsible', 'increasing', 'power', 'initially', 'actually', 'slowly', 'killing', 'Luthor', 'having', 'orchestrated', 'death', 'Superman', 'employment', 'General', 'Sam', 'Lane', 'arrested', 'thanks', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'article', 'sentenced', 'death.Playing', 'off', 'unique', 'angle', 'arch', 'responsible', 'inevitable', 'death', 'other', 'lot', 'potential', 'plot', 'structure', 'Sadly', 'felt', 'delivery', 'ideals', 'never', 'live', 'up', 'possibilities.For', 'starters', '76-minute', 'film', 'suffers', 'undeniable', 'feeling', 'trying', 'fit', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'key', 'moments', '12-issue', 'book', 'run', 'little', 'hour', 'worth', 'narrative', 'expected', 'mash', 'plot', 'threads', 'often', 'off', 'completely', 'disconnected', 'one', 'Characters', 'appear', 'frequently', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'contrived', 'then', 'vanish', 'duration', 'film', 'Detours', 'Superman', 'encounter', 'Samson', 'Atlas', 'even', 'Kryptonian', 'scientists', 'will', 'leave', 'even', 'most', 'diehard', 'fans', 'franchise', 'scratching', 'heads', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'theatrics.These', 'threads', 'work', 'out', 'books', 'film', 'based', 'simply', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'time', 'develop', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'been', 'integrated', 'here', 'more', 'subtly', 'earlier', 'allowed', 'play', 'out', 'background', 'seriousness', 'larger', 'issues', 'hand', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Instead', 'come', 'off', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'devices.However', 'fairness', 'are', 'few', 'qualities', 'here', 'prevent', 'one', 'sinking', 'cinder', 'block', 'are', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'Frank', 'Quitely', 'bright', 'crisp', 'art', 'work', 'come', 'animated', 'life', 'modern', 'take', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'character.In', 'end', 'result', 'here', 'quite', 'muddled', 'mess', 'story', 'interesting', 'arguably', 'tragic', 'enough', 'warrant', 'looking', 'mini-series', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'under-whelm', 'fans', 'books', 'past', 'DCAU', 'efforts', 'alike']",N/A

However,Luthor has something terrible planned for him as a consequence.The voice performances were excellent and unusually good for this special DVD release.  It was good to hear Ed Asner (Lou Grant from Mary Tyler Moore) as Perry White.  He did portray J.J. Jameson in the Spiderman cartoon of the 1990's.  It's too bad this wasn't a live action film.

Superman and Luthor clash when Luthor plans to give Superman cancer.  This does not stop Supes from making it all go right in saving the planet.Several points of interest:  He wants to do a few things before he dies so he gives Lois Lane a super serum so she has powers for 24 hours.  He has a hard time revealing his true identity as she says ""great that you impersonated Clark.""  Hilarious.Another point is the Fortress of Solitude -- a doctor friend of his grants it that name.  A key that ways many tons and it's under a floor mat!Finally, his run-in with Kryptonian astronauts that want to save the world from the ""human apes"" but then discover the minerals in their bodies are turning into kryptonite.  This is new from Morrison.  I never heard of that possibility though it makes sense.  These two are never saved either, but are placed into the Phantom Zone.  That part of the story ended quietly but no further development.The ending was a bit  of a puzzle to me, as Luthor hands over the genetic code of Superman.  Were they planning on making a new Superman?  Ends on a question rather than give more answers but that can be satisfying to some.And whatever happened to Kandor?  Superman stated he found a planet for it to colonize, but they left that plot hole open.I did enjoy Superman's run-in with Samson and Atlas and Superman's handling of the unaswerable question of the Sphinx.  Smart guy!Disc two has its positive points too.  Two episodes, parts one and two, ""Blasts from the Past"" about the discovery by a professor of the Phantom Zone and in his experiments finds a woman there who has said her time is up and that she should be released.  But when Superman in his kind-hearted way releases her, Marta finds she has powers and that there is no reason why she cannot rule Earth.  She releases Jax-Ur, another mad scientist and military genius and off we go!  This animated feature reminds me a lot of the original movie Superman II and the release of Kryptonians.Why is it that whenever we meet Kryptonians that they want to take over the planet?Some features that I enjoyed included the interviews with Grant Morrison and Dan Didio as well as the previews for Superman/Batman Apocalypse and Green Lantern Emerald Knights.  These are actually ""sneak peeks"" that don't have the animation in place, but do have the rough sketches and voice actors going through the paces.  I always liked original art and this is no exception.The interviews with the producers and writers are really interesting as well.  What is their mind-set?  This is what I like best about Bruce Timm and his intentions and how that translates into animation.And the Emerald Knights interviews and sketches is great fun.  Arisia is the new GL and she's learning about all these stories and new characters in her first visit to Oa, complete with stories about Kilowogg, the martial arts expert Laira and a great Mongo story!The overall package is a five star package, though the All Star Superman main event didn't really end well for me, despite being very entertaining and in line with the original comics series.Recommended.",5,"Both DVDs are well-made, polished productions!",1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3194,"['quite', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'Disc', 'one', 'main', 'story', 'Star', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'Luthor', 'clash', 'when', 'Luthor', 'give', 'Superman', 'cancer', 'not', 'stop', 'Supes', 'making', 'go', 'right', 'saving', 'planet.Several', 'points', 'interest', 'do', 'few', 'things', 'so', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'super', 'serum', 'powers', '24', 'hours', 'hard', 'time', 'revealing', 'true', 'identity', 'great', 'impersonated', 'Clark', 'point', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'doctor', 'friend', 'grants', 'name', 'key', 'ways', 'many', 'tons', 'floor', 'mat', 'Finally', 'run-in', 'Kryptonian', 'astronauts', 'want', 'save', 'world', 'human', 'apes', 'then', 'discover', 'minerals', 'bodies', 'are', 'turning', 'kryptonite', 'new', 'Morrison', 'never', 'heard', 'possibility', 'sense', 'two', 'are', 'never', 'saved', 'either', 'are', 'placed', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'part', 'story', 'ended', 'quietly', 'further', 'development.The', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'puzzle', 'Luthor', 'genetic', 'code', 'Superman', 'Were', 'planning', 'making', 'new', 'Superman', 'Ends', 'question', 'rather', 'give', 'more', 'answers', 'can', 'be', 'satisfying', 'some.And', 'happened', 'Kandor', 'Superman', 'stated', 'found', 'planet', 'colonize', 'left', 'plot', 'hole', 'open.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Superman', 'run-in', 'Samson', 'Atlas', 'Superman', 'handling', 'unaswerable', 'question', 'Sphinx', 'Smart', 'guy', 'Disc', 'two', 'positive', 'points', 'too', 'Two', 'episodes', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'Blasts', 'Past', 'discovery', 'professor', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'experiments', 'woman', 'who', 'said', 'time', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'when', 'Superman', 'kind-hearted', 'way', 'Marta', 'powers', 'reason', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'rule', 'Earth', 'Jax-Ur', 'mad', 'scientist', 'military', 'genius', 'go', 'animated', 'feature', 'lot', 'original', 'movie', 'Superman', 'II', 'release', 'Kryptonians.Why', 'meet', 'Kryptonians', 'want', 'take', 'over', 'planet', 'features', 'enjoyed', 'included', 'interviews', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'Dan', 'Didio', 'as', 'well', 'previews', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Emerald', 'Knights', 'are', 'actually', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'animation', 'place', 'do', 'have', 'rough', 'sketches', 'voice', 'actors', 'going', 'paces', 'always', 'liked', 'original', 'art', 'exception.The', 'interviews', 'producers', 'writers', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'mind-set', 'what', 'like', 'best', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'intentions', 'how', 'Emerald', 'Knights', 'interviews', 'sketches', 'great', 'fun', 'Arisia', 'new', 'GL', 'learning', 'stories', 'new', 'characters', 'first', 'visit', 'Oa', 'complete', 'stories', 'Kilowogg', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'Laira', 'great', 'Mongo', 'story', 'overall', 'package', 'five', 'star', 'package', 'All', 'Star', 'Superman', 'main', 'event', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'line', 'original', 'comics', 'series.Recommended']",N/A

Where the comic story was meandering and disjointed, this movie cuts out all of the tangents and keeps things more focused. And it focuses on the right things too: The relationships between Superman, Lois, and Lex. After watching this, the comic story made a lot more sense to me.The setup for the tale is this: Lex has tricked Superman into getting overexposed by the sun's rays. This triples his power, while also poisoning his cells. Superman is going to die, and there's nothing he can do about it. In the seriousness of this situation, Superman sets out to &#34;get his house in order&#34;, so to speak, and accomplish his last-day tasks. There is also a nicely epic confrontation with Lex Luthor.Good take on the Superman mythos. And I really enjoyed the conclusion of this story. As I said, to me it made way more sense than the comic.

The only downfall is it couldn't fit enough of the novel into the film, but hey they only have so much time in the film.  Superman is more powerful than we have ever seen him and Lex is smarter than ever before.  The fights are good, the other elements are amazing too.  I mean Superman's key to the Fortress of Solitude is under a welcome mat.  When Lois asks why so careless he says try and lift the key.  She trys and obviously can't.  The key weighs half a million tons!!!  Now granted something that heavy and dense would sink right into the Earth and through it and fly out into space, but this is just one of many cool thing in the film.

1398044,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B004EE2ZY2,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[8, 11]","Superman is one of the most recognizable icons in the world today. He has many adoring fans of all his media. He has been seen in comic books television and films and heard through radio serials and word of mouth.  In the mid 1990s Bruce Timm, after much success with his animated series of Batman, decided to move his talents to Superman. What he gave us was a true strait off the page Superman that was yet to be seen in visual media. This was a Superman that showed weaknesses just as deep as his strengths. His ability to care as well as his ability to slug it out with super natural threats. Most importantly this was a Superman that the fans have wanted to see brought to life Still, over time this vision remained in the shadow of its film counterpart which lacked his characteristics we still had yet to see that were as authentic as Bruce Timm's vision.Bruce Timm's DCAU film projects have featured Superman doing what he does best, saving humanity and punishing evil.  Now we have the newest film `All Star Superman'. This was a film I was eager to see much like all the others, but what I got was something I never would have expected. I was aware of the plot and aware of the films basis, but this was the first time I have ever seen a specific side of the Man of Steel . That was a side of his I always knew was there, but this film brought it right out into the open and that is the Man of Steel's heart of gold. This film is very different from all the other films as a matter of fact, it is a work of art. The film touches on Superman's want to love and care for others. In the moments where he feels the most vulnerable are the moments he wears his heart on his sleeve for all to see. We see his relationship to Lois taken to brand new heights, his caring for his parents and even the urge to save the fallen like his arch nemesis Lex Luthor. Of course we are not without some amazing battles, but even in the bloodshed there is a deep emotion thrown into every punch that Superman throws.  The voice cast for this film is amazing. While so many want the regular voices of the DCAU greats, they are not always perfect for the films. Anthony LaPaglia was a perfect Luthor for this film because he was able to show a heartless Lex as well as one who seeks redemption. Christina Hendricks brings a brand new spunk to Lois with her perfect comedic timing as well as her most vulnerable of moments. James Denton could not have been a more perfect Superman for this project. He gave his all to bring out the Superman you see in this film. He gave Superman a heart and made this Superman so real and that is why I think I enjoyed this film.There was a lot of negative feedback about this film so far, but I think it's because in order to love this film, you need to have a true love for Superman. You have to remember all the major factors that made him who he is from his origin story to the legendary quote ""Look...up in the sky!"" You have to have know, not just the names Clark Kent or Lois Lane, but Christopher Reeve, George Reeves and Teri Hatcher.  This is a movie that will lift you possibly make you cry, and make you feel emotions of love, loss and hope. 'All Star Superman', is a film that we Superman fans have secretly been waiting for, because it shows us fans of the DCAU and its creators that there is so much more than can be brought to a superhero besides the powers and flashy costumes. Because under the mask and the symbol, we all share the most important similarity of all, we are all human.Also this was a perfect final project for DCAU writer Dwayne McDuffie who passed away one day after this DVD release. He gave us some of the DCAUs best work and this is couldn't be a better send off.",5,A Side of Superman I Have Never Seen Before.
