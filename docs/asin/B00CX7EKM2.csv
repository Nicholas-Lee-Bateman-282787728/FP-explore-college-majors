Had I realized before renting it that it was yet another of those hand-held jerky camera flicks, I would have moved right along and rented the original and best of that genre - The Blair Witch Project.  I know, I know, a lot of people hate Blair Witch, but at least I felt it was original for what it was, and not just another derivative imitation.  The first Paranormal Activity movie - ditto.  At least it was somewhat more thought-provoking.  But alas, EVIDENCE suffers from so many cliches and unanswerable questions that I had the plot twist figured out in the first 5 minutes.  In other words - it was transparent, predictable, and there was nothing new to hold the viewer's attention.  By the time the credits roll, you're actually grateful, but left wondering why you wasted almost 2 hours of time that you'll never be able to get back.My advice to filmmakers at this point is - enough of the jerky hand-held camera FX.  Been there, done that.  And while you're at it, try having an actual SCRIPT.  If you can't come up with one, give me a call and I'll write you one that'll blow you away.  The real problem with films of this type is that they try to depend on shock value or cleverness, and the world has changed and evolved. We're no longer impressed by gore and glib dialog. We actually want substance. Think SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Think WITNESS (which has very LITTLE dialog, and none of it glib!).  Movies are about mood - and when they deteriorate to ""talking heads"" (the trademark of television vs. film) they become the kind of film that is quickly forgotten... but not quickly enough in this case.Another problem with this movie is that there was NO character development.  The most interesting character was a 16-year old boy running away from home, but of course he's the first one killed, so the rest of the characters spend most of their time running in circles and serving themselves up to the killers like a bunch of drunken lemmings diving off the nearest cliff.  Finally, I've always wondered in movies like this why the characters don't get together and have a little pow-wow that goes something like this:  ""Let's see, folks.  When Joe Blow was killed, who among our group was unaccounted for?""  Gee... there's your killer(s).  If it's that easy to figure out, it ain't worth the time to destroy the ""evidence.""",1,EnOuGh WiTH tHe JeRKy CaMeRA EFfecTX!,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2430,"['like', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'lot', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'such', 'luck', 'Had', 'realized', 'renting', 'was', 'yet', 'hand-held', 'jerky', 'camera', 'flicks', 'would', 'have', 'moved', 'right', 'along', 'rented', 'original', 'best', 'genre', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'know', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'hate', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'least', 'felt', 'was', 'original', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'derivative', 'imitation', 'first', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'ditto', 'least', 'was', 'somewhat', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'alas', 'EVIDENCE', 'suffers', 'so', 'many', 'cliches', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'had', 'plot', 'twist', 'figured', 'out', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'transparent', 'predictable', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', ""'re"", 'actually', 'grateful', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'wasted', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'time', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back.My', 'advice', 'filmmakers', 'point', 'enough', 'jerky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'FX', 'Been', 'there', 'done', ""'re"", 'try', 'having', 'actual', 'SCRIPT', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'one', 'give', 'call', ""'ll"", 'write', 'one', ""'ll"", 'blow', 'away', 'real', 'problem', 'films', 'type', 'try', 'depend', 'shock', 'value', 'cleverness', 'world', 'changed', 'evolved', ""'re"", 'longer', 'impressed', 'gore', 'glib', 'dialog', 'actually', 'want', 'substance', 'Think', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'Think', 'WITNESS', 'very', 'LITTLE', 'dialog', 'none', 'Movies', 'are', 'mood', 'when', 'deteriorate', 'talking', 'heads', 'trademark', 'television', 'vs.', 'film', 'become', 'kind', 'film', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'not', 'quickly', 'enough', 'case.Another', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', '16-year', 'old', 'boy', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'course', 'first', 'one', 'killed', 'rest', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'running', 'circles', 'serving', 'killers', 'bunch', 'drunken', 'lemmings', 'diving', 'off', 'nearest', 'cliff', 'Finally', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'movies', 'why', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'have', 'little', 'pow-wow', 'something', 'Let', 'see', 'folks', 'When', 'Joe', 'Blow', 'was', 'killed', 'who', 'group', 'was', 'unaccounted', 'Gee', 'killer', 's', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'ai', ""n't"", 'time', 'destroy', 'evidence']",Evidence

1651843,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00CX7EKM2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","With as many `found footage' films that have been done in the past two decades, I can imagine it would be pretty hard to come up with some angle that would seem fresh much less inventive or inspired; but EVIDENCE - to its credit - does try to eek out some additional mileage from the unique narrative format.  Instead of exploring either horror or the paranormal (two genres so prevalent linked with `found footage'), director Olatunde Osunsanmi and screenwriter John Swetnam go for broke with the police procedural, utilizing the captured footage from camcorders, security tapes, and/or cell phones for investigators trying to piece together what may or may not have happened in some bloody rampage.Unfortunately - like Icarus - they flew a bit too close to the sun when concocting their cinematic nightmare, inadvertently stripping away what makes `found footage' so unique by instead fashioning a whodunit that makes about as much sense as ... well ... as trying to conceive an entire police procedural in the guise of a `found footage' motion picture.  It doesn't fail perfectly ... but, then again, whatever does?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Police detectives Burquez (the lovely Radha Mitchell) and Reese (TRUE BLOOD's Stephen Moyer) realize they're likely dealing with a psychopath on the loose when they discover an abandoned gas station housing five brutal murders.  The press are demanding answers, but all the investigators have are a series of video and cell phone cameras that apparently have captured the bloodshed from a variety of angles and vantage points.  Can they piece together what happened before the crazed, torch-wielding lunatic strikes again?  They'd better, or else there'll be hell to pay!There's absolutely nothing wrong with the premise behind EVIDENCE.  At its core, it's little more than a procedural - albeit one with a bloated understanding of the involved science - that cleverly pushes the bounds of believability mostly because no one has the smarts to ask, ""Why is it that the killer somehow managed to trap every needed clue on tape?  Was that really the best course of action ... or was this fool simply dying to be caught?""  Of course, therein lies the story's fatal rub - just WHO was dying to get caught? - that Burquez and Reese never quite see past; as such, one could easily assume they're destined to fail (and fail miserably) from the beginning.As a character drama (which it is mildly), John Swetnam's script raises a lot of minor issues - Why was Reese suspended or on leave? What is Burquez's background, and why does her Brooklyn-esque accent fade in and out? Why is it a torch cutter can seemingly stretch miles (I exaggerate) away from its source tanks without failing? - that never get a clear explanation.  Sure, there are some hints (Reese's daughter met an untimely demise we learn in the last act), but is that why he was on a leave of absence from the force?  One could argue that there are other hints that never get suitable answers, nor definitive exploration, and that's why EVIDENCE leaves many clues still on the table.For as hard as it tries, the film is no THE USUAL SUSPECTS told with a contemporary twist (the `found footage' conceit).  There are plenty of sparks in its narrative engine - the two very different casts clearly have a lot of fun with the material they've been provided - but, in the final summation, there's quite a bit here that just isn't properly unearthed.  Alas, the ending smacks of almost desperate invention, and I would've expected a bit more from the last reveal than what's inevitably delivered.Director Osunsanmi is no stranger to the `found footage' picture.  In 2009, he explored THE FOURTH KIND, a paranormal mystery involving alleged alien abduction.  Alas, that film ended up being mired in some controversy, as Osunsanmi - who helped pen the script - insisted on marketing the film as if it were a documentary tied to an exact exploration of the events as they occurred, going so far as to suggest that one of his actresses was indeed the original victim of a possible abduction; given the fact that the actress's resume was available for anyone to see on IMDB.com at the time, the end result was that most critics dismissed it - as they do most films exploring paranormal phenomenon - and an otherwise solid motion picture failed to find a larger audience.EVIDENCE (2013) is produced by Bold Films, FilmEngine, and Marc Platt Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through RLJ Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, wow!  The film looks and sounds incredible solid, especially given the proposed ""limitations"" of the damaged found footage; no expense was spared in given the flick an impressive, high gloss look (which might actually buy it a few more points in the `credibility' department given the somewhat convoluted story).  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  EVIDENCE is the kind of film that, the more you think about it, the less and less and less sense it makes.  It's ambitious - much like all of the young people at the heart of its labyrinth storyline - but, like those same young'uns, it just ain't up to snuff.  As a one-time rental, you'll probably be as modestly entertained as I was.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of EVIDENCE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,EVIDENCE Can't Quite Separate Its Mysteries From Its Clues,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,5807,"['as', 'many', 'found',

There's nothing more annoying than putting a movie in, sitting down on the couch, settling in with no expectations, and sighing as the credits role in disappointment.I consider myself easy to please when it comes to genre films. I don't expect any movie to venture too far outside of the lines these days. As much as I hate saying it, there really is nothing new under the sun. I just want the filmmakers to take what's been done before, shake it up a bit, and give it their own spin. Unfortunately, Image Entertainment's ""Evidence"" falls short of achieving the aforementioned goal.Five people are murdered at an abandoned desert gas station. Two detectives are given the job of sifting through the only evidence left at the crime scene: video footage from the cell phones and cameras the victims shot. It soon becomes evident that the killer is playing with the two investigators. The two must now piece together what happened before the psychopath decides to strike again.A friend of mine gave me some good advice one time. He told me that any drink or food that has more than one synonym in its description can't be good for you. I find this can apply to movies as well much of the time. ""Evidence"" is one of those films. It can be described using several different terms like horror, thriller, slasher, and found footage. If you can do it successfully, it really doesn't sound so weird to have these different elements mixed together.The two biggest issues with ""Evidence"" is pacing and believability. Long stretches of nothing happen while people walk around with flashlights and cell phones, which gets old quickly. It sort of sabotages the element of surprise. How can we be surprised by something unexpected happening when we're constantly waiting for it? I can't even begin to tell you how implausible the outcome of the movie is.The cast of ""Evidence"" is impressive for an indie film. It stars Stephen Moyer (""True Blood"") and Rhada Mitchell (""Silent Hill,"" ""Olympus Has Fallen"") as detectives investigating the killings. Torrey DeVitto from ""Pretty Little Liars"" plays lead victim Leann.As I watched ""Evidence,"" I kept wondering if I would find Oren Peli's name among the producers of the film. It plays out like a drawn-out version of ""Friday the 13th"" meets ""The Chernobyl Diaries."" At least director Olatunde Osunsanmi was smart enough to pull out of the found footage enough to give audiences a break from the overused filming technique and show what sort of chops he really has.If you like found footage and slasher movies, then ""Evidence"" might appeal to you. It tries really hard to mash the two sub-genres together. However, the film falls apart due to poor pacing and an unbelievable finale.",3,"""Evidence"" Mixes Found Footage and Slasher Genres Together Unsuccessfully",1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,2765,"['really', 'do', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'get', 'review', 'nothing', 'more', 'annoying', 'putting', 'movie', 'sitting', 'down', 'couch', 'settling', 'expectations', 'sighing', 'credits', 'role', 'disappointment.I', 'consider', 'easy', 'please', 'when', 'genre', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'venture', 'too', 'far', 'lines', 'days', 'As', 'much', 'hate', 'saying', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'just', 'want', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'shake', 'up', 'bit', 'give', 'own', 'spin', 'Unfortunately', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'Evidence', 'short', 'achieving', 'aforementioned', 'goal.Five', 'people', 'are', 'murdered', 'abandoned', 'desert', 'gas', 'station', 'Two', 'detectives', 'are', 'given', 'job', 'sifting', 'only', 'evidence', 'left', 'crime', 'scene', 'video', 'footage', 'cell', 'phones', 'cameras', 'victims', 'shot', 'soon', 'evident', 'killer', 'playing', 'two', 'investigators', 'two', 'must', 'now', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'psychopath', 'strike', 'again.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'gave', 'good', 'advice', 'one', 'time', 'told', 'drink', 'food', 'more', 'one', 'synonym', 'description', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'find', 'can', 'apply', 'movies', 'well', 'much', 'time', 'Evidence', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'using', 'several', 'different', 'terms', 'horror', 'thriller', 'slasher', 'found', 'footage', 'can', 'do', 'successfully', 'really', ""n't"", 'sound', 'so', 'weird', 'have', 'different', 'elements', 'mixed', 'together.The', 'two', 'biggest', 'issues', 'Evidence', 'pacing', 'believability', 'Long', 'stretches', 'nothing', 'happen', 'people', 'walk', 'flashlights', 'cell', 'phones', 'old', 'quickly', 'sort', 'sabotages', 'element', 'surprise', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'surprised', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happening', 'when', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'waiting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'tell', 'how', 'implausible', 'outcome', 'movie', 'is.The', 'cast', 'Evidence', 'impressive', 'indie', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'True', 'Blood', 'Rhada', 'Mitchell', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'killings', 'Torrey', 'DeVitto', 'Pretty', 'Little', 'Liars', 'lead', 'victim', 'Leann.As', 'watched', 'Evidence', 'kept', 'wondering', 'would', 'find', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'name', 'producers', 'film', 'out', 'drawn-out', 'version', 'Friday', '13th', 'meets', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'least', 'director', 'Olatunde', 'Osunsanmi', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'pull', 'found', 'footage', 'enough', 'give', 'audiences', 'break', 'overused', 'filming', 'technique', 'show', 'what', 'sort', 'chops', 'really', 'has.If', 'found', 'footage', 'slasher', 'movies', 'then', 'Evidence', 'might', 'appeal', 'really', 'hard', 'mash', 'two', 'sub-genres', 'together', 'However', 'film', 'apart', 'due', 'poor', 'pacing', 'unbelievable', 'finale']",Evidence

The set-up gives the filmmakers the opportunity to make two completely different terrible movies in one--it's a found footage thriller, where the characters talk to the camera, shriek and argue a lot and are generally so annoying that you want them to get killed already and also a thoroughly inept police procedural, where the filmmakers reveal that everything they learned about police work came from watching bad television shows.  Then there's the ending--I don't doubt that the filmmakers think their twist ending was super clever but, seriously, a smart murderer isn't going to make a video saying look-at-me-I'm-the-murderer and deliver it to the media and the police because it makes it kind of hard to, you know, get away with the murders if everyone knows who you are and what you look like.

1651851,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00CX7EKM2,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","In the desert of Nevada, police uncover one of the most brutal crime scenes they've ever seen. There are a ton of bodies that are so badly mutilated, that they can't even tell if their victims are male or female. There is also an overwhelming lack of evidence, that is except for one small mini-cam found amongst the ruble. Evidence was one of those films that wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either. There is enough going on that you will keep watching it and you will be glad you did! Watching as many movies as I do, I tend to figure things out pretty quickly, and I was sure I had this film figured out early on. As I got to the end of the film, I was sure I knew what happened, and I was somewhat disappointed at the predictable story. Then, the writers throw a huge twist into the plot that you will never see coming and it really makes the whole film. Evidence quickly becomes one of those films that will keep you thinking about it long after the credits role, and too me, that is the best kind of movie. No one of name really stars in this film and there really aren't any stand out performances, it's just one of those movies that stands on a strong story. I usually hate these cheaply made, found footage films. The plots are lazy and they rely on cheap scares and effects to make people jump, but Evidence wasn't like that. The film starts off really slowly, but gets better and better leading up to an ending that no one will ever see coming.

The film is not just about watching events through the perspective of the camera (and its holder). It is also about putting together the multiple visual sources to solve a horrible murder case. The idea is not bad. Actually I found it intriguing. Sadly, in &#8220;Evidence,&#8221; bad direction ruins everything.The film starts out pretty good, with one visually impressive sequence showing the crime scene, an abandoned gas station in the desert outside Las Vegas. There are several dead bodies, mutilated and burnt, and video cameras all heavily damaged. Two detectives played by Stephen Moyer and Radha Mitchell attempt to solve the case by piecing together the visual records left at the crime scene.Each found-footage sequence is not very scary. The process of investigating the video evidence is not thrilling, either. In short, &#8220;Evidence&#8221; is slack and dull. About halfway through the story you stop caring.
