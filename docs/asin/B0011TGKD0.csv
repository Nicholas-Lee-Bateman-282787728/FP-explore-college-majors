1132250,A2WJ6Y2KOXJ6FD,B0011TGKD0,Cerebellum,"[8, 18]","Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against.  The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.",1,Man vs. Hotel,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,827,"['Bear', 'Grylls', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'show', 'completely', 'worthless', 'survival', 'standpoint', 'do', 'not', 'Title', 'Man', 'vs.', 'Wild', 'are', 'enough', 'people', 'going', 'natural', 'world', 'already', 'title', 'bad', 'name', 'something', 'must', 'fight', 'man', 'admitted', 'staging', 'scenes', 'show', 'staying', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'almost', 'anything', 'say', 'natural', 'living', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'entertainment', 'then', 'show', 'three', 'stars', 'However', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'survival', 'information', 'not', 'interested', 'seeing', 'fool', 'run', 'around', 'woods', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Survivor', 'Man', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Brown', 'field', 'guides', 'are', 'great', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'interested', 'survival', 'not', 'just', 'cheap', 'entertainment']",Man vs. Wild: Season 1
1132251,A3PLXREAEU980M,B0011TGKD0,Dreggor Gade,"[14, 25]","I write this review because it is important for viewers to understand that a great deal of the ""survival"" advice doled out on this show is not only false but can endanger people if they take it seriously. The makers and distributers of this program are irresponsible and reckless.Parents, this is mainly a warning for you.Some of the host's ""techniques"" are baloney, and many of the ""survival choices"" he makes are extremely inadvisable and should not be followed by the average person (or even the intermediate wilderness adventurer).Most people know by now that the show is faked. The fact that it is faked is of secondary concern to me. (The host sometimes stays in hotels when supposedly sleeping in the wild. Several scenes are obvious set-ups with props, pre-hunted animals, and domesticated animals among other tricks. The crew does a great deal of the work for the host.)Why is this? Why does he pretend to do these things when he is really faking them? For entertainment certainly, but more importantly because a lot of what he does is extremely stupid. So stupid and far-fetched that not even Grylls himself would do it because he might actually kill himself.If you want to get your yuks watching a guy eat disgusting things that his crew has found for him (or that his bladder has produced), there's nothing wrong with that. The problem is when people take this joker seriously. If average viewers were to follow his advice if they ever were put in a real survival situation, they would reduce their chances of living and likely kill themselves.So, parents, either don't let the kids watch this show, or make sure that they understand that it is ""make believe."" They need to know that it is fake and should never be copied, even if they find themselves in a survival situation.There are better books and programs out there with reasonable and realistic survival advice ( e.g.Survivorman).",1,"Dangerous, bad advice and generally fraudulent.",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1899,"['write', 'review', 'important', 'viewers', 'understand', 'great', 'deal', 'survival', 'advice', 'doled', 'out', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'false', 'can', 'endanger', 'people', 'take', 'seriously', 'makers', 'distributers', 'program', 'are', 'irresponsible', 'reckless.Parents', 'mainly', 'warning', 'you.Some', 'host', 'techniques', 'are', 'baloney', 'many', 'survival', 'choices', 'are', 'extremely', 'inadvisable', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'followed', 'average', 'person', 'even', 'intermediate', 'wilderness', 'adventurer', '.Most', 'people', 'know', 'now', 'show', 'faked', 'fact', 'faked', 'secondary', 'concern', 'host', 'sometimes', 'hotels', 'when', 'supposedly', 'sleeping', 'wild', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'obvious', 'set-ups', 'props', 'pre-hunted', 'animals', 'domesticated', 'animals', 'other', 'tricks', 'crew', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'host', 'Why', 'Why', 'pretend', 'do', 'things', 'when', 'really', 'faking', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'more', 'importantly', 'lot', 'what', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'far-fetched', 'not', 'even', 'would', 'do', 'might', 'actually', 'kill', 'himself.If', 'want', 'get', 'yuks', 'watching', 'guy', 'eat', 'disgusting', 'things', 'crew', 'found', 'bladder', 'produced', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'problem', 'when', 'people', 'take', 'joker', 'seriously', 'average', 'viewers', 'were', 'follow', 'advice', 'ever', 'were', 'put', 'real', 'survival', 'situation', 'would', 'reduce', 'chances', 'living', 'likely', 'kill', 'themselves.So', 'parents', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'show', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'make', 'believe', 'need', 'know', 'fake', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'copied', 'even', 'find', 'survival', 'are', 'better', 'books', 'programs', 'out', 'there', 'reasonable', 'realistic', 'survival', 'advice', 'e.g.Survivorman']",Man vs. Wild: Season 1
