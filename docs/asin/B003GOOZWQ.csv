This movie has it all and yet nothing.  The earth is slowing down, there are radiation spikes, but happily, there's an unqualified theorist (Charles Shaughnessy) who knows exactly what's going on but he's off in the wilderness pouting so a great deal of coaxing has to take place before we get to the part where everyone needs to run screaming.  There's also a few stall tactics along the way involving an old flame (Tracy Nelson) and her brother, the expert scoffer who helped send the unqualified theorist into the wild.  There's even an anti-nuke message thrown in for good measure (like we really needed that).Normally, I love doomsday on cue movies, they can be quite amusing.  Usually though, they are amped up so high with a sense of urgency that you're easily carried away before you can start questioning their premise.  Here though, they have the opposite problem.  This movie is so low-keyed and laid back one wonders what the problem is....the world is slowing down, so what?  The scenes of destruction are few and far between and involve a lot of Styrofoam in place of chucks of concrete.  The only actors I enjoyed watching were Clive Revill and Beth Grant, as for the rest....eh.At least it was short.  But I won't be watching it again, not a keeper.",2,"""It's happening!""",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1426,"['Birds', 'flying', 'east', 'now', 'portent', 'doom', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'have', 'take', 'word', 'birds', 'were', 'actually', 'heading', 'wrong', 'direction', 'movie', 'yet', 'nothing', 'earth', 'slowing', 'down', 'are', 'radiation', 'spikes', 'happily', 'unqualified', 'theorist', 'Charles', 'Shaughnessy', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'off', 'wilderness', 'pouting', 'so', 'great', 'deal', 'coaxing', 'take', 'place', 'get', 'part', 'where', 'everyone', 'run', 'screaming', 'also', 'few', 'stall', 'tactics', 'way', 'involving', 'old', 'flame', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'brother', 'expert', 'scoffer', 'who', 'helped', 'send', 'unqualified', 'theorist', 'wild', 'even', 'anti-nuke', 'message', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'really', 'needed', '.Normally', 'love', 'doomsday', 'cue', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'amusing', 'Usually', 'are', 'amped', 'up', 'so', 'high', 'sense', 'urgency', ""'re"", 'easily', 'carried', 'away', 'can', 'start', 'questioning', 'premise', 'Here', 'have', 'opposite', 'problem', 'movie', 'so', 'low-keyed', 'laid', 'back', 'one', 'what', 'problem', '.the', 'world', 'slowing', 'down', 'what', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'involve', 'lot', 'Styrofoam', 'place', 'chucks', 'concrete', 'only', 'actors', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'were', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'rest', '.eh.At', 'was', 'short', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'not', 'keeper']",N/A
