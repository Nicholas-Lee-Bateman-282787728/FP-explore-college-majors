She fills up her stage time with mediocre performances, insincere ballads and a confident stage presence that's about as believable as her performance in Enough.I'm sure lots of people will like this DVD. I didn't hate it, but it's a let down from her previous DVD ""Feelin So Good"" which showed you all of the videos and performances she gave supporting her first album. Hopefully she'll put out another DVD with videos and performances which are alot more enjoyable than this concert. Just because someone wants to be in a concert doesn't mean they should be. And just because they are doesn't mean it's gonna be good.What's Enjoyable: The audience seems to be having a great time seeing Jlo do her thing. Jlo seems to be having a good time doing it as well. There's plenty of energy and alot of nice costume changes which is always nice.What's Horrible: Jlo can't seem to seperate herself as an actress and a singer which often shows. Everytime she pauses for dramatic effect (which is about every fifteen seconds) it looks like she's having a seizure. It's very hard to take someone seriously when they look brain dead. Almost the entire concert is lip synched and what isn't should be. Many of her most famous songs are missing. This concert was performed well after her second cd came out and yet she mostly does songs from her first cd.All in all this is a very bland DVD concert. I'm a huge fan of Jenny's and when she's on stage doing performances on The Tonight Show or the VMAs its usually a very exciting experience, but this is not exciting at all. It's like a really bad dress rehersal and if I were her, I would be embarassed and ashamed to have it be seen live.For a better concert, pick up Britney Spear's Dream Within A Dream: Live In Las Vegas Tour DVD or Janet's All For You: Live In Hawaii Tour DVD.",2,"Not To Be A Hater, But....",1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,1944,"['Miss', 'Jenny', 'who', 'succeeded', 'almost', 'everything', 'done', 'proves', 'here', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'talent', 'creativity', 'up', 'stage', 'time', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'insincere', 'ballads', 'confident', 'stage', 'presence', 'about', 'as', 'believable', 'performance', 'Enough.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lots', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'let', 'down', 'previous', 'DVD', 'Feelin', 'So', 'Good', 'showed', 'videos', 'performances', 'gave', 'supporting', 'first', 'album', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'videos', 'performances', 'are', 'alot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'Just', 'someone', 'be', 'concert', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'mean', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'good.What', 'Enjoyable', 'audience', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'seeing', 'Jlo', 'do', 'thing', 'Jlo', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'energy', 'alot', 'nice', 'costume', 'changes', 'always', 'nice.What', 'Horrible', 'Jlo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'seperate', 'actress', 'singer', 'often', 'Everytime', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'having', 'seizure', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'someone', 'seriously', 'when', 'look', 'brain', 'dead', 'entire', 'concert', 'lip', 'synched', 'what', ""n't"", 'should', 'be', 'Many', 'most', 'famous', 'songs', 'are', 'missing', 'concert', 'was', 'performed', 'well', 'second', 'cd', 'came', 'out', 'yet', 'mostly', 'songs', 'first', 'cd.All', 'very', 'bland', 'DVD', 'concert', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Jenny', 'when', 'stage', 'doing', 'performances', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'VMAs', 'usually', 'very', 'exciting', 'experience', 'not', 'exciting', 'really', 'bad', 'dress', 'rehersal', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'embarassed', 'ashamed', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'better', 'concert', 'pick', 'up', 'Britney', 'Spear', 'Dream', 'A', 'Dream', 'Live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Tour', 'DVD', 'Janet', 'All', 'Live', 'Hawaii', 'Tour', 'DVD']",N/A

734206,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B000087EXR,J. Lizzi,"[9, 11]","I've been waiting for J.Lo's ""Let's Get Loud"" concert recording to come out on DVD ever since the first television broadcast over a year ago.  Even though, this gig is from the exact same concert in Puerto Rico, I'm happy to say that there are significant enhancements over what was aired on TV (originally in late 2001, I think).  Here are some of the features:  1) vivid color; the DVD picture quality is awesome; 2) very good sound, with the audio now [thankfully] synched up with the video; 3) an extended version of ""Ain't It Funny"" which includes a Latin tap routine (not Flamenco, but with some of the attitude); 4) additional musical and dance interludes between Jennifer's costume changes; and 5) sensational dancer and band introductions (really fun).On the strength of J.Lo's stage presence I'd rate the concert an A+, although I wish it were longer.  Her look (wow!), the music and the dancing combine for virtually perfect dynamics.  Even though Jennifer's voice isn't booming, she hits the notes well, while avoiding the Celine-like wailing resonance for the high notes.  She also possesses an exemplary attitude, never talking down to the audience, while maintaining a warm rapport with her ""home"" crowd.  Her covers of ""Do You Know Where You're Going To?"" and Selena's ""I Could Fall In Love"" were quite strong, with the latter bringing tears to many in the audience (we still miss her ...).  The funky numbers simply jam.I'd give ""thumbs up"" to the camera work and editing, which never lost sight of the main attraction, but also made timely diversions to the band members and dancers at key points in the show.  The audience is shown a tad too much for my liking (one of my concert video pet peeves), but not enough to detract from the overall experience.The only bonus DVD feature consists of a ten-minute video montage (kind of like a mini travelogue) of Puerto Rico:  it's the best-of-the-beautiful on a very dynamic and pretty island, and the accompanying music is uplifting as well.",5,Excellent; huge improvement over the TV broadcast,1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,2004,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'J.Lo', 'Let', 'Get', 'Loud', 'concert', 'recording', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'ever', 'first', 'television', 'broadcast', 'year', 'ago', 'Even', 'gig', 'exact', 'same', 'concert', 'Puerto', 'Rico', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'are', 'significant', 'enhancements', 'what', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'originally', 'late', '2001', 'think', 'Here', 'are', 'features', '1', 'vivid', 'color', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'awesome', '2', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'audio', 'now', 'thankfully', ']', 'synched', 'up', 'video', '3', 'extended', 'version', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Funny', 'Latin', 'tap', 'routine', 'not', 'Flamenco', 'attitude', '4', 'additional', 'musical', 'dance', 'interludes', 'Jennifer', 'costume', 'changes', '5', 'sensational', 'dancer', 'band', 'introductions', 'really', 'fun', '.On', 'strength', 'J.Lo', 'stage', 'presence', ""'d"", 'rate', 'concert', 'A+', 'wish', 'were', 'longer', 'look', 'wow', 'music', 'dancing', 'combine', 'virtually', 'perfect', 'dynamics', 'Even', 'Jennifer', 'voice', ""n't"", 'booming', 'notes', 'well', 'avoiding', 'Celine-like', 'wailing', 'resonance', 'high', 'notes', 'also', 'exemplary', 'attitude', 'never', 'talking', 'audience', 'maintaining', 'warm', 'rapport', 'home', 'crowd', 'covers', 'Do', 'Know', 'Where', ""'re"", 'Going', 'Selena', 'Could', 'Fall', 'Love', 'were', 'quite', 'strong', 'latter', 'bringing', 'tears', 'many', 'audience', 'still', 'miss', 'funky', 'numbers', 'simply', 'jam.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'never', 'lost', 'sight', 'main', 'attraction', 'also', 'made', 'timely', 'diversions', 'band', 'members', 'dancers', 'key', 'points', 'show', 'audience', 'shown', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'liking', 'one', 'concert', 'video', 'pet', 'peeves', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'overall', 'experience.The', 'only', 'DVD', 'feature', 'ten-minute', 'video', 'montage', 'kind', 'mini', 'travelogue', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'best-of-the-beautiful', 'very', 'dynamic', 'pretty', 'island', 'accompanying', 'music', 'uplifting', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Everyone is sitting here saying that it is cheezy and she is lip-singing and the concert has no effects.  I am not a hard core fan but even I can defend her.  Only about 2 or 3 songs are lip-synced , everyone knows it is very hard to dance and sing at the same time, look at Britney and Madonna, so not singing all the songs live is common.  Next, this is her ONLY concert ever aas of yet as a treat to her fans.  So excuse her if she did not spend millions of dollars on fancy effects andhard core dance moves,  lets keep in mind that she is not going to go out of her way for one show.  If it was a world wide concert with 70 cities like Janet well then you would get the effects and stuff, but this is a one day thing.  COme on people you do not expect her to spend months practicing and hiring people to do all these costumes and stuff for one show.  Keeping that in mind it is done well and she does a good overall performance.  I know when she does a world concert it will be a lot more detailed and planned but for what it is I think it was done well.  And her voice is the same as any other everyday singer out there.
