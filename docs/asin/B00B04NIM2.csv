Dudley,"[3, 4]","Two of Steven Seagal's lesser movies are combined onto a single blu-ray for this release in the form of 2006's ""Attack Force"" and 2005's ""Into the Sun"". If you can't stand Seagal, then stay far away from both of these movies. But even as a long time fan like myself, both of these movies are a chore to get through.""Attack Force"" was director Michael Keush's 2nd film with Steven Seagal after the surprisingly enjoyable ""Shadow Man"". The film was originally shot with aliens being the villians being aliens but at some point during post production, the plot was completely changed with new dialogue being dubbed in places as well as reportedly newly shot scenes to change the vllians to being bio terrorists wanting to release a drug that turns people into ultra violent killers into the water supply. The big problem though that in addition to making the finished product an incomprehensible mess, traces of the alien subplot remains in some scenes making it even more confusing.The other huge problem with Attack Force is that about half of Seagal's dialogue was dubbed by another actor with a voice that doesn't even sound close to Seagal's speaking voice. It's very distracting and only adds to the badness of the film. There's also a lack of Seagal butt kicking in the movie too that makes it way too talky and just plain boring. Even Seagal completists will struggle to finish this one.2005's ""Into the Sun"" is the better film but that isn't saying much. Featuring a large 35 million dolar budget which is surprising for what was a direct to DVD release in most territories, it certainly looks good. But the plot is very disjointed involving the yakuza and also features a noticeable absence of Seagal fight scenes.Basically, you will only want to buy this if you don't own the movies on DVD already and are a super hardcore Seagal fan. The picture quality is pretty good and a noticeable step up from the DVD's but isn't that large of an improvement to warrant upgrading.And yes, Steven is big as a barn in both of these films which could be the reason for the lack of fight scenes. He did co-write both films as well as co-producing them too so he might at this point be trying to prove himself in those particular areas but he needs to come out with much better and consistently good product if he wants to retain his fanbase that still exists. Some recent films have shown improvement but with him being in his early 60's now, I doubt that we'll ever see a film again that can measure up to the greatness of Above the Law and his next 4 films.",2,Two bad Steven Seagal movies on a single blu-ray for one low price.,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2553,"['Two', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'lesser', 'movies', 'are', 'combined', 'single', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'form', '2006', 'Attack', 'Force', '2005', 'Into', 'Sun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Seagal', 'then', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'movies', 'even', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'movies', 'are', 'chore', 'get', 'Attack', 'Force', 'was', 'director', 'Michael', 'Keush', '2nd', 'film', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'aliens', 'being', 'villians', 'being', 'aliens', 'point', 'post', 'production', 'plot', 'was', 'completely', 'changed', 'new', 'dialogue', 'being', 'dubbed', 'places', 'as', 'well', 'reportedly', 'newly', 'shot', 'scenes', 'change', 'vllians', 'being', 'bio', 'terrorists', 'wanting', 'release', 'drug', 'people', 'ultra', 'violent', 'killers', 'water', 'supply', 'big', 'problem', 'addition', 'making', 'finished', 'product', 'incomprehensible', 'mess', 'traces', 'alien', 'subplot', 'scenes', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'confusing.The', 'other', 'huge', 'problem', 'Attack', 'Force', 'half', 'Seagal', 'dialogue', 'was', 'dubbed', 'actor', 'voice', ""n't"", 'even', 'sound', 'close', 'Seagal', 'speaking', 'voice', 'very', 'distracting', 'only', 'badness', 'film', 'also', 'lack', 'Seagal', 'butt', 'kicking', 'movie', 'too', 'way', 'too', 'talky', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Even', 'Seagal', 'completists', 'will', 'struggle', 'finish', 'one.2005', 'Into', 'Sun', 'better', 'film', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Featuring', 'large', '35', 'million', 'dolar', 'budget', 'surprising', 'what', 'was', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'most', 'territories', 'certainly', 'good', 'plot', 'very', 'disjointed', 'involving', 'yakuza', 'also', 'noticeable', 'absence', 'Seagal', 'fight', 'scenes.Basically', 'will', 'only', 'want', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'movies', 'DVD', 'already', 'are', 'super', 'hardcore', 'Seagal', 'fan', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'noticeable', 'step', 'up', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'large', 'improvement', 'warrant', 'upgrading.And', 'yes', 'Steven', 'big', 'barn', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'lack', 'fight', 'scenes', 'did', 'co-write', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'co-producing', 'too', 'so', 'might', 'point', 'be', 'trying', 'prove', 'particular', 'areas', 'come', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'consistently', 'good', 'product', 'retain', 'fanbase', 'still', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'improvement', 'being', 'early', '60', 'now', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'can', 'measure', 'up', 'greatness', 'Above', 'Law', 'next', '4', 'films']",Attack Force & Into the Sun Double Feature
1620669,A3GU3HDF2A5RZ5,B00B04NIM2,R. Grossman,"[0, 0]","I bought this double-feature for about $5 on Blu-ray -- how can you go wrong? Well, after attempting to watch both movies, I feel that I overpaid.&#34;Attack Force&#34; is just bad -- I thought the disk was defective because it was out of sync, but it is the truly horrible dubbing in action. In fact, I looked down for a while (I was multitasking, the movie was so bad) and kept wondering who the new voice was, only to see it was Steven Seagal. He really has a distinctive voice, but not here. Anyway it's a ridiculous and confusing story staring a large and out of shape action hero doing very little action. I made it about 40 minutes into this and gave up on it.Then I tried &#34;Into the Sun&#34;. Not quite as bad, in my opinion, but still pretty awful. Poor acting all the way around, helped by the fact that more than half the film isn't in English (if you can't understand them, you can't say for sure that it's really bad). A predictable action movie story but not very much action. I gave up on this one when the predictable love story sub-plot came into play.So, having given up on both of these films, I can't say for sure that they stink through and through. But on a scale of movie enjoyment that ranges from &#34;love it&#34; to &#34;hate it&#34;, these fall into &#34;endure&#34; or &#34;tolerate&#34;. I think you can find better uses for your time.
