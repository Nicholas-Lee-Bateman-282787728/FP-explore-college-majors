1504064,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005UNI2XY,CriticNic,"[3, 5]","I tend to gravitate towards coming-of-age stories, so naturally I was very intrigued by the Italian film Corpo Celeste upon seeing the trailer. The feelings of isolation, uncertainty, and self-discovery often hit personal chords with me when the film is executed well and they always leave a lasting impression on me far more noteworthy than films of other genres. Corpo Celeste looked promising to fulfill those traits judging from the images of religion and exploration shown through a natural looking style.I've been let down by trailers before, though, but I couldn't help but still be excited. Luckily most of my expectations were met. Most noticeable is the natural, sometimes shaky camera work. This technique is often very effective in these types of films, as it produces more of a feeling we're observing the characters up close and personal rather than simply watching a movie. A near perfectly execution of this style is seen in the British film Fish Tank, which this film reminded me of in a few aspects.The film follows 13 year old Marta who's recently moved back to Reggio Calabria, her native region in Italy, after a 10-year stint in Switzerland. She's quiet, sweet, innocent, and curious. She's more of an observer and and explorer, which we quickly gather from the beginning. Her mother is a hard worker, working at a seemingly rough and fast-paced bakery to make ends meet. Marta's sister is a practitioner of tough love, which is most prominent when she scolds Marta, who's just baked her older sister a birthday cake all by herself, simply for wearing her bra.Marta is soon enrolled in the local Catholic confirmation class, which provides more material for her to observe and ponder. The teacher could be any other school teacher in the way she discusses the scriptures and runs her classroom. The students memorize prayers as they would mathematical formulas. Though Marta doesn't say a whole lot, especially while in class, we read a lot from her expressions. From the few questions she raises, it's clear she is more interested in the meaning behind the teachings which dumbfounds the teacher, who would prefer the students listen and memorize.Marta is an easy character to fall in love with. Actress Yle Vianello is a natural in playing the quiet and adventurous girl. Back to my comparison of Fish Tank, she reminded me of actress Katie Jarvis, not in terms of their characters' personalities or situations, but rather their organic and authentic portrayal that really makes us believe that they've been through what we're seeing. The little details, such as how she looks at herself in the mirror, how she interacts with her mother, and the look on her face when she's observing various other characters, make it feel as if she's more than just acting. And in situations where she's upset, it's quite heartbreaking to watch.There's a fairly important segment in the film where Marta had been running on the streets (after seeing something quite upsetting) and she's picked up by the priest, Don Mario (Salvatore Cantalupo, Gomorrah). She had recently been observing the priest's behavior in pursuing a potentially selfish agenda, which in addition to her confirmation lessons only alludes to the hypocrisy of the Church. While riding with Don Mario, who's seeking a certain cross to show off to a high-profile audience member, Marta learns much more about the real world and we see her begin to develop her own thoughts on God and faith.This film does all of the right things for making a movie of this genre. The raw style fits perfectly, the story is minimal and natural feeling. But most importantly, the acting is spot on which if not can easily break a film like this. Yle Vianello dominates, but the entire cast felt authentic. To me, you can make two types of coming-of-age films: one that tells a story with a conclusion where the character learns a life lesson, or one that more observes several scenarios with less focus on a single story. Corpo Celeste is the latter, which in my opinion is a much harder film to make and let alone be enjoyable. Everything is executed well here, and the true test of which it passed was whether it made me feel attached to the characters and experience many emotions towards them.Corpo Celeste is a profound look into the life of a girl finding herself and her faith by way of challenging everything around her. This is the type of movie that offers more of an experience than a story, and leaves you feeling satisfied but more importantly, wondering what's next for the main character. Having that type of impact draws the line between a good movie and a meaningful film. This has always been one of my favorite genres and Corpo Celeste is another example of why. It may have not been as edgy or gritty as something like Fish Tank, but still had the emotional impact I expect from these types of films.Source: criticnic.com 7 November 2012Disclosure: Film sent by

1504066,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005UNI2XY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","It's so rare to see any serious contemplation of religion in movies today that the subject always feels fresh.  The Italian film ""Corpo Celeste,"" however, does not present itself as a message movie.  It strikes a very personal tone as one young girl at the brink of womanhood tries to understand how religion might (or might not) be incorporated into her life.  In a culture where religion is such a dominating force, 13-year old Marta might easily be dismissed as a trouble maker.  But with a clear eye, she sees not the idea of religious practice but its implication.  Instead of blindly accepting prescribed doctrine, she seems to be on a spiritual journey of her own.  And her quiet reflection might be quite a bit more meaningful.  I had heard certain criticism leveled at ""Corpo Celeste"" for its portrayal of the Catholic Church.  Some say the portrait is too broad, but I heartily disagree.  I think it presents the individuals involved as full fledged characters struggling to retain meaning in their own lives.  That, to me, is far more realistic than unquestioned devotion and service.Marta, from the start, is presented as an outsider.  Having spent a decade abroad, she struggles to fit back into the church hierarchy.  As her confirmation date approaches, she quietly observes the actions unfolding before her.  From the insecurities of her teacher, to the apathy of the priest, to a class of students just going through the motions--Marta doesn't appear to be convinced of the importance of her big day.  ""Corpo Celeste,"" though, doesn't spell much out for the viewer.  You might interpret the film's central themes in a number of ways.  It is not driven by plot, but in small moments as Marta explores the world around her and tries to make sense of her new maturity.  Yle Vianello, as Marta, doesn't always say a lot but she conveys much with her quiet observations.  At times she is merely inquisitive and at times she seeks to provoke, but she is always trying to exert her individuality.  As I said, the movie doesn't serve up many big dramatic moments or cue a certain emotional response.  Your reaction to the film is likely to be very personal.  Maybe that's as it should be as we each value religion and/or spirituality in completely individual ways.The DVD presentation has a Bonus Short Film from Germany called ""Raju.""  This 25 minute endeavor was Oscar nominated and it's easy to see why.  It feels like a fully satisfying and thought provoking feature film and not a short!  A German couple in India decide to adopt a boy.  When tragedy strikes, it brings the whole adoption process into question and the couple struggle to reconcile their personal desires against their moral duties.  ""Raju"" asks some difficult and weighty questions, and I admired and respected the fact that it doesn't take the easy way out.  It's both bold and exceedingly well acted and it gets my highest recommendation.  Along with ""Corpo Celeste,"" there is much food for thought in this DVD release.  Stark, raw, and surprisingly open-ended, there is a haunting quality to the selections that may linger with you long after viewing.  And that can never be a bad thing!

Film Movement releases films in the US on DVD that otherwise would never find an audience here.""Corpo Celeste"", roughly translated as ""Celestial Body"" (2011 release from Italy; 99 min.) brings the tender coming of age tale of 13 yr. old Marta, who recently relocated from Switzerland back to the family roots in southern Italy. She is preparing for Confirmation, a religious passage-of-age not unlike say the Bar/Bat Mitzvah in the Jewish faith, and the pressure to ""fit in"" with the rest of her Confirmation class is huge, not to mention the troubles at home (mon being non-functionally always in bed with some sickness, and disagreements with her 18 yr. old sister). There are no huge plot developments, we are simply watching Marta coping and getting ready for the day of Confirmation, as she struggles to find her identity. Religion plays a huge role in this movie, obviously, and the local priest, Father Mario, is a key to the movie as well.I have to say I was enthralled by the movie from start to finish. Two revelations (not in the religious sense, of course) are young actress Yle Vianello in the role of Marta, she simply blew me away, and also first time writer-director Alice Rohrwacher, I cannot wait to see what she will bring next. As a further aside, this DVD comes with a bonus short film, as is the custom on Film Movement DVDs, and the 25 min.

1504069,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005UNI2XY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Corpo Celeste (Alice Rohrwacher, 2011)I don't even remember what originally prompted me to add Corpo Celeste to my Netflix queue. I am relatively certain it has been there since a few days after we resubscribed in November 2011, and I finally got round to watching it in August 2013. It had always intrigued me, but I was a little put off by its place in my queue, which I sort by star rating; it is consistently in the bottom ten percent. I have my hypotheses, now that I have watched it, on why this is. Most of them I am not going to touch on, though if you read between the lines I'm pretty sure they'll be clear enough. But this one, since it's part of the thesis for the entire review, I have to put out there--this is one of those art-school-style slow films. There is not a great deal of action here, though there is much under the surface that warrants the viewer's attention, and (as befits a film that centers around Mother Church as much as this one does) a great deal of symbolism here that will require the viewer to think a bunch, and possibly to be familiar with customs that are not quite American. (There is a wonderful, funny-yet-depressing scene ten minutes before the end of the movie whose significance I would have missed entirely had I not watched Mahomet-Saleh Haroun's A Screaming Man the week before, which has a variation on the same shot, but in a much less symbolic fashion, as a part of its closing sequence.) From this, you might actually be able to skip the rest of this review; if you are a fan of slow film of the Ozu/Tarr/etc. variety, I would hazard a guess that you will find a great deal here to enjoy. On the other hand, if you prefer movies that spell things out a little more, you might do better to avoid this one. I hope you are of the former stripe, because if you glom onto what Rohrwacher, turning in her first feature (she previously directed a documentary I have not yet tracked down--but after seeing this, it's on my priority list), is doing here, there are many reasons to devote your time to Corpo Celeste.The movie centers on Marta (Yle Vianello in her first screen appearance--I fervently hope it is not her last as well), a thirteen-year-old Italian girl raised in Switzerland, but whose mother has moved back to the Old Country (why is never specified). Her mother (Pasqualina Scuncia, also making her first screen appearance) and older sister (The New Monsters Today's Paola Lavini) are not religious folks, but Marta finds herself drawn to the Catholic church, and begins catechism classes under the tutelage of Rita (We Can Do That's Anita Ciprioli), the long-suffering assistant to local priest Don Mario (Gomorrah's Salvatore Cantalupo). While she initially throws herself into her religious studies with a great deal of fervor, the more she discovers about the inner workings of the church, the more she questions what she had initially seen as her faith--until an act of shocking violence makes her question whether she wants to commit herself.A movie in which not much happens save one central scene of violence that is almost entirely out of place? It's obvious Alice Rohrwacher is a big fan of B&eacute;la Tarr's, and if you've followed my reviews at all, you know that's as good as me saying ""this is the best thing ever."" It is a film that is chock full of symbolism, it is (to put it mildly) leisurely-paced, and judging by the IMDB boards, a lot of people looked at the movie's final scene and said ""what exactly is it that I am watching here?"". I can't exactly call this a spoiler: Marta, having wandered down to the beach, meets a small cadre of local children. One of them, eyes wide with wonder, puts something into her hand. This part I did have to look up afterwards: it is a disembodied lizard's tail. (I had thought it a worm of some sort.) She looks down at it, still thrashing around in the throes of autotomy, and considers it in the context of everything that has happened to her over the course of the film. Is that a spoiler? No--the spoiler lies in how you interpret the scene. But then, everyone has an interpretation. Better, perhaps, to say that the spoiler is in whether your interpretation of the scene is optimistic or pessimistic. In any case, I lost my train of thought there, as so often happens when I am confronted with this sort of beauty. Suffice to say that this is not a movie for everyone. But if slow film is your bag--if you like Ozu and Tarr and Jon Jost and folks like that--you're going to dig this.
