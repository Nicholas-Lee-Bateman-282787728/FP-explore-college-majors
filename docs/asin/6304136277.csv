403647,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,6304136277,Alric the Red,"[46, 53]","Skimming through the reviews for this movie, I was disappointed at a couple of the extremely harsh criticisms.  While there are perhaps some elements bearing a semblance to a made-for-TV feature, ""trash"" seems an utterly over-the-top comment, missing the very simple point this film made.  I was very moved by this movie, and watched it three times when it was new, on VHS.  It's on my list of films I consider underrated and ignored by audiences, as it was simply not an exciting story per se.  Something about the snow and cold seem to tamp down what action there was, and the filmmakers didn't try to broaden its appeal by pumping up the action with some cinematic gimmick.  Instead, they opted to simply tell a story.  You're either connected to it by its premise or you're not.  I got connected early on, and I found myself almost panting in dread for the father's desperate moments as he destroyed the evidence, one of the few scenes that would pass as having any REAL action.  I immediatly took his side, understood his disregard for the incorrectness of it.  At the end I was heartbroken.Every now and then, everyone lines up to praise something like SIDEWAYS (a good film; I'm not disagreeing), but the filmmakers' attempts at indie-film understatement are belied by a script full of quirky characters stimulated by equally quirky events.  A film like BEFORE AND AFTER depends strictly on the familial realism in which obligation and dependability are core values, and what happens when events challenge their depth and present the necessity of risking one's own freedom in the slim hope of preserving a son's.  Sometimes a more primal integrity supercede's one's obligation to the law.  Nothing cute or sweet happens here, and it's strictly for mature audiences, in that the subject matter is presented soley from the adults' point of view, from their sense of responsibility and self-doubt.Whenever I'm participating in a film newsgroup or a film subscriber-list and the subject of favorite but lesser-known films comes up, I always mention BEFORE AND AFTER.  I'm glad to see that it's been released on DVD and I'm going to be ordering it as soon as I finish this review.",5,A Family Torn Asunder,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2182,"['Skimming', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'couple', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'criticisms', 'are', 'perhaps', 'elements', 'bearing', 'semblance', 'made-for-TV', 'feature', 'trash', 'utterly', 'over-the-top', 'comment', 'missing', 'very', 'simple', 'point', 'film', 'made', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'movie', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'VHS', 'list', 'films', 'consider', 'underrated', 'ignored', 'audiences', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'exciting', 'story', 'se', 'Something', 'snow', 'cold', 'seem', 'tamp', 'down', 'what', 'action', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'broaden', 'appeal', 'pumping', 'up', 'action', 'cinematic', 'gimmick', 'Instead', 'opted', 'simply', 'tell', 'story', ""'re"", 'either', 'connected', 'premise', ""'re"", 'not', 'got', 'connected', 'early', 'found', 'almost', 'panting', 'dread', 'father', 'desperate', 'moments', 'destroyed', 'evidence', 'one', 'few', 'scenes', 'would', 'pass', 'having', 'REAL', 'action', 'immediatly', 'took', 'side', 'understood', 'disregard', 'incorrectness', 'end', 'was', 'heartbroken.Every', 'now', 'then', 'everyone', 'lines', 'up', 'praise', 'something', 'SIDEWAYS', 'good', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'disagreeing', 'filmmakers', 'attempts', 'indie-film', 'understatement', 'are', 'belied', 'script', 'full', 'quirky', 'characters', 'stimulated', 'equally', 'quirky', 'events', 'film', 'BEFORE', 'AND', 'AFTER', 'strictly', 'familial', 'realism', 'obligation', 'dependability', 'are', 'core', 'values', 'what', 'when', 'events', 'challenge', 'depth', 'present', 'necessity', 'risking', 'one', 'own', 'freedom', 'slim', 'hope', 'preserving', 'son', 'more', 'primal', 'integrity', 'supercede', 'one', 'obligation', 'law', 'Nothing', 'cute', 'sweet', 'happens', 'here', 'strictly', 'mature', 'audiences', 'subject', 'matter', 'presented', 'soley', 'adults', 'point', 'view', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'self-doubt.Whenever', ""'m"", 'participating', 'film', 'newsgroup', 'film', 'subscriber-list', 'subject', 'favorite', 'lesser-known', 'films', 'up', 'always', 'mention', 'BEFORE', 'AND', 'AFTER', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'ordering', 'as', 'soon', 'finish', 'review']",N/A
403648,A2582KMXLK2P06,6304136277,B. E Jackson,"[2, 4]","Before and After is a minor masterpiece of compelling storytelling and even remarkably clever with its use of suspense.  It's about a police officer who knocks on a family's door one night and basically accuses the teenage boy of being a murderer (since a teenage girls body was discovered out in the snow, and the boy was the last person to be seen with her).  This prompts the mother and father to react accordingly (and believably) to such surprising news.What makes the suspense work during the first 40 minutes is that the boy actually runs away from home, so there's *two* interesting aspects to the storytelling- the father attempting to cover up a potential murder involving his son, and the whereabouts of the teenager.  I really liked this aspect of the storyline.  It was a little different from the usual ""Did he do it?"" murder mystery because half of the mystery was just figuring out where he was.Without spoiling too much, eventually the boy is discovered and, you know, the storyline does a pretty spectacular job keeping you guessing whether the boy actually murdered the girl or whether it's all a huge misunderstanding.  The second half of the film is taken up with many lawyer/courtroom segments- most of which are pretty interesting (thankfully, since normally these portions drag on and on in other movies) but not as memorable as the first half of the movie with the murder cover-up and the missing boy.Perhaps the ending wasn't as shocking or as interesting as I had hoped, but there you have it.  Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson play the mother and father role perfectly and my appreciation for their talents has been raised another level after the movie was over.  Just a terrific acting performance all around.  Even the teenage boy and his sister are phenomenal actors/actresses.  Overall, for some good suspense and a solid murder mystery, this is easily a 5-star movie and I really hope you give it a chance.",5,bingo,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1935,"['minor', 'masterpiece', 'compelling', 'storytelling', 'even', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'use', 'suspense', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'family', 'door', 'one', 'night', 'basically', 'teenage', 'boy', 'being', 'murderer', 'teenage', 'girls', 'body', 'was', 'discovered', 'out', 'snow', 'boy', 'was', 'last', 'person', 'be', 'seen', 'mother', 'father', 'react', 'accordingly', 'believably', 'such', 'surprising', 'suspense', 'work', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'boy', 'actually', 'away', 'home', '*two*', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'storytelling-', 'father', 'attempting', 'cover', 'up', 'potential', 'murder', 'involving', 'son', 'whereabouts', 'teenager', 'really', 'liked', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'usual', 'Did', 'do', 'murder', 'mystery', 'half', 'mystery', 'was', 'just', 'figuring', 'out', 'where', 'was.Without', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'eventually', 'boy', 'discovered', 'know', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'job', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'boy', 'actually', 'murdered', 'girl', 'huge', 'misunderstanding', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'taken', 'up', 'many', 'lawyer/courtroom', 'segments-', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'thankfully', 'normally', 'portions', 'drag', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'murder', 'cover-up', 'missing', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'as', 'interesting', 'had', 'hoped', 'there', 'have', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'play', 'mother', 'father', 'role', 'perfectly', 'appreciation', 'talents', 'been', 'raised', 'level', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'Just', 'terrific', 'acting', 'performance', 'Even', 'teenage', 'boy', 'sister', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'actors/actresses', 'Overall', 'good', 'suspense', 'solid', 'murder', 'mystery', 'easily', '5-star', 'movie', 'really', 'hope', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

403655,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,6304136277,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[1, 2]","The acting in this film was quite good - with the possible exception of the young actor who played Jacob. He was too wooden. The film also packs a lot of intrigue. It is definitely something that you will want to continue watching. It also weaves in a lot of family dynamics and conflict, which makes it a gripping drama.Here are some of the bad points. The lawyer and police were stereotypes. Just awful and one-dimensional. The people in the town were also one-dimensional. With the exception of one clerk at a hardware store, everyone turns against the family based on mere allegations of wrongdoing.Also, being a lawyer influences my opinion. Others might not have the same reaction. The parents behaved foolishly. First, they took matters into their own hands despite what both lawyers told them. Also, the second lawyer did not even interview his client (Jacob) despite the many times that he reminded the parents that he represented Jacob, not them. The entire resolution of the plot is completely unrealistic.I hate SPOILERS BUT WARNING: this last part contains SPOILERS. This case screamed for a plea agreement, but none was pursued. Judge knows it was an accident, but punishes him for not coming forward -- even though that is not a crime! No one discussed the relevance of his age to the legal proceeding, which was highly significant. He probably would not have received any jail time, and his record would have been expunged at 18. Also - there was no forensic evidence. Falling onto a jack would produce different wound patterns than being bludgeoned with one. Her appearance in the emergency room looked like a kid who was bludgeoned, but this is not true. So, the film is even more unrealistic. Also, it stereotypes lawyers way too much. Despite what you see on television and movies, lawyers do not rush to make wacky defenses. The diminished capacity argument was idiotic. No defense lawyer would have even gone there. Here's the more likely pattern in a case like this: interview the client, realize it was accidental, go to the prosecutor, discover that the evidence doesn't support the theory that it was murder, work out a deal so that no one gets jail time (first-time offenders, one a juvenile). The move barely reflects the way the legal system really works, and it perpetrates stupid stereotypes about that process. For all of these flaws, I can only give it a 3. You might not mind these things as a nonlawyer, but the unrealistic portrayal of the legal issues leads to implausible outcomes and crazy behavior by all of the characters, given the facts.",3,Gripping Story - But Contains Some Very Bad Elements,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2580,"['acting', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'possible', 'exception', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Jacob', 'was', 'too', 'wooden', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'intrigue', 'definitely', 'something', 'will', 'want', 'continue', 'watching', 'also', 'lot', 'family', 'dynamics', 'conflict', 'gripping', 'drama.Here', 'are', 'bad', 'points', 'lawyer', 'police', 'were', 'stereotypes', 'Just', 'awful', 'one-dimensional', 'people', 'town', 'were', 'also', 'one-dimensional', 'exception', 'one', 'clerk', 'hardware', 'store', 'everyone', 'family', 'based', 'mere', 'allegations', 'wrongdoing.Also', 'being', 'lawyer', 'influences', 'opinion', 'Others', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'reaction', 'parents', 'behaved', 'foolishly', 'First', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'what', 'lawyers', 'told', 'Also', 'second', 'lawyer', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'interview', 'client', 'Jacob', 'many', 'times', 'reminded', 'parents', 'represented', 'Jacob', 'not', 'entire', 'resolution', 'plot', 'completely', 'unrealistic.I', 'hate', 'SPOILERS', 'BUT', 'WARNING', 'last', 'part', 'SPOILERS', 'case', 'screamed', 'plea', 'agreement', 'none', 'was', 'pursued', 'Judge', 'was', 'accident', 'not', 'coming', 'forward', 'even', 'not', 'crime', 'one', 'discussed', 'relevance', 'age', 'legal', 'proceeding', 'was', 'highly', 'significant', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'received', 'jail', 'time', 'record', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'expunged', '18', 'Also', 'was', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'Falling', 'jack', 'would', 'produce', 'different', 'wound', 'patterns', 'being', 'bludgeoned', 'one', 'appearance', 'emergency', 'room', 'looked', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'bludgeoned', 'not', 'true', 'So', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'Also', 'lawyers', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'television', 'movies', 'lawyers', 'do', 'not', 'rush', 'make', 'wacky', 'defenses', 'diminished', 'capacity', 'argument', 'was', 'idiotic', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'gone', 'there', 'Here', 'more', 'likely', 'pattern', 'case', 'interview', 'client', 'realize', 'was', 'accidental', 'go', 'prosecutor', 'discover', 'evidence', ""n't"", 'support', 'theory', 'was', 'murder', 'work', 'out', 'deal', 'one', 'jail', 'time', 'first-time', 'offenders', 'one', 'juvenile', 'move', 'barely', 'way', 'legal', 'system', 'really', 'stupid', 'stereotypes', 'process', 'flaws', 'can', 'only', 'give', '3', 'might', 'not', 'mind', 'things', 'nonlawyer', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'legal', 'issues', 'implausible', 'outcomes', 'crazy', 'behavior', 'characters', 'given', 'facts']",N/A

403657,ARZNQMEBQTYBX,6304136277,Electra83,"[2, 3]","To put it simply, Before and After is a story about a family of four whose lives are forever altered when their son/brother is named a prime suspect in the death of the boy's girlfriend.  His father finds evidence of the crime in the trunk of his son's car and disposes of it immediately, terrified of what it all means.  And so the story is also about the lengths to which a father goes to protect his son.There's no doubt that the book is richer than the movie.  I can't deny that.  There are some changes that are a bit obnoxious.  For example, the death scene is different.  I understand why they changed it.  It was necessary in order to gain more sympathy for Jacob.  I think this movie was trying to show us how bad things can happen in normal families without having to ask quite so much of the viewer.  Yes, it does water down the message.  In fact, it completely changes the message.  Not only has the death scene been Hollywoodized, so has the character of Jacob.  There's that strong hint of uncontrollable anger in him, but he doesn't do the same horrible things that the book Jacob does.  The tension is still there, but the dilemma is far more simplistic and commercialized.  As a result, the movie feels, at times, like a lifeless version of the novel.  But what do you expect?  That's Hollywood.  At least we still have the book for those with the initiative to read it.  Just be warned, the book is quite disturbing.  I read it so long ago and I don't think that I was able to appreciate all the layers to it at the time, so I can't really recommend it.  But what I do know is that it's got more depth to it than the movie does.But none of this is really helpful to those who haven't read the book.  On its own, the movie makes for a compelling story but it does have some flaws.  I thought the acting was OK, though the characters were a bit one-dimensional.  Jacob didn't seem to express much emotion which makes it hard to relate to him.  This is kind of ironic, given the fact that the movie was drastically altered to make him more sympathetic to the viewer.  Honestly, though, if Jacob had been portrayed in the movie the way he was portrayed in the book, it would have been impossible to get through the film because the viciousness of his actions combined with his zero personality would have gotten to be too much. As for the plot, I think it was interesting enough, though even if you haven't read the book, you may feel like it's a bit tame.I did really love the setting.

I am happy to say that my time was not wasted in watching ""Before and After."" Meryl Streep as always is the consummate actress. When she is on the screen, you cannot take your eyes off her. Liam Neeson certainly is no slouch as an actor either.The film stays fairly close to the story line of the novel, as best I recall. Ms. Brown's novels, though very serious, always ring true. In her world, nothing is promised. In this instance a family living in Massachusetts is torn apart when the teenage son Jacob is accused of murdering a local teenage girl. While both the novel and film are entitled ""Before and After,"" we are dealing essentially with the ""after"" here, as in one moment both our entire lives and the lives of those we love can be irrevocably changed. This movie asks hard questions. To what lengths should one go to in protecting his family? Should one tell the truth no matter what the cost?

Alfred Molina is good as the lawyer, but he is still saddled with trite dialogue and courtroom drama that would have embarrassed Perry Mason.  Furlong's specialty was playing alienated, sullen kids, but he overdoes it and sleepwalks through the movie.

Unfortunately, as others have sagely pointed out, it resonates like a made for television movie, despite the stellar cast.The film takes place in a rural area of Massachusetts, where an artist by profession, Ben Ryan (Liam Neeson), and his doctor wife, Carolyn (Meryl Streep), live with their two teenage children, Jacob (Edward Furlong) and Judith (Julia Weldon). Unbeknownst to Ben and Carolyn, Jacob is carrying on with the town's junior vixen. Things come to the fore when the young woman is found dead, and their son disappears. Naturally, things do not look good for Jacob. The well respected Ryan family suddenly find itself cast in the role of the town pariah, shunned by many of the local yokels.Ben takes things into his own hand upon discovering evidence that would implicate Jacob in the girl's death and destroys that seemingly inculpatory evidence. When Jacob is apprehended and returned to face charges, the Ryans, upon the advice of a local attorney and friend, Wendell Bye (John Heard), obtain an experienced criminal defense attorney, Panos Demeris (Alfred Molina), for their son. Thereafter, Ben and Carolyn proceed to disregard everything that the attorney advises them to do. Moreover, they each do their own thing with respect to their son's interest, much to his detriment.Ben comes across as a somewhat unlikable and  doltish, single-minded character. While Carolyn, who seems to have a moral compass and knows the right thing to do, comes across as a foolish woman who neglects to include her son's  attorney in the equation. Moreover, Bem goes and does exactly the opposite of what the attorney suggests, thinking that he knows better, as does Carolyn.  The only ones in the Ryan family who are likable are our erstwhile killer and his sister.Edward Furlong gives an excellent performance as Jacob, a young man who acts inappropriately when faced with what can only be characterized as a terrible tragedy, one that he did not foresee but perhaps should have. He ultimately finds his own moral compass, despite his father, and manages to make his troubled character sympathetic.Meryl Streep gives a sanctimonious and priggish performance, barely able to rise above the banality of her character, while Liam Neeson's performance is best characterized as that of a bellowing bull in a china shop. Angelo Molina gives a an smoothly adept performance as the canny defense attorney who knows only too well what lies ahead for his hapless client, given the antics of Jacob's idiotic, though well-meaning, parents.This is a drama that should have held the viewer spellbound, but which, instead, succeeds only in irritating the viewer for the most part. Moreover, the ending is absolutely ridiculous. The filmmakers should have had a legal consultant on the payroll, preferably one with a working knowledge of criminal law. If they had, they then should have considered suing whoever advised them so poorly.",3,"OH...

The acting is absolutely flawless by the entire cast, especially: Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, Edward Furlong, and Julia Weldon. This story is about a regular, normal, every-day Massachusetts family who are Jewish. They are a very respected family in their town and almost everybody knows them. But that all changes when the son, Jacob Ryan (Edward Furlong) is accused of murdering his girlfriend and then suddenly disappearing right afterwards. His family are despartely trying to find him. Finally, he is found - in jail. He is brought home, but nothing seems the same for his family after that. Pretty soon, the entire town knows about the incident and all believe Ryan killed his girlfriend. His father, Ben Ryan (Liam Neeson), will do anything to cover-up any evidence that leads to Jacob's case. But his wife, Carolyn Ryan (Meryl Streep) and daughter, Judith Ryan (Julia Weldon), want to tell the truth even though they know what will happen to Jacob. They feel it's the right thing, since they all know the real truth. BEFORE AND AFTER is the kind of film that will make you grip the bottom of your seat until your knuckles turn as white as a ghost. It's non-stop heart pounding action. And the acting performances are just incredible. It will make you feel bad for Jacob and hope the best for him. The movie is just so realistic you forget that it's a movie and feel like you're part of it. Go and see BEFORE AND AFTER.

403674,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,6304136277,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[2, 4]","This is one of those films that actually had a decent concept and a good cast, but somehow lost its way on the road to the cineplex. The premise - that of parents trying to protect their son, accused of murder, from being unfairly punished (and how that backfires) - is actually a perfectly good idea. And the cast is primarily comprised of very good actors, including Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, and Alfred Molina. So what went wrong?The story isn't strong enough, for the most part. It has the pacing of a TV movie, with a new emotional peak every five to ten minutes, and some completely superfluous arguments and conflict just to keep the tension level high. Whether Edward Furlong's character committed murder is revealed halfway through the film, and after that, there's very little interest left - you're left to sit back and wait for events to spiral into a tailspin, with the inevitable bittersweet ending. Also, the characters are rendered fairly two-dimensional; the father (Neeson) is highly-strung but willing to do anything to protect his son, while the mother (Streep) is more conflicted but prone to simply...being baffled and helpless. There is a little bit of room for depth, but the scripted characterisations are simply too shallow to be saved. Even Edward Furlong's pivotal character, the son - who should arguably be the most well-developed of them all - can be quickly pigeonholed and filed away.Last of all, for some really strange reason, this film was and is being promoted as a mystery/thriller. It is neither of these. It's more along the lines of a tense (melo)drama, with very little mystery or thriller elements at all.

When I saw the cover, reasoning and well understood assumptions took over; Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, what could possibly go wrong with that? Well, I found out, and the answer is: a lot.  If I'm being fair, I'll admit that I didn't read the book, but I'm going to assume that it was as bad, if not worse than, the film adaptation.This movie was terrible. I was even shocked to see that Meryl Streep's acting seemed to fall a few notches in this film, though some of that was due to how awful the characters were written; the dialogue, the story-line, the actions, it was all unbelievable and silly. The worst actor of all had to be the young woman who played the daughter. She was laughably bad. OH MY GOD!Every character does the opposite of what they should. There seems to be zero logic at play. There also was very little character and relationship filling. I didn't feel bonded to any of them, nor did I care about the final outcome. I'm sitting here trying to think about how to properly express the worst aspects of this film, but it's too difficult, because the entire thing, from start to finish, was just so bad.
