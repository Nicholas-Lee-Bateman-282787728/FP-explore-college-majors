I have to say that EVERY CHARACTER in this story had the unique qualities of profound acting, tenderness of character, and the ability to capture the heart of the viewer.  You cannot watch this story unfold without being caught up in the drama, the truth, and the compassion of one woman preacher....who really had a heart for God and for all people!",5,Welcome to Paradise DVD,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,461,"['become', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'DVDs', 'were', '10', 'stars', 'rate', 'DVD', 'would', 'mark', '10', 'have', 'say', 'EVERY', 'CHARACTER', 'story', 'had', 'unique', 'qualities', 'profound', 'acting', 'tenderness', 'character', 'ability', 'capture', 'heart', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'being', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'truth', 'compassion', 'one', 'woman', 'preacher', '.who', 'really', 'had', 'heart', 'God', 'people']",Welcome to Paradise

However when a film pulls too much on the heartstrings, the feeling is sourness. That is how I feel about Welcome to ParadiseReverand Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) and her son, Hayden (Bobby Edner), are forced to move to Paradise, Texas due to the unorthodox methods Debbie uses in her sermons.Then her crisises begin. Her son become distant to her, She also find out her has a reading problem She also meet a lot of resistance from Paradise church-goers who don't believe in female ministers.  She opens her friendship to the homeless, which angers her church-goers. Then her church burns down due to one of the homeless people.Minster  Debbie and the small flock  ally together to rebuild another church in one or  the district bishop decides to not  let the charter stand.Lets say this Bernard and actors Connie ray,  Brian Dennehy and William Shockley (who also co-wrote this script) steal this film. Director and co-writer Brent Huff directs this film simple and without too many arty directive angles. The small film is got a heart  the size of texas, it is that script that brings this film downI admit this film tries to inspire. Its message is never give up. However  The writers throw too much into the swirling mess of this picture to give the audience a chance to enjoy thisThis film ends happy, like a good family film does. I rate it three stars because it is not great filmmaking, but it aint from the dung heap either.

I am glad that I did.Although Stine is not one of the lead characters, the show is well done and has a good message.  Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) is a female pastor who is fired from her job due to her unorthodox methods.  She and her son, Hayden (Bobby Edner), move to a small town, Paradise, where she takes over a small congregation.Some of the people in the church don't seem to get the essence of the Christian faith (loving God and loving people).  Debbie focuses on that and makes a real impact.There is a lot of good drama regarding a destructive fire, the church pulling together, and lots more.  This is a thought provoking show that is well worth watching.  It is not a high budget production with lots of special effects, etc.  It does however contain lots of other good elements.
