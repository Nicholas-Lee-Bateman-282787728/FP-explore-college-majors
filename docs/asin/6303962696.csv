The movie features the 7 members of the Baby-Sitters Club: Kristy, Claudia, Mary-Anne, Stacey, Dawn, Mallory, and Jessi. They decide to start a summer camp for the kids in their town with hopes that it will be a success. However, things get in the way when Kristy's (played by Schulyer Fisk, who is Sissy Spacek's daughter) father comes back into her life. Everyone around her, including her fellow members, become suspicious.The HighsSchuyler Fisk is wonderful as the BSC tomboyish leader Kristy and the rest of the cast is splendid too!

Comcast was featuring the movie on On Demand, and I watched the entire thing. I absolutely loved it! Yes, there are some things that are different from the book, but overall I think the film did a great job of maintaining the integrity of the series. The casting was perfect: the seven BSC members were all great and remained very true to their characters. The story was good and I think this is a movie that parents will enjoy watching with their kids. I'm sure that kids will enjoy this movie even if they haven't read the BSC books, and maybe the film will even inspire them to seek out the books on their own. (As good as this movie is, nothing beats Ann M. Martin's paperback classics!)

It's a great film with a good storyline, but I can't help wondering what was wrong with the casting. Let's start with the leader Kristy Thomas. There's nothing wrong with Schuyler Fisk's acting, but she simply couldn't carry out the bossy, assertive, character that Kristy had. In this movie she's whiny, wimpy and totally takes a back seat--all the qualities that the character certainly should not have had. The other six girls were decent, but if you want to see these books come to life, stick with the videos that came out in the early 90's. Those girls knew how to carry out these roles--the movie is weakened by the poor acting and the changed personalities of the leading girls. It is a sweet story and has a fine message--very much in the Baby Sitters Club tradition--but the video series is 100 times better.
