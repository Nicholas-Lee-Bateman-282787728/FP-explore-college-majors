I expected pot use and an explanation as to why he is doing a reggae album, but I also expected some descent music with some accomplished reggae musicians. This was a total waste of my time.",1,waste of time,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,369,"['wan', 'see', 'snoop', 'walk', 'slums', 'Jamaica', 'smoking', 'pot', 'occasionally', 'go', 'studio', 'record', 'really', 'bad', 'tracks', 'babble', 'past', 'ur', 'movie', 'expected', 'pot', 'use', 'explanation', 'why', 'doing', 'reggae', 'album', 'also', 'expected', 'descent', 'music', 'accomplished', 'reggae', 'musicians', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'time']",Snoop Lion - Reincarnated
1635906,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00BMVHWRK,.fgd,"[4, 6]","Snoop goes to Jamaica to express himself in a reggae way. Ok. So he has access to the best studios and The Players in Jamaica. I would have expected to see dreads or Jamaicans in those studios in control of their creative process. Who are the producers? Mostly young white men with a few token light skinned blacks. I dont see what these young white hipsters ( aaargh even the way they say bro sounds wierd) are doing so high up in the Jamaican ""scene."" Obviously imported to Jamaica so where are their cultural roots?. Except if the party is over and was over a long time ago. At one point,Snoop looked at the current Bunny Wailer with his wise eyes. I wonder what he really thinks of that glitzy,egocentric, has-been. Bunny was the man one time but too much adoration and weed fried his brain evidently.No. Snoop the Lion wont launch himself as a reggae singer surrounded by corporate monkeys in the best studios. He needs to hang out in private with real heads; I'm sure there are plenty of real dreads chilling and to be found away from the tour he got. And hire his own recording studio with ...um ...other black people and do their own thing than take marketing advice from young white corporate monkeys.He could afford to do it. Dunno, makes me wonder if Snoop's not turning into a has-been himself after seeing this film.",2,snoops wonderful as usual but the bizz is hype; party's over,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1329,"['Snoop', 'Jamaica', 'express', 'reggae', 'way', 'Ok', 'So', 'access', 'best', 'studios', 'Players', 'Jamaica', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'see', 'dreads', 'Jamaicans', 'studios', 'control', 'creative', 'process', 'Who', 'are', 'producers', 'Mostly', 'young', 'white', 'men', 'few', 'token', 'light', 'skinned', 'blacks', 'dont', 'see', 'what', 'young', 'white', 'hipsters', 'aaargh', 'even', 'way', 'say', 'bro', 'sounds', 'wierd', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'high', 'up', 'Jamaican', 'scene', 'Obviously', 'imported', 'Jamaica', 'so', 'where', 'are', 'cultural', 'roots', 'party', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'one', 'point', 'Snoop', 'looked', 'current', 'Bunny', 'Wailer', 'wise', 'eyes', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'glitzy', 'egocentric', 'has-been', 'Bunny', 'was', 'man', 'one', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'adoration', 'weed', 'fried', 'brain', 'evidently.No', 'Snoop', 'Lion', 'wont', 'launch', 'reggae', 'singer', 'surrounded', 'corporate', 'monkeys', 'best', 'studios', 'hang', 'out', 'private', 'real', 'heads', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'real', 'dreads', 'chilling', 'be', 'found', 'away', 'tour', 'got', 'hire', 'own', 'recording', 'studio', 'um', 'other', 'black', 'people', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'take', 'marketing', 'advice', 'young', 'white', 'corporate', 'monkeys.He', 'could', 'afford', 'do', 'Dunno', 'wonder', 'Snoop', 'not', 'turning', 'has-been', 'seeing', 'film']",Snoop Lion - Reincarnated

1635908,A112P214Q5VHWN,B00BMVHWRK,luvdemhuskies,"[5, 5]","This is a very interesting look into Snoop Lion's inner psyche, but it falls short in that we see more of what he wants to be like than what he is actually like right now. Peeks into the lack of full self-disclosure are snippets of Snoop's reaction when asked about why he feels vulnerable after giving up his guns. It is undoubtedly very difficult to shake off a past like Snoop's, and I admire him for trying to do so, but he apparently has some way to go, as reflected by Bunny Wailer's public renunciation of Snoop as a Rastafarian even before this documentary came out. It would have been much more interesting to have the opposing view of Snoop from the Rastafarian perspective, good and bad, as this superstar is trying to reinvent himself. In the end, it is more of a self-serving wannabe paean than a real documentary. I gave it three stars because it is fascinating to watch Snoop talk about himself and his past and there is at least the appearance of some genuine insight during some very good and entertaining segments.",3,Self-serving but fascinating,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1032,"['very', 'interesting', 'look', 'Snoop', 'Lion', 'inner', 'psyche', 'short', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'be', 'what', 'actually', 'like', 'right', 'now', 'Peeks', 'lack', 'full', 'self-disclosure', 'are', 'snippets', 'Snoop', 'reaction', 'when', 'asked', 'about', 'why', 'vulnerable', 'giving', 'up', 'guns', 'undoubtedly', 'very', 'difficult', 'shake', 'off', 'past', 'Snoop', 'admire', 'trying', 'do', 'so', 'apparently', 'way', 'go', 'reflected', 'Bunny', 'Wailer', 'public', 'renunciation', 'Snoop', 'Rastafarian', 'even', 'documentary', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'have', 'opposing', 'view', 'Snoop', 'Rastafarian', 'perspective', 'good', 'bad', 'superstar', 'trying', 'reinvent', 'end', 'more', 'self-serving', 'wannabe', 'paean', 'real', 'documentary', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Snoop', 'talk', 'past', 'least', 'appearance', 'genuine', 'insight', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'segments']",Snoop Lion - Reincarnated
