1185554,A2SOASMPD44L5G,B001ECDVGS,"Keith Dancer ""Keith Dancer""","[8, 14]","I'm so very excited that the fifth and final season of The Incredible Hulk is finally here.  During the late seventies and early eighties, I really enjoyed the show and hated it when it got cancelled.  Bill Bixby was my all time favorite actor and although he died in 1993, his spirit will live on by his best roll as Doctor David Banner.  Although he did not want to be in the show at first, his agent, incouraged him to do so and it became the greatest show that he was ever in.  I was also sad that there were several episodes that were never filmed and I wish that they could have been because when the series ended, it left serval unanswered questions such as when Doctor David Banner finally be cured of The Incredible Hulk.  That was finally answered by the final television movie of the series known as ""The Death of The Incredible Hulk"", which I highly reccommend for any Incredible Hulk fan.  I felt glad for Lou Ferrigno as The Hulk because Bill Bixby incouraged him throughtout the entire series and he became a great actor because of it.  However, I felt sorry for Jack Colvin, who played investigative reporter Jack McGee because although his articles of finding The Hulk was never resolved in the capture, they became his obsession and through it all, he became a better actor.

1185560,A1P2DHHCZ3K6JP,B001ECDVGS,O. B. Tryggvason,"[12, 13]","The final season of ""The Incredible Hulk"" consists of just 7 episodes and I'm not really all that sure as to how many of these were actual season 5 episodes. The fourth season was cut short due to a writers strike, had a late start and only 18 episodes. Before the fifth season got underway the show had already been canceled.As is, this is easily the weakest season overall. Of the 7 episodes, three are worthy of the best the series had to offer.1. The Phenom: BAD. Bad acting, bad story, lame Hulk action and an overall silly overtone ruin this one.2. Two Godmothers: Nothing special.  Stretches credibility, even by Hulk standards, weak writing and lame acting. OK Hulk-out in the middle but this is overall a forgettable affair.3. Veteran: Pretty good. Overall a suspenseful episode with a good plot twist, solid acting, good Hulk action and some nifty flashbacks.4. Sanctuary: Solid. I'd read some bad reviews for this one but I was pleasantly surprised. It's nothing special but it's entertaining nonetheless. I did find it odd to cast Diana Muldaur (previously cast as David's sister in the Season 3 episode ""Homecoming"") as the head nun.5. Triangle: Solid. OK affair in which David falls for a woman but fate rears it's ugly head and sends him on his way once again. Nice twist in the end and this proved to be Jack McGee's swansong in the original series.6. Slaves: BAD. Nice scenery, nice location, OK story and good actors on paper but all is for naught in this very lame episode. Horrible sequences and beyond bad acting performances sink this puppy. It's a credit to Bixby that he managed to keep a straight face among these actors who are not having a good day.7. A Minor Problem: Good. At least the series ended on a high note with this suspenseful and somewhat offbeat episode. Good story, eerie atmosphere in the beginning and great Hulk action ensure that the final episode is a gem for Hulk fans.I wish the series had had a proper conclusion but the TV movie ""Death of the Incredible Hulk"" at least provided some form of closure to fans. This fifth season is a no-brainer purchase for fans and if they're anything like me, they'll find that overall this is a real keeper, just as the first four seasons.The extras are solid. A nice 18 plus minute featurette with Ken Johnson and co. and a great gag reel which displays Bixby at his comical best.",3,The end is here...sadly,1226966400,"11 18, 2008",2008,2365,"['final', 'season', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'just', '7', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'were', 'actual', 'season', '5', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'due', 'writers', 'strike', 'had', 'late', 'start', 'only', '18', 'episodes', 'fifth', 'season', 'got', 'underway', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'canceled.As', 'easily', 'weakest', 'season', 'overall', '7', 'episodes', 'three', 'are', 'worthy', 'best', 'series', 'had', 'offer.1', 'Phenom', 'BAD', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'story', 'lame', 'Hulk', 'action', 'overall', 'silly', 'overtone', 'ruin', 'one.2', 'Two', 'Godmothers', 'Nothing', 'special', 'Stretches', 'credibility', 'even', 'Hulk', 'standards', 'weak', 'writing', 'lame', 'acting', 'OK', 'Hulk-out', 'middle', 'overall', 'forgettable', 'affair.3', 'Veteran', 'Pretty', 'good', 'Overall', 'suspenseful', 'episode', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'solid', 'acting', 'good', 'Hulk', 'action', 'nifty', 'flashbacks.4', 'Sanctuary', 'Solid', ""'d"", 'read', 'bad', 'reviews', 'one', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'nothing', 'special', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'did', 'find', 'odd', 'cast', 'Diana', 'Muldaur', 'previously', 'cast', 'David', 'sister', 'Season', '3', 'episode', 'Homecoming', 'head', 'nun.5', 'Triangle', 'Solid', 'OK', 'affair', 'David', 'woman', 'fate', 'rears', 'ugly', 'head', 'way', 'once', 'again', 'Nice', 'twist', 'end', 'proved', 'be', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'swansong', 'original', 'series.6', 'Slaves', 'BAD', 'Nice', 'scenery', 'nice', 'location', 'OK', 'story', 'good', 'actors', 'paper', 'naught', 'very', 'lame', 'episode', 'Horrible', 'sequences', 'bad', 'acting', 'performances', 'sink', 'puppy', 'credit', 'Bixby', 'managed', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'having', 'good', 'day.7', 'Minor', 'Problem', 'Good', 'least', 'series', 'ended', 'high', 'note', 'suspenseful', 'somewhat', 'offbeat', 'episode', 'Good', 'story', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'beginning', 'great', 'Hulk', 'action', 'ensure', 'final', 'episode', 'gem', 'Hulk', 'fans.I', 'wish', 'series', 'had', 'had', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'TV', 'movie', 'Death', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'least', 'provided', 'form', 'closure', 'fans', 'fifth', 'season', 'no-brainer', 'purchase', 'fans', ""'re"", 'anything', ""'ll"", 'find', 'overall', 'real', 'keeper', 'just', 'first', 'four', 'seasons.The', 'extras', 'are', 'solid', 'nice', '18', 'minute', 'featurette', 'Ken', 'Johnson', 'co.', 'great', 'gag', 'reel', 'Bixby', 'comical', 'best']",The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Fifth Season

1185565,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B001ECDVGS,Taheen Lopez,"[17, 36]","I'm so excited that this short-lived 1981-82 Season is finally coming out on DVD this Fall in mid October and it's about time too, especially since I've been dying to see my favorite episodes from the INCREDIBLE HULK's abbreviated 5th Season complete and uncut like they were shown originally on CBS back in the Fall of 1981 before this show was abruptly cancelled in November of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in presidency at CBS, except Universal makes each DVD commercial-free, unlike how all the episodes get shown on the Sci-Fi Channel, since Sci-Fi edites too many scenes and adds too many commercials in between to allot more time for commercials like I have previously explained in my other review on the Hulk's 4th Season and I can hardly wait to add the Hulk's 5th Season to my INCREDIBLE HULK DVD collection from the first 4 seasons.Additionally, Universal should've also had the front cover of THE INCREDIBLE HULK-Season Five DVD say ""The Final Season"", just like they did with KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4 and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 5 to inform people that those were the last seasons for those shows and that no more DVD's for those shows were going to be in the works from now on, since KNIGHT RIDER only had 4 seasons and THE A-TEAM only had 5 seasons, which is also why it would've been practical if they would've also put ""The Final Season"" in front of the cover of THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season, since THE INCREDIBLE HULK only had 5 seasons and will no longer have any more seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the works or underway after this one, since this abbreviated 1981-1982 Season was the last season of THE INCREDIBLE HULK throughout it's whole 4-year run on CBS.So now that Universal is finally about to release the INCREDIBLE HULK's final season on DVD this Fall, I'm just eagerly awaiting for Universal to release the ROCKFORD FILES Sixth Season on DVD, since that was Rockford's final season throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC, but it just so happens that Rockford's 1979-80 Season was short-lived too since NBC had abruptly cancelled the ROCKFORD FILES in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner having health issues, plus Rockford had started losing a lot of viewers thru the Dukes when the DUKES OF HAZZARD made their debut on CBS in the Winter of 1979.In addition, the Hulk's Fifth Season would've been better if they would've had the persistent overzealous newspaper reporter Jack McGee(Jack Colvin) in more 5th Season episodes, but for some reason McGee was no where to be found nor even mentioned by anyone in this season with the exception of the ""Triangle"" episode, despite the fact that McGee was always mentioned in the 1981-82 Season introduction credits as the investigative reporter from ""The National Register"" pursuing the Hulk for a murder he didn't commit along with the fact that the recluse David Banner(Bill Bixby) was still on the run and would move onto a different place at the end of each episode like he always did in the first 4 seasons, especially after David's second hulk-out.However, there have been lots of rumors and controversy behind the INCREDIBLE HULK's sudden cancellation in the mid Fall of 1981, including the rumor about creator(Ken Johnson)being blamed for never being able come up with an agreeable budget with CBS to run this show and that Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno(The Hulk)found it quite difficult to work with Johnson, which resulted in Johnson having to compromise with CBS by making THE INCREDIBLE HULK's Fifth Season only half a season instead of making it a regular full season or giving the Hulk the boot in the Summer of 1981.Rumor also has it that something else that led to this shows cancellation wasSomething else that baffles me is THE INCREDIBLE HULK episode guide indicated that CBS had unofficially announced in July of 1981 that they were cancelling this show with no plans for a 5th Season in the works, but ""The Phenom"" episode was the Season Premiere to the Hulk's Fifth Season on Friday October 2nd, 1981, which was shown a week later on CBS after showing a repeat from the Hulk's Fourth Season the previous week, which was ""The First"" episode.Unfortunately, the 1981-82 Season was cut short after only 5 episodes, since this show was cancelled abruptly after only 7 weeks during it's 5th Season run on CBS in the mid Fall of 1981, but for some reason CBS had decided to bring back this show on the air temporarily in the Spring of 1982 to finish off this abbreviated Fifth Season with 2 more episodes back in May of 1982, despite the fact that CBS still didn't have a series finale episode for this show which was very similar to when CBS had abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in the early Fall of 1979 since CBS had led us to believe that WONDER WOMAN was kicking off a 4th Season just before its sudden cancellation in mid September of 1979 when CBS had kicked off THE INCREDIBLE HULKs 3rd Season.Therefore, back in the Summer of 1979 CBS must have already had plans underway to uncerimoniously cancel WONDER WOMAN in the Autumn of 1979 just like CBS already had unofficially had plans to ax THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Autumn of 1981 while the Hulks 5th Season was already underway since there were no signs, warnings, reason, or indication on how or why CBS was giving those 2 shows the boot either, despite the fact that THE INCREDIBLE HULK outlasted WONDER WOMAN with better ratings & better special-effects.Unfortunately, CBS still didn't have a series finale episode for this show, which therefore indicated that at the end of the INCREDIBLE HULK's very last episode ""A Minor Problem"" that David and McGee still had a lot of unfinished business with the Hulk since David still obviously hadn't succeeded at finding a cure to his horrific ordeal with the creature yet with no McGee in the ""A Minor Problem"" episode on top of that.Somehow I have a feeling it would've been more practical if Universal had just added the INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season to it's 4th Season DVD, since the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fifth Season of this show was only an abreviated season that was cut short with only 7 episodes along with the fact that the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fourth Season was it's last full-season throughout it's whole 1978-82 run on CBS even though the Hulk's Fourth Season had 18 episodes in it, unlike the Second and Third Seasons, which had 22 episodes apiece.In other words, Universal probably should've combined the INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season on it's 4th Season DVD the way Universal had combined both seasons of BUCK ROGERS on the BUCK ROGERS:IN THE 25TH CENTURY DVD that was released back in November of 2004, since BUCK ROGERS 2nd Season was only an abbreviated season just like the Hulks 5th Season was only an abbreviated season, unlike BUCK ROGERS 1st Season along with the fact that the Second Season of BUCK ROGERS got a very late start, since Buck's 2nd Season was unsuccessful and didn't finally get started till the Winter of 1981, but NBC eventually ended up cancelling BUCK ROGERS in the Summer of 1981, due to a big flop in ratings.Therefore, if Universal had combined the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fifth Season episodes to the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fourth Season DVD, it would've had a total of 25 episodes on it instead of 18 episodes, but I have a feeling that Universal's reason for not combining the Hulk's 5th Season on it's 4th Season DVD was perhaps due to Universal wanting to get more money out of their customers due to all the budget cuts we've had from the recession going on right now, due to George Bush, Jr's presidency.Something else I noticed about this season was that the Hulk wore the same exact kind of blue jeans in every single episode of the Fifth Season, which the Hulk wore in just about every episode in the Fourth Season, which I suspect was to help the producers of the show economize, due to cost cutting issues from the bad economy we had back in the early 1980's, due to Reagan's presidency.Therefore, it was almost as if the 5th Season of the INCREDIBLE HULK was somewhat of an extension of the Hulk's 4th Season, since the introduction to the Hulks Fifth Season was identical to the introduction to the Hulk's Fourth Season along with the fact that the Hulk wore the same exact blue jeans in all the 5th Season episodes, except the Hulk's 5th Season wasn't as significant nor as sophisticated as the Hulk's 4th Season was, along with the fact that Jack McGee was no where to be found in this season since McGee hadn't been shown in any 5th Season episodes with the exception of the ""Triangle"" episode, which was one of the last episodes of the INCREDIBLE HULK, since ""Triangle"" was the 3rd to the last episode of this show.Therefore, I kind of started wondering what had happened to Jack McGee in the 1981-82 Season along with the fact that McGee(Jack Colvin) was always being mentioned in the credits during the introduction to the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fifth Season as the investigative reporter who has continuosly kept pursuing the Hulk convinced that the Hulk was a murderer while David(Bill Bixby) had continued searching for a cure to his horrendous infliction with the Hulk, but McGee was still no closer to capturing the Hulk or discovering that David Banner was the Hulk in the ""Triangle"" episode than he was in the first 4 seasons of the INCREDIBLE HULK either, which clearly indicated that McGee ended up failing once again and that McGee had been unsuccessful with tracking the Hulk throughout the Hulk's whole 4-year run on CBS.In addition to that, I found it quite odd how McGee was never able to make the connection and discovery that David Banner was still alive and that David Banner was the so-called ""John Doe"" who was the Hulk along with the fact that McGee came so close plenty of times to being directly face to face with David Banner on top of that before managing to keep slipping through McGee's fingers again and again leading McGee to another dead-end.In addition to why the 5th Season wasn't quite as good or as solid as the 4th Season was because the 1981-82 Season of the INCREDIBLE HULK didn't have any episodes showing clips from previous episodes or from previous seasons either, unlike the first 4 seasons of the Hulk had.Additionally, this abreviated Fifth Season didn't have any 2-parted episodes either, unlike the 4th Season and most of the other previous seasons either, which somewhat made this 1981-82 Season less interesting and perhaps made the 5th Season the weakest and least successful season of them all, especially since this show was axed all of the sudden in it's Fifth and final season without sufficient warning on top of that.This 1981-82 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when we had the recession back in 1981-1982 during Reagan's presidency and when I used to watch the INCREDIBLE HULK on CBS's Friday night-line up at 8PM followed by the DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM and then top off by DALLAS at 10PM back in the early Fall of 1981 and how the Dukes took over the 8PM time slot away from the Hulk in mid November of 1981 when this show was abruptly cancelled.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Reach For The Stars"" and when CBS had temporarily brought the INCREDIBLE HULK back on the air for 2 weeks in the Spring of 1982 on Wednesdays which conflicted with the GREATEST AMERICAN HERO 8PM time-slot on ABC, which was followed by the FALL GUY at 9PM and topped off by DYNASTY at 10PM as part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up, which reminds me that CBS's motto back then was ""Reach For The Stars"", since that was CBS's motto from the Fall of 1981 thru the Summer of 1982.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Peter Mark-Richman in the ""Triangle"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL*Bill Boyett in the ""Veteran"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12*Anne Lockhart in ""The Phenom"" episodes after previously guest starring in the ""Captive Night"" episode*Paul Koslo in the ""Veteran"" episode after previously seeing him guest star in the ""Long Run Home"" episode*Robert Donner in ""The Phenom"" episode after previously coming out in the ""Sideshow"" episode*Charles Napier in the ""Triangle"" episode after previously guest starring in ""The Slam"" episode*Dick O'Neill in ""The Phenom"" episode after previously guest starring in the ""Fast Lane"" episode*Mickey Jones in the ""Triangle"" episode after previously guest starring in the ""Long Run Home"" and ""Ricky"" episodes*Sandra Kerns in the ""Two Godmothers"" episode after previously coming out in the ""Jake"" episode and before her co-starring days on CHARLES IN CHARGE*Henry Darrow in the ""Sanctuary"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL*Bruce Gray in the ""Veteran"" episode after his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN*Brett Cullen before his co-starring days on FALCON CRESTThis INCREDIBLE HULK-Season Five DVD also has some interesting bonus features like hilarious outakes from the first 4 seasons of the INCREDIBLE HULK and also had a bonus feature with creator(Ken Johnson) and producers Jill Sherman-Donner, Karen Harris, and Bob Steinhauer describing their experience on working with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno and how it was like for them running and producing the show throughout it's whole 1978-82 run on CBS.The bonus feature on this DVD also explains to us how it was like for Ken Johnson and all the producers when CBS had decided to cancel the show all of the sudden on such short notice without Universal or any of the producers knowing the INCREDIBLE HULK was going to be axed in the Fall of 1981, even though the ratings on this show were still very good, which was why everybody including Ken Johnson were so baffled when CBS had uncermoniously announced in the Summer of 1981 that they were cancelling The INCREDIBLE HULK, even right after completing a succesful 4th Season while Johnson already had 7 episodes in the can underway for the 5th Season, but what didn't make sense to me was Ken Johnson explains that part of what led to the INCREDIBLE HULK's sudden cancellation was the president of CBS at the time(Harvey Shepherd) felt that the Hulk was getting tired, despite the fact that the ratings on this show were still pretty strong when CBS took this show off the air on such short-notice, but I totally disagree about the Hulk running out of steam in the last 2 seasons since this show obviously still had plenty of steam left in it just like the last 2 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES before its abrupt cancellation on NBC in the Winter of 1980 and as opposed to the Duke boys Bo(John Schneider)and Luke Duke(Tom Wopat)during their last 2 seasons on the DUKES OF HAZZARD before the Dukes cancellation on CBS in the Winter of 1985, due to weakening ratings.Rumor also has it that due to budget cuts, the special-effects got too expensive to keep running the show, especially since the INCREDIBLE HULK had the most expensive special-effects on TV at the time, soin order to prevent the Hulk from being cancelled from low ratings, CBS had to axe this show on such short-notice in mid season since they would have had to cut back on the special-effects by having David do only 1 Hulk-Out per episode instead of having 2 Hulk-Outs per episode or they would've had to stop showing all those magnificient special-effects with the tearing of David's clothes during the Hulk-Outs, which would've started making the shows special-effects and the Hulk's feats of strength a lot less impressive.Bob Steinhauer also explains on the bonus feature on how he felt that all Hulk fans got cheated when CBS had cancelled the INCREDIBLE HULK without sufficient warning, but because of CBS, not because of the producers, which I happen to agree with Steinhauer on, especially since this show was still very popular back then, but was summarily shuffled off all of the sudden like Ken Johnson said on the bonus feature.Therefore, you could say that the INCREDIBLE HULK's sudden cancellation was a tad smilar to the ROCKFORD FILES sudden cancellation in the middle of their last seasons since the ROCKFORD FILES was cancelled all of the sudden out of the blue in January of 1980, due to James Garner's back and knee problems along with the fact that Garner had ran out of steam, not to mention that Rockford was getting tired too, unlike the Hulk, especially since Lou Ferrigno was a lot younger than James Garner was.So now that Universal has finally released the INCREDIBLE HULK-Season 5 out on DVD and has all 5 seasons of the Hulk out on DVD, I can now hardly wait till Universal releases the ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 6 out on DVD so I can add Rockford's short-lived Sixth Season to my collection of Rockford DVD's, especially since the ROCKFORD FILES short-lived 1979-80 Season was the final season of THE ROCKFORD FILES, just like the Hulk's short-lived 1981-82 Season was the last and final season of the INCREDIBLE HULK.",5,The Season The
