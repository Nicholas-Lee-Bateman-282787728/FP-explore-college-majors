Nicholas ""gotta have a book""","[1, 2]","A decision to buy this DVD and the book that goes with got us down to the Getty in LA to see the exhibit of St. Catherine's there...and made us vow to go someday soon to that ancient place in Egypt as well as the Holy Land.  We met Fr. Justin there at the Getty and made plans to do the trip to Egypt, to come see him at St. Catherine's.  My, my.  He even let us in to the 2nd oldest library in the world, as he is the librarian.  I'm told one in a million pilgrims get that opportunity.So, be careful.  You will be inspired if you watch this video.  When I saw in the flick that Bruce Feiler set his clock there in Egypt to rise at dark thirty in time for service and in time to climb Moses Mountain for the fabled sunrise at the top.  I started working to rise early like the monks do.  It's hard but worth it to get up before dawn to work on your soul.Yes, indeed,some books and videos change the way you live and travel and spend money and dream.  This book and the matching video are such works.I'm also enjoying now the monastery of St. Catherine experience set down in another book I'm reading: Inner River by Markides.  If you are Orthodox or not, watch this Feiler documentary video.  Read his companion book, too.  Go there.  At your own risk!",5,good but pricey.

Well you can with this.The scenery is breathtaking and you will learn so much. The first 5 books of the Bible will come alive to you. It is like you are there. The guide is Jewish and the personal insights he shares are very inspiring. He teaches the history and the truth but he also shares his heart.If you want to get excited and connectd to the Old Testament this is a must.",5,Wonderful way to EXPERIENCE the Bible.,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,582,"['saw', 'parts', 'Bible', 'study', 'church', 'knew', 'wanted', 'collection.I', 'probably', 'can', 'never', 'make', 'trip', 'Holy', 'Land', 'would', 'love', 'walk', 'where', 'Abraham', 'Isaac', 'Jabob', 'Jesus', 'walked', 'Well', 'can', 'this.The', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'will', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'first', '5', 'books', 'Bible', 'will', 'come', 'alive', 'are', 'there', 'guide', 'Jewish', 'personal', 'insights', 'shares', 'are', 'very', 'inspiring', 'history', 'truth', 'also', 'shares', 'heart.If', 'want', 'get', 'excited', 'connectd', 'Old', 'Testament', 'must']",N/A

It is about a guy who travels to &#34;supposed&#34; Biblical locations which are known to be incorrect. However, what most people don't understand is how these &#34;Biblical&#34; sites were decided. These sites were created hundreds of years later by religious leaders and people connected to the emperor of Rome, not experienced archeologists like we have in the 21st century. Most of the actual Biblical sites have been found, but most people don't believe in the new sites because once you have thousands of years of tradition, it is hard to break.
