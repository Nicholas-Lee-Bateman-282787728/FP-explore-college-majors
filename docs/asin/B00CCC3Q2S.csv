Teslovich,"[0, 0]","Forceful acting and storyline centered about a young girl's crossing from Mexico into the US and the help she receives from a person who herself receives an unexpected reciprocal help. A similar strong portrayal is found in ""The Owl and the Sparrow"". As a counterpoint portrayal ""What Maisie Knew"".",5,Strong Acting,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,298,"['Forceful', 'acting', 'storyline', 'centered', 'young', 'girl', 'crossing', 'Mexico', 'US', 'help', 'person', 'who', 'unexpected', 'reciprocal', 'help', 'similar', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'found', 'Owl', 'Sparrow', 'counterpoint', 'portrayal', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knew']",The Girl
1645896,A3C5ZZQ143WG6T,B00CCC3Q2S,Jenifer M,"[6, 6]","This is a sensitive tale of a woman down on her luck.  She ends up trying to be a coyote and ferry people across the border.  A young mother dies.  Rather than abandon the woman's child, she travels deep into Mexico to return the daughter to her maternal grandmother.  The woman seeks forgiveness and receives it.  This is a very touching tale of maturation, love and discovery.  Abbie Cornish was fantastic.  This is a movie I highly recommend, especially for young women and girls, or anyone who also has a daughter.

One of  women drowns in the river crossing leaving her small daughter with no one to care for her but the American..  Abbie Cornish is very good as the American girl and an absolutely adorable little actress plays the Mexican girl.  It's a simple story but beautifully told....well worth watching.,5,Heartwarming tale on the Tex-Mex border,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,440,"['well', 'done', 'film', 'poor', 'white', 'girl', 'who', 'Texas-Mexico', 'border', 'who', 'involved', 'transporting', 'Mexicans', 'US', 'One', 'women', 'drowns', 'river', 'crossing', 'leaving', 'small', 'daughter', 'one', 'care', 'American..', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'very', 'good', 'American', 'girl', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'little', 'actress', 'Mexican', 'girl', 'simple', 'story', 'beautifully', 'told', '.well', 'watching']",The Girl

It looks like she is a big star in Australia with many films to her credit.  I picked one out but the story was very ordinary and slow.  Periods where she just stands in one place and looks around.  I was disappointed.,3,"I didn't know who Abbie Cornish was until I saw ""Summersault""",1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,293,"['was', 'so', 'perfect', 'part', 'went', 'looking', 'other', 'films', 'big', 'star', 'Australia', 'many', 'films', 'credit', 'picked', 'one', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'ordinary', 'slow', 'Periods', 'where', 'just', 'one', 'place', 'was', 'disappointed']",The Girl

She has a low paying job supporting herself while living in a trailer. On a trip to Mexico with her dad (Will Patton) she discovers he is making good money transporting people across the border. Ashley has a plan to make a big score doing the same thing, but things don't pan out. She ends up reluctantly caring for a young girl (Maritza Santiago Hernandez) whose mother was apparently killed in the crossing Ashley orchestrated.The film is well acted. It is heart warming and gritty at times. It is a tale that is more about character than plot.
