I found it to be a little slow and at times drawn out with a predictable plot. The humor was great, and the actors (especially Kevin Whately) absolutely made the story entertaining. I enjoyed the dilemma of the ex wife and the tantalizing relationship with other woman (Gabby) quite entertaining as a prevalent background in all episodes. Overall four and a half stars.

1677818,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00GD7UMDO,DVD Verdict,"[18, 20]","After leaving the police force, Jimmy Griffin (Kevin Whately) is forced to scramble for a job to provide support for his ex-wife Sally (Annette Ekblom, Fever Pitch) and their kids. Jimmy and his private investigation team&#8212;Vinnie (show scripter Al Ashton, A Fish Called Wanda) and Harriet (Sarah-Jane Potts, Kinky Boots)&#8212;start investigating claims for a local insurance firm, which puts him in back in contact with Gabby (Michelle Fairley, Game of Thrones), whose affair with Jimmy broke up the man's marriage. Acting as an insurance investigator, Jimmy soon learns, has quite a bit of overlap with to the life of a cop in the danger department.The Broker's Man originally aired its episodes in two 50-minute blocks. Series 1 assembles the episodes into three movie-length wholes:&#34;Double Dutch&#34; (96 minutes)&#8212;When Dutch criminals steal a ton of digital audio tapes from a warehouse, Jimmy is hired to investigate insurance fraud. Betrayal and murder soon follow.&#34;Dangerous Bends&#34; (94 minutes)&#8212;Jimmy investigates the circumstances surround a deadly accident, which leads to the world of illegal dirtbike racing. He enlists his team to help figure out if the claims against a water treatment plant have any merit.&#34;Siege&#34; (96 minutes)&#8212;During a getaway designed to mend the soured relationship to his family, Jimmy struggles to stop a ring of car thieves and a deranged veteran of the Falklands War.The notion of insurance investigators taking on mysteries is a novel enough idea, especially with a likeable actor like Kevin Whately in the lead. But it only took about twenty minutes for me to realize that, despite the good stuff going for it, The Broker's Man was really just a boring procedural in a different package.In each of the three episodes, Jimmy Griffin and his team get hired to look into possibly fraudulent insurance claims that quickly dissolve into chase scenes or gunplay. Good think Jimmy is an ex-cop. The episodes usually find a way to tie all of the cases together and wrap them up neatly, too. Some of the plotting is deft&#8212;the subplot in &#34;Dangerous Bends&#34; involving water contamination, for instance, unfolded quite nicely (and fit the show's premise to boot). But otherwise, The Broker's Man suffers greatly when it plods along and takes the most obvious route possible to get somewhere.Jimmy is surrounded by supporting characters with no depth, from his vanilla team to the one-note insurance company people who serve as this show's police commander. Even Michelle Fairley's Gabby does do much besides pine after Jimmy and make a few flirtatious remarks per scene. The Griffin family fairs a bit better, thankfully, and the drama surrounding Jimmy and Sally's marriage is maybe more captivating than the actual mystery stuff. (Though the number of awkward comic moments the show tries to wring out of Jimmy's old affair with Gabby is cringe-worthy.) It helps that Whately has such a friendly and genial presence on the screen, and he has enough dorky charisma to wipe away some of the show's sins. Only some.Acorn Media's two-disc set of The Broker's Man: Series 1 is as threadbare as it gets. The 1.55:1 letterbox presentation is subpar&#8212;the picture quality is anything but sharp, with several nighttime scenes looking especially bad. (Worth noting: the picture is windowboxed on HD televisions.) The Dolby Digital stereo track fares betters with a quite average sound quality, though the super sexy saxophone music that dominates the score tends to drown out some of the softer dialogue from time to time.

It works as believable.Cast is led by Jimmy (Kevin Whately -Inspector LEWIS; Insp Morse).

1677827,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00GD7UMDO,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","In THE BROKER'S MAN, Series One, (1997-98), a British television series, the likeable actor Kevin Whately (INSPECTOR MORSE, INSPECTOR LEWIS), stars in the title role, as Jimmy Griffin.  This British mystery/ crime drama presents the actor as an ex-cop, (well, did you ever), turned insurance investigator.  He's still relying on his bag of tricks from his years on the job: cunning and insight, an ability to think on his feet, the ability to remain cool under fire.  So, no wonder he always succeeds in this winning TV series. This boxed DVD set of two discs features three feature length mysteries and runs approximately 288 minutes.  There is a modest amount of coarse language and nudity. And thank goodness, and more to the point, thank you RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, it's got subtitles, as these transatlantic ears and eyes guess it's set and filmed in the British Midlands.A strong cast of actors plays some compelling characters in this entertainment.  Annette Ekbom, (HOLBY CITY), plays Sally, Griffin's estranged wife.  She has divorced him, as he was having an affair with his co-worker Gabby Rodwell, played by Michelle Fairley, the beloved Caitlin Stark of GAME OF THRONES.  Unfortunately, even as Griffin is struggling to rebuild his family and keep them safe from the perils his work engenders, he's still flirting with all the pretty girls.  Other well-known guest stars include Al Hunter Ashton, (LONDON'S BURNING)who co-wrote the script; PETER FIRTH, (MI-5); Sarah Jane Potts, (FELICITY); John McEnery, (GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING), and Shirley Stelfox, the first Rose in the beloved Britcom KEEPING UP APPEARANCES.  Michael Cochrane and David Robb, two Downton Abbey actors, also guest star.  And I'd swear I saw the hunky Idris Elba, (LUTHER) in an uncredited, but named, small speaking part.The episodes are:Double Dutch.  A shipping container holding  millions in digital audio tapes is stolen by a murderous Dutch crime ring, and Griffin's on the case to investigate possible insurance fraud.  He finds across the North Sea, entangled with the violent crime ring.Dangerous Bends.  An accident on a village road.  Motorcycle and car collide.  The car's driver is killed.  The guilty motorcyclist limps away from the scene; Jimmy gets involved in the world of illegal dirt bike racing.  The investigator's looking into the hit-run, but must also take on a lucrative water treatment malfunction case.  Not easy juggling the two.Siege.  As Jimmy is finally able to start repairing his relationships with Sally and his children, he takes them on a modest family vacation.  But a small firearms theft falls in his lap, despite his best efforts to enjoy a real holiday with his reuniting family.  He's trying to keep it secret from Sally.  Hard to do as the man at the center of the case, a veteran of the brief Falkland Islands war, is dangerous and volatile.We found the first two episodes to be the strongest and most engrossing.  However, no matter how you cut it, this is an enjoyable show that mixes crime with humor, and manages to come up with a new twist on the ever popular British police procedural.  It's carried ably by the popular Whately and its strong cast.
