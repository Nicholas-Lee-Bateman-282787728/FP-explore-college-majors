The darkness is all framed by the whiteness of a Norwegian winter, so that one is compelled to wonder whether Winter isn't the protagonist. The snowplow driver Kai, who becomes both the murder suspect and the lover in this film, says jokingly ""Gud er en god fyr -- God is a good guy"", but Victoria, the Oslo doctor who has fled to the back country of Norway to escape her 'sorg' and 'skyldflelse' (guilt), thinks otherwise. ""God is simply mean,"" she says, though what she really thinks is that Life is mean. This is, on some level, a film about being Norwegian (or Swedish) and therefore kissed by 'sorg' and 'skyldflelse'. Are 'bleak and 'beautiful' compatible adjectives? They'd better be, if you want to appreciate this film.Victoria is played by Annika Hallin, whose face is wonderfully bleak and beautiful. It's the acting that makes this movie poignant. Kristoffer Joner, in the role of Kai, is beautifully boyish and bleakly needy - a man whose wife has deserted him in the back country and taken his daughter to the city. The cinematography is beautiful; well of course! it's a Scandinavian flick, though neither as introverted nor as subtle as a classic Ingmar Bergman drama of bleak passion. Indeed, the whole film is well crafted, edited, acted, scripted. It falls short of five-star artistry only in one odd implausibility. The doctor mother fails to detect her son's leukemia; she misreads his lethargy as a moral weakness, a failure of energy for life. She drags him from his TV and his couch, with tragic results. Yeah yeah, it's in the script, it's the motivation for her flight to the snowfields, but I didn't 'buy' it and neither did my wife when we watched it together.There's also a sub plot. The young man who is found frozen in the snow, whose death is blamed on Kai, is a Muslim refugee, living with his parents in a camp for refugees. The portrayals of the his Muslim parents is credible and not unsympathetic. The Norwegians of the countryside are likewise not unsympathetic -- bleakly generous, you might say -- but it's quite obvious that the refugees have no actuality for them. They are not people of the winter whiteness. Despite the recent anti-Muslim terrorist murder spree in Norway, this depiction of the bleak reserve between Norwegians (and Swedes)  -- the dutiful tolerance on one side and the grudging dependence on the other -- seems to me to be precisely realistic.",4,"Grief is ""Sorg"" in Norwegian ...",1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2503,"['Norwegian', 'film', 'sorg', 'appreciator', 'dark', 'films', 'could', 'ask', 'darkness', 'framed', 'whiteness', 'Norwegian', 'winter', 'one', 'compelled', 'wonder', 'Winter', ""n't"", 'protagonist', 'snowplow', 'driver', 'Kai', 'who', 'murder', 'suspect', 'lover', 'film', 'jokingly', 'Gud', 'er', 'god', 'fyr', 'God', 'good', 'guy', 'Victoria', 'Oslo', 'doctor', 'who', 'fled', 'back', 'country', 'Norway', 'escape', ""'sorg"", ""'skyldflelse"", 'guilt', 'otherwise', 'God', 'simply', 'mean', 'what', 'really', 'Life', 'mean', 'level', 'film', 'being', 'Norwegian', 'Swedish', 'therefore', 'kissed', ""'sorg"", ""'skyldflelse"", 'Are', ""'beautiful"", 'compatible', 'adjectives', ""'d"", 'better', 'be', 'want', 'appreciate', 'film.Victoria', 'played', 'Annika', 'Hallin', 'face', 'wonderfully', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'movie', 'poignant', 'Kristoffer', 'Joner', 'role', 'Kai', 'beautifully', 'boyish', 'bleakly', 'needy', 'man', 'wife', 'deserted', 'back', 'country', 'taken', 'daughter', 'city', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'well', 'course', 'Scandinavian', 'flick', 'though', 'introverted', 'as', 'subtle', 'classic', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'drama', 'bleak', 'passion', 'Indeed', 'whole', 'film', 'well', 'crafted', 'edited', 'acted', 'scripted', 'short', 'five-star', 'artistry', 'only', 'one', 'odd', 'implausibility', 'doctor', 'mother', 'detect', 'son', 'leukemia', 'lethargy', 'moral', 'weakness', 'failure', 'energy', 'life', 'drags', 'TV', 'couch', 'tragic', 'results', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'script', 'motivation', 'flight', 'snowfields', 'did', ""n't"", ""'buy"", 'neither', 'did', 'wife', 'when', 'watched', 'also', 'sub', 'plot', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'frozen', 'snow', 'death', 'blamed', 'Kai', 'Muslim', 'refugee', 'living', 'parents', 'camp', 'refugees', 'portrayals', 'Muslim', 'parents', 'credible', 'not', 'unsympathetic', 'Norwegians', 'countryside', 'are', 'likewise', 'not', 'unsympathetic', 'bleakly', 'generous', 'might', 'say', 'quite', 'obvious', 'refugees', 'have', 'actuality', 'are', 'not', 'people', 'winter', 'whiteness', 'recent', 'anti-Muslim', 'terrorist', 'murder', 'spree', 'Norway', 'depiction', 'bleak', 'reserve', 'Norwegians', 'Swedes', 'dutiful', 'tolerance', 'one', 'side', 'grudging', 'dependence', 'other', 'be', 'precisely', 'realistic']",N/A

So, this is my wholehearted endorsement of this gem - to hopefully draw attention to the pleasures this film offers.The Scandinavian setting was a definite attraction.  The plot is unique and interesting.  However, the lead actress is what makes the film.  The film is otherwise well-cast, with cast members who are refreshingly new.  Indeed, the entire film is refreshing - as being NON-Hollywood.The lead actress's performance is fascinating, captivating.  I was spellbound by her.  This actress's expressions often seemed so stern and inscrutable, yet she has a smile that could melt the North Pole.I discovered this film by accident, in an idle moment, when I searched AMAZON.com for Scandinavian films of interest.

1115622,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000XXWE3A,Paul Allaer,"[27, 27]","I happened to pick this movie up the other day at the foreign movie section of my local public library here in Blue Ash, OH. I really didn't know anything about this movie, but looked at the box and was intruiged. Am I glad I picked this up!""Kissed By Winter"" (80 min.; originally released in 2008 in Norway) brings several concurrent story lines: the first one is that a body of a teenage boy is found in the snow, and it's left up to the local police to figure out what happened (and who might be responsible for it). The teenager is from a Muslim family living in Norway. The second story line is of a local female doctor Victoria, who makes the rounds visiting patients in the country side and at the local hospital. She gets involved with a guy, Kai, responsible for clearing the roads of snow and who is a suspect in the death of the teenager. But wait, there is more! As the movie goes on, it becomes apparent Victoria carries a heavy secret. I don't want to say much more about the story line, you'll just have to see it for yourself.The movie plays beautifully and really comes together in the last half hour, when all is revealed. Just great. In all, yet another great foreign movie I've enjoyed tremendously. It puts the mainstream Hollywood movies to shame, frankly, as it seems that Hollywood can do no better than to come up with the next Iron Man or Pirates of the Carribean sequel.
