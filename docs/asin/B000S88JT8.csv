It seems as though the town picks anyone and labels them a criminal just to fine them to keep the taxes low,  if an outsider is speeding the sheriff does not follow procedure he just runs them off the road  takes the cars and puts them in a salvage yard for more money for the town.when the kid arrives he becomes aware of this prepare for the final showdown with the corrupt sheriff.  the movie is somewhat slow pace but is very entertaining with some great chases and great scenes  of the 70's landscape.the strangest thing is that martin sheen is a kid in a nice car looking for revenge while years later his son charle sheen  is in a movie the wraith  who he plays a kid who was murdered but comes back with a mysterious car that can do amazing things all in the name of revenge.  I guess great cars, and revenges runs in the family.Oh yes there is a very young nick nolte  as the mechanic that collects the wrecked cars for profit.",3,the califonia kid,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1211,"['was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'got', 'go', 'other', 'fast', 'car', 'movies', 'basically', 'martin', 'sheen', 'California', 'kid', 'driving', 'fantastic', 'coupe', 'small', 'speed', 'trap', 'town', 'search', 'sheriff', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'town', 'anyone', 'labels', 'criminal', 'just', 'fine', 'keep', 'taxes', 'low', 'outsider', 'speeding', 'sheriff', 'not', 'follow', 'procedure', 'just', 'runs', 'off', 'road', 'cars', 'salvage', 'yard', 'more', 'money', 'town.when', 'kid', 'aware', 'prepare', 'final', 'showdown', 'corrupt', 'sheriff', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'pace', 'very', 'entertaining', 'great', 'chases', 'great', 'scenes', '70', 'landscape.the', 'strangest', 'thing', 'martin', 'sheen', 'kid', 'nice', 'car', 'looking', 'revenge', 'years', 'later', 'son', 'charle', 'sheen', 'movie', 'wraith', 'who', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'back', 'mysterious', 'car', 'can', 'do', 'amazing', 'things', 'name', 'revenge', 'guess', 'great', 'cars', 'revenges', 'runs', 'family.Oh', 'yes', 'very', 'young', 'nick', 'nolte', 'mechanic', 'wrecked', 'cars', 'profit']",The California Kid
