We purchased this movie for our toddlers and they love it.The tunes ""Joke-A-Lot Anthem"" and ""Here I'm A King"" are great.  My daughter and I love to dance along in our living room.The story centers on themes of fitting in, knowing where you belong and home, may be over the head of younger kids.You may see some reviewers not liking the fact that the movie is not all syrupy and sweet, but then again neither is life or the world.  Plus..., it's just a movie after all.Recommended.Cheers!",5,"Whether you love or hate this new take on Care Bears, I hope you will still enjoy this film.",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,569,"['are', 'looking', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'kids', 'one', 'keeper', 'purchased', 'movie', 'toddlers', 'love', 'it.The', 'tunes', 'Joke-A-Lot', 'Anthem', 'Here', ""'m"", 'King', 'are', 'great', 'daughter', 'love', 'dance', 'along', 'living', 'room.The', 'story', 'centers', 'themes', 'fitting', 'knowing', 'where', 'belong', 'home', 'may', 'be', 'head', 'younger', 'kids.You', 'may', 'see', 'reviewers', 'not', 'liking', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'syrupy', 'sweet', 'then', 'again', 'life', 'world', 'just', 'movie', 'all.Recommended.Cheers']",N/A

The eldest loved the Big Wish Movie, and when I showed her this one at Target she begged me to buy it. Funshine Bear is one of her favorites so I agreed. Every other day she has to watch watch Wish Bear or Funshine Bear. I know some people have spoke about their children getting scared, but my nieces just sit and hum along with the songs.

We have an old care bears DVD that we've watched over and over since she was 2 months old (she's a year and a half now). And at the end of the old DVD it shows the previews for this Care Bear movie, Journey to Joke a Lot, and she always HAS to watch the preview at the end too. So we decided to buy it for her. The illustration is amazing! I love the look of the care bears, still seems original in style. My daughter loves the sing along extras on the DVD as well! It was delivered to our home very quickly and in excellent condition! We are very pleased with aokmovies2's prompt service. And we will continue to order from amazon.com! I highly recommend this movie for all care bear lovers out there!",5,Care a lot about the care bears!,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,738,"['daughter', 'LOVES', 'Care', 'Bears', 'have', 'old', 'care', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'was', '2', 'months', 'old', 'year', 'half', 'now', 'end', 'old', 'DVD', 'previews', 'Care', 'Bear', 'movie', 'Journey', 'Joke', 'Lot', 'always', 'HAS', 'watch', 'preview', 'end', 'too', 'decided', 'buy', 'illustration', 'amazing', 'love', 'look', 'care', 'bears', 'still', 'original', 'style', 'daughter', 'sing', 'extras', 'DVD', 'well', 'was', 'delivered', 'home', 'very', 'quickly', 'excellent', 'condition', 'are', 'very', 'pleased', 'aokmovies2', 'prompt', 'service', 'will', 'continue', 'order', 'amazon.com', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'care', 'lovers', 'there']",N/A
833542,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0002HODV8,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[10, 15]","The events of ""Journey To Joke-A-Lot"" start off because of a simple misunderstanding. It's the type of thing that could be resolved with some listening and a simple apology. In the heat of the moment, though, Funshine Bear gets the idea that his jokes are a problem in Care-A-Lot and decides to try to find someplace where his humor will be appreciated. He ends up taking a wild journey to Joke-A-Lot where he's crowned as a king. As he debates whether he should stay or return to his friends, a group of them is making their way to bring him back. What none of them realize is that they're all being conned by a villain named Funnybone.The writing and music on this movie are both top-notch. The Care Bears look great to me and don't appear as scary or evil at all. The Joke-A-Lot characters are a bit odd-looking, but not overly so, and they are supposed to be strangely funny. The songs in this movie are wonderful. Although some of the lyrics are repeated quite a bit, both the tunes and words are so catchy that it's not a bother at all. Funshine ""shines"" (to make a bad pun) in two great solo songs. There's even a couple hilarious pop-culture references in this movie for any parents or other adults (or informed kids) that might be watching.The cast and crew for this movie are many of the best of Nelvana. If you or your kids enjoy shows such as ""Franklin"" or ""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends,"" then you'll probably enjoy this film. Julie Lemieux, who is fast becoming a top voice talent, provides the voice of Funshine Bear and there are several other great voice talents. Ray Parker, Tom Szczesniak (""Franklin's Magic Christmas"") and many other fine musicians provide the movie's great songs and music.What really sends the DVD production over the top is the great special features. This is the type of fare that often isn't found  on a direct-to-video production, especially one targeted at this age group. The special features are deleted scenes, sing-alongs, DVD-ROM bonuses and trailers. The deleted scenes are definitely the best special feature. These are scenes not included in the main film, nor aired in the version shown on Disney and YTV. They include an introduction from the director that encourages viewers to try and guess where in the film the deleted scenes would have been included. Most are in storyboard form, but a few are in incomplete CGI and one is fully done. The sing-alongs are two songs from the movie, both with vocals and without. The trailers are both a teaser and full trailer for the film itself, as well as one for ""Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy.""If you or your kids are fans of the Care Bears, I'd say this is a must-watch. Even if you've never liked the Care Bears before, this is still definitely a film very much worth watching.",5,"Tastefully Done Production, Not Seeing any Problem",1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,2786,"['events', 'Journey', 'Joke-A-Lot', 'start', 'simple', 'misunderstanding', 'type', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'listening', 'simple', 'apology', 'heat', 'moment', 'though', 'Funshine', 'Bear', 'idea', 'jokes', 'are', 'problem', 'Care-A-Lot', 'decides', 'try', 'find', 'someplace', 'where', 'humor', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'up', 'taking', 'wild', 'journey', 'Joke-A-Lot', 'where', 'crowned', 'king', 'should', 'stay', 'return', 'friends', 'group', 'making', 'way', 'bring', 'back', 'What', 'none', 'realize', ""'re"", 'being', 'conned', 'villain', 'named', 'Funnybone.The', 'writing', 'music', 'movie', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Care', 'Bears', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'scary', 'evil', 'Joke-A-Lot', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'odd-looking', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'strangely', 'funny', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderful', 'lyrics', 'are', 'repeated', 'quite', 'bit', 'tunes', 'words', 'are', 'so', 'catchy', 'not', 'bother', 'Funshine', 'shines', 'make', 'bad', 'pun', 'two', 'great', 'solo', 'songs', 'even', 'couple', 'hilarious', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'movie', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'informed', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'watching.The', 'cast', 'crew', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'best', 'Nelvana', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'such', 'Franklin', 'Miss', 'Spider', 'Sunny', 'Patch', 'Friends', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Julie', 'Lemieux', 'who', 'fast', 'becoming', 'top', 'voice', 'talent', 'voice', 'Funshine', 'Bear', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'great', 'voice', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Parker', 'Tom', 'Szczesniak', 'Franklin', 'Magic', 'Christmas', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'musicians', 'provide', 'movie', 'great', 'songs', 'really', 'DVD', 'production', 'top', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'type', 'fare', 'often', ""n't"", 'found', 'direct-to-video', 'production', 'especially', 'one', 'targeted', 'age', 'group', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sing-alongs', 'DVD-ROM', 'bonuses', 'trailers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'best', 'special', 'feature', 'are', 'scenes', 'not', 'included', 'main', 'film', 'aired', 'version', 'shown', 'Disney', 'YTV', 'include', 'introduction', 'director', 'viewers', 'try', 'guess', 'where', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Most', 'are', 'storyboard', 'form', 'few', 'are', 'incomplete', 'CGI', 'one', 'fully', 'done', 'sing-alongs', 'are', 'two', 'songs', 'movie', 'vocals', 'trailers', 'are', 'teaser', 'full', 'trailer', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Popeye', 'Voyage', 'Quest', 'Pappy', 'kids', 'are', 'fans', 'Care', 'Bears', ""'d"", 'say', 'must-watch', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Care', 'Bears', 'before', 'still', 'definitely', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
