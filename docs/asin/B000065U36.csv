700152,A2ZF78RQCO57FU,B000065U36,Alec  Malczynski,"[2, 2]","First and foremost, I'm from Huntington Beach, central Orange County, California. I thought this movie was very funny, but somewhat stereotypical to the Southern Californian culture; no, we aren't all surfers, ... cheerleaders (well, at my High School there is) and pot-heads...okay, maybe there are, but that still gives much needed formula for the director's purpose for mocking the Orange County lifestyle. What bugged me the most was how only about 22% of the movie was actually filmed in Orange County, while the rest of it was filmed in either upstate Bakersfield, or Los Angeles. But the story actually lightens up to the style, while riding on the backs of tongue-in-cheek comedy.Shaun Brunder (Colin Hanks, Tom Hanks' son) once was a stereptypical so-cal surfer at first, merely ditching class and catching waves at the beach. Then, his best friend drowns in a surfing accident (involving some hilarious footage from ""The Perfect Storm""). Shaun, depressed after his friend's death, morns on the beach, only to find a copy of ""Straight-Jacket"", a Psychological novel, buried in the sand. He starts to read it. After a while, he becomes attached to the novel, to a point where he decides his life goal...being a writer. Of course, his background isn't exactly ""writers"" materal, especially living with a alcholic and emotionally disturbed mother (Catherine O'Hara), his doped-up and drug addict brother (Jack Black, in one of his funniest roles to date) and his rich and anal-retentive divorced father (John Lithgow). His school is a total wasteland of any intelligence, from dirty cheerleaders, to idiotic pot-head friends. Even the teachers are showing no sign of intelligence, especially one funny scene where the Principal (Chevy Chase) and the school committee discuss what they want to have speak for their graudation, in which the principal idiotically blurts out ""Hey Dana, didn't you say you have have a cousin that's friends with Britney Spears???"". The only person that is influencing Shaun to go to college is his sweet girlfriend, Ashley (Schuyler Fisk, Sissy Spacek's daughter). Shaun decides to go to Stanford, but his dumb guidence counseler (cameoed by the funny Lily Tomlin) sends the wrong transcipt to their campus, ultimately putting the option of going to Stanford out of the question. But, there is a solution...it Shaun can influence the dean of Stanford (Harold Ramis) to look at his ""real"" transcipt, he might just get in to next year's roll. But this would mean in order to leave Orange County behind in order to pursue his dream.""Orange County"" is nevertheless, little-hearted comedy. Complete with a nice so-cal soundtrack and a good list of cameos (Ben Stiller as a fire-fighter, Kevin Kline as Shaun's idol author, Chevy Chase as the Principal, etc.), ""OC"" is a great movie...full of stereotypes that you can laugh at with dignity.",4,"Love, School, College...and surfing?",1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,2869,"['First', 'foremost', ""'m"", 'Huntington', 'Beach', 'central', 'Orange', 'County', 'California', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'Southern', 'Californian', 'culture', 'are', ""n't"", 'surfers', 'cheerleaders', 'well', 'High', 'School', 'pot-heads', 'okay', 'maybe', 'are', 'still', 'much', 'needed', 'formula', 'director', 'purpose', 'mocking', 'Orange', 'County', 'lifestyle', 'What', 'bugged', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'only', 'about', '22', '%', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Orange', 'County', 'rest', 'was', 'filmed', 'upstate', 'Bakersfield', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'story', 'actually', 'style', 'riding', 'backs', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'comedy.Shaun', 'Brunder', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'son', 'once', 'was', 'stereptypical', 'so-cal', 'surfer', 'first', 'merely', 'ditching', 'class', 'catching', 'waves', 'beach', 'Then', 'best', 'friend', 'drowns', 'surfing', 'accident', 'involving', 'hilarious', 'footage', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Shaun', 'depressed', 'friend', 'death', 'morns', 'beach', 'only', 'find', 'copy', 'Straight-Jacket', 'Psychological', 'novel', 'buried', 'sand', 'read', 'while', 'attached', 'novel', 'point', 'where', 'life', 'goal', 'being', 'writer', 'course', 'background', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'writers', 'materal', 'especially', 'living', 'alcholic', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'mother', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'doped-up', 'drug', 'addict', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Black', 'one', 'funniest', 'roles', 'date', 'rich', 'anal-retentive', 'divorced', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'school', 'total', 'wasteland', 'intelligence', 'dirty', 'cheerleaders', 'idiotic', 'pot-head', 'friends', 'Even', 'teachers', 'are', 'showing', 'sign', 'intelligence', 'especially', 'one', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Principal', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'school', 'committee', 'discuss', 'what', 'want', 'have', 'speak', 'graudation', 'principal', 'idiotically', 'out', 'Hey', 'Dana', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'have', 'cousin', 'friends', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'only', 'person', 'influencing', 'Shaun', 'go', 'college', 'sweet', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'daughter', 'Shaun', 'go', 'Stanford', 'dumb', 'guidence', 'counseler', 'cameoed', 'funny', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'wrong', 'transcipt', 'campus', 'ultimately', 'putting', 'option', 'going', 'Stanford', 'question', 'solution', 'Shaun', 'can', 'influence', 'dean', 'Stanford', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'look', 'real', 'transcipt', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'next', 'year', 'roll', 'would', 'mean', 'order', 'leave', 'Orange', 'County', 'order', 'pursue', 'dream', 'Orange', 'County', 'nevertheless', 'little-hearted', 'comedy', 'Complete', 'nice', 'so-cal', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'list', 'cameos', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'fire-fighter', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Shaun', 'idol', 'author', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Principal', 'etc', 'OC', 'great', 'movie', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'laugh', 'dignity']",N/A

During my stay, I had the good fortune to be invited to another private test screening of a movie that I was told starred Jack Black. That was enough for me. I've been a fan of the D (for those of you not familiar with the brilliantly obscene rock duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gas, they are Tenacious D) for long enough, and was there (three times in theaters) for his fantastic performance in High Fidelity, so I was at this screening in a second. I had no idea that Tom Hanks had a son, that he was an actor, or that he was in this movie, until months later when I saw the hype around it through trailers, etc. Nothing like his father, but equally magnetic onscreen, I look forward to more of his movies in the future. Hollywood or no Hollywood, this movie rocked! It was extremely humorous, and the audience response was so great that no one seemed to need a follow-up form of our feelings towards the movie. They saw our reaction as their success.

700160,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000065U36,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Orange County is about a guy from Orange County who wants to be a writer. He feels stifled by the O.C., but if he could only get into Stanford then things would change. Everyone in Orange County is an idiot except him, it seems (sorry Orange County, I don't mean to disparage your intelligence. That is just what I gather from this movie. Besides, I'm the last one to talk, since I am in Bakersfield). In some ways it is like Finding Forrester, but not nearly as good. It is a light comedy with Shaun Brumder's (Colin Hanks) quest for Stanford and a writing career functioning more as an excuse for zany antics and slapstick.Colin Hanks is the son of actor Tom Hanks. He doesn't do so badly, but it is hard not to compare him to his father. His girlfriend Ashley is played by Schuyler Fisk, who is the daughter of Sissy Spacek. She is a cute red head, and she looks a lot like her mother. Both Colin and Schuyler (pronounced Skyler) were perfectly adequate, and let's give them a chance to carve out their own identities.In a film about someone wanting to write, I am always curious about who wrote the film. Is it autobiographical? I think that clearly it is, as it was written by Mike White who could very well be from Orange County, or at least Southern California. He wrote a few episodes of Freaks and Geeks, and also a lot of his projects involve the talents of Jack Black. Funny how the two are like opposites, Black and White, yet they work together so much. As well as Orange County, Mike White also wrote scripts for The School of Rock and Nacho Libre.Mike White acts, too, but mostly kind of nerdy character roles like Ned Schneebly in The School of Rock, or in this film, he plays high school English teacher, Mr. Burke.Mr. Burke: Now, when I say ""Romeo and Juliet,"" who comes to mind?Dana: Claire Danes?Mr. Burke: That's right, Claire Danes. Who else?Chad: Leonardo DiCaprio.Mr. Burke: Right. Who else? Well, you know someone else was involved in that movie who in some ways is as famous as Leonardo Di Caprio. And his name is William Shakespeare. And some great movies have been made based on his plays: Hamlet, West Side Story, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Waterworld, Gladiator, Chocolat...As you can see, Shaun really does need to escape the idiots in Orange County. Mr. Burke likes Shaun's story, though.Mr. Burke: Shaun! I read your story. You used a lot of big words. Great! Good for you! It was a little long, so I didn't read the whole thing, but who cares 'cause I gave you an A!Catherine O'Hara was good as Shaun's mother, Cindy Beugler. She played a lush housewife very well, a little too well so I wondered if it was merely acting? She is from Second City TV, and was in Best of Show and A Mighty Wind.Jack Black has a few scenes where he really steals the show. At first his Lance Brumder is just a drug addled loser, the kind of role Jack could play in his sleep with one hand tied behind his back. Is he just going to phone it in? But then when they take a road trip to Stanford, the old Black magic is back. He breaks into the Admissions office and when he gets caught, he attempts to seduce the secretary. Hilarity ensues.Kevin Kline plays the professor and writer that Shaun wants to go to Stanford to study with. There is a scene where he finally does get to meet him and he gets some advice and a critique of his story. Life is not always Black and White, and sometimes there are various shades of Orange County involved. The only thing is, the last bit of advice he gives could apply to the movie that we are watching just as well: The story needs a better ending.Jack Black Rules!!!!!King Kong (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

700161,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B000065U36,"""chick_flick""","[3, 3]","""Orange County"" has a star-studded cast esemble, a great script, and a comical story.PLOT SUMMARY: In ""Orange County"", Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks--yes, TOM HANKS'S son), has an easy life in Orange County, California. Shaun spends most of his days surfing with his three best buds who enjoy getting wasted and catching the highest waves possible. When one of his friends suddenly dies while surfing in a freak storm, Shaun realizes that life is short...especially after he finds a book in the beach sand, written by the famous Stanford University professor, Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline). This leads Shaun into wanting to become a writer, and wanting to attend Stanford University, so he could take one of Skinner's classes. However, the only problem is that Shaun's dysfunctional family doesn't want him to go to Stanford. His mom, Cindy Beugler (Catherine O'Hera), who got remarried to an old man, Bob Beugler (George Murdock), wants him to go to a college that's closer to home. His filthy rich dad, Bud Brumder (John Lithgow), who got remarried to a very unfaithful younger woman, claims Shaun doesn't need to become a writer and that being an author doesn't ""get you rich"". So this leaves Shaun to take matters into his own hands. Shaun applies to Stanford, anyway. When his school councelor sends the wrong transcript and application to Stanford, Shaun gets rejected. Shaun can't accept this, so when his wasted older brother, Lance Brumder (Jack Black), suggests they take a road trip to the school to try to prove to the school that he is Stanford material, Shaun takes this suggestion seriously. So Lance ends up driving Shaun and Shaun's girlfriend, Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), on a hilarious road trip to Stanford, so that Shaun can hopefully get accepted into the school...and Shaun will do whatever it takes, unkowningly that his family and friends want him to stay home, because they care about him.OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Orange County"" was extremely hilarious, original, and clever. It has got a fantastic script and some excellent performances by the entire cast. Colin Hanks is convincing and appealing in his role...he definitely looks like a younger version of Tom. But Jack Black steals the show. The film is fast-paced, and just plain funny. The DVD is nicely packaged, with some deleted scenes, commentaries, and more.I highly recommend ""Orange County"".Score:98/100A+",5,A teen comedy which will actually make you LAUGH!,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,2389,"['Orange', 'County', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'esemble', 'great', 'script', 'comical', 'story.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Orange', 'County', 'Shaun', 'Brumder', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'yes', 'TOM', 'HANKS', 'son', 'easy', 'life', 'Orange', 'County', 'California', 'Shaun', 'most', 'days', 'surfing', 'three', 'best', 'buds', 'who', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'wasted', 'catching', 'highest', 'waves', 'possible', 'When', 'one', 'friends', 'suddenly', 'surfing', 'freak', 'storm', 'Shaun', 'life', 'short', 'especially', 'book', 'beach', 'sand', 'written', 'famous', 'Stanford', 'University', 'professor', 'Marcus', 'Skinner', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Shaun', 'wanting', 'become', 'writer', 'wanting', 'attend', 'Stanford', 'University', 'could', 'take', 'one', 'Skinner', 'classes', 'However', 'only', 'problem', 'Shaun', 'dysfunctional', 'family', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'Stanford', 'mom', 'Cindy', 'Beugler', 'Catherine', ""O'Hera"", 'who', 'got', 'remarried', 'old', 'man', 'Bob', 'Beugler', 'George', 'Murdock', 'go', 'college', 'closer', 'home', 'filthy', 'rich', 'dad', 'Bud', 'Brumder', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'got', 'remarried', 'very', 'unfaithful', 'younger', 'woman', 'claims', 'Shaun', ""n't"", 'need', 'become', 'writer', 'being', 'author', ""n't"", 'get', 'rich', 'Shaun', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Shaun', 'Stanford', 'anyway', 'When', 'school', 'councelor', 'wrong', 'transcript', 'application', 'Stanford', 'Shaun', 'rejected', 'Shaun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'so', 'when', 'wasted', 'older', 'brother', 'Lance', 'Brumder', 'Jack', 'Black', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'school', 'try', 'prove', 'school', 'Stanford', 'material', 'Shaun', 'suggestion', 'seriously', 'So', 'Lance', 'up', 'driving', 'Shaun', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'hilarious', 'road', 'trip', 'Stanford', 'Shaun', 'can', 'hopefully', 'get', 'accepted', 'school', 'Shaun', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'unkowningly', 'family', 'friends', 'want', 'stay', 'home', 'care', 'him.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'thought', 'Orange', 'County', 'was', 'extremely', 'hilarious', 'original', 'clever', 'got', 'fantastic', 'script', 'excellent', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'convincing', 'appealing', 'role', 'definitely', 'younger', 'version', 'Tom', 'Jack', 'Black', 'show', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentaries', 'more.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Orange', 'County', '.Score:98/100A+']",N/A

I'm not a fan of Saving Silverman, but that movie had a lot more craziness that I expect from MTV films. This movie, while good, lacked a lot of the craziness I had anticipated, and a completely different plot than I expected. The commercials lead me to believe that the movie would have Jack Black being accepted to the school in lou of the character played by Colin Hanks. This set up would have potential for a lot of crazy comedy. This isn't how the story goes.My disappointment with this film is not that the plot was different its that the movie comes off as more of a drama than a crazy comedy. Don't get me wrong, it has quite a few moments, just not as many as I would have liked. Now as a drama, I would give this movie a higher rating. Mr. Hanks character has the ideal girlfriend, and a near perfect relationship with her. I think most of us guys out there would give anything to have someone like her. His family is a bit on the loopy side though, and it is they who serve the comedy antics that barely pass this film off as a comedy. However, the characters all have serious and very real issues that pull us away from the comedy momentarily too.Its a great story, but more of a renter than a buyer.",3,Not quite what I was expecting,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,1325,"['Jack', 'Black', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'moment', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'lot', 'more', 'crazy', 'antics', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'craziness', 'expect', 'MTV', 'films', 'movie', 'good', 'lacked', 'lot', 'craziness', 'had', 'anticipated', 'completely', 'different', 'plot', 'expected', 'commercials', 'lead', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'Jack', 'Black', 'being', 'accepted', 'school', 'lou', 'character', 'played', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'set', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'potential', 'lot', 'crazy', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'how', 'story', 'goes.My', 'disappointment', 'film', 'not', 'plot', 'was', 'different', 'movie', 'off', 'more', 'drama', 'crazy', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Now', 'drama', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'character', 'ideal', 'girlfriend', 'near', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'think', 'most', 'guys', 'there', 'would', 'give', 'anything', 'have', 'someone', 'family', 'bit', 'loopy', 'side', 'who', 'serve', 'comedy', 'antics', 'barely', 'pass', 'film', 'off', 'comedy', 'However', 'characters', 'have', 'serious', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'pull', 'away', 'comedy', 'momentarily', 'great', 'story', 'more', 'renter', 'buyer']",N/A

The cast all seem to be sons and daughters of famous actors and directors, but everyone did a great job in the movie.  I kept thinking Schuyler Fisk was Laura Prepon (from That 70's Show) and I thought Jack Black's character was pretty annoying, but judging from the other reviews on this site I'm definitely in the minority.The story moves along at a leisurely pace, it's not in your face like other teen comedies, or comedies in general.  A lot of the typical California stereotypes came out in the supporting cast (i.e. money-obsessed dad, drunken mom, pothead friends, etc.) but the main characters the story revolves around (Hanks and Fisk) could have been from any town.  That's the saving grace of this movie, chances are the problems facing Hanks are typical of everyone growing up today.

700168,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000065U36,D. Litton,"[5, 6]","Oh, what a delightful movie &quot;Orange County&quot; is, with its wonderful brand of situational humor and use of Hollywood's underrated actors who bring out the best in the material. One could almost call this film the anti-&quot;American Pie,&quot; considering the PG-13 rating and its somewhat toned down brand of comedy, but it's just as humorous as that previous winner, and comes out as a terrific exercise in non-stop laughs.The story takes place in Orange County, California, where high school senior Shaun Brumder (newcomer Colin Hanks) spends his days cutting class to go surfing with his three best friends. As his story goes, his friend's drowning death while surfing in a tropical storm leads him to change his goals; after finding a popular book on the beach and reading it 52 times in a single month, he makes the decision of becoming a good writer, something he feels he cannot achieve while living where he does.And who could blame him? His mother, Cindy (Catherine O'Hara), spends her days living in a drunken stupor, the product of a marriage for material wealth who wants nothing more than for Shaun to remain at home. Her husband is an elderly man who requires a wheelchair and a daily dose of various medications to keep him docile, while Shaun's brother Lance (Jack Black) is a connoisseur of illegal substances. His father (John Lithgow), who divorced his mother for a 20-year-old toothpick, is appalled by his son's future plans.This leaves him one option: going to college out of town, and so he applies to Stanford, a school he yearns for with every fiber of his being. After he is rejected through a comedic series of mishaps and misunderstandings, he becomes desperate, and so he, his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), and Lance drive out to Stanford to set things straight.What will follow in the second half of the film is a very funny sequence of events that are refreshingly humorous and sometimes meaningful. Such scenes as the dinner at which Shaun attempts to impress a prestigious Stanford couple (played with great gusto by Garry Marshall and Dana Ivey), and that involving the Dean of Admissions and a bottle of Lance's &quot;pain killers,&quot; are nothing short of side-splitting, some of the funniest moments in a movie in quite some time. Those looking for something in the vein of the recent outpouring of gross-out flicks will be disappointed in &quot;Orange County's&quot; reluctance to go over the edge, but it does succeed in tickling one's funny bone.The best aspect of this film is its shining cast, which includes the best work of some untapped resources that have been missing in action for years. O'Hara and Lithgow turn in quirky, delightful performances as Shaun's parents, while newcomer Hanks makes his mark on Hollywood as teenage boy surrounded by insanity. Jack Black practically steals the show as Lance, taking a turn from his character's in last year's &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; by portraying one of the most detestable human beings in a most enlightening manner. And look out for cameos from Lily Tomlin as a disgruntled guidance counselor, Chevy Chase as a pop culture principal, and Kevin Kline as a prestigious yet down-to-earth writer.Without revealing too much about the film, I will say that Shaun's second change of heart that comes at the movie's ending may be too sentimental for a movie of such comedic potential, but it doesn't cheat by the rules of the teen movie, and is perfectly acceptable. As for the comedy, it doesn't push the envelope, and that's a good thing. &quot;Orange County&quot; is the first truly great comedy of the year, and after last year's hoard of flops, this one adds a glimmer of hope for 2002.",4,A very funny movie!,1011312000,"01 18, 2002",2002,3694,"['Oh', 'what', 'delightful', 'movie', 'quot', 'Orange', 'County', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'brand', 'situational', 'humor', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'underrated', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'material', 'One', 'could', 'almost', 'call', 'film', 'anti-', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'considering', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'somewhat', 'toned', 'down', 'brand', 'comedy', 'just', 'as', 'humorous', 'previous', 'winner', 'out', 'terrific', 'exercise', 'non-stop', 'laughs.The', 'story', 'place', 'Orange', 'County', 'California', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Shaun', 'Brumder', 'newcomer', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'days', 'cutting', 'class', 'go', 'surfing', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'story', 'friend', 'drowning', 'death', 'surfing', 'tropical', 'storm', 'change', 'goals', 'finding', 'popular', 'book', 'beach', 'reading', '52', 'times', 'single', 'month', 'decision', 'becoming', 'good', 'writer', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'achieve', 'living', 'where', 'does.And', 'who', 'could', 'blame', 'mother', 'Cindy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'days', 'living', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'product', 'marriage', 'material', 'wealth', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'Shaun', 'remain', 'home', 'husband', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'wheelchair', 'daily', 'dose', 'various', 'medications', 'keep', 'docile', 'Shaun', 'brother', 'Lance', 'Jack', 'Black', 'connoisseur', 'illegal', 'substances', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'divorced', 'mother', '20-year-old', 'toothpick', 'appalled', 'son', 'future', 'plans.This', 'one', 'option', 'going', 'college', 'town', 'so', 'Stanford', 'school', 'fiber', 'being', 'rejected', 'comedic', 'series', 'mishaps', 'misunderstandings', 'desperate', 'so', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'Lance', 'drive', 'out', 'Stanford', 'set', 'things', 'will', 'follow', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'sequence', 'events', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'humorous', 'sometimes', 'meaningful', 'Such', 'scenes', 'dinner', 'Shaun', 'attempts', 'impress', 'prestigious', 'Stanford', 'couple', 'played', 'great', 'gusto', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Dana', 'Ivey', 'involving', 'Dean', 'Admissions', 'bottle', 'Lance', 'quot', 'pain', 'killers', 'quot', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'side-splitting', 'funniest', 'moments', 'movie', 'quite', 'time', 'looking', 'something', 'vein', 'recent', 'outpouring', 'gross-out', 'flicks', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'quot', 'Orange', 'County', 'quot', 'reluctance', 'go', 'edge', 'succeed', 'tickling', 'one', 'funny', 'bone.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'film', 'shining', 'cast', 'best', 'work', 'untapped', 'resources', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'action', 'years', ""O'Hara"", 'Lithgow', 'turn', 'quirky', 'delightful', 'performances', 'Shaun', 'parents', 'newcomer', 'Hanks', 'mark', 'Hollywood', 'teenage', 'boy', 'surrounded', 'insanity', 'Jack', 'Black', 'practically', 'show', 'Lance', 'taking', 'turn', 'character', 'last', 'year', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', 'portraying', 'one', 'most', 'detestable', 'human', 'beings', 'most', 'enlightening', 'manner', 'look', 'out', 'cameos', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'disgruntled', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'pop', 'culture', 'principal', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'prestigious', 'yet', 'down-to-earth', 'writer.Without', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Shaun', 'second', 'change', 'heart', 'movie', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'such', 'comedic', 'potential', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'rules', 'teen', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'push', 'envelope', 'good', 'thing', 'quot', 'Orange', 'County', 'quot', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'comedy', 'year', 'last', 'year', 'hoard', 'flops', 'one', 'glimmer', 'hope', '2002']",N/A

He writes a story about growing up in Orange County, which becomes the backdrop to the concept of the movie.Coming from a totally dysfunctional family which includes coked-up Lance (Jack Black, who steals the show), alcoholic drama queen Cindy (Catherine O'Hara), and Bud (John Lithgow), Shaun is disappointed to find that he doesn't, in fact, get in to Stanford. Thus beguns a hillarious trip up to the school with Lance and his bleeding-heart girlfriend Ashley to try to talk the Dean of Admissions into adding his name onto the ""admitted"" list. It seems that Jack Black spends most of this movie in his underwear, only pausing to don clothes for the trip to Stanford.Its a hysterically funny movie which makes me laugh harder and harder every time I see it.

Colin Hanks as Shane wants to get into Stanford and tries everything to get the university to reconsider his application. The plot is outlandish with many tropes dating back to at least Animal House, including the admissions office burning down, crazy frat parties, and boyfriend falling from the roof when spying on his girlfriend. Still, it works as a funny but not particularly exceptional movie.The plot develops pretty well until the point where Colin Hanks and Schuyler Fisk break up. Their relationship goes through the same ups and downs found in most romantic comedies, but it happens way too quickly. It's never clear why the two split up, and it's simply unconvincing that they get back together so quickly. It's almost as if there are a few missing scenes in between.One thing I did appreciate about the movie is that despite its exaggerated humor actually mixes outlandish humor with more subtle moments. Stanford cannot live up to Shane's ideals, but nor is it a complete disappointment. Likewise, Shane's dysfunctional family is outrageous but also shows some virtue early on in the movie. The characters all act like complete idiots at times, but are also genuine and sweet. Unfortunately, the ending undermines this balance by veering too close to the typical Hollywood formula of ""local boy choosing to stay home to be with his girlfriend"".Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.

It has been done numerous times in both dramatic and comedic forms.  However, given the state of the market currently, where the industry attempts to draw teenage audiences with disgusting body fluid humor, liberal profanity and gratuitous sex, this film is a breath of fresh air.  Amazingly, without any of these ""required"" elements, this film (which was produced for next to nothing), did fairly well at the box office.Shaun (Colin Hanks) is a kid from Orange County, CA, who loves to surf and hang out with his friends.  He has secretly been achieving high grades between waves and after discovering a book on the beach, he decides he wants to be a writer and go to the elite Stanford University.  When his guidance counselor (Lily Tomlin) sends in the wrong transcript, he is rejected.  So, he takes a road trip with his brother (Jack Black) and his girlfriend (Schuyler Fisk) to set the admissions department straight.The comedy is mostly good clean fun, harmless and goofy.  The film is more notable as a coming out vehicle for kids of stars.  Colin Hanks is the son of Tom Hanks, Schuyler Fisk is Sissy Spacek's daughter and director Jake Kasdan is the son of director Lawrence Kasdan (&quot;The Big Chill&quot;).  The cast abounds with cameos of comics and other notables from the last four decades with appearances by John Lithgow, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, Ben Stiller and renowned director Garry Marshall (""Happy Days"", ""Laverne and Shirley"", ""Mork and Mindy"", ""Murphy Brown"", ""Pretty Woman"").Colin Hanks plays the role of the serious kid in an absurd world.  He spends much of the film being Jack Black's straight man.  He proves himself to be a solid actor, though time will tell if he can transcend the incredulous teen roles.  Black provides the film with most of its comic horsepower, stealing every scene in which he appears with his sheer outrageousness.  Fisk is fairly bland as Shaun's animal rights activist girlfriend.  All the veterans lend a comic hand to deliver a chuckle or two from the sidelines.This is not a memorable film, but at least it is inoffensive.  It has some silly situations and Black provides more than a few guffaws.  I rated it a 7/10.

It's actually a lot more thoughtful than it looked.Shaun Brumder is a writer, who lives in Orange County, California. He wants to apply to Standford University so he can work with Marcus Skinner, tha author who inspired him to write. Trouble is, the application got mixed up, so someone else got to Stanford thanks to Shaun's hard work, and his family scared some connections away who came for dinner, vowing that Shaun would never go to Stanford ever. Shaun's brother, Lance (Jack Black) has an idea. They can all drive to Stanford and talk to the admissions Dean (Harold Ramis, Egon from Ghostbusters). He'll understand the mixup and the troubles when he sees Shaun's real SAT scores. Trouble follows though, and Shaun's hopes for college go up in smoke, almost literally. Will he be able to be a writer?There's a lot of guest appearances in this film, which is good for a film all about characters, I thought. John Lithgow, Ben Stiller, Kevin Kline. It was interesting seeing Harold Ramis again. I don't see him in a lot of films these days, and I'm a big Ghostbusters fan. It's funny the way the characters of Orange County are done. They do some pretty silly things, and yet its just the things they do that are ridiculous, there's a heart to each of the characters, I thought.

Skinner, wrote a novel that Hanks' character is obsessed with, is your typical college professor. In one scene Kline is seen clad in his twill jacket with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of liquor in the other. Have we seen this before? I do have to admit that Kline is convincing. This is probably that film he got experience for his role in the &quot;Emperor's Club.&quot;Black delivers the best lines in the film. He steals every single scene he is in.

It seems, in the past, that a film that brought in major stars only did so to bring in the crowds because the script lacked something. Not here! This script carries a wallop of laughs from the moment it starts until the end, and the cameos only add a wonderful surprise element to this film.Colin Hanks wonderfully struggling college student trying to fulfill a dream of attending Stanford is a role particularly suited to some wonderfull comedic talents. He plays straight man to a cast of totally insane characters that orbit his life, sometimes unfortunately, to dire results. Two of my favorite: Jack Black's older, oft digusting brother, and Catherine O'Hara's drunken mother both left me laughing out loud, as I watched this movie alone.In fact, the strength of this piece is not really the story, which is strong, but those characters as they begin to realize their potential throughout the film. It's been a long time since I've met so many memorable characters in a film. These ones will be staying with me for a long time.Looking for a fun, goofy movie to put you in a good mood?

I don't typically find Jack Black very funny and Colin Hanks is Tom Hanks' son so that creates natural skepticism.  Having said that, I really liked this movie!  Don't look for rocket science here or gushy, gooey romance.  But there is plenty of humor, especially if you don't live in Orange County.  If you're a non-Californian and you're of the prominent opinion that Orange County (and CA in general) is full of flakes and crazy people, this is the movie for you.  The entire movie pokes tongue-in-cheek humor at this locale.  Colin Hanks' character is believable and funny.  Jack Black adds just the right amount of off-color humor to offset Hanks' straight-man humor.  The supporting cast lends plenty of comedic support (esp. the parents -- John Lithgow of Third Rock among others and the mother from Home Alone).The premise of the movie is as follows ... Colin Hanks' character is a surfer dude turned intellectual upon becoming enamored with a book he finds on the beach (Kevin Kline has a cameo in the film as the book's author).  Jack Black is Hanks' wastoid brother.  Their parents are divorced -- the father is a wealthy womanizer with a twinkie of a new wife and the mother is a bit of an alcoholic who is married to a guy who she hopes will kick the bucket soon (she married for the money).  The film is about Hanks' quest to get into Stanford and study under the writer of his favorite book.  His plans are maylaid throughout the movie, particularly with Black's well-intentioned, but horrible assistance.  In the end, things turn out well as with all comedies, but the road is absurdly and humorously bumpy.As for the DVD itself ... the extras are good.

The film was a pleasant suprise and reminded me of the teen movies I was raised on in the 1980s like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" This film ended up being much more intelligent and well-made than the trailers I saw on TV.Director Jake Kasdan (son of the legendary director Lawrence Kasdan) gently skewers the materialism of suburban Orange County, CA by showing us a parade of kids who drive expensive cars, attend school in a fabulous new campus, and seem obsessed with trendy fashions and behavior. Kasdan also directed some episodes of the TV series ""Freaks & Geeks,"" the best portrayal of HS life ever to be shown on TV, so the guy came to this film with a quality resume under his belt.""Orange County"" deals with Colin Hanks' quest to get into Stanford and become a writer to escape his dreadful family in the burbs. Like most teen movies, most of the adults are buffoons (the film features Chevy Chase...need I say more?), and Hanks' friends are stoked-out surfer stoners who provide worthy comic relief. MTV cult hero Jack Black stars as Hanks' sleazy older brother, and although he plays a much smaller role in this film as the trailer makes you believe, he sets up Hanks for some painfully funny plot twists.

700194,APRU373UYVK2Y,B000065U36,J. N. Mohlman,"[1, 2]","I have to admit that I didn't really expect much from ""Orange County"", but having now watched it several times I can happily say that my expectations were entirely wrong.  Not only is ""Orange County"" a very funny movie, but it is also a biting satire and a touching look at family, albeit through absurdist lenses.  Moreover, the DVD is a great value featuring quite a few extras and well laid out, appealing menus.""Orange County"" presents the tale of Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks), and his relentless quest for a spot at Stanford, which he views as the key stepping stone in his burgeoning career as a writer.  Helping (or at least attempting to while frequently hindering) him are a superb ensemble cast that includes another newcomer, Schuyler Fisk, as Shaun's girlfriend, Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow as his parents and Jack Black who brilliantly plays his drug addled, lunatic brother.  When you combine them with cameos from Harold Ramis (the dean of admissions), Chevy Chase (Shaun's principal), Ben Stiller (a fireman) and Kevin Kline (the author/professor whose work inspired Shaun) you have the makings of a great movie.The cast doesn't disappoint, but it is the younger actors who really make the movie.  Hanks shows all of comic timing and sensibility his father displayed in his early years as a comedic actor  and Fisk shows a down-to-earth sensibility and honesty that could have easily been treacly but comes across as sincere.  Black, however, steals the show; the stoner role has been done to death, but somehow he manages to inject a manic edge to it that makes it fresh.  A perfect example is when Black, wearing nothing but underwear and socks, stops to take off said socks before jumping into a pool to save his brother from drowning.What elevates ""Orange County"" above any other teen movie, however, is the biting satire that fills every scene.  By setting the movie in Orange County, and then populating it with clich&eacute;s, the directors have created a film that takes a swipe at the very culture that spawned it.  Moreover, it is no coincidence that Shaun ultimately finds himself through his flawed, but devoted, friends and family.  While they may be caricatures, they are still the only people whose emotions are honest; and what is more important to a writer than emotion?My only complaint about this film is that Chase and Stiller are rather underutilized.  Chase in particular is perfectly positioned to take a larger role in the film, but is rather jarringly ignored after one brief, but classic scene.  Likewise, Stiller, who is one of the few actors who can match Black's mania, is oddly subdued in his appearance.However, these are minor complaints about an otherwise superb film.  ""Orange County"" manages to be both funny and heartfelt at the same time, as it deftly blends an engaging story with excellent performances from as strong a cast as one is likely to find.  There are a lot of movies with funny jokes that get watched once and then tossed aside, and that's because all they are is a string of jokes with no plot holding things together.  Thankfully, ""Orange County"" is a movie you'll watch repeatedly (I know I have) as the story will draw you in even as the jokes make you laugh.Enjoy!Jake Mohlman",5,There's no &quot;ecscaping&quot; Orange County,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,3252,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'Orange', 'County', 'having', 'now', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'happily', 'say', 'expectations', 'were', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'Not', 'only', 'Orange', 'County', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'also', 'biting', 'satire', 'touching', 'look', 'family', 'absurdist', 'lenses', 'Moreover', 'DVD', 'great', 'value', 'featuring', 'quite', 'few', 'extras', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'appealing', 'menus', 'Orange', 'County', 'tale', 'Shaun', 'Brumder', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'relentless', 'quest', 'spot', 'Stanford', 'key', 'stepping', 'stone', 'burgeoning', 'career', 'writer', 'Helping', 'least', 'attempting', 'while', 'frequently', 'hindering', 'are', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'newcomer', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'Shaun', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'John', 'Lithgow', 'parents', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'drug', 'addled', 'lunatic', 'brother', 'When', 'combine', 'cameos', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'dean', 'admissions', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Shaun', 'principal', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'fireman', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'author/professor', 'work', 'inspired', 'Shaun', 'have', 'makings', 'great', 'movie.The', 'cast', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'younger', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'comic', 'timing', 'sensibility', 'father', 'displayed', 'early', 'years', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Fisk', 'down-to-earth', 'sensibility', 'honesty', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'treacly', 'across', 'sincere', 'Black', 'however', 'show', 'stoner', 'role', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'somehow', 'inject', 'manic', 'edge', 'fresh', 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'Black', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'underwear', 'socks', 'take', 'off', 'said', 'socks', 'jumping', 'pool', 'save', 'brother', 'drowning.What', 'Orange', 'County', 'other', 'teen', 'movie', 'however', 'biting', 'satire', 'scene', 'setting', 'movie', 'Orange', 'County', 'then', 'populating', 'clich', 'eacute', 'directors', 'have', 'created', 'film', 'swipe', 'very', 'culture', 'spawned', 'Moreover', 'coincidence', 'Shaun', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'devoted', 'friends', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'caricatures', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'people', 'emotions', 'are', 'honest', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'writer', 'emotion', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'Chase', 'Stiller', 'are', 'rather', 'underutilized', 'Chase', 'particular', 'perfectly', 'positioned', 'take', 'larger', 'role', 'film', 'rather', 'jarringly', 'ignored', 'one', 'brief', 'classic', 'scene', 'Likewise', 'Stiller', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'Black', 'mania', 'oddly', 'subdued', 'appearance.However', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'film', 'Orange', 'County', 'be', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'same', 'time', 'deftly', 'engaging', 'story', 'excellent', 'performances', 'strong', 'cast', 'one', 'likely', 'find', 'are', 'lot', 'movies', 'funny', 'jokes', 'get', 'watched', 'once', 'then', 'tossed', 'aside', 'are', 'string', 'jokes', 'plot', 'holding', 'things', 'together', 'Thankfully', 'Orange', 'County', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'know', 'have', 'story', 'will', 'draw', 'even', 'jokes', 'make', 'laugh.Enjoy', 'Jake', 'Mohlman']",N/A

I specifically loath Jack Black but I guess he epitomizes to perfection Shaun's dysfunctional family.  I can go on & on enumerating flaws but let us be constructive instead, ok?If you will just be patient enough, you will realize the constant struggle & desperation of Shaun, who I say, has big dreams but trapped in a frustrating relationship with his parents & druggie-bro.  This may have not come out too clear with all the senseless & exaggerated string of events, especially those participated by Jack Black - but again, it wouldn't take you a second to realize this just by looking at the latter.In a way, his case is similar (upto a certain degree) to that of Susan Sarandon's daughter in ""Anywhere but Here"", who wanted to leave home in search for freedom, happiness & fulfillment.  Of course, his intense desire to leave is not entirely to pursue his goals but partly to escape his family as well.  At the end, he realizes this through the help of his ever-sensible girlfriend.Also, we have here a bunch of feel-good scenes where parents get together & do everything they can to make things right for their son.  He also realizes that he can achieve his dreams even if it means staying in Orange county.  It would be safe to say at this point that this is the moral of the story.Unfortunately, you have to watch first Shaun's series of misfortunes before finally being comforted at the end.With regard to our newcomers, Colin & Schuyler, let us give them a break.  True, they are children of famous (& need I say, multi-awarded)artists, but it is basically this why people have higher expectations of them.

700201,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000065U36,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[1, 2]","Inspiration comes in many different forms. Some people see a painting and are inspired to become artists. For some the right song could give them the courage to ask a girl they love out on a date. Or if you're name is Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks, and yes, he's the son of Tom Hanks) you find inspiration in a book lying in the sand on the beach. This book, written by famous author Marcus Skinner (who does not appear to have an official website according to Google), gives Shaun the inspiration he needs to drop his surfboard and become a famous author. Keep in mind, this jolt of inspiration comes to him after the fact that he grew up in Orange County (a hick town), after the fact that he's been living with his deranged mother, crippled step dad, and doped up brother (Jack Black, who plays the kind of brother you wish were a poster boy for birth control), and AFTER the fact that one of his surfing buddies dies while riding the ""Ultimate Wave!""After showing his counselor a copy of his story ""Orange County,"" Shaun gets a rude surprise when it's discovered that the counselor sent in his story with someone else's school records to Stanford, which is the only school Shaun applied for (kids, may this be a lesson to you to listen to your parents when they tell you to have a back-up school ready). After this bit of information Shaun asks the counselor ""What are you stupid?"" Yes Shaun, she is stupid. Pretty much everyone in this movie is stupid. They have to be, I suppose, or else the movie wouldn't be funny. Take for example, Shaun's tree hugger for a girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), who secretly prayed that Shaun wouldn't get into Stanford. The last thing you want is a girlfriend who can't pray for you properly. When worse comes to worse though, Shaun's brother Lance suggests that the three of them go to Stanford and demand that they let Shaun in.Thankfully, this is not a road trip movie. It's not even a buddy movie. It's about finding inspiration in the right places, and having to follow your dreams despite the really, really annoying people you have to deal with on a daily basis. Movies about college kids who are stupid and do stupid things normally aren't very good. There are many reasons for this, not the least of which is that these movies are normally about, well...stupid kids that do stupid things. There's only so much stupid you can take before you want to rip someone's heads off. I see stupid people do stupid things in real life. For free. But ""Orange County"" is more then a movie about stupid people. Well...okay, no it's not. This IS a film about stupid people, it just happens to be a good one! The storyline is over-the-top, the characters do things that no sane person would do in public, and farting is on the menu.And yet...there is something genuine and sweet about the characters and their relationships with each other. I couldn't for the life of me explain why I liked these people as much as I did, but I found it within a monolog by Kevin Kline near the end of the film. Without spoiling the speech (and maybe the end of the movie), the secret behind this movies appeal is likely that everyone cares for each other. They may have their own odd ways of showing it, but care for each other they do. The friendship is real and the love is real. The movie is also kind towards the characters, not mocking them like most stupid kid movies do, but laughing with the bad deck of cards they are dealt. This movie was made by MTV, which means it was probably an accident that this movie turned out as good as it did.That said, I must give them credit for this. The movie also inspired me in some silly, non-meaning sense that I decided to write a review for a movie that is five years old. Yes, I guess inspiration truly does come from the strangest of places.Rating: *** and a half stars",3,A Heartwarming Comedy Disguised As A College Film,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,3834,"['Inspiration', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'people', 'see', 'painting', 'are', 'inspired', 'become', 'artists', 'right', 'song', 'could', 'give', 'courage', 'ask', 'girl', 'love', 'out', 'date', ""'re"", 'name', 'Shaun', 'Brumder', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'yes', 'son', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'find', 'inspiration', 'book', 'lying', 'sand', 'beach', 'book', 'written', 'famous', 'author', 'Marcus', 'Skinner', 'who', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'official', 'website', 'according', 'Google', 'Shaun', 'inspiration', 'drop', 'surfboard', 'become', 'famous', 'author', 'Keep', 'mind', 'jolt', 'inspiration', 'fact', 'grew', 'up', 'Orange', 'County', 'hick', 'town', 'fact', 'been', 'living', 'deranged', 'mother', 'crippled', 'step', 'dad', 'doped', 'up', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'kind', 'brother', 'wish', 'were', 'poster', 'boy', 'birth', 'control', 'AFTER', 'fact', 'one', 'surfing', 'buddies', 'dies', 'riding', 'Ultimate', 'Wave', 'showing', 'counselor', 'copy', 'story', 'Orange', 'County', 'Shaun', 'rude', 'surprise', 'when', 'discovered', 'counselor', 'sent', 'story', 'someone', 'else', 'school', 'records', 'Stanford', 'only', 'school', 'Shaun', 'applied', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'lesson', 'listen', 'parents', 'when', 'tell', 'have', 'back-up', 'school', 'ready', 'bit', 'information', 'Shaun', 'counselor', 'What', 'are', 'stupid', 'Yes', 'Shaun', 'stupid', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'movie', 'stupid', 'have', 'be', 'suppose', 'else', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'Take', 'example', 'Shaun', 'tree', 'hugger', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'who', 'secretly', 'prayed', 'Shaun', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'Stanford', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pray', 'properly', 'When', 'worse', 'worse', 'Shaun', 'brother', 'Lance', 'three', 'go', 'Stanford', 'demand', 'let', 'Shaun', 'in.Thankfully', 'not', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'buddy', 'movie', 'finding', 'inspiration', 'right', 'places', 'having', 'follow', 'dreams', 'really', 'really', 'annoying', 'people', 'have', 'deal', 'daily', 'basis', 'Movies', 'college', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'stupid', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'normally', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'movies', 'are', 'normally', 'well', 'stupid', 'kids', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'want', 'rip', 'someone', 'heads', 'see', 'stupid', 'people', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'free', 'Orange', 'County', 'more', 'then', 'movie', 'stupid', 'people', 'Well', 'not', 'film', 'stupid', 'people', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'storyline', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'public', 'farting', 'menu.And', 'yet', 'something', 'genuine', 'sweet', 'characters', 'relationships', 'other', 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'explain', 'why', 'liked', 'people', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'found', 'monolog', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'end', 'film', 'spoiling', 'speech', 'maybe', 'end', 'movie', 'secret', 'movies', 'appeal', 'likely', 'everyone', 'cares', 'other', 'may', 'have', 'own', 'odd', 'ways', 'showing', 'care', 'other', 'do', 'friendship', 'real', 'love', 'real', 'movie', 'also', 'kind', 'characters', 'not', 'mocking', 'most', 'stupid', 'kid', 'movies', 'do', 'laughing', 'bad', 'deck', 'cards', 'are', 'dealt', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'MTV', 'was', 'probably', 'accident', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'as', 'good', 'said', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'movie', 'also', 'inspired', 'silly', 'non-meaning', 'sense', 'decided', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'Yes', 'guess', 'inspiration', 'truly', 'come', 'strangest', 'places.Rating', '***', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

Colin Hanks who was so good on the Roswell TV series does a great job of bringing sanity to the otherwise crazy cinematic universe of Orange County that swirls about him.  In this version, you'll find every kind of nut &amp; fruit possible!  The mixup of the transcript is a funny contrivance that sets the spiral of events on its course.  Since the movie is so short, I don't know why they edited out the hilarious scene (in DVD deleted scenes) of Lily Tomlin knocking out students with a stun gun in the parking lot.  It was a great gag that could have been maxed with dozens of dazed students left in her wake rather than left on the cutting room floor. I also enjoyed Shaun's dream sequence where all the pretty girls heap adulation on him for his writing abilities. Truthfully, I enjoyed Jack Black more when Bruce Willis blew off his arm in The Jackal; but he's sufficently sweet and looks good in his briefs for as porky as he is.  The stoner jokes, while not new, were funny to me.  The movie moves fast, barely taking a pause.  The soundtrack with Brian Wilson's Beach Boy harmonies is terrific.  Jake Kasdan did a great job IMHO.  The material is not ever going to hit classic status, but then Tom Cruise started out in Risky Business; so I think this is an excellent beginning for Hanks.

That's what this movie was. A good, original comedy, with a great story, and even inspired me a bit. Being 18 years old, I am surronded every day with enormous pressures and questions racing through my mind, and I was always thinking of a way I could just, spill them out. In this movie, Shawn feels the same way after his friend dies, and then he finds a book, reads it to death, and decides he wants to be a writer. After I saw this, I thought, ""Maybe that's what I need to do to get my problems out!"", and sure enough, I write all the time now, and I think I might want to be a writer! Nothing helps your troubles more than spilling them out on a piece of paper :)The good message that I got out of this movie was that going to one place you want to go to isn't the only way you can be the person you want to be. Just as Shawn's girlfriend said in the movie: ""I am sorry you didn't get into Stanford, but if you think that going there is the only way you can be the person you want to be, then I just feel sorry for you."" And, on top of all that, it was just RELATIVE to me- I could relate to Shawn's character so well it was just, weird- really made me feel good in thinking that I am not alone :)Ok, ok, enough with the serious stuff in this movie- this also has a TON of funny parts- Jack Black is HILLARIOUS, and Chevy Chase & Ben Stiller make great cameos! Colin Hanks is a very good actor, right up there with his dad.

It's about a teenage surfer Shaun (Colin Hanks), who dedicates his life to writing after reading Marcus Skinner's book. He is an over-achieving student and shouldn't have any troubles being accepted to Stanford. But his guidance counselor mistakenly sends out the wrong transcripts to the University, so Shaun isn't accepted to any university. But he really wants to go to Stanford, so he decides to go to the headmaster of Stanford, to talk him to let him go to Stanford. He goes there together with his brother Lance (Jack Black) and his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk). But once there, his brother sets fire to the office and the headmaster also mistakenly takes his ecstasy, so in the end everything goes wrong. Shaun also has a fight with his girlfriend. But then he meets Marcus Skinner and they talk about writing and Shaun's novel, that he sent to Mr. Skinner. So he gets back with his girlfriend and they return home. He finds out there, that also his father (John Lithgow) and his mother got back together. He makes piece with his friend and decides to stay in Orange County and go to college there.Well, I especially liked Jack Black's performance, because this guy is really funny.

It wasn't a good film (apart from the ending), but it wasn't bad either. This is a film about a guy called Shaun, a teenage boy, trying to get out of a dead-end town. He has a dysfunctional family, a mother who doesn't understand, and he wants to become a writer. So it's based around this madcap family, including Catherine O'Hara, playing Cindy, the mum, who seems to think that everything is about her, and manages to switch the focus onto her constantly. She was also in Beetlejuice, although not as annoying in this. Also including Jack Black, playing Shaun's permanently stoned brother Lance, who was the best character in this film. John Lithgow (Shrek, Harry & The Hendersons) plays Shaun's Dad, who thinks all writers are gay. The bleeding heart, animal-loving girlfriend, plays a small but somewhat significant part. Watch out for Chevy Chase, and Ben Stiller, doing cameos. Tanya, best friend to the girlfriend, reminds me a lot of a younger Angelina Jolie.The soundtrack is brilliant to this film, totally groovy, baby! I found myself nodding my head along to a lot of the songs.It's full of typically gorgeous females, who do a great dance routine whenever a particular song is played.Shaun's character didn't do anything for me I'm afraid. He doesn't inspire or manage to provoke any feelings for the character. I just wanted him to get off the screen most of the time.I can see why a lot of people would identify with the main character in this film. I certainly recognised some of Shaun in other people!

I was very surprised with this movie, and I really enjoyed it.  Even seeing it again, I was still pretty amazed with how good this movie really is.The movie is about a high school student, (Colin Hanks), who wants to go to Stanford University; to become a successful writer and to get the hell out of Orange County!  But things get out of control when his admission records get mixed up and Stanford rejects him.  Knowing that this mistake must be resolved, he'll do just about anything to set things right.  With the help of his girlfriend and stoner brother, (Jack Black), Shaun Brumder is about to find out that getting out of Orange County just might not be the easiest thing in the world.  The movie also includes stars like Catherine O'Hara, John Lithgow, and cameoes from Harold Ramis and Chevy Chase.This is a very funny movie with a great script.  This is a comedy that I think can appeal to everyone.  Though it is PG-13 for some crude humor and drug content, this isn't the most outrageous or offensive movie.  I wouldn't let really little kids see it, but it's nowhere near as bad as the ""American Pie"" movies.  Colin Hanks does a great job on his part, and yes, Jack Black is hillarious.  In fact, I think he's the funniest in the movie.The DVD is okay.  The picture and sound quality is great, but it lacks in special features.  It contains 4 deleted scenes, comentary from the director and writer, theatrical trailer of the movie, and more.

700218,A9VCD9JX1G7Y5,B000065U36,Michael James Allen,"[2, 2]","The thoughts I had going into ""Orange County"" were most likely the same thoughts many people might have about this film: I went into the theater thinking that it had the intense possibility to be just another stupid teen film that is made primarily to showcase a pop soundtrack available at stores near you and to showcase Jack Black being loud and running around (Certainly, the television spots for this film don't do much to discourage this notion). So I had large doubts about the quality of ""Orange County."" Luckily, my doubts were ill-founded. ""Orange County"" is a fantastic film that manages to play its cards just right and come out the winner.The film stars Colin Hanks (son of Tom Hanks who, from the looks of this film, has leading-man status written all over him) as a high schooler who desparately wants to become a writer and, furthermore, study at Stanford University in California. Through a mishap his high school transcripts are sent under the wrong name and he is not accepted to the school. The rest of the film is a manic and laugh-out-loud attempt to try and get himself into Stanford.It should be stated that, yes, this is a teen movie, but it's a smart teen movie with a razor sharp script (from Mike White who made the fantastic ""Chuck & Buck"" and has a very sharp eye for playful and humorous dialogue; he also has a hilarious cameo in the movie as an idiotic English teacher). Yes, the movie also has a pop soundtrack, but the music is smartly picked and used and, thus, enhances the story taking place. And yes, Jack Black is loud and runs around a lot, but his character is not nearly as influential on the story as the horrible TV Spots have led you to believe, and his supporting character does make for a very hysterical distraction from the main plot (In addition to a funny Jack Black, the film is also chock full of celebrity cameos that are all humorous to various degrees, most notably John Lithgow and Harold Ramis).All in all, ""Orange County"" is a funny comedy in the veign of films like ""There's Something About Mary."" It's a crowd-pleasing film, but it's a smart and genuinely humorous crowd-pleasing film.

It's probably not everyone's cup of tea ( or bag of weed if you will), but if you're on the lookout for a mindless yet fairly harmless comedy, this is your ticket.THE STORY:Shaun Brumder, straight ""A"" student and aspiring writer (Tom's boy Colin Hanks) desperately wants to get into Stanford University and was a sure-in until fate (in the form of his moronic high school college counselor and his even more heinous dysfunctional family) conspired against him.  The rest of the movie follows the misadventures of Shaun, his girlfriend Ashley (Sissy Spacek's girl Schuyler Fisk) and his stoner brother Lance (Jack Black) as they take matters into their own hands and try to convince Stanford to give Shaun a chance (as disaster after hilarious disaster strikes all around them...)THE ANALYSIS:Well, the story's premise is decent and the hilarious problems that befall Shaun and crew is pretty sad and hilarious at the same time.  The Jack Black character is the one that drives the movie.BEST SCENES:1. Getting High with the Dean of Admissions.2. Fire, huh huh, huh huh, FireTHE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:This DVD was ""mildly"" stacked.  Here's the rundown of the special features:1. Commentary Track with Director Jake Kasdan and Writer Mike White.  Insightful as usual...2. 4 deleted scenes.  Like the movie, pretty funny but not overly great...3. Interstititals:  15 of the promotional spots that ran on TV pimping the movie.  Pretty funny stuff.4.

It stars Colin Hanks (for those who do not know who Colin Hanks is, he is Tom Hanks's son; he also starred in the first two seasons of the hit TV series, &quot;Roswell&quot;, and starred in the hit teen film, GET OVER IT) and also Jack Black. But besides the two of them, there are cameo roles made by some famous big stars playing wacky characters in the movie. Just to name a few, Cathrine O'Hera and John Lithgrow play the parents of Colin Hanks's character and Chevy Chase and Kevin Kline make appearances. I am wondering why Tom Hanks didn't make an appearance in his son's film...but oh well.Anyway, ORANGE COUNTY is basically a teen movie for the college-aged movie audience, since it is a college movie. It is about a teen living in California where nobody cares about their futures. Sean (Colin Hanks) becomes interested in writing, and wants to be an author. He desparately tries to get into Stanford University, but when the counselor sends him the wrong transcript saying that he's not accepted into the school, he takes his loser brother (Jack Black) and his girlfriend on a road trip to Stanford University where he will try to prove to Stanford that he is smart enough to get accepted into their school. Along the road, they come across some hilarious and wacky kicks and make all kinds of strange side trips.ORANGE COUNTY will be a great film! I have not seen it yet but I've seen the trailer. From the trailer, it's definitely a movie I will want to see. The acting looks great, and the script looks pretty clever and funny. It's bound for success in the box office!

His skills as an actor can be seen in his subtle performance which comes out as realistic and funny with a lot of class.Jack Black has not given us a great performance since ""High Fidelity,"" but in this movie he's hysterically funny, still, the role did not provide for room to show off his skills.The story is solid and steers away from slapstick-teen-comedy, and instead deals with the troubled situation a young man is put into when all his college plans are destroyed and his family is only a wacky burden. The only two things i did not like were the california-surf-dude-pals and the fact that Chevy Chase only apears for less than a minute. Other than that some great cameos make everything funnier, and the laughs keep on coming.In this DVD you will also find 15 teasers, or interstitials, 10 of which are really funny, the only one they did not slip in was the ""great writers"" interstitial.4 deleted scenes and commentary by director and writer make this dvd a better buy.All in all this is a good movie, fun and enjoyable, even though its not a blockbuster.

700228,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000065U36,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Orange County"" is a cut above the average teen comedy (though just barely) thanks to one all-important aspect: the unusual nature of its youthful protagonist.  In most films of this genre, the main character is almost invariably a young man whose aspirations rise no higher than that of getting laid, hanging ten with his buddies, or partaking of every illegal narcotic known to mankind.  Shaun Brumder, however, has loftier goals.  His main dream is to gain acceptance into Stanford University where he will be able to study under the renowned Martin Skinner, a successful author whose work has inspired Shaun to want to become a writer himself.  The only problem is that all the dysfunctional people in Shaun's life seem to be conspiring to keep his dreams from ever becoming a reality.  Whether it be his incompetent college guidance counselor, his ""illiterate"" English teacher, his alcoholic mother, his insensitive father, his maniacal, perpetually wasted brother, or his empty-headed, directionless surf buddies, Shaun seems surrounded by people who, whether consciously or unconsciously, seem determined to bring him down to their level.  The humor of the film, therefore, arises from the tension that develops between all these youth comedy clich&eacute;s and stereotypes and the central hero who can't help but appeal to our own understanding and sympathy.Young Colin Hanks makes Shaun into a very likable central character, a rock of sanity in this sea of swirling madness.  Jack Black, as Shaun's brother, shows once again that nobody does a better job than he at impersonating the dumb slob loser, following in the honorable footsteps of ""Animal House""'s John Belushi.  Schuyler Fisk provides warmth and charm as Shaun's understanding girlfriend, the one levelheaded person in Shaun's coterie of family members, friends and acquaintances.  And Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow hit comic high notes as Shaun's crazy, mixed up parents.  Harold Ramis, Lily Tomlin, Chevy Chase, Kevin Kline and a host of other big name stars make effective cameo appearances in the film.At times one wishes that writer Mike White and director Jake Kasdan had aspired to create a richer, subtler comedy than the one they've ultimately come up with.  Shaun's story might have been more interesting had the filmmakers not always been so eager to go for the broad caricature, the tired pratfall, the easy laugh.  ""Orange County"" may be better than most films of its ilk, but that really isn't saying much in the long run.  It's ultimately, when all is said and done, a pretty dumbed-down little comedy.  Still, given what one might be led to expect from its advertising, ""Orange County"" also has its moments of unanticipated appeal and charm.",3,better than average but still not great,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,2732,"['Orange', 'County', 'cut', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'just', 'barely', 'thanks', 'one', 'all-important', 'aspect', 'unusual', 'nature', 'youthful', 'protagonist', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'main', 'character', 'almost', 'invariably', 'young', 'man', 'aspirations', 'rise', 'higher', 'getting', 'laid', 'hanging', 'ten', 'buddies', 'partaking', 'illegal', 'narcotic', 'known', 'mankind', 'Shaun', 'Brumder', 'however', 'loftier', 'goals', 'main', 'dream', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'Stanford', 'University', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'study', 'renowned', 'Martin', 'Skinner', 'successful', 'author', 'work', 'inspired', 'Shaun', 'want', 'become', 'writer', 'only', 'problem', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'Shaun', 'life', 'seem', 'be', 'conspiring', 'keep', 'dreams', 'ever', 'becoming', 'reality', 'be', 'incompetent', 'college', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'illiterate', 'English', 'teacher', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'insensitive', 'father', 'maniacal', 'perpetually', 'wasted', 'brother', 'empty-headed', 'directionless', 'surf', 'buddies', 'Shaun', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'seem', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'level', 'humor', 'film', 'therefore', 'arises', 'tension', 'youth', 'comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotypes', 'central', 'hero', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'appeal', 'own', 'understanding', 'sympathy.Young', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Shaun', 'very', 'likable', 'central', 'character', 'rock', 'sanity', 'sea', 'swirling', 'madness', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Shaun', 'brother', 'once', 'again', 'nobody', 'better', 'job', 'impersonating', 'dumb', 'slob', 'loser', 'following', 'honorable', 'footsteps', 'Animal', 'House', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'warmth', 'charm', 'Shaun', 'understanding', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'levelheaded', 'person', 'Shaun', 'coterie', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'John', 'Lithgow', 'hit', 'comic', 'high', 'notes', 'Shaun', 'crazy', 'mixed', 'up', 'parents', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'host', 'other', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'make', 'effective', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film.At', 'one', 'writer', 'Mike', 'White', 'director', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', 'had', 'aspired', 'create', 'richer', 'subtler', 'comedy', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ultimately', 'come', 'up', 'Shaun', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'eager', 'go', 'broad', 'caricature', 'tired', 'pratfall', 'easy', 'laugh', 'Orange', 'County', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'ilk', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'long', 'run', 'ultimately', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'pretty', 'dumbed-down', 'little', 'comedy', 'Still', 'given', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'expect', 'advertising', 'Orange', 'County', 'also', 'moments', 'unanticipated', 'appeal', 'charm']",N/A

""Orange County"" is wonderfully original and redefines the teenage movie genre. The film is full of great jokes and an inventive plot that will leave you in awe of the originality of this movie. This is one of the few comedies that can be viewed of people of all ages due to no foul language and no sex, unless you consider rolling around and kissing sex.Shawn is an Orange County teenager that used to live for surfing. When he was at the beach one day he stumbled upon a book that would change his life. The book that he read made him decide to give up surfing and made him start writing. Flash forward a year or so later and it's time for Shawn to apply for college. Shawn's dream school is the prestigious Stanford University. He applies to only that school because the college counselor (who has no clue what she's doing) says that he'll definitely get in. Shawn doesn't get in and thus starts his adventure to get in. From a meeting with a mony donor to the school all the way to a trip to Stanford, this is one film that will be enjoyed immensely. Will Shawn get into the school? Watch this film and find out!The best thing about the film is without a doubt that characters and the actors who play them. Award winning actor Tom Hanks' son Colin plays the lead character of Shawn. Colin puts on a truly fantastic performance. His talent will make you wish that other teen actors were as good as him. The girl that plays Shawn's girlfriend in the film is great as well. Jack Black plays Shawn's brother, and to be honest, this movie would have been nowhere as good as it was without him. Shawn's parents are truly fantastic as well as you can see how money affects their lives in a bad way.This film is a lesson on many things. Shawn's quest to be a writer shows how that wherever you are and in whatever atmosphere you are in that you can achieve what you want with hard work. As said above, the film shows how money does not buy happiness and can contribute to a melancholy life.""Orange County"" is a movie that shows how all teen movies should be. It is a wonderful comedy that teaches various lessons while entertaining.

700239,AL277B4AQCWBG,B000065U36,Steven Reynolds,"[0, 0]","""Orange County"" tries to walk a line between trash comedy and The Thinking Teen's Independent Film - which is apt, considering it deals with a young man choosing between Orange County and the hallowed halls of Stanford. Pity it doesn't entirely work. The main problem is an insubstantial screenplay, which even at a mere 82 minutes feels strangely long. The setup is good and the characters are interesting, but it never really achieves lift-off - mainly because we're never allowed to feel the emotions which a story about finding your place in the world actually requires. Perhaps nervously, director Kasdan too often goes for the slapstick laugh which feels out of place in a story dealing with something more serious. It comes across as cartoonish. Which is interesting, because the one film this compares most unfavorably with is Terry Zwigoff's identically themed ""Ghost World"", a movie which proves you can make a laugh-out-loud teen comedy with a very serious social bite - the humor just has to be of a different, more subtle kind.

700245,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B000065U36,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[1, 1]","In BriefShaun Brumder is a surfer dude from the sunshine state, whose outlook on life takes a U Turn following the death of a friend and the discovery of a book on the beach.  Realising his desire to become a writer, he sets his board to one side and pursues acceptance at Stanford University.  A straight-A student he should have been a shoe-in but a series of obstacles block his path as he sets out on a journey of personal discovery.ReviewThough the marketing department behind Orange County would like us to believe that this film is a laugh out loud riot, unfortunately it is not.  This is a weird breed of filmmaking as it is essentially a feel good movie for teenagers.  Now that's not to say that this film isn't funny, but the comedy gems are spread out and generally come courteously of Jack Black.Black, for those of you who don't know, is part of the comedy genius behind Tenacious D (the satirical folk metal band) and the man who memorably stole the show in High Fidelity.  Here he plays Shaun's older stoner brother to perfection, but criminally his total screen time is short and one can't help but wish he featured in the film as heavily as he does in the promotional posters and press releases.Like Black's performance the strength of the film comes through its attention to the very small character traits or idiosyncrasies (or should that be inconsistencies) of teenage life.  The ironic focus on relationships and finding ones path in life is unfortunately overshadowed by hardcore Californian mush.  Remember California Dreams from 90's morning TV, well its not that bad!  However if one were to lift a plot from said TV Show and add a shiny new 12A rating, thus creating more dick, fart and drug jokes before leaving to soak in a syrup of sentimentality, you would be closer to the quality that is Orange County.That said, this is not a bad film, its weakness is that is not memorable, it is pleasant, and pleasant does not memorable make.  While any film featuring Chevy Chase isn't hard to dislike, I can't fault Orange County on its use of classic comedy actors.  Their presence, if anything, lends a thin story some comedy kudos.  However one can't help but feel slightly cynical about a movie that stars the children of Tom Hanks, Sissy Spacek and Lawrence Kasdan - as you imagine that the kids wanted to make a funny film and they got mom & pa's pals to come and be in it.Its not easy to make a good teen flick, as one can go too far either way, but viewing  the movie with some perspective you can't help but feel that the creator was looking back on their life through rose tinted glasses.  This is not a slacker movie to the quality that Kevin Smith has shown us and nor is it a caper along the lines of American Pie or Road Trip.  Getting this one right was always going to be hard, giving the warm glow treatment to the teenage market just doesn't feel right, I'll settle for Jay and Silent Bob any day: Snoochie Boochie Noochies this ain't!The VerdictOrange County is worth seeing as it's a nice film, but its use of 20% plot concentrate, 20% comedy and 60% watered down feel good factor is not gonna make me want to see it more than once.",2,NOT GOOD,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3175,"['BriefShaun', 'Brumder', 'surfer', 'dude', 'sunshine', 'state', 'outlook', 'life', 'U', 'Turn', 'following', 'death', 'friend', 'discovery', 'book', 'beach', 'Realising', 'desire', 'become', 'writer', 'board', 'one', 'side', 'pursues', 'acceptance', 'Stanford', 'University', 'straight-A', 'student', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-in', 'series', 'obstacles', 'path', 'out', 'journey', 'personal', 'marketing', 'department', 'Orange', 'County', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'film', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'riot', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'weird', 'breed', 'filmmaking', 'essentially', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'Now', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'funny', 'comedy', 'gems', 'are', 'spread', 'generally', 'come', 'courteously', 'Jack', 'Black.Black', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'part', 'comedy', 'genius', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'satirical', 'folk', 'metal', 'band', 'man', 'who', 'memorably', 'stole', 'show', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'Here', 'Shaun', 'older', 'stoner', 'brother', 'perfection', 'criminally', 'total', 'screen', 'time', 'short', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'featured', 'film', 'as', 'heavily', 'promotional', 'posters', 'press', 'releases.Like', 'Black', 'performance', 'strength', 'film', 'attention', 'very', 'small', 'character', 'traits', 'idiosyncrasies', 'should', 'be', 'inconsistencies', 'teenage', 'life', 'ironic', 'focus', 'relationships', 'finding', 'ones', 'path', 'life', 'unfortunately', 'overshadowed', 'hardcore', 'Californian', 'mush', 'Remember', 'California', 'Dreams', '90', 'morning', 'TV', 'well', 'not', 'bad', 'However', 'one', 'were', 'lift', 'plot', 'said', 'TV', 'Show', 'add', 'shiny', 'new', '12A', 'rating', 'thus', 'creating', 'more', 'dick', 'fart', 'drug', 'jokes', 'leaving', 'soak', 'syrup', 'sentimentality', 'would', 'be', 'closer', 'quality', 'Orange', 'County.That', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'weakness', 'not', 'memorable', 'pleasant', 'pleasant', 'not', 'memorable', 'make', 'film', 'featuring', 'Chevy', 'Chase', ""n't"", 'hard', 'dislike', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Orange', 'County', 'use', 'classic', 'comedy', 'actors', 'presence', 'anything', 'thin', 'story', 'comedy', 'kudos', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'slightly', 'cynical', 'movie', 'children', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'imagine', 'kids', 'wanted', 'make', 'funny', 'film', 'got', 'mom', 'pa', 'pals', 'come', 'be', 'it.Its', 'not', 'easy', 'make', 'good', 'teen', 'flick', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'way', 'viewing', 'movie', 'perspective', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'creator', 'was', 'looking', 'back', 'life', 'rose', 'tinted', 'glasses', 'not', 'slacker', 'movie', 'quality', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'shown', 'caper', 'lines', 'American', 'Pie', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Getting', 'one', 'right', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'giving', 'warm', 'glow', 'treatment', 'teenage', 'market', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'day', 'Snoochie', 'Boochie', 'Noochies', 'ai', ""n't"", 'VerdictOrange', 'County', 'worth', 'seeing', 'nice', 'film', 'use', '20', '%', 'plot', 'concentrate', '20', '%', 'comedy', '60', '%', 'watered', 'down', 'feel', 'good', 'factor', 'not', 'gon', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once']",N/A

The story is about Sean Brumner, a senior in high school trying to desperately get out of Orange County where he grew up so he can become a famous writer.  Because an inept college counselor sends in the wrong transcript, Sean does not get into Stanford University so his stoner brother, girlfriend and him go on a road trip to SU to see if they can get Sean in.  This is obviously not very deep comedy, but it is still very funny.  Jack Black's antics are hilarious, some of them reminding me of his role in Saving Silverman except more stoned.Colin Hanks is very good as Sean Brumner, the surfer turned writer who so desperately wants to get out of Orange County.  He holds his own through it all as his moods change from calm to pyschotic to paranoid as everything around him begins to crumble.  Like I said before, Jack Black is great, if at times a little underused.  Schulyer Fisk stars as Sean's nature-loving girlfriend Ashley, who is always there to support him.  Sean's dyfunctional family also includes Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow, both having very funny roles.  There are also cameos by Chevy Chase as a school principal, Ben Stiller as a fireman, Lily Tomlin as an inept college counselor, Kevin Kline as the writer that insprires Sean, Harold Ramis, and Gary Marshall.  The DVD offers deleted scenes, widescreen presentation, numerous TV spots whether it be teaser or trailer, and also a commentary.

So determined, in fact, that he applies nowhere else.  He's stunned when he doesn't get in and finds out that his counselor accidentally sent the wrong transcript.  Dealing with this disappointment as well as coping with his flaky family sends him over the edge.  He decides unwisely to allow his druggy brother (Jack Black) to drive him to Stanford and help him gain admittance.ORANGE COUNTY definitely has some bright spots, including a likeable lead in Colin Hanks.  Jack Black is also quite funny, although his character is often too over the top to match the tone of the movie.  He reminds me of an ""Animal House"" outcast.  Finally, the classroom scenes featuring writer Mike White (he also wrote Chuck & Buck and The Good Girl) are hilarious.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is only sporadically funny, especially the scenes with his family.  Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone) plays his boozy mother who married an elderly wheel-bound chair man, Bob, in order to maintain her wealthy lifestyle.  She also argues with her Hispanic maid and forgets to give Bob his pain medication.  Not funny!  The tone of the film is also uneven, veering from broad gross-out humor to sensitive scenes.  The ending is particularly incongruous.  In addition, much of the supporting cast (e.g., Lily Tomlin, John Lithgow, Chevy Chase) are sorely underused.The ads for ORANGE COUNTY (many of which are included here) portrayed it as a parody of faceless suburbia, but the movie really doesn't pursue that angle, settling instead for routine teen comedy jokes.  In the end, however, it's hard to dislike this movie.  It provides a few chuckles and has some likeable performances.
