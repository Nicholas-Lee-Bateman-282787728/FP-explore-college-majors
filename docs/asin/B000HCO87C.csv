1012677,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HCO87C,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Although one wonders why it even needed to be made in the first place - let's face it the original 1976 horror classic wasn't that good in the first place - this slick and haunting remake does the job quite well, and in many respects is even better than its predecessor. This stylistic remake is certainly one of the better films about hellfire and brimstone and devilish possession to be released in recent years.The antichrist has finally been born in the form of a deceptively cherubic little boy, who brings Armageddon to the home of a powerful and respected U.S. ambassador Robert Thorne (a brooding Liev Schreiber).  His wife Kate (Julia Stiles) doesn't know that the babies were swapped at birth, and that her real child has died and she must never know his secret.They name the child Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and shower him with love. Life is wonderful, Thorn is appointed American ambassador to Great Britain, and the couple moves to a beautiful estate near London, with their healthy son, and a golden political future. But of course Damien no ordinary boy. His real mother is in fact a jackal.On his sixth birthday those around Damien start to die. His first nanny hangs herself. Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) repeatedly tries to warn Mr. Thorn of his family's fate, but Thorn just doesn't want to listen. A sinister and snarling dog appears to act as an unwanted watchdog over the child and gorillas in the zoo shriek and run from Damien in terror.Suddenly, the sweet and soft-spoken Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) arrives but she's really a deceptively evil nanny from hell, sent to protect the child. And a photographer (David Thewlis) discovers bizarre markings in his photos that threaten death for the Thorns unless Damien is destroyed. It all gets creepier and scarier and the Thorns' slowly realize who and what their son is.Restraint seems to be the order of the day here, as director John Moore builds the action and atmosphere steadily. Both Stiles and Schreiber give beautifully understated performances and the lovely Ms. Farrow - all concentrated eyes and disturbing smiles - brings the needed prestige to the film.Filmed in Prague, The Omen has the creepy look that one should expect from this genre and the gorgeous cinematography juxtaposes the cold daylight of reality with the hidden dangers in seemingly ordinary people. Remakes don't usually live up to originals, but in this case The Omen looks sharper and plays classier than the first film, and is a quite enthralling, inventive and ultimately bone-chillingly gratifying.

1012678,A1KSO56UWS2R7I,B000HCO87C,"Adam L. Safianow ""Kiddo""","[2, 5]","For those who didn't know, this is a remake of the 1976 remake of Seltzer's classic 'The Omen'.  That being said, this movie is pretty much scene for scene like the original, just updated and translated to more current events.  This changes to the classic allow for a much more belivable series of events for this MTV generation we love so much.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't live up to the hype, in fact, it was borderline mediocre.  Those that saw the original will feel very anxious in their seats, not out of fear, but out of pure boredum.  Almost no changes have been made, and Schreiber and Stiles' performances were quite below par.  I will say however, Farrow was what saved the movie.  She played the protector/nanny of Satan's son VERY well, both creepy and intense; she gets your guard down long enough for the scares.Now, as far as a current horror movie, this we actually decent.  The latest horror movies coming out have been way worse than this, so I guess you could say this is one of the better ones.  Many of the people that see this version won't have seen the original, so they are missing out on a lot of very great stuff that was taken out of it.The soundtrack wasn't near as good as the first one; this movie did provide an excellent atmosphere, and the actor who played Damien was creepy enough to provide a fair incapslation of Damien.  They did make him a lot less of the movie, in fact, he hardly ever spoke, was kind of whinny, and didn't really DO much.  Considering the movie is about him, you'd think he'd have a bigger part.All in all, if you are looking to get away from the lot of major box office movies, or trying to catch a good scare, this movie has it's moments.  If you are looking for an earthshattering remake, you are way off base.  Depending one what you're into depends on if you'll like this.  Those seeing The Omen for the first time won't be too disappointed, but those that have will be bored.",3,"This generation will be bored... those that never saw the original, this had it's moments...",1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,1944,"['who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'remake', '1976', 'remake', 'Seltzer', 'classic', ""'The"", 'Omen', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'scene', 'original', 'just', 'updated', 'translated', 'more', 'current', 'events', 'classic', 'allow', 'much', 'more', 'belivable', 'series', 'events', 'MTV', 'generation', 'love', 'so', 'much.Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'fact', 'was', 'borderline', 'mediocre', 'saw', 'original', 'will', 'feel', 'very', 'anxious', 'seats', 'not', 'fear', 'pure', 'boredum', 'Almost', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Schreiber', 'Stiles', 'performances', 'were', 'quite', 'below', 'par', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'Farrow', 'was', 'what', 'saved', 'movie', 'played', 'protector/nanny', 'Satan', 'son', 'VERY', 'well', 'creepy', 'intense', 'guard', 'down', 'long', 'enough', 'scares.Now', 'as', 'far', 'current', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', 'decent', 'latest', 'horror', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'worse', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Many', 'people', 'see', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'lot', 'very', 'great', 'stuff', 'was', 'taken', 'it.The', 'soundtrack', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'movie', 'did', 'provide', 'excellent', 'atmosphere', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Damien', 'was', 'creepy', 'enough', 'provide', 'fair', 'incapslation', 'Damien', 'did', 'make', 'lot', 'less', 'movie', 'fact', 'hardly', 'ever', 'spoke', 'was', 'kind', 'whinny', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'DO', 'much', 'Considering', 'movie', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'bigger', 'part.All', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'away', 'lot', 'major', 'box', 'office', 'movies', 'trying', 'catch', 'good', 'scare', 'movie', 'moments', 'are', 'looking', 'earthshattering', 'remake', 'are', 'way', 'base', 'Depending', 'one', 'what', ""'re"", 'depends', ""'ll"", 'like', 'seeing', 'Omen', 'first', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'have', 'will', 'be', 'bored']",N/A
1012679,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000HCO87C,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","A somewhat subdued 'end of days' thriller, following in the footsteps of the terribly acted 1976 original, the 6/6/06 Omen is equally badly acted but that's okay because good acting would have spoiled its almost Greek tragedy texture. Actors wearing masks would have been more proper.Sometimes crossing the line into 'exploitation' territory - suggesting that 9/11 and the last Space Shuttle crash were events described in the Book of Revelation - the Omen is someone one may want to watch on Halloween night after making sure that small children aren't present. There are no significant additions or innovations when compared to its 1976 predecessor other than a few CGI touches that make some of the more gruesome scenes look a little more 'real'. Other than that, Damien walks the exact same path and the movie ends with him exactly where we expected him to be, having watched the original release.The Blu-ray treatment does enhance the viewing experience and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound is as good as it gets. Other Blu-ray enhancements include the ""Devil's Notes"" option which splashes little trivia notes on the screen, sometimes but not always related to what is being shown. We get to learn, for example, that the movie's first day earnings were a dollar figure that ended in 666, that Mia Farrow has several relatives named Damien, about the 6 classes of demons and their characteristics and a lot about various Satan-worshiping or admiring cults and movements.Additional features include an alternate commentary sound track, a feature on the composing and performing of the lugubrious sound track music and a surprisingly long and generally boring 22-minute discussion where various authorities on the subject such as author Tim LaHaye, someone who was born on 12/6/66 and other people in the know tell us that 666 is a very mysterious and troubling number.Overall, it's not a bad movie and it more or less met my expectations. The crisp Blu presentation and the modernized recreation of an old almost-classic earn it its 3 stars meaning ""It's OK"".",3,"Blu-ray edition - not bad, considering expectations",1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2064,"['somewhat', 'subdued', ""'end"", 'days', 'thriller', 'following', 'footsteps', 'terribly', 'acted', '1976', 'original', '6/6/06', 'Omen', 'equally', 'badly', 'acted', 'okay', 'good', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'spoiled', 'almost', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'texture', 'Actors', 'wearing', 'masks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'proper.Sometimes', 'crossing', 'line', ""'exploitation"", 'territory', 'suggesting', '9/11', 'last', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'crash', 'were', 'events', 'described', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'Omen', 'someone', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'Halloween', 'night', 'making', 'sure', 'small', 'children', 'are', ""n't"", 'present', 'are', 'significant', 'additions', 'innovations', 'when', 'compared', '1976', 'predecessor', 'other', 'few', 'CGI', 'touches', 'make', 'more', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'look', 'little', 'more', ""'real"", 'Other', 'Damien', 'exact', 'same', 'path', 'movie', 'exactly', 'where', 'expected', 'be', 'having', 'watched', 'original', 'release.The', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'experience', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'Other', 'Blu-ray', 'enhancements', 'include', 'Devil', 'Notes', 'option', 'little', 'trivia', 'notes', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'not', 'always', 'related', 'what', 'being', 'shown', 'get', 'learn', 'example', 'movie', 'first', 'day', 'earnings', 'were', 'dollar', 'figure', 'ended', '666', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'several', 'relatives', 'named', 'Damien', '6', 'classes', 'demons', 'characteristics', 'lot', 'various', 'Satan-worshiping', 'admiring', 'cults', 'movements.Additional', 'features', 'include', 'alternate', 'commentary', 'sound', 'track', 'feature', 'composing', 'performing', 'lugubrious', 'sound', 'track', 'music', 'surprisingly', 'long', 'generally', 'boring', '22-minute', 'discussion', 'where', 'various', 'authorities', 'subject', 'such', 'author', 'Tim', 'LaHaye', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'born', '12/6/66', 'other', 'people', 'know', 'tell', '666', 'very', 'mysterious', 'troubling', 'number.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'met', 'expectations', 'crisp', 'Blu', 'presentation', 'modernized', 'recreation', 'old', 'almost-classic', 'earn', '3', 'stars', 'meaning', 'OK']",N/A

However, upon viewing last night, I feel like it is one of the only remakes that is actually worthy of being CALLED a remake.Most of today's horror remakes of the movies of yesteryear go by the same names whether they follow the same exact story or not. Why you could complain that the remake is unnecessary and adds nothing new, that is almost what makes it good. It may be unnecessary and unoriginal, but it follows almost exactly to the original very faithfully. There are very few slight differences in the movie which really don't make a difference at all.If you like the original, I find it contradictory to say you do not like this one, for they are almost carbon copies of one another. The main difference is the cast and, of course, the special effects are a bit better than in those days. The performances were right on key with the feel of the movie. Julia Stiles was amazing as always, and Liev Schrieber should be able to comfortably shed the reputation as being a lame character in the most desperate of the Scream trilogy movies. I WILL say I preferred the kid from the original. Besides that, I have absolutely no complaint about this movie.Hopefully, you will ignore all of the negative remarks.

I thought this movie was supposed to be scary-fun or somewhere along the line 'cause hey! it's about an evil kid bringing on the end of the world, how cool does that sound?but nope. It's not about the evil kid so much as about not-unlike-Final-Destination scenarios. You know, natural but bizzar deaths such as things fall that stabs/decapitates people, things coincidently explodes etc etc.The actor who plays the kid looks dead-bored throughout the whole entire film, in fact, I never convinced for a second that he was evil, he was anti-social and needs therapy, sure, but the evil nanny (Mia, the one who plays the evil nanny, was the ONLY person in the cast who enjoyed playing her role) spooked me more than him. And yes, when Thorn tried to kill the kid I felt sorry for the kid-and the actor who plays the kid that he had to put up with this film. In fact, I feel sorry for pretty much all the actors who participated, especially the one who plays Thorn, I can just imagine that he was thinkin'(when he was raising his knife): ""why ON EARTH did I agree to take this role?""And the whole movie just PROVED the absurdity of the belief about the Apocalypse. The ending was SO INCREDBILY lame, nope, didn't scare me, if I had a rock I would throw at the screen for its OVER-THE-LINE lameness. For some strange reason suddently Satan took over the world and not only God does not seem to try to stop him, He seemed to facillitate him, by sending Angels to rec havok on earth and didn't even protect Thorn when he was in the church ready to kill the kid.

These usages basically justified their loved ones' deaths ('cause according to this film it was the ""angels"" who made these things happen OF COURSE!). If I have a loved on who died in Katrina or 9/11 I would DEFINITELY have sued. And people protest Da Vinci's Code?

1012685,ARA48345JZPZR,B000HCO87C,Archmaker,"[1, 1]","Let's face it, the reason the orginal Omen was such a sensation was due to an impaling and a decapitation presented on-screen with fully realized state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects, along with some creepy choral music and the central idea of an evil little kid.  Throw in a hanging, viscious dogs, spooky graveyards and an A-List cast to make it all acceptable and there you have a box office hit.So, what about this remake?  Good cast.  Even better special effects.  Good production.  What's missing?  The shocks.  We all know what's coming and therefore suspense and disbelief at what we're seeing is nowhere in sight.When I saw the original it was truly spooky and suspensful and the murders were actually shocking.  We really hadn't seen it done like that before.  Watching this one, I very much like the actors involved and the production and direction were fine, and they did some slight riffing on the main murders, but I expected them and they came where and when they were supposed to, so no surprise and over-all nothing has really been added or enhanced from the original.

I think most of my gripe is because of the child actor they chose for this one-- he's just plain scary looking, whereas the child in the original was creepily cherubic, his smile sweet and sinister, and his curly locks perpetually hanging in his face. This new kid is cold and dark, offering little besides a few menacing stares and hushed speaking lines.Basic premise: Kate (Julia Stiles) loses her baby during childbirth. Having gone through a difficult childbirth, she's unaware of this, so her husband, politician Robert Thorne (Liev Schrieber) works it out so they can ""adopt"" a motherless newborn. And of course he tells his wife that this is indeed their child. They name the boy Damien, there's a ""happily ever after"" montage of birthdays and first steps, and we flashforward to Damien at age 5, who has bags under his eyes, never gets sick, and is a freaky, friendless boy. Kate begins having ""delusions"" that Damien is evil, and when we see the kid barreling down the hallway on a scooter while mom is standing on a chair at the edge of the balcony watering some flowers, we know that she is most definitely NOT delusional.The rest of the story centers around Robert trying to discover the underlying secrets of Damien's birth. Scenes with David Thewlis (the journalist who snaps eerie photos that contain, gasp, omens) and Mia Farrow (the ""I'm here to protect you"" nanny) are especially pleasing. Aside from a few cheap tricks to make you jump out of your seat (and you will!), this movie isn't as scary as the original. Worth a look for horror fans and anyone looking for a few good jumps.

I don't know what to say when in fact that there is no such thing as plagiarism in Hollywood these days. The remake of The Omen is a lot like the remake of Psycho minus the masturbation scene, and comparing both of them, even though the latter got a rating of `1', the remake of Psycho was better. Watching this turd, The Omen remake is predictably boring because of two reasons: I already saw the original plenty of times (and it was almost word-for-word and I remember it all and there is no fun in it) and nothing seemed to be human about it. There is no creation of real emotion or suspense. It was just fake...fake...fake. Instead of paying the admission price of seeing her to act in anything, I rather want see Julia Stiles be given a Chinese torture. I have a hard time believing in her face because she looks exactly like a teenager in an adult role. Who was the loser that said that Liev Schreiber can play the lead actor? Mia Farrow, your career is officially over. John Moore thought that he was directing a horror flick but instead fails to know what constitutes one. There is an excessive use of thunder throughout the picture, and higher emphasis is placed on the thought of ""the gorier, the better.""

Unfortunately, all the scary moments turned out to be nothing but short little rushed moments of action scenes involving Damien (the child who's Satan) killing people (or trying to kill them) in different ways.  There was almost no build up or suspense whatsoever.Damien didn't really strike me as much of a scary child, either.  More like a normal quiet kid who just preferred being by himself.  Maybe his acting could have been better too.I was a bit scared when the dogs that were hanging around Damien suddenly started growling whenever the father entered a room.  I guess that's a secret fear I have of vicious dogs.Overall, I wasn't scared.  The movie didn't deliver the type of fear that makes you think about bad things, and instead was just one action scene after another.  It was almost like a made for TV movie, the more I think about it.UPDATE- ONE WEEK LATER-Okay, I rewatched the movie, and enjoyed it more the second time.  A movie that probably deserves closer to four stars.  It STILL drives me mad that there's hardly no build-up to any of the scary moments, and that things just ""happen out of nowhere"".  I guess in some cases, such as with the dogs in the graveyard, this can be a very scary thing (especially with the volume on the TV up really out).The ending was good too.  It was very surprising.  I also should have mentioned I had never seen the original version from the mid 70's.  I guess I should have seen that and compared the two, since almost everyone agrees the original was better.Oh, another thing about this movie I liked was the same thing I liked in that movie Final Destination 3- I enjoyed seeing ""weird"" things in the backgrounds of the photos the photographers were taking.  You'll see what I mean (I don't want to give anything away).Oh, and can't forget about the guy who loses his head near the end of the film.  Good entertainment there.  He must have been a Beatles fan ""When I get old I'm losing my head!"" Oh wait, Paul McCartney says ""hair"".

Has everyone just gotten too lazy to come up with any original ideas? Some remakes that improve on the original might be worth the time, money, and effort to produce (not to mention our hard-earned money to go see), but not this one! The original ""The Omen"" is a horror classic and one of the scariest movies of all time. There was no way they could have topped it. So why did they do it? Like in almost every horror movie, some characters die. The deaths in the original are, to say the least, imaginative. In the remake, the deaths are either watered down copies of the original or changed in such a way that they take away from the story or just aren't as effective, and one death near the beginning of the movie doesn't even make any sense. Who is this person and what does he have to do with anything? Absolutely no explanation, just a disembodied scene that has no connection whatsoever to the plot that I could see.The atmosphere in the original builds and builds, and is very creepy. In the remake, the atmosphere is kind of blah. And what about Damien? The kid says like three words in the entire movie. And he just doesn't have the presence of the little boy who played Damien in the original.There's a lot to gripe about and almost nothing good to say about this one. There's probably only one scene in the entire movie that I enjoyed, only because it looked a bit more realistic than in the original. But why pay money for only one scene? It's just not worth it.I can only hope that they don't remake ""Damien: Omen 2"", my personal favorite of the Omen trilogy (I don't count the fourth one they made with the little girl in the starring role of the AntiChrist, which is a joke).

1012691,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000HCO87C,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 12]","There are a couple of ""fan camps"" with regards to this film. First we have those that absolutely loved the original 1976 theatrical release starring Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, and Harvey Stephens (Damien) but despise this remake. Then there are those that haven't seen the `76 version  but have watched this one and found it adequate. And finally there are those who've watched both versions and like this one better than the original. So where do I stand?I'm firmly in the first group. Although I didn't think the `76 version was flawless, it did have some stellar acting, a great deal of psychological horror, and an interesting story. I'd never really thought about a remake. But oh Hollyweird has. That seems to be their bread-n-butter lately. From WAR OF THE WORLDS to KING KONG, everything is being ""updated"".But what about this film...Well, it has its moments but the flaws are glaring. Relying more on the sudden heart-pounding noise or attack, this version shied away from the psychological and went visceral. Not necessarily a bad thing; it just depends on your expectations. Personally, I was looking for the psych aspects but was woefully disappointed.Watching Mia Farrow was probably the most rewarding. She actually creeped me out. Being Damien's nanny and protector, she took her character all the way to the edge and left me hanging there, wondering if she'd push me over. But her acting was really the only adequate performance. Liev Schreiber (Robert Thorn) played as wooden a role as I've seen from him. By comparison, his performance in (again, another remake) THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was much more believable. Julia Styles is equally a sapling as Mrs. Thorn. And the worst acting came, unfortunately, from Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick (Damien). I don't like bashing child actors as I feel much of what they do isn't their fault; they simply follow direction. So to be more specific, the directing of Fitzpatrick was atrocious. Mostly he just stands there, staring at the camera, trying to put a mean scowl on his face ...and failing miserably.Being in the medical field, I also MUST comment on two specific events that were obviously not researched. First is the trailer we've all seen with Damien's first nanny standing on a roof with  rope looped around her neck yelling, ""Damien! Look at me! It's all for you, Damien!"" then jumping. Realistically her head would've come off, not just her shoes. The second is the hospital scene where Mia Farrow goes in to see Julia Styles and injects her intravenous line with a smidgin of air from a syringe. It would take huge syringes full of air to do any sort of damage and even then the effects would take a very long time before anything life-threatening came about.My biggest complaint, though, has to come from the poor script. Perhaps they were trying to appeal to multiple groups of movie-goers by putting in grotesque scenes with only a dash of the psychological. I don't know. But, for whatever reason, they decided to travel this route and I found it a terrible way to go. Neither worked and seemed to negate the other.",2,Which  Camp Are You In?,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,3087,"['are', 'couple', 'fan', 'camps', 'regards', 'film', 'First', 'have', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'original', '1976', 'theatrical', 'release', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Harvey', 'Stephens', 'Damien', 'despise', 'remake', 'Then', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '76', 'version', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'found', 'adequate', 'finally', 'are', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'versions', 'one', 'better', 'original', 'So', 'where', 'do', 'stand', ""'m"", 'firmly', 'first', 'group', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', '76', 'version', 'was', 'flawless', 'did', 'have', 'stellar', 'acting', 'great', 'deal', 'psychological', 'horror', 'interesting', 'story', ""'d"", 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'remake', 'oh', 'Hollyweird', 'be', 'bread-n-butter', 'lately', 'From', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'KING', 'KONG', 'everything', 'being', 'updated', '.But', 'what', 'film', 'Well', 'moments', 'flaws', 'are', 'glaring', 'Relying', 'more', 'sudden', 'heart-pounding', 'noise', 'attack', 'version', 'shied', 'away', 'psychological', 'went', 'visceral', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'expectations', 'Personally', 'was', 'looking', 'psych', 'aspects', 'was', 'woefully', 'disappointed.Watching', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'rewarding', 'actually', 'creeped', 'out', 'Being', 'Damien', 'nanny', 'protector', 'took', 'character', 'way', 'edge', 'left', 'hanging', 'there', 'wondering', ""'d"", 'push', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'adequate', 'performance', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'played', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'comparison', 'performance', 'again', 'remake', 'THE', 'MANCHURIAN', 'CANDIDATE', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'equally', 'sapling', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'worst', 'acting', 'came', 'unfortunately', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'Damien', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bashing', 'child', 'actors', 'feel', 'much', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'simply', 'follow', 'direction', 'So', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'directing', 'Fitzpatrick', 'was', 'atrocious', 'Mostly', 'just', 'there', 'staring', 'camera', 'trying', 'put', 'mean', 'scowl', 'face', 'failing', 'miserably.Being', 'medical', 'field', 'also', 'MUST', 'comment', 'two', 'specific', 'events', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'researched', 'First', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Damien', 'first', 'nanny', 'standing', 'roof', 'rope', 'looped', 'neck', 'yelling', 'Damien', 'Look', 'Damien', 'then', 'jumping', 'Realistically', 'head', 'would', ""'ve"", 'come', 'off', 'not', 'just', 'shoes', 'second', 'hospital', 'scene', 'where', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'see', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'intravenous', 'line', 'smidgin', 'air', 'syringe', 'would', 'take', 'huge', 'syringes', 'full', 'air', 'do', 'sort', 'damage', 'even', 'then', 'effects', 'would', 'take', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'anything', 'life-threatening', 'came', 'about.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'though', 'come', 'poor', 'script', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'trying', 'appeal', 'multiple', 'groups', 'movie-goers', 'putting', 'grotesque', 'scenes', 'only', 'dash', 'psychological', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reason', 'decided', 'travel', 'route', 'found', 'terrible', 'way', 'go', 'worked', 'seemed', 'negate', 'other']",N/A

The orginal film from 1976 is a classic. Its part of the un-holy triolgy of demonic horror films from the 70s (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen) no one can forget those. But as your watching the new version just get caught up in the story. Dont be so harsh.I love the original and I liked the remake. Its very faithful and equally creepy. The acting is good all around. The directing stands out overall, very stylish and sets a very strong mood. Watch out for a sinister Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock. This is also a good movie for people who havent seen the original. They will enjoy it. Regardless of what you think of the remake its nice to see a smart and creepy slow boil religious horror movie back on the big screen. On its own, The Omen 2006 is a good movie. Not a great one, but a very enjoyable and creepy film. Dont judge it to harshly just because you liked the original.

Fairbanks""","[1, 5]","A surprisingly effective remake of the 1976 occult thriller, ""The Omen"" is something of an improvement on the overrated original. For one, the acting is better. Liev Schreiber doesn't have Gregory Peck's dignified stoicism, but is more capable of expressing genuine fear and anguish, qualities more appropriate for a man who comes to realize he's playing daddy to the Antichrist. Julia Stiles is sympathetic as his wife, and Pete Postelthwaite is superb as the guilt-ridden priest determined to warn Schreiber of his son's true identity. And, in the role of the evil nanny, the casting of Mia Farrow, who unwittingly gave birth to Satan's son in the vastly superior ""Rosemary's Baby,"" is inspired.Director John Moore provides a mood that's eerier and more foreboding than the original, and, predictably, lays on the gore in ways that weren't possible thirty years earlier. The suicide by hanging, the most disturbing moment in Richard Donner's original, is memorably restaged, while the impaling and beheading that shocked audiences in 1976 are more graphic. Those who can't get enough of this kind of stuff should be happy with the DVD ""extras"" which include extended versions of the most violent scenes.It's been years since I saw the original, so I don't recall if it included a poem foretelling the coming of the Antichrist, but whenever it was recited here, I wondered if someone was attempting to pay homage to 1941's ""The Wolfman"" (""Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night..."").Brian W.

I really liked the original with Gregory Peck, I moderately liked part 2, I strongly disliked part 3, I found part 4 to be somewhat amusing -- how did the Devil all the sudden become a girl? -- and I really liked the remake with Liev Shreiber.Actually, I've seen some of these films more than once; I've seen the original several times, and I believe that it is one of the best horror movies ever, maybe just a notch below ""The Exorcist.""  Even this remake is really good, and in some ways you might even argue that it is ""better.""The special effects are surely better here than the original, although it's slightly unfair to use that as a criterion since it was made almost 30 years later.  Surely technology has improved.  I did like the fact also that this film remembers its title; there are probably more omens in this flick than the original as well; catch the guy in the red rain jacket running by the priest before the priest is killed.  And I really liked a scene with Julia Stiles where she is looking into a mirror and then is terrified of what she sees.  That scene was obviously influenced by and gives a nod to Stanley Kubrick's direction in ""The Shining.""This film also seems to push the idea a little more that little lies can grow to become bigger and bigger lies and problems as time goes on.  I felt that that theme was pushed a little harder here than the original, where I've always believed that a good theme can help hold a movie together for the viewer.But I'd recommend watching the original, and then watching this remake.

THE OMEN comes as close to being a shot-for-shot remake as any film since Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO, which makes the motives behind the film's making that much more clear. None of the deaths serve to shock or surprise, when they are all taken directly from the original without any reworking. John Moore directs based on David Seltzer's earlier screenplay as well, with few variations. Just in case anyone had any doubts after the ambiguous ending of Richard Donner's film, Moore has hired the evilest looking actor he could possibly find to fill the role of Damien. This, along with the unnecessary nightmare sequences, strips away what little mystery and suspense were left. Instead, we are left with a boring retread of the same exact film as played by a half-hearted cast.

Unfortunately, this film is seriously lacking in merits.Now, I understand that horror movies are unlike other movies.  Their primary purpose is to startle, creep-out and disturb.  So - if the dialogue is a little mannered, or if the characters aren't fully developed - well, these shortcomings can be forgiven ... but COME ON!  The dialogue in THE OMEN is *ridiculously* flat and uninspired.  I do not exaggerate when I say it is as if a high school student penned the script.  And, while Schrieber does a passable job with his role, Stiles generates one of the worst performances I have ever seen.  She should be embarrassed.  The one and only star performance is Farrow's; as the nanny, she is creepier than the anti-Christ child (and it did bring a smile to my face to see the star of ROSEMARY'S BABY cast in this film: nice touch).The sophomoric script and vapid acting wouldn't be as noticeable if the movie were actually scary.  Unfortunately, other than a few merely startling moments, there is nothing terrifying about this film.  Mind you, this is coming from a woman who rarely watches horror films and is very easily frightened.  I had nightmares after I watched DONNIE DARKO for the first time.  However, rather than squirm with anticipation (which is the effect most horror films have on me), I spent most of this movie rolling my eyes at the laughable script and poking holes in the story's logic (Are all tombs in Italy that easy to open?  How did the photographer know that the maternity ward was on the third floor?  Why would an attempted child-murderer get a funeral with full military honors?).To be fair, I did like the fact that THE OMEN attempted to create terror out of atmosphere and tension rather than out of violence and gore.  But the key word here is ""attempted.""  This movie was never able to create a sense of terror.Basically, this is a silly film.  The story is not very interesting.  The acting is weak.

1012699,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000HCO87C,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","For those of you keeping tabs on the slew of remakes invading Hollywood, you can cross another one off your list. ""The Omen""--originally released in 1976 and directed by Richard Donner--was a film I found to be quite overblown, the story and characterizations stretched a little too thin to do justice to the idea behind it. Now, thirty years later, we have John Moore's remake. I had my doubts going into the theater because I knew it was reinterpreting something that wasn't very good to begin with. But for whatever reason, this new version works. At least, it works for me. At first I couldn't understand why; this is a very faithful adaptation of a baffling film, and because of that, I expected this to be equally as disappointing.I have to admit that it was an entertaining reinterpretation. Unfortunately, the story had nothing to do with why I liked it; I think it had more to do with the film's style. It relied on pure atmosphere and mood to convey the impending terror that occurs. There are many moments encased in shadow, most of which are only lit by the occasional flash of lightening. We also get to look inside an open grave in Rome, a scene accentuated by snowy, dismally gray weather. Most importantly, we get subtle yet significant character expressions, most of which come from Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), the young but not innocent Devil incarnate. There's a moment when he's in a dimly lit kitchen fixing himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When his mother, Katherine (Julia Stiles), enters the room, he gives her one of the creepiest stares I've ever seen a child give.It also helped that most of the famous scenes from the original were brought back. These include Katherine falling from the upstairs landing, a priest getting impaled, and a nanny who inexplicably hangs herself. (""It's all for you, Damien!"" she shouts before jumping from the roof of the Thorns' sprawling London estate. No matter how hard I try, I still can't figure out why she did it or exactly what was all for him.) Even some of Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score finds its way into the remake. I suppose those of you devoted to the original film will find this troublesome, maybe even blasphemous (pardon the pun). When it comes to remakes, there's always been a fine line between a genuine update and an unimaginative rehash. Whether or not ""The Omen"" actually crosses that line is open for debate.That's because, despite the new cast and the impressive cinematography, the basic story is exactly the same. It beings when U.S. ambassador to Italy Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) arrives at the hospital to be by his pregnant wife's side (apparently, she went into a rather difficult labor). He runs into Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) when he arrives, and the priest gives him the bad news: the baby did not survive the delivery and Katherine will most likely never again be able to bear children. This is more than just devastating for Robert, it also puts extra pressure on him; Katherine still doesn't know what's happened, and now, he has to be the one to tell her. But Spiletto gives him another option. Another child was born that day, a boy whose mother tragically died during childbirth. As an added bonus, he has no other living family members. (Does the word ""convenient"" come to mind?) Robert decides to bring the boy to his wife and tell her that they have a beautiful new son who they name Damien.Everything goes smoothly for the family over the next five or so years. Then things start to go wrong when Robert's colleague--Ambassador Steven Haines (Marshall Cup)--is killed in an accident involving a leaking gas truck and a discarded cigarette (I'm sure you can imagine what happens). But life goes on, and the Thorns eventually move from Italy to London, taking residence in an obscenely large gothic mansion. For a short while, things continue to go smoothly. Then comes Damien's birthday, an almost gala event that brings scores of children and even larger scores of photographers. It also happens to be the same day when Damien's young nanny (Amy Huck) performs her suicidal stunt.And that's when everything starts to go downhill. The search for a new nanny yields the unexpected finding of Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), a seemingly friendly but somehow sinister woman who takes an uncomfortable liking to Damien. She also defies the authority of his parents, especially when it comes to keeping a mean spirited stray dog in the house. Strangely enough, this behavior made her a confusing character. I was bothered by the fact that I never really got a chance to know her; she just appears out of nowhere, and even though we know what her real intentions are, we don't know why she has them. I can only speculate that she belongs to some kind of opposing factor that sent her to the Thorns.Still, she does add a much-needed dose of tension into the story (especially in the scene when she hand feeds Damien strawberries; talk about tense). But Mrs. Baylock is only the start of the family's problems. Katherine eventually beings to notice certain things about Damien, things that other children don't seem to have to deal with. For one, she realizes that he's never once gotten sick, despite having a typically non-sterile childhood. But more importantly, he's become increasingly detached, always walking around with a blank expression and dark circles under his eyes. When she starts to have nightmares relating to her son, she knows for sure that something is wrong with him.Robert is noticing some strange things, as well. At one point, he runs into Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), a man who seems desperate to warn him about his son. Bluntly put, he believes Damien to be the son of the Devil, and he makes his case by quoting lyrical Bible passages. As you might expect, Robert is initially unwilling to listen to what Brennan has to say, even when he insists that Katherine is in danger. Only when she takes her bad fall does Robert begin to see the pieces falling into place. It's clear, even to Keith Jennings (David Thewlis), a mysterious photographer who sees the clues in his own pictures. Evil may in fact be living among us in the form of a young boy, and if there's to be any hope of saving humanity, his body and soul have to be destroyed.Thus begins a borderline obsessive mission, one that leads Robert and Keith from London to Rome and eventually to Isreal. Robert continually questions his own state of mind along the way, torn between believing his son is the Antichrist and the fact that he may be plotting the murder of an innocent young boy (even though we know the truth). In this sense, the writer is obviously skilled in depicting emotional turmoil. But despite the fact that I found the film's strong emotional core enticing, I think what most attracted me to it was its ad campaign (which, I realize, is not exactly meaningful).I remember seeing the first teaser trailer for it back in the spring, one of the creepiest, tensest teasers I've ever seen. It started with a shot of a dog sitting on a rusty-looking playground carousel. Then the camera slowly pans over to a young boy sitting on a swing set. At the end of the shot, he looks directly into the camera with a simple yet terrifying gaze in his eyes. I also remember seeing plenty of billboards for it. Like the teaser, none of them had the film's title; they only had the date (6-6-06, the cleverness of which faded a long time ago) and a couple of taglines (such as ""You have been warned,"" and ""The signs are all around us""). It's probably not a good thing when a film's ads are more impressive than the film itself. I liked this movie at the most superficial level, and because of that I can only recommend it for the way it looks, not for the story it tells.",4,Speak of the Devil: Another Horror

1012700,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B000HCO87C,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","Remaking classic horror films is not necessarily a modern phenomenon, but when done poorly, it can be a vile example of present day exploitation and a lack of imagination or artistry. Such is the example ofThe Fog (Widescreen Unrated Edition),Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is not the case with the 2006 film ""The Omen.""Trust me, there is no bigger fan of the 1976 horror blockbusterThe Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). I recall waiting in line for two hours to buy a ticket, having just read the David Seltzer bestsellerThe Omen. The film was rated R, and so my Dad impatiently waited in line with me, happy at least I had read a book. We were surrounded by teenagers and a long-haired theater employee was controlling the massive throng with a megaphone (I kid you not). Ah the glorious days before videos and cable TV, when faded posters of ""Planet of the Apes"" still hung on the wall. The eerie film did not disappoint, a well-crafted example of atmosphere, music (allowing composer Jerry Goldsmith to win his only Oscar -The Omen: Original Motion Picture Score (Deluxe Edition)) and a quartet of wonderful performances (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw).Was ""The Omen"" remake necessary? Nope. Is it good? Surprisingly so. The key is casting, and in every instance filmmakers succeeded. Liev Schreiber is perfect in the lead of Robert Thorn, with fine support provided by Julia Stiles as his fateful wife Katherine. An appealing couple on the political fast-track, they move to England where Robert will serve as ambassador. Katherine's child dies during birth and behind ominous closed doors, Robert accepts a newborn baby to raise. Unbeknown to the picturesque couple, he's the son of Satan. Damien - perhaps the most famous name in film history - seems innocent enough, with the exception of piercing eyes, coal-black hair and an annoying tendency to have people around him die horrible deaths. There's also the menacing Father Brennan (finely played by the late Peter Postlethwaite), showing up at inopportune times, freaking out the Thorns while spouting Latin about the antichrist.Robert realizes a great mystery is upon his hands and teams with photojournalist Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) to crack the case of Damien. Will they be able to stop Armageddon?! It's hard to take much of this seriously today, especially when Mia Farrow arrives on the scene as the creepiest caretaker since, well, Minnie Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby."" But by God, it's a well-made film and in many cases an improvement. The movie never plods like the original, is well-edited and has a superior sense of mood and atmosphere. It also takes full advantage of the creepy locales of Seltzer's novel. This is the best film of director John Moore's average career, and he shows an impressive respect for the source material. And yet, if you've seen the 1976 classic, you'll be overwhelmed by the strange sense of deja-vu, aided immeasurably by the 1978 sequelDamien: Omen 2, with William Holden and Lee Grant doing an essential retread of the original. Plus, there were two additional sequels (one of which,Omen III: The Final Conflict, gave us the fine Australian actor Sam Neill for the first time). Horror fans like myself have been there, done that.Oh well. The 2006 version of ""The Omen"" is an unusually excellent film, unjustly panned by numerous fans of the original. I can't argue with these devotees. But when placed alongside such terrible recent remakes asThe Haunting, it's a regularThe Bride of Frankenstein (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection).

It's intense, nicely photographed with excellent surround sound, and capably acted.For those of us who watched the original in 1976, the one that starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, we have to ask, ""What is the point of watching this?"" For us - at least most of us - the original is superior, but not by a wide margin, to be fair. I have no problem with remakes if they are not cheaply presented and I was entertained by this presentation even though I knew the story.In both films, the theology is laughable - pure Hollywood, and the priests in here are, too, being clueless about what ""grace"" and ""the cross"" are all about. Filmmakers generally won't deal with those topics, but they do a good job in making a case for Satan, I'll give them that. You saw a similar instance of this in ""The Exorcist.""It was interesting to see this with the updated technology both off (digital surround sound, etc.) and on the screen (laptop computers, cell phones, etc.) but the story is still similar enough that owning both of these films is questionable.

1012702,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000HCO87C,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 4]","For my 666 review I decided to take on the remake of `The Omen' which could turn itself into a horrible mistake for anyone who's the slightest bit superstitious, but luckily I'm not even remotely so I'll sleep more than fine tonight.This remake has received an awful lot of flak right off the bat for following a pattern similar to that of the 1998 `Psycho' remake, following the original script almost to the T raising the question, `why make a remake if it's shot for shot the original?'  Well, to answer that question it's for money.  A glossy new remake, regardless if the dialog is identical, will at least look far better than any film made in the 70's and in that respect `The Omen' succeeds with flying colors (one reviewer even mentioned his love of the colors used in this film and with that I must concur).As far as the complaint that young Fitzpatrick isn't quite scary enough, come on, we can't all be as creepy as say Cameron Bright (who I wish was younger and could have tackled this role...that kid is so freaking creepy).  But regardless, little Davey does a decent job at playing possessed.  Better suited for her role was the original Rosemary herself Mia Farrow who was excellently cast and proved to be the biggest highlight of the film.  As far as parents Stiles and Schreiber are concerned, I actually feel they deserve props for this, especially Julia who plays the troubled mother perfectly.  I really wish she would get the role of a lifetime that really takes her over the edge of stardom.  She's certainly talented enough.So bottom line is, while so many have already pointed out the un-necessity of this film, `The Omen' delivers enough scares and enough solid acting to warrant a watch through, and while it's not perfect and it may not be better than the original, it's no worse.",4,Sometimes shot-for-shot equals scare-for-scare,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,1810,"['666', 'review', 'decided', 'take', 'remake', 'Omen', 'could', 'turn', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'anyone', 'who', 'slightest', 'bit', 'superstitious', 'luckily', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'remotely', ""'ll"", 'sleep', 'more', 'fine', 'tonight.This', 'remake', 'received', 'awful', 'lot', 'flak', 'right', 'bat', 'following', 'pattern', 'similar', '1998', 'Psycho', 'remake', 'following', 'original', 'script', 'almost', 'T', 'raising', 'question', 'why', 'make', 'remake', 'shot', 'shot', 'original', 'Well', 'answer', 'question', 'money', 'A', 'glossy', 'new', 'remake', 'regardless', 'dialog', 'identical', 'will', 'least', 'look', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'made', '70', 'respect', 'Omen', 'flying', 'colors', 'one', 'reviewer', 'even', 'mentioned', 'love', 'colors', 'used', 'film', 'must', 'concur', '.As', 'far', 'complaint', 'young', 'Fitzpatrick', ""n't"", 'quite', 'scary', 'enough', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'as', 'creepy', 'say', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'who', 'wish', 'was', 'younger', 'could', 'have', 'tackled', 'role', 'kid', 'so', 'freaking', 'creepy', 'regardless', 'little', 'Davey', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'possessed', 'Better', 'suited', 'role', 'was', 'original', 'Rosemary', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'was', 'excellently', 'cast', 'proved', 'be', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'parents', 'Stiles', 'Schreiber', 'are', 'concerned', 'actually', 'feel', 'deserve', 'props', 'especially', 'Julia', 'who', 'troubled', 'mother', 'perfectly', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'role', 'lifetime', 'really', 'edge', 'stardom', 'certainly', 'talented', 'enough.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'un-necessity', 'film', 'Omen', 'delivers', 'enough', 'scares', 'enough', 'solid', 'acting', 'warrant', 'watch', 'not', 'perfect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'worse']",N/A

It is a remake of a 1976 classic by the same name.It is a very faithful remake.Maybe... too faithful. Allow me to explain.Films are more than plotlines, characters and dialogue. Like literature, they also have mood, tone and style. Again, like literature, there are certain time periods that have certain defining characteristics--Victorian literature feels distinct from literature produced during the Harlem Renaissance. With cinema, 70s movies feel different than 60s movies or 80s movies. They come from different cultures, different times, with different fears, hopes and beliefs.Taking a film from the 70s, like the Omen, and remaking it as faithfully as they have here, feels odd, watching it in a theater in 2006. It doesn't feel like a modern movie. It feels like a 70s movie because, in a lot of ways, it is. This is not to say that it is a bad film--many 70s movies were quite good, and the Omen is a pretty good film in any era. However, it rings slightly off to the modern ear; it arose from a culture and a society that has subsequently moved on. Stephen King, in his excellent Danse Macabre, argued that the evil in horror usually is a manifestation of what the culture currently finds frightening. In the 50s, we were worried about nuclear annihilation, and so most of our horror film threats were either from the skies or the results of science/radiation. A giant bug movie, made today, feels strange (unless it is a throwback parody, like Eight Legged Freaks). This movie, in recapturing a 70s film, is fighting against things that no longer frighten us in quite the same ways.The teenagers in the theater I saw the Omen in didn't need the academic explanation--they knew it was dated, too, and sniggered more often than screamed.Technically, this is a very good film. The acting is all fine, and the filming, direction, lighting, effects, etc., all serve their purposes. The stunt casting of Mia Farrow (who played Rosemary--mother of the Anti-Christ--in Rosemary's Baby, another 70s film) was genius, and she does not disappoint. She plays creepy to the hilt.All in all, this is a good movie and an incredibly faithful remake of a famous 70s film. The biggest drawback, perhaps, is that, by being so very faithful to the original, we've resulted with a movie that is slightly out of step with our current culture and rings slightly false to the modern ear. If you've never seen the original 70s movie, no need--for all intents and purposes, they've recreated it for you, here.",3,(Too) Faithful to the Original (?),1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2622,"['Omen', 'United', 'States', 'Ambassador', 'who', 'slowly', 'realize', 'son', 'Damien', 'actually', 'Anti-Christ', 'remake', '1976', 'classic', 'same', 'name.It', 'very', 'faithful', 'remake.Maybe', 'too', 'faithful', 'Allow', 'explain.Films', 'are', 'more', 'plotlines', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'literature', 'also', 'have', 'mood', 'tone', 'style', 'Again', 'literature', 'are', 'certain', 'time', 'periods', 'have', 'certain', 'defining', 'characteristics', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'feels', 'distinct', 'literature', 'produced', 'Harlem', 'Renaissance', 'cinema', '70s', 'movies', 'feel', 'different', '60s', 'movies', '80s', 'movies', 'come', 'different', 'cultures', 'different', 'times', 'different', 'fears', 'hopes', 'beliefs.Taking', 'film', '70s', 'Omen', 'remaking', 'as', 'faithfully', 'have', 'here', 'feels', 'odd', 'watching', 'theater', '2006', ""n't"", 'feel', 'modern', 'movie', '70s', 'movie', 'lot', 'ways', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'many', '70s', 'movies', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'Omen', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'era', 'However', 'slightly', 'modern', 'ear', 'arose', 'culture', 'society', 'subsequently', 'moved', 'Stephen', 'King', 'excellent', 'Danse', 'Macabre', 'argued', 'evil', 'horror', 'usually', 'manifestation', 'what', 'culture', 'currently', 'frightening', '50s', 'were', 'worried', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'so', 'most', 'horror', 'film', 'threats', 'were', 'either', 'skies', 'results', 'science/radiation', 'giant', 'bug', 'movie', 'made', 'today', 'feels', 'strange', 'throwback', 'parody', 'Eight', 'Legged', 'Freaks', 'movie', 'recapturing', '70s', 'film', 'fighting', 'things', 'longer', 'frighten', 'quite', 'same', 'ways.The', 'teenagers', 'theater', 'saw', 'Omen', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'academic', 'explanation', 'knew', 'was', 'dated', 'too', 'sniggered', 'more', 'often', 'screamed.Technically', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'fine', 'filming', 'direction', 'lighting', 'effects', 'etc.', 'serve', 'purposes', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'played', 'Rosemary', 'mother', 'Anti-Christ', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', '70s', 'film', 'was', 'genius', 'not', 'disappoint', 'creepy', 'hilt.All', 'good', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'faithful', 'remake', 'famous', '70s', 'film', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'perhaps', 'being', 'so', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', ""'ve"", 'resulted', 'movie', 'slightly', 'step', 'current', 'culture', 'rings', 'slightly', 'false', 'modern', 'ear', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', '70s', 'movie', 'need', 'intents', 'purposes', ""'ve"", 'recreated', 'here']",N/A

With very nice scenery {particularly the foggy lake}, camera angles, and current environments. Of note, there are 666's all over this film from addresses to even the wallpaper in Damien's room. The floor in the main foyer in the Thorn house had a three-dimensional effect.It was also funny to note some of Damien's drawings on the wall, which included the hanged nanny and a black devil with his name scribbled thereon.It is also interesting to note events which were tied in to prophesies, such as 9/11, the Louisiana tsunami, and the space-shuttle explosion, which were said to preceed the emergence of The Antichrist in Judeo-Christian mythology.Great musical score as well.Character comparisons:* Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick makes for a great Damien, diabolically cute with deep blue eyes and a bit thinner than the original, but a great characterization nonetheless.* Mia Farrow makes for a great Mrs. Balog, and the fact that she is a recognizable Rosemary Woodhouse made for a really amusing consideration and casting.* Liev Shreiber as Mr. Thorn: Works relatively well. although a bit more subdued than the remarkable portrayal by Gregory Peck.* Julia Stiles as Mrs. Thorn: Attractive, yet a bit too 'modelesque', and child-like. Which is understandable, considering it was Mia Farrow who recommended her for the role.* Bugenheigen is given a briefly minimal role, with the Megiddo daggers not as artistic in design as the originals, which are crucifixes, whereas these are stylized crosses with the ""I'm Nailed Right In"" acronym on the hilt.* The hellhounds were exceptional, beautiful canines all.Notable scene differences:* The Zoo: this film displays an indoor zoo, where a gorilla almost breaks through his glass enclosure.* Decapitation scene: Instead of a shard of glass, a metal railing comes loose, swings topsy-turvy, and provides for a graphic scene worthy of the original.* Of note, the priest impalement scene is impressive, with a bit more gore added.* Nanny Hanging Suicide: She does not crash through the window, but instead thuds against the wall, with her fallen shoe providing the shattering glass element.* The Graveyard scene: A huge inverted cross thrust into the earth, essentially creating a dominant mass effect.Overall, a 'modernized' variation not quite comparable to the original, but again, a stand out remake well done.Also on this DVD, the Revelation 666 presentation featuring Reverend Moore, Behind-the-scenes footage, making-of featurettes of the film and the score, director and cast commentary.",4,The Return of Damien on 6/6/6,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,2791,"['My', 'opinion', 'as', 'far', 'remakes', 'go', 'one', 'own', 'pretty', 'well', 'exception', 'couple', 'small', 'variations', 'own', 'interesting', 'twists', 'relatively', 'made', 'own', 'verson', 'instead', 'replicating', 'original', 'identically', 'very', 'nice', 'scenery', 'particularly', 'foggy', 'lake', 'camera', 'angles', 'current', 'environments', 'note', 'are', '666', 'film', 'addresses', 'even', 'wallpaper', 'Damien', 'room', 'floor', 'main', 'foyer', 'Thorn', 'house', 'had', 'three-dimensional', 'effect.It', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'note', 'Damien', 'drawings', 'wall', 'included', 'hanged', 'nanny', 'black', 'devil', 'name', 'scribbled', 'thereon.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'events', 'were', 'tied', 'prophesies', 'such', '9/11', 'Louisiana', 'tsunami', 'space-shuttle', 'explosion', 'were', 'said', 'preceed', 'emergence', 'Antichrist', 'Judeo-Christian', 'mythology.Great', 'musical', 'score', 'well.Character', 'comparisons', '*', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'great', 'Damien', 'diabolically', 'cute', 'deep', 'blue', 'eyes', 'bit', 'thinner', 'original', 'great', 'characterization', 'nonetheless', '*', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'great', 'Mrs.', 'Balog', 'fact', 'recognizable', 'Rosemary', 'Woodhouse', 'made', 'really', 'amusing', 'consideration', 'casting', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', 'Mr.', 'Thorn', 'relatively', 'well', 'bit', 'more', 'subdued', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'Gregory', 'Peck', '*', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'Attractive', 'yet', 'bit', 'too', ""'modelesque"", 'child-like', 'Which', 'understandable', 'considering', 'was', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'recommended', 'role', '*', 'Bugenheigen', 'given', 'briefly', 'minimal', 'role', 'Megiddo', 'daggers', 'not', 'artistic', 'design', 'originals', 'are', 'crucifixes', 'are', 'stylized', 'crosses', ""'m"", 'Nailed', 'Right', 'acronym', 'hilt', '*', 'hellhounds', 'were', 'exceptional', 'beautiful', 'canines', 'all.Notable', 'scene', 'differences', '*', 'Zoo', 'film', 'indoor', 'zoo', 'where', 'gorilla', 'almost', 'glass', 'enclosure', '*', 'Decapitation', 'scene', 'Instead', 'shard', 'glass', 'metal', 'railing', 'loose', 'swings', 'topsy-turvy', 'graphic', 'scene', 'worthy', 'original', '*', 'note', 'priest', 'impalement', 'scene', 'impressive', 'bit', 'more', 'gore', 'added', '*', 'Nanny', 'Hanging', 'Suicide', 'not', 'crash', 'window', 'instead', 'thuds', 'wall', 'fallen', 'shoe', 'providing', 'shattering', 'glass', 'element', '*', 'Graveyard', 'scene', 'huge', 'inverted', 'cross', 'thrust', 'earth', 'essentially', 'creating', 'dominant', 'mass', 'effect.Overall', ""'modernized"", 'variation', 'not', 'quite', 'comparable', 'original', 'again', 'stand', 'out', 'remake', 'well', 'done.Also', 'DVD', 'Revelation', '666', 'presentation', 'featuring', 'Reverend', 'Moore', 'Behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'film', 'score', 'director', 'cast', 'commentary']",N/A

It's not a big huge to me.  But I do mind things like the ridiculous use of red to announce ""something BAD is about to happen""  Properly used, like in 6th Sense, color cues are amazing, like soft touches of a single strand paint brush.

1012716,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000HCO87C,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 1]","An American Diplomat living in the UK, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) and his wife Katherine, (Julia Stiles) have their lives turned upside down when strange occurrences begin to plague their lives and all seem to be connected to their son, Damien Thorn, who may be the antichrist as foretold in the book of Revelations. The evil forces that are protecting this spawn of Lucifer will do anything to protect his identity and death befalls anyone who dares to investigate this secret.This better than expected remake of the 1976 horror film is technically well done with good performances from the ensemble cast and offers some unnerving imagery and tone. Since this is almost a by the numbers remake of the original, there is very little suspense. Those who have seen the original already know what is going to happen to these characters and to keep them interested, they updated the material (linking the return of the antichrist to today's current events) and inserted a couple of nifty dream sequences which are brief but effective and in one instance, incredibly hair-raising (Robert Thorn's brief dream in Italy- Gotta Love that smiling Priest). I also noticed there is an emphasis on the color red throughout- red flowers, red fruits, characters draped in red cloaks, red night gowns and in one genuinely scary scene, a person draped in red, runs across the screen in the distance just as one of the characters is about to meet their end. Some may find this in your face symbolism a bit too heavy handed but I found it effective.Although the performances were good, I did find the cast a little too young to be truly believable in their roles. There was a maturity and a certain air of sophistication the 2 original leads conveyed that is missing here. However both lead actors still managed to turn in solid performances. I especially liked Julia Stiles. Her take on Kate Thorn differs from Lee Remick's. Stiles gives us a more distant Katherine. One who comes under suspicion of her offspring quite early on and never manages to let go. She seems extremely annoyed by him and once convinced of his malice, she is consumed by fear and paranoia. Despite of what some detractors say, I found her performance the most believable of the bunch and her character, although a lot more rougher around the edges than Lee Remick's portrayal, managed to induce real sympathy. She is after all a victim. Another stand out was Mia Farrow who plays Mrs. Baylock minus the accent. Billie Whitelaw who played the original was sinister enough and resembled a brutally demented Mary Poppins. Farrow's take on this character is still charming but her wickedness is less obvious. Although I do love her sinister smile as she feeds Damien his strawberries just before the vicious little demon gets on his scooter of doom and rides it towards his unsuspecting mother.My only disappointment in the casting was with the choice of Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. Admittedly, he is a creepy kid but he fails to convey that innocence that Harvey Stephens, the original Damien had. What I loved about the original, was that Damien, at times, looked angelic and seemed unaware of the chaos that was taking place around him. It was as if he wasn't fully conscious of who he was yet the creepy characters around him made it clear to us that he was the devils offspring. Evil is at its most scary when it comes wrapped in childish innocence. Davey-Fitzpatrick is creepy from the get-go. Another major disappointment was with Marco Beltrami's score. It is good enough but when you are competing with Jerry Goldsmith's original, you better out-do yourself and in this case, the score fails to deliver the chilling magic of the original. The death sequences are pretty standard. They are carbon copies of the original (with the exception of Kate's grisly demise and the photographers decapitation is executed differently) so not much to report here.Overall, the movie is good but when compared to Donner's original, it is inferior. You can say the same about the cast. They do their best but comparing them to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is not exactly fair (although I did like Stiles) and despite some new elements added- the dream sequences, the hooded demon dog cameos etc and higher, glossier production values, ""The Omen"" (2006) will forever remain inferior, at least in my eyes, to the greater original visualization of hell on earth.",3,Nicely Done Remake of a Horror Classic Still Manages to Induce Fear But the Original Remains Superior,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,4415,"['American', 'Diplomat', 'living', 'UK', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'have', 'lives', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'begin', 'plague', 'lives', 'seem', 'be', 'connected', 'son', 'Damien', 'Thorn', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'antichrist', 'foretold', 'book', 'Revelations', 'evil', 'forces', 'are', 'protecting', 'spawn', 'Lucifer', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'identity', 'death', 'befalls', 'anyone', 'who', 'investigate', 'secret.This', 'better', 'expected', 'remake', '1976', 'horror', 'film', 'technically', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'unnerving', 'imagery', 'tone', 'almost', 'numbers', 'remake', 'original', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'characters', 'keep', 'interested', 'updated', 'material', 'linking', 'return', 'antichrist', 'today', 'current', 'events', 'inserted', 'couple', 'nifty', 'dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'brief', 'effective', 'one', 'instance', 'incredibly', 'hair-raising', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'brief', 'dream', 'Italy-', 'Got', 'Love', 'smiling', 'Priest', 'also', 'noticed', 'emphasis', 'color', 'red', 'throughout-', 'red', 'flowers', 'red', 'fruits', 'characters', 'draped', 'red', 'cloaks', 'red', 'night', 'gowns', 'one', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'scene', 'person', 'draped', 'red', 'screen', 'distance', 'just', 'one', 'characters', 'meet', 'end', 'may', 'find', 'face', 'symbolism', 'bit', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'found', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'did', 'find', 'cast', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'truly', 'believable', 'roles', 'was', 'maturity', 'certain', 'air', 'sophistication', '2', 'original', 'leads', 'conveyed', 'missing', 'here', 'However', 'lead', 'actors', 'still', 'managed', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'especially', 'liked', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'take', 'Kate', 'Thorn', 'differs', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Stiles', 'more', 'distant', 'Katherine', 'One', 'who', 'suspicion', 'offspring', 'quite', 'early', 'never', 'manages', 'let', 'go', 'extremely', 'annoyed', 'once', 'convinced', 'malice', 'consumed', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'what', 'detractors', 'say', 'found', 'performance', 'most', 'believable', 'bunch', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'rougher', 'edges', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'portrayal', 'managed', 'induce', 'real', 'sympathy', 'victim', 'stand', 'out', 'was', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'Mrs.', 'Baylock', 'minus', 'accent', 'Billie', 'Whitelaw', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'was', 'sinister', 'enough', 'resembled', 'brutally', 'demented', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Farrow', 'take', 'character', 'still', 'charming', 'wickedness', 'less', 'obvious', 'do', 'love', 'sinister', 'smile', 'Damien', 'strawberries', 'just', 'vicious', 'little', 'demon', 'scooter', 'doom', 'unsuspecting', 'mother.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'casting', 'was', 'choice', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'Damien', 'Admittedly', 'creepy', 'kid', 'convey', 'innocence', 'Harvey', 'Stephens', 'original', 'Damien', 'had', 'What', 'loved', 'original', 'was', 'Damien', 'times', 'looked', 'angelic', 'seemed', 'unaware', 'chaos', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'conscious', 'who', 'was', 'yet', 'creepy', 'characters', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'devils', 'offspring', 'Evil', 'most', 'scary', 'when', 'wrapped', 'childish', 'innocence', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'creepy', 'get-go', 'major', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'score', 'good', 'enough', 'when', 'are', 'competing', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'original', 'better', 'out-do', 'yourself', 'case', 'score', 'deliver', 'chilling', 'magic', 'original', 'death', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'are', 'carbon', 'copies', 'original', 'exception', 'Kate', 'grisly', 'demise', 'photographers', 'decapitation', 'executed', 'differently', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'report', 'here.Overall', 'movie', 'good', 'when', 'compared', 'Donner', 'original', 'inferior', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'cast', 'do', 'best', 'comparing', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'not', 'exactly', 'fair', 'did', 'Stiles', 'new', 'elements', 'added-', 'dream', 'sequences', 'hooded', 'demon', 'dog', 'cameos', 'etc', 'higher', 'glossier', 'production', 'values', 'Omen', '2006', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'inferior', 'least', 'eyes', 'greater', 'original', 'visualization', 'hell', 'earth']",N/A

1012718,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HCO87C,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Remembering the 1976 new film THE OMEN this viewer recalls someone making a dog growling sound in the parking lot at movie's end and how that effect sent gasps and chills through those who had just witnessed Damien and his dogs - a sign of a thoroughly successful thriller.  Now thirty years later (and having the original effect watered down by the subsequent three sequels) out comes a remake of THE OMEN and once again the story and production values of the film jolt even the more staid viewers.  Armageddon now seems frightfully at hand!Though the script is essentially intact form the original version, this OMEN is cast with actors who make the story more credible because they imbue it with more humanly drawn character interpretations.  Much of the power of the film lies in the superb performance by Liev Schreiber as the politically important father of a 'stillborn' son that was 'exchanged' at birth: he gives a warmth and honesty that were elusive in Gregory Peck's performance. Much the same can be said about Pete Postlethwaite's tormented priest who tries to alter the events threatened if the 'adopted' strange son Damien is allowed to mature, and to David Thewlis as the photographer who helps Schreiber's character come to grips with the decision he made about child swapping on the day of the birth of Damien.  Mia Farrow, cosmetically enhanced to look oddly young, is the smarmy nanny and Michael Chabon gives a bit of class to the priest with the dreaded secrets on how to end the impending destruction if Damien is allowed to live.  The weak link in the cast is Julia Stiles who here just can't seem to inhabit the role of the increasingly terrified mother of Damien: likewise the child selected to portray Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) appears more a makeup artist's vision rather than a child whose apparent normalcy could have made the evil within more terrifying.The special effects are used well as is a musical score by Marco Beltrami (though not nearly as memorable as that by Jerry Goldsmith in the original).  An interesting finding is that the original 6-year-old actor portraying Damien (Harvey Stephens) is cast in a tiny part here as a tabloid reporter, giving the feeling that the spirit of Damien is still pervasive.  Director John Moore gets most of right. Not a bad movie as many have stated and one that certainly could have been more powerful with some casing changes, but this film still causes the jitters in an otherwise tranquil evening!

Playing an update on the Laurence Harvey character in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" he showed as much emotion as one of those My Buddy dolls that single women keep in their cars to scare away carjackers.  Mr. Schreiber is similarly emotive in his update of the role originated by Gregory Peck in the 1976 classic.  To attempt to take over a role from the inimitable Gregory Peck is either incredibly brave or incredibly insane.  Mr. Schreiber is no Gregory Peck.  Audiences accepted Peck as a senior statesman because the man looked the part and certainly had the voice for it.  In this version, Liev's Robert Thorn comes by his post of US Ambassador to Great Britain by dint of being the President's godson, and not his own personal charisma or ability.  Nepotism is about the only 'update' this 'update' manages, and it's called for, because besides being absent a personality, Mr. Schreiber is too young to have risen so high in the diplomatic corps on his own merits.Julia Stiles also struggles in her attempt to reprise Lee Remick's role as the doomed Mrs. Thorn.  I have always liked Ms. Stiles as one of our most promising young actresses, but this part does not serve her at all. At 25, and looking more like 16 with her round face, despite the matronly hairdos and outfits meant to give her sophistication, she is not credible either, as the wife of an ambassador.The supporting roles fare better, particularly Pete Postletwaite as the doomed priest, though one scratches her head at the presence of David Thewlis.  Mr. Thewlis is a pretty hefty star nowadays & thanks to Harry Potter is well-known even to Americans.  His slacker photographer character has a tiny role and could have been played by anybody.  The standout is definitely Mia Farrow, having some campy fun as the nanny/guardian.  She appears to be the only one having any fun.Seamus Whatisname as the kid is adequate.  Since the poor kid never has any lines but is only called upon to stare at the camera with big blue eyes, he can hardly be faulted for bad acting.

So here, hellish dogs in a cemetery don't just threaten and terrify, they physically lock on to Liev Schrieber. That's the pattern throughout -- ratchet things up, hope for the best, or the worst in this case. The air of foreboding and menace in the original is traded here for thin thrills, more gore.The movie suffers further from a poor cast poorly directed. Schrieber, Stiles, and Farrow have done good stuff. Here, all seem wooden, emotionless, cardboard cutouts. Stiles is utterly devoid of presence. Schrieber (39, and the best of the lot, but too young to plausibly be ambassador) and Stiles (25 at release) are both too young for their roles. This is the kind of casting decision that's made solely for marketing.Schrieber is an excellent actor, though he doesn't have the sheer force of presence that Gregory Peck brought to every role.

However, in all honesty I found myself enjoying this film. Sure, it IS a remake of a well known horror classic and blah, blah, blah.... the remakes are never as good as the classics. We all know this, right? The only problem I had with this movie was that everyone on screen seemed to be slightly autistic and/or just lacking in common sense... especially the father... I dunno, maybe he wouldn't have come off this way if it hadn't been for the actor who played him... His portrayal of this character was blatantly sexist and I am tired of seeing Hollywood stereotype dad's as being either deadbeats, inept losers, or just retards who need it spelled out for them in bold print that their son is the antichrist. I am sorry, but someone actually decided to make this guy the ambassador? Seriously, I don't know if he could have held a management job at K-marts much less a job of any actual importance.... ::Shrug::Other than that, this film had me going for a minute when I actually thought that they may kill a kid on screen. If they had killed a kid, then this film would have automatically been an instant classic for actually having some balls, unlike most Hollywood horror films that come off like cheap romantic comedies with blood in them... But, of course, the kid gets away in the end and evil lives on for another day.... All thanks to our favorite imbecile of a father, too. I guess that's okay, too, but don't expect any sequels because from what I heard this film tanked big time at the box office.Oh yeah, and this was the first film to actually make me ""jump out of my seat"" in years. I have a seen a ton of horror films... everything ranging from the worst of video nasties to all of the old time cult favorites... and none of them have ever made me jump, but this humble little remake did.... Another plus, I guess.Pros:Some spooky moments.A dog tells a woman to hang herself... Probably the best part of the entire movie.Some pretty brutal death scenes.Religious nuts are truly portrayed as being what they are... whack jobs. About time, I say.A pretty cool devil looking thing shows up during the flashback/dream scenes.The annoying overly needy, blubbering crybaby wife dies.Evil wins in the end. The good guys all die.The kid was not too annoying... Nice to see a movie with a kid that actually shuts his mouth for a change (but certainly doesn't do what he's told). I guess this movie was just one big metaphor for how spoiled brats and rich kids are the epitome of all evil.Cons:This movie was sexist against men by portraying them as being inept sissies who cower in the face of evil.The only man to actually have a pair of balls and a functioning brain gets brutally decapitated.Littered with cheesy/boring family life scenes that should have been cut from the film.Contains some pretty atrocious acting.No female nudity. Not really a big deal, but this always helps a bad horror film get at least an extra star or two.No child deaths... but plenty of the women ones make up for this....That's about it.",3,Not as bad as I thought it would be....,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3178,"['Most', 'online', 'hearsay', 'had', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'atrocity', 'mankind', 'everyone', 'involved', 'should', 'be', 'executed', 'immediately', 'However', 'honesty', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'Sure', 'remake', 'well', 'known', 'horror', 'classic', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'remakes', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'classics', 'know', 'right', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'everyone', 'screen', 'seemed', 'be', 'slightly', 'autistic', 'and/or', 'just', 'lacking', 'common', 'sense', 'especially', 'father', 'dunno', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'off', 'way', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'portrayal', 'character', 'was', 'blatantly', 'sexist', 'am', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Hollywood', 'stereotype', 'dad', 'being', 'deadbeats', 'inept', 'losers', 'just', 'retards', 'who', 'need', 'spelled', 'out', 'bold', 'print', 'son', 'antichrist', 'am', 'sorry', 'someone', 'actually', 'decided', 'make', 'guy', 'ambassador', 'Seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have', 'held', 'management', 'job', 'K-marts', 'much', 'less', 'job', 'actual', 'importance', ':Shrug', ':Other', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'minute', 'when', 'actually', 'thought', 'may', 'kill', 'kid', 'screen', 'had', 'killed', 'kid', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'automatically', 'been', 'instant', 'classic', 'actually', 'having', 'balls', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'cheap', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'blood', 'course', 'kid', 'away', 'end', 'evil', 'lives', 'day', 'thanks', 'favorite', 'imbecile', 'father', 'too', 'guess', 'okay', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sequels', 'what', 'heard', 'film', 'tanked', 'big', 'time', 'box', 'office.Oh', 'yeah', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'actually', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'ton', 'horror', 'films', 'everything', 'ranging', 'worst', 'video', 'nasties', 'old', 'time', 'cult', 'favorites', 'none', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'jump', 'humble', 'little', 'remake', 'did', 'guess.Pros', 'spooky', 'moments.A', 'dog', 'woman', 'hang', 'Probably', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie.Some', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'death', 'scenes.Religious', 'nuts', 'are', 'truly', 'portrayed', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'whack', 'jobs', 'time', 'say.A', 'pretty', 'cool', 'devil', 'looking', 'thing', 'up', 'flashback/dream', 'scenes.The', 'annoying', 'overly', 'needy', 'blubbering', 'crybaby', 'wife', 'dies.Evil', 'end', 'good', 'guys', 'die.The', 'kid', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'annoying', 'Nice', 'see', 'movie', 'kid', 'actually', 'mouth', 'change', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'told', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'metaphor', 'how', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'rich', 'kids', 'are', 'epitome', 'evil.Cons', 'movie', 'was', 'sexist', 'men', 'portraying', 'being', 'inept', 'sissies', 'who', 'cower', 'face', 'evil.The', 'only', 'man', 'actually', 'have', 'pair', 'balls', 'functioning', 'brain', 'brutally', 'decapitated.Littered', 'cheesy/boring', 'family', 'life', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'film.Contains', 'pretty', 'atrocious', 'acting.No', 'female', 'nudity', 'Not', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'always', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', 'get', 'least', 'extra', 'star', 'two.No', 'child', 'deaths', 'plenty', 'women', 'ones', 'make', 'up', '.That']",N/A

Cute-looking kid, but had the right look for the film to be believable as a bad boy.In this 2006 film, Harvey Stephens makes a cameo appearance as the first tabloid reporter to speak to Liev Schreiber and asks, ""Was she on drugs, Ambassador?""Let me go out on a limb and say, if you have not seen the originalThe Omen(1976), you probably will not know what the hell is going on.Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) goes to the hospital on June 6 where his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) has just given birth to a baby boy. Robert is told his baby has died. With the help of the priest, Robert accepts another baby boy that has no parents.  He never tells his wife that their son had died.  it stays a secret between the priest and Robert.By the time Damien is 6 years old (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), he is already showing a spiteful side of himself.  At his 6th birthday party, Damien celebrates his birthday in a big way at his father's mansion. Robert is now an Ambassador. A mysterious black german shepherd watches from afar. Suddenly the nanny (Amy Huck) calls out to Damien to get his attention.  She jumps off the building with a noose around her neck and kills herself gladly in front of all the children.A photographer, Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) and Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) both warn Robert Thorn of the evil surrounding him.A new nanny arrives, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) who wants to care for and protect Damien.  She is on the devil's side.This film never brings across the evilness this nanny has as they did so effectively (with goosebumps) in the Richard Donner version of 1976.By all means, please see the sequel to ""The Omen which isDamien: Omen II.

Some of the folks knocking this version, saying it's so much worse than the original, should realize that most of the flaws here are merely inherited ones. Essentially, both versions are deliberately paced, slightly melodramatic, B-horror stories. What makes both versions of the ""Omen"" noteworthy are the rich production values and solid acting all around. Mia Farrow, as many have noted, contributes an excellent performance as a sort of antiMaryPoppins. As Farrow starred in the seminal '60s horror film ""Rosemary's Baby,"" her presence here lends this remake a solid pedigree. Liev Schreiber doesn't have the name recognition of the original's star, Gregory Peck, but I've always thought he was an above-par actor. His portrayal of the unluckiest dad on the planet is honest, and he ain't bad-looking either. The kid, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, is great. Able to conjure up innocence and evil, both quite convincingly. Of the whole cast, I have to say Julia Stiles is probably the weak link. But I still feel bad for her when she gets offed.

1012729,A72A8JDQK4D8S,B000HCO87C,John A. Lind,"[1, 1]","This review is not about the DVD or Blu-ray, it's about the film itself. I received an Amazon Instant Video rental of the 2006 remake free when I bought a Blu-ray of the original 1976 classic with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick from Amazon . . . a welcome feature they offer free with the purchase of many of their Blu-rays. Was a bit puzzled at first and a quick search of Amazon revealed they do not have the 1976 version in their Instant Video catalog, only the 2006 remake. Viewed it streamed to my (modest) home theater Blu-ray player and 46"" 1080p HDTV. I have a very high speed connection and home network; viewing was not quite as crisp as a well done Blu-ray, but better looking with less noticeable compression than my local Comcast cable service would deliver, and certainly much better than a DVD (even with the player's upscaling). So much for the technical aspects, for which I'd give it 4.5 stars.This gets 3 stars because this 2006 remake is not up to the level of suspense and palpable tension generated and delivered by the original 1976. I would be wondering why bothering to remake The Omen, except it's obvious as with other recent remakes (e.g. Psycho) that the producers and studios are hoping to turn profits on them by leveraging on the reputations of the original classics. The Omen was not adapted from any novel or short story (the novel was written from the screenplay and released just before the original film for marketing the film). This remake is, at best, an ""update"" with near zero revision of the original screenplay incorporating the current technologies of personal laptop computers, cell phones, etc. Overall it's a solid workman-like product without any serious flaws, but it doesn't emotionally deliver the sense of horror and dread the original does, even now, as I've also viewed the original again, after seeing this one. The acting of Liev Schreiber (Ambassador Thorn) and Julia Stiles (Mrs. Thorn) is good, but it's not the chemistry or level of Peck and Remick. There's no comparison between the two Damien's. The 2006 iteration leaves much to be desired as he clearly does not have or express near the evil ominousness of the 1976 Damien. Was it the casting, directing, or a combination of the two? How the 2006 actor delivers in future films will tell. The one standout is the nanny, Mrs. Blaylock, played by Mia Farrow. Her facial expressions, mannerisms and dialog delivery very clearly portray the evil ominousness Damien lacks. Remaking or updating a standout classic is high risk for everyone, the studio, producers, actors and director(s). In this one, they did not fail (other than Damien IMHO), but they clearly did not rise to nearly the level of the original, which is sad. Even without the original to compare and contrast, this film would never have garnered any Academy, BAFTA or Golden Globe nominations, but it would have fared OK in its genre with mixed to mildly positive critical response. It's the presence and comparative power of the original that has justifiably generated the mildly negative critical response to the remake.See the original, and if you're going to buy one, buy the original, it's better overall. Rent this one for a rainy night and appreciate Mia Farrow's nanny portrayal.",3,Solid Workman-Like Remake But **NOT** Up To The Original,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,3259,"['review', 'not', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'film', 'received', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'rental', '2006', 'remake', 'free', 'when', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'original', '1976', 'classic', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Amazon', 'welcome', 'feature', 'offer', 'free', 'purchase', 'many', 'Blu-rays', 'Was', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'first', 'quick', 'search', 'Amazon', 'revealed', 'do', 'not', 'have', '1976', 'version', 'Instant', 'Video', 'catalog', 'only', '2006', 'remake', 'Viewed', 'streamed', 'modest', 'home', 'theater', 'Blu-ray', 'player', '46', '1080p', 'HDTV', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'speed', 'connection', 'home', 'network', 'viewing', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'crisp', 'well', 'done', 'Blu-ray', 'better', 'looking', 'less', 'noticeable', 'compression', 'local', 'Comcast', 'cable', 'service', 'would', 'deliver', 'certainly', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'even', 'player', 'upscaling', 'So', 'much', 'technical', 'aspects', ""'d"", 'give', '4.5', 'stars.This', '3', 'stars', '2006', 'remake', 'not', 'up', 'level', 'suspense', 'palpable', 'tension', 'generated', 'delivered', 'original', '1976', 'would', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'bothering', 'remake', 'Omen', 'obvious', 'other', 'recent', 'remakes', 'e.g', 'Psycho', 'producers', 'studios', 'are', 'hoping', 'turn', 'profits', 'leveraging', 'reputations', 'original', 'classics', 'Omen', 'was', 'not', 'adapted', 'novel', 'short', 'story', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'screenplay', 'released', 'just', 'original', 'film', 'marketing', 'film', 'remake', 'best', 'update', 'near', 'zero', 'revision', 'original', 'screenplay', 'incorporating', 'current', 'technologies', 'personal', 'laptop', 'computers', 'cell', 'phones', 'etc', 'Overall', 'solid', 'workman-like', 'product', 'serious', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'deliver', 'sense', 'horror', 'dread', 'original', 'even', 'now', ""'ve"", 'also', 'viewed', 'original', 'again', 'seeing', 'one', 'acting', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Ambassador', 'Thorn', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'good', 'not', 'chemistry', 'level', 'Peck', 'Remick', 'comparison', 'two', 'Damien', '2006', 'iteration', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'clearly', 'not', 'have', 'express', 'evil', 'ominousness', '1976', 'Damien', 'Was', 'casting', 'directing', 'combination', 'two', 'How', '2006', 'actor', 'delivers', 'future', 'films', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'standout', 'nanny', 'Mrs.', 'Blaylock', 'played', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'dialog', 'delivery', 'very', 'clearly', 'portray', 'evil', 'ominousness', 'Damien', 'Remaking', 'updating', 'standout', 'classic', 'high', 'risk', 'everyone', 'studio', 'producers', 'actors', 'director', 's', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'other', 'Damien', 'IMHO', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'rise', 'nearly', 'level', 'original', 'sad', 'Even', 'original', 'compare', 'contrast', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'BAFTA', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'OK', 'genre', 'mixed', 'mildly', 'positive', 'critical', 'response', 'presence', 'comparative', 'power', 'original', 'justifiably', 'generated', 'mildly', 'negative', 'critical', 'response', 'remake.See', 'original', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'one', 'buy', 'original', 'better', 'overall', 'Rent', 'one', 'rainy', 'night', 'appreciate', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'nanny', 'portrayal']",N/A

What next remake Jaws, The Godfather, or Caddyshack? Hollywood is so boring anymore. As for this film, yeah it works, if you haven't seen the original, but otherwise the best marketing gimmick was releasing it on 6/6/06.

The acting feels flat exception being Mia Farrow and Giovanni Lombardo Radice (aka John Morghen of Italian horror explotation fame) and there's nothing scary about it like the original. It just feels like one epic fail here as i should say that some movies like the original and Psycho just don't need improving upon and if their plan of attack is to remake an already successful original by using a shot-to-shot script-by-script carbon copy clone remake then don't be surprise when they fail miserably, if we wanted to see the original movie we'd watch it.

1012733,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B000HCO87C,Joker,"[1, 2]","We are living in the Age of Horror Movie Remakes.  So, here's yet another classic horror movie that was remade.  I'll be honest - this movie didn't need to be remade.  The original 1976 movie is a classic in the horror movie genre (see my 5-star review).  But, the fact is, it WAS remade an even 30 years after the original came out, whether you like it or not.  When it comes to myself, I like it.The original movie looks vintage 1970s - the cars, the hairstyles, the clothing, the lower technology, etc.  The updated remake was released on June 6, 2006, or 06/06/06 - ""666"", the number of the beast.  One noticeable difference with the remake compared to the original is that the remake is an all-around darker movie.  The atmosphere and surroundings and overall feel are darker.  I think this enhances the effectiveness of the scenes that are meant to be scary.  An example is when Robert Thorn meets with Father Brennan under the bridge during the thunderstorm.  I found this creepier than how it played out in the original.  The thunderstorms during the scene where Thorn is cutting Damien's hair looking for the birthmark add a scariness to the scene.  I also like the snowy scenes where Robert Thorn is talking to Bugenhagen and later goes to the cemetery in Cervet with the photographer Keith Jennings.I found the initial meeting between Thorn and Father Brennan in the lobby was more effective than it was in Thorn's office in the original.When Father Brennan gets struck by the steel rod that falls down from the top of the church, only a couple of seconds go by from the time he notices the rod until he is actually struck.  This is an improvement.  In the original movie, a full five seconds goes by from the time Father Brennan notices the rod until he is actually struck.  This is ample time for him to scoot out of the way, but he just stands there and watches the rod fall down toward him and he accepts his fate without making an effort to get out of the way.Another thing I noticed is that the remake took certain scenes and turbo-charged them.  An example is the scene at the end of the movie when Robert Thorn is driving with Damien to the church.  He's driving recklessly, plowing through gates, skidding and spinning around, smashing into things, all while Damien was putting up more of a fight in the car than in the original.  This is more entertaining than in the original, not that this scene in the original wasn't entertaining.  It was.I think the acting in this remake was a little better than in the original.  The acting in the original came across as ""wooden"" and campy at times.  In this remake, there isn't a hint of campiness.One thing that was added to the remake were the brief appearances of demons dressed in red.  That was cool.Now I want to compare the major characters from the two movies and give my opinion on who was the best...Damien:Harvey Stephens (1976) or Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick (2006)?WINNER:  It's a tieStephens was evil and innocent at the same time, whereas Davey-Fitzpatrick was evil most of the time.  I think the 2006 Damien's facial expressions were more evil than the 1976 Damien's.  The 1976 Damien really didn't have to try hard to be evil looking.  He just was, but in a more subtle way than the 2006 Damien.Mrs. Baylock:Billie Whitelaw (1976) or Mia Farrow (2006)?WINNER:  Billie WhitelawBillie Whitelaw just, I mean JUST edges out Mia Farrow.  It's extremely close.  Billie Whitelaw had the role of Mrs. Baylock down, plain and simple.  She was evil and very convincing.  Mia Farrow did an outstanding job as well.  Her facial expressions were plain evil.  Again, it's very close.Father Brennan:Patrick Troughton (1976) or Pete Postlethwaite (2006)?WINNER:  Pete PostlethwaiteHis acting was a little better.  He seemed more suited for the role than Patrick Troughton.  He seemed to put more heart and emotion into his words.Robert Thorn:Gregory Peck (1976) or Liev Schreiber (2006)?WINNER:  Liev SchreiberLiev Schreiber's acting was better and more convincing and believable than Gregory Peck's.  Gregory Peck's acting came across as ""wooden"" and campy a number of times.  He seemed inconsistent throughout the movie, whereas Liev Schreiber was very consistent.Katherine Thorn:Lee Remick (1976) or Julia Stiles (2006)?WINNER:  Lee RemickLee Remick gave a good performance and barely edges out Julia Stiles.Keith Jennings:David Warner (1976) or David Thewlis (2006)?WINNER:  It's a tieBoth actors gave good performances, so it's a tie.Bugenhagen:Leo McKern (1976) or Michael Gambon (2006)?WINNER:  Michael GambonHis portrayal of the character was slightly better.  I realize makeup and camera angles might have something to do with it, but he's the winner.Nanny:Holly Palance (1976) or Amy Huck (2006)?WINNER:  Holly PalanceI like her a little better.  This is based on looks and the way she delivers her lines.Dog at the birthday party:The Rottweiler (1976) or the German Shepherd (2006)?WINNER:  German ShepherdThe German Shepherd looked more fierce and evil than the Rottweiler, plain and simple.What about the musical score?Jerry Goldsmith (1976) or Marco Beltrami (2006)?WINNER:Jerry GoldsmithGoldsmith's score is legendary, one of the great horror movie scores ever.  However, Beltrami's score is also very good and did an adequate job in the remake.So there you go.  I'm a fan of the remake of The Omen.  As I said, it's one of the few horror movie remakes I like.  How do I compare it to the original?  It's just as good, so I give this remake the same 5-star rating I gave the original.",5,One of the few horror movie remakes I like,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,5560,"['are', 'living', 'Age',

1012737,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B000HCO87C,- Kasia S.,"[14, 24]","It appears that remaking The Omen is a double edged sword; if it strays too much from the original then people will boo and if it's too close then they will be unhappy as well. I totally left all that I knew about it at home and gave my all to the story that was both creepy and modern in John Moore's version of the Anti-Christ ""reborn"" in a man, or should I say little boys flesh.I loved the color schemes of the whole movie with the dark cloudy weather, the gray and beige castle that the Thorns called home and splashes of red used to provoke memories of danger lurking ahead, such classic ways to spice up a story that was really captivating with unreal flashbacks to nightmares, blood and hooded demons that crept up the lives of an innocent pair. The story is well known to those familiar but in brief description to the curious I will divulge a super quick summary.In Rome an American diplomat an his wife, Robert and Katherine Thorn welcome a baby boy  to their world, but little do they know about the origins of that baby. Katherine supposingly had a very difficult delivery that resulted in death of the child and unknowns to her, a priest at the hospital offers Robert a baby boy whose mother died in childbirth at the same time that Katherine was in her labor. Robert takes the baby boy, pretends that it is theirs because it was all his wife ever wanted and they go on from there only to meet death and destruction for what seemed like a saved situation. The movie follows the boy, Damien who starts to show strange behavior starting with his 6th birthday party and that's when things go form bad to worse.I will agree that the original Damian was both melancholy and menacing with his cold silver blue eyes, and was much better than Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who did some good smirks and threw a fit when close to a church, but I didn't let that one thing spoil my movie.I loved watching people jump in their seats and scream out, it made me laugh, only because if I'm going to see a horror movie, I know better than let things slip out of me like that, and I enjoyed seeing others have a reaction that horror movies makes us crave. Overall this was very good, and I liked Liev Schreiber, Mia Farrow and even Julian Styles, who did much better than I expected and certain scenes such as the one in the cemetery with the falling snow were really well done. The death scenes were ultra gruesome because they were so realistic but they just gave this movie more depth. I enjoyed this and I'm really looking forward to seeing what unravels from where the story leaves, for I know more gruesome yummies are on the way.",4,Hellboy strikes again,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2628,"['remaking', 'Omen', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'then', 'people', 'will', 'boo', 'too', 'close', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'unhappy', 'well', 'totally', 'left', 'knew', 'home', 'gave', 'story', 'was', 'creepy', 'modern', 'John', 'Moore', 'version', 'Anti-Christ', 'reborn', 'man', 'should', 'say', 'little', 'boys', 'flesh.I', 'loved', 'color', 'schemes', 'whole', 'movie', 'dark', 'cloudy', 'weather', 'gray', 'beige', 'castle', 'Thorns', 'called', 'home', 'splashes', 'red', 'used', 'provoke', 'memories', 'danger', 'lurking', 'ahead', 'such', 'classic', 'ways', 'spice', 'up', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'captivating', 'unreal', 'flashbacks', 'nightmares', 'blood', 'hooded', 'demons', 'crept', 'up', 'lives', 'innocent', 'pair', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'familiar', 'brief', 'description', 'curious', 'will', 'divulge', 'super', 'quick', 'summary.In', 'Rome', 'American', 'diplomat', 'wife', 'Robert', 'Katherine', 'Thorn', 'welcome', 'baby', 'boy', 'world', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'origins', 'baby', 'Katherine', 'supposingly', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'delivery', 'resulted', 'death', 'child', 'unknowns', 'priest', 'hospital', 'Robert', 'baby', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'childbirth', 'same', 'time', 'Katherine', 'was', 'labor', 'Robert', 'baby', 'boy', 'theirs', 'was', 'wife', 'ever', 'wanted', 'go', 'only', 'meet', 'death', 'destruction', 'what', 'seemed', 'saved', 'situation', 'movie', 'boy', 'Damien', 'who', 'show', 'strange', 'behavior', 'starting', '6th', 'birthday', 'party', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'form', 'bad', 'worse.I', 'will', 'agree', 'original', 'Damian', 'was', 'melancholy', 'menacing', 'cold', 'silver', 'blue', 'eyes', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'who', 'did', 'good', 'smirks', 'threw', 'fit', 'when', 'close', 'church', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'one', 'thing', 'spoil', 'movie.I', 'loved', 'watching', 'people', 'jump', 'seats', 'scream', 'out', 'made', 'laugh', 'only', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'know', 'better', 'let', 'things', 'slip', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'others', 'have', 'reaction', 'horror', 'movies', 'crave', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'liked', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'even', 'Julian', 'Styles', 'who', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'certain', 'scenes', 'such', 'one', 'cemetery', 'falling', 'snow', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'death', 'scenes', 'were', 'ultra', 'gruesome', 'were', 'so', 'realistic', 'just', 'gave', 'movie', 'more', 'depth', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'unravels', 'where', 'story', 'know', 'more', 'gruesome', 'yummies', 'are', 'way']",N/A

I've never seen the original but I've heard good things about it so why not give this one a shot right? Geeeze was I wrong. The story line is not too bad but I think there could of been a lot more changes to make it even better, more scary and more surprising. It's too easy of a movie to figure out. I barely had to follow along to know what was going on, and what was going to happen. So if you don't like to think too hard, this movie is perfect for you.The only thing I liked about this flim was Mia Farrow..now she was creepy! Great acting on her part, everyone else was just cheese! From a can if you will.

I believe film remakes almost always have two strikes against them with devoted fans of the original movie. It is my opinion that film remakes can and should be made in certain instances, and should be looked at the following way.Films can and should be remade if (Solvani please note):1) They are collectively viewed as something very special and must eventually be remade, just as Broadway shows and plays are often ""revived"" with no attached stigma or snob factor.2) They are seen as something which could have been great with the introduction of an additional original plot twist, film approach, or ending, in which the original just fell short of ""greatness"".3) The advancement of film technology, set design, makeup, CGI, or other theatrical element will be taken advantage of, as well as some minor or major reinterpretation of the plot.I really don't think film remakes are a bad thing and honestly believe the remake of a good film like the THE OMEN, and other fine movies are a positive thing for the film industry and its fans.I have hated and loved remakes of films on a case basis. I hated the remake of Psycho, was disappointed in the remake of Day the Earth Stood Still, and loved The Omen. I also loved the original Haunting and liked the remake. I just don't think we should be married to the original movie. I think in the case of The Omen that the original script was used successfully and it was only better film technology and approach that benefited the remake. I would, for example, like to see a remake of the very original sci-fi movie, Brainstorm, with a brilliant new ending, and filmed with new technology and special effects.",4,The Omen (Remake),1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,1735,"['enjoyed', 'Omen', 'remake', '2006', 'feel', 'was', 'better', 'made', 'original', 'believe', 'film', 'remakes', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'two', 'strikes', 'devoted', 'fans', 'original', 'movie', 'opinion', 'film', 'remakes', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'certain', 'instances', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'following', 'way.Films', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'remade', 'Solvani', 'please', 'note', ':1', 'are', 'collectively', 'viewed', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'must', 'eventually', 'be', 'remade', 'just', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'plays', 'are', 'often', 'revived', 'attached', 'stigma', 'snob', 'factor.2', 'are', 'seen', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'introduction', 'additional', 'original', 'plot', 'twist', 'film', 'approach', 'ending', 'original', 'just', 'fell', 'short', 'greatness', '.3', 'advancement', 'film', 'technology', 'set', 'design', 'makeup', 'CGI', 'other', 'theatrical', 'element', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'as', 'well', 'minor', 'major', 'reinterpretation', 'plot.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'remakes', 'are', 'bad', 'thing', 'honestly', 'believe', 'remake', 'good', 'film', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'other', 'fine', 'movies', 'are', 'positive', 'thing', 'film', 'industry', 'fans.I', 'have', 'hated', 'loved', 'remakes', 'films', 'case', 'basis', 'hated', 'remake', 'Psycho', 'was', 'disappointed', 'remake', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'loved', 'Omen', 'also', 'loved', 'original', 'Haunting', 'liked', 'remake', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'married', 'original', 'movie', 'think', 'case', 'Omen', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'used', 'successfully', 'was', 'only', 'better', 'film', 'technology', 'approach', 'benefited', 'remake', 'would', 'example', 'see', 'remake', 'very', 'original', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'Brainstorm', 'brilliant', 'new', 'ending', 'filmed', 'new', 'technology', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

In a very nice touch Stephens is here in a brief role as a Tabloid Reporter.As for the cute little Rottweiller that is the family, um, pet.... what happens to him is funny, yet embarrassing to all Rotties everywhere. ;-D",4,Well done remake of  a classic,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2964,"['original', 'was', 'creepy', 'moody', 'classic', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'match.Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'Billie', 'Whitelaw', 'protective', 'Nanny', 'Did', 'know', 'Billie', 'was', 'Quaker', 'hee', 'hee', 'Harvey', 'Stephens', 'was', 'true', 'find.So', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'here', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised.The', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'was', 'knowing', 'original', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'hand', 'handle', 'remake.There', 'were', 'few', 'changes', 'plot', 'bring', '21st', 'century', 'most', 'part', 'major', 'touchstones', 'plot', 'original', 'are', 're-done', 'modern', 'take.This', 'time', 'Thorn', 'Ambassadors', '2', 'um', 'being', 'thrust', 'top', 'job', 'circumstance.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'creepy', 'music', 'original', 'absent', 'closing', 'credits.The', 'music', 'used', 'was', 'moody', 'not', 'best', 'choice.The', 'film', 'Armageddon', 'nigh', 'point', 'right', 'bat', 'nifty', 'Priestly', 'Powerpoint', 'Presentation', 'Pope', 'recent', 'events', 'harbingers', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'comparing', 'how', 'plot', 'developement', 're-make', 'compared', 'original', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'own', 'right.Of', 'deaths', 'finest', 'moment', 'most', 'original', 'decapitation', 'film', 'history', '-DThe', 'death', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'close', '2nd.As', 'Acting', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Thorn', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'not', 'wooden', 'actor', 'critics', 'claim', 'here', 'either.By', 'having', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'Ambassador', 'handle', 'age', 'difference', 'acting', 'becomes', 'more', 'expressive', 'plot', 'developments', 'pile', 'up', 'found', 'plus.Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'still', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'mother', 'who', 'too', 'late', 'boy', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'right', '.Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'flat', 'wonderfully', 'fanatical', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'steals', 'scene', 'in.Mia', 'Farrow', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'fame', 'inspired', 'bit', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Mrs.', 'Baylock', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'stealing', 'gusto', 'scene', 'one', 'most', 'erotic', 'creepy', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed.David', 'Thewlis', 'odd', 'looking', 'face', 'photographer', 'good.I', 'liked', 'way', 'played', 'role', 'better', 'version', 'original.I', 'also', 'think', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'was', 'better', 'Bugenhagen.Little', 'Shamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'creepy', 'new', 'Damien', 'truly', 'creepy', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'needed.In', 'way', 'think', 'impression', 'due', 'difference', 'music.In', 'film', 'music', 'truly', 'matters', 'think', 'missed', 'beat', 'not', 'using', 'original', 'score', 'variation', 'it.Speaking', 'original', 'Damien', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'Stephens', 'here', 'brief', 'role', 'Tabloid', 'Reporter.As', 'cute', 'little', 'Rottweiller', 'family', 'um', 'pet', 'what', 'funny', 'yet', 'embarrassing', 'Rotties', 'everywhere']",N/A

This is probably the second American remake to have its screenplay written from the screenplay that wrote the original. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did Moore's remake of ""Flight Of The Phoenix"") is great as Jerry Goldsmith's 30 years ago and ironically Goldsmith trained Beltrami. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is excellent. The film editing by Dan Zimmerman (first assistant editor on ""Flight Of The Phoenix"") is excellent. The casting by Susie Figgis & Jessica Horuathova is excellent.

1012744,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000HCO87C,Lawyeraau,"[30, 34]","This is a decent re-make of a first class, gothic chiller. It is not, however, as creepy as the 1976 original, which starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, as it lacks Jerry Goldsmith's pulse pounding musical score. It also has a younger cast that lacks the gravitas of the original. Still, the film is still worth viewing, if only to see how it fares in comparison to the original, especially as the screenplay used appears to be the original one.Katherine (Julia Stiles) and Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) are a young, affluent American couple. Katherine is pregnant and, while in Italy, gives birth to an ostensibly stillborn boy, a fact that is kept from her. Knowing how much his wife wanted the baby and the difficulty that she had in conceiving, Robert agrees to have the dead baby supplanted by a living newborn whose mother died in child birth, keeping this information from Katherine. They name this baby Damien.All goes well for the prosperous Thorn family, until Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) turns five. A series of dramatic, unusual events begin to occur around the Thorns, all seemingly stemming from Damien. Well guarded by a somewhat creepy nanny (Mia Farrow), there are those who would believe him to be the Antichrist. By the time that Katherine and Robert begin to realize who Damien may truly be, their lives are out of control. With the aid of an inquisitive photographer, a repentant priest, and an mysterious man who holds the key to the destruction of the Antichrist, Robert Thorn becomes a man with a mission. Will Damien let him complete that mission? Watch this movie and find out.Both Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles give credible performances, though they are no Gregory Peck or Lee Remick. Mia Farrow, as the nanny with a diabolical mission, gives a fine and genuinely creepy performance, aided in part by what appears to be a pair of collagen enhanced lips. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent.

In this updated version, our hellboy Damien returns and even though there's not a whole lot of difference between the two films, the movie still packs a dramatic punch.  If you've never seen the original, you'll enjoy this a little more than those of us who still remember Gregory Peck Lee Remick and Billie Whitelaw's chilling performances.  But to the new version's credit, the faithfulness to the original is what makes it worthwhile viewing for fans of the genre.Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles are the parents of the little hellion; they don't bring the same kind of intensity Peck and Remick did, but they do okay for themselves; David Thewlis is David Warner-worthy; and Pete Postelthwaite as the doomed priest is impressive.  The deaths for the most part are staged as in the original, although they're a little more graphic.  Stiles' final scene doesn't pack the emotional wallop of Remick's demise in the original, but it works for this film.  Mia Farrow is very good as the nanny in a change of pace role, but her final showdown with Schrieber isn't as impressive as Peck and Whitelaw's confrontation.  The scene in the cemetary when they discover the jackal is hauntingly spooky, and the addition of snow on the ground adds to this terror.Overall, THE OMEN is a good remake, and even if you've seen the original, you should enjoy this one, too.",4,DAMIEN IS BACK,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,1490,"['Was', 'remake', 'classic', '1976', 'film', 'necessary', 'Not', 'really', 'remake', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'As', 'good', 'original', 'Almost', 'updated', 'version', 'hellboy', 'Damien', 'returns', 'even', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'movie', 'still', 'dramatic', 'punch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'little', 'more', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Billie', 'Whitelaw', 'chilling', 'performances', 'new', 'version', 'credit', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'what', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'fans', 'genre.Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'are', 'parents', 'little', 'hellion', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'same', 'kind', 'intensity', 'Peck', 'Remick', 'did', 'do', 'okay', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'David', 'Warner-worthy', 'Pete', 'Postelthwaite', 'doomed', 'priest', 'impressive', 'deaths', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'staged', 'original', ""'re"", 'little', 'more', 'graphic', 'Stiles', 'final', 'scene', ""n't"", 'pack', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'Remick', 'demise', 'original', 'film', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'very', 'good', 'nanny', 'change', 'pace', 'role', 'final', 'showdown', 'Schrieber', ""n't"", 'as', 'impressive', 'Peck', 'Whitelaw', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'cemetary', 'when', 'discover', 'jackal', 'hauntingly', 'spooky', 'addition', 'snow', 'ground', 'terror.Overall', 'OMEN', 'good', 'remake', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too']",N/A

My review is simply about those prophecies and the quality of the movie...First of all, they talk about the prophecies in the beginning...  It started sounding pretty cool how they tied it all together, that is it would have if they managed to not lie about the Revelation prophecies.  They were talking about a firy mountain (or some similar phrasing) falling and showed the Twin Towers...  but in Revelation, the prophecy talked about the mountain falling into the sea and killing 1/3 of all the creatures...  the Twin Towers didn't do that.  Also, some of the prophecies from the latter angels, such as the fifth angel, possibly the fourth, were totally inaccurate.  Revelation didn't talk about the sea killing 200,000 people.  So, needless to say, there's a lot of problems there...Moving on, the mother in the movie was a horrible actor.  Not only was her character annoying, but the actress was bad at the part.  I wasn't impressed by any of the acting, honestly, but the mother's was especially bad (at least, I thought so).  After that, there was a lot of stuff that I'm sure they meant to be scary...  but it wasn't.  No, not unless you're paranoid of Armageddon being right now or very very soon or you're the type to jump whenever the ""scary sounds"" come on, no matter what's on the screen.  I'll not make a list of things, but the skeleton, donkey-faced zealot in red or whatever that's supposed to be...  yeah, that's not scary.  I'm more scared when my bagels won't toast right.  Furthermore, why the hell does no one in that family wear anything but white, black, or red (rarely variety, anyway)?  Yes, it applies to the movie, but it got annoying (honestly, that obviously wasn't too important).All things considered that I can consider...  that is, poor acting, faulty content, petty annoyances, poor realism (see below in SPOILER), and the lack of scary things in a supposedly scary movie, I must say...  this was a horrible movie.*SPOILER: DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT PART OF THE MOVIE SPOILED*Ok, I had a big problem with the scene in which the nanny kills the mother.

Primarily this is one of those films that really works where the majority of remakes of prior films are ultimately dreadful, as has been evident with so many movies. We pretty much would all agree that remakes rarely even equal the original. In the case of 'The Omen 6.6.06', I felt the film was surprisingly well cast and acted. When first being introduced to the various characters my first feeling was- ""Oh boy- here we go. This guy just doesn't fit this role"". Well as character development continued I am happy to say I was wrong about this perception, especially in the case of Pete Postlewaite's interpretation of the tormented priest. A superb and better than average actor nicely fit into this role. As did Mia Farrow in her part. I was happy to see a classic veteran actor like Farrow finally having the chance to play an evil character. The only side note about her part is not so much the part it's self but realizing that she is still breathtakingly beautiful despite her elder age, and even the less than appealing makeup, clothing, and hair design couldn't hide that fact.

And, without all of those things to measure this effort against, 'Omen 666' still manages to be a dismal, overblown tack-fest of enormous proportions.The movie opens with some flashy, glitzy documentary-style shots of actual, real disasters, like 9/11 and the New Orleans flooding. Far from underlining the proposed message at the beginning of the movie - that man is contributing to his own downfall - these shots are a cheap, tawdry attempt to pull the viewer in to gain some sort of empathy with what the (it must be said) not-terribly-worried-looking Vatican Cardinals are foreseeing. I don't know about you but I'd prefer to show these disasters a little respect, not dress them up and gloss them over to serve the bland ends of movies like this one.The glossy, overawed sense of self-importance continues with some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie - the decapitation scene, the first time we're supposed to wonder what Damien's power is actually capable of, looks here, thanks to some Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Versus-Steven-Segal style direction, like something from a bad action flick. Damien's birthday party, the zoo sequence and the death of Father Brennan all suffer from the same waaaay over-the-top flashiness, and this simply removes all the dramatic worth of the scene, because we've seen all this done so, so many times before.Performance-wise there's not much on offer: Julia Stiles is a good actress, but she's out of her depth here. She doesn't seem capable of generating either the sympathy or the humanity needed for her character. Pete Postlethwaite stinks (really, REALLY stinks - I was very disappointed: he sounds like a drunken St. Patrick's Day reveller instead of a priest who knows Armageddon is at hand) and David Thewlis just looks bored. Ditto Mia Farrow: a great casting choice to play the malevolent Mrs. Blayloch, Farrow's lack of screen time and the inclusion of her 'campier' moments turn Mrs. Blayloch into something of a Light Relief. Liev Schreiber does a pretty good job as Robert Thorn, but the subtleties of his performance are lost to a less-than-average supporting cast and some truly boring, boring direction. The same can be said for Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who, while initially doing a good job in the role of Damien, proceeds to slap a constipated expression on his face for the latter two-thirds of the picture, and winds up eventually at Not Very Scary At All.This movie is not even recommended for a DVD rental, being so wholly unoriginal and over-the-top. The mawkish quality of the visuals and the frankly substandard direction are thrown into relief by the fact that director John Moore clearly thought he could add some visual frills to the style and pacing of the original movie and come up with something decent. He hasn't, and what we're left with in 'Omen 666' is a pretty feeble rendition of a potentially gripping story.Avoid.",1,"Oh, dear.",1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,3113,"['not', 'good', 'movie.Forget', 'remake', 'forget', 'original', 'forget', 'concept', 'Hell-On-Earth', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'already', 'movies', ""'The"", 'Exorcist', 'Baby', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', 'so', 'forth', 'things', 'measure', 'effort', '666', 'still', 'be', 'dismal', 'overblown', 'tack-fest', 'enormous', 'proportions.The', 'movie', 'flashy', 'glitzy', 'documentary-style', 'shots', 'actual', 'real', 'disasters', '9/11', 'New', 'Orleans', 'flooding', 'Far', 'underlining', 'proposed', 'message', 'beginning', 'movie', 'man', 'contributing', 'own', 'downfall', 'shots', 'are', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'attempt', 'pull', 'viewer', 'gain', 'sort', 'empathy', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'not-terribly-worried-looking', 'Vatican', 'Cardinals', 'are', 'foreseeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'show', 'disasters', 'little', 'respect', 'not', 'dress', 'up', 'gloss', 'serve', 'bland', 'movies', 'one.The', 'glossy', 'overawed', 'sense', 'self-importance', 'more', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'movie', 'decapitation', 'scene', 'first', 'time', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'wonder', 'what', 'Damien', 'power', 'actually', 'capable', 'here', 'thanks', 'Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Versus-Steven-Segal', 'style', 'direction', 'something', 'bad', 'action', 'flick', 'Damien', 'birthday', 'party', 'zoo', 'sequence', 'death', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'suffer', 'same', 'waaaay', 'over-the-top', 'flashiness', 'simply', 'dramatic', 'worth', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before.Performance-wise', 'not', 'much', 'offer', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'good', 'actress', 'depth', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'capable', 'generating', 'sympathy', 'humanity', 'needed', 'character', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'stinks', 'really', 'REALLY', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'drunken', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'instead', 'priest', 'who', 'Armageddon', 'hand', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'just', 'bored', 'Ditto', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'great', 'casting', 'choice', 'play', 'malevolent', 'Mrs.', 'Blayloch', 'Farrow', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'inclusion', ""'campier"", 'moments', 'turn', 'Mrs.', 'Blayloch', 'something', 'Light', 'Relief', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'subtleties', 'performance', 'are', 'lost', 'less-than-average', 'supporting', 'cast', 'truly', 'boring', 'boring', 'direction', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'who', 'initially', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Damien', 'proceeds', 'slap', 'constipated', 'expression', 'face', 'latter', 'two-thirds', 'picture', 'up', 'eventually', 'Not', 'Very', 'Scary', 'All.This', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'rental', 'being', 'so', 'wholly', 'unoriginal', 'over-the-top', 'mawkish', 'quality', 'visuals', 'frankly', 'substandard', 'direction', 'are', 'thrown', 'relief', 'fact', 'director', 'John', 'Moore', 'clearly', 'thought', 'could', 'add', 'visual', 'frills', 'style', 'pacing', 'original', 'movie', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'decent', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'left', ""'Omen"", '666', 'pretty', 'feeble', 'rendition', 'potentially', 'gripping', 'story.Avoid']",N/A
1012772,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000HCO87C,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","The Omen (John Moore, 2006)[NOTE: this review contains a major spoiler. If you have never seen either version of the film, not read David Seltzer's novel, and you plan to, then do not read this review until after you have done so.]What a frustrating movie this is, in that it is possible in many, many scenes to see what could have been. The modernizing touches made in the movie ranged from subtly brilliant to absolutely fascinating (and during the Cardinal's presentation to the Pope early on, you'll be amazed at how the original 1976 poem does match up with current events), and, of course, the better special effects these days made some scenes that were done mostly with camera trickery thirty years ago really shine. And the things they did to make sure it wasn't a shot-by-shot remake, but contained the same basic ideas (for example, transporting the monkey attack to the monkey house at the zoo, rather than the drive-through jungle park), really worked rather well. Unfortunately, some of the rest of the production doesn't live up to those things.In case you've been living under a rock for three decades, a quick overview: a politician's wife gives birth. When said politician, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber, who seems to be sliding into typecasting as ""the remake guy"") gets to the hospital, he is told there were complications and the baby was lost, but there's a way to save his wife's somewhat fragile sanity: another baby was born at the same time, and the mother-- the only family the little tyke had-- died during the birth. Thorn could pass the kid off as his own and no one would be the wiser save Thorn and the hospital staff. He takes the deal, and when he wife Katharine (Julia Stiles) wakes up, hey, there's the kid, Damien. Fast forward five years. Thorn is now the ambassador to Great Britain, after his immediate superior was killed in a suspicious explosion, and Damien is five. And things start going a little bit weird-- his nanny kills herself inexplicably. A drunk priest, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), starts showing up, darkly hinting that Thorn and his wife are in grave danger. A nosy reporter (David Thewlis) starts doing some digging. And we are pointed to the conclusion that Damien Thorn is, in fact, the Antichrist, born to begin the Tribulation foretold in the Revelation of St. John the Divine (as well as a piece of doggerel David Seltzer dashed off for the original script that has become so culturally prevalent many believe it's actually in the Bible somewhere).Schreiber and Stiles were probably the least appropriate choices in all of Hollywood to portray Robert and Katherine Thorn. Stiles (10 Things I Hate About You) and Schreiber (Big Night) have both done credible work in the past, but none of it shows up here. (This is something of a surprise with Scheiber, who has been known to carry entire movies in the past; he was certainly the only thing worth watching about the execrable Phantoms.) It's also a touch scary to think about Schreiber and Stiles married. Though when I look back, there was a much larger age difference between Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, so I should probably get over it. (I had no idea Peck was sixty when he made the original until just now. Now I'm even more creeped out by the original than I was previously.) This is all the more odd because the supporting players are great almost to a man; Thewlis and Postlethwaite are both stellar, as usual. And while there is what we shall refer to here as ""great controversy"" over Mia Farrow's casting as Mrs. Baylock, Damien's ominous new nanny, I thought she was great here. She had just the right touch of syrupy sweetness to make the deception believable. (As much as I loved Billie Whitelaw's portrayal in the original, nothing about that woman ever said ""I should care for your kids."" Farrow's character has the appropriate mousiness.) Michael Gambon makes a great Bugenhagen. Etc. You get the idea. Surrounding all these great (and some few mediocre) actors is the general look-and-feel of the film, which many have criticized as ripping off Final Destination (to which others have retaliated saying Final Destination ripped off the original Omen). I think both are partially correct; the idea of the Rube Goldberg-esque supernatural death almost certainly came down to Final Destination through the original Omen, but the feel of the deaths here is very twenty-first century. Consider, if you will, the scene considered the most shocking in the original movie: the decapitation of David Warner. Gregory Peck and David Warner have their argument, and it's dusty and gritty and nasty. And Satan's hand causes a worker not to set his handbrake quite right, so the truck rolls backward, and the sheet of plate glass, and the top of Warner's head bouncing off into the dust. It's ugly. It's nasty. In this version, the street where Schreiber and Thewlis play out the same argument (and, as a side note, a comparison of the two back to back will highlight the deficiencies in Schreiber's acting in this movie quite nicely), it's a much more sanitized scene, lots of brick and cobblestone, no dust at all. Instead of plate glass, the instrument of death is an iron fixture from which a peg is knocked loose by a falling hammer. Glass shatters, iron does not. There's just so much less mess about it. It's a whole different type of atmosphere. It's not necessarily a worse atmosphere; it's just different. I think that's a distinction that a lot of us film snobs refuse to make all too often, especially when it comes to a remake that is, in fact, inferior to the original; it's a cheap shot, something to pile on when heaping invective on a movie that never should've got made in the first place.The thing is, there's so much about The Omen's remake that says it was a film that deserved to be made, like Huston's remake of The Maltese Falcon or Verbinski's remake of Ring, and that it could have been just as good a film, if different than the original. You have to overlook some bad stuff to see it, but it is there to be seen. In truth, the bad stuff is a small part of the total package. Unfortunately, it's the part that's bound to get the most scrutiny, since it comes in the form of the two main characters. ***",3,"So close, and yet so far.",1186617600,"08 9,

Penola,"[1, 1]","I was looking forward to the insanely fun idea of re-making The Omen for a modern audience, despite the lingering power of the original, which still makes me shudder.  The clever casting of Mia Farrow notwithstanding, this remake has the same expensive sleek look as the original, and is almost word for word the same screenplay.  What it lacks is the gravity and terror of the original; it's so much the same that it is ultimately pointless.

1012777,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000HCO87C,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","There is an interesting scene at the beginning of ""The Omen"" remake that involves a Catholic bishop's report to the dying Pope about the emergence of an antichrist. The bishop ticks off the signs - a comet, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, that big tsunami - with a flashy slideshow, which he ends by saying ""our worst fears have been confirmed."" Now - why would this bishop have much fear?  Catholics believe the Book of Revelation is found in the Bible because it will happen - because it must - and it's no more to fear than the most obscure verses in Deuteronomy about the treatment of pus-filled scabs. Certainly the son of the devil is to be scorned and hated, but a Catholic bishop shouldn't exactly fear the inevitable unfolding of God's endgame; if anything, he should be solemnly glad that the new earth is near.You can think about these things because the first half of ""The Omen"" is a sprawling bore and the kid who plays antichrist Damien, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, is about as ominous as a Cabbage Patch doll. Couldn't director John Moore have found anybody else? Couldn't somebody have chopped Dakota Fanning's hair off, dyed it brown, and stuck her in there? The Pope's squirming in his velvet chair over a kid who has all of six lines and scowls by *literally protruding his lower lip.* The Dev' better have a plan B - this can't be the kid.But he is the boy British Ambassador Robert Thorn (Live Schreiber) took home the night his real son was killed by the Satanists. Wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) is the doomed mother who senses, by Damien's sixth birthday, that something is off about a mute boy who inspires nannies to hang themselves off the sides of castles and gorillas to go gonzo at the zoo. Robert brushes these things off as he wears all-black outfits to Katherine's elegant white robes and he ignores a psychotic priest (Pete Postlethwaite) who screams some demonic poem and the line: ""His real mother was a jackal!"" Do not think you shall be spared the shot of a jackal's skeleton in a shallow grave guarded by possessed black hellhounds. Oh, there will be a jackal's skeleton.This is a faithful remake of the original movie, which causes a lot of thirtysomethings to say ""Ohhh, `The Omen,' oooo, that was so...oh my God!"" without really expounding on the issue beyond, ""Ohhh, Gregory Peck."" That's because it wasn't any good either, and screenwriter David Selzer's idea has more traction than his writing of both pictures - the son of the devil, when he comes, isn't going to make this kind of ludicrous, swaggering entrance. The ""Harry Potter"" series, in fact, etches a more convincing origin story in its evolution of Voldemort. And a chilling movie was made about the birth of the antichrist; it's called ""Rosemary's Baby,"" with Mia Farrow, who stars in ""The Omen"" as the evil nanny who stares longingly into Damien's eyes while she feeds him strawberries.It's right after this scene that Damien puts a sock in Katherine with his scooter, and Robert teams up with a photographer (David Thewlis) on a scavenger hunt that at least works better than ""The DaVinci Code."" A particular campy highlight is found at an ancient Italian monastery beyond a misty, snow-crusted lake where a deformed Satanic monk scrawls, in black coal, the location of a cemetery - but not before the church bells toll and we get a shot of Robert searching the walls for intruders. Later they meet a crazy sage (Michael Gambon) who hands Robert a leather pouch of daggers to kill Damien. Robert, who in an earlier scene says ""I want Damien dead,"" has fourth thoughts. But the photographer is more than willing.Which leads to another question: When somebody is decapitated while standing, would their remaining body pause for a moment, slouch, then fall - or would they just drop immediately? My wife asked me this directly after ""The Omen.""

1012780,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B000HCO87C,S. Harris,"[4, 6]","This remake is probably better than a lot of other recent horror remakes (Amityville Horror, The Fog), but the Why of it still remains.  For example, as bad as the new Amityville was, it did attempt to provide an update in script.  It still stunk, but you could at least sense that the scriptwriters were trying to jazz the new version up.  With the new Omen, you have a very faithful remake, but without the gravitas of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick to heighten the horror.  Liev Schieber and Julia Stiles are pretty good, and the script writers were actually clever in explaining how Schieber could land the plum ambassoder post (he's the president's godson), but this isn't enough to compare with the older Peck's growing awareness and horror of just who his son might be. (And let's face it, Peck looked like an Ambassador.)  Then there was Lee Remick.  No one had eyes like Lee Remick, especially when she was using them to express alarm and terror.  She was a great actress.  In contrast, especially if you've seen the original, Stiles and Schieber look like 30 somethings playing house.As far as the devil kid, Damien, he could have been a CGI representative from the first one, I couldn't tell (which should give you an idea as to how slick this new version is).  He really makes very little impression, and I seem to recall the original kid as at least radiating malevolence.  Also, and somewhat slavish, is how David Thewlis as the freelance photographer seems to have been cast for the part because he faintly resembles David Warner, right down to the nervous mannerisms.  Come on, at least let the actors bring something new to the table!  The one standout performance is Mia Farrow as the evil Mrs. Baylock.  The original had Billie Whitelaw playing Mrs. Baylock, and she was outstanding, so Farrow had to come up with a fine performance to at least match Whitelaw's diabolic effort.  The good news is that she does quite well with the part, and it serves as the one attempt at a departure from the original.

1012781,A1HJZ1SBR0ROHH,B000HCO87C,"Shayne ""- Shayne""","[1, 1]","It has been years since I've seen the original Omen series. It is a classic and it only made sense that Hollywood would remake the classic horror film. As of late I seem to be one of few that really, really enjoy these horror remakes. The brilliant The Hills Have Eyes, When A Stranger Calls and even last years The Fog was pretty well made. I have no issue with Hollywood creating a classic story for a new generation and even putting their own spin to it. Young director John Moore even goes out of his way to set the film up with some clever imagery, and hidden surprises for people. He doesn't tone the film down to keep in tough with the original but actually comes out of the gate all guns blazing.Liev Schreiber plays Robert Thorn, the Ambassador to Italy at the time of his wife's birth. In order to spare her pain he agrees to take a child that is not theirs and raise him as his own. I've seen Schreiber in a fair amount of things and he's always done okay. I've never really seen anything from him that would show me he could be a leading man in a film. Well The Omen did it!! He shows some real acting chops and showed that he could carry the film flawlessly. His intensity, his diplomacy in his political character really showed some maturity in his ability. He was great!! Julia Stiles plays Damien's mother Katherine Thorn. I like Stiles, I really do. She has done some great work in the Bourne films, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Save The Last Dance but I think she might have been miscast for this role. She doesn't come across as mature enough to be an Ambassador's wife and even when she begins to realize the truth about Damien she comes across as not being the good person. You don't feel sorry for her, and she just seems to be completely inferior to everyone else's character in the film. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is the infamous Damien, the child of Satan. Seamus is adequate. The story doesn't actually hinge on his performance but rather more the character and that's a good thing because he's not quite as creepy as the young child could be. I can think of many other child actors who could really send chills down your spine, although most of them are grown now. Still Seamus does a good enough job for the part and for being so young I'm sure he has a big career ahead of me. There were times he looked goofy more than scary. Pete Postlethwaite plays Father Brennan, and although his part is small he performance is quite significance. He has great screen presence and always adds something interesting to his character roles. He meets a brutal ending in the film. Mia Farrow is deliciously evil as the new nanny Mrs. Baylock, determined to protect Damien against anything or anyone including his own parents. Her soft spoken voice but glaring evil eyes make her a terrific villain and the battle between her and Liev Schrieber at the end is edge of your seat terrifying.It really isn't the characters that truly make this film really, really well done but rather the story and the equal balance between gore horror and psychological horror. The film is absolutely gory with some truly unique, and disgusting kills but it also adds in that creepy, skin crawling aspect of Julia Stiles' dreams, and visions. The film is intelligent enough to have certain aspects of imagery such as the deep red on white background shown repeatedly and the certain flashes of 6.6.6. The setting for this film is brilliant, from Italy, to England, to Israel...the architecture for every building no matter how mundane is breath taking. Each scene is dark, gritty, ancient, beautifully shot. Schrieber absolutely holds together the story and is definitely watchable. If you loved the original, if you love a good horror/thriller you will thoroughly enjoy The Omen. On top of it being gory, captivating, thrilling they even have plenty of what I always call ""cheap scares"" where you will literally jump in the air at the sound of something jumping out, crashing down, being where it shouldn't be...always a lot of fun and The Omen is worth seeing. 9/10",5,One of the better remakes to come out in recent years!,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,4063,"['been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Omen', 'series', 'classic', 'only', 'made', 'sense', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'remake', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'late', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'really', 'really', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'remakes', 'brilliant', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'even', 'last', 'years', 'Fog', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'have', 'issue', 'Hollywood', 'creating', 'classic', 'story', 'new', 'generation', 'even', 'putting', 'own', 'spin', 'Young', 'director', 'John', 'Moore', 'even', 'way', 'set', 'film', 'up', 'clever', 'imagery', 'hidden', 'surprises', 'people', ""n't"", 'tone', 'film', 'down', 'keep', 'tough', 'original', 'actually', 'gate', 'guns', 'blazing.Liev', 'Schreiber', 'plays', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'Ambassador', 'Italy', 'time', 'wife', 'birth', 'order', 'spare', 'pain', 'take', 'child', 'not', 'theirs', 'raise', 'own', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Schreiber', 'fair', 'amount', 'things', 'always', 'done', 'okay', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'anything', 'would', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'film', 'Omen', 'did', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'showed', 'could', 'carry', 'film', 'flawlessly', 'intensity', 'diplomacy', 'political', 'character', 'really', 'showed', 'maturity', 'ability', 'was', 'great', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Damien', 'mother', 'Katherine', 'Thorn', 'Stiles', 'really', 'do', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'Bourne', 'films', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'miscast', 'role', ""n't"", 'come', 'mature', 'enough', 'be', 'Ambassador', 'wife', 'even', 'when', 'realize', 'truth', 'Damien', 'across', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'just', 'be', 'completely', 'inferior', 'everyone', 'else', 'character', 'film', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'infamous', 'Damien', 'child', 'Satan', 'Seamus', 'adequate', 'story', ""n't"", 'actually', 'hinge', 'performance', 'rather', 'more', 'character', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'creepy', 'young', 'child', 'could', 'be', 'can', 'think', 'many', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'most', 'are', 'grown', 'now', 'Still', 'Seamus', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'part', 'being', 'so', 'young', ""'m"", 'sure', 'big', 'career', 'ahead', 'were', 'times', 'looked', 'goofy', 'more', 'scary', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'part', 'small', 'performance', 'quite', 'significance', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'always', 'something', 'interesting', 'character', 'roles', 'brutal', 'ending', 'film', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'new', 'nanny', 'Mrs.', 'Baylock', 'determined', 'protect', 'Damien', 'anything', 'anyone', 'including', 'own', 'parents', 'soft', 'spoken', 'voice', 'glaring', 'evil', 'eyes', 'make', 'terrific', 'villain', 'battle', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'end', 'edge', 'seat', 'terrifying.It', 'really', ""n't"", 'characters', 'truly', 'make', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'rather', 'story', 'equal', 'balance', 'gore', 'horror', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'absolutely', 'gory', 'truly', 'unique', 'disgusting', 'kills', 'also', 'creepy', 'skin', 'crawling', 'aspect', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'dreams', 'visions', 'film', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'have', 'certain', 'aspects', 'imagery', 'such', 'deep', 'red', 'white', 'background', 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'certain', 'flashes', '6.6.6', 'setting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Italy', 'England', 'Israel', 'architecture', 'building', 'matter', 'how', 'mundane', 'breath', 'taking', 'scene', 'dark', 'gritty', 'ancient', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Schrieber', 'absolutely', 'together', 'story', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'loved', 'original', 'love', 'good', 'horror/thriller', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'Omen', 'top', 'being', 'gory', 'captivating', 'thrilling', 'even', 'have', 'plenty', 'what', 'always', 'call', 'cheap', 'scares', 'where', 'will', 'literally', 'jump', 'air', 'sound', 'something', 'jumping', 'out', 'crashing', 'down', 'being', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'always', 'lot', 'fun', 'Omen', 'worth', 'seeing', '9/10']",N/A

THIS IS WHY PEOPLE REMAKE OLD HORROR MOVIES DIFFERENT FROM THE ORGINAL FORMAT! I also don't get the reviewer who says this is ""not as good as the original"" To me this is the original. Same deaths, same story, no surprises. Why not improve on it? I was hoping for something totally new with more action, more modernization, more deaths, more fx, and maybe even a little more of Damien's life: growing up and taking over the world. They could have done way more with this movie. I know other horror fans are going to hate me for saying this, but I must first promise you, I am as big of a horror movie fan as they come, If I wasn't, I would not have ran out and seen this movie on 6-6-06. With that being said, I always though the original Omen was very boring. Unfortunately, this movie captures that aspect of the original all too well! At least it does have more action in it than the da vinci code!Verdict: I must agree with the guy who said ""Unnecessary remake"" If you really want to see this new Omen movie, then just save yourself  several dollars and go rent it for a couple bucks at your local video store. It is literally the same movie. I will give it credit for the improved deaths scenes. Which was the only highlights of the movie, but improved as they were, in the end, they were the same deaths as the original. More gore please! Its not a bad movie, I didn't dislike it. I just felt like I rented the original Omen movie again and paid way too much to see it on a big screen.",3,"Too much like the original, I didn't see any improvement outside the fx",1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2838,"['review', 'die', 'hard', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'Sorry', 'first', 'must', 'put', 'smack', 'down', 'bible', 'nut', 'bashing', 'movie', 'annoying', 'guy', 'quoting', 'bible', 'please', 'feel', 'free', 'research', 'what', 'am', 'tell', 'Just', 'last', 'year', 'discovered', 'fragment', 'oldest', 'surviving', 'copy', 'new', 'testament', 'was', 'wrote', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'third', 'century', 'Basically', 'scholars', 'deciphered', 'oldest', 'documents', 'determined', 'mark', 'beast', 'closer', '616', 'So', 'much', '6', ""o'clock"", '6', 'day', '6', 'month', 'garbage', 'Am', 'saying', 'are', 'right', 'No', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'way', 'one', 'really', 'clue', 'really', 'happened', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'suppositious', 'rules', 'live', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concern', 'today', ""n't"", 'even', '6-6-6.', '6-6-2006.6-6-6', 'happened', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'world', 'end', '6', ""o'clock"", 'day', 'Phfft', 'Again', 'sorry', 'delay', 'now', 'review', 'think', 'funny', 'how', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'bashing', 'waves', 'new', 'horror', 'movie', 'keep', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'Everyone', 'original', 'was', 'better', 'say', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'original', 'Well', 'here', 'go', 'folks', 'want', 'same', 'old', 'rehash', 'movie', 'can', 'rent', 'right', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'Then', 'go', 'right', 'ahead', 'pay', 'extra', 'price', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'same', 'movie', 'THIS', 'WHY', 'PEOPLE', 'REMAKE', 'OLD', 'HORROR', 'MOVIES', 'DIFFERENT', 'FROM', 'THE', 'ORGINAL', 'FORMAT', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'reviewer', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'original', 'Same', 'deaths', 'same', 'story', 'surprises', 'Why', 'not', 'improve', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'totally', 'new', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'modernization', 'more', 'deaths', 'more', 'fx', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'Damien', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'way', 'more', 'movie', 'know', 'other', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'saying', 'must', 'first', 'promise', 'am', 'as', 'big', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'come', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'not', 'have', 'ran', 'out', 'seen', 'movie', '6-6-06', 'being', 'said', 'always', 'original', 'Omen', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'aspect', 'original', 'too', 'well', 'least', 'have', 'more', 'action', 'da', 'vinci', 'code', 'Verdict', 'must', 'agree', 'guy', 'who', 'said', 'Unnecessary', 'remake', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'new', 'Omen', 'movie', 'then', 'just', 'save', 'several', 'dollars', 'go', 'rent', 'couple', 'bucks', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'literally', 'same', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'improved', 'deaths', 'scenes', 'was', 'only', 'highlights', 'movie', 'improved', 'were', 'end', 'were', 'same', 'deaths', 'original', 'More', 'gore', 'please', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'just', 'felt', 'rented', 'original', 'Omen', 'movie', 'again', 'paid', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'see', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

Culbertson ""sjculb3""","[14, 24]","I was surprised when Mia Farrow went on CNN and praised the quality of the orginal Omen and then had the nerve to say ""this version is way scarier"". Needless to say, she was incredibly wrong.There is almost no need to mention the original Omen....it had incredibly talented stars who were masters at creating an image of psychological horror.Since its original release in the '70s it has been a wildly talked about film. This version however seems desperate to follow the original script in hopes that it will horrify a new generation.The first 25 minutes of the film seem like the director is desperate to fast forward the film. We are treated to a tiny montage of Damien growing quickly, the Father becoming the Ambassador and at the same time, trying to prove that the couple really are in love with one another. The rest, sadly, is just poor acting.Julia Stiles, Mom, goes from loving parent to, for no apparent reason, a woman on the edge. There is no gradual transition so we can grasp how she gets from point A to B. Liev Schreiber, Dad, pretty much sleep walks through most of the film and his emotions seem rehearsed.One minute he seems keen on slicing Damien up, the next he pulls this ""oh I cant do it"" out of nowhere. I can only say that David Thewlis, the photographer has any sort of acting ability. Mia Farrow is horribly, horribly miscast and looks like she wants to read everyone a fairy tale and give us a cup of hot cocoa rather than protect the Devil's child.And Damien?? Way to old and looks more like he is spoiled than scary.This is the same script as the original....almost word for word (except the intro with the Vatican).Hollywood seems intent on making bad remakes of classic films. Why? Money seems to be the only thing I can think of. There is no new interpretation, no grand vision by the director, no inclusion of new fact or myth....just a tired, stagnant remake.Watch the orginal....watch it twice...or three times.

This is an almost scene-for-scene retelling of the original film, which is one of my favorite horror flicks of all time.  Did they improve on the original?  Not even remotely.Liev Schreiber sleepwalks his way through this entire movie, displaying all of about 2 different expressions (this is not a guy you'd want to play poker against, I guess!).  Much different that Gregory Peck's performance in the original.  Of course, Gregory was a much better actor.The kid in the original was a truly creepy little tyke.  The kid in this one is more of a pop-eyed mute.  He looks kind of like Brandon Cruz on amphetamines.Mia Farrow did a nice job as Mrs. Baylock, but the nasty, evil malevolence that Billie Whitlaw gave to the role is nowhere to be found here.Patrick Troughton (the priest) and David Warner (the photographer) were MUCH better in their roles than the guys are in this version, 'nuff said.They even managed to screw up the scene in the burial ground, which was easily the scariest part of the original film.  That scene still freaks me out to this day, but in the remake?  Blah...  There is none of the brooding aura of dread that was a highlight of the 1st film.  Schreiber gave us none of the fear/heartache emotions that Peck did SO well.  The unveiling of what lies within the tombs was almost anticlimatic, and I swear that they stole the EXACT SAME skeletons from the original flick.So why 3 stars?  Mainly for Mia Farrow's performance, and for the updated version of the famous ""beheading"" scene.

Her husband Robert (Liev Schreiber) knows this, and without consulting her first, switches the stillborn with another baby.  They name the child Damien (as in demon).  At Damien's (4th) birthday [party], their nanny commits suicide by hanging herself by the house, saying aloud it's ""all for you [Damien]""  After that incident, another woman is `hired' to be the new nanny.  I didn't like this nanny, and I think she was really the bad one, instead of Damien.  Anyways, one day all three of them (mom, dad, and Damien) are on their way to church.  Approaching the church, Damien gets nervous and feverish.  When they arrive at the church, Damien throws a big fit.  Okay, if I was there, I'd think something was really messed up with my child, and I would have him checked out by a doctor as soon as possible!!  Another incident is when Katherine takes Damien and a bunch of other kids to the zoo.  Damien goes to see the monkeys by himself, while the other kids go in separate directions.  The monkeys notice Damien and are afraid.  The big gorilla suddenly tries to break through the glass (I guess to try and kill Damien).  After that unpleasant incident, Katherine thinks there is something really wrong with her son.  She sees a therapist for this.  When Katherine falls from the top floor of her house, she winds up in the hospital.  She isn't dead, but she's badly injured.  When she `mysteriously' dies one day, and Robert finds out, he takes immediate action.

1012788,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B000HCO87C,Steven Hancock,"[1, 2]","Richard Donner's 1976 film ""The Omen"" is one of the creepiest films ever made. That filmed offered chills, thrills, great music by Jerry Goldsmith, and fine performances by the likes of Gregory Peck and others. With Donner's fantastic direction, the original remains a classic that will stand the test of time.John Moore's remake of ""The Omen"" is everything that Donner's film was, and therein lies the problem. Moore's film changes very little from the original script, so scenes that were once chilling are now cliche. All he does is add a little more gore to the mix, which doesn't help much at all. There are maybe one or two good ""jump"" scenes here, but that's it.The cast does an OK job. David Thewlis and Julia Stiles are actually better in their respective roles than David Warner and Lee Remick were in the original, but that's it. Mia Farrow tries to be creepy, but Billie Whitelaw was more chilling as Damien's nanny. The kid playing Damien does the exact same thing the original kid did, which makes the character less chilling, though the fact that he looks like a young version of Adolph Hitler does give him a bit of a creepy look.To me, Liev Schreiber was ineffective as Thorne. He's no Gregory Peck, though he tries very hard to sound like him in several scenes. He's a good actor, but this rolle was not suited for him. Peter Postlethwaite did an OK job as Father Brennan, but Patrick Troughton (The Second Doctor of TV's ""Doctor Who"") was much better in the role.Overall, Moore's remake of ""The Omen"" is your average horror film package, with few chills, and a predictable plot. If you want to see a chilling horror film, then view Donner's original classic. As for this film, I recommend it only to horror-film lovers.Movie/DVD Grade: C",3,"TOO CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL, AND LACKING SOME CHILLS!",1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,1756,"['Richard', 'Donner', '1976', 'film', 'Omen', 'one', 'creepiest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'filmed', 'offered', 'chills', 'thrills', 'great', 'music', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'fine', 'performances', 'likes', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'others', 'Donner', 'fantastic', 'direction', 'original', 'classic', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time.John', 'Moore', 'remake', 'Omen', 'everything', 'Donner', 'film', 'was', 'therein', 'problem', 'Moore', 'film', 'changes', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'script', 'so', 'scenes', 'were', 'once', 'chilling', 'are', 'now', 'cliche', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'gore', 'mix', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'are', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'jump', 'scenes', 'here', 'it.The', 'cast', 'OK', 'job', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'respective', 'roles', 'David', 'Warner', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'were', 'original', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'be', 'creepy', 'Billie', 'Whitelaw', 'was', 'more', 'chilling', 'Damien', 'nanny', 'kid', 'playing', 'Damien', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'original', 'kid', 'did', 'character', 'less', 'chilling', 'fact', 'young', 'version', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'give', 'bit', 'creepy', 'look.To', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'was', 'ineffective', 'Thorne', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'very', 'hard', 'sound', 'several', 'scenes', 'good', 'actor', 'rolle', 'was', 'not', 'suited', 'Peter', 'Postlethwaite', 'did', 'OK', 'job', 'Father', 'Brennan', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Second', 'Doctor', 'TV', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'role.Overall', 'Moore', 'remake', 'Omen', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'package', 'few', 'chills', 'predictable', 'plot', 'want', 'see', 'chilling', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'view', 'Donner', 'original', 'classic', 'film', 'recommend', 'only', 'horror-film', 'lovers.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'C']",N/A

The original ""Omen"" has gone down in Hollywood as a classic so it was only a matter of time before it was remade for newer audiences. Another great thing about the remake is there are better production values in it including wonderful camera work, some new special effects, and innovative editing. The leads, however, are nowhere near as great as Lee Remick and Gregory Peck, but to their credit they do try their best. Mia Farrow is great as the nanny, but Billie Whitelaw who played Mrs. Baylock in the original, will always own the role as she displayed one of the best villins in 1970's cinema.

In the case of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and many others, they've completely screwed up the remakes.But I loved the original THE OMEN in 1976 and I really enjoyed the remake this past summer of 2006.For a change, the filmmakers respected the original story enough to retain its best aspects.  They even brought the original screenwriter on board to update his own script.  They assembled a very talented cast that holds its own, especially Liev Shrieber.  Watch his expressions and how he says his lines.  It's an excellent performance of a button-down man driven to the point of trying to kill his own son.You realize how far out of his depth he is when he asks his wife's psychiatrist, ""Do you believe in God?""  (A line not from the original).Casting Mia Farrow from ROSEMARY'S BABY as the demonic maid was brilliant.I wasn't so wild about the kid, to be honest, but he's more of a symbol than an actual role and the story is how everyone reacts to him.  His eyes were intense enough that he might have been more effective if kept a blank look instead of trying to look like the son of the devil.  Just a thought.At first I was disappointed that they didn't use Jerry Goldsmith's original Oscar-winning ""black mass"" score...but then I admired the film for having its own soundtrack.Now that all the die-hard fans of the original have hopefully calmed down from slamming the mere thought of remaking THE OMEN, give this one a chance.This is how a remake should be made.",5,"Now that it's on DVD, give this cool remake a chance",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,1617,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'deluge', 'remakes', 'because', 'grew', 'up', 'when', 'originals', 'first', 'hit', 'theatres', ""'ve"", 'been', 'versions', 'case', 'THE', 'POSEIDON', 'ADVENTURE', 'many', 'others', ""'ve"", 'completely', 'screwed', 'up', 'remakes.But', 'loved', 'original', 'THE', 'OMEN', '1976', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'remake', 'past', 'summer', '2006.For', 'change', 'filmmakers', 'respected', 'original', 'story', 'enough', 'retain', 'best', 'aspects', 'even', 'brought', 'original', 'screenwriter', 'board', 'update', 'own', 'script', 'assembled', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'own', 'especially', 'Liev', 'Shrieber', 'Watch', 'expressions', 'how', 'lines', 'excellent', 'performance', 'button-down', 'man', 'driven', 'point', 'trying', 'kill', 'own', 'son.You', 'realize', 'how', 'far', 'depth', 'when', 'wife', 'psychiatrist', 'Do', 'believe', 'God', 'line', 'not', 'original', '.Casting', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'demonic', 'maid', 'was', 'brilliant.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'wild', 'kid', 'be', 'honest', 'more', 'symbol', 'actual', 'role', 'story', 'how', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'were', 'intense', 'enough', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'kept', 'blank', 'look', 'instead', 'trying', 'look', 'son', 'devil', 'Just', 'thought.At', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'original', 'Oscar-winning', 'black', 'mass', 'score', 'then', 'admired', 'film', 'having', 'own', 'soundtrack.Now', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'have', 'hopefully', 'calmed', 'down', 'slamming', 'mere', 'thought', 'remaking', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'give', 'one', 'chance.This', 'how', 'remake', 'should', 'be', 'made']",N/A

For those who haven't seen the original, this remake won't suffer by comparison and might be a 4-star film.The original version of the Omen is an acknowledged classic.  This remake is surprisingly faithful to the earlier version but consequently has little to justify its existence.  Although the remake has its creepy moments, the original movie has more sustained suspense, in part because films from the 1970s often look more ""real"" than contemporary Hollywood blockbusters.  In addition, the original version had a better score and a stronger sense of the uncanny.  Perhaps most disappointing is that while the original movie brought something innovative and disturbing to the cineplex, this remake is recycling tropes from decades ago.Was I the only person offended by how the new version uses 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina for cheap chills at the beginning of the film?  (How parochial of Hollywood to use Hurricane Katrina for a prophecy about how rising waters would kill hundreds of thousands of people.  Many more people were killed by the Asian tsunami in 2004.)One additional point (and plot spoiler): I found the violent death of Mia Farrow in the film to be offputting (not scary, just disturbing).

1012799,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HCO87C,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","The 2006 remake of `The Omen' looks like a carbon copy of the original that was made 30 years ago. There are changes done to several important scenes, but the most of the ingredients that shocked the audiences in 1976 remains untouched. So if you have already seen the original starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, you may as well forget about this new one, and watch the original again on DVD.Not that this remake is a poorly-done copy. It is directed by John Moore (who previously did a remake of `Flight of the Phoenix'), and at least he didn't add any unnecessary changes to the story of little boy Damien, around whom several people die or get killed in a most violent and bizarre way. At the same time, for those who still remember the details of the original, it would be unexciting experience to follow the plot about the far-fetched demonic conspiracy surrounding the sulky boy Damien.But of course, there are differences, and not many of them are good ones. This time the father of Damien, the distinguished US ambassador Robert Thorn is played by Liev Schreiber, and his wife Katherine by Julia Stiles. Their casting turns out the weakest point of the film, which needs more convincing acting from the leads. And you know, first of all, who thought of the misguided idea of lovely Julia Stiles as the mother of Damien?Besides that, in spite of the new film's reference to the several recent real-life tragic incidents, the story of `The Omen' is no longer potent. The contrived story of the original was barely covered by Richard Donner's tactfully presented shocking death scenes, but under the new circumstances - new cast, new director, and new millennium -- everything about the film's story looks only unbelievable.However, there are some good things about the film. The photography is always crisp and stylish, with the clever use of the exotic locations. Each set-piece about death scenes is competently done even though many of us know their results. In fact, the greatest scare comes from a human. The best thing in the film is Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock who gives a truly scary moment as creepy nanny, true scares that do not rely on the clich&eacute;d use of sudden big sound.David Thewlis, Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite also appear. Damien is played by newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick. And yes, the boy is creepy, too.Technically speaking, John Moore's `The Omen' is efficient enough, but there is nothing powerful or shocking about his storytelling or scares that would justify the decision to remake the original.",3,(2.5 STARS) Just OK Remake with Scene-Stealing Mia Farrow,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2549,"['2006', 'remake', 'Omen', 'looks', 'carbon', 'copy', 'original', 'was', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'changes', 'done', 'several', 'important', 'scenes', 'most', 'ingredients', 'shocked', 'audiences', '1976', 'remains', 'untouched', 'So', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'original', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'forget', 'new', 'one', 'watch', 'original', 'again', 'DVD.Not', 'remake', 'poorly-done', 'copy', 'directed', 'John', 'Moore', 'who', 'previously', 'did', 'remake', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'Damien', 'whom', 'several', 'people', 'die', 'get', 'killed', 'most', 'violent', 'bizarre', 'way', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'details', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'unexciting', 'experience', 'follow', 'plot', 'far-fetched', 'demonic', 'conspiracy', 'surrounding', 'sulky', 'boy', 'Damien.But', 'course', 'are', 'differences', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'time', 'father', 'Damien', 'distinguished', 'US', 'ambassador', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'played', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'casting', 'out', 'weakest', 'point', 'film', 'more', 'convincing', 'acting', 'leads', 'know', 'first', 'who', 'thought', 'misguided', 'idea', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'mother', 'Damien', 'spite', 'new', 'film', 'reference', 'several', 'recent', 'real-life', 'tragic', 'incidents', 'story', 'Omen', 'longer', 'potent', 'contrived', 'story', 'original', 'was', 'barely', 'covered', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'tactfully', 'presented', 'shocking', 'death', 'scenes', 'new', 'circumstances', 'new', 'cast', 'new', 'director', 'new', 'millennium', 'everything', 'film', 'story', 'only', 'unbelievable.However', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'photography', 'always', 'crisp', 'stylish', 'clever', 'use', 'exotic', 'locations', 'set-piece', 'death', 'scenes', 'competently', 'done', 'even', 'many', 'know', 'results', 'fact', 'greatest', 'scare', 'human', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Mrs.', 'Baylock', 'who', 'truly', 'scary', 'moment', 'creepy', 'nanny', 'true', 'scares', 'do', 'not', 'rely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'use', 'sudden', 'big', 'sound.David', 'Thewlis', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'also', 'appear', 'Damien', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Seamus', 'Davey-Fitzpatrick', 'yes', 'boy', 'creepy', 'too.Technically', 'speaking', 'John', 'Moore', 'Omen', 'efficient', 'enough', 'nothing', 'powerful', 'shocking', 'storytelling', 'scares', 'would', 'justify', 'decision', 'remake', 'original']",N/A

Sorry but Julia Stiles is too butch and too cool to play a part that was played by Lee Remick who gave the character of Kathy class and likeability.  Leiv Schreiber, who I love, was also not for this movie. He's too cool.  Maybe better choices would have been George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.Mia Farrow as Mrs. Balock just didn't work.  She's too delicate and doesn't look like a demon.  The boy who plays Damien is awful.  He's non-descript except to say that his acting is bad.  He looked at the camera a few times and when he was supposed to look menacing, he either looked like he was sulking or looked like a kid just play acting.  In the scene in the car, he just didn't rough up his mom like a wild little animal like the original Damien.  And let's face it, you can't compare this child to the little boy in the original Damien.  Little Harvey Stevens had that little smirk that was beautiful AND creepy.On the plus side, the added scenes which were not in the original movie were very good, such as the creepy images that come to their minds and especially the gut wrenching scene in Mrs. Thorn's hospital room when she's visited by Mrs. Balock.  Very creepy and very sad.  So, I thought it was good but it could've been much better with the right cast.",3,COULD'VE BEEN VERY GOOD WITH THE RIGHT CAST!,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,1424,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'ruination', 'classic', 'one', 'bad', 'casting', 'absolutely', 'abominable', 'choice', 'high-end', 'actors', 'play', 'story', 'Sorry', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'too', 'butch', 'too', 'cool', 'play', 'part', 'was', 'played', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'who', 'gave', 'character', 'Kathy', 'class', 'likeability', 'Leiv', 'Schreiber', 'who', 'love', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'movie', 'too', 'cool', 'Maybe', 'better', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones.Mia', 'Farrow', 'Mrs.', 'Balock', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'delicate', ""n't"", 'look', 'demon', 'boy', 'who', 'Damien', 'awful', 'non-descript', 'say', 'acting', 'bad', 'looked', 'camera', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'menacing', 'either', 'looked', 'was', 'sulking', 'looked', 'kid', 'just', 'play', 'acting', 'scene', 'car', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'rough', 'up', 'mom', 'wild', 'little', 'animal', 'original', 'Damien', 'let', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'child', 'little', 'boy', 'original', 'Damien', 'Little', 'Harvey', 'Stevens', 'had', 'little', 'smirk', 'was', 'beautiful', 'AND', 'creepy.On', 'plus', 'side', 'added', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'such', 'creepy', 'come', 'minds', 'especially', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'hospital', 'room', 'when', 'visited', 'Mrs.', 'Balock', 'Very', 'creepy', 'very', 'sad', 'So', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'better', 'right', 'cast']",N/A
1012802,AY3FXAAUZ0CYV,B000HCO87C,WC Alaska,"[2, 3]","I was fortunate enough to see the original when it came out, and of course the movie was brilliant. What I like about the remake as with recent ones, is that there's an air of sophistication that the originals lacked. the times changed, and acting and film styles grow and evolve along with the rest of society and technology. The colorization and sound of the movie is excellent, as is the music.The basic premise of the movie is that a youngish couple from America working for the ambassador to Italy have a baby in a Catholic hospital under suspicious circumstances. The ambassador and his wife are transferred to England as deputy ambassador when the ambassador dies tragically.  The couple have a seemingly idealistic life but their son is the center of many odd and often tragic events to the point that his mother doesn't even want to be around him.Eventually as the ambassador discovers the truth through investigation with a photographer, he is forced to examine the consequences of his decisions and must make some life altering decisions himself.The movie is intelligently made, and is a perfect modern suspense/supernatural story.  There is a new leanness to modern movies where there's less dialog and more symbolism that allow the readers to get a gut feeling of the plot and story. I like that style. Parts of the movie were grittier than the original which lines up with the times.The photographer is an excellent character as well as the priest, ambassador and wife. I'm not familiar with the actors, but they did their job well.I think there was enough of an ""upgrade"" to the original movie that it would be worth it to see this one even if you liked the original. I went out and bought this one!

There are a few new things, a few changed bits, overall it even seemed that the camera shots were the same for the most part.  Now, if it were a different take on the original everyone would be ragging on it for straying from the theme of the original, but i think the almost picture perfect remake was the problem for most.in the end; great film.

Butler ""Mudvayne Freak""","[3, 7]","I unlike alot of the other reviewers of this film, did not see the original, therefore I had nothing to compare this remake too. But then again I went into the theater and hoping to see at least a very good film if nothing more. I didnt expect spectuclar work, or a masterpiece by any sence of the word. Therefore again maybe thats why I wasnt disapointed with this.A reviewer said that the reason he didnt think he liked this movie was because of the little boy damien and his lack of acting or his cold nature. But then again he's the son of satan is he suppost to be going around handing out candy and singing songs? C'mon dude seriously, get a grip on reality. This is what they call a movie, it is not REAL!?!. Some of you people really and truely make me laugh at your ignorance. ""I'm going to go see the Omen, its about a little boy that is the son of the devil, i bet he's going to be a really nice well mannered young man""....Idiot.Anyway for those of you that have not seen this movie and are intrested dont let these people be the reason you dont see the film.
