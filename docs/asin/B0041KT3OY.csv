This three hour film is the end of the series. Frost demonstrates again his dry wit, aggressiveness, and his determination to solve crimes even when his superior officer or others tell him otherwise.There are three plots in this film. Frost is determined to capture a man he and other cops consider the leader of a dope ring and dog fights. An attempt at a dog fight fails, and Frost is determined to continue and use any legal means to get him placed in jail. This man's son thinks that another boy told the police about the dog fight and caused the raid, and during a quarrel kills him. The murder is seen by a close female friend of Frost. The boy's father, the criminal, decides to threaten the woman to get her to refuse to testify.The second plot focuses on Frost and this woman, her two teen-age children, and her former husband. Frost and the woman are attracted to each other and bond sexually. Will they marry?The third plot is totally unrelated, or so it appears. Someone is performing felonies, including robbery, defacement of property, and murder, that are remarkably similar to crimes that Frost investigated a decade ago and was unable to solve.

1381869,A28YDMI499J1X9,B0041KT3OY,J. Janssen,"[50, 51]","Season 15 consists of a single two part episode that by all accounts is the finale of this generally excellent series.  It's pretty obvious Frost meanders off into the sunset at the end, but Series 13 was originally to be a finale of sorts and they came back for 2 more years.  This episode is ambiguous enough to leave open that possibility repeating itself, though realistically David Jason's age probably takes that option off the table.The story has a couple different threads that involve a dog fighting ring, a crime spree dating back 20 years, a tragic murder with it's effect on two families and, FINALLY, a successful love life for the good inspector.  Like most of the Frost stories there's a certain lack of suspense in the ""mystery"" part, but the script is involving and well enough acted to pull it off with a bitter-sweet, yet satisfying conclusion.  Phyllis Logan in particular gives a nice performance as Jack's love interest and star witness.  Most of  the series regulars are present and accounted for including Arthur White (David Jason's brother who plays Ernie Trigg),  John Lyons (George Toolan), and the absolutely brilliant Bruce Alexander (""Horn-rimmed Henry"").  However, notably absent are Carolyn Harker (WPC/DS Hazel Wallace), the late Bill Stewart (Sandy Longford), and Lindy Whiteford (Shirley Fisher).Long time fans will hardly recognize Denton*.  In the earlier episodes it was always portrayed as a gritty backwater of some undisclosed urban center.  Recent stories have shown it spruced up, and this one portrays the town as positively yuppified; more characteristic of Morse's Oxford or Barnaby's fictional Causton.  While the earliest episodes were pretty dark, the production began to hit it's stride about halfway through the series by introducing more comedic Frost/Mullet contretemps and focussing on middle class story lines which elevated the individual episodes considerably. Unfortunately this occasionally comes across as buffoonish when the aging Frost scales tall buildings, chases down perpetrators, and engages in fights while his much younger and fitter compatriots only show up in time to cart off the loser.  In a later episode he singlehandedly  saves a drowning victim from certain death in a underground water treatment plant and in another fends off an enraged Bengal tiger (I'm not making this stuff up) with a handy broomstick. Even more ludicrous is a romantic relationship played out over series 11 and 13 where Frost gets involved with a girl young enough to be his, take your pick, daughter or granddaughter.  However, to be fair, David Jason balked at continuing the run when the producers wanted to keep the series going well past it's prime and announced at a 2008 press conference that Frost would be retiring.  Despite producing 15 series there's only 38 films, though several of these are 2 parters and were shown as separate episodes in the home market.  The series debuted in 1992 on ITV and ended with this finale in 2010, a span of 19 years.  Given that David Jason was 70 years of age at the time this episode was filmed, it was pretty obvious the end was near even though the series remained extremely popular and was always one of the highest rated UK TV shows.In all, this is a fitting finale and one of the better episodes in the Frost collection. Be sure not to miss the alternate endings in the ""bonus feature"" as they convey an entirely different feel to the production.  A fine series that ran for 19 years, albeit sporadically over the last half of it's run;  just wish there were more.*  There are at least a dozen Dentons in the UK, but this one is purely fictional and comes from the R.D. Wingfield novels.  Some of the episodes were filmed around York, while others claim close proximity to Crawley and Surrey. One of the episodes in Series 4 showed a closeup of files purporting to be from the Thames Valley Police. The actual location of Frost's Denton is likely to remain one of life's little mysteries.",5,Michael Vick isn't going to like this one,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,3992,"['Season', '15', 'consists', 'single', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'accounts', 'finale', 'generally', 'excellent', 'series', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Frost', 'meanders', 'off', 'sunset', 'end', 'Series', '13', 'was', 'originally', 'be', 'finale', 'sorts', 'came', 'back', '2', 'more', 'years', 'episode', 'ambiguous', 'enough', 'leave', 'open', 'possibility', 'repeating', 'though', 'realistically', 'David', 'Jason', 'age', 'probably', 'option', 'table.The', 'story', 'couple', 'different', 'threads', 'involve', 'dog', 'fighting', 'ring', 'crime', 'spree', 'dating', 'back', '20', 'years', 'tragic', 'murder', 'effect', 'two', 'families', 'FINALLY', 'successful', 'love', 'life', 'good', 'inspector', 'most', 'Frost', 'stories', 'certain', 'lack', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'part', 'script', 'involving', 'well', 'enough', 'acted', 'pull', 'off', 'bitter-sweet', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'particular', 'nice', 'performance', 'Jack', 'love', 'interest', 'star', 'witness', 'Most', 'series', 'regulars', 'are', 'present', 'accounted', 'including', 'Arthur', 'White', 'David', 'Jason', 'brother', 'who', 'Ernie', 'Trigg', 'John', 'Lyons', 'George', 'Toolan', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Bruce', 'Alexander', 'Horn-rimmed', 'Henry', 'However', 'notably', 'absent', 'are', 'Carolyn', 'Harker', 'WPC/DS', 'Hazel', 'Wallace', 'late', 'Bill', 'Stewart', 'Sandy', 'Longford', 'Lindy', 'Whiteford', 'Shirley', 'Fisher', '.Long', 'time', 'fans', 'will', 'hardly', 'recognize', 'Denton*', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'was', 'always', 'portrayed', 'gritty', 'backwater', 'undisclosed', 'urban', 'center', 'Recent', 'stories', 'have', 'shown', 'spruced', 'up', 'one', 'town', 'positively', 'yuppified', 'more', 'characteristic', 'Morse', 'Oxford', 'Barnaby', 'fictional', 'Causton', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'dark', 'production', 'began', 'hit', 'stride', 'halfway', 'series', 'introducing', 'more', 'comedic', 'Frost/Mullet', 'contretemps', 'focussing', 'middle', 'class', 'story', 'lines', 'elevated', 'individual', 'episodes', 'considerably', 'Unfortunately', 'occasionally', 'across', 'buffoonish', 'when', 'aging', 'Frost', 'scales', 'tall', 'buildings', 'down', 'perpetrators', 'fights', 'much', 'younger', 'fitter', 'compatriots', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'cart', 'off', 'loser', 'later', 'episode', 'singlehandedly', 'drowning', 'victim', 'certain', 'death', 'underground', 'water', 'treatment', 'plant', 'fends', 'off', 'enraged', 'Bengal', 'tiger', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'stuff', 'up', 'handy', 'broomstick', 'Even', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'played', 'out', 'series', '11', '13', 'where', 'Frost', 'involved', 'girl', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'take', 'pick', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'However', 'be', 'fair', 'David', 'Jason', 'balked', 'continuing', 'run', 'when', 'producers', 'wanted', 'keep', 'series', 'going', 'well', 'prime', 'announced', '2008', 'press', 'conference', 'Frost', 'would', 'be', 'retiring', 'producing', '15', 'series', 'only', '38', 'films', 'several', 'are', '2', 'parters', 'were', 'shown', 'separate', 'episodes', 'home', 'market', 'series', 'debuted', '1992', 'ITV', 'ended', 'finale', '2010', 'span', '19', 'years', 'Given', 'David', 'Jason', 'was', '70', 'years', 'age', 'time', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'end', 'was', 'even', 'series', 'remained', 'extremely', 'popular', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'highest', 'rated', 'UK', 'TV', 'shows.In', 'all', 'fitting', 'finale', 'one', 'better', 'episodes', 'Frost', 'collection', 'Be', 'sure', 'not', 'miss', 'alternate', 'endings', 'bonus', 'feature', 'convey', 'entirely', 'different', 'feel', 'production', 'fine', 'series', 'ran', '19', 'years', 'sporadically', 'last', 'half', 'run', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', '*', 'are', 'least', 'dozen', 'Dentons', 'UK', 'one', 'purely', 'fictional', 'R.D', 'Wingfield', 'novels', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'York', 'others', 'claim', 'close', 'proximity', 'Crawley', 'Surrey', 'One', 'episodes', 'Series', '4', 'showed', 'closeup', 'files', 'purporting', 'be', 'Thames', 'Valley', 'Police', 'actual', 'location', 'Frost', 'Denton', 'likely', 'remain', 'one', 'life', 'little', 'mysteries']",Touch of Frost: Season 15

1381874,A16XRPF40679KG,B0041KT3OY,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","This is has been my all time favorite british detective show ever since it came out in 1992. Unfortunately the brits make short seasons and this one is the shortest and sadly the final one. Itv went bankrupt and even hit shows they produced went under; this one at least got a final and this is it. Like all frosties this features excellent gritty stories and lots of great acting.  This one is no different and the picture quality is excellent as well. Goodbye frostie, however the price as usual is steep for a single two parter series but that's what you get over here I guess. Will there ever be another brit detective show this good again? I hope so. the disc has two alternate endings as well as they try to figure who to bump off. no other frost has special features so this is a plus. I will say that perhaps the need to bump off a character due to a jealous husband wasn't the series finest moment but at least they used it to good effect as the frost character realizes he's missed out on living his life. I think it was a good move but one could have hoped for a villian to do the actual killing. That being said this was still a frost two parter and that's was good enough to enjoy by any standards of brit tv.",5,short season high price but the best brit detective show out there,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,1222,"['been', 'time', 'favorite', 'british', 'detective', 'show', 'ever', 'came', 'out', '1992', 'Unfortunately', 'brits', 'make', 'short', 'seasons', 'one', 'shortest', 'sadly', 'final', 'one', 'Itv', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'even', 'hit', 'shows', 'produced', 'went', 'one', 'least', 'got', 'final', 'frosties', 'excellent', 'gritty', 'stories', 'lots', 'great', 'acting', 'one', 'different', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Goodbye', 'frostie', 'however', 'price', 'usual', 'steep', 'single', 'two', 'parter', 'series', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'guess', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'brit', 'detective', 'show', 'good', 'again', 'hope', 'so', 'disc', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'as', 'well', 'try', 'figure', 'who', 'bump', 'off', 'other', 'frost', 'special', 'features', 'plus', 'will', 'say', 'perhaps', 'need', 'bump', 'off', 'character', 'due', 'jealous', 'husband', 'was', ""n't"", 'series', 'finest', 'moment', 'least', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'frost', 'character', 'missed', 'out', 'living', 'life', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'villian', 'do', 'actual', 'killing', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'frost', 'two', 'parter', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'standards', 'brit', 'tv']",Touch of Frost: Season 15

1381877,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B0041KT3OY,Richard B. Schwartz,"[16, 17]","A Touch of Frost has been on the British telly for 17 years.  All good things must end.  British coppers must retire at 60; Sir David is 70 and felt that the series had to end because of the implausibility of Frost still being on the force at his advanced age.  Here is the conclusion and what a conclusion it is.  Three endings were shot and Sir David was permitted to choose the ending that he preferred.  (How often would that have happened in Hollywood?)  I believe that he chose the wrong ending.  I won't spoil it, but I would have chosen alternate ending number one.  (Both alternate endings are included as special features.)  All three of the endings are powerful and plausible; I like alternate number one because of its roundedness and because it ennobled.  You have to watch to see what I mean.The concluding episode is a very powerful two-parter, with an A and B plot.  The A plot concerns a drug dealer with a dog fighting operation on the side.  This very unsavory character is a hateful bully with a sleazoid solicitor, both of whom enjoy badgering Frost.  The B plot involves a set of crimes from the past which are being replicated in the present.  In effect, the ending represents Frost's future (or lack of it, depending on the ending), the A plot his present, the B plot his past.  It is all very tight, very tidy and very moving.Although we are in the gritty world of Denton, the Thames Valley and slimeball criminals, the A plot nearly takes on the dimensions of Greek drama.  The characters are powerful, the acting superb, the conclusions shattering.  With every fine story of detection there is often a parallel personal story.  In this case, Frost finds a love interest, a woman who cares for the animals who are victimized and who simultaneously witnesses a murder.  This makes her a target for the threats and assaults perpetrated by the criminal in the A plot.  Frost needs her as a witness, but also wants her as a friend and lover.  Played by the estimable Phyllis Logan, one of Michael Kitchen's frequent co-stars, this character provides an important dimension as Frost contemplates possible futures.I can only say that this is some of the finest television I have ever seen and a value at twice the price.  (Note: despite what one reviewer said, the dvd does include subtitles, though, as always, they appear to have been done by someone who does not understand British English.)  I hated to see the series end, but what a spectacular ending.
