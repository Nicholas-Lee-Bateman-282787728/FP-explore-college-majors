Bynum,"[3, 5]","Big Sur Celebration:  This DVD has some great performances and a few interesting occurrences that show the good and the bad of the era immediately after Woodstock.  All the music is very good and well worth the purchase.  The film shows the early signs of the idiotic presumption that all music ought to be `free' (un-paid).  This has the finest moments of `hippie' music, and shows the realization that the `movement' was as dead as a doornail.",4,Just a month after Woodstock...a great concert in an odd setting,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,445,"['Big', 'Sur', 'Celebration', 'DVD', 'great', 'performances', 'few', 'interesting', 'occurrences', 'show', 'good', 'bad', 'era', 'immediately', 'Woodstock', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'purchase', 'film', 'early', 'signs', 'idiotic', 'presumption', 'music', 'ought', 'be', 'free', 'un-paid', 'finest', 'moments', 'hippie', 'music', 'realization', 'movement', 'was', 'as', 'dead', 'doornail']",Big Sur Celebration 1969

Altamont was totally different ) would be the  Woodstock video ... that one is a 5 star movie, and there probably isn't anything (of a similar genre) that can match  it, so Big Sur Celebration 1969  gets 4.5 stars.  I actually had never heard of this video until a few days before I ordered it.  I had been watching a documentary-like video of Joni Mitchel (who I consider to be unsurpassed as a musician artist of the last 45 years), and somehow (can't remember exactly how) from that video, I became aware of Big Sur Celebration 1969, in which she appears.  Since I missed her in Woodstock (I was there, she wasn't), decided to buy this.  Unfortunately, I never saw her in concert.",4,Very enjoyable for anyone who grew up in the 60's,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,849,"['would', 'actually', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'only', 'other', 'video', 'similar', 'can', 'think', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'pretty', 'similar', 'feel', 'Altamont', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'would', 'be', 'Woodstock', 'video', 'one', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'there', 'probably', ""n't"", 'anything', 'similar', 'genre', 'can', 'match', 'so', 'Big', 'Sur', 'Celebration', '1969', '4.5', 'stars', 'actually', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'video', 'few', 'days', 'ordered', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'documentary-like', 'video', 'Joni', 'Mitchel', 'who', 'consider', 'be', 'unsurpassed', 'musician', 'artist', 'last', '45', 'years', 'somehow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'how', 'video', 'became', 'aware', 'Big', 'Sur', 'Celebration', '1969', 'missed', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'decided', 'buy', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'saw', 'concert']",Big Sur Celebration 1969
