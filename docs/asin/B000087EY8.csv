734231,AO3J40SKIP7CN,B000087EY8,Alice Bright,"[1, 1]","Our children are big Land Before Time fans, and The Mysterious Island ranks as one of their favorites. They really enjoyed the exciting storyline which follows the dinosaur friends as they move to a mysterious island in search of food. Highlights of the film include the return of Chomper (the t-rex) and some really cute songs. ""Big Water"" gets all my children singing along, and ""Always There"" is a sweet and memorable tune. A very likable movie which got a thumbs up from my 8 year old down to my 2 year old!",4,One of our favorites in the Land Before Time series,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,511,"['children', 'are', 'big', 'Land', 'Time', 'fans', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'one', 'favorites', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'exciting', 'storyline', 'dinosaur', 'friends', 'move', 'mysterious', 'island', 'search', 'food', 'Highlights', 'film', 'include', 'return', 'Chomper', 't-rex', 'really', 'cute', 'songs', 'Big', 'Water', 'children', 'singing', 'along', 'Always', 'sweet', 'memorable', 'tune', 'very', 'likable', 'movie', 'got', 'thumbs', 'up', '8', 'year', 'old', '2', 'year', 'old']",N/A

734238,A39AEX2G3SVZ8L,B000087EY8,Richard,"[1, 1]","I found a Land Before Time DVD in the library a few months ago and let the kids (ages 20 months, 3,  6 years) watch it.  They were transfixed the whole time.  At that point, ""Little Foot"", ""Sarah"", ""Spike"", & ""CHOMPER"" were regular words in their vocabulary.  Over time, I found out that ""Chomper"" was their favorite character and his adventures were what interested them the most.  I thought I had found all the ""Chomper"" DVDs until I ran across ""The Mysterious Island"".  My memory fades on the number of time they watched the previous DVDs.  However, they have watched this DVD at least 8 times over the past week.  I have watched bits and pieces and think it is a cute DVD.  My wife watched the whole movie and thought it was great.  It has great songs, dinosaur sharks, Chomper's parents, and quite an assortment of other dinosaurs combined with a nice story.  From a dinosaur loving kids perspective, this DVD has everything.  I am fairly confident that any like-minded kid will love this DVD.",5,The Kids Love It,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,998,"['found', 'Land', 'Time', 'DVD', 'library', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'let', 'kids', '20', 'months', '3', '6', 'years', 'watch', 'were', 'transfixed', 'whole', 'time', 'point', 'Little', 'Foot', 'Sarah', 'Spike', 'CHOMPER', 'were', 'regular', 'words', 'vocabulary', 'time', 'found', 'out', 'Chomper', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'adventures', 'were', 'what', 'interested', 'most', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'Chomper', 'DVDs', 'ran', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'memory', 'fades', 'number', 'time', 'watched', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'However', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'least', '8', 'times', 'past', 'week', 'have', 'watched', 'bits', 'pieces', 'think', 'cute', 'DVD', 'wife', 'watched', 'whole', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'great', 'songs', 'dinosaur', 'sharks', 'Chomper', 'parents', 'quite', 'assortment', 'other', 'dinosaurs', 'combined', 'nice', 'story', 'dinosaur', 'loving', 'kids', 'perspective', 'DVD', 'everything', 'am', 'fairly', 'confident', 'like-minded', 'kid', 'will', 'love', 'DVD']",N/A
