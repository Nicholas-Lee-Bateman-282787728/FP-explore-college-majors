I was surprised at the depth of emotions expressed by the characters. Lindsay Duncan is so realistic as the put upon wife. And make no mistake, she is in an unenviable situation with the demands of family and everyone in the village. She has almost no life of her own, as is the case with anyone married to the church, so to speak. Fortunately she gains a little freedom when she takes a job to earn money for the education of one of her children. Then comes more freedom as she slowly loosens the bonds of being responsible for everything in her orbit. You can see how she blossoms as time moves forward. The supporting actors do a wonderful job with their roles but Stephen Dillane shines as the confidant and lover. Every role was realistic and I will watch the series again to catch what I missed the first go-around.

370447,A1K6PS7FWZSYXV,6303356427,J. M. Parr,"[9, 11]",On my copy of this DVD set the first DVD had the first and second episodes reversed. Make sure if you watch this that the episode identified as #2 is the one you watch first. Episode # 1 should begin with The Rector's wife  doing some  office work. Episode #2 begins with a sort of pastoral country village scene. The second DVD doesn't have any problem.,4,Buyer Alert !!!,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,354,"['copy', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'DVD', 'had', 'first', 'second', 'episodes', 'reversed', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'episode', 'identified', '2', 'one', 'watch', 'first', 'Episode', '1', 'should', 'begin', 'Rector', 'wife', 'doing', 'office', 'work', 'Episode', '2', 'begins', 'sort', 'pastoral', 'country', 'village', 'scene', 'second', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem']",Rector's Wife VHS
370448,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,6303356427,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[8, 10]","A classic story of a woman's efforts to remain a good wife while taking new risks. Anna Bouverie has spent the last 20 years of her life struggling to keep her family financially afloat, in spite of her husband's less than lavish salary in the parish.The last straw occurs when he is passed over for a promotion and Anna has to face the fact that she will have to take things into her own hands as well. But how does she do this without tipping the balance? Unfortunately, her efforts brings about the disapproval of those in the parish as well as the anger of her husband.Anna is forced to form a new identity for herself, not an easy task after all the time she's spent within the protection (and confines) of her marriage. A very believable look at the challenges faced by one woman trying to break out of her shell.",5,A must-see for fans of Trollope,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,819,"['classic', 'story', 'woman', 'efforts', 'remain', 'good', 'wife', 'taking', 'new', 'risks', 'Anna', 'Bouverie', 'spent', 'last', '20', 'years', 'life', 'struggling', 'keep', 'family', 'financially', 'afloat', 'spite', 'husband', 'less', 'lavish', 'salary', 'parish.The', 'last', 'straw', 'occurs', 'when', 'passed', 'promotion', 'Anna', 'face', 'fact', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'well', 'how', 'do', 'tipping', 'balance', 'Unfortunately', 'efforts', 'disapproval', 'parish', 'as', 'well', 'anger', 'husband.Anna', 'forced', 'form', 'new', 'identity', 'herself', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'time', 'spent', 'protection', 'confines', 'marriage', 'very', 'believable', 'look', 'challenges', 'faced', 'one', 'woman', 'trying', 'break', 'shell']",Rector's Wife VHS
370449,A2VXQL36IFQGKZ,6303356427,RALPH PETERS,"[15, 16]","THE RECTOR'S WIFE is one the most memorable British television productions from the 1990s.  The lovely and accomplished Lindsay Duncan's understated, yet powerful performance as Anna Bouverie captures all the character's frustrations, disappointments and, finally, flowering in the wake of new love and the potential of a new life away from a loveless marriage and oppressive community.  The film offers insightful comment about the nature of marriage and of the role of religion in modern society without being preachy or judgmental; if one chooses to ignore these themes, the film can just be enjoyed as fine, compelling drama.  With Miss Duncan, there is fine support from the wonderful Stephen Dillane and from Ronald Pickup and, as always, Prunella Scales.

370450,ANSADXWC7P5KM,6303356427,"Sara ""Sara So Sweet""","[2, 3]","I was pleasently surprised by this mini series. A very well written story about a woman's (Muriel Pavlow) life as a rectors wife and how it isn't really her life at all. Every move she makes and everything she says is controlled by her husband and the congregation.  When she begins to feel overwhelmed by this, her husband is so self-absorbed with the church that he forgets his duties as a husband. So, she turns to the outside world and discovers a whole new refreshing life.  She finds a job as a stocker to raise money for her daughter to attend a private school and she loves it. Now, the church and her husband are very upset that she is disgracing the church which makes her drift even farther away from them. I was very impressed with the acting and characters. I could feel the frustration she was feeling and wanted to scream with her. Stephen Dillane plays the brother of one of the heads of the church. He's a rebel and wins the heart of the rectors wife. His acting is wonderful, as usual.  Apparently, some of the scenes were edited out. I would have liked to have seen them. I don't know if it was for content or to keep the length to a minimum but, I would have enjoyed the whole thing even more. What I liked about this story is the realism of people and the church.
