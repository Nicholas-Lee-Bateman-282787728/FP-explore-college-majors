At firts i thought ""3 Shows! WOW I need to get this!"" But, please if you don't know each of this shows, don't get excited. I would actually say it is just a show and a half, because all of lord of the dance's dances are included in feet of flames with better image quality, music sound and also with a about twice as much dancers. I must admitt i was a bit disappointed when i saw ""Lord of the dance"" in DVD it had all of the problems and more that other viewers had commented about.Gold is just and interview with some dance (most repeated from riverdance or feet of flames, so there were only like 3 new ones) That is why i don't even consider the collection to have 2 shows.But all these minor problems aside, i can't give 4 stars to this because it deserves so much more. Just watching the first dance (feet of flames of course) blows you away with the coordination, and it isn't long before the music and the speed make your jaw drop to the floor as you watch every minute of the show.

He seems very honest and straightforward. He shows clips of how he started out his dancing career with the Chieftains. He tells how Moya Doherty, producer of Riverdance, approached him about doing Irish Tap Dancing during a 7-minute intermission at the 1994 Eurovision. (Michael already had an image in his head about a line of dancers across the stage all doing Irish tap) Well, it came true; the dance was a success and the rest they say is history. That is when his career, officially as a dancer, really started. He became very successful; more so when he left ""Riverdance"".You see different parts of ""Lord of the Dance"" and ""Feet of Flames"" as he's talking about his achievements. He played a flute solo for his mom in ""Feet of Flames"", explaining that ""A man cannot be macho all the time"".He explains about why he chose those exact costumes for the show. He loves a lot of color, as we all know, explaining that eye appeal is what brings a show together. (Some people criticize him about his vegas-style look to his shows)There are new numbers at the end of the tape that were filmed in Budapest, I believe. The dances were styled to appeal to the countries taste. (More royal looking--Cleopatra-like eyes on the lead girls; the little spirit was dressed in a jester-like outfit) Different!!

The mixing of music, tap elements, and ambient sounds fluctuates wildly. This always happens in the same places.My player isn't the problem. When run on different players, the DVD still manifests the same inconstant audio.Hoping that the particular DVD I bought had just been damaged in some way, I returned it as defective. After waiting close to a month for a replacement, I discovered that the new DVD performs exactly the same way the first one did.Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance are such fabulous shows, it's a shame that more care wasn't taken with the DVD. However, if you're a fan of Flatley & Company, can tolerate audio flutuations, and don't mind keeping your hand on the volume controls and intermittently having to put your ear against the speakers in order to hear something, this is the DVD for you. I do suggest that once you've turned the volume up you remain ready to turn it down quickly, because when the sound comes back it's loud enough to blow a person across the room.",3,Wonderful collection is marred by audio problems,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,1346,"['Had', 'sound', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'music', 'dancing', 'extended', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'are', 'first-rate.Unfortunately', 'volume', 'level', 'audio', 'mixing', 'are', 'map', 'particularly', 'true', 'Feet', 'Flames', 'where', 'music', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'times', 'even', 'speakers', 'full', 'volume', 'mixing', 'music', 'tap', 'elements', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'wildly', 'always', 'same', 'places.My', 'player', ""n't"", 'problem', 'When', 'run', 'different', 'players', 'DVD', 'still', 'same', 'inconstant', 'audio.Hoping', 'particular', 'DVD', 'bought', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'damaged', 'way', 'returned', 'defective', 'waiting', 'close', 'month', 'replacement', 'discovered', 'new', 'DVD', 'performs', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'first', 'one', 'did.Feet', 'Flames', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'are', 'such', 'fabulous', 'shows', 'shame', 'more', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'DVD', 'However', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Flatley', 'Company', 'can', 'tolerate', 'audio', 'flutuations', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'keeping', 'hand', 'volume', 'controls', 'intermittently', 'having', 'put', 'ear', 'speakers', 'order', 'hear', 'something', 'DVD', 'do', 'suggest', 'once', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'volume', 'remain', 'ready', 'turn', 'down', 'quickly', 'when', 'sound', 'back', 'loud', 'enough', 'blow', 'person', 'room']",N/A
