The mother that was a racer, died in a racing accident. The father despondent puts his daughter in a boarding school and disappears, but later forms a racing team and forgets about his past.The daughter leaves the school with the help of a scooter and searches out to re-bond with her father, but her father does not recognize her, so she changes her name to be close to him.Worlds are selected across the galaxy to race once every 10,000 years to determine the next Galactic Avatar to rule over all races of people. There is danger, flying cars, interstellar travel, a re-bonding of father and daughter and in the end peace.The computer animated CGI is quite note worthy when the racer is racing around the obstacles on the various planets!Rated ""G"" for all audiences.I highly recommend this Anime for old and young kids alike.",5,Oban no one nose!,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,967,"['Hi', 'purchased', 'set', 'DVD', 'liked', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Disney', 'channel.It', 'story', 'broken', 'family', 'mother', 'was', 'racer', 'died', 'racing', 'accident', 'father', 'despondent', 'daughter', 'boarding', 'school', 'disappears', 'later', 'racing', 'team', 'forgets', 'past.The', 'daughter', 'school', 'help', 'scooter', 'out', 're-bond', 'father', 'father', 'not', 'recognize', 'name', 'be', 'close', 'him.Worlds', 'are', 'selected', 'galaxy', 'race', 'once', '10,000', 'years', 'determine', 'next', 'Galactic', 'Avatar', 'rule', 'races', 'people', 'danger', 'flying', 'cars', 'interstellar', 'travel', 're-bonding', 'father', 'daughter', 'end', 'peace.The', 'computer', 'animated', 'CGI', 'quite', 'note', 'worthy', 'when', 'racer', 'racing', 'obstacles', 'various', 'planets', 'Rated', 'G', 'audiences.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Anime', 'old', 'young', 'kids', 'alike']",Oban Star-Racers Vol 1: The Alwas Cycle

1138357,A1ZGAZLH9K711I,B0012Q3SZU,Keonyn,"[7, 7]","Well this was a bit of a surprise, and a pleasant surprise at that. I was looking for a more fun anime series, as it has been awhile since I've taken on a series like that.There's no mistaking that this is a series that is a bit more family friendly than others, but it manages this without giving it that saturday morning cartoon feel. The story itself still has quite a bit of depth to it, and it runs the full range of emotions, both negative and positive. It explores major issues like danger, and death, in a way that works for a show like this without having a negative effect on its impact.The characters face death and injury, encounter personal conflicts amongst each other, feel the highs of victory and sting of defeat and so on; the story doesn't suffer from the lack of certain ""mature"" components. It's a family friendly cartoon, but manages to do so without feeling overly kiddy. Sex, blood and violence are obviously missing, which is fine since this series really wouldn't benefit from any of those. Aside from that though, it still manages to develop the characters well and provide a story with enough depth, something many series aimed at family audiences just can't pull off.The art style might take a bit of getting used to. It's a collaboration between a Japanese studio and a French studio, so while the anime element is obviously there, it does have a different feel to it. The most notable unique element of the art style is the lack of defined noses on the characters, but it works once you get adjusted to it. The color palette used and how well the colors blend makes the series really quite impressive visually. The CG also mixes in well with the 2D, it doesn't really suffer from that out of place feeling that you get in other shows where the two styles are mixed.As long as you're no the type who needs that certain ""maturity"" that anime titles loaded with fanservice, gore, or really dark storylines provide, then this is definitely worth a look. You certainly can't go wrong with an entire 26 episode series being released on two volumes under $20 a piece either.For those that are hardcore sub fans though, you might be disappointed in that the series is presented with the English dub only. It's a well done dub though, and the series was made with the intention of being broadcast internationally as well. One thing worth noting as well is that the DVD uses the opening and closing songs used in the Japanese/French version, and not the songs used in the US broadcast version.All in all it's a good series that is fun and lighthearted, but still provides enough depth and conflict to tell a good, engaging story. It's also a good deal as well as each volume has 13 episodes a piece and normally be found for around $15 (MSRP is set at 19.99). If you enjoy a series like this, then this is a good buy.",5,"Family friendly, but still engaging (solid 4-1/2 stars)",1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2838,"['Well', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'fun', 'anime', 'series', 'been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'series', 'mistaking', 'series', 'bit', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'others', 'giving', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'feel', 'story', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'depth', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'negative', 'positive', 'major', 'issues', 'danger', 'death', 'way', 'show', 'having', 'negative', 'effect', 'impact.The', 'characters', 'face', 'death', 'injury', 'encounter', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'amongst', 'other', 'feel', 'highs', 'victory', 'sting', 'defeat', 'so', 'story', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'lack', 'certain', 'mature', 'components', 'family', 'friendly', 'cartoon', 'manages', 'do', 'so', 'feeling', 'overly', 'kiddy', 'Sex', 'blood', 'violence', 'are', 'obviously', 'missing', 'fine', 'series', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'Aside', 'still', 'develop', 'characters', 'well', 'provide', 'story', 'enough', 'depth', 'something', 'many', 'series', 'aimed', 'family', 'audiences', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off.The', 'art', 'style', 'might', 'take', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'collaboration', 'Japanese', 'studio', 'French', 'studio', 'so', 'anime', 'element', 'obviously', 'there', 'have', 'different', 'feel', 'most', 'notable', 'unique', 'element', 'art', 'style', 'lack', 'defined', 'noses', 'characters', 'once', 'get', 'adjusted', 'color', 'palette', 'used', 'how', 'well', 'colors', 'blend', 'series', 'really', 'quite', 'impressive', 'visually', 'CG', 'also', 'well', '2D', ""n't"", 'really', 'suffer', 'place', 'feeling', 'get', 'other', 'shows', 'where', 'two', 'styles', 'are', 'mixed.As', 'long', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', 'certain', 'maturity', 'anime', 'titles', 'loaded', 'fanservice', 'gore', 'really', 'dark', 'storylines', 'provide', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'entire', '26', 'episode', 'series', 'being', 'released', 'two', 'volumes', '20', 'piece', 'either.For', 'are', 'hardcore', 'sub', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'series', 'presented', 'English', 'dub', 'only', 'well', 'done', 'dub', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'intention', 'being', 'broadcast', 'internationally', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'thing', 'worth', 'noting', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'opening', 'closing', 'songs', 'used', 'Japanese/French', 'version', 'not', 'songs', 'used', 'US', 'broadcast', 'version.All', 'good', 'series', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'still', 'enough', 'depth', 'conflict', 'tell', 'good', 'engaging', 'story', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'as', 'well', 'volume', '13', 'episodes', 'piece', 'normally', 'be', 'found', '15', 'MSRP', 'set', '19.99', 'enjoy', 'series', 'then', 'good', 'buy']",Oban Star-Racers Vol 1: The Alwas Cycle
