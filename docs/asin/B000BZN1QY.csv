And yes, it is.The script has no direction; the story is going nowhere, making the movie very boring to watch. The first half of the movie introduces us to the characters and leads up to the graduation. The characters are all portrayed as stupid and mean bullies. Not the kind of characters you feel sympathy for. In the middle of the movie is the graduation ceremony and the school janitor gives a loooong speech, warning the students not to do anything stupid. The second half of the movie is the graduation party, where the students all do stupid things. I think we all get the message; they did stupid things they weren't supposed to; but in case someone in the audience didn't get it, one of the characters points it out to us. There also seems to be a message about how students who get bullied should laugh about it and appreciate the attention.The production values are about as low as you would expect from a cheap porn movie, and the acting is awkward at best and pathetic at worst, with the only exception being Aloma Wright, who makes a decent job as the principal.This movie is not worth wasting time or money on.",1,Grad Night,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1193,"['had', 'check', 'movie', 'see', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'yes', 'script', 'direction', 'story', 'going', 'nowhere', 'making', 'movie', 'very', 'boring', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'characters', 'up', 'graduation', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'stupid', 'mean', 'bullies', 'Not', 'kind', 'characters', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'middle', 'movie', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'school', 'janitor', 'loooong', 'speech', 'warning', 'students', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'stupid', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'graduation', 'party', 'where', 'students', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'think', 'get', 'message', 'did', 'stupid', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'case', 'someone', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'characters', 'points', 'out', 'also', 'be', 'message', 'how', 'students', 'who', 'get', 'bullied', 'should', 'laugh', 'appreciate', 'attention.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'as', 'low', 'would', 'expect', 'cheap', 'porn', 'movie', 'acting', 'awkward', 'best', 'pathetic', 'worst', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'Aloma', 'Wright', 'who', 'decent', 'job', 'principal.This', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'wasting', 'time', 'money']",N/A
