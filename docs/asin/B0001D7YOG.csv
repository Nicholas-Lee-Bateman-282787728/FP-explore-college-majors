He thought there were cannibals in Nigeria when I believe the only cannibals in the world are some isolated peoples in South America and in New Guinea.  Otherwise this was a very spine chilling tale of someone being buried alive and crawling out of a grave.  Of a man who hates his brother because he is different/mentally ill.

800683,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B0001D7YOG,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[5, 5]","This was the last film American International Pictures did in the Poe series and unfortunately has little to do with the Poe classic.  Much tragedy hit this film as it was being produced, with one of the screenwriters dying 11 days into production.  What's up with that?The Oblong BoxThe film has a lot of atmosphere, dark colors, eerie Psycho-like music and debauchery from colonial Britain ripping off the Africans and treating them badly.  In retaliation for killing a boy from a tribe that worked a family-owned plantation, one of the Markum brothers got a voodoo curse (the start of the film has Edward being nailed to a tree, ouch).  It's a very pro-Black, anti-colonial Britain film in a lot of ways.Edward returns to England mad (as in totally nuts) and Julian (Vincent Price) has Edward locked and chained in his room.  Unable to escape, Edward hatches a plot with a witchdoctor and Julian's family lawyer, Trench. Trench has a mind of his own however, and in the confusion kinda ""forgets"" that Edward is pretending to be dead in an oblong box and ends up being buried alive.That would have been the end of the film right there but for Christopher Lee's character, a creepy doctor who likes to experiment on cadavers, the warmer the better.  As Dr. Newhartt collects Edward's remains, the remains reach up and attempt to choke the good doctor and through blackmail gets his cooperation.The overall story is somewhat predictable with a few twists and turns to keep the viewer entertained.  The prostitutes in a bar, the barfights, the murders that Edward performs (but the blood is so fake and the slashing of the throats looks very unrealistic).Four stars are mainly for the sympathetic Julian and the murderous Edward (played callously by British actor Alister Williamson).  Edward's on and off sexy maid girlfriend Sally (Sally Geeson) was a bit flighty and weird but cute, in a horror sort of way.  Hilary Dwyer (Witchfinder General (aka The Conqueror Worm from Matthew Hopkins)andCry of the Banshee / Murders in the Rue Morguealso with Price)  plays the overemotional fiancee to Julian.Recommend seeing with Scream and Scream Again, the second film where several of the actors in Oblong Box return for an encore.The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again",4,The Merchant of Menace Strikes Again!,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2265,"['was', 'last', 'film', 'American', 'International', 'Pictures', 'did', 'Poe', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'do', 'Poe', 'classic', 'Much', 'tragedy', 'hit', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'produced', 'one', 'screenwriters', 'dying', '11', 'days', 'production', 'What', 'up', 'Oblong', 'BoxThe', 'film', 'lot', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'colors', 'eerie', 'Psycho-like', 'music', 'debauchery', 'colonial', 'Britain', 'ripping', 'off', 'Africans', 'treating', 'badly', 'retaliation', 'killing', 'boy', 'tribe', 'worked', 'family-owned', 'plantation', 'one', 'Markum', 'brothers', 'got', 'voodoo', 'curse', 'start', 'film', 'Edward', 'being', 'nailed', 'tree', 'ouch', 'very', 'pro-Black', 'anti-colonial', 'Britain', 'film', 'lot', 'ways.Edward', 'returns', 'England', 'mad', 'totally', 'nuts', 'Julian', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Edward', 'locked', 'chained', 'room', 'Unable', 'escape', 'Edward', 'plot', 'witchdoctor', 'Julian', 'family', 'lawyer', 'Trench', 'Trench', 'mind', 'own', 'however', 'confusion', 'forgets', 'Edward', 'pretending', 'be', 'dead', 'oblong', 'box', 'up', 'being', 'buried', 'alive.That', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'film', 'right', 'there', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'character', 'creepy', 'doctor', 'who', 'experiment', 'cadavers', 'warmer', 'better', 'Dr.', 'Newhartt', 'Edward', 'remains', 'remains', 'reach', 'up', 'attempt', 'choke', 'good', 'doctor', 'blackmail', 'cooperation.The', 'overall', 'story', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'few', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewer', 'entertained', 'prostitutes', 'bar', 'barfights', 'murders', 'Edward', 'blood', 'so', 'fake', 'slashing', 'throats', 'very', 'unrealistic', '.Four', 'stars', 'are', 'mainly', 'sympathetic', 'Julian', 'murderous', 'Edward', 'played', 'callously', 'British', 'actor', 'Alister', 'Williamson', 'Edward', 'sexy', 'maid', 'girlfriend', 'Sally', 'Sally', 'Geeson', 'was', 'bit', 'flighty', 'weird', 'cute', 'horror', 'sort', 'way', 'Hilary', 'Dwyer', 'Witchfinder', 'General', 'Conqueror', 'Worm', 'Matthew', 'Hopkins', 'andCry', 'Banshee', '/', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morguealso', 'Price', 'overemotional', 'fiancee', 'Julian.Recommend', 'seeing', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'second', 'film', 'where', 'several', 'actors', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'return', 'encore.The', 'Oblong', 'Box', '/', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again']",Edgar Allan Poe's THE OBLONG BOX
