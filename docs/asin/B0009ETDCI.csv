904629,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0009ETDCI,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 4]","One of those Korean director Kim Ki-duk's mannerist-minimalist films in which his raw brutality outweighs his workmanship. Basically, the plot has the title's Bad Guy (a brutal street pimp, actually), that is attracted to a pretty college girl sitting on a bench in a park. But college girl is not attracted to Bad Guy, who, by the way, never talks in the whole movie. And college girl already has a boyfriend. So, through a complicated scheme, Bad Guy is able to have her work in his brothel. Poor college girl is now a prostitute. But Bad Guy continues to be infatuated with her, and sees her work through a one way mirror. And this infatuation will let college girl eventually get the upper hand and (sort of) get even. Not exactly bad, but neither one of Kim's better films, who has done better than this (see instead Spring, Summer, Autumn... or 3-Iron).",2,Bad guy not bad movie just indifferent one,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,859,"['One', 'Korean', 'director', 'Kim', 'Ki-duk', 'mannerist-minimalist', 'films', 'raw', 'brutality', 'workmanship', 'Basically', 'plot', 'title', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'brutal', 'street', 'pimp', 'actually', 'attracted', 'pretty', 'college', 'girl', 'sitting', 'bench', 'park', 'college', 'girl', 'not', 'attracted', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'who', 'way', 'never', 'talks', 'whole', 'movie', 'college', 'girl', 'already', 'boyfriend', 'So', 'complicated', 'scheme', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'able', 'have', 'work', 'brothel', 'Poor', 'college', 'girl', 'now', 'prostitute', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'be', 'infatuated', 'work', 'one', 'way', 'mirror', 'infatuation', 'will', 'let', 'college', 'girl', 'eventually', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'sort', 'get', 'even', 'Not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'one', 'Kim', 'better', 'films', 'who', 'done', 'better', 'see', 'instead', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', '3-Iron']",Bad Guy

A voyeuristic excursion into the darkest unconscionable pit of jagged human emotion.  It's quite a difficult film to consider, I'm still trying to get a grasp on the scope of this dark vision.  Unsettling.It is so hard to watch innocence get stripped in this fashion.  A beautiful college girl gets manipulated into a life of prostituion.  The sex scenes are just horribly painful, you are forced to witness this ultimately disturbing experience.  I couldn't help but feel violated as well.Her pimp watches her from behind the two-way mirror.  His obsession becomes more and more intense.  Man, I hated this guy.  The worst part was his silence.  He had long, penetrating stares that really just get under your skin.This is not a fun movie.  Effective in puncturing your mind and affecting you in a perverse, relentless fashion.

904631,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0009ETDCI,Dennis Littrell,"[9, 13]","This is what might be called postmodern naturalism.  Director Ki-duk Kim tells a brutal story without comment and without mercy.  He reminds us of some human truths that will make some viewers uncomfortable, and he invites controversy.First, two things: Spoilers to come, so if you haven't seen this movie you might want to stop reading now.Second, if you've seen the movie only once and are scratching your head, you're not alone.Here's what happens: Han-ki (Jae-hyeon Jo), a street tough pimp walking along in a South Korean city spies this very pretty and privileged college girl, Sun-hwa (Won Seo), sitting on a bench waiting for her boyfriend.  The girl is everything Han-ki desires.  He sits down next to her.  She pretends not to notice him while she talks on her cell phone to her boyfriend.  When she does deign to notice him (and his desire for her) she shirks back in horror at his dirty, lower-class presumption and gets up.  Her boyfriend arrives while she throws ugly glances at Han-ki. Han-ki can't take it anymore and grabs her and forcefully kisses her as the boyfriend beats him about the head.  Some soldiers arrive on the scene and beat the tar out of Han-ki.  As a parting gesture, pretty girl spits on Han-ki as he is held by the soldiers.That's ""the setup.""  It's the kind of setup that cries out for revenge or at least a comeuppance, which is what I expected.  Or perhaps pretty college girl and the bad guy will find true love and overcome their social differences.  What actually happens is beyond expectation in a way that is likely to stun and totally engage the viewer.Pretty girl is at a book store.  She compromises herself (in the viewer's eyes) by tearing a page out of an art book and putting it in her purse.  This can be seen as the fatal moral flaw that leads to her degeneration.  Han-ki sees this.  (He has been following her.)  He is playing out a trap.  Near her on the book display is a fat wallet. Pretty college girl grabs it, looks both ways, and puts it in her purse.  This is the fatal moral flaw leading to entrapment and a descent into hell.  She hurries to the bathroom and in the stall opens the wallet and takes out the money.  Meanwhile the guy who lost the wallet is told (presumably by the bad guy) that she has the wallet and is in the bathroom.  By the time he gets there she is gone.  He chases after her and finally catches her.  He roughs her up, calls her a pickpocket, and then forces her to go to a loan shark and sign an agreement (with her body as collateral) for money that he says was in the wallet.This might be called ""the turn"" as the setup takes on a startling twist.Next Sun-hwa is forced into prostitution by Han-ki  She makes some feeble attempts to get away, but mysteriously has nowhere to go it seems, and anyway is too afraid to run.  She realizes that she is going to lose her 21-year-old virginity so she begs her captors to let her lose it to her boyfriend.  Han-ki and his fellow thugs mysteriously oblige.  However, the boyfriend is confused and doesn't get the job done.  They pull him out of the car, slap him around, dump him, and Sun-hwa is back at the showcase on the street. Through a two-way mirror Han-ki watches her lose her virginity to a forceful client.Question number one: why doesn't Han-ki ever speak?  Question number two: why does he watch her behind the two-way mirror instead of taking her himself?The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time.  His voice is a high shriek.  Guess what his unique problem is.And then comes the resolution.  Yes, this is a love story of sorts and yes they do fall in love in a way that is debased and seemingly fated.  He's a pimp and she's now a prostitute.  This works out since he is able to vicariously experience her sexually and she is able to thereby serve the man she loves.  And together they can make a living.There is also a supernatural element in the film that suggests that the story is part wish-fulfillment fantasy by Han-ki.  His ability to beat up the other guys and survive knife wounds fairly begs credulity.  During the course of the film he loses enough blood to supply a small hospital.  And the scene where both he and Sun-hwa appear together on the beach as if by magic is more mystical than realistic.This is a haunting film done without any looking back or any compromise with the sensibilities of viewers.  Director Ki-duk Kim's message seems to be that animal passion will win out in the end, and that humans are, despite the facades they put on, just animals doing animal-like things in the human jungle, and deliverance comes only when one realizes his or her nature and gives into it.  Ki-duk Kim makes us identify with the bad guy and feel that he and pretty girl are no worse or no better than anyone else.In short I found this movie disturbing like something from, say, novelist Cormac McCarthy.  I am thinking especially of his novel, ""Child of God.""  That title is ironic in the sense that his anti-heroic protagonist really is, whatever we may say or think, or however bestial his behavior, a child of God, while Ki-duk Kim's title ""Bad Guy"" (""Nabbeun namja"") is also ironic in the sense that Han-ki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy, but by naturalistic (or cosmic) standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.Bottom line: see this excellent and deeply troubling film at your own risk.",4,Disturbing and then some,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,5418,"['what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'postmodern',

904632,A36NUDST4Y5JBA,B0009ETDCI,"D. S. HARDEN ""a movie fan""","[7, 11]","First, I must complement the other reviews, they are very descriptive and accurate in covering the movie.  The only points I have to add are the following:1. Didn't anyone notice the scar on his neck?  At some point in his life, he had his throat slashed, which explained why he stayed ""silent"" through most of the film.  He let his actions speak (violently) for him (very, very violently).  (The man almost seemed to enjoy pain & suffering - see the movie - and you'll see what I mean)2. He wasn't impotent by any stretch.  He wasn't enjoying himself - it was more like he was just performing a function.  He didn't have sex with his victim at anytime - he 'experienced' it by watching in the mirror.  Voyeur? Maybe!3. He did love her?  No, I believe he loved the 'idea' of the girl.  Anyone notice the photograph of him and the 'former' girlfriend?  (If anyone noticed, it was suggested that she terminated her own existence - perhaps by walking into the ocean).  Our 'victim' in this case just happened to look very similiar to the former girlfriend - which is why he 'freaked out' when he saw her, and had to kiss her in the park.4. She did love him?  No, I believe that when she figured out what he had done to her and what the two of them had went through, she found something/someone in which to ""bond"" herself.  She found that she just couldn't ""let go.""5. The man set her free.  Took her back to the park and set her free.  All she had to do was take herself home and reclaim her former life.  But she didn't.  It was as if she had taken stock of her situation and concluded (in my view) the following:5a. If I walk through my front door, what kind of future will I have?5b. Will I be forgiven?5c. Will my friends welcome me back?5d. What will my prospects be after college? (assuming that she  went back to complete her studies).  An assumption - everyone probably knew where she ended up (thank the boyfriend for that).6. I concluded that SHE concluded that her future would not be bright.  Let's pretend she (and everyone) puts what happened to her behind them.  How does she end up?  Probably married and stuck as a housewife - being compelled to 'serve' her husband (among other things).  Powerless.7. She returned.  Notice that she learned that by selling herself, she had ultimate control over her body (and men), and could use it to get what she needed/wanted.  Therefore, she returned to the one person who introduced her to the 'lifestyle.'  Please note the signifigance of the 'red dress' in the scene where she finds him on the beach - it was if she was willing to 'play the role' of the former girlfriend - thus pleasing him.  We see that they held hands (maybe twice) in the movie.  Remember, they were totally willing to keep their roles in the relationship:  He was her pimp, she was his prostitute.  There was no in-between with the two of them.  But still, they loved each other????8. This was one of the more ""far out"" movies that I've every seen.  It's hyper-violent and it's view of the treatment of women honest.  Folks, it's a dark world out there.  If you have daughters, take note - this movie is not so far-fetched as not to be believable.  Beings become attracted to each other in the strangest ways.  Does it make sense?  Of course not!  But after all, we are all only ""human.""  And after all, that makes anything and everything possible.9.

904635,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0009ETDCI,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 8]","I became curious for more films by Ki-duk-Kim, who has a reputation for delivering movies that are pretty edgy about relations between men and women. And this one is pretty edgy. Viewers are lured by a speech-impaired, low-class pimp Han-gi (Cho Je-Hyun) who after being attracted to middle-class college coed Sun-hwa (Seo Won) sitting on a park bench, violently kisses her in front of her boyfriend and then is beaten in public by a few soldiers and forced to apologize. After being spit on by Sun-hwa, the humiliated thug follows her and sets her up in a bookstore pickpocket scheme, where she's coerced into becoming a prostitute in a notorious Seoul red light district.This movie basically has two parts, the breakdown of Sun-Hwa and the reconstruction of Sun-Hwa. The first half of the movie moves along at a fairly good pace. The characters are interesting and the story unfolds nicely and is punctuated by sporadic moments of violence and unpleasant bouts of non-consensual sex. The second half of the movie is decidedly slower and a little less believable. It's hard to believe that Sun-Hwa would fall for Han-Ki even after he turns her into a prostitute and watches her from behind a two-way mirror. The film quality of this movie is your Asian fare. It's not as crisp as a Hollywood movie does it does have a little more grime to it.The acting in this film is fair. Je-Hyun Cho gives a quality performance as Han-Ki. Han-Ki is basically a mute throughout the movie, but Cho provides the character with dialogue through his physical performance and the intense looks that he provides. Half the fun of the movie for me was trying to figure out what Han-Ki is thinking from the behavior and looks that he gives. It's fun for some people, but annoying for others. Seo Won hands in a truly mind-boggling and emotional performance. Won does a talented job of showing the range of emotions that an ex-college student would go through when reduced to the level of prostitution. The scenes with her first cleint are truly disturbing and will have you squirming in your seat, unless you like that sort of thing. I was amazed at the ability of the filmmakers and actors to actually create a sense of sympathy and even a feeling of warmness for the prostitutes and the pimps, especially for Han-Ki. Despite the fact that Han-Ki basically enslaved Sun-Hwa, I still found myself kind of liking the guy.

904636,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B0009ETDCI,Kerry Walters,"[2, 2]","Ki-duk Kim's ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Fall...and Spring"" (2003) was one of the most beautiful and sensitive films I've ever seen.  That's why I was so shocked when I saw his earlier ""Bad Guy.""*  The latter is probably the single-most disturbing film I've ever seen.How could one director stretch far enough to make both?  What's the connection between them?In her earlier review of ""Bad Guy,"" Kim Anehall masterfully summarizes its plot.  What I'd like to do is suggest a common denominator between the two films (and, indeed, I think it's probably one of the threads that runs through all of Ki-duk Kim's work):  inner darkness.  Kim seems to believe that all humans are wounded--he frequently symbolizes our psychic woundedness with physical scars (the ear-to-ear scar on Han-ki's throat, for example, that inhibits him from speaking)--and that the trauma of those wounds isolate us from one another in destructive ways.  No one is immune from this wounding.  Even innocent Sun-hwa shows a darker side when she vandalizes an art book and, even more obviously, when she tries to steal a wallet.  Perhaps what ultimately distinguishes a figure like Sun-hwa and one like Han-ki is degree, not kind.In ""Spring...,"" Kim suggests that there's hope for our woundedness.  The returning disciple, after years of prison purgation, returns to his old master's monastery and continues the natural cycle.  He recognizes and embraces his interconnectedness with everything, and thereby overcomes the alienation caused by his wounds.  But in ""Bad Guy,"" there's no sense of salvation.  By film's end, Sun-hwa and Han-ki have entered into a frozen intimacy (if ""intimacy"" it can be called), one in which they come across more as two animals huddling next to one another for warmth than anything else.  It's a sad, disturbing ending.""Bad Guy"" isn't the exquisite and seamless film that ""Spring..."" is.  It has at least two false endings--although the actual ending is masterful--the two beach/photograph scenes are surreally out of place, and I'm not sure that the prison sequence adds anything to the narrative (although Han-ki's steely cigarette smoking as Sun-hwa screams at him is gripping).  But the acting is solid (and Jae-hyeon Jo's nearly silent performance superb), and the cinematography, especially the scenes in which Han-ki spies on Sun-hwa through the double mirror, are exceptionally good.__________* ""Bad Guy"" was actually released in Korea two years before ""Spring...,"" and only released in the U.S. after ""Spring..."" brought Kim to the attention of the West.",4,Inner darkness and salvation (or not),1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,2561,"['Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Fall', 'Spring', '2003', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'when', 'saw', 'earlier', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'latter', 'probably', 'single-most', 'disturbing', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.How', 'could', 'one', 'director', 'stretch', 'far', 'enough', 'make', 'What', 'connection', 'earlier', 'review', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Kim', 'Anehall', 'masterfully', 'plot', 'What', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'suggest', 'common', 'denominator', 'two', 'films', 'indeed', 'think', 'probably', 'one', 'threads', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'work', 'inner', 'darkness', 'Kim', 'believe', 'humans', 'are', 'wounded', 'frequently', 'psychic', 'woundedness', 'physical', 'scars', 'ear-to-ear', 'scar', 'Han-ki', 'throat', 'example', 'speaking', 'trauma', 'wounds', 'isolate', 'one', 'destructive', 'ways', 'one', 'immune', 'wounding', 'Even', 'innocent', 'Sun-hwa', 'darker', 'side', 'when', 'art', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'obviously', 'when', 'steal', 'wallet', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'ultimately', 'figure', 'Sun-hwa', 'one', 'Han-ki', 'degree', 'not', 'kind.In', 'Spring', 'Kim', 'hope', 'woundedness', 'returning', 'disciple', 'years', 'prison', 'purgation', 'returns', 'old', 'master', 'monastery', 'natural', 'cycle', 'interconnectedness', 'everything', 'thereby', 'alienation', 'caused', 'wounds', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'sense', 'salvation', 'film', 'end', 'Sun-hwa', 'Han-ki', 'have', 'entered', 'frozen', 'intimacy', 'intimacy', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'one', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'two', 'animals', 'huddling', 'next', 'one', 'warmth', 'anything', 'else', 'sad', 'disturbing', 'ending', 'Bad', 'Guy', ""n't"", 'exquisite', 'seamless', 'film', 'Spring', 'least', 'two', 'false', 'endings', 'actual', 'ending', 'masterful', 'two', 'beach/photograph', 'scenes', 'are', 'surreally', 'place', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'prison', 'sequence', 'anything', 'narrative', 'Han-ki', 'steely', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'Sun-hwa', 'screams', 'gripping', 'acting', 'solid', 'Jae-hyeon', 'Jo', 'nearly', 'silent', 'performance', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Han-ki', 'spies', 'Sun-hwa', 'double', 'mirror', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good.__________*', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'Korea', 'two', 'years', 'Spring', 'only', 'released', 'U.S.', 'Spring', 'brought', 'Kim', 'attention', 'West']",Bad Guy
904637,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0009ETDCI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 21]","Having just seen the Korean film ""Bad Guy,"" I am extremely impressed with its brutality.  While that may seem like an odd comment, it has been quite a while since I've come across a film that really connected with its character's psychological dark sides.  ""Bad Guy"" doesn't apologize or compromise in the choices (good, bad, violent, surprising) of its two leads, and in that--stands as a very honest, if unpleasant character study.  I know many people will dismiss the film out of hand based on subject matter--that's fine, it's not for everyone.  Other will question character motivations, which I think are brilliantly conceived.  They are not, however, what we might expect or want.  And I think detractors from the film are disturbed by the lead character's ultimate acceptance of her position (and make no mistake, it is disturbing), but from a psychological standpoint--it makes perfect sense, to me.""Bad Guy"" starts out with a powerful and violent street encounter.  Han-ki, a street hardened pimp, becomes infatuated with an attractive young girl he spies on a park bench.  Sitting next to her, he continues to watch her as her boyfriend arrives.  Before leaving, as they have noticed and commented on his presence, he grabs her and gives her an extended (and rough) kiss--which leads to a confrontation with several passersby.  But Han-ki can't get Sun-hwa, the college girl, out of his mind and starts to follow her.  He eventually sets her up in a sting where she steals some money--and uses the leverage to force her into a world of prostitution to pay off the debt.  As she learns the ways of her new world, many of these scenes are harrowing and graphic.There is a lot that transpires as the film progresses--but the crux of the story continues to be this primary relationship.  Han-ki, who is wordless and brooding, uses violence to speak for him.  He is obsessed with Sun-hwa and secretly watches her debasement (sometimes protecting her, but ultimately letting her sink fully into this new life).  Sun-hwa, whose attempts to escape have been unsuccessful, starts to accept her position--she has no alternatives.  The Han-ki/Sun-hwa relationship is the film's strongest component--it is morally ambiguous, challenging, and hard to understand.  But the man who has enslaved her is also the one that shows her kindness, protects her, never makes advances on her.  In a bravura bit of acting, these two leads plumb psychological depths that few films would dare to embrace.The film is not a perfect one, there is some added drama when an old boss is released from prison--and this adds some more conventionally violent showdowns.  And the conclusion is very ambiguous, it is open to various interpretations.  I've discussed this film with numerous friends and we have about 4 different views on the film's end--two of which are quite legitimate.  I only warn you of the ambiguous ending because if that's going to deter you from seeing the film, you should know up front.  But ultimately, ""Bad Guy"" has lingered in my mind.  It's a powerful psychological study of an unpleasant topic and an unconventional relationship.  Not for everyone, by any stretch, but if you like to be challenged--this might be up your alley.

904638,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009ETDCI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[47, 58]","Ki-duk Kim delivers an inquisitive blow to the audience with his film titled Bad Guy.  Here he intends to make the audience question whether humans can get along despite differences in class, education, appearance, and other social standards that the society creates.  On the surface these differences might not be what the viewer discovers, but in retrospect, or maybe even during the film, the notion of harmony among human differences might emerge in consciousness.  Nonetheless, Ki-duk Kim paints a cinematic tapestry of brutality and hatred that strikes deep into the soul and core of humanity.Bad Guy is not unlike Ki-duk Kim's other films in regards to the symbolism and the artistic expression that this South Korean director strives to visualize on the silver screen.  Yet, the situation is new and the story is unique even though he returned to teenage prostitution in Samaria (2004), the English title Samaria Girl.  The depicted cruelty often finds its place in Ki-duk Kim's films, may be even a reason for his popularity.  However, it is in the moment of viciousness where he generates the artistic moment that crosses between what is acceptable and unacceptable.  These are moments where opposite sides cross into each other's sphere like a bridge built for a moment that is destroyed in the next instant.  The violence can be seen in films such as the Isle (2000) where a woman pulls up a man by a fish hook and the dog killings in Address Unknown (2001).  It is in these violent moments where Ki-duk Kim reaches the furthest while trying to communicate his message to the audience.Cleverly, Ki-duk Kim opens Bad Guy with a scene of a city street where hundreds of of people are wandering during business hour.  People are shown from all walks of life, ugly and pretty, rich and poor, and among them emerges the silent anti-hero of the story Han-gi (Jae-hyeon Jo) who discovers Sun-hwa (Won Seo).  They are from opposite social classes.  Han-gi comes from the lower class while Sun-hwa is a member of the upper class.  Han-gi is a quiet, perhaps of his servitude class, pimp from the part of the town nobody admits they are from, or want to visit unless it is for carnal pleasure. Sun-hwa is the pretty college girl most men would turn their head to look at twice who is both refined and educated.When Han-gi's eyes lands on Sun-hwa for the first time he cannot take them of her, as she sits on a park bench.  He stands there dumbfounded almost drooling all over himself while observing her from a distance.  Awkwardly, he approaches her and is unable to speak he sits down next to her.  Sun-hwa steps away seemingly threatened by his stare and presence, and possibly his looks.  After all he has a thick and long scar running horizontally over his throat.  When her boyfriend arrives Han-gi continues to stare at her.  All of a sudden Han-gi walks up and kisses her right in front of the boyfriend who helplessly tries to remove him.  Consequently, the situation escalates when Sun-hwa demands an apology for Han-gi's transgression, which ends with him getting a severe beating from a large number of bystanders.Like a ghost Han-gi returns to his home in the poor community where girls sell themselves for a few meager bucks while bribing off nosy police officers with their only assets.  Angry and vindictive Han-gi intends to repay the mistreatment in a Machiavellian style where he concocts a trap where Sun-hwa gets into big debt.  Unable to pay off the debt she ends up becoming a slave-like prostitute where she must pay with her body and face.  Silently, Han-gi continues to watch her through a one-way mirror while she begins and continues her new life as a prostitute.  This of course has strong symbolic value in regards to the transparency of the lower class's view of the upper class while the narcissism of the rich blinds them from seeing the poor.Ki-duk Kim's presentation of the theme is a very uncomfortable cinematic experience, yet he succeeds through this tragedy to make people think about the differences between Han-gi and Sun-hwa.  In addition, to strengthen his message he experiments with distance between the characters through both tangible and intangible symbols throughout the whole film.  In essence, the story turns into a macabre education of class struggle and differences between people where Ki-duk Kim does not hold back in his social criticism.  The film is both bizarre and surreal while also humane underneath all the ugliness, as Ki-duk Kim displays his brilliant ability to create visual fabrications from his personal artistic vision that will continue to mesmerize many for a long time.",5,A Brutal Cinematic Tapestry Where Borders Dissolve...,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,4646,"['Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'inquisitive', 'blow', 'audience', 'film', 'titled', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Here', 'make', 'audience', 'question', 'humans', 'can', 'get', 'differences', 'class', 'education', 'appearance', 'other', 'social', 'standards', 'society', 'surface', 'differences', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'viewer', 'discovers', 'retrospect', 'maybe', 'even', 'film', 'notion', 'harmony', 'human', 'differences', 'might', 'emerge', 'consciousness', 'Nonetheless', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'cinematic', 'tapestry', 'brutality', 'hatred', 'strikes', 'deep', 'soul', 'core', 'humanity.Bad', 'Guy', 'not', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'other', 'films', 'regards', 'symbolism', 'artistic', 'expression', 'South', 'Korean', 'director', 'strives', 'visualize', 'silver', 'screen', 'situation', 'new', 'story', 'unique', 'even', 'returned', 'teenage', 'prostitution', 'Samaria', '2004', 'English', 'title', 'Samaria', 'Girl', 'depicted', 'cruelty', 'often', 'place', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'reason', 'popularity', 'However', 'moment', 'viciousness', 'where', 'artistic', 'moment', 'what', 'acceptable', 'unacceptable', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'opposite', 'sides', 'cross', 'other', 'sphere', 'bridge', 'built', 'moment', 'destroyed', 'next', 'instant', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'films', 'such', 'Isle', '2000', 'where', 'woman', 'up', 'man', 'fish', 'hook', 'dog', 'killings', 'Address', 'Unknown', '2001', 'violent', 'moments', 'where', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'furthest', 'trying', 'communicate', 'message', 'audience.Cleverly', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'scene', 'city', 'street', 'where', 'hundreds', 'people', 'are', 'wandering', 'business', 'hour', 'People', 'are', 'shown', 'walks', 'life', 'ugly', 'pretty', 'rich', 'poor', 'silent', 'anti-hero', 'story', 'Han-gi', 'Jae-hyeon', 'Jo', 'who', 'Sun-hwa', 'Won', 'Seo', 'are', 'opposite', 'social', 'classes', 'Han-gi', 'lower', 'class', 'Sun-hwa', 'member', 'upper', 'class', 'Han-gi', 'quiet', 'perhaps', 'servitude', 'class', 'pimp', 'part', 'town', 'nobody', 'are', 'want', 'visit', 'carnal', 'pleasure', 'Sun-hwa', 'pretty', 'college', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'turn', 'head', 'look', 'twice', 'who', 'refined', 'educated.When', 'Han-gi', 'eyes', 'Sun-hwa', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'park', 'bench', 'there', 'dumbfounded', 'almost', 'drooling', 'observing', 'distance', 'Awkwardly', 'unable', 'speak', 'down', 'next', 'Sun-hwa', 'steps', 'away', 'seemingly', 'threatened', 'stare', 'presence', 'possibly', 'looks', 'thick', 'long', 'scar', 'running', 'horizontally', 'throat', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'Han-gi', 'stare', 'sudden', 'Han-gi', 'walks', 'up', 'right', 'front', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'helplessly', 'remove', 'Consequently', 'situation', 'when', 'Sun-hwa', 'apology', 'Han-gi', 'transgression', 'getting', 'severe', 'beating', 'large', 'number', 'ghost', 'Han-gi', 'returns', 'home', 'poor', 'community', 'where', 'girls', 'sell', 'few', 'meager', 'bucks', 'bribing', 'off', 'nosy', 'police', 'officers', 'only', 'assets', 'Angry', 'vindictive', 'Han-gi', 'repay', 'mistreatment', 'Machiavellian', 'style', 'where', 'trap', 'where', 'Sun-hwa', 'big', 'debt', 'Unable', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'up', 'becoming', 'slave-like', 'prostitute', 'where', 'must', 'pay', 'body', 'face', 'Silently', 'Han-gi', 'watch', 'one-way', 'mirror', 'new', 'life', 'prostitute', 'course', 'strong', 'symbolic', 'value', 'regards', 'transparency', 'lower', 'class', 'view', 'upper', 'class', 'narcissism', 'rich', 'seeing', 'poor.Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'presentation', 'theme', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'yet', 'tragedy', 'make', 'people', 'think', 'differences', 'Han-gi', 'Sun-hwa', 'addition', 'strengthen', 'message', 'distance', 'characters', 'tangible', 'intangible', 'symbols', 'whole', 'film', 'essence', 'story', 'macabre', 'education', 'class', 'struggle', 'differences', 'people', 'where', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'social', 'criticism', 'film', 'bizarre', 'surreal', 'while', 'also', 'ugliness', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'brilliant', 'ability', 'create', 'visual', 'fabrications', 'personal', 'artistic', 'vision', 'will', 'continue', 'mesmerize', 'many', 'long', 'time']",Bad Guy

It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure.Sun-hwa (The Isle's Won Seo) is a college student. Han-ki (Interview's Jae-hyeon Jo) is the bad guy of the title, a small-time thug. There's a chance meeting at a bus stop which culminates in Han-ki forcing Sun-hwa to kiss him. This leads to Han-ki getting himself beaten not only by Sun-hwa's boyfriend, but some passing soldiers. As revenge, Han-ki and his small band of thugs ruin Sun-hwa, pushing her into a life of prostitution; Han-ki monitors her progress through a two-way mirror installed in her room. Slowly, as time goes on, an odd bond is formed between the two of them.WARNING: here be spoilers. If you don't want the emotional overtones of the movie spoiled for you, stop reading here. It's a three-star movie, that's all you need to know. Capische?It should be obvious from that synopsis that this is a movie that is bound to make some folks uncomfortable. That said, if all you're getting out of the movie is that this is a movie roughly akin to genre novels where the antihero rapes the damsel in distress, after which they fall in love, you may not be looking closely enough at what happens between these two characters. To say that Sun-hwa falls in love with Han-ki is vastly oversimplifying the case, I think; I'm not sure that love ever enters into the picture. Sun-hwa feels dependent on Han-ki, to be sure, and he feels protective of her, but at no time does she ever stop hating him, nor does he ever stop feeling some form of contempt for her (probably based on the difference in their class). This is a love story in the same way Se7en is a buddy-cop movie; the main relationship in the film is so highly dysfunctional, and yet so complex, that any facile analysis of the relationship between the two main characters is bound to be oversimplified.  And, from what I've read over the past few days, there's a lot of that goin' round. That's depressing, because the relationship between Han-ki and Sun-hwa is the movie; if you don't grasp the complexity of what's going on between them, you're bound to hate this. But if you don't immediately tune out the relationship factor, you'll find there's a lot going on underneath the hood here. Yeah, some of it's contrived, and some goes way beyond the bounds of realism (but then that's a Ki-duk Kim specialty; reality is only a springboard for a journey into a very weird place. Cf. The Isle, naturally). But that doesn't make it any less fun to watch. ***",3,"Interesting, if uncomfortable.",1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2840,"['Bad', 'Guy', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', '2001', 'Kim', 'followed', 'up', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'was', 'Isle', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'murkier', 'flick', 'impossible', 'classify', 'easy', 'box', 'got', 'elements', 'Yakuza', 'flick', 'disease-of-the-week', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'weepie', 'Dogme', 'host', 'other', 'movements', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one', 'very', 'messy', 'little', 'package', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'sure.Sun-hwa', 'Isle', 'Won', 'Seo', 'college', 'student', 'Han-ki', 'Interview', 'Jae-hyeon', 'Jo', 'bad', 'guy', 'title', 'small-time', 'thug', 'chance', 'meeting', 'bus', 'stop', 'Han-ki', 'forcing', 'Sun-hwa', 'kiss', 'Han-ki', 'getting', 'not', 'only', 'Sun-hwa', 'boyfriend', 'passing', 'soldiers', 'revenge', 'Han-ki', 'small', 'band', 'thugs', 'ruin', 'Sun-hwa', 'pushing', 'life', 'prostitution', 'Han-ki', 'monitors', 'progress', 'two-way', 'mirror', 'installed', 'room', 'Slowly', 'time', 'odd', 'bond', 'formed', 'two', 'them.WARNING', 'here', 'be', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'emotional', 'overtones', 'movie', 'spoiled', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'three-star', 'movie', 'need', 'know', 'Capische', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'bound', 'make', 'folks', 'uncomfortable', 'said', ""'re"", 'getting', 'movie', 'movie', 'roughly', 'akin', 'genre', 'novels', 'where', 'antihero', 'damsel', 'distress', 'fall', 'love', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'looking', 'closely', 'enough', 'what', 'two', 'characters', 'say', 'Sun-hwa', 'love', 'Han-ki', 'vastly', 'oversimplifying', 'case', 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'love', 'ever', 'enters', 'picture', 'Sun-hwa', 'feels', 'dependent', 'Han-ki', 'be', 'sure', 'protective', 'time', 'ever', 'stop', 'hating', 'ever', 'stop', 'feeling', 'form', 'contempt', 'probably', 'based', 'difference', 'class', 'love', 'story', 'same', 'way', 'Se7en', 'buddy-cop', 'movie', 'main', 'relationship', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'yet', 'so', 'complex', 'facile', 'analysis', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'bound', 'be', 'oversimplified', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'past', 'few', 'days', 'lot', 'goin', 'round', 'depressing', 'relationship', 'Han-ki', 'Sun-hwa', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'complexity', 'what', 'going', ""'re"", 'bound', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'tune', 'out', 'relationship', 'factor', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'going', 'hood', 'here', 'Yeah', 'contrived', 'way', 'bounds', 'realism', 'then', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'specialty', 'reality', 'only', 'springboard', 'journey', 'very', 'weird', 'place', 'Cf', 'Isle', 'naturally', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'fun', 'watch', '***']",Bad Guy
904642,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0009ETDCI,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 3]","I'm a fan of Kim Ki-Duk's work, granted he has a somewhat of an ""outcast"" director image in South Korea but his films never fail to engage me or even ""warp"" me into another marginalized world. It's small wonder that Kim's works enjoy more success abroad than in his native land. The magic of his film-making is that he takes the viewer to understand how certain worlds operate and how his characters set their rules that apply to that world. ""BAD GUY"" is a different approach to his film-making. The imagery in this film is somewhat disturbing to some viewers; I'm certain that some may feel insulted by the proceedings but I assure you, this film will not fail in engaging the viewer.Sunhwa is a young college student sitting on a bench while she waits for her boyfriend. Han-Gi is a misfit who notices the young lady in fascination. Upon her boyfriend's arrival, Han-Gi grabs Sunhwa and forcefully kisses her on the lips. Her boyfriend tries to pry her from his arms unsuccessfully until the police arrive. She angrily slaps him and spits on his face when the cops finally pry her from Han-Gi's arms. Soon after, Han-Gi (Cho Jae-Hyun) stalks Sunhwa and her boyfriend until he manages to entrap her into a situation that she is heavily in debt and needs to sell her body to pay it back.BAD GUY is pure challenging cinema and may present a degrading view of how some women are treated on-screen. I didn't particularly like the idea of how Sunhwa (Seo Won) was being treated in its proceedings. But I have to admit, there is a lot of honesty in its portrayal of the red light district in any part of the world. Some people may criticize the idea why Sunhwa would allow such a thing to happen to her but then again, this type of thing does happen. (Thankfully it just doesn't happen to anyone I know) BAD GUY explores the issue of prostitution and why some women are stuck in this profession. It is a study of obsession, social class, voyeurism and violent behavior; these are the themes one needs to focus on when watching this film otherwise, the viewer may get lost in the proceedings and think that the film is a sleazy sex movie.Bad Guy is also an odd and twisted love story. I thought Han-Gi's entrapment of Sunhwa was his reaction to the hopelessness of his social level; he thinks that he would never be able to attain a woman of Sunhwa's status. In his twisted way, he felt as if to be able to have a chance of her falling for him, he has to lower her social status. I know it's sickening; which is why ""Bad Guy"" is twisted and quite frankly disturbing. While the film's main focus is Han-Gi; a disturbed pimp, at times it is cerebrally engaging but I thought it is a sick and a sinister tease.The central character of the film is Han-Gi. The events and Sunhwa's fate unfold with his scheming and manipulations. Like most of Kim's characters; he hardly says a word. This move is very effective as it makes all the characters in the film uncomfortable around him as well as the viewer. The audience has to watch a film with a very unlikeable character who is committing all these obscene acts as the main focus for the most of the film's proceedings. Han-Gi is a character bereft in irony and contradictions; he beats up Sunhwa's clients when they become too abusive, he watches her behind a one-sided mirror while she haves sex, he protects her from other pimps but he's the one who reduced her to a street hooker. It almost as if Kim Ki-Duk is challenging the viewer to see what is happening to Sunhwa and what the viewer thinks about it. All the terrible things that can break a woman happens to Sunhwa, which is just terrible. The film also shows a very unnerving study of her character as she begins to adapt to her terrible situation.BAD GUY is definitely surreal and challenging. It is not very nice but darned if it wasn't engaging either. The film is visually stunning; it is full of irony and desperation. The red light district is definitely presented as a colorful but dry love-less area. Kim's camera angling also represents voyeurism as a subtle detail; he keeps the wide frame from a distance and always give the viewer a feeling that he is watching through a fence or over any object. The film also symbolizes a reversal in Han-Gi and Sunhwa's situation whenever he watches her through a one-way mirror. It's Han-Gi reversing their positions in his twisted mind.Despite its faults, some themes seem a bit over-zealous and the very nasty disturbing images of violence and rape, Bad Guy is engaging cinema. I rather found the experience to be a bit unnerving but I do appreciate themes of darker nature. The third act of the film may puzzle some viewers as to why; but if you were paying attention for the film's entirety, you won't even wonder. Always keep in mind, Kim focuses on the how his audience will interpret his views. Most of the time, he shows uncompromising honesty in his message that last after the end credits.RECOMMENDED!
