As such, it is far better than most of the junk on television! The story is interesting, the characters are fleshed out well, and the monster is incredibly realistic (thanks to Stan Winston) and menacing! Craig T. Nelson (POLTERGEIST) and Kim Cattrall (!!) are great as the scientists out to solve a series of mysterious deaths.

This is an overly long film at almost 3 hours but I still love it, I mean it has it all, secret military research base, man-shark hybrid, sexy Kim Cattrall... Craig T. Nelson. Peter Benchley had great success with Jaws and this book came after the also popular "" The Beast "" and it is probably the weakest movie adaption out of the three, having said that I am still glad to own it finally as it is very entertaining. It is a little to preachy in the beginnig with the "" save the great white shark"" bit, and some of the early cheap military set ups don't look convincing ( The navy uniforms look thrown together from a thift shop) but the few good glimpses we see of the shark are very good, so although it has flaws it's worth a look, and if your like it check out Jeffery Combs in "" Hammerhead "" for a double feature.",4,Man in Rubber Shark suit!!!!

Nelson is a rather sanctimonious nature guy doing some sort of shark research on an abandoned military base out on an island.  His (ex?) wife Kim Cattrall comes to visit with their kid.  Local fishermen start having trouble with sharks and Nelson sanctimoniously criticizes them, blah blah blah.  There's a long dull subplot with the kid and his new-found friends on the island as they have occasional run-ins with the shark creature.  This eats up about a third of the movie.  There's also a mysterious guy who seems to be the local insane bum, but maybe he's got a secret?Anyhow, lots of family crap, lots of nature guy sanctimony, marginally involving plot overall.  It would probably be far more enjoyable without the 75 minutes of commercials that the Sci-Fi Channel plays every time they broadcast it.  Creature is typical low budget looking shark dude type thing.  Tho only reason I'd buy this is that Kim Cattrall looks incredibly sexy throughout most of the movie.

Of course, there are the experiments they want the Project Oversight Officer (Colm Feore) to see and one they do not.  That one (the BIG secret) escapes confinement, to be rescued by Lt. Thomas Peniston Werewolf (Giancarlo Esposito), who traps it in a cage that he then sinks into the ocean.Actual start number 3: the present day, whatever that is, but figuring it's 25 years later, that creature must be at least a geezer and yet it's not, it's fresh as a daisy and raring to go.Now comes the long part, as stories go, this one seems to go on forever.  The main character is Dr. Simon Chase (Craig T. Nelson), a single-minded researcher for a cure to cancer.  His excess baggage: an ex-wife, Dr. Amanda Macy (Kim Cattrall), and a son he rarely sees.  There's also the specter of a dead brother that spurs him onto finding a cure for cancer, no matter what the cost.  This makes him either heroic or incredible stupid.  What's the point in having a family if it's considered a distraction?  He is also a bit of a know-it-all and an insufferable crusader, not to mention a bit of a bully who always wants things his way.  The character is very easy to dislike.  Actually, there are a lot of characters designed that way: the spooky Admiral (Colm Feore), the local cop (Blu Makuma), the local poacher (Michael Reilly Burke), a nasty fisherman (John Aylward).  At times it's difficult getting past these irritants, to just take the story as it is.  When it's all about the CREATURE, it's fun and exciting.  When it's about sour people bitching and moaning, it turns into a bit of a drag.  One obstacle to combat would be reasonable, when they come at you from every quarter it feels contrived and manipulative.  If this was intended to make us feel sorry for the poor Chicken Little doctor, it failed miserably.  He fits right in with this group of malcontents, enough so to be their leader!  A more sympathetic actor might have made this work better.  Even so, the shark/creature is what makes this watchable.  That, and some of the sillier scenes, like the Spaghetti Western moment when they show close-ups of Craig T. Nelson's eyes then Sharky's eyes then his then Sharky....

The book White Shark is one of my all time favorite books...but I was largely upset by Sci fi Channel's so called movie version of White Shark. They hardly retained any of the material that was in the book...they kept the island...the main character and his son...and the over all basis of what the creature was..but every thing else from the book was thrown aside..like in the book it wasn't the main character's exwife that comes to the island with the seals..its an entirly different female character...in the book you never even meet his ex wife..she is only mintioned by Max while talking with his father. Also in the book it was the Nazi's who performed the experiments that led to the creation of the creature...NOT the US Navy. By changing that ..they cut out my favorite character from the book...even though he was only in the book for a short time..he was still an intersting character. Also Max meets the island girl in a totally different way in the book...also in the book her character is deaf....the only real reason I gave this 3 stars is because the film's creature was pretty awesome looking. Pretty much how I had pictured it while reading the book. I know that sometimes when a book gets made into a movie some things from the book get left out, altered or completely rewritten...but too me all the things from the book that was changed in the movie shouldn't have been changed. I can only hope that someday some one will deciede to give the book White Shark a true transformation into movie form. I'm not sure if I'd ever buy this movie...but I most likely would watch it or rent it...then again..I might not.",3,Peter Benchly's book was a heck of alot better...,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1774,"['Long', 'saw', 'movie..I', 'being', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Benchly', 'work', 'Read', 'book', 'White', 'Shark', 'what', 'movie', 'Creature', 'based', 'book', 'White', 'Shark', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'books', 'was', 'largely', 'upset', 'Sci', 'fi', 'Channel', 'so', 'called', 'movie', 'version', 'White', 'Shark', 'hardly', 'retained', 'material', 'was', 'book', 'kept', 'island', 'main', 'character', 'son', 'basis', 'what', 'creature', 'was..but', 'thing', 'else', 'book', 'was', 'thrown', 'aside..like', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'main', 'character', 'exwife', 'island', 'seals..its', 'entirly', 'different', 'female', 'character', 'book', 'never', 'even', 'meet', 'ex', 'wife..she', 'only', 'mintioned', 'Max', 'talking', 'father', 'Also', 'book', 'was', 'Nazi', 'who', 'performed', 'experiments', 'led', 'creation', 'creature', 'NOT', 'US', 'Navy', 'changing', '..they', 'cut', 'out', 'favorite', 'character', 'book', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'book', 'short', 'time..he', 'was', 'still', 'intersting', 'character', 'Also', 'Max', 'island', 'girl', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'book', 'also', 'book', 'character', 'deaf', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'creature', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'looking', 'Pretty', 'much', 'how', 'had', 'pictured', 'reading', 'book', 'know', 'sometimes', 'when', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'things', 'book', 'get', 'left', 'out', 'altered', 'completely', 'rewritten', 'too', 'things', 'book', 'was', 'changed', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'someday', 'one', 'will', 'deciede', 'give', 'book', 'White', 'Shark', 'true', 'transformation', 'movie', 'form', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'ever', 'buy', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'watch', 'rent', 'then', 'again..I', 'might', 'not']",Creature
1072244,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B000PMFRUQ,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","Answer: a thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi actioner with very good (and reasonable) special effects that has just a touch of heart but not too much sentimentality.  The film's singular flaw is that it is too long and that is only because it was a made-for-TV event movie that was aired over two nights (if I remember correctly).  Despite the film's length it is paced very well, has some decent and believable for the circumstances character development, makes light commentary on government and social issues (though it is not the film's real interest and it is not preachy by any means), and is all around well acted.  Did I mention the special effects.  This film hardly uses any CGI at all; almost all of the effects are practical and the Sharkmonster (ah, evolutionary ideas run amok! science, what will you do to us next?), both the animatronics and the man-in-suit, are expertly handled and detailed.  This film does not hide what sci-fi fans want to see in their monster movie!  We see a ton of the Sharkmonster frequently throughout the film (we perhaps see him jerkily turning his head a bit much but I won't complain).If you're a fan of shark movies then check this out.If you're a fan of sci-fi then check this out.If you're a fan of Peter Benchley (you know, that ""Jaws"" author?) then check this out.If you're a fan of Kim Cattrall then...go watch that Sex and the City stuff.If you watch this and you're a guy then you'll likely become a fan of the lovely Michael Michele (yes, she's a she with a he name, get over it).Eh, I'll go with my theme and end on this: if you're a fan of movies then check this out.  But, seriously, give yourself some time to watch it as it's almost three hours.",4,"Question: what do you get when you cross Craig T.

It's been a while since I have seen this movie. This is a Kim Cattrall movie that must have been shot just before she got her big break-through position of employment. This movie only offered part 1. I kind of hated that because, this movie had the feel of a 50's sci-fi without looking to cheap.The movie is about marine biologist working at a laboratory where something has gone wrong. What has gone wrong is the creation of a dangerous creature that appears to be amphibious in nature and also either really ticked off or possibly a man-eater.I didn't get to see the the second part of Creature because it wasn't available.
