Just saw it again last week on cable and fell in love with it again.An arrogant asst. pastor vs a humble pastor..who left a church they were with for 15 yrs, and never moved up. Sr. pastor would not let them preach until he preached himself to death and went down in pulpit. Then board voted sr. pastor and deacon out of the church, and left the two underpastors to preach. The humble one was good and members was loving him when the arrogant one jumped up and pushed him off the podium preaching by overtalking him and embarrassing him and wife. He saw himself taking over and getting rich. then head of church told him of a new church, going nationwide on tv. He got more arrogant, and it grew and he got rich, stuffing $$ in his desk drawer.It got worse,...It is a must see.
