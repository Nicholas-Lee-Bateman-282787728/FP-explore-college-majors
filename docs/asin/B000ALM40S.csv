Such issues as tenure (so research is the focus of faculty instead of quality teaching), rising tuition costs due to lack of government aid, extreme debt of students (causing them to work ridiculous hours while still going to full time school), etc. I don't want to get into too much but they really hit on some of the frightening trends in the system.Watch this carefully, it's extremely well done.",5,Very Accurate,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,520,"['have', 'worked', 'Higher', 'Education', '10', 'years', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'described', 'here', 'quite', 'accurate', 'Such', 'issues', 'tenure', 'research', 'focus', 'faculty', 'instead', 'quality', 'teaching', 'rising', 'tuition', 'costs', 'due', 'lack', 'government', 'aid', 'extreme', 'debt', 'students', 'causing', 'work', 'ridiculous', 'hours', 'still', 'going', 'full', 'time', 'school', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'hit', 'frightening', 'trends', 'system.Watch', 'carefully', 'extremely', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Some of the students mentioned that they never had to write a paper---where did these people go to college?  I had to write a paper for every class every semester---even during the summer semesters.  Not that my four year degree is better than their's, but seriously.  I went to a smaller state university, but always wanted to go to a bigger school---now I am sort of glad that I didn't after watching this.Here are my thoughts on this.  College, just like life, is what you make out of it.  If your only goal is to get a degree to get a good paying job, maybe college isn't the best choice.  If the student's goal is that, he should really evaluate whether his degree will pay off or not and if he has the ability to get the degree.  The student might be better served by going to a community college or vocational school.  Getting a degree requires some discipline and sacrifice.  Giving up four years of full time work and going to class and studying and writing papers (or I guess not in some cases) will get you that degree.  In my college work, as long as students did their work they will pass with a C or better.  If students don't want to do that, then they need to move on and do something else.I think that the real reason for the high drop out rate is because these men and women are young adults who don't know what they want from life.  All their lives, people have told them to go to college to make something out of their lives and then they find out that they don't need a college degree to have a successful life.  Some students also go to college to please their parents.  In college, they become young adults and start making choices for themselves and choose not to continue college.I was shocked by the inequality of financial aid--it isn't right that some students get refunds for financial aid while others have to work full time to pay for school.  Once again another government program that has failed.  The documentary also failed to mention that there are significantly less students now than there were in the past, which explains cuts in higher education.The last comment I wanted to make about the documentary was the variety of students that they interviewed, especially the guy who was drinking five days a week.  If I was his mom paying for his education and was aware of his social life, I would cut him off.  I don't know if he is receiving financial aid, but if he is he should be cut off and the money should be given to a more deserving student.Finally, I have to admit that I will be saving money for my daughter to go to college, but I am probably going to ask that she contribute some money for her education.  If my daughter decides that she doesn't want to finish college or even go, I will understand and encourage her to look at other options.",3,I saw this a few weeks ago,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,2855,"['saw', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'wanted', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'students', 'mentioned', 'never', 'had', 'write', 'paper', '-where', 'did', 'people', 'go', 'college', 'had', 'write', 'paper', 'class', 'semester', '-even', 'summer', 'semesters', 'Not', 'four', 'year', 'degree', 'better', 'seriously', 'went', 'smaller', 'state', 'university', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'bigger', 'school', '-now', 'am', 'sort', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'watching', 'are', 'thoughts', 'College', 'just', 'life', 'what', 'make', 'only', 'goal', 'get', 'degree', 'get', 'good', 'paying', 'job', 'maybe', 'college', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'student', 'goal', 'should', 'really', 'evaluate', 'degree', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'not', 'ability', 'get', 'degree', 'student', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'going', 'community', 'college', 'vocational', 'school', 'Getting', 'degree', 'discipline', 'sacrifice', 'Giving', 'up', 'four', 'years', 'full', 'time', 'work', 'going', 'class', 'studying', 'writing', 'papers', 'guess', 'not', 'cases', 'will', 'get', 'degree', 'college', 'work', 'as', 'long', 'students', 'did', 'work', 'will', 'pass', 'C', 'better', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'then', 'need', 'move', 'do', 'something', 'else.I', 'think', 'real', 'reason', 'high', 'drop', 'out', 'rate', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'lives', 'people', 'have', 'told', 'go', 'college', 'make', 'something', 'lives', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'college', 'degree', 'have', 'successful', 'life', 'students', 'also', 'go', 'college', 'please', 'parents', 'college', 'become', 'young', 'adults', 'start', 'making', 'choices', 'choose', 'not', 'continue', 'college.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'inequality', 'financial', 'aid', ""n't"", 'right', 'students', 'get', 'refunds', 'financial', 'aid', 'others', 'have', 'work', 'full', 'time', 'pay', 'school', 'Once', 'again', 'government', 'program', 'failed', 'documentary', 'also', 'failed', 'mention', 'are', 'significantly', 'less', 'students', 'now', 'were', 'past', 'cuts', 'higher', 'education.The', 'last', 'comment', 'wanted', 'make', 'documentary', 'was', 'variety', 'students', 'interviewed', 'especially', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'drinking', 'five', 'days', 'week', 'was', 'mom', 'paying', 'education', 'was', 'aware', 'social', 'life', 'would', 'cut', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'receiving', 'financial', 'aid', 'should', 'be', 'cut', 'off', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'deserving', 'student.Finally', 'have', 'admit', 'will', 'be', 'saving', 'money', 'daughter', 'go', 'college', 'am', 'probably', 'going', 'ask', 'contribute', 'money', 'education', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'want', 'finish', 'college', 'even', 'go', 'will', 'understand', 'encourage', 'look', 'other', 'options']",N/A

927624,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000ALM40S,Richard B. Schwartz,"[2, 2]","This is a useful introduction to the problems of higher education.  Focusing on a range of institutions, from Amherst College to a community college, it portrays the general issues by focusing on those schools, selected faculty and selected students.  The overall impression is one of heartbreak and frustration.  A fine Latina student wants to attend NYU and is admitted, but receives insufficient financial aid.  A highly-motivated African-American student attempts to put herself through school by studying full time and working full time.  Other students attend a top public institution (the University of Arizona), but spend their time guzzling beer and sleepwalking through their classes.  Meanwhile, National Merit Scholarship finalists get full rides with money left over and receive a top private school-quality education through the Arizona honors program (with its honors dorm).  College and University presidents wring their hands, explaining their plight.  A USNews official admits that their rankings have nothing to say concerning what students actually learn at the schools which they have ranked.These are familiar issues to educators, with familiar causes.  The solutions, of course, are the sticking point.  This program does a good job of depicting the problems, but it ends with the depiction.  It doesn't face the hard decisions; it simply shows the human impact of the current situation.Well worth watching.",4,Useful Introduction for the General Public,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,1430,"['useful', 'introduction', 'problems', 'higher', 'education', 'Focusing', 'range', 'institutions', 'Amherst', 'College', 'community', 'college', 'general', 'issues', 'focusing', 'schools', 'selected', 'faculty', 'selected', 'students', 'overall', 'impression', 'one', 'heartbreak', 'frustration', 'fine', 'Latina', 'student', 'attend', 'NYU', 'admitted', 'insufficient', 'financial', 'aid', 'highly-motivated', 'African-American', 'student', 'attempts', 'put', 'school', 'studying', 'full', 'time', 'working', 'full', 'time', 'Other', 'students', 'attend', 'top', 'public', 'institution', 'University', 'Arizona', 'spend', 'time', 'guzzling', 'beer', 'sleepwalking', 'classes', 'Meanwhile', 'National', 'Merit', 'Scholarship', 'get', 'full', 'rides', 'money', 'left', 'receive', 'top', 'private', 'school-quality', 'education', 'Arizona', 'honors', 'program', 'honors', 'dorm', 'College', 'University', 'presidents', 'wring', 'hands', 'explaining', 'plight', 'USNews', 'official', 'admits', 'rankings', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'concerning', 'what', 'students', 'actually', 'learn', 'schools', 'have', 'ranked.These', 'are', 'familiar', 'issues', 'educators', 'familiar', 'causes', 'solutions', 'course', 'are', 'sticking', 'point', 'program', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'problems', 'depiction', ""n't"", 'face', 'hard', 'decisions', 'simply', 'human', 'impact', 'current', 'situation.Well', 'watching']",N/A
927625,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000ALM40S,stoic,"[3, 4]","Declining by Degrees is a sobering look at the current state of higher education. The film examines four very-different institutions: the University of Arizona, Amherst College, Western Kentucky University, and the Community College of Denver. As a college professor, I could relate to many aspects of this documentary.The two-hour film focuses on three topics. The first hour concerns student life and its relation to the decline in academic standards on U.S. campuses. The next 30 minutes focus on financial issues pertaining to higher education. The final 30 minutes focus on the role of athletics on campus. I thought that the first hour was excellent, but that the last hour was somewhat disappointing. Most viewers won't find the financial issues particularly engaging; Declining by Degrees has little new to say about athletics.Declining by Degrees is also very short on solutions. Those involved in the video maintain that the only way to save higher education is by spending more tax dollars. Given that the Government has already committed to providing many services for which it currently lacks funds, this seems both unimaginative and unrealistic.Still, Declining by Degrees is worth watching for its discussion of higher education's many problems.",4,"Strong on Problems, Weak on Solutions",1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,1260,"['Declining', 'Degrees', 'sobering', 'look', 'current', 'state', 'higher', 'education', 'film', 'four', 'very-different', 'institutions', 'University', 'Arizona', 'Amherst', 'College', 'Western', 'Kentucky', 'University', 'Community', 'College', 'Denver', 'college', 'professor', 'could', 'relate', 'many', 'aspects', 'documentary.The', 'two-hour', 'film', 'focuses', 'three', 'topics', 'first', 'hour', 'concerns', 'student', 'life', 'relation', 'decline', 'academic', 'standards', 'U.S.', 'campuses', 'next', '30', 'minutes', 'focus', 'financial', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'higher', 'education', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'focus', 'role', 'athletics', 'campus', 'thought', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'excellent', 'last', 'hour', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'financial', 'issues', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'Declining', 'Degrees', 'little', 'new', 'say', 'athletics.Declining', 'Degrees', 'also', 'very', 'short', 'solutions', 'involved', 'video', 'maintain', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'higher', 'education', 'spending', 'more', 'tax', 'dollars', 'Given', 'Government', 'already', 'committed', 'providing', 'many', 'services', 'currently', 'funds', 'unimaginative', 'unrealistic.Still', 'Declining', 'Degrees', 'worth', 'watching', 'discussion', 'higher', 'education', 'many', 'problems']",N/A
