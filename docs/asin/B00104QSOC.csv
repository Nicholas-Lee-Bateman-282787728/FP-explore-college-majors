We worry about them; they creep up on us; they challenge us and shape us.  How people adapt to tragedy, however, can be a source of fascination and inspiration.  One of the best things a film can do is to get us into others' shoes and show how their inner journey unfolds for them.Such is the case of `The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,' based on the autobiographical account of Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Almaric), the editor for Frances' prestigious 'Elle' magazine.  His account is one of adaptation.  From a glamorous and prosperous playboy with a family, including, Ce'line (Emmannelle Se'igner) his long-suffering partner and mother of his three children, this jet-setter seemed to have everything going for him.From the beginning of Julian Schnabel's directorial masterpiece we find our protagonist awakening in fits and blurs, discovering a brightly lit hospital room where he is gazed upon by doctors, nurses, and other personnel.  We can tell he is disoriented, but we know his thoughts as they are narrated during the opening scenes.  We quickly discover that he cannot speak, for he learns that his thoughts are not being received by anyone, yet he can hear what they're saying.  Soon we have a serious meeting with a doctor who informs him that he has had a stroke and is paralyzed.  The repercussions come quickly as he becomes dependent on people who bathe him and his choices seemingly diminish.  We feel his discomfort as a fly sits upon his nose with no self-recourse and an attendant comes into his room to turn off a thoroughly absorbing game of soccer on TV.  More unsettling is an early scene where fully conscious he watches a specialist sew stitches closing his right eye.Soon Ce'line comes to visit, and he daily gets a therapist, Henrietta (Marie Jose' Croze) who teaches him to communicate, blinking once for ""oui"" and twice for ""non"" with his good left eye.  For anyone this new life would be difficult, but for someone so independent in his chic life, it must have been excruciating.  Using the blinking method, Bauby can choose the letters he wishes to convey as Henrietta dictates them close to his bed.  Asking him what he wants, he chooses to let her spell out ""D-E-A-T-H"".  Volumes of emotion are written on these wonderful actresses' faces as they convey their discomfort with Jean-Dominique.  His lover is ambivalent.  Certainly sympathetic about her lover's new condition, she also ponders the scars of disinterest that have marred her own life.But like many tragedies, adjustment makes life better.  Unable to have the mobility, Jean-Dominique learns to rely more on memories and imagination as his chief resources to make life meaningful and enriching.  We see some truly poignant moments with his father (here played in a welcome performance by Max Von Sydow), whom he comforts by shaving.  We also see flashbacks to times with his own family and times with his lover, including some ironic scenes when he went with her to Lourdes when he wasn`t seeking miracles in his own life.Watching this film, I was reminded in a casual way of Fellini's `8 ' where the flight of imagination is captured so concretely.  His visions are captured beautifully by Schnabel and art director, Janusz Kaminski, who give us a visual feast of Bauby's memories and imagination.  After 112 minutes I felt I had gone on the same journey, able to capture and understand a man whose life was a smorgasbord of sensual endeavors cut short by an inconvenient reality that had him rely on his inner resources to find meaning and solace when he was used to gathering it himself from the physical world.  From being submerged and confined (as a diving bell), his imagination takes beauty and flight (the butterfly).  In the end, 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly' is a beautiful true story told from a convincing point-of-view.",4,Beautiful Inner Visions,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,3875,"['Life', 'filled', 'contingencies', 'worry', 'creep', 'up', 'challenge', 'shape', 'How', 'people', 'adapt', 'tragedy', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'source', 'fascination', 'inspiration', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'others', 'shoes', 'show', 'how', 'inner', 'journey', 'unfolds', 'them.Such', 'case', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'account', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'Mathieu', 'Almaric', 'editor', 'Frances', 'prestigious', ""'Elle"", 'magazine', 'account', 'one', 'adaptation', 'glamorous', 'prosperous', 'playboy', 'family', 'including', ""Ce'line"", 'Emmannelle', ""Se'igner"", 'long-suffering', 'partner', 'mother', 'three', 'children', 'jet-setter', 'seemed', 'have', 'everything', 'going', 'beginning', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'directorial', 'masterpiece', 'find', 'protagonist', 'awakening', 'fits', 'blurs', 'discovering', 'brightly', 'lit', 'hospital', 'room', 'where', 'gazed', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'other', 'personnel', 'can', 'tell', 'disoriented', 'know', 'thoughts', 'are', 'narrated', 'opening', 'scenes', 'quickly', 'discover', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'received', 'anyone', 'yet', 'can', 'hear', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'Soon', 'have', 'serious', 'meeting', 'doctor', 'who', 'had', 'stroke', 'paralyzed', 'repercussions', 'come', 'quickly', 'dependent', 'people', 'who', 'bathe', 'choices', 'seemingly', 'diminish', 'feel', 'discomfort', 'fly', 'nose', 'self-recourse', 'attendant', 'room', 'turn', 'off', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'game', 'soccer', 'TV', 'More', 'unsettling', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'fully', 'conscious', 'specialist', 'sew', 'stitches', 'closing', 'right', 'eye.Soon', ""Ce'line"", 'visit', 'daily', 'therapist', 'Henrietta', 'Marie', 'Jose', 'Croze', 'who', 'communicate', 'blinking', 'once', 'oui', 'twice', 'non', 'good', 'left', 'eye', 'anyone', 'new', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'someone', 'so', 'independent', 'chic', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'excruciating', 'Using', 'blinking', 'method', 'Bauby', 'can', 'choose', 'letters', 'convey', 'Henrietta', 'close', 'bed', 'Asking', 'what', 'let', 'spell', 'D-E-A-T-H', 'Volumes', 'emotion', 'are', 'written', 'wonderful', 'actresses', 'convey', 'discomfort', 'Jean-Dominique', 'lover', 'ambivalent', 'Certainly', 'sympathetic', 'lover', 'new', 'condition', 'also', 'scars', 'disinterest', 'have', 'marred', 'own', 'life.But', 'many', 'tragedies', 'adjustment', 'life', 'better', 'Unable', 'have', 'mobility', 'Jean-Dominique', 'rely', 'more', 'memories', 'imagination', 'chief', 'resources', 'make', 'life', 'meaningful', 'enriching', 'see', 'truly', 'poignant', 'moments', 'father', 'here', 'played', 'welcome', 'performance', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'whom', 'shaving', 'also', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'times', 'own', 'family', 'times', 'lover', 'including', 'ironic', 'scenes', 'when', 'went', 'Lourdes', 'when', 'wasn', 't', 'seeking', 'miracles', 'own', 'life.Watching', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'casual', 'way', 'Fellini', '8', 'where', 'flight', 'imagination', 'captured', 'so', 'concretely', 'visions', 'are', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'Schnabel', 'art', 'director', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'who', 'give', 'visual', 'feast', 'Bauby', 'memories', 'imagination', '112', 'minutes', 'felt', 'had', 'gone', 'same', 'journey', 'able', 'capture', 'understand', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'smorgasbord', 'sensual', 'endeavors', 'cut', 'short', 'inconvenient', 'reality', 'had', 'rely', 'inner', 'resources', 'find', 'meaning', 'solace', 'when', 'was', 'used', 'gathering', 'physical', 'world', 'being', 'submerged', 'confined', 'diving', 'bell', 'imagination', 'beauty', 'flight', 'butterfly', 'end', ""'The"", 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'beautiful', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'convincing', 'point-of-view']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124110,A1KKTLPJG5J1ZZ,B00104QSOC,Adam,"[5, 7]","'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly' directed by Julian Schnabel, is a fantastic French film. It's about Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) , who was editor for French 'Elle' magazine, and who, in 1995, had a massive stroke, which left him totally paralysed. How Almaric conveys the 'feeling of claustrophobia and not make it a depressing experience is just extraordinary'. However, Bauby can move his left eyelid, and this is how he communicates with his therapist, and over time he writes his memoir. It's a powerful and poignant film with much pathos, but with elements of humour, too. What I found particularly interesting about the film, was not only the story, but the cinematography. Most of the scenes are presented from Bauby's point of view, and the way the camera does this is nothing short of brilliant, as well as the use of flashbacks to tell his story.

1124113,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B00104QSOC,AIROLF,"[3, 5]","The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a pretty good film, but not the best movie you'll ever see. It's a typical French film in a sense that it's done with a different point of view than an American film would be. After all, what's considered artsy in Hollywood is almost procedural in the French cinema. Yet, this movie was done by an American director -  Julian Schnabel, who did not yield to pressure to make this film in English, believing that the story needed to be told exclusively in French, and even learned French to make the movie.What puts this movie on a lot of critics' Top Ten List of 2007 is the story itself and its undenying hopeful message. What's truly enlightening about this movie is the surprising comedic element in it and the way comedy makes the story more acceptable, more endurable and, in a way, more part of the human experience.Based on the French memoir Le scaphandre et le papillon by Jean-Dominique Bauby, a journalist and the editor of the ELLE magazine in Paris, who at 43 suffered a stroke that left him with what is known as a ""locked-in syndrome,"" the film is told from the protagonist's point of view; so often all we see is a blink of an eye or a blurry view of the TV. This allows the audience to participate with the character in his struggle to regain some of the humanity and in his determination ""to write"" his experiences by blinking his narration to an amanuensis.Because of the spectacular camera-work by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) film often feels like a documentary even in some of the clearly allegorical and fictional experiences.Overall, this movie should be watched for the experience of seeing, but also, experiencing something new and extraordinary - a life that we all hope never having to experience firsthand.",4,humanity at it's strongest,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,1865,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'typical', 'French', 'film', 'sense', 'done', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'American', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'considered', 'artsy', 'Hollywood', 'almost', 'procedural', 'French', 'cinema', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'American', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'yield', 'pressure', 'make', 'film', 'English', 'believing', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'exclusively', 'French', 'even', 'learned', 'French', 'make', 'movie.What', 'movie', 'lot', 'critics', 'Top', 'Ten', 'List', '2007', 'story', 'undenying', 'hopeful', 'message', 'What', 'truly', 'enlightening', 'movie', 'surprising', 'comedic', 'element', 'way', 'comedy', 'story', 'more', 'acceptable', 'more', 'endurable', 'way', 'more', 'part', 'human', 'experience.Based', 'French', 'memoir', 'Le', 'scaphandre', 'et', 'le', 'papillon', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'journalist', 'editor', 'ELLE', 'magazine', 'Paris', 'who', '43', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'left', 'what', 'known', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'film', 'told', 'protagonist', 'point', 'view', 'so', 'often', 'see', 'blink', 'eye', 'blurry', 'view', 'TV', 'audience', 'participate', 'character', 'struggle', 'regain', 'humanity', 'determination', 'write', 'experiences', 'blinking', 'narration', 'amanuensis.Because', 'spectacular', 'camera-work', 'cinematographer', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'film', 'often', 'documentary', 'even', 'clearly', 'allegorical', 'fictional', 'experiences.Overall', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'experience', 'seeing', 'also', 'experiencing', 'something', 'new', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'hope', 'never', 'having', 'experience', 'firsthand']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124114,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00104QSOC,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","The true story that inspired this movie is well-known. Jean-Dominque Bauby, the French editor of ""Elle"" magazine, suffered a massive stroke that left him completely paralyzed with a condition called ""Locked-in"" syndrome. When he came out of his coma, he had recovered all his mental faculties but was completely paralyzed with the exception of his ability to blink his left eyelid.His therapist developed a method for him to communicate through blinking and he was able to dictate an entire book in this manner.I thought this movie might be depressing but it really was not. I found it profoundly uplifting. It took Bauby 200,000 blinks to dictate the book. Each word took two minutes. From the excerpts we hear through Bauby's voice-over, it is extremely beautiful. What a heroic act -- to overcome one's self-pity and face reality in such challenging circumstances.The movie starts as if the viewer is looking through Bauby's eyes, though it later widens out, and it returns to that at the end. The acting and photography are excellent. The director decided to film the movie in the same hospital where Bauby had been treated so we see the scene he describes from the balcony where they wheel him from time to time.Mathieu Amalric as Bauby is extraordinary. In the DVD extra material (which I rarely watch but in this case is interesting) he describes how difficult it was to hold himself completely still when he is not in fact paralysed. There are also nice performances from Anne Consigny as the therapist and Emmanuelle Seigner as Bauby's ex-partner and the mother of his three children. Max von Sydow gives a tremendous performance as Bauby's father.This movie explores what it means to be human and how resilient the human spirit can be.

1124115,A38PC1H0VW52V4,B00104QSOC,Andy Meneses,"[2, 2]","The most striking element of the film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is most certainly the cinematography. The majority of the film is shot from the perspective of Jean-Dominique Bauby's eye. This creates some very interesting and dynamic shots. I found the first couple scenes particularly interesting. When the film begins, Mr. Bauby's eye slowly opens and looks around the room. The Camera is extremely out of focus and blurry. It immediately draws you deep into the film. As people begin to take notice of Mr. Bauby's awakening the shallow focus becomes more obvious. People's faces are blurry until they move as close as possible to the camera. As the film progresses, the depth of field progressively become deeper. As Mr. Bauby's vision becomes clearer, so do ours. The attention to realism and detail in the film is the most important part of it. The purpose of the attention to detail is clear; the film invites us to become fully immersed in the experience of Jean-Dominique.Later in the film we are kicked out of Jean-Dominique Bauby's perspective rather abruptly. The cinematographer makes some really unique stylistic choices throughout the film. For example, the scene in which Mr. Bauby is driving in his convertible soon before his stroke, the camera moves often and abnormally. Sometimes the camera focuses upward at the sky and the tops of buildings from inside the car. While many different symbols and other things can be inferred from this stylistic choice, it at the very least sets the film apart from the norm.As with any film, a combination of cinematography, directing, and editing make a film work or fail but ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly's"" cinematography creates a unique and intriguing feel to the film that draws you in and never lets go, even when it kicks you out.",4,Diving Bell and Butterly,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,1806,"['most', 'striking', 'element', 'film', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'most', 'certainly', 'cinematography', 'majority', 'film', 'shot', 'perspective', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'eye', 'very', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'shots', 'found', 'first', 'couple', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'When', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Bauby', 'eye', 'slowly', 'room', 'Camera', 'extremely', 'focus', 'blurry', 'immediately', 'deep', 'film', 'people', 'begin', 'take', 'notice', 'Mr.', 'Bauby', 'awakening', 'shallow', 'focus', 'more', 'obvious', 'People', 'are', 'blurry', 'move', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'camera', 'film', 'depth', 'field', 'progressively', 'become', 'deeper', 'Mr.', 'Bauby', 'vision', 'clearer', 'so', 'do', 'ours', 'attention', 'realism', 'detail', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'purpose', 'attention', 'detail', 'clear', 'film', 'become', 'fully', 'immersed', 'experience', 'Jean-Dominique.Later', 'film', 'are', 'kicked', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'perspective', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'cinematographer', 'really', 'unique', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'film', 'example', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Bauby', 'driving', 'convertible', 'soon', 'stroke', 'camera', 'often', 'abnormally', 'Sometimes', 'camera', 'upward', 'sky', 'tops', 'buildings', 'car', 'many', 'different', 'symbols', 'other', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'inferred', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'very', 'least', 'film', 'apart', 'norm.As', 'film', 'combination', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'editing', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'fail', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'cinematography', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'feel', 'film', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'even', 'when', 'out']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

1124120,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00104QSOC,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","A truly phenomenal piece of film-making and storytelling, THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY is poignant, frightening, and not-just-a-tad funny.Based on the real-life story of Elle Magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby (i.e., Jean-Do) who suffered a massive stroke leaving him only able to communicate via eye blinks, the story is so human, so entertaining, and so well presented through the use of first-person experience from Jean-Do's perspective that it won over audiences worldwide. Winning the Best Foreign Language film category in multiple film festivals, and being nominated for four Oscars (2007), this little French film strives and succeeds.Mathieu Amalric stars as Jean-Do, the poor guy who will eventually have what is termed as ""locked-in syndrome,"" a stroke that allows him only the power to move his left eye and eyelid. Waking up from the stroke after nearly a month in a coma, Jean-Do's realization of his condition is frightening, funny, and even a bit exhilarating. The fright comes from the fact that he can do nothing for himself, including shriek in horror as they stitch close his right eye (all of this is viewed via Jean's perspective; cloudy, muddled, and freakish). The funny portions come from his sexual awareness of those around him. The pretty nurses. The beautiful Henriette who specializes in speech therapy. And the women who used to worship him but now are left with a shell of what he once was. The exhilaration comes from what's left of Jean's imagination as he battles his locked-in syndrome (The Diving Bell) by allowing his imagination to wander (The Butterfly).As Jean-Do learns to use his left eye to communicate, he also learns he probably doesn't have a lot of quality time left to him, so he starts ""dictating"" his memoirs. His death soon after it was published proves that he knew the exact right time to get this done.But back to the film itself...The filming technique of using the camera to show what Jean-Do hears, sees, and feels is so well played that it might make some viewers claustrophobic. I know I felt a little uncomfortable. And it is this technique that helps carry the movie to greater heights than it would have if filmed from someone else's perspective.The special features on the DVD are interesting and I HAVE TO comment on the appearance of director Julian Schnabel in this section. Although not relevant to the film itself, I nearly cracked-up laughing when I saw Mr. Schnabel; the guy looks like a troll! Sorry. I just had to mention that, as it really confounded me. Here's a guy with a great vision and probably not-a-little money in his pocket running around in tattered sweats and a grotesque looking hat. Bizarre!Getting back on-topic...This is something you'll need to see if you're into great filming and new techniques. It's not the greatest film, but you'll enjoy how it's woven together. And watch for veteran actor Max von Sydow (The Seventh Seal) as Jean-Do's forgetful father in an unforgettable series of scenes.",4,Locked-In But Not Locked-Away,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2995,"['truly', 'phenomenal', 'piece', 'film-making', 'storytelling', 'THE', 'DIVING', 'BELL', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'poignant', 'frightening', 'not-just-a-tad', 'funny.Based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Elle', 'Magazine', 'editor', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'i.e.', 'Jean-Do', 'who', 'suffered', 'massive', 'stroke', 'leaving', 'only', 'able', 'communicate', 'eye', 'blinks', 'story', 'so', 'human', 'so', 'entertaining', 'so', 'well', 'presented', 'use', 'first-person', 'experience', 'Jean-Do', 'perspective', 'won', 'over', 'audiences', 'worldwide', 'Winning', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'film', 'category', 'multiple', 'film', 'festivals', 'being', 'nominated', 'four', 'Oscars', '2007', 'little', 'French', 'film', 'strives', 'succeeds.Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'Jean-Do', 'poor', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'have', 'what', 'termed', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'stroke', 'only', 'power', 'move', 'left', 'eye', 'eyelid', 'Waking', 'up', 'stroke', 'nearly', 'month', 'coma', 'Jean-Do', 'realization', 'condition', 'frightening', 'funny', 'even', 'bit', 'exhilarating', 'fright', 'fact', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'including', 'shriek', 'horror', 'stitch', 'close', 'right', 'eye', 'viewed', 'Jean', 'perspective', 'cloudy', 'muddled', 'freakish', 'funny', 'portions', 'come', 'sexual', 'awareness', 'pretty', 'nurses', 'beautiful', 'Henriette', 'who', 'speech', 'therapy', 'women', 'who', 'used', 'worship', 'now', 'are', 'left', 'shell', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'exhilaration', 'what', 'left', 'Jean', 'imagination', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'allowing', 'imagination', 'wander', 'Butterfly', '.As', 'Jean-Do', 'learns', 'use', 'left', 'eye', 'communicate', 'also', 'probably', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'quality', 'time', 'left', 'so', 'dictating', 'memoirs', 'death', 'soon', 'was', 'published', 'proves', 'knew', 'exact', 'right', 'time', 'get', 'done.But', 'back', 'film', 'filming', 'technique', 'using', 'camera', 'show', 'what', 'Jean-Do', 'sees', 'feels', 'so', 'well', 'might', 'make', 'viewers', 'claustrophobic', 'know', 'felt', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'technique', 'carry', 'movie', 'greater', 'heights', 'would', 'have', 'filmed', 'someone', 'else', 'perspective.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'interesting', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'comment', 'appearance', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'section', 'not', 'relevant', 'film', 'nearly', 'cracked-up', 'laughing', 'when', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Schnabel', 'guy', 'troll', 'Sorry', 'just', 'had', 'mention', 'that', 'really', 'confounded', 'Here', 'guy', 'great', 'vision', 'probably', 'not-a-little', 'money', 'pocket', 'running', 'around', 'tattered', 'sweats', 'grotesque', 'looking', 'hat', 'Bizarre', 'Getting', 'back', 'on-topic', 'something', ""'ll"", 'need', 'see', ""'re"", 'great', 'filming', 'new', 'techniques', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'how', 'woven', 'together', 'watch', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'Jean-Do', 'forgetful', 'father', 'unforgettable', 'series', 'scenes']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

The idea behind it seemed like typical Hollywood biopic where it wants to do something so heavyhanded and even manipulative so that way audiences can and will walk out of theatres in tears. But giving the film a chance, I found it to be surprisingly effective and even inspiring and yet the lack of press and attention the film got just seems a bit unfair but at least critics and awards came their way and even if you probably never heard of it, it's still one of last year's better pictures.Jean-Dominique Bauby was a fashion editor for Elle magazine who was quite the womanizer and had numerous affairs. But suffering a stroke and awakening 3 weeks later, he finds that he has a rare condition called ""locked-in syndrome"": completely aware and conscious of his surroundings but basically paralyzed head to toe save his left eye. With the help of his ex Celine, his speech therapist Henriette and Claude, another magazine employee, Jean-Do writes a book using a unique speech system and learning how to escape into his mind and break through his cell, as he calls it.Why the film wasn't nominated for Best Picture along with David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" is kind of criminal. These 2 films easily beat Juno and Atonement and I'd even go as far to say that they both beat winner No Country for Old Men. While it's not exactly everyone's style, the film is quite engrossing and remarkably restrained in telling the story and it never feels like the film is repeatedly telling you how you should be inspired and the film lets the audience decide. Using a unique technique of having entire scenes devoted to Bauby's point of view, we see just how helpless he is and the disconnect between what he's thinking and what his body's doing. In one scene, he outright laughs at a rude comment by a phone installer only to cut back to his permanently fixed face. It's a nice way at showing just how the condition would feel like since as they say, the condition is extremely rare.Acting-wise it's quite exceptional across the board. Mathieu Amalric is particularly noteworthy as Bauby and we also have Max Von Sydow who really only has 2 scenes but really adds a lot to the film. Even though faces and names can sometimes be confusing, the 3 main actress add a whole lot to the film, not only emotionally but let's face it, they're not hard on the eyes. One thing I noticed and it's super minor and most wouldn't even care but the subtitles for the film are according to the English translation so when a character confirms that he wants to say a ""I"", the actress says ""J"" as in ""je"" which means I in English so it's kind of a weird disconnect but most wouldn't notice anyway.It wasn't as well-known or wide-reaching as the other big films but I'd recommend Diving Bell and the Butterfly to anyone that wants to see solid filmmaking.",5,One of my favorites of 2007 or any year,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,2910,"['When', 'initially', 'heard', 'film', 'premise', 'have', 'admit', 'balked', 'little', 'bit', 'idea', 'seemed', 'like', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'where', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'heavyhanded', 'even', 'manipulative', 'so', 'way', 'audiences', 'can', 'will', 'walk', 'theatres', 'tears', 'giving', 'film', 'chance', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'even', 'inspiring', 'yet', 'lack', 'press', 'attention', 'film', 'got', 'just', 'bit', 'unfair', 'least', 'critics', 'awards', 'came', 'way', 'even', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'still', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'better', 'pictures.Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'was', 'fashion', 'editor', 'Elle', 'magazine', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'womanizer', 'had', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'suffering', 'stroke', 'awakening', '3', 'weeks', 'later', 'rare', 'condition', 'called', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'completely', 'aware', 'conscious', 'surroundings', 'basically', 'paralyzed', 'head', 'toe', 'save', 'left', 'eye', 'help', 'ex', 'Celine', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Henriette', 'Claude', 'magazine', 'employee', 'Jean-Do', 'book', 'using', 'unique', 'speech', 'system', 'learning', 'how', 'escape', 'mind', 'break', 'cell', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Zodiac', 'kind', 'criminal', '2', 'films', 'easily', 'beat', 'Juno', 'Atonement', ""'d"", 'even', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'beat', 'winner', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'not', 'exactly', 'everyone', 'style', 'film', 'quite', 'engrossing', 'remarkably', 'restrained', 'telling', 'story', 'never', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'telling', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'inspired', 'film', 'audience', 'decide', 'Using', 'unique', 'technique', 'having', 'entire', 'scenes', 'devoted', 'Bauby', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'helpless', 'disconnect', 'what', 'thinking', 'what', 'body', 'doing', 'one', 'scene', 'outright', 'laughs', 'rude', 'comment', 'phone', 'installer', 'only', 'cut', 'back', 'permanently', 'fixed', 'face', 'nice', 'way', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'condition', 'would', 'feel', 'like', 'say', 'condition', 'extremely', 'rare.Acting-wise', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'board', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'Bauby', 'also', 'have', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'really', 'only', '2', 'scenes', 'really', 'lot', 'film', 'Even', 'names', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'confusing', '3', 'main', 'actress', 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'emotionally', 'let', 'face', ""'re"", 'not', 'hard', 'eyes', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'super', 'minor', 'most', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'subtitles', 'film', 'are', 'according', 'English', 'translation', 'so', 'when', 'character', 'say', 'actress', 'J', 'je', 'English', 'kind', 'weird', 'disconnect', 'most', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anyway.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'well-known', 'wide-reaching', 'other', 'big', 'films', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'anyone', 'see', 'solid', 'filmmaking']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

A speech therapist devised a chart with the letters of the alphabet arranged by frequency of use, and as she spoke the letters Bauby would blink for the letter he wanted. Though locked in the heavy ""diving bell"" of his useless body, Bauby's imagination could still fly as playfully as a butterfly. For most of the film viewers have the perspective of Bauby--awkward camera angles, people only partially in his limited field of vision or too close, blurry images that fade in and out, and wanting to say what was precisely on his brain but could not utter. Only forty-five minutes into the film do we actually see Bauby himself.

This is one movie that deserves all the cliches that are so overused today: Riveting, powerful, moving.  I'm not into current movies, but I'm glad I made an exception here because it restores my faith in the filmmaking industry that original movies (or, in this case, adaptations from books) can not only be made, but in a way that keeps you watching and has the experience stay with you.Shooting the movie from the perspective of the late Jean-Dominique Bauby was beyond brilliant.  It wasn't done in a contrived way, but, rather, in a way that you felt you were right there with Bauby in a body that, indeed, became a prison.Other reviewers on this page have covered just about everything regarding the film, but I will put my hat in the ring and say this is one movie that deserves putting aside almost two hours to watch.

1124130,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00104QSOC,Doug Anderson,"[22, 34]","At the age of 43, Elle magazine editor (and womanizer extraordinaire) Jean-Dominique Bauby suffers a severe stroke that leaves his entire body paralyzed, save for one eyelid. The stroke is, in fact, so severe that doctors describe his very rare condition as a ""locked-in"" state, because although his left eyelid is the only functioning muscle in his body, his brain is perfectly lucid. The accident radically diminishes Bauby's communicative abilities. Eventually, he begins to communicate with nurses and friends via a sort of Morse code of eye twitches, but the process of forming words one letter at a time is tedious to say the least and often invites only intense frustration and intense loneliness. Most of the film is, therefore, Bauby looking on the world with his one eye and speaking to himself. Luckily, his memory and imagination, and, most importantly, his sense of humor, remain intact. Many scenes involve an inert Bauby daydreaming about his female therapists who, ironically enough, resemble Elle models (and these daydreams provide much needed comic relief). Another irony is that, just before the accident, a publisher had been negotiating with Bauby for a memoir. Once he has the accident the publisher, like most of the fashion world, assumes Bauby is a vegetable. To the publishers surprise, however, Bauby decides to go ahead with the project (even though it means writing his memoir one blink at a time). ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is that memoir.Schnabel, already a long established figure in the world of fine art, has paintings hanging in many of the worlds finest museums. And it is obvious that Schnabel identifies with Bauby, who was a visual artist in his own right. From the opening credits to the word fin (""Diving Bell and Butterfly"" is in French with English subtitles), the film is, in many ways, a series of shimmering dream-like surfaces. Surfaces may imply depth but the fact remains that visual art can only hint at the possible depths while literature and film (and other narrative arts) can dwell, or at least offer the illusion of dwelling, in the depths. Schnabel is an artist who exists between mediums and that is evident here as this looks and feels like a piece of visual art first, with narrative being only a secondary concern. This film is, in many ways, a series of impressions only loosely and provisionally linked by Bauby's narrative which is a suspicious one (Bauby calls attention to his own unreliability at least once). Surfaces are dwelled on at length and even if they are not ultimatley to be trusted (because, in the artist especially, the impulse to aestheticize and fabricate and perfect imperfect nature is so strong)they tend to both inspire and to provide solace. Oddly enough, though Bauby had several lovers (so many that the viewer may, at times, have a hard time figuring out just who is who among them) the one that he seems to care most about, ""Ines"", is never shown (or shown so briefly that she exists primarily as a fantasy or muse).But, again, everything the artist touches/contemplates/imagines is aestheticized; even his daydreams and fantasies look like the fashion fantasy spreads you see in the pages of, well, women's (and men's) fashion magazines. At times his pre-accident life seems exciting and at times it seems fairly superficial (we experience Bauby's life before the accident only as he  remembers it).  Some viewers might desire to know less about what it all looked like and sounded like (an excellent rock sountrack includes Velvet Underground & Tom Waits) and more about what motivated such a man to rise to the top of his game. All we really know is that Bauby dedicated his life to visual pleasure and this, more than anything else, is what Schnabel seems to be drawn to. Lovers of visual art (oil painting, graphic art, photography etc...) will respond favorably and most likely be the most outspoken champions of this film; while lovers of narrative art will be divided as to the effectiveness of Schnabel's visual representations of Bauby's locked-in state. The Diving Bell is such an obvious metaphor that it is not as poignant as it should be (plus it may remind some viewers of Dustin Hoffman's scuba scene in The Graduate). And the Butterfly as a metaphor is barely mentioned. The most affecting images are the ones that do not function as metaphors (the intensely vivid close-ups of insect and plant life, the enormous mountains of ice sliding into the sea). Schnabel is at his best when he foregoes conventional rhetorical sense-making and ventures into the pre-or-post-verbal world of hyper-real imagery that symbolizes nothing literally but simply is what it is. In this sense, Schnabel is the cinematic equivalent of a postmodernist. A lot of the imagery feels like borrowed and appropriated documentary footage which is perhaps fitting as Bauby also possessed a flair for exausted-but-forever- renewed aesthetic schemes/scenarios (evidenced in his Marie Antoinette fantasies, and in his desire to re-write 'The Count of Monte Cristo""). Both Schnabel and Bauby share a penchant for quoting the past (art and film history) albeit ironically. And while both share a kind of mercenary attitude toward the arts and women, neither of them are above sentimentality when it comes to father and son relationships.Perhaps the film is, in the end, a psychoanalytic self-portrait of the artist(s); a self-reckoning whereby the artist attempts to resolve conflicting impulses. On the one hand the artist seeks to live in the glow of the aestheticizing impulse (the mothers love), while, on the other hand, the artist seeks to be valued socially (the father's respect, recognition, and approval). Rarely do artists achieve what they seek or what is necessary or what will suffice to achieve balance in their lives (and that is why more creative work is always necessary). This film expresses better than any other what that balance might feel like were you an artist who had just accomplished such a feat.",4,The Artist of the Floating World,1198195200,"12 21,

Bauby had a massive stroke at the age of 43 which left him with a condition called locked-in syndrome which paralyzed him from the neck down. This condition left him with only his left eye from which he could blink in order to communicate with the outside world.The acting is excellent in this movie with Bauby played by Mathiew Amalric, his wife by Emmanuelle Seigner (from Roman Polanski's ""Bitter Mood""), his speech therapist played by Marie Josee Croze (from the ""Barbarian Invasions""), and his father by Max von Sydow. This movie is inspirational and sad but also represented with humour as Bauby's imagination lifts him beyond the confines of his body.The DVD has an excellent transfer and comes with a number of special features including The Making of  the Diving Bell and the Butterfly (12m), a Cinematic Vision (7m), a Charlie Rose interview with Julian Schnabel (20m), and audio commentary with the director.",5,True life story...,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1113,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', '2007', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Basquiat', 'Night', 'Falls', 'biographical', 'story', 'based', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Bauby', 'had', 'massive', 'stroke', 'age', '43', 'left', 'condition', 'called', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'paralyzed', 'neck', 'down', 'condition', 'left', 'only', 'left', 'eye', 'could', 'blink', 'order', 'communicate', 'outside', 'world.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Bauby', 'played', 'Mathiew', 'Amalric', 'wife', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Bitter', 'Mood', 'speech', 'therapist', 'played', 'Marie', 'Josee', 'Croze', 'Barbarian', 'Invasions', 'father', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'movie', 'inspirational', 'sad', 'also', 'represented', 'humour', 'Bauby', 'imagination', 'confines', 'body.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'Making', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', '12m', 'Cinematic', 'Vision', '7m', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'interview', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', '20m', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124132,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00104QSOC,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Imagine being left immobilized after a massive stroke, and having the ability to move only your left eye. Such was the case of 43-year-oldFrench Ellemagazine editor-in-chief Jean-Dominique Bauby in December 1995 when he awakened from a twenty-day coma to find himself mentally active but physically paralyzed. To think he would have the wherewithal to write a poignant and elegant memoir through the blink of his eye is astounding, but he did it and the publication date of his book was a mere two days before his death in 1997. It takes someone with painter/filmmaker Julian Schnabel's (Before Night Falls) visual flair to bring such a fragile but empowering story to cinematic life, and screenwriter Ronald Harwood (The Pianist) has done a compelling job translating Bauby's book into a highly charged story that complements Schnabel's bold filmmaking choices.The 2007 film begins with Bauby, known as Jean-Do to his friends, slipping in and out of consciousness, slowly realizing he has his faculties but cannot communicate with is doctors. The first half-hour shows only Bauby's viewpoint with his thoughts articulated through an interior monologue shared with the viewer. It's an intentionally constricted technique that Schnabel uses effectively to convey Bauby's helpless state. Four women play pivotal roles in his road toward at least partial recovery - speech therapist Henriette, who teaches him the blinking technique that enables him to communicate; physiotherapist Marie who demonstrates a series of tongue exercises that sets Bauby off on some hilariously profane thoughts; his estranged partner C&eacute;line who bore and raised his three children and is now willing to take on the role of caretaker; and finally Claude, the editor who has come to take dictation for the book Bauby promised to his publisher before his stroke. These encounters are intertwined with fantasy sequences and flashbacks where we see the fully functional Bauby. There are an excellent couple of scenes between Bauby and his curmudgeonly father that shows just how much son takes after father and how vibrant and flawed Bauby was before his paralysis.The acting is outstanding beginning with Mathieu Amalric (the informant Louis in Steven Spielberg'sMunich) as Bauby. In a powerful, unsentimental performance that recalls the exalted levels achieved by Daniel Day-Lewis inMy Left Footand Javier Bardem inThe Sea Inside, the French actor conveys the fertile brain at work and the vibrant man that has been forcibly left behind. Amalric also shows how human-sized his character is, a philanderer who still manages to engender the devotion of those closest to him. The actresses playing the women - Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze, Olatz Lopez Garmendia (Schnabel's real-life wife), Emmanuelle Seigner, and Anne Consigny -are all strong if a bit interchangeable. The legendary Max Von Sydow steals his brief scenes as Bauby's homebound father. There is masterful work by Spielberg's longtime cinematographer Janusz Kami&ntilde;ski (his latest work is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) seamlessly alternating between the reality and fantasy aspects of the narrative.It is a remarkable film that on the surface, appears to focus on the traumatic effects of sensory deprivation, but evolves into a triumph of an eloquent soul yearning to share life's often harsh lessons with the world. Four bonus features are included in the 2008 DVD. The first is a standard, thirteen-minute making-of featurette, ""Submerged: The Making of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" featuring the principal cast and crew as they share their thoughts on the production under Schnabel's direction. The second is the shorter ""A Cinematic Vision"", which describes what was done to convey Bauby's first-person point of view during the first part of the film. There is also a twenty-minute Charlie Rose interview with Schnabel from 2007, which turns out to be a lot more informative than the director's audio commentary on the film. Schnabel is disappointingly reticent with his observations, and it would have been good to have someone like Amalric or Harwood available to prompt greater insights. Regardless, it's a fine package for such an accomplished film. By the way, the diving bell of the title is refers to Bauby's horrendous physical limitations, and the butterfly represents his fertile imagination.",5,"Finding Eloquence Against Foreboding Odds in a Mesmerizing, Resonant Film",1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,4379,"['Imagine', 'being', 'left', 'immobilized', 'massive', 'stroke', 'having', 'ability', 'move', 'only', 'left', 'eye', 'Such', 'was', 'case', '43-year-oldFrench', 'Ellemagazine', 'editor-in-chief', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'December', '1995', 'when', 'awakened', 'twenty-day', 'coma', 'find', 'mentally', 'active', 'physically', 'paralyzed', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'wherewithal', 'write', 'poignant', 'elegant', 'memoir', 'blink', 'eye', 'astounding', 'did', 'publication', 'date', 'book', 'was', 'mere', 'two', 'days', 'death', '1997', 'someone', 'painter/filmmaker', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Night', 'Falls', 'visual', 'flair', 'bring', 'fragile', 'empowering', 'story', 'cinematic', 'life', 'screenwriter', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'Pianist', 'done', 'compelling', 'job', 'translating', 'Bauby', 'book', 'highly', 'charged', 'story', 'Schnabel', 'bold', 'filmmaking', 'choices.The', '2007', 'film', 'Bauby', 'known', 'Jean-Do', 'friends', 'slipping', 'consciousness', 'slowly', 'realizing', 'faculties', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'doctors', 'first', 'half-hour', 'shows', 'only', 'Bauby', 'viewpoint', 'thoughts', 'articulated', 'interior', 'monologue', 'shared', 'viewer', 'intentionally', 'constricted', 'technique', 'Schnabel', 'effectively', 'convey', 'Bauby', 'helpless', 'state', 'Four', 'women', 'play', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'road', 'least', 'partial', 'recovery', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Henriette', 'who', 'blinking', 'technique', 'communicate', 'physiotherapist', 'Marie', 'who', 'series', 'tongue', 'exercises', 'Bauby', 'off', 'hilariously', 'profane', 'thoughts', 'estranged', 'partner', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'who', 'bore', 'raised', 'three', 'children', 'now', 'willing', 'take', 'role', 'caretaker', 'finally', 'Claude', 'editor', 'who', 'come', 'take', 'dictation', 'book', 'Bauby', 'promised', 'publisher', 'stroke', 'encounters', 'are', 'intertwined', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'flashbacks', 'where', 'see', 'fully', 'functional', 'Bauby', 'are', 'excellent', 'couple', 'scenes', 'Bauby', 'curmudgeonly', 'father', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'son', 'father', 'how', 'vibrant', 'flawed', 'Bauby', 'was', 'paralysis.The', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'beginning', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'informant', 'Louis', 'Steven', ""Spielberg'sMunich"", 'Bauby', 'powerful', 'unsentimental', 'performance', 'exalted', 'levels', 'achieved', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'inMy', 'Left', 'Footand', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'inThe', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'French', 'actor', 'conveys', 'fertile', 'brain', 'work', 'vibrant', 'man', 'been', 'forcibly', 'left', 'behind', 'Amalric', 'also', 'how', 'human-sized', 'character', 'philanderer', 'who', 'still', 'engender', 'devotion', 'closest', 'actresses', 'playing', 'women', 'Marie-Jos', 'eacute', 'Croze', 'Olatz', 'Lopez', 'Garmendia', 'Schnabel', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Anne', 'Consigny', '-are', 'all', 'strong', 'bit', 'interchangeable', 'legendary', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Bauby', 'homebound', 'father', 'masterful', 'work', 'Spielberg', 'longtime', 'cinematographer', 'Janusz', 'Kami', 'ntilde', 'latest', 'work', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'seamlessly', 'alternating', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'narrative.It', 'remarkable', 'film', 'surface', 'focus', 'traumatic', 'effects', 'sensory', 'deprivation', 'triumph', 'eloquent', 'soul', 'yearning', 'share', 'life', 'often', 'harsh', 'lessons', 'world', 'Four', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'included', '2008', 'DVD', 'first', 'standard', 'thirteen-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Submerged', 'Making', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'featuring', 'principal', 'cast', 'crew', 'share', 'thoughts', 'production', 'Schnabel', 'direction', 'second', 'shorter', 'A', 'Cinematic', 'Vision', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'convey', 'Bauby', 'first-person', 'point', 'view', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'twenty-minute', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'interview', 'Schnabel', '2007', 'out', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'informative', 'director', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'Schnabel', 'disappointingly', 'reticent', 'observations', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'have', 'someone', 'Amalric', 'Harwood', 'available', 'prompt', 'greater', 'insights', 'Regardless', 'fine', 'package', 'such', 'accomplished', 'film', 'way', 'diving', 'bell', 'title', 'refers', 'Bauby', 'horrendous', 'physical', 'limitations', 'butterfly', 'fertile', 'imagination']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

A film adaptation of the bestselling memoir of a French fashion magazine editor who becomes completely paralyzed except for the ability to blink one eye, through which he dictates his entire book.The film has had critics in rapture, and although the New Yorker's admirably over-the-top praise, ""It feels like nothing less than the rebirth of the cinema,"" (which New York Magazine called ""the blurbiest blurb that ever blurbed"") goes a bit far, it's easy to see what they mean. Diving Bell uses the camera in such a fresh way that you feel practically engulfed by a new medium, something beyond mere film. Not content to rely on camera tricks, the film surprisingly fires on practically all other cylinders: impeccable French acting, a painter's obsession with original imagery, and a rockin', rollin' soundtrack.

1124135,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B00104QSOC,e. verrillo,"[27, 34]","This was, by all accounts, a stunning film.  The photography was sensitive, beautiful, evocative, as was the acting.  Had I not read the book I would have loved it. But, I did read the book, and out of respect for a man who made an effort which can only be described as superhuman, I simply cannot recommend this film.Jean-Dominigue Bauby, former editor-in-chief of Elle Magazine, was struck down in the prime of life by a massive stroke which left him completely paralyzed, but conscious.  Personally, I cannot imagine a worse fate.  Once he emerged from his coma, Bauby was faced with the knowledge that he was trapped inside the ""diving bell"", his own personal prison.  It was only through the concerted efforts of his  his inner circle of friends and his speech therapist, who devised a method through which he could communicate to the outside world by blinking his left eyelid,  that Bauby was able to survive the horrors of his half life--and, indeed, overcome them.Where the movie fails, and fails horribly, is in telling the truth. The movie version was clearly based primarily on input from Bauby's ex, the mother of his two children. (Why Schnabel felt compelled to add a third child is beyond me, as it added nothing to the story.) If you watch the film, you will weep at his ex's devotion, shudder at the rejection of his girlfriend, be touched by Bauby's deep remorse about how badly he treated his loyal ex--none of which conforms to reality.The true story, the one you can read in Bauby's book, is far more touching.  Bauby's ""personal bodyguard"", those who cared for him tenderly every day, did not include his ex, whom he only mentions once in his book.  It did however, include his girlfriend, who certainly did not reject him, and in whose arms Bauby died.  (It was clear from these distortions of reality that Bauby's ex had a vengeful streak.) But, more importantly, the most powerful loves of Bauby's life were his two children, with whom he shared a deeply loving relationship.  (In one key scene from the book, unfortunately ommitted from the movie, Bauby's daughter climbs into his lap and repeats over and over again, ""You are my daddy."")Aside from maligning the people Bauby genuinely loved, the film also misprepresented Bauby himself.  The author of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly was not prone to self-pity.  Not once did he express the desire to die. Nor did he have sexual fantasies about the women who were helping him. (French directors really need to give ""cherchez la femme"" a rest.) Instead, what Bauby wrote about, and what he has to offer the rest of us, was an indomitable spirit, a courage that defies words. Though he was trapped in the prison of his body, Bauby was able to draw upon the most poetic, the most profound insights in order to create a memoir that is honest without being self-indulgent.Ultimately, I believe that the film did Bauby a grave injustice.  Bauby went to such heroic lengths to communicate, the least Schnabel could have done would have been to respect the words Bauby labored so hard to produce. I would encourage everyone to read Bauby's memoir.  It is deeply moving and much more inspiring than the film. And it's the real thing.",2,A beautifully made film which did not do justice to the story...,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,3203,"['was', 'accounts', 'stunning', 'film', 'photography', 'was', 'sensitive', 'beautiful', 'evocative', 'was', 'acting', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'did', 'read', 'book', 'respect', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'effort', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'superhuman', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film.Jean-Dominigue', 'Bauby', 'former', 'editor-in-chief', 'Elle', 'Magazine', 'was', 'struck', 'down', 'prime', 'life', 'massive', 'stroke', 'left', 'completely', 'paralyzed', 'conscious', 'Personally', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'worse', 'fate', 'Once', 'emerged', 'coma', 'Bauby', 'was', 'faced', 'knowledge', 'was', 'trapped', 'diving', 'bell', 'own', 'personal', 'prison', 'was', 'only', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'inner', 'circle', 'friends', 'speech', 'therapist', 'who', 'devised', 'method', 'could', 'communicate', 'outside', 'world', 'blinking', 'left', 'eyelid', 'Bauby', 'was', 'able', 'survive', 'horrors', 'half', 'life', 'indeed', 'them.Where', 'movie', 'horribly', 'telling', 'truth', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'clearly', 'based', 'primarily', 'input', 'Bauby', 'ex', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'Why', 'Schnabel', 'felt', 'compelled', 'add', 'third', 'child', 'added', 'nothing', 'story', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'weep', 'ex', 'devotion', 'shudder', 'rejection', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'touched', 'Bauby', 'deep', 'remorse', 'how', 'badly', 'treated', 'loyal', 'ex', 'none', 'conforms', 'reality.The', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'Bauby', 'book', 'far', 'more', 'touching', 'Bauby', 'personal', 'bodyguard', 'who', 'cared', 'tenderly', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'ex', 'whom', 'only', 'once', 'book', 'did', 'however', 'include', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'reject', 'arms', 'Bauby', 'died', 'was', 'clear', 'distortions', 'reality', 'Bauby', 'ex', 'had', 'vengeful', 'streak', 'more', 'importantly', 'most', 'powerful', 'loves', 'Bauby', 'life', 'were', 'two', 'children', 'whom', 'shared', 'deeply', 'loving', 'relationship', 'one', 'key', 'scene', 'book', 'unfortunately', 'ommitted', 'movie', 'Bauby', 'daughter', 'climbs', 'lap', 'repeats', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'daddy', 'Aside', 'maligning', 'people', 'Bauby', 'genuinely', 'loved', 'film', 'also', 'misprepresented', 'Bauby', 'author', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'was', 'not', 'prone', 'self-pity', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'express', 'desire', 'die', 'did', 'have', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'helping', 'French', 'directors', 'really', 'need', 'give', 'cherchez', 'la', 'femme', 'rest', 'Instead', 'what', 'Bauby', 'wrote', 'what', 'offer', 'rest', 'was', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'courage', 'words', 'was', 'trapped', 'prison', 'body', 'Bauby', 'was', 'able', 'draw', 'most', 'poetic', 'most', 'profound', 'insights', 'order', 'create', 'memoir', 'honest', 'being', 'self-indulgent.Ultimately', 'believe', 'film', 'did', 'Bauby', 'grave', 'injustice', 'Bauby', 'went', 'such', 'heroic', 'lengths', 'communicate', 'least', 'Schnabel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'respect', 'words', 'Bauby', 'labored', 'so', 'hard', 'produce', 'would', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'read', 'Bauby', 'memoir', 'deeply', 'moving', 'much', 'more', 'inspiring', 'film', 'real', 'thing']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

In 'Le Scaphandre et le papillon' ('The Diving Bell and the Butterfly') he has transformed the memoir of Jean-Dominique Bauby (with the sensitive screen adaptation by Ronald Harwood) into an experience for the mind and the heart.  It is an extraordinary blend of visual effects, poetry, exquisite acting, and the perseverance of the human mind to communicate with the world when all seeming variations of communication are stripped away.Jean-Dominique (Jean-Do)  Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) was the editor of the French magazine 'Elle', living with the beautiful C&eacute;line Desmoulins (Emmanuelle Seigner) and their three children, when during a ride with his son he has a massive stroke that leaves him completely paralyzed (the 'locked-in syndrome'). When he awakens from his coma he is able to hear and to see but he cannot speak or move, except for his eyes.  From this point we, the audience, experience the world as through the eyes of Jean-Do, share his frustrations of being unable to speak, and in his ultimately having to communicate through the fine skills of his speech therapist Henriette Durand (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze) by blinking his eye once or twice for yes or no as each letter of the alphabet is spoken - an arduous task for both patient and visitor. He decides he wants to write his memoirs and Claude (Anne Consigny) is assigned to take his 'dictation'.  The only faculties Jean-Do retains are his memory and his fantasies, and it is through the acting out of these that we discover the victim's private and secret life as well as his relationships to colleagues and lovers and family.  He imagines the hospital where he is confined in the time of Nijinsky (Nicolas Le Riche) and Empress Eug&eacute;nie (Emma de Caunes) and filters the realities of his life through the interactions with his comrades Laurent (Isaach De Bankol&eacute;) and others as well as vivid memories of his relationship with his father Papinou Bauby (Max von Sydow).  With the patient assistance of the health providers, friends and family he is able to complete his memoir, the story of a man locked in a diving bell longing for the freedom of a butterfly, released form its cocoon. .Getting used to the film technique Schnabel uses takes patience, but for those who are willing to accept the pace of the film, rich with fantasy and historical sequences, the impact is not only compelling but breathtaking.  This telling of a true story is a fine work from all concerned and for this viewer it is one of the best films of recent years.

It is almost a cliche to talk about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity, but here it is, in frame after frame, but without any sense that the director and screewriter are being didactic and pounding home a message. The credit for adapting this film should go to both writer Ronald Harwood and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who bring to cinematic life a very cerebral story. The voice-over narrative, which can be so annoying in so many films, becomes an aspect of the character, giving us Bauby's perspective of being locked in - perfectly capable of thinking but completely incapable of verbally expressing those thoughts, except by blinking. Schanbel and Harwood could have ""cheated"" - prsenting Bauby as the victim of a stroke and then using flashbacks to show the events leading up to the stroke, but they take the much more difficult approach of keeping the film rooted in the present and dealing cinematically with the handicap, making spare use of flashbacks effectively. This is particularly true of the flashback involving Bauby's father (the great Max von Sydow), which sets the tone for the heart-wrenching scene in which the father, an invalid confined to his apartment calls the son, an invalid confined to the hospital.

In spite of his extreme limitations (he can only blink one eye) he manages to take us on a tour of a life spent in carousing and indifferent relationships. The irony is of a man of fashion and freedom, now festooned with a drooping face, ridiculous glasses, wool cap and an old woman's shawl. The levels of pain that he feels are exquisite, especially from well-meaning friends who attempt to console him with their own stories of confinement. But the viewer's sympathies are tempered by the pain that Bauby is still capable of inflicting on others, especially the mother of his children.""Diving Bell"" is often funny. A couple of rude telephone workmen make fun of him, and Bauby laughs uproariously (in his own mind) at their crudity. Bauby's story is not quite a story of inspiration, but of determination to be heard - to regain a measure of the complex and cultured man he once was. This is both a triumph and a tragedy - an enormous effort by a man whose spirit has hardly been touched by his infirmity. A subtle, engaging and sometimes disturbing film.

1124152,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00104QSOC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Based on a true story, remarkably, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a French film by an American director based on the memoir of Frenchman Jean-Dominique Bauby. Released in 2007, this film was one of the most highly acclaimed films of that particular year...In its own gentle way; I have no doubt that it was one of the best films of 2007. The script is by Ronald Harwood, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Pianist and while it's most certainly a terrific script, it's the style of the film that really trumps everything else.Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) awakes to find he's paralyzed from head-to-toe and unable to speak. The doctor's tell him he has ""locked-in syndrome,"" making him a prisoner in his own body. He is aware of his surroundings and is able to think perfectly clearly, but is unable to move anything except his left eye. As we learn about Bauby's life before the stroke that took his abilities to move or speak, we also watch as therapists develop a painstaking process for him to be able to communicate thoroughly using only his left eye. Obviously, Bauby would go on to write a book using this process which can imagine would take a superhuman amount of patience.Amalric's performance is remarkable, a performance of both control and dedication. In flashbacks, Amalric is required to play a charming, successful young man and the paralyzed Bauby, he's not allowed much room for acting. Somehow, Amalric adds remarkable personality to his character. The great Max Von Sydow has a small, yet powerful role as Bauby's father and Emmanuelle Seigner brings a strong-willed female to the screen as the mother of Bauby's children.When one simply gives a synopsis of the film, it sounds like a rather conventional ""against all odds"" type of story. Julian Schnabel deserves all the credit, as he has crafted a film that's not afraid to defy convention. Much of what we see in the film is directly from Bauby's perspective, which gives the film a unique visual feel but could have also become uncomfortable and detrimental to telling the story. Schnabel is no amateur and uses this style to educate, while never forgetting that he's telling a story that he should want an audience to sit through. With Schnabel at the helm of this picture, what could have been a semi-sequel to My Left Foot (entitled My Left Eye) is instead a moving, special film with moments that can only be described as cinematic poetry.There's no film that I can think of that closely resembles this one. It's unique, beautiful, and has made a rather remarkable impression on me. Even those who are biased against foreign films (because reading sucks apparently) may find themselves unexpectedly enraptured by this one. It's visually stunning, poetic, and powerful with a life-affirming story at the heart of it.GRADE: A-",5,"A Beautiful, Poetic Film",1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2819,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'remarkably', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'French', 'film', 'American', 'director', 'based', 'memoir', 'Frenchman', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'Released', '2007', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'films', 'particular', 'year', 'own', 'gentle', 'way', 'have', 'doubt', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007', 'script', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenwriter', 'Pianist', 'most', 'certainly', 'terrific', 'script', 'style', 'film', 'really', 'everything', 'else.Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'find', 'paralyzed', 'head-to-toe', 'unable', 'speak', 'doctor', 'tell', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'making', 'prisoner', 'own', 'body', 'aware', 'surroundings', 'able', 'think', 'perfectly', 'clearly', 'unable', 'move', 'anything', 'left', 'eye', 'learn', 'Bauby', 'life', 'stroke', 'took', 'abilities', 'move', 'speak', 'also', 'watch', 'therapists', 'develop', 'painstaking', 'process', 'be', 'able', 'communicate', 'thoroughly', 'using', 'only', 'left', 'eye', 'Obviously', 'Bauby', 'would', 'go', 'write', 'book', 'using', 'process', 'can', 'imagine', 'would', 'take', 'superhuman', 'amount', 'patience.Amalric', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'control', 'dedication', 'flashbacks', 'Amalric', 'required', 'play', 'charming', 'successful', 'young', 'man', 'paralyzed', 'Bauby', 'not', 'allowed', 'much', 'room', 'acting', 'Somehow', 'Amalric', 'remarkable', 'personality', 'character', 'great', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'small', 'yet', 'powerful', 'role', 'Bauby', 'father', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'strong-willed', 'female', 'screen', 'mother', 'Bauby', 'children.When', 'one', 'simply', 'synopsis', 'film', 'rather', 'conventional', 'odds', 'type', 'story', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'credit', 'crafted', 'film', 'not', 'afraid', 'defy', 'convention', 'Much', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'directly', 'Bauby', 'perspective', 'film', 'unique', 'visual', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'become', 'uncomfortable', 'detrimental', 'telling', 'story', 'Schnabel', 'amateur', 'style', 'educate', 'never', 'forgetting', 'telling', 'story', 'should', 'want', 'audience', 'sit', 'Schnabel', 'helm', 'picture', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'semi-sequel', 'My', 'Left', 'Foot', 'entitled', 'My', 'Left', 'Eye', 'instead', 'moving', 'special', 'film', 'moments', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'cinematic', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'closely', 'one', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'made', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'impression', 'Even', 'who', 'are', 'biased', 'foreign', 'films', 'reading', 'sucks', 'apparently', 'may', 'find', 'unexpectedly', 'enraptured', 'one', 'visually', 'stunning', 'poetic', 'powerful', 'life-affirming', 'story', 'heart', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

Schnabel does not capture only the mind of a middle-aged man ""locked-in"" into his head, but also the microscosmos of people who raised, loved and took care of him after the incapacitating stroke. These people, and the French rehabilitation system,  are very much central to the film as the American spectator watches - sometimes a bit enviously - the care and attention to personal dignity that epitomizes French healthcare.Anyway. The film is brilliant. Schnabel creates suspense by masterfully introducing elements into the story (Bauby's comprehension that he is not heard; his face; his family). The real & imagined, dreams & fantasy, memory and real-time are mixed together seamlessly. While the director does not want to shield the spectator from the empathic pain, he also shows a man who - having lost the ability to move everything but his eye muscles, also kept his sense of humor and sarcasm, and his talent for hurting those close to him. The last scene where the wife picks up the telephone call from the mistress for whom Bauby left his family is  heartbreaking. The scene where they are suturing his eyelids is profoundly painful.The actors are superb, including the women in main supporting roles. Camera: brilliant.

1124155,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B00104QSOC,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[7, 11]","Jean-Dominique Bauby was living the life most people would want to live. He was a successful magazine editor, he had a children that loved him, and women were at his disposal. Then he suffered from a stroke and developed what doctors labeled as locked-in syndrome. For those unaware, locked-in syndrome is a disease that renders the patient almost completely paralyzed, and it's been described as feeling like the victim is buried alive. Bauby winds up in this condition, unable to do anything except move and blink his left eye. While the state of his health gives him great grief, Bauby would eventually pull himself out of depression and write a memoir of his life entitled ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" which has now been made into a great movie. And yes; it's a disease movie.Unlike most disease movies though, where we see the character deteriorating in front of our eyes, the movie begins from the perspective of our protagonist, and stays with that perspective for most of the film. Only when Bauby decides to be grateful for his life do we get to see the world through everyone else's eyes. Another thing that's worth noting: Because we see the world through Bauby's point of view, the movie may make you feel queasy at the beginning. Stick with it though, because wonderful images are not far behind. Though he can only move his eye, as he monologues ""aside from my eye, the only things that are free are my memories and my imagination."" As if to prove his point, when he gets sick of his restaurant food, he simply pictures himself eating at one of his favorite restaurants with a beautiful woman by his side.At times he pictures himself as a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon that holds him prisoner and exploring the world and it's wondrous beauties. Some people may criticize that these wonderful images may glorify the disease, but I disagree. Not every person takes getting sick sitting down. While some do accept their fate and prepare for death, others do the best they can with what little health they have left. I think this movie does a great job at making this clear, that while Bauby is a prisoner of his own body, he is also freed from his chains and, in a strange way, may be truly appreciating life for the first time in his life.Though there have been many movies made of various diseases, I think this is one of the few I've seen that gives the audience a deep understanding of what it's truly like to have to live with it. For most of the film you feel as trapped as Baudy is. Some people even left the theater. Yet it's also one of the more inspiring movies of the year, with a touching message and a deep understanding of it's characters and subject matter. Directed brilliantly by Julian Schnabel, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterflies"" is one of the best films of the year. Not only is it one of the best films of the year, chances are you will be taking a hard look at your own life when it is finished, and you may even feel grateful for the life you do have.Rating: **** and 1/2 stars",4,Untrapped Imagination,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,3030,"['Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'was', 'living', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'live', 'was', 'successful', 'magazine', 'editor', 'had', 'children', 'loved', 'women', 'were', 'disposal', 'Then', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'developed', 'what', 'doctors', 'labeled', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'unaware', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'disease', 'patient', 'almost', 'completely', 'paralyzed', 'been', 'described', 'feeling', 'victim', 'buried', 'alive', 'Bauby', 'up', 'condition', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'move', 'blink', 'left', 'eye', 'state', 'health', 'great', 'grief', 'Bauby', 'would', 'eventually', 'pull', 'depression', 'write', 'memoir', 'life', 'entitled', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'now', 'been', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'yes', 'disease', 'movie.Unlike', 'most', 'disease', 'movies', 'where', 'see', 'character', 'deteriorating', 'front', 'eyes', 'movie', 'perspective', 'protagonist', 'stays', 'perspective', 'most', 'film', 'Only', 'when', 'Bauby', 'be', 'grateful', 'life', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'world', 'everyone', 'else', 'eyes', 'thing', 'worth', 'noting', 'see', 'world', 'Bauby', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'may', 'make', 'feel', 'queasy', 'beginning', 'Stick', 'wonderful', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'can', 'only', 'move', 'eye', 'aside', 'eye', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'free', 'are', 'memories', 'imagination', 'prove', 'point', 'when', 'sick', 'restaurant', 'food', 'simply', 'eating', 'one', 'favorite', 'restaurants', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'side.At', 'times', 'butterfly', 'breaking', 'cocoon', 'prisoner', 'exploring', 'world', 'wondrous', 'beauties', 'people', 'may', 'criticize', 'wonderful', 'images', 'may', 'glorify', 'disease', 'disagree', 'Not', 'person', 'getting', 'sick', 'sitting', 'down', 'do', 'accept', 'fate', 'prepare', 'death', 'others', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'little', 'health', 'have', 'left', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'clear', 'Bauby', 'prisoner', 'own', 'body', 'also', 'freed', 'chains', 'strange', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciating', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'life.Though', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'made', 'various', 'diseases', 'think', 'one', 'few', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'audience', 'deep', 'understanding', 'what', 'truly', 'like', 'have', 'live', 'most', 'film', 'feel', 'as', 'trapped', 'Baudy', 'people', 'even', 'left', 'theater', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'inspiring', 'movies', 'year', 'touching', 'message', 'deep', 'understanding', 'characters', 'subject', 'matter', 'Directed', 'brilliantly', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterflies', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'hard', 'look', 'own', 'life', 'when', 'finished', 'may', 'even', 'feel', 'grateful', 'life', 'do', 'have.Rating', '****', '1/2', 'stars']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

1124162,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00104QSOC,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[27, 38]","Julian Schnabel is a fine artist who paints fantastical, brilliant, almost violent works. His films though are another story. ""Basquiat,"" ""When Night Falls"" and now ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" deal almost exclusively with a man, an artist living within society as a whole but nonetheless living apart from it. Within the context of Schnabel's movie world and by extension his characters, this living apart is natural, is organic to these characters. Their talent, their world vision sets them apart.In Schnabel's poetic, sad, urgent ""When Night Falls"" Javier Bardem plays Cuban writer, Reinaldo Arenas: a man both reviled by society and beloved by his reading public. Bardem is bigger than life, makes his mark upon this film as well upon our psyche and our memory. The same can be said about the terrific Jeffrey Wright in ""Basquiat"" and now Mathieu Amalric as Jean-Dominique Bauby in Schnabel's new ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.""Before his massive stroke, Bauby was the editor of French Elle and Schnabel gives us glimpses of Bauby's glamorous, jet-setting life. There is no doubt that Schnabel feels for Bauby and his condition: a condition which allows Bauby to literally move only one eye lid though Bauby nonetheless manages through a letter recognition system to write his memoir on which this film is based. In several ways though, we get the feeling that Schnabel, through the use of a judicious choice of ""before stroke"" images, that Schnabel is not always on Bauby's side and that Bauby's current state is a result of his former, hedonistic life style. Editing a glossy woman's magazine does not have the intellectual cache of a brilliant writer or of a brilliant artist and I can't shake the feeling that Schnabel may be more than a bit prejudiced against Bauby here.The beginning of ""TDBATB"" is very difficult to get into: all bleached out images, fluttering butterflies and ""talking head,"" reassuring nurses and serious doctors. It is off-putting to say the least: Schnabel at his most arty and least coherent. Then something happens and we begin to get into the groove of Schnabel's vision and world. Schnabel and his writer Ronald Harwood are skirting a slippery slope here: how do you humanize, how do you make human a person who is only marginally those things? You do it, as Schnabel and Harwood do: you show us that Bauby, though horrifically compromised, has a huge intellect still working at maximum capacity inside that hunk of flesh.It is ironic and effective that Schnabel has chosen the most frenetic and active of French actors to play this role: Mathieu Amalric...so good in ""Kings and Queen."" Amalric does what he can with the post massive stroke portions of the film to convey humanity but it is in the pre-stroke scenes that he really shines: all ""French"" handsome, charming and intelligent this Bauby.""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is a tough nut to crack and many times you are torn between walking out and downright sobbing but at a certain point towards the middle of the film, Schnabel gets you, keeps you and won't let you go.

1124163,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00104QSOC,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[1, 1]","One thing that can be said about Julian Schnabel's ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" is that it is a beautifully rendered view with the depths aplomb of human experience leaving the viewer with hope.  It's an important flick, one I think the majority should experiece.  My opinion here, who's else?If you try to explain this flick to friends, on the surface, it may be a difficult sell.  Hey dude, watch this here flick.  It's about another dude who is the magazine editor big shot and he like has a stroke.  He comes outta his coma and like can't move much, just his eyes.  So hot ladies frequent his room and help him like write this book  One of the ladies is in love with the blinkin' guy.  So well, he dies.  You really gotta watch this dude!  C what I mean?Jean-Dominique Bauby (played deftly by Mathieu Amalric), the French Elle editor lived an amazing life, but one that had greatest impact while he was in a hospital on the coast of France and had the time to pour his heart out in writing.  Amalric's performance is nothing short of spell-binding as he does more with the expression behind one eye and a half-downturned lip than others do with their whole face and whole body.  Watch the ""making of"" extra on the DVD to hear all about how Amalric approached the role.Max Von Sydow appears here as Bauby's father and turns in, as would be expected, a uniquely powerful performance.  The film is probably a bunch of things to different people but the strength of it for me lay in the development of the relationship between Bauby and his father.  ""Today is Father's Day. Until my stroke, we had felt no need to fit this made-up holiday into our emotional calendar. But today we spend the whole of the symbolic day together, affirming that even a rough sketch, a shadow, a tiny fragment of a dad is still a dad,"" says Bauby and accurately reflects the progression and the need for the Father-Son relationship here.  Bauby, the parapeligic and already caring son, parallels his Father's experience as an ailing man who can't get around so well anymore.  The two need each other like they haven't before previously in their lives.  The development and progression of the relationship is life-affirming, I beleive.This flick will make you wanna watch it or better yet buy the DVD as a gift for dear 'ole Dad this Father's Day.  Though Bauby teaches us there may still be time left in this life to live out your dreams, he also teaches us that you better carpe diem-style; because the the way you are, in your present condition, is never a given...tomorrow.  Not for one single instant.  Live those dreams.

1124174,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B00104QSOC,Pristine,"[2, 3]","My earliest memory of Julian Schnabel are of mural-sized paintings, and photographs of the artist, topless, standing on windswept beaches. When his other films Basquiat and When Night Falls came out, I was hoping to see how he would translate it on to the screen.  Everything I expected from those previous films is present in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly where a pedestrian filmgoer like myself, can clearly detect the wonderful vista in the mind of an artist's eye.  The electronically-tinted tidewater glaciers breaking off in slow motion, majestically to Bach's Concerto for Piano BWV 1056 Adagio is an absolute delight.  Long hair blowing in an open-top convertible, the setting sun on the surface of a person's face.  These are things that keep one's interior warm and alive.And speaking of the eye, Mathieu Amalric has the most difficult job in the world: acting an entire movie with one eyeball.  He succeeds with one dilated eye, anxiously bursting to free itself from the paralyzed body in which it belongs.  Although Emmanuelle Seigner is featured on the cover, the real treat is Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze as the therapist.  Croze is one of those actors who, like Amanda Plummer, has such total command of her face, she can make one dimple twist a certain way while an eyebrow moves another way, combining a facial expression that is constantly shifting, with complex emotions subtlely underlined.  Anne Consigny as the stoic and handsome assistant gives that one working eye a good reason to open up each morning.  If one were to pick actors for the many classical Bergman facial shots in this film, the ones presented here were excellent choices.At first, The Diving Bell and The Butterfly reminded me of Johnny Got His Gun.  After a while, like the incantation of the lettering system (""E,S,A,R,I,N...."") the story comes into its own, developing its unique visual vocabulary and rhythm.  Like the most frequently-used letters, our protagonist draws on his most meaningful memories and imaginative fragments to help him construct a viable reason to exist and recuperate.  It's almost a play on the phrase ""do I have to spell it out for you?"" as we often see, from within the patient/narrator, that you can assemble letters into words, and then words into sentences, and yet, what is really going on inside your head, cannot always be translated.",5,What May Be Going On Inside the Mind of Julian Schnabel,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,2362,"['earliest', 'memory', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'are', 'mural-sized', 'paintings', 'photographs', 'artist', 'topless', 'standing', 'windswept', 'beaches', 'When', 'other', 'films', 'Basquiat', 'When', 'Night', 'Falls', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'translate', 'screen', 'Everything', 'expected', 'previous', 'films', 'present', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'where', 'pedestrian', 'filmgoer', 'can', 'clearly', 'detect', 'wonderful', 'vista', 'mind', 'artist', 'eye', 'electronically-tinted', 'tidewater', 'glaciers', 'breaking', 'off', 'slow', 'motion', 'majestically', 'Bach', 'Concerto', 'Piano', 'BWV', '1056', 'Adagio', 'absolute', 'delight', 'Long', 'hair', 'blowing', 'open-top', 'convertible', 'setting', 'sun', 'surface', 'person', 'face', 'are', 'things', 'keep', 'one', 'interior', 'warm', 'alive.And', 'speaking', 'eye', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'most', 'difficult', 'job', 'world', 'acting', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'eyeball', 'one', 'dilated', 'eye', 'anxiously', 'bursting', 'free', 'paralyzed', 'body', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'featured', 'cover', 'real', 'treat', 'Marie-Jos', 'eacute', 'Croze', 'therapist', 'Croze', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'such', 'total', 'command', 'face', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'dimple', 'twist', 'certain', 'way', 'eyebrow', 'way', 'combining', 'facial', 'expression', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'complex', 'emotions', 'subtlely', 'underlined', 'Anne', 'Consigny', 'stoic', 'handsome', 'assistant', 'one', 'working', 'eye', 'good', 'reason', 'open', 'up', 'morning', 'one', 'were', 'pick', 'actors', 'many', 'classical', 'Bergman', 'facial', 'shots', 'film', 'ones', 'presented', 'here', 'were', 'excellent', 'choices.At', 'first', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'reminded', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'while', 'incantation', 'lettering', 'system', 'E', 'S', 'A', 'R', 'N', 'story', 'own', 'developing', 'unique', 'visual', 'vocabulary', 'rhythm', 'most', 'frequently-used', 'letters', 'protagonist', 'draws', 'most', 'meaningful', 'memories', 'imaginative', 'fragments', 'help', 'construct', 'viable', 'reason', 'exist', 'recuperate', 'almost', 'play', 'phrase', 'do', 'have', 'spell', 'out', 'often', 'see', 'patient/narrator', 'can', 'assemble', 'letters', 'words', 'then', 'words', 'sentences', 'yet', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'translated']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

I was even reluctant to play the DVD and told myself I'd just start it and if it was too heavy I'd stop it.  However I was engaged immediately and watched it intently till the end.Yes, the subject is unbelievably difficult.  It is a true story--no one would make anything like this up!  And yet it is told in such a way that, if anything, it is inspiring.  First I was very touched by the devotion of the staff--especially the three young women who help him with such passion and purity. They are all quite beautiful, too!  Then, the mother of his children, who was no longer his lover, came and gave him the same type of love and care.  Calling out the letters of the alphabet while watching his eye for a blink is a painstakingly slow process and certainly is a labor of love.  She even transmitted his  message to his lover, which was certainly a hard thing for her to do.It was all of this amazing care that brought the spirit of the film up from being horribly depressing to one of hope.  Yes, it was amazing that Bauby eventually came out of his hopelessness and self-pity to write the book---that is the main point of the story.  But I haven't seen much comment on the love that was poured out on this man...from bouquets of roses, to a birthday party from the staff, to calls and cards and visits from friends and family.  And, as another person commented, the quality of care from the French National Health Service bears notice; this was not a private clinic for the very wealthy--it was a public hospital.  wow!A couple of reviewers made the point that not enough of Bauby's pre-stroke life was shown and I do agree with that.  We saw that he was a very successfuly bon vivant type, living the good life in Paris, but I do wonder about his character.  The voice over said that he had failed to love any of the women he'd been with, although it was obvious that he got them to love him.  Was he just superficial or a bit of a cad?  Perhaps, since the film's script was drawn from Bauby's book, that aspect of the story was never told.  Or maybe the film maker decided not to hit us over the head with it.At any rate the story is an amazing one, certainly one that deserves to be told.  And it was beautifully told in a way that avoids cheap sentimentality.  I urge anyone who is interested in the human condition to see the film--it will be a rewarding experience.(I read somewhere that Johnny Depp had been considered to play Dauby and I think that he would have been a great improvement over the French actor.)",5,"Amazing story, beautifully told",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2622,"['did', ""n't"", 'rush', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'depressing', 'was', 'even', 'reluctant', 'play', 'DVD', 'told', ""'d"", 'just', 'start', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', ""'d"", 'stop', 'However', 'was', 'engaged', 'immediately', 'watched', 'intently', 'end.Yes', 'subject', 'unbelievably', 'difficult', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'anything', 'up', 'yet', 'told', 'such', 'way', 'anything', 'inspiring', 'First', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'devotion', 'staff', 'especially', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'help', 'such', 'passion', 'purity', 'are', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'too', 'Then', 'mother', 'children', 'who', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'lover', 'came', 'gave', 'same', 'type', 'love', 'care', 'Calling', 'out', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'watching', 'eye', 'blink', 'painstakingly', 'slow', 'process', 'certainly', 'labor', 'love', 'even', 'transmitted', 'message', 'lover', 'was', 'certainly', 'hard', 'thing', 'do.It', 'was', 'amazing', 'care', 'brought', 'spirit', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'horribly', 'depressing', 'one', 'hope', 'Yes', 'was', 'amazing', 'Bauby', 'eventually', 'came', 'hopelessness', 'self-pity', 'write', 'book', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'comment', 'love', 'was', 'poured', 'out', 'man', 'bouquets', 'roses', 'birthday', 'party', 'staff', 'calls', 'cards', 'visits', 'friends', 'family', 'person', 'commented', 'quality', 'care', 'French', 'National', 'Health', 'Service', 'notice', 'was', 'not', 'private', 'clinic', 'very', 'wealthy', 'was', 'public', 'hospital', 'wow', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'made', 'point', 'not', 'enough', 'Bauby', 'pre-stroke', 'life', 'was', 'shown', 'do', 'agree', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'successfuly', 'bon', 'vivant', 'type', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'Paris', 'do', 'wonder', 'character', 'voice', 'said', 'had', 'failed', 'love', 'women', ""'d"", 'been', 'was', 'obvious', 'got', 'love', 'Was', 'just', 'superficial', 'bit', 'cad', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'drawn', 'Bauby', 'book', 'aspect', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'told', 'maybe', 'film', 'maker', 'decided', 'not', 'hit', 'head', 'it.At', 'rate', 'story', 'amazing', 'one', 'certainly', 'one', 'be', 'told', 'was', 'beautifully', 'told', 'way', 'cheap', 'sentimentality', 'urge', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'human', 'condition', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'read', 'somewhere', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'had', 'been', 'considered', 'play', 'Dauby', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'improvement', 'French', 'actor']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

It is a story of French magazine ""Elle""'s editor who suffers a stroke that leaves him paralized so that only his left eye has any movement.  With the help of his physical and speach therapists he learns to communicate by blinking.  It is that way of communication that helped him create the book of the same title as this movie.  Film explores what it must be for a person to be locked inside his own body.  Completely aware of surroundings, conversations taking place, people around and yet unable to talk, move or even blow away the fly that is on his nose while he is helplessly strapped to his therapeutic table.  It takes full staff of doctores, therapists, nurses and nursing aides to feed, bathe and care for him around the clock.  In spite of the terrible affliction, we have reservations about this man who still seems selfish, sexist, insensitive to women who love him, not around his children enough.  But it seems that writing this autobiography was his life's legacy to not only his immediate family but world.  Stricken by stroke at age 42 he dies almost a year later only a few days after his book was published.

All three of these films end with death (as does every life). They all challenge us to see beauty and meaning where we're not accustomed to look for it. In American Beauty, we see beauty in a plastic bag dancing on the wind. In The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, we witness the true story of a man's journey to find beauty and meaning in a situation that at first glance appears to render life one long torture. We see how much meaning can be found in the simple ability to communicate, however impaired. In Barbarian Invasions we see a father and a son who never thought they had much to communicate about learn to find common ground. An old libertine, no longer able to indulge his appetites, finds (late, but not too late) that there is more to life. It is all summed up perfectly by Kevin Spacey's last words in American Beauty (a film that, on the surface, closes with an absurd death ending an absurd life, but when we look closer we see what these  words convey): ""It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life...

1124179,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00104QSOC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (Julian Schnabel, 2007)I have been convinced for the past seven years that Julian Schnabel, despite having (at the point) released only two films, is the best director currently working in America. Recently, we have seen a long-awaited third release, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly; while not quite as mind-shatteringly perfect as Before Night Falls, it does nothing to change my opinion of Schnabel's bottomless talent-- not necessarily because of what this film is, but because of what it is not.Based on Jean-Domonique Bauby's memoir of the same name, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly could, in the hands of a lesser director (and by ""lesser"" here I'm talking about the rest of the, say, top five percent of directors currently working in America), have been turned into a sappy, unwatchable mess suitable only for late-night screenings on the Lifetime Movie Network. After all, the subject matter is just this side of unfilmable-- it's a narrative by a man who suffered (Bauby died in 1997, ten days after the release of his book) from locked-in syndrome, a form of almost complete paralysis (Bauby dictated the book using only his left eyelid; the film goes into the mechanics of how this was done). In other words, our main character (played here by Mathieu Amalric) is, from the standpoint of someone trying to film the book, pretty much a lump, and the book is almost completely concerned with his thoughts and feelings. How do you film that? If you shift the perspective to those around him, you compromise the source material and open the way to Lifetime Movie-dom. But filming a guy lying in a bed for two hours? You're not going to have much of an audience.All these thoughts were swirling around in my head as I sat down to watch this movie. Dim the lights, chill the ham, roll film. It took me about thirty seconds to realize what Schnabel was up to, and the next half-hour to fully internalize it. My god, the balls this man has. The first half-hour, and most of the rest of the movie, is shot from Bauby's perspective. It's simple, it's obvious, and yet at the same time it's probably the gutsiest move, in a meta sense, I've seen a director make in years. We get some internal monologue (and most of that is for comic relief), but mostly it's just life from the perspective of someone who's really, really cheesed off at the unfairness. (Think The Sea Inside, but with a more, for lack of a better term, barbaric protagonist.)Needless to say, given this, the film, while stocked to the gills with fabulous performances from the supporting cast (who include, among others, Emanuelle Seigner and the great Max von Sydow), lives or dies on Amalric's performance. And he pulls it off brilliantly. I can't imagine the temptation he must have been under to overact at various points here, but he keeps it understated and subtle, even when most actors would've seen the character as having the screaming meemies. (There's a scene of minor surgery fifteen or twenty minutes into this film that will have you curled up in the fetal position in your seat gibbering helplessly.)Schnabel has finally gotten the Best Direction Oscar he's so richly deserved with his last two films, and that he certainly deserves here; no other movie I've seen in 2007 even comes close. Janusz Kaminski's sere, windswept cinematography has also gotten an Oscar nod, bot does anyone really expect Roger Deakins not to get the statue this year? Still, one can make a case for Kaminski, usually the stable cinematographer for Steven Spielberg; every outdoor shot in this is keyed to Bauby's outlook on life at the time he's in the shot. It's great stuff, very subtle, but lending the movie another level it would not otherwise have. (And the obligatory OH THE SYMBOLISM shots of which Schnabel is so fond are surprisingly easy to wrap your head around, and don't get too overbearing until the end credits; Kaminski did a fantastic job with this movie.)While I still haven't seen one of the films from last year everyone and his mother are raving about (There Will Be Blood), I can say that of the films I've seen that were released in 2007, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is far and away the best of them.

1124180,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00104QSOC,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY is one of the move moving films that I have seen in some time.  The film tells the true story of Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby's devastating stroke, which left his mental faculties completely unimpaired but left him physically unable to move apart from blinking his left eye.  The part of Bauby, or Jean-Do as he is called, was originally going to be played by Johnny Depp (he had to pull out because of conflicts with the PIRATES films), but as fine as he is as an actor it is hard to imagine that he would have been finer than Mathieu Amalric.  Though there are many flashback scenes where Amalric is able to use his entire body, most often he is able to do nothing but blink his eye.  Lines from T. S. Eliot kept running through my mind as I watched Amalric bring his character to life -- ""Paralyzed force, gesture without motion.""  Yet Amalric is able to bring a surprising amount of expressiveness to his role, partly aided by glasses that seem to magnify his right eye, the only part of his body that he is able to move.I have not read the book upon which the movie is based, a novel that was painstakingly dictated by Jean-Do as his aide would read out the alphabet and he would blink when she would reach the correct letter.  By any standard of human achievement, the writing of the book has to stand as one of the most remarkable accomplishments in our culture.  One can hardly imagine managing desiring to stay alive under such conditions, let alone write a book.The use of the camera is in the film is remarkable.  For quite a while at the beginning all camera work is from the first person, seeing pretty much what Jean-Do would have seen.  Once that first person perspective is broken it moves back and forth from that perspective to that of a disembodied outside observer.  Especially in moving from the flashback scenes to those of Jean-Do as a paralytic, the shifting in viewpoints reinforces the sense of his entrapment in his own body.The film further establishes Julian Schnabel as one of the finest filmmakers active today.  His resume is tiny, but all three of his feature films make for riveting viewing.  At the rate at which he works (his main career has been as a painter based out of New York), he make only get around to making 2 or 3 more films, but I'll be anxious to see anything and everything he makes.",5,"A brilliant, moving film",1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2371,"['DIVING', 'BELL', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'one', 'move', 'moving', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'Elle', 'editor', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'devastating', 'stroke', 'left', 'mental', 'faculties', 'completely', 'unimpaired', 'left', 'physically', 'unable', 'move', 'apart', 'blinking', 'left', 'eye', 'part', 'Bauby', 'Jean-Do', 'called', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'be', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'had', 'pull', 'out', 'conflicts', 'PIRATES', 'films', 'as', 'fine', 'actor', 'hard', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'finer', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'are', 'many', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'where', 'Amalric', 'able', 'use', 'entire', 'body', 'most', 'often', 'able', 'do', 'nothing', 'blink', 'eye', 'Lines', 'T.', 'S.', 'Eliot', 'kept', 'running', 'mind', 'watched', 'Amalric', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'Paralyzed', 'force', 'gesture', 'motion', 'Amalric', 'able', 'bring', 'surprising', 'amount', 'expressiveness', 'role', 'partly', 'aided', 'glasses', 'seem', 'magnify', 'right', 'eye', 'only', 'part', 'body', 'able', 'move.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'was', 'painstakingly', 'dictated', 'Jean-Do', 'aide', 'would', 'read', 'out', 'alphabet', 'would', 'blink', 'when', 'would', 'reach', 'correct', 'letter', 'standard', 'human', 'achievement', 'writing', 'book', 'stand', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'accomplishments', 'culture', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'managing', 'desiring', 'stay', 'alive', 'such', 'conditions', 'let', 'alone', 'write', 'book.The', 'use', 'camera', 'film', 'remarkable', 'quite', 'while', 'beginning', 'camera', 'work', 'first', 'person', 'seeing', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Jean-Do', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'Once', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'broken', 'back', 'forth', 'perspective', 'disembodied', 'outside', 'observer', 'Especially', 'moving', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Jean-Do', 'paralytic', 'shifting', 'viewpoints', 'sense', 'entrapment', 'own', 'body.The', 'film', 'further', 'establishes', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'one', 'finest', 'filmmakers', 'active', 'today', 'resume', 'tiny', 'three', 'feature', 'films', 'make', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'rate', 'main', 'career', 'been', 'painter', 'based', 'New', 'York', 'only', 'get', 'making', '2', '3', 'more', 'films', ""'ll"", 'be', 'anxious', 'see', 'anything', 'everything']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124181,A18TLRH5PKAS4S,B00104QSOC,Rodney Bucket,"[0, 0]","""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is a profound feat of filmmaking. It is based on the real-life story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, a man who suddenly finds himself in the kind of medical predicament horror stories are made of: he suffers a stroke resulting in ""locked-in"" syndrome, wherein Bauby, though aware of his surroundings and able to hear and see people and things around him, is completely paralyzed and unable to respond to anyone or anything (though he comes to gain some control over one of his eyelids, which is remarkably how the real-life Bauby wrote his memoirs of the same name solely by blinking).It is truly a nightmare of a situation, and yet this film is masterfully made into a thing of beauty and hope. For although Bauby's own body has completely turned against him and shut down, his mind has not, and the film beautifully depicts the power of the mind and the spirit as Bauby's vivid imagination sweeps him away from his dreary hospital bed and into all sorts of fantasy excursions, some real-life flashbacks foraying into his past life, and others that appear to only exist as creations of Bauby's mind. Director Julian Schnabel captures these scenes beautifully, with touches of nostalgia and surrealism that create a beauty from the despair.Rarely does a film manage to juxtapose the depressing and the hopeful so well. Bauby's present is bleak and depressing. It is clear he will not recover from his condition, and the film brutally depicts Bauby's family and friends as they struggle to cope with his predicament. (Perhaps the best, most heart-wrenching scene of the film comes from a one-sided phone conversation between Bauby, who is trapped in his body and cannot speak, and his elderly father (brilliantly portrayed by Max von Sydow), who in his own way is trapped in his apartment and cannot visit his ailing son.)The strength of Bauby's spirit when his body is in such dire straits is incredible and inspiring. At times it is difficult to see the film as a happy one--there is nothing about Bauby's predicament that is happy or hopeful in the least. And yet the fact that Bauby never gives up, never acquiesces to the situation his mind has found his body is as moving and hopeful a story as any. ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is a visually stunning story of the power and strength of the human spirit, and the real-life story of a man whose imagination refused to die.",5,A beautiful portrayal of the human spirit in the face of despair,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2449,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'profound', 'feat', 'filmmaking', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'kind', 'medical', 'predicament', 'horror', 'stories', 'are', 'made', 'stroke', 'resulting', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'wherein', 'Bauby', 'aware', 'surroundings', 'able', 'hear', 'see', 'people', 'things', 'completely', 'paralyzed', 'unable', 'respond', 'anyone', 'anything', 'gain', 'control', 'one', 'eyelids', 'remarkably', 'how', 'real-life', 'Bauby', 'wrote', 'memoirs', 'same', 'name', 'solely', 'blinking', '.It', 'truly', 'nightmare', 'situation', 'yet', 'film', 'masterfully', 'made', 'thing', 'beauty', 'hope', 'Bauby', 'own', 'body', 'completely', 'turned', 'shut', 'down', 'mind', 'not', 'film', 'beautifully', 'power', 'mind', 'spirit', 'Bauby', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'away', 'dreary', 'hospital', 'bed', 'sorts', 'fantasy', 'excursions', 'real-life', 'flashbacks', 'foraying', 'past', 'life', 'others', 'appear', 'only', 'exist', 'creations', 'Bauby', 'mind', 'Director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'scenes', 'beautifully', 'touches', 'nostalgia', 'surrealism', 'create', 'beauty', 'despair.Rarely', 'film', 'manage', 'juxtapose', 'depressing', 'hopeful', 'so', 'well', 'Bauby', 'present', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'recover', 'condition', 'film', 'brutally', 'Bauby', 'family', 'friends', 'struggle', 'cope', 'predicament', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'scene', 'film', 'one-sided', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Bauby', 'who', 'trapped', 'body', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'elderly', 'father', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'own', 'way', 'trapped', 'apartment', 'can', 'not', 'visit', 'ailing', 'son', 'strength', 'Bauby', 'spirit', 'when', 'body', 'such', 'dire', 'straits', 'incredible', 'inspiring', 'times', 'difficult', 'see', 'film', 'happy', 'one', 'nothing', 'Bauby', 'predicament', 'happy', 'hopeful', 'least', 'yet', 'fact', 'Bauby', 'never', 'up', 'never', 'situation', 'mind', 'found', 'body', 'moving', 'hopeful', 'story', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'visually', 'stunning', 'story', 'power', 'strength', 'human', 'spirit', 'real-life', 'story', 'man', 'imagination', 'refused', 'die']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124182,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00104QSOC,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","****1/2Because film is a largely realistic medium, ""impressionism"" is a style rarely attempted by even the most adventurous of moviemakers.  Indeed, Terrance Malick is one of the few directors working today who has found consistent success (artistic if not commercial) in that genre.  Now we can add French filmmaker Julian Schnabel to the list for his truly remarkable work in ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" a movie that defies easy categorization and is quite unlike anything we've encountered before.The story definitely falls into the ""truth is stranger than fiction"" category.  Jean-Dominique Bauby  was a 43-year-old writer and editor-in-chief of Elle Magazine when, in 1995, he suffered a massive stroke that left him completely paralyzed in all but his left eye.  Confined to a bed and a wheelchair and unable to speak or move, all Bauby could do was look out on the world around him without any real hope of ever being able to communicate beyond a simple batting of the eyelid in response to a string of ""yes or no"" questions.  However, thanks to the ingenuity of one of his therapists, Bauby eventually found a way - by painstakingly spelling out each word one letter at a time - to not only communicate fully with those around him but to actually dictate an entire best-selling book with the use of his one eye.For the first twenty minutes or so, we see the world only as Bauby does, from the severely limited viewpoint of his one good eye, as he wakes up from his coma and begins to slowly realize what has happened to him.  As the story progresses, Schnabel gradually allows us to escape Bauby's bodily prison and to see the events from a more objective angle.  From that point on, we split our time fairly evenly between these two perspectives.""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" could have been a mere ""gimmick film"" were it not for the tremendously revelatory nature of Bauby's tale.  Through voiceover narration, we are able to enter into Bauby`s mind to explore the many thoughts and moods that enlighten or plague him.  At first, of course, Bauby is filled with a sense of hopelessness and despair, telling his therapist early on that the one thing he wishes for above all else is death.  However, as time goes on, Bauby begins to realize that, while his body may be trapped in a physical prison (a diving bell), his mind is now free to soar as never before into the realm of fantasy, imagination and memory (the butterfly).  Forced to remove himself from the petty concerns that so often overtake us in our daily lives, Bauby is now able to contemplate the things that REALLY matter in life, principally, what it means to be a partner to his girlfriend, a father to his children, and a son to his aged father.  As such, the movie becomes a celebration of the ability of the human spirit to endure and flourish under even the most trying of circumstances.  The impressionism comes as Schnabel follows the course of Bauby's dreams, visions, memories and imaginings as they come pouring out in virtual stream-of-consciousness fashion, always backed up by Bauby's lyrical contemplation on what they mean to him both as an individual and as a part of the collective human race.""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is a movie overflowing with imagination and surprise, as when, out of nowhere, Schnabel and screenwriter Ronald Harwood insert a lovely little homage to the opening scene in ""The 400 Blows.""  Conversely, the scene in which Bauby has his right eye sewn shut against his unheeded wishes is quite literally harrowing.  Indeed, the movie is often at its most poignant in scenes where Bauby is completely at the mercy of what other people think is best for him, as when an unthinking orderly turns off a soccer match just as Bauby is really getting into it or a well-meaning therapist takes Bauby, an avowed atheist, to visit a Catholic priest.  It is at times like these that he is closest to having his identity as an individual subsumed by his illness and the people around him.Beyond the brilliant performances by Mathieu Amallic as Bauby, Max von Sydow as his 92-year-old father, and Emmanuelle Seigner as his longtime girlfriend, among others, special recognition must surely go to editor Juliette Welfling and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Spielberg's preferred cameraman) for the various miracles they have wrought in bringing this tightrope-walking tour-de-force to the screen.Heartbreaking but never sentimental, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is that rare film that will haunt you for a long time after it's over and will make you look at life in a whole new way.",4,filmmaking at its purest,1212278400,"06 1,

1124184,A2EXC4HOVDAXED,B00104QSOC,Sherringford Clark,"[12, 18]","""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is yet another 2007 film that fails to live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film but not a great one.Of course, there are some good moments in the film: 1) the phone call from the mistress when the wife is present is a very moving scene. 2) Father's Day with his children on the beach. 3) Of course, Max von Sydow was excellent and his call to his son was very cathartic, one of the best moments in the film.Now for the criticisms. For one thing, the filmmmaking is rather clumsy. For example, the image of the deep-sea diving suit is used not once but at least a half-dozen times throughout the movie. The metaphor is not that interesting to warrant the constant reprise of this image. Indeed, all of the visualizations of the title seem rather uninspired and bland - butterflies flying around and a deep-sea diving suit. Basically, it's just making a visual equation of the title - a very easy thing to do. My problem is that the image didn't give birth to the title, but the other way around, which makes it stupid to use it over and over.In fact, there is little to this movie beyond the title, which provides the basic metaphor of the film. Although weighed down by his physical parlysis, Bauby is still able to reach great artistic heights due to the exercise of his imagination. In fact, the film feels the need to have Bauby's amanuensis Celine essentially state the titular metaphor of the film: ""You are my diving bell but also my butterfly"" - something like that. All of this is rather heavy-handed and obvious.As far as the film bridging the subjective and objective, this only amounts to the tired technique of the camera acting as the character's eyes with voiceover. It is well-handled in this film and doesn't plumb the depths of the laughable voiceover work as ""Awake"" did. But still, there is nothing very original or daring about all this.Now, I've never read the book, but I hardly intend to. And I wouldn't say the film is not moving in a general sense, as are most films of its kind. However, it has nothing to offer that other such films about struggles against physical adversity don't. Essentially, it is an embodied cliche, the familiar storyline of the physically challenged person first expressing anger/pity at his state and then sublimating their sufering through imagination/creation. Only the details have been changed. Just to compare, I think ""My Left Foot"" is a much better film, more moving in its portrayal of a caring family and reaching a deeper emotional state of the protagonist, whose emotions don't seem as perfunctory as in this film. (For instance, Bauby states at one point ""I no longer pity myself"" - a rather too pat turnaround for his character I thought and just too straightforward an observation to ring true).Listening to the director Schnagel talk on the bonus features was painful. Like ever other filmmaker, his film addresses the profound questions of life and death. Oh gee, what a surprise. ""It was essentially a self-help exercise to help me overcome the fear of death."" (Sounds like a solipsistic exercise.) ""I'm not a filmmmaker - I'm a painter."" Well, I can believe the last one, because this is not that well-directed of a film. I feel like it could have been better. (Schnagel's pontifications reminded me of Werner Herzog's observation that whenever filmmakers talk about their work it is embarrasing and undignified, whereas an ordinary person always seems to retain his dignity before the camera.)Don't get me wrong: I respect Bauby, but the film does not seem to do his story justice. For example, despite their screen time together, Bauby and Celine's relationship is actually not explored that deeply when you think about it. The movie dwells on the surface and never really addresses the deep questions that it professes to, unlike the work of truly masterful filmmakers like Bergman and Kieslowski, to name just two.But, of course, this is just my opinion, and I'm sure many of you will disagree.",3,"Good, But No Masterpiece",1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,4024,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'yet', '2007', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one.Of', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'film', '1', 'phone', 'call', 'mistress', 'when', 'wife', 'present', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', '2', 'Father', 'Day', 'children', 'beach', '3', 'course', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'was', 'excellent', 'call', 'son', 'was', 'very', 'cathartic', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'film.Now', 'criticisms', 'one', 'thing', 'filmmmaking', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'example', 'image', 'deep-sea', 'diving', 'suit', 'used', 'not', 'once', 'least', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'movie', 'metaphor', 'not', 'interesting', 'warrant', 'constant', 'reprise', 'image', 'Indeed', 'visualizations', 'title', 'seem', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'bland', 'butterflies', 'flying', 'around', 'deep-sea', 'diving', 'suit', 'Basically', 'just', 'making', 'visual', 'equation', 'title', 'very', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'problem', 'image', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'birth', 'title', 'other', 'way', 'stupid', 'use', 'over.In', 'fact', 'little', 'movie', 'title', 'basic', 'metaphor', 'film', 'weighed', 'down', 'physical', 'parlysis', 'Bauby', 'still', 'able', 'reach', 'great', 'artistic', 'heights', 'due', 'exercise', 'imagination', 'fact', 'film', 'need', 'have', 'Bauby', 'amanuensis', 'Celine', 'essentially', 'state', 'titular', 'metaphor', 'film', 'are', 'diving', 'bell', 'also', 'butterfly', 'something', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'obvious.As', 'far', 'film', 'bridging', 'subjective', 'objective', 'only', 'tired', 'technique', 'camera', 'acting', 'character', 'eyes', 'voiceover', 'well-handled', 'film', ""n't"", 'plumb', 'depths', 'laughable', 'voiceover', 'work', 'Awake', 'did', 'still', 'nothing', 'very', 'original', 'daring', 'this.Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'hardly', 'intend', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'not', 'moving', 'general', 'sense', 'are', 'most', 'films', 'kind', 'However', 'nothing', 'offer', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'struggles', 'physical', 'adversity', 'do', ""n't"", 'Essentially', 'embodied', 'cliche', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'physically', 'challenged', 'person', 'first', 'expressing', 'anger/pity', 'state', 'then', 'sublimating', 'sufering', 'imagination/creation', 'Only', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Just', 'compare', 'think', 'Left', 'Foot', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'more', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'caring', 'family', 'reaching', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'state', 'protagonist', 'emotions', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'perfunctory', 'film', 'instance', 'Bauby', 'one', 'point', 'no', 'longer', 'pity', 'rather', 'too', 'pat', 'turnaround', 'character', 'thought', 'just', 'too', 'straightforward', 'observation', 'ring', 'true', '.Listening', 'director', 'Schnagel', 'talk', 'bonus', 'features', 'was', 'painful', 'ever', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'profound', 'questions', 'life', 'death', 'Oh', 'gee', 'what', 'surprise', 'was', 'essentially', 'self-help', 'exercise', 'help', 'overcome', 'fear', 'death', 'Sounds', 'solipsistic', 'exercise', ""'m"", 'not', 'filmmmaker', ""'m"", 'painter', 'Well', 'can', 'believe', 'last', 'one', 'not', 'well-directed', 'film', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Schnagel', 'pontifications', 'reminded', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'observation', 'filmmakers', 'talk', 'work', 'embarrasing', 'undignified', 'ordinary', 'person', 'always', 'retain', 'dignity', 'camera', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'respect', 'Bauby', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'do', 'story', 'justice', 'example', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'Bauby', 'Celine', 'relationship', 'actually', 'not', 'explored', 'deeply', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'surface', 'never', 'really', 'deep', 'questions', 'work', 'truly', 'masterful', 'filmmakers', 'Bergman', 'Kieslowski', 'name', 'just', 'two.But', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'disagree']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124185,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B00104QSOC,S. Spilka,"[0, 1]","I saw the movie before I read the book. Perhaps that was a mistake, but I loved the movie so much that after seeing it three times, I wanted more. So I read the book and wish I hadn't. Julian Schnabel's version of this story is filled with agony but also with light and beauty. The actors are so accomplished and moving (particularly Max von Sidow) that the story becomes human and uplifting, in spite of its tragic ending, and like all great art it affirms the worthwhileness of life, even in its diminished but heroic manifestation. In the book, Bauby--understandably--writes in a self-centered and superficial way. I feel guilty even saying it, because he was in an unimaginably difficult situation. But Schnabel has a deeper and more insightful vision. Schnabel portrays a man who indeed was selfish and vain at the beginning of his hellish journey, but who is able to turn to imagination and writing as a way of transcending the pettiness, wildness, and meaningless of his former life.This change is indicated in several ways. First, when he learns to communicate, Bauby tells his speech therapist that he wants to die. (This does not appear in the book.) She is very upset and reproaches him for his despair. Then she comes back to apologize for stepping out of line. This human interaction of caring and anguish affects the protagonist who decides a short time later to stop feeling sorry for himself and, instead, to use his imagination and memory in order to write down his thoughts and thus defy, in the only way available to him, his diving bell. This decision, probably thought out by the director or the actor (because it is not mentioned in the book) also leads him to reflections of remorse for the way he had been treating his wife and a wish, clearly articulated, to make amends. There is no remorse in the book; instead, Bauby remembers a horrendous fight with his wife, which flatters neither of them, and conveys little insight into the nature of his toxic relationship with her. His hostility toward her, in the book, is still simmering, even in his paralysis. A Greek philosopher said that suffering leads to wisdom. And that's what great art gives us as a gift nonpareil. I didn't see wisdom in the book, but I did see it in the movie.Furthermore, the book skips his meetings with his wife and his girlfriend, meetings which the movie presents in rich and poignant abandon. In the book, Bauby's relationship with his father is summarized, in a paragraph, rather than experienced. In the movie the acting of both von Sidow (as the father) and the actor who plays Bauby is magnificent. The relationship between father and son becomes a profound and moving experience. Schnabel, no doubt, turned a mediocre book into a great work of art. And if he gave the real Bauby a depth he didn't, in reality, have--so be it.",5,A film that is better than the book.,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2834,"['saw', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'mistake', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'seeing', 'three', 'times', 'wanted', 'more', 'So', 'read', 'book', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'version', 'story', 'filled', 'agony', 'also', 'light', 'beauty', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'accomplished', 'moving', 'particularly', 'Max', 'von', 'Sidow', 'story', 'human', 'uplifting', 'spite', 'tragic', 'ending', 'great', 'art', 'worthwhileness', 'life', 'even', 'diminished', 'heroic', 'manifestation', 'book', 'Bauby', 'understandably', 'self-centered', 'superficial', 'way', 'feel', 'guilty', 'even', 'saying', 'was', 'unimaginably', 'difficult', 'situation', 'Schnabel', 'deeper', 'more', 'insightful', 'vision', 'Schnabel', 'man', 'who', 'indeed', 'was', 'selfish', 'vain', 'beginning', 'hellish', 'journey', 'who', 'able', 'turn', 'imagination', 'writing', 'way', 'transcending', 'pettiness', 'wildness', 'meaningless', 'former', 'life.This', 'change', 'indicated', 'several', 'ways', 'First', 'when', 'communicate', 'Bauby', 'speech', 'therapist', 'die', 'not', 'appear', 'book', 'very', 'upset', 'despair', 'Then', 'back', 'apologize', 'stepping', 'line', 'human', 'interaction', 'caring', 'anguish', 'affects', 'protagonist', 'who', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'stop', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'instead', 'use', 'imagination', 'memory', 'order', 'write', 'down', 'thoughts', 'thus', 'defy', 'only', 'way', 'available', 'diving', 'bell', 'decision', 'probably', 'thought', 'out', 'director', 'actor', 'not', 'mentioned', 'book', 'also', 'reflections', 'remorse', 'way', 'had', 'been', 'treating', 'wife', 'wish', 'clearly', 'articulated', 'make', 'amends', 'remorse', 'book', 'instead', 'Bauby', 'horrendous', 'fight', 'wife', 'neither', 'conveys', 'little', 'insight', 'nature', 'toxic', 'relationship', 'hostility', 'book', 'still', 'simmering', 'even', 'paralysis', 'Greek', 'philosopher', 'said', 'suffering', 'leads', 'wisdom', 'what', 'great', 'art', 'gift', 'nonpareil', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'wisdom', 'book', 'did', 'see', 'movie.Furthermore', 'book', 'meetings', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'meetings', 'movie', 'presents', 'rich', 'poignant', 'abandon', 'book', 'Bauby', 'relationship', 'father', 'summarized', 'paragraph', 'rather', 'experienced', 'movie', 'acting', 'von', 'Sidow', 'father', 'actor', 'who', 'Bauby', 'magnificent', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'profound', 'moving', 'experience', 'Schnabel', 'doubt', 'turned', 'mediocre', 'book', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'gave', 'real', 'Bauby', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'reality', 'have', 'so', 'be']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

Jean-Do was the handsome young editor of Elle magazine, with the house, the car, a beautiful wife and adorable children, and of course, the other woman.  While enjoying the accoutrements of the good life he suffers a massive stroke that leaves him paralyzed from head to toe, but for the ability to blink his left eye.  He is afflicted with what is termed locked-in syndrome. He retains the faculties of memory and imagination and, with the help of his devoted carers, is able to complete his memoire by blinking yes or no in response to a particular letter of the alphabet.  With the aide of a patient scribe, Jean-Do retraces the defining moments of his short life from the fresh perspective of this unique predicament, inside what he metaphorically describes as his diving bell - the world beneath his skin containing all of his subjective thoughts, his reflexive response to what appears real externally, and what he retains of his past. The aesthetic is represented as a butterfly that wanders at will, and graces the things its touches with its beauty. He sees the faces of his loved ones: his wife, lover, children, and adorable carers, and appreciates what he has lost - the capacity to fully express his love for them with a gentle embrace. It is a multi layered film that explores the emotional responses of others to Jean-Do's loss as well.  This is one of those rare films that can change your way of seeing.

American director Julian Schnabel decided to shoot it in French as it would feel more authentic.The film isn't for everyone. The subject matter can be perceived as extremely sad, but it can also be considered uplifting. The pacing is slow at times to reflect the painful process of teaching Bauby how to communicate. After his stroke, he was only able to move his left eye. He couldn't swallow, smile, or move any other part of his body. The only other things which weren't taken away were his memories and imagination.One of the reasons that the film works so well is that it shows us the world from Bauby's viewpoint. Images are sometimes blurred or skewed. If someone isn't in his direct line of sight, we don't see them. This has the effect of making us feel as though it has happened to us and that we are suffering from locked-in syndrome. Schnabel allows us to hear Bauby's thoughts and that's another masterstroke. Some thoughts reflect his anger and frustration, but others show his lively sense of humor.Bauby is attended by a variety of nurses and therapists. These scenes always make me feel grateful for being healthy and give me an appreciation for those who devote their lives to helping others. One therapist develops a system to communicate with Bauby. She lists the letters of the alphabet in order of those most commonly used, then asks Bauby to blink when she reaches the correct letter. Imagine how much patience would be required.We find out that Bauby had intended to write a book before his stroke and he communicates to his agent that he would like to honor his contract. He decides to write about his experiences. The diving bell refers to his sense of isolation, while the butterfly refers to the freedom he feels when he uses his imagination. Like 127 Hours, Diving Bell uses a number of techniques to allow to audience to escape from Bauby's confinement. We are shown real memories and also some of his dreams and fantasies.Bauby's achievement in dictating a book by blinking his eye is extraordinary. It says a lot about the determination of the human spirit and shows that every life has the potential to be worth something.If you can handle subtitles, sadness, and slow pacing, the film is a rewarding experience.",5,Inspirational,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2601,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', '2007', 'Drama', 'Biography', '112', 'minutes', 'French', 'LanguageDirected', 'Julian', 'SchnabelStarring', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Marie-Josee', 'CrozeJean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'Amalric', 'was', 'editor', 'Elle', 'magazine', 'details', 'story', 'how', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'found', 'way', 'give', 'meaning', 'remainder', 'life', 'American', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'decided', 'shoot', 'French', 'would', 'feel', 'more', 'authentic.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'perceived', 'extremely', 'sad', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'uplifting', 'pacing', 'slow', 'times', 'reflect', 'painful', 'process', 'teaching', 'Bauby', 'how', 'communicate', 'stroke', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'move', 'left', 'eye', 'could', ""n't"", 'swallow', 'smile', 'move', 'other', 'part', 'body', 'only', 'other', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'taken', 'away', 'were', 'memories', 'imagination.One', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'world', 'Bauby', 'viewpoint', 'Images', 'are', 'sometimes', 'blurred', 'skewed', 'someone', ""n't"", 'direct', 'line', 'sight', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'effect', 'making', 'feel', 'happened', 'are', 'suffering', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'Schnabel', 'hear', 'Bauby', 'thoughts', 'masterstroke', 'thoughts', 'reflect', 'anger', 'frustration', 'others', 'show', 'lively', 'sense', 'humor.Bauby', 'attended', 'variety', 'nurses', 'therapists', 'scenes', 'always', 'make', 'feel', 'grateful', 'being', 'healthy', 'give', 'appreciation', 'who', 'devote', 'lives', 'helping', 'others', 'One', 'therapist', 'system', 'communicate', 'Bauby', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'order', 'most', 'commonly', 'used', 'then', 'Bauby', 'blink', 'when', 'correct', 'letter', 'Imagine', 'how', 'much', 'patience', 'would', 'be', 'required.We', 'find', 'out', 'Bauby', 'had', 'intended', 'write', 'book', 'stroke', 'agent', 'would', 'like', 'honor', 'contract', 'write', 'experiences', 'diving', 'bell', 'refers', 'sense', 'isolation', 'butterfly', 'refers', 'freedom', 'when', 'imagination', '127', 'Hours', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'number', 'techniques', 'allow', 'audience', 'escape', 'Bauby', 'confinement', 'are', 'shown', 'real', 'memories', 'also', 'dreams', 'fantasies.Bauby', 'achievement', 'dictating', 'book', 'blinking', 'eye', 'extraordinary', 'lot', 'determination', 'human', 'spirit', 'life', 'potential', 'be', 'worth', 'something.If', 'can', 'handle', 'subtitles', 'sadness', 'slow', 'pacing', 'film', 'rewarding', 'experience']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

1124191,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00104QSOC,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","About as stunning and emotional as a film can get, Julian Schnabel's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a poignant story based on the memoirs of Elle France editor Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffered from locked-in syndrome, a form of paralysis that kept him a prisoner inside an almost completely immobile body. Noting that the film is based on real events makes it just that much more powerful and a wondrous examination of storytelling from the singular first-person perspective.Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) has a successful career as the editor of Elle Magazine, has a beautiful family, (although he is not married to the mother of his children) and has an elderly father who is immensely proud. At the age of 43, he is suddenly paralyzed by a stroke that leaves him only able to move his left eye. Unable to speak, but still capable of hearing, his fully functioning mind is trapped in a lifeless body that has become an excruciating keep. With the help of speech therapists and doctors, he is able to communicate by blinking - one blink for yes, two for no. An alphabet system is devised which allows him to choose letters by blinking, while a doctor calls out each letter slowly. Being able to express his thoughts, he eventually painstakingly writes a book with the help of his dictation nurse.The first-person perspective that narrates much of the film is ingenious, and accurately demonstrates the horrifyingly moribund situation Bauby is in. Early on, Dr. Cocheton sews up Bobby's right eye in a frightful view that shows stitches penetrating an eyelid as if the camera were the eyeball. Later, all of the doctors, family members and activities Jean-Do sees are from the same perspective, which puts the viewer inside the mind of the suffering man. Time allows him to accept his situation, and he miraculously makes the best of it. ""I survived by clinging to what makes me human"", explains a friend, who earlier had taken Bauby's seat on a plane that was hijacked, resulting in a hostage situation that lasted for four years. Guilt plagues Bauby from that incident, and now he is in a situation equally as terrifying.Bauby's mind and memory are not paralyzed, and so in many a tearjerker moments he uses his imagination to transport himself to various places and with various people to do things he's now unable to do. Tired of TV dinners, he imagines himself feasting at the Le Duc restaurant, eating a grand meal with the beautiful nurse. He also imagines his curse to have been a dream, and he rises from his wheelchair to dance down the halls of the hospital as it might have been as a luxurious Victorian mansion years ago. Strapped to an upright gurney like Hannibal Lector, Bauby learns to make do with what he has, and realizes that his imagination is the only cure for his imprisoned mind.His father Papinou (Max Von Sydow) has great difficulty accepting his son's situation, as he is a feeble 92 year old man; he feels just as confined in his apartment, but is unable to adequately communicate with his son. Jean-Do's mistress Ines can't bear to see him, and he barely wants to see his children, afraid of what they might think. The imagery is unbelievably hard-hitting, and we see such gorgeous sights as he metamorphoses them with his imagination. Slow motion, blurred images, and other visual effects keep all of the imagery almost surreal, and a lovely score by Paul Cantelon accompanies every breathtaking moment. Director Julian Schnabel struck gold when he decided to adapt The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. His direction is superb, but the emotional story is so affective and awe-inspiring that little else is necessary to showcase a film of such rare beauty.- Mike Massie",5,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly Movie Review,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,3713,"['About', 'stunning', 'emotional', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'poignant', 'story', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Elle', 'France', 'editor', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'who', 'suffered', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'form', 'paralysis', 'kept', 'prisoner', 'almost', 'completely', 'immobile', 'body', 'Noting', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'wondrous', 'examination', 'storytelling', 'singular', 'first-person', 'perspective.Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'successful', 'career', 'editor', 'Elle', 'Magazine', 'beautiful', 'family', 'not', 'married', 'mother', 'children', 'elderly', 'father', 'who', 'immensely', 'proud', 'age', '43', 'suddenly', 'paralyzed', 'stroke', 'only', 'able', 'move', 'left', 'eye', 'Unable', 'speak', 'still', 'capable', 'hearing', 'fully', 'functioning', 'mind', 'trapped', 'lifeless', 'body', 'become', 'excruciating', 'keep', 'help', 'speech', 'therapists', 'doctors', 'able', 'communicate', 'blinking', 'one', 'blink', 'yes', 'two', 'alphabet', 'system', 'devised', 'choose', 'letters', 'blinking', 'doctor', 'out', 'letter', 'slowly', 'Being', 'able', 'express', 'thoughts', 'eventually', 'painstakingly', 'book', 'help', 'dictation', 'nurse.The', 'first-person', 'perspective', 'much', 'film', 'ingenious', 'accurately', 'horrifyingly', 'moribund', 'situation', 'Bauby', 'Early', 'Dr.', 'Cocheton', 'up', 'Bobby', 'right', 'eye', 'frightful', 'view', 'stitches', 'penetrating', 'eyelid', 'camera', 'were', 'eyeball', 'Later', 'doctors', 'family', 'members', 'activities', 'Jean-Do', 'sees', 'are', 'same', 'perspective', 'viewer', 'mind', 'suffering', 'man', 'Time', 'accept', 'situation', 'miraculously', 'best', 'survived', 'clinging', 'what', 'human', 'friend', 'who', 'earlier', 'had', 'taken', 'Bauby', 'seat', 'plane', 'was', 'hijacked', 'resulting', 'hostage', 'situation', 'lasted', 'four', 'years', 'Guilt', 'plagues', 'Bauby', 'incident', 'now', 'situation', 'equally', 'terrifying.Bauby', 'mind', 'memory', 'are', 'not', 'paralyzed', 'so', 'many', 'tearjerker', 'imagination', 'transport', 'various', 'places', 'various', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'now', 'unable', 'do', 'Tired', 'TV', 'dinners', 'feasting', 'Le', 'Duc', 'restaurant', 'eating', 'grand', 'meal', 'beautiful', 'nurse', 'also', 'curse', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'wheelchair', 'dance', 'down', 'halls', 'hospital', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'luxurious', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'years', 'ago', 'Strapped', 'upright', 'gurney', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'Bauby', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'imagination', 'only', 'cure', 'imprisoned', 'mind.His', 'father', 'Papinou', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'great', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'son', 'situation', 'feeble', '92', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'just', 'as', 'confined', 'apartment', 'unable', 'adequately', 'communicate', 'son', 'Jean-Do', 'mistress', 'Ines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'see', 'barely', 'see', 'children', 'afraid', 'what', 'might', 'think', 'imagery', 'unbelievably', 'hard-hitting', 'see', 'such', 'gorgeous', 'sights', 'imagination', 'Slow', 'motion', 'blurred', 'images', 'other', 'visual', 'effects', 'keep', 'imagery', 'almost', 'surreal', 'lovely', 'score', 'Paul', 'Cantelon', 'breathtaking', 'moment', 'Director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'struck', 'gold', 'when', 'decided', 'adapt', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'direction', 'superb', 'emotional', 'story', 'so', 'affective', 'awe-inspiring', 'little', 'else', 'necessary', 'showcase', 'film', 'such', 'rare', 'beauty.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124192,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00104QSOC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 13]","Generally, films containing series of disassociative images, tons of POV shots and dream sequences are immediate turn-offs for me. I like my films to have stories and I like those stories to be linear. For the most part.So, it is more than a little surprising that I liked Julian Schnabel's new film ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" based on the life of Elle magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby's life. In fact, I didn't just like it, I loved it. It is a great, moving, well-made film.Jean-Do (Mathieu Almaric) wakes up to find himself in a hospital room in a resort on the coast of France. He quickly learns he is paralyzed from head to toe, cannot speak, and can only blink one eye. As the doctors and their staff visit and do their tests, he learns the prognosis is not good, but they go ahead with more tests and try to help him learn how to adjust to the new life, to rehabilitate him. His estranged wife Henriette (Marie-Josee Croze) visits and can barely look at her husband. One of the physical therapists, Claude (Anne Consigny) is brought on to try to help him learn how to communicate again. She has developed a system; she holds up a card listing all of the letters of the alphabet in the order they are most commonly used. She begins to rapidly go through them. When he hears a letter he wants to use, he blinks. As the words begin to form, she suggests a word. If it is the correct word, she blinks. Jean-Do contacts his publisher, with the help of Claude, and arranges for a transcriber to help him write a book about his experiences. Celine (Emmanuelle Seigner, ""The Ninth Gate"") arrives and to help him write and cope with his life. Writing the book helps him to remember back to key moments in his life, including interactions with his father, Papinou (Max Von Sydow).""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is really a fairly remarkable film. Schnabel uses all of those elements I mentioned previously, the ones I hate, to evoke what Jean-Do is going through. The film opens with a series of flashes and brief glimpses of objects. We hear Jean-Do narrating and feel his confusion as he tries to figure out where he is. Weak, he can barely keep his eyes open. He quickly realizes a series of doctors are fawning over him, trying to figure out what has happened to him. Schnabel uses a series of quick shots, overexposures, brief images and more to give us a feeling of what is going on in Jean-Do's head. Naturally, he is confused and disoriented and we get a real feeling for that.This actually goes on for a while, longer than I would've believed possible in order to maintain any sort of narrative. But because we are inside the patients head for so long, we get a real feel for what he is experiencing. As we listen to his narrative, which are essentially his thoughts, and see what he is seeing, in brief glimpses, and learn what he learns, Schnabel and actor Mathieu Almaric paint a remarkably vivid portrait of this man who can only move one eye.Many actors have portrayed paraplegics in the past, and been richly rewarded for their work with Oscars. Almaric's performance blows them out of the water. For the first twenty or so minutes, we don't even see the actor, but we get a feeling for his character, for his frustration, for his desperation. We are listening to his thoughts and this gives us a great picture of what he is feeling. When we do finally see Jean-Do, we already have a feeling of what this character will be like.In a film like this, there are usually glimpses into the characters life before the sickness hits, generally told through flashbacks. In ""Diving Bell"", there are surprisingly few flashbacks to his life before the sickness. These aren't really needed because the actor gives us glimpses of this previous life through his performance. When we do see a glimpse of this life, it is necessary, to help establish a character we haven't met yet, or to set up an event later in the film. One such moment happens when Jean-Do remembers a time when he visited his father, Papinou (Von Sydow) in his Paris apartment. Papinou, an elderly man, is confined to second floor apartment because he can't get up and down the stairs. Jean-Do visits him and gives him a shave. It is a touching moment, filled with emotion because they clearly love each other very much.The process of writing the book comes to fill the majority of the second act of the film. It is a laborious process, but as jean-Do and Celine get the hang of working with each other, they become more productive. Yet, Jean-Do can't help but comment about how slow the process is, the pains they go through getting accustomed to one another, and more. As Celine gets to know the former magazine editor better, she begins to sense what he is trying to say after he picks up a few letters. In fact, everyone close to him does the same thing. These moments are very helpful to the viewer because they help to show he can communicate and it would become overly tedious if we had to sit and watch him.All of these moments point to one thing; a filmmaker who knows how to compose the type of portrait he wants to paint for the audience. He doesn't want us to observe Jean-Do and look at the paraplegic and moan about how tragic his life is. He wants us to experience the life and the pain of this life through the subject's eyes. It is a remarkably different type of film portrayal than we usually see and it is extremely effective. Rather than remark about how wonderful Robert DeNiro is or how great Daniel Day-Lewis is (and they both were, in their own rights), Schnabel wants us to see every facet of this man's life. But more importantly, he wants us to see how he deals with all of the problems of being completely immobile. Think about it. A French man who is barely middle aged, living a life many of us would dream about, suddenly wakes up to find he can only move one eye and can't communicate with anyone. Confined to a bed and a wheel chair, he must find new ways to converse with his family and friends and the world. So, Claude is a bit of a godsend, when she arrives and announces she has come up with her new communication system.But the remarkable thing about ""Diving Bell"" and Almaric's performance is that this is not the only way he manages to communicate. Amazingly, given the actor is portraying someone who can move only a single part of their body, Almaric makes his character very emotional. With a puffy, permanently pouting lip, an effect of the stroke, Alamric merely looks forward and manages to convey a lot of what Jean-Do is feeling. Because the film so quickly, and effectively, establishes the problems Jean-Do has, we carry this feeling throughout the film, as we watch him convey his emotions with merely a blink of the eye. But as the story progresses, he gets more emotional when he realizes his situation will have more lasting effects and tears swell in his eye.""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is a remarkably powerful and moving portrait of a man who suffers a fate more horrible than most of us can imagine.",5,Oscar Contender Alert - Remarkably Powerful Film,1197504000,"12 13,

1124193,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,B00104QSOC,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[46, 49]","On December 8, 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, known as Jean-Do to his intimates, age forty-three, editor-in-chief of the world-famous fashion magazine, Elle, was living the ""good life"" to the extreme when he became the victim of a devastating cerebro-vascular accident that left him in a state of total paralysis, incapable of any verbal communication, in what is known in the medical community as ""locked-in syndrome.""  His mental faculties totally intact as he laid motionless in his hospital bed, Bauby learned to communicate with the outside world using his left eyelid, the only part of his body over which he still had any control.  During the next fourteen months, using a communication code developed by his therapist and his publisher's assistant, who transcribed this code, Bauby was able to compose, letter by letter, a lyrical and heartbreaking memoir of his life struggle, ""Le Scaphandrier et le papillon.""  Bauby died in 1997, two days after its publication.From Bauby's tragic story, Schnabel has produced an ambitious film which succeeds on all levels.  The problem facing Schnabel to bring the book to the screen was how to keep the spectator interested beyond the dramatic situation itself?  To this end, he uses several solutions in succession.The first thirty minutes of the film are entirely shown in subjective camera.  Without any mannerisms or filmic embellishment, Schnabel succeeds in making the spectator conscious of the patient's terrible situation and of his feelings facing his state of total helplessness.  At this point, the transposition of our mind is such that the profound disquiet goes beyond simple empathy, becoming also physical.Schnabel builds the suspense by progressively revealing the face of the patient.  It takes about thirty minutes into the film before we get to clearly see Bauby's distorted, frozen face.  From the very beginning of the film, we are not witnessing the story of a man, but we will be this man.  But it would be pretentious to say that we will then understand him, the aim of the film being only to paint his intimate portrait, using this ingenious technique.Following this long expository scene, the focus of the film now shifts toward Jean-Do's interaction with the people who surround him.  These interactions are enough to make the Schnabel's film heartrending and less lyrical or pathetic as it progresses and becomes more of a narrative.  This is certainly not a film gimmick to relieve the unbearably oppressive atmosphere crushing the viewers, but a means to keep their interest.In what follows, we see episodes of Jean-Do's fantasies, a mixture of  memories and dreams, some poignant and some comical or sexy, with some fantastic mise-en-sc&egrave;nes.  Jean-Do days resemble parades on a catwalk, about which he was most familiar, as he is constantly visited by the beautiful women who now populate his life: his speech therapist, Henriette (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze), who will teach him the communication code, his physiotherapist, Marie Lopez (Olatz Lopez Garmendia), his estranged partner and the mother of his three children, C&eacute;line (Emmanuelle Seigner), comes to see him often and help out as much as she can, organizing a picnic on the beach with the whole family on Father's day, or reading to Jean-Do the voluminous mail that he receives daily.  And of course, there is Claude (Ann Consigny), who patiently transcribes Jean-Do's ""dictations.""  Bauby, in order to survive his ordeal without losing his mind, had decided to write a memoir, would it be only to prove to his ex-colleagues that he was not a ""vegetable"" (""What kind? ""he asks, ""a carrot? a leek?""  In a beautiful metaphor, Schnabel literally showing the diving bell which physically imprisons the patient, and the freeing of his imagination in the form of a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis and fluttering among fields of flowers may be decorative, but it is certainly appropriate.  The desperately claustrophobic atmosphere at the beginning of the film dissipates somewhat with Bauby's realization of the new freedom left to him by hanging onto his humanness.The ending of this film consists of a dream sequence showing the opening scene of Truffaut's The 400 Blows (1959), but this time the film is in color, as Jean-Do is driving through Paris in his new car.  He is happily going to see his children at his estranged wife's country house.  He takes his son, Theophile (Theo Sampaio) for a ride and suffers a stroke.  The music in Truffaut's film, linking the beginning and the end of his production, accompanies Antoine Doinel as he escapes the delinquent's school to freedom and happiness only to meet imprisonment, as now Jean-Do has.The acting of Mathieu Almaric as Jean-Do is outstanding, and he bears a large responsibility for the film's success.  Whether in the flashbacks and fantasies, as the ostentatious ladies' man, or when he stares into the camera with his drooling face, frozen and yet so eloquent, and as the voice-over, where Almaric is another aspect of the Jean-Do, mischievous, sardonic, despairing, lyrical, at no time in this film can Almaric's credibility be questioned.An exceptional cast of supporting actors and actresses all provide intense richness of emotions, acting with restraint, with hints of modesty and shyness, contrasting with Jean-Do's absolute and candid thoughts.  In particular, the four women are superb. Schnabel seems to have made them a little indistinguishable, since for Jean-Do, connected to life mostly through women, they must each have represented the eternal, untouchable feminine. Patrick Chesnais is perfect as Dr. Lepage, the stereotypical doctor, mixing cynicism with some compassion, who is there for himself and incidentally for his patients.  Schnabel is to be congratulated for his discerning choice of exclusively using French actors.Ronald Harwood, screenwriter for Roman Polanski's two most recent films, The Pianist (2002) and Oliver Twist (2005), wrote the screenplay which is the backbone of this film. While maintaining the basic structure of the book, Harwood succeeds rather well in pacing the story between immobility and action.  However, the key to his success is in making the camera become the man.  This is not a new idea, but neither is it a melodramatic gimmick here, and at precisely the right moment Harwood's perspective changes, and his film follows a little more closely the demands of a traditional biography.  Friends and family from Bauby's life are introduced one by one, but never in a predictable way, nor based upon clich&eacute;s.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List/1993, Saving Private Ryan/1998), Spielberg's chief cinematographer for the last fifteen years, is brilliant.  Rarely has the subjective camera been so well handled: camera out of focus to express the blurring caused by tears; the fades out to black corresponding to the blinking of the eyelid; the occasional leaning of the camera and the brusqueness of some trackings harmoniously fade the shots into the subjective camera.  The sets are all spectacular.  The image is at times out-of-focus, sometimes brilliant and colorful, sometimes blinding and off-center: this is truly the work of Schnabel, the painter.Schnabel, perhaps by accident, provides a free endorsement for the French governmental health system.  The whole film takes place on the backdrop of the public Maritime Hospital at Berk-sur-Mer, in northern France.  However, viewing the medical care provided to Bauby and the environment of the establishment, American audiences will be forgiven for thinking that this is a special private hospital where only well to do people, such as Bauby, are treated.  Not so, this is simply a public hospital, typical of where any French person gets his or her free care.As in all Schnabel's other film, the soundtrack plays an important part.  In this film, the rather eclectic music mix, from Lolita by Nelson Riddle, to Jean Constantin's theme of Les 400 coups, to U2, Nino Rota, Tom Waits, and Paul Cantelon, who wrote piano music for the film, gives the film a contemporary rock-punk connotation.Schnabel raises several points.  He touches the question of continuity in relationships, when the other person becomes a mere shadow of his or her old self, in particular, when the relationship has been intense and at the same time fragile in time and faithfulness.  This is raised in a heartbreaking scene, where C&eacute;line becomes the unwilling intermediary between Jean-Do and In&egrave;s, In&egrave;s telling Jean-Do that she cannot bear to come and see him as he is now.Schnabel describes the souvenirs and bits of one's life that one must be seeing while standing before the gates of death, but in this particular case taking just a little longer.  However, Jean-Do has already died, and has come back to life as an eye.The film is also about what it means to be an artist.  Sickness is a bit like genius, a source of misunderstanding and exclusion, and the artist, like the patient, is in constant battle against the outside world.  To escape one's fate, society's cruelty and restraints, one can only rely on one's own intelligence, creativity, and heroism.  By reaching deep within himself, Bauby extends his life beyond the limitations of his body by dreaming and creating a work of art.  It's a face-off against himself, where the Superego, the butterfly, gains the upper hand over the Ego, the diving bell.  Schnabel is a spiritual man, but not a religious one.  He believes in the goodness of people, and in their capacity for being patient with their fellow humans and treating them well, just for the sake of it, the way the women in the film give freely of themselves, trying to help Jean-Do.Finally, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is a simple but powerful lesson about life, not in the moralistic sense, but in the energy it carries.  As Bauby says in voice-over at the beginning of the film, the lesson is that we should experience life, living in the present, learning to recognize and appreciate the small moments of happiness as they come along, and most importantly, to love.",5,Let the butterfly fly,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,10136,"['December', '8', '1995', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'known', 'Jean-Do', 'intimates',

1124195,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B00104QSOC,Tristan,"[4, 6]","As The Diving Bell and the Butterfly opens (literally) with the blurred images seen through only one eye, it unfolds with a haunting dreamlike atmosphere that you hope is a dream, but very quickly realize it is reality.The Diving Bell and the Butterfly tells the true story of the Elle magazine editor, Jean-Dominique Bauby who suffers a terrible stoke and is paralyzed from head to toe except for one eyelid. He suffers from ""locked-in"" syndrome where he can hear completely and see with one eye but cannot more or talk. Working with a speech therapist he is able to communicate, and eventually dictate his entire memoirs, by blinking. He also has two children from a girlfriend who visits him several times, and helps him contact a lover in a painfully emotional scene.The director, Julian Schnabel, who recently won a Golden Globe for directing this film, masterfully handles the hard material. He blends flash-backs, voice-overs, and effective camera angles and shots to convey the utter horror of only seeing through one eye.A lot of the shots are done with such an angle so you see Jean-Dominique's point-of-view, but these are blended with magnificent clips of nature imagery showing though his body is paralyzed his mind and imagination is not. This is very effective, yet almost too effective because after a while I felt a little exhausted from not seeing the whole picture.I did not particularly enjoy watching this film, mainly because I wasn't able to connect with the characters as well as not being a huge fan of foreign films (it is in French). Still, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a piece of art. Its' vast blend of techniques make it a powerful and emotionally intense film and I give the high rating solely for the purpose of its' artistic creativity.",4,"A,B,C,D,E...",1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1777,"['Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'literally', 'blurred', 'images', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'eye', 'haunting', 'dreamlike', 'atmosphere', 'hope', 'dream', 'very', 'quickly', 'realize', 'reality.The', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'true', 'story', 'Elle', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'who', 'terrible', 'stoke', 'paralyzed', 'head', 'toe', 'one', 'eyelid', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'completely', 'see', 'one', 'eye', 'can', 'not', 'more', 'talk', 'Working', 'speech', 'therapist', 'able', 'communicate', 'eventually', 'dictate', 'entire', 'memoirs', 'blinking', 'also', 'two', 'children', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'several', 'times', 'contact', 'lover', 'painfully', 'emotional', 'scene.The', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'who', 'recently', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'directing', 'film', 'masterfully', 'hard', 'material', 'flash-backs', 'voice-overs', 'effective', 'camera', 'angles', 'shots', 'convey', 'utter', 'horror', 'only', 'seeing', 'one', 'eye.A', 'lot', 'shots', 'are', 'done', 'angle', 'so', 'see', 'Jean-Dominique', 'point-of-view', 'are', 'blended', 'magnificent', 'clips', 'nature', 'imagery', 'showing', 'body', 'paralyzed', 'mind', 'imagination', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'yet', 'almost', 'too', 'effective', 'while', 'felt', 'little', 'exhausted', 'not', 'seeing', 'whole', 'picture.I', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'mainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'connect', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'foreign', 'films', 'French', 'Still', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'piece', 'art', 'vast', 'blend', 'techniques', 'make', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'film', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'solely', 'purpose', 'artistic', 'creativity']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

1124197,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00104QSOC,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Based on the life story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, former chief editor of French ""Elle"" magazine, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" (""Le Scaphandre et le papillon"") is an emotional tale told in an intriguing fashion. At the age of 42, Jean-Dominique Bauby (called ""Jean-Do"" by his friends) has a stroke that completely paralyzed his body. He suffers from what doctors call ""Locked in Syndrome,"" a type of brain infarct. Jean-Dominique's mind is clear, but he cannot move any part of his body expect the left eyelid.First half of the film is told, or seen, mostly from the protagonist's POV. As the film starts, the camera (by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg's regular cinematographer) shows us the blurred images of the things and people surrounding Jean-Dominique - a nurse looking into his eye and a doctor explaining the conditions he is in. Jean-Dominique tries to respond, but then he realizes he cannot communicate, trapped in his body.With a help from a speech therapist Henriette (Marie-Josee Croze, ""Munich"") Jean-Dominique finds a way to communicate with the world outside: blinking once means yes, twice, no. It is a toilsome, time-consuming way, but still it works. Then he sets out to write a book, which eventually became the basis of the film.Director is Julian Schnabel, whose ""Basquiat"" and ""Before Night Falls"" are both inspired by the real persons' lives, told in a rather episodic fashion, and essentially his style doesn't change here. His new film's story does not always unfold chronologically and has frequent flashbacks to Jean-Dominique's younger days, but the film is still compelling. We see him working, talking and sleeping with his girlfriend and having good time with his children before he had a stroke. One touching scene has great Max von Sidow as his aging father. Through Jean-Dominique's memories and imagination we see things Jean-Do had, or perhaps, things he couldn't.Because of the understated humor from Jean-Dominique, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" never becomes dismal. Mathieu Amalric (replacing Johnny Depp) is brilliant, and so is the entire cast. This is a moving story told with great visual style.",4,"""My Imagination and My Memory"": Moving Story with Visual Style",1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2149,"['Based', 'life', 'story', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'former', 'chief', 'editor', 'French', 'Elle', 'magazine', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'Le', 'Scaphandre', 'et', 'le', 'papillon', 'emotional', 'tale', 'told', 'intriguing', 'fashion', 'age', '42', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'called', 'Jean-Do', 'friends', 'stroke', 'completely', 'paralyzed', 'body', 'what', 'doctors', 'call', 'Locked', 'Syndrome', 'type', 'brain', 'infarct', 'Jean-Dominique', 'mind', 'clear', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'part', 'body', 'expect', 'left', 'half', 'film', 'told', 'seen', 'mostly', 'protagonist', 'POV', 'film', 'camera', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'Spielberg', 'regular', 'cinematographer', 'blurred', 'images', 'things', 'people', 'surrounding', 'Jean-Dominique', 'nurse', 'looking', 'eye', 'doctor', 'explaining', 'conditions', 'Jean-Dominique', 'tries', 'respond', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'trapped', 'body.With', 'help', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Henriette', 'Marie-Josee', 'Croze', 'Munich', 'Jean-Dominique', 'way', 'communicate', 'world', 'blinking', 'once', 'yes', 'twice', 'toilsome', 'time-consuming', 'way', 'still', 'Then', 'out', 'write', 'book', 'eventually', 'became', 'basis', 'film.Director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Basquiat', 'Night', 'Falls', 'are', 'inspired', 'real', 'persons', 'lives', 'told', 'rather', 'episodic', 'fashion', 'essentially', 'style', ""n't"", 'change', 'here', 'new', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'always', 'unfold', 'chronologically', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'Jean-Dominique', 'younger', 'days', 'film', 'still', 'compelling', 'see', 'working', 'talking', 'sleeping', 'girlfriend', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'children', 'had', 'stroke', 'One', 'touching', 'scene', 'great', 'Max', 'von', 'Sidow', 'aging', 'father', 'Jean-Dominique', 'memories', 'imagination', 'see', 'things', 'Jean-Do', 'had', 'perhaps', 'things', ""couldn't.Because"", 'understated', 'humor', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'never', 'dismal', 'Mathieu', 'Amalric', 'replacing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'brilliant', 'so', 'entire', 'cast', 'moving', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'visual', 'style']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124198,A6RMR7B2VZ6MD,B00104QSOC,V.D.M.,"[1, 2]","Jean-Dominique Bauby, a middle-aged man and editor for the French magazine Elle definitely lives life to the fullest. One day, however, he takes his son for a ride in his car and mysteriously suffers a massive stroke that renders him nearly completely paralyzed. His doctors tell him he has ""locked-in syndrome"" and can only move his eyelids. One of the movies most shocking and real scenes is not the realization that he has had his stroke and cannot move, but when they sew up his right eyelid. Since he cannot even speak, he can't tell them to stop, he can only think and say it in his mind. But Bauby's mind is a wonder. Anybody who can suffer a stroke and still have an imagination as optimistic and fantastical as his is truly blessed. In his imagination, he can have a feast of food, jump around and dance in a castle, make love with beautiful women, and finally get out of the hellhole of a hospital he has been trapped in for so long. With the help of a speech therapist and his left eyelid, he writes down his life and his fantasies and finally publishes his memoir days before he dies.After viewing ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" for the first time, I kicked into depression. The whole story is gut-wrenching and at times seems terribly unfair. The second time watching this film left me inspired and grateful and happy for everything I have. This movie is a celebration of life and dreams. It will toy with your emotions, making you feel sad for a minute, happy the next, confused the next, and sad yet again.

1124199,A18758S1PUYIDT,B00104QSOC,Viva,"[1, 2]","Imagine having to blink in reply to letters spoken to you just so you could say a few words to someone.  Then imagine having to do it thousands of times so you can write a book.This is the extraordinary journey shown in this film, based on the actual book written by the afflicted Frenchman who had been editing Elle magazine before being stricken down with locked-in syndrome as a result of a stroke.  His left eye works, and that's about it. The rest of his body is useless, giving him the impression that he is deep underwater in a diving bell.  The butterfly metaphor is equally appropriate, as it represents something that can move around wherever it wants to go, unlike this patient.  A great example occurs when Bauby is tired of being fed through a tube and imagines dining on seafood with a beautiful woman and his old, healthy body intact--but only in his dreams.Two scenes in particular are quite moving:  his ailing father's anguished phone call to his beloved son; and a lover's phone call, which the mother of Bauby's children is forced to translate because no one else is available at the time.The cinematography and narrative are compelling, a rare look inside the mind of someone who can barely move a muscle.  The opening of the film is a bit unfocused, but that's exactly how things would look to someone in this condition; in this way, the viewer is placed inside the mind of the patient and given a perspective that the rest of us can only hope we will never have to experience in real life.Remarkable film.",5,"A labor of love and talent, one blink at a time",1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1528,"['Imagine', 'having', 'blink', 'reply', 'letters', 'spoken', 'just', 'could', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'someone', 'Then', 'imagine', 'having', 'do', 'thousands', 'times', 'can', 'write', 'book.This', 'extraordinary', 'journey', 'shown', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'book', 'written', 'afflicted', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'editing', 'Elle', 'magazine', 'being', 'stricken', 'down', 'locked-in', 'syndrome', 'result', 'stroke', 'left', 'eye', 'works', 'rest', 'body', 'useless', 'giving', 'impression', 'deep', 'underwater', 'diving', 'bell', 'butterfly', 'metaphor', 'equally', 'appropriate', 'something', 'can', 'move', 'around', 'go', 'patient', 'great', 'example', 'when', 'Bauby', 'tired', 'being', 'fed', 'tube', 'imagines', 'dining', 'seafood', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'old', 'healthy', 'body', 'intact', 'only', 'dreams.Two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'are', 'quite', 'moving', 'ailing', 'father', 'anguished', 'phone', 'call', 'beloved', 'son', 'lover', 'phone', 'call', 'mother', 'Bauby', 'children', 'forced', 'translate', 'one', 'else', 'available', 'time.The', 'cinematography', 'narrative', 'are', 'compelling', 'rare', 'look', 'mind', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'muscle', 'opening', 'film', 'bit', 'unfocused', 'exactly', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'look', 'someone', 'condition', 'way', 'viewer', 'placed', 'mind', 'patient', 'given', 'perspective', 'rest', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'experience', 'real', 'life.Remarkable', 'film']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
1124200,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00104QSOC,Wesley Mullins,"[24, 27]","""Locked-in Syndrome"", a fate worse than death afflicts Jean-Dominique Bauby in this true story of the final chapter of the remarkable life of the Elle editor and famous Parisian.  With a healthy mind and a useless body, Bauby experiences the horror of only being able to communicate with the outside world by closing one functioning eyelid.  Adding to his torturous existence is that Bauby's mind was meant to be shared with the world.  As an author, editor and shining member of the intellectual elite, Bauby dazzled those who came in contact with him.  When his body died, his great thoughts did not go away.  He could not turn off his creativity, his dreams, his desires or his memories...he just had no way to share them.The first half of ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" details the opening months of that living hell.  One could not think of a worse existence than being in a hospital room with a TV turned to an off-air station during the overnight hours when it blares an alarm.  With no way of changing the channel or asking for help, he suffers for what must have seemed like an eternity.  His days are filled hating the sights of endless doctors, specialists and therapists, all motivated to help their ""famous patient"", hope not shared by Bauby.  All he gains from these visits is an occasional cheap thrill as he's able to ogle one of the many young, Elle reading specialists who dote over him like a superstar.Nearly all of these scenes are filmed from the POV of Bauby, with his internal thoughts providing sardonic commentary to the action in the hospital room.  This provides an uncomfortable presentation, as the audience experiences the realities of his life and thoughts.  Once a solution to his communication problem is presented and a system is developed where his eyelid movements spell out his words and thoughts, he's able to slowly (V  e  r  y  S  l  o  w  l  y) communicate with the world again.  What begins as a devastating declaration to his therapist of ""I  W  a  n  t  D  e  a  t  h"" eventually grows into his memoirs.  The book titled ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"", penned at one blink at a time becomes his last gift to the world, a collection of his dreams, his regrets, and his loves.Bauby's book is the work of a dying man dreaming about living again.  Not angry or jealous, he wants one last chance to speak about the beauties of life, from the love of a great woman to dinner at Paris' finest restaurant.  Scenes of his book are dramatized in the film and come across as strange Charlie Kaufman-like creations where images from his healthy life blend with his hospital setting and are often colored by stories from history or fairy tales.  Dramatized on screen, the film gives the audience a glimpse into the most important organ of the human body, one that goes on dreaming, loving and hurting long after the rest of the body has given up on life.",5,The beauties of life...written at a few words per minute,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2896,"['Locked-in', 'Syndrome', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'afflicts', 'Jean-Dominique', 'Bauby', 'true', 'story', 'final', 'chapter', 'remarkable', 'life', 'Elle', 'editor', 'famous', 'Parisian', 'healthy', 'mind', 'useless', 'body', 'Bauby', 'horror', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'communicate', 'outside', 'world', 'closing', 'one', 'functioning', 'eyelid', 'Adding', 'torturous', 'existence', 'Bauby', 'mind', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'shared', 'world', 'author', 'editor', 'shining', 'member', 'intellectual', 'elite', 'Bauby', 'dazzled', 'who', 'came', 'contact', 'When', 'body', 'died', 'great', 'thoughts', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'could', 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'creativity', 'dreams', 'desires', 'memories', 'just', 'had', 'way', 'share', 'them.The', 'first', 'half', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'details', 'opening', 'months', 'living', 'hell', 'One', 'could', 'not', 'think', 'worse', 'existence', 'being', 'hospital', 'room', 'TV', 'turned', 'off-air', 'station', 'overnight', 'hours', 'when', 'alarm', 'way', 'changing', 'channel', 'asking', 'help', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'eternity', 'days', 'are', 'filled', 'hating', 'sights', 'endless', 'doctors', 'specialists', 'therapists', 'all', 'motivated', 'help', 'famous', 'patient', 'hope', 'not', 'shared', 'Bauby', 'gains', 'visits', 'occasional', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'able', 'ogle', 'one', 'many', 'young', 'Elle', 'reading', 'specialists', 'who', 'dote', 'superstar.Nearly', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'POV', 'Bauby', 'internal', 'thoughts', 'providing', 'sardonic', 'commentary', 'action', 'hospital', 'room', 'uncomfortable', 'presentation', 'audience', 'realities', 'life', 'thoughts', 'Once', 'solution', 'communication', 'problem', 'presented', 'system', 'developed', 'where', 'eyelid', 'movements', 'spell', 'out', 'words', 'thoughts', 'able', 'slowly', 'V', 'e', 'y', 'S', 'l', 'o', 'w', 'l', 'y', 'communicate', 'world', 'again', 'What', 'devastating', 'declaration', 'therapist', 'W', 'n', 't', 'D', 't', 'h', 'eventually', 'memoirs', 'book', 'titled', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', 'penned', 'one', 'blink', 'time', 'last', 'gift', 'world', 'collection', 'dreams', 'regrets', 'loves.Bauby', 'book', 'work', 'dying', 'man', 'dreaming', 'living', 'again', 'Not', 'angry', 'jealous', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'speak', 'beauties', 'life', 'love', 'great', 'woman', 'dinner', 'Paris', 'finest', 'restaurant', 'Scenes', 'book', 'are', 'dramatized', 'film', 'come', 'strange', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman-like', 'creations', 'where', 'images', 'healthy', 'life', 'blend', 'hospital', 'setting', 'are', 'often', 'colored', 'stories', 'history', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Dramatized', 'screen', 'film', 'audience', 'glimpse', 'most', 'important', 'organ', 'human', 'body', 'one', 'dreaming', 'loving', 'hurting', 'long', 'rest', 'body', 'given', 'up', 'life']",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

What Bauby goes through to communicate is sheer madness. I came away with so much admiration for the main character, and for this truly creative and visionary film maker. There are so many scenes that just grab the hand of the reader and pull them into the picture; all I can say, is See this movie! It will break your heart and re-mend it all in one sitting.
