1536095,ADDBX5P9ME978,B007Q1GKR8,Nick Zegarac,"[0, 0]","The Carringtons and the Colbys reunited on Dynasty in Season 8 after the cancellation of Dynasty II: The Colbys (still unavailable on home video). It's problematic to follow Dynasty's plot lines between Season 6-8, because a lot of the characters reappearing in this season required the viewer's prior knowledge from plot points developing on its sister show.Be that as it may, it's fairly easy to see why Dynasty (once the number one show in America) was fast fading from its former glory. The ongoing plots are weaker than average, the actors seemingly going through the motions in Season 8. There are times when Joan Collins and Linda Evans both look generally bored.Also, Season 8 alters the iconic main titles, each character depicted in a more familial setting rather than presented against a backdrop of moneyed playgrounds of the rich and famous. A mistake. This isn't Thirty-Something or Melrose Place. These characters are not our next door neighbors but the people we'd all like to be as decadently rich as. Knocking them down a peg or two from their uber glamour only served to tear down the series faster than expected.  If you love Dynasty, as I do, you'll wish for it during its heady times (Seasons 2-6) and not what it became from Seasons 6-9.Video quality is good, though hardly stellar. Some color bleeding and occasional edge effects. Paramount ought to take the entire franchise to digital hi-def where we could really appreciate it for Nolan Miller's costumes and glitz. Otherwise, buy accordingly.",3,Dynasty's glamour fading fast in Season 8,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1520,"['Carringtons', 'Colbys', 'reunited', 'Dynasty', 'Season', '8', 'cancellation', 'Dynasty', 'II', 'Colbys', 'still', 'unavailable', 'home', 'video', 'problematic', 'follow', 'Dynasty', 'plot', 'lines', 'Season', '6-8', 'lot', 'characters', 'reappearing', 'season', 'required', 'viewer', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'points', 'developing', 'sister', 'show.Be', 'may', 'fairly', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Dynasty', 'once', 'number', 'one', 'show', 'America', 'was', 'fast', 'fading', 'former', 'glory', 'ongoing', 'plots', 'are', 'weaker', 'average', 'actors', 'seemingly', 'going', 'motions', 'Season', '8', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'look', 'generally', 'bored.Also', 'Season', '8', 'alters', 'iconic', 'main', 'titles', 'character', 'depicted', 'more', 'familial', 'setting', 'rather', 'presented', 'backdrop', 'moneyed', 'playgrounds', 'rich', 'famous', 'mistake', ""n't"", 'Thirty-Something', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'people', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'decadently', 'rich', 'Knocking', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'uber', 'glamour', 'only', 'served', 'tear', 'down', 'series', 'faster', 'expected', 'love', 'Dynasty', 'do', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'heady', 'times', 'Seasons', '2-6', 'not', 'what', 'became', 'Seasons', '6-9.Video', 'quality', 'good', 'though', 'hardly', 'stellar', 'color', 'bleeding', 'occasional', 'edge', 'effects', 'Paramount', 'ought', 'take', 'entire', 'franchise', 'digital', 'hi-def', 'where', 'could', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Nolan', 'Miller', 'costumes', 'glitz', 'Otherwise', 'buy', 'accordingly']",Dynasty Season 8

I used to following Dynasty when it was on first run but that has been so many years ago, I have forgotten a lot.I really enjoyed this season. It was not so quite over the top as other seasons and for me that was a good thing. Also there were many more story lines with the younger cast members instead of just always Blake, Alexis and Krystle. Also the season finale, which I am leaving vague if case you have not seen it yet, was more satisfying and again not so over the top as other seasons. Even though I admit I loved most of the past seasons finales, this one I enjoyed as well.I can not believe after all these years we are finally only down to one more season after this: Season 9: The Final Season to be released. Since it was less than a year this season was released after seven. I'm hoping the same will occur with Season 9. Then after that I really hope Dynasty: The Reunion miniseries will be released.

The season, like some previous seasons, will be released in a full set and split into two different sets, Part 1 and Part 2.This season of ""Dynasty"" was certainly not the greatest year in the show's history. The season started in the fall of 1987 and ABC only ordered 22 shows, down from the 30 or 34 episodes ordered from the previous years. Gone from the cast was Diahann Carroll whom the writers couldn't come up with any story ideas for and the fact Aaron Spelling couldn't afford to pay her high salary.Coming in at a paltry #33 in the Nielsen Ratings with a rating of 14.33, ""Dynasty"" started to air an hour earlier. Much of the fun this season focused on Alexis' new relationship with a mystery man Sean Rowan, a sexy and hunky man who could make wallpaper peal but whose acting was simplistic at best. Taking a cue from Joan Collin's personal life that year (she had divorced her younger husband who nearly left her broke) the writer's wrote a story where Alexis is manipulated into allowing this man control of her finances while he plotted to kill her.This season also marked the return of sexy John James and beautiful Emma Samms as Jeff and Fallon.Hopefully, season 9, the series' last, will become available this summer!!!",5,The Entire Series May Be Finally Released in Full!!!,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1336,"['CBS/Paramount', 'made', 'official', 'Dynasty-Season', '8', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'full', 'April', '29th', '2013', 'season', 'previous', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'full', 'set', 'split', 'two', 'different', 'sets', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2.This', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'greatest', 'year', 'show', 'history', 'season', 'started', 'fall', '1987', 'ABC', 'only', 'ordered', '22', 'shows', 'down', '30', '34', 'episodes', 'ordered', 'previous', 'years', 'Gone', 'cast', 'was', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'whom', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'story', 'ideas', 'fact', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'pay', 'high', 'salary.Coming', 'paltry', '33', 'Nielsen', 'Ratings', 'rating', '14.33', 'Dynasty', 'started', 'air', 'hour', 'earlier', 'Much', 'fun', 'season', 'focused', 'Alexis', 'new', 'relationship', 'mystery', 'man', 'Sean', 'Rowan', 'sexy', 'hunky', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'wallpaper', 'peal', 'acting', 'was', 'simplistic', 'best', 'Taking', 'cue', 'Joan', 'Collin', 'personal', 'life', 'year', 'had', 'divorced', 'younger', 'husband', 'who', 'nearly', 'left', 'broke', 'writer', 'wrote', 'story', 'where', 'Alexis', 'manipulated', 'allowing', 'man', 'control', 'finances', 'plotted', 'kill', 'her.This', 'season', 'also', 'marked', 'return', 'sexy', 'John', 'James', 'beautiful', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'Jeff', 'Fallon.Hopefully', 'season', '9', 'series', 'last', 'will', 'become', 'available', 'summer']",Dynasty Season 8
