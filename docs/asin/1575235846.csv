192230,A17TDSX354MP7Y,1575235846,CPTScott,"[33, 39]","I tried this video this morning and was really disappointed.I have been doing yoga for 7 years, have over 70 yoga videos and study with a wonderful teacher with kundalini influences.There are two main points of contention I have with this program.1st: I felt this was very unsound in terms of it's physical presentation. In particular, there are no warmups before she plunges into an inverted table posture (if she considers that a warmup then I'm puzzled). For myself personally (and I am in excellent physical condition and my body is used to an intense yoga practice) I found it very dangerous to proceed like this. A sound yoga practice should gradually prepare the body for what is to come, this program doesn't do that at all.2nd: She shows VERY few modifications which can also be dangerous to someone trying to follow her verbatim, but had I not been experienced with yoga and hadn't known how to modify I would've gotten hurt trying to follow her speed and range of motion (especially the insane speed which she takes cat-cow before your body is properly warmed up.)While I wanted to stop immediately into the tape I thought that I should bypass judgement until doing the whole tape. Unfortunately for me it didn't seem to get better.I really dislike having to write such a negative review because I get no enjoyment out of doing so, however I felt it important to share my opinion because folks might get hurt doing this tape if they don't know any better.While it was interesting to me to see a style of yoga such as this, I won't ever try to practice with this program again (unless I was already thoroughly warmed up with 30 minutes or more of a more sound practice).",1,Scattered practice without proper warmups!,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,1680,"['tried', 'video', 'morning', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed.I', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', '7', 'years', 'have', '70', 'yoga', 'videos', 'study', 'wonderful', 'teacher', 'kundalini', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'points', 'contention', 'have', 'program.1st', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'unsound', 'terms', 'physical', 'presentation', 'particular', 'are', 'warmups', 'inverted', 'table', 'posture', 'warmup', 'then', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'personally', 'am', 'excellent', 'physical', 'condition', 'body', 'used', 'intense', 'yoga', 'practice', 'found', 'very', 'dangerous', 'proceed', 'sound', 'yoga', 'practice', 'should', 'gradually', 'prepare', 'body', 'what', 'come', 'program', ""n't"", 'do', 'all.2nd', 'VERY', 'few', 'modifications', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'dangerous', 'someone', 'trying', 'follow', 'verbatim', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'how', 'modify', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hurt', 'trying', 'follow', 'speed', 'range', 'motion', 'especially', 'insane', 'speed', 'cat-cow', 'body', 'properly', 'warmed', 'up', 'wanted', 'stop', 'immediately', 'tape', 'thought', 'should', 'bypass', 'judgement', 'doing', 'whole', 'tape', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'better.I', 'really', 'dislike', 'having', 'write', 'such', 'negative', 'review', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'doing', 'so', 'however', 'felt', 'important', 'share', 'opinion', 'folks', 'might', 'get', 'hurt', 'doing', 'tape', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better.While', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'style', 'yoga', 'such', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'try', 'practice', 'program', 'again', 'was', 'already', 'thoroughly', 'warmed', 'up', '30', 'minutes', 'more', 'more', 'sound', 'practice']",Kundalini Yoga VHS
192231,A1AV8GAOH131O4,1575235846,"Damon Zex ""Filmmaker""","[20, 20]","Anyone who thinks this workout is disjointed clearly is not meditating while moving through this kriya.  First, it's time to shed some light on what this type of kundalini sequence actually is.  This is definately a Yogi Bhajan sequence.  Bhajan created several kriyas with similar names - ""Grace & Prosperity,"" ""Flexibility & the Spine,"" for example.  ""Grace & Strength"" is a fusion workout existing in an interzone between the original ""Warrior Workout"" and ""Flexibility & the Spine.""  Like the ""Warrior Workout,"" there is a running segment, frog pose, and several back bends like bow.  Like the flexibilty or spinal kriyas, there are cobra, seated wide angle forward bends, wheel, crow squats, and standing back/forward bends.  Carol is showing you exactly how this kriya would have been taught by Yogi Bhajan.  Anyone who has ever done Ravi Singh's and Ana Brett's ""Ultimate Stretch Workout"" can see obvious similarities to this set.  The difference is that it has a more rapid motion, contains an aerobic component, a segment designed for the heart chakra, and a rather complex abdominal sequence in the middle of the set.  I personally think Carol magnificently explains breath of fire, what real strength is, and concludes her set with a beautifully inspired resting pose dialogue.  As she says, this set is to improve your strength, not prove your strength.  I have spent years doing power yoga, ashtanga, and kundalini.  This segment, in a similar mode to Donna Davidge, works on the body and the mind throughout the day after performing it in the morning.  Also, those hatha yoga critics who claim it is unsafe to begin in table top (truly one of the less difficult asanas) need to understand that before doing any intermediate kundalini sequence, one should already be warmed up.  Before I do this or any kundalini set, I perform the Five Tibetan Rites.  After doing any rigorous segment, Carol gives you more than ample time to consolidate your gains through a moment of still meditation.  Realize, if you are doing yoga simply to de-stress through deep breathing, kundalini yoga is less appropriate than hatha, ashtanga, or power yoga variations.  If you are doing this to actually raise kundalini, work the lymphatic, nervous systems, and increase the internal will linking the body and mind together, this is the type of yoga to do.  Upon finishing this workout, even though it is made up of an anti-intuitive sequence, I feel active, strong, defined, and just as ready to take action in my day as I would if I did power yoga.  Often, power yoga can make me feel too heavy or weighted down from too many held poses.  I like how this unusual sequence jump starts my heart after running/skipping in place, making me feel extremely light on my feet.  I also think her return to child's pose and her instructions on how to round up, using your abdominal muscles makes transitioning between meditating and action extremely fluid.  Those who have criticized this DVD should take a look at a kundalini book and understand the wide variety of sequences Bhajan created before displaying their obvious lack of knowledge to the world.  Carol Carlson didn't make this DVD for shock value, fame, or bedazzlement.  It is clear that she expresses a true, deep felt love of kundalini and a true urge to give you, the viewer, a true kundalini experience.",5,"An Engimatic, Beautiful, & Inspiring Workout",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,3352,"['Anyone', 'who', 'workout', 'disjointed', 'clearly', 'not', 'meditating', 'moving', 'kriya', 'First', 'time', 'shed', 'light', 'what', 'type', 'kundalini', 'sequence', 'actually', 'definately', 'Yogi', 'Bhajan', 'sequence', 'Bhajan', 'created', 'several', 'kriyas', 'similar', 'names', 'Grace', 'Prosperity', 'Flexibility', 'Spine', 'example', 'Grace', 'Strength', 'fusion', 'workout', 'existing', 'interzone', 'original', 'Warrior', 'Workout', 'Flexibility', 'Spine', 'Warrior', 'Workout', 'running', 'segment', 'frog', 'pose', 'several', 'back', 'bends', 'bow', 'flexibilty', 'spinal', 'kriyas', 'are', 'cobra', 'seated', 'wide', 'angle', 'forward', 'bends', 'wheel', 'crow', 'squats', 'standing', 'back/forward', 'bends', 'Carol', 'showing', 'exactly', 'how', 'kriya', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'Yogi', 'Bhajan', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'done', 'Ravi', 'Singh', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'Ultimate', 'Stretch', 'can', 'see', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'set', 'difference', 'more', 'rapid', 'motion', 'aerobic', 'component', 'segment', 'designed', 'heart', 'chakra', 'rather', 'complex', 'abdominal', 'sequence', 'middle', 'set', 'personally', 'think', 'Carol', 'magnificently', 'breath', 'fire', 'what', 'real', 'strength', 'set', 'beautifully', 'inspired', 'resting', 'pose', 'dialogue', 'set', 'improve', 'strength', 'not', 'prove', 'strength', 'have', 'spent', 'years', 'doing', 'power', 'yoga', 'ashtanga', 'kundalini', 'segment', 'similar', 'mode', 'Donna', 'Davidge', 'body', 'mind', 'day', 'performing', 'morning', 'Also', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'critics', 'who', 'claim', 'unsafe', 'begin', 'table', 'top', 'truly', 'one', 'less', 'difficult', 'asanas', 'need', 'understand', 'before', 'doing', 'intermediate', 'kundalini', 'sequence', 'one', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'warmed', 'up', 'do', 'kundalini', 'set', 'perform', 'Five', 'Tibetan', 'Rites', 'doing', 'rigorous', 'segment', 'Carol', 'more', 'ample', 'time', 'consolidate', 'gains', 'moment', 'still', 'meditation', 'Realize', 'are', 'doing', 'yoga', 'simply', 'de-stress', 'deep', 'breathing', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'less', 'appropriate', 'hatha', 'ashtanga', 'power', 'yoga', 'variations', 'are', 'doing', 'actually', 'raise', 'kundalini', 'work', 'lymphatic', 'nervous', 'systems', 'increase', 'internal', 'will', 'linking', 'body', 'mind', 'together', 'type', 'yoga', 'do', 'Upon', 'finishing', 'workout', 'even', 'made', 'anti-intuitive', 'sequence', 'feel', 'active', 'strong', 'defined', 'just', 'as', 'ready', 'take', 'action', 'day', 'would', 'did', 'power', 'yoga', 'Often', 'power', 'yoga', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'too', 'heavy', 'weighted', 'down', 'too', 'many', 'held', 'poses', 'like', 'how', 'unusual', 'sequence', 'jump', 'heart', 'running/skipping', 'place', 'making', 'feel', 'extremely', 'light', 'feet', 'also', 'think', 'return', 'child', 'pose', 'instructions', 'how', 'round', 'up', 'using', 'abdominal', 'muscles', 'transitioning', 'meditating', 'action', 'extremely', 'fluid', 'who', 'have', 'criticized', 'DVD', 'should', 'take', 'look', 'kundalini', 'book', 'understand', 'wide', 'variety', 'sequences', 'Bhajan', 'created', 'displaying', 'obvious', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'world', 'Carol', 'Carlson', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'DVD', 'shock', 'value', 'fame', 'bedazzlement', 'clear', 'true', 'deep', 'felt', 'love', 'kundalini', 'true', 'urge', 'give', 'viewer', 'true', 'kundalini', 'experience']",Kundalini Yoga VHS
192232,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,1575235846,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[7, 7]","I read these reviews and was initially turned off.  However, my library had this available, so I thought I had nothing to lose and gave it a try.  It's excellent.  I taught vinyasa yoga for a few years, but I don't consider myself an expert- and certainly not on Kundalini.  However, by the end of the practice I felt clear and happy, and the effect lasted well into the next day.  The instructor is not, as others have pointed out, overflowing with effusive joy, but she is still inspirational and expert in guiding what I would consider to be a high beginner kundalini practice.I've got to say, I think other reviewers overreacted to some of the kriyas used here.  When I read ""she starts with a full backbend"", I was a little nervous.  However, I don't think that's accurate.  She starts with what others call ""tabletop"", not ""wheel"".  I think your shoulders might complain more than your back, but I had no problems.I also think that the concept of ""flow"" isn't appropriate for a Kundalini practice.  This isn't vinyasa or in the lineage of Iyengar, Ashtanga or Viniyoga, for which that might be a more pertinent criticism.  Kundalini, from what I have seen thus far, is aimed at releasing energy usually located at the base of the spine all the way up to the crown of the head and throughout the body.  There is then perhaps a ""flow"" of energy, but not necessarily physical movement.  Most of the practices I've seen usually start with movements aimed at opening up the chakras or energy centers from the base of the spine up to the crown of the head, perhaps starting first with spinal warmups.  This practice was no exception, although she doesn't discuss the chakras at all.This practice has quite a bit of abdominal work (though not of the ""crunch"" style), some of which may be too intense for absolute beginners, including the Kundalini staple Stretch pose, as well as a bicycle and inner thigh stretch/kriya.  Even with a regular yoga and Pilates practice, my abs were still talking to me for the rest of the day- but I liked it.  I also liked that even though there were several ""stretchy"" positions that utilized long holds, it wasn't as demanding of perfection as some other styles of yoga.  Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed the relatively long rests between postures, as well as the guided meditations, relaxations and chants.I think this practice can give physical ""results"" as far as weightloss and appearance, but if you're just here for the physical, you might find the other trappings off-putting.",5,Great practice (and what strange reviews!),1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,2514,"['read', 'reviews', 'was', 'initially', 'turned', 'off', 'However', 'library', 'had', 'available', 'thought', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', 'gave', 'try', 'excellent', 'taught', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'few', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'expert-', 'certainly', 'not', 'Kundalini', 'However', 'end', 'practice', 'felt', 'clear', 'happy', 'effect', 'lasted', 'well', 'next', 'day', 'instructor', 'not', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'overflowing', 'effusive', 'joy', 'still', 'inspirational', 'expert', 'guiding', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'high', 'beginner', 'kundalini', 'practice.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'think', 'other', 'reviewers', 'overreacted', 'kriyas', 'used', 'here', 'When', 'read', 'full', 'backbend', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'accurate', 'what', 'others', 'call', 'tabletop', 'not', 'wheel', 'think', 'shoulders', 'might', 'complain', 'more', 'back', 'had', 'problems.I', 'also', 'think', 'concept', 'flow', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'Kundalini', 'practice', ""n't"", 'vinyasa', 'lineage', 'Iyengar', 'Ashtanga', 'Viniyoga', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'pertinent', 'criticism', 'Kundalini', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'aimed', 'releasing', 'energy', 'usually', 'located', 'base', 'spine', 'way', 'crown', 'head', 'body', 'then', 'perhaps', 'flow', 'energy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'physical', 'movement', 'Most', 'practices', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'usually', 'start', 'movements', 'aimed', 'opening', 'up', 'chakras', 'energy', 'centers', 'base', 'spine', 'up', 'crown', 'head', 'perhaps', 'starting', 'first', 'spinal', 'warmups', 'practice', 'was', 'exception', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'chakras', 'all.This', 'practice', 'quite', 'bit', 'abdominal', 'work', 'not', 'crunch', 'style', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'including', 'Kundalini', 'staple', 'Stretch', 'pose', 'as', 'well', 'bicycle', 'inner', 'thigh', 'stretch/kriya', 'Even', 'regular', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'practice', 'abs', 'were', 'still', 'talking', 'rest', 'day-', 'liked', 'also', 'liked', 'even', 'were', 'several', 'stretchy', 'positions', 'utilized', 'long', 'was', ""n't"", 'demanding', 'perfection', 'other', 'styles', 'yoga', 'Finally', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'relatively', 'long', 'rests', 'postures', 'as', 'well', 'guided', 'meditations', 'relaxations', 'chants.I', 'think', 'practice', 'can', 'give', 'physical', 'results', 'as', 'far', 'weightloss', 'appearance', ""'re"", 'just', 'here', 'physical', 'might', 'find', 'other', 'trappings', 'off-putting']",Kundalini Yoga VHS

192237,AWMU4C4CH21TE,1575235846,YogaGirl,"[8, 8]","I have been doing kundalini yoga for 9 months now.  I am totally hooked.  I have other yoga dvds/videos which I try to do, but always gravitate to my kundalini yoga dvds.  I am no longer interested in becoming a human pretzel or a master of standing on my head.  I just want to be the radiant person I was meant to be and kundalini yoga will get me there faster than other types of yoga.  Having said all of that, after reading the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this video. I'm glad I did. It will be a staple in my kundalini DVD/video rotation.  I'd like to point out a couple of things to people who complained that it does not start out with an adequate warm-up/bad sequencing and the attitude of the instructor. First, Kundalini yoga is NOT like other types of yoga. If you are coming to it from another type of yoga, you need to hold your criticism and let it work for you. It is not form precise like Iyengar or flowing like ashtanga.  Yet it is powerful and can produce remarkable results.  Second, Kundalini yoga consists of sets or kriyas. Every single pose is in a set for a reason, physically and spiritually.  A good teacher will tell you what each pose does for you as the set progresses.  The sets are documented in manuals and books that the teachers follow, usually to the letter including breathing instructions, mantras and meditations. Warm-ups and music can be added depending on the teacher.  Some teachers are more creative than others and they may add extras to the class, such as warm-ups, music, words of wisdom, prayers, etc.  Carol chose to just present the kriya, probably as taught by Yogi Bhajan. This doesn't make it bad, just 'simple and unadorned'.  I personally loved the set.  The back bends are wonderful; the crow squats with arms is amazing.  As to her personality, it didn't bother me.  If you love kundalini yoga, as I do, add this one to your collection. Don't be put off by petty comments about her personality. It's irrelevant to the set. And if you really need a warm-up, put on a Ravi Ana DVD and just do the warm-up and then enjoy Carol's set.",5,Great kundalini yoga set,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2090,"['have', 'been', 'doing', 'kundalini', 'yoga', '9', 'months', 'now', 'am', 'totally', 'hooked', 'have', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvds/videos', 'try', 'do', 'always', 'gravitate', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'becoming', 'human', 'pretzel', 'master', 'standing', 'head', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'radiant', 'person', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'will', 'get', 'there', 'faster', 'other', 'types', 'yoga', 'Having', 'said', 'reading', 'reviews', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'video', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'will', 'be', 'staple', 'kundalini', 'DVD/video', 'rotation', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'couple', 'things', 'people', 'who', 'complained', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'adequate', 'warm-up/bad', 'sequencing', 'attitude', 'instructor', 'First', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'NOT', 'other', 'types', 'yoga', 'are', 'coming', 'type', 'yoga', 'need', 'hold', 'criticism', 'let', 'work', 'not', 'form', 'precise', 'Iyengar', 'flowing', 'ashtanga', 'powerful', 'can', 'produce', 'remarkable', 'results', 'Second', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', 'sets', 'kriyas', 'single', 'pose', 'set', 'reason', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'good', 'teacher', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'pose', 'set', 'sets', 'are', 'documented', 'manuals', 'books', 'teachers', 'follow', 'usually', 'letter', 'including', 'breathing', 'instructions', 'mantras', 'meditations', 'Warm-ups', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'depending', 'teacher', 'teachers', 'are', 'more', 'creative', 'others', 'may', 'add', 'extras', 'class', 'such', 'warm-ups', 'music', 'words', 'wisdom', 'prayers', 'etc', 'Carol', 'chose', 'just', 'present', 'kriya', 'probably', 'taught', 'Yogi', 'Bhajan', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'just', ""'simple"", 'unadorned', 'personally', 'loved', 'set', 'back', 'bends', 'are', 'wonderful', 'crow', 'arms', 'amazing', 'personality', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'love', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'do', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'petty', 'comments', 'personality', 'irrelevant', 'set', 'really', 'need', 'warm-up', 'put', 'Ravi', 'Ana', 'DVD', 'just', 'do', 'warm-up', 'then', 'enjoy', 'Carol', 'set']",Kundalini Yoga VHS
