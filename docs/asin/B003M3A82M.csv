This was due to Miss Nolan getting injured while riding a horse during the filming of an episode of the show. Despite this, the show is still a cut above most shows of the time and most of today's. Kate did return for the remainder of this season and was then on the show throughout the fifth season. I certainly hope the fifth season will also be released on DVD in the very near future.",5,Still a fine show but Kate is missing for several episodes,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,555,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'released', 'season', 'wonderful', 'show', 'Kate', 'McCoy', 'Kathy', 'Nolan', 'missing', 'several', 'episodes', 'middle', 'season', 'was', 'due', 'Miss', 'Nolan', 'getting', 'injured', 'riding', 'horse', 'filming', 'episode', 'show', 'show', 'still', 'cut', 'most', 'shows', 'time', 'most', 'today', 'Kate', 'did', 'return', 'remainder', 'season', 'was', 'then', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'certainly', 'hope', 'fifth', 'season', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'very', 'near', 'future']",The Real McCoys Season 4

Schoditsch,"[25, 25]","It's been a long two years since the release ofThe Real McCoys - Season 3but we gladly welcome back Grandpa Amos McCoy and family into our homes once more.  Billed as rural comedy, it is often hilarious and at times will bring moisture to the eyes.  The Real McCoys is a supreme example of perfect family viewing in this ever changing American media landscape.  This refreshing and very affordable set (at time of pre-order) offers a whopping 39 episodes (no half season set here)!
