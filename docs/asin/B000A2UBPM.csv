This time around, however, I find she has successfully migrated herself into that elite group of social humorists who are able to comment on our social status as a country and our politics, and do so with blazing strikes that are poignant, on-the-mark AND funny. Margaret has changed, and with this change comes a broadening of her boldness. She has taken the torch from the likes of Lenny Bruce, and she holds no punches back when she speaks her mind, be it about the rights of individuals or the brazen BS of our some of our right-wing politicians.

I loved her first DVD concert, ""I'm The One I Want""---the material was fresh and daring for the most part, despite the occasional maudlin detour into pop-psychology bathos (""poor me, they told me I was fat!"").However with each new DVD, Margaret seems to be mainly recycling the same old punchlines and hooks, and most worrisome of all, seemingly ALWAYS TO THE SAME ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOME AUDIENCE!!!It reminds me a bit of GW Bush of all people---all of his appearances are carefully planned with the audience carefully prescreened and limited to enthusiastic Republican supporters.  The result being that Bush often appears to live inside a bubble and makes sense only to himself and his endless sea of stooges and ardent fans.There is a annoying clubbiness about Cho's whole approach, which you can see in the first 5-10 minutes of these DVDs, when the camera gets in the face of her adoring fans standing in line, all of them gushing about how absolutely cool and bad-@ss Margaret is...ick!  So much narcissistic self-congratulation, and it all stinks of some vague desperation: why would she NEED to showcase all that validation at the beginning of her DVDs?  Does she feel that the viewer needs to be told how GREAT she is (or at least how great her fans think she is) before they watch her performance?  Or is it her way of fostering a sense of commonality and identity (see ""clubbishness"") in her fan base?This is all such a shame, because it's obvious that Cho is blessed with immense comedic talent even when she's just phoning it in like she does here.Margaret: why not tape a concert before an audience in oh, Topeka Kansas instead of your usual San Francisco or NYC fan base?

She has always been a gifted storyteller, and some of her jokes about her family as well as her riffs on sex were hilarious.  Somewhere in between these two films and ""Margaret Cho: Assassin"" (2005), Cho became increasingly politically edged.  Her jokes now focus on lambasting conservatives and Christian religious groups.  I'm pretty open to any topic being the source of humor, but the jokes have to be well-written and original or else it can come across as petty.  Unfortunately, too much of her material in ""Assassin"" is stale - tired iterations of the same old Bush jokes.  Of course, ""Assassin"" was released in 2005, so some of the jokes may have been a bit fresher then.  However, even to this Cho fan, they haven't aged well.A few jokes did score.  Her impression of Bjork is terrific, and she can still tell a raunchy joke skillfully.  Unfortunately, Cho is starting to come off a tad smug, even though I agree with most of her political beliefs.  Making her political beliefs and activities the focus of her act is a mistake, in my view; she verges on pandering to her audience at times, and it overshadows the jokes.  I'm curious to see how Cho in this age of Obama will change her act.  I'm still a fan, just a tad skeptical of whether I will enjoy her future work as much.",2,Too often heavy handed,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,1410,"['really', 'loved', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'first', 'two', 'concert', 'films', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want', '2000', 'Notorious', 'C.H.O', '2001', 'always', 'been', 'gifted', 'storyteller', 'jokes', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'riffs', 'sex', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Somewhere', 'two', 'films', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'Assassin', '2005', 'Cho', 'became', 'increasingly', 'politically', 'edged', 'jokes', 'now', 'focus', 'lambasting', 'conservatives', 'Christian', 'religious', 'groups', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'open', 'topic', 'being', 'source', 'humor', 'jokes', 'have', 'be', 'well-written', 'original', 'else', 'can', 'come', 'petty', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'Assassin', 'stale', 'tired', 'iterations', 'same', 'old', 'Bush', 'jokes', 'course', 'Assassin', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'jokes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'fresher', 'then', 'However', 'even', 'Cho', 'fan', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well.A', 'few', 'jokes', 'did', 'score', 'impression', 'Bjork', 'terrific', 'can', 'still', 'tell', 'raunchy', 'joke', 'skillfully', 'Unfortunately', 'Cho', 'starting', 'come', 'off', 'tad', 'smug', 'even', 'agree', 'most', 'political', 'beliefs', 'Making', 'political', 'beliefs', 'activities', 'focus', 'act', 'mistake', 'view', 'pandering', 'audience', 'times', 'jokes', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'Cho', 'age', 'Obama', 'will', 'change', 'act', ""'m"", 'still', 'fan', 'just', 'tad', 'skeptical', 'will', 'enjoy', 'future', 'work', 'as', 'much']",Margaret Cho - Assassin
