1111240,A19ELFMMKB83HC,B000WPJT1Y,"J. Carey ""waymorefun""","[13, 13]","I was a kid with our first TV when I became a fan of The Range Rider.  Jock Mahoney (Sally Fields stepdad) is the perfect 50's cowboy.  He can ride and shoot and save the town and all in less than 30 minutes.  He and his trusty companion Dick West never swear or drink or break the law, its just like I remembered and I'm loving it.  Whoever put these together on DVD did a great job.

1111243,ABQ1KUSIHTK7K,B000WPJT1Y,"R. H. Lewis ""Author of &#34;Lottie Little: Th...","[20, 20]","It took me a long time to decide to buy this offering of the Range Rider from Alpha Video. I have not had a lot of luck with past purchases. The transfers of some of the classic cowboy movies have been less than satisfying. But, in this case, my hat is off to Alpha. The prints are great. They look better than they did when I watched the Range Rider faithfully, through a snow-laden, vertically and horizontally challenged, nightmareish round hole we called a television.Jack, Jock Mahony was more athletic and more at home in the saddle than any of the cowboy stars of that era. His sidekick, Dick Jones, equaled Mahony's prowess and added the comic relief, as well. I don't think I can count on one hand the number of times they used the left stirrup to mount their horses, Rawhide and Lucky. Back mounts, standing mounts, running mounts were the norm.I never realized what a strong sense of morality and personal responsibility to do the right thing was woven into every story. When you're a kid it's the fighting, shooting and riding that count - and there's a lot of action in these episodes.Here's hoping Alpha Video might make available the rest of the Range Rider series.It's good to see my heroes ride again.",5,Mahony and Jones.

There where 79 episodes, and you get 20 of them in this five DVD pack. I wish I had all of them.  The picture and the sound is very  good.
