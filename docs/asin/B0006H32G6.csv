I think it's probably just because I saw it first for some reason, though it also has better music. Although, Tiger becoming a dog always cracked me up too! These movies are definitely classics.*SPOILER ALERT* My only problem with these movies - the reason I cannot give them 5 stars - is because they pretty much both have the exact same plot. Fievel gets lost - in the first during the voyage to America and in the second during the train ride out west. (They are seeking a better life because they did not learn the grass is not greener on the other side in the first.) He manages to reunite with his family against all odds. In both movies, a fake mouse - either a rat dressed up as a mouse or a mouse puppet - befriend all the mice. This is the cats' doing, to trick the mice and catch them all. Only Fievel knows and has to save everyone. Actually, if you watch through movies 3 and 4, ""Treasure of Manhattan Island"" and ""Mystery of the Night Monster,"" you'll get the same plot again! I forget which one, but there is a dog so small she is able to disguise herself as a mouse. Not bad movies though. In one of those, I forget which again, we move on from ""America, the land of opportunity"" theme to the evils of Capitalism. Relevant to today. *END OF SPOILER*Overall, very good movies.

Along The way, Fivel Befriends A Cat Named Tiger and Must Avoid Any Evil Villians on The Journey.Like All of Don Bluth's Animated Films (Such asThe Secret of NIMH,Rock-A-Doodle, andAll Dogs Go to Heaven) This is an Absolute Classic For Kids and Adults Alike. The Animation and Cast in The Film are Absolutly Brilliant and Amazing To Lookm At and Listen To. American Tail is The Second Best Don Bluth Film and is Great For The Whole Family.In The Film's Sequel, Fivel Goes West, Fivel Gets Lost Yet Agian on The Way To The West and Figueres Out An Evil Cat's Plan To Get Rid of All The Mice in A Huge Mouse Trap. After The Mice Don't Belive Fivel, He Decides To Save The West Side-By-Side With Westren Hero Wilie Burp and Best Friend Tiger.Unlike Most Don Bluth-less Sequels (Such asThe Secret of NIMH 2 - Timmy to the Rescue,All Dogs Go To Heaven 2, andAn American Tail - The Mystery of the Night Monster) This Was Great. John Clesse (Known as Fiona's Father inShrek 2 with Bonus Holiday Dvd - Full Screenand Nearly Headless Nick inHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Full-Screen Edition)) Was Great as the Evil Kitty-Cat With A Bit of A Soft Side.
