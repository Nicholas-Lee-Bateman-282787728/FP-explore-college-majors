Rogers,"[9, 10]","This movie has so much potential and to tell you the truth when it's on T.v or when I feel like watching something familiar it is still something I watch.  The problem is that with so much potential the story fails.  The story loses focus as to what the brothers wanted in the first place, especially JC played by Billy Crudup.All of the actors are great, but Jennifer Connelly made the movies worth watching she draws the audience with her mishievous and tempetous Eleanor.  If she was ever cast as a villain she would be the pitch perfect but so far in her career this is as close as she gets to playing bad and she does with such a subtle hint of seduction that as an audience member it is mindboggling when the writer director whoever decided to yank her character 30 minutes in.  A shame a true shame.What we are left with is a skeleton of a movie till the end when Joaquin Phoenix's character Doug returns to his primary motivation and the story gets back on track.This movie isn't bad.

160000,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,0793960819,David A. Bede,"[20, 21]","Based on a rather depressing short story, this is the only movie I've seen which I can honestly say is better than the book it's based on. It still surprises me that the critics weren't more impressed with it than they were.Although Inventing the Abbotts is centered on two well-treaded themes - love across a class divide and bad blood between families - it takes enough of a new approach to avoid cliches. For one thing, the animosity between the rich Abbotts and the working-class Holts is selective, with varying degrees of friendship and respect between certain members of each family showing through alongside the bitterness between others. The exact cause of that bitterness, centered on a long-ago business deal between the two families' fathers, is a combination of mystery and misinformation to the main character, Doug (Joaquim Phoenix). The resolution of that mystery plays out alongside Doug's changing relationship with the Abbotts' youngest daughter, Pamela (Liv Tyler) throughout the film, thus preventing the forbidden-love motif from becoming overbearing.But the movie does remain a love story at heart, and Phoenix and Tyler are remarkably well-suited to the task. (They apparently were a real-life item for some time after filming - and the sincerity shows.) Complicating the picture are Doug's bitter, jealous elder brother Jaycee (Billy Crudup), who sows discord among both families throughout the film; Pamela's troubled relationship with her sisters and parents; and the hazards of growing up in general. In keeping with the avoidance of stereotypes and cliches, character development is strong almost across the board. The Holts' relative poverty is neither romanticized nor used exploitatively; and if the Abbotts prove that money can't buy happiness, neither are they made out to be shallow or heartless.The 1950s setting is painstakingly executed as well, featuring a Smithsonian-worthy collection of period appliances, furniture and other everyday items (not to mention an authentic Greyhound bus). The lack of any racial diversity or an overtly political message about that era's injustices might be of some concern to the sensitivities of the politically correct, but the film does in fact address some such concerns (particuarlry the oppression of women) in a subtle but effective fashion.For my money, this is perhaps the most underrated movie of the 1990s.

160001,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,0793960819,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[7, 10]","This film is notable in that it does address the issue of socioeconomic class, which we Americans like to delude ourselves does not exist in our society but which always has and in all probability always will play as central a role as in any society regardless of political ideology.Two main strengths: a very strong cast (particularly Joaquin Phoenix---as well as Billy Crudup, Jennifer Connelly, Joanna Going, Liv Tyler, and Kathy Baker) and very true-to-period set pieces.  It really does look and feel like it's happening back in the mythical 1950s, such that a lot of scenes where I was expecting much stronger language and violence successfully avoided such excesses.  This seems to irk many professional reviewers, who panned this film for being bland and uninspiring---hence the shockingly low 33% rating from rottentomatoes dot com.However I found it very engaging, and of course the 2 older Abbot sisters provide plenty of tasteful eye candy (their mother too, in a cold-blooded rich-b*tch sexy kind of way, heh).  The plot was not nearly as predictable as I feared, with several surprising twists and again avoids the kind of sensationalism and viciousness that this jaded viewer was expecting.In fact while this film deals very much with issues of socioeconomic class it concludes with a surprisingly Reaganistic ending.  We see that the rich are not really as evil as we think, and that the poor become and stay poor not without fault of their own, and that if you are blessed with sufficient earnestness, industriousness and True Love like the Joaquin Phoenix character, you need only follow your heart and hallelujah ye shall too be delivered from the workers' quarter to the master's quarters with his comely daughter in tow...God bless Amurrica, yee haw!LOL I am extrapolating and exaggerating a bit, the ending is not that bad---far from Steven Spielbergian levels of cheesiness for example.

160016,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0793960819,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","Every once in a while there is a rude reminder that where I live is, relatively speaking, in the backwaters of the country.  In 1997 I must have seen the trailer for &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot; a half-dozen times, but the film never came here, so I never had to actually decide if I would pay money to see it in a movie theater or not, although clearly I took my time in getting around to finally watching it.  Of course, now the cast of &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot; is much more recognizable than it was back then, with Jennifer Connolly being an Oscar winner, Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar nominee, Billy Crudup having traded Penny Lane for a case of beer, and Liv Tyler becoming mortal to marry the King of Gondor.  But it is not that difficult to think back to when they were relatively known faces.The greatest strength of this film is the original score by Michael Kamen, which consistently gave scenes and moments of this film a power that was beyond what the script and the actors were providing.  The story is about the Abbotts, a rich family in the 1950s living in a small Illinois town with three daughters, and the Holts brothers, Doug (Phoenix&quot; and J.C. (Crudup).  The former is the narrator of the tale, while the later is &quot;addicted&quot; to the Abbotts, attempting to blot out a grievance against the family by seducing the daughters.  Doug is more fascinated with J.C.'s story than with his own, but it is Doug that is of more interest to us, especially with his affection for young Pamela Abbott (Tyler), which is momentarily forgotten for a while by his lust for Eleanor (Connelly).Basically this is a film that gives every indication that Doug and Pamela should end up together and be allowed to live as happily every after as their tortured families and histories might allow, but J.C. and his obsession keeps getting in the way.  Meanwhile some of the secrets hidden by each family are doled out bit by bit, completing the picture of the animosity that exists between the Abbotts and the Holts.  Lloyd Abbott (Will Patton) knows all about marrying into a rich family, and he is not going to allow that to happen with his daughters, but he is just one of several roadblocks that stands between any of these characters and some home of happiness.One thing for sure is that &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot; is set in a slower time.  The pacing of the film is slow, the dialogue is spoken in slow and measured terms, the narration is redundant repetitive, and you become convinced we are never going to get to where the film should end because it will slowly grind to a complete halt.  If it were not for our affection towards Pamela, Kathy Baker's performance as the boy's mom, and Kamen's score, I might have given up on this film, especially when Eleanor was shipped away by her father as soon as she had given the story some energy.  But by that time we learn that J.C. has committed the greatest possible sin against his brother, I was at least ticked off enough to stay around for the end.  The fault for this lies with director Pat O'Connor, especially since he showed in his previous effort, &quot;Circle of Friends,&quot; that he can breath live into a story.  However, he failed to do that here.",3,Things just get dragged out way too slowly in this one,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,3239,"['once', 'while', 'rude', 'reminder', 'where', 'live', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'backwaters', 'country', '1997', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'quot', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'film', 'never', 'came', 'here', 'never', 'had', 'actually', 'decide', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'not', 'clearly', 'took', 'time', 'getting', 'around', 'finally', 'watching', 'course', 'now', 'cast', 'quot', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'recognizable', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'being', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'having', 'traded', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'case', 'beer', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'becoming', 'mortal', 'marry', 'King', 'Gondor', 'not', 'difficult', 'think', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'relatively', 'known', 'faces.The', 'greatest', 'strength', 'film', 'original', 'score', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'consistently', 'gave', 'scenes', 'moments', 'film', 'power', 'was', 'what', 'script', 'actors', 'were', 'providing', 'story', 'Abbotts', 'rich', 'family', '1950s', 'living', 'small', 'Illinois', 'town', 'three', 'daughters', 'Holts', 'brothers', 'Doug', 'Phoenix', 'quot', 'J.C.', 'Crudup', 'former', 'narrator', 'tale', 'later', 'quot', 'addicted', 'quot', 'Abbotts', 'attempting', 'blot', 'out', 'grievance', 'family', 'seducing', 'daughters', 'Doug', 'more', 'fascinated', 'J.C.', 'story', 'own', 'Doug', 'more', 'interest', 'especially', 'affection', 'young', 'Pamela', 'Abbott', 'Tyler', 'momentarily', 'forgotten', 'while', 'lust', 'Eleanor', 'Connelly', '.Basically', 'film', 'indication', 'Doug', 'Pamela', 'should', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'be', 'allowed', 'live', 'happily', 'tortured', 'families', 'histories', 'might', 'allow', 'J.C.', 'obsession', 'getting', 'way', 'Meanwhile', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'family', 'are', 'doled', 'out', 'bit', 'bit', 'completing', 'picture', 'animosity', 'Abbotts', 'Holts', 'Lloyd', 'Abbott', 'Will', 'Patton', 'marrying', 'rich', 'family', 'not', 'going', 'allow', 'happen', 'daughters', 'just', 'one', 'several', 'roadblocks', 'characters', 'home', 'happiness.One', 'thing', 'sure', 'quot', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'quot', 'set', 'slower', 'time', 'pacing', 'film', 'slow', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'slow', 'measured', 'terms', 'narration', 'redundant', 'repetitive', 'become', 'convinced', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'where', 'film', 'should', 'end', 'will', 'slowly', 'grind', 'complete', 'halt', 'were', 'not', 'affection', 'towards', 'Pamela', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'performance', 'boy', 'mom', 'Kamen', 'score', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'Eleanor', 'was', 'shipped', 'away', 'father', 'as', 'soon', 'had', 'given', 'story', 'energy', 'time', 'learn', 'J.C.', 'committed', 'greatest', 'possible', 'sin', 'brother', 'was', 'least', 'ticked', 'off', 'enough', 'stay', 'end', 'fault', 'director', 'Pat', ""O'Connor"", 'especially', 'showed', 'previous', 'effort', 'quot', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'quot', 'can', 'breath', 'live', 'story', 'However', 'failed', 'do', 'here']",N/A

Probably because the first time I was too much focused on how pretty those girls were and which one of them was the sexiest -- I mean, Liv Tyler, Jennifer Connelly and Joanna Going, not Pamela, Eleonor and Alice, respectively. Watching it the second time gave me a chance to really appreciate a very good screenplay (based on a great novel by Sue Miller and enhanced by a perfect narration by Michael Keaton) as well as the finest performance of pretty much the whole cast, especially Baker and Connelly. As for Liv Tyler, I personally prefer her acting in this movie than in the overrated ""Stealing Beauty"" which was filmed one year earlier. There's a bunch of memorable scenes and lines, but I think the best ones must be Jennifer Connelly's ""hi Doug"" and Kathy Baker's ""'no matter what' kind of love""....

160024,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0793960819,Reviewer,"[14, 16]","The lives of two brothers living in a small town in Illinois are profoundly affected by an alleged incident which took place even before one of them was born, in ""Inventing the Abbotts,"" directed by Pat O'Connor.  The Abbotts are one of the wealthiest, most respected families in Haley, Illinois; Lloyd Abbott (Will Patton) is a successful businessman who, along with his wife, Joan (Barbara Williams), has raised three daughters, the oldest of whom, Alice (Joanna Going), is about to be married, while the youngest, Pamela (Liv Tyler), is about to graduate from high school.  The Holts, on the other hand, are from the other side of the tracks, and Helen Holt (Kathy Baker) has had to raise her boys on her own.  John (Billy Crudup), the oldest, was two-years-old when his father was killed in an accident, while Helen was pregnant with his brother, Doug (Joaquin Phoenix).  There's no mystery about what happened in the accident; the bone of contention concerns what happened afterwards-- at least in the eyes of John, even all these years later as he is about to enter collage.John and Doug's father, it seems, had been business partners with Lloyd Abbott, but after his death, a patent that Mr. Holt owned somehow ended up in Lloyd Abbott's name, making him a wealthy man, while the Holt's ended up in their current state of affairs-- not exactly poor, but barely making ends meet.  And since his youth, John has been fixated with the Abbotts, especially their daughters, and one in particular, Eleanor (Jennifer Connelly).  But as with most things involving an obsession, it only put John on a lifelong emotional road to nowhere.Told from Doug's point of view, the story becomes a lesson in life; when to leave the baggage of things best forgotten behind and move on.  Phoenix gives an affecting performance as Doug, who has an on-again-off-again relationship with Pamela, the one sister who is, ""Just there,"" as she says (according to her, Alice is the ""good"" one, Eleanor the ""bad"").  He captures that sense of being at an age when uncertainty is the only absolute, and you feel his need to search and seek out that toe-hold on life that is often elusive to the young.  There's an understated ring of truth in his portrayal that adds that depth which makes his character credible, and one to whom it is easy to relate.Crudup delivers, as well, with a performance wound in introspective tension so tightly that there are moments when it seems almost tangible.  He carries a burden-- that from which his obsession was born-- and it shows.  John has so much going for him (the love of his mother and brother; good looks; intelligence), that watching him suffer so emotionally-- even at arm's length-- is sad to see, especially in light of the fact that it is so unnecessary.  Still, some of his actions (especially one late in the film) are intrinsically almost too brutal to forgive; only so much, after all, can be buried amid rationalization.  In the end, you feel for him, but only so far; and then you are compelled to do what he could not-- you move on.As Pamela, Liv Tyler turns in a reserved performance that captures something of that same sense of confusion reflected in Doug's character.  A bit more grounded, perhaps, but there is still that ""searching"" going on within her.  Connelly, meanwhile, gets into her role as the""bad"" sister with relish, exuding a self-assured sexual tension qualified with just enough restraint to make Eleanor a memorable and effective character.  Going does a nice job, also, though by the nature of her character alone, she is bound to be somewhat overshadowed by Tyler and Connelly.The supporting cast includes Michael Sutton (Steve), Alessandro Nivola (Peter), Shawn Hatosy (Victor) and Michael Keaton as the narrator.  An engaging and often poignant drama, ""Inventing the Abbotts"" puts love, loss and confusion (one might say the mainstays of life) into perspective, and illustrates that how we deal with it all is not necessarily a matter of individual choice.  Some, in fact, just may have to invent whatever it is they need to hang onto.  At one point in the film, Doug says of his brother, ""If the Abbotts hadn't existed, John would've invented them.""  And maybe that's the way it is; taking life as it comes and dealing with it the best way you know how.",4,"Engaging Story, Good Performances",990835200,"05 26, 2001",2001,4309,"['lives', 'two', 'brothers', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'Illinois', 'are', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'alleged', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'even', 'one', 'was', 'born', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'directed', 'Pat', ""O'Connor"", 'Abbotts', 'are', 'one', 'wealthiest', 'most', 'respected', 'families', 'Haley', 'Illinois', 'Lloyd', 'Abbott', 'Will', 'Patton', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Barbara', 'Williams', 'raised', 'three', 'daughters', 'oldest', 'whom', 'Alice', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'be', 'married', 'youngest', 'Pamela', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'Holts', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'Helen', 'Holt', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'had', 'raise', 'boys', 'own', 'John', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'oldest', 'was', 'two-years-old', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'accident', 'Helen', 'was', 'pregnant', 'brother', 'Doug', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'mystery', 'what', 'happened', 'accident', 'bone', 'contention', 'concerns', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'least', 'eyes', 'John', 'even', 'years', 'later', 'enter', 'collage.John', 'Doug', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'business', 'partners', 'Lloyd', 'Abbott', 'death', 'patent', 'Mr.', 'Holt', 'owned', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'Lloyd', 'Abbott', 'name', 'making', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Holt', 'ended', 'up', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'not', 'exactly', 'poor', 'barely', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'youth', 'John', 'been', 'fixated', 'Abbotts', 'especially', 'daughters', 'one', 'particular', 'Eleanor', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'most', 'things', 'involving', 'obsession', 'only', 'put', 'John', 'lifelong', 'emotional', 'road', 'nowhere.Told', 'Doug', 'point', 'view', 'story', 'lesson', 'life', 'when', 'leave', 'baggage', 'things', 'best', 'forgotten', 'behind', 'move', 'Phoenix', 'affecting', 'performance', 'Doug', 'who', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'Pamela', 'one', 'sister', 'who', 'Just', 'there', 'according', 'Alice', 'good', 'one', 'bad', 'sense', 'being', 'age', 'when', 'uncertainty', 'only', 'absolute', 'feel', 'need', 'search', 'seek', 'out', 'toe-hold', 'life', 'often', 'elusive', 'young', 'understated', 'ring', 'truth', 'portrayal', 'depth', 'character', 'credible', 'one', 'whom', 'easy', 'relate.Crudup', 'delivers', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'wound', 'introspective', 'tension', 'so', 'tightly', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'almost', 'tangible', 'burden', 'obsession', 'was', 'born', 'John', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'love', 'mother', 'brother', 'good', 'looks', 'intelligence', 'watching', 'suffer', 'so', 'emotionally', 'even', 'arm', 'length', 'sad', 'see', 'especially', 'light', 'fact', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'Still', 'actions', 'especially', 'one', 'late', 'film', 'are', 'intrinsically', 'almost', 'too', 'brutal', 'forgive', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'buried', 'rationalization', 'end', 'feel', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'then', 'are', 'compelled', 'do', 'what', 'could', 'not', 'move', 'on.As', 'Pamela', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'reserved', 'performance', 'something', 'same', 'sense', 'confusion', 'reflected', 'Doug', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'grounded', 'perhaps', 'still', 'searching', 'going', 'Connelly', 'meanwhile', 'role', 'bad', 'sister', 'relish', 'exuding', 'self-assured', 'sexual', 'tension', 'qualified', 'just', 'enough', 'restraint', 'make', 'Eleanor', 'memorable', 'effective', 'character', 'Going', 'nice', 'job', 'also', 'nature', 'character', 'alone', 'bound', 'be', 'somewhat', 'overshadowed', 'Tyler', 'Connelly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Sutton', 'Steve', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'Peter', 'Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Victor', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'narrator', 'engaging', 'often', 'poignant', 'drama', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'love', 'loss', 'confusion', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'mainstays', 'life', 'perspective', 'how', 'deal', 'not', 'necessarily', 'matter', 'individual', 'choice', 'fact', 'just', 'may', 'have', 'invent', 'whatever', 'need', 'hang', 'onto', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Doug', 'brother', 'Abbotts', 'had', ""n't"", 'existed', 'John', 'would', ""'ve"", 'invented', 'maybe', 'way', 'taking', 'life', 'dealing', 'best', 'way', 'know', 'how']",N/A

160029,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,0793960819,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[36, 38]","Movie Summary: In a small 1950's Illinois town the Abbotts are the family everyone talks about. They are rich and have three beautiful daughters. Their parties are the things of legend in the town. On the other side of the tracks live the Holts. Mrs. Holt has had to raise her two sons, Jacey and Doug, by herself since her husband passed away. The Holts and Abbotts have a long history, some real, some invented. It is this history, the real and the invented, that the Holt brothers have to come to terms with before it destroys them and the Abbotts.My Opinion: This was a very engaging movie with a great cast. Kathy Baker and Joaquin Phoenix were very enjoyable. Michael Keaton's narration adds a touch that makes the movie seem better than it is. I loved the 1950's small town setting as well as the semi-complicated plot. The viewer discovers the secrets of the past at the same time as the brothers do. We see how differently each of them deals with it and get to make our own decision as well. The bothers struggle with the revelations of the past and each find a way to deal with it. It is the different interpretations and actions that each of the brothers takes that is at the core of this story. After watching the movie, I find that I liked it more while I was watching it than I do now. The plot seems to lack that big punch that would make it stay with me and taunt me to watch it again. That aside, it is still worth seeing.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 DD5.1 Picture and sound were great with no noticeable defects. Extra features consist of the trailer and a featurette. The main menu is interesting.What You Should Do:  Rent it if you are into historical pieces. It&#65533;s a decent movie but you&#65533;ll only need to see it once. This DVD release is nothing special.Related Movies To Check Out: Waking the Dead, Almost Famous, To Kill a Mockingbird, Outside Providence",4,If the Abbotts Didn't Exist Jacey Would Have Invented Them,997228800,"08 8, 2001",2001,1902,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'small', '1950', 'Illinois', 'town', 'Abbotts', 'are', 'family', 'everyone', 'talks', 'are', 'rich', 'have', 'three', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'parties', 'are', 'things', 'legend', 'town', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'live', 'Holts', 'Mrs.', 'Holt', 'had', 'raise', 'two', 'sons', 'Jacey', 'Doug', 'husband', 'passed', 'away', 'Holts', 'Abbotts', 'have', 'long', 'history', 'real', 'invented', 'history', 'real', 'invented', 'Holt', 'brothers', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'Abbotts.My', 'Opinion', 'was', 'very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'were', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'narration', 'touch', 'movie', 'seem', 'better', 'loved', '1950', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'as', 'well', 'semi-complicated', 'plot', 'viewer', 'secrets', 'past', 'same', 'time', 'brothers', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'differently', 'deals', 'get', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'well', 'bothers', 'struggle', 'revelations', 'past', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'different', 'interpretations', 'actions', 'brothers', 'core', 'story', 'watching', 'movie', 'find', 'liked', 'more', 'was', 'watching', 'do', 'now', 'plot', 'lack', 'big', 'punch', 'would', 'make', 'stay', 'taunt', 'watch', 'again', 'aside', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing.DVD', 'Quality', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'DD5.1', 'Picture', 'sound', 'were', 'great', 'noticeable', 'defects', 'Extra', 'consist', 'trailer', 'featurette', 'main', 'menu', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'are', 'historical', 'pieces', '65533', 's', 'decent', 'movie', '65533', 'll', 'only', 'need', 'see', 'once', 'DVD', 'release', 'nothing', 'special.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Outside', 'Providence']",N/A

160032,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,0793960819,S. T. Peterson,"[3, 5]","I don't know what went wrong but they really didn't develop Jacey's story so that the title and presumably the premise of this movie fit. It was supposed to be about this kid who felt sorry for himself . . . a confused kid . . . wishing he was on the ""right"" side of the tracks. He was envious of this rich family that had 3 girls. So he did what the rich family's dad said . . . he tried to sleep his way there. He actually slept with all 3 girls. But like I said this was a half baked idea of whoever created this movie. It just turned out to be another modern story that tried to tarnish the image of the 50s. It showed a promiscuous guy (JaceY) and promiscuous girls (the Abbott girls). That was pretty much the story. I seriously doubt any girls in the 1950s would tell their dad that they just slept with a guy (but not the word she used) while standing there with the guy while grabbing him between the legs. That just didn't happen. While it could happen today it would still be rare and only in certain families. But this is the kinda of stuff this movie was about. It just turned out to be a situation of a loser dad (Jacey's dad) who squandered his life and failed to capitalize on his talent for his or his family's sake. So his eldest kid picked up where his dad left off. So the kid grows up thinking the Abbots took advantage of his dad and at the same envying them. There is a sweet character in this movie and that was Phoenix's character. He was realistically portrayed as a guy of the 50s or even today I think. Also the plot around the town rumor around the mom and the Abbott guy was half baked also. So all this turned out to be in my eyes was a movie showing a sleazy kid acting recklessly on his hormones with sleazy girls.
