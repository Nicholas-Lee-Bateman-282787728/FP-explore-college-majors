In doing so, he made Rasknolikov a caricature of himself, lethargic and yet redeemable by accepting Christ's pathetic suffering. It was more appropriate to adapt Nietzsche's figure of &#34;the noble superman&#34; but Dostoevsky, at the time of his writing, was a destroyed soul, drinking and plagued by debts, a gambling and morphine addiction and on top of that, he was a converted Christian, which is to say he resembled a &#34;spineless worm&#34;.There is a powerful beginning in which the bold character Rasknolikov conceptualizes the murder of an old aged hag who serves no purpose to society but beyond that, Dostoevsky tortures us with the conscience of an obstinate man who is shattered by an insignificant crime. In all effect, Dostoevsky became an apologist not only for bourgeois values and the Czar with his corrupt regime, but for Orthodox Christianity, which not only supported the exploitation of the Russian population but welcomed it. The end of the novel, which portrays a once proud, noble, and intellectually superior young man weeping before a prostitute and the image of the bible, brings about the demise of Dostoevsky's credibility.",1,the weak tenets of Chrisitanity,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1424,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'doubt', '34', 'Crime', 'Punishment', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'novels', 'century', 'had', 'not', 'Dostoevsky', 'leaned', 'more', 'acceptable', 'sense', 'morality', 'related', 'weak', 'tenets', 'Chrisitanity', 'doing', 'so', 'made', 'Rasknolikov', 'caricature', 'lethargic', 'yet', 'redeemable', 'accepting', 'Christ', 'pathetic', 'suffering', 'was', 'more', 'appropriate', 'adapt', 'Nietzsche', 'figure', '34', 'noble', 'superman', '34', 'Dostoevsky', 'time', 'writing', 'was', 'destroyed', 'soul', 'drinking', 'plagued', 'debts', 'gambling', 'morphine', 'addiction', 'top', 'was', 'converted', 'Christian', 'say', 'resembled', '34', 'spineless', 'worm', '34', 'powerful', 'beginning', 'bold', 'character', 'Rasknolikov', 'murder', 'old', 'aged', 'hag', 'who', 'purpose', 'society', 'Dostoevsky', 'conscience', 'obstinate', 'man', 'who', 'shattered', 'insignificant', 'crime', 'effect', 'Dostoevsky', 'became', 'apologist', 'not', 'only', 'bourgeois', 'values', 'Czar', 'corrupt', 'regime', 'Orthodox', 'Christianity', 'not', 'only', 'supported', 'exploitation', 'Russian', 'population', 'welcomed', 'end', 'novel', 'once', 'proud', 'noble', 'intellectually', 'superior', 'young', 'man', 'weeping', 'prostitute', 'image', 'bible', 'demise', 'Dostoevsky', 'credibility']",Crime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries
761795,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B0000A5A1L,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[12, 22]","Crime and P. is perhaps our earliest and most elaborate interior novel, equal to James Joyce's Ulysses in this way, and written under equally incredibly severe conditions. Through it we enter the mind, heart and soul of a very complex and idealistic and intelligent and sensitive individual and share his every thought and understand his every desire and impulse.Thus, all is wrong in this BBC production. Physically Hurt looks far too old to play an idealistic and inexperienced university student, and appears like he would rather be playing K. in a remake of the Trial. Due to the lack of a narrative voice-over and the lack of a voice-over of his inner thoughts, he is left to walk around the exterior sets showing off his cute wardrobe and frowning, or to inhabit the rather barren and stagey interior sets, very artificially theatrically lit and adorned and posed with extras artificially chortling or philosophizing on cue. Hurt's various frowns and squints and tightenings without voice-over leave us wondering how much he actually is suffering from fever, or hemorrhoids, or merely acute near sightedness. We are unable to hear his thoughts and thus follow his actions and reactions, whereas the novel fully informs us from the first sentence. Here, stripped to merely the physically visible, we find his actions inexplicable, impulsive and unconvincing, especially coming from such an apparently mature man.Meanwhile, as Hurt frowns, we see various other actors with varying degrees of talent and direction chewing the scenery with emotion and force and exagerrated make up and lighting and costuming, as if to make up for Hurt's reticence. All in all, the severe production limitations placed upon Hurt leaves his character's actions superficial and arbitrary at best, and do not carry the great moral and philosophical weight laid out in the novel. None of the actors are permitted to convince us, and the amateur BBC sets leave us even less convinced. The exteriors are picturesque romps only.Bottom line: find an authoritative translation of the novel and learn to read again. Arm yourself with solid commentaries as much as able. But leave this production for another day. For the same price you can get a great copy of the book. This book is too good to be so abused and lightened.The translation used for dialogue seems stilted and hollow. ""God frowns upon the deliberate taking of any life"" sounds a lot more petty and shallow than intended; the profoundly crucial import of those words are horribly cheapened in that translation. This complex book explores many avenues very well, with that brief phrase the central moral. We agonize that what we need to hear everywhere from Iraq to New Orleans is so superficially presented here in the manner of uncomprehending sentimentalist dilettantes.",1,Dostoyevsky Lite: Demonstrates all the lobotomized limitations of our visual media and a BBC Time Life Production,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,2810,"['Crime', 'P.', 'perhaps', 'earliest', 'most', 'elaborate', 'interior', 'novel', 'equal', 'James', 'Joyce', 'Ulysses', 'way', 'written', 'equally', 'incredibly', 'severe', 'conditions', 'enter', 'mind', 'heart', 'soul', 'very', 'complex', 'idealistic', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'individual', 'share', 'thought', 'understand', 'desire', 'impulse.Thus', 'wrong', 'BBC', 'production', 'Physically', 'Hurt', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'idealistic', 'inexperienced', 'university', 'student', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'playing', 'K.', 'remake', 'Trial', 'Due', 'lack', 'narrative', 'voice-over', 'lack', 'voice-over', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'left', 'walk', 'exterior', 'sets', 'showing', 'off', 'cute', 'wardrobe', 'frowning', 'inhabit', 'rather', 'barren', 'stagey', 'interior', 'sets', 'very', 'artificially', 'theatrically', 'lit', 'adorned', 'posed', 'extras', 'artificially', 'chortling', 'philosophizing', 'cue', 'Hurt', 'various', 'frowns', 'squints', 'tightenings', 'voice-over', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'suffering', 'fever', 'hemorrhoids', 'merely', 'acute', 'sightedness', 'are', 'unable', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'thus', 'follow', 'actions', 'reactions', 'novel', 'fully', 'first', 'sentence', 'Here', 'stripped', 'merely', 'physically', 'visible', 'find', 'actions', 'inexplicable', 'impulsive', 'unconvincing', 'especially', 'coming', 'apparently', 'mature', 'man.Meanwhile', 'Hurt', 'frowns', 'see', 'various', 'other', 'actors', 'varying', 'degrees', 'talent', 'direction', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'emotion', 'force', 'exagerrated', 'make', 'up', 'lighting', 'costuming', 'make', 'up', 'Hurt', 'reticence', 'severe', 'production', 'limitations', 'placed', 'Hurt', 'character', 'actions', 'superficial', 'arbitrary', 'best', 'do', 'not', 'carry', 'great', 'moral', 'philosophical', 'weight', 'laid', 'out', 'novel', 'None', 'actors', 'are', 'permitted', 'convince', 'amateur', 'BBC', 'sets', 'leave', 'even', 'less', 'convinced', 'exteriors', 'are', 'picturesque', 'romps', 'only.Bottom', 'line', 'find', 'authoritative', 'translation', 'novel', 'learn', 'read', 'again', 'Arm', 'solid', 'commentaries', 'as', 'much', 'able', 'leave', 'production', 'day', 'same', 'price', 'can', 'get', 'great', 'copy', 'book', 'book', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'so', 'abused', 'lightened.The', 'translation', 'used', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'hollow', 'God', 'deliberate', 'taking', 'life', 'lot', 'more', 'petty', 'shallow', 'intended', 'profoundly', 'crucial', 'import', 'words', 'are', 'horribly', 'cheapened', 'translation', 'complex', 'book', 'many', 'avenues', 'very', 'well', 'brief', 'central', 'moral', 'agonize', 'what', 'need', 'hear', 'everywhere', 'Iraq', 'New', 'Orleans', 'so', 'superficially', 'presented', 'here', 'manner', 'uncomprehending', 'sentimentalist', 'dilettantes']",Crime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries

761802,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B0000A5A1L,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[11, 12]","Here we have a very excellent mini-series, all-inclusive, three episodes on one DVD (225 minutes total running time), of Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"". This movie is simply terrific and, by having twice read the book (two different translations), I can say that this film is totally true to its origin, with just a few of the less notable scenes omitted which is what one would reasonably expect.Now, the reason for my cautionary title is that ""Crime and Punishment"" is a story about the extreme misery of the Russian people, and to put this theme into historical perspective, it transpires during the era in which the U.S. Civil War was just reaching a conclusion. To summarize the Russian social environment of that same period, serfdom had just been reluctantly abolished (1863) but it actually continued on in pocket regions for a time. And times for the masses were incredibly difficult in the larger Russian cities such as St. Petersburg which is where this story mostly transpires. Large portions of the population were starving, alcoholism was rampant, and revolution was in the air, (this finally came to a head in 1905 and, successfully for the Bolsheviks [Communists] in 1917 but those two events are not directly a facet of this particular story.)So what I'm telling you is that this tale is mostly one of extreme misery and is largely responsible for the egregious myth that ALL Russian literature is equally gloomy, (a myth which can be immediately dispelled by readingThe Inspector-General,Dead Souls: A Novel,Oblomov, etc.) But ""Crime and Punishment"" is pretty depressing which is actually why it's such a great life story. So if you cannot endure such films, you'd best skip this one because in addition to all the gloom, this mini-series is quite lengthy so there's a lot of it!THE STORY: Briefly, Raskolnikov is a rather contumacious, off-and-on Russian student who faces multiple problems: his personal ethics are grossly distorted; he has no money, and; he is emotionally and physically ill.Almost at once, while raising a few kopecks by way of pawning some personal trinkets, he has an encounter with a spiteful and venomous old woman, the local pawnbroker who continually takes an abhorrently unfair advantage of everyone with whom she does business. This dreadful old hag also has a half-sister living with her, a girl of very limited intelligence whom she psychologically abuses.It's no spoiler to say that, based upon his personal philosophies about the value of various people's lives, Raskolnikov murders the old woman with a hatchet to the forehead. But unfortunately the half-sister makes an unexpected appearance during the murder and he makes the hasty decision to kill her as well, an actuality which begins to haunt him from the moment he commits the act.The entire remainder of the story is based upon this horrific act of violence, albeit there are some sub-plots, all of which heap even more burdensome stresses upon Raskolnikov. One of these side trips involves an older man by the name of Marmeladov. This venerable fellow would be a fine man were it not for his extreme and endless drunkenness which has resulted in the ruination of his entire family. In fact, his alcoholism has driven his own daughter to become a prostitute, a blameless girl with whom Raskolnikov falls in love.Finally, the highlight of the story involves the local police inspector, a man by the name of Porfiry, who epitomizes the ""Columbo"" of the Russian police! His mild and indirect (but irritating) manner of interrogation drives Raskolnikov to extreme emotional reactions and Porfiry's character adds as much to the film as it does to Raskolnikov's mental burden. It's just short of comic relief.I will have to stop at this point to avoid any major spoilers but, rest assured, this is a complex tale which is well-told via this marvelous mini-series. John Hurt plays Raskonikov and he's perfect in this role. The film is in color, the scenes and sets are nothing short of excellent, and the aspect ratio is full-frame. This last feature is the only item I'm curious about -- the packaging states ""full-screen version"" which conveys to me that there might actually exist a widescreen version, which I would very much love to view! The mini-series was directed by Michael Darlow and, of course, this is a BBC Production so all the actors are British and thus one should not expect to hear Russian accents.Highly recommended for appropriate audiences.(See my numerous Amazon Listmania lists for more Russian film and literature recommendations.)",5,Know what you are buying!,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,4566,"['Here', 'have', 'very', 'excellent', 'mini-series', 'all-inclusive', 'three', 'episodes', 'one', 'DVD', '225', 'minutes', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'Dostoyevsky', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'movie', 'simply', 'terrific', 'having', 'twice', 'read', 'book', 'two', 'different', 'translations', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'totally', 'true', 'origin', 'just', 'few', 'less', 'notable', 'scenes', 'omitted', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'reasonably', 'expect.Now', 'reason', 'cautionary', 'title', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'story', 'extreme', 'misery', 'Russian', 'people', 'put', 'theme', 'historical', 'perspective', 'era', 'U.S.', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'just', 'reaching', 'conclusion', 'summarize', 'Russian', 'social', 'environment', 'same', 'period', 'serfdom', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'reluctantly', 'abolished', '1863', 'actually', 'continued', 'pocket', 'regions', 'time', 'times', 'masses', 'were', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'larger', 'Russian', 'cities', 'such', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'where', 'story', 'mostly', 'Large', 'portions', 'population', 'were', 'starving', 'alcoholism', 'was', 'rampant', 'revolution', 'was', 'air', 'finally', 'came', 'head', '1905', 'successfully', 'Bolsheviks', '[', 'Communists', ']', '1917', 'two', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'directly', 'facet', 'particular', 'story', 'what', ""'m"", 'telling', 'tale', 'mostly', 'one', 'extreme', 'misery', 'largely', 'responsible', 'egregious', 'myth', 'ALL', 'Russian', 'literature', 'equally', 'gloomy', 'myth', 'can', 'be', 'immediately', 'dispelled', 'readingThe', 'Inspector-General', 'Dead', 'Souls', 'Novel', 'Oblomov', 'etc', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'actually', 'why', 'such', 'great', 'life', 'story', 'So', 'can', 'not', 'endure', 'such', 'films', ""'d"", 'best', 'skip', 'one', 'addition', 'gloom', 'mini-series', 'quite', 'lengthy', 'lot', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Briefly', 'Raskolnikov', 'rather', 'contumacious', 'off-and-on', 'Russian', 'student', 'who', 'multiple', 'problems', 'personal', 'ethics', 'are', 'grossly', 'distorted', 'money', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'ill.Almost', 'once', 'raising', 'few', 'kopecks', 'way', 'pawning', 'personal', 'trinkets', 'encounter', 'spiteful', 'venomous', 'old', 'woman', 'local', 'pawnbroker', 'who', 'continually', 'abhorrently', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'everyone', 'whom', 'business', 'dreadful', 'old', 'hag', 'also', 'half-sister', 'living', 'girl', 'very', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'whom', 'psychologically', 'abuses.It', 'spoiler', 'say', 'based', 'personal', 'philosophies', 'value', 'various', 'people', 'lives', 'Raskolnikov', 'old', 'woman', 'hatchet', 'forehead', 'unfortunately', 'half-sister', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'murder', 'hasty', 'decision', 'kill', 'as', 'well', 'actuality', 'haunt', 'moment', 'act.The', 'entire', 'remainder', 'story', 'based', 'horrific', 'act', 'violence', 'are', 'sub-plots', 'heap', 'even', 'more', 'burdensome', 'stresses', 'Raskolnikov', 'One', 'side', 'trips', 'older', 'man', 'name', 'Marmeladov', 'venerable', 'fellow', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'man', 'were', 'not', 'extreme', 'endless', 'drunkenness', 'resulted', 'ruination', 'entire', 'family', 'fact', 'alcoholism', 'driven', 'own', 'daughter', 'become', 'prostitute', 'blameless', 'girl', 'whom', 'Raskolnikov', 'love.Finally', 'highlight', 'story', 'local', 'police', 'inspector', 'man', 'name', 'Porfiry', 'who', 'Columbo', 'Russian', 'police', 'mild', 'indirect', 'irritating', 'manner', 'interrogation', 'drives', 'Raskolnikov', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'Porfiry', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'Raskolnikov', 'mental', 'burden', 'just', 'short', 'comic', 'relief.I', 'will', 'have', 'stop', 'point', 'avoid', 'major', 'spoilers', 'rest', 'assured', 'complex', 'tale', 'well-told', 'marvelous', 'mini-series', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Raskonikov', 'perfect', 'role', 'film', 'color', 'scenes', 'sets', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'full-frame', 'last', 'feature', 'only', 'item', ""'m"", 'curious', 'packaging', 'full-screen', 'version', 'conveys', 'might', 'actually', 'exist', 'widescreen', 'version', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'view', 'mini-series', 'was', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Darlow', 'course', 'BBC', 'Production', 'actors', 'are', 'British', 'thus', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'hear', 'Russian', 'accents.Highly', 'recommended', 'appropriate', 'audiences', 'See', 'numerous', 'Amazon', 'Listmania', 'more', 'Russian', 'film', 'literature', 'recommendations']",Crime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries
