1084077,A38J9KTPWDG6SI,B000RW3Z0I,"J. Powell ""Jimbo""","[6, 9]","I wish more documentaries about sports were like this. As well as capturing all the action from all the camera angles from NFL films, you really get a feel from inside the patriots camp of what the Super Bowl years meant to the players and coaching staff. The interviews are refreshingly insightful and honest (including some bad language) and the behind the scenes thoughts of the players and management were a joy to watch.There are plenty of extras as well to round off a truly great series. I can't recommend this highly enough to any Pats fan. I am lifelong Patriot from the UK and watching this nearly brought a tear to my eye. After all the years of suffering and losses, the big victories on here meant so much to me, it was a joy to see and hear the players and the backroom staff give their version of the proudest day of their lives, the day they became Super Bowl champions.  I liked this series so much i intend to get more America's game shows from other NFL teams. There really has been no better documentary ever made about football in my opinion.Invest in this and relive the Patriots glory years (will they ever stop?!) over and over again. priceless. The only criticism i would have is i was enjoying it so much i wished that each episode was 3 hours long.You will not regret buying this. The definitive record of some glorious, never to be forgotten times for any Patriot.",5,This is just essential viewing !!!,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,1392,"['wish', 'more', 'documentaries', 'sports', 'were', 'As', 'well', 'capturing', 'action', 'camera', 'NFL', 'films', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'patriots', 'camp', 'what', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'years', 'meant', 'players', 'coaching', 'staff', 'interviews', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'insightful', 'honest', 'including', 'bad', 'language', 'scenes', 'thoughts', 'players', 'management', 'were', 'joy', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'round', 'off', 'truly', 'great', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'Pats', 'fan', 'am', 'lifelong', 'Patriot', 'UK', 'watching', 'nearly', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'years', 'suffering', 'losses', 'big', 'victories', 'here', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'joy', 'see', 'hear', 'players', 'backroom', 'staff', 'give', 'version', 'proudest', 'day', 'lives', 'day', 'became', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'champions', 'liked', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'intend', 'get', 'more', 'America', 'game', 'shows', 'other', 'NFL', 'teams', 'really', 'been', 'better', 'documentary', 'ever', 'made', 'football', 'opinion.Invest', 'relive', 'Patriots', 'glory', 'years', 'will', 'ever', 'stop', 'over', 'again', 'priceless', 'only', 'criticism', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'i', 'was', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'wished', 'episode', 'was', '3', 'hours', 'long.You', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'buying', 'definitive', 'record', 'glorious', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'times', 'Patriot']",NFL: America's Game: New England Patriots
