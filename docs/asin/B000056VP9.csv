571228,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B000056VP9,M. Fields,"[1, 9]","Perhaps that's why there were only 2 reviews until I decided to write this one.  I suggest that Laurence Fishburne keep his day job.  You may grow weary of listening to ""Fish"" trying to effect a hispanic accent.  The story seems weak although Fishburne's acting is not.  There are 3 things you may notice in this film.  You might notice Tiger Chen who was cast in The Matrix Reloaded and was the last person to be killed by Neo in the Merovingian's mansion.  Then if your memory is good enough you may remember a piece of poetry recited here that Fishburne also used in Deep Cover.  Then if your memory is really, really good you might recognize Titus Welliver as Torch, who played a gun toting motorcycle club member in Biker Boyz.  Other than those items I'm afraid this film is not very interesting.

571230,A35ZK3M8L9JUPX,B000056VP9,"TREND700 ""TREND700""","[1, 1]","During a brief jail stay, two half-brothers, who have rarely seen each other while growing up, connect. One of them, called 20/20 Mike because he can sense people nearby, concocts a scheme in which the two of them will steal some dope from young couriers. The heist goes awry when Billy, the junkie brother, shoots the victims of the theft. The brothers hole up in an abandoned building, and 20/20 Mike seeks help from an old cell mate, Tony, whom he thinks is out of the life. It turns out that they have stolen Tony's dope, and Tony's boss wants the two thieves dead. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich&eacute;s. This movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off. Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal. Titus Welliver is fabulous as Fishburne's junky half-brother. I think the best acting in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, they paired perfectly as two of Calderon's henchmen.
