1642957,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00C70FGFU,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 1]","Ruben is a bit of a slacker, a native Frenchman who moved to Finland to start a business, but ended up just working as a mailman while shacking up with his hunky blonde boyfriend, Teemu.  Their domestic bliss hits a speed bump, when Ruben comes home with a bag of money that a resident on his route gave him, right before he keeled over, likely dead of a heart attack.  Teemu throws out Ruben, who takes the money and goes home to France, joining his large Jewish family, right before the Passover holiday.  As the only gay member of the family, Ruben has always felt like a bit of an outcast, but soon learns that there's plenty of dysfunction to go around, with his cheating father, physically-aggressive brother, overly-dramatic mother, and a sister who is trying to hide her own marital problems. Then there's their longtime family attorney, who picks him up at a gay bar and pledges eternal devotion.This is a madcap romantic comedy, capably directed and acted, although occasionally a bit over-the-top.  Positive messages about equality and relationships, suitable for mixed gay/straight viewers.  Not rated, but would be a light R for simulated sexual content, no nudity. In French (some English) with English subtitles, and I give it four stars out of five.",4,Sweetly madcap gay-inclusive romatic comedy,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,1265,"['Ruben', 'bit', 'slacker', 'native', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'moved', 'Finland', 'start', 'business', 'ended', 'up', 'just', 'working', 'mailman', 'shacking', 'up', 'hunky', 'blonde', 'boyfriend', 'Teemu', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'speed', 'bump', 'when', 'Ruben', 'home', 'bag', 'money', 'resident', 'route', 'gave', 'right', 'keeled', 'over', 'likely', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'Teemu', 'out', 'Ruben', 'who', 'money', 'home', 'France', 'joining', 'large', 'Jewish', 'family', 'right', 'Passover', 'holiday', 'only', 'gay', 'member', 'family', 'Ruben', 'always', 'felt', 'bit', 'outcast', 'soon', 'plenty', 'dysfunction', 'go', 'around', 'cheating', 'father', 'physically-aggressive', 'brother', 'overly-dramatic', 'mother', 'sister', 'who', 'trying', 'hide', 'own', 'marital', 'problems', 'Then', 'longtime', 'family', 'attorney', 'who', 'up', 'gay', 'bar', 'eternal', 'devotion.This', 'madcap', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'capably', 'directed', 'acted', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Positive', 'messages', 'equality', 'relationships', 'suitable', 'mixed', 'gay/straight', 'viewers', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'light', 'R', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'content', 'nudity', 'French', 'English', 'English', 'subtitles', 'give', 'four', 'five']",N/A

The script is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny but charmingly amusing, putting a smile on one's face that rarely fades throughout the length of the film. The Finnish boyfriend is hot, and there is one hot scene involving him and a secondary character, but for most of the film viewers are with the French Jewish protagonist and his zany family in France, with comedy, not sex, being the focus of the film. The acting is great, and so is the timing, which is always so important to comedy. It's a sweet film too.

1642959,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00C70FGFU,J. Martin,"[0, 0]","Let My People Go! is the most delightful movie I've seen in ages. Nicolas Maury is so utterly adorable, so sweetly, innocently, devastatingly sexy, so fascinating to watch every second he's on screen, that I wish he'd already starred in dozens of movies so I could watch them all. Since he hasn't, I'll have to sift through the few in which he has appeared in smaller roles.His seemingly unselfconscious charm makes this whole movie a great joy to watch, and I can't imagine it without him at its heart - but everybody else in it and behind it is so good that I'd give it a try anyway.Maury plays Reuben Steiner (spelled Ruben in the credits), a gay French Jew living in Finland with Teemu, his Finnish husband. His scheme to start a sauna business has failed and he's working as a mailman.A man on his mail route gives him an envelope containing almost 200,000 euro and then appears to drop dead. Teemu gets angry at Ruben for taking the money and kicks him out, so he returns to spend Passover with his highly eccentric but very loving family in Paris.It's a farce, much like a very modern version of a 30s screwball comedy, but all the main characters are so lovable and real that the totally unreal stuff that happens doesn't matter.There are no bad performances (his mother is played by Almod&oacute;var's longtime muse Carmen Maura), no villains in the story except a pig-headed in-law and a couple of snarky cops, but they're negligible. A scene near the end in which the rottweiler-like police chief reads Ruben's love letter (in English) to Teemu over the phone is priceless.A brilliant screenplay (co-written with director Mikael Buch by the divine Christophe Honor&eacute;), mostly in French and Finnish with fairly good English subtitles; and an interesting score with songs by Devendra Banhart, Noah and the Whale and others.I rented the movie, but I loved it so much that I've ordered a copy to watch many times over. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5,Thoroughly delightful,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1967,"['Let', 'My', 'People', 'Go', 'most', 'delightful', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ages', 'Nicolas', 'Maury', 'so', 'utterly', 'adorable', 'so', 'sweetly', 'innocently', 'devastatingly', 'sexy', 'so', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'second', 'screen', 'wish', ""'d"", 'already', 'starred', 'dozens', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'have', 'sift', 'few', 'appeared', 'smaller', 'roles.His', 'seemingly', 'unselfconscious', 'charm', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', 'joy', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'heart', 'everybody', 'else', 'so', 'good', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'anyway.Maury', 'plays', 'Reuben', 'Steiner', 'spelled', 'Ruben', 'credits', 'gay', 'French', 'Jew', 'living', 'Finland', 'Teemu', 'Finnish', 'husband', 'scheme', 'start', 'sauna', 'business', 'failed', 'working', 'mailman.A', 'man', 'mail', 'route', 'envelope', 'containing', 'almost', '200,000', 'euro', 'then', 'drop', 'dead', 'Teemu', 'angry', 'Ruben', 'taking', 'money', 'out', 'spend', 'Passover', 'highly', 'eccentric', 'very', 'loving', 'family', 'Paris.It', 'farce', 'much', 'very', 'modern', 'version', '30s', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lovable', 'real', 'totally', 'unreal', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'are', 'bad', 'performances', 'mother', 'played', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'var', 'longtime', 'muse', 'Carmen', 'Maura', 'villains', 'story', 'pig-headed', 'in-law', 'couple', 'snarky', 'cops', ""'re"", 'negligible', 'scene', 'end', 'rottweiler-like', 'police', 'chief', 'Ruben', 'love', 'letter', 'English', 'Teemu', 'phone', 'priceless.A', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Buch', 'divine', 'Christophe', 'Honor', 'eacute', 'mostly', 'French', 'Finnish', 'fairly', 'good', 'English', 'subtitles', 'interesting', 'score', 'songs', 'Devendra', 'Banhart', 'Noah', 'Whale', 'others.I', 'rented', 'movie', 'loved', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'ordered', 'copy', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
1642960,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C70FGFU,Paul Allaer,"[5, 7]","Imagine my surprise when out of the blue this weekend this movie shows up at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release announcements or ads, even more so since this movie is now almost two years old now (and being released onto DVD soon)! I figure this surely wouldn't play very long in the theatre, so I went to see it right away.""Let My People Go!"" (2011 release from France; 86 min.) brings the story of Reuben (played by Nicolas Maury), a Jewish-French guy who lives in Finland with his Finnish boyfriend Teemu. As the movie opens, we see Reuben, a mailman, making his rounds in the local town. At one point Reuben delivers a registered package to one of the locals, who upon opening the package and seeing that it is full of money, wants nothing to do with the package and tries to give it back. He and Reuben get in a tussle and the local man dies of a heart attack. In a semi-panic, Reuben decides to take the package. Back home he counts the money: 199,980 euros to be exact. Reuben and Teemu get into an argument about what to do with the money and Teemu kicks Reuben out. Distressed, Reuben takes off for France in time to celebrate Passover with his family. Alas, his suitcase (containing the money) is missing when he lands in Paris. We get to know Reuben's family (mom, dad, and a bother and sister), and they look to be a ""wild and crazy"" bunch. At this point we are about half-way into the movie. Will Reuben and Teemu reunite? Where did that money come from? Will Reuben's suitcase with the money be retrieved? How will Reuben make things work with his family? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is one heck of a wild and zany comedy that will either make you laugh out loud or otherwise may make you cringe. I found myself utterly bemused by this movie, seeing how director Mikael Buch throws one zinger after another onto the screen, sparing nothing or no-one, but always in a very clever way. There are some comedies that in reality mask some bitter undercurrents, if not worse. That surely is not the case with this movie. In fact, on more than one occasion this reminded me of the screwball comedies of yesteryear. Why this movie just now comes into the theatre here in Cincinnati, I haven't a clue, but better late than never I suppose. If you are in the mood for some truly zany, off-center comedy, I can readily recommend ""Let My People Go!"".",4,Zany French-Jewish-gay screwball comedy,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2513,"['Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'blue', 'weekend', 'movie', 'up', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'pre-release', 'announcements', 'ads', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'now', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'soon', 'figure', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'long', 'theatre', 'went', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'Let', 'My', 'People', 'Go', '2011', 'release', 'France', '86', 'min', 'story', 'Reuben', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Maury', 'Jewish-French', 'guy', 'who', 'Finland', 'Finnish', 'boyfriend', 'Teemu', 'movie', 'see', 'Reuben', 'mailman', 'making', 'rounds', 'local', 'town', 'one', 'point', 'Reuben', 'registered', 'package', 'one', 'locals', 'who', 'opening', 'package', 'seeing', 'full', 'money', 'nothing', 'do', 'package', 'tries', 'give', 'back', 'Reuben', 'get', 'tussle', 'local', 'man', 'dies', 'heart', 'attack', 'semi-panic', 'Reuben', 'take', 'package', 'Back', 'home', 'money', '199,980', 'euros', 'be', 'exact', 'Reuben', 'Teemu', 'get', 'argument', 'what', 'do', 'money', 'Teemu', 'kicks', 'Reuben', 'out', 'Distressed', 'Reuben', 'off', 'France', 'time', 'celebrate', 'Passover', 'family', 'Alas', 'suitcase', 'containing', 'money', 'missing', 'when', 'Paris', 'get', 'know', 'Reuben', 'family', 'mom', 'dad', 'bother', 'sister', 'look', 'be', 'wild', 'crazy', 'bunch', 'point', 'are', 'half-way', 'movie', 'Will', 'Reuben', 'Teemu', 'reunite', 'Where', 'did', 'money', 'come', 'Will', 'Reuben', 'suitcase', 'money', 'be', 'retrieved', 'How', 'will', 'Reuben', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'family', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'one', 'heck', 'wild', 'zany', 'comedy', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'otherwise', 'may', 'make', 'cringe', 'found', 'utterly', 'bemused', 'movie', 'seeing', 'how', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Buch', 'one', 'zinger', 'screen', 'sparing', 'nothing', 'no-one', 'always', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'are', 'comedies', 'reality', 'mask', 'bitter', 'undercurrents', 'not', 'worse', 'surely', 'not', 'case', 'movie', 'fact', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'reminded', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'yesteryear', 'Why', 'movie', 'just', 'now', 'theatre', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'suppose', 'are', 'mood', 'truly', 'zany', 'off-center', 'comedy', 'can', 'readily', 'recommend', 'Let', 'My', 'People', 'Go']",N/A

Reuben did have dreams of opening a line of swish saunas but for the time being has opted to earn his living as a postman or &#8216;posti&#8217;. Then one morning a widower refuses to accept a registered delivery of a load of cash. In the fracas he collapses after insisting the Reuben take the money.Once back with Teemu things go wrong when Reuben refuses to go to the cops. Teemu in a pique of conservative zeal insists he either fess up or he will throw him out. So alone on the street Reuben, who is also Jewish, heads home to Paris to celebrate The Passover with his family. Once there he is soon drowning in the needs of his family where he becomes a confessor and fall guy all rolled into one. His family have a few skeletons in a few closets and his mum is so brilliantly over bearing it comes as no surprise when he asks a Rabbi friend if he can become &#8216;unjewish&#8217;. The thing is he desperately misses Teemu and just wants to be happy, but will Teemu ever forgive him &#8211; and the wad of cash?This is a finely balanced and warm comedy where everyone puts in a great performance to the extent that it looks effortless. Beautifully shot and with a good soundtrack to boot this put a smile on my face and let it stay there. Nicolas Maury (&#8216;Paris Je t&#8217;aime&#8217;) as Reuben is so innocent and hapless to make anything he does seem completely forgivable, his mother is played by the wonderful Carmen Maura (&#8216;Volver&#8217; etc) who steals every scene &#8211; but in a good way. Jean-Luc Bideau as Mousier Goldberg is tremendous fun as the sexually rampant older man. This is in French with some Finnish and rather good sub titles.
