""Mannequin"" is a lovely film that includes the tried and true formula that Joan worked her magic so well on. The entire screen lights up when Joan is paired with Spencer Tracy, they had such a great working relationship that spilled over into the movie which was obvious because the story was so believable. Joan's entire supporting cast was excellent, which included her miserable family and hateful brother. Like most of her movies, perhaps ""Mannequin"" mirrored Joan's own life. A beautiful girl has aspirations of getting out of her hellish home and away from her going-nowhere boyfriend finds a rich man who wants to take care of her. In case you're wondering, the movie is titled """"Mannequin"" because Jessie (Joan's character) got a job as a ""mannequin"" (that was an antiquated term for a department store model).",5,"Joan doesn't fall for anything, because she stands for something",1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,960,"['usual', 'Joan', 'very', 'impressive', 'performance', 'care-worn', 'shopgirl', ""'30s"", 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'find', 'love', 'riches', 'Mannequin', 'lovely', 'film', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'Joan', 'worked', 'magic', 'so', 'well', 'entire', 'screen', 'lights', 'up', 'when', 'Joan', 'paired', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'working', 'relationship', 'spilled', 'over', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'Joan', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'included', 'miserable', 'family', 'hateful', 'brother', 'most', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'Mannequin', 'mirrored', 'Joan', 'own', 'life', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'aspirations', 'getting', 'hellish', 'home', 'away', 'going-nowhere', 'boyfriend', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'movie', 'titled', 'Mannequin', 'Jessie', 'Joan', 'character', 'got', 'job', 'mannequin', 'was', 'antiquated', 'term', 'department', 'store', 'model']",N/A

After a few duds (The Gorgeous Hussy and The Last of Miss Cheyney), it appeared Joan was on her way out as the box-office queen (a position she held in the early 1930s at MGM) to box-office poison!  Then she's handed what, on the surface, appears to be another formulaic shopgirl role--the kind of role that earned her legions of fans in her heyday, but one they quickly tired of after many sloppy re-hashes of the same thing over and over (silly love triangles, poor girl crosses railroad tracks to find love and wealth and happiness).The Bride Wore Red, released in 1937, was kind of a reverse of all that--it was about dreams not coming true. Sadly, it was flawed by studio writers who glossed over the vital elements of the original play to make another Crawford formula picture (it did not lose all its bite, however, and is worth a look).That left 1938's the Shining Hour as her only good film in a few seasons, but it too flopped.  Mannequin, it seems, would be more of the same, but a closer look shows that it was in fact a marvelous film, and Joan's best soap-opera weeper since 1934's Sadie Mckee (and, in some ways, even better!).Let's start with Joan's performance: she is radiant and stunningly beautiful throughout, and her acting is tender and fresh. Gone was the ""sleepwalking"" acting she seemed to be guilty of in a few earlier pictures (she blamed this on personal troubles, namely divorce, she was having at the time)--replaced by sincerity. It is a deeply-felt and engaging performance!Next, we have the wondrous, dreamy score (""Always and Always,"" a lovely song Joan actually sings for us during the course of the film--and what a voice it is). The song was a hit at the time, as was the movie. The original sheet music can still be found.The production is perfect--very glossy and reflective of the very best MGM could do. Spencer Tracy is a delight as the millionaire who loves Crawford unconditionally, willing to give all his wealth to her for nothing in return.  When he loses all his money in the end, and Crawford stays, he realizes she really does love him, too!It's a gorgeous film and a nice early Joan Crawford performance, at the height of her beauty, too.

Bernabo,"[7, 7]","Do not let the title mislead you, &quot;Mannequin&quot; is not about a store doll that comes to life, but rather about about a young woman played by Joan Crawford who cannot afford to let her true feelings show, let alone ever give in to them.  Spencer Tracy plays John Hennessey, who was born in poverty on Hester Street but who know lives on Park Avenue because of his prosperous shipping company.  Hennessey end up befriending a newlywed couple from his old neighborhood, Jessie (Crawford) and Eddie Miller (Alan Curtis).  Jessie had married Eddie to escape form her boring home life, but she soon discovers Eddie has no intention of earning an honest living, let alone ever working hard.  When Eddie notices Hennessey's interest in Jessie and his financial problems begin to grow, he comes up with a with a plan: Jessie will divorce him, marry Hennessey for his money, divorce him after six months and then rejoin Eddie.  Jessie does indeed divorce Eddie and marry Hennessey, but with no intention of ever going back to Eddie, who has gotten into bootlegging, does not like this idea and threatens to tell Hennessey of the entire scheme.  Meanwhile, Hennessey's company is facing a crippling strike which ends up forcing Jessie to decide what is more important: love or money.  This 1938 M-G-M film was directed by Frank Borzage, who does a nice job of making the more melodramatic moments of &quot;Mannequin&quot; work.  Tracy's performance is on target as always, but Crawford is the one who impresses me with her restrained performance this time around.

Sick of the life she leads, with her no account father and brother, and her mother who is little more than a slave to them, she is determined to lead a better life. Opportunity knocks when she falls in love with good looking, no account Eddie Miller (Alan Curtis) and impulsively asks him to marry her and take her away from the tenement life. He agrees, and they marry. On their wedding day they are befriended by self made millionaire John Hennessy (Spencer Tracy), who came out of the Hester Street tenement life himself.Miller sets his new wife up in a pleasant three room apartment, and she is happy, though she continues to work. She soon discovers, however, that her husband merely borrowed the apartment, when they are forced out by the tenants of record. Miller also has an aversion for an honest days work. He is the easy money type and resembles the father whose lifestyle she sought to escape. Her Eddie seems to be cut from the same bolt of cloth as her ne'er do well father.Meanwhile, Mr. Hennessey seems to have fallen for Jessie and has correctly sized up Eddie himself as a loser. Eddie and Jessie ultimately get divorced, when Eddie comes up with yet another unpalatable get rich quick scheme that even Jessie cannot stomache.After her divorce, Jessie ends up marrying Mr. Hennessey with whom she ultimately falls in love. Still, Eddie's continued presence on her horizon is like a thundercloud raining on her parade, as he threatens to destroy the happiness that she has achieved. She comes to a crossroad, however, when Hennessey's business goes belly up, and she is faced with a decision she had not anticipated having to make.This is a terrific film with  wonderful performances by the stellar cast. It is a superb, though somewhat predictable,  melodrama.

She stars as Jessie, a girl from a slum whose family does nothing to help her rise above it. She uses her boyfriend Eddie (Alan Curtis) to pull her out of it through marriage. She devotes herself entirely to him, always looking on the bright side of life. Unfortunately, he isn't the man to waste herself on. He gambles and loses her money and lies to her constantly. Still, the bonds of marriage mean a lot to her, and she sticks by his side.In comes John Hennessey (Spencer Tracy), a man who proves that a man from the slums can rise above. He falls in love with Jessie and despite her protests does all he can to be near her. As fate would have it, Jessie eventually gets wise to her husband. He attempts to get back at John for his love. He tries to convince his wife to marry John for his money and then leave him flat. She refuses and divorces Eddie, only to soon afterward find herself falling for John.The movie is the average length, but a lot happens during it. We see an unglamorous portrait of life in the 1930s and the kind of people that really existed then. Crawford doesn't parade designer clothes around, or at least is a good enough actress to attract attention away from them.

Enter Eddie Miller (Alan Curtis), who we know from the get-go is no match for Jessie but he offers to marry her and take her out of the tenement she shares with her lazy father, brother and  hardworking mother, so she jumps on the opportunity.Very quickly Jessie realizes that Eddie does not really desire an honest day's work, nor does he have a problem with his wife bringing home the proverbial bacon.Meanwhile, Eddie sees a possible big cash payday when he notices that bigwig John Hennessy (Tracy) appears to be infatuated with Jessie.  Eddie suggests that if he and Jessie divorce, Jessie can then take up with Hennessy, marry him, divorce him, collect alimony and pick right back up with Eddie.Jessie, in true good girl loving bad boy form, is horrified and promptly rids herself of Eddie.She ends up in Hennessy's arms anyway and marries him - - only to find that she truly falls in love with him.  Even Hennessy's loss of his business, putting him back in the ""working class"", doesn't dampen her affections.All in all, ""Mannequin"" is a rehashing of earlier Crawford films.  By this point, the formula is getting a bit thin and stale.  Crawford had been churning out these types of shopgirl films for nearly a decade and was hardly a ""girl"" anymore.  And despite Jessie being a poor girl, she spoke with too much refinement and looked far too classy to be appropriately working class.  Check out Crawford's earlier ""Possessed"" and ""Dancing Lady"" for a more streetwise Crawford.That aside, the film is good entertainment for Crawford's onscreen pairing (and alleged offscreen pairing, as well) with Spencer Tracy, whose deep and honest acting is almost too good for this type of worn storyline.  He and Crawford have an interesting chemistry together and he helps raise this movie over basic fluff.The other saving grace?  Crawford herself, who is lovely and sweet and even sings in this picture.  Calling her Box Office Poison back in 1938 seems unduly unjustified, particularly when she helps to bring this type of movie out of the normal cardboard cutout and give it a little pizzazz.If you are a Joan Crawford fan, or especially an unabashed one like I am, you will definitely want this movie for your viewing pleasure.  Crawford is not the younger ingenue of her earlier MGM days, nor is she yet the hardened Warner's version - - she is simply an actress perfecting her craft.Overall, the story is about three stars, but with Crawford and Tracy in the leads, I'll give it a four.",4,Crawford and Tracy Team Up in Rehashed Plot,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2786,"['Mannequin', '1938', 'offering', 'MGM', 'teams', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'first', 'only', 'co-starring', 'vehicle.Crawford', 'Jessie', 'Cassidy', 'girl', 'poor', 'side', 'tracks', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'typical', 'MGM-style', 'desperate', 'escape', 'fate', 'better', 'existence', 'Enter', 'Eddie', 'Miller', 'Alan', 'Curtis', 'who', 'know', 'get-go', 'match', 'Jessie', 'marry', 'take', 'out', 'tenement', 'shares', 'lazy', 'father', 'brother', 'hardworking', 'mother', 'opportunity.Very', 'quickly', 'Jessie', 'Eddie', 'not', 'really', 'desire', 'honest', 'day', 'work', 'have', 'problem', 'wife', 'bringing', 'home', 'proverbial', 'bacon.Meanwhile', 'Eddie', 'possible', 'big', 'cash', 'payday', 'when', 'bigwig', 'John', 'Hennessy', 'Tracy', 'be', 'infatuated', 'Jessie', 'Eddie', 'Jessie', 'divorce', 'Jessie', 'can', 'then', 'take', 'up', 'Hennessy', 'marry', 'divorce', 'collect', 'alimony', 'pick', 'right', 'back', 'Eddie.Jessie', 'true', 'good', 'girl', 'loving', 'bad', 'boy', 'form', 'horrified', 'promptly', 'rids', 'Eddie.She', 'up', 'Hennessy', 'arms', 'anyway', 'marries', 'only', 'find', 'truly', 'love', 'Even', 'Hennessy', 'loss', 'business', 'putting', 'back', 'working', 'class', ""n't"", 'dampen', 'affections.All', 'Mannequin', 'rehashing', 'earlier', 'Crawford', 'films', 'point', 'formula', 'getting', 'bit', 'thin', 'stale', 'Crawford', 'had', 'been', 'churning', 'types', 'shopgirl', 'films', 'nearly', 'decade', 'was', 'hardly', 'girl', 'anymore', 'Jessie', 'being', 'poor', 'girl', 'spoke', 'too', 'much', 'refinement', 'looked', 'far', 'too', 'classy', 'be', 'appropriately', 'working', 'class', 'Check', 'out', 'Crawford', 'earlier', 'Possessed', 'Dancing', 'Lady', 'more', 'streetwise', 'Crawford.That', 'aside', 'film', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Crawford', 'onscreen', 'pairing', 'alleged', 'offscreen', 'pairing', 'well', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'deep', 'honest', 'acting', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'type', 'worn', 'storyline', 'Crawford', 'have', 'interesting', 'chemistry', 'together', 'raise', 'movie', 'basic', 'fluff.The', 'other', 'saving', 'grace', 'Crawford', 'who', 'lovely', 'sweet', 'even', 'sings', 'picture', 'Calling', 'Box', 'Office', 'Poison', 'back', '1938', 'unduly', 'unjustified', 'particularly', 'when', 'bring', 'type', 'movie', 'normal', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'give', 'little', 'pizzazz.If', 'are', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'especially', 'unabashed', 'one', 'am', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'movie', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Crawford', 'not', 'younger', 'ingenue', 'earlier', 'MGM', 'days', 'yet', 'hardened', 'Warner', 'version', 'simply', 'actress', 'perfecting', 'craft.Overall', 'story', 'three', 'stars', 'Crawford', 'Tracy', 'leads', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four']",N/A
311088,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302413486,Simon Davis,"[18, 18]","MGM's ""Mannequin"" came along at a crucial period in Joan Crawford's illustrious career at the studio. After a dozen successful years during which Joan rescued many an ordinary script and turned it into a solid money maker she was finding that tastes were changing and with it there was a noticeable decline in her Box Office value at the studio. ""Mannequin"" stopped that decline from going any further and it was backed up the following year by Joan making the very wise career move of taking on the role of Cristal Allen in the classic ""The Women"" 1939. That ensured her another lease of life as a top MGM star in the early Forties which she consolidated with such films as ""Susan and God"" and ""A Woman's Face"".""Mannequin"" is also unique in that it displayed the only ever teaming of Joan with the great Spencer Tracy another great MGM star with years of successes behing him and ahead in the future. It is certainly the teaming of these two giants as much as the production itself which ensured that ""Mannnequin"" became the big hit that it was.The film has been passed off as yet another Crawford shopgirl melodrama where Joan climbs the ladder of success and ultimately finds herself torn between the man from her past and that of the future. While that is certainly the bare bones storyline of this film the production benefits from what I feel are sincere performances and some very good writing. Indeed the dialogue of Joan's character Jessica Cassidy has a strangely modern ring to it at times with her wanting to get on in the world on her own terms and to not be obligated to others.The earlier section of the film is very vivid in its depiction of tenement life and the desperate character who are its inhabitants, for example the characters of Joan's no good lay about father, her downtrodden world weary mother(Elisabeth Risdon in a superb performance) and in particular her cynical brother Clifford played by Leo Gorcey . Into her life comes flashy no good Eddie Miller played by Alan Curtis, who promises to never make anything of his life but at least offers her a slim hope of getting out of the tenements. They are married and on their wedding day they encounter megarich John Hennessey (Spencer Tracy) who falls immediatly in love with Joan's character. The glow of marriage soon dims for Jessica as she has to support her no good husband and finds herself turned out of the apartment which she thought was legally their home. All ends happily when after black mail attempts, John losing his business and misunderstandings Jessica finds happiness with the man who really valued her all along and in the final appropriate line tells John that he is an achiever and ""get back to work where he belongs""Joan Crawford reveals a new maturity in her acting in ""Mannequin"". Here she displays a mature and restrained performance and there is a great deal of thought gone into her characterisation. She was an actress who was expert  at reinventing herself to suit each new decade and the changing tastes of movie audiences and while ""Mannequin"" has alot of the depression era morality about it it heralds the beginning of the next phase of her career that saw her reach new heights in the early 40's. She and Spencer Tracy, not the best of friends during the making of this production, team well here and Tracey's no nonsense approach to screen acting combines well with Joan's always commanding presence on camera. It was a pity that two such great MGM stars were never teamed again.Director Frank Borzage a capable MGM director and one that guided Joan Crawford through many melodramas in the 1930's displays his sure hand here in this piece and never allows the material to get too sentimental. ""Mannequin"" has some good situations complemented by good writing and I feel this is why it rises above some other Crawford vechicles of this period. Joan for the first time also has a more mature 40's look in this film. Its as though it is anticipating her distinctive ""Mildred Pierce"" look that became her trademark in the early 40's.MGM was the ideal studio for the 1930's Joan Crawford and ""Mannequin"" provided her with her last ""shopgirl in a dilemma over men"" role. It's an interesting and highly entertaining film and will have Crawford lovers very pleased with the result.

How sad for her when she realized this same man was willing to use her to get ahead in life.  He had not counted on Spencer Tracy falling in love with her and her feelings reciprocated.  It was an interesting movie.
