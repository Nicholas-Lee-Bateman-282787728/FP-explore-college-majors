32277,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0780623088,Charles Ashbacher,"[9, 10]","While we number them, there was really only one world war in the twentieth century consisting,  of two outbreaks of intense fighting separated by twenty years of relative peace. Although when you consider the millions who died in the Soviet Union and China in those years, it is difficult to refer to it as peace. As is mentioned in this tape, the horrors of mass extermination started in the first round of fighting, with the first extermination being the Turkish slaughter of Kurdish civilians on their border with Russia.This is not an easy tape series to watch, not because it shows so much death, but due to the human face it puts on the dirty, muddy men killing each other. The description is split up into sections, some of which examine the attempts of people to cope with something that it was impossible to cope with for long. The most poignant moment is the description of the mutiny in the French army in 1917. After yet another pointless battle where hundreds of thousands died, most of the army simply refused orders to attack. Coming amidst incredible brutality, it was a rather polite revolt. In general, officers were not killed and no one went on a rampage. They simply refused to attack when they understood (correctly) that it would accomplish nothing more than more death.The fact of the revolt is not what is surprising, the astonishing part is that it took three years before it happened. As you can see from the images on these tapes, the soldiers lived for years in mud, surrounded by danger, dead bodies and excrement. The best that can be said is that it is a tribute to the resilience of the human body that even that can be tolerated for years.As difficult as it is to face, the true horrors of war must be examined by all of us. There is no magic solution to the end of wars between humans. However, it is true that understanding the consequences is the first step towards deciding that it is a poor alternative to everything else.",4,A description of endured suffering and false triumph,991008000,"05 28, 2001",2001,1961,"['number', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'world', 'war', 'twentieth', 'century', 'consisting', 'two', 'outbreaks', 'intense', 'fighting', 'separated', 'twenty', 'years', 'relative', 'peace', 'when', 'consider', 'millions', 'who', 'died', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'China', 'years', 'difficult', 'refer', 'peace', 'mentioned', 'tape', 'horrors', 'mass', 'extermination', 'started', 'first', 'round', 'fighting', 'first', 'extermination', 'being', 'Turkish', 'slaughter', 'Kurdish', 'civilians', 'border', 'Russia.This', 'not', 'easy', 'tape', 'series', 'watch', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'due', 'human', 'face', 'dirty', 'muddy', 'men', 'killing', 'other', 'description', 'split', 'up', 'sections', 'examine', 'attempts', 'people', 'cope', 'something', 'was', 'impossible', 'cope', 'long', 'most', 'poignant', 'moment', 'description', 'mutiny', 'French', 'army', '1917', 'yet', 'pointless', 'battle', 'where', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'died', 'most', 'army', 'simply', 'refused', 'orders', 'attack', 'Coming', 'amidst', 'incredible', 'brutality', 'was', 'rather', 'polite', 'revolt', 'general', 'officers', 'were', 'not', 'killed', 'one', 'went', 'rampage', 'simply', 'refused', 'attack', 'when', 'understood', 'correctly', 'would', 'accomplish', 'nothing', 'more', 'more', 'death.The', 'fact', 'revolt', 'not', 'what', 'surprising', 'astonishing', 'part', 'took', 'three', 'years', 'happened', 'can', 'see', 'images', 'tapes', 'soldiers', 'lived', 'years', 'mud', 'surrounded', 'danger', 'dead', 'bodies', 'excrement', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'tribute', 'resilience', 'human', 'body', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'tolerated', 'years.As', 'difficult', 'face', 'true', 'horrors', 'war', 'must', 'be', 'examined', 'magic', 'solution', 'end', 'wars', 'humans', 'However', 'true', 'understanding', 'consequences', 'first', 'step', 'towards', 'deciding', 'poor', 'alternative', 'everything', 'else']",N/A
32278,A16DMCKV9RMQGI,0780623088,"Continental Op ""philmarlowe39""","[9, 12]","As stated above, ""The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century"" is the best World War I documentary series out there.  This partly has to do with the high quality of the series itself.  This also is due to the unfortunate lack of quality documentaries regarding the First World War.This PBS series analyses the war not only from a historical and military perspective, but from a cultural and sociologal perspective as well.  WWI ushered in the modern age.  It brought about the collapse of four empires (Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary & Turkey), signaled the beginning of the end of the British Empire, and hinted at the Cold War and the emergence of the United States as a dominant world power.WWI also called into question man's belief that life was getting better, that people were getting nicer and that technology existed to improve people's lives, as millions of young men were slaughtered or gassed at places like Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Gallipoli for practically no reason at all.The filmmakers of this series emulate Ken Burns in their techniques.  We see multiple use of still photographs, along with quotes from the everyday people who fought in the war or who had it affect their lives.While this series is excellent, it is not without its flaws.  It is almost overwhelmingly grim (much like the war itself) and lacks the well-placed humor and beautiful music of Burns' ""Civil War"" series.Furthermore, it pays only a cursory glance at such important events such as the Battle of Jutland and Lawrence of Arabia and the Arab Revolt.  It also totally ignores Ireland's Easter Rebellion.  Maybe this was due to a lack of time, but you'd figure they could squeeze it in somewhere amongst the 8 hours.Military history buffs (which I am not one of) will be disappointed that this series doesn't go into great depths about the battle themselves.  But I ask you, what's the point of in-depth analysis of attrition warfare in the trenches?  The British, French and Germans together suffered over 1,000,000 casualties at the Somme in 1916 and the Allies advanced only 6 miles, just so you know.Anyway, this series is essential for any World War I buff and any person interested in getting to know the Great War a little better.",4,The Best WWI Documentary Series on the Market,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,2249,"['stated', 'Great', 'War', 'Shaping', '20th', 'Century', 'best', 'World', 'War', 'documentary', 'series', 'there', 'partly', 'do', 'high', 'quality', 'series', 'also', 'due', 'unfortunate', 'lack', 'quality', 'documentaries', 'regarding', 'First', 'World', 'War.This', 'PBS', 'series', 'war', 'not', 'only', 'historical', 'military', 'perspective', 'cultural', 'sociologal', 'perspective', 'as', 'well', 'WWI', 'ushered', 'modern', 'age', 'brought', 'about', 'collapse', 'four', 'empires', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Austria-Hungary', 'Turkey', 'signaled', 'beginning', 'end', 'British', 'Empire', 'hinted', 'Cold', 'War', 'emergence', 'United', 'States', 'dominant', 'world', 'power.WWI', 'also', 'called', 'question', 'man', 'belief', 'life', 'was', 'getting', 'better', 'people', 'were', 'getting', 'nicer', 'technology', 'existed', 'improve', 'people', 'lives', 'millions', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'gassed', 'places', 'Verdun', 'Somme', 'Passchendaele', 'Gallipoli', 'practically', 'reason', 'all.The', 'filmmakers', 'series', 'emulate', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'techniques', 'see', 'multiple', 'use', 'still', 'photographs', 'quotes', 'everyday', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'war', 'who', 'had', 'affect', 'lives.While', 'series', 'excellent', 'not', 'flaws', 'almost', 'overwhelmingly', 'grim', 'much', 'war', 'well-placed', 'humor', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'series.Furthermore', 'only', 'cursory', 'glance', 'such', 'important', 'events', 'such', 'Battle', 'Jutland', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Arab', 'Revolt', 'also', 'totally', 'Ireland', 'Easter', 'Rebellion', 'Maybe', 'was', 'due', 'lack', 'time', ""'d"", 'figure', 'could', 'squeeze', 'somewhere', '8', 'hours.Military', 'history', 'buffs', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'series', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'depths', 'battle', 'ask', 'what', 'point', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'attrition', 'warfare', 'trenches', 'British', 'French', 'Germans', 'together', 'suffered', '1,000,000', 'casualties', 'Somme', '1916', 'Allies', 'advanced', 'only', '6', 'miles', 'just', 'so', 'know.Anyway', 'series', 'essential', 'World', 'War', 'buff', 'person', 'interested', 'getting', 'know', 'Great', 'War', 'little', 'better']",N/A

32280,AVG8LM0ELD4IV,0780623088,Garrick Bergh,"[15, 16]",This is a truly superb documentary and ranks alongside The World At War as a 'must see' production. In particular it excels by introducing a wide variety of very relevant human interest elements as a backdrop to the  titanic events that were unfolding globally.With many of the incidents  and personalities fast receding into the mists of time it was fascinating  viewing to be exposed to the naievete of the millions who marched off  willingly into the cauldron as well as the ignorance of those left  behind.As the history of the 20th century has tended to be dominated by  material focusing on the Second World War this production covered the  events leading up to the outbreak of hostilities in a simple and  understandable fashion.The series delivers a number of additional  bonuses in that it encourages the viewer to source additional material on  the fascinating characters showcased in it - from artists and poets through  to philosophers and politicians.At the end of the century it is sobering  and chilling to note that many of the nationalities closely associated with  events that sparked ' the war to end all wars' are once again prominent in  the media in localised conflict.If 'The Great War' had come into my  possession as a work of fiction I would have struggled with its  credibility. As a documentary work - whether completely accurate or not -  it once again highlights the intensely fascinating saga of mankind's  history.,5,Superb,940550400,"10 22, 1999",1999,1446,"['truly', 'superb', 'documentary', 'ranks', 'World', 'War', ""'must"", 'see', 'production', 'particular', 'introducing', 'wide', 'variety', 'very', 'relevant', 'human', 'interest', 'elements', 'backdrop', 'titanic', 'events', 'were', 'unfolding', 'globally.With', 'many', 'incidents', 'personalities', 'fast', 'receding', 'mists', 'time', 'was', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'be', 'exposed', 'naievete', 'millions', 'who', 'marched', 'off', 'willingly', 'cauldron', 'as', 'well', 'ignorance', 'left', 'behind.As', 'history', '20th', 'century', 'tended', 'be', 'dominated', 'material', 'focusing', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'production', 'covered', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'simple', 'understandable', 'fashion.The', 'series', 'number', 'additional', 'bonuses', 'viewer', 'source', 'additional', 'material', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'showcased', 'artists', 'poets', 'philosophers', 'politicians.At', 'end', 'century', 'sobering', 'chilling', 'note', 'many', 'nationalities', 'closely', 'associated', 'events', 'sparked', 'war', 'end', 'wars', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'prominent', 'media', 'localised', 'conflict.If', 'Great', 'War', 'had', 'come', 'possession', 'work', 'fiction', 'would', 'have', 'struggled', 'credibility', 'documentary', 'work', 'completely', 'accurate', 'not', 'once', 'again', 'highlights', 'intensely', 'fascinating', 'saga', 'mankind', 'history']",N/A

I learned a lot from it; I'm very disappointed it's not on DVD or at least shown on PBS currently; and I think it would be very good and acceptable to show to students.Some are upset because the series left out many aspects of the war.  But the thesis statement of the series was ""WWI marked the first use of chemical weapons, the first mass bombardment of civilians from the sky, and the century's first genocide.""  All of these things were talked about and are modern issues we still deal with, so a viewer can relate to the program.  It would have been nice if more had been covered, but no one program can do it all.  Much like the intro statement to Ken Burns' WWII series ""The War"" which reminds us that the subject is immense and no one program can tell it all, the same is true here.A lot of things I did not know- I didn't know about the suffragist movement in Britain before the war.  I didn't know about the Christmas Truce of 1914.  Or about the genocide of Armenian Christians or the French Army's mass mutiny of 1917.  And I've never seen a WWI-WWII program that gave a voice to African French colonials like this one did.No, this program will not tell you everything about the Great War- no one program has yet.

The war was fought from 1914 to 1918. But what took place those four years would effect the entire world through the rest of the 20th century into the 21st century. And there is no documentary made more important in telling the story about that war then ""The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century"".It is a thorough look at that war and showing the events that took place in the years before the start of the first world wide war to be fought through the length of the war itself and finally to the official ending of the war in 1919 at the Paris Peace conference. Every major historical event that would occur in the previous century was a reaction to what took place both during and after the great war from the Russian revolution to the second world war to the cold war to current wars being fought in the middle east today in this century. To understand why we live in the kind of world we do today you have to study the Great War. ""The Great War"" does an excellent job of explaining all that occurred during that war to help understand better this world we live in today.That is why PBS, who was behind the production of this documentary needs to finally bring this out on to DVD. 2014 will be the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War and with now all veterans who fought in that war no longer alive the world needs this documentary to never forget what would happen during that time and that war. There is an old famous saying that those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. To forget the first world war could cause this world we live in to possibly make the same mistakes that were made then and repeat the same bloody events to the same deadly conclusions.In the meantime if you can get a copy of this on VHS then get it.

For that alone, the series deserves much praise.  Most documentaries of war give explicit detail as to troop movements and  tactics, but leave the social backdrop very much out of focus.  Here the  intent is not to be a definitive resource on the war's progress, but to  give a sense of what the war was like to endure, what effect it had on the  shape of the rest of the century, and why it started.I found it  intriguing to think of Kaiser Wilhelm as an actual person, bedeviled by  childhood ailments and childhood rivalries, rather than the simplistic  jingoistic icon he would become.  Likewise, it was interesting to have all  the major European social movements at home brought into the exposition of  what was going on at the front.  I never knew that the whole of France,  workers and soldiers alike, went on strike in the middle of the war-and  somehow managed to keep the fact from the French.  Likewise, I was  fascinated by the attempts of a lone French legislator to keep war from  starting through the use of a particularly theatrical speech in a church,  and how his ultimate murder dashed all hopes of civility.While it may be  true that this series won't offer much in the way of battlefield detail-the  producers wisely realized that there were already documentaries about  that-it does much to recreate the feel of the era.  You come to appreciate  what it was like to be alive then, both on the battlefield and at home.  It  is in short a textural experience that will leave any viewer affected by  the horror of that war, and the price the world had to pay to enter the  20th century.",5,One of the best social histories ever filmed,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1704,"['perhaps', 'only', 'filmed', 'attempt', 'weave', 'social', 'history', 'fabric', 'World', 'War', 'alone', 'series', 'much', 'praise', 'Most', 'documentaries', 'war', 'give', 'explicit', 'detail', 'troop', 'movements', 'tactics', 'leave', 'social', 'backdrop', 'very', 'much', 'focus', 'Here', 'intent', 'not', 'be', 'definitive', 'resource', 'war', 'progress', 'give', 'sense', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'endure', 'what', 'effect', 'had', 'shape', 'rest', 'century', 'why', 'found', 'intriguing', 'think', 'Kaiser', 'Wilhelm', 'actual', 'person', 'bedeviled', 'childhood', 'ailments', 'childhood', 'rivalries', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'jingoistic', 'icon', 'would', 'become', 'Likewise', 'was', 'interesting', 'have', 'major', 'European', 'social', 'movements', 'home', 'brought', 'exposition', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'front', 'never', 'knew', 'whole', 'France', 'workers', 'soldiers', 'alike', 'went', 'strike', 'middle', 'war-and', 'somehow', 'managed', 'keep', 'fact', 'French', 'Likewise', 'was', 'fascinated', 'attempts', 'lone', 'French', 'legislator', 'keep', 'war', 'starting', 'use', 'particularly', 'theatrical', 'speech', 'church', 'how', 'ultimate', 'murder', 'dashed', 'hopes', 'civility.While', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'way', 'battlefield', 'detail-the', 'producers', 'wisely', 'realized', 'were', 'already', 'documentaries', 'that-it', 'much', 'recreate', 'feel', 'era', 'come', 'appreciate', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'alive', 'then', 'battlefield', 'home', 'short', 'textural', 'experience', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'affected', 'horror', 'war', 'price', 'world', 'had', 'pay', 'enter', '20th', 'century']",N/A
