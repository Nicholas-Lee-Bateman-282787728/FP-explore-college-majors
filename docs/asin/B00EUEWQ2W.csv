1668775,A2ZPZE3I9VHVA7,B00EUEWQ2W,boc_spectre,"[0, 0]","I wonder who on earth would sit on live concert footage of Deep Purple v.4 line up for 29 years? I sifted through the notes and gleemed out this was recorded in Australia and it probably sat in some closet for the last nearly three decades. It is 5 by 7 full screen format which is no wonder since it is this old. The dynamics are a bit flat for today's systems but it is in wonderful DTS. What is really weird for me is that I own a DVD 1982 aniversary concert on which Richie Blackmore throws a complete temper tantrum on stage making a complete ass of himself but weirdly the concert still comes off ok due to the stoic performance of keyboardist Jon Lord. The comments of the band taken after the performance gives you the impression they would never tour with him again. He did cancel all his Asian dates which had sold out & cost the band a great deal of cash. Yet they forgive, forget, and forge out yet another whole album and tour. This is the Perfect Stranger tour and they do five songs from the new album. Hammer in a few covers from other bands & you get the impression they were none too keen on playing Deep Purple Classsics",4,This is a great concert in 1986...,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1139,"['wonder', 'who', 'earth', 'would', 'sit', 'live', 'concert', 'footage', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'v.4', 'line', '29', 'years', 'sifted', 'notes', 'gleemed', 'out', 'was', 'recorded', 'Australia', 'probably', 'sat', 'closet', 'last', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', '5', '7', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'wonder', 'old', 'dynamics', 'are', 'bit', 'flat', 'today', 'systems', 'wonderful', 'DTS', 'What', 'really', 'weird', 'own', 'DVD', '1982', 'aniversary', 'concert', 'Richie', 'Blackmore', 'complete', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'stage', 'making', 'complete', 'ass', 'weirdly', 'concert', 'still', 'off', 'ok', 'due', 'stoic', 'performance', 'keyboardist', 'Jon', 'Lord', 'comments', 'band', 'taken', 'performance', 'impression', 'would', 'never', 'tour', 'again', 'did', 'cancel', 'Asian', 'dates', 'had', 'sold', 'out', 'cost', 'band', 'great', 'deal', 'cash', 'forgive', 'forget', 'forge', 'out', 'yet', 'whole', 'album', 'tour', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'tour', 'do', 'five', 'songs', 'new', 'album', 'Hammer', 'few', 'covers', 'other', 'bands', 'get', 'impression', 'were', 'none', 'too', 'keen', 'playing', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Classsics']",Perfect Strangers - Live

Although that comes from another show and a different line-up, you might as well because the band is absolutely on fire. The new songs mix well with the old and everybody gives it everything. Even Blackmore gets stuck in and the trade-off between him and Gillan in Strange Kind of Woman is a pleasure to watch.I saw this band first in '74 and then again in '85 at the Hollywood Sportatorium. I remember nothing about it except that the band was in top flight so it's really good to be able to fill in some gaps.Infinitely better than the Knebworth thing; Blackmore's playing here is so crisp and clear and Paice, Lord and Glover rock. Gillan does sound a little raspy but, even so, what a performance. Buy this one.

1668779,A2S1TT4ZIKGYND,B00EUEWQ2W,"herb ""nice name huh?""","[59, 62]","I may be the first review to have actually watched this DVD. Very difficult to review this product. On one hand you have a band who are trying harder than I have ever seen them try. (And I have seen them many times) The Director and the overall intention in filming this performance are another story. In some ways this has a slight ""budget feel,"" even for 1984. At times it almost appears as though it was filmed for the band only, as there is no crowd featured, no keyboard views ,and no behind the drums footage. During ""Child in Time"" the Director reacted like a fish seeking a lure, as everytime Gillan played percussion he couldn't resist the shiny bongos! This occurred at a high cost too, as many times Blackmore was just flying on solos. (but he kept cutting to the congas.) (A bit like the Denmark footage from the early 70's at times) Fear not though!!...even with this dynamic there ARE plenty of times when Ritchie is featured during solos! It just could have been ""smarter."" To be fair this was 1984 and a long way from home ,so perhaps I am being a bit too hard on the Director Camera choices?This comment is going to upset people but this show was filmed at a time when Ian Gillan still had his voice. Gillan gave it his all and Blackmore reciprocated. It was only later that Gillan's drinking/smoking and all night parties cost him his voice (and subsequently Blackmore's respect. ""Come Hell or High Water) I know, I can see the comments coming on how Blackmore did this and did that. For me after seeing the band many times, Blackmore was right.The good news is that Gillan and Blackmore in particular are just incredible on this DVD! Of course the rest of the band are great too,..especially Paice, but it's the Gillan/Blackmore show on this night. What a shame there are no angles of Lords keyboard playing :( Again, what were they thinking when they decided to shoot this? Why no close ups on the keyboards and drums?For Gillan fans this is also the last opportunity to see Gillan doing justice to ""Child in Time""- he just kills it!To recap, the editing is a bit weird, the sound is ""good but NOT state of the art"" and there is no real lighting and or ambience. I would rate the picture a 6 or 7 and the sound a 6 or 7. DO NOT GET ME WRONG THOUGH! It IS worth having but it is a compromise production- wise. This DVD shows why Deep Purple were so highly regarded. Too bad it wasn't a bigger budget and with a Director who had a more systemic feel of Deep Purple's musical dynamics. This is a perfect companion piece to Rainbow ""Black Masquerade"" for the Blackmore fanatic. I MUST recommend it for serious fans of the band. You will not see Blackmore happier on stage. (He doesn't leave the stage as much and plays through songs more thoroughly than in later years) As a side note: One thing that doesn't get mentioned much is Blackmore's stage presence. He hardly looks at his guitar and seems to make his actual playing seem effortless. He is very theatrical in the way he uses the stage too.The ""extras"" are what is called a ""Tour documentary."" It is basically what looks like second generation interviews from the reunion and a bit of studio footage from Vermont, which was some of the same imagery taken from the video of the song ""Perfect Strangers."" There is a new section I had never seen before which was interesting as it showed them jamming/ recording. The footage just sort of fizzles out in the end. Cool to have but not very well planned. This DVD belongs in your collection. *Anyone expecting ""state of the art recording and camera work"" should spare us the complaining by staying clear. Five stars for the band and perhaps two or three for the Director.",4,You will not see DP try harder than they do here,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,3689,"['may', 'be', 'first', 'review', 'have', 'actually', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Very', 'difficult', 'review', 'product', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'harder', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'try', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Director', 'overall', 'intention', 'filming', 'performance', 'are', 'story', 'ways', 'slight', 'budget', 'feel', 'even', '1984', 'times', 'almost', 'was', 'filmed', 'band', 'only', 'crowd', 'featured', 'keyboard', 'views', 'drums', 'footage', 'Child', 'Time', 'Director', 'reacted', 'fish', 'seeking', 'lure', 'everytime', 'Gillan', 'played', 'percussion', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'shiny', 'bongos', 'occurred', 'high', 'cost', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Blackmore', 'was', 'just', 'flying', 'solos', 'kept', 'cutting', 'congas', 'bit', 'Denmark', 'footage', 'early', '70', 'times', 'Fear', 'not', 'even', 'dynamic', 'ARE', 'plenty', 'times', 'when', 'Ritchie', 'featured', 'solos', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smarter', 'be', 'fair', 'was', '1984', 'long', 'way', 'home', 'perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'Director', 'Camera', 'comment', 'going', 'upset', 'people', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'time', 'when', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'still', 'had', 'voice', 'Gillan', 'gave', 'Blackmore', 'reciprocated', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'Gillan', 'drinking/smoking', 'night', 'parties', 'cost', 'voice', 'subsequently', 'Blackmore', 'respect', 'Come', 'Hell', 'High', 'Water', 'know', 'can', 'see', 'comments', 'coming', 'how', 'Blackmore', 'did', 'did', 'seeing', 'band', 'many', 'times', 'Blackmore', 'was', 'right.The', 'good', 'news', 'Gillan', 'Blackmore', 'particular', 'are', 'just', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'course', 'rest', 'band', 'are', 'great', 'too', '..especially', 'Paice', 'Gillan/Blackmore', 'show', 'night', 'What', 'shame', 'are', 'angles', 'Lords', 'keyboard', 'playing', 'Again', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'decided', 'shoot', 'Why', 'close', 'ups', 'keyboards', 'drums', 'Gillan', 'fans', 'also', 'last', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Gillan', 'doing', 'justice', 'Child', 'Time', 'just', 'recap', 'editing', 'bit', 'weird', 'sound', 'good', 'NOT', 'state', 'art', 'real', 'lighting', 'ambience', 'would', 'rate', 'picture', '6', '7', 'sound', '6', '7', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GET', 'ME', 'WRONG', 'THOUGH', 'worth', 'having', 'compromise', 'production-', 'wise', 'DVD', 'why', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'were', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'bigger', 'budget', 'Director', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'systemic', 'feel', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'musical', 'dynamics', 'perfect', 'companion', 'piece', 'Rainbow', 'Black', 'Masquerade', 'Blackmore', 'fanatic', 'MUST', 'recommend', 'serious', 'fans', 'band', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'Blackmore', 'happier', 'stage', ""n't"", 'leave', 'stage', 'much', 'songs', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'later', 'years', 'side', 'note', 'One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'get', 'mentioned', 'much', 'Blackmore', 'stage', 'presence', 'hardly', 'guitar', 'make', 'actual', 'playing', 'seem', 'effortless', 'very', 'theatrical', 'way', 'stage', 'too.The', 'extras', 'are', 'what', 'called', 'Tour', 'documentary', 'basically', 'what', 'second', 'generation', 'interviews', 'reunion', 'bit', 'studio', 'footage', 'Vermont', 'was', 'same', 'imagery', 'taken', 'video', 'song', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'new', 'section', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'interesting', 'showed', 'jamming/', 'recording', 'footage', 'just', 'sort', 'fizzles', 'out', 'end', 'Cool', 'have', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'planned', 'DVD', 'collection', '*Anyone', 'expecting', 'state', 'art', 'recording', 'camera', 'work', 'should', 'spare', 'complaining', 'staying', 'clear', 'Five', 'stars', 'band', 'perhaps', 'two', 'three', 'Director']",Perfect Strangers - Live

I recently listened to an interview with Ian and he discussed Richie and how they would never cross paths or speak ever again, and that is just the way it is.

Their amazing album, &#34;Perfect Strangers&#34; was a huge early 80's hit and a sellout tour followed. Back then, live shows were recorded on 16mm or 35mm film stock and it captured the rich colors and added a better viewing experience than early 80's cheap-ass videotape which would 'bleed' when the camera had to move or pan and the stagelights would streak across the screen. Purple is in fine form and Richie Blackmore shows why he's a legend in his own right.  ( Richie, could you please, please make an exception and appear on That Metal Show? Even by Skype.

1668784,A3KS6YCXTJIAK0,B00EUEWQ2W,Patrick R. Renau,"[0, 0]","I'll preface my review with some background:1970 First heard Deep Purple In Rock1972 First time saw Blackmore live 20 feet away1976 First time met Ritchie on Rainbow tour1978 Attended the Rainbow King Biscuit Flower Hour Performance in Atlanta's Omni (utube it!)1978 First time received back stage / on stage access through mutual friends in Rainbow and Black Sabbath1984 Saw Perfect Strangers Tour in Worchester, MA and Cincinnati1987 Saw House of Blue Light Tour in St. Louissince -  Light correspondence with Ritchie's mother-in law /  production manager Carole Stevensnext - Will see Ritchie in Alexandria, VA May 20th for the first time in 27 years...This Australian concert is unique for many reasons:  the lack of documentation at that time; the genuine comraderie between performers (even though Ritchie didn't attend pre-tour press conference, touche man-in-black); and there are many special moments not ever heard before where the band was not just on, but had something new to offer and any true Purple fan needs as much of those moments as they can get in confirming that, when on, they were perhaps the best live act in rock.This was much better than the Paris 1985 recording that is out there and better than Blackmore's farewell ""Come Hell and High Water"".  I have to disagree with some reviewers about Gillan, sorry folks, his voice peaked in - are you sitting down - in 1972/73, he knows it, Ritchie knows it and you should know it.  It is painful, at times, to listen to him even here in '84, but I'll be nice and stop there.  Paicey is consistent, one of my favorite drummers ever. Glover does his job and Lord was a legend in his field.  Ritchie had my eyebrows up several times and that did not happen many times in the 80s. I was pleased for him, that this may have been his last gasp of happiness with MKII.  I read soon after they had to do Smoke on the water without him on one particular show.Ritchie Blackmore, taken as a whole, is the greatest rock guitarist of all time.  Malmsteen has mind-bending speed - too much actually, as it gets in the way of his ability to write a lot of great songs. Jan Akkerman of Focus fame possesses versatility and skill beyond comprehension and never gets mentioned in the press. But Blackmore is it, at his peak, when he had the killer instinct - early Purple 1970/72, and when he got it again with early Rainbow 1976/78. Any footage of Ritchie is treasured, it has the potential of the past in the blink of an eye.

Actually, exceptional based on being filmed in the mid 80's. For a film that's basically 30 years old, there will be some limitations and that should be expected. But all things considered, it cleaned up very well and was an enjoyable viewing/listening experience.

This was a very good concert and the Band was really on fire. This is one of the first of the reunion concerts, though you could not tell it. They had such chemistry playing live. Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice are such great musicians. They were the instrumental core of the Band and they have never been matched by any other Rock Band in their ability to play and create huge excitement live. Now with that said. There are some flaws in the footage. The camera work or editing was not always too good. During the keyboard solos, the camera is wondering around filming the other members. But that's a small criticism. My other criticism, was the sound of Blackmore's guitar in the 80's. It was not as tight as the 70's or the 90's. Amazingly some of his greatest live work is from the Deep Purple tours of 91 and 93. Check out the Stuttgart Germany show of 1993. Some of his most molten and tight playing He ever put down. But in the 80's, he was sometimes unfocused and a bit sloppy at times, live. Still there is some fantastic work from him in this show. The man was a Rock giant, who could bring a listener to a mental state of inciting a riot. The solo from Jon Lord is also just fantastic. He is my favorite musician of all time, and He is really missed. He died in 2012. Any dvd with him playing is worth the purchase, in my opinion. So in the end, I give it 4 as opposed to 5 stars, for the reasons mentioned above. Its a very good show and its worth having in your Rock collection.

1668791,A17Z53UM2E111A,B00EUEWQ2W,T. P. Watt,"[3, 3]","Good stuff with this release. There were some other Deep Purple shows (and clips of shows) from the 1984/1985 Perfect Strangers reunion tour floating around out there for years, on both bootleg and offical releases. However, either the quality of the bootlegs left something to be desired, or (in the case of the offical releases i.e. Live and Rare) it was only a few tunes and was taken from shows in 1985 where Ian's voice was a bit knackered. Some of my appreciation is a bit nostalgic, since I saw the band on this tour in Providence, Rhode Island in 1985 (had to smile when seeing this was the case with another reviewer): easily the loudest band I've ever seen live. However, even beyond this qualification, this 1984 show is a fine release. It's early on in the tour, so Ian is in fine vocal form. The band is spot-on. It's still fairly early on in the reunion, so Ritchie and Ian haven't yet burnt-out on the sight of one another and subsequently Ritchie AND Ian are both (as yet another reviewer said) making a real effort here. It must be said that Lord, Glover and Paice were virtually always consistently great live, but the difference between a good Purple show and a great Purple show post-1984 always seemed to rest on if Ian's pipes were up to the job and if Ritchie decided to apply himself on a particular night or sort of phone his performance in. Well, thankfully at this show on the dvd all 5 of the band are charging full-steam ahead. It's frankly nice to have a pro-shot gig in full with a crisp, clear mix from this tour finally made available. If you're a Deep Purple fan, you'll want this in your collection.
