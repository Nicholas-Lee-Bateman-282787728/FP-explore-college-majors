A grandfather is given a chance to help his children and does some surprising things. It has funny, cute moments as well as some action. It is not a technologically sophisticated film, since it was filmed in the 70's I believe, but the story is endearing, is about loss and peace and family.",5,Great family movie,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,391,"['LOVE', 'film', 'never', 'forgetting', 'family', 'about', 'forgiveness', 'patience', 'grandfather', 'given', 'chance', 'help', 'children', 'surprising', 'things', 'funny', 'cute', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'not', 'technologically', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', '70', 'believe', 'story', 'endearing', 'loss', 'peace', 'family']",Windwalker VHS

This is one of the most realistic portrayals of Native American Indian life, ever made. Trevor Howard, although mis-cast, does a very convincing job of potraying 'Windwalker', the aged, 18th century, Cheyenne warrior about to die. Actually, he's left on his grave, and thought dead already, by his family...who leave camp to head south for winter. But is he really dead? He still has one thing left to do...find his long lost son, who was captured by the Crow, as a young boy. He arises to rejoin his family, and tells his life's story to his two grandsons and daughter-in-law. But a Crow raiding party is on their trail. Then things really get interesting!Not for the little ones, as it does contain some violence and even an attempted rape scene. But overall it's well worth letting older children watch and learn from. Lots of good lessons on life here! Trevor Howard is amazing. You will completely forget he's a white Englishman! I have always loved this rare gem of a film.Dialogue is in Cheyenne (Tsitsista), with English subtitles.***** 5 BIG Stars!

334938,A142UV53K381N9,6302795575,David H. Birley,"[1, 5]","Kieth Merrill is a truly gifted film maker. His camera work takes advantage of the extraordinary scenery of Utah to present this tale with scenes that are truly reminiscent of the oil paintings of Frederick Remington. Unfortunately his artistry with the camera is not matched by artistry in story telling. This is an astoundingly confusing story line that pops back and forth between present time and flashback. The relationships of the characters are complicated by a lack of explanation for how they came to be in a scene. Trevor Howard has momentary flashes of the acting skill that made him a screen idol fifty years back, but this is an over the hill actor picking up a paycheck for the most part. There are scenes that are more reminiscent of professional wrestling than of what the story is supposed to be showing. I gave up after more than an hour of watching, so I have no idea whether the story comes to any satisfactory conclusion -- its plodding along and unending bad guys vs. good guys approach turns it into a snoozer, If you want to see Kieth Merrill telling a story well, tryTwelve Dogs of Christmas-- developed as a seasonal tale primarily for families with young children, it is entertaining.

Is the story any good? Eh...it's okay...a little cheesy. The way the story is handled is also a mixed bag...uneven production quality, uneven acting and casting, terrible music, sometimes good - sometimes wretched cinematography (hello gauzy flashback), editing that is alternatively decent and lacking, a few plot holes here and there. You'll note that legendary actor and drunken fool, Trevor Howard, carries top billing despite being terminially caucasian. The old man does okay, but the film doesn't really focus on him as much as you expect. Creepy Billy Drago is also oddly present -most people remember him from The Untouchables as the creepy  Frank Nitti. Then there's James Remar, playing the young Trevor Howard, who's career hasn't done so much after the promising debut (?) in Walter Hill's The Warriors. Remar does decently and at least looks Native American. Ish.On the plus side, some of the stunts were faily impressive, the landscape nice enough, the kids are cute and courageous and it's authentic as a motion picture has come to portraying how the Native Americans lived amongst themselves.The terrible wigs were a distraction.Also, I note that this movie was released as a ""PG"", even though there are multiple killings (slightly graphic) and two attempted rapes....parents with the small kids looking for some wholesome entertainment are forwarned.The DVD quality is decent, though that still doesn't change the terrible score.Rent before you buy, unless you're a freak for either Native American Anthropology or Trevor Howard wearing a big ol' bearskin.Final note: One of the most irritating things about Amazon reviews is the way people give movies they ""like"" 5 stars and movies they don't one star. Then some people try to tip the scales back to something reasonable by giving it a one star. Oy. This is a three star movie through and though. It is by no means a masterpiece, nor is it a total waste. It's worth your time, but it is no Seven Samaurai. I noticed a number of reviewers here listing it as their favorite movie...ever (!).

The scenery is incredible; the story is wonderful. This film shows the Native American family as it's meant to be viewed, and the story is touching. This is a classic film that will be sitting on your shelf between Princess Bride and Dances with Wolves; it's not one of the movies you'll watch once and put away. Your kids will choose to see it again and again on family night. (and you'll be sitting right there just as enthralled each time as they are) Great movie for Native American history buffs as well as people who enjoy horses. An exciting story with a surprise ending. If you don't buy this movie for your family, someone needs to give you a very painful wedgie... I strongly suggest you buy TWO of these as you will love it so much you'll want to share it with someone else - and as we both know when you loan a movie you rarely get it back!

This is the special edition and it was released in full frame/pan and scan. Why would a special release of a film not contain the original format? It was a theatrical presentation and was presented in widescreen or letterbox so go figure. All I know is that I won't purchase this film until it gets the treatment it deserves and the distributors of the film stop treating the public as if they are idiots.
