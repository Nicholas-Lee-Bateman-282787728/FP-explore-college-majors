908055,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0009MAPE0,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[18, 18]","This review is not about the series in general. Chances are, anyone who is interested in this product knows a great deal about the series; how good Irresponsible Captain Tylor is, and how legendary it has become as one of the defining series in anime. I will say that this series was good enough for me to watch episodea entirely in Japanese, without knowing a word of what they were saying because the International Channel didn't have subtitles.No, this review is about the box set. And boy is it one heck of a set indeed. Not only does it come with the entire TV series on four DVDs, but it has the original soundtrack for the TV series, two supplemental material discs, which adds to what already comes on the series discs (when added together, the total viewing time is over fifteen hours), and two hardback books, one being the first volume of a novella--the second half of this is in the OVA Ultimate Collection, which I also highly recommend--and a book of production material and facts about Irresponsible Captain Tylor and its creators. All of this comes in a sturdy box about the height of a CD but about eight-times thick, and each separate item comes in its own pack. And for less than a hundred bucks.This is just not a box set that should be missed, especially if you're a fan of Irresponsible Captain Tylor, or of anime in general. The value, the content, and the quality put into making this product is apparent, and though the size of the box may throw some people off, you'll quickly get used to this. In fact, I'll bet you'll start wishing that every box set came as cram-packed as this one. And if you get this, I highly recommend also purchasing the OVA Ultimate Collection.",5,The Best Box Set Ever,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1696,"['review', 'not', 'series', 'general', 'Chances', 'are', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'product', 'great', 'deal', 'series', 'how', 'good', 'Irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'how', 'legendary', 'become', 'one', 'defining', 'series', 'anime', 'will', 'say', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'episodea', 'entirely', 'Japanese', 'knowing', 'word', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'International', 'Channel', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'subtitles.No', 'review', 'box', 'set', 'boy', 'one', 'heck', 'set', 'indeed', 'Not', 'only', 'come', 'entire', 'TV', 'series', 'four', 'DVDs', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'TV', 'series', 'two', 'supplemental', 'material', 'discs', 'what', 'already', 'series', 'discs', 'when', 'added', 'together', 'total', 'viewing', 'time', 'fifteen', 'hours', 'two', 'hardback', 'books', 'one', 'being', 'first', 'volume', 'novella', 'second', 'half', 'OVA', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'book', 'production', 'material', 'facts', 'Irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'creators', 'sturdy', 'box', 'height', 'CD', 'eight-times', 'thick', 'separate', 'item', 'own', 'pack', 'less', 'hundred', 'bucks.This', 'just', 'not', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'anime', 'general', 'value', 'content', 'quality', 'put', 'making', 'product', 'apparent', 'size', 'box', 'may', 'throw', 'people', 'off', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'get', 'used', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'bet', ""'ll"", 'start', 'wishing', 'box', 'set', 'came', 'as', 'cram-packed', 'one', 'get', 'highly', 'recommend', 'also', 'purchasing', 'OVA', 'Ultimate', 'Collection']",N/A

Lazy and irresponsible to a fault, he none the less manages to defeat enemy after enemy, through a combination of astounding luck and planned self-interest.The greatest part of the series is the character interactions, from the XO who constantly takes tranquilizers and stress tank treatments to put up with Tylor, to the ships doctor who measures his time sober with a 24 hour hourglass, the characters manage to create some decent laughs and push the story forward.Despite being a little low key on the action, what does occur is always apropos to the episode overall.

Yeah, so the titular character gets by through the whole series - war, political conflicts, terrorist attacks, assassination plots - on dumb luck, charm, and an easy-going attitude; yet, there is also something a bit deceptive about his way of being that other characters note as well: he just might be fooling everyone and he actually does have a plan of action! Either way, it makes for a funny and memorable series.The quality of animation was good - these were still hand-drawn! - and the character designs were decent. The theme songs were catchy and the voice acting was also good. The special features on the disc go further in-depth to describe the more subtle humour that has cultural references (so you'll learn a coupla things about Japanese culture).

908063,AFV2584U13XP3,B0009MAPE0,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]",The first and utmost about the series is that while it isn't horribly bland or has a bad storyline or characters is that it feels a little too toned down somewhat with both its humor and action.  The second is while it's announced that the series has been remastered I really didn't see to much of a difference between this set and the previous release set that came out a couple of years earlier. The voice cast for the subbed and dubbed did a decent job and the soundtrack fits the series nicely. The major problem I had with the series is the humor it felt to flat and generic to other comedy series that had come out at the same time as this series. If you can get the set for $30 dollars or less you'll get a bargain anymore and you might feel a little cheated.

In most series what happens in one episode stays in that episode or remembered via flashbacks.  In Captain Tylor characters actually talk about past adventures or mention how their captain behaved in some certain situation, making the 26-episode series a whole.The characters are well drawn and developed during the series.  Almost all of the minor characters contribute to the story, some do feel very cliche but likeable nonetheless.I also loved the animation style, its definely old-school, none of that CGI crap.  Not that I'm against it but I have seen some CGI stuff terribly gone wrong, or wasted on crappy subject matter.  The ships and the characters are very well designed.  The Soyokaze, Captain Tylors ship, looks like a WW2 u-boat, has that nostalgic look.On a minor note, this series and the movie ""Down Periscope"" has a lot in common. Coincidence, I can't be sure.  But if you liked one of them you will love the other.Finally, before I forget, I have seen many, many animes and this series has one of the best endings I have seen, loved it, definetly.
