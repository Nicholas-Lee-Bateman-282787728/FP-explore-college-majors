684820,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B00005UQ6G,Alexiel,"[20, 21]","This movie gets a bad rap for a couple of reasons. It's sort of a cheesy horror movie, and some people feel it's a cheat. But I don't grade movies like this against movies like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Shawshank Redemption."" I grade them on what they're trying to do and how successful there are. This movie doesn't have a lofty aim or a lot of ambition, so I'm not going to rip it apart for not being high art. It does what it wants to quite well.Personally, I thought this was a better horror movie than any of the House of The Dead, Jeepers Creepers, Alone In The Dark, or House of 1000 Corpses bottom feeders. And to be totally honest, this movie has far fewer cheats in its explanations and mechanisms than say, ""Momento"" or ""Mullholland Drive."" So I don't see what people are complaining about. If this were a David Lynch movie, people wouldn't be crying that the movie makes no sense, they'd be lauding how subtle and brilliant it is for not ""spoon-feeding you all the answers."" But I digress.Soul Survivors is about a college girl who loses her boyfriend in a car crash coming home from a rave with her friends. She's heartbroken. Then weird things start to happen. Crazy looking guys chase her around, then vanish. Her dead boyfriend begins to visit her with eerie messages. The plot thickens from there, and of course all is not what it seems.Personally, I think this is a pretty entertaining and interesting movie. The casting is very good. Melissa Sagemiller makes a good lead character, Luke Wilson is great as the sympathetic priest, Wes Bentley is good as the ostensibly nice but somewhat sinister friend, Eliza Dushku may never have been more gorgeous in her entire career as the wild child best friend who is of little help to her grieving friend and gets involved in some pretty strange situations. The setting for the rave that is revisited a few times is also gorgeous.I could go on and on, but in short, I think this is a good movie that achieves what it sets out to. It doesn't have half as many cheats as more artistic and ambitious movies, the casting and setting are great, and you could do a lot worse in this genre. 4 stars.",4,Not bad at all.,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,2149,"['movie', 'bad', 'rap', 'couple', 'reasons', 'sort', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movie', 'people', 'feel', 'cheat', 'do', ""n't"", 'grade', 'movies', 'movies', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'grade', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'do', 'how', 'successful', 'are', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'lofty', 'aim', 'lot', 'ambition', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rip', 'apart', 'not', 'being', 'high', 'art', 'what', 'quite', 'well.Personally', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'horror', 'movie', 'House', 'Dead', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'bottom', 'feeders', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'movie', 'far', 'fewer', 'cheats', 'explanations', 'mechanisms', 'say', 'Momento', 'Mullholland', 'Drive', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'were', 'David', 'Lynch', 'movie', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'crying', 'movie', 'sense', ""'d"", 'be', 'lauding', 'how', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'not', 'spoon-feeding', 'answers', 'digress.Soul', 'Survivors', 'college', 'girl', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'car', 'crash', 'coming', 'home', 'rave', 'friends', 'heartbroken', 'Then', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'Crazy', 'looking', 'guys', 'chase', 'then', 'vanish', 'dead', 'boyfriend', 'visit', 'eerie', 'messages', 'plot', 'there', 'course', 'not', 'what', 'seems.Personally', 'think', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'movie', 'casting', 'very', 'good', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'good', 'lead', 'character', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'great', 'sympathetic', 'priest', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'good', 'ostensibly', 'nice', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'friend', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'entire', 'career', 'wild', 'child', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'little', 'help', 'grieving', 'friend', 'involved', 'pretty', 'strange', 'situations', 'setting', 'rave', 'revisited', 'few', 'times', 'also', 'gorgeous.I', 'could', 'go', 'short', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'what', 'out', ""n't"", 'have', 'half', 'many', 'cheats', 'more', 'artistic', 'ambitious', 'movies', 'casting', 'setting', 'are', 'great', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'genre', '4', 'stars']",N/A

684822,ATXMIZXC1IHNU,B00005UQ6G,Amazon Customer,"[5, 7]","The lowdown: A girl named Cassie and her three friends are involved in a car accident in which her boyfriend dies. Two ugly ravers are out to get her. Her boyfriend, not one to be hindered by death, pops up every now and again. And, yeah...that's about it. Think Lost Highway meets Love Story, but with no point.I like a good mind-screw movie as much as the next Joe, but good grief, Jon Voight, what the h*ll happened to this flick? This had ""suck"" written all over it from the get-go. It's not often you can tell a movie will bite the big one as early as the opening credits, but Soul Survivors breaks the mold. And to think I watched the extended version, which, you'll be stunned to find out, was one whole minute longer than the theatrical release. One minute. One lousy minute. Can't wait for Soul Survivors: Director's Cut, wherein we're treated to an additional 10 seconds of aimless story.1) Acting. So-so. Melissa Sagemiller did aight as the titular, tormented lead. Wes Bentley and Casey Affleck were okay. Luke Wilson played a priest who spouted religious clich&eacute;s. No, it was not as funny as it sounds. In fact, it was painful. Eliza Dushku lets her cleavage do the acting. I would blame the actors, but the screenplay gave 'em jack-all to work with.2) Structure. Being a mind-screw movie, the scenes ricocheted everywhere. You get flashbacks, subliminal scenes that appear for a split-second, dreams, hallucinations, and a cornucopia of general weirdness. Chris likes mind-screw movies, but the structure has to be tight for the flick to work. Survivors lacked the cohesion necessary to mess with my mind and make the movie enjoyable as a whole. Too willy-nilly.3) Plot. Cassie (Sagemiller) has a hallucination, then runs away. She then talks to Matt (Bentley) or Annabel (Dushku) who comfort her. Cassie then has another hallucination and runs away. Matt and/or Annabel proceed to comfort her. Press repeat. Yeah, that's my last two hours right there.4) Repetition. Hehe, please, are you joking? I wouldn't torture a terrorist with this movie.A true stink-bomb. Watch only for its unintentionally comedic value. The scene near the end where the cops walk toward Cassie reminded me of every zombie movie I ever watched. I laughed out loud right before predicting that Cassie would be hit with a car as she started backing up. Then she gets hit by a car. It's just that bad, folks. The only survivors in this affair are the ones who can sit through this pile of celluloidal excrement and live to tell about it.Favorite line:(Cassie to ""Raven"", who--you guessed it!--is a hardcore raver)Cassie: Go back to the Addams' family!",1,"There's mind-screw, and then there's confusing rubbish",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2643,"['lowdown', 'girl', 'named', 'Cassie', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'boyfriend', 'dies', 'Two', 'ugly', 'ravers', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'hindered', 'death', 'up', 'now', 'again', 'yeah', 'Think', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'meets', 'Love', 'Story', 'point.I', 'good', 'mind-screw', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'Joe', 'good', 'grief', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'what', 'h*ll', 'happened', 'flick', 'had', 'suck', 'written', 'get-go', 'not', 'often', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'will', 'bite', 'big', 'one', 'as', 'early', 'opening', 'credits', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'mold', 'think', 'watched', 'extended', 'version', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stunned', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'whole', 'minute', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'release', 'One', 'minute', 'One', 'lousy', 'minute', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'Director', 'Cut', ""'re"", 'treated', 'additional', '10', 'seconds', 'aimless', 'story.1', 'Acting', 'So-so', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'did', 'aight', 'titular', 'tormented', 'lead', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'were', 'okay', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'played', 'priest', 'who', 'spouted', 'religious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'No', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'fact', 'was', 'painful', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'cleavage', 'do', 'acting', 'would', 'blame', 'actors', 'screenplay', 'gave', 'jack-all', 'work', 'with.2', 'Structure', 'Being', 'mind-screw', 'movie', 'scenes', 'ricocheted', 'everywhere', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'subliminal', 'scenes', 'appear', 'split-second', 'dreams', 'hallucinations', 'cornucopia', 'general', 'weirdness', 'Chris', 'mind-screw', 'movies', 'structure', 'be', 'tight', 'flick', 'work', 'Survivors', 'lacked', 'cohesion', 'necessary', 'mess', 'mind', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'whole', 'Too', 'willy-nilly.3', 'Plot', 'Cassie', 'Sagemiller', 'hallucination', 'then', 'away', 'then', 'talks', 'Matt', 'Bentley', 'Annabel', 'Dushku', 'who', 'comfort', 'Cassie', 'then', 'hallucination', 'away', 'Matt', 'and/or', 'Annabel', 'proceed', 'comfort', 'Press', 'repeat', 'Yeah', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'right', 'there.4', 'Repetition', 'Hehe', 'please', 'are', 'joking', 'would', ""n't"", 'torture', 'terrorist', 'movie.A', 'true', 'stink-bomb', 'Watch', 'only', 'unintentionally', 'comedic', 'value', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'cops', 'walk', 'Cassie', 'reminded', 'zombie', 'movie', 'ever', 'watched', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'right', 'predicting', 'Cassie', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'car', 'started', 'backing', 'up', 'Then', 'hit', 'car', 'just', 'bad', 'folks', 'only', 'survivors', 'affair', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'pile', 'celluloidal', 'excrement', 'live', 'tell', 'it.Favorite', 'line', 'Cassie', 'Raven', 'who', 'guessed', 'hardcore', 'raver', 'Cassie', 'Go', 'back', 'Addams', 'family']",N/A

Once again, I have been sodomized by low budget horror.The film stars some no-name low-rent Naomi Watts-wanna-be who, depending on the lighting, can look either fairly attractive or like she has a touch of Down's Syndrome.  Dushku turns in a very nice and slutty performance but she loses me when she makes out with some nasty hermaphrodite.  Affleck's brother is a whiney little turd and the other dude is extremely irritating and has big eyebrows.The script pretty much steals elements from other horrible movies:  'I Know What You Did Last Summer'(ugh), 'Scream'( double ugh).  There's nothing really new or original here.  And the acting, gore, or special effects aren't good enough to make you not care.

The party goes bad when first, the new boyfriend catches Cassie kissing the ex-boyfriend(how soap opera!) and then they all get into a nasty car wreck. Cut to a few months later, Cassie's in college, her boyfriend is supposedly dead, and things basically degenerate into one big incoherent mess of a movie. Let's see, there are creepy guys chasing Cassie around the college, Eliza Dushku is having sex with Angela Featherstone for no apparent reason, the dead boyfriend keeps showing up, there are flashes of an operation, and Cassie meets a young priest(Owen... no wait, Luke Wilson) who seems to know a lot more about what's happening than he's letting on.

Williams III,"[1, 2]","I'm not ashamed to admit that the reason I even looked at this movie in the first place was because of Eliza Dushku (whom, at that point, I'd only seen in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and the movie &quot;True Lies.&quot;)  I went in thinking, &quot;Ooh, Eliza's in a horror movie, my favorite genre !  How can this movie fail ?!&quot;  Not long after I started watching, I figured out exactly how it could fail, because it didn't take very long at all for me to become completely confused.  I watched it through to its conclusion, hoping to reach some semblance of an explanation for everything I'd seen and had been confused by up to that point....but I didn't.  It left me with the impression that the director's main focus was not on developement of the characters or the advancement of the story, but rather it was keeping the audience confused that seemed to be the main goal, and if that is the case, then I will say that he at least succeeds in that respect.  It most certainly worked on me.  To make it worse, most of the actors don't even seem to know what they're doing, and aren't doing a very good job of covering up that fact.  Even Eliza Dushku, my favorite actress, had no chance of saving this picture.  If you feel like wasting about two hours of your life on a bad horror movie, &quot;Soul Survivors&quot; will do the trick.  However, if you're looking for quality horror, then I suggest you look the direction of &quot;Halloween,&quot; &quot;A Nightmare On Elm Street,&quot; or &quot;Scream.&quot;",1,How many ways can I tell you &quot;Don't see this movie&quot; ?!,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,1524,"[""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'reason', 'even', 'looked', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'whom', 'point', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'True', 'Lies.', 'quot', 'went', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Ooh', 'Eliza', 'horror', 'movie', 'favorite', 'genre', 'How', 'can', 'movie', 'fail', 'quot', 'Not', 'long', 'started', 'watching', 'figured', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'could', 'fail', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'long', 'become', 'completely', 'confused', 'watched', 'conclusion', 'hoping', 'reach', 'semblance', 'explanation', 'everything', ""'d"", 'seen', 'had', 'been', 'confused', 'point', '.but', 'did', ""n't"", 'left', 'impression', 'director', 'main', 'focus', 'was', 'not', 'developement', 'characters', 'advancement', 'story', 'rather', 'was', 'keeping', 'audience', 'confused', 'seemed', 'be', 'main', 'goal', 'case', 'then', 'will', 'say', 'least', 'respect', 'most', 'certainly', 'worked', 'make', 'worse', 'most', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'up', 'fact', 'Even', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'favorite', 'actress', 'had', 'chance', 'saving', 'picture', 'feel', 'wasting', 'about', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'bad', 'horror', 'movie', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'quot', 'will', 'do', 'trick', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quality', 'horror', 'then', 'suggest', 'look', 'direction', 'quot', 'Halloween', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'quot', 'quot', 'Scream.', 'quot']",N/A

The movie tries to keep you on your toes by mixing up reality with surreal imagery.  Oooooh, what's real, what's not?  By the end of the movie, I was asking myself 'Who cares?'I think the actors in this movie did fairly good job, but the material they had to work with was really lame.  For me, there were very few likable characters in this movie, so I really didn't take much interest in what happened to them.  And the leather wearing, cigarette smoking, bad girl routine played by Eliza Dushku is getting old.  I think she's smart, attractive, and deserves better parts than this.  Maybe she needs a new agent.The movie revolves around an car accident, and the consequences of that accident.  The movie, at first glance appears to be a horror type movie, but it is not.  The movie claims to be a suspenseful thriller, but it is not.  Sometimes it seemed to try and be both, but failed miserably.  It's use of imagery, flashing between reality and the surreal, gets old fast.  Just because someone can direct a MTV music video doesn't mean they can direct a feature length movie.  The characters have little or no development and, subsequently, no depth.  They are flat and uninteresting.  The 'surprise' ending left me cold, as I saw it coming from a mile away.  Basically the main character is left to deal with events, torn between different worlds, not knowing what's real and what's not...and the viewer stumbles along with this plodding story.  I thought at some points the director was beating us over the head with his message, and at other points the message was lost in a swamp mess of surrealistic imagery.As I said, I've seen this sort of plot in better movies, and Carnival of Souls (1962) comes to mind.  That movie was much more effective and a heck of a lot cheaper to make.  Even Jacob's Ladder was better.

All I know is that this version of the film walks the line between entertaining and preposterous, more often falling off the side of the latter.To begin, the lead actress (Melissa Sagemiller) is certainly cute enough to hold one's attention, but she isn't given much to do.  She continually sees her dead boyfriend, Sean (Casey Affleck), around campus.  Yeah, okay, but isn't three times enough?  And Affleck gives a performance that is so low-key one wonders if he thought his character was dead even before the fatal car crash.Eliza Dushku (character name forgotten and unnecessary) plays Sagemiller's best friend, who just happens to be going out with Sagemiller's ex-boyfriend (Wes Bentley) who just happens to still have a thing for her.  Dushku's character is the most interesting of the bunch, but that's probably because she is the archetypal ""bad girl with some Lesbian tendencies"" and walks around in revealing tops throughout the film.Bentley is clearly the best actor here, making even his worst lines smack of sincerity.  I never once laughed at him.And speaking of sincerity, Luke Wilson plays a priest who is the most *sincere* character I have seen in a movie in years.  You keep waiting for him to come on to Sagemiller or something, but he never does anything reproachable.  I mean, why have a priest in a horror movie if he isn't going to be villainous?Some of these situations and character motivations actually make some sense once you know the ending of the film.

684833,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005UQ6G,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 11]","I have mixed feelings about Soul Survivors, especially this self-proclaimed ""The Killer Cut"" version.  This movie oversells itself, and it tries much too hard to be confusing, providing so many last-minute twists that it ruined some of my appreciation for it.  I think the moviemakers are also wrong in thinking it explains itself fully in the end; surely, one figures out the whole gist of the thing, but some of the nuances really don't resonate that well.  Having watched the movie and the limited commentary included with it, I still must question several scenes that either do not make sense in the proper context or seem to have nothing to do with the actual story.I won't dwell too much on plot here for fear of giving something away.  Basically, this is a story of four friends: Cassie (played wonderfully by newcomer Melissa Sagemiller), her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck), her best friend Annie (Eliza Dushku), and Annie's boyfriend/Cassie's former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley).  The gang goes to a rave on the eve of starting college, where a bunch of weirdoes wearing featureless masks keep popping up.  Then Cassie and Sean have a misunderstanding after Matt talks Cassie into giving him a goodbye kiss.  On the way home, a car full of masked people swings around the front of the group's vehicle and causes a hellacious accident.  Cassie survives, but she is emotionally traumatized by Sean's death.  Matt and Annie somehow come out unscathed.  Cassie goes on to college and begins to lose her grip on reality.  She keeps seeing the weirdoes from the club following her, and on several occasions they attempt to kill her.  Matt stays to take care of her, but as time goes on Cassie becomes suspicious of her friends, relying on the comfort of Sean (whose ghostly presence appears to her on a number of occasions) and a young priest at the school.  There is an element of suspense here, one which builds up as the movie progresses, but I found myself preoccupied trying to figure out just who was actually dead here and what the final twist of the movie would be.Soul Survivors is basically a psychological thriller.  The ""killer cut"" promises more blood, sex, and terror than the theatrical version; there is some blood, particularly in one scene, but there is basically no sex to be found anywhere here, nor can I say I felt a lump of anything resembling terror building up in my stomach.  Suspense-wise, the movie shoots itself in the foot; by the time you get past the surreal marathon of images, flashbacks, and dreams at the end, all you really care about is seeing the movie end.  The basic idea of the film is good, the actors are very good indeed, but there's just something missing in the whole atmosphere.It's interesting to note that Eliza Dushku is featured most prominently on the movie case, while the real star, Melissa Sagemiller, is almost lost in the background.  Dushku fans will definitely want to see this movie, but her role is basically that of a supporting actress.  I liked the commentary by Sagemiller included on the DVD.  She explains about half a dozen scenes (there is no movie-length commentary) and offers some insight on the film that I was interested in hearing.  The behind-the-scenes featurette was short and interesting but nothing special.  The featurette on Harvey Danger basically has nothing to do with the film, but it was certainly unusual and slightly comical.  The extra features on the DVD are much appreciated, but they can't make up for the flaws in the actual movie.",3,Too surreal for its own good,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,3529,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'especially', 'self-proclaimed', 'Killer', 'Cut', 'version', 'movie', 'much', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'confusing', 'providing', 'so', 'many', 'last-minute', 'twists', 'ruined', 'appreciation', 'think', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'also', 'wrong', 'thinking', 'fully', 'end', 'surely', 'one', 'whole', 'gist', 'thing', 'nuances', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'well', 'Having', 'watched', 'movie', 'limited', 'commentary', 'included', 'still', 'must', 'question', 'several', 'scenes', 'either', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'proper', 'context', 'seem', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'actual', 'story.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'here', 'fear', 'giving', 'something', 'away', 'Basically', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'Cassie', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'newcomer', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'boyfriend', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'best', 'friend', 'Annie', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Annie', 'boyfriend/Cassie', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Matt', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'gang', 'rave', 'eve', 'starting', 'college', 'where', 'bunch', 'weirdoes', 'wearing', 'featureless', 'masks', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'Then', 'Cassie', 'Sean', 'have', 'misunderstanding', 'Matt', 'talks', 'Cassie', 'giving', 'goodbye', 'kiss', 'way', 'home', 'car', 'full', 'masked', 'people', 'swings', 'front', 'group', 'vehicle', 'hellacious', 'accident', 'Cassie', 'emotionally', 'traumatized', 'Sean', 'death', 'Matt', 'Annie', 'somehow', 'out', 'unscathed', 'Cassie', 'college', 'lose', 'grip', 'reality', 'seeing', 'weirdoes', 'club', 'following', 'several', 'occasions', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Matt', 'take', 'care', 'time', 'Cassie', 'suspicious', 'friends', 'relying', 'comfort', 'Sean', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'number', 'occasions', 'young', 'priest', 'school', 'element', 'suspense', 'here', 'one', 'up', 'movie', 'found', 'preoccupied', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'dead', 'here', 'what', 'final', 'twist', 'movie', 'would', 'be.Soul', 'Survivors', 'basically', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'killer', 'cut', 'promises', 'more', 'blood', 'sex', 'terror', 'theatrical', 'version', 'blood', 'particularly', 'one', 'scene', 'basically', 'sex', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'here', 'can', 'say', 'felt', 'lump', 'anything', 'resembling', 'terror', 'building', 'up', 'stomach', 'Suspense-wise', 'movie', 'foot', 'time', 'get', 'surreal', 'marathon', 'images', 'flashbacks', 'dreams', 'end', 'really', 'care', 'seeing', 'movie', 'end', 'basic', 'idea', 'film', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'just', 'something', 'missing', 'whole', 'atmosphere.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'featured', 'most', 'prominently', 'movie', 'case', 'real', 'star', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'almost', 'lost', 'background', 'Dushku', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'role', 'basically', 'supporting', 'actress', 'liked', 'commentary', 'Sagemiller', 'included', 'DVD', 'dozen', 'scenes', 'movie-length', 'commentary', 'insight', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'hearing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'was', 'short', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'special', 'featurette', 'Harvey', 'Danger', 'basically', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'unusual', 'slightly', 'comical', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'much', 'appreciated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'actual', 'movie']",N/A
684834,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005UQ6G,D. Mok,"[9, 15]","Soul Survivors makes no sense.  The central concept was an intriguing one, but you don't get it from the movie -- you get it from hearing the actors talk about it.  The movie is just a series of unexciting stalk-and-slash hallucinatory sequences that become tiring the second time they appear...and then the movie proceeds to give you ten more.How did top-calibre actors Wes Bentley and Eliza Dushku find themselves in this mess?  It is testament to their talent that neither of them embarrasses him/herself despite the absolute mess that is the script.  Bentley (Matt) lets his repressed attractions to Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) simmer through, while Dushku dances about the screen in her relatively insignificant scenes, managing to make a cardboard-cutout bad girl interesting.Sagemiller is overshadowed by Bentley and Dushku not because she's a bad actress, but because the story doesn't let her show any complexity at all.  Cassie is a victim character through and through.  For 75% of this movie she's crying and wimpering -- perhaps writer/director Steve Carpenter finds that great acting.  But after Cassie experiences her fourth dream sequence, it's just boring as hell.  Luke Wilson is colourless and flat, the usually interesting Angela Featherstone stumbles (stuck with a botched character), but Casey Affleck (Sean) is worse than all of them.  He's laughable.  The &quot;love&quot; between Sean and Cassie is about as kitsch and shallow as they come, and the idea that the whole plot hinges on it just cracks me up.  As it was, I found myself chuckling through most of this movie when I'm supposed to feel empathy, catharsis, or horror.This movie does resemble Jacob's Ladder in certain cosmetic ways.  But if you thought Jacob's Ladder was a stretch of logic, Soul Survivors will have you seeing stars.  Plot points are raised and then abandoned (or forgotten -- the stamp at the club, the initial attack on the mystery girl, the priest, the &quot;lesbian&quot; subplot, and the &quot;death masks&quot; all seem to disappear in a wisp of plot confusions), and when at the end of the movie you don't even know who's dead or alive, you know you have a problem.

I am never going to buy another movie again unless I've seen it, or have gotten great recommendations from my friends.  I bought Soul Survivors: The Killer Cut before I even watched it mainly because it stars Eliza Dushku, who has co-starred in my all time favorite television show, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'.  I was expecting this film to be released nation wide in theaters, but for some odd reason, it never was.  Now I know why.  It's because this movie bites!!The movie actually has a nice plot, but it is tragically mishandeled.  One night when coming home from a rave, Cassie and her friends get into a brutal car accident.  Everyone but one seems to make it out alive.  Or did they?  Soul Survivors is a very twisted movie, and I had trouble keeping up with it through the course of the film.  There's nothing wrong with a movie full of surprises and twists, but this film weakly delivers them, and they confuse the viewer more than it does surprising them.This film is from the producers of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer,' and 'Urban Legend,' but it fails miserably at landing on the same level in quality.  The only highlight of this movie is the character played by Eliza Dushku.  She provides the few and far between scenes that are actually enjoyable and worthwhile.Overall, the movie could have been improved greatly.  It managed to score a pretty impressive cast, but they're shamefully misdirected.  They did the best at what they were given.  This movie is extremely forgettable, and hard to understand.  The DVD however includes some great extras.  But they're not of any use unless you actually like the film, which would be hard to believe.  If you did like it though, then you'd be very happy with the extras on this DVD.  The only good thing I got out of this purchase was a pretty art cover case!

684847,A1D1SP3AOXDP4H,B00005UQ6G,Jimmy Lin,"[1, 2]","A friend of mine spent some time in Hollywood as a movie producer.  He once described to me the pitching process; mover (actor, producer, etc.) says to other mover, ""It's like [insert movie title here], only better!""Which means that the pitch for ""Soul Survivors"" must have gone like:  ""It's like 'Jacob's Ladder', but with hot college girls, heavy metal, and a happy ending!""Here's what they left out - while ""Jacob's Ladder"" was a psycho-emotional masterpiece, ""Soul Survivors"" would be pure dreck.  Utterly and totally.  Remorseless in its awfulness.Let's begin with the script.  The plot is hackneyed and the characters completely worthless.  Who the hell cares about a bunch of suburban white kids who drink, party, and die?  There's no reason to sympathize with any of them, and the script gives us no reason to even begin thinking of them as worthwhile human beings.  There's no emotional tension, several of the scenes are entirely stolen from ""Jacob's Ladder"" (and utilized here to much less effect), and the dialogue is completely unmemorable.  This was a lazily-written script, and writer-director Steve Carpenter should be shot for having dozed through it.The direction itself is pretty awful, too.  From the stereotypical-but-unrealistic ""goth"" party (has a single Hollywood director actually been to a goth club?  You wouldn't think so from watching their movies) to the generic liberal-arts college campus (Middleton College - woo-hoo for hamfisted metaphors for Purgatory!) the pathetic attempts to shock (whoa, dead people like kinky sex!), this film feels like exactly what it is - the product of a middle-American imagination suckled with MTV and Nike commercials.The acting?  Blase'.  Not one performer did anything interesting or of note.  Wes Bently played his ""mildy creepy teenage white kid"" bit with less intensity than in ""American Beauty"".  Eliza Dushku did her ""mildly wild-and-sexy"" bit as well as always (the only reason I give this flick a single star, because Dushku is good at being a sexy party chick).  Affleck and Sagemiller were competely forgettable as actors.Possibly the most damning aspect of the movie is ""making-of"" featurette.

One of them dies in the wreck, and the girlfriend of the deceased friend is now seeing him everywhere. She's also having reoccurring dreams of him, but experiencing things in real life. There's also a trio of mysterious individuals following and threatening her, and trying to take over the remaining two friends' lives.Soul Survivors really could have been an enjoyable suspense thriller. The concept is very interesting. Even when they tried to lengthen it with a ""Dream / Nightmare / Reality"" concept, it still is interesting. This is why I bought the DVD before seeing the movie (Plus the fact that Eliza Dushku was in it). But the movie just doesn't live up to its interesting concept. There are many plot holes (What was with the opening murder scene? What exactly is the background of the 3 weird individuals?) and the ending is just one great big mind trip that has no rational explanation as it goes along. It was as if the director just filmed scenes which seemed to have tension and suspense and threw them together to see if we actually got the whole jist of it. Even in all of this, the cast was very strong and full of talented actors even if some of their characters and character development was very thin. Melissa Sagemiller, our lead, played the estranged girlfriend very well. She portrayed her character very well, with what she was given. I hope to see her in something else. Wes Bentley and Eliza Dushku's acting talents were shown here, and Casey Affleck was good.Artisan does provide us DVD buyers with a very good disc. The video and audio are good, especially during the rave scenes in the movie. The ""Killer Cut,"" which is the R-rated version of the movie, is on the disc as opposed to the theatrical PG-13 release. I never saw the PG-13 version, but I'm pretty sure I can pick out the stuff that wasn't on it. There are 3 deleted scenes. The first 2 do not really do much of anything for the movie, while the third deleted scene actually helped me understand the movie better and should have been kept in. There's also a fluffy featurette, scene-select audio commentary with Melissa Sagemiller, and theatrical trailers to Soul Survivors and 5 other Artisan titles. There's also an unneeded, not funny spoof docu on the band Harvey Danger, which contributed one song to the movie.I really do wish Soul Survivors could have been edited differently with more background on the story because it could have been really good, but I'll have to settle for a very mildly entertaining movie.",2,A Dissapointment,1015027200,"03 2, 2002",2002,2591,"['Soul', 'Survivors', 'film', 'group', 'college', 'bound', 'friends', 'who', 'get', 'wreck', 'One', 'wreck', 'girlfriend', 'deceased', 'friend', 'now', 'seeing', 'everywhere', 'also', 'having', 'reoccurring', 'dreams', 'experiencing', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'trio', 'mysterious', 'individuals', 'following', 'threatening', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'remaining', 'two', 'friends', 'lives.Soul', 'Survivors', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'concept', 'very', 'interesting', 'Even', 'when', 'tried', 'lengthen', 'Dream', '/', 'Nightmare', '/', 'Reality', 'concept', 'still', 'interesting', 'why', 'bought', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'movie', 'fact', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'was', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'interesting', 'concept', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'What', 'was', 'opening', 'murder', 'scene', 'What', 'exactly', 'background', '3', 'weird', 'individuals', 'ending', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'big', 'mind', 'trip', 'rational', 'explanation', 'along', 'was', 'director', 'just', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'have', 'tension', 'suspense', 'threw', 'together', 'see', 'actually', 'got', 'whole', 'jist', 'Even', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'full', 'talented', 'actors', 'even', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'very', 'thin', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'lead', 'played', 'estranged', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'hope', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'acting', 'talents', 'were', 'shown', 'here', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'good.Artisan', 'provide', 'DVD', 'buyers', 'very', 'good', 'disc', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'rave', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Killer', 'Cut', 'R-rated', 'version', 'movie', 'disc', 'opposed', 'theatrical', 'PG-13', 'release', 'never', 'saw', 'PG-13', 'version', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'can', 'pick', 'out', 'stuff', 'was', ""n't"", 'are', '3', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'first', '2', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'movie', 'third', 'deleted', 'scene', 'actually', 'helped', 'understand', 'movie', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'also', 'fluffy', 'featurette', 'scene-select', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'Soul', 'Survivors', '5', 'other', 'Artisan', 'titles', 'also', 'unneeded', 'not', 'funny', 'spoof', 'docu', 'band', 'Harvey', 'Danger', 'contributed', 'one', 'song', 'movie.I', 'really', 'do', 'wish', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'differently', 'more', 'background', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'very', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

Bernabo,"[4, 6]","I can see why ""Soul Survivors"" has ticked a lot of people off; actually it has gone farther than that and is current #83 on the International Movie Data Base's list of Bottom 100 films.  The problem is that writer-director Stephen Carpenter does not play fair with his audience, which is an open invitation to get people seriously, ah, ticked off.  When you take your audience on this sort of a ride when it is all over you want them to appreciate the trick you have played on them, and that is not the response people are having to this film.  Halfway through I announced that if this movie ends up like I think it is going to end up then I am going to be seriously, ah, ticked.  It did, I was, and I still am.Furthermore, if took away the first two minutes of the film or however long it runs before the title sequence, I bet everybody who has reviewed this movie would add another star.  That is how important that first scene ends up being in terms of making the wrong sort of contract with the audience.  Go ahead and experiment: find somebody who has not seen ""Soul Survivors"" (and do not even ask me what ""The Killer Cut"" means because I do not care), start the movie after the ""teaser"" (just skip to Chapter 2 for all you living in DVD land) and see if they do not like it a lot more than you did.I watched this movie because it has Eliza Dushku in it and I was in the mood to watch a bad horror movie with someone from the cast of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  The premise is that Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) goes off to college and makes a big mistake with ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley) in front of current boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck), while gal pal Annabel (Dushku) tries to understand what is going on.  Before anything gets sorted out there is a car accident that ends up.  Sean is killed and then things get very, very weird for Cassie.  Also running around are a priest named Jude (Luke Wilson), a leather clad lesbian (Angela Featherstone), and a guy in a death mask.  ""Soul Survivors"" is a film that embraces its weirdness.The final insult to injury on the DVD version of ""Soul Survivors"" is that Carpenter leaves it to actress Melissa Sagemiller to do the ""Scene select commentary"" instead of showing up to explain this disaster himself.  No guts, no glory, dude (and Sagemiller babbles about ""Catholic mythology"" when she is not talking about what she remembers about shooting these scenes).  Director Carpenter does a credible effort, with a few nice artistic touches here and there, but unfortunately writer Carpenter gets too cute for his own good.  I am sure when Carpenter (the writer or director, it really does not matter) pitched this idea that it sounded like it was a whole lot better than most slasher flicks, but all of the props Carpenter gets for his ambition gets taken away when it turns out he was not playing fair.",3,You can make this movie (almost) work.

Eliza Dushku is eye candy but the movie seem to contain way too much sexual content when the whole point of the movie is to scare the viewers, not turn them on sexually.  I find this movie completely lost regardless of the somewhat decent cinematography that is presented here. Also, what do they mean by 'killer cut'?  Maybe the director is too ashame to put director's cut since the movie is so bad that he uses this phrase to confuse us even more.Watch Nightmare on Elmstreet if you want to be entertained with fright.....because you won't find it here.",1,Too confusing to watch...... not entertaining,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,998,"['Soul', 'Survivor', 'Nightmare', 'Elmstreet', 'gone', 'bad', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'watching', 'trailer', 'away', 'plot', 'ending', 'case', '.watch', 'very', 'confusing', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'seem', 'be', 'alot', 'switching', 'living', 'dreams', 'afterlife', 'hints', 'whatsoever', 'when', 'switching', 'taken', 'place', 'audience', 'confused', 'dazed', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'seem', 'contain', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'sexual', 'content', 'when', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'scare', 'viewers', 'not', 'turn', 'sexually', 'find', 'movie', 'completely', 'lost', 'regardless', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'presented', 'here', 'Also', 'what', 'do', 'mean', 'cut', 'Maybe', 'director', 'too', 'ashame', 'put', 'director', 'cut', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'phrase', 'confuse', 'even', 'more.Watch', 'Nightmare', 'Elmstreet', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'fright', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 7]","Take Jacob's Ladder, put some hot chicks in it, some kickin' tunes, a lot of buff guys mumbling to themselves, and you have Soul Survivors. I could just leave the review at that, but for those of you who haven't seen Jacob's Ladder, I feel obligated to explain. This is Spoilerland, so run while you can...Still here? Sorry to hear that. Okay, well Jacob's Ladder was about the process the protagonist goes through as he dies. In essence, the few seconds as he struggles between life and death are his purgatory. The movie follows the main character living out his life in those split seconds, and characters become symbols of heaven and hell.Jacob's Ladder had a lot of sneaky hints, like...the guy in white is the angel. He also happens to be a chiropractor. In case you didn't figure it out in the film, the protagonist says stuff like, &quot;You're like an angel.&quot;Have you figured out yet that I wasn't too fond of Jacob's Ladder?So you can imagine how much I didn't enjoy Soul Survivors, which is a direct rip off of that film. Only there's even more ridiculous symbolism from the school of M. Night Shyamalan - red is the sign of the bad supernatural guys. And yes, white's the sign of good supernatural guys. And there's a lot of sudden cuts and weird animal noises as the film hops around trying to freak us out.Let me save you five bucks: Cassie is at a party with her other two friends Annabel (played by the I-can't-believe-anyone-hires-her-she's-that-awful actress Eliza Dushku) and Matt (her ex-boyfriend) and her boyfriend, Sean. Cassie gets caught kissing Matt, Sean gets mad, everyone piles into a car and they get into a car accident with two weird guys and a lesbian.Follow me so far? The rest of the movie is like a funkier version of The Others, only without Nicole Kidman's infernal whisper-acting. There's a lot of confusion, a lot of symbolism, a lot of non-events that are supposed to be creepy but just end up becoming frustrating. After five minutes I figured out the Big Secret.And the Big Secret is that Cassie's in the purgatory of her mind. Her boyfriend's actually alive (which is why she thinks he's dead) but the ex-boyfriend and girlfriend are dead and trying to drag her with them into hell. Fortunately, Saint Jude intervenes.That's right. You read that correctly: Saint Jude. I'm not sure why. But he wears white, so we know he's a Good Guy &trade;.This movie sucks. It's not as bad as say, Species 2, which was just in poor taste. It's just a poorly directed, poorly acted rip off of a movie that wasn't all that great to begin with.

However, there's a great deal more than meets the eye.  First of all it manages to put its audience on edge without resorting to blood and gore tactics.  Even if it never scares, it certainly creates a loaded tension.  Secondly, the various dream sequences are genuinely disturbing and really help to give an idea of the hallucinatory hell that the character goes through.  Plus there's an efficient cast, including Wes Bentley (`American Beauty') and Eliza Dushku (Faith in `Buffy The Vampire Slayer') although inexplicably these more bankable stars aren't given top billing.  Those honours go to Melissa Sagemiller and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's brother), who are certainly good enough.Although the movie does steer off course for a while with a contrived scene where the leading ladies get to shower together, it's unoriginal start punctuated with an underlying nastiness make it seem like a wink to its audience.

Did you see any T.V. commercials or any previews for &quot;Soul Survivors&quot;?  Well, if you think back a while, maybe you will remember seeing previews....like maybe a year ago.  Apparently this movie's theatrical release date was pushed back a bit (to say the least-- it was originally set to open in September of 2000!) which normally isn't a good sign...and in this case, I should have taken the hint and skipped this movie.Here's a little bit of plot:  A group of kids, Cassie, Annabel, Matt, and Sean are going away to college.  Cassie and Sean are a couple, Annabel and Matt are a couple, and Cassie and Matt used to be a couple but broke up-- and still, they are all best friends, how sweet!  Anyway, once they arrive at school they go to a frat party, Sean tells Cassie he loves her, blah, blah, and then they all regroups and go to some club (which is actually an old church) in the middle of nowhere for a good ole fashioned rave.  Anyway, there's drinking, smooching, dancing, and stalking.  The stalking is important but unexplained:  two dudes (one old guy with a scarred face and an other guy with some creepy clear mask) keep checking out Cassie and Annabel.  The girls don't like the attention and decide to leave after a little while.  BUT, before we leave the party for some reason Matt convinces Cassie to kiss him one last time (they broke up and she's dating Sean, remember?) which, of course, Sean witnesses.  So, Cassie drives them all home but keeps apologizing to Sean about the kiss and she keeps taking her eyes off the road....see where this is going?They get into a car accident with the two guys from the club that were stalking Cassie and Annabel....what a coincidence.  Anyway, Sean dies, and they all go back to school.  But Cassie keeps seeing Sean and having visions and nightmares of blood squirting out of her nose and stuff like that.  The rest of the movie (and I've only described about the first 10 minutes so far) is a mixture of Cassie freaking out about the &quot;guy from the club&quot; stalking her, flashbacks/nightmares of doctors in an OR trying to drill a hole in her head, and more visions of blood squirting from various parts of her head.The movie was very confusing and half of the time it jumped from one scene to the next without explanation.  Maybe the director/writer intended for the audience to be confused just like the main character Cassie...but it sure was annoying to watch.

(&#147;The Killer Cut: More sex! More blood! More terror!&#148;) It should probably tip you off that Carpenter&#146;s three previous directorial efforts were The Power (1980), The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1981), and Kindred (1986). You probably never saw any of them. You&#146;re a better person for that.It&#146;s hard not to like any movie in which Angela Featherstone (Cracker) gets naked, especially when being pawed by Eliza Dushku (Bring It On) at the time. But worry not, Carpenter tries his best to get you not to like it. The premise revolves around Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller, in her biggest role to date) and her three friends Annabel (Dushku), Matt (American Beauty&#146;s Wes Bentley), and Sean (Casey Affleck from Good Will Hunting, Ocean&#146;s Eleven, etc.). Sean is her current boyfriend; Matt is an ex. On the night before the four of them are to part ways for college, they go out to a mysterious rave. On the way home, Cassie, fighting with Sean, loses control of the car and crashes, killing Sean. She comes unhinged after that, having a nervous breakdown at college, and returns home, where Matt takes a semester off from Harvard to care for her. Despite this, she keeps seeing the two guys from the rave who were in the other car involved in the accident stalking her&#133;Unfortunately, to compare this to the film of which it&#146;s a painful second-rate ripoff would be to give away the ending. But those who have seen the far superior film from a decade before this will catch on not long after this turkey has begun. (Think &#147;being mugged by Santa Claus.&#148; That should give enough of a mental jog to those who saw it.) Can&#146;t find a single way to recommend this, makeout scene between Dushku and Featherstone notwithstanding.

And this film came from Artizan, the company of ""BWP.""  And the producer is the one who gave us ""I Know What You Did..."" and ""Urban Legend.""  I naturally watched it.  What a ... waste of time!  I don't usually exclaim this way, knowing the efforts they put into moviemaking, but this is an exception.The story starts promisingly, neatly introducing the entangled relations of the four high school students: Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku, and Malissa Sagemiller.  After an  uncomfortable affront and anger, they drive in the rainy midnight, to have a car accident.After that, the film follows the strange events that happen to Mellisa Sagemiller's character, who survived the crash.  As the tension goes higher, we know (and you all know soon) that nothing is as certain as she thought ... sort of.The big problem is, even within short running time, you see the ending from miles away.  I don't quote it, but you will surely remember one film that is similar to this one, or two, or three.  A film starring a talented actor Tim?  Or a certain Oscar-nominated film that was a big hit?But even if you know that ending, the film could have been better if it had showed a much more skilled hand to realize the brooding, sinister atmosphere that is essential to this kind of thriller.  However, the film is badly edited, mixing loud rock music to batter our nerves, right after very sentimental feelings, and unsteady camera doesn't even try to express anything subtle, throwing away the idea of ""suggestion"" or ""foreshadowing.""The acting is all disappointing, letting even Ms. Dushku sleepwalk.  Leading lady Melissa Sagemiller and Casey Affleck are no better, and so is Wes Bentley of ""American Beauty"" for all the best they do.

When watching, you get a little of everything a bad director brings to the table.Why I even expected Soul Survivors to be any good I don't know.  I thought since the cover put the movie in the class of ""Urban Legends"" and ""I know what you did last summer,"" that it would be a wild ride.  So wrong.One of the main problems I have with Soul Survivors is how terribly paced and edited it was.  In a span of ten seconds, the movie would jump years, with no explanation until 30 minutes later in the movie.  I'm not saying that jumping time quickly is a bad thing, but you need to know the art of doing it before you take on the task.  You can't leave the audience in the dark, which is exactly what Stephen Carpenter did.And the acting wasn't all that dandy either.  The only reason Casey Affleck was in this movie was because his brother is in the biz.  And in every scene he was in, you keep wanting him to clear his throat.  The lead actress, Melissa Sagemiller, wasn't too bad, but not that great either.The ending even dipped to a huge cliche.  It's not good to end a bad movie with an easy cop-out ending.
