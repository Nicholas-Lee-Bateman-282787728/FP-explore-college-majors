The way smoking was promoted then as a good thing to college girls.  The roles of women in school.  The less seriousness with which education was taken with women.  The decreased opportunity and the social norms of the time.  This really let me know about the time period and I saw so many things my mother had mentioned.  I disgussed it with her afterward.  She did not see it.  It helped me.  It was well acted and interesting.  Good character development.  A definate chick flick. They guys would hate this one most likely.

Robert's performance isn't so motivating especially since she's playing a college professor, her character doesn't teach the girls any valuable information, she preaches rather than giving them heartfelt advice. The supporting cast falls flat as well especially Kirsten Dunst but Gennifer Goodwin does shine in her role.

Maybe it was watching the trailers, and just hoping, that it would not be as bad as it appeared from the those.Nope, it was.  And then some.  Everyone said that this was like Dead Poet's Society, but with women, but it just wasn't.  Dead Poet's society had an engaging teacher and interesting, quirky students.  This was some kind of Hollywood consciousness raising that fails miserably.Julia Roberts playing that art teacher was really not all that convincing to begin with.  Actors have to transmit some kind of inherent intelligence to be believable as teachers.  She does not.  And, as usual in movies, the orders of the art time periods are mixed.  Its cave painting, then Pollack, then Van Gogh.  Uh, ok?As for the actresses, the only one I found somewhat palatable was Ginnifer Goodwin, who to me played someone who was not a stereotype or a caricature.  The rest of them....  Julia Stiles plays an overachiever.  Again.  Maggie Gyllenhall as the one who sleeps around and Kristen Dunst as the marrying one.  Boring.  Kristen Dunst's marriage falls apart.... What a shock.I also couldn't understand why this movie was made.  The 50's were a really divisive time in America, and set the stage for the 1960's.  So this slice of life from the privileged classes enjoying the privileges of the privileged classes is supposed to remind us of the ""good old days"" when women wore chastity belts, I mean girtles?  Women worked back then, women go to college looking for a husband now.  What message is this movie trying to transmit?  I have no idea.Now these are just the same comments everyone makes, but the movie lacked one more thing.  Flesh.  Sex.  I'm not saying they should be making porn here, and I know, PG-13, and all, but no intimate situations are ever shown.  Just one scene of one of these girls, just alone, talking to their significant other, privately, the way couples do, would have been sufficient.  Instead, its just ""oh, let's get married.  Let's get divorced,"" etc.  Like that's what the script says.  I got the feeling that maybe there were some scenes like that, but that committee that makes the movies in Hollywood, so that they are as bland as possible and reach as wide an audience as possible said ""cut the sex.  Don't want America's children to know anything about life.""If you must see a Julia Roberts movie, rent My Best Friend's Wedding.

797499,AC3064RV9PV62,B0001ADAVK,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[3, 6]","The theme revisited throughout this film is that conventional male-female relationships are somehow ""wrong"" or leave females ""taken advantage of.""  Joan throws away the possibility of Yale for marriage and family with a guy who seems nice but more than a little clueless about his wife who does his homework for him.Betty and Gisele argue early in the film about Gisele's promiscuity.  Gisele promptly disses Betty about her fiance's lack of ardor for her.  Betty's cold response ""Spencer is a gentleman"" is countered by Gisele's witty ""And even gentlemen have (slang term for genitalia).""  Later, Gisele's take on the subject is proved true as Spencer neglects his young wife for an adulterous relationship.  What an underlying message for a PG-13 chick flick!  If you're a nice girl and don't engage in sex with your fiance, then your fiance must not really want you and is probably cheating on you.Gisele herself is no better off as the good-time-girl, setting her sights upon flings with married older men, including a school instructor.  When she is not doing this she is cozying up in over the top touchie-feelie sessions with her college buddies that might pass for innocent childish exuberance were she not portrayed as such a worldly woman.Three different women in the film are either abbandoned by boyfriends or divorced by their husbands during separations induced by World War II.  Honestly!  Did no woman ever divorce a husband or move on to a new boyfriend when her old steady shipped out for a tour of duty?The one relationship that seems to have possibilities is Connie's blossoming romance with a loveable nerdy type and even that relationship is affected by Connie's insecurity and doubts of his sincere interest in her.  It seems every female in the film is either involved is a dysfunctional relationship, humoring a mediocre relationship, or sabotaging a positive relationship.Is this what Hollywood has been reduced to writing and producing for entertainment purposes?  While I don't expect to see four young women and their instructor find true love and marry right out of college it would have been nice to see SOME positive notes towards the growth and development of the various characters.",2,Was there a point?,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,2216,"['theme', 'revisited', 'film', 'conventional', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'are', 'somehow', 'wrong', 'leave', 'females', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Joan', 'away', 'possibility', 'Yale', 'marriage', 'family', 'guy', 'who', 'nice', 'more', 'little', 'clueless', 'wife', 'who', 'homework', 'him.Betty', 'Gisele', 'argue', 'early', 'film', 'Gisele', 'promiscuity', 'Gisele', 'promptly', 'Betty', 'fiance', 'lack', 'ardor', 'Betty', 'cold', 'response', 'Spencer', 'gentleman', 'countered', 'Gisele', 'witty', 'even', 'gentlemen', 'have', 'slang', 'term', 'genitalia', 'Later', 'Gisele', 'take', 'subject', 'proved', 'true', 'Spencer', 'young', 'wife', 'adulterous', 'relationship', 'What', 'underlying', 'message', 'PG-13', 'chick', 'flick', ""'re"", 'nice', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'engage', 'sex', 'fiance', 'then', 'fiance', 'must', 'not', 'really', 'want', 'probably', 'cheating', 'you.Gisele', 'better', 'off', 'good-time-girl', 'setting', 'sights', 'flings', 'married', 'older', 'men', 'including', 'school', 'instructor', 'When', 'not', 'doing', 'cozying', 'up', 'top', 'touchie-feelie', 'sessions', 'college', 'buddies', 'might', 'pass', 'innocent', 'childish', 'exuberance', 'were', 'not', 'portrayed', 'such', 'worldly', 'woman.Three', 'different', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'abbandoned', 'boyfriends', 'divorced', 'husbands', 'separations', 'induced', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Honestly', 'Did', 'woman', 'ever', 'husband', 'move', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'old', 'steady', 'shipped', 'out', 'tour', 'duty', 'one', 'relationship', 'have', 'possibilities', 'Connie', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'loveable', 'nerdy', 'type', 'even', 'relationship', 'affected', 'Connie', 'insecurity', 'doubts', 'sincere', 'interest', 'female', 'film', 'involved', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'humoring', 'mediocre', 'relationship', 'sabotaging', 'positive', 'relationship.Is', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'reduced', 'writing', 'producing', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'four', 'young', 'women', 'instructor', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'marry', 'right', 'college', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'SOME', 'positive', 'notes', 'growth', 'development', 'various', 'characters']",Mona Lisa Smile
797500,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001ADAVK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I may be one of the few people who found `Dead Poets Society' ridiculously clich&eacute;d and ultimately unfulfilling.  Yes I understand that just about everyone and their mother loves that movie but I just couldn't see where the draw was.  `Mona Lisa Smile' is pretty much the all girl affiliate to `Dead Poets Society'.  You have a liberal teacher who is nothing like the tightwads that walk the school.  This time around the subject is art as apposed to poetry which is a form of art in itself.  In fact it's pretty much the same recycled experience except for one strange development.  This time it seems to work.  Not brilliantly, but `Mona Lisa Smile' is by all means a `good' film but far from a `great' one.  It captures the attention of the audience and handles some heavy matters with care and diligence, but it fails to elevate itself to perfection.A big reason why this film works is the fact that its star, Julia Roberts, can make just about anything palatable.  Her performance is just what this film needed to make it entertaining and relevant.  Sure, this is far from her best start turn, but it is classic Roberts and it delivers on all fronts.  She's smart, commanding, witty and charming.Roberts plays Katherine Watson, the newest addition to an all girl's college.  She immediately realizes that she is outnumbered in thought and tradition and is forced to face the fact that her presence is not truly appreciated by the staff and most of the students.  Taking place in 1953 the idea of college graduate is merely for title, not for application.  The idea that a woman would excel to be something more than a common housewife is ludicrous to these women and far from encouraged, it is shamefully discouraged.  Katherine Watson is a different bird altogether though.  She ruffles feathers as she pushes forward in encouraging her students to break away from the domineering brainwashing of society and think for themselves, think about what would make them happiest.Her students range from the sweet natured overachiever to the shy and reserved `fat girl' to the misunderstood `loose girl' to the even more misunderstood aggressively heartless brat.  By the end of the film revelations have taken place for all of these girls and their lives are forever changed.  Julia Stiles plays Joan, the overachiever who dreams of being a lawyer yet is soon to be married.  In all due respects Julia is supposed to be our star next to the `other' Julia, but Stiles manages to get pushed to the background by her co-stars.  While her performance is decent the other three girls steel all of her thunder.  Kirsten Dunst is the epitome of evil as Betty Warren, and while this is far from her finest performance she is definitely effective.  The two standouts though are none other than Ginnifer Goodwin and Maggie Gyllenhall.  Their performances are layered and emotional and moving, and delivered with such perfection it's no wonder their careers are taking off.The supporting performances by the likes of Marcia Gay Harden and Dominic West are effective in their own rights and take nothing away from the film, albeit not really adding anything either.In the end `Mona Lisa Smile' is a sweet film that will touch the heart and satisfy the viewer.  It's not the type of film that moves mountains or changes lives and it's not a film that will stick with you forever but it will not leave you cold or distant.  It's good entertainment, but just don't expect it to be a masterpiece.  It is a bit clich&eacute;d and it is a bit generic.  We can all guess the ending before it comes and the revelations that face each girl are the furthest thing from original.  Like I said, this is recycling at it's best for it takes the same old thing and regurgitates it with different actors and a slightly altered setting yet it works slightly better than the original so bravo in that regard.",3,Another `teacher changes lives' film that leaves us entertained but not in awe...,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,3884,"['may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'ultimately', 'unfulfilling', 'Yes', 'understand', 'just', 'everyone', 'mother', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'draw', 'was', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'pretty', 'much', 'girl', 'affiliate', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'have', 'liberal', 'teacher', 'who', 'nothing', 'tightwads', 'walk', 'school', 'time', 'subject', 'art', 'apposed', 'poetry', 'form', 'art', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'recycled', 'experience', 'one', 'strange', 'development', 'time', 'work', 'Not', 'brilliantly', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'good', 'film', 'far', 'great', 'one', 'attention', 'audience', 'heavy', 'matters', 'care', 'diligence', 'elevate', 'perfection.A', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'fact', 'star', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'can', 'make', 'just', 'anything', 'palatable', 'performance', 'just', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'make', 'entertaining', 'relevant', 'Sure', 'far', 'best', 'start', 'turn', 'classic', 'Roberts', 'fronts', 'smart', 'commanding', 'witty', 'charming.Roberts', 'plays', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'newest', 'addition', 'girl', 'college', 'immediately', 'outnumbered', 'thought', 'tradition', 'forced', 'face', 'fact', 'presence', 'not', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'staff', 'most', 'students', 'Taking', 'place', '1953', 'idea', 'college', 'graduate', 'merely', 'title', 'not', 'application', 'idea', 'woman', 'would', 'excel', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'common', 'housewife', 'ludicrous', 'women', 'far', 'encouraged', 'shamefully', 'discouraged', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'different', 'bird', 'altogether', 'feathers', 'forward', 'encouraging', 'students', 'break', 'away', 'domineering', 'brainwashing', 'society', 'think', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'happiest.Her', 'students', 'range', 'sweet', 'natured', 'overachiever', 'shy', 'reserved', 'fat', 'girl', 'misunderstood', 'loose', 'girl', 'even', 'more', 'misunderstood', 'aggressively', 'heartless', 'brat', 'end', 'film', 'revelations', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'girls', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Joan', 'overachiever', 'who', 'being', 'lawyer', 'yet', 'soon', 'be', 'married', 'due', 'respects', 'Julia', 'supposed', 'be', 'star', 'other', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'get', 'pushed', 'background', 'co-stars', 'performance', 'decent', 'other', 'three', 'girls', 'steel', 'thunder', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'epitome', 'evil', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'far', 'finest', 'performance', 'definitely', 'effective', 'two', 'standouts', 'are', 'none', 'other', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'performances', 'are', 'layered', 'emotional', 'moving', 'delivered', 'such', 'perfection', 'wonder', 'careers', 'are', 'taking', 'off.The', 'supporting', 'performances', 'likes', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Dominic', 'West', 'are', 'effective', 'own', 'rights', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'adding', 'anything', 'end', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'sweet', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'satisfy', 'viewer', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'changes', 'lives', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'forever', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'cold', 'distant', 'good', 'entertainment', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'bit', 'generic', 'can', 'guess', 'ending', 'revelations', 'face', 'girl', 'are', 'furthest', 'thing', 'original', 'said', 'recycling', 'best', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'different', 'actors', 'slightly', 'altered', 'setting', 'yet', 'slightly', 'better', 'original', 'so', 'bravo', 'regard']",Mona Lisa Smile

797502,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0001ADAVK,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[1, 1]","Mona Lisa Smile is a movie with some heart. I say *some*, in the sense that it won't get your pulse racing with either joy or outrage, but it does have a steady pace. It is a thoughtful story about young women finding themselves and developing true friendships in an era when they were not valued beyond their marriages by the rest of society.Julia Roberts plays a fledgling Art History instructor in her first year at Wellesley College.  This is the 1950s, so her somewhat ""Bohemian"" politics become a source of controversy to the staff of that conservative school as well as the elitist parents of the all-female student body (personally, I didn't quite buy that angle to Julia's character; she's just too warm and sweet to pull it off).But the girls love her, as she cares about their lives and takes the time to counsel them as individuals. Meanwhile, she has romantic entanglements of her own to sort out and is finding her own way in life even as she helps her students to find theirs.Ironically, although Julia Roberts is the lead, there are some much more outstanding performances by Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst.  I enjoyed the somewhat nostalgic look back at the `50s styles and the feeling of innocence in those times.  The students and their instructors face realistic life challenges in this story - what will I do with my life, who am I, what is true love, and when am I really a grownup? - that we can all relate to.  These are the best reasons to see this movie from my point of view.The paranoia of communism and the general oppression of that decade are also explored, perhaps a bit much in my opinion. Marriage is presented as detrimental to the freedom and individualism of the women who get &quot;trapped&quot; into it.  There is a statement being made by this story, which practically shouts itself at the audience ""Isn't it great that women's rights have come so far since then?!?""  Yes, indeed it is great that we have so many more choices now.  I just wish the feminist agenda wasn't so heavyhanded, so obvious here.So, go see this movie for the warm look back at America's last days of innocence and politically correct conservativism.

Too bad the director pandered more to sentimentality and notions of ""sisterhood"" than sticking to the foundation of the story's core roots, i.e. conformism, traditionalism, consumerism, and how they shaped the modern American woman.I thought Mona Lisa Smile could've been a lot more than what it was. Julia Roberts plays an idealistic art professor who goes to the most prestigious woman's university in America to ""reform"" the university's way of teaching and in turn the way of the students' thinking. Roberts is a cardboard character. The audience is meant to identify with her forward thinking character in the backwards 1950s. She is an independent, rebellious woman, too busy fighting for women's independence to see what she really wants.Unfortunately all the other ""girls"" in the film aren't much more original. Each one of the four student ""girlfriends"" we follow represents in almost cookie cutter form the key roles middle and upper class women were allowed to play in the 1950s: free thinking, sexually promiscuous bohemian, rigid house wife who stands by her man, career driven yet unable to balance career with family, and the ugly duckling who finds self esteem and thus a man. The scenes with the college students played like a bad Lifetime movie. However, the classroom scenes had a bit of a twist on the usual Hollywood standard of ""smart teacher reforms troubled kids"" where Roberts was instead a ""free thinking teacher that counsels conformist kids.""  The best scene of the film is where Robert's turns the class around from a bunch of book-memorizing snobs into women who really examine who they are and how they are perceived.The DVD has very few special features. The standard interviews where the actors talk about the movie is spent mainly discussing the role women played in the 1950s and how society and a consumer culture dictated a lot of those roles. No one really talked about their characters. Probably because the characters weren't that interesting. All-in-all Mona Lisa Smile interesting as a look at mid-20th century middle to upper-class women, but as a movie with engrossing characters and a powerful plot it fails miserably.",2,Could've been more than just another chick flick . . .,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2251,"['man', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'get', 'way', 'yes', 'chick', 'flick', 'Too', 'bad', 'director', 'pandered', 'more', 'sentimentality', 'notions', 'sisterhood', 'sticking', 'foundation', 'story', 'core', 'roots', 'i.e', 'conformism', 'traditionalism', 'consumerism', 'how', 'shaped', 'modern', 'American', 'woman.I', 'thought', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'idealistic', 'art', 'professor', 'who', 'most', 'prestigious', 'woman', 'university', 'America', 'reform', 'university', 'way', 'teaching', 'turn', 'way', 'students', 'thinking', 'Roberts', 'cardboard', 'character', 'audience', 'meant', 'identify', 'forward', 'thinking', 'character', 'backwards', '1950s', 'independent', 'rebellious', 'woman', 'too', 'busy', 'fighting', 'women', 'independence', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'wants.Unfortunately', 'other', 'girls', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'original', 'one', 'four', 'student', 'girlfriends', 'follow', 'almost', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'form', 'key', 'roles', 'middle', 'upper', 'class', 'women', 'were', 'allowed', 'play', '1950s', 'free', 'thinking', 'sexually', 'promiscuous', 'bohemian', 'rigid', 'house', 'wife', 'who', 'man', 'career', 'driven', 'yet', 'unable', 'balance', 'career', 'family', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'who', 'self', 'esteem', 'thus', 'man', 'scenes', 'college', 'students', 'played', 'bad', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'However', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'had', 'bit', 'twist', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'smart', 'teacher', 'reforms', 'troubled', 'kids', 'where', 'Roberts', 'was', 'instead', 'free', 'thinking', 'teacher', 'conformist', 'kids', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Robert', 'class', 'bunch', 'book-memorizing', 'snobs', 'women', 'who', 'really', 'examine', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'are', 'perceived.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'standard', 'interviews', 'where', 'actors', 'talk', 'movie', 'spent', 'mainly', 'discussing', 'role', 'women', 'played', '1950s', 'how', 'society', 'consumer', 'culture', 'dictated', 'lot', 'roles', 'one', 'really', 'talked', 'characters', 'Probably', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'All-in-all', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'interesting', 'look', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'middle', 'upper-class', 'women', 'movie', 'engrossing', 'characters', 'powerful', 'plot', 'miserably']",Mona Lisa Smile

You see a lot of movies about dedicated, eccentric teachers, but hardly ever about horrid teachers.  Well, here you go.Here are the specifics:The protagonist is invited to lecture in art history at an exclusive college, but instead of doing the job that the college, the students, the faculty, and the parents want, expect, and are paying her for, she instead cleverly uses her position as a front for her real interest:  denigrating the values of her students and colleagues and implying their lives are not complete or authentic unless they conform to her intellectual and social agenda.Essentially, it's a film about indoctrination and subversion, an investigation into the phenomenon of the seemingly wholesome and enthusiastic teacher who is in reality doing everything possible to corrode the values of the community into which she has been welcomed, even though said community makes it clear that it neither requested nor desires this.The director is a genius, though.  Rather than laying bare this vile usurper as the invidious influence she really is, he instead portrays the lead in a flattering light, using soft lenses, swelling violin music, etc., to make the hilariously ironic suggestion that our villain is really a self-sacrificing heroine, thus violently upending the expectations of the complacent audience.Brilliant.",1,genius!,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,1405,"['kind', 'movie', 'rarely', 'see', 'horrible', 'teacher', 'see', 'lot', 'movies', 'dedicated', 'eccentric', 'teachers', 'hardly', 'ever', 'horrid', 'teachers', 'Well', 'here', 'go.Here', 'are', 'specifics', 'protagonist', 'invited', 'lecture', 'art', 'history', 'exclusive', 'college', 'instead', 'doing', 'job', 'college', 'students', 'faculty', 'parents', 'want', 'expect', 'are', 'paying', 'instead', 'cleverly', 'position', 'front', 'real', 'interest', 'denigrating', 'values', 'students', 'colleagues', 'implying', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'authentic', 'conform', 'intellectual', 'social', 'agenda.Essentially', 'film', 'indoctrination', 'subversion', 'investigation', 'phenomenon', 'seemingly', 'wholesome', 'enthusiastic', 'teacher', 'who', 'reality', 'doing', 'everything', 'possible', 'corrode', 'values', 'community', 'been', 'welcomed', 'even', 'said', 'community', 'clear', 'requested', 'this.The', 'director', 'genius', 'though', 'Rather', 'laying', 'bare', 'vile', 'usurper', 'invidious', 'influence', 'really', 'instead', 'lead', 'flattering', 'light', 'using', 'soft', 'lenses', 'swelling', 'violin', 'music', 'etc.', 'make', 'hilariously', 'ironic', 'suggestion', 'villain', 'really', 'self-sacrificing', 'heroine', 'thus', 'violently', 'upending', 'expectations', 'complacent', 'audience.Brilliant']",Mona Lisa Smile

Katherine is shocked when she learns her students have already fulfilled the requirements in their syllabuses by the very first class, and decides to stray against the rules by showing the girls modern art and teaching them that they have a choice in life besides becoming a housewife and mother. Katherine shares a special bond with her students, though a few students really stand out. Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is a ""proper young lady"" who quickly gets married because her family wants her to and soon learns about marriage the hard way--she becomes rebellious towards Katherine's teachings in the meantime; Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) is a bright and intelligent girl who gets into Yale Law School but must make a choice when she falls in love with a man; and then there's Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is kind of like Katherine herself, except Giselle is a ""player"" and likes to fool around with guys...especially men who are a lot older than her. Through these students, Katherine learns about herself and life as she goes against school board rules.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: The film was a bit feminist in my opinion, but since I'm a bit of a feminist myself, this only made me enjoy the ""Mona Lisa Smile"" even more. The acting, of course, was spectacular. I was quite surprised by the acting of the younger cast, though I always knew how talented these young women were and expected nothing less from them. Julia Roberts is as good as ever...she never fails to impress me. The storyline was wonderful and so was the dialogue and overall message of the story. The directing, costumes, settings, etc. were all brilliant.

797515,A1T13S3JPJQ99M,B0001ADAVK,"Christopher Crossley ""The Man from Hubei""","[4, 5]","The social phenomenon known as ""Women's Lib"" was years away, yet Miss Katherine Watson, an art history teacher at an exclusive New England all-women's college in the fall of 1953, seemed about to bring its ideas into terra incognita and thus come into conflict with just about everybody.Julia Roberts plays a character actively challenging the stereotypical thinking behind the motives of the young - and spoilt - twenty-somethings, who have already been more than happy to remain indoctrinated by both men and women into believing that they could achieve all the happiness in the world simply by being in the home at the beck and call of their hard-working husbands.For them, domesticity seems to be a calling, something which rankles with Watson, who has come all the way from sunny California in the belief that she is preparing tomorrow's leaders at a college, yet, as she says in a moment of emotion to the ""philandering Italian professor"", Bill Dunbar (Dominic West), it appears that she is simply grooming tomorrow's leaders' wives at ""a finishing school disguised as a college"" instead.Challenging the status quo via ""subversive"" activities is not tolerated at this college by the president, Jocelyn Carr (Marian Seldes), who summarily fires the school nurse, Amanda Armstrong (Juliet Stevenson), for ""being seen to promote promiscuity"" by distributing contraceptive devices in spite of having been associated with the college for nearly a quarter-century.Practically everyone's nemesis appears to be the insufferably overzealous Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), whose mother (Donna Mitchell) just happens to be the president of the college alumnae association. Watson will not tolerate any challenge to her own authority from this student, who appears to be just as ready to be as subversive as her, yet at the same time is receptive to questioning her expected role as devoted wife, domestic, and future mother in the light of her mother's insistence that she stay with a husband who thinks more of his job than he does of her.In the meantime, Watson is exasperated by everyone else's blind acceptance of this kind of role for ""educated"" women and openly asks Carr if she is proud of her students. The president's response serves only to drive Watson almost to the point of telling everyone exactly what she thinks of the whole situation.Through not teaching what is on the art history syllabus, Watson encourages those who wear rose-tinted spectacles to think outside the box. She expects them to challenge accepted norms about what is supposed to be acceptable, who is supposed to think so and, above all, why it is supposed to be so. She uses modern, not classical, art as her medium for getting the young women to become forward thinkers, much to the consternation of Carr, who urges Watson to remember that ""we are traditionalists"", to which remark Watson says dryly, ""Yes, I've noticed.""This is mainly Roberts' movie, as she maintains her screen presence by never exaggerating the emotions of the main character, being as abrasive and blunt when she needs to be (""'A girdle will set you free'? What does that mean?!"") and as compassionate about her work and her students when she needs to be. The main cast of female supporting actors, Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Ginnifer Goodwin, give sterling performances as the young women who seem ready to embrace the lifestyle of middle-class wives pushing vacuum cleaners and using washing machines, but gradually become accustomed to thinking that there just might be a way to balance both being wives and being career women.This is despite the fact that, for one, Joan Brandwyn (Stiles) is totally prepared to throw away the chance to go to Yale law school by telling Watson that ""this is all I've always wanted - a home and a family"". Watson's face shows her predictable reaction yet congratulates her on her sudden marriage in the hope that she might just think about her actions. Certainly, Watson believed that she was definitely not ready to marry herself, and the scene in the common room where she publicly scotched the rumors of an impending marriage was memorable, since it challenged the young women's perception of her as ""anti-marriage"" and ""anti"" anything else she was thought not to like.Overall, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal have written, while Mike Newell has directed, a very enjoyable movie about the pros and cons of embracing a particular piece of (now largely outdated) ideology, even if it was never meant to be a social history polemic. However, the characters, including those who may be perceived as being utterly shallow and narrow-minded, are made quite believable by the actors. The contrast between the initial naivety of Watson and her disillusionment with the mindset of the staff and students is quite stark, and Roberts does a good job from start to finish in portraying the one ""caught in the middle"" between traditionalism and feminism. Watson is uncompromising in her views, yet proves to be dedicated to her job - even if she is basically a misfit in the college - and compassionate to those around her.",4,"Uncompromising misfit, yet

Save for one brilliant (if somewhat awkwardly-placed) scene involving Julia Roberts' passionate admonishment of the internalized sexism of popular advertising, this movie is rife with cliches and over-trodden ground. There are times when you feel as if the film is trying to say something more about sex roles, feminism, and the advent of what would later be coined as ""the feminine mystique,"" but they appear so infrequently, so awkwardly, and so unsatisfying as to barely merit a mention.In terms of acting, Julia Roberts' and Maggie Gyllenhaal's roles are the most successfully portrayed. Kirsten Dunst succeeds at being annoying (for once her intent matches her performance) and Julia Stiles' role was just awfully acted altogether, no two ways about it. I've never heard a more unconvincing and ""I'm happy!"" in my life. Her heart-to-heart with Roberts, regardless of how important the message, almost brought tears to my eyes -- not out of any strong feeling, but because it was so painfully artificial.If taken at little more than face value, the movie warrants a viewing, if only for the beautiful cinematography and snapshot of female collegiate life post-World War 2.

If not...well there are a few things that might make the movie worth its price.""Mona Lisa Smile"" takes place at Wellesley College (all women) in the academic year 1953-1954. At the start, Julia Roberts is seen on a train-she plays Katherine Watson, an idealistic young ARt History professor, traveling from California to teach at the school of her dreams.The movie portrays the students of Wellesley at that time as brilliant, beautifully dressed at all times (if you like cashmere and pearls, you'll love this movie), snobby and hell bent on getting married. Roberts' character is shocked (shocked!) that her students do not use their brilliant minds to think on their own and to apply to law school etc. And she sets about to change them.She spends most of her time with four students-brilliant Joan (Julia Stiles) whom she encourages to ditch her fiancee for Yale Law School, snobby Betty (Kirsten Dunst) who marries early in the first semester, slutty Gisele (Maggie Gylenhall) who has slept with a male professor and Julia's love interest, and wallflower Connie (Ginnifer Goodwin). All of the students (with the exception of a wooden Julia Stiles) are excellent and actually try to act (something Julia really doesn't). They have tough jobs as their characters are all one-note.However, Marcia Gay Harden steals the movie as Julia's roommate, a lonely middle-aged professor who teaches speech and elocution, and is a homemaker without a home. It would have been a far better movie if she had been in the lead role.Several things in the movie do work well. The sets and costumes are outstanding (much of the film was shot at Wellesely, which is beautiful). The soundtrack is AMAZING-with covers of 50's songs from a diverse group of 00's artists (e.g., Seal, Chris Isaak, Macy Gray).I would recommend this movie to Julia Roberts' fans and to those individuals who enjoy ""woman-themed"" (e.g., chick flick) movies.

797523,A1FF6KD07OHRFM,B0001ADAVK,"C. S. Stockwell ""math person""","[1, 2]","I'm just watched the DVD of this movie.  Unless if the theater version was different, did critics and I even watch the same movie?Don't watch this expecting this to be like Dead Poet's Society.  Yes, one of the messages in the movie is about thinking for yourself, but the issues that college women had to deal with during that time are quite different from prep school boys.  Yes, this is somewhat of a chick flick, but at least it's not overly sappy chick flick.  I don't usually have much tolerance for sap.I admit that I was not particularly happy with its portrayal of the school, as I am an alumna.  But from what i have been hearing about the time period, the issues the women faced in the movie were those that they had to face then.  I read somewhere that one of the reasons the story was set in Wellesley is that it's such an icon of the all women's college.  (Remember Working Girl with Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith?)  As such, then, I'll let the exaggerations slide a little for artistic licence.  Same with the different girls being somewhat exaggerated characters.It would have been nice if Joan had gone on to law school, but the fact that she at least made the application shows some progress.  Sometimes change happens slowly.  Maybe her daughter will go.  Or maybe she went on later.  We can hope.I have mixed feelings about Katherine leaving.  I guess she left because under the conditions that she had to abide by, she couldn't be true to her beliefs.  I don't know whether I should interpret that as the administration having won, or she's standing her ground.That is not to say she didn't make a difference, however.  Yes, the change in Betty happens rather fast, but then again, given her previous beliefs, what she went through was rather traumatic.  The send off the girls gave to her, with the flowers and the bike scene, shows that she did make an impression, and that they are beginning to learn what she had to say.  But, as I said before, some changes happen slowly.  The girls will get there eventually.  I confess.  I cried at the very end.But, what exactly was the purpose of the Italian professor?  I think it would have been a better movie if he'd been more supportive of Katherine.  Then his presence in the movie would have served a better purpose.  Or, here's a thought.  Wouldn't Katherine have served as a better example if she had actually married her Californian boyfriend, and showed the girls how to balance work and family?  I didn't think she had all that great a reason for rejecting him.  So what was his purpose in the movie?I'm thinking, though, the fact that people have talked about and written about this movie, good or bad, would suggest it struck a nerve.  A movie that'll get people to think about issues isn't all bad.  Based on the movie itself, with the weaknesses I pointed out, I think I'd actually give this a three and half.

At least that's what the cobbled-together Mona Lisa Smile felt like to me. In its pre-release publicity for this film, the studio, as it struggled to define what this virtually plotless movie was about, latched comparisons onto superior productions from the past like Dead Poet's Society, and even Mr. Holland's Opus, all in an effort to bolster this turkey via association. I wonder if anyone was fooled?

797527,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0001ADAVK,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[9, 9]","The 1950's--a time of growth and prosperity in the US, but the Cold War had jump-started immediately after World War II.  Mona Lisa Smile is set in 1953, the time of the McCarthy hearings, I Love Lucy, and though not mentioned, the execution of the Rosenbergs.  Keeping up with the Joneses thus meant a time to conform to the conservative ideology of economic prosperity, where Victorian values regarding women had made something of a comeback.Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts is a bastion of conservatism, and into this, from California, enters a new art history instructor, Katherine Watson.  She is a progressive person, and isn't too keen on the rigid curriculum, but she better watch out, lest she be cut down in one of the school editorials written by Betty Warren. A warning shot comes to her when Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and boarding house mate, a lesbian, is dismissed for the harmless and progressive act of distributing contraceptives.After a disastrous first day (imagine a class where everybody's Hermione Granger), Watson decides to shift the emphasis of her class to modern art, such as abstracts, culminating in an outing where she shows them a Jackson Pollock.  She tries to tell the students that conforming to the roles defined for them by Cold War culture is a dull, unfulfilling future of servitude.  The point of college is to enrich oneself, not a waiting room where one waits to find a husband and thus become entrapped.  Thus modern art represents the new era, a new way of defining art, such as &quot;is it art?&quot; or &quot;who determines what is art?&quot; which translates to &quot;is this fulfillment&quot; or &quot;who determines what is expected of women?&quot;However, her progressive views aren't taken too well by the head of the college and she is told to tone down her liberal teaching methods.  And this also hits in the classroom in her conflicts with Betty, someone all too eager to conform to the woman's life of getting married as the good housewife and bearer of children.It's the students as well as Watson who play a central role in the film.  Giselle is the most interesting and most liberated of all the students.  She has affairs with many men, including an instructor and even her analyst.  At one point, during the marital etiquette class, she makes a wisecrack that makes it clear she doesn't take conventional life seriously.  Another who has promise is Joan, an A student who protests getting a C by Watson.  Jo wants to go to Yale and study law, hoping she can squeeze in the one slot available to women every year.The banality of conformism comes through in the Paint By Numbers sets, where one fills in the colours and can draw their own Van Gogh, ironic as Van Gogh's art defied convention.  Another subtle hint of the old school being dragged kicking in screaming into the postmodern age is the &quot;Istanbul&quot; number, where the lyrics state how the good old days are missed when Istanbul used to be Constantinople.  The way the old fogies are portrayed here, I was surprised they didn't long for the days when it was Byzantium!I rolled my eyes at the roles Julia Roberts was in following her Oscar win in Erin Brockovich, but Mona Lisa Smile proves she's back on again.  Chalk this up with her better vehicles such as Pretty Woman and Notting Hill.Of the students, Maggie Gyllenhall shines out as Giselle, followed closely by Julia Stiles as Joan.What comes out here is a movie showing women who are brave enough to defy convention despite fears of ostracization and do something else in a frightening Cold War America.",4,Another Julia picture that's more on the smile side,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,3610,"['1950', 'time', 'growth', 'prosperity', 'US', 'Cold', 'War', 'had', 'jump-started', 'immediately', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'set', '1953', 'time', 'McCarthy', 'hearings', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'not', 'mentioned', 'execution', 'Rosenbergs', 'Keeping', 'up', 'Joneses', 'thus', 'meant', 'time', 'conform', 'conservative', 'ideology', 'economic', 'prosperity', 'where', 'Victorian', 'values', 'regarding', 'women', 'had', 'made', 'something', 'comeback.Wellesley', 'College', 'Wellesley', 'Massachusetts', 'bastion', 'conservatism', 'California', 'new', 'art', 'history', 'instructor', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'progressive', 'person', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'rigid', 'curriculum', 'better', 'watch', 'lest', 'be', 'cut', 'down', 'one', 'school', 'editorials', 'written', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'A', 'warning', 'shot', 'when', 'Amanda', 'Armstrong', 'college', 'nurse', 'boarding', 'house', 'mate', 'lesbian', 'dismissed', 'harmless', 'progressive', 'act', 'distributing', 'contraceptives.After', 'disastrous', 'first', 'day', 'imagine', 'class', 'where', 'everybody', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Watson', 'shift', 'emphasis', 'class', 'modern', 'art', 'such', 'abstracts', 'culminating', 'outing', 'where', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'tell', 'students', 'conforming', 'roles', 'defined', 'Cold', 'War', 'culture', 'dull', 'unfulfilling', 'future', 'servitude', 'point', 'college', 'enrich', 'not', 'waiting', 'room', 'where', 'one', 'find', 'husband', 'thus', 'become', 'entrapped', 'Thus', 'modern', 'art', 'new', 'era', 'new', 'way', 'defining', 'art', 'such', 'quot', 'art', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'what', 'art', 'quot', 'quot', 'fulfillment', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'what', 'expected', 'women', 'quot', 'However', 'progressive', 'views', 'are', ""n't"", 'taken', 'too', 'well', 'head', 'college', 'told', 'tone', 'down', 'liberal', 'teaching', 'methods', 'also', 'classroom', 'conflicts', 'Betty', 'someone', 'too', 'eager', 'conform', 'woman', 'life', 'getting', 'married', 'good', 'housewife', 'bearer', 'children.It', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'Watson', 'who', 'play', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'Giselle', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'liberated', 'students', 'affairs', 'many', 'men', 'including', 'instructor', 'even', 'analyst', 'one', 'point', 'marital', 'etiquette', 'class', 'wisecrack', 'clear', ""n't"", 'take', 'conventional', 'life', 'seriously', 'who', 'promise', 'Joan', 'A', 'student', 'who', 'getting', 'C', 'Watson', 'Jo', 'go', 'Yale', 'study', 'law', 'hoping', 'can', 'squeeze', 'one', 'slot', 'available', 'women', 'year.The', 'banality', 'conformism', 'Paint', 'Numbers', 'sets', 'where', 'one', 'colours', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'ironic', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'art', 'defied', 'convention', 'subtle', 'hint', 'old', 'school', 'being', 'dragged', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'postmodern', 'age', 'quot', 'Istanbul', 'quot', 'number', 'where', 'lyrics', 'state', 'how', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'are', 'missed', 'when', 'Istanbul', 'used', 'be', 'Constantinople', 'way', 'old', 'fogies', 'are', 'portrayed', 'here', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'long', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'Byzantium', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'roles', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'was', 'following', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'back', 'again', 'Chalk', 'up', 'better', 'vehicles', 'such', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Notting', 'Hill.Of', 'students', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'out', 'Giselle', 'followed', 'closely', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Joan.What', 'out', 'here', 'movie', 'showing', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'defy', 'convention', 'fears', 'ostracization', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'frightening', 'Cold', 'War', 'America']",Mona Lisa Smile

During these moments, we feel as if we are glimpsing something real, a teacher who is not invincible, who does not know everything, etc.  Like many films about teaching these days, the plot suffers from a dual burden: how do we both explore the life of the teacher AND the lives of her students.  In the end, it is a losing battle, and very few films manage to pull it off.  The ones that do succeed (for example, DEAD POETS SOCIETY), do so because they ultimately choose one over the other.I brought up the movie, so I might as well complete the comment that has been made over and over again: MONA LISA SMILE feels very much like a female-version of DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  The difference here is that the ""tradition"" that threatens to break the wills of the students is not merely a New England prep-school mentality--it is the bonds of patriarchy.  This lends extra ""bite"" to the themes in the film and provide for a compelling storyline.Overall, Roberts does a fantastic job owning the screen and we root for her all the way.

797532,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,B0001ADAVK,David A. Bede,"[0, 0]","If nothing else, ""Mona Lisa Smile"" has made me want to learn more about what Wellesley and other colleges like it were really like half a century ago.  It's hard to believe an institution founded on the then-radical idea that women should have a right to an education could ever have been that repressed and conservative; but then, in 1953 those two characteristics could be found in a lot of places you wouldn't expect today.So, is it really ""Dead Poets' Society"" with girls?  Only in the most superficial sense.  Yes, they're both about teachers who brought radical ideas to schools that weren't quite ready for them, but that and the decade they're set in are about the only two similarities I could see.  The presentation of that decade is a bit sanitized, as some other reviewers have pointed out, with most of the common intolerances of the time being only hinted at or receiving token mention.  Likewise, Julia Roberts' character usually seems unrealistically oblivious to the limits facing most women in 1953 as she encourages her students to reach beyond the finishing-school life they have all been conditioned to pursue.It's sad but true that the resistance she meets in that quest is one of the more convincing points of the story, but there are also plenty of delightfully raw looks at what life was like just beneath the surface of the perfect upper-class existence of the era.  The students are also somewhat by the numbers - the free spirit, the conflicted one, the nasty one, the ugly duckling who isn't really ugly - but the talented cast does a lot with the familiar formula all the same.  Likewise, some cliches turn up in the plot, but the story and its characters are original enough that they don't seem too stale.  For example, perhaps you've already seen the student-trespassing-in-an-opposite-sex-dorm scene in every other '50s college movie ever made, but this one at least features the character you'd least expect to find there and you care enough about the preceding events to be glad it happens.The one real problem with the movie is that most of the characters and the tension in the storyline (to the extent that there is any) are somewhat fuzzily portrayed, with the result that the various resolutions seem either unconvincing or too perfect.  It's almost as if the writers assumed that the audience would be able to fill in the blanks on our own thanks to years of exposure to Hollywood formulas - probably correct, but I was still left thinking much more could have been accomplished with such a great cast, setting and story.Still, what they do give us is delightful for what it is.

797533,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0001ADAVK,David Hugaert,"[7, 12]","It is the year 1953: The aftermath of the Korean War meant that a newfound idealism of communism was reigning supreme on the northern part of the Korean peninsula, cigarette advertisements were being aired on television [can you believe that?], and thousands of women across this great country were tied down to a life of drudgerous housework, having to do menial chores for their husbands, who brought home the bacon (in the form of a paycheck), leaving these wives no choice but to cook it. These same women could only fantasize about life as career women and provide substantial earnings of their own. That would bring about much needed changes, in the form of one Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who would arrive at one of the nation's premiere institutions of higher learning for women: Wellesley College. Ms. Watson would make the long, arduous journey from sunny California to icy Massachusetts, only to find that she has a tough task ahead of her, having to face a tough crowd of young, free-spirited female college students, who test our Professor of Art History upon arrival, fresh off the train from the West Coast. Ms. Watson's attempt at instilling ideals of reforming the girls' vision of the modern-day role of women in 1950s society falls on deaf ears, and, therefore thinking that women are continued to be destined to live a glorious life as domestic engineers, wallowing in the aromatic stench of Bon Ami and Brillo pads, Ms. Watson's students go about their lives on campus, concentrating on gossip concerning the girls' love life and their future husbands. Using various forms of art history through different types of paintings and ancient sculptures, including other forms of television and magazine advertisements, Ms. Watson challenges her students through means of theoretical concepts, to examine both the past and future roles of women in society, both as housewives and as potential career  women. When the girls use their minds to examine such possibilities (and probabilities), surprising results are bound to occur (which makes Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" seem like only a novel model of feminist pride by comparison). Leaving her exceptionally bright and independent class to handle this concept on their own, as well as under Ms. Watson's terms, Watson's in-depth curiosity and skin-deep beauty catches the eye of a Professor of Foreign Languages, who has a lot more on his mind than Italian cuisine and the canals of Venice. Also, Ms. Watson's love life isn't exactly peaches and cream back home, as her fiancee pays a surprise visit to New England (Gee, heads are about to REALLY roll now!). In ""Mona Lisa Smile"", it is with these types of dramatic roles where Ms. Roberts is most adept and at home, adding her own unique brand of thespian wit and charm to the role of Katherine Watson, everybody's favorite instructor of art history (OK, maybe not!). Could another Oscar for Best Actress be in the offing for Julia? To further her quest in this beneficial and glorious cause, it would be most wise to journey to your local theater, and take in a viewing of ""Mona Lisa Smile""; when, upon seeing it, will make the upward corners of your mouth do an unbelievable double-take, making the lips of Da Vinci's female subject seem like an act of (pent-up) rage and hostility by comparison (to which I state in great, good-natured humor of course!)!",4,Another Best Actress Oscar For Julia Roberts?,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,3378,"['year', '1953', 'aftermath', 'Korean', 'War', 'meant', 'newfound', 'idealism', 'communism', 'was', 'reigning', 'supreme', 'northern', 'part', 'Korean', 'peninsula', 'cigarette', 'advertisements', 'were', 'being', 'aired', 'television', '[', 'can', 'believe', ']', 'thousands', 'women', 'great', 'country', 'were', 'tied', 'down', 'life', 'drudgerous', 'housework', 'having', 'do', 'menial', 'chores', 'husbands', 'who', 'brought', 'home', 'bacon', 'form', 'paycheck', 'leaving', 'wives', 'choice', 'cook', 'same', 'women', 'could', 'only', 'fantasize', 'about', 'life', 'career', 'women', 'provide', 'substantial', 'earnings', 'own', 'would', 'bring', 'about', 'much', 'needed', 'changes', 'form', 'one', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'would', 'arrive', 'one', 'nation', 'premiere', 'institutions', 'higher', 'learning', 'women', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'would', 'make', 'long', 'arduous', 'journey', 'sunny', 'California', 'icy', 'Massachusetts', 'only', 'find', 'tough', 'task', 'ahead', 'having', 'face', 'tough', 'crowd', 'young', 'free-spirited', 'female', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'test', 'Professor', 'Art', 'History', 'arrival', 'fresh', 'train', 'West', 'Coast', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'attempt', 'instilling', 'ideals', 'reforming', 'girls', 'vision', 'modern-day', 'role', 'women', '1950s', 'society', 'falls', 'deaf', 'ears', 'therefore', 'thinking', 'women', 'are', 'continued', 'be', 'destined', 'live', 'glorious', 'life', 'domestic', 'engineers', 'wallowing', 'aromatic', 'stench', 'Bon', 'Ami', 'Brillo', 'pads', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'students', 'go', 'lives', 'campus', 'concentrating', 'gossip', 'concerning', 'girls', 'love', 'life', 'future', 'husbands', 'Using', 'various', 'forms', 'art', 'history', 'different', 'types', 'paintings', 'ancient', 'sculptures', 'including', 'other', 'forms', 'television', 'magazine', 'advertisements', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'students', 'means', 'theoretical', 'concepts', 'examine', 'past', 'future', 'roles', 'women', 'society', 'housewives', 'potential', 'career', 'women', 'When', 'girls', 'use', 'minds', 'examine', 'such', 'possibilities', 'probabilities', 'surprising', 'results', 'are', 'bound', 'occur', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'Am', 'Woman', 'seem', 'only', 'novel', 'model', 'feminist', 'pride', 'comparison', 'Leaving', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'independent', 'class', 'handle', 'concept', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'terms', 'Watson', 'in-depth', 'curiosity', 'skin-deep', 'beauty', 'eye', 'Professor', 'Foreign', 'Languages', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'mind', 'Italian', 'cuisine', 'canals', 'Venice', 'Also', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'love', 'life', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'peaches', 'cream', 'back', 'home', 'fiancee', 'surprise', 'visit', 'New', 'England', 'Gee', 'heads', 'are', 'REALLY', 'roll', 'now', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'types', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Roberts', 'most', 'adept', 'home', 'adding', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'thespian', 'wit', 'charm', 'role', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'instructor', 'art', 'history', 'OK', 'maybe', 'not', 'Could', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'be', 'offing', 'Julia', 'further', 'quest', 'beneficial', 'glorious', 'cause', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'wise', 'journey', 'local', 'theater', 'take', 'viewing', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'when', 'seeing', 'will', 'make', 'upward', 'corners', 'mouth', 'do', 'unbelievable', 'double-take', 'making', 'lips', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'female', 'subject', 'seem', 'act', 'pent-up', 'rage', 'hostility', 'comparison', 'state', 'great', 'good-natured', 'humor', 'course']",Mona Lisa Smile
797534,A3K7WDRNIMB49W,B0001ADAVK,"D. Bell ""Imzadi""","[0, 0]","As the mother of three daughters, I was eager to see Mona Lisa Smile.  I expected a movie in which females were exposed to life beyond what they had been taught to expect, and I was not disappointed.  It was rather bizarre seeing young women attending college classes in nylon stockings and pearls, their hair in pin curls when going to bed.  Yet that was their world in those days, the world of the rich and privileged, the brightest and the best.  There were of course the misfits, like Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the only Jew, beautiful, charismatic, and brilliant, who masked her loneliness with promiscuity, and Connie Weaver, not as pretty or personable as the others, who sought comfort in the cello.  But the leaders, embodied by Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) and Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) knew where their futures lay.  Betty married early into her senior year, an extravaganza orchestrated by the mother from hell (a truly hateful Donna Mitchell) while Joan looked for an engagement ring.  Then Catherine Watson (Julia Roberts) came into their lives to show them that they could be more, contrary to the wishes of the Dean (Marion Seldes) and the alumni president, Mrs. Warren.  She succeeded in raising their awareness of art, and to an extent in raising their awareness of their options in life.One truly poignant scene will remain with me for a long time.  Betty, who has begun to realize that her ""perfect"" marriage to young lawyer Spencer has serious problems, returns home for comfort.  Her mother scornfully sends her back to her home without as much as a kiss or a caress.  I realized then that she had only had Betty so she could produce a society wedding one day.  Had Betty been mine, I'd have comforted her and listened to her.  Perhaps I would have sent her home, but only after making sure it was the right decision.  Thus Betty's becoming a supporter of Catherine's, after undermining her throughout the year with her editorials in the school newspaper, rings true.I left the theater feeling glad that that had not been my world and that my daughters had a wide world of opportunities open to them.  It made me feel good, and it made me think.

797536,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0001ADAVK,Deborah Earle,"[5, 6]","The initial scene of this exquisite 2003 charmer is narrated by Kirsten Dunst's auburn-haired Wellesley newspaper columnist, Betty Warren, who is as pretty as a rose, and just as thorny, especially in her criticism of those around her.This is particularly true when a new and unconventional art professor from California named Katherine Watson, played by Julia Roberts, arrives at Wellesley College in the autumn of 1953.Betty, whose tyrannical mother(Donna Mitchell)is the President of Wellesley's Alumni Association, initially resents the arrival of this ""subversive"" young teacher with radical ideas.Directed by Mike Newell, the film's cinematography is periodically bathed in the golden light of nostalgia, and studded with an array of fine performances not only by Roberts and Dunst, but also by a charismatic Julia Stiles as the throaty-voiced, New England-accented Joan Brandwyn, the class leader, and Betty's best friend, Ginnifer Goodwyn, as the plump, friendly, accomplished cellist, Connie, real-life Wellesley alumni Laura Allen as the breathy-voiced, refined-sounding Susan Delacorte, and the willowy and unconventionally beautiful Maggie Gyllenhall as the stereotypically promiscuous daughter of divorced parents, Giselle Levy, who, like Professor Watson, is probably one of the most realistic characters in the film, perhaps more fully aware of certain truths about life and relationships that the strait-laced and conservative Betty will simply have to learn the hard way.Marcia Gay Harden, who won an Oscar for playing Jackson Pollock's wife, is also featured in this film in which a Pollock painting receives attention. She plays the ettiquette Professor, Nancy Abbey, who like many women of her time has to present a facade of respectabilty in order to cover up the unpleasant truthabout her own status as a single woman. Interestingly we learn about her past in an in vino veritas moment during Betty's wedding reception. We also learn why Betty's wedding day is more her mother's day than her own.The male counterparts in the film are led by Dominic West, who reprises the role he had as a lying womanizer in ""Chicago"",  only this time as an Italian Professor. Beau Bridges' son, Jordan reveals that the acting genes haven't gone thin as Betty's uncaring husband, Spencer. One feels that Topher Grace as Tommy Donnegal,  and Ebon-Moss Bacharach as Betty's sweet cousin, Charlie Stewart,  the love interests of Joan and Connie, are destined for happy marriages. Their perfomances lend a certain winsomeness to the story.The reality of Betty's marriage is initially summed up by the single longing glance Betty gives a kissing Joan and Tommy as they visit her at her home.Juliet Stevenson, a prominent figure in feminist theatre, has an interesting role as the closet case school nurse who is fired after one of Betty's editorials reveals her distribution of conraceptives, which at that time, were illegal.Viewers observe the routines and rituals of a conservative women's college, as well as the chilly reception Miss Watson receives during her first class,and her challenging of her students'conventional views of art, especially when the fresh, rosy-faced young women respond to the sight of the Jackson Pollack painting.We observe the growing number of clashes between Professor Watson and the faculty (led by Marian Seldes as a staid and icy President Carr) as well as Betty Warren, who will come to realize how silly she looks in the editorial photos in which she tries to capture the essence of a married Wellesley girl soon enough.Miss Watson's daring sexual behavior would have raised more eyebrows in its time than it does 50 years later.The costumes of the women are another point of interest in the representation of their characters. Giselle is often clad in rich, vibrant, if not jewel-toned colors and flesh-revealing  clothes, complimented by a necklace with a sensuous heart-shaped pendant, whereas the more conservative Joan and Betty wear conservatively colored, preppier and more modest styles complete with the inevitably prissy set of pearls.The story itself has a lolling gentility that sharply contrasts with the theme of radicalism that it promotes. Ultimately the conventionally trained members of Wellesley's graduating class of 1954 will be inspired by their art teacher to shape their own destinies, wheather they choose careers of their own or conventional family lives, and while I would agree that this film is the obligatory girls version of ""Dead Poets'Society"",  its touch is delightfully feminine, and the graduating class' tributes to Miss Watson, both in their final class assignment and graduation-day salute, give the film a sunnier and more hopeful ending.",5,Petty Betty Gets a Reality Check,1107993600,"02 10,

To not conform to the female stereotype.But in 1953, Wellesley College supported the notion that women married and not follow any career goals despite the students doing exceptionally well in school.

There is a fine layer of grain but the film looks like it has been washed out.  The detail that I was hoping to see in the Blu-ray release may be better than the original DVD release but it wasn't as brilliant, sharp or clear as I was hoping.  The film has strong production quality and some scenes manage to capture the feel and look of the early '50s but the details and colors were average, not amazing on HD.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:For audio, ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is featured in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and also Thai and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film.  The lossless soundtrack is satisfactory for this type of film.  During times where there is music, that is when you feel the soundtrack does come alive but for the most part, the film is front and center channel driven.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Indonesian, Arabic and Dutch.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Mona Lisa Smile"" comes with the following special features in standard definition, English stereo and subtitles in Spanish, French, Dutch, Chinese (Traditional), Korean, Portuguese and Thai.* Art Forum - (6:40) The talent of ""Mona Lisa Smile"" discuss the art featured in the film and their thoughts on art.* College Then and Now - (14:39) Featuring footage from the film and interviews with the cast about how things have changed then and now in college for women.* What Women Wanted 1953 - (10:42) A making of ""Mona Lisa Smile"" and how things were back in 1953.* Music Video - Elton John ""The Heart of Every Girl"" - For those who love ""The Heart of Every Girl"", a music video by Elton John.* BD-Live EnabledJUDGMENT CALL:""Mona Lisa Smile"" was for the most part an average film that was nothing spectacular but did take the early '50s and show how there were women who tried to give their students choices and showing that they didn't have a choice to follow the stereotype of women during that time.  But somehow, when men write the screenplay about the women's movement, it just doesn't feel right.If anything, its success in the box office was due to Julia Roberts and the number of talents featured in the film, but its important to note that ""Mona Lisa Smile"" was helped with the controversy that surrounded it.It's important to note that this is a fictional story based adapted from a novel and the screenwriters are using Wellesley College as the setting.  There is no historical accuracy and with that being said, sometimes its best to not use a real name of a college when these events simply didn't happen at the college.  If anything, all the college did was give the filmmakers the opportunity to shoot at the school because they were going to use the name of the college no matter what.For one, the film being shot at Wellesley College and students upset that they were being disrupted from attending school and for the most part, the lack of minority students featured in the film (the filmmakers said they wanted to make it authentic to how things were in 1953) and of course, even the current and past alumni who were upset with the ""distorted and demeaning portrayal"" of their alma mater, prompting the President of Wellesley College to write a letter to the alumnae in regards to the film.As mentioned, the Blu-ray PQ is marginally better than the DVD release and as for special features, there is nothing new introduced into this release aside from being BD-Live Enabled.Overall, if you enjoyed the film, the upgrade in HD and lossless audio may be good if you don't own the previous DVD release but overall, ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is an average film and an average Blu-ray release.",3,Blu-ray: A solid performance by Julia Roberts but an average film and Blu-ray release at best.,1267488000,"03 2,

Watson challenged every idea that these women were brought up with: the ideas that a woman's role was to serve her husband and keep house and home.

797543,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B0001ADAVK,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[5, 8]","As a former college professor, Seven Sisters graduate, and fan of indie films, I must admit I was not optimistic about this movie.  I was right.Watching the movie, I was constantly reminded of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, a brilliant movie about turn-of-the-century Scottish schoolgirls based on Muriel Spark's novel. Some scenes were eerily similar, such as the ""girls"" standing around an art studio, wearing little schoolgirl hats, giggling at a painting. Brodie girls giggled over sex; these women giggled over unfamiliar modernism.Mona Lisa's theme seems familiar: progressive teacher influences students, questions traditional values, develops romantic interests, and fights insensitive administrators  The theme works in secondary school settings, like Brodie and Dead Poets Society,  because teachers can influence children of that age, especially in private schools.In college, especially by senior year, faculty members play a lesser role among students, who learn more from peers.  A movie about college women entering a new age would be better focused on the students themselves.Mona Lisa Smile includes some minor but annoying inconsistencies.  Art 100 would be a freshman course -- but most of the women seem to be seniors.  It's hard to imagine these women would be turned off by (let alone giggle at) contemporary art. Seven Sisters colleges have always been intellectually demanding, yet we never see these students studying or even speaking eloquently.  These girls resemble sorority sisters of Legally Blonde more than students at an elite college.The scene where a married woman returns to campus after a two-week honeymoon seems especially silly. Wellesley students would expect consequences from failing to turn in a paper on time. Professors at top schools rarely count attendance toward a grade and publicly reprimanding a student -- especially in this mean-spirited, almost catty style -- would be inappropriate anywhere.Watson wouldn't teach just one class -- she would have two or three more, each semester.  As an inexperienced teacher out of her element, she'd be overwhelmed.  And after a day of teaching, many professors eagerly seek companionship from other faculty so they can commiserate about their frustrations!Even today, professors still must follow the departmental descriptions of their courses. When a class gets listed as ""History of art from ancient times to the Impressionists,"" that's what you teach. You might bring in contemporary works to make comparisons but you can't go off on a tangent of your own.  It's unprofessional and possibly unethical.Watson violates boundaries when she encourages a student to attend law school. Giving her an application -- even helping her complete the application -- seems legitimate. But, like many mentors, Watson became overly invested in her mentee's decisions.  Coming to the student's house with a handful of law school folders - that's way out of line.  So is touching students to make a point.  And I've never heard of a college that gives student files to professors.  Apart from logistics of paperwork in the pre-photocopy era, only advisors and administrators would be likely to have access.The ""old college days"" theme would have worked well if a student had been the main character. Mary McCarthy's The Group, though dated, does give us a glimpse into college life in the era when women were free enough to experience some of the world, but not protected by birth control and social approval.  Wendy Wasserstein's Uncommon Women and Others shows student life at a women's college much later and with considerably more realism, humor and style.Alternatively, we could get a realistic movie focused on a female college professor. She'd surely be scared about her own prospects in an alien world.  Gail Godwin's novel The Odd Woman captures some of that feeling -- but it's neither glamorous nor especially fun to watch.In any case,  stories about ""the way we were"" rarely seem fresh anymore.  I recommend viewing the real thing.

Roberts has the kind of fired-up passion to inspire her students. More important though were the supporting cast of characters, her students, who fall into some stereotypical roles but who do so believably within the framework of the era (1950s); though being educated, they were being groomed for marriage and family life.

Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal were particularly believable; Kirsten Dunst is particularly good as an insecure, spoiled witch debutante who revels in schadenfreude. I can buy that.

She is not the school's first choice, but the person that was available and walks into a room full of snobbish students, who are out to get her... because they ""smell the fear"" of the prey.At this private school, she begins to plant the seeds necessary for these young women to see themselves for more than just future wives, and to seek deep inside themselves to release the potential... lawyer... doctor... mother and wife... all combined in a package that is doable and possible.The students, played by the likes of Marcia Gay Harden, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Juliet Stevenson... are superb in their roles.

Well, the last phrase is true: Roberts does have a magnificently beautiful setting (Wellesley College and its environs) but she does more than 'perform'. This is one of her more understated, underplayed, and sensitive pieces of work to date. Playing a wide-eyed California feminist teacher of Art History, she moves into the Wellesley faculty and 'Stepford Wives Preps' student body where marriage and service to the Ultimate Goal Husband overrides all other aspects of 'higher education', and slowly and painfully makes her vision seep into the minds of these very non-liberated women of tomorrow. Her pupils are well acted by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst, Gennifer Goodwin (a stunning newcomer to this reviewer), and Julia Stiles. She observes the effects of the old Wellesley attitude in the various reactions by Marcia Gay Harden (in another jewel of a portrayal), Juliet Stevenson, Marian Seldis and Donna Mitchell. The only prominent male in this cast is Dominic West who holds his own and creates a powerful chemistry with Roberts (et al...). Mike Newell knows this 1950s state of brainwashed girls who buy into the formidable philosophy that a woman's place is in the home by the iron, dishes, stove, ad infinitum. This is a terrifying reminder of how many women fostered their own degradation in the march toward future Women's Rights. To Newell's credit he does not opt for a Hollywood happy-wappy ending, but instead elects to just allow the influence of Roberts' character be felt in the fadeout.

797557,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0001ADAVK,Hikari,"[2, 2]","Hollywood hates to let a hackneyed concept go to waste and will milk one success in the genre for all it's worth.  No attempt has really been made to obscure that this Julia Roberts vehicle is an all-female remake of ""Dead Poets Society"" with Roberts in the Robin Williams role (unless switching the discipline of the teacher from English to art history could be called obscure.)  And, as is the case with the previous film, the young actors playing the students are far more convincing as inhabitants of an earlier period (the 1950s in both cases) than the adult leads.In 1953, young first-year instructor Katherine Watson comes all the way from the 'progressive' Left Coast to the 'repressive' East Coast to teach art history at Wellesley College.  She lacks previous teaching experience or a doctorate and is a product of a state school, but we know from her gumption and her dazzling smile that she is eminently well-qualified for the post.  Once installed in Wellesley, she encounters the requisite stock characters:  the timid and proper colleague who teaches deportment and lives in a chitz-covered universe; the authoritarian college president; the closet lesbian (c'mon, a movie set at a girls' school needed at least one);  the dashing professor of romance languages, soon-to-be-love interest; and etc.  Ms. Watson (though several decades ahead of women's liberation, no one as spunkily single as she would deign to answer to  `Miss') gets a rude awakening during her introductory lecture when the well-bred young ladies in her course display their mastery of the text and her  rather condescending slide presentation.  The  class has lots of bodies in it, but only four that will be of concern to us:  uber-Mean Girl and debutante bride Betty (Kirsten Dunst); steady Joan (Julia Stiles, channelling an ingenue Jane Fonda); New York sophisticate (read: campus slut) Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhall) and sweet-natured, perky cellist Connie (the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin), who inexplicably can't find a boyfriend.  These four girls are roommates; when not sniping at Ms. Watson in class, they snipe at each other in the dorm.  A lot of sniping goes on, but it's always the well-modulated, grammatically correct kind.The plot requires the free-thinking Ms. Watson to be a fish out of water whose `unorthodox' methods promptly  have her at odds with the college administration and her students, too, who have reason to be distrustful of this Callifornia bohemian out to sabotage their dreams of matrimonial utopia.  We know that Ms. Watson is a bohemian because she wears palazzo pants, embroidered peasant blouses and a beret.  Roberts looks great in whatever she wears, but her wardrobe looks much more 1980s than 1950s, even for a bohemian.  With her flowing red mane and toothy smile, she suggests (and maybe is meant to) Katherine Hepburn, who played sassy career women years before the period the movie is set in. (and also favored roomy trousers.)  Alas, Julia Roberts might have the look, but does not have the chops to channel Hepburn; her inspirational lectures sound most often like preachy harangues.  Ms. Watson is a fraud, but a well-connected one: in one scene she gets her class on the scene at the precise moment the newest Jackson Pollack is being uncrated.  Those California bohemians evidently know people.The action covers an entire academic year at Wellesley; a lot of stuff happens, all of it designed to hammer home the theme that Conformity is Bad and Individualism is good.  Individualism in this case means eschewing  marriage and family in order to attend graduate school and presumably stride around in palazzo pants.  By transposing 21st century mores onto Roberts' character, she is rendered a complete anachronism.  Ms. Watson might as well be an attractive alien visiting from 50 years in the future, ie. 2003--that's how authentic she feels as an inhabitant of the Eisenhower era.  The young actresses, by contrast, disappear  into the costumes and manners of 1950s undergraduates hot in pursuit of an M.R.S. degree with more ease.  They are the reason to watch this movie, along with some beautiful cinematography (much of it was shot on the Wellesley campus) and meticulous attention to period detail.  The soundtrack has some great numbers, but underscoring each new scene with a different 1950s pop hit begins to feel transparent very shortly.  This film is lovely to look at, but ultimately superficial.  A 1950s-era drama that manages to be respectful of its period while at the same time underscoring its limitations with more resonance is ""Far From Heaven"" starring Julianne Moore.",3,Dead Debutantes Society,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,4625,"['Hollywood', 'hates', 'let', 'hackneyed', 'concept', 'go', 'waste', 'will', 'milk', 'one', 'success', 'genre', 'worth', 'attempt', 'really', 'been', 'made', 'obscure', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'vehicle', 'all-female', 'remake', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Roberts', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'switching', 'discipline', 'teacher', 'English', 'art', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'obscure', 'case', 'previous', 'film', 'young', 'actors', 'playing', 'students', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'inhabitants', 'earlier', 'period', '1950s', 'cases', 'adult', 'leads.In', '1953', 'young', 'first-year', 'instructor', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'way', ""'progressive"", 'Left', 'Coast', ""'repressive"", 'East', 'Coast', 'teach', 'art', 'history', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'previous', 'teaching', 'experience', 'doctorate', 'product', 'state', 'school', 'know', 'gumption', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'eminently', 'well-qualified', 'post', 'Once', 'installed', 'Wellesley', 'requisite', 'stock', 'characters', 'timid', 'proper', 'colleague', 'who', 'deportment', 'chitz-covered', 'universe', 'authoritarian', 'college', 'president', 'closet', 'lesbian', ""c'mon"", 'movie', 'set', 'girls', 'school', 'needed', 'least', 'one', 'dashing', 'professor', 'romance', 'languages', 'soon-to-be-love', 'interest', 'etc', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'several', 'decades', 'ahead', 'women', 'liberation', 'one', 'spunkily', 'single', 'would', 'deign', 'answer', 'Miss', 'rude', 'awakening', 'introductory', 'lecture', 'when', 'well-bred', 'young', 'ladies', 'course', 'display', 'mastery', 'text', 'rather', 'condescending', 'slide', 'presentation', 'class', 'lots', 'bodies', 'only', 'four', 'will', 'be', 'concern', 'uber-Mean', 'Girl', 'debutante', 'bride', 'Betty', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'steady', 'Joan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'channelling', 'ingenue', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'New', 'York', 'sophisticate', 'read', 'campus', 'slut', 'Giselle', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'sweet-natured', 'perky', 'cellist', 'Connie', 'adorable', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'boyfriend', 'four', 'girls', 'are', 'roommates', 'when', 'not', 'sniping', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'class', 'snipe', 'other', 'dorm', 'lot', 'sniping', 'always', 'well-modulated', 'grammatically', 'correct', 'kind.The', 'plot', 'free-thinking', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'be', 'fish', 'water', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'promptly', 'have', 'odds', 'college', 'administration', 'students', 'too', 'who', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'distrustful', 'Callifornia', 'out', 'sabotage', 'dreams', 'matrimonial', 'utopia', 'know', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'bohemian', 'palazzo', 'pants', 'embroidered', 'peasant', 'blouses', 'beret', 'Roberts', 'great', 'wardrobe', 'much', 'more', '1980s', '1950s', 'even', 'bohemian', 'flowing', 'red', 'mane', 'toothy', 'smile', 'maybe', 'meant', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'played', 'sassy', 'career', 'women', 'years', 'period', 'movie', 'set', 'also', 'favored', 'roomy', 'trousers', 'Alas', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'might', 'have', 'look', 'not', 'have', 'chops', 'channel', 'Hepburn', 'inspirational', 'lectures', 'sound', 'most', 'often', 'preachy', 'harangues', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'fraud', 'well-connected', 'one', 'one', 'scene', 'class', 'scene', 'precise', 'moment', 'newest', 'Jackson', 'Pollack', 'being', 'uncrated', 'California', 'bohemians', 'evidently', 'know', 'people.The', 'action', 'entire', 'academic', 'year', 'Wellesley', 'lot', 'stuff', 'happens', 'designed', 'hammer', 'home', 'theme', 'Conformity', 'Bad', 'Individualism', 'good', 'Individualism', 'case', 'eschewing', 'marriage', 'family', 'order', 'attend', 'graduate', 'school', 'presumably', 'stride', 'palazzo', 'pants', 'transposing', '21st', 'century', 'mores', 'Roberts', 'character', 'rendered', 'complete', 'anachronism', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'attractive', 'alien', 'visiting', '50', 'years', 'future', 'ie', '2003', 'how', 'authentic', 'inhabitant', 'Eisenhower', 'era', 'young', 'actresses', 'contrast', 'disappear', 'costumes', 'manners', '1950s', 'undergraduates', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'M.R.S', 'degree', 'more', 'ease', 'are', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'much', 'was', 'shot', 'Wellesley', 'campus', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'numbers', 'underscoring', 'new', 'scene', 'different', '1950s', 'pop', 'hit', 'feel', 'transparent', 'very', 'shortly', 'film', 'lovely', 'look', 'ultimately', 'superficial', '1950s-era', 'drama', 'be', 'respectful', 'period', 'same', 'time', 'underscoring', 'limitations', 'more', 'resonance', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'starring', 'Julianne', 'Moore']",Mona Lisa Smile

797566,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0001ADAVK,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","Here is the setting: An idealistic young teacher arrives at a well respected private school with the intention of making a difference in the lives and education of the students.  This teacher soon runs up against a tradition bound administration as well as some tradition bound students.  Soon enough the teacher begins to win over the students who are inspired by the teacher, but the administration is not so pleased by the radical new ideas and teaching methods used by this idealistic young teacher.  What movie is this?While I was talking about ""Dead Poets Society"", the above description can be used without any changes about 2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"".  Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) is a young art history teacher from California newly arrived at the prestigious Wellesley College.  She has definite ideas about the role of women in the 1950's, but Wellesley seems to be nothing more than an excellent school to prepare the young women to be a good wife and mother.  While the academic standards are rigorous, the goal isn't for the woman to aspire to be somebody herself, but to help her husband be somebody.  Watson is appalled by this and by the resistance she meets from the administration and even by some of the brightest students.We are also introduced to some of the students, though we never get too much into their minds or lives.  There is Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst).  Betty is something of a snitch and seems to consider herself the purity police and is too full of herself.  Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) is the student whom Katherine holds the most hope for.  In Joan, Katherine sees a little bit of herself.  Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is introduced only as the girl who, gasp, may have loose morals regarding men.  Finally Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the slightly dumpy girl who just hopes to find a man.This is really the Katherine Watson story and her influence on the girls, such as it is, and her frustration with Wellesley.  If we changed the all girls college to an all boys high school and traded Julia Roberts for Robin Williams, we'd have ""Dead Poets Society"".  But ""Dead Poets Society"" is a far better movie.  It may not be fair to compare the two movies, but when ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is so clearly modeled on ""Dead Poets Society"" how can the comparison not be made?  The main problem with ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is that it portrays 1950's Wellesley where the women are not expected to have minds after graduation nor are the expected to use them.  It is difficult to see how the issues raised in ""Mona Lisa Smile"" are relevant today.  ""Dead Poets Society"" dealt with academic pressure and the ability to think for oneself.  ""Mona Lisa Smile"" touches upon the same issues, but does so in such a way that the problems just don't feel as important.  This is all the more so because fifty years later the expectations on women in education are far different.  ""Dead Poets Society"" is much more universal.A minor issue, to place the movie in a historical context, is that I have read reviews questioning the accuracy of the portrayal of Wellesley in the 50's, and that the college was not the backwards wasteland which only expected women to marry and have children.  I can't say whether or not that is the case, but it is worth noting that the filmmakers may have twisted what facts were available to make a lesser movie.Grade: C+-Joe Sherry",3,"Dead Poets Society for Women, but not as good",1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,3380,"['Here', 'setting', 'idealistic', 'young', 'teacher', 'well', 'respected', 'private', 'school', 'intention', 'making', 'difference', 'lives', 'education', 'students', 'teacher', 'soon', 'up', 'tradition', 'bound', 'administration', 'as', 'well', 'tradition', 'students', 'Soon', 'teacher', 'win', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'inspired', 'teacher', 'administration', 'not', 'so', 'pleased', 'radical', 'new', 'ideas', 'teaching', 'methods', 'used', 'idealistic', 'young', 'teacher', 'What', 'movie', 'was', 'talking', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'above', 'description', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'changes', '2003', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'young', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'California', 'newly', 'arrived', 'prestigious', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'definite', 'ideas', 'role', 'women', '1950', 'Wellesley', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'excellent', 'school', 'prepare', 'young', 'women', 'be', 'good', 'wife', 'mother', 'academic', 'standards', 'are', 'rigorous', 'goal', ""n't"", 'woman', 'aspire', 'be', 'somebody', 'help', 'husband', 'be', 'somebody', 'Watson', 'appalled', 'resistance', 'administration', 'even', 'brightest', 'students.We', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'students', 'never', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'minds', 'lives', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Betty', 'something', 'snitch', 'consider', 'purity', 'police', 'too', 'full', 'Joan', 'Brandwyn', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'student', 'whom', 'Katherine', 'most', 'hope', 'Joan', 'Katherine', 'little', 'bit', 'herself', 'Giselle', 'Levy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'introduced', 'only', 'girl', 'who', 'gasp', 'may', 'have', 'loose', 'morals', 'regarding', 'men', 'Finally', 'Connie', 'Baker', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'slightly', 'dumpy', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'find', 'man.This', 'really', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'story', 'influence', 'girls', 'such', 'frustration', 'Wellesley', 'changed', 'girls', 'college', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'traded', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Robin', 'Williams', ""'d"", 'have', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'when', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'so', 'clearly', 'modeled', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'how', 'can', 'comparison', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'main', 'problem', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', '1950', 'Wellesley', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'have', 'minds', 'graduation', 'are', 'expected', 'use', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'issues', 'raised', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'are', 'relevant', 'today', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'dealt', 'academic', 'pressure', 'ability', 'think', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'same', 'issues', 'so', 'such', 'way', 'problems', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'important', 'more', 'so', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'expectations', 'women', 'education', 'are', 'far', 'different', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'much', 'more', 'universal.A', 'minor', 'issue', 'place', 'movie', 'historical', 'context', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'questioning', 'accuracy', 'portrayal', 'Wellesley', '50', 'college', 'was', 'not', 'backwards', 'wasteland', 'only', 'expected', 'women', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'case', 'worth', 'noting', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'have', 'twisted', 'what', 'facts', 'were', 'available', 'make', 'lesser', 'movie.Grade', 'C+-Joe', 'Sherry']",Mona Lisa Smile

Van Devender ""Gadfly""","[2, 2]","This movie has higher ambitions than it achieves but is still provides enough interest to justify the pop-corn and cuddling on the couch.Julia Roberts' performance only rises above the level of general competence once in the movie, when, at the beginning as she conducts her first class in art history, she is savaged by her students in their arrogant display of prior knowledge of her material.  Roberts conveys the horror that a new teacher on the block would feel in such a circumstance to absolute perfection.  During the rest of the movie it was intended that she embody the intriguing mystery of the Mona Lisa, hiding depths of tantalizing interest behind the mystery of her smile.  Always the painting evokes a sense of benevolent superiority as one wonders what secret knowledge constitutes her tranquility.  Roberts achieves the distance, the ""arms-length""  in relationships between her and her male and female admirers but never the sense of hidden depths that would have carried her performance over the top.  The ending is predictable but inevitable.The supporting cast is also adequate to their roles though it is hard to accept several of the characters as being only 20-21 years old... they needed younger actresses.  The male roles in this story are all inherently flawed and the characters one by one prove themselves unworthy of ""possessing"" the Mona Lisa or even deserving her respect, much less admiration.  If this is a commentary on the general state of male-female relations then the stereotypes are pretty heavy handed.All that being said, Julia Roberts is always worth watching and the photography and the setting are enough to evoke winsome nostalgia for days when spending time in the crucible of Ivy League higher education gave opportunity for dreaming big dreams, talking all night about issues and radically defending opinions which one could only maintain in splendid isolation from the harsh reality of the rest of life.Grab some popcorn and enjoy the ""chick flick.""",3,"Pleasant But Not ""Dead Poets Society""",1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1999,"['movie', 'higher', 'ambitions', 'still', 'enough', 'interest', 'justify', 'pop-corn', 'cuddling', 'couch.Julia', 'Roberts', 'performance', 'only', 'level', 'general', 'competence', 'once', 'movie', 'when', 'beginning', 'first', 'class', 'art', 'history', 'savaged', 'students', 'arrogant', 'display', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'material', 'Roberts', 'conveys', 'horror', 'new', 'teacher', 'block', 'would', 'feel', 'such', 'circumstance', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'embody', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'hiding', 'depths', 'tantalizing', 'interest', 'mystery', 'smile', 'painting', 'sense', 'benevolent', 'superiority', 'one', 'what', 'secret', 'knowledge', 'tranquility', 'Roberts', 'distance', 'arms-length', 'relationships', 'male', 'female', 'admirers', 'never', 'sense', 'hidden', 'depths', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'performance', 'top', 'ending', 'predictable', 'inevitable.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'adequate', 'roles', 'hard', 'accept', 'several', 'characters', 'being', 'only', '20-21', 'years', 'old', 'needed', 'younger', 'actresses', 'male', 'roles', 'story', 'are', 'inherently', 'flawed', 'characters', 'one', 'one', 'prove', 'unworthy', 'possessing', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'even', 'deserving', 'respect', 'much', 'less', 'admiration', 'commentary', 'general', 'state', 'male-female', 'relations', 'then', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'handed.All', 'being', 'said', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'photography', 'setting', 'are', 'enough', 'evoke', 'winsome', 'nostalgia', 'days', 'when', 'spending', 'time', 'crucible', 'Ivy', 'League', 'higher', 'education', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'dreaming', 'big', 'dreams', 'talking', 'night', 'issues', 'radically', 'defending', 'opinions', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'maintain', 'splendid', 'isolation', 'harsh', 'reality', 'rest', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'chick', 'flick']",Mona Lisa Smile

With a film title like that, who else would be appropriate?Roberts is Katherine Watson, an art history teacher from California's public university system, who has the nerve to apply for - and get - a position on the faculty of the prestigious eastern college for women, Wellesley. Watson's goal is to make a difference in the lives of her students, but her Wacky West Coast feminism is immediately at odds with staid Wellesley tradition. The college is hardly more than a finishing school for marriage-bound debutantes. After all, it's 1953 and, at least according to contemporary cultural mores and commercial advertisers, a girl's ultimate dream is to be married to a successful white-collar professional, and have a house, children, washer and dryer, and a Hoover. To make things worse, Watson's first-day presentation in Art History 100 is gutted by a class that's already read the entire course syllabus. A humiliated Katherine must go to Plan B.Watson's students are a mixed bag represented in the plot by: Betty (Kirsten Dunst), the patronizing and know-it-all editor of the school paper who's soon to be married to a young lawyer, Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the free spirit that sleeps around, and Joan (Julia Stiles), who's torn between becoming a lawyer and getting married. Katherine is determined to get Joan into Yale Law School. Of the three, Dunst gives the most poignant performance as the one whose dream comes up against hard reality. And Joan's heartfelt explanation to Watson of her final choice gives Watson pause.There are several reasons why MONA LISA SMILE is an engaging, almost-excellent film. As a period piece, it's lavish in its depiction of the music, fashion, dance, advertising, and social expectations of the time. (The pre-determined role for young women of the upper-middle and upper classes will likely cause feminists to grip the arms of their seats with a white-knuckled fury.)MONA LISA SMILE has that general gist of MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1995), i.e. the generally acknowledged but too rarely explored effect that a great teacher can have on young minds. The latter film was so excellent that, in comparison, I can't quite bring myself to award MONA LISA SMILE the same five stars. Compared to the career of Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss), which spanned decades, Watson's is a relative flash-in-the-pan over one academic year. (Also, I didn't find it so credible that Wellesley's severely conservative president should have been so surprised with Watson's non-conformity. I mean, didn't the college interview Katherine before giving her the nod, especially as she was coming from such a plebeian background? What were they thinking?)Lastly, there's Julia Roberts, who perhaps hasn't done so well in a leading role since ERIN BROCKOVICH, for which she won a Golden Globe as Best Actress. I wouldn't be surprised to see a nomination stemming from this performance. It's a genuine treat to see her again in something other than a fluffy, romantic comedy.",4,Julia's best since Brockovich?,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,3141,"['MONA', 'LISA', 'SMILE', 'beguiling', 'not', 'only', 'well-done', 'mid-1950s', 'period', 'piece', 'also', 'always-enchanting', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'film', 'title', 'who', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'Roberts', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'California', 'public', 'university', 'system', 'who', 'nerve', 'apply', 'get', 'position', 'faculty', 'prestigious', 'eastern', 'college', 'women', 'Wellesley', 'Watson', 'goal', 'make', 'difference', 'lives', 'students', 'Wacky', 'West', 'Coast', 'feminism', 'immediately', 'odds', 'staid', 'Wellesley', 'tradition', 'college', 'hardly', 'more', 'finishing', 'school', 'marriage-bound', 'debutantes', '1953', 'least', 'according', 'contemporary', 'cultural', 'mores', 'commercial', 'advertisers', 'girl', 'ultimate', 'dream', 'be', 'married', 'successful', 'white-collar', 'professional', 'have', 'house', 'children', 'washer', 'dryer', 'Hoover', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'Watson', 'first-day', 'presentation', 'Art', 'History', '100', 'gutted', 'class', 'already', 'read', 'entire', 'course', 'syllabus', 'humiliated', 'Katherine', 'must', 'go', 'Plan', 'B.Watson', 'students', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'represented', 'plot', 'Betty', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'patronizing', 'know-it-all', 'editor', 'school', 'paper', 'who', 'soon', 'be', 'married', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Giselle', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'free', 'spirit', 'around', 'Joan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'torn', 'becoming', 'lawyer', 'getting', 'married', 'Katherine', 'determined', 'get', 'Joan', 'Yale', 'Law', 'School', 'three', 'Dunst', 'most', 'poignant', 'performance', 'one', 'dream', 'up', 'hard', 'reality', 'Joan', 'heartfelt', 'explanation', 'Watson', 'final', 'choice', 'Watson', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'MONA', 'LISA', 'SMILE', 'engaging', 'almost-excellent', 'film', 'period', 'piece', 'lavish', 'depiction', 'music', 'fashion', 'dance', 'advertising', 'social', 'expectations', 'time', 'pre-determined', 'role', 'young', 'women', 'upper-middle', 'upper', 'classes', 'will', 'likely', 'cause', 'feminists', 'grip', 'arms', 'seats', 'white-knuckled', 'fury', 'MONA', 'LISA', 'SMILE', 'general', 'gist', 'MR.', 'HOLLAND', 'OPUS', '1995', 'i.e', 'generally', 'acknowledged', 'too', 'rarely', 'explored', 'effect', 'great', 'teacher', 'can', 'have', 'young', 'minds', 'latter', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', 'comparison', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'award', 'MONA', 'LISA', 'SMILE', 'same', 'five', 'stars', 'Compared', 'career', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'spanned', 'decades', 'Watson', 'relative', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'one', 'academic', 'year', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'credible', 'Wellesley', 'severely', 'conservative', 'president', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'surprised', 'Watson', 'non-conformity', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'college', 'interview', 'Katherine', 'giving', 'nod', 'especially', 'was', 'coming', 'plebeian', 'background', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Lastly', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'well', 'leading', 'role', 'ERIN', 'BROCKOVICH', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'nomination', 'stemming', 'performance', 'genuine', 'treat', 'see', 'again', 'something', 'other', 'fluffy', 'romantic', 'comedy']",Mona Lisa Smile

The movie doesn't have the same rom-com mood that movies like ""Failure to Launch"" and ""Must Love Dogs"" share, but instead shares a closer bond with films like ""The Cider House Rules"" sans the depressing aspect. The movie is essentially a star vehicle for Julia Roberts, but her female co-stars Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Ginnifer Goodwin all steal the show from her.Roberts plays Katherine Watson, a teacher from California who lands a job at the prestigious Wellesley school. The film takes place in the '50s where women went to school not to go on to get successful jobs but merely to bridge the gap between school and marriage. She's the teacher of art history and upon her arrival meets a number of rebelling and strong-willed young females, including the hateful Betty (Dunst), the free-spirited Giselle (Gyllenhaal), and the optimistic Joan (Stiles)...As Katherine adjusts to her new job and it's strict rules, she finds herself falling for a womanizing Italian teacher (Dominic West) and that's pretty much all the plot you're going to get from this film.The movie is one of those films that relies heavily on the charm of its actors to keep the film moving and it works. All the actors are fascinating to watch and all the actresses I mentioned above steal the show from Roberts.

The only twist is Julia Roberts in the role previously owned by Robin Williams and a bunch of girls instead of a bunch of boys.But ""Mona lisa smile"" is worse than ""Dead poets society"". Characterization, story, emotion, everything is worse. Julia Roberts, although still very beautiful, didn't convince me for a single moment that she was a 50s character. Julia is THE actress of the 90s, and her unexpected lack of charm and, seemingly, lack of will to portrait a woman from 50 years ago (even if it was a ""modern"" woman for that age standards) spoiled the movie for me. In fact, Marcia Gay Harden steals every scene she's in; she's convincent in her role.The love-affair is innocuous and tasteless, even stupid.

Maybe because for some ""Mona Lisa Smile"" was too feminist, and for others not feminist enough.  But let me try to make you understand why this film, while not perfect, is definitely worth a look.First of all, in terms of politics, mentalities, clothes, and music, it does a great job of recapturing the early 1950s.  Second, while the story might be just a little bit hokey (a brilliant young female professor heads to an elite women's college to shake things up), the movie has quite a group of legitimate issues to raise and then examine.  And this is all done with some of the finest young actresses working today.Many critics say that because the sexual revolution is over (and that's debatable--just watch ""The Apprentice"" on NBC!), the lessons of ""Mona Lisa Smile"" don't matter any more.

797575,A2EBR70V6P9W0N,B0001ADAVK,"karhill54 ""karhill54""","[3, 3]","(SOME MINOR SPOILERS BELOW; ALSO SPOILERS FOR DPS)...but I love this film. I've read most of the negative reviews both here and on IMDB, and I can't help but agree with many of the criticisms, particularly where time-period and anachronistic elements are concerned. I know that every 1950's clich&eacute; is at maximum wattage and Katherine Watson arrives at Wellesley College not on a train but in a Way-Back Time Machine from the 21st Century. Many of the main characters are one-dimensional and unconvincing and the plot is plodding and predictable. I understand that it's probably meant to channel the spirit of ""Dead Poets Society"" for women a little bit, and I can see that some of the main values taught by the respective teachers in each are similar, but DPS hit audiences on a deeper level, with a darker ending. I mean, one could hardly compare Neil Perry's suicide to Betty Warren's divorce. Professor Keating is blamed for Neil's suicide and is fired, but in the end no one blames Katherine for Betty's divorce (except maybe Betty's mother) and Katherine makes her own decision to leave Wellesley. The students in MLS are grown-up, college seniors ready for ""real"" life; the boys in DPS are all still just high-school kids. Professor Keating is loved almost immediately and absolutely by nearly all of his students; Katherine has to slowly earn the respect of her students, one at a time.Despite the critics, I do believe that there ARE truths in MLS, if only because my mother, who lived and attended college at that time, pointed them out to me. She confirmed that most of the young women she attended school with were NOT in college because they had dreams and ambitions of high-powered careers. None of the girls in her classes, dorm or sorority wanted to be scientists, bank managers, lawyers, doctors or CEO's (that she knew of, anyway.) Most of them viewed post-graduate employment (as a bookkeeping clerk, secretary/receptionist, a nurse, or the main career option - a teacher) as simply a way to make a living until Mr. Right came along or as a way to pass the time and supplement their income for a few years after marrying until the kids started coming.That doesn't mean they didn't appreciate their college education. Though my mother admitted freely to being one of those women who cared more about getting an ""MRS"" than a BofA, she said a good many of the girls were quite interested in the outside world, artistic freedom, literature, philosophy, politics and current events. She knew a few young women who continued on to graduate school or nursing school, but she knew of only one person whom she called ""career-oriented"" at that time, and that girl's eventual goal was to be a school principal like her own mother was. For the most part, in my mother's experience, the girls she knew in college weren't all that different from the girls in MLS. My college experience 30 years later was different. The girls I knew in college were there because of what they wanted to achieve professionally, not to look for mates.I still love the look of the film; the costumes, cars, building interiors, the campus scenery, as well as the music, both the period music and the score. I sympathized with poor Nancy Abbey whose dreams of a home and family are fading, and Giselle who was looking so hard for male approval and companionship to make up for the father who left when she was still young and impressionable. I at first hated Betty Warren along with everyone else, but I truly felt sorry for her in the end. Spencer Jones is unpleasant enough, but Jordan Bridges is a very mediocre actor. He just came across as flat and wooden.Even though I know intellectually that the 1950's were not the idyllic, simple time our contemporary culture has made them out to be, this film reaches me on an emotional level and has the power to make me feel pleasantly nostalgic for a time that at least seemed a little more stable than the time I grew up in.",5,I can't help it...,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,3962,"['SOME', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW', 'ALSO', 'SPOILERS', 'FOR', 'DPS', 'love', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'IMDB', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'agree', 'many', 'criticisms', 'particularly', 'where', 'time-period', 'anachronistic', 'elements', 'are', 'concerned', 'know', '1950', 'clich', 'eacute', 'maximum', 'wattage', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'not', 'train', 'Way-Back', 'Time', 'Machine', '21st', 'Century', 'Many', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'unconvincing', 'plot', 'plodding', 'predictable', 'understand', 'probably', 'meant', 'channel', 'spirit', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'women', 'little', 'bit', 'can', 'see', 'main', 'values', 'taught', 'respective', 'teachers', 'are', 'similar', 'DPS', 'hit', 'audiences', 'deeper', 'level', 'darker', 'ending', 'mean', 'one', 'could', 'hardly', 'compare', 'Neil', 'Perry', 'suicide', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'divorce', 'Professor', 'Keating', 'blamed', 'Neil', 'suicide', 'fired', 'end', 'one', 'Katherine', 'Betty', 'divorce', 'maybe', 'Betty', 'mother', 'Katherine', 'own', 'decision', 'leave', 'Wellesley', 'students', 'MLS', 'are', 'grown-up', 'college', 'seniors', 'ready', 'real', 'life', 'boys', 'DPS', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'high-school', 'kids', 'Professor', 'Keating', 'loved', 'almost', 'immediately', 'absolutely', 'nearly', 'students', 'Katherine', 'slowly', 'earn', 'respect', 'students', 'one', 'time.Despite', 'critics', 'do', 'believe', 'ARE', 'truths', 'MLS', 'only', 'mother', 'who', 'lived', 'attended', 'college', 'time', 'pointed', 'out', 'confirmed', 'most', 'young', 'women', 'attended', 'school', 'were', 'NOT', 'college', 'had', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'high-powered', 'careers', 'None', 'girls', 'classes', 'dorm', 'sorority', 'wanted', 'be', 'scientists', 'bank', 'managers', 'lawyers', 'doctors', 'CEO', 'knew', 'anyway', 'Most', 'viewed', 'post-graduate', 'employment', 'bookkeeping', 'clerk', 'secretary/receptionist', 'nurse', 'main', 'career', 'option', 'teacher', 'simply', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'Mr', 'Right', 'came', 'along', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'supplement', 'income', 'few', 'years', 'marrying', 'kids', 'started', 'coming.That', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'college', 'education', 'mother', 'admitted', 'freely', 'being', 'one', 'women', 'who', 'cared', 'more', 'getting', 'MRS', 'BofA', 'said', 'good', 'many', 'girls', 'were', 'quite', 'interested', 'outside', 'world', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'literature', 'philosophy', 'politics', 'current', 'events', 'knew', 'few', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'continued', 'graduate', 'school', 'nursing', 'school', 'knew', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'whom', 'called', 'career-oriented', 'time', 'girl', 'eventual', 'goal', 'was', 'be', 'school', 'principal', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'mother', 'experience', 'girls', 'knew', 'college', 'were', ""n't"", 'different', 'girls', 'MLS', 'college', 'experience', '30', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'different', 'girls', 'knew', 'college', 'were', 'there', 'what', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'professionally', 'not', 'look', 'mates.I', 'still', 'love', 'look', 'film', 'costumes', 'cars', 'building', 'interiors', 'campus', 'scenery', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'period', 'music', 'score', 'sympathized', 'poor', 'Nancy', 'Abbey', 'dreams', 'home', 'family', 'are', 'fading', 'Giselle', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'so', 'hard', 'male', 'approval', 'companionship', 'make', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'impressionable', 'first', 'hated', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'everyone', 'else', 'truly', 'felt', 'sorry', 'end', 'Spencer', 'Jones', 'unpleasant', 'enough', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'very', 'mediocre', 'actor', 'just', 'came', 'flat', 'wooden.Even', 'know', 'intellectually', '1950', 'were', 'not', 'idyllic', 'simple', 'time', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'emotional', 'level', 'power', 'make', 'feel', 'pleasantly', 'nostalgic', 'time', 'least', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'stable', 'time', 'grew', 'up']",Mona Lisa Smile
797576,AES7RYBQDI2T2,B0001ADAVK,Kari Murphy,"[2, 2]","Just saw this movie, based upon a 30-something professor of Art History, traveling solo from California to prestigious Wellesley. Her mission, revealed as it occurs...to deliver an unconventional, challenging style of education for young women, who have the right to be more than a breeder.As a younger, i was captive to the TV sitcoms, Donna Reed, Leave It to Beaver, Lassie, Father Knows Best, Dick Van Dyke and even Bewitched...women were homemakers, whose existence was solely for the husband and family. This film was a delightful antithesis to the programming of the 50's and 60's! Julia Roberts is sublimely compared (by reviewer Bret Frazer) to classic movie stars, like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, and even Katherine Hepburn, for her ability to effortlessly ""own"" a movie with her performance, and boy howdy, does she do it well! She literally, subtlety commands the screen, in a completely vulnerable, yet determined manner, as Katherine Watson. Miss Watson is condescended at every opportunity for her background, her home state, her poverty (from yucky California!) and her ""old maid"" status.In one of the first scenes,(one of my favorites) Miss Watson finds herself immediately confronted by a pretentious pack of intellectual lionesses. They attack with brutal efficiency, formed from old money, education, and malicious poise....trust kittens, ingrained with beliefs counter to self actualization...quite vicious with verbal assaults and subliminal threats.As the movie unfolds, education, maturity, romance, roles, ideas and realities are explored...the pupils feline claws are slowly retracted as the teacher is seen for her uniquely brave character, strong values, and willingness to stand against established mores.Of note in the supporting cast, my two favorites: Kirsten Dunst plays repressed anger with venomous aplomb and Maggie Gyllenhaal is compelling as the group's pariah, the shameful bad girl...the scarlet letter of a divorced family. Gyllenhaal's character is more than likeable, developing survivor skills and heroic sensitivity on her own path of destructive awakening.  Mike Newell scores another base hit in his successful career as a director who captures real life on film, the same way Life magazine displayed photographs...The movie is enchanting, and damn, it is simply GOOD!",5,Fabulous Feminism in the Fifties,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,2315,"['Just', 'saw', 'movie', 'based', '30-something', 'professor', 'Art', 'History', 'traveling', 'solo', 'California', 'prestigious', 'Wellesley', 'mission', 'revealed', 'deliver', 'unconventional', 'challenging', 'style', 'education', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'more', 'breeder.As', 'younger', 'i', 'was', 'captive', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Lassie', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'even', 'Bewitched', 'women', 'were', 'homemakers', 'existence', 'was', 'solely', 'husband', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'delightful', 'antithesis', 'programming', '50', '60', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'sublimely', 'compared', 'reviewer', 'Bret', 'Frazer', 'classic', 'movie', 'stars', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'even', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'ability', 'effortlessly', 'own', 'movie', 'performance', 'boy', 'howdy', 'do', 'well', 'literally', 'subtlety', 'screen', 'completely', 'vulnerable', 'yet', 'determined', 'manner', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Miss', 'Watson', 'condescended', 'opportunity', 'background', 'home', 'state', 'poverty', 'yucky', 'California', 'old', 'maid', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'one', 'favorites', 'Miss', 'Watson', 'immediately', 'confronted', 'pretentious', 'pack', 'intellectual', 'lionesses', 'attack', 'brutal', 'efficiency', 'formed', 'old', 'money', 'education', 'malicious', 'poise', '.trust', 'kittens', 'ingrained', 'beliefs', 'counter', 'self', 'actualization', 'quite', 'vicious', 'verbal', 'assaults', 'subliminal', 'threats.As', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'education', 'maturity', 'romance', 'roles', 'ideas', 'realities', 'are', 'explored', 'pupils', 'feline', 'claws', 'are', 'slowly', 'retracted', 'teacher', 'seen', 'uniquely', 'brave', 'character', 'strong', 'values', 'willingness', 'stand', 'established', 'mores.Of', 'note', 'supporting', 'cast', 'two', 'favorites', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'repressed', 'anger', 'venomous', 'aplomb', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'compelling', 'group', 'pariah', 'shameful', 'bad', 'girl', 'scarlet', 'letter', 'divorced', 'family', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'more', 'likeable', 'developing', 'survivor', 'skills', 'heroic', 'sensitivity', 'own', 'path', 'destructive', 'awakening', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'base', 'hit', 'successful', 'career', 'director', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'Life', 'magazine', 'displayed', 'photographs', 'movie', 'enchanting', 'damn', 'simply', 'GOOD']",Mona Lisa Smile
797577,A2O7P0578BBFBB,B0001ADAVK,K. Doyle,"[1, 1]","Wondering why this movie was so unbelievably facile?  The writers Konner and Rosenthal were simply out of their element.  Look at their shared history: Planet of the Apes (2001), Superman IV, Star Trek VI, TV shows Cagney & Lacey, Remington Steele.  No wonder this movie is off the mark.  The acting is good, the music and photography too, but the hack writing totally ruined it.You have to suspend disbelief right from the get go-- the idea that an ENTIRE CLASS of college students, especially the most well-to-do in the country (likely the most spoiled) would have read and fully comprehended the entire textbook for the class before the first day just so they could make the new teacher look stupid?  A humorous situation I suppose, but no real teacher could ever believe that.  And the hero, fully aware the Italian teacher is a philanderer, chooses to sleep with him anyway then is disappointed when she finds out he's made up a colorful history of his war exploits when actually he had a desk job and never left the states?  It's not like she seemed to be expecting anything deep out of him anyway,  so what's the big deal?  And other than the fact it's about an art teacher, the title doesn't otherwise seem to have much to do with anything-- there's a missed opportunity. There are a lot of things that don't add up very well here, or are underdeveloped.  Suspending disbelief is fine for sci-fi and action films, but this film seems on the surface that it could be based in reality, with a feel-good message that ends up being pretty shallow-- suspending disbelief to get there is just not effective.

797578,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0001ADAVK,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[2, 3]","This film was okay. Honestly I've tried to come up with a better word, but I think 'okay' conveys it well. I'll divide my review into good and bad, and as you'll see, the two come out pretty even in the end - like i said: okay.As other reviewers note - and I can't emphasize enough - this film is NOT simply a revamped ""Dead Poet's Society"". Yes, many details are the same: the private school v. the liberationist rebel of a teacher. Beyond that, all comparison is an injustice. This film has a different mood, script and certainly different message.The acting was another good feature: Julia Stiles, Kirsten Dunst (who steals the show as the student antagonist) Julia Roberts and the others (whom I do not know by name, but if the film is any indication, I will someday). This is truly an ensemble cast with no weak spots and each character/actor supporting the others.Now to the bad: unfortunately, for all its differences from 'Dead Poets Society"", this film is still quite cliche. Not so much that you don't want to watch, but just enough where, since you know that you know what will happen, there is absolutely no dramatic tension in the film. And it is not only the main plot that is cliche, but the sub-plots (with the exception of a twist in 'Julia Stiles's' story-line) are too easy to guess at.Now for the big flaw - the fatal flaw without which the film would've squeezed four stars out of me. The message of the main story line - the struggle for 'traditional Wellsley women' to liberate from the social roles alloted them - no matter how noble, was simply overdone. Of course, the message is a damn good one, but seemed to me that it was so 'in your face' through the whole film, that any depth the film could have had was suffocated by it.Okay: yes I am a male who, in 1950, was twenty years away from even being an idea in my parents minds. I am aware that my perspective might be checkered. But it has been confirmed by EVERY SINGLE person I know of the appropriate age who has seen the film. Not to deny that things were bad and that this film shows those things well. But - let me put it in the words of my mother - in the movie, there is not a single male character who does not have a major character flaw, and in reality, things just weren't that black and white. Basically, the problem is that the film is just too black and white and because of that, you find yourself saying: ""Enough already. I get the point.""So there you have it: okay. To put it another way, I liked it enough to consider spending the money for the DVD; I just probably won't watch this one as much as some of my others.",3,Decent plot and script; message was overdone!,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2614,"['film', 'was', 'okay', 'Honestly', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'word', 'think', 'conveys', 'well', ""'ll"", 'divide', 'review', 'good', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'see', 'two', 'come', 'pretty', 'even', 'end', 'i', 'said', 'okay.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'note', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'enough', 'film', 'NOT', 'simply', 'revamped', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Yes', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'same', 'private', 'school', 'liberationist', 'rebel', 'teacher', 'Beyond', 'comparison', 'injustice', 'film', 'different', 'mood', 'script', 'certainly', 'different', 'message.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'feature', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'show', 'student', 'antagonist', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'others', 'whom', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'name', 'film', 'indication', 'will', 'someday', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'weak', 'spots', 'character/actor', 'supporting', 'others.Now', 'bad', 'unfortunately', 'differences', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'film', 'still', 'quite', 'cliche', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'just', 'enough', 'where', 'know', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'absolutely', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'plot', 'cliche', 'sub-plots', 'exception', 'twist', ""'Julia"", 'Stiles', 'story-line', 'are', 'too', 'easy', 'guess', 'at.Now', 'big', 'flaw', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'squeezed', 'four', 'stars', 'message', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'struggle', ""'traditional"", 'Wellsley', 'women', 'liberate', 'social', 'roles', 'alloted', 'matter', 'how', 'noble', 'was', 'simply', 'overdone', 'course', 'message', 'damn', 'good', 'one', 'seemed', 'was', 'so', ""'in"", 'face', 'whole', 'film', 'depth', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'was', 'suffocated', 'it.Okay', 'yes', 'am', 'male', 'who', '1950', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'away', 'even', 'being', 'idea', 'parents', 'am', 'aware', 'perspective', 'might', 'be', 'checkered', 'been', 'confirmed', 'EVERY', 'SINGLE', 'person', 'know', 'appropriate', 'age', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'Not', 'deny', 'things', 'were', 'bad', 'film', 'things', 'well', 'let', 'put', 'words', 'mother', 'movie', 'not', 'single', 'male', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'major', 'character', 'flaw', 'reality', 'things', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'black', 'white', 'Basically', 'problem', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'black', 'white', 'find', 'saying', 'Enough', 'already', 'get', 'point', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'okay', 'put', 'way', 'liked', 'enough', 'consider', 'spending', 'money', 'DVD', 'just', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'others']",Mona Lisa Smile
797579,AU1XXY2S6FZQ2,B0001ADAVK,K,"[18, 28]","I had heard some truly wonderful things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it. Mona Lisa Smile tells the story of a professor (Julia Roberts) who starts teaching Art History, or Appreciation, or something at Wellesley (an all-girls school). There are several big name young actresses-I mean students in her class. And they're all know-it-alls.The movie wants to be the ""girls' version of Dead Poet's Society"" so bad that the creators of DPS should be looking into a slander lawsuit because it is insulting what they do to what was originally a really good movie. Katherine Watson (Roberts) came to Wellesley to make a difference and she was not going to take no for an answer. So, when the actresses-I mean students outsmart her, she has to make the class more difficult. Because I guess they're not *really* learning until Watson has taught them. And Watson is not going to just teach them about Art. No. She's gonna teach them about *life* and that they don't have to get married and have babies. They can be whatever they want because they are soooo smart. And if they want to get married and have babies, then they're just in denial. Because Watson knows everything! Sadly, no one dies unlike in the original DPS.There's the antagonist, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), who hates Watson, but in the end, loves her the most. The protagonist, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), who respects Watson, but in the end teaches Watson a life lesson. The morally ambivalent wanna-be, Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who wants to be Watson. And the ""ugly, fat girl"", Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin), who just wants to be liked by a boy.Most of the acting was very cardboard. I am not sure whether to blame this on the script, the director, or the actors. Julia Roberts looked exactly the same as she has looked in her past 5 movies. Same ""smile"" theme, same bursting laugh, same ""unliked-girl"" who really is a pretty woman (ha!) deep down. She's turning into Meg Ryan by picking the same character over and over again.Kirsten Dunst's character was a little too whiney and in the end, when Betty Warren does the ""morphosis"", it is not believable. Even if it was believable, then we wouldn't really care because the way she was portrayed would be akin to feeling sympathy for Atilla the Hun.Julia Stiles was the only one whose character seemed to remain consistant. I am not sure if this is because of her acting or because the script didn't call for a ""character evolution"". Either way, Joan was still boring and lifeless.Maggie Gyllenhaal is beautiful and sexy and boy is Giselle a sexually free spirit in this movie. Hmm...Secretary, anyone? But, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that student-teacher relationship/affair thing.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[2, 3]","""I thought I was headed to a place that would turn out tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.""It would be easy to say ""here we go again"" with this film, because Mona Lisa Smile follows much of a plot we have all seen many times before. It is yet another take on the ""good-hearted yet radical and initially misunderstood teacher making a difference to the lives of troubled students while battling the stiff-upper lips of the conservative school establishment"" story. Heard it all before haven't you? It's The Emperor's Club at a pinch and Dead Poets Society without a doubt, but with one major difference. This time it's girls in the main roles of teacher and students. A sort of ""Dead Poets for chicks"" if you like. It's even set in the 1950s New England area of America in an ultra-conservative and extremely well-to-do college, so the parallels with the Peter Weir classic of 1989 are uncanny. A pretty decent ensemble cast has been gathered for this film with the likes of Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Marcia Gay Harden all playing major roles, while directing duties are handled by Mike Newell, the bloke responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco among others.Julia Roberts stars as Katherine Watson. She has just arrived at the elitist Wellesley College in Massachusetts to teach art history to the bevy of wealthy young ladies who attend the college. Katherine is in her early 30s, is single, and hails from California. She carries with her a slightly new-age way of looking at things. This is probably the most implausible aspect of the film since her character seems more like a late 60s model of woman rather than the 1953 version. Anyway, she lands at the famous college for young ladies to teach the history of art, and from day one realises she is in for more than she initially expected.The girls enrolled in her first class are all completely versed in practically everything she tries to teach them in the first lesson. It seems they have learnt their textbooks by rote and are simply looking for an easy pass in this most boring of subjects. It doesn't take long before Katherine realises with some angst that most of the girls attending the college are merely biding their time before they get married to some eligible young beau, most probably from neighbouring Harvard University. Wellesley is merely a finishing school disguised as a college, she laments. This theory is reinforced when she learns there are even lessons for the girls on such subjects as grooming and deportment, manners, and incredibly, how to stage a dinner party properly. But Katherine wants to fight these archaic traditions and so tries to open the girls' minds to some alternative ways of looking at things (such as modern art), and also raises the possibility of them pursuing other things after they leave the college - such as going to law school. It is this latter point that she presses home with the incredibly bright Joan (Julia Stiles), who is intelligent enough to pursue a law career, but has not looked past the fact that she will hopefully be married and caring for her new husband when she leaves college. At the same time Katherine manages to exact the venom of another student and editor of the school newspaper, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst). Betty is about to be married and cannot possibly imagine why Miss Watson would be campaigning for her students to be thinking of anything other than a home, a husband and a family. Her vitriolic attacks in the paper attract the attention of the faculty, and worse, the alumni, which includes Betty's mother and seems all-powerful at making staffing decisions for the school. Katherine is also feeling the wrath of the faculty when she starts to become romantically involved with the Italian professor, Bill Dunbar (Dominic West) which is just one of a fair handful of romantic liaisons that form the basis of this story. Can Katherine make the girls see the error of their way and convince them to see past a life tied to the kitchen and vacuum cleaner? And can she do this before she gets the boot from the conservative and staid school establishment? Well you'll just have to watch to find out.There isn't much original about this story at all - we've seen it all before and truth be told in a much better way. I remember walking out of the cinema after seeing this and wondering just how do scriptwriters get away with lifting so much material and inspiration from another film. It is really quite obvious that Dead Poets Society has formed the core of this script idea, but for some reason all the really good bits of that film, the pure agony of being a teenager and living with parental expectations - the emotional centre if you like - has been removed. What we are left with is a rather pedestrian, by-the-numbers film that will entertain, but will hardly make anyone think too hard.",3,"Entertaining,but lacks originality.",1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,4900,"['thought', 'was', 'headed', 'place', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'tomorrow', 'leaders', 'not', 'wives', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'say', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'film', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'much', 'plot', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'yet', 'take', 'good-hearted', 'yet', 'radical', 'initially', 'misunderstood', 'teacher', 'making', 'difference', 'lives', 'troubled', 'students', 'battling', 'stiff-upper', 'lips', 'conservative', 'school', 'establishment', 'story', 'Heard', 'before', 'have', ""n't"", 'Emperor', 'Club', 'pinch', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'doubt', 'one', 'major', 'difference', 'time', 'girls', 'main', 'roles', 'teacher', 'students', 'sort', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'chicks', 'like', 'even', 'set', '1950s', 'New', 'England', 'area', 'America', 'ultra-conservative', 'extremely', 'well-to-do', 'college', 'parallels', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'classic', '1989', 'are', 'uncanny', 'pretty', 'decent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'been', 'gathered', 'film', 'likes', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'playing', 'major', 'roles', 'directing', 'duties', 'are', 'handled', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'bloke', 'responsible', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'others.Julia', 'Roberts', 'stars', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'just', 'arrived', 'elitist', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'Massachusetts', 'teach', 'art', 'history', 'bevy', 'wealthy', 'young', 'ladies', 'who', 'attend', 'college', 'Katherine', 'early', '30s', 'single', 'hails', 'California', 'slightly', 'new-age', 'way', 'looking', 'things', 'probably', 'most', 'implausible', 'aspect', 'film', 'character', 'more', 'late', '60s', 'model', 'woman', 'rather', '1953', 'version', 'Anyway', 'famous', 'college', 'young', 'ladies', 'teach', 'history', 'art', 'day', 'one', 'more', 'initially', 'expected.The', 'girls', 'enrolled', 'first', 'class', 'are', 'completely', 'versed', 'practically', 'everything', 'teach', 'first', 'lesson', 'have', 'learnt', 'textbooks', 'rote', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'easy', 'pass', 'most', 'boring', 'subjects', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'before', 'Katherine', 'angst', 'most', 'girls', 'attending', 'college', 'are', 'merely', 'biding', 'time', 'get', 'married', 'eligible', 'young', 'beau', 'most', 'probably', 'neighbouring', 'Harvard', 'University', 'Wellesley', 'merely', 'finishing', 'school', 'disguised', 'college', 'theory', 'reinforced', 'when', 'are', 'even', 'lessons', 'girls', 'such', 'subjects', 'grooming', 'deportment', 'manners', 'incredibly', 'how', 'stage', 'dinner', 'party', 'properly', 'Katherine', 'fight', 'archaic', 'traditions', 'so', 'tries', 'open', 'girls', 'minds', 'alternative', 'ways', 'looking', 'things', 'such', 'modern', 'art', 'also', 'possibility', 'pursuing', 'other', 'things', 'leave', 'college', 'such', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'latter', 'point', 'home', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'Joan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'pursue', 'law', 'career', 'not', 'looked', 'fact', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'married', 'caring', 'new', 'husband', 'when', 'college', 'same', 'time', 'Katherine', 'exact', 'venom', 'student', 'editor', 'school', 'newspaper', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Betty', 'be', 'married', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'why', 'Miss', 'Watson', 'would', 'be', 'campaigning', 'students', 'be', 'thinking', 'anything', 'other', 'home', 'husband', 'family', 'vitriolic', 'attacks', 'paper', 'attention', 'faculty', 'worse', 'alumni', 'Betty', 'mother', 'all-powerful', 'making', 'staffing', 'decisions', 'school', 'Katherine', 'also', 'feeling', 'wrath', 'faculty', 'when', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Italian', 'professor', 'Bill', 'Dunbar', 'Dominic', 'West', 'just', 'one', 'fair', 'handful', 'romantic', 'liaisons', 'form', 'basis', 'story', 'Can', 'Katherine', 'make', 'girls', 'see', 'error', 'way', 'convince', 'see', 'life', 'tied', 'kitchen', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'can', 'do', 'boot', 'conservative', 'staid', 'school', 'establishment', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'original', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'remember', 'walking', 'cinema', 'seeing', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'do', 'scriptwriters', 'get', 'away', 'lifting', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'inspiration', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'formed', 'core', 'script', 'idea', 'reason', 'really', 'good', 'bits', 'film', 'pure', 'agony', 'being', 'teenager', 'living', 'parental', 'expectations', 'emotional', 'centre', 'like', 'been', 'removed', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'by-the-numbers', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'will', 'hardly', 'make', 'anyone', 'think', 'too', 'hard']",Mona Lisa Smile

Roberts plays the new non-traditional art history teacher who challenges the Wellesley girls beyond their expected gender roles.Although convincing in other scenes, Roberts is less convincing as a college teacher, and many of the other characters are almost caricatures, not believable as real personalities.  The rudeness is often exaggerated, and although the background is indeed of the 1950s, somehow it is not convincingly presented.  It comes across as a 2003 film with a 1950s theme.If not critically analyzed, however, it is a light and interesting feel-good film with the added bonus of a little gender role history, a little art history, and a little romance, as was most likely its intention.",4,Chick Flick with a Touch of History,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,1027,"['Set', 'campus', 'conservative', 'Wellesley', 'College', '1953-1954', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'story', 'gender', 'roles', 'art', 'romance.An', 'interesting', 'fast-paced', 'story', 'great', 'potential', 'were', 'attention', 'given', 'historic', 'detail', 'instead', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'most', 'familiar', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'fans', 'Roberts', 'new', 'non-traditional', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'who', 'Wellesley', 'girls', 'expected', 'gender', 'roles.Although', 'convincing', 'other', 'scenes', 'Roberts', 'less', 'convincing', 'college', 'teacher', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'caricatures', 'not', 'believable', 'real', 'personalities', 'rudeness', 'often', 'exaggerated', 'background', 'indeed', '1950s', 'somehow', 'not', 'convincingly', 'presented', '2003', 'film', '1950s', 'theme.If', 'not', 'critically', 'analyzed', 'however', 'light', 'interesting', 'feel-good', 'film', 'added', 'bonus', 'little', 'gender', 'role', 'history', 'little', 'art', 'history', 'little', 'romance', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'intention']",Mona Lisa Smile
797583,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0001ADAVK,Larry VanDeSande,"[4, 5]","Here's the rare film from Hollywood that features a cast full of beautiful (mostly young) woman...and is about ideas! A chick flick with feeling and intelligence. Quite the rarity!Based on ideas stolen from Ayn Rand's famous book, ""The Fountainhead"", this movie pits new wave scholar Julia Roberts against all-woman Wellesley College and its ultraconservative ways in the 1950s. Roberts seeks to bust out of the mold by teaching modern art, while the students and management of the university seek to keep her in her place. The ending is about what you might expect as both sides get what they want.What I found most remarkable about this film is the cast is full of young woman -- most of whom that made their mark in cheerleader movies -- playing intelligent young Stepford wife sexpots doing intellectual battle with the new teacher. Roberts wins over many of the youngsters but fails in her larger effort -- to fast forward their thinking to the independent women's movement style two decades ahead of the time portrayed in this film.In this way, the flick is akin to a female remake of ""The Man In the Gray Flannel Suit"", where Gregory Peck sought to fight against the traditions of his time...and failed. Still, the heroic effort, mated to the relationships and dynamics created by the female cast, is reason to watch this movie. All the beautiful women that cascade to and fro becomes a delightful sidebar.I did not expect to enjoy this film -- much less respect it -- and I avoided it when it came out. My wife wanted to see it, of course. When we finally saw it together, she said she was glad she didn't spend money at the theater on it. In contrast, I found the battle of ideas won me over in a way I did not anticipate.I wish someone other than Julia Roberts played the lead, a more realistic intellectual risk-taker, but that's small potatoes.

797584,A1JG9920BAIQTD,B0001ADAVK,Lauren,"[10, 12]","3 stars for three reasons: Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Marcia Gay Harden. (I loved Topher Grace's appearance too, but there wasn't enough of him to warrant 4 stars.) What about Julia Roberts, you ask? Well, Julia Roberts is a great actress, no doubt about it. But she just didn't fit the role. Another reviewer said it well -- she's just too modern to be in a movie taking place in the '50s.Roberts plays Katherine Watson, a pre-feminism feminist who goes to Welsley College as an art history teacher, hoping to make a difference in the young women's lives. During her stay at the school, a few students stand out in her class -- Elizabeth Warren (Kirsten Dunst), Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Connie Baker (Gennifer Goodwin). The movie focuses on these five women -- Elizabeth's struggle to be the perfect 1950s housewife, despite her husband's lack of interest in being her husband; Joan's dilemma about whether to attend Yale University or marry her boyfriend (Topher Grace); Giselle's struggle with her reputation, as well as harboring feelings for a professor; Connie's struggle to, well, to love herself; and Katherine's struggle to bring the young women around to her feminist point of view.The problem with this movie is that, apart from being cliched, Katherine Watson is not a very likeable person. She constantly tries to force others into her way of thinking, particularly Joan. Joan makes a decision in the movie that shocks Katherine,  who does not for a second consider that maybe Joan's choice was what made her happy. Add Katherine's completely unconvincing romance with a fellow teacher (the same object of Giselle's affections) and you have a boring, unlikeable central character.However, some of the students are very engaging and likeable. Elizabeth makes a startling transformation by the end that is actuall quite believable. Giselle -- well, she's played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is emerging as one of the best young actresses in Hollywood. This alone will make you like her character, but Giselle in her own right is a good person who is just lonely. Connie is the most endearing character -- you can't help but root for her. Joan is one you can respect, and she is played by the very respectable Julia Stulies. In all, the students were much better characters than Katherine.However, there is one as-yet-unmentioned character -- that of Katherine's housemate, Nancy Abbey, played by Marcia Gay Harden. Nancy is a great character -- graceless, yet sympathetic, enshrouded in such a cloud of sadness that we wonder throughout the movie if she might be a bit mad. Marcia Gay Harden is absolutely terrific in this movie, and outshone Julia Roberts in every scene they appeared in together.This movie is certainly not innovative or clever, and as I've stated several times, the central character is not very endearing. However, it does have its feel-good moments, and the young actresses are outstanding. Recommended if there's nothing better on. You probably won't wonder in horror where your last two hours went, but you certainly won't be thinking about it for long after the movie ends.",3,Could've been much better,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,3159,"['3', 'stars', 'three', 'reasons', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'loved', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'appearance', 'too', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'warrant', '4', 'stars', 'What', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'ask', 'Well', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'great', 'actress', 'doubt', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'reviewer', 'said', 'well', 'just', 'too', 'modern', 'be', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', ""'50s.Roberts"", 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'pre-feminism', 'feminist', 'who', 'Welsley', 'College', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'hoping', 'make', 'difference', 'young', 'women', 'lives', 'stay', 'school', 'few', 'students', 'stand', 'out', 'class', 'Elizabeth', 'Warren', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Joan', 'Brandwyn', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Giselle', 'Levy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Connie', 'Baker', 'Gennifer', 'Goodwin', 'movie', 'five', 'women', 'Elizabeth', 'struggle', 'be', 'perfect', '1950s', 'housewife', 'husband', 'lack', 'interest', 'being', 'husband', 'Joan', 'dilemma', 'attend', 'Yale', 'University', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Giselle', 'struggle', 'reputation', 'as', 'well', 'harboring', 'feelings', 'professor', 'Connie', 'struggle', 'well', 'love', 'Katherine', 'struggle', 'bring', 'young', 'women', 'feminist', 'point', 'view.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'apart', 'being', 'cliched', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'person', 'constantly', 'force', 'others', 'way', 'thinking', 'particularly', 'Joan', 'Joan', 'decision', 'movie', 'Katherine', 'who', 'not', 'second', 'consider', 'maybe', 'Joan', 'choice', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'happy', 'Add', 'Katherine', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'romance', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'same', 'object', 'Giselle', 'affections', 'have', 'boring', 'unlikeable', 'central', 'character.However', 'students', 'are', 'very', 'engaging', 'likeable', 'Elizabeth', 'startling', 'transformation', 'end', 'actuall', 'quite', 'believable', 'Giselle', 'well', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'emerging', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'alone', 'will', 'make', 'character', 'Giselle', 'own', 'right', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'lonely', 'Connie', 'most', 'endearing', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Joan', 'one', 'can', 'respect', 'played', 'very', 'respectable', 'Julia', 'Stulies', 'students', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'characters', 'Katherine.However', 'one', 'as-yet-unmentioned', 'character', 'Katherine', 'housemate', 'Nancy', 'Abbey', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Nancy', 'great', 'character', 'graceless', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'enshrouded', 'such', 'cloud', 'sadness', 'wonder', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'mad', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'movie', 'outshone', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'scene', 'appeared', 'together.This', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'innovative', 'clever', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'several', 'times', 'central', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'endearing', 'However', 'have', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'young', 'actresses', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Recommended', 'nothing', 'better', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'horror', 'where', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'went', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'thinking', 'long', 'movie']",Mona Lisa Smile
797585,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001ADAVK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","""Mona Lisa Smile"" looks like it is going to be another one of those totally predictable films that I have been watching for the past couple of weeks.  After all, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) has arrived from U.C.L.A. all excited about teaching art history at Wellesley College in the fall of 1953.  After all, Wellesley has the brightest women in the country (by its own admission).  But as soon as she puts up the first slide in class Katharine finds that her class is totally prepared for her.  After all, she is not only from California, which is certainly bad enough, she is unmarried, which is even worse.  When her students recognize every single slide in her first lecture Katharine is seriously rattled, but she has a saving grace in that even if she is an unmarried first time teacher from California, she happens to like modern art.Now, I was a bit worried about this film at that point because if students already know everything in the textbook then you just take the class to the next level.  This is essentially what Katharine does, but it takes her a while to figure it out.  Of course, modern art is not part of the proscribed curriculum, which means Katharine has just started to buck the system.  Will Katharine, who came to teach tomorrow's leaders and not their wives, be able to save the minds if not the souls of her students or will the system come down on her like the wrath of outraged alumni?  We have seen this before (""Dead Poet Society"" is the obvious point of reference), but not with Julie Roberts and not with a cast of already established young female talent (as opposed to the traditional unknown males).Four of Katharine's students matter in different ways.  Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is at Wellesley to become the perfect wife, just like her mother (who is a trustee), and anybody who does not fit her prim and proper model gets to be denounced in an editorial in the school paper.  Anything Katharine does that Betty does not like is de facto ""subversive.""  Joan Bradwyn (Julia Stiles) is the smartest girl in the class and would be interested in going to law school (at Yale no less) if not for the fact that she is planning on become a wife and mother.  Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is the promiscuous one, at least when it comes to older men.  Constance Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the one who can only dream of actually having a guy pay attention to her some day.The idea is that Katharine is a proto-feminist, which is only a radical idea because apparently Wellesley educates young women for no reason.  Supposedly Yale keeps one of its five spots for women open for a Wellesley graduate, but anybody who wants the place to be more than the most expensive finishing school in the country is obviously ""subversive,"" so who would ever take advantage of it?  When Katharine gets Joan to fill out the Yale application Betty is frothing at the mouth, sputtering with rage that her best friend would actually use her brain and abandon the goal of being the perfect wife.  Although it makes no sense to me, Betty gets married during her senior year, disappearing for five weeks to go on her honeymoon and set up her household before returning to class to go back to butting heads with Katharine and the other girls in the group, who are obviously been inspired by the radical teacher to think independently.What redeems ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is that there are a couple of key moments that do not go the way that you think.  At one point you are going to be thinking that a suicide is imminent, but instead there is a moment of affirmation and boldness that was a nice surprise.  Then there comes the moment when Betty is about to get her comeuppance.  It seems that Betty's husband might be married but does not care enough about his ""perfect"" wife to stay faithful to her.  But just as you are all ready to enjoy Betty having her wretched life thrown back in her face, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal go in a different direction.  Roberts has some nice moments when she makes her anger work for her, Dunst gets to be the heavy, and Goodwin shines as the young woman who discovers happiness might actually be within her grasp.Whether or not ""Mona Lisa Smile"" has a happy ending depends on whether you think battles or wars are what need to be won.  Katharine has some relationship issues with a couple of guys, but that is just a sideshow.  What matters here is what happens between the teacher and her students.  Director Mike Newell's film also works because it uses art history to great effect, not only as Katharine confronts her students with examples of modern art but as they find a fitting way of having their teacher remember them and understand that she did make a difference.  This is not a great film, but it is a good film at a time when there are very few of those around.",4,Julia Roberts brings the gospel of feminism to Wellesley,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,4846,"['Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'totally', 'predictable', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'arrived', 'U.C.L.A', 'excited', 'teaching', 'art', 'history', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'fall', '1953', 'Wellesley', 'brightest', 'women', 'country', 'own', 'admission', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'slide', 'class', 'Katharine', 'class', 'totally', 'prepared', 'not', 'only', 'California', 'certainly', 'bad', 'enough', 'unmarried', 'even', 'worse', 'When', 'students', 'recognize', 'single', 'slide', 'first', 'lecture', 'Katharine', 'seriously', 'rattled', 'saving', 'grace', 'even', 'unmarried', 'first', 'time', 'teacher', 'California', 'like', 'modern', 'art.Now', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'film', 'point', 'students', 'already', 'know', 'everything', 'textbook', 'then', 'just', 'take', 'class', 'next', 'level', 'essentially', 'what', 'Katharine', 'while', 'figure', 'out', 'course', 'modern', 'art', 'not', 'part', 'proscribed', 'curriculum', 'Katharine', 'just', 'started', 'buck', 'system', 'Will', 'Katharine', 'who', 'came', 'teach', 'tomorrow', 'leaders', 'not', 'wives', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'minds', 'not', 'souls', 'students', 'will', 'system', 'come', 'down', 'wrath', 'outraged', 'alumni', 'have', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'obvious', 'point', 'reference', 'not', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'not', 'cast', 'already', 'established', 'young', 'female', 'talent', 'opposed', 'traditional', 'unknown', 'males', '.Four', 'Katharine', 'students', 'matter', 'different', 'ways', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Wellesley', 'become', 'perfect', 'wife', 'just', 'mother', 'who', 'trustee', 'anybody', 'who', 'not', 'fit', 'prim', 'proper', 'model', 'be', 'denounced', 'editorial', 'school', 'paper', 'Anything', 'Katharine', 'Betty', 'not', 'like', 'de', 'facto', 'subversive', 'Joan', 'Bradwyn', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'smartest', 'girl', 'class', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'Yale', 'less', 'not', 'fact', 'planning', 'become', 'wife', 'mother', 'Giselle', 'Levy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'promiscuous', 'one', 'least', 'when', 'older', 'men', 'Constance', 'Baker', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'actually', 'having', 'guy', 'pay', 'attention', 'day.The', 'idea', 'Katharine', 'proto-feminist', 'only', 'radical', 'idea', 'apparently', 'Wellesley', 'young', 'women', 'reason', 'Supposedly', 'Yale', 'one', 'five', 'spots', 'women', 'open', 'Wellesley', 'graduate', 'anybody', 'who', 'place', 'be', 'more', 'most', 'expensive', 'finishing', 'school', 'country', 'obviously', 'subversive', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'take', 'advantage', 'When', 'Katharine', 'Joan', 'fill', 'out', 'Yale', 'application', 'Betty', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'sputtering', 'rage', 'best', 'friend', 'would', 'actually', 'use', 'brain', 'abandon', 'goal', 'being', 'perfect', 'wife', 'sense', 'Betty', 'married', 'senior', 'year', 'disappearing', 'five', 'weeks', 'go', 'honeymoon', 'set', 'up', 'household', 'returning', 'class', 'go', 'back', 'butting', 'heads', 'Katharine', 'other', 'girls', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'been', 'inspired', 'radical', 'teacher', 'think', 'independently.What', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'are', 'couple', 'key', 'moments', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'think', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'thinking', 'suicide', 'imminent', 'instead', 'moment', 'affirmation', 'boldness', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Then', 'moment', 'when', 'Betty', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'Betty', 'husband', 'might', 'be', 'married', 'not', 'care', 'enough', 'perfect', 'wife', 'stay', 'faithful', 'just', 'are', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'Betty', 'having', 'wretched', 'life', 'thrown', 'back', 'face', 'screenwriters', 'Lawrence', 'Konner', 'Mark', 'Rosenthal', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'Roberts', 'nice', 'moments', 'when', 'anger', 'work', 'Dunst', 'be', 'heavy', 'Goodwin', 'shines', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'happiness', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'grasp.Whether', 'not', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'happy', 'ending', 'depends', 'think', 'battles', 'wars', 'are', 'what', 'need', 'be', 'won', 'Katharine', 'relationship', 'issues', 'couple', 'guys', 'just', 'sideshow', 'What', 'here', 'what', 'teacher', 'students', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'film', 'also', 'art', 'history', 'great', 'effect', 'not', 'only', 'Katharine', 'students', 'examples', 'modern', 'art', 'find', 'fitting', 'way', 'having', 'teacher', 'remember', 'understand', 'did', 'make', 'difference', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'very', 'few']",Mona Lisa Smile
797586,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001ADAVK,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","My daughter, who had seen this film and loved it, suggested that we watch it together. I agreed and was very glad I did so, as I really enjoyed this bittersweet film. It is a well-acted, well-directed effort about a free-thinking art history professor, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who in the nineteen fifties, lacking Ivy League credentials, manages, through a twist of fate, to get a berth as a professor at traditional and conservative Wellesley College. It is here that she hopes to find herself instructing the leaders of tomorrow.What she finds, instead, is a group of highly intelligent, young women, who are more interested in marrying the leaders of tomorrow than in being leaders themselves. Ms. Watson succeeds in opening the minds of her students to the possibilities and choices life can offer and learns a little about such possibilities and choices herself. She also finds friendship and romance while at Wellesley College. The film also focuses on four of her students, all of whom are given stellar portrayals by the young actresses playing them.Elizabeth ""Betty"" Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is the quintessential fifties girl, obsessed with getting her Mrs. before getting her BA. She later discovers that one should be careful for what one wishes. She is also a nasty piece of work who doesn't care what misery for others her poison pen invectives and barbed comments cause. She eventually gets her comeuppance in a way that she never envisioned. Her best friend, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Styles), is a beautiful, highly intelligent, young woman who harbors a secret wish to become a lawyer. Yet, at the same time, she desperately wants to become a wife and mother. Hers is a decision between choices. She ultimately makes a choice that causes Ms. Watson some consternation but with which she is happy. Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young Jewish miss in a WASP environment who finds herself having short term affairs with her hunky professor and with an older, married man. Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a pleasingly plump, pretty cellist who finds true love, only to find it derailed by the ever evil Betty.Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant in the supporting role of Nancy Abbey, Wellesley College's professor of etiquette and deportment, who, one discovers, has not always followed her own staid advice. Noted British actress, Juliet Stevenson, is outstanding in the small role of Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and closet lesbian, who is still mourning the loss of her companion of many years. Marian Seldes is perfectly cast as President Jocelyn Carr, whose role at the college seems to be that of keeping the well-heeled alumni and trustees of Wellesley College happy with the status quo. Donna Mitchell turns in a stunning performance as Betty's self-absorbed mother, a woman who is a slave to the expected and puts appearances before her daughter's happiness. Julia Roberts is luminous as the role of Katherine Watson, infusing it with an intelligence and natural warmth that radiates off the screen. Though she has a little bit too contemporary an edge, she still manages to carry the day in the role of the forward thinking professor with the Mona Lisa smile.All in all, this is a wonderful, highly enjoyable film in which the social mores and style of the nineteen fifties are well depicted.",5,THOSE NINETEEN FIFTIES WOMEN...,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,3331,"['daughter', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'loved', 'suggested', 'watch', 'together', 'agreed', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'bittersweet', 'film', 'well-acted', 'well-directed', 'effort', 'free-thinking', 'art', 'history', 'professor', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'nineteen', 'fifties', 'lacking', 'Ivy', 'League', 'credentials', 'manages', 'twist', 'fate', 'get', 'berth', 'professor', 'traditional', 'conservative', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'here', 'find', 'instructing', 'leaders', 'instead', 'group', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'marrying', 'leaders', 'tomorrow', 'being', 'leaders', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'opening', 'minds', 'students', 'possibilities', 'choices', 'life', 'can', 'offer', 'learns', 'little', 'such', 'possibilities', 'choices', 'also', 'friendship', 'romance', 'while', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'film', 'also', 'four', 'students', 'whom', 'are', 'given', 'stellar', 'portrayals', 'young', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'quintessential', 'fifties', 'girl', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'Mrs.', 'getting', 'BA', 'later', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'one', 'wishes', 'also', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'misery', 'others', 'poison', 'pen', 'invectives', 'barbed', 'comments', 'cause', 'eventually', 'comeuppance', 'way', 'never', 'envisioned', 'best', 'friend', 'Joan', 'Brandwyn', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'beautiful', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'secret', 'wish', 'become', 'lawyer', 'same', 'time', 'desperately', 'become', 'wife', 'mother', 'Hers', 'decision', 'choices', 'ultimately', 'choice', 'Ms.', 'Watson', 'consternation', 'happy', 'Giselle', 'Levy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'young', 'Jewish', 'miss', 'WASP', 'environment', 'who', 'having', 'short', 'term', 'affairs', 'hunky', 'professor', 'older', 'married', 'man', 'Connie', 'Baker', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'pleasingly', 'plump', 'pretty', 'cellist', 'who', 'true', 'love', 'only', 'find', 'derailed', 'ever', 'evil', 'Betty.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'role', 'Nancy', 'Abbey', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'professor', 'etiquette', 'deportment', 'who', 'one', 'discovers', 'not', 'always', 'followed', 'own', 'staid', 'advice', 'Noted', 'British', 'actress', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'outstanding', 'small', 'role', 'Amanda', 'Armstrong', 'college', 'nurse', 'closet', 'lesbian', 'who', 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'companion', 'many', 'years', 'Marian', 'Seldes', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'President', 'Jocelyn', 'Carr', 'role', 'college', 'be', 'keeping', 'well-heeled', 'alumni', 'trustees', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'happy', 'status', 'quo', 'Donna', 'Mitchell', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Betty', 'self-absorbed', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'slave', 'expected', 'appearances', 'daughter', 'happiness', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'luminous', 'role', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'infusing', 'intelligence', 'natural', 'warmth', 'screen', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'contemporary', 'edge', 'still', 'carry', 'day', 'role', 'forward', 'thinking', 'professor', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'smile.All', 'wonderful', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'social', 'mores', 'style', 'nineteen', 'fifties', 'are', 'well', 'depicted']",Mona Lisa Smile

The Julia Roberts character is likable and does a good job of depicting the now universally acknowledged notion in the civilized world that to be a complete woman does not have to attach herself to a man to attain self-worth.  (The ending of Under the Tuscan Sun cops out on this point.) The Julia Stiles character does a good job of depicting the viewpoint that the woman who COULD &quot;have it all&quot; isn't automatically wrong if she chooses to marry.There were a few narrative threads that were lost, though.

Mona Lisa Smile--about a noncomformist teacher at a private school who encourages students to pursue their individuality--is pretty much an all-girls version of Dead Poets Society that mixes '50s fashions with '70s feminist thought. However, its lack of ambition doesn't diminish the talent that's gone into it: The writing and directing are well-honed and skillful; the actors--a talent-studded cast featuring Marcia Gay Harden, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Juliet Stevenson--are uniformly excellent. But without question, Mona Lisa Smile rides on Roberts's shoulders and she carries it with ease.

After all, it features some of some of today's best actresses - Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Marcia Gay Harden. It has the look of the 1950s, which makes it a handsome period piece. The movie's central problems are its unsuccessful attempts to convey the real feeling of the period and its failure to create any truly memorable characters [the script's fault more than the performers']. While it wants to be seen as a historically accurate portrait of upper-middle class society fifty years ago, it winds being no more than an entertaining soap opera. [For a more astute vision of the period, watch the vastly superior ""Far From Heaven"" [2002]. For a searing portrait of a teacher in an all girls' school, check out 1969's ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"".]Katherine Watson [Roberts], a recent UC Berkeley graduate, lands a job at Wellesley College, a prestigious East Coast women's college, as an art history teacher. She is impressed by her students' eagerness to learn, but appalled that, despite their academic excellence, their main ambition is to marry well. She begins a fairly benign campaign to get these women to realize that there might be other ambitions in life worth pursing. Her efforts make the college's president and its board of trustees uncomfortable to the point that her job is in danger. The students' responses range from acceptance to outright hostility.The always delightful Roberts is miscast here. She is a joy to watch and gives one of her most mature performances, yet she comes off as an early 21st Century woman sent to the mid-20th Century to show these girls what the future will be like. This interpretation gives her character a certain smugness.The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.

Julia Roberts portrays an art history professor from Wellesly who has a difficult time adjusting to the fact that most of her brilliant students have no professional ambitions of their own and simply want to get married and have babies when they graduate from college. Roberts is excellent in the film, but the younger actresses are also very good, most notably Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, and Ginnifer Goodwin.Some people will probably be turned off by the attitudes about women that are depicted in the film, but that's the way things were done 50 years ago, and the fact that we're so bothered by it when we watch the film shows that the director has done a fine job. What bothered me about the movie was the way that several of the characters interacted with each other. Dunst's character was NASTY, and in the course of a two-hour film, she exposes her best friend's deepest secret to a large crowd, lies to one of her friends and convinces her that her boyfriend is cheating on her (he's not), calls another friend of hers a tramp (once again, in front of a crowd), and writes several controversial editorials in the school paper that everyone disagrees with. After all of that, no one really lashes out at her at all. It's true that Dunst's character is coping with her own problems, but I don't think that any girls would let their friend get away with all the crap that Dunst pulls in the movie. I was hoping that someone would haul off and slap her at the end, but no one did, and that was disappointing.There were also some things that bothered me about Julia's character, especially the fact that such a strong and independent woman would have an affair with a professor who was openly sleeping with his students. That was a major thing that I didn't understand at all.All that aside, though, it was still an entertaining movie. My boyfriend called it a &quot;chick flick,&quot; and I agree that the film probably appeals to women more than it does to men.

Those words came to mind after reading a few very revealing reviews on this site.  `Mona Lisa Smile' has been reviewed as, ""male bashing"", ""anti marriage"", and the most overused of all lazy monikers, ""A chick flick"".I did not find it to be any of those things, but rather an insightful look into what it meant to be a woman at the most prestigious women's college in 1953.  I found it to be a film about choices that were available then to women and in comparison what the choices are there for them today.  I did not find it to be male bashing but rather affirming of the complexities of accepted relationships between of men and women and the possibilities of new behaviors.I didn't not find it anti marriage, for in the Julia Stiles character were are shown most clearly that even though she has the opportunity to go to Yale to study law she chooses what is in fact her dream, to be a housewife. By contrast we are shown in the character portrayed by Kirsten Dunst that marriage is not always the best thing for some people and for her like her professor Katherine, there are other opportunities available, not many in 1953 but some and more were about to emerge as time moved on toward the 1960's. It was realist in its views that not all marriages workout and that those that do take honesty and hard work.Lastly it is not a chick flick, that demeaning term used by the immature filmgoer to describe any film that deals with women with brains, about issues of emotion over action and about alternatives over automatonisum.Julia Roberts is wonderful as the bohemian teacher from California who comes to be taught as much by her students as she teaches them. She has grown into a woman of substance and power on the screen.  Also a special note of mention must go to Marcia Gay Harden who creates a chillingly sad picture of a lost woman damaged by the effects of World War II. Beyond these fine performances the film belongs to the younger women in the piece.

I have to give the writers credit: By the end of this film, its large and well-drawn supporting cast and even follow-through to the very end of the story had me convinced that it must be based on a book. It's not based on a book. The novel of the same name, written by Deborah Chiel, was based on the film. This is just an extremely well-constructed screenplay that is unusually thorough in developing its supporting characters.This excellent supporting cast truly is ""Mona Lisa Smile""'s greatest asset and the most compelling reason to see the film. This is a large cast that is universally terrific, so I'll just mention the best of the best: Marcia Gay Harden -one of our finest character actors- hits the nail on the head once again as Nancy, Wellesley's professor of poise. Kirsten Dunst does some of her best work as Betty, a student whose arrogant, vicious nature can't save her from the realities of her own imperfect marriage, although, ironically, imperfection might save Betty from her own nature. Juliet Stevenson makes an impression in a small role as the college's forward-thinking nurse, Amanda Armstrong. Maggie Gyllenhaal is Giselle, a radical student by Wellesley standards, noted for her many affairs with older men. Ginnifer Goodwin is a good-natured, bright, but chubby student named Connie, who thinks less of herself than others do. I won't go on -even though I don't want to short change any member of this cast- but a couple more recognizable names are Topher Grace, who plays the suitor of a ""Wellesley girl"", and you can catch a glimpse of singer Tori Amos performing at Betty's wedding. I have yet to mention Julia Roberts. All I can say is that she is Julia Roberts, Movie Star, and this is a very suitable role for her.Lest you assume from the plot description that ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is a post-War feminist rant, I should say that this is not the case. Katherine believes that her students' minds will be wasted as ideal homemakers and corporate wives. Her students don't always agree. The film is about a group of diverse young women and one older one who, through their experiences of college's last semester, learn how they want to live. They all discover that they have more choices than they once believed. And then they make those choices according to their own priorities. Consider Your Options is about as preachy as the film gets.The DVD: Bonus features include a music video for ""Heart of Every Girl"" by Elton John, filmographies for the director, writers, and cast, and 3 featurettes: The film's cast comments on the role of art in their lives in ""Art Forum"". ""College Then and Now"" is part making-of documentary and part discussion of the decisions faced by women graduating from college in 1953 versus present day. ""What Women Wanted: 1953"" is a documentary about some of the social realities of the post-War era, including interviews with the film's creators and cast. If you only want to watch one extra, try ""College Then and Now"". ""Art Forum "" isn't worth your time. There are 2 unavoidable previews on the disc.

Everyone else on the cover is female. Those are pretty good clues.  Well, being the fair, forward-thinking male that I am, I didn't let this prevent me from watching ""Mona Lisa Smile"" when my mother and little sister brought it home from the video rental store. After all, I would actually consider myself a fan of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Where the Heart Is."" Of course, knowing that Kirsten Dunst was in this film didn't hurt my curiosity level either. So, I sat back and did my best not to leave till the film was over. Honestly, it wasn't easy with this one.""Mona Lisa Smile"" is the story of  Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), an early-bird bra-burner and art-history teacher in the 1950s who has moved from California to the East Coast to teach at a private, highly conservative girls' college. Right away, she has personality conflicts with the students and faculty, particularly a know-it-all schoolgirl called ""Betty""(Kirsten Dunst) who seems angry at everyone else in the world for not living up to her high standards. Betty's weapon of choice is the school newspaper, which she uses with deadly precision. But of course, the unsinkable Ms. Watson has the upper-hand thanks to her strong will, liberated point of view, and ability to charm those around her to her way of thinking. Before long, all the sassy students who once mimicked Betty are singing Ms. Watson's tune. They now have bigger things in mind for their futures than simply getting married and raising families. What a waste of time that would be! But every victory Ms. Watson has is repelled by another conflict, as the school's lessons of better living through housekeeping are insisted upon by those in charge, and fully supported by disgruntled student Betty. How things will end is anybody's guess...though this is a movie formula we've seen many times before.It's a pretty common movie plot. A new, slightly more evolved teacher comes into a classroom and has to fight for acceptance and change. This time it's the 1950s, and the conflicts stem from the era's view of a woman's role in society. Okay, all of that is pretty tolerable. Still could be a good, even great film. The problem lies in its one-sidedness (I won't even go into its mostly negative presentation of the male gender). In all its preaching of tolerance, liberal Hollywood cannot tolerate the idea that being an individual might involve making one's own decisions. Here the lesson is: ""Be an individual by doing what the new, liberal teacher thinks is right."" Not the lesson they more than hint at, which is to think for yourself. It is just beyond these moviemakers to believe that some folks might not want careers. Some might actually want to get married before they're old and focus their lives on raising their children, and it doesn't always mean they're ignorant or have been brainwashed. Of course, everyone should make that choice on their own, and be free to, but it's not progress to look down upon those who choose to be full-time moms. Looking around at the current state of the world, I can't help but think we could use more of them. But don't get me wrong, I'm not leaning to one side or the other as a rule for all women. I just felt that the movie was. As for me, I've always had a thing for professional women. The entertainment profession anyway. Speaking of, while I've always thought Julia Roberts resembled the Jersey Devil a tiny bit, Kirsten Dunst looked absolutely gorgeous in this movie, even as the misled baddie. It was hard not to love her, even though they did a good job of making her out to be brainwashed, and subconsciously frustrated by it. Her performance here was one of her best. No complaints about any of the cast really. Great performances. I'll admit that Ms. Robert's acting always looks effortless.  Julia Stiles also has a significant role as a student who is torn between marriage and college, and plays it well, as does Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of the promiscuous student. As it sounds though, all the characters are pretty basic, cookie cutter creations. There's the promiscuous girl, the mean and arrogant girl, the smart but unconfident girl, (*deep breath* ) the slightly chubby girl who is still cute but everyone tells her she's not because females are even more superficial than males when you come down to it. *phew* And that's the whole movie when you come down to it. It's been spoken of and makes itself out to be a movie that should have taken the Oscar, but it's all pretty cookie cutter, with a slightly TOO ""I'm right and you're wrong"" attitude. Alright for an evening when you have nothing else to do if you dig chick movies, but not a keeper unless you're really into one or more members of the cast.",3,Warning: Chick Flick

797605,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B0001ADAVK,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 8]","Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast.  The story is obviously taken from The Dead Poet's Society, but this time given a feminist edge.  That feminist edge is Julia Roberts, a thoroughly modern miss who takes a class of art students at a conservative college, only to realise that it's really just a finishing school.  There's an appropriate array of stereotypes: the nasty one (Dunst), the wild one (Gyllenhaal) and the nice one (Stiles).The greatest travesty of Mona Lisa Smile is that it wastes the talents of such brilliant actresses.  It doesn't even seem to appreciate them.  Roberts, showing such spark in Erin Brockavich, does good work here but she's just too modern to fit into a 50's set piece.  The worst hit by it all is Kirsten Dunst, whose character seems to be repeatedly punished for refuting Roberts' feminist agenda and has some truly abysmal dialogue, especially when confronting her mother with a picture of the Mona Lisa.  Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal come out of the whole mess relatively unscathed though.  Stiles has always seemed to be a good actress in need of a good film, and here is no exception.  Her poise, voice and mannerisms are impressively realistic, and her talk with Roberts that maybe her feminism isn't always the right course of action is the best scene in the movie.  Gyllenhaal is just wonderful.  She imbues her character with an almost manic depressive quality that's not in the script.  It's all her, and I can only hope that after her startling turn in Secretary that she moves on to bigger and better things.Of course, the real problem with Mona Lisa Smile is that it's too self-consciously 'worthy' and seems to be begging for an Oscar in almost every scene.  Although there are a couple of scenes where the film comes alive, it's too few and far between, and once you've left the theatre and look back on it you realise what a shallow exercise it was.",1,A waste of genuine talent,1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,2038,"['Watching', 'trailers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'quite', 'prepared', 'have', 'mind', 'changed', 'particularly', 'had', 'such', 'good', 'cast', 'story', 'obviously', 'taken', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'time', 'given', 'feminist', 'edge', 'feminist', 'edge', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'miss', 'who', 'class', 'art', 'students', 'conservative', 'college', 'only', 'realise', 'really', 'just', 'finishing', 'school', 'appropriate', 'array', 'stereotypes', 'nasty', 'one', 'Dunst', 'wild', 'one', 'Gyllenhaal', 'nice', 'one', 'Stiles', '.The', 'greatest', 'travesty', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'talents', 'such', 'brilliant', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'appreciate', 'Roberts', 'showing', 'such', 'spark', 'Erin', 'Brockavich', 'good', 'work', 'here', 'just', 'too', 'modern', 'fit', '50', 'set', 'piece', 'worst', 'hit', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'character', 'be', 'repeatedly', 'punished', 'refuting', 'Roberts', 'feminist', 'agenda', 'truly', 'abysmal', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'when', 'confronting', 'mother', 'picture', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'come', 'whole', 'mess', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'Stiles', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'need', 'good', 'film', 'here', 'exception', 'poise', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'impressively', 'realistic', 'talk', 'Roberts', 'maybe', 'feminism', ""n't"", 'always', 'right', 'course', 'action', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'just', 'wonderful', 'character', 'almost', 'manic', 'depressive', 'quality', 'not', 'script', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'startling', 'turn', 'Secretary', 'bigger', 'better', 'things.Of', 'course', 'real', 'problem', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'too', 'self-consciously', ""'worthy"", 'be', 'begging', 'Oscar', 'almost', 'scene', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'film', 'alive', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'once', ""'ve"", 'left', 'theatre', 'look', 'back', 'realise', 'what', 'shallow', 'exercise', 'was']",Mona Lisa Smile

It's feministic approach was refreshing to see, and delivered in the form of Julia Roberts character, who incidentally was not a man-hating feminist, showed that the movement was not a way of women attempting to rise up against the oppressive and hateful men that ruled their lives, but a motion towards some kind of respect and equality. Roberts' character dated, loved, and worked hard for all she wanted. She motivated the girls to make a life for themselves that existed beyond the boundries of masculine expectation, so they would not regret letting the oppertunities pass them by.Kirstin Dunst impressed me immensley in this film. I remember her saying in an interview a while ago, she'd like her acting to be taken more seriously and that she's sick of being the love interest or the girl next door... well, to me, all you need to do is look at her in Mona Lisa Smile and you can clearly see that this girl is headed for something major. She was spectacular, and the part suited her to a T. I wouldn't really have picked her out before watching this film, but if I see her in a serious role again, it will compell me to watch it.Similarly, Maggie stood out as more than Jake's sister. She was, perhaps, the second most outstanding actress in the movie, besides Kirstin.This film opened my eyes. In a way, it also showed me that you can't change people who've held beliefs in their minds for their entire lives to a, perhaps, more positive opinion, unless you're prepared to really fight. Or maybe the film shows that people should give advice, but allow others to make their own unaided decissions?

797607,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B0001ADAVK,Ms Winston,"[0, 0]","I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did, although I think there were several inspired performances which raised the movie from ho-hum to somewhat better than average. The biggest problem with the movie was that it has been done before, and much better: ""The Dead Poet's Society"" and ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" are two movies that instantly leap to my mind. In my opinion, the movie emphasized the wrong characters: the young women played by Kristen Dunst and Julia Stiles were far less interesting than the Maggie Gyllenhaal and Juliet Stevenson characters (the Stevenson character left the movie far too early). The marriage vs career script was for the most part uninspiring and ho-hum. The characters, except for Gyllenhaal and Dunst, were pretty much divided up between all good and all bad; Dunst's mother was a stock villain who seemed straight out of that classic of the early 1960s, ""A Summer Place.""The outstanding performances of the movie were turned in by Julia Roberts and Marcia Gay Harden, playing women totally opposite from each other who became friends of sorts. Ms Harden did an excellent job of portraying a woman so scared of living that she would rather stay home to watch a game show on televison than go out for a night on the town with the friend who would soon be leaving forever. That scene neatly forshadowed the rest of the characer's life, hunkering down to protect herself from the world. Roberts performance was vastly underrated: it will be a long time before I forget how skillfully she portrayed the humiliation her character felt when tormented on her first day in the classroom by her students.More bonus material on the DVD would have been welcome, but this seems to be getting to be fairly standard for regularly priced DVDs.",3,Flawed but Still Entertaining,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,1785,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'think', 'were', 'several', 'inspired', 'performances', 'raised', 'movie', 'ho-hum', 'somewhat', 'better', 'average', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'are', 'two', 'movies', 'instantly', 'mind', 'opinion', 'movie', 'emphasized', 'wrong', 'characters', 'young', 'women', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'were', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'characters', 'Stevenson', 'character', 'left', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'marriage', 'vs', 'career', 'script', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'uninspiring', 'ho-hum', 'characters', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Dunst', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'divided', 'up', 'good', 'bad', 'Dunst', 'mother', 'was', 'stock', 'villain', 'who', 'seemed', 'straight', 'classic', 'early', '1960s', 'Summer', 'Place', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'movie', 'were', 'turned', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'playing', 'women', 'totally', 'opposite', 'other', 'who', 'became', 'friends', 'sorts', 'Ms', 'Harden', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'woman', 'so', 'scared', 'living', 'would', 'rather', 'stay', 'home', 'watch', 'game', 'show', 'televison', 'go', 'out', 'night', 'town', 'friend', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'leaving', 'forever', 'scene', 'neatly', 'forshadowed', 'rest', 'characer', 'life', 'hunkering', 'down', 'protect', 'world', 'Roberts', 'performance', 'was', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'forget', 'how', 'skillfully', 'portrayed', 'humiliation', 'character', 'felt', 'when', 'tormented', 'first', 'day', 'classroom', 'students.More', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'be', 'getting', 'be', 'fairly', 'standard', 'regularly', 'priced', 'DVDs']",Mona Lisa Smile

What she finds is a great invisible wall that divides her from her students by breeding and class not to mention ideals.  Katherine Watson is energized by individuality and free thinking.  Her students are driven by social status and the goal of marriage.The Wellesley students are all young women of high society.  Their main focus in life is to find the perfect husband, live in the perfect house and have an ""x"" number of children.  They are instructed on how to help their future husbands advance in their careers versus having one of their own.  They are schooled in taking a back seat to everyone and everything.The theme of feminism is not missed here.  Watson poignantly points out to her students that women have made various educational advancements only not to advance on a personal level.  More education has merely placed more pressure on women to become what society deems the perfect wife and mother in her fancy dress, high heels and pearls will vacuuming the house and having dinner at 5.

Nothing so banal as history or Latin...) in the form of toothy Julia Roberts breezes in to shake up their world and leave moist eyed feminists dabbing with hankies by the campy closing credits.Is this the female take on Dead Poet's Society with a little of The Children's Hour, thrown in?

Her square-peg-in-a-round-hole approach to teaching art history encourages her students to look at life, and themselves, differently.For the most part, I thought this was a pretty good movie, featuring an impressive cast of young female stars. Gennifer Goodwin as Connie was particularly convincing and lovable, and Maggie Gyllenhall was pitch-perfect as the rebel (and token Jew) in the group of tight-knit friends the movie follows. (Both are star material; mark my words.) All of the actresses look GREAT in this movie; the makeup and hair were particularly convincing. Some of the shots of the college campus are also gorgeous as well.There was one thing that really bothered me about the movie, though. Betty (Kirsten Dunst) spends the whole movie hating Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts). Then, all of a sudden, at the end, she decides she absolutely LOVES her.

However, after watching it, the movie is not even close to be compared to their male counterparts. I am not saying school movies about females are worse than ones about males. What I am trying to say here is that if the movies are about female students, there are issues to talk about. Technically speaking, the direction and script will be more challenging in order to strike a balance. If this job is handled well, another great movie will be produced; if not, the movie will just become a flop, like Mona Lisa Smile.This movie is too aggressive and the plots centres on too many characters, which confuses the audience on thinking about or even locating the pivot of the movie - the teacher, Katherine Waston (Julia Robets) or her students? The movie was set in the early 1950s, when the Second World War had finished for almost ten years and women were trying to find new roles in a society. The students in a traditional school were molded to be conservatives and traditionalists. Katherine Watson, as a bohemian, appeared and showed them new angles of looking at art and their lives. Her students did the pre-reading of the class and knew very well about the syllabus. Katherine, amazed and stunned by this, introduced contemporary art into the class. With this, she emphasized the destined roles of women should not be marriage anymore. Despite her effort, many of her students still sought refuge in marriage and romance, even herself. Half of the movie talked about her enlightenment on gender stereotypes, but everything seems to be futile and unfruitful when we see one student getting married after another. The movie fails to show the impact of Katherine Waston as a teacher on the students' lives. Even if the impact is a failure (as in The Emperor's Club), it still has to show her ideas fail. In other words, Katherine Waston and her students appear on screen as two separate entities. The movie is a jungle path through which it is trying to find its focus, and so is the audience.The movie wastes the excellent cast - to a certain extent, I think Marcia Gay Harden is a miscast. She is the kind of emotionally rich and overflowing actress who took up Pollock and Mystic River. Her constraits in emotional expressions and manners fail to convince the audience. If the movie is made by a female director, things may be different. Another condition - if I was not a school teacher, I would not have given a pass for the movie.",3,A smile in a jungle path,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2574,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'was', 'expectiong', 'female', 'version', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Soceity', 'not', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'be', 'compared', 'male', 'counterparts', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'school', 'movies', 'females', 'are', 'worse', 'ones', 'males', 'What', 'am', 'trying', 'say', 'here', 'movies', 'are', 'female', 'students', 'are', 'issues', 'talk', 'Technically', 'speaking', 'direction', 'script', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'order', 'strike', 'balance', 'job', 'handled', 'well', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'produced', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'become', 'flop', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile.This', 'movie', 'too', 'aggressive', 'plots', 'centres', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'audience', 'thinking', 'even', 'locating', 'pivot', 'movie', 'teacher', 'Katherine', 'Waston', 'Julia', 'Robets', 'students', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'early', '1950s', 'when', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'had', 'finished', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'women', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'roles', 'society', 'students', 'traditional', 'school', 'were', 'molded', 'be', 'conservatives', 'traditionalists', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'bohemian', 'appeared', 'showed', 'new', 'angles', 'looking', 'art', 'lives', 'students', 'did', 'pre-reading', 'class', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'syllabus', 'Katherine', 'amazed', 'stunned', 'introduced', 'contemporary', 'art', 'class', 'emphasized', 'destined', 'roles', 'women', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'marriage', 'anymore', 'effort', 'many', 'students', 'still', 'sought', 'refuge', 'marriage', 'romance', 'even', 'Half', 'movie', 'talked', 'enlightenment', 'gender', 'stereotypes', 'everything', 'be', 'futile', 'unfruitful', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'student', 'getting', 'married', 'movie', 'show', 'impact', 'Katherine', 'Waston', 'teacher', 'students', 'lives', 'Even', 'impact', 'failure', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'still', 'show', 'ideas', 'fail', 'other', 'words', 'Katherine', 'Waston', 'students', 'appear', 'screen', 'two', 'separate', 'entities', 'movie', 'jungle', 'path', 'trying', 'find', 'focus', 'so', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'excellent', 'cast', 'certain', 'extent', 'think', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'miscast', 'kind', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'overflowing', 'actress', 'who', 'took', 'up', 'Pollock', 'Mystic', 'River', 'constraits', 'emotional', 'expressions', 'manners', 'fail', 'convince', 'audience', 'movie', 'made', 'female', 'director', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'condition', 'was', 'not', 'school', 'teacher', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'pass', 'movie']",Mona Lisa Smile

I can see how my mother, who came from a family of career women (although typical ""female"" professions such as School Teacher and Nurse), was frustrated at being shoved into the box of housewife and mother. She was never happy in that role, and after seeing this movie, I can see what tremendous pressure women were under back in the 1950's to conform. When she got married, my mother gave up a job she enjoyed because my father and society expected her to do so.My mother did not get a college education because my grandfather did not think it was worth educating girls; her brother got the college education. Seeing these bright college girls in the movie was sad, because you knew almost all of them would never use what they learned.I went to college in the 1970's and was still getting ribbed by older men as getting my ""MRS"" Degree, snicker, snicker. I never found that joke funny and I still don't. This movie gives the origin of that attitude that still is prevalent today.

They dropped Julia's romance though in a way that just seemed a little too male bashing.

797618,A2CL0JE11EPADZ,B0001ADAVK,"Reine des Coeurs ""reine_des_coeurs""","[0, 3]","Let's face facts - the fifties were a horribly stifling time for women and had this movie not portrayed them as so, it would have been a distortion of truth.  Elite New England universities were notoriously conservative and the importance of 'clean' appearances was strictly enforced. A character such as Katharine, the rebellious art history professor would have made herself a mark for challenging the values of said establishment, no matter how beloved she was by her fellow students.The reason I gave this film only two stars was that it constantly second guessed itself.  Towards the beginning of the film, Katharine refuses faculty housing because she refuses to live in a place where she cannot have male visitors.  Later on, when she's rented a room somewhere else, the same restriction applies.  She pushes Joan (by incorrectly assuming she would want to have both career and family) into applying for Yale and when Joan choses to get married, gets properly called out for wanting others to do as she says, not as they would.Also, when was the influence of Katharine over Betty taking place? As far as I could tell, they couldn't stand each other.  Personally I think Betty was being correctly advised by Giselle, the one character who did seemed human and fallible.  Even though she was intelligent and well-spoken, the fact Giselle was free thinking and sexually active almost set her up for the inevitable ""slut self destructs"" storyline. I'm glad they nicked that in the bud, as the scene in the dorm room after Giselle catches Betty's no-good husband Spenser in New York showed.  Giselle passed up the opportunity to shatter Betty publicly to instead be a good friend to her.  Had this movie possessed more moments like this, it would have been well-balanced and more enjoyable.One good thing that comes from the fifties/early sixties period movies that have been made in the past few years (Pleasantville, Far From Heaven and Down with Love) is that it finally establishes that those days are past us.

Though I am male, I relate to the perils that women faced thoughout most of history; the 50's were particulaly brutal for women, since anyone in position was scrutinized by McCarthyism. Wellesly College was no different. It's politics did not promote women, rather taught them how to be subservient. Some of my reviewing predecessors failed to realize how different things were then. There is absolutely NO comparison to ""Dead Poets' Society"", which was about ideas. ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is about integrity. Unfortunately, in both films, the protaganist left with his/her tail between the legs; Williams from defeat, Roberts from frustration. I'm a Julia Roberts fan, and think she's smart and interesting in almost any film she's made. She is bested here by Marcia Gay Harden, as well as the four young ladies who create her new world of involvement. The most famous 3 (Gyllenhaal, Stiles, Dunst) are fine, but Ginnifer Goodwin is a talent to be reckoned with. Harden, in particular, is so out of touch, and so sweet. Best performance in the film. I also liked Juliet Stevenson as the Lesbian (horrors!). A credit to her performance; she played the mother in ""Bend It Like Beckham"", who was appalled at the thought of gayness.The DVD is fine, with lots of extras. It must've been really awful to be a rich college girl in the 50's. A smart Lesbian couldn't work, and smart women were happy, relegated to idiot roles.

Im not really into a feministic side but when I watched my film, I tried to be in neutral position to understand the perspective of this film. Yes, the girls were charming but im not really looking or admiring their looks but how they cope up the issues that women themselves facing because each of them, as the movie goes on and what it tells, each students were facing decisions either professionally or in romance. I really like each girls' attitude especially of Kirsten Dunst, who appeared to be domineering, Julia Styles who's sweet but very professional although weakness came over to her to choose marriage or to be a law student, Maggie Gyllenhall (is my spelling right?) who's liberated, open-minded but her love affairs were not that serious.

Women can truly unlock their powers if they are willing enough to be what they are and conquering againsts all odds and streotyping and comparisons between man and woman.

The year is 1953, and her students, despite their many talents and above average intelligence, are more concerned about getting married and having a family and getting dinner on the table by 5 pm than anything else. Roberts thinks they should put their careers first. This attitude is explained by saying that Roberts is ""from California,"" as if in 1953 women in California were feminists. California didn't become the hot seat of a new way of thinking until the hippie revolution in the late 60s.  Nor did women who went to prestigious universities in the 1950s have such little regard for a career. The head of the university is portrayed as some backward thinking foil for Roberts' progressive views, when in reality the heads of prestigious womens' universities were very progressive for their times.  So it's all kind of silly and the plot hardly  holds together. The significance of the title, ""Mona Lisa Smile,"" is never explained. Still, if you like Roberts, and I do, you'll probably enjoy the film anyway.

797626,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B0001ADAVK,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[6, 6]","This movie has been called ""Dead Poets Society for girls"", and while there are strong similarities between these two movies, Mona Lisa Smile stands on its own. Julia Roberts plays Katherine Howard, a ""California bohemian"" who comes to Wellesley College to teach History of Art to a group of (mostly) spoiled rich girls who are there just biding their time until they get married. She intends to change this by making them see they can do whatever they want to do with their lives, not just someone's wives.Of course, trying to change tradition and the College's establishment doesn't come cheaply, as she is seen by her students as someone not worthy (why isn't she married?) and as someone dangerous by the school's governing body. She doesn't follow tradition, doesn't obey the rules and has what they call unorthodox ways of teaching, like taking the girls to see modern art and not following the curse's syllabus.As time passes and the girls get to know her, things start to change, and by the end of the movie everyone has learned a valuable lesson in life.One of the main differences between this movie and Dead Poets Society is that it mainly follows Katherine's life, leaving the students' lives as secondary stories, while in DPS it's the other way around. We do however share some moments with some of the other characters, namely Betty Warren (Dunst), the bratty, spoiled girl who despises Katherine and her ways, Joan Brandwyn (Stiles), who is somewhat torn between life as a housewife and going to Law school, Connie Baker (Goodwin), whose not as beautiful as the other girls and only dreams of finding love, and Giselle Levy (Gyllenhall), the wild, sexy girl. Most of the movie, however, centers on Katherine's struggles both on and off campus, as she starts a romantic relationship with the school's Italian teacher (West).Set in the 50's, this movie deal mainly with the subject of liberation and equality, its message being that women can be all they want to be, not only wives.The acting in the film is solid, starting with Roberts, but the real standouts are the girls. Dunst does mean and bitchy very well, and Stiles gives another good performance, but the two shining characters are Goodwin and Gyllenhall.

797627,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001ADAVK,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2 In the wheezingly old-fashioned ""Mona Lisa Smile,"" Julia Roberts joins the ranks of Robert Donat, Glenn Ford, Sidney Poitier, Sandy Dennis, Robin Williams, Edward James Olmos, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline, all of whom have played inexperienced teachers who manage to win over and inspire their initially recalcitrant students.  It matters not whether these pupils are hardened inner city gang types or snooty prep school geniuses, the arc of the story is always the same.  The teacher, armed with a sense of optimism and a zeal to ""make a difference"" in the students' lives, arrives at the institution nervous and unsure of whether she is really up to the challenge (or ""he"" in the case of many of these films).  After a predictably disastrous start, in which the students belittle her idealism and efforts and attempt to take advantage of her inexperience, the teacher invariably throws out the standard, stuffy, boring curriculum and finds a way to make learning relevant, fun and engaging.  This, of course, makes her the most popular teacher at the school, but also a threat to the ossified educational establishment, which throws up endless roadblocks in an effort to keep this know-it-all upstart from upsetting the applecart.  Undeterred, the teacher manages to get down to the students' level, rapping with them as if she were one of their own, helping to solve their problems and inspiring them to take their rightful place in society as freethinking, morally upstanding individuals.  Then comes the inevitable moment when the teacher must decide, midway through the term, whether or not she will be returning for the next semester, with the student who gave the teacher the most trouble at the start pleading with her to stay on and work her magic for generations of students to come. All of this invariably culminates in a tear-soaked finale wherein all the students gather in worshipful adoration of this almost godlike embodiment of Learning.  A number of the movies that have utilized this storyline have been quite good, actually, but ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is not one of them.  By bringing nothing particularly new to the formula, the film can't help feeling derivative and clich&eacute;d. Where is Miss Jean Brodie when we really need her?""Mona Lisa Smile"" begins in 1953 with Katherine Anne Watson's arrival as an art history instructor at Wellesley College.  The school, as it turns out, is a haven for elite snobs - and its educational philosophy of rote, tradition-bound learning shows that the school is more concerned with turning the girls into dutiful, supportive wives and mothers than freethinking career women (the only classes we ever see the girls attending are art history, Italian, table setting and synchronized swimming, not exactly a rigorous course of study for a bunch of young ladies we are led to believe graduate with some pretty impressive degrees).  Enter Katherine Anne, fresh from a state school in ""liberal"" California, who clearly does not buy into the false value system she finds here.  After some initial resistance on the part of the girls and the powers-that-be at the institution, Katherine begins, slowly but surely, to win people over to her modernistic, iconoclastic way of thinking.As a social document, ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is yet another film dedicated to exposing the ""Stepford Wife"" mentality of the conformist 1950's.  The problem is that ""Far From Heaven"" did a much better job of that two years ago.  In that film, the main character experienced a gradual awakening as to both her value as an individual and the societal prison in which she lived.  During the course of the film, we grew along with her.  Katherine, on the other hand, feels like a 21st Century woman transported magically to the 1950's.  Not that there weren't such forward-looking women at the time, of course, but it's not very illuminating watching a person, spouting ideas no one in the audience could possibly disagree with, bringing knowledge and enlightenment to the ignorant masses. The acting is good but the characters are all either shallow stereotypes or straw men designed for Katherine to knock down easily.  Ironically, the film is every bit as conventional as the conformity it's railing against.Now that Ms. Roberts has gotten the Messianic Teacher Syndrome out of her system, perhaps she can move on to bigger and better things.

797628,A2QU05H6Y0DPNC,B0001ADAVK,Romantic Glutton,"[0, 0]","In some ways, it was hard not to like Mona Lisa Smile. The cast of female actors was truly amazing. Really just watching their facial expressions and gestures was nearly entertaining enough that I almost didn't need a plot. The 50's outfits and hair styles were eye candy and the setting was gorgeous. Just watching the girls interact and sit and talk together was fun to see. The campus setting is, of course, beautiful and nostalgic.Ginnifer Goodwin was a major show-stealer portraying the girl at her college who cannot find a boy to date. (Though I think she is breathtaking to look at... hard to believe SHE can't find a boy!) Her potential in this film is extraordinary and she outshines more experienced actors like Kirsten Dunst with ease. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Julia Stiles were their normal awesome selves... and I enjoyed seeing Krysten Ritter in a small sleeper role/ cameo as ""art student"" (even silent and in the background she is drop-dead gorgeous). Of course the list of amazing young women (and some of the professor roles) goes on and on.I just wish this film had a plot that made sense or was inspiring. Julia Roberts as the inspiring professor, Ms. Watson, was wooden and bizarre. She played an unusually unlikeable character. I had a feeling she wasn't exactly sure what to do with this role or how to make this part work. In some parts she is perfect as the inspiring professor as we see her sitting with the students in a casual position by their desks and talking, sharing special moments with them and opening up during girl time, tears in her eyes as she shows advertisements of women selling out to the ideal of the housewife and pleading with them to ask for more than what is offered.I wanted this movie to stick to this ideal and to really develop it. But there are such confusing plot points. First Ms. Watson has an obviously distant relationship with a man she's not intimately close to. When this relationship is first shown via a phone call, it seems like it is obvious this man is not committed to her and he is probably her ""back up"" boyfriend. Later he shows up, suddenly the romantic suitor who puts a ring on her finger without her answering his proposal. I wasn't sure what to make of this relationship. At one point Watson calls her boyfriend ""Bill"" who is the male professor she later sleeps with... BUT there's been no real development of a relationship with the Bill guy yet. (Bad splicing of film? Sequence of events didn't quite make sense.)The film sets up Watson as a liberal who is a feminist and teaches her girls to be so too... but it seems like she's just a woman who is afraid of commitment, intimacy and marriage. I couldn't actually tell if she WAS a feminist or a liberal or if she was just terrified of relationships. She's encouraging her students to not marry and makes fun of them when they do. Instead of seeming like she wants them to succeed as independent women, it comes across like she's jealous, angry, frightened and downright disturbed by marriage.Watson breaks off her very short engagement to the sensible, loving fiance and then immediately turns to Professor Bill, the Italian professor who has been sleeping with one of her students until the week before. I found this to be a turn-off on so many levels. It further proved the point that this film has nothing to do with educational values or independent females, but everything to do with a disturbed professor who fears men and marriage and so leaves a sensible one to be with a reckless one who not only seduces his students and breaks their hearts, but is a liar and a fake as well. All this with a man she barely knows but she falls all over him at a student's wedding and makes it obvious to the world and the staff that she is sleeping with him. Very unprofessional and strange. Feminist? Independent? This woman seems weak, insecure and desperate. She pulls the irresponsible man toward her and pushes the sensible opinions away. Meanwhile setting an example for her students that is confusing and contradicting. (So it's ""strong"" to be easy in bed? What?)In a cliche turn of events, one of the students who is ""typically 50's"" eventually ""becomes independent"" when her husband of two weeks is already having an affair. And the student who is showing promise to already be independent suddenly becomes ""typically 50's"" when she decides not to go to law school and gets married instead. I don't know what sort of point the film was trying to make with this. Neither story adds up or makes sense or is inspiring... but neither is it discouraging. It's just... shrugs.. there. Again, what's wrong with getting married and having a family? Obviously the girl didn't want to go to law school. The girl who ""becomes independent"" didn't want independence either... it was forced on her by a cheating husband.OK the whole point is that I just didn't get what point the film was trying to express. There are half a dozen sub stories of these girls and teacher's romantic lives but nothing really came together at the end.When Watson takes off at the end to go to Europe I was thinking (but wasn't she upset the MAN didn't go to Europe... what?) Why is she going? Who cares? Is she still terrified of men... YES. She leaves two men in one film for the lamest reasons. Is it because she's a liberal feminist? Nope. Or I missed something.",2,Anachorist and confusing plot points.,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,5361,"['ways', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'cast', 'female', 'actors', 'was',

797629,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0001ADAVK,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 8]","Julia Roberts plays Katherine Watson, an art teacher who thinks she's lucked out when offered a job at a prestigious school for young women in the 1950's.  From the first reel, everything about the flick screams ""Dead Poets"" with women instead of laughs, and nothing ever changes your mind - except for making you re-think the fun you might have had watching ""Dead Poets"".  In short ""Smiling"" is a movie that praises characters that leap past the trite expectations of their peers, yet boasts a script that fulfills every trite Hollywood clich&eacute;.  Watson is horrified to learn that young women of the 1950's are being groomed for a life of craven servility and grim conformity (forgetting for a moment that the same was roughly true for about everybody in those days).  Watson's young charges are intelligent, but also resigned to a life in the shadows of likely caddish husbands chosen by their weak-willed parents.  By the end of the movie, Watson's students learn to break the bonds that condemned their parents to loveless and unfulfilled lives (except for one student who does choose to forego the promising future as a lawyer for one as a housewife - but does have to convince Watson of the rightness of her decision).  Being an accomplished woman means traveling abroad (rather than saying you did), getting an apartment in Greenwich Village, and foregoing marriage unless you're utterly more determined by an order of magnitude to opt for either of the above.  We also learn that parents are utterly worthless - grooming their daughters for a dim future, if only to be spared the horror of having to explain why they fell for the same trap.  None of the villains - upper society women for the most part - are elevated from the anonymous and unforgiving roles the script sticks them with (in mirroring their evil, the script treats them as we're supposed to believe they treat their daughters), and we're supposed to cheer when their daughters zing them into defeated muteness.

Julia Robert's lips annoy me to no end and her character in this film simply didn't ring true to me nor did any of the other characters, because they all seemed to be so exaggerated.  I was in college during this period and while things were a great deal more conservative than they are today I don't recall them as being as conservative and uptight as this film portrays.  None of the girls I dated during this period felt that their future was tied to some man.  In fact several of the girls (women) that I knew and dated during this period went on to have significant careers (and marriages).I cannot believe that any mother would expect her daughter to stick by a philandering jerk like this film would have you believe.  Julia Robert's character was there to teach art history but seems more focused on getting her feminist agenda across than doing her job.  Furthermore her view of art seemed rather narrow much like teaching music appreciation by focusing exclusively on Rock.  I thought she should have been fired for failing to teach the subject.I also couldn't or didn't understand the affair between her and the smarmy philandering teacher who was bedding his students.  Even a blind man could have seen from the outset what this man was like and a feminist like Robert's was supposed to have been would not have tolerated him for a minute.  In fact, reporting him to the administration would have been more in character.Overall I thought the film was entertaiing and I watched it to the end.  As I said my wife loved this film and thought it portrayed life as she knew it during this period.  Not being a woman maybe it did, but for me the entire film was exaggerated and unbelievable.

797631,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0001ADAVK,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 4]","""Mona Lisa Smile"" is the type of female vanity piece that has to wink at its subject - in this case, smart Wellesey College girls caught in an era of intellectual oppression - to cater to the theater herd. The movie's telling a smarter story than it seems to, but it's buried underneath playing nice to all the types of women staring back from the seats.Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts, who also produced) is a liberal California art history professor bent on suceeding at Wellesley, then (and still) one of the premier colleges solely for young women. Her reception is cold: The students have memorized the textbook, and her boarder (Marcia Gay Harden) is an elocution instructor ten years ahead of the spinster curve. The college, and the community, is fixated on finding husbands, serving them, then living through them; indeed, this well-off crowd, their mothers having missed their days as Rosie The Riverter, were just beginning to see they could, as Katherine says, ""bake their cake and eat it too.""Through Katherine's teaching of the modern, ""subversive"" artists (well, just Picasso and Pollack),  two of the principal senior students - ugly duckling Connie (Gennifer Goodwin) and do-gooder Joan (Julia Stiles) - to begin unthaw, while the shrewd-but-repressed Betty (Kirsten Dunst) initially rebels, and loose Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), better suited to the Roaring 20s, inhabits the self-destructive-yet-wiser-than-her-years role, essentially carrying on as she had before.Director Mike Newell's rendering of the era, replete with maypoles and hula hoop races, is nearly perfect, and the supporting performances, save Dominic West's turn as yet another sleazy-but-alluring cad, settle the film. Roberts dials down her appearance and acting - she still looks pretty fantastic -and is alarmingly content to let her ""girls"" steal the movie.Alas, the quartet is not always up to it, specifically Stiles, whose performance is a letdown on par with her character's questionable decision to skip law school and cater to a pasty businessman (Topher Grace). Dunst's Betty, closest in personality to the prideful, demanding Katherine, is forced into an unconvincing conversion after several sharp, tense scenes with her teacher. Gyllenhaal's Giselle has nowhere to go and Goodwin's Connie goes where too many movies have already been; both should have been cut from this movie, but that would have left the floozies and wallflowers of the crowd without an archetype to follow.So ""Mona Lisa Smile"" becomes, then, a grand ""it takes all kinds"" tour of women's wants/dreams/needs without really settling on anything. Roberts is restrained by the script in key moments and forced to embrace Joan and Giselle, even though neither seems particularly strong or insightful, while warring with Betty until a hollow reconciliation. She is also needlessly girly in several scenes, as well; her intellectual wisdom is cloaked by apparent enjoyment in the ""dame dishing"" of the day. This is what they call the ""luminous"" woman, brilliant by day, drunkard and dancer by night. Search all day and night for Katherine's darker corners; aside from a few bad choices in men, you're not going to find any. No doubt Roberts would like to be this woman; I'd wager she's closer to her ""Notting Hill"" character instead.Every one of ""the girls"" disappear for stretches at a time, and some point they stop having the brains to talk out their positions, and merely allow their actions to speak: This one gets married, this one drags hard on a cigarette, this one bites her mister's lower lip at the jazz concert. And after a smattering of art in hour one, Katherine's subject matter is shoved aside for her greater talents of mentoring and topical rumination. It has been said that a great teacher makes you love the subject; by the end of ""Mona Lisa Smile,"" the only thing the Wellesley girls love is Katherine. That emotion works on some level, too, but you get the feeling that, Betty aside, the students will instead look to their men rather than themselves come the Kennedy/Nixon election.",3,"A sharp exam of the 50s, but too scared to offend.",1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,4069,"['Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'type', 'female', 'vanity', 'piece', 'wink', 'subject', 'case', 'smart', 'Wellesey', 'College', 'girls', 'caught', 'era', 'intellectual', 'oppression', 'cater', 'theater', 'herd', 'movie', 'telling', 'smarter', 'story', 'buried', 'underneath', 'playing', 'nice', 'types', 'women', 'staring', 'back', 'seats.Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'liberal', 'California', 'art', 'history', 'professor', 'bent', 'suceeding', 'Wellesley', 'then', 'still', 'one', 'premier', 'solely', 'young', 'women', 'reception', 'cold', 'students', 'have', 'memorized', 'textbook', 'boarder', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'elocution', 'instructor', 'ten', 'years', 'ahead', 'spinster', 'curve', 'college', 'community', 'fixated', 'finding', 'husbands', 'serving', 'then', 'living', 'indeed', 'well-off', 'crowd', 'mothers', 'having', 'missed', 'days', 'Rosie', 'Riverter', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'see', 'could', 'Katherine', 'bake', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'Katherine', 'teaching', 'modern', 'subversive', 'artists', 'well', 'just', 'Picasso', 'Pollack', 'two', 'principal', 'senior', 'students', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'Connie', 'Gennifer', 'Goodwin', 'do-gooder', 'Joan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'begin', 'unthaw', 'shrewd-but-repressed', 'Betty', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'initially', 'rebels', 'loose', 'Giselle', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'better', 'suited', 'Roaring', '20s', 'self-destructive-yet-wiser-than-her-years', 'role', 'essentially', 'carrying', 'had', 'before.Director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'rendering', 'era', 'replete', 'maypoles', 'hula', 'hoop', 'races', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'supporting', 'performances', 'save', 'Dominic', 'West', 'turn', 'yet', 'sleazy-but-alluring', 'cad', 'settle', 'film', 'dials', 'down', 'appearance', 'acting', 'still', 'pretty', 'fantastic', '-and', 'alarmingly', 'content', 'let', 'girls', 'steal', 'movie.Alas', 'quartet', 'not', 'always', 'specifically', 'Stiles', 'performance', 'letdown', 'par', 'character', 'questionable', 'decision', 'skip', 'law', 'school', 'cater', 'pasty', 'businessman', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Dunst', 'Betty', 'closest', 'personality', 'prideful', 'demanding', 'Katherine', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'conversion', 'several', 'sharp', 'tense', 'scenes', 'teacher', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Giselle', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Goodwin', 'Connie', 'where', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'floozies', 'wallflowers', 'crowd', 'archetype', 'follow.So', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'then', 'grand', 'kinds', 'tour', 'women', 'wants/dreams/needs', 'really', 'settling', 'anything', 'Roberts', 'restrained', 'script', 'key', 'moments', 'forced', 'embrace', 'Joan', 'Giselle', 'even', 'neither', 'particularly', 'strong', 'insightful', 'warring', 'Betty', 'hollow', 'reconciliation', 'also', 'needlessly', 'girly', 'several', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'intellectual', 'wisdom', 'cloaked', 'apparent', 'enjoyment', 'dame', 'dishing', 'day', 'what', 'call', 'luminous', 'woman', 'brilliant', 'day', 'drunkard', 'dancer', 'night', 'Search', 'day', 'night', 'Katherine', 'darker', 'corners', 'aside', 'few', 'bad', 'choices', 'men', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'doubt', 'Roberts', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'woman', ""'d"", 'wager', 'closer', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'character', 'instead.Every', 'one', 'girls', 'disappear', 'stretches', 'time', 'point', 'stop', 'having', 'brains', 'talk', 'out', 'positions', 'merely', 'allow', 'actions', 'speak', 'one', 'married', 'one', 'hard', 'cigarette', 'one', 'mister', 'lower', 'lip', 'jazz', 'concert', 'smattering', 'art', 'hour', 'one', 'Katherine', 'subject', 'matter', 'shoved', 'aside', 'greater', 'talents', 'mentoring', 'topical', 'rumination', 'been', 'said', 'great', 'teacher', 'love', 'subject', 'end', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'only', 'thing', 'Wellesley', 'girls', 'love', 'Katherine', 'emotion', 'level', 'too', 'get', 'feeling', 'Betty', 'aside', 'students', 'will', 'instead', 'look', 'men', 'rather', 'come', 'Kennedy/Nixon', 'election']",Mona Lisa Smile

As a modern woman in college, it was interesting for me to see such intelligent women toss their degrees aside in favour of just being a wife and mother. The character of Joan shows that this is not necessarily a bad thing. She wanted to be educated, but she also wanted the life of a wife and mother. Feminism isn't defined by excelling in your career and avoiding marriage at all costs. It's about being empowered to make your own choices. If a woman chooses to be a wife and mother, good for her. I think the movie did a fine job of showing the different choices women can make.Aside from the feminism debate, this movie was just plain entertaining.

Wellesley is an exclusive girls' school, home to well-bred, wealthy young women whose sole purpose after college (often during) is to get married, have babies, and be the perfect mother and housewife. Katherine is quickly frustrated by the stifling traditional atmosphere.On the first day of class, Katherine is humiliated when all of the students have memorized the art history textbook, quickly making a shambles of her first lesson. Shaken, Katherine calls her boyfriend in tears. The girls are rude, conceited, and have no intent to challenge themselves, which is where Katherine draws the line. Ever the trooper, she marches back to the next class with slides of modern art, making the girls think outside the textbook on the nature of art.The rest of the film follows Katherine as she attempts to fight the Stepford Wives system: the girls spend time learning etiquette, poise, and elocution, place settings, and banter, but mostly hunting future husbands and having lavish weddings. Katherine soon locks horns with Betty (Kirsten Dunst), the most dangerous of the lot. Betty's backstabbing quickly sees to the firing of the school's lesbian nurse for distributing contraceptives, and tries to have Katherine fired as well. She is generally only good at bringing misery to those around her, failing to see her own shortcomings or her husband's infidelities.Katherine soon comes up against the opinions of the other professors, and is pursued by Bill Dunbar, the handsome Italian professor who sleeps with his students. To me, the romance felt forced: Katherine rejects a marriage proposal, and a woman as liberal and feminist as Katherine wouldn't be caught dead with the chauvinistic Bill. The camaraderie of several of the students (Joan, Giselle, and Connie) is shown throughout the year at different campus events, which serves to develop their characters and to see the difference that Katherine makes on their lives (Giselle aspires to be more like Katherine).Katherine soon is introducing ""dangerous, subversive"" feminist ideas by using propaganda (advertisements) of housewives to show the girls that throwing their education away for a happy home is a mistake. One of her students, Joan, is accepted to Yale Law School, but her decision and freedom is ultimately her own to decide.This was a better movie than I expected after reading several reviews. The period costumes and music really transported me to a simpler time. Julia Roberts' character was delightfully down to earth, and the many big-name young stars (Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal) fit seamlessly into the fabric of the early 1950s. The scenery of Wellesley College (filmed on location) reminded me strongly of my own campus (Michigan State with its Beaumont Tower). The film has moments of humor, but also darker moments of jealousy and spite that result in larger consequences (the firing of the school nurse, a broken relationship, a girl being thrown out of her home).The DVD comes with a few extras, namely three featurettes on College: Now and Then, Art History, and What Women Wanted: 1953, which all feature movie footage interspersed with interviews from cast and crew, a music video for Elton John's ""The Heart of Every Girl,"" and several movie trailers.",4,"What women wanted: the 1950s ""happy housewife"" breaks free",1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,3479,"['Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'Katherine', 'Ann', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'progressive', 'feminist', 'art', 'teacher', 'California', 'Wellesley', '1953', 'accept', 'dream', 'job', 'art', 'history', 'professor', 'Wellesley', 'exclusive', 'girls', 'school', 'home', 'well-bred', 'wealthy', 'young', 'women', 'sole', 'purpose', 'college', 'often', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'babies', 'be', 'perfect', 'mother', 'housewife', 'Katherine', 'quickly', 'frustrated', 'stifling', 'traditional', 'first', 'day', 'class', 'Katherine', 'humiliated', 'when', 'students', 'have', 'memorized', 'art', 'history', 'textbook', 'quickly', 'making', 'shambles', 'first', 'lesson', 'Shaken', 'Katherine', 'boyfriend', 'tears', 'girls', 'are', 'rude', 'conceited', 'have', 'intent', 'challenge', 'where', 'Katherine', 'line', 'Ever', 'trooper', 'back', 'next', 'class', 'slides', 'modern', 'art', 'making', 'girls', 'think', 'textbook', 'nature', 'art.The', 'rest', 'film', 'Katherine', 'fight', 'Stepford', 'system', 'girls', 'spend', 'time', 'learning', 'etiquette', 'poise', 'elocution', 'place', 'settings', 'banter', 'mostly', 'hunting', 'future', 'husbands', 'having', 'lavish', 'weddings', 'Katherine', 'soon', 'horns', 'Betty', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'most', 'dangerous', 'lot', 'Betty', 'backstabbing', 'quickly', 'sees', 'firing', 'school', 'lesbian', 'nurse', 'distributing', 'contraceptives', 'tries', 'have', 'Katherine', 'fired', 'well', 'generally', 'only', 'good', 'bringing', 'misery', 'failing', 'see', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'husband', 'infidelities.Katherine', 'soon', 'up', 'opinions', 'other', 'professors', 'pursued', 'Bill', 'Dunbar', 'handsome', 'Italian', 'professor', 'who', 'students', 'romance', 'felt', 'forced', 'Katherine', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'woman', 'liberal', 'feminist', 'Katherine', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'chauvinistic', 'Bill', 'camaraderie', 'several', 'students', 'Joan', 'Giselle', 'Connie', 'shown', 'year', 'different', 'campus', 'events', 'develop', 'characters', 'see', 'difference', 'Katherine', 'lives', 'Giselle', 'be', 'more', 'Katherine', '.Katherine', 'soon', 'introducing', 'dangerous', 'subversive', 'feminist', 'ideas', 'using', 'propaganda', 'advertisements', 'housewives', 'show', 'girls', 'throwing', 'education', 'away', 'happy', 'home', 'mistake', 'One', 'students', 'Joan', 'accepted', 'Yale', 'Law', 'School', 'decision', 'freedom', 'ultimately', 'own', 'decide.This', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'expected', 'reading', 'several', 'reviews', 'period', 'costumes', 'music', 'really', 'transported', 'simpler', 'time', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'was', 'delightfully', 'down', 'earth', 'many', 'big-name', 'young', 'stars', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'fit', 'seamlessly', 'fabric', 'early', '1950s', 'scenery', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'filmed', 'location', 'reminded', 'strongly', 'own', 'campus', 'Michigan', 'State', 'Beaumont', 'Tower', 'film', 'moments', 'humor', 'also', 'darker', 'moments', 'jealousy', 'spite', 'result', 'larger', 'consequences', 'firing', 'school', 'nurse', 'broken', 'relationship', 'girl', 'being', 'thrown', 'home', '.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'namely', 'three', 'featurettes', 'College', 'Now', 'Then', 'Art', 'History', 'What', 'Women', 'Wanted', '1953', 'feature', 'movie', 'footage', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'music', 'video', 'Elton', 'John', 'Heart', 'Every', 'Girl', 'several', 'movie', 'trailers']",Mona Lisa Smile
797635,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0001ADAVK,Sarah Schenkkan,"[0, 0]","The 1950s. The decade best known for its classic style, revolutionary music, major political events, and the rebirth of American society after a devastating war. Now, in 2003, it is also the setting for one of the most promising fall movies of the year, ""Mona Lisa Smile"", which although moderately satisfying, fall short of greatness.This film, which also drew much attention as it symbolized Julia Robert's comeback after a year of seclusion, follows the story of UC Berkely graduate Katherine Watson (Roberts) who takes up a position as an art history teacher at the prestigious Wellesly College. As an all-girls school, the main conflict in the movie stems from the students torn between the more repressive morals and molds of 1950s women and their wishes for a more respectful, intellectual existence. As well as the conflict within the student body, Katherine finds herself immersed in controversy as well, as her curriculum and methods of teaching in the beginning are not respected by the faculty or the students she teaches. Among them, a harsh headmistress (Marian Seldes) and a scathing student with a dark secret (Kirsten Dunst) who critizes her every move.However, as much predicted, Katherine wins over the students and parts of the faculty, but it is the way in which the film comes to a close that is rather unsettling. Characters that were well-established in the first hour of the film begin to lose their signature beliefs or attitudes towards different characters that were so strongly stressed, and plotlines are left without explanation, which leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Not only that, but the story ends predictably, and not to mention abruptly, with little inclination as to how it got there. It's easy to tell the ideals and motives that the film is trying to stress, and it sets out with an ambitious idea on how to show them to the viewers, but it can't quite articulate the ideas in a meaningful fashion so that it touches the audience.With a slew of brilliant young actresses (such as the wonderful Kirsten Dunst, newcomer Ginnifer Goodwin, and my personal favorite in the film, Maggie Gyllenhaal), with mostly solid performances (with the exception of Julia Stiles, who was suprisingly bland in her role as Joan) and a wonderful idea for a film, it's quite a mystery to me how ""Mona Lisa Smile"" doesn't quite satisfy us as the audience as much as we would like it to. It could possibly be the direction of Mike Newell, although much more likely the writing team of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (who collaborated on ""Planet of the Apes"", among others), who although presenting us with a handful of feel-good moments, shocking turn-arounds, and emotional scenes in the script, try too hard to close up the story with a happy ending, which in turn, leaves many of the important plotlines and conclusions to the original motives off the radar. In short, ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is definitely one of the feel-good movies of the fall, but don't expect it to generate any Oscar buzz.",3,"""Mona Lisa"" Brings A Small Smile",1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,3032,"['1950s', 'decade', 'best', 'known', 'classic', 'style', 'revolutionary', 'music', 'major', 'political', 'events', 'rebirth', 'American', 'society', 'devastating', 'war', 'Now', '2003', 'also', 'setting', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'fall', 'movies', 'year', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'moderately', 'satisfying', 'fall', 'short', 'greatness.This', 'film', 'also', 'drew', 'much', 'attention', 'symbolized', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'comeback', 'year', 'seclusion', 'story', 'UC', 'Berkely', 'graduate', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Roberts', 'who', 'up', 'position', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'prestigious', 'Wellesly', 'College', 'all-girls', 'school', 'main', 'conflict', 'movie', 'students', 'torn', 'more', 'repressive', 'morals', 'molds', '1950s', 'women', 'wishes', 'more', 'respectful', 'intellectual', 'existence', 'As', 'well', 'conflict', 'student', 'body', 'Katherine', 'immersed', 'controversy', 'as', 'well', 'curriculum', 'methods', 'teaching', 'beginning', 'are', 'not', 'respected', 'faculty', 'students', 'harsh', 'headmistress', 'Marian', 'Seldes', 'scathing', 'student', 'dark', 'secret', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'move.However', 'much', 'predicted', 'Katherine', 'students', 'parts', 'faculty', 'way', 'film', 'close', 'rather', 'unsettling', 'Characters', 'were', 'well-established', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'begin', 'lose', 'signature', 'beliefs', 'attitudes', 'different', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'strongly', 'stressed', 'plotlines', 'are', 'left', 'explanation', 'audience', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Not', 'only', 'story', 'predictably', 'not', 'mention', 'abruptly', 'little', 'inclination', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'easy', 'tell', 'ideals', 'motives', 'film', 'trying', 'stress', 'out', 'ambitious', 'idea', 'how', 'show', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'articulate', 'ideas', 'meaningful', 'fashion', 'audience.With', 'slew', 'brilliant', 'young', 'actresses', 'such', 'wonderful', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'newcomer', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'mostly', 'solid', 'performances', 'exception', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'was', 'suprisingly', 'bland', 'role', 'Joan', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'film', 'quite', 'mystery', 'how', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', ""n't"", 'quite', 'satisfy', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'direction', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'writing', 'team', 'Lawrence', 'Konner', 'Mark', 'Rosenthal', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'others', 'who', 'presenting', 'handful', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'shocking', 'turn-arounds', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'script', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'close', 'up', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'turn', 'many', 'important', 'plotlines', 'conclusions', 'original', 'motives', 'radar', 'short', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'definitely', 'one', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'fall', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'generate', 'Oscar', 'buzz']",Mona Lisa Smile

It was about lust vs. love, loyalty vs. society, and heart-felt emotion vs. hiding behind a sweet smile and a stony heart.  The film does not present marriage as a farce or promescuity as the preferred option - rather it embraces the idea that a woman can have a family AND still learn and grow and be more than a proper hostess and trophy wife.Watson is not portrayed as the all-wise, all-knowing, always-right person - rather she is someone who awakens her students to the possibility that they can do more than be consumers and baby factories - they can know and understand art and radical ideas - without having to like either... but at least to have a more rounded view of life than the narrow objectives portrayed on television and print media at the time.In the mid-1950s (when this movie is set), Watson's subversive notions do not make her popular with the staff, but they make her very popular with most of her students.While there is no nudity and only a couple of ""bad"" words used, there are mature themes and lots of implied non-traditional sexual relationships, so parents should be aware.While I am always impressed with Julia Roberts' acting ability, and even though she was the lead - I really think it will be Maggie Gyllenhall and newcomer Ginnifer Goodwin (Connie Baker)  that will be most noted for their performances in this film - believable, flawless and truly stellar.  Topher Grace (""That 70's Show,"" ""Traffic"") makes another impressive (albeit small) appearance into a substantial film, ironically the love interest of Julia Stiles as was the case in ""Traffic"" and Tori Amos has a brief singing role.In the end, this is a sweet, feel-good movie peppered with some bitter-sweet moments.

Having gone to an all-girls high school in New England that has always been a feeder for Wellesley (and the Wellesley of today is quite different than in the 50's), I was admittedly curious about the film.  However, all my good sense told me to stay away.  I had enough feminism shoved down my throat at that school to last me a lifetime.That said, I eventually saw the film as a captive audience member on an overseas flight.  As they jumped in to the story, all the stereotypes came screaming out of the screen to me: stuffy old New England school, liberal from California, jaded students who know how to act the part for teachers, rich kids with parents on trustee boards, etc.  I think the movie relies on these well-worn characters because the writers certainly didn't do a very good job of developing them.  You just sort of fall into a familiar world.My main criticisms of the film are:1. As the movie progressed, I kept thinking that the storyline wasn't in sync with the character development.  They kept jumping ahead in the plot, assuming that you are keeping up with all the nuances of all the girls as they bloom in their senior year.  Really, this wasn't too hard as they kept the girls pretty one-dimensional.2. The whole 'Mona Lisa' concept was forced and ridiculous.  It didn't make sense that Julia Robert's lover called her that, and Kirsten Dunst's scene where she discusses this with her mother is laughable.  You knew what Dunst was getting at, but the film must have relied heavily on the audience's personal sentiment because they certainly didn't bring you there emotionally.3. And the ending...my goodness what a rip-off of 'Dead Poet's Society.'  Many movies have ripped off 'Dead Poet's Society,' but none seemed as clear as this.  I won't give it away, but don't worry...the girls didn't all stand up on their desks at least.For all that, I don't think the movie was a complete failure.  I thought the following were noteworthy in the film:1. First off, I need to praise Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting!!!  'Who?' you may ask.  She was the 4th one mentioned in all the previews and was the one that no-one really knew.  Her character could in some ways be a tired cliche, but she brought it to life and easily stole every scene she was in.  I was really mesmorized by her performance, and I look forward to more in the future.2. Ginnifer Goodwin (the cello player) and Marcia Gay Harden (the old spinster) also turned very solid performances.3. The fact that Julia Robert's character was ultimately able to turn down relationships with 2 charming men was fairly remarkable.  The fact that she had, needed and enjoyed these relationships so much shows that she is not anti-male or anti-marriage.  She merely has a mature understanding that marriage is not an absolute good and that neither of these men could ultimately stand by her.4. What they did with Julia Styles' character (girl who was accepted into Yale Law School) was also impressive in this 'progressive' film.  That character perhaps single-handedly kept this from being just empty feminist propaganda.5. Kirsten Dunst's role (the girl who gets married) & her relationship with her mother gives some spooky insight into 'advice' some girls were getting from their mothers.  The night her mother turns her away from her home is particularly painful.Overall, I think the film is pretentious and completely misses what it aimed to be.  Additionally, I don't think Roberts, Dunst or Styles turned in particularly outstanding performances.

However contary to expectations it is an entertaining and pleasant film.One of the things it has going for it was that Dead Poets Society was such a brain dead film.

This film by comparisson is far more intelligent.Julia Roberts instead of advocating a get in touch with your inner feelings message as Williams did in Dead Poets does two things. Firstly she is able to teach art history in a way that is not patronising and is rational.

797648,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001ADAVK,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","'Mona Lisa Smile' is a period film in the 1950s America, about teacher of painting Kathrine Watson played by Julia Roberts.  The story slightly resembles that of 'Dead Poet Society' -- a teacher with a new idea, who makes a difference in uptight school -- but the film ends up with assorted scenes and dialogues with the cliched episodes about cliched characters.Sorry if I sound harsh, but the film is really predictable, and safe.  Katherine teaches painting before the serious students whose concerns are memorizing the textbooks.  Some are rebels (like Maggie Gyllenhaal's character smoking Giselle); some only think of marriage (like Kirsten Dunst's conservative Betty, and, well, so on and on.  There is a romance surrounding Julia's character, but the love story is too shallow and forgettable.Now, what happens to each student, you can predict from the beginning; and what Katherine does, going against the grain (so she thinks), you can imagine from miles apart.  Instead of the course authorized by the school, Katherine shows the bedazzled students a piece of modern art -- what do you see?  Of course, Pollock.  Too predictable.But after all, the whole problem is this: 'Julia Roberts in a period film?  With Kirsten Dunst?'  If you remember their successful films, they are all set in contemporary situations -- like 'Erin' 'Pretty Woman' 'Ocean' or 'Spider-man' 'Bring it On' -- and these actresses here (I mean Julia Stiles or Maggie Gyllenhaal too) all look out of place.  They should have known that they start to shine in modern situation.  Mike Newell, who directed two great films 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Donnie Brasco,' clearly didn't see 'Mary Reiley.'Coming from the writer team Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (whose scripts include Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' and 'Mercury Rising' -- oh dear), 'Mona Lisa Smile' remains trite and boring from the begining to the end.  And the costumes are good, but when other parts are so lamentable, what is the point of watching the costumes?The only actor who should be praised is Juliet Stevenson, who represents the unbending belief and confidence in her creed shown with a wicked sense of humor.  And that attitude is what Julia Roberts should have shown on the screen.  When Juliet Stevenson leaves (and too early), the film is dead.

797649,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0001ADAVK,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 2]","I am an unabashed fan of the actress Julia Roberts[...]. Since she is not only the star but also one of the producers of this film, I felt it important to reveal my potential bias right up front. This is an historically accurate, thought provoking comedy that succeeds in both entertaining the audience while reminding us how much society and gender roles in this country have changed in the past fifty years.The plot is simplicity itself, and since it has been detailed in numerous print views I will only outline it in summary form. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) arrives at the prestigious Wellesley College in the fall of 1953 as a new art history instructor. She has a undistinguished background and her capabilities are immediately tested by the students in her class. She soon discovers that Wellesley is more of a finishing school and ""marriage prep"" than an institution preparing its student to use their education to pursue careers and or influence the political landscape. When she uses nontraditional teaching techniques and lessons outside the prescribed syllabus, the fact that she is an ""enlightened"" and unmarried woman in that decade of conformity means that her goals are immediately subject to the suspicion of not only the students but also her fellow faculty members and conservative parents and alumni as well. There are all the crosscurrents one would expect, including the obligatory romantic conflict between her previous boyfriend and a male faculty member.The genius of the film is in its execution. Its attention to detail and the accuracy of its portrayal of the fifties is astounding, and probably will seem unbelievable to the young women of today. And while Katherine Watson is clearly the central character, this is really more of an ensemble cast with many fine performances. Kirsten Dunst is Betty Warren, the student who becomes Katherine's nemesis as the protector of the status quo and the controlling senior who wants to direct everyone's lives. Ginnifer Goodwin as a shy girl who eventually achieves the self confidence that she has been so lacking does a wonderful job, as does Julia Stiles as Joan Brandwyn, the senior who consciously decides to become the loving wife and mother rather than pursue graduate studies and a career.  Marian Seldes is also well cast as the college president caught between her conflicting roles as an educator and as the administrator charged with resolving the unease that Katherine has caused within the college's constituencies. Lastly, Marcia Gay Harden as Nancy Abbey, who teaches etiquette and whose overchintzed home is where Katherine lives and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Giselle Levy, who believes in living outside the Wellesley lines and defying Betty whenever possible almost steal the spotlight from Ms. Roberts' performance.This is a hard film to rate, as indicated by the diverse viewpoints of other reviewers. I really enjoyed it but in some ways left the theater also feeling a little unfulfilled. The film asks more questions than it answers, and while the extent of Katherine's influence on her students in the short term is acknowledged; the long term impact is left undelineated. In other words, just as in life itself you wonder what will happen next. But since it so wonderfully portrayed the slice of life that it examined, I decided to round up my rating to five stars. However, be prepared: in the end we moviegoers are left to decide for ourselves whether Mona Lisa's smile is one of happiness or is only to be true to society's expectations of her.Tucker Andersen",5,(4 )  Why Is This Woman Smiling?,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,3559,"['am', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Roberts', '[', ']', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'also', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'felt', 'important', 'reveal', 'potential', 'bias', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'historically', 'accurate', 'thought', 'provoking', 'comedy', 'entertaining', 'audience', 'reminding', 'how', 'much', 'society', 'gender', 'roles', 'country', 'have', 'changed', 'past', 'fifty', 'years.The', 'plot', 'simplicity', 'been', 'detailed', 'numerous', 'print', 'views', 'will', 'only', 'outline', 'summary', 'form', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'prestigious', 'Wellesley', 'College', 'fall', '1953', 'new', 'art', 'history', 'instructor', 'undistinguished', 'background', 'capabilities', 'are', 'immediately', 'tested', 'students', 'class', 'soon', 'discovers', 'Wellesley', 'more', 'finishing', 'school', 'marriage', 'prep', 'institution', 'preparing', 'student', 'use', 'education', 'pursue', 'careers', 'influence', 'political', 'landscape', 'When', 'nontraditional', 'teaching', 'techniques', 'lessons', 'prescribed', 'syllabus', 'fact', 'enlightened', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'decade', 'conformity', 'goals', 'are', 'immediately', 'subject', 'suspicion', 'not', 'only', 'students', 'also', 'fellow', 'faculty', 'members', 'conservative', 'parents', 'alumni', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'crosscurrents', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'including', 'obligatory', 'romantic', 'conflict', 'previous', 'boyfriend', 'male', 'faculty', 'member.The', 'genius', 'film', 'execution', 'attention', 'detail', 'accuracy', 'portrayal', 'fifties', 'astounding', 'probably', 'will', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'young', 'women', 'today', 'Katherine', 'Watson', 'clearly', 'central', 'character', 'really', 'more', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Betty', 'Warren', 'student', 'who', 'Katherine', 'nemesis', 'protector', 'status', 'quo', 'controlling', 'senior', 'who', 'direct', 'everyone', 'lives', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'eventually', 'self', 'confidence', 'been', 'so', 'lacking', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Joan', 'Brandwyn', 'senior', 'who', 'consciously', 'become', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'rather', 'pursue', 'graduate', 'studies', 'career', 'Marian', 'Seldes', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'college', 'president', 'caught', 'conflicting', 'roles', 'educator', 'administrator', 'charged', 'resolving', 'unease', 'Katherine', 'caused', 'college', 'constituencies', 'Lastly', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Nancy', 'Abbey', 'who', 'etiquette', 'overchintzed', 'home', 'where', 'Katherine', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Giselle', 'Levy', 'who', 'living', 'Wellesley', 'lines', 'defying', 'Betty', 'whenever', 'possible', 'almost', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'Ms.', 'Roberts', 'performance.This', 'hard', 'film', 'rate', 'indicated', 'diverse', 'viewpoints', 'other', 'reviewers', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'ways', 'left', 'theater', 'also', 'feeling', 'little', 'unfulfilled', 'film', 'more', 'questions', 'extent', 'Katherine', 'influence', 'students', 'short', 'term', 'acknowledged', 'long', 'term', 'impact', 'left', 'undelineated', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'life', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'slice', 'life', 'examined', 'decided', 'round', 'up', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'end', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'left', 'decide', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'smile', 'one', 'happiness', 'only', 'be', 'true', 'society', 'expectations', 'her.Tucker', 'Andersen']",Mona Lisa Smile

Katherine is a feminist and is astonished when she realizes that Wellesley is basically nothing more than a finishing school for girls before they get married. Besides the usual goals of teachers (to broaden students' horizons, provide them with an educational foundation to build their lives upon, give them a platform to leap further in life than they would otherwise, etc.) Watson decides she will do everything she can to show her girls a different way of living and that they don't have to just get married, but that they can have a career and the joys of a married life without actually being married.The imagery in the film is quite beautiful, capturing the delicate colors and moods of the time and season. Most of the acting in the movie was exceptional, especially with the younger actresses. Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Ginnifer Goodwin were delightful in their roles as students of Watson. Their characters were some of the best things the movie has going for it.Julia Roberts, however, is another story. Julia Roberts was simply Julia Roberts; she failed to capture anything of the essence of Katherine Ann Watson. Instead, she seemed to be using the movie as her own personal catharsis. I like Julia Roberts, but MONA LISA SMILES is not one of her finer moments.Structure-wise, the movie attempts to be the female version of DEAD POETS SOCIETY (Several of the film's promoters made that reference many times). Alas, MONA LISA SMILE doesn't even come close to being a female DEAD POETS SOCIETY. DEAD POETS centered around a universal theme of carpe diem. MONA LISA SMILES could have went that route or another universal way, but instead decided to be a political and feminist movie by showing the evils of the traditional role of woman as wife and mother. Besides alienating all the males in the audience, the film alienates over half the female population as well.
