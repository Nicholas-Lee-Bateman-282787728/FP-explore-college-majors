27253,A17NB397AH144H,078002320X,ACS,"[4, 6]","In this Barbet Schroeder film, Olivier (Depardieu) burglarizes the apartment of a dominatrix named Ariane (Ogier).  After Ariane catches him in the act, the two fall in love and Olivier struggles to accept his girlfriend's bizarre profession.  In the uncut Criterion version, some of the torture scenes (which were purportedly filmed using real-life ""slaves"" of a real-life dominatrix) are truly painful to watch, and are undoubtedly some of the most shocking ever to appear in a non-pornographic movie.  Which leads one to ask:  Is Matresse an artsy exploitation flick disguised as a love story, or simply a love story that makes legitimate use of graphic (and violent) sexual imagery?  Either way, the film is moving, provocative, and impossible to forget.  Highly recommended.Four stars out of five.",4,A shocking but moving film experience,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,802,"['Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'film', 'Olivier', 'Depardieu', 'apartment', 'dominatrix', 'named', 'Ariane', 'Ogier', 'Ariane', 'act', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'Olivier', 'accept', 'girlfriend', 'bizarre', 'profession', 'uncut', 'Criterion', 'version', 'torture', 'scenes', 'were', 'purportedly', 'filmed', 'using', 'real-life', 'slaves', 'real-life', 'dominatrix', 'are', 'truly', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'most', 'shocking', 'ever', 'appear', 'non-pornographic', 'movie', 'Which', 'one', 'ask', 'Is', 'Matresse', 'artsy', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'disguised', 'love', 'story', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'legitimate', 'use', 'graphic', 'violent', 'sexual', 'imagery', 'way', 'film', 'moving', 'provocative', 'impossible', 'forget', 'Highly', 'recommended.Four', 'stars', 'five']",N/A
27254,A252V7I3ZP3B3Q,078002320X,Charles A. Horowitz,"[0, 1]","Gerard Depardieu's effortless acting is phenomenal, a real pleasure to watch from frame to frame.  He really draws you into the character.  Reviewers who say it's unwatchable or boring are wrong.  It is an engaging, well paced and often humorous art film.  To me the violence serves as punctuation marks to a love story, rather than the point of it all, so viewers drawn in by the S&M premise who were hoping for profound commentary about a subculture should save their time and money.  Although the penis and horse slaughtering scenes are particularly painful to watch, they are not gratuitous and their matter-of-fact presentation is perhaps what's most shocking.  This is what (some) real people do in real life, and here on screen.  Anyone who is put off by the slaughterhouse scene and who eats meat in real life is either a cruel hypocrite or ignoramus; I'm not sure into which category to place the Depardieu character, since he displays elements of each.  The costumes were designed by a young Karl Lagerfeld -- surprising that nobody has commented on this.  I wonder if that includes the S&M gear, as well as the gorgeous outfits worn by Ogier?  So why only 3 stars?  The movie has much going for it but leaves me flat at the end.  The philosophical and psychological depth are rather shallow -- you'd do much better with Last Tango in Paris -- and the plot, although clever, is not enough to carry the film.  Tango, though, has some boring stretches, so I guess you can't have it all.  Maybe I should have given Maitresse 4 stars.  At the end, my verdict is ... rent, don't buy.",3,"Worth watching, but...",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,1588,"['Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'effortless', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'frame', 'frame', 'really', 'draws', 'character', 'Reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'unwatchable', 'boring', 'are', 'wrong', 'engaging', 'well', 'paced', 'often', 'humorous', 'art', 'film', 'violence', 'punctuation', 'marks', 'love', 'story', 'rather', 'point', 'viewers', 'drawn', 'S', 'M', 'premise', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'profound', 'commentary', 'subculture', 'should', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'penis', 'horse', 'slaughtering', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'matter-of-fact', 'presentation', 'perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'shocking', 'what', 'real', 'people', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'screen', 'Anyone', 'who', 'put', 'off', 'slaughterhouse', 'scene', 'who', 'eats', 'meat', 'real', 'life', 'cruel', 'hypocrite', 'ignoramus', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'category', 'place', 'Depardieu', 'character', 'elements', 'costumes', 'were', 'designed', 'young', 'Karl', 'Lagerfeld', 'surprising', 'nobody', 'commented', 'wonder', 'S', 'M', 'gear', 'as', 'well', 'gorgeous', 'outfits', 'worn', 'Ogier', 'So', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'movie', 'much', 'going', 'flat', 'end', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'depth', 'are', 'rather', 'shallow', ""'d"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'plot', 'clever', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'Tango', 'though', 'boring', 'stretches', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Maitresse', '4', 'stars', 'end', 'verdict', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

During the burglary he encounters Ariane (Bulle Ogier) who he had met earlier, but this time she is a dominatrix who controls situations as she dives into other people's madness.  Ariane is an interesting character that separates her life and her profession as skillfully as do her slaves who consist of lawyers, judges, and other high ranked individuals who seek punishment from her.  Her cruel punishment is well molded after her ""slave's"" desires which consists of all forms of torture and degradation.  Olivier is spellbound by Ariane as he falls in love with her, and it leads him into a scorching affair where he is bound to be burnt as he is mystified by Ariane's dark trade.  Schroeder's creation of Ariane's dual nature can be seen through her use of a downstairs apartment for her dark fantasies and her upstairs apartment for more accepted desires.  In addition, it can also be observed symbolically that the two sides coexists and never are entirely separated as Ariane brings her make-up, clothes, and feelings back upstairs.  Matresse is an avant-garde film as it explores in-depth the theme of sadomasochistic fantasies and its sub-culture as set in a love story.  As a cinematic experience, Matresse offers a shocking, for the unaware, experience that tells an intriguing story which imprisons the curiosity.",4,Upstairs - Downstairs Mistress...,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,1474,"['G', 'eacute', 'rard', 'Depardieu', 'Olivier', 'apartment', 'order', 'rob', 'place', 'unknowingly', 'haven', 'sadomasochistic', 'fantasies', 'burglary', 'Ariane', 'Bulle', 'Ogier', 'who', 'had', 'met', 'earlier', 'time', 'dominatrix', 'who', 'situations', 'other', 'people', 'madness', 'Ariane', 'interesting', 'character', 'life', 'profession', 'as', 'skillfully', 'do', 'slaves', 'who', 'consist', 'lawyers', 'judges', 'other', 'high', 'ranked', 'individuals', 'who', 'seek', 'punishment', 'cruel', 'punishment', 'well', 'molded', 'slave', 'forms', 'torture', 'degradation', 'Olivier', 'spellbound', 'Ariane', 'love', 'scorching', 'affair', 'where', 'bound', 'be', 'burnt', 'mystified', 'Ariane', 'dark', 'trade', 'Schroeder', 'creation', 'Ariane', 'dual', 'nature', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'use', 'downstairs', 'apartment', 'dark', 'fantasies', 'upstairs', 'apartment', 'more', 'accepted', 'desires', 'addition', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'observed', 'symbolically', 'two', 'sides', 'coexists', 'never', 'are', 'entirely', 'separated', 'Ariane', 'make-up', 'clothes', 'feelings', 'back', 'upstairs', 'Matresse', 'avant-garde', 'film', 'in-depth', 'theme', 'sadomasochistic', 'fantasies', 'sub-culture', 'set', 'love', 'story', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Matresse', 'shocking', 'unaware', 'experience', 'intriguing', 'story', 'curiosity']",N/A
27256,A2X25C107CSLOR,078002320X,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[13, 14]","This film written and directed by Barbet Schroeder is unusual since it presents a world of sadomasochist sex play without any hint of eroticism or exploitation. There is more violence in the faux-Helmut Newton portraits in The Eyes of Laura Mars. A slim and beautiful Gerard Depardieu meets dominatrix Bulle Ogier by chance and begins an affair with her. The parallel between the roles she plays with customers who have dictated the terms of their pleasure, and her relationship with Gerard doesn't quite come off. It's about the same as when Schroeder shows us the slaughter of a horse. Depardieu has told us he used to work in a slaughterhouse and when he happens across one in a drunken stupour, the horror of the killing of the animal can't be equated with Bulle piercing a man's chest and penis. The only similarity is in the same matter-of-fact way Schroeder displays both images. When Bulle has a semi-breakdown midway in the film, my interest was peaked since this showed narrative promise. If enacting these roles had a psychological effect on her, that would reveal more to her character than she has allowed us to see. Bulle comments that she likes the play because it allows her into the intimacy of some people's &quot;madness&quot;, she keeps a venus fly trap plant, and has a doberman called Texas. Unfortunately Schroeder has Bulle quickly recover and she returns to her job, thereby reducing her character to a cypher. Therefore Depardieu is the one left to respond. Observing the paraphernalia of s/m can only have a surface interest before you either want to experience the sensation, or you get bored, and it is disappointing that the narrative only extends to his wanting to discover the identity of Bulle's &quot;pimp&quot; as a matter of &quot;control&quot;. When he threatens to make love to her in front of her clients, Schroeder cuts away. The ending is particularly frustrating since Schroeder pulls away from a Postman Always Rings Twice tragedy for a pointless gag.  However he only uses music in certain contexts - eg in the roleplay scenes for comic effect. Otherwise the soundtrack is silent, to reinforce his almost documentary eye to the subject. He would later bring this clean approach to more commercial titles like Reversal of Fortune, but with greater effect.",3,curiosity,971568000,"10 15, 2000",2000,2298,"['film', 'written', 'directed', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'unusual', 'world', 'sadomasochist', 'sex', 'play', 'hint', 'eroticism', 'exploitation', 'more', 'violence', 'faux-Helmut', 'Newton', 'portraits', 'Eyes', 'Laura', 'Mars', 'A', 'slim', 'beautiful', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'dominatrix', 'Bulle', 'Ogier', 'chance', 'affair', 'parallel', 'roles', 'customers', 'who', 'have', 'dictated', 'terms', 'pleasure', 'relationship', 'Gerard', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'off', 'same', 'when', 'Schroeder', 'slaughter', 'horse', 'Depardieu', 'told', 'used', 'work', 'slaughterhouse', 'when', 'one', 'drunken', 'stupour', 'horror', 'killing', 'animal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'equated', 'Bulle', 'piercing', 'man', 'chest', 'penis', 'only', 'similarity', 'same', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'Schroeder', 'images', 'When', 'Bulle', 'semi-breakdown', 'midway', 'film', 'interest', 'was', 'peaked', 'showed', 'narrative', 'promise', 'enacting', 'roles', 'had', 'psychological', 'effect', 'would', 'reveal', 'more', 'character', 'allowed', 'see', 'Bulle', 'comments', 'play', 'intimacy', 'people', 'quot', 'quot', 'venus', 'fly', 'trap', 'plant', 'doberman', 'called', 'Texas', 'Unfortunately', 'Schroeder', 'Bulle', 'quickly', 'recover', 'job', 'thereby', 'reducing', 'character', 'cypher', 'Therefore', 'Depardieu', 'one', 'left', 'respond', 'Observing', 'paraphernalia', 's/m', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'surface', 'interest', 'either', 'want', 'experience', 'sensation', 'get', 'bored', 'disappointing', 'narrative', 'only', 'wanting', 'discover', 'identity', 'Bulle', 'quot', 'quot', 'matter', 'quot', 'control', 'quot', 'When', 'make', 'love', 'front', 'clients', 'Schroeder', 'away', 'ending', 'particularly', 'frustrating', 'Schroeder', 'away', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'tragedy', 'pointless', 'gag', 'However', 'only', 'music', 'certain', 'contexts', 'eg', 'roleplay', 'scenes', 'comic', 'effect', 'Otherwise', 'soundtrack', 'silent', 'reinforce', 'almost', 'documentary', 'eye', 'subject', 'would', 'later', 'bring', 'clean', 'approach', 'more', 'commercial', 'titles', 'Reversal', 'Fortune', 'greater', 'effect']",N/A

The only reason I watched and reviewed it is because it was released by Criterion. The film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood. There is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by. It got an X-rating by the MPAA and was banned in many parts of the US.The film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement.

The director shows us torture, sadomasochism and sexual humiliation or, if you prefer, the business end of a whip. Many whips are used in this 1973 movie, now a sort of cult classic; The Criterion Collection DVD looks terrific and has a new interview with Schroeder that doesn't pretend to any depth. Almost against our will (perfect!), the movie draws us into its kinky extremities only eventually to lose its way. Among the digressions is a horrific slaughterhouse scene, in which a horse is butchered and eaten, that belongs in another movie entirely.Bulle Ogler is seen as a blonde beauty in an upscale apartment who earns a lush living as a dominatrix in a downstairs dungeon designed by the Marquis de Sade. Her clients are rich and powerful and so, apparently, is she. That is what attracts a witless would-be burglar who becomes (in turn) her job assistant, live-in lover-protector, and soon an interfering opportunist who definitely is bad for business. He is played by a young Gerard Depardieu, a husky hunk even then. Europeans know how to treat these characters and subjects seriously and with a straight face. There's that to recommend it. There's also a scene in which the ""maitresse"" (mistress) nails a man's genitals to a block of wood.
