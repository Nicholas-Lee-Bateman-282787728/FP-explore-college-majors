I enjoyed this so much, not only because of the music, the storyline went well, re-creation of the 60s was amazing.I especially watched for the ""entire"" song to be performed and this movie did that superbly.  Choreography was great, would have liked more.  The actors were superb and  the ""David Ruffin"" character performed with amusement, great skill and charisma.  I hadn't known Ruffin was such a challenge to the rest of the group.Part of the success of the Temptations is the ""Funk Brothers"" - the historic group of great musicians who performed so much of that fabulous 60s Motown music.  See that wonderfully entertaining movie ""Standing Behind the Shadows of Motown"" and, there is a CD out too.  Motown!!  There will never be another!

The music is infectious, I just don't get tired of it, and the actors seem like they are having so much fun.  Each actor is charismatic.  They weave a spell over the viewer.  Even the crowds of fans are good.  It's hard to capture the excitement of live performance on film, and in this movie, you feel what it must be like to be a performer, the good and the bad.  I plan to sit down and count all the songs that are woven through the movie, for what you get this movie is worth every penny -- I put on the tape and listen to it several days a week.  Sometimes I watch ""Shout"" David Ruffin's first performance with The Temptations in the film three times in a row.  The energy makes me glad to be alive.It's rare to see such a display of the love of music, it's evident in almost every moment of the film. I can't thank everyone involved enough.  I've ordered the DVD and another tape, just to make sure I never lose it.This movie may not be perfect, but it makes me feel good, and I have been on the internet researching like crazy because it makes me want to know more.

458895,A311Z9223A52RW,6305300887,"Ayesha ""Kathy""","[2, 2]","I purchased the VHS version several years ago and watched it last night for the first time in a long time.  I remember having seen the movie when it was originally broadcast on NBC back in the late 90s.For anyone who is a fan of Motown, the Temptations, music from the 50s-60s era - this is a must see!  The movie begins in 1957 and chronicles the history not only of the Temptations but includes a lot of Motown history as well.  The music is out of this world!Because I'd seen the show when it was originally aired on TV, I realized that some key scenes had been excluded from the VHS; this was very disappointing.  Note that the special was broadcast on two nights at 2 hours each and the VHS is only 2-1/2 hours long, you can figure that quite a bit had been cut.  The pacing seems too quick on the VHS and you get the feeling that you missed something.  Case in point:  There is a scene that had been cut from the VHS that shows Paul Williams in the early years refusing a beer and drinking milk instead.  But in the VHS version, the viewer is unaware of Paul's uncharacteristic descent into alcholism until later when his problem is obvious and one of the band members comments that Paul used to refuse to drink.  When Otis informs the band (then called the Elgins) that they needed to come up with a new name before Mr. Gordy would allow them to audition, the boys banter names back and forth along the sidewalk in front of Hitsville U.S.A.  Their struggle to think of a name was the scene that was cut and I no longer remember which one of the group came up with the Temptations.  Anyway, that's just a small sampling of deleted scenes.  There were many others.I was pleasantly surprised to read in another viewer's review that the DVD contains the full version.  It is well worth purchasing the film again just to have the full version, so I'm clicking this gem into my cart.In closing, I think it should be mentioned that the movie was based upon a book by Otis Williams and that the story is told from his perspective.  Although I loved their music, I was totally unaware of what went on behind-the-scenes.  Sometimes fame exacts a terrible price from those who are unable to handle it.",5,Love It!,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,2197,"['purchased', 'VHS', 'version', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'remember', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'back', 'late', '90s.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Motown', 'Temptations', 'music', '50s-60s', 'era', 'must', 'see', 'movie', '1957', 'history', 'not', 'only', 'Temptations', 'lot', 'Motown', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'world', ""'d"", 'seen', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'TV', 'realized', 'key', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'excluded', 'VHS', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Note', 'special', 'was', 'broadcast', 'two', 'nights', '2', 'hours', 'VHS', 'only', '2-1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'can', 'figure', 'quite', 'bit', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'pacing', 'too', 'quick', 'VHS', 'get', 'feeling', 'missed', 'something', 'Case', 'point', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'VHS', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'early', 'years', 'refusing', 'beer', 'drinking', 'milk', 'instead', 'VHS', 'version', 'viewer', 'unaware', 'Paul', 'uncharacteristic', 'descent', 'alcholism', 'later', 'when', 'problem', 'obvious', 'one', 'band', 'members', 'comments', 'Paul', 'used', 'refuse', 'drink', 'When', 'Otis', 'band', 'then', 'called', 'Elgins', 'needed', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Gordy', 'would', 'allow', 'audition', 'boys', 'banter', 'names', 'back', 'forth', 'sidewalk', 'front', 'Hitsville', 'U.S.A.', 'Their', 'struggle', 'think', 'name', 'was', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'no', 'longer', 'remember', 'one', 'group', 'came', 'up', 'Temptations', 'Anyway', 'just', 'small', 'sampling', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'many', 'others.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'read', 'viewer', 'review', 'DVD', 'full', 'version', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'film', 'again', 'just', 'have', 'full', 'version', ""'m"", 'clicking', 'gem', 'cart.In', 'closing', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Otis', 'Williams', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'loved', 'music', 'was', 'totally', 'unaware', 'what', 'went', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Sometimes', 'fame', 'terrible', 'price', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'handle']",The Temptations VHS

458908,A35FC3DWA1M79H,6305300887,Christopher,"[0, 0]","I am 37 and I first heard of The Temptations through my mother's record collection.  I first saw them in the early 80's when PBS would do documentaries on old music.  At the age of 12 or so, I considered any music before my time old and not something I should be concerned with.  While I knew that the songs were good, I just dismissed them as old-time music.Now we enter The Temptations Mini-series.  I recall the day that this came on (I am still shocked by how many years have passed on THIS!) and it was one of the few made-for-TV movies I was eager to watch since the early 90's at best.  Before this film, I did not know any of their names except David Ruffin only because BET's Video Soul did a special on him when he died.  I did not realize the line-up changes, although I knew of Dennis Edwards.  I did not know about the drugs, suicide, ego and firings before this film!  I can only assume most people did not either...Most people praise the acting, but it was ""ok"" to me.  Then again, it was a made-for-TV movie so in that case, I can priase it too.  As good as this was, if it had been a theactrical release, it probably would have been even better!  The good parts is that it was filmed at Motown at showed how the group came to be.  The only thing it seemed to have missed was the 80's Temptations with ""Treat her Like a Lady.""  Maybe they did not want to hire anouther actor?I think watching Youtube may have gotten me back into this film.  I know just about everyone has this film and they always tried to put it in when I would go over their house.  Lately, I have been fiending (no pun) for this film again!  I ended up getting my own DVD.  I wish it were in wide-screen and on Blu-Ray, but we will have to see what they want to do...After watching this film again, I realized that this was based on a book by Otis Williams - the most obscure Temtptation!  What I gathered after watching it again was that Otis and Melvin was portrayed as good guys who did not touch drugs and were clean-cut, caring people who just wanted to do the right things in life.  Every other Tempt was portrayed as out of control, egomanic drug addicts who wanted everthing for themselves!  Granted, David Ruffins's ego is something I had never heard of before this film, but I can only imagine how he was in real life!  I am sure that drugs helped to fuel his ego.  When a person writes a book, they have a tendacy to put themselves in the focal point (as he could since it's from his perspective) and make himself and HIS buddy Melvin look like saints while all others who joined were trouble makers who had to be let go.  Yes, it appears as if Otis was quick to pull the trigger on singers.There is a cleary hate directed toward Otis looking at the reviews and some may very well be justified.  However, upon looking at Youtube and seeing the videos/lineups, they seem to coincide with the story that Otis is told.  The lead singers always changed but Melvin and Otis always remained.  So it is clear that Otis must have been in control so to speak.  I also suspect that since Otis let Ruffin go and Dennis Edwards came in and they still had hist AND Grammies, he may have felt that he did not need him at all and other singers can easily be replaced and success would continue.  Clearly this seems to have happened because leads kept getting replaced!It always boggled my mind why I would see The Tempts with the little guy with the mustache but when I saw footage from the 60's he was not there and neither was Edwards.  I did not realized that this groupd had so much drama.  This film helped bring some things to light.  What I did not like about ti - and other biographical films is when they show things that did NOT happen!  If Melvin of David did not die that way in the film, why change it?  When people watch a film beased on real people, it would be good to see what actually happened as opposed to us having to look at the real history to find out if it were ture or not.  Sure, films are entertianment, but when they are based on real people, we should get those real events, not fake ones.I am not sure is all scenes on this DVD are what aired as you don't watch something in TV and expect an edited version on DVD, but it would have bee nice to show that they had a TV show and to talk about ALBUMS that were relased as opposed to singles.  While long, the scope of the film could have been better.  They showed many shows that they did, but I did not get the sense that they played in large arenas or just how large and popular they were.  TV show appearances (not just people watching them on TV), magazines, papers, people on the street going crazy would have helped with the scope of the groups popularity being realized on film.  If they were Motwon's biggest group, I would love to have seen this being shown in the film.  It was mentioned, but I did not see it.  I know budgets are limited, especially for TV, maybe they could have named something bigger than The Copa?  You know, like where sports teams play at.They focused a little on their reunion, but they did not get into the colabbo with Rick James.  To me, this was key in the 80's.  I remeber when Rick James had ""Superfreak"" and he said ""Temptaions sing!""  I did not know that they were still together!  I also though that it was sampled!  I did not even know that Rick was Melvins' newphew!  It goes to show that the entertainment world is like secret societies.  Only those with insider info can get in.  Those without have to fight to get in.All in all, it was good.  I still cannot believe Ruffin had such and ego.  It may have been entertaining and frustrating to see it in person.  I would also agree that Otis may have been jealous of all of the lead singers and this could be another reason he keeps firing them.  They get popular - he get's rid of them.  The group has continued to have success despite these changes and people will always feel bad that they could not hear more from the ""original five,"" but Eddie and David's solo careers put them in the same position as the Tempts - looking for SONGS.I listened to Eddie's solo stuff and he had some hot beats on his stuff!  David's solo stuff sounded good for his singing, but I guess they hope that his voice alone could make hits.  The Tempts did not become big out the gate because they were always dependent upon someone else writing them a hit.  They were more performers than artists.  Artists create and performers perform other's creations!  So clearly these guys did not know what makes a hit or how to write a hit.  They had to keep seeking out hits from others.  I know some will say Gordy had control, but the singer should know if something sounds like a hit or not.This is a good film.  If there are any deledted footage, put it on the Blu-Ray version and wide-screen it!  I know since it was filmed on film, it should have had some type of letter boxing.  With the length of this DVD, compression artifacts are seen - especially on HDTV's with upconversion on the player.  Re-relase a Blu-Ray extravaganza with ALL know footage of the real performances during the era of the film and any and all deleted scenes.  I would buy it in a - ""heartbeat!""",4,Good story.

Yes with all of those old Paul Muni movies like the Life of Emil Zola, and recent ones like the Piano.  I wonder if this was a theatrical release would it had gotten its due respect?I believe every one in the movie was good.  But LEON has got to have a special mention.  His is one of the best performances I have seen of a real life person on the screen. He is just as good if not better then Laurence Fishburn as Ike Turner or Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison or Ralph Bellamy as FDR  And once again if this movie had been slimmed down a little and made a theatrical release I wonder if Leon would have gotten a nomination from the Academy.This was originally a 2 part movie but is always shown in it's entirety on VH-1. I also have it on DVD.  Take a look and you will witness a made for TV that will rival any big screen biop with a performance from Leon that is a revelation. I have seen this actor in bad movies but I have never seen him  put on a bad performance. He was in  another good movie the Five Heartbeats in a similer role and he was a show stopper.

The Temptations were one of Motowns hottest and most versatile acts with their carefully planned chorography on stage and their diverse ranmge of shimmering harmonies on record. An interesting aspect of the series early sequences are when they are first introduced to Motown Records and its fun to see portrayals of the great Motown legends such as  Diana Ross, Martha Reeves, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson. Interestingly enough Diana Ross' daughter, Rhonda Ross makes an apperance in the film playing the troubled Paul Williams wife. The sequences where the group are seen performing Papa Was A Rolling Stone and Paul Williams is about to shoot himself are moving and the funeral is sure to get a lump in your throat (where Smokey Robinson himself appears). The film also carefully chronicles David Ruffins fall from grace as he steadily declined into cocaine addiction andalso continually mentally and physically tortued his wife, Tammi Terrell. The ending sees the grop reunirted when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.The performances are excellent, the 60's ambience such as the nightclubs and drug culture are superbly evoked and the stage performances are mastered to perfection.

I had heard all of their most popular songs, but I was never a fan...until the movie. I don't even remember how I was first introduced to the movie; only that the reruns were always shown on Vh-1 and Vh-1 Classic.No matter how many times I watch the film, I'm still surprised by how good it is. The music, the acting, the script; it's all top-notch. I'm also impressed that all of the actors, with the exception of Leon did their own singing. These are talented guys. I especially love Christian Payton as Paul. Unfortunately, I haven't seen him or most of them in anything else since, which makes me angry when I think about the fact rappers are hired predominately to play black characters in film. Which makes me wonder why Brad Pitt will never fear losing his job to Axl Rose, but Leon will always have to fear losing his job to Snoop Dogg: another debate for another day.A lot of folk have issues with the creative license the writers and producers took with the movie. Because I wasn't aware of the Temptations history (and to a large degree, still don't) until after I saw the film, I really have no problem with it. All movies change things. That's the nature of the celluloid beast. However, there is one omission they make that I feel would have better helped the viewer understand the story: the fact Paul had sickle-cell anemia. Why omit this? This would make it clear it wasn't just his drinking that ended his career. Also, the movie should have used more ambiguity regarding Paul's death considering the real events were so suspicious.I also don't like the claim that because the movie is based on Otis William's viewpoint, that he somehow exaggerated the shortcomings of the other members and embellished his own virtues.For the record, Melvin comes out as being the most well-behaved member in the movie, not Otis. And secondly, has anyone stopped to ponder that maybe Otis WAS better behaved and less inclined to indulge in vices than the other members? There is a reason why he's still alive in 2007 while the other members are dead. He must have been doing something right in regards to lifestyle. Third, the movie makes it clear not only is he an adulterer but also two-faced. So how does he come off as an angel? Fourth, the movie is not a play by play on Otis William's book, and he did not have creative control over the movie.Bottom Line: a great, great film I could watch over and over (which is why I bought the dvd).",5,Temptations forever; or until you're replaced.,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,2598,"['say', 'movie', 'started', 'movie', 'started', 'fascination', 'Temptations.Of', 'course', 'knew', 'who', 'Temps', 'were', 'had', 'heard', 'most', 'popular', 'songs', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'how', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'movie', 'only', 'reruns', 'were', 'always', 'shown', 'Vh-1', 'Vh-1', 'Classic.No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'music', 'acting', 'script', 'top-notch', ""'m"", 'also', 'impressed', 'actors', 'exception', 'Leon', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'are', 'talented', 'guys', 'especially', 'love', 'Christian', 'Payton', 'Paul', 'Unfortunately', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'angry', 'when', 'think', 'fact', 'rappers', 'are', 'hired', 'predominately', 'play', 'black', 'characters', 'film', 'Which', 'wonder', 'why', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'will', 'never', 'fear', 'losing', 'job', 'Axl', 'Rose', 'Leon', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'fear', 'losing', 'job', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'debate', 'day.A', 'lot', 'folk', 'have', 'issues', 'creative', 'license', 'writers', 'producers', 'took', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Temptations', 'history', 'large', 'degree', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'saw', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'movies', 'change', 'things', 'nature', 'celluloid', 'beast', 'However', 'one', 'omission', 'make', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'helped', 'viewer', 'understand', 'story', 'fact', 'Paul', 'had', 'sickle-cell', 'anemia', 'Why', 'omit', 'would', 'make', 'clear', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'drinking', 'ended', 'career', 'Also', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'ambiguity', 'regarding', 'Paul', 'death', 'considering', 'real', 'events', 'were', 'so', 'suspicious.I', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'claim', 'movie', 'based', 'Otis', 'William', 'viewpoint', 'somehow', 'exaggerated', 'shortcomings', 'other', 'members', 'embellished', 'own', 'virtues.For', 'record', 'Melvin', 'out', 'being', 'most', 'well-behaved', 'member', 'movie', 'not', 'Otis', 'secondly', 'anyone', 'stopped', 'ponder', 'maybe', 'Otis', 'WAS', 'better', 'behaved', 'less', 'inclined', 'indulge', 'vices', 'other', 'members', 'reason', 'why', 'still', 'alive', '2007', 'other', 'members', 'are', 'dead', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'regards', 'lifestyle', 'Third', 'movie', 'clear', 'not', 'only', 'adulterer', 'also', 'two-faced', 'how', 'come', 'off', 'angel', 'Fourth', 'movie', 'not', 'play', 'play', 'Otis', 'William', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'creative', 'control', 'movie.Bottom', 'Line', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'watch', 'why', 'bought', 'dvd']",The Temptations VHS

Sadly, it contains more profanity and drug related scenes but includes dialog that fills out the story. The woman in the crack house differs from VHS to DVD. Additionally, the DVD songs appear to have intentional distortion (volume decreases and increases intermittently) perhaps to protect over a dozen digital music recordings from audio duplication. The DVD also credits the actor portraying David Ruffin with his first and last name whereas the VHS credits him as ""Leon.""Remastering of the live songs (on the VHS) is better than the originals I later purchased on CD.

The time will zoom by, as this is an engaging, well-acted production about one of Motown's earliest successes, ""The Temptations"".  The story of this group is told primarily through the eyes of Otis Williams, one of its founding fathers and the true linchpin of the group, as well as its last surviving member. The film details the group's struggle for success from its down and out early days to the pinnacle of success and its eventual induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.The songs that propelled  ""The Temptations"" to stardom are capably lip-synched by its talented cast. The viewer sees the beginning of the group in the nineteen fifties and its subsequent rise to fame and fortune. After being signed up by Motown, the future of ""The Temptations""  was almost assured, given the resources that Motown's music mogul, Barry Gordy,  allotted to their development. Once they were a success, crossover was inevitable for such a talented group, and ""The Temptations"" became a huge hit in mainstream America.The film details the personal highs and lows of the individual members of the group. Alcoholism, drug use, egotism, and other personal travails would plague its members and, consequently, the group. At times, the group would appear to be on the verge of a total split, especially when its cocaine craving, lead singer, David Ruffin,  began making ego fueled demands. Still, the temptations endured, because no one member was bigger than the group. They began as a group, and it is the group that would endure. Though individual members would come and go, the group itself always remained  ""The Temptations"".This is an excellent bio pic with great music.

Based on the memoirs of founding member Otis Williams, it tells the story of how the Temptations came to be.  The whole undertaking is done with such love, dedication, and devotion, that you cannot help but be swept away in this story of the rise to fame and fortune of a group of dreaming black kids from Detroit.You get to see what it was really like behind the scenes of Motown, how Berry Gordy ran his breakthrough, genius, music revolution at Hitsville, U.S.A.  You see that some things have changed about the music industry, and some things remain the same.  For example, today record labels will dump someone after one failing album.  Gordy supported the Tempations for two years before they had a hit.  He had faith in them, faith that you just no longer see today in a music industry based on profits and greed.  And something that remains the same is that there are still unscrupulous promoters out there who will take advantage of a young and naiive group.  Also, touring on the road is still a big strain on marriages of the performers.  The  movie has as much heartbreak in it as it does joy.Everything about The Temptations is sublime.  The singing will make you get up and dance.  Every song is performed in its entirety.  The times are portrayed so well, from the segregated 50's all the way up to the 1990's.  Everything is changed to match each passing decade: the hair, the clothes, the lighting, the music, even the filmography.  Featuring the real Smokey Robinson as himself, this film is not to be missed by anyone who loves the Motown classics.

458938,A13Q6DZC1WZ9K6,6305300887,LoVe2ReAd,"[12, 15]","Let me just say that I love the Temptin' Temptations.  I am 19 years old, but my parents are old enough to remember the good old days...so they were my exposure.  The Tempts I would have loved to see are no longer here (RIP Eddie J. Kendrick, Paul Williams, and David Ruffin).  So I have relied on videos, books, etc.This movie is a good place to start.  The music is great, for one.  Kudos to Terron Brooks, Christian Payton, for not only their portrayals of Eddie and Paul, but for being able to sing their own parts!! Excellent!!  And what can I say about Leon?  He really put on a show as Ruff!!!  KUDOS!!My only gripes w/this film were the inaccuracies.  I know for brevity's sake, you can't include all.  But, the way I see it, if you can find the time to make something up, surely you can find the time to include truth.  The scene where Al got put out of the group:  history remembers that scene happening differently.  I feel the movie should not have switched it.  If you research after watching the film, you will see that the situation would have ended the same way in history that they made it happen in the movie.  Al would have still hit Paul w/the bottle and would have been thrown out of the group.  It made Al seem lazy ( I don't know, maybe he was).  But on that particular day, it was Paul.  I also have to wonder why Otis' vices were not as known in the movie as others.  We saw Al drunk once, Paul's alcoholism and ""suicide"", David's drug problem, they didn't do Eddie right at all, but all we saw of Otis' was him getting off of the bus w/the Flo Ballard character.  He and Josephine never flat out had a discussion about it.  His vice was women, so why weren't we privy to that?  You would have thought he was the Pope after watching the movie.I'm starting to realize that I like it more for the music than anything else. Of course, when I saw it the first time, I felt it was biased, but after some research, watching videos, reading, listening, etc., I am becoming more and more perturbed by it. I know you're not supposed to take everything w/a grain of salt, but come on! Geez!!A few things that angered me was(1)The scene at Ruff's apt: let's be real. Maybe DR had developed a bit of an ego trip, but let's not make it seem so completely unreasonable to why he would wonder why the group's name wouldn't change. I'm NOT saying I agreed with him, but can you really fault him for wondering or for assuming? A certain diva's group got a name change, Smokey and the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, etc. I just don't feel like something like this would make him the Devil Incarnate or a problem needing to be rectified. Or at least not the way it was portrayed. (2)Maybe it's just me, but when ppl subtlely(sp?) make themselves look like Patron Saints, I tend to think they're not. Otis being the one to talk to Gordy, or telling ppl to vote David out, blah, blah, blah...sorry, but I don't buy it. Otis, the one DESTINED to hold it together.  Please.  Seems to me, he was the only one (w/Melvin in tow) who seemed to want to kiss the rear of Berry. (3)The scene where Ruff comes onstage: now, according to Dennis, Ruff knew he would be the replacement and encouraged him to do it (which also leads me to believe that his dismissal was so overdramatic). Anyway, back to my point, Dennis and David were cool, so I highly doubt that Dennis would have called him an ""M-Fer."" I mean,really, if I caught it, then editing should have caught it. (4)What the HEEZY was up w/the interpretations of the different guys? Who was in charge of telling them how to act? What I mean is, why do they make the fellas seem so wimpy and passive? Mel, throughout the whole movie, seems like either a mama's boy or Otis' right hip. Was he really like that? He just didn't seem to stand on his own. I didn't like that. Same w/Eddie J. Now, many people will tell you that while he was a gentleman and all, he would tell you what he thought. He didn't believe in kissing ***. I'm not saying show Eddie telling all these people where to go, but they didn't have to make him so passive. (5)Now, I know Suzanne DePasse was over this movie, but couldn't she have added a certain realism to the movie and showed what a cutthroat Gordy was? The way they showed BG was too nice and too fake. (6)Now O, were you really there when Ruffin died? I absolutely HATE IT when people interpret what the last days of someone was like. Especially when they probably weren't on the best of terms. It was Dennis and Eddie who were concerned about where Ruffin was and who he was very close to those last years. I could have done w/o him being thrown out of the car. I read somwhere back in '98 that Ruffin's family contested the production of the movie due to the nature of the portrayal. (7)How does the movie manage to fit Paul's death into a seven-minute plus song, David's demise into a series of scenes, Mel's death into a last touching scene w/his mom and best friend...and Eddie's into TWO FREAKIN' SENTENCES??!!! That is so low. Unbelievable even. I just have to ask why? Now some say that b/c Otis probably didn't have much say over the script, but if allegedly, there was forgiveness on both parts at the end of Ed's life, wouldn't it have been good for O to fight for there to be more on Eddie's passing? Two sentences does not cut it. As a matter of fact, if you blink or sneeze, be assured that you WILL miss it.Mama Rose: ""What was it that got Eddie?""  The worst and most inconcievable line in any movie I've seen in a while.  Awful.  It makes me wonder if fences were really mended btwn EJK and O like he says in his updated chapter.What it boils down to is my thinking that if they were using O's book, he would have more say, or at least fight for more, in what came across the screen. I would have liked to have seen more good times btwn the guys...more scenes like the New Year's dinner scene. Show us how they bonded outside of the music. The Motown cookout doesn't count. These guys didn't get so close just talking about music and riding on tour buses, etc.I just feel like more positivity or more truth, could have been injected in the scenes. I mean, are ratings really EVERYTHING?But it is good for the music and things like that.  It's fun seeing and figuring out who the other actors are supposed to be.  They did, however, accurately make the Martha Reeves character a secretary.Oh, btw, I really don't recommend the VHS version UNLESS you order it from NBC.  The video cuts out enough scenes to make you mad.  Spring for the DVD.

I wasn't even aware that parts of the film were cut out when it was released on video; quite a few people mentioned that they didn't get the movie in its entirety when they ordered their copies of the VHS. I was one of the fortunate ones who had the entire miniseries in tact. Needless to say, many people who unknowingly brought the edited VHS were disappointed.But on DVD, the entire movie is included, with a few extra treats as well. I already reviewed this movie anonymously here on Amazon about two years ago, so I don't see the need to review it again. I will just say it's a very good biopic  - even though much about this is fictionalized and very biased, because you only get only one side of the Temptations' story - Otis'.
