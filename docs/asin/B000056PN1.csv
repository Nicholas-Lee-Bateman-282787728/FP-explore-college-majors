There is a reason why they chose this film to be a part of their mocking library.  This ""horror"" film lacks in every critical category.  It has shabby characters, very minimal visuals, sheep dogs in shrew costumes, and quite a bit of liquor consumption, while all the time never developing anything known as a ""plot"".  The basis behind this film is simple, honestly, too simple.  A random, uncharted island inhabited by a scientific experiment gone wrong.  There are only six ""survivors"" who were all doing fine until Rosco P. Coltrane (aka James Best) arrived to the scene.  It is after he arrives that liquor seems to be highly consumed, nerves never seemed to be unraveled, and more and more about these shrews are revealed.  Nearly halfway through this film I thought that Henson might have been involved somehow with the creation of these shrews.  There is even one scene in which there is a shrew hiding under the stairs, waiting for his prey, and you cannot help but feel a sense of admiration for the beast.  It is rather cute, in a costumed dog sort of way.This is one of the first films where you can watch the entire story unfold and feel nothing for these characters.  Director Ray Kellogg was either still writing the script as he was shooting or was hoping to use the phrase, ""It's my first time directing"" for this silly excuse of a film.  It is neither scary nor thrilling in any way.  To begin, the visuals are horrendous.  Between the overused stock footage of a saber-toothed shrew peeking in through the wooden fence and the only ONE interior shot used in the film, it was bound to make any sane viewer go a bit bonkers.  I realize that Kellogg may have been trying to build the idea of entrapment or claustrophobia for his characters, but this sensation could never have been created with this cast.  It became obvious to me early in this film that drinking was just as important as knowing your lines.  In fact, if you didn't know your lines and chose to drink, director Kellogg would have considered it a strong move on the part of the actor.  The Killer Shrews is not a film for recovering alcoholics.  I saw this film as a perfect outlet for college students and their overabundance of drinking games.The theories behind the creation of the shrews are classic ""B"" cinema.  As I watched this horrendous film, I could not help but think of Romero's Night of the Living Dead.  Did he see this film before creating his masterpiece?  I know several have mentioned it in their reviews, but one cannot help but see the similarities.  People cramped in a small space trying to survive while evil creatures of the night are pounding down the door.  One cannot help but think that the Killer Shrews may have been on Romero's mind in the late 1960s.Let's see if I have covered all the points.  Horrible acting.  Nobody actually has a character in this film.  We learn nothing about anyone and feel nothing as they attempt to save their own lives from the killer shrews.  There was one point in the film where Ann asks Thorne if he doesn't wonder about everything and want to ask questions.  She asks him if he doesn't want to know about her accent.  Suddenly, I was whisked away to a Lost memory and was waiting for all six of these character's lives to suddenly be molded together in a rather shocking way, but alas, that did not happen.  The creatures were creative, but definitely not scary, even for the late 1950s.  The shrew under the stairs reminded me, to quote Mystery Science Theater 3000, like a puppet.  It made me laugh, which is your typical viewer's reaction to this type of cinema today.  This was not a Ed Wood production in any way.  This was far worse.  Acting was not necessary to be in this film.  If there would have been any range of emotion emitted from anyone in this film than I may have graded it higher than I did, but alas, there was none.  No chemistry between the characters, no drive, no excitement, just pure alcoholism.  Finally, there was the climactic ending that flies by faster than the beginning of the film.  If the ending had been more intense, a bit spookier, and maybe even at night, than I think we would have had a stronger contender as a great film.  Sadly, the ending looked exactly like the rest of the film, cheap and subdued.Overall, I don't think I could watch this film again unless I had my old MST3K buddies with me to enjoy it.  There was nothing of redeeming value in this film unless you count the action that the liquor bottles saw, then one would grade it higher.  The shrews were laughable, the tension was non-existent, and the science of the film was never fully developed.  There were so many avenues that Kellogg could have traveled to make this into a ""cult"" phenomenon, but instead he stuck with less than mediocrity and the result is this black and white film that puts a horrid stain on the ""horror"" genre.  Instead, why don't you make a ""Killer Shrew"" drink and call it a night, the results would be better!Grade: ** out of ***** (extra star for the MST3K memories)",2,"They don't leave much, do

The 1959 THE KILLER SHREWS is a bit of both, at time excruciatingly funny, at times, well, just plain excruciating.The story, such as it is, concerns a the captain of a small supply ship (James Best) who finds himself stranded on an island with a few nutty scientists, a blonde bombshell, and a bunch of dogs dressed up like killer shrews.  They're all hankering to get away, of course, but wouldn't you know it, there's a hurricane a-blowing.  While they wait for the weather to settle they drink a lot and worry about the dogs, er, shrews, which are trying to gnawn their way inside for lunch.It's hard to say what is more abominable about this film: the story, the script, or the human cast.  On the other hand, the costumed canine cast is actually quite a bit of fun.  Love those tails in particular!  Even so, I still found the sixty-nine minutes of this film rough going.

No, they were not supposed to eat the world's surplus people. You'll have to watch this epic to discover their true purpose. Warning, watching this terrible film can be contagious and habit forming.

The only question is why did ""MST3K"" wait until season four to take on this one? This one has to be on my list of top ten bad monster movies. Thorne Sherman (James Best) delivers supplies to an island just as a hurricane is coming. He wants to wait out the story, but Dr. Milo Craigis (Baruch Lumet) wants Thorne to leave right away and take his daughter Ann (Ingrid Goude, Miss Sweden 1956 and then Miss Universe 1957), with him. The Doctor sounds German while his daughter has a very interesting Swedish accent, but that is not the biggest mystery on the island.Dr. Craigis is concerned with over population and apparently his idea is was to shrink people to make food go farther. To this end he experiments with the DNA of shrews who (a) grow to the size of dogs wearing shag carpeting, (b) have all of their worst traits becoming dominant, and (c) develop poison saliva. You would think that any one of those three could cause problems when there are 300 shrews running around on an island, but no, all three happen. The number of humans starts dwindling as the shrews need desert after eating all of the livestock on the island, so everybody starts drinking more (think about it: do you really want DRUNK giant vicious shrews with poison saliva?). Jerry Farrell (Ken Curtis) decides that Ann sparking to Thorne is worse than having giant shrews attacking them, but soon sees the error of his ways and decides that going up on the roof would be a good idea. That is also because he thinks that the idea that Thorne comes up with to escape to the boat is stupid, but I have to say, in terms of 1950s black & white monster movies this plan actually makes sense.Special mention must be made of Gordon McLendon who plays Dr. Radford Baines, the dedicated assistant to Dr. Craigis and who remains the consummate scientist even once he has been bitten. His death sets up what is probably the funniest line of the movie until we get to the end where the last exchange of dialogue provides a pretty funny punch line to the entire experience of pure terror trying to get away from the giant vicious shrews with poison saliva. There is just too much to enjoy in this movie, from listening to Goude's accent (you know it has to be Swedish but it does not sound Swedish and trying to figure out what it does sound like will drive you crazy), to watching the dogs covered in carpet frolick around the silly humans rolling on the ground, and waiting for one of the teeth on the rubber shrew heads to get caught on something and break off.

570556,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000056PN1,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 4]","I guess after all the other things that attacked in the 1950's and 60's, film makers were running out of creatures.  Shrews are among the smallest of mammals and require huge amounts of food to survive.  I guess someone thought that if you made shrews really big, about the size of a coon dog (which played the killer shrews after the addition of a fur coat), you would have giant, voracious shrews.  Ignoring the biological unlikelihood of giant shrews existing and still maintaining their appetite, this movie is a reasonably good movie in the ""attack of"" genre.  The shrews are mostly menacing - except in close-ups or when they are shot, and then they look like a stuffed animal.The theory behind the killer shrews is that a group of scientists were performing experiments on an island somewhere in the remote north.  Some of their experiments escaped and quickly ate their way through the local fauna.  Lacking sustenance, the shrews decided that people were suitable food alternatives and began seeking ways of entering the laboratory compound.Thorne Sherman (James Best, best known for being the sheriff on the television series ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") is a boat captain bringing supplies to the island.  He finds himself in the middle of a love triangle involving Ann Craigis (Ingrid Goude, Miss Universe 1957).  Sherman discovers that he has to defend himself against four-legged shrews and two-legged shrews carrying shotguns.  The rest of the movie involves trying to figure out whether anyone will make it off the island, and who the shrews will kill in the process of getting off the island.This movie is an above average mutated monster film.  The shrews look like dogs when they are chasing their prey, but they look sort of menacing in close-ups.  I also appreciated how the producer and director tried to focus on the monster story rather than the peripheral love story, except to the extent that the shrews were able to take advantage of the arguments between the various characters.  Fans of mutated creature films, ""attack of"" films, and campy horror and science films of the 1950's and 1960's will enjoy this one.Enjoy!",3,Attack of Dogs in Fur Coats!,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,2140,"['guess', 'other', 'things', 'attacked', '1950', '60', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'creatures', 'Shrews', 'are', 'smallest', 'mammals', 'require', 'huge', 'amounts', 'food', 'survive', 'guess', 'someone', 'thought', 'made', 'shrews', 'really', 'big', 'size', 'coon', 'dog', 'played', 'killer', 'shrews', 'addition', 'fur', 'coat', 'would', 'have', 'giant', 'voracious', 'shrews', 'Ignoring', 'biological', 'unlikelihood', 'giant', 'shrews', 'existing', 'still', 'maintaining', 'appetite', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'good', 'movie', 'attack', 'genre', 'shrews', 'are', 'mostly', 'menacing', 'close-ups', 'when', 'are', 'shot', 'then', 'look', 'stuffed', 'animal.The', 'theory', 'killer', 'shrews', 'group', 'scientists', 'were', 'performing', 'experiments', 'island', 'somewhere', 'remote', 'north', 'experiments', 'escaped', 'quickly', 'ate', 'way', 'local', 'fauna', 'Lacking', 'sustenance', 'shrews', 'decided', 'people', 'were', 'suitable', 'food', 'alternatives', 'began', 'seeking', 'ways', 'entering', 'laboratory', 'compound.Thorne', 'Sherman', 'James', 'Best', 'best', 'known', 'being', 'sheriff', 'television', 'series', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'boat', 'captain', 'bringing', 'supplies', 'island', 'middle', 'love', 'triangle', 'involving', 'Ann', 'Craigis', 'Ingrid', 'Goude', 'Miss', 'Universe', '1957', 'Sherman', 'defend', 'four-legged', 'shrews', 'two-legged', 'shrews', 'carrying', 'shotguns', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'anyone', 'will', 'make', 'off', 'island', 'who', 'shrews', 'will', 'kill', 'process', 'getting', 'off', 'island.This', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'mutated', 'monster', 'film', 'shrews', 'look', 'dogs', 'when', 'are', 'chasing', 'prey', 'look', 'sort', 'menacing', 'close-ups', 'also', 'appreciated', 'how', 'producer', 'director', 'tried', 'focus', 'monster', 'story', 'rather', 'peripheral', 'love', 'story', 'extent', 'shrews', 'were', 'able', 'take', 'advantage', 'arguments', 'various', 'characters', 'Fans', 'mutated', 'creature', 'films', 'attack', 'films', 'campy', 'horror', 'science', 'films', '1950', '1960', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one.Enjoy']",N/A

570560,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B000056PN1,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[0, 1]","SUSPENSEFUL, ATTENTION-GRABBING, SCARY, EXCITING....WITH A THRILLING CONCLUSION.  This interesting little horror film, from the 1950s, is called ""The Killer Shrews"" -- and no, it is N_O_T about a group of gossiping, back-biting housewives who hen-peck their husbands, then go on a murder spree.  This movie is about REAL shrews -- animals -- who grow from the normal size of large hamsters, to the nightmarish size of your average medium-sized dog!  It all has to do with a scientist, who experimented with the shrews in their natural state...unaware that a the effects of an unexpected hurricane would make them grow.  (Why, I'm not sure....I came in at the mid-point of this movie.)  On this island are the scientist, his daughter, a few stalwart WASP males, a stereotyped Mexican -- and the MOST stalwart WASP male of all -- James Best, (of all people), known to many for his two 'Twilight Zone' episodes.It's interesting to me that ""the girl"" in this movie, (all horror movies have to have at least one ""girl"" in them -- both to titilate the males in the audience, and also, (perhaps?), to have a character with whom the females in the audience can relate.  The interesting  thing about the ""girl"" (the scientist's daughter), in this movie to me was that she goes through three costume changes throughout this movie.  She arrives wearing a pert suit and high heels -- perfect attire for working in a New York City office building....but what the heck is she doing wearing these things in the middle of nowhere, on Shrew Island?  Later, she changes her clothes into something a bit more ""sensible"" -- a peasant-type blouse, a wide skirt -- and what looks to be a colourful, striped apron, although there are no ties visible, and this might just be a strange part of her skirt.  Still later on in the film, she wears flat shoes, a blouse, and a pair of slacks.  It's almost as if the producers of the film wanted to establish her femininity by her first wearing two skirts of various types, before putting her in more mundane, (and less feminine?) pants.  (The producers couldn't just look at her face, and realize she knockout-gorgous whatever she wears...?)Everyone in this movie acts credibly, and very believably.  There is none of the self-mockery found in some later horror flicks.  To me, this is all to the good -- taking the situation of being in danger of being eaten alive is thing to take seriously, if the audience is to become involved, as well.After having most of the people on the island done in by the killer shrews, (and those remaining, having some close encounters), an ingenuis way is found for the remaining characters to get off the island without (too much), danger.  Even here, we can't be certain the plan will work -- for our heroine, (being a ""frail female""), gets tired at just the wrong moment.  (Yet, the character is played so well, that the audience members -- at least, THIS audience member -- realized she got tired, not because she was female, but just because she, as an individual, got tired.  Another woman might have been stronger....)All in all, (except for the stereotyped Mexican), this is a pretty good little movie. Realistic and engrossing, played out seriously,so one cares about what happens to these people.  It's a very scary situation, faced head-on by some very brave people.  Maybe....just maybe....there's a lesson here -- in that, facing a scary, dangerous situation, head on, bravely, might even be a good idea now!  Like -- facing our present ""shrewish"" recession, and the predicted ""sharp jaws"" of 2012?  See it for enjoyment, or see it for encouragement.  No blood to speak of, and no foul language.  Just suspence and character development.

A small group of people stranded on a tropical island (where there is a lab conducting suspiciously silly experiments with Shrews) because of a Hurricane must fend off marauding gigantic Shrews.  Just that basic idea, to say nothing of the title, are enough to start giggles.I particularly liked the fact that although there was a horrible hurricane, one can scarcely sees the trees blowing in the wind or detect any bobbing of the small boat in the bay.  I guess we just have to take their word for it.  Perhaps it was a Category ""Negative 5"" hurricane.The movie mostly consists of ridiculously stilted dialogue, much of it with the characters crowded around a very flimsy looking bar.  We don't see much of the scientific facilities.  Guess all these guys like to do is drink. Our hero makes eyes at the heroine, the daughter of the scientist, and she responds with incredible blankness.  Frankly, the acting is barely noticeable.  No one really manages a single believable moment.  The reason PLAN NINE or ROBOT MONSTER are such hoots is because the ""acting"" is insanely unpredictable and laughable.  Everyone in those films is fully committed to their ""art""...they just don't have any actual skills.  In SHREWS, I was tempted to skip ahead frequently...hoping for some KILLER SHREWS.When they come...dogs in furry costumes...they are laughable and not terribly scary looking.  Yes, I'm sure they could deliver a nasty bite, but they also look like a quick kick to the head would kill them. Lucky for the shrews, no one on the island is capable of even aiming a gun, much less hitting a shrew.  The characters are constantly firing guns that are obviously directed no where near the villians.It has its moments of camp, and its short, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend the movie for the bad-movie buff.

It is standard black and white drive-in silliness about scientists on a remote island who have created 'giant killer shrews' that have more than a passing resemblance to collies with bad toupees. This movies stars James Best and Ken Curtis (you've seen them in westerns, including 'Gunsmoke') as well as Ingrid Goude (Miss Universe Sweden 1956) as the daughter of the principal nutty scientist of the Shrew Island Nature Preserve.Shrews are the smallest of the insectivores, and world wide there are approximately 314 species, of which 'Giant Killer Shrew' is not one. All shrews have short legs, and a long snout. They also have beady little eyes and are primarily insectivores. Shrews are voracious eaters and are easily prone to starvation, so at least in this one area the movie has it right: in the words of Captain Thorne Sherman (James Best) &quot;it looks like a small rat, and smells like a skunk.&quot; I couldn't have said it better. Enough of the biology lesson, back to the film...In this film Captain Sherman and his unlucky sidekick find Shrew Island while hiding out from a hurricane. They are convinced to stay by the sultry Ingrid Goude, who speaks mysteriously with a Swedish accent despite her father evidently being a Texan. Once nightfall arrives everyone is trapped in the compound as the 300 killer shrews try to get in. Somehow the hurricane affects them, and they are starving, too, so pandemonium breaks out. (The science of the movie is a bit hazy about all this.) Turns out that the shrews in question have deadly poisonous saliva, so even a scratch from a shrew tooth is fatal! They also can dig through walls, scale fences, climb trees, open doors, steal shoes, and do algebra. OK, they can't do algebra, but they can do amazing things to get at their captive audience. The survivors eventually construct a 'tank' of 55 gallon drums and wade to the boat unperturbed once in the water, because this species of shrew (unlike the other 314) can't swim. Lucky for them!This is a great film of the genre. It is quick (69 minutes) and fun from start to finish. It was once riffed by the MST3K folks, but I have not seen that version in quite some time, though I recall it being a fun episode.

Captain Thorne Sherman and his first mate, &quot;Rook&quot; Griswold, must dock at an island to drop off supplies, but also to avoid being caught in a hurricane.  Once there, they find a small team of scientists working on a secret project, only they can't figure out what.  As night falls, the team insists they don't leave.  It is revealed that there are 300 starving, killer shrews loose on the island.  The result of a scientific experiment gone bad, the shrews must eat three times their body weight everyday.  Will the team survive?  Find out for yourself.  The shrews are just dogs in hairy costumes with huge fangs.  The close-ups of the &quot;shrews&quot; are even worse.  Even with this ridiculously low budget, The Killer Shrews is still a lot of fun.  I would categorize this movie as one of those that is so bad, it is good.James Best of Dukes of Hazard fame plays Captain Thorne Sherman who mishaps upon Shrew Island.  Former Miss Universe Ingrid Goude is Ann Craigs, a scientist's daughter who falls for Cpt. Thorne.  Ken Curtis stars as the cowardly Jerry, who will do anything to save his own hide.  Baruch Lumet plays Dr. Milo Craigis, the leader of the scientists.  The movie also stars Gordon McClendon as Dr. Baines, Alfredo DeSoto as Mario, and Judge Henry Dupree as &quot;Rook&quot; Griswold.

These scenes are then punctuated by panic as the characters are preyed upon by small dogs dressed up as ""killer shrews."" It is hysterically funny all on it's own.
