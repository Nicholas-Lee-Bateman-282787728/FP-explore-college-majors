593195,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00005JKZK,A. Burchfield,"[0, 0]","I'm not so harsh a reviewer as some have been on this movie, I thought it was a fun way to spend 90 minutes. The plot concerns a research project headed by a government agent (Michael Biehn)that is supposed to develop a means of altering time. The concept , to speed time up so that an agent can do a mission undetected, works but has a drawback in that using it too much speeds up the aging process. Because of this drawback Biehn's projcet will be shut down  unless he can find a solution. The kids get into it when the boy discovers that a watch his father had (sent to him by the other scientist)isn't actually a watch at all but a device that appears to freeze time except for the wearer or someone in contact with them. The viewer is 'treated' to a long run of scenes in which the boy and girl have fun with the device, these are mostly very well done. I can't remember how far you actually get though the movie before the kids come into contact with the first scientist from the project but they soon are drawn into rescuing the boys father(an associate of the first scientist, he was kidnapped to do what the other man could not)and defeating the evil Govt. agent and his crew. The plot is very thin but fun to watch, much better suited to young teens than their parents.",3,"fun movie, especially for younger teenagers",1033862400,"10 6, 2002",2002,1279,"[""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'harsh', 'reviewer', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'plot', 'research', 'project', 'headed', 'government', 'agent', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'supposed', 'develop', 'means', 'altering', 'time', 'concept', 'speed', 'time', 'up', 'so', 'agent', 'can', 'do', 'mission', 'undetected', 'works', 'drawback', 'using', 'too', 'much', 'speeds', 'up', 'aging', 'process', 'drawback', 'Biehn', 'projcet', 'will', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'can', 'find', 'solution', 'kids', 'get', 'when', 'boy', 'watch', 'father', 'had', 'sent', 'other', 'scientist', ""n't"", 'actually', 'watch', 'device', 'freeze', 'time', 'wearer', 'someone', 'contact', 'viewer', ""'treated"", 'long', 'run', 'scenes', 'boy', 'girl', 'have', 'fun', 'device', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'far', 'actually', 'get', 'movie', 'kids', 'come', 'contact', 'first', 'scientist', 'project', 'soon', 'are', 'drawn', 'rescuing', 'boys', 'father', 'associate', 'first', 'scientist', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'man', 'could', 'not', 'defeating', 'evil', 'Govt', 'agent', 'crew', 'plot', 'very', 'thin', 'fun', 'watch', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'young', 'teens', 'parents']",N/A
593196,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKZK,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 1]","It could be the handful of hours rest that I am currently working on or the pathetic excuses for film that I am currently enjoying, but ""Clockstoppers"" didn't anger me or make me smile.  This was a near-perfect example of a film that played it safe, worked with the teen audience, and boasted special effects that honestly, were appealing to the eye.  ""Clockstoppers"" won't win you awards at the company Trivia Night, nor will it impress your co-worker's mind at the water cooler the next morning, but it doesn't make you go into a fit of rage either.  The script is loose at best, the acting fits well into the predestined can of clich&eacute;, but it is the special effects that really make you sit and watch this film from beginning to end without fits of rage.  This may be surprising to my loyal readers, but I could not willingly sit here and bash a film that honestly engaged my inner boredom as much as this film did.  ""Clockstoppers"" was a film dedicated to hitting the median, not going above or below, and wildly succeeded.""Clockstoppers"" is one of those simple PG plots which involves a boy, a watch, and no need to corrupt the system.  A kid, unlike you or I, finds a watch from his super-genius father that can literally slow down time (actually, speed up his molecules so that time seems to be going slower).  Instead of stay in that time forever, growing old and experiencing the powers of ""invisibility"", he uses it to win over the heart of an unknown girl and stop the world from catapulting into utter annihilation.  Yep, something I would do if I could stop time.  Like any other film of this nature, I am sure you know what ultimately happens in the end.  Helmed by ""Star Trek's"" very own Jonathan Frakes, ""Clockstoppers"" boasts the talents of Jesse Bradford, Michael Biehn, and French Stewart - with a cast like this, who needs enemies.  Using amazing CGI to bring this story from the page, where Frakes falls short are the characters and his inability to grapple with the technology he is filming.  I am not going to cover my issues with the molecular speed-up, because I am sure they have been nauseatingly been said before, but they did force you to consider the unmentioned possibilities.  Why wasn't this whole film done with slowed time?  How could some inanimate objects fly through the air in slow time, while others fit into the pattern of going slow?  Why didn't Bradford fall through the floor?  Age issues - don't make me go there!  Again, this could be a whole topic of conversation, but instead, lets talk about the other pivotal downfalls of this film, and how they related to me feeling decent after watching this.I must admit, Frakes does a decent job behind the camera.  He has learned from his acting lessons and can tell a complete story.  Without the science fiction plot holes, the story itself for ""Clockstoppers"" was pretty clich&eacute;, yet straight forward.  He didn't try to overdo it, while his actors might have attempted to gobble every line they could, Frakes kept the story simple and the CGI impressive.  I have to applaud him for his work here, he could have made this a very dark story, but instead kept it suitable for a teen audience.  This wasn't the original ""Agent Cody Banks"" in any way, but it did attempt to stand on its own, and I must applaud Frakes for his attempt.  The acting, as mentioned before, was horrid.  French Stewart was possibly at the lowest point of his career with this film.  His attempt to be a honest scientist was goofy at best.  He was never mad, just loony with his approach to this character.  Jesse Bradford was middle of the road.  Consistent with the standards of this film, he never went above where we wanted him to be.  Oddly, his Ebay selling reminded me of another character from ""Transformers"", but I don't want to think the two films plagiarized.  Julia Sweeny, well, just don't make me go down that tunnel.  Paula Garces was middle of the road as well, she played off Bradford with ease because there was nothing they needed to attach themselves to.  Could I be any more vague?  When I finished watching this movie, I wasn't feeling upset or happy about the results - this was a mediocre film, and I can applaud it for staying within that genre.Sometimes I listen to music half my age - this film is a prime example of music that is half my age.  There was an attempt to take it even further up the tween channel by employing the music of Blink 182 to heavily dominate the scenes of joy, empowerment, or victory.  There was the overuse of Smash Mouth, which seems to plague every tween movie today - but oddly, that was allowed this time.  Typically, I find myself yelling about how one-sided these releases tend to be.  Focusing their marking towards a singular audience instead of just pushing the boundaries, but with ""Clockstoppers"" I felt their average outing calmed me.  It worked  I shouldn't have worked, but it did.  Frakes subdued me, and I cannot argue with him.  The special features surrounding this film were pathetic as well, staged ""behind the scenes"" which only showed how ""fun"" a film like this could be - it was disgusting.  The music videos didn't fit, and the Saturday Morning interruptions also included were vile as well.  See this language, yet I am going to give this film at least three stars.  See, Frakes did dupe me.Overall, I gotta stop this review before I stick myself in a deeper hole.  Agents with no names, bad villains bent on total domination using everything in their arsenal outside of the weapon of choice, a cool watch that may have sold well over the holidays, and plot holes the size of Miami.  I hate these features on a film, but again, ""Clockstoppers"" filled a hour and a half of couch time well for me.  I never laughed, but I never got bored with this story.  Call me a quitter or a lacky to the cause, but ""Clockstoppers"" never came out of its shell, and I am happy for that.  It was pathetic, but delightful in the same sense.  I cannot suggest this movie to friends, but if it rained one afternoon and we needed something to kill the time - I think ""Clockstoppers"" would find its way back to the DVD player!  Thank Frakes - you duped me again!Grade: *** out of *****",3,Frakes -- did you just dupe me?,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,6219,"['could', 'be', 'handful', 'hours', 'rest', 'am', 'currently',

Sure, I've fantasized about having the ability to stop time, but as far as moving things around?  I've imagined of doing a whole lot more than just moving things around...but my own, perverse fantasies are probably not appropriate for posting on this particular product page (this film was produced by Nickelodeon, that network for kids...does anyone remember that show You Can't Do That on Television?  Just wondering...).  Directed by Jonathan Frakes (Star Trek: Nemesis), the film stars Jesse Bradford (Swimfan) and the very edible Paula Garc&eacute;s (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle).  Also appearing is Michael Biehn (The Terminator, The Abyss), winner of the Whoopi Goldberg look-a-like contest Garikayi Mutambirwa (Jeepers Creepers II), Robin Thomas (he was the nerdy principal in the 1987 film Summer School), Julia Sweeney (It's Pat), and the French `I need a better manager' Stewart (Home Alone 4, Inspector Gadget 2).The film begins with a cool looking sequence that ends in such a way that makes no sense, that is until you get further into the story, and by then you'll have probably forgotten all about it, unless you are writing a review, and trying to remember how the film started, like me...does that make sense?  Probably not, but if you see this film, you'll know what I'm talking about...anyway, soon we meet Zak Gibbs (Bradford), a guy I initially confused with that character Xander, played by Nicholas Brendon, from the television series `Buffy the Vampire Slayer'.  He seems like kind of a tool as he rides around on his bike as if he owns the street, and also later for continual pestering his father about wanting to buy, with money he scammed off Ebay buyers by misrepresenting junk, a boss Ford Mustang which he could never afford the insurance on...we learn Zak's father, who's some kind of science genius and teaches at a local university, gets a device from a former student named Earl (Stewart), and is looking for help.  Turns out the device, disguised as a watch, is some kind of accelerated molecular do-hicky that allows the wearer to move at such a speed (called hyper time) that it makes the rest of the world appear as if it were standing still...okay...the problem is, extended usage results in rapid aging of the wearer...also, Earl works for QT Laboratories, which is run by a man named Gates (Biehn), and the project, which was funded for by the gooberment, has now been terminated and Uncle Sam wants everything that has resulted from the research, but Gates is evil, and the potential for such a device so great he's unwilling to give it up.  Zak finds the device, begins using it, but soon finds himself the target of Gates and his goons as they try to retrieve what has been lost, and end up kidnapping Zak's father to take up where Earl left off...now Zak must figure out a way to break into a top secret facility and rescue his father...If anything, this sure was a slick looking film...it had some really nice special effects, during the time standing still parts.  As far as the story, well it just felt like there wasn't a whole lot there, and I wasn't even expecting much.  The film is filled with plot holes, like when Zak was trying to break into the high security facility and finds unbelievably easy access via some incredibly large air vents, but I wasn't really willing to subject the film to harsh scrutiny as it appeared it was mainly a just for fun movie, one you kind of coast through and just enjoy.  I did find the character (or actor) of Zak to be a little annoying, perhaps it had something to do with the ease at which he hooked up with that babe played by Paula Garc&eacute;s.  One aspect I will comment on that I found a little too outlandish was the use of liquid nitrogen (I think) as a weapon to slow down those who are in hyper time.  I gotta think getting sprayed with this would do more than just slow you down, causing extremely severe tissue damage, but I'm no doctor (although I often play one on TV).  I guess if I had to pick the weakest element of the film (the special effects are probably the strongest) it would be the story.  Frakes moved the story along well, and presented things well (I guess directing those various Star Trek eppys paid off), and the actors all seem capable, but they weren't really given much.  Take Biehn's character as the evil Gates...he was hardly even there...when he was, he was decent, but he didn't have the involvement or menacing presence I normally look for in an on screen villain.  I believe Biehn's certainly capable, but his material was lacking.  Stewart provides a few laughs, and his character really gets the beating throughout the film, but he also seems to have so little to work with...personally I would have gotten rid of Zak, his family, and friends (keeping Garc&eacute;s cause she's hotsy), and had Stewart be the main character...perhaps not as it was written, but I thought there was a good deal of extraneous stuff that could have been lost or worked out...but then who would the younger viewers identify with?  So it depends on who the film was marketed to...probably not so much myself...all in all, the movie's fun, but forgettable...oh yeah, I did like most of the music which featured artists like Smash Mouth, Fenix TX, Third Eye Blind, Blink 182, New Found Glory among others....I thought the remakes of songs Abracadabra (2002 Ralph Sall Remix) with Sugar Ray and Time After Time with Uncle Kracker were pretty good...The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture here is sharp, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes through clear.  Special features include a making of featurette, two music videos, promotional spots and a trailer.Cookieman108",3,"""I'm officially freaked out now!""",1114041600,"04 21,

593202,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKZK,D. Litton,"[11, 21]","I guess that, given the fact that a movie like ""Clockstoppers"" is overall aimed at a target audience of people ages 3 and under, that gives me little right to verbally crush every little detail of its ridiculously bad conception. But still, after having been cheated out of almost two hours of my life, I feel a bit compelled to voice my rather strong opinion on just how atrocious and downright bad the film really is.Sure, the special effects are good... for about the first five minutes. Okay, so I should let go of my cynicism and common sense, and just go along for the ride. But the ride is not fun. The movie is not fun. The entire experience is about the equivalent of sitting through a conversation on Einstein's theory of relativity, which (gasp!) finds itself a seat on this hackneyed roller coaster.The film stars Jesse Bradford (""Bring It On"") as Zach, a goof-off teenager who harbors feelings of angst for his father, a science professor who has more time for his job than for his family. The movie supplies him with everything from a token black character as his best friend, a newly-arrived Spanish exchange student played with a lousy accent who becomes his love interest, and a mother and sister who are little more than discards once the movie decides it doesn't need them anymore.I'm telling you, these people are a real trip, and the film's actual plot hasn't even gotten started. Not that it's any better or worse; in fact, I'd put the interest level of this film with that of John McTiernan's remake of ""Rollerball,"" and that's being generous, considering what a mess that movie was.As the story goes, we find out Zach's father has been helping a former student with experiments on a watch that has the ability to transport its wearer into what is called ""hypertime,"" where one's molecular structure moves at a rate faster than that of his/her surroundings. At least the movie does have the good sense to explain that one ages faster while engaged in hypertime, but scientific facts and realistic plot points aren't exactly the film's strong suit.And just when we thought the movie couldn't get any worse, a new subplot comes into play. A crooked scientist played by Michael Biehn wants the watch for his own dark intentions, and kidnaps Zach's father, leaving it up to Zach and his girlfriend, Francesca, to thwart a speechless leather-clad Asian bimbo, a black man supplied with two lines of dialogue throughout the entire movie... are you seeing a pattern here?Director Jonathan Frakes does supply the film with a couple of nifty special effects involving our main characters interacting with their surroundings, which seem frozen in time. But you've seen one slow-motion/fast-motion sequence, and you've seen everything the movie has to offer; that, and Francesca constantly uttering ""Every guy deserves a second chance.""

In fact, I don't even watch any movie whatsoever with high expectations because I know very well that I'll always be disappointed. With that said, ""Clockstoppers"" isn't half as bad as all critics make it out to be. I will admit the fact that I was entertained for what they worked with. I do, however, have my set of alternative plot twists and other suggestions that could've made the movie better but that's just me. For what Jonathan Frakes dished out with the props used, there were some interesting scenes and French Stewart was great. The concept was nice and I got a few laughs from the scene where Zak first uses the watch and freezes that animal (a possum??) and ends up bringing it into the kitchen where Francesca is frozen too. There were some missing ingredients, yes, but I'm not gonna be some picky critic who sits there picking out all the countless amount of flaws in a movie rather than to just sit back and watch what has been made. Otherwise, movie watching isn't fun and instead, it'll be more like some kind of business venture or like a job of picking out fried wires from inside a comp unit. This movie is good for the kids and doesn't have to rely on mindless violence nor the sexuality that perverts always hope for. I don't even know why this is being compared to classics like the ""Back to the Future"" series. There's ""Back to the Future"" in its own and then there's ""Clockstoppers"" which is in its own too. Watch this as its separate piece. The story is simple, a guy named Zak finds a watch device that was sent to his dad from some scientist. Little does he know that the watch device has the ability to stop time and enable the user and anyone who touches the user to roam around in 'Hyper-time.' The scientist's boss wants to find Zak's dad in hopes of replacing him and getting back the watch. Anyway, give this one a chance and watch it without high expectations. If you're one of those picky hardcore film viewers who always needs rated R content or whatever, go watch something else. If you're one of those animated Disney movie freaks yet can't appreciate fun for just an hour, go watch something else.

You have been duly warned--this is a movie for kids. And while it's likely to amuse its target audience, most likely tweens, it's a thinly-plotted, adolescent, Back to the Future wannabe with some interesting special effects.You know the plot already--goofy scientist good guy has created some nifty science gizmo, in this case a wristwatch that can virtually stop time by taking its wearer into ""hyper time.""

We barely get to know who Francesca (the girlfriend) is, which is a shame because she's played with great spunk by Paula Garces.

593208,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKZK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 6]","The idea is attractive: what if you could move so quickly that everybody else would look like they were frozen?  You would not be stopping everybody in their place, as in the old &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, but rather you would be going at living in hyper-time.  Dr. George Gibbs (Robin Thomas) has invented a way of making this work and put it in a witch, which ends up in the hands of his teenage son, Zak (Jesse Bradford).  Of course, Zak sees this as a great way of impressing the new girl at school, Francesca (Paula Garces), but there is also the problem bad people in the employee of millionaire Henry Gate (Michael Biehn) are after Zac for the watch.  To make things worse, Zac gets help from Dr. Earl Dopler (French Stewart), who has been trapped in hyper-time and aged by the process, and his father is kidnapped by the bad people.The movie has one problem, but it is big and ultimately undermines the entire film.  Given this incredibly neat premise, script writers Rob Hedden, Andy Hedden, J. David Stem and David N. Weiss fail to exploit the comic potential to its fullest.  The guy with the nose ring trying to steal the bicycle gets a nice comeuppance, but everything else is rather lame.  Come this with what happens to Jim Carey's character in &quot;Bruce Almighty,&quot; who is given divine powers and knows immediately what is on his &quot;things to do&quot; list when granted divine powers.  We should all have our lists for what we should do if we become a god, can turn invisible, or move at super speed.  At least Zac's girlfriend enjoys exploring the sense of wonder over their newfound ability.Most of &quot;Clockstoppers&quot; is not about using the hyper-time device but rather about getting control of the it, which means they come up with this great idea and then make it a minor plot device.  Maybe the special effects budget was not big enough, but this is a film where the gimmick has to be at the core of the film.  Then again, even without big money you should be able to come up with some good routines provided you have the IMAGINATION to think them up in the first place.  Besides, thinking through the plot possibilities here was clearly too much.  It turns out you do not have to be wearing the watch to be affected, you just have to be touching the person wearing the watch when they turn it on.

Director Jonathan Frakes tries to infuse a lame script with catchy tunes, funky hip hop DJs, and some eye catching special effects in a tale that combines the usual government shadow agency bad guy (Michael Biehn) with the exciting premise that science can now halt the external passing of time while allowing a special watch-carrying agent to act normally within this hypertime.  Jesse Bradford and Paula Garces are the two high schoolers (who by the way look far too old--Garces was 28 when she made this) who meet, fumble in their initial introduction, and go off on what is the same buddy relation that Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy did so much better in WARGAMES. French Stewart lamely plays the same role of the thwarted scientist that Christopher Lloyd had in BACK TO THE FUTURE.  Films that borrow so liberally from other similar and more successful ones are usually noted only for a massive level of scriptual incompetancy.  If the U. S. government really had such a hypertime device, I doubt if it would try to close down the very group that had it.  Further, to cast the leader of the renegade scientists as a megalomaniacal thug is simply to plug into the Lame Scriptwriter's Textbook.

The omnipresent evil government agency wants the watch and the chase is on.French Stewart is the developer of the watch and has a nice funny role. Zak's African-American high-school buddy is about a half step away from Stepin Fetchit (a very underrated comic, by the way) and Michael Biehn has very little screen time. Paula Garces plays the girl-friend Francesca with some style. The movie has so much going on that it leaves too many loose ends and lapses of logic; there is too much time spent on scenes that do not advance the film and not enough time spent on scenes that do. Adults will have to work hard to stay interested. Jonathan Frakes is a better director than this.I suggest watching the film with children present because they will applaud the wonderful things they could do with a watch that stops time and they will laugh at every comic moment.

It offers a clever gimmick, cool special effects, teenage heroes, puppy-love romance, a blaring rock soundtrack and even a mildly dysfunctional father/son relationship to help give the film its requisite patina of ""social relevance.""  Adults, on the other hand - for all the reasons listed above - may well wish they could ""hypertime"" themselves through most of this tale about a crazy watch that has the power to stop time dead in its tracks.For a concept like this to really work (as it did in, say, ""Back to the Future""), it has to be developed using a great deal of ingenuity and creativity.  That is definitely not the case here.  Indeed, the writers, once having come up with the gimmick, seem to have no idea what on earth to do with it for the hour and a half that the film is required to run.  Predictably, when the youngsters discover the extraordinary power of the object in their possession, they spend most of their time using it to play dumb practical jokes on the unsuspecting citizens living in their obviously studio back lot town.  Then, when the novelty of that wears off, the filmmakers trap them in a tedious plot involving stereotypical rule-the-world villains and kidnappers who are bent on retrieving the watch even if it means liquidating all the main characters in the process.""Clockstoppers"" works well enough for prepubescent audiences primarily because both the violence and the lovemaking are kept on a purely prophylactic level (there's also no bad language in the movie).

The villains have little depth other than to be bad guys, the &#34;science&#34; is a bit inconsistent, and there is more than one instance of distraction away from the plot that does nothing more than cater to the kids. In the end it accomplishes what it sets out to do. It just doesn't go any further than that.So what's the story? The bad guys (led by Michael Biehn) want to perfect a technology that puts the user in Hypertime (that's where your molecules speed up to the point the rest of the world moves so slow time seems to stop for the user) so they keep being bad guys. Young Zak (Jesse Bradford) stumbles upon one of the devices and has some fun with it before he realizes the bad guys are after him and his dad (who was helping perfect the technology). What ensues is teens having fun with the time freezing possibilities, and then said teens saving the day after they finally figure out things are serious. Along the way Zack learns some life lessons (I think) and gets to bond with dad.It's a serviceable plot that is used as a vehicle to carry the main point of the film: Hypertime. It's obvious the movie's main motivator is to show off some neat time stopping/slowing special effects. Since Hypertime is all about slowing down time until it's practically stopped there are lots of video editing effects, digital composition and some decent CG effects. The effects themselves are very well done. The transitions between film speed manipulation and regular interaction (and computer generated animations) are seamless aside from the obvious effect being pulled off. There is a good attention to detail here, and that's not surprising since Gale Anne Hurd (producer for Walking Dead, the Terminator movies, Aliens and more) was at the helm. My only problem isn't the effect, but the lack of variation. When time slows down like this you would expect things that go faster in real time wouldn't move just as slow as everything else. Scenes that feature fast  moving objects like cars, hummingbirds and bees show these things are just as slow as the guy walking on the street. It was a bit disappointing.Character-wise the movie doesn't move past standard expectation and stays inside a &#34;this sells to the kids&#34; comfort zone. Time is spent on Zak showing off talents like playing guitar and doing bicycle tricks. None of it really means anything to the story, but it's in there. The girls get a character to be impressed with too in the pretty, rich and sassy Francesca (Paula Garc&eacute;s). Another character who gets to impress the kids she's targeted for with stuff that doesn't really move the story forward. The good news is other elements meant to sell to their crowd does work. Zak and Francesca build a romance/friendship that translates good on film, and gives some added character depth to what otherwise would be static characters.Acting is mostly on the mark for this type of movie. Jesse and Paula have good chemistry together and give enough to their characters to keep them three dimensional. Michael Biehn feels like wasted potential. His character feels like a caricature of a villain and felt it would have been better suited to an actor with more satirical villain skills. I like seeing French Stewart in anything he does. He's fun to watch, even if the character he plays is not the best match for him. Zak's family is played well and Robin Grossman makes a convincing dad with conflicting motivations. There aren't any Oscar worthy performances, but this isn't an Oscar-ish film either.This DVD looks pretty good. It's presented on 1.85:1 anamorphic wide screen with just a little edge enhancement. It's a clean transfer that looks great upscaled. Audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 in English and French. The surround sound it nice and doesn't distract, with most of the effect being done during the &#34;clockstopping&#34;. Dialog is clean and is not drown out by the music or other sound effects. The extras are on the lean side, but at least it's better than nothing. Here's what you get:The Making of Clockstoppers - Runs about ten minutes and includes some neat details on how the special effects were done. SPOILER WARNING: This featurette does give away lots of the movie so don't watch until you see the movie first.Music Videos - &#34;Holiday in my Head&#34; by Smashmouth and &#34;It's the Weekend&#34; by Lil' J. These are the featured songs what were in the movie montages and such.Trailers - You get the movie trailer and four other promotional plugs.Clockstoppers isn't a bad movie by any means, but it certainly isn't a great movie. Considering who they made the movie for you can't really blame them. However other films made for younger audiences were able to pull off better writing and deeper content. If you're a sci-fi fan just know this is light fare and while that aspect of the film is interesting it doesn't carry the movie. For non-youngsters the film may play on the simple side. I think this is more a rental than anything else for most of you out there.",3,Enjoyable young adult kind of movie,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,5314,"['Clockstoppers', 'light', 'sci-fi', 'movie',

593226,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00005JKZK,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Clockstoppers seemed like a Back To The Future rip off to me, but I'd wanted to see the it because I am a Sci-Fi geek and it was directed by Star Trek's Jonathan Frakes. My expectations weren't very high and the story, based in Science Fiction, had the potentially of being too hard for audiences to understand. The writers decided to go another way with it and put this unique, experimental technology in the accidental hands of a teenager, and then marketed the whole package to young adults. It sounded a bit sketchy to me too and that's why it took me almost ten years to see it, but what I learned from this film, you can never judge a DVD by it's cover. Clockstoppers combines Einstein's Theory of Relativity with teenage rebellion in an action packed film that will really leave you on the edge of your seat. The story starts when a former student of Prof. George Gibbs sends him a prototype, of a watch, that speeds up your molecules to the point where it looks like everything else is standing still. Prof. Gibbs soon leaves to go on vacation when his son finds the watch and wears it out, thinking it's a normal watch. Once he learns the truth, other Clockstoppers show up to try and kill him, and that's when the film really gets going. The acting and special effects aren't really what draws you into Clockstoppers, it's the story, which throws you in every single direction and leaves you craving more. This was a film that was at the bottom of my list, that I watched because it was short and it was streaming. I was just looking for something to watch before bed, and what I found instead was a terrific Science Fiction adventure that fell way under the radar.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,1675,"['Clockstoppers', 'seemed', 'Back', 'Future', 'rip', 'off', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'see', 'am', 'Sci-Fi', 'geek', 'was', 'directed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'story', 'based', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'had', 'potentially', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'audiences', 'understand', 'writers', 'decided', 'go', 'way', 'put', 'unique', 'experimental', 'technology', 'accidental', 'hands', 'teenager', 'then', 'marketed', 'whole', 'package', 'young', 'adults', 'sounded', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'too', 'why', 'took', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'see', 'what', 'learned', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'judge', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Clockstoppers', 'Einstein', 'Theory', 'Relativity', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat', 'story', 'when', 'former', 'student', 'Prof.', 'George', 'Gibbs', 'prototype', 'watch', 'up', 'molecules', 'point', 'where', 'everything', 'else', 'standing', 'still', 'Prof.', 'Gibbs', 'soon', 'go', 'vacation', 'when', 'son', 'watch', 'out', 'thinking', 'normal', 'watch', 'Once', 'truth', 'other', 'Clockstoppers', 'show', 'up', 'try', 'kill', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'going', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'Clockstoppers', 'story', 'single', 'direction', 'craving', 'more', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'bottom', 'list', 'watched', 'was', 'short', 'was', 'streaming', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'bed', 'what', 'found', 'instead', 'was', 'terrific', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'adventure', 'fell', 'way', 'radar']",N/A
