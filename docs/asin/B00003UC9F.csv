546744,AIMR915K4YCN,B00003UC9F,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","WHAT THE PEEPER SAW (aka: NIGHT CHILD) begins w/ the death of a woman in a bathtub. Next, we are introduced to Elise (Brit Ekland- THE WICKER MAN, ENDLESS NIGHT) and her young stepson, Marcus (Mark Lester- OLIVER!, WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?). Marcus is the son of the woman who died in the tub. When Marcus' father, Paul re-enters the picture, Marcus displays strange behavior, and bizarre things start happening.  As time goes by, Elise starts to suspect that Marcus isn't as innocent as he appears, and that he just might be dangerous. Her worst fears are confirmed after a visit to Marcus' boarding school. WTPS is a classic example of early 70s cinema, packed w/ mod atmosphere and several opportunities to see Ms. Ekland naked. It's also a very good psychological thriller w/ a supremely twisted ending! Lester plays his disturbed role perfectly. Some of the more suggestive scenes between Lester and Ekland are certainly disturbing by today's standards.

What at first may  seem like a cheap, sleazy exploitation flick(that title doesn't help much),  turns out to be a lurid, exciting thriller that is more concerned with plot  and character than supplying cheap thrills and is all the better for it.  The film is aided by a strong cast, including Mark Lester(the little waif  in the award-winning musical &quot;OLIVER!&quot;) who is chillingly good  and believable every second as the disturbed youngster. Lester's rendition  of THE BAD SEED is far more believable than Macaulay Culkin's in 1993's THE  GOOD SON. The beautiful and sexy Britt Ekland also does well with her role  as the bedeviled stepmother. Luis Cuadrado and Harry Waxman's striking  photography of the Spanish locations also adds much.",3,"&quot;What the Peeper Saw&quot;, or &quot;Oliver goes Psycho&quot;",968803200,"09 13, 2000",2000,953,"['beautiful', 'woman', 'torturous', 'discovery', 'angelic-looking', 'stepson', 'murdered', 'real', 'mother', 'good', 'reason', 'believe', 'evil', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'similarly', 'sinister', 'plans', 'What', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'cheap', 'sleazy', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'title', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'out', 'be', 'lurid', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'more', 'concerned', 'plot', 'character', 'supplying', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'better', 'film', 'aided', 'strong', 'cast', 'including', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'little', 'waif', 'award-winning', 'musical', 'quot', 'OLIVER', 'quot', 'who', 'chillingly', 'good', 'believable', 'second', 'disturbed', 'youngster', 'Lester', 'rendition', 'THE', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', '1993', 'GOOD', 'SON', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'Britt', 'Ekland', 'also', 'well', 'role', 'bedeviled', 'stepmother', 'Luis', 'Cuadrado', 'Harry', 'Waxman', 'striking', 'photography', 'Spanish', 'locations', 'also', 'much']",What the Peeper Saw VHS
546746,A3VKT6WV3UNRE3,B00003UC9F,"Joel, Holden ""Barry Eysman MY REAL NAME""","[1, 2]","It's weird, these films, a certain amount of nudity or sexuality in them, and how many off  beat companies are involved in distributing, I suppose. And has become almost like a game, trying to find them and trying to find the complete versions, more than the films themselves. This is a pretty straightforward movie, about one boy as a walking pathology. It is bizarrely slow, almost stately, with Mark, trading on the OLIVER! image in reverse. The boy  likes perverted sex, and likes to kill things. For anybody who wants to see a perfect face boy who likes a certain amount of gruesomeness, it is strangely entertaining. But, for whoever he is in this film, he appears not to get much excitement out of it. The face of the actor at this stage of his life seems still frightened and jumpy, and close to tears. As well as bored.Not that it's a bad film, because it isn't. Lilli  Palmer has a small thankless role in which she exhibits ice and embeds stupidity like nobody's business, an excellent hollow shell example of psychiatrists. That Marcus fools her is not unexpected. Though she seems more than fooled, as in complicit. Perhaps, just simple minded.The novelization is  braver, because it's just words. Of course. It's a typical British suspense film, as they made in the 60s. The actors are recognizable, and guessing about when the film was made is part of the whole thing. I wonder what happened to Mark's career? At one time, supposedly he was the most bankable actor in the world, according to the commentary track of EYEWITNESS. A commentary track, so funny, It's worth the price of the movie.  I have read the distribution has ended. Another collectors classic? Marcus does some things in the film, that would not be memorable, except it's Mark Lester.The pathology here involves parents, especially a mother and step mother. It is a British film, and yet it has  foreign all over it, filmed apparently in Spain. I wanted to always hear them talking another language, since British films, for the most part, are not considered foreign by us. This one does. Britt Ekland is properly destroyed by Marcus in various ways, including a clever trick of his that leads to the films ending, the resolution of which is oddly satisfying, not a copout.Who knows if Mark had an agent who selected wrong films for him, or much of this was his decision, because he liked horror films, such as WHO SLEW AUNTIE ROO? And wanted to cash in all he could. However it happened, it was a lonely child he always portrayed, then a lonely teenager, and a lonely young adult.He never seemed to lose a particular quality of that in his films. That perplexed glaze, the sadness of eyes, and hint of trembling lips were a sort of trademark. It's all so long ago, but it seems like a certain lonely desperation enveloped him as an actor. Who knows, he may been having the time of his life, this could be just the way he looked, nothing else. But for those who saw the movie of  Lionel Bart's OLIVER! when ourselves young, these films, though I've collected them, make  me rather sad. I just remember Oliver Twist , lip-synching and asking where is love? But it was a movie, and so are these. Dealers in films like dealers in books and television shows too, just want to make some money, like everybody does, however, there is a lot wrong with using a child is a commodity.But a lone small spirit still envelopes and illuminates all of his films. All of which are worth seeing and keeping. Especially for those there at the beginning, when we were all novices of life, and miss it so.",3,NIGHT OF THE CHILD,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3568,"['weird', 'films', 'certain', 'amount', 'nudity', 'sexuality', 'how', 'many', 'off', 'beat', 'companies', 'are', 'involved', 'distributing', 'suppose', 'become', 'almost', 'game', 'trying', 'find', 'trying', 'find', 'complete', 'versions', 'more', 'films', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'one', 'boy', 'walking', 'pathology', 'bizarrely', 'slow', 'almost', 'stately', 'Mark', 'trading', 'OLIVER', 'image', 'reverse', 'boy', 'likes', 'perverted', 'sex', 'likes', 'kill', 'things', 'anybody', 'who', 'see', 'perfect', 'face', 'boy', 'who', 'certain', 'amount', 'gruesomeness', 'strangely', 'entertaining', 'whoever', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'excitement', 'face', 'actor', 'stage', 'life', 'still', 'frightened', 'jumpy', 'close', 'tears', 'As', 'well', 'bored.Not', 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'Lilli', 'Palmer', 'small', 'thankless', 'role', 'ice', 'stupidity', 'nobody', 'business', 'excellent', 'hollow', 'shell', 'example', 'psychiatrists', 'Marcus', 'not', 'unexpected', 'more', 'fooled', 'complicit', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'simple', 'minded.The', 'novelization', 'braver', 'just', 'words', 'course', 'typical', 'British', 'suspense', 'film', 'made', '60s', 'actors', 'are', 'recognizable', 'guessing', 'about', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'part', 'whole', 'thing', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Mark', 'career', 'one', 'time', 'supposedly', 'was', 'most', 'bankable', 'actor', 'world', 'according', 'commentary', 'track', 'EYEWITNESS', 'commentary', 'track', 'so', 'funny', 'price', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'distribution', 'ended', 'collectors', 'classic', 'Marcus', 'things', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'memorable', 'Mark', 'Lester.The', 'pathology', 'here', 'parents', 'especially', 'mother', 'step', 'mother', 'British', 'film', 'yet', 'foreign', 'filmed', 'apparently', 'Spain', 'wanted', 'always', 'hear', 'talking', 'language', 'British', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'considered', 'foreign', 'one', 'Britt', 'Ekland', 'properly', 'destroyed', 'Marcus', 'various', 'ways', 'including', 'clever', 'trick', 'films', 'ending', 'resolution', 'oddly', 'satisfying', 'not', 'copout.Who', 'Mark', 'had', 'agent', 'who', 'selected', 'wrong', 'films', 'much', 'was', 'decision', 'liked', 'horror', 'films', 'such', 'WHO', 'SLEW', 'AUNTIE', 'ROO', 'wanted', 'cash', 'could', 'However', 'happened', 'was', 'lonely', 'child', 'always', 'portrayed', 'then', 'lonely', 'teenager', 'lonely', 'young', 'adult.He', 'never', 'seemed', 'lose', 'particular', 'quality', 'films', 'perplexed', 'glaze', 'sadness', 'eyes', 'hint', 'trembling', 'lips', 'were', 'sort', 'trademark', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'certain', 'lonely', 'desperation', 'enveloped', 'actor', 'Who', 'may', 'been', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'way', 'looked', 'nothing', 'else', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'Lionel', 'Bart', 'OLIVER', 'when', 'young', 'films', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'make', 'rather', 'sad', 'just', 'remember', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'lip-synching', 'asking', 'where', 'love', 'was', 'movie', 'so', 'are', 'Dealers', 'films', 'dealers', 'books', 'television', 'shows', 'too', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'everybody', 'however', 'lot', 'wrong', 'using', 'child', 'commodity.But', 'lone', 'small', 'spirit', 'still', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'keeping', 'Especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'were', 'novices', 'life', 'miss', 'so']",What the Peeper Saw VHS
