1368014,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B003VZ8JDQ,Compay,"[7, 7]","Woke Up Dead has an excellent cast of actors, so I was surprised at how much of a let-down the DVD was. Woke Up Dead isn't really a traditional movie. It's a string of 22 episodes of a show that was streamed on the internet in 2009.The webisode series followed Drex Greene (Napoleon Dynamite), a zombie who tries to discover the secret behind a mysterious pill that made him ""wake up dead."" He's aided by his camera-toting buddy Matt, and Cassie, an especially hot medical student.The good news: the casting is great. Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite stars as Drex, Josh Gad from ""21"" plays his roommate, and friend, and the beautiful Krysten Ritter (Breaking Bad) is Drex's med student love interest. Add to the mix Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld), Meital Dohan (Weeds), and Ellia English (Curb Your Enthusiasm), and it looks like you'd have a hit DVD.The problem? The writing is downright boring. It's not a legit ""zombie"" flick, and it's just not funny. The editing gives it the feel of a Nickelodeon program, but with adult themes. The product placement for Kodak throughout the program also starts to get a little annoying after a while.What's worse is that the ""movie"" ends on a cliffhanger, since it's a compilation of the first season of the webisodes. You don't get to find out what happens to Drex (in the middle of an explanation), nor how he became a zombie. Since a second season hasn't even been announced, we're at least a year away from even finding out how the story ends.The bottom line: This was a great collection of actors, all underused because of weak writing and a low budget. A film about a guy trying to make a discovery ends mid-story with no explanations and no closure. Why this was released on DVD before a second season was even filmed is a complete mystery to me, I wouldn't even suggesting renting it.",2,Bad Use of a Great Cast - Inexcusable Cliffhanger,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1836,"['Woke', 'Up', 'Dead', 'excellent', 'cast', 'actors', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'let-down', 'DVD', 'was', 'Woke', 'Up', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'really', 'traditional', 'movie', 'string', '22', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'streamed', 'internet', '2009.The', 'webisode', 'series', 'followed', 'Drex', 'Greene', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'zombie', 'who', 'discover', 'secret', 'mysterious', 'pill', 'made', 'wake', 'up', 'dead', 'aided', 'camera-toting', 'buddy', 'Matt', 'Cassie', 'especially', 'hot', 'medical', 'student.The', 'good', 'news', 'casting', 'great', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'stars', 'Drex', 'Josh', 'Gad', '21', 'roommate', 'friend', 'beautiful', 'Krysten', 'Ritter', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Drex', 'med', 'student', 'love', 'interest', 'Add', 'mix', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Newman', 'Seinfeld', 'Meital', 'Dohan', 'Weeds', 'Ellia', 'English', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', ""'d"", 'have', 'hit', 'DVD.The', 'problem', 'writing', 'downright', 'boring', 'not', 'legit', 'zombie', 'flick', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'editing', 'feel', 'Nickelodeon', 'program', 'adult', 'themes', 'product', 'placement', 'Kodak', 'program', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'annoying', 'while.What', 'worse', 'movie', 'cliffhanger', 'compilation', 'first', 'season', 'webisodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Drex', 'middle', 'explanation', 'how', 'became', 'zombie', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'announced', ""'re"", 'least', 'year', 'away', 'even', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'story', 'ends.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'great', 'collection', 'actors', 'underused', 'weak', 'writing', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'discovery', 'mid-story', 'explanations', 'closure', 'Why', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'filmed', 'complete', 'mystery', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'suggesting', 'renting']",Woke Up Dead

The problem starts towards the end of the movie where you see that they are running out of time to wrap this up (and yes it slows to a crawl making you look at the time).  After 80 minutes you find out (since I'd never heard of WUD or Crackle) that this is a web-series of 4 minute episodes strung together ending in a cliffhanger.  Very disappointing.As others have mentioned if you love zombies...and who doesn't, you will be let down.  If you like comedies, horror movies and/or a complete story...again you will be let down.  If they think I will visit Crackle weekly for the next season of 4 minute episodes...*they* will be let down.",2,This isn't a movie.

1368018,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B003VZ8JDQ,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Woke up Dead is the creation of John Fasano who has a slew of titles under his belt for writing, producing, directing, and acting. While I haven't seen most of what he has worked on previously there are two movies he's written that I HAVE seen - Darkness Falls and Another 48 Hours. Not too much on the horror front but this one is more of a comedy than a horror film. Of course with the main star being Jon Heder I doubt anyone figured it would be anything but hilarious (unless of course you hate Heder.)Woke Up Dead originally was 'aired' in webisode format on Crackle and I was a bit surprised that the film was put together so well. As I mentioned it started as webisodes. 22 4 minute webisodes put together into a feature film which is now ready for you to enjoy.The story begins with Drex Green (Jon Heder) whose heart was broken and ends up wanting to take a cold bath. The only problem this cold bath ends up with him being under water for 15 minutes and 'woke up dead' after.) His best friend, a film student named Matt (Josh Gad) discovers him and has the recorded proof that he was under water for too long and wants to make a web series about the While at first that's a bit of a stretch he's hit by a bus soon after and with no heartbeat is tossed in a body bag and discovered by a medical student named Cassie(Krysten Ritter) who has dreams of turning his undeath into her ticket to money and fame in her medical profession.Drex, once a loser and now one of the undead tries to return to a normal life after he's been dead. Yes he's returned from the life and has a hunger for brains. In fact the only thing that he CAN eat is brains without getting sick. Pretty much everyone who annoys him turns into a brain chewing fantasy in his mind. Aside from that there are no 'zombie' activities that happens. Drex gets super strength, heat vision, improved healing, and all kinds of random 'powers' with a strange man stalking him.This is not your typical zombie film in any way shape or form. While Drex is technically a zombie he's an intelligent zombie (has been done) and can eat animal brains instead of humans (can be done.) It's not a horror film (even with a zombie) but unlike films like Fido which was also low on gore with a zombie as one of the center characters you can't exactly call it a comedy since it wasn't that funny. It was however interesting in that different type of film kind of way. It's not a comedy but has a lot of comedians, it's not a romantic comedy but it has Drex trying to get interested with Cassie, it's not a horror film though it does show Drex fantasizing about eating zombies. I'm not sure if I can suggest buying it but I would say renting would be a plus. The only part of it I could say is a 'problem' is that there is a HUGE cliffhanger at the end and we have no idea if there will be a sequel released. So sitting through it won't give you all of the answers, just a few.",2,A good concept that fell short and unfinished,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2926,"['Woke', 'up', 'Dead', 'creation', 'John', 'Fasano', 'who', 'slew', 'titles', 'belt', 'writing', 'producing', 'directing', 'acting', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'what', 'worked', 'previously', 'are', 'two', 'movies', 'written', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'Darkness', 'Falls', '48', 'Hours', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'horror', 'front', 'one', 'more', 'comedy', 'horror', 'film', 'course', 'main', 'star', 'being', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'hilarious', 'course', 'hate', 'Heder', 'Woke', 'Up', 'Dead', 'originally', 'was', ""'aired"", 'webisode', 'format', 'Crackle', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'mentioned', 'started', 'webisodes', '22', '4', 'minute', 'webisodes', 'put', 'together', 'feature', 'film', 'now', 'ready', 'enjoy.The', 'story', 'Drex', 'Green', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'heart', 'was', 'broken', 'up', 'wanting', 'take', 'cold', 'bath', 'only', 'problem', 'cold', 'bath', 'up', 'being', 'water', '15', 'minutes', ""'woke"", 'up', 'dead', 'best', 'friend', 'film', 'student', 'named', 'Matt', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'recorded', 'proof', 'was', 'water', 'too', 'long', 'make', 'web', 'series', 'first', 'bit', 'stretch', 'hit', 'bus', 'soon', 'heartbeat', 'tossed', 'body', 'bag', 'discovered', 'medical', 'student', 'named', 'Cassie', 'Krysten', 'Ritter', 'who', 'dreams', 'turning', 'undeath', 'ticket', 'money', 'fame', 'medical', 'profession.Drex', 'once', 'loser', 'now', 'one', 'undead', 'tries', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'been', 'dead', 'returned', 'life', 'hunger', 'brains', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'CAN', 'eat', 'brains', 'getting', 'sick', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'brain', 'chewing', 'fantasy', 'mind', 'Aside', 'are', ""'zombie"", 'activities', 'Drex', 'super', 'strength', 'heat', 'vision', 'improved', 'healing', 'kinds', 'random', ""'powers"", 'strange', 'man', 'stalking', 'him.This', 'not', 'typical', 'zombie', 'film', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Drex', 'technically', 'zombie', 'intelligent', 'zombie', 'been', 'done', 'can', 'eat', 'animal', 'brains', 'instead', 'humans', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'even', 'zombie', 'films', 'Fido', 'was', 'also', 'low', 'gore', 'zombie', 'one', 'center', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'call', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', 'however', 'interesting', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'kind', 'way', 'not', 'comedy', 'lot', 'comedians', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Drex', 'trying', 'get', 'interested', 'Cassie', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'show', 'Drex', 'fantasizing', 'eating', 'zombies', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'suggest', 'buying', 'would', 'say', 'renting', 'would', 'be', 'plus', 'only', 'part', 'could', 'say', ""'problem"", 'HUGE', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'have', 'idea', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'released', 'So', 'sitting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'just', 'few']",Woke Up Dead
