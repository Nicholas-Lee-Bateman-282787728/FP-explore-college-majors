1637866,ANHNKOC4737K6,B00BRKYZVM,M. Armstrong,"[0, 0]",This movie is one that the whole family can sit together and watch and enjoy.  It is a very moving story.  It is believable and the young man who plays Jimmy does a truly believable job as a special needs child. This film is wholesome and you won't have to worry about immoral issues or bad language.  I highly recommend this film.,5,Family Type Movie,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,331,"['movie', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'together', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'very', 'moving', 'story', 'believable', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Jimmy', 'truly', 'believable', 'job', 'special', 'needs', 'child', 'film', 'wholesome', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'immoral', 'issues', 'bad', 'language', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Jimmy
1637867,A1QY9O49W3G684,B00BRKYZVM,Patricia Hager,"[1, 1]",I bought this movie recently at a christian bookstore in north carolina. It has been on the shelf for several months and today with it being a wintery snowy kind of day I took it down and decided to watch it. This movie pierced my heart.for its story line and it is now one of my favorite christian movies. I actually thought the young man portraying the main character was developmentally challenged until I started reading about the actors. What a tremendous acting job Ian did as Jimmy. It will cause you to reflect on your walk with Christ...it will be a good conversation starter if you have people over to watch it...it is great for almost all ages although children under 6 or 7 might not understand it. I was especially moved by the Watchers in the story line and how God had those special angel beings looking after this young 14 year old boy throughout the storyline. Did I week while watching it? Yes. But I was also rejoicing too over the fact it is a movie that Hollywood or other people need to take note that this is the kind of movie we want for our families. No cursing. No sex. No drugs although there was a slight mention in it concerning two teens who were drug into the possibility of selling drugs by the character who was bad in the movie but not for long was this used. I love movies that cause me to be happy while watching a story and not so downcast by the negatives that Hollywood keeps making. I love a story that could be true and I love a movie that you do not have to be afraid who watches it because of its content. There were a few negative comments here but I did not understand them. The whole story was beautiful and I will watch it again and again and look for others like it that I do not have to be embarrassed while watching a movie with even my grandkids. I will not watch the filth that is out there anymore and when I find christian movies on line or in christian bookstores I usually buy them to have on hand for company. Oh watch it and be blessed by this movie Jimmy with a beautiful story of how a 14 year old boy loves the Lord Jesus in his simplicity of life and how it can speak to anyone who needs touched in this way.,5,This movie is an excellent family viewing film!,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2170,"['bought', 'movie', 'recently', 'christian', 'bookstore', 'north', 'carolina', 'been', 'shelf', 'several', 'months', 'today', 'being', 'wintery', 'snowy', 'kind', 'day', 'took', 'down', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'pierced', 'heart.for', 'story', 'line', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'christian', 'movies', 'actually', 'thought', 'young', 'man', 'portraying', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'developmentally', 'challenged', 'started', 'reading', 'actors', 'What', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'job', 'Ian', 'did', 'Jimmy', 'will', 'cause', 'reflect', 'walk', 'Christ', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'conversation', 'starter', 'have', 'people', 'watch', 'great', 'almost', 'ages', 'children', '6', '7', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'was', 'especially', 'moved', 'Watchers', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'God', 'had', 'special', 'angel', 'beings', 'looking', 'young', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'storyline', 'Did', 'week', 'watching', 'Yes', 'was', 'also', 'rejoicing', 'too', 'fact', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'other', 'people', 'need', 'take', 'note', 'kind', 'movie', 'want', 'families', 'cursing', 'sex', 'drugs', 'was', 'slight', 'mention', 'concerning', 'two', 'teens', 'who', 'were', 'drug', 'possibility', 'selling', 'drugs', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'was', 'used', 'love', 'movies', 'cause', 'be', 'happy', 'watching', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'downcast', 'negatives', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'love', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'love', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'afraid', 'who', 'content', 'were', 'few', 'negative', 'comments', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'beautiful', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'look', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'grandkids', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'filth', 'there', 'anymore', 'when', 'find', 'christian', 'movies', 'line', 'christian', 'bookstores', 'usually', 'buy', 'have', 'hand', 'company', 'Oh', 'watch', 'be', 'blessed', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'beautiful', 'story', 'how', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'simplicity', 'life', 'how', 'can', 'speak', 'anyone', 'who', 'touched', 'way']",Jimmy
