""Go out and Defeat Dr. Willy Mega Man!"", ""Yes, Master Light.""Even take a look @ some of the later Mega Man games and I think you'll see that Mega Man can think, so it looks like the games screwed up too!Anyway, it's a good series and I highly recomend it.",5,This isn't supposed to be a clone of the game's plot.,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,688,"['have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'DVD', 'want', 'once', 'get', 'enough', 'money.The', 'series', 'great-and', 'think', 'reviewers', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'big', 'deal', 'differences', 'series', 'game-saying', 'messed', 'up', 'load', 'bull', 'Do', 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'big', 'difference', 'accident', 'did', 'add', 'spice', 'plot-like', 'who', 'main', 'hero', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'Go', 'out', 'Defeat', 'Dr.', 'Willy', 'Mega', 'Man', 'Yes', 'Master', 'Light', 'Even', 'take', 'look', 'later', 'Mega', 'Man', 'games', 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Mega', 'Man', 'can', 'think', 'games', 'screwed', 'up', 'too', 'Anyway', 'good', 'series', 'highly', 'recomend']",Megaman: A Hero Is Born

It's a shame really that it's Megaman seeing as there is such a vast majority of 80's cartoons that were better than this (You know it's true) but never the less, It's here and it's good.

But, the evil Dr. Wylie along with Megaman's prototype Protoman have their own army of robots they use to try and take over the world. Fortunately, Megaman can take their powers away from them and use them as his own weapons(sorta like Kirby!). This series ran for 26 episodes.

It's been years since I've lasted watched this cartoon, but now that I've added it to my video collection, I can reclaim those memories whenever I wish.  I only remembered two episodes (&quot;Mega-Pinochio&quot; and &quot;Future Shock&quot;) and I couldn't wait to see them again.The animation is superb, and the shading is very well-done.  Not even most Disney movies do this much shading!  And the reflection on Protoman's visor is just awesome.  Some of the character designs are a bit on the odd side (Where's Ringman's other hand?), but you get used to it real quick.  Though, I forgot that Iceman sounded like a gruff Brooklynite(!).  The voice acting, otherwise, is great, with some very punny lines.I watched every episode from start to finish, except &quot;Robosaur Park&quot;, which was just torture.  That was laying on the cheese a tad too thick for my taste.  But, I can't wait for the other volume to come out and I hope they include &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, because, technically, that was on the third season.Even with the &quot;Robosaur Park&quot; episode of doom, this still makes a great addition to any anime fan's library, and is a must-have for Megaman fans.  I'm glad I added it to my DVD collection.  No regrets there.  It was one of the best birthday presents I've gotten.~QuickmanA review by the Red Racer.",5,Wow...

729725,AZ7X1ED2UGEL2,B00007JZO7,Shadow mage,"[2, 4]","While this is a pretty good cartoon its not really accurate to the games. First off, all the robots are too tall & too muscle bound, secondly their weapons dont work the same way in the show that they do in the game. Another down side is there are none of the later day robots from Mega Man 5-8 which is bad because one of the coolest robots in the whole series, ""Bass"" is not in the show. A third problem is Mega Man himself, the problem is Mega Man is really just a little boy, but this one looks like an adult!(WAH,WAH,WAH) Why oh why couldnt they make a Mega Man TV show with the same animation as in the cut-scenes of Mega Man 8 ?!?Last but not least this is not anime but american art. Whats one thing that could have made the show better? How about some plots that arent down right corny! Want a good example of how corny this show can get? Then check out the fabled Dino World episodes!Mega Man season 1 is still worth buying but after that its all down hill from there.Pros: DVD contains 13 episodes, has some good voice acting, contains enemies from the first 5 games, Mega man X makes an appearence in one of the episodes, and Dr. Light has a great voice when compared to Mega Man 8, meaning he dosent sound like Elmer Fudd!Cons: Mega man looks and sounds like an adult, Both Roll & Proto man's stories have been messed around with!In the game Rush was Mega man's loyal and helpful companion but in the show he's been made into a bumbling side-kick!Most of the robots in the Mega Man games were child-like in appearence, but in this TV show they're all muscle bound and look like adults! I mean, Mega man has a six pack for crying out loud! And lastly, some of the episodes have very corny plot lines!Overall: This DVD is entertaining and well worth buying, but it's not all that hard-core fans will have hoped for.

This looked really good.  Also the clever mix of action and comedy ensured that this would appeal to all audiences.The story behind this dvd is that Dr. Wily and his robots are consistantly developing plans to conquer the world.  Wilys primary three robots are Cutsman, Gutsman, and Protoman.  Each episode also features one or more guest robots who assist Wily.  Generally its Snakeman or Bombman, but we do get to see characters through game 5 of the series.One of the greatest aspects of the series was the opening sequence.  This alone is easily one of the best seen out there with a catchy tune and lots of action to promise what will be seen.This dvd features the first half of the entire series and is worth picking up.
