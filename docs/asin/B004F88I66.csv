The screenplay is outstanding with twists and turns and the plot intelligent enough to keep the movie moving along with a good pace. Since there are just two main characters they sure hold the fort with their excellent acting.If you appreciate the fact that sometimes a movie based largely on the conversations between two persons can be so intense, personal, deep, powerful, and intelligent that it can handily overcome the fact that it doesn't have the typical Hollywood need for more actors and different scene settings, then you would certainly enjoy this movie.The only debate I had about commenting on this movie is whether it is a 4 (great) or 5 (superb) star movie. In the end, I think it deserves 4.5 stars.Hats off to all, especially the author, screenplay writer, actors, director, and producer for delivering a truly fine movie.",4,Great movie,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,979,"['read', 'movie', 'description', 'might', 'actually', 'think', 'sleazy', 'movie', 'lot', 'nudity', 'sex', 'contrary', 'not', 'screenplay', 'outstanding', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'sure', 'hold', 'fort', 'excellent', 'acting.If', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'movie', 'based', 'largely', 'conversations', 'two', 'persons', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'intense', 'personal', 'deep', 'powerful', 'intelligent', 'can', 'handily', 'overcome', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'need', 'more', 'actors', 'different', 'scene', 'settings', 'then', 'would', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'movie.The', 'only', 'debate', 'had', 'commenting', 'movie', '4', 'great', '5', 'superb', 'star', 'movie', 'end', 'think', '4.5', 'stars.Hats', 'especially', 'author', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'actors', 'director', 'producer', 'delivering', 'truly', 'fine', 'movie']",N/A
