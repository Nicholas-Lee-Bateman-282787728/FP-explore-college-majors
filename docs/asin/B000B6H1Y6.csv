The main reason - the producers found it necessary to include in one of the Christmas Eve's a portion of the main character being extremely self-absorbed -- he buys everything he wants, treats people anyway he wants -- which OK is what self-absorbed people do, however, I didn't need the scene where he has self-fulfilling sex with his girlfriend.  The whole bed scene could have been eliminated, even if the producers alluded to it.At best, the acting was B-rated.",1,Only 10 Days were worth the movie,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,566,"['returned', 'movie', 'Being', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'fan', 'could', 'see', 'need', 'retain', 'home', 'main', 'reason', 'producers', 'found', 'necessary', 'include', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'portion', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'extremely', 'self-absorbed', 'everything', 'treats', 'people', 'anyway', 'OK', 'what', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'do', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'scene', 'where', 'self-fulfilling', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'whole', 'bed', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'eliminated', 'even', 'producers', 'alluded', 'it.At', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'B-rated']",The 12 Days of Christmas Eve

This charming little holiday nugget combines the reliving the same day elements from GROUNDHOG DAY with the perennial tale of Ebenezer Scrooge as a man given a chance to make his life correct.In this version, Steven Weber is quite good as Clarence Klein, a corporate exec who opts to spend Christmas Eve courting the head of a South American company interested in his stores, The Buck Stops Here.  Patricia Valesquez is charming in this role and adds some love interest (?) as well.  After a succesful day with Velasquez, while missing his son's Christmas concert and using a reservation for a fancy restaurant from his current squeeze, Klein is killed when the huge pointing finger logo sign crushes him.  He ends up in the hands of angel/Angie Molly Shannon who informs him he has 12 chances to make things right.Weber tries everything from working in a soup kitchen to giving away 1.2 million dollars to try and earn a new chance but of course it takes him the full twelve days and eleven more deaths to see the light.Weber's charming performance and Shannon's acerbic turn spark the movie and make it a delightful holiday movie.",4,SCROOGE MEETS GROUNDHOG DAY,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1220,"['Coming', 'up', 'new', 'ideas', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'task', 'movie', 'producers', 'charming', 'little', 'holiday', 'nugget', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'elements', 'GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'perennial', 'tale', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'man', 'given', 'chance', 'make', 'life', 'correct.In', 'version', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'quite', 'good', 'Clarence', 'Klein', 'corporate', 'exec', 'who', 'spend', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'courting', 'head', 'South', 'American', 'company', 'interested', 'stores', 'Buck', 'Stops', 'Here', 'Patricia', 'Valesquez', 'charming', 'role', 'love', 'interest', 'as', 'well', 'succesful', 'day', 'Velasquez', 'missing', 'son', 'Christmas', 'concert', 'using', 'reservation', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'current', 'squeeze', 'Klein', 'killed', 'when', 'huge', 'pointing', 'finger', 'logo', 'sign', 'crushes', 'up', 'hands', 'angel/Angie', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'who', '12', 'chances', 'make', 'things', 'right.Weber', 'tries', 'everything', 'working', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'giving', 'away', '1.2', 'million', 'dollars', 'try', 'earn', 'new', 'chance', 'course', 'full', 'twelve', 'days', 'eleven', 'more', 'deaths', 'see', 'light.Weber', 'charming', 'performance', 'Shannon', 'acerbic', 'turn', 'spark', 'movie', 'make', 'delightful', 'holiday', 'movie']",The 12 Days of Christmas Eve

I believe this was a USA network picture as I recall.  The movie basically borrows elements from Groundhog Day, It's A Wonderful Life, and Scrooge to arrive at its story.  Steven Weber, a fairly likable actor plays Calvin a business owner who has taken the family store and built it into a national chain.  But this has of course hurt him in his personal life leading to his marriage disolving and alienating his son and brother.Calvin has an accident and wakes up to find that he's essentially dead...He's meets Nurse Angie who is his guardian Angel and he is told, ala Scrooge that he has 12 days to set things right with the rest of his family and his life...or else.  Shannon provides most of the laughs in her own usual manic way, basically hammering Calvin over the head on what he has to do.  And of course in the end we have Calvin discovering the true meaning of Christmas and he sets things right with his family.  The performances were very good it's just too bad there wasn't more of an original story for them to work with.",3,WISHY WASHY AND UNORIGINAL WITH A FEW LAUGHS,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,1156,"['12', 'Days', 'Christmas', 'one', 'rather', 'innane', 'made-for-tv', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'crop', 'up', 'holiday', 'season', 'believe', 'was', 'USA', 'network', 'picture', 'recall', 'movie', 'basically', 'elements', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Scrooge', 'arrive', 'story', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'fairly', 'likable', 'actor', 'Calvin', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'taken', 'family', 'store', 'built', 'national', 'chain', 'course', 'hurt', 'personal', 'life', 'leading', 'marriage', 'disolving', 'alienating', 'son', 'brother.Calvin', 'accident', 'up', 'find', 'essentially', 'dead', 'meets', 'Nurse', 'Angie', 'who', 'guardian', 'Angel', 'told', 'ala', 'Scrooge', '12', 'days', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'rest', 'family', 'life', 'else', 'Shannon', 'most', 'laughs', 'own', 'usual', 'manic', 'way', 'basically', 'hammering', 'Calvin', 'head', 'what', 'do', 'course', 'end', 'have', 'Calvin', 'discovering', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'things', 'right', 'family', 'performances', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'original', 'story', 'work']",The 12 Days of Christmas Eve
