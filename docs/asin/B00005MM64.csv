666386,A3R1RMX39QI265,B00005MM64,"Karris ""yassa""","[3, 3]","Before Anthony Hopkins decided to make a career out of mugging his way through the Hannibal Lecter movies, he made this terrific little film about a small family-owned business that hires an efficiency expert to assess their finances and employees. What sets this aside is the warmth and compassion of the characters involved, who are all well-drawn and interesting, with good relationships to each other. Treading occasionally on Local Hero territory, this film is a gem and deserves as wide an audience as the overrated Hannibal the Cannibal splatter-fest. Hopkins is a brilliant actor when seperated from his Jack Nicholson moments, and shines in this movie. Highly recommended.",5,Outstanding small film,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,681,"['Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'decided', 'make', 'career', 'mugging', 'way', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'movies', 'made', 'terrific', 'little', 'film', 'small', 'family-owned', 'business', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'assess', 'finances', 'employees', 'What', 'aside', 'warmth', 'compassion', 'characters', 'involved', 'who', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'interesting', 'good', 'relationships', 'other', 'Treading', 'occasionally', 'Local', 'Hero', 'territory', 'film', 'gem', 'as', 'wide', 'audience', 'overrated', 'Hannibal', 'Cannibal', 'splatter-fest', 'Hopkins', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'when', 'seperated', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'moments', 'shines', 'movie', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Efficiency Expert

He is occupied with cold facts and figures rather than compassion and dignity for the workers as he decides that 50% of the company could be laid off in the interests of getting the firm out of the red.There's financial consulting, change management, resistance to change, the usual works. Then something happens that changes his perspective on his consulting recommendations, specifically a (doozy) car racing event.In its denouement, the movie goes somewhat Polyanna (how one wishes such &quot;solutions&quot; were possible in the real world) but the cosy, relaxed pacing of the movie and its simple lessons make this a worthy rental.Oh, and if Russel Crowe is the reason you're renting this, beware: he has a small part, I should have guessed this, the movie is from 1992 and he was still a budding Australian actor.",4,"INTERESTING LESSON ABOUT BUSINESS, GLOBALIZATION, LIFE.",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1341,"['Flawless', 'production', 'coupled', 'sparse', 'unfortunate', 'musical', 'selections', 'Sixties', 'unsung', 'gratifying', 'little', 'film', 'captures', 'beautifully', 'discovering/rediscovering', 'true', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'vantage', 'point', 'two', 'separate', 'generations', 'social', 'classes.With', 'current', 'scourge', 'globalization', 'very', 'poignant', 'chord', 'when', 'quot', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'quot', 'ever', 'versatile', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'investigate', 'dwindling', 'profits', 'small', 'town', 'shoe-manufacturing', 'firm', 'occupied', 'cold', 'facts', 'figures', 'rather', 'compassion', 'dignity', 'workers', '50', '%', 'company', 'could', 'be', 'laid', 'off', 'interests', 'getting', 'firm', 'red.There', 'financial', 'consulting', 'change', 'management', 'resistance', 'change', 'usual', 'works', 'Then', 'something', 'perspective', 'consulting', 'recommendations', 'specifically', 'doozy', 'car', 'racing', 'denouement', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'Polyanna', 'how', 'one', 'such', 'quot', 'solutions', 'quot', 'were', 'possible', 'real', 'world', 'cosy', 'relaxed', 'pacing', 'movie', 'simple', 'lessons', 'make', 'worthy', 'rental.Oh', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'reason', ""'re"", 'renting', 'beware', 'small', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'guessed', 'movie', '1992', 'was', 'still', 'budding', 'Australian', 'actor']",Efficiency Expert

Take a small business owned by an old man who cherishes his employees but has forgotten how to make a profit, add an outside expert and romance among workers, and you have a film that's enjoyable but in little danger of becoming a classic.
