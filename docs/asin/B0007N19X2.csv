883067,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0007N19X2,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[81, 84]","""I Am David"" is a low-budget but finely crafted story of an 11 year old boy who has spent most of his short life in a Bulgarian Gulag during the horrors of the Stalin era. He escapes, with the help of his mentor Johannes, and the head officer of the forced labor camp, and is told to ""Trust no one."" Writer/director Paul Feig based his film on the bestseller ""North to Freedom"" by Anne Holm, and the script is intelligent and has sensitivity and depth. David makes his way through Greece and Italy, and into Switzerland, with the constant fear that he will be returned to the labor camp.The cast is excellent, with Ben Tibber as the stoic and courageous David, and Joan Plowright, who adds to her lifetime of flawless performances here with the portrayal of Sophie, an artist who teaches David to trust in life and humanity. In the small but pivotal part of Johannes, Jim Caviezel is marvelous. This was filmed before he played Jesus in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and some other actors in ""The Passion"" are also in ""I Am David,"" notably Hristo Shopov (who was Pontius Pilate) as the head officer, and Francesco De Vito (Peter) as Roberto the sailor/truck driver. Director Feig has a cameo as an American whose car runs out of gas, in one of the more humorous scenes in the film.The DVD features are good, and include interviews with producers and actors on how the film was planned and made, deleted scenes, and interesting commentary by Feig, where he shows us just how stringent his budget was, and how he had to cut corners. Despite the financial limitations, this is an inspiring film, as well as an entertaining one. ""I Am David"" makes wonderful family viewing, and will give younger audiences a glimpse into the Gulags behind the Iron Curtain of the early 1950s, and how the human spirit can conquer adversity.",5,A Tale of Courage and Hope,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1831,"['Am', 'David', 'low-budget', 'finely', 'crafted', 'story', '11', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'short', 'life', 'Bulgarian', 'Gulag', 'horrors', 'Stalin', 'era', 'help', 'mentor', 'Johannes', 'head', 'officer', 'forced', 'labor', 'camp', 'told', 'Trust', 'one', 'Writer/director', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'based', 'film', 'bestseller', 'North', 'Freedom', 'Anne', 'Holm', 'script', 'intelligent', 'sensitivity', 'depth', 'David', 'way', 'Greece', 'Italy', 'Switzerland', 'constant', 'fear', 'will', 'be', 'returned', 'labor', 'camp.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Ben', 'Tibber', 'stoic', 'courageous', 'David', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'who', 'lifetime', 'flawless', 'performances', 'here', 'portrayal', 'Sophie', 'artist', 'who', 'David', 'trust', 'life', 'humanity', 'small', 'pivotal', 'part', 'Johannes', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'marvelous', 'was', 'filmed', 'played', 'Jesus', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'other', 'actors', 'Passion', 'are', 'also', 'Am', 'David', 'notably', 'Hristo', 'Shopov', 'who', 'was', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'head', 'officer', 'Francesco', 'De', 'Vito', 'Peter', 'Roberto', 'sailor/truck', 'driver', 'Director', 'Feig', 'cameo', 'American', 'car', 'gas', 'one', 'more', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'include', 'interviews', 'producers', 'actors', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'planned', 'made', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'Feig', 'where', 'just', 'how', 'stringent', 'budget', 'was', 'how', 'had', 'cut', 'corners', 'financial', 'limitations', 'inspiring', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Am', 'David', 'wonderful', 'family', 'viewing', 'will', 'give', 'younger', 'audiences', 'glimpse', 'Gulags', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'early', '1950s', 'how', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'conquer', 'adversity']",N/A

883069,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B0007N19X2,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[1, 1]","This film, based on Danish writer Anne Holm's 1963 best selling novel 'David,' was adapted for the screen by Director Paul Feig (who plays the small role of an American tourist). It tells of an 11-year-old boy (Ben Tibber), who has spent most or all of his life in a Bulgarian Soviet-style concentration camp, from which he escapes with instructions and a sealed letter from a mystery character whose identity is revealed only in the final scenes of the film. The story progresses through a series of flashbacks and progressive episodes following the child's escape from the camp.As a prisoner, David's only friend was Johannes (Jim Caviezel), whose character graces most if not all of the flashbacks to camp life. This kind, surrogate father instructs him on how to survive in the camp, and gives him the hopeful foundation for his subsequent quest to reach Denmark.Despite the uplifting story line--from prison to freedom, and despair to hope--and the superb acting and cinematography, the film doesn't quite meet the grade of a top notch flick. There is too much mystery surrounding the voice giving David instructions, and the film moves too slowly. There is also a slightly amateurish, soap opera quality that generally pervades inspirational films of this sort.That's a shame, because the post-war fate of millions in the Soviet and other communist block gulags is a ripe topic for exposure on film. But this one described the situation--there are bad people and good people--in overly simplistic terms.A nice try, but not quite there.--Alyssa A.

883071,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0007N19X2,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Now don't get me wrong: I love me a sweet sentimental story sometimes, but the only thing that recommends I am David over other Holocaust films like Schindler's List and The Boy With the Striped Pyjamas is an absolutely brilliant performance by Jim Caviezel.Caviezel is one of the best actors of his generation, an intense, charismatic, passionate and brilliant method actor who goes to extraordinary lengths to get a good performance (Caviezel endured hypothermia, pneumonia, and lightning strikes while filming The Passion of the Christ). No matter how poor the film, you can count on Caviezel; an endlessly cool and badass actor - to elevate the material.His performance in I am David is absolutely stunning. His accent is perfect, and Caviezel's character is the only one we feel emotionally connected to throughout the sentimental hodge-podge that is the film. I was just in awe of him every moment he was onscreen, all the way up to his haunting and intensely moving exit. Jim Caviezel is now one of my favourite actors.Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not hold up. Gorgeous cinematography, and the story is sweet, but I am David is a sad mess. From a reviewer's viewpoint, it is treacly, overtly sentimental, with wooden child actors, a silly, hole-filled plot, and lack of a good narrative. It's a great film for a night with your family, as young children will be engrossed in little David's struggle, but, aside from one electrifying performance...this is a movie for kids and no one else.

NORTH TO FREEDOM, as this film was released in America, is one of the best in quiet, deeply moving European-style film. Young 12-year-old David (Ben Tibber), presumably Jewish, escapes from a Russian concentration camp in Bulgaria, where he's lived most of his life. Jim Caviezel (Johanes) is his friend and teacher who takes the blame for a minor offense committed by David. When Johanes is shot for the offense, David escapes.A rucksack with David's ID papers, a knife, bread and a compass awaits him outside the gulag. On his adventures, he braves the ocean to sail to Italy, befriends an Italian sailor among others...and meets Sophie Anderson (the great Joan Plowright) near the Swiss border. Sophie, a kind English (presumably) lady, takes David in not long after his near-animadventure with a generous Italian family.Throughout the film, David keeps seeing a book that attracts him deeply. Sophie finally discovers that David is the main subject of the book--written by David's mother. The gulag, run by an old friend of David's mother's, was a sort of protective place for David. At the agreed time, everything was arranged by the gulag Captain for David's escape. It is his voice, not the assumed Caviezel, that we hear overlapping certain points of action. It is the gulag captain, not Johanes, who has instructed David to prepare him for his escape. With Sophie's help later on, he is flown to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet his mother.I love this film mostly because, like the great Russian film IVAN'S CHILDHOOD, it centers on a courageous young boy finding his way through war-torn countryside. Tibber is absolutely delightful, and one cannot help but fall in love with this child and long for him as a son.The tremendous presence of Joan Plowright really moves this film along at a quickening pace. I was saddened that it seemed suddenly cut to the end, a mere 90 minutes--as if they had run out of money and said, Time to go home. The others hand in splendid performances, though, like all such films, they are what I call ""significant near-cameos"". Still worth seeing.What you will not get here is lots of backstory; I'm still not sure whether these gulag people were Jews or general enemies of the Soviet state. Also it is difficult to place most of the character's cultural background, except of course the Italians and Russians. A bit sad, since Americans tend to like to know whom they are watching in film. Europeans are much less interested in that, and more interested in interpretation of mood and situation.Get it and appreciate what is there...you will never be sorry to have this gem in your collection.",5,"Tibber Shines, Does Bulgaria Proud",1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2663,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'came', 'late', 'film', 'NORTH', 'TO', 'FREEDOM', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'America', 'one', 'best', 'quiet', 'deeply', 'moving', 'European-style', 'film', '12-year-old', 'David', 'Ben', 'Tibber', 'presumably', 'Jewish', 'Russian', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Bulgaria', 'where', 'lived', 'most', 'life', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Johanes', 'friend', 'teacher', 'who', 'blame', 'minor', 'offense', 'committed', 'David', 'When', 'Johanes', 'shot', 'offense', 'David', 'rucksack', 'David', 'ID', 'papers', 'knife', 'bread', 'compass', 'gulag', 'adventures', 'ocean', 'sail', 'Italy', 'Italian', 'sailor', 'others', 'meets', 'Sophie', 'Anderson', 'great', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Swiss', 'border', 'Sophie', 'kind', 'English', 'presumably', 'lady', 'David', 'not', 'long', 'near-animadventure', 'generous', 'Italian', 'film', 'David', 'seeing', 'book', 'deeply', 'Sophie', 'finally', 'David', 'main', 'subject', 'book', 'written', 'David', 'mother', 'gulag', 'run', 'old', 'friend', 'David', 'mother', 'was', 'sort', 'protective', 'place', 'David', 'agreed', 'time', 'everything', 'was', 'arranged', 'gulag', 'Captain', 'David', 'escape', 'voice', 'not', 'assumed', 'Caviezel', 'hear', 'overlapping', 'certain', 'points', 'action', 'gulag', 'captain', 'not', 'Johanes', 'who', 'instructed', 'David', 'prepare', 'escape', 'Sophie', 'help', 'later', 'flown', 'Copenhagen', 'Denmark', 'meet', 'mother.I', 'love', 'film', 'mostly', 'great', 'Russian', 'film', 'IVAN', 'CHILDHOOD', 'courageous', 'young', 'boy', 'finding', 'way', 'war-torn', 'countryside', 'Tibber', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'child', 'long', 'son.The', 'tremendous', 'presence', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'really', 'film', 'along', 'quickening', 'pace', 'was', 'saddened', 'seemed', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'end', 'mere', '90', 'minutes', 'had', 'run', 'money', 'said', 'Time', 'go', 'home', 'others', 'hand', 'splendid', 'performances', 'though', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'what', 'call', 'significant', 'near-cameos', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing.What', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'lots', 'backstory', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'gulag', 'people', 'were', 'Jews', 'general', 'enemies', 'Soviet', 'state', 'Also', 'difficult', 'place', 'most', 'character', 'cultural', 'background', 'course', 'Italians', 'Russians', 'bit', 'sad', 'Americans', 'tend', 'like', 'know', 'whom', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'Europeans', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'interested', 'more', 'interested', 'interpretation', 'mood', 'situation.Get', 'appreciate', 'what', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'sorry', 'have', 'gem', 'collection']",N/A

This journey becomes one of healing, and the film's slow pace, frequent close-ups of David's face, and beautiful scenes of the European countryside make the healing believable.  Interspersed with the events that befall him along the way are flashbacks to David's life in the camp, in particular the episode when his adult friend Johannes is shot by a guard after his confession to stealing a bar of soap that was actually taken by David.  David has to heal not only from the grief of losing his family and then this trusted friend, from the cruelty of prison guards and the harsh conditions of camp life, in short from a childhood seemingly without hope, he also has to heal from the guilt of causing his friend's death.  Luckily, he encounters on his journey a few people who are touched by his natural goodness and offer him kindness.  Memories of his capture and of his family begin to return as he gets farther away from his camp experiencem and he begins to learn how to smile apparently for the first time in his sad life.The film is moving because it is so unthinkable that all of a child's early life might be spent under such harsh conditions.  And because it is hard to imagine how a child would emerge so uncorrupted by that environment.[I write this not having read the children's book on which the film is based.]",5,Healing the heart on the road to freedom,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1583,"['boy', 'threshold', 'adolescence', 'given', 'task', 'escaping', 'labor', 'camp', 'Bulgaria', 'early', 'days', 'Communist', 'rule', 'stowing', 'away', 'ship', 'Italy', 'then', 'making', 'way', 'north', 'deliver', 'sealed', 'envelope', 'border', 'guards', 'Denmark', 'journey', 'one', 'healing', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'frequent', 'close-ups', 'David', 'face', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'European', 'countryside', 'make', 'healing', 'believable', 'Interspersed', 'events', 'befall', 'way', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'David', 'life', 'camp', 'particular', 'episode', 'when', 'adult', 'friend', 'Johannes', 'shot', 'guard', 'confession', 'stealing', 'bar', 'soap', 'was', 'actually', 'taken', 'David', 'David', 'heal', 'not', 'only', 'grief', 'losing', 'family', 'then', 'trusted', 'friend', 'cruelty', 'prison', 'guards', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'camp', 'life', 'short', 'childhood', 'seemingly', 'hope', 'also', 'heal', 'guilt', 'causing', 'friend', 'death', 'Luckily', 'journey', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'touched', 'natural', 'goodness', 'offer', 'kindness', 'Memories', 'capture', 'family', 'begin', 'return', 'farther', 'away', 'camp', 'experiencem', 'learn', 'how', 'smile', 'apparently', 'first', 'time', 'sad', 'life.The', 'film', 'moving', 'so', 'unthinkable', 'child', 'early', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'spent', 'such', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'child', 'would', 'emerge', 'so', 'uncorrupted', 'environment', '[', 'write', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'children', 'book', 'film', 'based', ']']",N/A

883092,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007N19X2,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","Adapted from Danish writer Anne Holm's 1963 best selling novel 'David' (translated into English in 1965 as 'I Am David') and written for the screen adaptation by Director Paul Feig, this film is one of conviction on the part of all those involved to re-create the odyssey of a child into the throes of the world and all that that entails.  It is a story of hope, determination, and discovery and avoids being mawkish in favor of maintaining a quiet, progressively interesting journey of the heart and the mind.David (Ben Tibber) is eleven years old and has live his entire life in a camp in Bulgaria, one of Stalin's Gulag Archipelago points of detention for the many who eventually died after WW II, not in Nazi camps but in the lesser known but equally severe Soviet counterparts.  Having only lived as a prisoner with a single friend Johannes (Jim Caviezel) to guide his growth and be a surrogate parent/family, David has no concept of the world outside the confine of the camp. He is given a letter by an off screen voice with the instructions on how to escape the camp and go to Denmark to deliver this important document.David follows instructions, escapes the camp with the advice to trust no one and to blend in with the crowd for safety, and soon he begins to encounter the people of the outside world.  Too frightened to trust anyone, David crosses into Salonika and eventually boards a ship bound for Italy 'befriended' by an Italian worker, swims ashore in Italy, is offered small jobs by American tourists (Paul Feig and Lucy Russell) and Italian shopkeepers, and encounters a wealthy family in his brave and successful rescue of a girl from a burning house.  He is treated well, yet fears connection and knows his assignment and again is on the road toward Denmark.  Provided transportation to Milan by the Italian ship worker, David eventually in his walking journey finds Sophie (Joan Plowright) painting in the hills by Lake Como.  Sophie is the first maternal figure he has encountered and provides David with safe passage to her home in Switzerland.  David's fears are gently assuaged by Sophie and when Sophie discovers the contents of the envelope David has so cautiously been guarding, the contents yield the information that results in David's completing his journey to Denmark in an airplane courtesy of Sophie.  The raison d'etre of the story is revealed in these last frames.The cast is uniformly excellent: Ben Tibber is a fine little actor with minimal experience, Jim Caviezel gives his best performance (though very small) since 'Frequency', and Joan Plowright adds the right dimension of professional glow to her radiant portrayal of Sophie.  The many smaller cast members are  genuine and memorable and the pacing of the film by Feig is on target.  Roman Osin is the superb cinematographer: he has captured the dank stench of the camp as well as the many vistas of the glorious landscape of Italy and Bulgaria with finesse.  The musical score by Stewart Copeland (with a little help from Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus'!) is enhancing and in keeping with the multiple locales of David's journey.  In all this is a heartwarming, beautifully executed film that holds true to Holm's beloved book for young people.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, some of which are splendid, and an extended history of the Gulag Archipelago and the making of the film.  A first rate package.

883100,ABHBURBXUZFF8,B0007N19X2,Kurt Miller,"[1, 1]","I am David is a historical fiction film based on Anne Holm's novel of the same name and directed by Paul Feig.  The plot involves a Bulgarian concentration camp prisoner named David and his attempt to escape to Denmark. I won't spoil anymore.Ben Tibber is good in the leading role but it the adult actors who really make the magic of the film. Jim Cavizel gives a beautifully low-key performance as David's best friend and serves as a sort of guardian angel figure. Francesco di Vito plays a character David meets a couple times and has some humorous moments to lighten the relatively bleak atmosphere of the film. But best of all is Joan Plowright as Sophie who should have recieved a Best Supporting Actress nomination. She is a very kind, sweet grandmotherly woman whom David eventually confides in. Probably her finest moments were.1.) When she's painting his portrait. ""I'm having such trouble with your eyes. Such serious eyes. Such a serious face.""2.) ""Now, stand back and tell me what the picture says to you. I see a very intelligent, very serious person. But there's something about the eyes--such sad serious eyes--but's that all I know because he doesn't want to let anyone in""3.) When she's lying to the border guard, trying to make an excuse for letting them pass without his identification cards. ""Couldn't you just relax the rules a little? All he wants to do is come into your country, overthrow your government and rush right out of it.""4.) When David tells her he works in the circus. ""The CIRCUS?"" (Startled expression) ""Oh...well...that must be VERY interesting."" The look in her eyes as she sips her tea while saying this line is priceless.5.) ""I wouldn't DREAM of turning you into anybody for any reason. David you don't have to tell me anything. I just want you to know that you're quite safe here and everything is going to be allright.""I really liked how the plot is interrupted by a series of flashbacks from David's life and how at the end they all come together and make sense like the pieces of a puzzle. It's a very original, innovative technique that works quite well here.There's only two things I wish were different:1. When David tells Sophie everything at the bookstore we get another shot of them leaving in a hurry. They could have shown David telling her everything but have the dialogue muted and only the music rolling. A close up of Joan Plowright's face during her reaction would have been an excellent touch.2. When they get to the police station, Sophie gives the man behind the counter David's identification cards and he dials a telephone. Wouldn't it have been an awesome touch to show the blond woman (from the flashbacks) pick it up and see her reaction--possibly an outburst of joyful tears or a fainting fit?The costumes and sets are wonderfully detailed (especially the mansion in Italy) and the Academy should smack themselves for not even nominating the cienematography.All in all a very interesting, fascinating and excellent movie.",5,"""Remember, trust no one.""",1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,2988,"['am', 'David', 'historical', 'fiction', 'film', 'based', 'Anne', 'Holm', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'plot', 'Bulgarian', 'concentration', 'camp', 'prisoner', 'named', 'David', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Denmark', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anymore.Ben', 'Tibber', 'good', 'leading', 'role', 'adult', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'magic', 'film', 'Jim', 'Cavizel', 'beautifully', 'low-key', 'performance', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'sort', 'guardian', 'angel', 'figure', 'Francesco', 'di', 'Vito', 'character', 'David', 'couple', 'times', 'humorous', 'moments', 'lighten', 'relatively', 'bleak', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'best', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Sophie', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'recieved', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'very', 'kind', 'sweet', 'grandmotherly', 'woman', 'whom', 'David', 'eventually', 'Probably', 'finest', 'moments', 'were.1', 'When', 'painting', 'portrait', ""'m"", 'having', 'such', 'trouble', 'eyes', 'Such', 'serious', 'eyes', 'serious', 'face.', '2', 'Now', 'stand', 'back', 'tell', 'what', 'picture', 'see', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'serious', 'person', 'something', 'eyes', 'such', 'sad', 'serious', 'eyes', 'know', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'anyone', '3', 'When', 'lying', 'border', 'guard', 'trying', 'make', 'excuse', 'letting', 'pass', 'identification', 'cards', 'Could', ""n't"", 'just', 'relax', 'rules', 'little', 'do', 'come', 'country', 'overthrow', 'government', 'rush', 'right', 'it.', '4', 'When', 'David', 'circus', 'CIRCUS', 'Startled', 'expression', 'Oh', 'well', 'must', 'be', 'VERY', 'interesting', 'look', 'eyes', 'tea', 'saying', 'line', 'priceless.5', 'would', ""n't"", 'DREAM', 'turning', 'anybody', 'reason', 'David', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'anything', 'just', 'want', 'know', ""'re"", 'quite', 'safe', 'here', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'allright', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'plot', 'interrupted', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'David', 'life', 'how', 'end', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'very', 'original', 'innovative', 'technique', 'quite', 'well', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'wish', 'were', 'different:1', 'When', 'David', 'Sophie', 'everything', 'bookstore', 'get', 'shot', 'leaving', 'hurry', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'David', 'telling', 'everything', 'have', 'dialogue', 'muted', 'only', 'music', 'rolling', 'close', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'face', 'reaction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'touch.2', 'When', 'get', 'police', 'station', 'Sophie', 'man', 'counter', 'David', 'identification', 'cards', 'telephone', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'touch', 'show', 'blond', 'woman', 'flashbacks', 'pick', 'up', 'see', 'reaction', 'possibly', 'outburst', 'joyful', 'tears', 'fainting', 'fit', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'especially', 'mansion', 'Italy', 'Academy', 'should', 'smack', 'not', 'even', 'nominating', 'cienematography.All', 'very', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

For me, this film was a total treat.  I found it completely engaging & loved it from first to last.  Newcomer Ben Tibber carries the movie.  This is a pretty incredible feat for a child actor in his first film.  His lost and haunted David breaks your heart and touches it as when he tries to learn to smile.  The deleted scenes on DVD show a sequence where he traps a rabbit because he's so hungry & then lets it go.  Jim Caviezel who made me a fan when he played Catch in ""Angel Eyes"" with Jennifer Lopez is a supporting actor here.  He gives quiet support to David and eventually gives his life for him, as we learn in flashback.  Krassimir Kutzuparov is the mysterious camp commandant who we learn had a crush on David' mother & looks after him and eventually engineers his escape.  His mysterious presence adds greatly to the film.  In David's travels, he escapes to Greece, boards a freight ship as a stowaway to Italy and eventually winds up with Swiss painter Sophie played by Joan Plowright.  Plowright's loan Oscar nomination was for ""Enchanted April"" in 1992, but she adds real class and a moral conscience to the film.  By the final revelation that leads to David's restoration to Denmark, my wife & I were both reaching for a tissue at the same time.  This film works incredibly well.

Few even dreamed of escaping.David did.In Paul Feig's new film, we traverse much of Europe with 12-year-old David as he impossibly tries to make his way from Bulgaria to Denmark. Both his ultimate destination and the essence of his journey are a mystery to us and him.""I Am David"" is a sweet, touching film that finds its emotional punch in the small, tender moments.The hungry, tired and scared David stows away on a ship, scrounges for food, is temporarily befriended by a rich Italian family, and finds a savior of sorts in an elderly woman (Joan Plowright), who likes to paint and can read David's story in his sad, serious eyes. It is based on the young-adult novel by Anne Holm, first published in 1963, and known in America as ""North to Freedom.""In the crucial lead role stands young Ben Tibber, who does a marvelous job even though the filmmakers let him speak perfect King's English with a British accent despite spending much of his life behind bars in Bulgaria. Through flashbacks we see the lessons David learned from his mentor in the camp, Johannes (Jim Caviezel in a brief but effective role).All David has known is brutality and abuse. He has been taught to trust no one. How, then, can he reconcile the beauty of forests, mountains, seas and fields of flowers? He has to learn to trust, and trust himself to feel happy.The film could have veered too much into ""After School Special"" sentiment, but Tibber is such a cutie you root for him no matter what.David's simple pleasure of stroking a cat, or getting a hug, reach out far beyond the screen.

As a child I read the book and could not remember all of it so was pleasantly surprised by this independent effort from director Paul Feig. David (Ben Tibber) is a 12 year old prisoner in a Bulgarian Gulag and the year is 1952. He can only ever remember life in the camp, but has fleeting memories of someone he knows loved him, but he can not seem to articulate why. The past is revealed in flash backs throughout the film and adds layers to the storyIn the camp he has a friend Johannes -Jim Caviezel - who has very little on screen time actually. Life in the camp is unremitting and awful, so David is helped to escape. He has a sealed letter and is told to search for a bundle outside the fence. In it he finds some bread, water, a compass and a penknife. He is told to get to Salonika and then keep heading north until he gets to Denmark. There is one part when the truck he is hiding in gets stopped by the State Police and the other free riders are chucked off - the police says `You want to escape this paradise?' I am pretty sure that he is being sarcastic.Any way David has to live by his wits and meets many people along the way, realising that sometimes you can trust and other times you most certainly can not. Ben Tibber does a great performance as David, who has to learn a lot of normal things even how to smile. In the book he has learnt a lot of languages from being in the camp, this he uses to blend in with the people he comes across, it is done all in English in the film with a nod that they are speaking another tongue - which may annoy some people, but it avoids sub titles. Along the way he discovers religion and a lot more besides.This is a well made and acted independent film that was made with a lot of love.

Despite the very misleading DVD cover, Jim Cavielzel appears as supporting actor, and his scenes are scattered in the flashback scenes.So David the hero of the film is played by child actor Ben Tibber.  The setting is in 1952, in Bulgaria, and the film begins like the climax of 'The Great Escape.'  12-year-old boy David escapes from the concentration camp, guided by a mysterious voiceover whose identity is not revealed until the ending.  David is instructed to go to the north, to Denmark, and is also given a small package to deliver.Outside the camp he meets many people, whom David cannot trust.  But the point of this film is not about his safety, or the results of his great escape (the film is not meant to be an action film).  The point is about how David, long living a hard life in the camp, comes to trust the good will of other people, and learn to smile again like an ordinary boy does.  Jim Caviezel and Joan Plowright play the key characters who help David learn a few precious things about life.'I Am David' is based on the children's book of the same title, published in 1963 in Denmark.  Two years later it was translated in English under the title of 'North to Freedom,' and after about 40 years later it was taken up by Paul Feig, a man behind the short-lived but critically acclaimed cult TV show 'Freaks and Geeks.'I wrote these things because they illustrate the nature of the film, and explain the reasons for the flaws in the script.  In spite of the intriguing historical setting in Bulgaria and Italy, the politics shown here are vague, and the descriptions of the concentration camp lacks substance.  But if you take the target audiences into consideration, which must be younger than 12 year old, this lukewarm treatments may be excused.  Rather it is the melodramatic episodes seen here and there that are real problems.  At one scene, David saves a young girl from a buring cottage, who happens to be tied (literally) to a chair.  Who did that?  Before you know the answer, the film goes on, pushing forward David into another episode, in which very unlikely things would happen to him again.Paul Feig keeps the ball rolling, but I am afraid, considering the suggested tradegy in Bulgaria, the smooth pace rather does disservice to the film.  In short, it's too good to be true, even though the story is told as allegory.  I admit the film is made with good intentions, and the supporting actors are all good, especially Caviezel and Maria Bonnevie ('Reconstruction') as David's mother, but 'I Am David' remains unsatisfactory, leaving out something substantial historically or allegorically.",3,Well-Intentioned and Entertaining But Lacks Substance,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,2729,"['may', 'be', 'interested', 'Am', 'David', 'one', ""pre-'Passion"", 'Christ', 'film', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'very', 'misleading', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Jim', 'Cavielzel', 'supporting', 'actor', 'scenes', 'are', 'scattered', 'flashback', 'scenes.So', 'David', 'hero', 'film', 'played', 'child', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Tibber', 'setting', '1952', 'Bulgaria', 'film', 'climax', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Escape', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'David', 'concentration', 'camp', 'guided', 'mysterious', 'voiceover', 'identity', 'not', 'revealed', 'ending', 'David', 'instructed', 'go', 'north', 'Denmark', 'also', 'given', 'small', 'package', 'deliver.Outside', 'camp', 'many', 'people', 'whom', 'David', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'safety', 'results', 'great', 'escape', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'action', 'film', 'point', 'how', 'David', 'long', 'living', 'hard', 'life', 'camp', 'trust', 'good', 'will', 'other', 'people', 'learn', 'smile', 'again', 'ordinary', 'boy', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'play', 'key', 'characters', 'who', 'help', 'David', 'learn', 'few', 'precious', 'things', 'life', 'Am', 'David', 'based', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'published', '1963', 'Denmark', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'translated', 'English', 'title', ""'North"", 'Freedom', '40', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'taken', 'up', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'man', 'short-lived', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'cult', 'TV', 'show', ""'Freaks"", 'Geeks', 'wrote', 'things', 'illustrate', 'nature', 'film', 'explain', 'reasons', 'flaws', 'script', 'spite', 'intriguing', 'historical', 'setting', 'Bulgaria', 'Italy', 'politics', 'shown', 'here', 'are', 'vague', 'descriptions', 'concentration', 'camp', 'substance', 'take', 'target', 'audiences', 'consideration', 'must', 'be', 'younger', '12', 'year', 'old', 'lukewarm', 'treatments', 'may', 'be', 'excused', 'melodramatic', 'episodes', 'seen', 'here', 'there', 'are', 'real', 'problems', 'one', 'scene', 'David', 'young', 'girl', 'buring', 'cottage', 'who', 'be', 'tied', 'literally', 'chair', 'Who', 'did', 'know', 'answer', 'film', 'pushing', 'forward', 'David', 'episode', 'very', 'unlikely', 'things', 'would', 'happen', 'again.Paul', 'Feig', 'ball', 'rolling', 'am', 'afraid', 'considering', 'suggested', 'tradegy', 'Bulgaria', 'smooth', 'pace', 'rather', 'disservice', 'film', 'short', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'even', 'story', 'told', 'allegory', 'admit', 'film', 'made', 'good', 'intentions', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Caviezel', 'Maria', 'Bonnevie', ""'Reconstruction"", 'David', 'mother', 'Am', 'David', 'unsatisfactory', 'leaving', 'out', 'something', 'substantial', 'historically', 'allegorically']",N/A
883123,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0007N19X2,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[3, 3]","I Am David was one of the first films produced by the newly formed, family-oriented production company, Walden Media. In my opinion, it is still one of their best to date. Based on the novel by Anne Holm, it is the story of a boy (Ben Tibber) who is separated from his family in post-WWII, communist Bulgaria, and has to grow up in a concentration camp helping to break rocks all day. His only friend is a man named Johannes (Jim Caviezel), who encourages him not to give up hope, because as long as he's alive, he can change things. One day that advice pays off when a way of escape is made available. Through an elaborate series of instructions given by the voice of a man never identified until the end of the film, David makes his way south from Bulgaria to Italy by ship, and then north through the Italian countryside until he reaches Switzerland.Along the way, he meets a variety of interesting people. But he is very cautious, especially of people in uniform, because he has been warned not to trust anyone. Almost everything is new to him - including taking a bath! He is constantly trying to buy food, but doesn't understand how to get money or how much is required. Luckily, because the concentration camp included people of many different nationalities, he understands a variety of languages and so he is able to communicate. But one thing he does not know how to do is smile. Finally, he does meet someone that is able to make him smile, and this amazes him.This is a very charming film with gorgeous photography - you can imagine how gorgeous being shot in Italy - and a sweet story, not unlike The Black Stallion (1979) - without the horse, of course. It also reminds me of the film A Boy Ten Feet Tall (aka, Sammy Going South - 1963), which I saw when I was a boy. There is something about a boy trekking across a continent on his own that holds your attention. In A Boy Ten Feet Tall, he is traveling across Africa. So, it isn't as charming as David's trip, and far more hair-raising. But I Am David has its moments of angst.Near-first-time director Paul Feig does an outstanding job on the script and direction, which earned the film the Heartland Film Festival Crystal Heart Award, among others. What I have yet to mention is that when David reaches the Italian Alps, he meets an artist named Sophie (Joan Plowright) who is the first person he feels he can trust since Johannes. It is while he is with her that an incredible secret is revealed, which of course I won't say any more about. But let me just say that it is worth the wait. His time with Sophie is my favorite part of the film. She reminded me of my own grandmother.I hope Walden Media does more intimate films like this one, and doesn't get carried away with the big blockbusters, now that Prince Caspian has opened the door for them.
