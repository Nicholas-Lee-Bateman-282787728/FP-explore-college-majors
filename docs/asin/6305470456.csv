From here the presentation deviates with an overlay of a minor observer that smirks as he views the scenes.Only occasionally moving a play to a different time or place can it keep its magic. This presentation is of no real time or place but seems to have borrowed from the junk left over from previous plays, containing part stage and part Victorian England, with a dash of Alice in Wonderland.Lots of nice color and music. However everyone goes around kissing everyone but the person they should be kissing; you can call it artistic license but I call it a distraction for the purpose or base story. For those people that do not like the introduction of bicycles and nudity as in another version, take heart as there is no nudity or bicycles. The bicycles are replaced with Mary Poppins type umbrellas. O.K I lied there is the E.T. bicycle scene, motorcycles with sidecars motorcycles.Usually this tail is played out by well know actors so I must confess that even though this is the Royal Shakespeare Company production I do not recognize anyone.One big missing part is where Nick Bottom is transferred into a donkey. Too bad as that is one of the best parts. He just pops put with ears and teeth. That is like showing Hamlet without Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.You need to watch any other production before this one as ""Who would not change a raven for a dove?""Lindsay Duncan as Hippolyta/TitaniaAlex Jennings as Theseus/OberonDesmond Barrit as Nick BottomBarry Lynch as Puck/PhilostrateThe Lovers:Hermia - Monica DolanDemetrius - Kevin DoyleLysander - Daniel EvansHelena - Emily RaymondEgeus - Alfred BurkeThe boy - Osheen Jones",3,A most superfluous version,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1709,"['words', 'are', 'there', 'pacing', 'appropriate', 'where', 'here', 'presentation', 'overlay', 'minor', 'observer', 'scenes.Only', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'play', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'can', 'keep', 'magic', 'presentation', 'real', 'time', 'place', 'have', 'borrowed', 'junk', 'left', 'over', 'previous', 'plays', 'containing', 'part', 'stage', 'part', 'Victorian', 'England', 'dash', 'Alice', 'Wonderland.Lots', 'nice', 'color', 'music', 'However', 'everyone', 'kissing', 'everyone', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'kissing', 'can', 'call', 'artistic', 'license', 'call', 'distraction', 'purpose', 'base', 'story', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'introduction', 'bicycles', 'nudity', 'version', 'take', 'heart', 'nudity', 'bicycles', 'bicycles', 'are', 'replaced', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'type', 'umbrellas', 'O.K', 'lied', 'E.T', 'bicycle', 'scene', 'sidecars', 'motorcycles.Usually', 'tail', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'know', 'actors', 'must', 'confess', 'even', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'production', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'anyone.One', 'big', 'missing', 'part', 'where', 'Nick', 'Bottom', 'transferred', 'donkey', 'Too', 'bad', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'just', 'put', 'ears', 'teeth', 'showing', 'Hamlet', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern.You', 'need', 'watch', 'other', 'production', 'one', 'Who', 'would', 'not', 'change', 'raven', 'dove', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'Hippolyta/TitaniaAlex', 'Jennings', 'Theseus/OberonDesmond', 'Barrit', 'Nick', 'BottomBarry', 'Lynch', 'Puck/PhilostrateThe', 'Lovers', 'Hermia', 'Monica', 'DolanDemetrius', 'Kevin', 'DoyleLysander', 'Daniel', 'EvansHelena', 'Emily', 'RaymondEgeus', 'Alfred', 'BurkeThe', 'boy', 'Osheen', 'Jones']",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS

Marold""","[1, 2]","This is the fourth rendition of Shakespeare's play I have seen on the small screen, and it is possibly the best so far, with the one reservation that it emphasizes one aspect of the play which I am not sure the Bard would have made quite so weighty. It is filled with modern gimmicks used to emphasize this aspect (which I am not revealing, should that be a ""spoiler"" for some.)One of the gimmicks in the play is that Theseus and Hippolyta are played by the same actors as Oberon and Titania and the Puck / Robin Goodfellow actor also plays Philostrate, the master of the revels. These fit, each for a different reason. The story is primarily about four pairs of men and women, and their relations, so it is a neat conceit to have two of those pair played by the same actors (although the costuming and makeup effectively hid that fact until I saw the credits.) I recognized the Puck / Philostrate dual role easily, partly because those who know the play easily think of Puck as the major domo of the entire story, not just the play within a play.Of the three main stories in the play, this version gives more attention to the story of the fairies and to the plot with the six ""mechanicals"" than it does to the story of the four young lovers. This is accentuated by the fact that Lysander and Demetrius wear similar garb, almost like a uniform, in order to add credence to part of the Puck / Oberon business.The story of the ""mechanicals"", especially the role of Bottom, is not quite up to the realization of that role by the cast of the 1999 Hollywood version, with Kevin Kline as Bottom, although overall, I prefer this film to the Hollywood version. There is something very reminiscent of the ballet in the way the business of the actors is blocked out, with surreal props of doors without walls and light bulbs hanging from bare wires to act as the stars. Oberon, Titania, and Puck are done better than in the Hollywood version.This version clearly adds to Puck's final monologue things which were cut from the Hollywood version, just as it cuts speeches from the story of the four young lovers.It is almost impossible to recommend this over the Hollywood version, which is easier to understand and follow, especially with all the familiar faces in the main roles. The Hollywood version has a better balance between the three stories, which means that the peril faced by Hermia is given its proper importance; although this version does a better job at showing the effect this situation has on the relation between Hippolyta and Theseus. I would watch the Hollywood version first, then watch this version.",5,Emphasizes one aspect of the play,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2609,"['fourth', 'rendition', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'have', 'seen', 'small', 'screen', 'possibly', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'reservation', 'one', 'aspect', 'play', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Bard', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'quite', 'so', 'weighty', 'filled', 'modern', 'gimmicks', 'used', 'emphasize', 'aspect', 'am', 'not', 'revealing', 'should', 'be', 'spoiler', 'One', 'gimmicks', 'play', 'Theseus', 'Hippolyta', 'are', 'played', 'same', 'actors', 'Oberon', 'Titania', 'Puck', '/', 'Robin', 'Goodfellow', 'actor', 'also', 'Philostrate', 'master', 'revels', 'fit', 'different', 'reason', 'story', 'primarily', 'four', 'pairs', 'men', 'women', 'relations', 'neat', 'conceit', 'have', 'two', 'pair', 'played', 'same', 'actors', 'costuming', 'makeup', 'effectively', 'fact', 'saw', 'credits', 'recognized', 'Puck', '/', 'Philostrate', 'dual', 'role', 'easily', 'partly', 'who', 'know', 'play', 'easily', 'think', 'Puck', 'major', 'domo', 'entire', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'play', 'play.Of', 'three', 'main', 'stories', 'play', 'version', 'more', 'attention', 'story', 'fairies', 'plot', 'six', 'mechanicals', 'story', 'four', 'young', 'lovers', 'accentuated', 'fact', 'Lysander', 'Demetrius', 'wear', 'similar', 'garb', 'almost', 'uniform', 'order', 'add', 'credence', 'part', 'Puck', '/', 'Oberon', 'business.The', 'story', 'mechanicals', 'especially', 'role', 'Bottom', 'not', 'quite', 'realization', 'role', 'cast', '1999', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Bottom', 'overall', 'prefer', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'something', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'ballet', 'way', 'business', 'actors', 'blocked', 'out', 'surreal', 'props', 'doors', 'walls', 'light', 'bulbs', 'hanging', 'bare', 'wires', 'act', 'stars', 'Oberon', 'Titania', 'Puck', 'are', 'done', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'version.This', 'version', 'clearly', 'Puck', 'final', 'monologue', 'things', 'were', 'cut', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'just', 'speeches', 'story', 'four', 'young', 'lovers.It', 'almost', 'impossible', 'recommend', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'easier', 'understand', 'follow', 'especially', 'familiar', 'main', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'better', 'balance', 'three', 'stories', 'peril', 'faced', 'Hermia', 'given', 'proper', 'importance', 'version', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'effect', 'situation', 'relation', 'Hippolyta', 'Theseus', 'would', 'watch', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'version']",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS
465952,AS5OHRD21JDCT,6305470456,bzcarin,"[2, 7]","I was looking for a production of our favorite play to show our small Shakespeare Club after we finished reading it aloud.  I really liked the stage aspect of this production.  I thought the scenes with the craftsman working on the play was fun and my students would gain perspective from seeing how these actors interpreted their roles.  Their drive to the woods was fun.  Also, I thought it innovative for Theseus to also play Oberion. This was true for several of the actors (including the Queen).  The sparse sets were interesting- I liked the use of doors to demonstrate comings and goings in the woods (and used elsewhere in the play).  This left things up to the imagination of the viewer but also left us to concentrate on the actor and his/her lines. There is a modern day boy who is shown first thing and then later throughout the entire production....one gets the impression that he is having the dream of Midsummer Night's Dream.  I thought this was really interesting.  The play scene done by the craftsman is fun to watch but it was marred by my wondering the whole time if the director was going to insert another sex scene.Why I rated it so low..... Nearly from the beginning, I didn't feel the comedy aspect of this play.  For my purposes, I was looking for a production tha's &#34;clean&#34;.  It doesn't have to be the most traditional version.  So, while I wanted to see that sparkle of fun, it wasn't the most important factor.  The first indications that this was not to be the right one was near the beginning. There was a kiss between Helena and Hermia and then later one between Puck and Oberion.  Kissing as means of a greeting and goodbye would have been quite appropriate but these were mouth to mouth.  It gave me the impression that the director was trying to inject more sensuality.  Why?  Overall, Puck was played in a very sensual manner.  However, the most disturbing part of this production was the scene with Queen Titania and Bottom though.  As Puck and Oberion and the other fairies look on, Bottom and the Queen have sex.  Really?  Where's the comedy in that?  And, this just does not seem to follow the spirit of Bottom's character.If this was my first time to see Shakespeare, I wouldn't want to see more.",1,Not for my kids,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2246,"['was', 'looking', 'production', 'favorite', 'play', 'show', 'small', 'Shakespeare', 'Club', 'finished', 'reading', 'aloud', 'really', 'liked', 'stage', 'aspect', 'production', 'thought', 'scenes', 'craftsman', 'working', 'play', 'was', 'fun', 'students', 'would', 'gain', 'perspective', 'seeing', 'how', 'actors', 'interpreted', 'roles', 'drive', 'woods', 'was', 'fun', 'Also', 'thought', 'innovative', 'Theseus', 'also', 'play', 'Oberion', 'was', 'true', 'several', 'actors', 'including', 'Queen', 'sparse', 'sets', 'were', 'interesting-', 'liked', 'use', 'doors', 'demonstrate', 'comings', 'goings', 'woods', 'used', 'elsewhere', 'play', 'left', 'things', 'up', 'imagination', 'viewer', 'also', 'left', 'concentrate', 'actor', 'his/her', 'lines', 'modern', 'day', 'boy', 'who', 'shown', 'first', 'thing', 'then', 'later', 'entire', 'production', '.one', 'impression', 'having', 'dream', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'play', 'scene', 'done', 'craftsman', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'marred', 'wondering', 'whole', 'time', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'insert', 'sex', 'scene.Why', 'rated', 'so', 'low', '..', 'Nearly', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'play', 'purposes', 'was', 'looking', 'production', 'tha', '34', 'clean', '34', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'most', 'traditional', 'version', 'So', 'wanted', 'see', 'sparkle', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'factor', 'first', 'indications', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'one', 'was', 'beginning', 'was', 'kiss', 'Helena', 'Hermia', 'then', 'later', 'one', 'Puck', 'Oberion', 'Kissing', 'means', 'greeting', 'goodbye', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'were', 'mouth', 'mouth', 'gave', 'impression', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'inject', 'more', 'sensuality', 'Why', 'Overall', 'Puck', 'was', 'played', 'very', 'sensual', 'manner', 'However', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'production', 'was', 'scene', 'Queen', 'Titania', 'Bottom', 'though', 'Puck', 'Oberion', 'other', 'fairies', 'look', 'Bottom', 'Queen', 'have', 'sex', 'Really', 'Where', 'comedy', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'follow', 'spirit', 'Bottom', 'character.If', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Shakespeare', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'more']",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS

While I certainly liked other aspects of the experience, as a whole it left me a little cold.  Much of this, I suspect, lies in severity of the cuts, most evident in the handling of the main plot (the Oberon/Titania quarrel is a sub-plot, after all-- although one wouldn't know it from this adaptation).  True, there's not much difference between Demetrius and Lysander (which is sort of the point, I suppose), but, in this production at least, I never cared at all for Hermia and missed Helena's comic self-pity (trimmed as it was).  To be even more frank, I didn't find one of the four principal lovers' performances to be more than competent (although one should not take even this for granted in a filmed production), much less memorable.  Others have spoken derisively of the boy's dream that frames the play, but I thought it was an interesting conceit, if not terribly original.  For the life of me I can't understand why it is so controversial here since he speaks no lines, and his presence allows for some very interesting point-of-view shifts.  On the whole, I would recommend it, but as far as filmed adaptations go, I probably still prefer the (slightly stodgy) BBC filmed production from the early 80s (which, it will be admitted, has a host of problems of its own).  In terms of imagination of conception, however, this one is truly remarkable and should not be missed by fans of the play (everyone, I hope).",4,"Beautifully imagined, if a little cold",1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,1571,"['What', 'one', 'away', 'production', 'triumph', 'artistic', 'direction', 'splendid', 'performance', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'Oberon/Theseus', 'certainly', 'liked', 'other', 'aspects', 'experience', 'whole', 'left', 'little', 'cold', 'Much', 'suspect', 'severity', 'cuts', 'most', 'evident', 'handling', 'main', 'plot', 'Oberon/Titania', 'quarrel', 'sub-plot', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'adaptation', 'True', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'Demetrius', 'Lysander', 'sort', 'point', 'suppose', 'production', 'least', 'never', 'cared', 'Hermia', 'missed', 'Helena', 'comic', 'self-pity', 'trimmed', 'was', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'frank', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'four', 'principal', 'lovers', 'performances', 'be', 'more', 'competent', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'even', 'granted', 'filmed', 'production', 'much', 'less', 'memorable', 'Others', 'have', 'spoken', 'derisively', 'boy', 'dream', 'play', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'conceit', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'controversial', 'here', 'lines', 'presence', 'very', 'interesting', 'point-of-view', 'shifts', 'whole', 'would', 'recommend', 'as', 'far', 'filmed', 'adaptations', 'go', 'probably', 'still', 'prefer', 'slightly', 'stodgy', 'BBC', 'filmed', 'production', 'early', '80s', 'will', 'be', 'admitted', 'host', 'problems', 'own', 'terms', 'imagination', 'conception', 'however', 'one', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'fans', 'play', 'everyone', 'hope']",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS

I was espcially glad to see that the &quot;forest of light&quot; set wasn't omitted--just as stunning on film as it was live.The cast here is top-notch. A number of the leads are Olivier Award winners, and it's easy to see why. Alex Jennings (Oberon/Theseus) is a treasure--as Oberon, he is commanding and masterful; and Barry Lynch is an impish, sexy Puck. All of the mechanicals are splendid, especially Desmond Barrit as Bottom. Among the lovers, Emily Raymond stands out--she really works to make Helena into a unique and sympathetic character. The actors here actually USE Shakespeare's words, instead of reciting them as poetry. How wonderful that all of these performances were preserved on film!Having said that, I was surprised by some of the changes made to the production for this video. For one, why is the young boy included? During a few of the scenes, the camera is so focused on his reactions that the dialogue is pushed into the background.

It put some new twists into a centuries-old play and made it so hilarious in the process, but not by altering the story or anchoring it in an incorrect time period. In fact, there are many periods mixed together here and it works well as a ""dream"". They didn't have to add the part of the little boy; he was not in the original stage production, and he detracted from the story. I wish they had left the play alone and not added sets (Theseus' palace, the boy's home, the Rude Mechanicals' rehearsal area) that weren't in the original. They seemed out of place and took away from the magical atmosphere that was, fortunately, still there in the fairies' forest. I loved it that they kept the lightbulbs!",4,Better on stage.,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,1168,"['saw', 'RSC', 'production', 'four', 'times', 'studying', 'London', '1995', 'also', 'saw', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'Olivier-award-winning', 'performance', 'Peer', 'Gynt', 'New', 'Vic', 'amazing', 'actor', 'bought', 'be', 'able', 'relive', 'experience', 'play', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'performers', 'many', 'props', 'set', 'pieces', 'were', 'just', 'remembered', 'best', 'version', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'stage', 'screen', 'put', 'new', 'twists', 'centuries-old', 'play', 'made', 'so', 'hilarious', 'process', 'not', 'altering', 'story', 'anchoring', 'incorrect', 'time', 'period', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'periods', 'mixed', 'together', 'here', 'well', 'dream', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'add', 'part', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'detracted', 'story', 'wish', 'had', 'left', 'play', 'alone', 'not', 'added', 'sets', 'Theseus', 'palace', 'boy', 'home', 'Rude', 'Mechanicals', 'rehearsal', 'area', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'seemed', 'place', 'took', 'away', 'magical', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'fortunately', 'still', 'fairies', 'forest', 'loved', 'kept', 'lightbulbs']",Midsummer Night's Dream VHS
