1428602,A1ZR7H9LU80VUC,B004UV3KSE,"Bradley A. Beaupain ""US Video critic""","[3, 6]","While I agree with the other reviewers I must say I dont mind having alternate version of the first 2 - two hour episodes. The shorter versions were created for syndicated runs and sometimes in addition to being shorter, the sequence of scenes is jumbled around to fit the time allowed for the episode to air, and in some cases, it makes more sense. I would like to see more of these special sets with the alternate versions but would have included or would like to see included, the 1 hour version of the crossover story arc for Murder She Wrote and Magnum P.I. The first part was called Novel Connection and in the syndicated run, it was cut so that the entire story was solved in a single hour. The single version is not available on DVD and is a rare find on Ebay as a VHS title (I do have it though) The 3rd season of Magnum has the single hour version of another crossover from Simon and Simon, called Ki'is Don't Lie or something close, the crossover episodes of both Simon and Simon and Magnum are included as an extra on season 1 set so it doesn't make any sense that the single hour version of Novel Connection wasn't included in season 7 unless its available as an easter egg....Now I will have to go and look. I hope there are more of these, with the alternate versions as they are still fun to watch and sometimes guess what scenes are cut and/or rearranged.  I think Universal should do the same for Buck Rogers so that we can actually own the pilot for Buck Rogers and not the crappy movie version that was 8 minutes shorter than the pilot. Even if its presented in the future in its 2 part form, that would still be better than not having it at all. I have recorded it off of RTV but the quality is sub-par and since it was aired over the digital stations it has the square box all around it, even on my old 4:3 TV and its tacky.",4,I do like alternate versions......,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,1845,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'must', 'say', 'dont', 'mind', 'having', 'alternate', 'version', 'first', '2', 'two', 'hour', 'episodes', 'shorter', 'versions', 'were', 'created', 'syndicated', 'runs', 'sometimes', 'addition', 'being', 'shorter', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'jumbled', 'fit', 'time', 'allowed', 'episode', 'air', 'cases', 'more', 'sense', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'sets', 'alternate', 'versions', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'included', '1', 'hour', 'version', 'crossover', 'story', 'arc', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'called', 'Novel', 'Connection', 'syndicated', 'run', 'was', 'cut', 'so', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'solved', 'single', 'hour', 'single', 'version', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'rare', 'find', 'Ebay', 'VHS', 'title', 'do', 'have', '3rd', 'season', 'Magnum', 'single', 'hour', 'version', 'crossover', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'called', ""Ki'is"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Lie', 'something', 'close', 'crossover', 'episodes', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'Magnum', 'are', 'included', 'extra', 'season', '1', 'set', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'single', 'hour', 'version', 'Novel', 'Connection', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'season', '7', 'available', 'easter', 'egg', '.Now', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'look', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'alternate', 'versions', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'guess', 'what', 'scenes', 'are', 'cut', 'and/or', 'rearranged', 'think', 'Universal', 'should', 'do', 'same', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'can', 'actually', 'own', 'pilot', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'not', 'crappy', 'movie', 'version', 'was', '8', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'pilot', 'Even', 'presented', 'future', '2', 'part', 'form', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'having', 'have', 'recorded', 'RTV', 'quality', 'sub-par', 'was', 'aired', 'digital', 'stations', 'square', 'box', 'even', 'old', '4:3', 'TV', 'tacky']",The Best of the 80s: Magnum P.I.

1428606,A6A38ESR48ZPK,B004UV3KSE,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[25, 27]","This 2 DVD release is called ""The Best of the 80s: Magnum P.I.""Here are the episodes:Please Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii - This is the two hour pilot. As an introduction to the series, it serves its purpose well. But I've never considered it to be one of the series' best episodes.Memories Are Forever - This two hour episode from season 2 is a wonderful, emotionally intense story. That being said, it's not one of my personal favorite episodes.Home from the Sea - This is my favorite episode of the series. This is the one where Magnum treads water for almost the entire episode. It's from season 4.Blind Justice - What in the world is this season 5 episode doing here? It's not a bad episode, but there's no way I'd have put it on a best-of.Kona Winds - This is from season 6. No episode from season 6 is good enough to be on a best of compilation. Has anyone who bought season 6 ever watched the entire season a second time?Limbo - This is the last episode from season 7, and was originally planned to be the last episode of the series. I certainly won't complain about this beautiful, touching episode being here. However, please be warned that this episode has a major cliffhanger ending, which is not resolved in the contents of this best-of.Resolutions - This two hour episode from season 8 is what actually ended up being the end of the series. It's inferior to Limbo, and I would not have included it.My advice if you're looking for an introduction to the series? Skip this compilation, and get season 2, which is my favorite season. Or, if you really don't want to be without the wonderful ""Home From The Sea,"" then season 4 wouldn't be a bad place to start. Or, if you're especially fond of the two hour episode ""Did You See The Sunrise?"" then season 3 could be a good place to start. Any one of those seasons is better than this compilation.If I was going to make a 10 episode compilation of my own personal favorites, I think it would be these:No Need to Know (season 1)J. ""Digger"" Doyle (season 1)The Woman on the Beach (season 2)Mad Buck Gibson (season 2)The Jororo Kill (season 2)Texas Lightning (season 2)Black on White (season 3)The Arrow That Is Not Aimed (season 3)Faith and Begorrah (season 3)Home from the Sea (season 4)Each of these 10 episodes is a fantastic story which stands perfectly well on its own - with no cliffhanger endings or complicated multi-episode storylines - because episodes that do have those things really need to be seen in the total context of their respective seasons, and not on a compilation. So while I very much enjoy episodes such as ""Mac's Back"" (from season 5) and ""Unfinished Business"" (from season 8), I would not include them on a compilation.Other may disagree with me. Some might say that a true best-of would have to include all of the major plot points regarding Mac, Michelle, Lily, etc. And that is a good argument.I guess, in the long run, the only ""best of"" that really matters is the one you carry inside your own head.",3,"I love Magnum, P.I., but I cannot recommend this ""best of.""",1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,2986,"['2', 'DVD', 'release', 'called', 'Best', '80s', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'Here', 'are', 'episodes', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Eat', 'Snow', 'Hawaii', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'introduction', 'series', 'purpose', 'well', ""'ve"", 'never', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'episodes.Memories', 'Are', 'Forever', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'wonderful', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'story', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes.Home', 'Sea', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'one', 'where', 'Magnum', 'water', 'almost', 'entire', 'episode', 'season', '4.Blind', 'Justice', 'What', 'world', 'season', '5', 'episode', 'doing', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'episode', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'put', 'best-of.Kona', 'Winds', 'season', '6', 'episode', 'season', '6', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'best', 'compilation', 'Has', 'anyone', 'who', 'bought', 'season', '6', 'ever', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'second', 'time', 'Limbo', 'last', 'episode', 'season', '7', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'be', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'episode', 'being', 'here', 'However', 'please', 'be', 'warned', 'episode', 'major', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'not', 'resolved', 'contents', 'best-of.Resolutions', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'season', '8', 'what', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'end', 'series', 'inferior', 'Limbo', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'it.My', 'advice', ""'re"", 'looking', 'introduction', 'series', 'Skip', 'compilation', 'get', 'season', '2', 'favorite', 'season', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'wonderful', 'Home', 'Sea', 'then', 'season', '4', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'place', 'start', ""'re"", 'especially', 'fond', 'two', 'hour', 'Did', 'See', 'Sunrise', 'then', 'season', '3', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'one', 'seasons', 'better', 'compilation.If', 'was', 'going', 'make', '10', 'episode', 'compilation', 'own', 'personal', 'favorites', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'Need', 'Know', 'season', '1', 'J', 'Digger', 'Doyle', 'season', '1', 'Woman', 'Beach', 'season', '2', 'Mad', 'Buck', 'Gibson', 'season', '2', 'Jororo', 'Kill', 'season', '2', 'Texas', 'Lightning', 'season', '2', 'Black', 'White', 'season', '3', 'Arrow', 'Not', 'Aimed', 'season', '3', 'Faith', 'Begorrah', 'season', '3', 'Home', 'Sea', 'season', '4', '10', 'episodes', 'fantastic', 'story', 'perfectly', 'well', 'own', 'cliffhanger', 'complicated', 'multi-episode', 'storylines', 'episodes', 'do', 'have', 'things', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'total', 'context', 'respective', 'seasons', 'not', 'compilation', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'such', 'Mac', 'Back', 'season', '5', 'Unfinished', 'Business', 'season', '8', 'would', 'not', 'include', 'compilation.Other', 'may', 'disagree', 'might', 'say', 'true', 'best-of', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'regarding', 'Mac', 'Michelle', 'Lily', 'etc', 'good', 'argument.I', 'guess', 'long', 'run', 'only', 'best', 'really', 'matters', 'one', 'carry', 'own', 'head']",The Best of the 80s: Magnum P.I.
