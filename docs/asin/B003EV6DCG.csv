1339032,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B003EV6DCG,Aco,"[56, 60]","Once upon a time this film would have been released in theatres and this lead performance and maybe even Brenda Vaccaro's would have been nominated for Academy Awards. That is how good this film is, award worthy, notable for it's stellar execution and story, a standout for this year. Al Pacino's Jack Kevorkian is not his best work in a decade, as some have speculated. It is his best work since Angels in America (from 2003), also an HBO produced and presented film. He is as commanding in that amazing series as in this. Pacino has always been physically gifted as an actor; adept at expressing his emotions with his back or his head, his hands or his walk. I think his reputation as actor has suffered in the last twenty years because he moved away from using his body (essential to the art of acting) and compensated with his voice. In this context, this film is a return to form: Donnie Brasco, Carlito's Way, Glengarry Glen Ross, Scent of a Woman, Dick Tracy, to name his best work since 1990.You Don't Know Jack is an apt title for this film, because I was certainly aware of Jack Kevorkian growing up, knew he was an advocate and involved in euthanasia and that he went to prison, but I didn't know he was such an iconoclast; morbid, graphic and unapologetic painter, a musician, a bachelor and a civil disobedient. These characteristics add to his legend, and his stature as a doctor who seems to have taken his profession and life's work as something more than a path to prestige and wealth, which cannot be said of some doctors in truth and perhaps too many in reputation. The role of the physician in society is an aspect of the successful story told here.The role of the politician and the collective social fears of death in our society are the other themes, and they too are well told.Though Kevorkian is presented sympathetically, and his opponents are not; angry ""Christians"" in general and a politically vengeful D.A. specifically, it is ultimately his own folly that dooms him. This may speak to his bachelorhood, his unemployment at the outset of the film and his stubbornness at getting to the Supreme Court. But his ambitions are not clarified here, other than his humanism, which is made genuine in small moments as well as big.I highly recommend this film. Al Pacino and Jack Kevorkian are in the center of it, and the other actors, particularly Vaccaro as his sister Margo, are excellent. Euthanasia is an issue brought to the forefront by Kevorkian, but his incarceration did not produce another advocate in his stead, and the issue has unfortunately fallen by the wayside. It is an important consideration, what power we have over ourselves when we are faced with imminent pain before our death. This film handles it incredibly well, and I hope it produces as much discussion and thought for you as it did for me.Thanks.",5,To admire the dust on the shoes of the condemned...,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,2848,"['Once', 'time', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'theatres', 'lead', 'performance', 'maybe', 'even', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'award', 'worthy', 'notable', 'stellar', 'execution', 'story', 'standout', 'year', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'decade', 'have', 'speculated', 'best', 'work', 'Angels', 'America', '2003', 'also', 'HBO', 'produced', 'presented', 'film', 'commanding', 'amazing', 'series', 'Pacino', 'always', 'been', 'physically', 'gifted', 'actor', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'back', 'head', 'hands', 'walk', 'think', 'reputation', 'actor', 'suffered', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'moved', 'away', 'using', 'body', 'essential', 'art', 'acting', 'compensated', 'voice', 'context', 'film', 'return', 'form', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'name', 'best', 'work', '1990.You', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Jack', 'apt', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'aware', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'growing', 'up', 'knew', 'was', 'advocate', 'involved', 'euthanasia', 'went', 'prison', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'such', 'iconoclast', 'morbid', 'graphic', 'unapologetic', 'painter', 'musician', 'bachelor', 'civil', 'disobedient', 'characteristics', 'add', 'legend', 'stature', 'doctor', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'profession', 'life', 'work', 'something', 'more', 'path', 'prestige', 'wealth', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'doctors', 'truth', 'perhaps', 'too', 'many', 'reputation', 'role', 'physician', 'society', 'aspect', 'successful', 'story', 'told', 'here.The', 'role', 'politician', 'collective', 'social', 'fears', 'death', 'society', 'are', 'other', 'themes', 'too', 'are', 'well', 'Kevorkian', 'presented', 'sympathetically', 'opponents', 'are', 'not', 'angry', 'Christians', 'general', 'politically', 'vengeful', 'D.A', 'specifically', 'ultimately', 'own', 'folly', 'may', 'speak', 'bachelorhood', 'unemployment', 'outset', 'film', 'stubbornness', 'getting', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ambitions', 'are', 'not', 'clarified', 'here', 'other', 'humanism', 'made', 'genuine', 'small', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'big.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'are', 'center', 'other', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Vaccaro', 'sister', 'Margo', 'are', 'excellent', 'Euthanasia', 'issue', 'brought', 'forefront', 'Kevorkian', 'incarceration', 'did', 'not', 'produce', 'advocate', 'stead', 'issue', 'unfortunately', 'fallen', 'wayside', 'important', 'consideration', 'what', 'power', 'have', 'over', 'ourselves', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'imminent', 'pain', 'death', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well', 'hope', 'as', 'much', 'discussion', 'thought', 'did', 'me.Thanks']",You Don't Know Jack

Jack Kervorkian was a very important figure in this raging debate, a doctor by profession he was known more for his work with assisted suicide earning him the title `Doctor Death', he practiced medicide as he liked to call it instead of medicine. Kervorkian dominated the news in the 90's, right up to his incarceration. In ` You don't know Jack' one gets to know many things about the man behind the persona, his zeal and single minded desire to free people of their pain and the reasons behind it. Then there is the person who was jack, his creation of the Mercitron, the machine used for assisted killings, his love of nature, his poor social skills-one of the reasons that he remained unmarried, that he was a lover of Bach and a painter of ghoulish art, his lack of friends and that the only person that cared for his deeply was his sister  Margo (Brenda Vaccaro). Al Pacino delivers an astounding performance and is unrecognizable as Pacino, I thought this was his best performance in the past few years. He has great supporting cast in John Goodman and Susan Sarandon. The movie has a runtime of 149 minutes but these slip away quickly. I enjoyed this film.

But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty.""(excerpt from the modern Hippocratic Oath)Barry Levinson's HBO  biopic of Jack Kevorkian, YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (TV-2010) is a surprising film, especially as it got me to reconsider my own views on the right to die controversy. With a ""life at all costs"" mindset, going in I was almost certain that I would find the so-called Doctor Death absolutely repulsive, also that this would be a typical Al Pacino film replete with his usual acting idiosyncrasies. Both proved not to be the case. Instead of just another ""Pacino as..."" movie, Al successfully transforms into Dr. K. in voice, manner, posture and appearance throughout the story.And what a story it is!As we ultimately see, the true issue may not be that of a maverick physician who defied God's will on the length of another person's life, but rather one of the individual's right to choose an ending when there is no quality left and nothing in the future but pain, agony and a guaranteed slow and undignified death.Dr. Kevorkian helped over 130 people end their suffering. He didn't do the job himself, the patient usually began the process him or herself by removing a clip from a pinched-off tube. Three substances were then introduced via an intravenous drip that in succession induced unconsciousness, stopped breathing and paralyzed the heart muscle. The person's passing away is dramatic only as he struggles to breathe while unconscious. The transition from life to death is thus not without some trauma, but it is fairly quick.The final suicide, and the one that caused the most outrage, was initiated by Kevorkian himself via injections. This entire process was videotaped. His purpose was to get arrested, convicted and to then appeal to the Supreme Court, hoping that a favorable ruling would make assisted sucide legal nationwide. It was an act of desperation because the doctor felt his own life could soon end, and he wanted a resolution that would humanely benefit the terminally ill.After Kevorkian was interviewed by Mike Wallace and the euthanasia tape aired on 60 MINUTES, he was charged with 1st degree murder and assisting a suicide, which is illegal in Michigan.Kevorkian's plan backfired. To keep sympathy out of the courtroom, the prosecutor threw out the assisted suicide count and charged him only with murder. Kevorkian wasn't allowed to call surviving family members as witnesses who could testify as to his motivation, and a videotape of the desperately ill man begging for relief was never seen by the jury. The doctor was also his own attorney, in hindsight a fatal mistake.Jack Kevorkian was convicted and sentenced to 20 years but was paroled after nine, at age 79. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, so he lost that final all-important battle, as well.",5,Get to know Jack,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,2951,"['given', 'save', 'life', 'thanks', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'power', 'take', 'life', 'awesome', 'responsibility', 'must', 'be', 'faced', 'great', 'humbleness', 'awareness', 'own', 'frailty', 'excerpt', 'modern', 'Hippocratic', 'Oath', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'HBO', 'biopic', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KNOW', 'JACK', 'TV-2010', 'surprising', 'film', 'especially', 'got', 'reconsider', 'own', 'views', 'right', 'die', 'controversy', 'life', 'costs', 'mindset', 'going', 'was', 'almost', 'certain', 'would', 'find', 'so-called', 'Doctor', 'Death', 'absolutely', 'repulsive', 'also', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'film', 'replete', 'usual', 'acting', 'idiosyncrasies', 'proved', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'Instead', 'just', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'Al', 'successfully', 'Dr.', 'K.', 'voice', 'manner', 'posture', 'appearance', 'story.And', 'what', 'story', 'ultimately', 'see', 'true', 'issue', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'maverick', 'physician', 'who', 'defied', 'God', 'will', 'length', 'person', 'life', 'rather', 'one', 'individual', 'right', 'choose', 'ending', 'when', 'quality', 'left', 'nothing', 'future', 'pain', 'agony', 'guaranteed', 'slow', 'undignified', 'death.Dr', 'Kevorkian', 'helped', '130', 'people', 'end', 'suffering', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'patient', 'usually', 'began', 'process', 'removing', 'clip', 'pinched-off', 'tube', 'Three', 'substances', 'were', 'then', 'introduced', 'intravenous', 'drip', 'succession', 'induced', 'unconsciousness', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'paralyzed', 'heart', 'muscle', 'person', 'passing', 'away', 'dramatic', 'only', 'breathe', 'unconscious', 'transition', 'life', 'death', 'thus', 'not', 'trauma', 'fairly', 'quick.The', 'final', 'suicide', 'one', 'caused', 'most', 'outrage', 'was', 'initiated', 'Kevorkian', 'injections', 'entire', 'process', 'was', 'videotaped', 'purpose', 'was', 'get', 'arrested', 'convicted', 'then', 'appeal', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'hoping', 'favorable', 'ruling', 'would', 'make', 'assisted', 'sucide', 'legal', 'nationwide', 'was', 'act', 'desperation', 'doctor', 'felt', 'own', 'life', 'could', 'soon', 'end', 'wanted', 'resolution', 'would', 'humanely', 'benefit', 'terminally', 'ill.After', 'Kevorkian', 'was', 'interviewed', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'euthanasia', 'tape', 'aired', '60', 'MINUTES', 'was', 'charged', '1st', 'degree', 'murder', 'assisting', 'suicide', 'illegal', 'Michigan.Kevorkian', 'plan', 'backfired', 'keep', 'sympathy', 'courtroom', 'prosecutor', 'threw', 'out', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'count', 'charged', 'only', 'murder', 'Kevorkian', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'call', 'surviving', 'family', 'members', 'witnesses', 'who', 'could', 'testify', 'motivation', 'videotape', 'desperately', 'ill', 'man', 'begging', 'relief', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'jury', 'doctor', 'was', 'also', 'own', 'attorney', 'hindsight', 'fatal', 'mistake.Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'was', 'convicted', 'sentenced', '20', 'years', 'was', 'paroled', 'nine', 'age', '79', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'refused', 'hear', 'appeal', 'lost', 'final', 'all-important', 'battle', 'as', 'well']",You Don't Know Jack
1339037,A1GVKGSN6V1VTX,B003EV6DCG,Arctic Voice Earl,"[2, 3]","There have already been a number of excellent reviews of this movie, which covers Dr. Jack Kevorkian's lengthy struggle on a rather simple goal -- death with dignity for each of us.If HBO had not decided to do the movie, I wonder if a Hollywood studio would have done it.Kevorkian, as expertly played by Al Pacino, lacked some public relations skills, but he did assist many suffering people who just wanted to die rather than continue a life of pain, with lots of tubes into them. The tubes in someone begin the movie and we see more feeding-type tubes through the movie.The cast is excellent, especially Brenda Viccaro who plays his very helpful sister.So dedicated that she really did not have her own life. But overall, she seemed to gain strength by assisting her brother in so many ways. Sometimes just by listening to him.The movie, while dealing with a very serious subject, keeps moving and has slices of some humor and moments when someone just wants to help in the effort.I would disagree a bit with some reviewers that the issue of death with dignity went to the back page after Kevorkian's experiences with the judicial system.Remember Sarah Palin's attack on so-called ""death panels"" as Health Care Reform legislation was being put together? A total over-reaction to language that would reimburse doctors for their time counseling relatives about hospice and advance directives, etc.On the other side, groups like Compassiona nd Choices are working hard and picking up support for end-of-life choices.It is not an easy process to go  through, for any of us. But the movie shows how death can have dignity and reflect the principles and desires of people approaching the end of their lives. .The tapes of folks seeking Kivordian's assistance are very revealing. I remember a person approaching dimentia/Alzheimers and knowing it is coming, and struggling to pass away with dignity before all memories blink out.The movie is well-worth seeing. It will help us all to think, and study up on optionsEarl",5,Just to die with dignity,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2013,"['have', 'already', 'been', 'number', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'lengthy', 'struggle', 'rather', 'simple', 'goal', 'death', 'dignity', 'us.If', 'HBO', 'had', 'not', 'decided', 'do', 'movie', 'wonder', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'it.Kevorkian', 'expertly', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'lacked', 'public', 'relations', 'skills', 'did', 'assist', 'many', 'suffering', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'die', 'rather', 'continue', 'life', 'pain', 'lots', 'tubes', 'tubes', 'someone', 'begin', 'movie', 'see', 'more', 'feeding-type', 'tubes', 'movie.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Brenda', 'Viccaro', 'who', 'very', 'helpful', 'sister.So', 'dedicated', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'life', 'overall', 'seemed', 'gain', 'strength', 'assisting', 'brother', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'listening', 'him.The', 'movie', 'dealing', 'very', 'serious', 'subject', 'moving', 'slices', 'humor', 'moments', 'when', 'someone', 'just', 'help', 'effort.I', 'would', 'disagree', 'bit', 'reviewers', 'issue', 'death', 'dignity', 'went', 'back', 'page', 'Kevorkian', 'experiences', 'judicial', 'system.Remember', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'attack', 'so-called', 'death', 'panels', 'Health', 'Care', 'Reform', 'legislation', 'was', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'total', 'over-reaction', 'language', 'would', 'reimburse', 'doctors', 'time', 'counseling', 'relatives', 'hospice', 'advance', 'directives', 'etc.On', 'other', 'side', 'groups', 'Compassiona', 'nd', 'Choices', 'are', 'working', 'hard', 'picking', 'up', 'support', 'end-of-life', 'choices.It', 'not', 'easy', 'process', 'go', 'movie', 'how', 'death', 'can', 'have', 'dignity', 'reflect', 'principles', 'desires', 'people', 'approaching', 'end', 'lives', '.The', 'tapes', 'folks', 'seeking', 'Kivordian', 'assistance', 'are', 'very', 'revealing', 'remember', 'person', 'approaching', 'dimentia/Alzheimers', 'knowing', 'coming', 'struggling', 'pass', 'away', 'dignity', 'memories', 'blink', 'out.The', 'movie', 'well-worth', 'seeing', 'will', 'help', 'think', 'study', 'up', 'optionsEarl']",You Don't Know Jack

His sister Margo Janus (Brenda Vaccaro) and his old friend Neal Nicol (John Goodman) do what they can to help him in his controversial crusade to bring relief to those in unbearable pain. His eager young lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger (Danny Huston) is of great help until he abandons Jack to make a run for governor of Michigan. Janet Good (Susan Sarandon) is head of the Hemlock Society and becomes a supporter, and eventually a patient, of Jack's.Jack videotapes interviews with his patients, gets their written consent and the cooperation of their loved ones, and is careful to make the actual mechanism for the lethal subject to the patient's control. That is, he is careful to limit himself to assisted suicide and not direct-action euthanasia. Then Michigan passed a law against assisted suicide, mostly because he was acquitted by half a dozen juries on attempts to charge him with murder.Finally, he decided that the issue would have to go to the Supreme Court, so he set up an intentionally provocative case. He went to ""60 Minutes"" with a video of his latest patient, whom he had injected directly instead of using the elaborate indirect procedures that made the patient's own action the cause of death. I'm explaining this badly, but it was very clear in the film, and especially in the ""60 Minutes"" video.So the Michigan Attorney General figured he had an airtight case. He charged Jack with murder and assisted suicide, but then dropped the assisted suicide charge when it was pointed out that this would provide more latitude in the rules of evidence. Jack, who was determined to push this to the Supreme Court, welcomed the opportunity and was his own attorney of record.He was found guilty and sentenced to prison. As to whether or not he lost, that's quite another matter. He has forced Americans to face the consequences of a medical technology that is quite capable of keeping people alive past any hope of a life worth living.

I've always been interested in Dr. Jack, the first major player in assisted suicide in the USA.  Thus, the drama is all medicine and law related as the action moves from helping critical patients to kill themselves to the doctor's actually ending the patient's life himself.  The latter practice is still illegal in the USA and likely to remain so. Perhaps the best part of this docudrama is our being able to see precisely why it remains illegal as we see Dr. Jack move from medical helper to viewing himself as a God substitute for the abjectly ill.Al Pacino, as usual, does an absolutely thorough job of covering every nuance of Dr. Jack's character. This is one of those biographical treatments, however, which is very linear and very literal.  It goes from point A to point B to point C very methodically.  Newer and more daring treatments of biographies abandoned this approach for more creative storytelling, such as Bob Fosse's life in ALL THAT JAZZ or indeed Pacino's last stellar HBO effort, ANGELS IN AMERICA.

It is simply an exquisitely executed portrait of Jack Kevorkian - not necessarily who he is (who can judge that), but rather who he thinks he is and how he sees the issue that made him famous.If you're strongly opposed to assisted-suicide for any reason, I recommend you skip this movie and save yourself some angst.If you sympathized with Kevorkian during the 90s; or if you get high on exceptionally good performances regardless of subject matter, stop reading this and go watch the movie, you'll love it.If you don't fall into the categories above, read on:I chose to overlook the movie's one-sided perspective, but it's pretty blatant. In this film, everyone who opposed Kevorkian's ideas is loosely lumped together as hopelessly narrow-minded and/or religious fanatics. But those characters have little screen time and are so thinly-drawn none of them seem like real people. It's easy enough to rationalize (if you feel inclined) that maybe, for the sake of pure-art, the movie-makers intended these stick-figures only to represent the way Kevorkian views his opponents. I kind of doubt that was the intent, but pretending it was allowed me to overlook what is probably the film's biggest flaw - the glossing-over of an issue that's sticky for more reasons than religious dogma and little-mindedness.The basic story: Kevorkian, who was an out-of-work pathologist when all this began, gained notoriety from 1990 to1998 when he did significantly more than advocate - he assisted the suicides of approximately 130 people. He was accused of murder (by his opponents) and acquitted several times along the way. (By the way, Danny Hudson is great as Kevorkian's lawyer.) The movie focuses on these years plus the time he was finally convicted and sentenced to prison for a while. In all but the case for which he was convicted, Dr. Kevorkian's ""assistance"" was limited to providing a suitable place, materials (lethal drugs or carbon monoxide), and a method by which the patient could easily SELF-administer the killing agent. The movie includes a few representative cases.Kevorkian's first assisted-suicide was Janet Atkins, a woman diagnosed (and showing early signs of) Alzheimer's who begged to die before the disease ravaged her mind any further. We know she (and all the others) truly wanted to die, because the doctor's sister (well-played by Brenda Vaccaro) filmed the interviews of all those who sought her brother's unusual services.I think the movie is a work of art and for this reason alone I give it 5 stars.",5,"A Work of Art, but...",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,2988,"['YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KNOW', 'JACK', 'interesting', 'true', 'story', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'portrayal', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'America', 'most', 'famous/infamous', 'advocate', 'physician-assisted', 'suicide', 'nothing', 'short', 'mesmerizing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'feel', 'compelled', 'tell', 'up-front', 'what', 'film', 'NOT', 'not', 'fair', 'presentation', 'complex', 'controversial', 'issue', 'catapulted', 'Dr.', 'Death', 'national', 'spot-light', 'simply', 'exquisitely', 'executed', 'portrait', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'not', 'necessarily', 'who', 'who', 'can', 'judge', 'rather', 'who', 'how', 'issue', 'made', 'famous.If', ""'re"", 'strongly', 'opposed', 'assisted-suicide', 'reason', 'recommend', 'skip', 'movie', 'save', 'angst.If', 'sympathized', 'Kevorkian', '90s', 'get', 'high', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'performances', 'regardless', 'subject', 'matter', 'stop', 'reading', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'categories', 'read', 'chose', 'overlook', 'movie', 'one-sided', 'perspective', 'pretty', 'blatant', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'opposed', 'Kevorkian', 'ideas', 'loosely', 'lumped', 'together', 'hopelessly', 'narrow-minded', 'and/or', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'thinly-drawn', 'none', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'easy', 'enough', 'rationalize', 'feel', 'inclined', 'maybe', 'sake', 'pure-art', 'movie-makers', 'intended', 'stick-figures', 'only', 'represent', 'way', 'Kevorkian', 'views', 'opponents', 'kind', 'doubt', 'was', 'intent', 'pretending', 'was', 'allowed', 'overlook', 'what', 'probably', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'glossing-over', 'issue', 'sticky', 'more', 'reasons', 'religious', 'dogma', 'little-mindedness.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Kevorkian', 'who', 'was', 'out-of-work', 'pathologist', 'when', 'began', 'gained', 'notoriety', '1990', 'to1998', 'when', 'did', 'significantly', 'more', 'advocate', 'assisted', 'suicides', 'approximately', '130', 'people', 'was', 'accused', 'murder', 'opponents', 'acquitted', 'several', 'times', 'way', 'way', 'Danny', 'Hudson', 'great', 'Kevorkian', 'lawyer', 'movie', 'years', 'time', 'was', 'finally', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'while', 'case', 'was', 'convicted', 'Dr.', 'Kevorkian', 'assistance', 'was', 'limited', 'providing', 'suitable', 'place', 'materials', 'lethal', 'drugs', 'carbon', 'monoxide', 'method', 'patient', 'could', 'easily', 'SELF-administer', 'killing', 'agent', 'movie', 'few', 'representative', 'cases.Kevorkian', 'first', 'assisted-suicide', 'was', 'Janet', 'Atkins', 'woman', 'diagnosed', 'showing', 'early', 'signs', 'Alzheimer', 'who', 'begged', 'die', 'disease', 'ravaged', 'mind', 'further', 'know', 'others', 'truly', 'wanted', 'die', 'doctor', 'sister', 'well-played', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'filmed', 'interviews', 'who', 'sought', 'brother', 'unusual', 'services.I', 'think', 'movie', 'work', 'art', 'reason', 'alone', 'give', '5', 'stars']",You Don't Know Jack

So rather than discuss ethics, this review will simply be about the film itself.What stands out most about this movie is the terrific performance by Al Pacino, which is easily his best in the last decade.  Al slips effortlessly into character, and delivers a nuanced performance that honestly makes you forget you're watching a Pacino film.  I was also impressed with the zeal that Danny Huston brought to his portrayal of Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's outspoken attorney.I found the film to be revealing, but fairly unbiased in its portrayal of Kevorkian.  While you're provided with an understanding of his motive by the film's conclusion, you're still presented with both sides of the debate.  The movie also doesn't pull any punches with respect to revealing some of Kevorkian's eccentricities, or the self-deprecating ""quack"" jokes that take place.  The film obviously calls for a little levity, and is punctuated by the occasional light joke.  The cinematography and lighting was quality, and I enjoyed the peaceful score by Brazilian composer Marcelo Zarvos.Overall, I think the film is worth watching for Pacino's performance alone.

1339043,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B003EV6DCG,Craig Whittle,"[2, 3]","YOU DON'T KNOW JACKSTARRING: Al Pacino, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Danny Houston and Brenda VaccaroWRITTEN BY: Adam MazerDIRECTED BY: Barry LevinsonRated: Not RatedGenre: DramaRelease Date: 24 April 2010Review Date: 07 November 2010You Don't Know Jack presents its viewers with a question amidst quintessential questions: should those nearing death and suffering excruciating pain with no chance of hope for a better life, consider assisted suicide? The second question it poses us with is: are the physicians who assist these unfortunate victims, to be held responsible and punished? To these, I add two of my own, stemming from personal religious beliefs: What will happen to the souls of those that choose this as a way to ease their suffering? And will God punish them?I don't know the answers to these questions, and unlike me, the film's main character Dr. Jack Kevorkian who specializes in assisted suicide, doesn't care. He's not interested in what God thinks, and that's probably because he doesn't believe in him. At one point in the film, he tells a group of religious protesters who ask if he has a god, ""His name is Bach. Johann Sebastian Bach. And at least my god isn't an invented one."" Not a very nice thing to say about God, but this isn't a religious debate. It's a review of a film, and a damn good film at that.Dr. Kevorkian may not believe in God, but that doesn't make him a bad person. He wishes only to help people with a means to end their suffering. He doesn't do it for attention, or praise, or even financial gain. Strictly pro-bono. When asked if he will charge for his services, his response is, ""You don't charge people for something like this. What's wrong with you?"" Whether you agree with his methods or not, his intentions are the purest of pure. One character in the film defending Jack's integrity, defines him as, ""The most honest man I know. Honest to a fault."" It should be noted that the material is based on a true story but all that I'm reporting to you comes strictly from the film and isn't to be taken as historical fact.The film simply rides on the story of an elderly man trying to make a change in the world. The conflict comes from those who oppose him, such as the courts, officers of the law, and adamant protesters. What makes the film not only work, but be wickedly entertaining, is a slew of things, to include: the Oscar worthy performance of Al Pacino as Dr. Kevorkian, great supporting performances by Susan Sarandon, Danny Houston and John Goodman, the brilliant direction of Barry Levinson, the well written dialogue, the captivating true story itself, and lastly the unique character of Dr. Kevorkian.He's a man who enjoys watching cartoons, he doesn't like fatty foods, and in addition to a doctor he is also a musician, a poet, and an exceptional artist. He has a hunchback, he mentions the brilliant writing of Frankenstein, Dr. Kevorkian is an eerie name, his artwork displays grizzly images of death, and he deals in the business of assisting people in suicide; it's all creepy ya see. Throw in his witty dialogue spoken through his mild Fargo-istic accent, and a character is born that any actor of Pacino's caliber would love to play. Few could have given it the divine justice Pacino does, however.This movie paints an elaborate portrait that assisted suicide is the way to go, and it wants us to root for its main characters. I did. As I mentioned in regards to the notion of: am I for or against assisted suicide - I'm on the fence; and I'm not alone there to say the least. But to close in my own personal opinion: in the light of what God expects from us in a situation like this, I find it blindingly appropriate to say... that we don't KNOW, jack.",5,You Don't Know Jack Review,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,3725,"['YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KNOW', 'JACKSTARRING', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Danny', 'Houston', 'Brenda', 'VaccaroWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Adam', 'MazerDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Barry', 'LevinsonRated', 'Not', 'RatedGenre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '24', 'April', '2010Review', 'Date', '07', 'November', '2010You', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Jack', 'viewers', 'question', 'quintessential', 'questions', 'should', 'nearing', 'death', 'suffering', 'excruciating', 'pain', 'chance', 'hope', 'better', 'life', 'consider', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'second', 'question', 'are', 'physicians', 'who', 'assist', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'punished', 'add', 'two', 'own', 'stemming', 'personal', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'souls', 'choose', 'way', 'ease', 'suffering', 'will', 'God', 'punish', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answers', 'questions', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'who', 'assisted', 'suicide', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'interested', 'what', 'God', 'probably', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'group', 'religious', 'protesters', 'who', 'ask', 'god', 'name', 'Bach', 'Johann', 'Sebastian', 'Bach', 'least', 'god', ""n't"", 'invented', 'one', 'Not', 'very', 'nice', 'thing', 'say', 'God', ""n't"", 'religious', 'debate', 'review', 'film', 'damn', 'good', 'film', 'that.Dr', 'Kevorkian', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'God', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'person', 'only', 'help', 'people', 'means', 'end', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'do', 'attention', 'praise', 'even', 'financial', 'gain', 'Strictly', 'pro-bono', 'When', 'asked', 'will', 'charge', 'services', 'response', 'do', ""n't"", 'charge', 'people', 'something', 'What', 'wrong', 'agree', 'methods', 'not', 'intentions', 'are', 'purest', 'pure', 'One', 'character', 'film', 'defending', 'Jack', 'integrity', 'most', 'honest', 'man', 'know', 'Honest', 'fault', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'material', 'based', 'true', 'story', ""'m"", 'reporting', 'strictly', 'film', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'historical', 'fact.The', 'film', 'simply', 'story', 'elderly', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'change', 'world', 'conflict', 'who', 'oppose', 'such', 'courts', 'officers', 'law', 'adamant', 'protesters', 'What', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'be', 'wickedly', 'entertaining', 'slew', 'things', 'include', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Dr.', 'Kevorkian', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Danny', 'Houston', 'John', 'Goodman', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'captivating', 'true', 'story', 'lastly', 'unique', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Kevorkian.He', 'man', 'who', 'watching', 'cartoons', ""n't"", 'like', 'fatty', 'foods', 'addition', 'doctor', 'also', 'musician', 'poet', 'exceptional', 'artist', 'hunchback', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'Frankenstein', 'Dr.', 'Kevorkian', 'eerie', 'name', 'artwork', 'displays', 'grizzly', 'images', 'death', 'business', 'assisting', 'people', 'suicide', 'creepy', 'ya', 'see', 'Throw', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'mild', 'Fargo-istic', 'accent', 'character', 'born', 'actor', 'Pacino', 'caliber', 'would', 'love', 'play', 'Few', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'divine', 'justice', 'Pacino', 'however.This', 'movie', 'paints', 'elaborate', 'portrait', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'way', 'go', 'root', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'mentioned', 'regards', 'notion', 'am', 'assisted', 'suicide', ""'m"", 'fence', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'there', 'say', 'least', 'close', 'own', 'personal', 'opinion', 'light', 'what', 'God', 'situation', 'find', 'blindingly', 'appropriate', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'KNOW', 'jack']",You Don't Know Jack

1339047,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003EV6DCG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[12, 15]","Unable to wait to review this latest HBO Films offering, just a few days ago I searched for the dvd to no avail. Here it is and I'm already umpteenth on the list to review.This is a damned good film, just absolutely quality. One query I have: why isn't Hollyweird making these anymore?--good movies, I mean. What, is HBO Films taking over now that the sign's going?Thank God for these favors. Al Pacino hits this performance out of the ballpark, and anyone paying attention will have noted Dr. Kevorkian saying when he first saw clips, he thought it was himself, not Pacino. THAT is good. That gives you an idea of the workings of this film. Though it is difficult to get to know a man like Dr. Kevorkian, Pacino makes us feel like we are in the room with him.Admit it, who would pass that up?This film, with its tense, up-close-and-personal shots, with its flashbacks and Pacino cleverly inserted into some (not all) of Dr. Kevorkian's ""video consultations"", this film is a slice of life and a piece of cake...something Hitchcock never could do. Not that it is Hitchcockian. Levinson knows better than trying to do that. There's no shortage of talent here...the other reviews spell out nicely all the great work by John Goodman, Brenda Vacarro, Danny Huston (I don't care for him at all but he's good here) and Susan Sarandon, one of my all-time favorites. The extras are mind-blowing. When was the last time you could say that about a movie?The acting in this film reminds me of the best films of the 1940s and 1950s, many of those starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. Pacino's Kevorkian keeps a plucky humor laced throughout even the saddest moments, as does Brenda V. as his sister Margot Janus.As another reviewer said, this is the doctor I'd like at my side when that time comes for me. It hits us, especially with this film, that will never happen. I think one flaw in this film was not showing more of the outside world and the results of the good doctor's work.For example, it is illegal to assist in a suicide. Also I was a bit saddened by some other salient facts that for legal reasons could not be depicted. This film is also missing a certain richness in Dr. Kevorkian's life: his incredible genius as an artist, a composer, inventor and lay expert on the U.S. Constitution...especially his love for the 9th Amendment. It is alsoa  bit depressing to see that his backstory was avoided, such as his brilliance in pathology and his 7 published books. Innumerable scientific papers fall into the mix that is this man's genius.He also bravely ran for Congress in his home state of Michigan in 2008. Incredible!Well, Dr. Kevorkian himself has said, ""Doctors are cowards."" And so they are, and so we learn from this great film. I see lots of lists, all the films you should see before you die...well, this is THE film to see before you die. With Pacino literally mutating into Kevorkian (though he's too heavy on the Michigan accent), one can feel his presence and his contributions.A few final words. I'm so tired of these great films not having chances at Oscars. I love that I can see them when they are made and released--I love that TV is improving thereby, no waiting or rescheduling. Even if it's only HBO. I love the fact I can get the dvd within a reasonable period (there's no force that will stop me adding this to my collection).Finally, HBO has to get its share of the kudos. They have given us so much throughout the decades, but this past few years have been phenomenal. They have given us JOHN ADAMS, TEMPLE GRANDIN, and so many others I cannot list here because I can't recall them all (but I have reviewed most)--HBO really can be the best in cable. It's been there with us like a silent but devoted relative all these decades. Name a short list of your favorite films.

1339052,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B003EV6DCG,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 4]",".... or rather, I didn't know what to think of Dr Jack Kevorkian, the 'notorious' crusader for the right of 'assisted suicide' in the state of Michigan. Frankly, I didn't pay much attention to his activities in the '80s and '90s. I was living most of the time in Europe. If anything, I had the impression that Kevorkian was a doubtful figure to lead a moral crusade, a person driven by egotism and perhaps monomania. At the same time, I fully agree with his first premise, that a person should have the absolute right, without moral interference from any religious or civic agent, to decide whether to live or die. Any law making suicide a crime is an immoral law that need not be obeyed ... a law of the sort condemned by the Nuremberg Trials, a law that it is criminal to uphold.The second premise -- that the laws of a country should overtly condone medically assisted suicide or that doctors should be empowered to assist certain sufferers in suicide -- is a far more difficult issue. There are legitimate fears to be acknowledged. Severely handicapped people of my own and my psychologist wife's acquaintance have expressed the fear that, if medically assisted suicide becomes normal and widely accepted, there will be subtle social/societal pressures on them to make that choice, to 'take one for the team' so to speak. There are reasonable fears of economic factors - cost factors - coming into play in a society that has consistently favored for-profit medical care. There are extremely rational fears that Insurance Companies (the very Devil!) will devise ways to squeeze more profit out of their merciless business by finding it cheaper to 'help' their clients die than to keep them alive. If there is a single issue that screams for what John Rawls has called ""overlapping consensus"", assisted suicide is that issue.Back to Jack, however. This film, with the great actor Al Pacino playing the role of Kevorkian, is unambiguously a portrait of a hero. The 'Jack' in the film is a flawed human being - stubborn, self-righteous, unable to give or take 'love' - but he is a moral hero in the same measure that Nathan Hale, Henry Thoreau, John Brown, Eugene Debs, Robert Lowell, and dozens of Civil Rights demonstrators of the 1960s were, all of whom broke laws, committed overt civil disobedience, and went to jail or the gallows for doing so. But I have a skeptical mind; I seldom 'believe' anything merely on the basis of good acting or plausible writing. I was deeply impressed by the Kevorkian in the film, and by the acting skills of Pacino and the rest of the cast, but honestly, I still don't know Jack.And I don't need to ""know Jack"" to support, at least provisionally, the concept of medical assistance in end-of-life decisions. Three states of the USA - Oregon, Montana, and Washington - have already passed laws allowing such assistance, as well as the Netherlands. With any luck, I won't need assistance, anywhere, if I should ever need to make such a decision about my own life.",5,"No, I Didn't Know Jack ...",1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,2998,"['rather', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'Dr', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', ""'notorious"", 'crusader', 'right', ""'assisted"", 'suicide', 'state', 'Michigan', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'activities', ""'80s"", ""'90s"", 'was', 'living', 'most', 'time', 'Europe', 'anything', 'had', 'impression', 'Kevorkian', 'was', 'doubtful', 'figure', 'lead', 'moral', 'crusade', 'person', 'driven', 'egotism', 'perhaps', 'monomania', 'same', 'time', 'fully', 'agree', 'first', 'premise', 'person', 'should', 'have', 'absolute', 'right', 'moral', 'interference', 'religious', 'civic', 'agent', 'decide', 'live', 'die', 'law', 'making', 'suicide', 'crime', 'immoral', 'law', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'obeyed', 'law', 'sort', 'condemned', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'law', 'criminal', 'uphold.The', 'second', 'premise', 'laws', 'country', 'should', 'overtly', 'condone', 'medically', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'doctors', 'should', 'be', 'empowered', 'assist', 'certain', 'sufferers', 'suicide', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'issue', 'are', 'legitimate', 'fears', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'Severely', 'handicapped', 'people', 'own', 'psychologist', 'wife', 'acquaintance', 'have', 'expressed', 'fear', 'medically', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'becomes', 'normal', 'widely', 'accepted', 'will', 'be', 'subtle', 'social/societal', 'pressures', 'make', 'choice', ""'take"", 'one', 'team', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'reasonable', 'fears', 'economic', 'factors', 'cost', 'factors', 'coming', 'play', 'society', 'consistently', 'favored', 'for-profit', 'medical', 'care', 'are', 'extremely', 'rational', 'fears', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'very', 'Devil', 'will', 'devise', 'ways', 'squeeze', 'more', 'profit', 'merciless', 'business', 'finding', 'cheaper', ""'help"", 'clients', 'die', 'keep', 'alive', 'single', 'issue', 'what', 'John', 'Rawls', 'called', 'overlapping', 'consensus', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'issue.Back', 'Jack', 'however', 'film', 'great', 'actor', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'playing', 'role', 'Kevorkian', 'unambiguously', 'portrait', 'hero', ""'Jack"", 'film', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'stubborn', 'self-righteous', 'unable', 'give', 'take', ""'love"", 'moral', 'hero', 'same', 'measure', 'Nathan', 'Hale', 'Henry', 'Thoreau', 'John', 'Brown', 'Eugene', 'Debs', 'Robert', 'Lowell', 'dozens', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'demonstrators', '1960s', 'were', 'whom', 'broke', 'laws', 'committed', 'overt', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'went', 'jail', 'gallows', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'skeptical', 'mind', 'seldom', 'anything', 'merely', 'basis', 'good', 'acting', 'plausible', 'writing', 'was', 'deeply', 'impressed', 'Kevorkian', 'film', 'acting', 'skills', 'Pacino', 'rest', 'cast', 'honestly', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jack.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'Jack', 'support', 'least', 'provisionally', 'concept', 'medical', 'assistance', 'end-of-life', 'decisions', 'Three', 'states', 'USA', 'Oregon', 'Montana', 'Washington', 'have', 'already', 'passed', 'laws', 'allowing', 'such', 'assistance', 'as', 'well', 'Netherlands', 'luck', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'assistance', 'anywhere', 'should', 'ever', 'need', 'make', 'such', 'decision', 'own', 'life']",You Don't Know Jack
1339053,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003EV6DCG,Grady Harp,"[18, 21]","Director Barry Levinson ('Diner', 'The Natural', 'Good Morning, Vietnam', 'Rain Man', 'Avalon', Bugsy', etc) has obviously taken a chance with his latest film YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, a cinematic evaluation of the notorious and controversial Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Detroit pathologist who upon retiring from his career felt compelled to create a manner for people suffering chronic disease, paralytic illness, chemotherapy failures, and those pleading to die with dignity to have a choice as to whether they by law must linger in misery or be given the opportunity to have a doctor assisted suicide.  Whether or not viewers react positively or negatively to this film for HBO will probably be tainted with personal convictions about assisted suicide rather than whether the film is worthy or a diatribe.  But that is the still ongoing dilemma of the topic raised by the elderly Armenian physician's choices or convictions and one that the film explores well.As for the film itself, it is a tour de force of acting performances: Al Pacino transforms himself physically and technically to bring the personality of Jack Kevorkian to life.  It is a role of so many fine nuances that demonstrates ho Pacino  truly does inhabit the title of the film.  This Kevorkian is shown to be a man driven to be an outspoken activists for human rights - especially the right to die.  His sister Margo, played to perfection by Brenda Vacarro, is the lonely Jack's sole source of emotional support, while his old friend and hospital medic Neal Nicol (who technically assists Kevorkian) is made a three dimensional person by John Goodman.  Another supporter is the Hemlock Society worker Janet Good, another fine role for Susan Sarandon, and Danny Huston (almost unrecognizable in a wig) is Jack's pro bono lawyer Geoffrey Fieger.  The technique used by Kevorkian is to interview people who approach him pleading to end their lives (some have tried regular suicide attempts before), make a video of the patient and family requesting assisted suicide, be sure the family and patient are serious and ready and only then provide the service with a contraption loaded with sedative and KCL  that is triggered by the patient.  Many of the actual patients are reenacted by a cadre of fine actors in scenes of pleading that tug at the heart.Kevorkian is placed on trial by the courts in Michigan and finally after 133 assisted suicides is sentenced to prison - but not until after frequent jailings accompanied by Kevorkian's hunger strikes have resulted in his being released due to the finesse of his lawyer. Though Kevorkian has a large number of people who feel he is a cruel serial killer, this film presents the more human side of a man motivated to provide an alternative to patients suffering the lingering agonies of medically approved slow deaths.  There are several tender scenes in this film, but the one that is a triumph of writing and acting is a conversation between Sarandon and Pacino as to what happened in Jack's childhood that began the idea for his mission.  If viewers can get past their personal issues with the subject, then they will be witness to a superb film and terrific acting that will likely lead to an Emmy for at least Pacino.

"" Al Pacino, who bears an astonish resemblance, plays Dr. Jack Kevorkian and does an incredible job.

Together their performance allows the audience to view the good doctor in his Herculeion task of establishing a man's right to die. Despite being ostracized, ridiculed, vilified, hounded and even imprisoned, Kavorkian continued and in the minds of millions of rational people, his struggle established the precedent for humans, not a puritanical government, to chose the time to die.

In that VHS, we learn that Kevorkian's sister, the late Margot Janus (who, by the way, was far better looking than the actress who portrays her in this HBO film), assisted Kevorkian & subsequently testified at his trial.  For unknown reasons, however, this HBO film presents Margot Janus as preceding Thomas Hyde in death.  Why on earth would it be necessary to change such basic information?  It leaves me curious as to what else in this film has been fictionalized (I believe the Court TV VHS to also showthe real life Jack Kevorkian and Jeffrey Fiegerto be far less likeable than the actors who portray them.  And by the way, how did Al Pacino get the idea that Kevorkian had that peculiar accent?).  As recorded byCourt TV, Kevorkian, Fieger, and Janus appear to have had utter disdain for the sanctity of human life, as well as for basic honesty.If it can be trusted, the HBO film tells us that Kevorkian is the child of survivors of the Armenian Genocide.  If that is accurate, it leaves me especially baffled to try to explain his disdain for the sanctity of human life.In the HBO film, the Kevorkian character argues that assisted suicide is supposedly far more humane than death by starvation (such as what was subsequently inflicted onTerri Schiavo).  This is a pointless argument, as both are absolutely IMMORAL.Certainly, Jack Kevorkian has been one of the foremost ""prophets"" of what the late John Paul II called ""the Culture of Death.""  While appeals may be made to the emotions that hastening death will ease suffering, this must be recognized as a heinous and dangerous philosophy.  Rather than recognizing that each human being is of incomparable worth, ""the Culture of Death"" can see no value in human life, when there is disability, disease, suffering, or weakness.  There is no understanding that a human life is not to be ""put down,"" as a vet might treat the sick family pet.For the Christian,JP IIreminded us (as has philosopherPeter Kreeft) that unsolicited pain can be an opportunity to share in Christ's own suffering & a uniting with Him in His redemptive sacrifice, offered in obedience to His father.

1339059,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003EV6DCG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","In the realm of made-for-TV movies, there is no question that HBO has been leading the way with critically acclaimed and Emmy nominated fare within recent years. Take 2010, for example, with HBO's ""The Pacific"" ruling in the mini-series category--three other HBO productions were left battling it out in the film subdivision. ""You Don't Know Jack,"" a Barry Levinson biopic about assisted-suicide maverick Jack Kevorkian, netted 15 Emmy nominations and won Al Pacino a statue as Best Actor. ""Temple Grandin,"" another biopic--this one about the autistic Grandin who became a pioneer in animal husbandry--also garnered 15 nods and was the night's big winner. In addition to Outstanding Made For Television Movie, it won Best Actress for Claire Danes as well as supporting statuettes for David Strathairn and Julia Ormond. And finally, there was ""The Special Relationship,"" depicting the bond between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, which was a bridesmaid with five nominations and no wins. All in all, a good showing for HBO!Arguably the film with the highest profile and most distinguished pedigree of the three is ""You Don't Know Jack."" Interestingly enough, it is also my least favorite. There is certainly nothing wrong with ""Jack"" and I learned quite a bit about Kevorkian, who to my mind is darn near a saint. From a surprisingly humble beginning, Kevorkian was a trailblazer and with single-minded purpose became a figurehead in groundbreaking legal debates about medical ethics. It's a great and fascinating story, but Levinson gives it a surprisingly by-the-numbers presentation. Anyone familiar with the routine cadence of a biopic will agree that this one ticks all the expected boxes. Pacino is refreshingly restrained and, for the first time in years, brings an understated dignity to a role. He does well capturing the unprepossessing doctor and he is ably assisted by John Goodman, Brenda Vaccaro, and Susan Sarandan. ""You Don't Know Jack"" is a good film that's at its best when looking at the quietly intimate moments of Kevorkian's patients.""Temple Grandin,"" on the other hand, is the most unexpected of the three films. I was fearful that ""Grandin"" might be a bit like medicine--good for me but not very fun. But not so! Both heartfelt and entertaining, this film pulses with life. In an interesting visual style, it attempts to connect the viewer to how Grandin's mind visualizes things. Unique in its presentation, it's also a dynamic narrative device! Claire Danes does her best work in years--it's a showy role, but she doesn't showboat. And like Pacino, Danes does a nice job of approximating the real life inspiration. Grandin's story is terrific too. She overcomes so much as a woman, as someone with autism, as someone who seems incapable of normalcy. Through sheer perseverance and stubbornness, she made people listen and became an industry leader in the humane treatment of livestock. Fascinating stuff, really--makes me wish I had a bit more gumption.And then we have the utterly charming ""The Special Relationship."" Another film that is far more engaging than one might predict, ""Relationship"" plays almost like a sly comedy of manners. A terrific Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair--and really who else could play Blair? This is his third collaboration as Blair with screenwriter Peter Morgan. A young Blair is infatuated with Bill Clinton (nicely done by Dennis Quaid) and adopts much of his style from his mentor. The two form a friendship with Clinton in the driver's seat, but through the years as scandal strikes--there is a delicate shift in balance that makes for a role reversal. Topical and true to the historical events, ""Relationship"" is also a smart and amusing riff on male bonding. Morgan continues to be one of our strongest writers so it's no surprise that this is a literate and winning film. Hope Davis also does a good Hillary.All in all, these are three worthwhile films. Maybe it would make a fun biopic triple feature. ""Jack"" ranks about 3 1/2 stars--nice but conventional. ""Grandin"" would be about 4 1/2 stars--director Mick Jackson does wonders with the visual aspects of the film. And ""Relationship"" would fall in between at 4 stars for making recent history seem new again. Keep it up HBO!

1339060,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B003EV6DCG,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","Barry Levinson's film does an excellent job bringing to life the crusade and public life of Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  Al Pacino does an amazing job.  I love Dr. Kevorkian's comment in the DVD extra which was something like, ""He looked more like me than I do!""  Brenda Vaccaro plays Jack's sister Margo who helps Jack, despite Kevorkian's social limitations.  Vaccaro gives an insightful performance, particularly in the scene in the diner where she and Jack have a full-blast argument.  John Goodman who plays Neal, the medical supplier and friend of Jack, gives a subtle performance as even he has to tell Jack the limits.  Susan Sarandon grounds the film with a subtle earthy performance.  Danny Huston's Geoffrey Fieger is a flamboyant character that Huston embodies without reservation.  Although confined to the final frames, Tony-winner Rondi Reed who currently has a reoccurring role on CBS's ""Mike & Molly"" turns in a brilliant performance as the no-nonsense Judge Cooper who will not put up with Kevorkian's antics.  At one point, Pacino's Kevorkian says to her, ""I'm a guest here.""  She replies, ""No, you're the defendant.""  Reed's monologue about justice powerfully concludes and frames the issues of the film.  The DVD extra is well worth a peek.  It is helpful to see the real Kevorkian's sense of humor on display and how Pacino dived into the character.

1339062,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B003EV6DCG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 5]","You Don't Know Jack masterfully tells the somewhat unusual, very controversial yet true story of a retired physician, Jack Kevorkian (played to perfection by Al Pacino) who decided to help a new group of patients--those who were clearly terminally ill. Specifically, as you may already know, Kevorkian (aka ""Dr. Death"") wanted to help them end their lives because they (and often their families) did not want their suffering to continue any longer. The film takes a most compassionate look at this highly controversial doctor who helped people commit suicide; and of course your opinion of this film will be positive or negative because of your opinion of euthanasia before you even begin to watch it.However, even if you're against euthanasia, there's still a lot to learn about this incredibly complicated yet gifted man who was a musician, a man who taught himself Japanese and a painter even if his paintings were not exactly fun to look at. The casting was very well done and the plot moves along very well; I was never once bored and I myself learned a lot about Jack Kevorkian. Look also for a fine performance by John Goodman as Kevorkian's trusted friend Neal Nicol; Susan Sarandon as Hemlock Society activist Janet Good and Danny Huston as Jack's lawyer Geoffrey Fieger--who never charged Jack a nickel! In addition, Brenda Vacarro does a superb job of playing Jack's sister Margo; Jack's relationships with Margo and Janet give us a great opportunity to see how Jack interacted with women when he was quite the bachelor.The plot is essentially what I have told you already, although there are plenty of true to life plot twists and turns for you to discover as you watch this film. I'm not going to include a lot of spoilers here!The DVD comes with only one extra entitled ""The Real Jack/Inner Circle;"" but it's quite good as it includes footage with the real Jack Kevorkian, Neal Nicol and Geoffrey Fieger. Al Pacino, Susan Sarandon, Brenda Vacarro and Geoffrey Fieger also speak; but it's just not long enough.

Obviously. After all, he is Al Pacino.+ The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Susan Sarandon as Kevorkian's friend and supporter, Janet Good, and Danny Huston as Jack's outspoken attorney, Geoffrey Fieger.+ The subject matter is of course very interesting and handled very well. I am not sure if the filmmakers used the original videos made by Kevorkian's patients, but they appeared to be super realistic. The entire film was very emotional and forces viewers to analyze their own morals very closely.The Cons:- There's no back-story to this movie at all. It basically opens with Kevorkian deciding to help people die. I was hoping to learn a little bit behind the man known as Dr. Death. Who is he? What was his life like before he started doing this? The movie doesn't go into any of that except to make a point out of saying that people never really got to know Jack. I guess that's the angle they were going for, but it was disappointing. There could have been more information, especially up front.- I love Susan Sarandon, but what the heck was she doing in this movie?! She didn't have a lot of screen time, and although she played her small part very well, it just seemed beneath her. I thought her appearance in this film was a waste of her talents.Overall, I recommend watching this movie if you are interested in euthanasia and would like to learn more about Jack Kevorkian, but I'm warning you...you won't learn much more than you already know.",3,I still don't know Jack,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,1651,"['was', 'super', 'excited', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'expected', 'to.The', 'Pros', '+', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Kervorkian', 'delivers', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Obviously', 'Al', 'Pacino.+', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Kevorkian', 'friend', 'supporter', 'Janet', 'Good', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Jack', 'outspoken', 'attorney', 'Geoffrey', 'Fieger.+', 'subject', 'matter', 'course', 'very', 'interesting', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'original', 'videos', 'made', 'Kevorkian', 'patients', 'appeared', 'be', 'super', 'realistic', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'forces', 'viewers', 'analyze', 'own', 'morals', 'very', 'closely.The', 'Cons', 'back-story', 'movie', 'basically', 'Kevorkian', 'deciding', 'help', 'people', 'die', 'was', 'hoping', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'man', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Death', 'Who', 'What', 'was', 'life', 'started', 'doing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'make', 'point', 'saying', 'people', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'Jack', 'guess', 'angle', 'were', 'going', 'was', 'disappointing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'information', 'especially', 'front.-', 'love', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'doing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'played', 'small', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'seemed', 'thought', 'appearance', 'film', 'was', 'waste', 'talents.Overall', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'euthanasia', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'more', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', ""'m"", 'warning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'already', 'know']",You Don't Know Jack

He would continue this discordant activity well over one hundred times and the law was unable to stop him...until he went too far and injected the lethal drugs himself, an act that he dared to show on national television.Al Pacino delivers what is certainly the finest performance of his career in this HBO feature, completely submerging himself in the role of Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  All of his ""Pacinoisms"" are absent in his portrayal.  His Emmy Award was well deserved.Directed by Barry Levinson from Adam Mazar's script, the compelling, insightful drama tries to explore the inner mind and personality of ""Dr. Death,"" and it is as successful as any film can probably be in discovering the controversial figure's ""inner demon"".Interestingly (an wisely), the filmmakers decided to begin this often bleak drama almost as a ""black comedy,"" its first half hour or so exploring the off-the-wall lives of Kevorkian, his sister (Brenda Vaccaro) and his friend (John Goodman), who owns a medical supply business.  It's only after the doctor begins his work in earnest and we get to meet some of his patients that the story becomes more serious and heart wrenching.  One of his later court appearances, however, is quite funny.In the end, viewers may be more sympathetic to Kevorkian's ""right to die"" message than they are to him, whose downfall was due, in part, to his seemingly massive ego.Susan Sarandon, as a Kevorkian supporter, Danny Huston, in the role of his flamboyant attorney, and the rest of the cast deliver persuasive performances.It appears that some of the videos incorporated into the film are of Kevorkian's actual patients.

1339069,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B003EV6DCG,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[0, 0]","My earliest memory of Jack Kevorkian came with a feature article in Cornerstone Magazine. The year was 1990 and Dr. Kevorkian had just entered the national spotlight after assisting in the suicide of Alzheimer&#8217;s patient Janet Adkins. The magazine&#8217;s feature interview left quite the impression. And it was deeply unsettling. Here was a man who was calling for &#8220;obitoriums&#8221; in major cities where people could go to be euthanized. Here was a man who cavalierly set aside any clearly articulated ethic, and eschewed all abstract philosophical or theological principles as guidelines for ethical conduct. Kevorkian seemed to do ethics by the seat of his pants. As he boldly declared:&#8220;It&#8217;s ethical conduct within the framework of time and space. Ethical codes should never be set in stone. They can&#8217;t be, they must change constantly. That&#8217;s why we have problems today, because most of the ethics are dictated by inflexible religious doctrine: &#8216;Human life is divine, it cannot be ended.&#8217; Who said it? I don&#8217;t feel holy. You can&#8217;t make one doctrine fit everybody. It&#8217;s between patient and doctor. That&#8217;s all it is. Nothing else counts. The code of ethics should be based only on medical knowledge. No theology, no philosophic doctrines that are abstract. Only what is really valid medically!&#8221; (Cornerstone Magazine, Vol. 19, issue 93, 1990).It is true that circumstances change, and it is extremely difficult to anticipate every possible situation. But it was something altogether different (and more radical) to say that the very ethical codes that guide us in changing circumstances are themselves changing. The truth is that Kevorkian was not really following a post-philosophical ethic. Indeed, his endorsement of a radically contextualized patient/doctor relationship was clearly based on a situation ethics rooted in a protean principle of patient self-determination. In other words, he too was assuming a &#8220;philosophic doctrine&#8221;.Over the next decade I heard about Kevorkian often in the news, and my impression was always the same: a brazen, secular narcissist who cared little for the established norms and ethics of civil society.Yesterday I sat down to watch HBO&#8217;s 2010 film &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Know Jack&#8221; which tells Kevorkian&#8217;s story from the death of Janet Adkins up to his imprisonment in 1999. I had high hopes for the film: in my view HBO films are as reliably good as BMW sedans and Coldplay albums. And &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Know Jack&#8221; didn&#8217;t disappoint. Throughout the film I had to keep reminding myself that I was looking at Al Pacino playing Jack Kevorkian rather than Kevorkian himself. The other performances &#8212; including Susan Sarandon and John Goodman &#8212; were equally strong.&#8220;You Don&#8217;t Know Jack&#8221; is definitely a sympathetic bio-pic. Predictably there is little sympathy shown to the &#8220;religious right&#8221; opposition which is reduced to a handful of angry protesters furiously thrusting placards skyward as Kevorkian shuffles past. However, it is far from hagiography. The image of an emotionally stunted and impulsive figure comes through clearly. And more than once you get the sense that Kevorkian can be his own worst enemy as when he harangues entire courtrooms. In one memorable scene he attends a gala evening celebrating Time Magazine&#8217;s 75th anniversary, and he stands alone as a pariah as others stare on in &#8220;What&#8217;s he doing here?&#8221; bemusement. A martyr for a just cause, or a social outcast on the margins? The viewer is left to decide.Today I am more sympathetic toward the idea of euthanasia than I was twenty-three years ago. That sympathy has grown out of real life cases like those narrated in the powerful 2011 documentary &#8220;How do Die in Oregon&#8221; and Frontline&#8217;s 2010 documentary &#8220;The Suicide Tourist&#8220;.At the same time, I am even more aware of the ethical complications. Once euthanasia becomes an option how do you avoid patients feeling pressure to choose death brought on by a financially taxed medical system and emotionally and financially taxed family members? And how do you avoid extending quality of life assessments beyond the woolly concept of &#8220;terminally ill&#8221; to those mentally depressed? And how can death intervention be reconciled to the physician&#8217;s call to do no harm? And how do you protect the line between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia? As I write this review Belgium is considering extending its voluntary euthanasia law to children who are suffering unbearable pain. The decision would require a psychologist to ensure that the child understands the consequences of his/her decision. I find the idea astonishing. Which child can truly understand the consequences of death?Kevorkian&#8217;s response that ethical codes change constantly is hardly comforting. Indeed, it might seem like little more than grease slathered on an already slippery slope. &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Know Jack&#8221; doesn&#8217;t provide many answers. But wow, does it ever raise the questions.randalrauser.com",4,I didn't know Jack,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,5186,"['earliest', 'memory', 'Jack', 'Kevorkian', 'came', 'feature', 'article',

He sounds the same, has same body frame and has the same speech pattern. (By the way, sadly there are no other ""special features"" included, not even a brief commentary track.With the subject of assisted suicide, there will always be sides. And - depending on your age, religious beliefs and family medical history you will certainly take sides as you watch this film. But it is based on the actual facts and so I won't give you an outcome of the trial case (though by now you've probably read one of the earlier reviews and  know how the story ends).Let me just say that Pacino's performance is perfect (not near-perfect, Perfect!) and Susan Sarandon, Brenda Vaccaro and John Goodman are nearly as good.

Regardless of how you feel about Kevorkian, he didn't want to see people suffer and linger on needlessly. Regardless of how you feel about euthanasia or doctor assisted suicide, Kevorkian gladly went to prison and jail and a hunger strike for his purpose.The DVD also showed a ten minute behind the scenes about Kevorkian's inner circle of friends and sister.

What if you weren't going to get better? What would you do?Jack Kevorkian (played by Al Pacino) was a pathologist but, by the time we join the story he has left his career behind. His friends and colleagues say he's retired but Kevorkian (Pacino) states that retirement means you are no longer preoccupied with your chosen profession and that he is simply unemployed. Being unemployed, he has a great deal of free time and is intrigued by a local news story. A man who is paralyzed from the neck down wishes to end his life while the hospital caring for him is fighting to prevent it. Kevorkian had written several articles on euthanasia for foreign periodicals by that time and was now determined to make practical use of his theories. The hospital learned of his intentions, stopped him, and the patient died of starvation. Nevertheless, our protagonist continued his search for a patient. Assisting him in this quest, the doctor had longtime friend and colleague, Neal Nicol (played by John Goodman) and his loving sister, Margo (played by Brenda Vaccaro). In time, he is approached by a married couple, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's and her husband. This presents Kevorkian with an ethical dilemma, as Alzheimer's is not a fatal disease. Once Margo (Vaccaro) puts the matter in perspective, they begin devising a plan. While searching for a location, Kevorkian approached a member of the Hemlock Society by the name of Janet Good. Good (played by Susan Sarandon) offers the use of her home but later reneges. In spite of that, the plan is carried out and Kevorkian becomes national news.If you ask most people about the Right to Die movement, they'd probably tell you that reasonable people could disagree on the matter. Personally, I don't understand that, as I am an advocate of personal choice. Likewise, I believe this movie is incredible and cannot comprehend anyone thinking otherwise. Pacino has partnered with HBO on another project Phil Spector, about the renowned music producer. Maybe it's the fact that, deep down, Kevorkian is a sympathetic figure and Spector is not but, the latter film fell flat, at least for me.

Great acting, very moving, well done movie.As a person of Armenian descent I appreciated having the Armenian Holocaust discussed. Many people are unaware of it.After watching this movie I felt unsure about Kevorkian. Was he really a compassionate, caring human being who wanted to stop suffering, or was he a psychologically unbalanced guy who liked the power of ending someone's life???So I watched the excellent documentary ""Kevorkian"". This was a good, compassionate man, another human rights activist imprisoned by a corrupt and unfair judicial system.He always wanted his clients to chose to live. But believed that they had to right to decide. Of note is that he never charged for his services.Two things probably formed his character and activities-being the son of victims of the Armenian Holocaust, hearing the stories of it, and no doubt being traumatized by this-and the horrible experience of his Mother's death (I assume when he was an adult). They asked their doctor to help her die. He refused. So this poor woman had to suffer until the end.Assisted suicide has it's problems and possible abuses. Thoughtful people have different views on it. Some objections come from authoritarian views in which human beings are not seen as being fully autonomous.Arguments that we should not interfere with the natural processes as this interfers with 'God's will' truly do not hold water. We constantly interfere with natural processes in medical care, and certainly extreme measures such as feeding tubes and breathing machines are 'interference'. One can also ask, if God gives us these abilities, why would it be wrong to use them?Our society still murders people as part of the 'justice system'. Young men and women die in illegal wars, Cheney and Bush commit war crimes and are never held accountable.But this civil rights activist ends up in a maximum security prison??? For 8 years???It was an atrocity that Kavorkian went to prison, but a maxium security prison???
