I read Jon's comments about this dvd and that stopped me from ordering this when it came out.  I was a fool!  This was at a time when the band was arguably at their best songwise as well as line-up wise.  I live in Pittsburgh where metal is basically dead.  I will never see Iced Earth unless I travel far.  The chance to hear and now see this band perform live is just so, so wonderful.  I can't think of a better word.  I couldn't stop smiling through the first 7 songs when I first played this.  I didn't have the time to sit through the entire thing at one time but this is just great.  This is a rival to the classic Iron Maiden concert release ""Live After Death"".  The 3 cameras are a blessing, not a negative as from what I have read from other reviewers.  I want to watch the guitarist play a solo or watch Jon play a riff or Matthew sing the song.  The trend in videos for the new millenium is to have the strobe light editing effect where a person is shown for less than a second and a continue barrage on the senses.  A concert is never like this and sitting at home should be a plesure, not give you a  headache.  Maiden continues to do this and therefore will never have another great concert video.  This shows a great band in concert and you as the viewer get to have a front row seat for the entire show.  The power these guys had, this is a great snapshot in time when Iced Earth mattered.  This is for THE Iced Earth fan and anyone who loves metal.  I remember buying the 3 CD set of these shows and that is great.  This is for the eyes as well.  Anyone looking for perfection should maybe look elsewhere but tell me who has released the perfect concert dvd?  Iced Earth live in 1999.  Get It.  Not a bad price either.",5,"This has been on the shelf for all these years, why?",1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1839,"['have', ""n't"", 'written', 'review', 'long', 'time', 'basically', 'stopped', 'doing', 'Then', 'bought', 'dvd', 'read', 'Jon', 'comments', 'dvd', 'stopped', 'ordering', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'fool', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'band', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'songwise', 'as', 'well', 'line-up', 'wise', 'live', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'metal', 'basically', 'dead', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'travel', 'far', 'chance', 'hear', 'now', 'see', 'band', 'perform', 'live', 'just', 'so', 'so', 'wonderful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'word', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'smiling', 'first', '7', 'songs', 'when', 'first', 'played', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'sit', 'entire', 'thing', 'one', 'time', 'just', 'great', 'rival', 'classic', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'concert', 'release', 'Live', 'Death', '3', 'cameras', 'are', 'blessing', 'not', 'negative', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'want', 'watch', 'guitarist', 'play', 'solo', 'watch', 'Jon', 'play', 'riff', 'Matthew', 'sing', 'song', 'trend', 'videos', 'new', 'millenium', 'have', 'strobe', 'light', 'editing', 'effect', 'where', 'person', 'shown', 'less', 'second', 'continue', 'barrage', 'senses', 'concert', 'never', 'sitting', 'home', 'should', 'be', 'plesure', 'not', 'give', 'headache', 'Maiden', 'do', 'therefore', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'great', 'concert', 'video', 'great', 'band', 'concert', 'viewer', 'get', 'have', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'entire', 'show', 'power', 'guys', 'had', 'great', 'snapshot', 'time', 'when', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'mattered', 'THE', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'metal', 'remember', 'buying', '3', 'CD', 'set', 'shows', 'great', 'eyes', 'well', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'perfection', 'should', 'maybe', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'tell', 'who', 'released', 'perfect', 'concert', 'dvd', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'live', '1999', 'Get', 'Not', 'bad', 'price']",N/A

Lisanti ""Metal Rob""","[12, 12]","Here an awesome review!Iced Earth: Alive in Athens (DVD)Join me for a little Heavy Metal time travel as we go back to the year 1999 to find Iced Earth as they record their first concert performance ever. The album would be done in Athens, Greece in front of a comfortable but still sizable audience and be called Alive In Athens. If you are one of the many Metal bangers that own the triple CD set already, then you are well-aware about this concert and just how excellent it was in capturing the best songs that Iced Earth had to offer the world at that time. The recording found the band in tip-top shape and holding a solid footing in their quest for Heavy Metal dominance. Our return from this trip to 2006 will lead us to the news of an old archive being discovered and inside this would be a long forgotten filming of this concert. The footage would be raw and was shot by a three member video team present at the event. Conversion to a more reliable format using the technology available was a smart thought and the decision to share this with the legions of Iced Earth fans became an immediate one. The audio was given some remaster treatment and soon it was ready to be unleashed on the public. It was a great find for Metal as fans everywhere are scooping up bootlegs at conventions and people are posting their own recordings on mediums like MySpace or YouTube. As a concert itself there are moments in the film that make you feel as though you are watching from the balconies while others place you on the stage looking out to the crowd. There are no dynamic effects and instead it's just a sparsely decorated stage with the band members doling out the Metal in excellent fashion. The three cameras do a great job and while some might balk at the limited amount of videographers at least we got something from this monumental show. Recent interviews have found Schaffer himself displeased with the idea of this videos release but it is the only way to see a full concert with the former singer Matthew Barlow; a performer that a majority of the bands fan base misses very much. Sonically and visually I found nothing wrong with this release and totally recommend it for Iced Earth fans old and new. The amount of full concert footage from Iced Earth is currently limited to this release and if you find yourself wanting a show with this line up you need to look no further than here to get it. Twenty eight songs and running 2.5 hours you cannot go wrong with it. Iced Earth has had a number of lineup changes over the years and Schaffer as founder, remains the only constant of the musical vision. Everyone else in the band for this film has moved on to other pursuits in music and life by this time. This video finds the membership roster as Jon Schaffer (guitar), Matthew Barlow (vocals), James MacDonough (bass), Larry Tarnowski (lead guitar), Brent Smedley (drums) and Rick Risberg (keyboards). As a Metal fan that got into this band later than I should have I was happy to find this video released as it is a musical education in the bands back catalog. Favorite tunes are ""Melancholy"", ""Burning Times"", and ""Walking In Stygian"" among many others.Bonus features include Jon in Athens and backstage footage. A booklet is included and loaded with photos, song lyrics and cool graphics that the group was known for. This is a must have for any Metal fan.Song Listing1. Intro2. Burning Times3.

1017796,A1KFAHS34UZDWJ,B000I0QL9G,The Truth Hurts,"[31, 54]","""I've been asked recently about the release of the 'Alive in Athens' DVD and I want my position on this to be very clear to all of the Iced Earth fans out there. In my opinion, this is purely a money grab on behalf of Century Media Records. The reason that it was never released before is because the footage is substandard. This was only a three-camera shoot that was done for a German music television channel called Viva. I hosted the show as a guest VJ and played videos from different bands as well as a few tunes from the 'Alive in Athens' concert.About a year ago, Century Media contacted me and asked if I'd like to be involved in doing this. I said that I did not think it was a good idea based on my memory of the footage, but to go ahead and send me some of the camera angles on DVD so I could think about it. After viewing the footage I felt that it would be extremely difficult to make a release that would live up to the standards that we have set for Iced Earth over the years. So I turned the project down.Several weeks ago, I learned that they were determined to release this DVD anyway. When I found this out I asked to see the edit and they obliged. After viewing it and seeing how weak it is I asked if they would be willing to fly me over and rework some of the edits. The answer was no, they did not think it could be done better. That translates into, 'We don't want to spend the money to make it the best it can be.'So here's the deal: I want you all to be aware of what it is that they are releasing. This is a very low-budget, badly edited video of an amazing concert and an awesome period in the history of Iced Earth. They promised me that they are going to keep the price down and that they are not going to market it as something it's not. But I feel it's my responsibility to let you know the reality of the situation.I've often regretted that there was never a high-quality filming of the band during that period but it was something that we could never persuade the label to do. And it's not cheap if you do it right.Iced Earth will be filming a real DVD on the next world tour. This will be what the fans have been waiting for. It will consist of a 16-camera crew with cranes and a real stage show and all of the things necessary to finally bring to the fans a state-of-the-art DVD that will really give you the feeling of being at an Iced Earth show.The decision to purchase the 'Alive in Athens' DVD is up to you. I just want you to be aware of what it is you're getting should you choose to do so.I don't want to make it sound like it's some horrible bootleg, because it's not it's just not up to the standards that you've come to expect from us.""",1,Jon Schaffer (of ICED EARTH) would like you to know about this DVD...,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,2684,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'asked', 'recently', 'release', ""'Alive"", 'Athens', 'DVD', 'want', 'position', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'out', 'there', 'opinion', 'purely', 'money', 'grab', 'behalf', 'Century', 'Media', 'Records', 'reason', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'before', 'footage', 'substandard', 'was', 'only', 'three-camera', 'shoot', 'was', 'done', 'German', 'music', 'television', 'channel', 'called', 'Viva', 'hosted', 'show', 'guest', 'VJ', 'played', 'videos', 'different', 'bands', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'tunes', ""'Alive"", 'Athens', 'concert.About', 'year', 'ago', 'Century', 'Media', 'contacted', 'asked', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'involved', 'doing', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'based', 'memory', 'footage', 'go', 'ahead', 'send', 'camera', 'DVD', 'could', 'think', 'viewing', 'footage', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'make', 'release', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'have', 'set', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'years', 'So', 'turned', 'project', 'down.Several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'learned', 'were', 'determined', 'release', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'asked', 'see', 'edit', 'obliged', 'viewing', 'seeing', 'how', 'weak', 'asked', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'fly', 'rework', 'edits', 'answer', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'money', 'make', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'here', 'deal', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'are', 'releasing', 'very', 'low-budget', 'badly', 'edited', 'video', 'amazing', 'concert', 'awesome', 'period', 'history', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'promised', 'are', 'going', 'keep', 'price', 'down', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'market', 'something', 'not', 'feel', 'responsibility', 'let', 'know', 'reality', 'situation.I', ""'ve"", 'often', 'regretted', 'was', 'never', 'high-quality', 'filming', 'band', 'period', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'persuade', 'label', 'do', 'not', 'cheap', 'do', 'right.Iced', 'Earth', 'will', 'be', 'filming', 'real', 'DVD', 'next', 'world', 'tour', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'will', 'consist', '16-camera', 'crew', 'cranes', 'real', 'stage', 'show', 'things', 'necessary', 'finally', 'bring', 'fans', 'state-of-the-art', 'DVD', 'will', 'really', 'give', 'feeling', 'being', 'Iced', 'Earth', 'show.The', 'decision', 'purchase', ""'Alive"", 'Athens', 'DVD', 'up', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'should', 'choose', 'do', 'so.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'horrible', 'bootleg', 'not', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect']",N/A
