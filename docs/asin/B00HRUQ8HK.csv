The acting was good and the mystery stays just that until the very end. While I thought I knew who did it, it was not until the end that everything became clear. This was a well written movie and I for one would love to be able to see Lori Loughlin in more of these movies, or even as a series. This movie was a lot of fun and the idea of the mysteries was novel and different.

Also, it was strange to see so many yard sales at BIG houses--real mansions--which seemed like odd settings.  Basically the mystery is just kind of mundane:  a woman is found dead; was it an accident or was she murdered?  That's it.  The only real up side to the movie was that the main character's family were down-to-earth individuals.  It's a relief to see a husband and wife who actually like each other and get along with their children!",3,"Nothing New, Just Routine",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,518,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'dark', 'sad', 'Also', 'was', 'strange', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'yard', 'sales', 'BIG', 'houses', 'real', 'mansions', 'seemed', 'odd', 'settings', 'Basically', 'mystery', 'just', 'kind', 'mundane', 'woman', 'found', 'dead', 'was', 'accident', 'was', 'murdered', 'only', 'real', 'up', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'family', 'were', 'down-to-earth', 'individuals', 'relief', 'see', 'husband', 'wife', 'who', 'actually', 'other', 'get', 'along', 'children']",Garage Sale Mystery
1691775,AS2SJP1G389FE,B00HRUQ8HK,"Katie Gallen ""Katie""","[0, 0]","Garage Sale Mystery is about a woman named Jennifer Shannon (Lori Loughlin) who loves going to garage sales on Saturday mornings. Jennifer works at a second hand store with her friend, Danielle (Sarah Strange).  Every Saturday after Jennifer buys something at a garage sale she brings it back to the shop to sell it again.  One Saturday morning when Jennifer was about to leave the house to go to another garage sale, she notices that there are a lot of break-ins in nice areas where there had been a garage sale recently. One Saturday afternoon Jennifer drives to a garage sale that just so happens to be her friend, Kate's (Anne Marie DeLuise)  house.  A couple of days later Jennifer calls Kate and she does not answer. Jennifer goes into the house and sees Kate laying on the floor dead. Jennifer calls 911 and talks to a man named Adam Iverson (Andrew Dunbar).  Jennifer and Adam both work together to find out who killed Kate. Jennifer and Adam first think the people who killed Kate were these three burglars who broke in the other houses who had garage sales,  Celeste (Britt Irvin) Ralph (Matty Finochio) and Fred (Sebastian Gacki).  Watch this movie to see who killed Kate.  IT WILL SURPRISE YOU. I am not a fan of murder movies but I loved Lori Loughlin as Aunt Becky in Full House.  If you remember  Lori Loughlin as Aunt Becky watch this movie. She is great in this.
