1548812,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B0089BSMWA,Andre Dursin,"[47, 53]","Steve Martin, renaissance man - writer, author, comedian, playwright, screenwriter, producer, actor, banjo player extraordinaire - is more than deserving of his own Shout! Factory retrospective, and the label's wonderful STEVE MARTIN: THE TELEVISION STUFF ranks as one of the year's most enjoyable DVD catalog retrospectives.Available on September 18th, this three-disc set focuses primarily on the early Martin years, with his two taped concert performances and handful of network TV specials comprising the set's first two platters. Martin's stand-up is particularly noteworthy, seeing as he abandoned it in lieu of his feature-film career. In both a 1976 HBO special and a 1978 appearance at the Universal Ampitheatre (included in the 1984 home video special ""Homage to Steve,"" along with the funny short ""The Absent-Minded Waiter""), Martin shows off both his adroit comedy writing and a side of his on-screen ""persona"" that viewers unfamiliar with his early material will find especially amusing. Unlike other stand-up acts which haven't weathered the years well (including the Richard Pryor concert films, which I've seen recently on cable, and are almost entirely dependant on drug/shock humor that's no longer shocking), Martin's material is sly and offbeat, relying on his ""performance"" as a hapless magician and comedian to milk laughs out of intentionally-poor material.Martin moved on to a series of network TV specials before hitting it big as an `80s big-screen star - the 1978 effort ""A Wild and Crazy Guy,"" 1980's ""Comedy Is Not Pretty"" and ""All Commercials,"" and 1981's ""Steve Martin's Best Show Ever"" are all included here and work well within the confines of their genre, mostly comprised of SNL-like sketches with a series of guest stars appearing within (as Martin notes in a new interview split onto each of the three discs, the era of the star-driven network TV special was fading when he agreed to star in them). Disc three, meanwhile, is a self-described ""Bits and Pieces"" anthology of Martin appearances on SNL, Letterman, The Tonight Show, his Mark Twain acceptance speech from 2006, and even his first TV appearance in 1966 on ""Dusty's Attic.""It's a tremendous compilation of nostalgic - and occasionally hilarious - material from a gifted comedian that's well worth revisiting or, perhaps, discovering for the first time - especially among younger viewers who may only know Martin from limp ""comedies"" like the ""Pink Panther"" and ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" films (and if that's the only Steve Martin they know, then shame on them!).",5,Classic Martin and One of the Year's Best DVD Retropsectives,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2556,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'renaissance', 'man', 'writer', 'author', 'comedian', 'playwright', 'screenwriter', 'producer', 'actor', 'banjo', 'player', 'extraordinaire', 'more', 'deserving', 'own', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'retrospective', 'label', 'wonderful', 'STEVE', 'MARTIN', 'TELEVISION', 'STUFF', 'one', 'year', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'catalog', 'retrospectives.Available', 'September', '18th', 'three-disc', 'set', 'focuses', 'primarily', 'early', 'Martin', 'years', 'two', 'taped', 'concert', 'performances', 'handful', 'network', 'TV', 'specials', 'comprising', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'platters', 'Martin', 'stand-up', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'seeing', 'abandoned', 'lieu', 'feature-film', 'career', '1976', 'HBO', 'special', '1978', 'appearance', 'Universal', 'Ampitheatre', 'included', '1984', 'home', 'video', 'special', 'Homage', 'Steve', 'funny', 'short', 'Absent-Minded', 'Waiter', 'Martin', 'off', 'adroit', 'comedy', 'writing', 'side', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'early', 'material', 'will', 'find', 'especially', 'amusing', 'other', 'stand-up', 'acts', 'have', ""n't"", 'weathered', 'years', 'well', 'including', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'concert', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'cable', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'dependant', 'drug/shock', 'humor', 'longer', 'shocking', 'Martin', 'material', 'sly', 'offbeat', 'relying', 'performance', 'hapless', 'magician', 'comedian', 'milk', 'intentionally-poor', 'material.Martin', 'moved', 'series', 'network', 'TV', 'specials', 'hitting', 'big', '80s', 'big-screen', 'star', '1978', 'effort', 'A', 'Wild', 'Crazy', 'Guy', '1980', 'Comedy', 'Not', 'Pretty', 'Commercials', '1981', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Best', 'Show', 'Ever', 'are', 'included', 'here', 'work', 'well', 'confines', 'genre', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'SNL-like', 'sketches', 'series', 'guest', 'stars', 'appearing', 'Martin', 'notes', 'new', 'interview', 'split', 'three', 'discs', 'era', 'star-driven', 'network', 'TV', 'special', 'was', 'fading', 'when', 'agreed', 'star', 'Disc', 'three', 'meanwhile', 'self-described', 'Bits', 'Pieces', 'anthology', 'Martin', 'appearances', 'SNL', 'Letterman', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'acceptance', 'speech', '2006', 'even', 'first', 'TV', 'appearance', '1966', 'Dusty', 'Attic', 'tremendous', 'compilation', 'nostalgic', 'occasionally', 'hilarious', 'material', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'well', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'perhaps', 'discovering', 'first', 'time', 'especially', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'only', 'know', 'Martin', 'limp', 'comedies', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'films', 'only', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'know', 'then', 'shame']",N/A

Everything in it is great but The Wild and Crazy Guy special they edited the live parts AND SEGMENTS to make it 34 minutes long. Also those live segments flowed with the show and were DIFFERENT performances than Homage to Steve. You need a bootleg or a copy of the complete show to notice it. In the Comedy is not Pretty special is complete but in the original there was no LAUGH TRACK. Shout always seems to screw things up. It's better with no laugh track. When you watch a original copy it has a different comedic element without a stupid laugh track it was intentional. The rest of it I never seen and to me it seems like it was untouched. I think on the third disc they could of worked a little harder on adding a ton of MORE TV appearances from anything Steve was on. More Sat Night Live more Letterman more Carson etc etc etc. But There is enough in it. The tapes are starting to wear a little from age. HBO I thought was great as well Homage to Steve. I'm seeing Steve live with his band in a month , I last saw him in 1979 when I was 10 ( I was a huge fan then belonged to his offical fan club still have the posters and fanzine ) and that show was a thrill he played a week at that venue, I still own the ticket stub. The interview he did as a bonus I guess was long enough but then I could listen to him talk about the 70's for hours. Ever notice how thin he got in 1981. I gave the box a 5 but a 4 I really wanted to choose because of certain things that could of been dealt with better like leave the main two shows alone. I'll live with the"" other copies "" I have.

I enjoyed that show in person and can say it brought back so many fond memories...I was around 21 when Steve Martin blew up big time as a stand up so he's my (Daniel Tosh, Dane Cook etc.) and holds a special place in my heart along with George Carlin. Steve actually ended up with the career that Carlin had wanted when he began in the late 50's early 60's which saw him move from being court jester to movie star but for my money Steve Martin has never touched in any of his movies the brilliance displayed on these 3 DVDs of lunacy...stupidity..and surprisingly intelligent comedy. Of course I also LOVE all the banjo playing. While I am so happy to have the '79 show I actually attended..the '76 show from the Troubadour was a total surprise (I didn't have HBO in '76 and didn't know anybody else who did) so this even earlier nugget filmed more in a club environment is the perfect opening show!Its a great mix of classic stand up and sketch comedy which is very much of its time but goodness when you have a Pre-Pee Wee Herman Paul Reubens a post Starsky & Hutch Antonio Vargas, classic Louie Nye...legendary writer Pat Proft and others like Richard Deacon and Peter Graves in your casts...you have a time capsule that is full of funny.the DVD quality is very good...best source material possible and Steve's bonus interview on each DVD is also current and appreciated as an extra...in particular there is an option to view the bonus disc with Steve giving a brief intro to each segment and it really adds a great deal to that set. It seems a bit pricy but this is a comedy treasure and deserves to be archived with the great old Carlin specials.I'd like to add a recommendation of another DVD I found on Amazon.com92Y-Steve Martin (December 9, 2007)This is an hour interview with Charlie Rose.
