Luther ""pulled the sheet off"" of the Pope's indulgence scam and that had the Pope wanting Luther dead. Sadly, like many revolutionaries, Luther quickly sold out to power. Luther thought he needed the protection of earthly power from the Pope and he got that protection from Prince Frederick III. Frederick had had enough of the Pope looting his kingdom in Germany for indulgence money to use to pay for the Pope's trashy lifestyle in Rome. Of course, like any tyrant, Frederick wanted to keep the loot for himself. So, Luther's revolt against the Pope's indulgences was the perfect answer to stop the Pope's looting of Frederick's kingdom.Luther got protection from Frederick to ""preach the gospel"" and in exchange Luther gave moral authority to not paying for indulgences and stopping the cash flow out of Frederick's pocket as well as supporting Frederick's tyranny against a peasant revolt. As you will see in the movie, the peasants logically thought that since Luther revolted against the tyranny of the Pope, they had a God given mandate to revolt against the tyranny of Frederick III.  Luther, however, heartily supported the tyrant against the peasants and thousands of peasants died.Luther's support of Frederick's tyranny began the Lutheran church's long standing support of tyrants so long as the tyrant lets the Lutheran church preach ""the gospel"". The Lutheran church's history of supporting tyrants include King George III of Great Britain in American Revolutionary days, Hitler and his Third Reich that murdered millions and USA's tyrants that have made wars against millions of peasant people in the USA and around the world. It would have added interesting historical continuity to the film to show how Luther's support of Frederick III laid the foundation for Lutheranism's sad historical record of never speaking up to and supporting tyrants. Based upon his support of Frederick III, Luther would have given Hitler at hearty, ""Sieg Heil!",4,Martin Luther Original German Sieg Heil Mine Fuhrer!,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,2046,"['Important', 'historical', 'tale', 'one', 'great', 'original', 'stand-up', 'power', 'guys', 'history', 'pulled', 'sheet', 'Pope', 'indulgence', 'scam', 'had', 'Pope', 'wanting', 'Luther', 'dead', 'Sadly', 'many', 'revolutionaries', 'Luther', 'quickly', 'sold', 'out', 'power', 'thought', 'needed', 'protection', 'earthly', 'power', 'Pope', 'got', 'protection', 'Prince', 'Frederick', 'III', 'Frederick', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'Pope', 'looting', 'kingdom', 'Germany', 'indulgence', 'money', 'use', 'pay', 'Pope', 'trashy', 'lifestyle', 'Rome', 'course', 'tyrant', 'Frederick', 'wanted', 'keep', 'loot', 'So', 'Luther', 'revolt', 'Pope', 'indulgences', 'was', 'perfect', 'answer', 'stop', 'Pope', 'looting', 'Frederick', 'kingdom.Luther', 'got', 'protection', 'Frederick', 'preach', 'gospel', 'exchange', 'Luther', 'gave', 'moral', 'authority', 'not', 'paying', 'indulgences', 'stopping', 'cash', 'flow', 'Frederick', 'pocket', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'Frederick', 'tyranny', 'peasant', 'revolt', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'peasants', 'logically', 'thought', 'Luther', 'revolted', 'tyranny', 'Pope', 'had', 'God', 'given', 'mandate', 'revolt', 'tyranny', 'Frederick', 'III', 'Luther', 'however', 'heartily', 'supported', 'tyrant', 'peasants', 'thousands', 'peasants', 'died.Luther', 'support', 'Frederick', 'tyranny', 'began', 'Lutheran', 'church', 'long', 'standing', 'support', 'tyrants', 'so', 'long', 'tyrant', 'Lutheran', 'church', 'preach', 'gospel', 'Lutheran', 'church', 'history', 'supporting', 'tyrants', 'include', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'Great', 'Britain', 'American', 'Revolutionary', 'days', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich', 'murdered', 'millions', 'USA', 'tyrants', 'have', 'made', 'wars', 'millions', 'peasant', 'people', 'USA', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'interesting', 'historical', 'continuity', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'Luther', 'support', 'Frederick', 'III', 'laid', 'foundation', 'Lutheranism', 'sad', 'historical', 'record', 'never', 'speaking', 'up', 'supporting', 'tyrants', 'Based', 'support', 'Frederick', 'III', 'Luther', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Hitler', 'hearty', 'Sieg', 'Heil']",N/A

If you want a deep philosophical look at Luther's writing, then perhaps a book on the subject would be best. If you want to understand what caused him to write those infamous 95 complaints against a very corrupt Catholic church, buy this film. This PBS documentary shows Martin Luther the man. In it we learn that he gave up on the practice of law to become a monk after losing friends to the plague and having a near-death experience himself. We see the faith that drove him to make a pilgrimage to Rome only to be greeted by an economy based largely on the sale of forgiveness. We come to understand why the church was unable to silence him. We also see that he had his flaws. He shared the prejudice of his times and wanted nothing to do with the peasant class that would fuel the Protestant Reformation.

Everything is reduced to simple and unoriginal conflicts -- father/son, mentor/student, or husband/wife, without any suggestion people can have lives of the mind.Watching ""Martin Luther,"" you'd think Lutheranism owes more to Hans Luther's alleged cruelty to his his son than Augustinian thought.  This idea of the Reformation as a rebellion against all father figures has dogged Lutheran studies since Freud; Heiko Oberman finally slayed the beast in his 1982 biography of the reformer, but the producers apparently didn't read that book.  There is some brief discussion of justification by faith, but hardly any attempt to place that thought in the context of earlier theology.  The restlessness of the German princes under the Pope is given only passing mention, and not a peep is made about Catholic reformers like Erasmus or Thomas More.  It's all Luther: neurotic Luther confessing six times a day, disillusioned Luther coming back from Rome, tired Luther preparing lectures, enlightened Luther sparking the rebellion against the evil, evil papacy with apparently no precedents to draw from.  Most of this, the documentary assures us, stemmed from his dad's cruelty.  It's Reformation as Oedipus complex.The documentary gets Luther's, ahem, earthiness across, and accurately depicts his constant fear of the devil.  It doesn't shy away from his anti-semitism, either.  The talking heads are good but apparently belong to a mutual admiration society; a Roman Catholic commentator was desperately needed.But the weaknesses make the film little better than an episode of Biography.  The obsession with psychology turns Luther into a 16th century version of Judge Judy (Luther: ""The pope should shut his mouth"" Judy: ""I said shut up!"").

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[1, 4]","I tried to watch PBS' &#34;Martin Luther: PBS Empire Series&#34; four or five times before I could get all the way through it. It is hateful anti-Catholic propaganda and it made me sick to my stomach.I'm pro-choice. I'm actively gay friendly. I think I will encounter Jews and atheists in Heaven. I'm a feminist. I don't attend mass regularly. In short, I am hardly an orthodox Catholic. Even so, this documentary made me ill.&#34;Luther&#34; walks the viewer through Catholic churches. As classic Catholic images appear onscreen &#8211; candles, chalices, stained glass &#8211; horror movie music plays on the soundtrack. The viewer is shown images of a naked pope sharing bodily fluid (semen? mucus? I'm not sure) with horned Devils. Liam Neeson's authoritative voice &#8211; this is the Liam Neeson who saved Jews in &#34;Schindler's List,&#34; who rescued his daughter from slavery in &#34;Taken,&#34; who faced off with wolves in &#34;The Grey&#34; &#8211; Liam Neeson's authoritative voice informs the viewer that, without qualification, the Catholic Church is corrupt, exploitative, false, and evil.The Catholic Church is described as completely divorced from the wider population of Europe. In fact Europe itself WAS the Catholic Church. Peasants were the Catholic Church. Nobility was the Catholic Church. Merchants were the Catholic Church. Protestants were the Catholic Church. Luther was a Catholic priest, John Calvin was prepared for the priesthood, and Henry VIII was a defender of the faith.Contrary to PBS, the Catholic Church was not an alien, evil, Italian institution that had nothing to do with Europe. Protestantism began as a movement within the Catholic Church. If &#34;the Church&#34; condemned or supported this or that behavior, that's because pretty much everybody in Europe condemned or supported this or that behavior.The Catholic Church is described as being all powerful. Yet Luther, who defied the Church, died of natural causes, an old man in bed. Apparently the Church was not as all powerful and oppressive as PBS insists.PBS tells us that the Catholic Church controlled innocent Europeans through the sacraments. PBS tells us that it was a really wonderful thing when Luther &#34;liberated&#34; Europeans from the sacraments. Uh huh. Tell a teenage girl that she can never marry &#8211; that she needs to be &#34;liberated&#34; from her wedding day. Absurd. Scholars like van Gennep and Victor Turner have described how rites inscribe belief and enrich lives. People want their sacraments.PBS gets its message across, not just with Liam Neeson's narration, but with scholarly talking heads. These talking heads were the least charismatic talking heads I've ever seen. Miri Rubin was hardest to take, harder even than big-forehead-man with scary looking teeth, or receding-hair-mole-man who insisted that no one before Luther was an individual.Rubin is excruciatingly self-dramatizing. She whispered. She raised her voice like a roller coaster. She made eyes at the interviewer. She wriggled her eyebrows. She thus, in cheap opera heroine fashion, communicated that the Catholic Church was just a big joke. Apparently Rubin focuses on anti-Semitism. An important focus. But is that all there is to say about Catholicism? It's fake and anti-Semitic.I've traveled the world. People ask me my favorite destination. The ONE place I would return to is not the Taj Mahal, is not Jerusalem, is not the African rain forest or the desert. The ONE place I would go back to is Chartres Cathedral. Chartres Cathedral is a product of medieval Catholicism. Nothing that is mere corruption could have produced the most sublime place I have ever been.During the Enlightenment, some wanted to obliterate Chartres Cathedral. Stone masons, forfending this abomination, argued &#34;It would take us years to clear the rubble from the streets.&#34; Thus saving Chartres Cathedral from anti-Catholic campaigners who were blind to the sublime.Who will save Chartres Cathedral from the bomb throwers at PBS?Nazis quoted Luther's writing on Jews to justify their slaughters. Peasants were inspired by the Reformation to rise up against their noble exploiters. Luther knew that if the peasants had their way, his protectors would be shaken. Luther urged the nobles to &#34;whip, choke, hang, burn, behead and torture [peasants], that they may learn to fear the powers that be&#8230;A peasant is a hog, for when a hog is slaughtered it is dead, and in the same way the peasant does not think about the next life&#8230;stab them secretly and openly, as they can, as one would kill a mad dog.&#34; Erasmus estimates that a hundred thousand peasants were killed, with Luther's encouragement.The documentary does mention these aspects of Luther's career, but briefly and as if they were &#8230; footnotes. Not essential. But they are essential. Luther was fond of hate speech, and spoke in the most violent and hateful way against Catholics. The wars between Protestants and Catholics that lasted for two hundred years, and the enmity that exists today, were sparked at least partly by Luther's intemperance.Imagine this. You tune into PBS and see images of the interior of a mosque. You hear horror music, and Liam Neeson's powerful voice informs you, without any question or hesitance in his voice, that Islam is corrupt, exploitative, evil, and must be destroyed in order to save the Middle East. Would you not realize that you had entered an alternative universe?Tell me then, why is it okay for PBS, a taxpayer funded broadcasting station, to peddle anti Catholic hatred like

And the post Worms material is very thin.

It is two hours in length, but at this pace, it should have been four.Only halfway through the show does Luther nail his 95 Theses to the Wittenburg church door; most of the episode focuses on Luther's developing faith as a monk, and his penchant for giving his all to every undertaking.  Finally his rage consumes him and he writes the Theses.  The second hour details Luther's struggle to be heard and his unwillingness to back down from his statements about the corruption in the Catholic Church at the time.  I felt the program did a good job explaining that Luther took this very seriously, that he felt people's salvation was at stake (if they believed in the power of indulgences).  It helps to understand why Luther was willing to put his life on the line, as he surely did.  He was THAT passionate about people, trying to save them from what he believed were grave errors.But after covering Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms, not much more is mentioned before the film ends.  I was surprised that virtually nothing about Luther's theology (salvation via faith alone) was covered.  It seemed that this program was more about the ending of an empire (the Catholic Church) than the beginning of a new one.  And that may have been the producer's intention, I don't know.

I also noticed that the expert who mentioned it was shown just minutes later calling Luther one of the greatest ""emancipators"" of all time. Perhaps.

It combines a talking-heads approach--the testimony of six Luther scholars--with a flashback skeletal narrative--Martin Luther, played by Timothy West, reflecting on his life while on his ""last journey.""Each of the scholars is more animated and communicative than is frequently the case in such documentaries, and their language, along with that of Liam Neeson's 3rd person narrator, is consistently direct and straightforward.  As Luther, West may be the weak addition to the mix.  His arch eyebrows, along with his curiously winking glances at the camera, make it difficult to tell whether he's sad, glad, pensive, apprehensive, or simply clueless about what he's doing in this movie.Unlike at least three theatrical releases with the same title, this ""Luther"" makes little reference to Luther's wife, family and colleagues, but it does offer its own insights: Luther's anti-Semiticism, his support of state authorities who exterminated 100,000 rebellious peasants, and above all his strengths as a writer.  The Luther who emerges is a man of extremes but also an individual of heroic fearlessness, absolute integrity, and undeniable global influence.Credit the striking, panoramic natural scenes and the music score (though too close to Phillip Glass for my taste) for helping the viewer forget that this is a movie in which much is told but very little happens.",4,Effective cinematic slight of hand (3 and a half stars),1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1511,"['modest', 'budget', 'PBS', 'docudrama', 'life', 'significance', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'be', 'accessible', 'engaging', 'informative', 'talking-heads', 'approach', 'testimony', 'six', 'Luther', 'scholars', 'flashback', 'skeletal', 'narrative', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'played', 'Timothy', 'West', 'reflecting', 'life', 'last', 'journey', 'scholars', 'more', 'animated', 'communicative', 'frequently', 'case', 'such', 'documentaries', 'language', 'Liam', 'Neeson', '3rd', 'person', 'narrator', 'consistently', 'direct', 'straightforward', 'Luther', 'West', 'may', 'be', 'weak', 'addition', 'mix', 'arch', 'curiously', 'winking', 'glances', 'camera', 'make', 'difficult', 'tell', 'sad', 'glad', 'pensive', 'apprehensive', 'simply', 'clueless', 'what', 'doing', 'movie.Unlike', 'least', 'three', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'same', 'title', 'Luther', 'little', 'reference', 'Luther', 'wife', 'family', 'colleagues', 'offer', 'own', 'insights', 'Luther', 'anti-Semiticism', 'support', 'state', 'authorities', 'who', 'exterminated', '100,000', 'rebellious', 'peasants', 'strengths', 'writer', 'Luther', 'who', 'man', 'extremes', 'also', 'individual', 'heroic', 'fearlessness', 'absolute', 'integrity', 'undeniable', 'global', 'influence.Credit', 'striking', 'panoramic', 'natural', 'scenes', 'music', 'score', 'too', 'close', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'taste', 'helping', 'viewer', 'forget', 'movie', 'much', 'told', 'very', 'little', 'happens']",N/A
