I bought the DVD anyway and when I put it on, I was completely shocked by the show's beginning theme song. Are those people laughing? Is that a happy catchy toon I hear? What is this?! I couldn't help but to laugh at the nuclear explosions in the background.Paranoia Agent isn't exactly a horror show (why would it be since it's impossible to get scared off of animation), but it has plenty of weird creepiness throughout. Each episode in this DVD centers around a different character as he or she goes insane such as having multiple personalities or having hippi-like illusions. The story behind each show is very intriguing and unique. The best way I can describe it is like a Pink Floyd music video (strange to be more simple).What makes this DVD even better is there is a very interesting plot twist at the end that makes me begging for more. I can't wait to see the next volume in this DVD set.This show should satisfy pretty much everyone unless you are a stickler about mature content.",5,Just CRAZY!,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,1118,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'appeared', 'be', 'sort', 'horror', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'bought', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'when', 'put', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'show', 'beginning', 'theme', 'song', 'Are', 'people', 'laughing', 'happy', 'catchy', 'toon', 'hear', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'nuclear', 'explosions', 'background.Paranoia', 'Agent', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'horror', 'show', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'get', 'scared', 'animation', 'plenty', 'weird', 'creepiness', 'episode', 'DVD', 'centers', 'different', 'character', 'insane', 'such', 'having', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'having', 'hippi-like', 'illusions', 'story', 'show', 'very', 'intriguing', 'unique', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'music', 'video', 'strange', 'be', 'more', 'simple', 'DVD', 'even', 'better', 'very', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'begging', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'volume', 'DVD', 'set.This', 'show', 'should', 'satisfy', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'are', 'stickler', 'mature', 'content']",N/A
835749,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B0002IQHCU,C. Chow,"[1, 1]","`Paranoia Agent' defies most of conventional anime. No giant robots, big guns, or girls with blue hair. It takes place in present day Tokyo and revolves around the lives of everyday workers. It is also unique for being an anthology.`Paranoia Agent' is not based around the conflict of heroes and villains. It depends mostly on style. The opening credits are arguably the most memorable in anime history. We see our many characters standing in the midst of a disaster, flood, fire, earthquake, nuclear bombing. However they are all laughing uncontrollably in an insane manner, as to make us think that these characters may have come to except the horror of their lives.The plot: Unlike most anime series `Paranoia Agent' is an anthology, each episode seems to exist on its own, in that we are introduced to new characters whose stories begin and end with that episode, an anthology. The stories are all related in the sense that each of our characters lives in modern day Tokyo and is having trouble in life, generally work related. They all end up being attacked by boy in roller blades, Little Slugger.The stories are very entertaining in a dark comedy way, from a sleazy reporter who owes money to the mob, a school girl by day and prostitute by night, an anime production team that's behind schedule, friends that keep failing in their many attempts to commit suicide. Little Slugger attacks them all.As the show progresses, so does Little Slugger. It becomes quite obvious that he is super natural. It also becomes quite obvious that `Paranoia Agent' has absolutely no intention of wrapping things up or ever explaining the truth about Little Slugger or any of the bizarre events. And it doesn't.I couldn't see this series going on any longer and it's nice they ended it after 13 episodes allowing us to remember it fondly.`Paranoia Agent' works mostly because of its style. The animation and directing are great.

He created Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress, two thrilling and beautiful movies. But at the same time, I wanted a more complete story, and with this series, he finally had all the time he needed to show all his portrayals of Japanese society.And this may be his most disturbing, but most amazing story yet. The series focuses on the victims of the Shonen Bat, who are disturbed in their own ways. The entire series critiques all the troubling qualities of anime--the show-off heros, the adorable mascots to hide behind, the dangerous culture of hentai and the nauseum of repetitive video games.Even though the police are looking for the killer, the real killer is everywhere within Japanese commercialist culture. Much like the U.S. film ""The Truman Show"", this piece criticizes all things that are pop. It's about time that someone made a show like this.

835751,ADTUS88NFTW23,B0002IQHCU,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[3, 3]","This is the best anime I've seen since Evangellion.  Like Eva, it is difficult to talk about this anime without giving away spoilers.  Sorry if my review is a little cryptic, but I don't want to spoil the show for anyone.For anime fans out there, if you like Eva and Serial Experiments: Lain, then you should like Paranoia Agent.  It reminds me a lot of Lain, except with a better thought out plot and conclusion.  It reminds me of Eva because there is so much symbolism that this is a show that you'll be able to watch many times and still not catch everything.On the surface, the show is about an inline skater who hits helpless people on the head with his crooked golden baseball bat.  Soon Tokyo, and then Japan, become fearful and fascinated with the assailer.  Beneath the surface, the show is about paranoia.  It's about the pressure of modern life, and the mythologies we build for ourselves.  It's about distinguishing between victimizing and being victimized.  It's about the excuses we make for our actions.  It's about being trapped when our fantasy and reality come into conflict with each other.  That's about as much as I can say without spoiling the show for you.Paranoia Agent is not a show for everyone.  The themes and storylines are very adult.  This is a heavy show.  It can almost be excruciating at time, with the stress and paranoia it tries to instill in the viewer.  Some episodes deal with issues like prostitution and suicide (in other words, this isn't a show for kids).  At the same time, P.A. has its lighthearted and dark comedic moments.  Still, Maromi, the big headed pink dog, is just plane creepy.If you enjoy intelligent and challenging entertainment, then please watch this show.  I only listened to the Japanese language track with subtitles, so I can't tell you if the English dub is any good.

And really the biggest problem I had with it is that they didn't put enough episodes on the disc.  Which brings me to another issue...WHY THE HECK NOT?

835753,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002IQHCU,Robert Moore,"[34, 37]","By any standards, this is one of the most remarkable animated shows that has ever been produced.  PARANOIA AGENT deals with a number of characters who are linked both in an odd chain of acquaintances and by being the victims of an attack by a juvenile on roller blades who unexpectedly strikes people with a bent metal baseball bat, called by the press Shouen Bat.  The first disc introduces the viewer to five victims of Shouen Bat in four episodes entitled ""Enter Li'l' Slugger,"" ""The Golden Shoes,"" ""Double Lips"" and ""A Man's Path.""  The opening credits of each episode, with an especially frenetic theme song (with the usual odd lyrics typical of anime) and dynamic animation, announces what a unique show this is.The first episode deals with the first victim of Shouen Bat, a famous designer who has designed a pink dog that has brought her great fame and success.  The trouble is that she is at a loss to repeat her success, and her boss is putting pressure on her to come up with a design that will be equally successful.  Her story of a boy on roller blades who attacked her is greeted with some skepticism, until a seedy journalist who is harassing her for an interview is also attacked.The second episode deals with a young boy who is an acquaintance with the designer.  He fancies himself the coolest kid in school and the most popular, but one day he discovers that his popularity has plummeted because his roller blades and his skill in baseball have made many imagine that he is Shouen Bat.  To make things worse, the overweight, brainy transfer student who is running against him for president of the student council (and who he imagines is behind the rumors) looks like he might win the election.  Everyone except the young woman who works at the university and who serves as his tutor suspects him of being Shouen Bat.  That is, they do until first his school nemesis and then he himself are both attacked.The third episode is the best of the first four, an absolutely brilliant episode whose story would be worthy of Philip K. Dick.  The tutor of the boy who is the fourth victim works during the day at the university, where a researcher has asked her to marry him, an offer she accepts.  But at night her alter ego, Maria, emerges, and plies her trade as a prostitute.  In Philip K. Dick's A SCANNER DARKLY, a police officer investigates a drug dealer who distributes an extraordinarily powerful drug whose primary side effect is to induce a profoundly split personality.  Only gradually do we learn that the detective and the drug dealer are the same person.  (A SCANNER DARKLY is currently being made into an animated film by Richard Linklater, who previously made the fascinating animated film WAKING LIFE, along with many live action films.)  In the same way, the tutor and Maria are utterly disconnected from one another, though each is aware of the other's existence.  In a succession of fascinating moments, the two leave messages for each other, throw away each other's clothes, and manage to undermine the other in various ways.  She becomes the fifth victim of Shouen Bat.The fourth episode follows the life of one of Maria's regular tricks, a crooked cop with a penchant for prostitutes, gambling, and drinking.  A gangster in turns begins shaking him down, demanding more and more exorbitant amounts of cash from him, until the evening when he is attacked by Shouen Bat, but nonetheless manages to subdue and arrest him.The creative force behind the show is Satoshi Kon, who was previously best known for PERFECT BLUE and MILLENIUM PRINCESS, but who in the future will probably be better known for PARANOIA AGENT.  Those previous films were rightly considered significant innovations in anime, though I felt that both had some difficulties with narrative.  The story here is much tighter and more coherently told than in either of those films, and represents a significant maturation of Kon as an artist.  It is almost impossible to over praise the animation in this film.  His characters possess little of the woodenness and derivativeness that afflicts so many anime characters, and he pays attention to foregrounds and backgrounds to an extreme fashion.  For instance, you might have a shot over a cop's shoulder of a bar top, with an ashtray that is a perfect representation of just about any ashtray every seen.  What is amazing, however, is that Kon does not allow the camera to linger over it.  It is a perfect detail, marvelously drawn, but it exists to give the imagery depth.  There are a host of marvelous touches in nearly every scene, many of them of shade and lighting, but many consisting merely in marvelously drawn images.  He also achieves some superb framing of his shots.  The tutor, for instance, might react with horror to see that the alter ego she has suppressed has reemerged.  As she recoiled, the camera will jump from one angle to one shot from inside a recess looking out at her, with various make up and grooming items forming the foreground.  In one superb shot, the crooked cop stands outside his station house, the camera moving at a turtle's pace behind his right shoulder.  All in all, this is some of the best animation that one is ever likely to see.",5,Utterly strange and absolutely brilliant,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,5219,"['standards', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable',

835754,A3LDRRC6MYEGJP,B0002IQHCU,Robert Parker,"[11, 13]","If I had to describe this series in one sentence, it would be: think Twin Peaks as directed by Orson Welles. If I was asked to add a second sentence, it would be: I ordered the entire series before I had finished watching the first DVD.Satoshi Kon's previous works Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress blur the distinctions between the real, the super-real, and the imaginary, often calling into question the meaning of the concept of what is truly ""here"" and truly ""now."" Paranoia Agent has a clearer narrative than his earlier cinematic works, but the question of what, if anything, is ""real,"" remains unclear until the end of the series.As cinema--and this series is of such caliber that it should be judged as, and discussed as, cinematic art--it is impeccable at every level. The ""acting,"" if one can describe what the painted people do as ""acting,"" is superb, and the life, hopes, fears, and private hells of each character are brought forth with an exquisite (and often heart-rending) truth. The layer upon layer of mise-en-scene'd nuance is mind-bogglingly complex upon analysis, but it is utterly invisible in the service of telling the story. It is expertly paced, with ""comic relief"" episodes appearing from time to time (which nonetheless still serve in the furtherance of the larger story arc), and the conclusion--nearly always the weakest moment in any anime series--may not be ""satisfying"" to all its viewers, but it is superbly crafted and expertly executed.There are clear homages to Twin Peaks--an old man is alternately the Log Lady, the giant, and the dancing dwarf, and there are Badalamente-esque moments in the sound track--but it is far better thought through than Twin Peaks, and in many ways, more powerful.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. The opening credits alone tell you that you're in for a very unusual ride. I would add the caution that this is for emotionally mature viewers only: not so much because of the alchohol and tobacco use (referenced in the Amazon review) and the occasional ""adult situation,"" but because some of the central plot twists can be horrifyingly heartbreaking.I predict that Paranoia Agent will be regarded as a genre-establishing masterwork. Just as ""cyberpunk"" is attached to works like Ghost in the Shell...I wonder what term will be attached to this new genre, which is at the same time fantastic yet immediate; surreal, yet utterly and poignantly human; unnerving, yet able to truly touch the heart?",5,A genre-establishing masterwork,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2473,"['had', 'describe', 'series', 'one', 'sentence', 'would', 'be', 'think', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'directed', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'asked', 'add', 'second', 'sentence', 'would', 'be', 'ordered', 'entire', 'series', 'had', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'DVD.Satoshi', 'Kon', 'previous', 'works', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'Millenium', 'Actress', 'blur', 'distinctions', 'real', 'super-real', 'imaginary', 'often', 'calling', 'question', 'meaning', 'concept', 'what', 'truly', 'here', 'truly', 'now', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'clearer', 'narrative', 'earlier', 'cinematic', 'works', 'question', 'what', 'anything', 'real', 'unclear', 'end', 'series.As', 'cinema', 'series', 'such', 'caliber', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'discussed', 'cinematic', 'art', 'impeccable', 'level', 'acting', 'one', 'can', 'describe', 'what', 'painted', 'people', 'do', 'acting', 'superb', 'life', 'fears', 'private', 'hells', 'character', 'are', 'brought', 'forth', 'exquisite', 'often', 'heart-rending', 'truth', 'layer', 'layer', 'mise-en-scene', ""'d"", 'nuance', 'mind-bogglingly', 'complex', 'analysis', 'utterly', 'invisible', 'service', 'telling', 'story', 'expertly', 'paced', 'comic', 'relief', 'episodes', 'appearing', 'time', 'time', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'serve', 'furtherance', 'larger', 'story', 'arc', 'conclusion', 'nearly', 'always', 'weakest', 'moment', 'anime', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'satisfying', 'viewers', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'expertly', 'are', 'clear', 'homages', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'old', 'man', 'alternately', 'Log', 'Lady', 'giant', 'dancing', 'dwarf', 'are', 'Badalamente-esque', 'moments', 'sound', 'track', 'far', 'better', 'thought', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'powerful.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'highly', 'enough', 'opening', 'alone', 'tell', ""'re"", 'very', 'unusual', 'ride', 'would', 'add', 'caution', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'viewers', 'only', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'alchohol', 'tobacco', 'use', 'referenced', 'Amazon', 'review', 'occasional', 'adult', 'situation', 'central', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'be', 'horrifyingly', 'heartbreaking.I', 'predict', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'genre-establishing', 'masterwork', 'Just', 'cyberpunk', 'attached', 'works', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'wonder', 'what', 'term', 'will', 'be', 'attached', 'new', 'genre', 'same', 'time', 'fantastic', 'yet', 'immediate', 'surreal', 'utterly', 'poignantly', 'human', 'unnerving', 'yet', 'able', 'truly', 'heart']",N/A
835755,A369MYLELKEGUO,B0002IQHCU,"The Mark Inside ""Excessive film fan.""","[4, 5]","In an unnamed Japanese city, an elementary school student known only as Shonen Bat is attacking seemingly random citizens with a baseball bat. But the attacks aren't what they seem. Is Shonen Bat a messiah or a psycho? Are the victims really dependable or are they injuring themselves? And what is up with this talking plush toy? This gritty, surreal headtrip doesn't truly reveal what's going on. Just when you think you've figured out the twists, Kon throws in another mystery. A smart, -almost Lynchian- move which is a really refreshing break from formulaic modern slasher flicks and the boring twist-driven M. Night Shamalyn films. It's moderately-paced horror that merges the creepy `jigsaw puzzles' of David Lynch and the masterful suspense of Alfred Hitchock to create a show that depends on atmosphere and scripting instead of gore or predictable plot twists. It's even better than Kon's first film ""Perfect Blue"" and is the headiest television show since ""Twin Peaks."" If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, or just a curious viewer, give ""Paranoia Agent"" a spin.",5,Satoshi Kon can do no wrong.,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,1078,"['unnamed', 'Japanese', 'city', 'elementary', 'school', 'student', 'known', 'only', 'Shonen', 'Bat', 'attacking', 'seemingly', 'random', 'citizens', 'baseball', 'bat', 'attacks', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'Shonen', 'Bat', 'messiah', 'psycho', 'Are', 'victims', 'really', 'dependable', 'are', 'injuring', 'what', 'up', 'talking', 'plush', 'toy', 'gritty', 'surreal', 'headtrip', ""n't"", 'truly', 'reveal', 'what', 'going', 'Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'twists', 'Kon', 'mystery', 'smart', '-almost', 'Lynchian-', 'move', 'really', 'refreshing', 'break', 'formulaic', 'modern', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'boring', 'twist-driven', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamalyn', 'films', 'moderately-paced', 'horror', 'creepy', 'jigsaw', 'puzzles', 'David', 'Lynch', 'masterful', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchock', 'create', 'show', 'atmosphere', 'scripting', 'instead', 'gore', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twists', 'even', 'better', 'Kon', 'first', 'film', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'headiest', 'television', 'show', 'Twin', 'Peaks', ""'re"", 'fan', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'just', 'curious', 'viewer', 'give', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'spin']",N/A
