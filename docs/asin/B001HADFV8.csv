My husband and I laughed so hard at the Christmas special that we had to put it on pause until we got finished laughing enough to continue. The story lines are written so that they interweave and come full circle - where DO the writers come up with some of these ideas!  Fine acting by both main characters and I agree with another reviewer that this is NOT just for old people!  Most episodes have social commentary hidden underneath that makes you think and the difference is the Mr. Muldrew doesn't take it lying down but lets others know how he feels about things.  Really enjoyable series.",5,We love this series!,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,697,"['Oh', 'scrapes', 'situations', 'Victor', 'Muldrew', 'Too', 'funny', 'words', 'sometimes', 'husband', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'Christmas', 'special', 'had', 'put', 'pause', 'got', 'finished', 'laughing', 'enough', 'continue', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'written', 'so', 'interweave', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'where', 'DO', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'ideas', 'Fine', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'NOT', 'just', 'old', 'people', 'Most', 'episodes', 'have', 'social', 'commentary', 'hidden', 'underneath', 'think', 'difference', 'Mr.', 'Muldrew', ""n't"", 'take', 'lying', 'down', 'others', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'Really', 'enjoyable', 'series']",N/A

I learned of One Foot in the Grave atop Whistler's Mountain near Jasper, Alberta. My wife and I were vacationing when we met a couple from the UK. We discussed many things and the conversation soon came round to British sitcoms. I, having been a long time fan of British comedy, mention several that I knew of, which of course were ancient history for the couple from the UK. They suggested ""One Foot in the Grave"" and I ordered the first season. There has been no turning back since. We continue to enjoy the series, as much as we enjoy Seinfeld, as a comparison. I highly recommend this series.

It's hard to find a show featuring an older couple like the Meldrews, as so much of television centers around the young; and I admit that is one reason I find it so appealing. But even the younger crowd will love the dry, dark humor in this series. There are so many unexpected twists and turns in each episode, so many threads leading up to the always hilarious, usually surprising conclusion.
