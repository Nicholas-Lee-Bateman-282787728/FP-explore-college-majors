With comedy that's what happens anyway: some jokes connect; others don't. Most are pretty good in here but beware: some of the jokes are in poor taste, but that's a dark comedy for you. Also, some Catholics might be offended because the film takes some shots at them, or at least people who go overboard in rationalizing their sins, as Kevin Kline does in here.There is an odd assortment of actors in here and they all contribute to the fun: Kline, Tracey Ullman, William Hurt, River Phoenix, Keannu Reeves, Joan Plowright and James Gammon.Supposedly, this film was based on a real-life happening, which makes it all the more interesting and lending credence to the saying that ""truth is stranger than fiction.""Plowright almost steals the show from Kline and Ullman, the husband-and-wife team who have problems because of Kline's persistent cheating on her. Plowright in Ullman's mother and has some of the best lines in the film as mother and daughter plot how to kill the immoral Kline.Phoenis plays a young New Age devotee and Hurt and Reeves are funny as two totally stoned-out hit men. Hurt is particularly good.This movie is so-so to start until Ullman finds her husband cheating. Then, after a heart-wrenching minute or so, she and her mother plot to kill the unfaithful spouse. The comedy then goes full out as they hire these really goofy hit men and things don't go smoothly.

The reason: according to charges filed by the district attorney, Frances had conspired to murder her husband -- not once but twice.The bizarre case began on Jan. 25. That night, prosecutors contend, Anthony Bruno, the 20-year-old boyfriend of Toto's 17-year-old daughter Elizabeth, crept into Toto's bedroom, located the .25-cal. gun that Toto kept near his bed and fired a bullet into his head. Toto was grievously but not fatally wounded.Then his wife Frances allegedly began force-feeding him large doses of barbiturates, which succeeded only in putting him into a semiconscious state. Two days later, according to police, two friends of Anthony Bruno's, hired by Frances for $500, showed up in the bedroom to finish the job. They were Ronald Barlip, 19, and his cousin Donald, 18. The bullet one of them allegedly fired entered an inch from Toto's heart, but it too proved not to be lethal.Police, tipped off by an informant, entered the Toto house two days later and found Toto asleep, breathing heavily: doctors later speculated that the barbiturates he had been given may have saved his life by drastically lowering his metabolism and retarding the bleeding.Police arrested Frances, Bruno, the Barlips and the two Toto children, Elizabeth and Anthony. Toto was released from the hospital two weeks later, with the first bullet still lodged in his skull. He says he intends to stand by his family during the coming court proceedings. Said an Allentown police detective: ""He loves her."" The district attorney's office is said to be worried about the case: Tony Toto promises to be a hostile witness."" Tony's wife was found guilty and sentenced to time in Muncy, Pa. women's correctional facility. Tony moved the family there to be near her. Art and Linda Beers wrote the non-fiction book that was bought for the movie. After coming out to L.A. to do the screenplay, they were ripped off for all their efforts by not getting any credit for their work. The credit for it went to John Kostmayer who didn't do the real digging for the story, he just adjusted the work of the Beers'.",4,The Real Skinny,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,2398,"['movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'antics', 'occurred', 'here', 'Allentown', 'Pa.', 'friend', 'mine', 'family', 'story', 'When', 'Anthony', 'Toto', '37', 'pizza-shop', 'owner', 'Allentown', 'Pa.', 'put', 'up', '50,000', 'bail', 'wife', 'Frances', 'Lenore', 'local', 'police', 'others', 'community', 'were', 'stunned', 'reason', 'according', 'charges', 'filed', 'district', 'attorney', 'Frances', 'had', 'conspired', 'murder', 'husband', 'not', 'once', 'twice.The', 'bizarre', 'case', 'began', 'Jan.', '25', 'night', 'prosecutors', 'contend', 'Anthony', 'Bruno', '20-year-old', 'boyfriend', 'Toto', '17-year-old', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'crept', 'Toto', 'bedroom', 'located', '.25-cal', 'gun', 'Toto', 'kept', 'bed', 'fired', 'bullet', 'head', 'Toto', 'was', 'grievously', 'not', 'fatally', 'wounded.Then', 'wife', 'Frances', 'allegedly', 'began', 'force-feeding', 'large', 'doses', 'barbiturates', 'succeeded', 'only', 'putting', 'semiconscious', 'state', 'Two', 'days', 'later', 'according', 'police', 'two', 'friends', 'Anthony', 'Bruno', 'hired', 'Frances', '500', 'showed', 'up', 'bedroom', 'finish', 'job', 'were', 'Ronald', 'Barlip', '19', 'cousin', 'Donald', '18', 'bullet', 'one', 'allegedly', 'fired', 'entered', 'inch', 'Toto', 'heart', 'too', 'proved', 'not', 'be', 'lethal.Police', 'tipped', 'off', 'informant', 'entered', 'Toto', 'house', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'found', 'Toto', 'asleep', 'breathing', 'heavily', 'doctors', 'later', 'speculated', 'barbiturates', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'may', 'have', 'saved', 'life', 'drastically', 'lowering', 'metabolism', 'retarding', 'bleeding.Police', 'arrested', 'Frances', 'Bruno', 'Barlips', 'two', 'Toto', 'children', 'Elizabeth', 'Anthony', 'Toto', 'was', 'released', 'hospital', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'first', 'bullet', 'still', 'lodged', 'skull', 'stand', 'family', 'coming', 'court', 'proceedings', 'Said', 'Allentown', 'police', 'detective', 'district', 'attorney', 'office', 'said', 'be', 'worried', 'case', 'Tony', 'Toto', 'be', 'hostile', 'witness', 'Tony', 'wife', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'sentenced', 'time', 'Muncy', 'Pa.', 'women', 'correctional', 'facility', 'Tony', 'moved', 'family', 'be', 'Art', 'Linda', 'Beers', 'wrote', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'was', 'bought', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'L.A.', 'do', 'screenplay', 'were', 'ripped', 'off', 'efforts', 'not', 'getting', 'credit', 'work', 'credit', 'went', 'John', 'Kostmayer', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'real', 'digging', 'story', 'just', 'adjusted', 'work', 'Beers']",N/A

This is, like, the dream cast.""  I knew, of course, that it featured Tracey Ullman and Kevin Kline as the leads.  But Joan Plowright!  River Phoenix (what a tragic loss)!  William Hurt!  They even squeezed character actress Miryam Margolies. And, of course, you've got Keanu Reeves in yet another stoner role, but you know, you gotta give Keanu credit.  No one did those roles better. He is spot on here.A black comedy based on actual events?  Hmm, how often do you come across something of that ilk?  It is, as many reviewers have noted, something less than a complete success, and there were actually moments when I was ready to give up on it.  Some of the shifts were just too abrupt.  But if it falters here and there, the movie seems to somehow pick itself right back up again.  The arrival of drugged out Harlan and Marlon (Hurt and Reeves) comes at one such lull and their presence gives the film a shot in the arm (no pun intended).Not all of the gags work, of course, but the stellar cast is always worth watching.  If you've ever wondered whether Tracey Ullman was more of a sketch comedian than an actress, her performance here should lay any such doubts to rest.  As her mom, Joan Plowright is an absolute hoot.  I can't tell for sure whether this legendary British actress's ""Yugoslavian"" accent is as flawless as countrywoman Ullman's ""all-American"" one, but she is so priceless, I can't imagine even the proudest Croatian critic arguing the point.What of the ""actual events"" on which this is based?  Apparently, the movie gets the gist of it, maybe more.  Apparently, the Pennsylvania couple on which these seemingly impossible characters are based really did go through all of this and were still together last anyone knew.  And the hubby really did change his wayward ways after his wife's multiple attempts to murder him.  One discrepancy that I did read about, however, was that she really did wind up serving some time.  But call that cinematic license.There is at least an interesting subtext about Old World values and codes, and how they can justify all kinds of ""outrageous"" behavior (by contemporary US standards), while still seeming to be fundamentally ""conservative"" in nature.

We are across the spectrum in tastes--from opera lover to Three Stooges lover. We walked out quietly, each waiting to hear the response of another, no one willing to attack. And it gradually dawned on us that we all agreed this was the most excruciating cinematic experience we had ever had. Worse than ""Last House on the Left"" my previous all-time loser. Worse than anything. We were astonished that one film could leap to the top of 5 different people's ""All Time Worst"" list just like that. Powee--thatsa bad movie.All these years later, it retains that top spot. The most boring, stupid, unbelievable, lame and irritating movie, without a shred of humor (this was a ****** comedy???) cleverness, or bite. One of those films where you try to imagine the producer and director seeing the final cut and saying, ""Yep. Nailed that baby!""

The acting is very good and never overdone. Even the murderous mother-in-law is portrayed in an understated way that makes her believable.

Hard to believe it's based on a TRUE story because it's just so remarkably odd in the funniest ways - full of surprises!! Every actor in this ensemble delivers a unique character portrayal outside their normal roles, which is very refreshing, colorfully played and original!! Too many laughs to articulate...but definitely one I wanted to add to my comedy collection and worth watching several times over. Kevin Kline is amazing - but they ALL stepped up to make this a truly spectacular and memorable movie!!!
