Why the Indians can't have any?""The shooting scenes are fast, and deadly but there are few. This more a drama than an action Western.The acting is gripping. Gene Hackman is convincing as Gen.

Frankly, I don't care in this case because this movie is simply a very entertaining film that is enjoyable to watch....and that's what movies are supposed to be: entertaining.What makes it so entertaining?1) a very interesting saga of the famous Apache Geronimo, fighting for his people and also living a life dedicated to revenge; 2) A great portrayal of him by actor Wes Studi, who has the perfect face and voice for the role; 3) a very solid all-male cast, with memorable leads played by Jason Patric, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman and Matt Damon; 4) wonderful golden-hued cinematography, filmed in the mountainous area of Moab, Utah; 5) Not excessive violence nor a lot of profanity, rare for a Walter Hill directed movie. This is one of the stylish Hill's classier efforts. 6) Good sound if you have the DVD and a surround sound system.Yes, this leans in the PC class with big-time leanings toward the Indian cause, but the Apache people apparently had a good case for their cause, at least with Geronimo's convincing question near the end of the movie: ""There is plenty of land.

Who else could have dared to glue the word legend with the figure of Geronimo, the Indian terrorist in essence ?Now, the historical accuracy of the events described in Walter Hill's GERONIMO - AN AMERICAN LEGEND is not so important, Hill and Milius's purpose was not to present a documentary film about one of the last Indian rebellions than to make us think about the motives that actuated 50 Chiricahuas warriors to defy 5'000 U.S. cavalry soldiers. Everybody is entitled to have his own opinion about the events pictured in the Walter Hill movie but we should nonetheless take the time to think about certain issues raised by Geronimo (the movie character, of course) : Why does the White Man need so much space ? If the White Men hadn't been so many, would they have still had the right to claim the Indian territories ?

Eye-opening, panoramic landscapes and horizons.  Struggle and conflict, augmented by grit and dust.  When the visual components are in place, a Western succeeds; director Walter Hill furnishes a prime example with his haunting film GERONIMO:  AN AMERICAN LEGEND.  Wow, can this director make a movie--assisted by very capable cinematographer Lloyd Ahern.  Based on true historical accounts depicting Apache legend Geronimo during his last stages of defiance, this is a stunning, memorable film only slightly flawed.In addition to visuals, Hill brings plenty of star power to the story.  Gene Hackman (Brig. General George Crook) and Robert Duvall (Chief of Scouts Al Sieber) are very, very good (especially Duvall, who thrives in a Western setting).  Jason Patric (1st Lt. Charles B. Gatewood) and a wet-behind-the-ears Matt Damon (2nd Lt. Britton Davis) are more than solid--especially as we watch Patric's character grow more and more disillusioned with his superiors and his government.  Yet Wes Studi is nothing short of spectacular as the renegade chief Geronimo; which is where the film falters just a bit.  The story should have focused more on Geronimo's perspective--less on the brooding of the two young lieutenants constantly chasing him.

Amazon listed this as wide screen, but what I recieved was PAN & SCAN.  The Movie was great.  It would have been MUCH better in widescreen format....better yet..give me blu ray with digital sound effects!Those who gave this movie low marks are neither as bright nor knowledgeable as they would have you believe.  True - the movie was not historically accurate because it is a MOVIE.  The public does not go to the theater to watch documentaries.Who really knows the whole truth?  If you desire more information about Geronimo, (Goy-Ak-la was his real name), I strongly suggest that you read the books; Geronimo, In His Own Words and The Truth About Geronimo, written by Bitton Davis.  Davis was an Indian scout leader and knew most of the people highlighted in the MOVIE.  He was not fond of Geronimo, but wrote a very interesting account of his attempts to capture the so-called renegade.  The victors in any clash of cultures, all to often, write the history.  My studies of Native Americans have convinced me that the original inhabitants of this country usually provide the most reliable accounts of these clashes.About the movie:  I agree with those who felt that the action scenes were well done and the scenery was breathtaking.

13601,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0767817672,Erik North,"[3, 4]","Of all the stories to come out of the West, none stirs the soul quite like the saga of the great Apache warrior known as Geronimo.  It is a saga that has been told before, most notably in 1962's GERONIMO with (an admittedly miscast) Chuck Connors in the title role.  But perhaps the best telling of the story comes through via director Walter Hill's 1993 film GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND.In decades past, particularly if his opponent had been portrayed by someone like John Wayne, Geronimo would be seen onscreen as the villain.  But real life rarely ever squared with the Duke's view of the Native American; and it is that fact that Hill and screenwriters John Milius and Larry Gross go after.  Jason Patric (as Lt. Charles Gatewood) and Matt Damon (as 2nd Lt. Britton Davis) are the U.S. Cavalry men assigned to bring Geronimo in for surrender upon orders of General George Crook (Gene Hackman), and with help from an expert scout (Robert Duvall).  But when the cavalry break up a medicine man ritual on the Apache reservation at Turkey Creek, Geronimo (superbly played by Wes Studi) goes on the warpath.  The film concerns itself with the dichotomy that the U.S. Army faced when dealing with the Apache in Arizona during the 1880s.  On the one hand, they were the only true protection the Apache had against incoming white settlers who wanted to remove all traces of Native American life from the West; on the other hand, the Army was also being used as a tool by those same settlers.Though nowhere near as bloody or violent as it could have been, given the reputations of Hill and Milius, GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND doesn't shirk away from the hostilities committed by both the Army and the Apache against the other.  And whereas John Wayne's films upheld American Manifest Destiny over all else, especially the Indian, this film questions it in a low-key way through Patric's and Damon's dealings with their superiors, and in particular with Duvall, who questions Patric's admiration for Geronimo and loyalty to the Union: ""You don't love who you're fightin' for...and you don't hate who you're fighting against.""  Even Duvall's scout, however, comes to see that the U.S. Army's battle against Geronimo and his people isn't so black-and-white.Hackman and Duvall, of course, are at their usual best in their respective roles, as are Patric and Damon in theirs.  But the true stand-out role belongs to Studi, whose portrayal of the great Apache warrior is one of courage, strength, and well-earned sympathy.  Featuring superb cinematography by Lloyd Ahern, mainly on Utah and Arizona locations, and a fine period score from roots-rock musician Ry Cooder (who also did the score for Hill's Peckinpah-influenced 1980 epic THE LONG RIDERS), GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND showed that the stories about the West, and about how we dealt with the Indian (rather poorly and unsympathetically, as history has shown us), still had a lot to tell us about our past and what might be for our future.  Great filmmaking tends to do that, and GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND is a superb example of that in our time.",5,Geronimo Revisited,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,3101,"['stories', 'come', 'West', 'none', 'stirs', 'soul', 'quite', 'saga', 'great', 'Apache', 'warrior', 'known', 'Geronimo', 'saga', 'been', 'told', 'most', 'notably', '1962', 'GERONIMO', 'admittedly', 'miscast', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'title', 'role', 'perhaps', 'best', 'telling', 'story', 'director', 'Walter', 'Hill', '1993', 'film', 'GERONIMO', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'LEGEND.In', 'decades', 'past', 'particularly', 'opponent', 'had', 'been', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Geronimo', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'villain', 'real', 'life', 'rarely', 'ever', 'squared', 'Duke', 'view', 'Native', 'American', 'fact', 'Hill', 'screenwriters', 'John', 'Milius', 'Larry', 'Gross', 'go', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Lt.', 'Charles', 'Gatewood', 'Matt', 'Damon', '2nd', 'Lt.', 'Britton', 'Davis', 'are', 'U.S.', 'Cavalry', 'men', 'assigned', 'bring', 'Geronimo', 'surrender', 'orders', 'General', 'George', 'Crook', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'help', 'expert', 'scout', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'when', 'cavalry', 'break', 'up', 'medicine', 'man', 'ritual', 'Apache', 'reservation', 'Turkey', 'Creek', 'Geronimo', 'superbly', 'played', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'warpath', 'film', 'concerns', 'dichotomy', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'faced', 'when', 'dealing', 'Apache', 'Arizona', '1880s', 'one', 'hand', 'were', 'only', 'true', 'protection', 'Apache', 'had', 'incoming', 'white', 'settlers', 'who', 'wanted', 'remove', 'traces', 'Native', 'American', 'life', 'West', 'other', 'hand', 'Army', 'was', 'also', 'being', 'used', 'tool', 'same', 'settlers.Though', 'nowhere', 'near', 'bloody', 'violent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'reputations', 'Hill', 'Milius', 'GERONIMO', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'LEGEND', ""n't"", 'shirk', 'away', 'hostilities', 'committed', 'Army', 'Apache', 'other', 'whereas', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'upheld', 'American', 'Manifest', 'Destiny', 'else', 'especially', 'Indian', 'film', 'questions', 'low-key', 'way', 'Patric', 'Damon', 'dealings', 'superiors', 'particular', 'Duvall', 'who', 'questions', 'Patric', 'admiration', 'Geronimo', 'loyalty', 'Union', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'who', ""'re"", 'fightin', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'who', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'Even', 'Duvall', 'scout', 'however', 'see', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'battle', 'Geronimo', 'people', ""n't"", 'so', 'black-and-white.Hackman', 'Duvall', 'course', 'are', 'usual', 'best', 'respective', 'roles', 'are', 'Patric', 'Damon', 'theirs', 'true', 'stand-out', 'role', 'belongs', 'Studi', 'portrayal', 'great', 'Apache', 'warrior', 'one', 'courage', 'strength', 'well-earned', 'sympathy', 'Featuring', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Lloyd', 'Ahern', 'mainly', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'locations', 'fine', 'period', 'score', 'roots-rock', 'musician', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'score', 'Hill', 'Peckinpah-influenced', '1980', 'THE', 'LONG', 'RIDERS', 'GERONIMO', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'LEGEND', 'showed', 'stories', 'West', 'how', 'dealt', 'Indian', 'rather', 'poorly', 'unsympathetically', 'history', 'shown', 'still', 'had', 'lot', 'tell', 'past', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'future', 'Great', 'filmmaking', 'tends', 'do', 'GERONIMO', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'LEGEND', 'superb', 'example', 'time']",N/A

Gatewood was apparently an individual of some integrity and appeared to be able to carry out his orders with dignity and compassion.  For readers interested in discovering more about this officer, I would suggest that they read the excellent material on him written by the historian Louis Kraft.  Gatewood was rewarded for his exemplary service to our nation by becoming the victim of the pettiness and selfish self-centeredness of Nelson Miles, the officer commanding the Apache campaign at the time of Gatewood's service.  I wish there was a way to commend Gatewood, and censure Miles.

13610,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0767817672,Joseph Haschka,"[37, 39]","Sometimes, stunning camera work adds significant value to a film's overall merit. Case in point is 2001: A SPACE ODDYSSEY, in which the visuals (and musical score) contributed to make it one of the great films of all time. (I saw it 8 times when originally on the big screen.) Yet the acting and storyline were so nondescript that who can remember who the actors or their characters were beyond Hal? Although certainly not carrying the same weight as 2001 in the evolution of movie making, the 1993 release GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND is elevated for the same reason, and the acting is much better besides.Matt Damon plays 2nd Lt. Britton Davis, newly commissioned out of West Point, who arrives in Arizona in the mid-1880's just in time to accompany the savvy 1st Lt. Charles Gatewood, played by Jason Patric, on a mission to accept the surrender of Geronimo, and bring the Apache leader to the reservation. Eventually, Geronimo abandons the reservation to again take up arms against the white man, ultimately fleeing into Mexico. The local Army cavalry command led by Gen. George Crook, played by Gene Hackman, and which includes Davis and Gatewood, must then go retrieve the war chief and his followers. Robert Duvall has the role of Al Sieber, the army unit's Chief Scout.As I've indicated, the cinematography in GERONIMO is absolutely gorgeous, the film being shot in the scenic expanses of southeastern Utah. Moreover, the acting doesn't deserve the reproach it's received. The Crook character, criticized as too bland, is played just right. By that time in his long military career, Gen. Crook had seen it all when it came to battling the Indians, and his unflappability, evenhandedness, and strength of character were fully established. There is no need for flamboyant theatrics on his part. The moody reserve of the Gatewood character is perfectly understandable. He came from a patrician Virginia family and, had it been 30 years previous, would have fought for the Confederacy. Fighting for the victorious Federals against another oppressed people (as the Southerners saw themselves) was certain to cause much self-examination. As Sieber put it to Gatewood, ""You don't love who you're fighting for, and you don't hate who you're fighting against."" Duvall, as Sieber, plays a role somewhat reminiscent of his Gus McCrae in LONESOME DOVE, but without the easygoing humor. In any case, his on-screen time is way too short. Wes Studi as Geronimo is more than adequate. I can't think of another Native American actor - and how many of those are there? - who could have done better. Matt Damon, as the likable Britton, serves as the film's narrator for the viewers' perspective. True, the plot incorporates no dramatic, climactic battles. That's because there weren't any in the real-life Geronimo saga, and Hollywood mercifully refrained, for once, from the unashamed embellishment of history.

Starring Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman and Jason Patric, the movie is great in showing the deceptions the US government foisted on the Apaches - but it's primarily about the cavalry soldiers. I would have liked to see more from the Apache's side.The basic story, for those who didn't take US history, is that most Native Americans had been rounded up and stuck on reservations by 1883. Geronimo remained out in the wild with a band of fellow Apaches. They were convinced to come in to a reservation. Geronimo then took off again with a group of followers, and the US Army hunted them down for a year before finally catching them and sending them to prison in Florida.This is a true story, which means that there will always be many inaccuracies as the filmmakers try to make a watchable movie out of it. They did their best to keep the basic plot correct as well as the emotions and issues involved. I don't mind tweaks like that usually. The one change that did bother me was that Geronimo didn't just jump off the reservation because a medicine man told him to. In reality, he'd been warned that he was going to be lynched and hung.I really appreciated the strong use of Apache language throughout the film. It always helps to keep a culture alive when you hear their words and phrases. I had mixed feelings about the scenery. On one hand it certainly was gorgeous! There were many shots that were simply stunning in their beauty. On the other hand, though, the scenery was all of Utah. This story is supposed to take place in Arizona and Mexico. Sure, they might be ""similar"" but nature was incredibly important to Native Americans. I really would have wanted to see the *actual* landscapes that these people were willing to die for.I thought the acting was simply stellar. They didn't try to turn this into a blockbuster of gigantic battles - they tried to keep the people and situations true to the history. In general, there are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Geronimo was a great leader - but at times he let his desire for revenge get the best of him. Lt. Gatewood does his very best to do the ""right thing"" - even when he knows it'll lead a man he respects into a lifelong prison. When Geronimo asks General Crook why there isn't enough land for them all, Crook has no answer.Very worth watching and considering that, in the grand scheme of history, this really wasn't that long ago at all.",5,"No Good Guys, Few Bad Guys",1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,2482,"['Geronimo', 'successfully', 'out', 'cavalry', 'entire', 'year', 'being', 'captured', 'Starring', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'movie', 'great', 'showing', 'deceptions', 'US', 'government', 'foisted', 'Apaches', 'primarily', 'cavalry', 'soldiers', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Apache', 'side.The', 'basic', 'story', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'US', 'history', 'most', 'Native', 'Americans', 'had', 'been', 'rounded', 'up', 'stuck', 'reservations', '1883', 'Geronimo', 'remained', 'out', 'wild', 'band', 'fellow', 'Apaches', 'were', 'convinced', 'come', 'reservation', 'Geronimo', 'then', 'took', 'off', 'again', 'group', 'followers', 'US', 'Army', 'hunted', 'down', 'year', 'finally', 'catching', 'sending', 'prison', 'Florida.This', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'make', 'watchable', 'movie', 'did', 'best', 'keep', 'basic', 'plot', 'correct', 'as', 'well', 'emotions', 'issues', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'tweaks', 'usually', 'one', 'change', 'did', 'bother', 'was', 'Geronimo', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'jump', 'off', 'reservation', 'medicine', 'man', 'told', 'reality', ""'d"", 'been', 'warned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'lynched', 'hung.I', 'really', 'appreciated', 'strong', 'use', 'Apache', 'language', 'film', 'always', 'keep', 'culture', 'alive', 'when', 'hear', 'words', 'phrases', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'scenery', 'one', 'hand', 'certainly', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'many', 'shots', 'were', 'simply', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'other', 'hand', 'though', 'scenery', 'was', 'Utah', 'story', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'Arizona', 'Mexico', 'Sure', 'might', 'be', 'similar', 'nature', 'was', 'incredibly', 'important', 'Native', 'Americans', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', '*actual*', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'die', 'for.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'simply', 'stellar', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'turn', 'blockbuster', 'gigantic', 'battles', 'tried', 'keep', 'people', 'situations', 'true', 'history', 'general', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'Geronimo', 'was', 'great', 'leader', 'times', 'let', 'desire', 'revenge', 'get', 'best', 'Lt.', 'Gatewood', 'very', 'best', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'when', ""'ll"", 'lead', 'man', 'lifelong', 'prison', 'When', 'Geronimo', 'General', 'Crook', 'why', ""n't"", 'enough', 'land', 'Crook', 'answer.Very', 'watching', 'considering', 'grand', 'scheme', 'history', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'ago']",N/A

13620,A36IAABX1MR6Z8,0767817672,"M. Steele ""Calculus Wiz""","[34, 42]","I agree with the analysis by Steven Hellerstedt. There are many inaccuracies in the movie. I am Apache Indian from San Carlos, AZ with relatives among the White Mountain Apache Tribe. I also have distant relatives on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in NM and the Fort Sill Apaches in Oklahoma. In the first place, the movie was made in traditional Navajo land along the Arizona-Utah border. When the elder Apaches saw the movie in Globe, AZ, they laughed because the movie starts out with a Navajo song. To be fair, Navajos and Apaches were one tribe hundreds of years ago. But given the time frame of the mid-to-late 1800s, these historical inaccuracies impeded the authenticity of the scenes.In addition, although I speak fluent Apache, many of the scenes with subtext of Apache dialog were unintelligible. Many of the indigenous actors were not Apache, so they had trouble grasping the accent and pronunciation. A few did manage to succeed, but there was a paucity of clarity. I learned Apache before English in childhood. Catholic Nuns taught me fluent English by the 1st grade, so I never got below a 90 on my research papers in graduate school. The inferior parietal cortex of the brain adapts to multiple languages more efficiently for children. I currently work as a biomedical engineer in Florida with a Masters Degree. Geronimo's POW camp near Pensacola was damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.Back to the movie, there were some good scenes with Crook played by Gene Hackman, who is a highly gifted actor. Robert Duvall always brings to life rugged characters in military films, which is notable in his earlier work such as the well-recognized helicopter scene in ""Apocalypse Now."" Wes Studi does a good job of maintaining dialog in many scenes with Crook's character. Some of their comments were accurate like Crook's preference in using Apache scouts. My relative, Chief Alchesay, won a Congressional Medal of Honor while serving as a scout. One member of this family in Whiteriver, AZ served with the 5th Marine Division at Iwo Jima as an Apache Marine - Semper Fidelis.I did not like the ending. There was a small group of Apaches that did not surrender after Geronimo left. The movie gives the inaccurate impression that the Apaches all surrendered. Supposedly, the entire tribe was sent to Florida on the train. One of my relatives, Massai, escaped from that train near St. Louis. In addition, the ""Nameless Ones"" were members of the Chiricuaha Apaches who fled to the Sierra Madres. These Apaches were not registered on any reservation. They befriended Tom Jeffords, a white postmaster from Tucson, AZ. The ""Nameless Ones"" did not surrender. See the book by ""Nino Cochise."" Jeffords, a true friend, never revealed their location. Their story is similar to the Seminoles of the Everglades who never surrendered. In addition, during the roundup in Skeleton Canyon, there were a few warriors who chose not to come in for the surrender. So a small group of Apaches never surrendered. They were seen among the Yaquis of Mexico. My direct ancestor, the Apache Kid, was at first a scout but became a renegade in 1889 and escaped from a stage coach near Superior, AZ. The Apache Kid escaped with other prisoners. He was never captured and last seen in San Carlos around 1935 by his relatives. He was reportedly seen with Pancho Villa's troops in the early 1900s and among the ""Nameless Ones."" The Apache Kid had a bounty on him for $5000 in the 1890s (a large sum at the time) and had many bounter hunters on his trail, including scouts such as Mickey Free and Al Sieber (a white bigot who referred to Apaches as ""Red N--gers""). The Apache Kid was called ""the one who is always hunted"" by other Apaches. The movie shows none of these events after 1886.  Most western Hollywood movies are never made by executive producers with a legitimate historical background that includes a PhD in history, so they are grossly inaccurate like this film about Geronimo (""Goklayeh"" or ""The One Who Yawns"").  The movies are usually made with white supremacist views that are meant to entertain a white audience.  Hence, all Chiricuahua Apaches are shown as having surrendered when a few never did like the Seminoles of the Florida Everglades.",2,Review by Modern Apache Indian from Arizona,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,4234,"['agree', 'analysis', 'Steven', 'Hellerstedt', 'are', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'movie', 'am', 'Apache', 'Indian', 'San', 'Carlos', 'AZ', 'relatives', 'White', 'Mountain', 'Apache', 'Tribe', 'also', 'have', 'distant', 'relatives', 'Mescalero', 'Apache', 'Reservation', 'NM', 'Fort', 'Sill', 'Apaches', 'Oklahoma', 'first', 'place', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'traditional', 'Navajo', 'land', 'Arizona-Utah', 'border', 'When', 'elder', 'Apaches', 'saw', 'movie', 'Globe', 'AZ', 'laughed', 'movie', 'out', 'Navajo', 'song', 'be', 'fair', 'Navajos', 'Apaches', 'were', 'one', 'tribe', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'given', 'time', 'frame', 'mid-to-late', '1800s', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'impeded', 'authenticity', 'scenes.In', 'addition', 'speak', 'fluent', 'Apache', 'many', 'scenes', 'subtext', 'Apache', 'dialog', 'were', 'unintelligible', 'Many', 'indigenous', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'Apache', 'had', 'trouble', 'grasping', 'accent', 'pronunciation', 'few', 'did', 'manage', 'succeed', 'there', 'was', 'paucity', 'clarity', 'learned', 'Apache', 'English', 'childhood', 'Catholic', 'Nuns', 'taught', 'fluent', 'English', '1st', 'grade', 'never', 'got', '90', 'research', 'papers', 'graduate', 'school', 'inferior', 'parietal', 'cortex', 'brain', 'adapts', 'multiple', 'languages', 'more', 'efficiently', 'children', 'currently', 'work', 'biomedical', 'engineer', 'Florida', 'Masters', 'Degree', 'Geronimo', 'POW', 'camp', 'Pensacola', 'was', 'damaged', 'Hurricane', 'Ivan', '2004.Back', 'movie', 'were', 'good', 'scenes', 'Crook', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'highly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'always', 'life', 'rugged', 'characters', 'military', 'films', 'notable', 'earlier', 'work', 'such', 'well-recognized', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'dialog', 'many', 'scenes', 'Crook', 'character', 'comments', 'were', 'accurate', 'Crook', 'preference', 'using', 'Apache', 'scouts', 'My', 'relative', 'Chief', 'Alchesay', 'won', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'serving', 'scout', 'One', 'member', 'family', 'Whiteriver', 'AZ', 'served', '5th', 'Marine', 'Division', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Apache', 'Marine', 'Semper', 'Fidelis.I', 'did', 'not', 'ending', 'was', 'small', 'group', 'Apaches', 'did', 'not', 'surrender', 'Geronimo', 'left', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'impression', 'Apaches', 'surrendered', 'Supposedly', 'entire', 'tribe', 'was', 'sent', 'Florida', 'train', 'One', 'relatives', 'Massai', 'escaped', 'train', 'St.', 'Louis', 'addition', 'Nameless', 'Ones', 'were', 'members', 'Chiricuaha', 'Apaches', 'who', 'fled', 'Sierra', 'Madres', 'Apaches', 'were', 'not', 'registered', 'reservation', 'befriended', 'Tom', 'Jeffords', 'white', 'postmaster', 'Tucson', 'AZ', 'Nameless', 'Ones', 'did', 'not', 'surrender', 'See', 'book', 'Nino', 'Cochise', 'Jeffords', 'true', 'friend', 'never', 'revealed', 'location', 'story', 'similar', 'Seminoles', 'Everglades', 'who', 'never', 'surrendered', 'addition', 'roundup', 'Skeleton', 'Canyon', 'were', 'few', 'warriors', 'who', 'chose', 'not', 'come', 'surrender', 'small', 'group', 'Apaches', 'never', 'surrendered', 'were', 'seen', 'Yaquis', 'Mexico', 'direct', 'ancestor', 'Apache', 'Kid', 'was', 'first', 'scout', 'became', 'renegade', '1889', 'escaped', 'stage', 'coach', 'Superior', 'AZ', 'Apache', 'Kid', 'escaped', 'other', 'prisoners', 'was', 'never', 'captured', 'last', 'seen', 'San', 'Carlos', '1935', 'relatives', 'was', 'reportedly', 'seen', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'troops', 'early', '1900s', 'Nameless', 'Ones', 'Apache', 'Kid', 'had', 'bounty', '5000', '1890s', 'large', 'sum', 'time', 'had', 'many', 'bounter', 'hunters', 'trail', 'including', 'scouts', 'such', 'Mickey', 'Free', 'Al', 'Sieber', 'white', 'bigot', 'who', 'referred', 'Apaches', 'Red', 'N', 'gers', 'Apache', 'Kid', 'was', 'called', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'hunted', 'other', 'Apaches', 'movie', 'none', 'events', '1886', 'Most', 'western', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'executive', 'producers', 'legitimate', 'historical', 'background', 'PhD', 'history', 'are', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'film', 'Geronimo', 'Goklayeh', 'One', 'Who', 'Yawns', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'made', 'white', 'supremacist', 'views', 'are', 'meant', 'entertain', 'white', 'audience', 'Hence', 'Chiricuahua', 'Apaches', 'are', 'shown', 'having', 'surrendered', 'when', 'few', 'never', 'did', 'Seminoles', 'Florida', 'Everglades']",N/A

13625,A912C7977MO6O,0767817672,Smallchief,"[102, 109]","I share the opinion of several other reviewers that ""Geronimo"" is an outstanding -- but undervalued -- Western. Let me tick off some of the reasons why this is such a good movie.First, the scenery and the cinematography are fabulous. Some of the photography deliberately imitates great scenes from other Westerns in the past. I was overcome with deja vu at the scene in which a file of mounted Apaches is silhouetted on the skyline. This is right out of John Ford's ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" if memory serves me right.Secondly, the performances of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, and Wes Studi, as Geronimo, were outstanding. Matt Damon and Jason Patric were fine as young cavalry officers, and I liked the performance of Steve Reevis as Chato, a friendly, trusting -- and ultimately disillusioned -- Apache scout. Third, the movie was reasonably true to fact and avoided the ""noble savage"" philosophy that made movies such as ""Dances with Wolves"" tiresome. Nor did the movie gloss over the perfidy of U.S. policy toward the Apaches.The story of the long pursuit of Geronimo and his tiny band of Apaches by thousands of soldiers and Apache scouts is an American epic. Perhaps what ""Geronimo"" the movie doesn't have, and thus didn't capture the attention of the critics and the public, is a blockbuster scene that raises you out of your seat. But I thought ""Geronimo"" was an honest, informative, well-made film that should be rated among the top twenty Westerns of all time.",5,An under-rated movie,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,1471,"['share', 'opinion', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Geronimo', 'outstanding', 'undervalued', 'Western', 'Let', 'tick', 'off', 'reasons', 'why', 'such', 'good', 'movie.First', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'are', 'fabulous', 'photography', 'deliberately', 'great', 'scenes', 'other', 'Westerns', 'past', 'was', 'overcome', 'deja', 'vu', 'scene', 'file', 'mounted', 'Apaches', 'silhouetted', 'skyline', 'right', 'John', 'Ford', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'memory', 'serves', 'right.Secondly', 'performances', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'Geronimo', 'were', 'outstanding', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'were', 'fine', 'young', 'cavalry', 'officers', 'liked', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Reevis', 'Chato', 'friendly', 'trusting', 'ultimately', 'disillusioned', 'Apache', 'scout', 'Third', 'movie', 'was', 'reasonably', 'true', 'fact', 'avoided', 'noble', 'savage', 'philosophy', 'made', 'movies', 'such', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'tiresome', 'did', 'movie', 'gloss', 'perfidy', 'U.S.', 'policy', 'Apaches.The', 'story', 'long', 'pursuit', 'Geronimo', 'tiny', 'band', 'Apaches', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'Apache', 'scouts', 'American', 'epic', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'Geronimo', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'attention', 'critics', 'public', 'blockbuster', 'scene', 'seat', 'thought', 'Geronimo', 'was', 'honest', 'informative', 'well-made', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'top', 'twenty', 'Westerns', 'time']",N/A
13626,AK61LQI92GTCH,0767817672,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[21, 24]","This is the second Walter Hill movie I've seen recently, and I believe I'm getting the hang of it.  At least as far as his westerns go.  Hill takes as his subject matter a larger-than-life character, in this case the Apache warrior Geronimo, and embellishes the facts to fit a larger truth.  I say that without sarcasm or disapproval.  Hill turns a bandit queen into a prostitute, kills off one of his characters in the wrong place at the wrong time (to give a big star a death scene,) invents a fight between two men who probably never met, much less knew of each other.  There's a good reason this one is subtitled ""An American Legend.""  It's a fair approach for a filmmaker to take, but the raw material of his films have been so finely sifted by so many passionate students for so long they're almost magnets for those prone to nit-pick the tiniest historical accuracy.When I set aside my concerns for historical accuracy I discovered I enjoyed the heck out of this movie.  It looks beautiful, always a plus with a western shot on location.  Wes Studi, an American Indian of the Cherokee Nation, really reaches deep into the core of Geronimo - courageous, proud to the point of arrogance, and ultimately doomed.  To Hill's credit Geronimo isn't a two-dimensional wooden noble.  Likewise, his ""bad"" guys, in this case racist scout Robert Duvall, aren't caricatures either.  Hill doesn't paint in bold contrasts, and GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND feels real.  This mature approach comes at a price.  It's hard to build up to big dramatic moments in an action film when you don't have highly contrasted Good Guys and Bad Guys. Fortunately for the film and the audience GERONIMO'S cast is filled with high-caliber actors able to portray complex characters without losing the audience in the process.There's also a highly developed sense of intervention in GERONIMO.  Gene Hackman's General Crook (""They don't realize it, but I'm the best friend the Apaches have"") shields the Indians from a harsh interpretation of his orders.  Jason Patric visually embodies this theme - in a number of scenes he steps in between an angry aimed gun and the Native American it's pointed at.  Ultimately, I believe, Hill also intervenes between his audience and awkward facts and sour interpretations.  It's an approach that drives some historians to distraction, but also occasionally results in highly entertaining movies.",4,Geronimo,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2405,"['second', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'believe', ""'m"", 'getting', 'hang', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'westerns', 'go', 'Hill', 'subject', 'matter', 'larger-than-life', 'character', 'case', 'Apache', 'warrior', 'Geronimo', 'facts', 'fit', 'larger', 'truth', 'say', 'sarcasm', 'disapproval', 'Hill', 'bandit', 'queen', 'prostitute', 'one', 'characters', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'give', 'big', 'star', 'death', 'scene', 'fight', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'probably', 'never', 'met', 'much', 'less', 'knew', 'other', 'good', 'reason', 'one', 'subtitled', 'American', 'Legend', 'fair', 'approach', 'filmmaker', 'take', 'raw', 'material', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'finely', 'sifted', 'so', 'many', 'passionate', 'students', 'so', 'long', ""'re"", 'almost', 'magnets', 'prone', 'nit-pick', 'tiniest', 'historical', 'accuracy.When', 'set', 'aside', 'concerns', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'discovered', 'enjoyed', 'heck', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'always', 'plus', 'western', 'shot', 'location', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'American', 'Indian', 'Cherokee', 'Nation', 'really', 'deep', 'core', 'Geronimo', 'courageous', 'proud', 'point', 'arrogance', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'Hill', 'credit', 'Geronimo', ""n't"", 'two-dimensional', 'wooden', 'noble', 'Likewise', 'bad', 'guys', 'case', 'racist', 'scout', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'are', ""n't"", 'caricatures', 'either', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'paint', 'bold', 'contrasts', 'GERONIMO', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'LEGEND', 'feels', 'real', 'mature', 'approach', 'price', 'hard', 'build', 'up', 'big', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'action', 'film', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'highly', 'contrasted', 'Good', 'Guys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'audience', 'GERONIMO', 'cast', 'filled', 'high-caliber', 'actors', 'able', 'portray', 'complex', 'characters', 'losing', 'audience', 'process.There', 'also', 'highly', 'developed', 'sense', 'intervention', 'GERONIMO', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'General', 'Crook', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'m"", 'best', 'friend', 'Apaches', 'have', 'Indians', 'harsh', 'interpretation', 'orders', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'visually', 'theme', 'number', 'scenes', 'angry', 'aimed', 'gun', 'Native', 'American', 'pointed', 'Ultimately', 'believe', 'Hill', 'also', 'audience', 'awkward', 'facts', 'sour', 'interpretations', 'approach', 'historians', 'distraction', 'also', 'occasionally', 'results', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movies']",N/A

13632,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,0767817672,T O'Brien,"[1, 1]","Geronimo: An American Legend has gone mostly under the radar since its release in 1993, but it's an above average historical movie that tries to show the truth in history instead of how movies usually portray it.  In the 1880s, the U.S. Cavalry persuades Apache chief Geronimo to surrender and live on the reservation at Turkey Creek. But with a new life forced on him, Geronimo is uncomfortable and when a medicine man is shot down for inciting the tribe, the chief leaves the reservation with a band of warriors.  The cavalry must now get back in the field, patroling the Southwest in hopes of catching the renegade chief.  Like many good westerns, this movie deals with the changing times and how individuals dealt with those changes.  We are shown both perspectives, the cavalry and Geronimo, so it's a balanced movie overall.  It's not an action movie although the battle scenes are well-done, instead it's more of a character study of all the participants as the cavalry tries to bring Geronimo in to live on the reservation.  An underrated, very well-done movie.Leading an impressive ensemble cast, Jason Patric plays Lt. Charles Gatewood, a cavalry officer who respects the Apaches even as he fights them.  It is this respect that leads to a friendship with Geronimo.  Patric plays the part well as an officer who feels conflicted with what he's been ordered to do.  Gene Hackman gives support as General George Crook, the commander of the cavalry forced to capture the Apache chief. Not a huge part for Hackman, but still a really good one. Robert Duvall almost steals the movie as Al Sieber, the veteran scout who's come to despise the Apaches even though he sees many similarities between them and himself.  Wes Studi is excellent as Geronimo, the Apache chief who struggles to change with the times as the cavalry moves ever closer to catching him. And in one of his first movies, a young Matt Damon plays 2nd Lt. Britton Davis, an inexperienced officer who gains that experience on the Geronimo campaign.  Those five leads share the screentime and carry the movie.  The excellent supporting cast includes Steve Reevis as Chato, an Apache scout for the cavalry, Rodney Grant as Mangas, a close friend of Geronimo, and Kevin Tighe as General Nelson Miles. All around a very solid cast.The DVD unfortunately is somewhat disappointing although the price is low.  The movie is available only in pan-n-scan, not widescreen, which is a shame because director Walter Hill really has a beautiful movie here, filmed in Utah and Arizona.  Only special feature is a trailer.  But bad DVD or not, it's an excellent movie that benefits from a great cast and showing both sides of the story.

13633,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0767817672,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 6]","There's a lot wrong with Walter Hill's Geronimo: An American Legend. For a start, there's far too little of the magnificent Wes Studi and far too much of the unconvincingly one-note (and an off-key note at that) Jason Patric and a milquetoast Matt Damon when we want to spend more time with Geronimo. As John Milius said, ""I wrote a script about a mighty warrior chief. They made a film about a ***king white male model."" Not to mention film critic Larry Gross' rewrite is overly partial to other movies, particularly The Magnificent Seven and Alan Sharp's script for Ulzana's Raid. And, like all historical manhunt movies, it winds down as attrition wins over courage. Yet despite its flaws it's still one of the most impressive American Westerns of the past few decades.Geronimo may be sidelined for much of the picture, but when Wes Studi is allowed centerstage, he burns with the intensity of a supernova in a performance at once ferocious yet controlled, giving a sense not just of the rage and calculated violence but of the sadness that drives it. He's a proud man, but also a constantly disappointed one. When he's on screen, everyone else might as well not be there. When he isn't, Gene Hackman's General Crook and Robert Duvall's tracker Al Sieber provide enough believable old-school professionalism to compensate for Patric and Damon.Then there's the film's extraordinary visual sense. Unlike most modern films (including Hill's own subsequent Western, Wild Bill) it really embraces the landscape and isn't afraid of strikingly composed extreme long shots to give a real sense of scale to the picture. Ry Cooder's score, a mixture of sparse and plaintiff Native American airs and lightly ragged American hymnals, is another major feather in its cap: on paper it sounds like clich&eacute;, but put to picture it's absolutely right.It's perhaps easy to see why it flopped: it's a tragic story without any winners, only losers and the action scenes are often more brutal lightening strikes than enjoyable action setpieces. But it's certainly a film well worth rediscovering even if it's better seen on the big screen than the small one - though if you do see it on DVD, make sure you get the European PAL widescreen release rather than the US fullframe version.",5,"""No guns, No bullets could ever kill me.

13635,A37LWWZBFW2VRH,0767817672,"Wade R. Goria ""Historian""","[5, 7]","From the moment that Matt Damon as 2nd Lt. Britton Davis commenced a narration of this sensitive and fascinating account of  events  relating to America's campaign against the Chiricahua-Apache and,  in particular,  Geronimo's role in that conflict, it became evident that this film possessed a rare and special quality. Indeed, I have never viewed a more compassionate and engaging rendering of the American western experience. For this I remain full of admiration for Walter Hill's eminently successful endeavor to portray the painful realities of US policy towards native Americans in the west with insight and fairness. The cast is marvelous - Jason Patric as 1st Lt. Charles B. Greenwood, Gene Hackman as General George Crook, Robert Duvall as Chief of Scouts, Al Sieber, and the compelling Cherokee actor Wes Studi playing Geronimo together with a strong supporting cast, all deliver  memorable performances that seem perfectly suited to the lives they depict.Geronimo was released  just three years after Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves (1990) an epic that  brought a fresh and greatly needed  interpretation of the western experience by examining the particulars of America's conquest of lands inhabited by the Lakota -  the westernmost of three Sioux groups occupying lands in both North and South Dakota. Dances With Wolves is an excellent film, but to my mind, Geronimo stands as a superior work. Sadly as Geronimo was made for television in 1993, the film would be deprived of Academy Award consideration. It should be remembered that  John Houston's The Man Who Would Be King, also eluded acclaim during the Oscar ceremonies of  1975, then steadily secured a special niche reserved for greatness in the minds of legions of film goers.  There is no higher honor that I can accord Geronimo than to compare it with The Man Who Would Be King.In Geronimo, we are able to observe the fusion of a  brilliant script by an exceedingly talented screenplay writer, John Milius, Hill's wonderful direction, the majestic cinematography of Lloyd Ahern, a beautiful musical score by Ry Cooder, and first rate performances from a stellar cast. It should be noted that all of this was achieved without the inclusion of a love story. The title might certainly have been improved. And there are historical inaccuracies in this film to be sure, indeed quite a few of them. Nonetheless, the film captures the historical essence of the subject in a masterly fashion. Here we have a stunningly well told epic possessing a timeless message that contains an eerie relevancy to the politics of our contemporary world.An additional asset commending this film is the manner in which we are able to draw analogies between the stark and brutal nature of America's  policies against the Apache in 1886 with the basic attitude and approach found today among numerous Washington-based policymakers. Insensitive, arrogant, often loutish proponents of  ""neo-con"" philosophy today demonstrate a consistent inability or unwillingness to comprehend the nuances of other cultures. As in 1886, too many such people continue to exercise a determinant role in formulating Washington policies and have, through racist inclination or in the interest of corporate profit, brought about unnecessary and horrendous destruction worldwide. Lt. Charles B. Gatewood's character, expertly played by Jason Patric, possesses innate good sense and decisiveness. His daring, fluency with the Apache language, delicate feeling for the ways of the Chiricahua people and successful effort to persuade Geronimo to stand down, ended the desperate Chiricahua Apache warrior's struggle to maintain his freedom. Gatewood's talents and accomplishments are rewarded with punishment. Gatewood  will be posted  in Wyoming and forced to serve the rest of his military career in oblivion.The symbolism employed in this film is particularly effective, and we see this in a pronounced way at the very close of the film as Geronimo and his followers are carried by a train from their home in Arizona/New Mexico to Florida. In the new mechanized ""iron-horse"" dominated world  in which Geronimo found himself after his surrender, the cruel nature of a Washington-based policy of land grab that crushed a time-honored nomadic way of life is plainly revealed. A misleading impression created here is that Geronimo lived out his final twenty-two years in exile in Florida, which, he did not.  The details of this last phase of his life are quite understandably omitted as they do not fit into the romanticized image of the warrior that Hill so artfully projects.For the record,  Geronimo would be sent to Fort Pickens, Florida while his family was transported to Fort Marion in St. Augustine. In 1887, all were reunited following their transfer to the Mount Vernon Barracks in Alabama where they would remain for the next five years. Geronimo and his family were moved again in 1894 to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Geronimo never stopped asking to be returned to his native land. Many Apache people would die of tuberculosis and other diseases in Florida.  In time, Geronimo would participate in Wild West Shows, the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the 1901 Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, and the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair where he took advantage of his legendary reputation as a warrior to sell souvenirs. To his credit, Teddy Roosevelt asked Geronimo to participate in his Inaugural Parade of 1905.  Four years later in 1909, Geronimo died of pneumonia and the great Chiricahua/Apache warrior was buried in the Apache burial ground at Fort Sill.The story does not end here. The great grandson of Geronimo, 59 year old Harlyn Geronimo of Mascalero, New Mexico has asked President Bush to investigate the theft of  Geronimo's skull and femur which he believes was stolen by the President's grandfather Prescott Bush in 1918 from the burial grounds of Fort Sill, Oklahoma. There is some evidence to suggest that Prescott brought these skeletal remains to the headquarters of the Skull and Crossbone Society in New Haven Connecticut to be used for bizarre rituals including an initiation rite that is said by some to involve kissing a skull, referred to as ""Geronimo"" that is contained in a glass case. President Bush is a member of the ultra secret and powerful Skull and Bones Society and this probably explains his refusal to comment upon this issue.Thus ninety eight years after his death,  the cycle of life and the painful legacy of  betrayal and infamy surrounding Geronimo that accompanies it continues. In the meantime, additional analogies can be drawn to the perilous and too often futile efforts of oppressed people everywhere including the Chiricahua- Apache to secure, amid hostile forces aligned against them, a life characterized by justice, security, human dignity and freedom.",5,...a stunningly well told epic possessing a timeless message...,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,6823,"['moment',
