This production was described as ""A Manon Lescaut of fluid movement"", I have never come across a DVD with such jerky movement, in  addition there were numerous irritating pauses, the lips of the singers  were continuously out of sync with the sound (remeniscent of movies where  the sound was added later). Never having encountered this before I assumed  the problem was with my player but after trying the same disc in another  player with the same result, I conclude that the problem is the disc. I  found myself so irritated by this that after the first Act I turned the  picture off and listened only to the sound.Anyone who buys this DVD  should do so only with the proviso that they can return the disc if these  problems occur.",1,"Great Opera, Pity about the Quality of the DVD.",962409600,"07 1, 2000",2000,1511,"['15th', 'November', '2013It', 'now', '13', 'years', 'review', 'Amazon', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'added', 'review', 'different', 'product', 'newer', 'release.They', 'have', 'also', 'included', '3', 'VHS', 'reviews', 'other', 'performance', 'have', 'relevance', 'subsequent', 'DVD', 'release.The', '2', 'DVD', 'releases', '1980', 'Metropolitan', 'Production', 'know', 'i', 'May', '2000', 'Pioneer', 'Classics', 'release', 'still', 'available', 'ii', '2006', 'Deutsche', 'Gramophon', 'release.Not', 'having', 'seen', '2006', 'Deutsche', 'Gramophon', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'quality', 'release.There', 'also', '1', 'DVD', 'review', 'dated', 'December', '1999', 'so', 'perhaps', 'were', '3', 'releases.My', 'review', 'only', 'refers', '2000', 'Pioneer', 'Classics', 'release', '1st', 'July', '2000Good', 'Performances', 'Good', 'Music', 'Production', 'spoiled', 'quality', 'DVD', 'production', 'was', 'described', 'A', 'Manon', 'Lescaut', 'fluid', 'movement', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'DVD', 'such', 'jerky', 'movement', 'addition', 'were', 'numerous', 'irritating', 'pauses', 'lips', 'singers', 'were', 'continuously', 'sync', 'sound', 'remeniscent', 'movies', 'where', 'sound', 'was', 'added', 'later', 'Never', 'having', 'encountered', 'assumed', 'problem', 'was', 'player', 'trying', 'same', 'disc', 'player', 'same', 'result', 'conclude', 'problem', 'disc', 'found', 'so', 'irritated', 'first', 'Act', 'turned', 'picture', 'listened', 'only', 'sound.Anyone', 'who', 'DVD', 'should', 'do', 'so', 'only', 'proviso', 'can', 'return', 'disc', 'problems', 'occur']",N/A

The first two expressions are just in, and I'll buy what it pleases me to buy.  But Manon.  This I thought was glorious music gloriously sung and acted to within an inch of its life by everyone involved.  Manon has always been one of my favorite operas, this is the first time I've seen it, and I doubt I'll watch it again, nothing happens, I'll just listen to the CDs.  I only had 2 objections.  Scotto and Domingo were both a bit long in the tooth for their roles which to me anyway was very hard to take, the illusion that they were 18 or 20 years old was impossible to maintain.  Both were wonderful of course, just too told for their parts.  And (sigh, which is typical of an opera), it took forever for Scotto to die, in fact, the music notwithstanding (and I've always loved listening to it), I got bored and started laughing at the dialogue or lyrics or whatever its called by those who are in the know.  The sets (as others mentioned) were really wonderful.  Levine performed as well as the actors on stage.  He always seemed to be looking right into the camera or at least facing it, this was particularly prolonged during the intermezzo.  I liked Levine (or at least, never disliked him) up until this DVD.  The subtitles were thorough, a thing I've not encountered lately on other DVDs.  I recomend this DVD 100% musically and for everything except the age of its stars, and if you can find a version as perfectly done with younger lovers (and by younger, I mean young), I wish you'd recommend that to me.",5,Glorious,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1649,"['dislike', 'reviewers', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'use', 'expressions', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'quot', 'quot', 'must', 'read', 'quot', 'quot', 'buy', 'quot', 'first', 'two', 'expressions', 'are', 'just', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'what', 'buy', 'Manon', 'thought', 'was', 'glorious', 'music', 'gloriously', 'sung', 'acted', 'inch', 'life', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Manon', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'operas', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'nothing', 'happens', ""'ll"", 'just', 'listen', 'CDs', 'only', 'had', '2', 'objections', 'Scotto', 'Domingo', 'were', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'roles', 'anyway', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'illusion', 'were', '18', '20', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'impossible', 'maintain', 'were', 'wonderful', 'course', 'just', 'too', 'told', 'parts', 'sigh', 'typical', 'opera', 'took', 'forever', 'Scotto', 'die', 'fact', 'music', 'notwithstanding', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'listening', 'got', 'bored', 'started', 'laughing', 'dialogue', 'lyrics', 'whatever', 'called', 'who', 'are', 'know', 'sets', 'others', 'mentioned', 'were', 'really', 'wonderful', 'Levine', 'performed', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'stage', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'looking', 'right', 'camera', 'least', 'facing', 'was', 'particularly', 'prolonged', 'intermezzo', 'liked', 'Levine', 'least', 'never', 'disliked', 'up', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'were', 'thorough', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'not', 'encountered', 'lately', 'other', 'DVDs', 'recomend', 'DVD', '100', '%', 'musically', 'everything', 'age', 'stars', 'can', 'find', 'version', 'perfectly', 'done', 'younger', 'lovers', 'younger', 'mean', 'young', 'wish', ""'d"", 'recommend']",N/A

She makes you laugh, she makes you cry - what more can you ask for? There  is a chemistry between her and Domingo that inspires him to give one of the  greatest perfomances I have ever seen from him (and yes I was at his Covent  Garden Otello in front of the late Princess of Wales).

She was a WONDERFUL Manon--the entire Act II was especiallyenjoyable, as was Act IV. Scotto is a great actress, as well as havinga beautiful voice, and she seemed to really sink her teeth into the part.For me, this performance was equal, though different, from the Kiri Te Kanawa ""Manon Lescaut"". It is true, Kiri and Placido Domingo had lotsof chemistry! They are awesome together. That is a hard performance totop. But Renata Scotto's portrayal was so much fun, I think I enjoyed itjust as much. Maybe the Kiri version is slightly more romantic.(I would mention that for me the Mattila/Giordani MET performance wassadly disappointing. No sparks there. And some less than shimmeringvocals as well, at times.)I highly recommend this Renata Scotto ""Manon Lescaut"".

223961,A3N882HVOOPA2I,6300217647,Z. Yang,"[21, 31]","""A woman like Manon can have more than one lover"", this is a statement made by Puccini when he decided to write his opera of ""Manon"", facing the already universally successful ""Manon"" by his French predecessor Massenet. Distinctively, he brought out his Manon with innocence, vanity, and cupidity, and Des Grieux, Manon's passionate lover, with Italian blood.There is an abrupt jump from Act I to Act II, which may result in discontinuity of Manon's characters, as well as her love to Des Grieux. But as it goes on and as Puccini's music gets more deeply into the agony of the lovers, it gets better. In Act III the emotion has reached its hilt when Des Grieux sings his desperate pleading ""Guardate, pazzo son"", begging the captain to let him aboard with Manon. The strong dramatics then carries on and gets intensified in Act IV, and ends on Manon's tragic death and Des Grieux's helpless sobbing.Soprano Reneta Scott, who sings Manon, is impressive in singing. Giving the best performance in Act IV, she is amazing in her vocal power, in forte or in piano. But portraying an eighteen-year-old character, Scott needs more than she could in order to be convincing. She delivers Manon with accuracy, if not vividness.Although it is the story of Manon, on the stage of Met shines the brilliant Des Grieux, played by Domingo. His voice is lighter and brighter, and yet, more expressive, and his big outbursts are wallop. He looks young and lean, and his acting is full of feeling. Act IV is purely Pucinni with great intensity. Domingo portrays desperation and rage brilliantly. His sobbing is heartbreaking.One big problem with this DVD is its video and audio quality. Almost every motion on the screen has a ghost tail following behind, somewhat distracting, and at times, annoying. The audio is not as bad as video, but just acceptable.
