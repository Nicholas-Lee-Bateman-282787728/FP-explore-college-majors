I found that  the acting was perfectly done and the emotions and struggles experienced by  the characters were captivating.  Immediately, I was drawn in to the story  as the actors unveiled the identities of the characters I had come to know  and understand through reading the Herriot stories.",5,Breathtaking!!!,968803200,"09 13, 2000",2000,425,"['watching', 'series', 'PBS', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'sudden', 'switch', 'characters', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'found', 'acting', 'was', 'perfectly', 'done', 'emotions', 'struggles', 'experienced', 'characters', 'were', 'captivating', 'Immediately', 'was', 'drawn', 'story', 'actors', 'unveiled', 'identities', 'characters', 'had', 'come', 'know', 'understand', 'reading', 'Herriot', 'stories']",N/A

Thanks!Being a die hard James Herriot fan, I had to watch this movie.  I have to say that I watched it to the end, but was pretty underwhelmed. My husband lost interest and escaped to his study about two thirds of the way through.It in does not measure up well to the tone of the books and is decidedly inferior to the television series.  The performances were boring, and the script was not as faithful to the spirit of books as I would have liked.  Some change is to be expected because of time constraints, but there were changes that were not necessary and didn't make sense nor did they contribute in any way to the retelling of the story - for example, why did James come from London instead of Scotland in this version?  Several little things were changed for no apparant reason, while leaving in huge awkward chunks of story that didn't add anything to the whole.  The script was herky-jerky with no real storyline, other than a series of incidents set against the backdrop of James and Helen's romance.  It seemed that there were needless story changes that did nothing to enhance the movie, while leaving in awkward parts that needed to be pruned to make the story flow in a sensible manner. I didn't understand why the screenplay flowed the way it did.Anthony Hopkins, who is normally a superior actor, is especially disappointing in the role of Siegfried - not at all up to his usual standards.  His rendition of this character was dark and looming, with not much of the humor that comes through in the book. After watching this movie, I could understand why Donald Sinclair (the real Siegfried)was so offended that he threatened to sue when he saw how he was being portrayed!I have heard that Lisa Harrow was James Harriot's personal favorite of all the Helens, and I thought she was very fetching in the role.  However, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the two lead actors, and their romance wasn't very believable to me.  Simon Ward did nothing for the part of James, and I much preferred Christopher Timothy's James Herriot in the TV series.Brian Stirner was just OK in the part of Tristan.Actors aside, it was the screenplay and direction that left the most to be desired.  I just couldn't get past the choppy storyline.  One reviewer said that it needed to have a more cohesive plot, and I agree.  If you are going to take a whole book and trim it down into a feature film, at least make changes that make sense and contribute to an understandable plot.There is one scene in the movie that was actually better than the series, though - It was where James asks Helen's father if he can marry her.  John Collin did a positively wonderful job of playing Mr. Alderson, and because of his sensitive and touching portrayal, made this the best telling of this particular part of the story.  It reminded me of Donald Sutherland's scene in PRIDE AND PREDJUDICE where he realizes that Lizzy really loves Mr. Darcy!  First rate acting in this scene, and the only reason this movie rates more than one or two stars from me!  Truly a standout performance in an otherwise so-so flick.I am glad I saw this movie, if for no other reason than my curiosity has been satisfied, but this will be the one and only time I will watch it, while I go back to the book and the TV series again and again.  I may take another peek at John Collin's scene, though!",3,"Mediocre Movie, Not Worthy of James Herriot",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3483,"['Warning', 'are', 'few', 'spoilers', 'review', 'so', 'are', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'pass', 'Thanks', 'Being', 'die', 'hard', 'James', 'Herriot', 'fan', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'watched', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'underwhelmed', 'husband', 'lost', 'interest', 'escaped', 'study', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'through.It', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'well', 'tone', 'books', 'decidedly', 'inferior', 'television', 'series', 'performances', 'were', 'boring', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'change', 'be', 'expected', 'time', 'constraints', 'were', 'changes', 'were', 'not', 'necessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'did', 'contribute', 'way', 'retelling', 'story', 'example', 'why', 'did', 'James', 'come', 'London', 'instead', 'Scotland', 'version', 'Several', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'apparant', 'reason', 'leaving', 'huge', 'awkward', 'chunks', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'whole', 'script', 'was', 'herky-jerky', 'real', 'storyline', 'other', 'series', 'incidents', 'set', 'backdrop', 'James', 'Helen', 'romance', 'seemed', 'were', 'needless', 'story', 'changes', 'did', 'nothing', 'enhance', 'movie', 'leaving', 'awkward', 'parts', 'needed', 'be', 'pruned', 'make', 'story', 'flow', 'sensible', 'manner', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'screenplay', 'flowed', 'way', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'normally', 'superior', 'actor', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'role', 'Siegfried', 'not', 'up', 'usual', 'standards', 'rendition', 'character', 'was', 'dark', 'looming', 'not', 'much', 'humor', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'Donald', 'Sinclair', 'real', 'Siegfried', 'was', 'so', 'offended', 'threatened', 'sue', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'was', 'being', 'portrayed', 'have', 'heard', 'Lisa', 'Harrow', 'was', 'James', 'Harriot', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Helens', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'fetching', 'role', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'chemistry', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'romance', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'did', 'nothing', 'part', 'James', 'much', 'preferred', 'Christopher', 'Timothy', 'James', 'Herriot', 'TV', 'series.Brian', 'Stirner', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'part', 'Tristan.Actors', 'aside', 'was', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'left', 'most', 'be', 'desired', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'choppy', 'storyline', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'needed', 'have', 'more', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'agree', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'whole', 'book', 'trim', 'down', 'feature', 'film', 'least', 'make', 'changes', 'make', 'sense', 'contribute', 'understandable', 'plot.There', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'series', 'was', 'where', 'James', 'Helen', 'father', 'can', 'marry', 'John', 'Collin', 'did', 'positively', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Alderson', 'sensitive', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'made', 'best', 'telling', 'particular', 'part', 'story', 'reminded', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'scene', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREDJUDICE', 'where', 'Lizzy', 'really', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'First', 'rate', 'acting', 'scene', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'rates', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'stars', 'Truly', 'standout', 'performance', 'otherwise', 'so-so', 'flick.I', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'curiosity', 'been', 'satisfied', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'watch', 'go', 'back', 'book', 'TV', 'series', 'again', 'again', 'may', 'take', 'peek', 'John', 'Collin', 'scene']",N/A
