982202,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F3UAFC,A Customer,"[6, 9]","The lovely Mrs. Erlynne has a problem. Spurned by all the society ladies, for discreetly servicing their husbands, she can no longer afford to spend her days living in New York as the ""woman of ill repute."" Suddenly she finds herself an outcast and penniless, so she decides to travel to the Amalfi Coast of Italy, where she hopes to squeeze some cash out of some fresh prey.She sets herself on the young newlyweds Robert and Meg Windermere (Mark Umbers and Scarlett Johansson) and in the process; she hopes to find herself a new man. But Mrs. Erlynne also holds a secret, a secret that if made known, will threaten to destroy the young couple's marriage.  Robert doesn't want his wife's peace disturbed and doesn't want her to know about the secret; yet Mrs. Erlynne takes advantage of the situation, after all, she desperately needs someone - preferably an aristocrat to keep her in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed.Neither Robert nor Mrs. Erlynne, however, have reckoned on the vituperative nature of the Italian aristocracy. Amalfi is a hotbed of idol gossip, with the elegantly rich entertaining themselves by spying on each other, soaking up all the scandal wherever they can find it. Almost instantly, conjecture becomes facts. Mr. Windermere's clandestine meetings with Mrs. Erlynne are quickly mistaken for a tawdry affair. The fire flares when Meg finds check stubs paid to Mrs. Erlynne in her husband's desk.Word quickly gets around, especially with a woman such as Mrs. Erlynne and her past threatens to catch up with her The only person who doesn't judge her is the lovable and kindhearted - and very rich - Tuppy, a bachelor who yearns to marry his match. Meanwhile, the caddish Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore) is courting the innocent Meg, and she's quite enamored of him.Everyone is soon immersed in a maelstrom of illicit liaisons and racy sexual politics. Meg is convinced her new husband is having an affair, whilst Mrs. Ermine is fraught with confusion - a born outsider, marriage has never been for her, yet she's getting a little too old to be constantly branded as such a ""loose"" woman. In A Good Woman the wealthy are sarcastic, bitter, witty and conniving just as much as they are innocent, emotional, regretful and honest.Based on Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, director Mike Barker does a fabulous job of drawing the Wilde social satire out of the drawing room, and opening up the play to Italy in the 1930's and incorporating some of the most beautiful and sparkling Riviera vistas as a backdrop, The production design is unsurpassed - the film is lush, exotic and absolutely gorgeous to watch, there's never a scene or an image wasted.The acting is also strong. Hunt beautifully captures, Mrs. Erlynne's vulnerability and pain - she's a damaged and lonely woman, who obviously loves money and the sort of lifestyle it can bring, but she's also a realist and doesn't hesitate to play the shameless vamp with a knack for insinuating herself into the beds and checkbook registers of men who should know better.Tom Wilkinson absolutely nails the very wealthy but lonely Tuppy with the required tragicomic pitch that brings forth a great deal of self-effacing charm. And of course the beautiful Scarlet is extremely good here and manages to seem nave and vulnerable without tipping into melodramatics.Oscar Wilde liked men with a future and women with a past. In a Good Woman he wouldn't be disappointed, as the film is full of colorful and endlessly pithy types who seek to escape their past mistakes, yet seem to have a real love for life.

982206,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000F3UAFC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I remember wanting to see this movie for the mere fact that Scarlett Johansson was staring and I totally adore her.  The movie hadn't received the grandest of reviews and so I stayed away until a few weeks back my wife and I decided to rent it.  I must admit that, while I can understand to a degree some of the bad press, it truly is far from a horrible mess.  The film is shockingly engaging and in the end I found that I enjoyed myself my more than I thought I would.Based on Oscar Wilde's play `Lady Windermere's Fan', the film follows a young married couple, the Windermere's, as they settle into their home in Italy.  Young Meg is infatuated with her successful husband Robert and trusts him indefinitely.  That works to her advantage, especially when Mrs. Erlynne moves into town.  Notorious for conniving her way into the lives of married men, the town is obviously up in arms about her arrival.  She quickly becomes the talk of the town.  Meg, having met her, doesn't understand why there is so much gossip to be had, but when it becomes common knowledge that her husband has been spending unnecessary amounts of time with Mrs. Erlynne, even giving her money, she begins to worry for her marriage.There is more to `A Good Woman' then the synopsis that I just provided.  There is much more to Mrs. Erlynne alone than meets the eye.  In fact I never would have guessed how this movie would end, and I think that's why I liked it all the more.One major plus to this film is the marvelous Tom Wilkinson.  His performance as Tuppy, the successful bachelor who tries to woo Mrs. Erlynne for himself, is seriously best in show.  I only wish he had been in every scene.  Wilkinson is always top notch, that's for sure, and here is obviously no exception.  Mark Umbers is rather forgettable as Robert Windermere, but thankfully the film isn't that interested in him aside from a prop character.  The film is much more concentrated on the jealousy building in his wife and the mystery behind Mrs. Erlynne.  Stephen Campbell Moore does a fine job playing Lord Darlington, the young suitor obsessed with having Meg to himself.  His performance, while not award worthy, is memorable and natural.  He has a natural charisma and charm that is befitting.The two female leads are both adequate as well.  Scarlett Johansson, while not giving her finest performance, delivers as Meg a character that is nave and trusting yet guarded in a way.  By the end of the film she is forced to find herself even if it means falling flat on her face.  She manages to pull this off well.  Helen Hunt, many have jested, is too old for this role.  I agree, yet have to disagree.  I actually really enjoyed her performance.  She looks ancient here, older than she really is, and I found that odd.  You'd think they would have made her look younger for the purposes of the character, but they don't.  Regardless, she nails the performance in my opinion.  I love her chemistry with Wilkinson especially, even if he steals the scenes.In the end I felt that `A Good Woman' was a good movie, one that is rewarding in its own ways.  Sure, it's not phenomenal and it's certainly not the best period piece to come around in recent years, but it manages to deliver a solid 3  star movie that is fun and exciting and something that the whole family can enjoy.",3,It has a few tricks up its sleeve that makes it fun and entertaining...,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,3324,"['remember', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'mere', 'fact', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'staring', 'totally', 'adore', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'received', 'grandest', 'reviews', 'so', 'stayed', 'away', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'wife', 'decided', 'rent', 'must', 'admit', 'can', 'understand', 'degree', 'bad', 'press', 'truly', 'far', 'horrible', 'mess', 'film', 'shockingly', 'engaging', 'end', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'thought', 'would.Based', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'play', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'film', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'Windermere', 'settle', 'home', 'Italy', 'Young', 'Meg', 'infatuated', 'successful', 'husband', 'Robert', 'indefinitely', 'advantage', 'especially', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'town', 'Notorious', 'conniving', 'way', 'lives', 'married', 'men', 'town', 'obviously', 'up', 'arms', 'arrival', 'quickly', 'talk', 'town', 'Meg', 'having', 'met', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'gossip', 'be', 'had', 'when', 'common', 'knowledge', 'husband', 'been', 'spending', 'unnecessary', 'amounts', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'even', 'giving', 'money', 'worry', 'marriage.There', 'more', 'A', 'Good', 'Woman', 'then', 'synopsis', 'just', 'provided', 'much', 'more', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'alone', 'eye', 'fact', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'think', 'why', 'liked', 'more.One', 'major', 'film', 'marvelous', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'performance', 'Tuppy', 'successful', 'bachelor', 'who', 'woo', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'seriously', 'best', 'show', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'scene', 'Wilkinson', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'sure', 'here', 'obviously', 'exception', 'Mark', 'Umbers', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'Robert', 'Windermere', 'thankfully', 'film', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'aside', 'prop', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'concentrated', 'jealousy', 'building', 'wife', 'mystery', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'young', 'suitor', 'obsessed', 'having', 'Meg', 'performance', 'not', 'award', 'worthy', 'memorable', 'natural', 'natural', 'charisma', 'charm', 'befitting.The', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'adequate', 'well', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'not', 'giving', 'finest', 'performance', 'delivers', 'Meg', 'character', 'nave', 'trusting', 'yet', 'guarded', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'forced', 'find', 'even', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'many', 'have', 'jested', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'agree', 'yet', 'have', 'disagree', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'ancient', 'here', 'older', 'really', 'found', 'odd', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'look', 'younger', 'purposes', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'Regardless', 'performance', 'opinion', 'love', 'chemistry', 'Wilkinson', 'especially', 'even', 'scenes.In', 'end', 'felt', 'Good', 'Woman', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'rewarding', 'own', 'ways', 'Sure', 'not', 'phenomenal', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'period', 'piece', 'come', 'around', 'recent', 'years', 'deliver', 'solid', '3', 'star', 'movie', 'fun', 'exciting', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

This time around: 1- I'm not a fan of Ms Johansson; 2- Mr Wilkinson, I feel, has been in altogether far too many films of late and I'm bored with him; 3- Recent adaptations of Wilde's works have suffered greatly by their directors' attempts to 'open up' the claustrophobic parlour parlance with scenic inserts in an attempt to be nominated for a Cinematography Oscar at the cost of crippling the cadence inherent in Mr W's plays; 4- learning that some of the cast were Americans, feared that they'd do a gawdawful job with their English accents; and 5- Lady Windermere's Fan is not among my favourite Wilde plays.This film did not require a second viewing. At least not for me to thoroughly enjoy it. It may require a second viewing, however, for me to search for all of its pitfalls. And that can be fairly enjoyable in itself, mind.None of the main actors, including Ms Johansson, appear to be 'acting', if you will. They are their characters, they inhabit them. It feels right and not forced. Mr Wilkinson does a better job here than with the Rev from EARNEST: light with hidden gravitasse as opposed to cartoonish ecumincalism.The pacing is great AND the director gets to 'open up' the world of his movie. Though with a different setting (Italy) and time (1930s), his transitions and inserts keep up with the tempo of Wilde's words (even if it's a pity many of them are still excised in this abbreviated adaptation) while injecting fresh energy into how and where scenes are played out. And I did like how this tale - or expose - of social scandal played out within the circle of British and American upper-class while surrounded by one of the more passionate and explosive tribes, the Italians.This was a good, solid movie, even without orcs, explosions and cgi talking cars (though these can be good, too).

982224,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000F3UAFC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 11]","I really went back and forth with this film.  In the end, though, I just couldn't get past the fact that even a good script based on the work of a literary genius like Oscar Wilde just can't overcome the deleterious effects of problematic acting.  I can't bring myself to say bad acting because I think Scarlett Johansson is a very good actress and - while I don't really care for her - Helen Hunt is as well.  Neither was very good in One Good Woman, however.  The blame must really fall on the director and casting director, though, as neither actress really belonged in this film.  Helen Hunt may well have tried too hard to fill the role of the adventuress, man-chasing Mrs. Erlynne, resulting in a slow and careful (sometimes stultifying) delivery of dialogue that gives rise to no feeling or charisma whatsoever.  With very little charm at her disposal, it becomes difficult to believe that so many men fall so easily under her spell.  As for Johansson, she seems totally out of her element here, clearly uncomfortable throughout many a scene.  Fortunately, Tom Wilkinson and the fellows I affectionately call ""the old geezers"" come bearing the quick wit and natural bearing called for in this type of satirical treatment.  That allows the script to shine in places, thereby saving the whole project from disaster.Clearly, this film takes many a liberty with Oscar Wilde's classic drama Lady Windermere's Fan, yet it still wields quite an impressive sword of satirical wit here and there in the script.  The story is basically an attack on the hypocrisies of gossip vis-&agrave;-vis high society, something Wilde knew quite a bit about.  Lady Meg Windermere (Scarlett Johansson) is a young newlywed living in idyllic bliss with her husband Robert.  Wealthy, attractive, and well-to-do, she thinks she has the perfect marriage to a man she trusts implicitly.  Then Mrs. Erlynne shows up, having left New York rather hastily, courtesy of several wives anxious to see her depart from their husbands' lives.  Mrs. Erlynne has always relied (and indeed prospered mightily) on the kindness of strange men, earning her quite a reputation in 1930s America and, rather quickly, Italy.  She and Robert Windermere are soon the hot topic of local gossip, with nosy well-to-do women tracking their private meetings and going quite apoplectic about it to one another.  When word finally filters down to her, Meg is quite stunned and contemplates some rather rash action of her own.  Meanwhile, dear old Tuppy (Wilkinson), a man with his own share of past social indelicacies, quite falls for Mrs. Erlynne and proposes marriage - to the chagrin of all his marriage-hating buddies.  These are the lovable ""old geezers"" I was talking about, and they constantly delight the viewer with short, stinging, and remarkably witty complaints about the institution of marriage.I won't attempt to chronicle the shifting layers of this film, for the plot takes a number of delicious turns along the way.  The plot's solid, as is the writing.  Indeed, I would sometimes find myself pulled into the story rather engagingly, but the magic always departed once Hunt and/or Johansson turned up for a more serious scene.  That proves to be too much for this film to overcome.  Yes, it's always a treat to reexplore Victorian sensibilities (even if they're arbitrarily shifted to 1930s Italy), but A Good Woman never exhibits the first sign of life or energy, plodding its way through a story that could have and should have been much more enjoyable.",3,The miscasting is mightier than the engaging storyline,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,3521,"['really', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'film', 'end', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'even', 'good', 'script', 'based', 'work', 'literary', 'genius', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'deleterious', 'effects', 'problematic', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'say', 'bad', 'acting', 'think', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'One', 'Good', 'Woman', 'however', 'blame', 'must', 'really', 'fall', 'director', 'casting', 'director', 'though', 'actress', 'really', 'belonged', 'film', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'fill', 'role', 'adventuress', 'man-chasing', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'resulting', 'slow', 'careful', 'sometimes', 'stultifying', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'rise', 'feeling', 'charisma', 'whatsoever', 'very', 'little', 'charm', 'disposal', 'difficult', 'believe', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'fall', 'so', 'easily', 'spell', 'Johansson', 'totally', 'element', 'here', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'many', 'scene', 'Fortunately', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'fellows', 'affectionately', 'call', 'old', 'geezers', 'come', 'bearing', 'quick', 'wit', 'natural', 'bearing', 'called', 'type', 'satirical', 'treatment', 'script', 'shine', 'places', 'thereby', 'saving', 'whole', 'project', 'disaster.Clearly', 'film', 'many', 'liberty', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'classic', 'drama', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'yet', 'still', 'quite', 'impressive', 'sword', 'satirical', 'wit', 'here', 'there', 'script', 'story', 'basically', 'attack', 'hypocrisies', 'gossip', 'vis-', 'agrave', 'high', 'society', 'something', 'Wilde', 'knew', 'quite', 'bit', 'Lady', 'Meg', 'Windermere', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'young', 'newlywed', 'living', 'idyllic', 'bliss', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Wealthy', 'attractive', 'well-to-do', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'man', 'implicitly', 'Then', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'up', 'having', 'left', 'New', 'York', 'rather', 'hastily', 'courtesy', 'several', 'wives', 'anxious', 'see', 'depart', 'husbands', 'lives', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'always', 'relied', 'indeed', 'prospered', 'mightily', 'kindness', 'strange', 'men', 'earning', 'quite', 'reputation', '1930s', 'America', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Italy', 'Robert', 'Windermere', 'are', 'soon', 'hot', 'topic', 'local', 'gossip', 'nosy', 'well-to-do', 'women', 'tracking', 'private', 'meetings', 'going', 'quite', 'apoplectic', 'one', 'When', 'word', 'finally', 'down', 'Meg', 'quite', 'stunned', 'rather', 'rash', 'action', 'own', 'Meanwhile', 'dear', 'old', 'Tuppy', 'Wilkinson', 'man', 'own', 'share', 'past', 'social', 'indelicacies', 'quite', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'marriage', 'chagrin', 'marriage-hating', 'buddies', 'are', 'lovable', 'old', 'geezers', 'was', 'talking', 'constantly', 'delight', 'viewer', 'short', 'stinging', 'remarkably', 'witty', 'complaints', 'institution', 'marriage.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'chronicle', 'shifting', 'layers', 'film', 'plot', 'number', 'delicious', 'turns', 'way', 'plot', 'solid', 'writing', 'Indeed', 'would', 'sometimes', 'find', 'pulled', 'story', 'rather', 'engagingly', 'magic', 'always', 'departed', 'once', 'Hunt', 'and/or', 'Johansson', 'turned', 'up', 'more', 'serious', 'scene', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'overcome', 'Yes', 'always', 'treat', 'reexplore', 'Victorian', 'sensibilities', 'even', ""'re"", 'arbitrarily', 'shifted', '1930s', 'Italy', 'A', 'Good', 'Woman', 'never', 'first', 'sign', 'life', 'energy', 'plodding', 'way', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable']",N/A

982230,A234YLAS2MYYWA,B000F3UAFC,Dolphin,"[1, 1]","This loose modernization of the Wilde play ""Lady Windermere's Fan"" could have been even better.  The ingredients are all there (a cleverly deceptive plot, brilliant dialogue, excellent actors, fantastic locations) and yet something is missing.  For me it's the vital chemistry among the actors, and the casting is partly to blame.  Also, both the female leads would have benefited from more flattering camera angles and stronger direction, as they seemed reluctant to inject much personality into the roles of two devastatingly alluring women.  Helen Hunt gave an anaemic and overly depressed performance, and was simply not believable as a career mistress who had been the luxuriously-kept darling of the wealthiest men in New York.  Scarlett Johansson sleepwalked through the entire movie wearing the same sulky expression and surprisingly failed to convey the intriguing duality of her part.  Mark Umbers, an English actor, was awkwardly cast as an American;  he did his best but was hampered by said lack of chemistry with the main female characters.On the positive side, Stephen Campbell-Moore gave an elegant and utterly convincing performance as a charming but slightly dissolute aristocrat.  John Standing was delightful as the slightly squiffy socialite.  Milena Vukotic provided many hilarious moments with a perfectly straight face.  In fact, all the supporting characters gave very good performances, but the stand-out was undoubtedly Tom Wilkinson who routinely stole every scene he was in.  What saved this film was a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Oscar Wilde's epigrams which ran like a bubbling stream throughout the play.  In fact it was almost overdone, as nearly all of Wilde's famous quips seem to have been utilized, many harvested from his other material.The play urges society to take an honest look at how narrow-minded attitudes and malicious gossip can wreak havoc with innocent people's lives when ""circumstantial evidence"" is taken at face value, and also how sometimes the truth can hurt more than a discreet obfuscation of past events.  It also shows how someone with a bad reputation can rise above a blemished past and achieve redemption through an act of noble self-sacrifice.  Anyone familiar with Wilde's life will recognize his personal knowledge of  these themes, however, in his inimitable style he makes his points through humour rather than by preaching.  Another excellent reason to watch this production is the visual feast of the villa interiors and the beautifully photographed Amalfi location.  I have deducted a star because of the uneven cast, but that has not stopped me from watching this DVD several times already and, to me, the brilliant dialogue alone would justify a purchase.",4,Oscar Wilde saves the day (and this film),1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,2734,"['loose', 'modernization', 'Wilde', 'play', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'cleverly', 'deceptive', 'plot', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'actors', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'yet', 'something', 'missing', 'vital', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'casting', 'partly', 'blame', 'Also', 'female', 'leads', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'flattering', 'camera', 'angles', 'stronger', 'direction', 'seemed', 'reluctant', 'inject', 'much', 'personality', 'roles', 'two', 'devastatingly', 'alluring', 'women', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'gave', 'anaemic', 'overly', 'depressed', 'performance', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'career', 'mistress', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'luxuriously-kept', 'darling', 'wealthiest', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'sleepwalked', 'entire', 'movie', 'wearing', 'same', 'sulky', 'expression', 'surprisingly', 'failed', 'convey', 'intriguing', 'duality', 'part', 'Mark', 'Umbers', 'English', 'actor', 'was', 'awkwardly', 'cast', 'American', 'did', 'best', 'was', 'hampered', 'said', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'main', 'female', 'characters.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Stephen', 'Campbell-Moore', 'gave', 'elegant', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'performance', 'charming', 'slightly', 'dissolute', 'aristocrat', 'John', 'Standing', 'was', 'delightful', 'slightly', 'squiffy', 'socialite', 'Milena', 'Vukotic', 'provided', 'many', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'perfectly', 'straight', 'face', 'fact', 'supporting', 'characters', 'gave', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'stand-out', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'routinely', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'What', 'saved', 'film', 'was', 'seemingly', 'inexhaustible', 'supply', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'epigrams', 'ran', 'bubbling', 'stream', 'play', 'fact', 'was', 'almost', 'overdone', 'nearly', 'Wilde', 'famous', 'quips', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'utilized', 'many', 'harvested', 'other', 'material.The', 'play', 'urges', 'society', 'take', 'honest', 'look', 'how', 'narrow-minded', 'attitudes', 'malicious', 'gossip', 'can', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'innocent', 'people', 'lives', 'when', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'also', 'how', 'sometimes', 'truth', 'can', 'hurt', 'more', 'discreet', 'obfuscation', 'past', 'events', 'also', 'how', 'someone', 'bad', 'reputation', 'can', 'rise', 'blemished', 'past', 'achieve', 'redemption', 'act', 'noble', 'self-sacrifice', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Wilde', 'life', 'will', 'recognize', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'themes', 'however', 'inimitable', 'style', 'points', 'humour', 'rather', 'preaching', 'excellent', 'reason', 'watch', 'production', 'visual', 'feast', 'villa', 'interiors', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Amalfi', 'location', 'have', 'deducted', 'star', 'uneven', 'cast', 'not', 'stopped', 'watching', 'DVD', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'would', 'justify', 'purchase']",N/A

There is much that is worthwhile about director Mike Barker's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic play of manners, ""Lady Windermere's Fan"". With his trademark cleverness and sophisticated characters, Wilde wrote a shrewdly observant and trenchantly funny story of jealousy, hypocrisy and social acceptance in Victorian London. First-time screenwriter Howard Himelstein updates the story to the 1930's placing most of the action on the glamorous Amalfi Coast in Italy, and it certainly makes for a great excuse for a beautiful setting and period-authentic fashions.The film sticks with the basic outline of Wilde's play, as the plot focuses on Mrs. Stella Erlynne, a scandalous socialite who has been run out of New York for using wealthy, married men to allow her to live the high life to which she has become accustomed. In Italy, she latches onto young Robert Windermere, a successful American businessman who is still a blissful newlywed with his demure wife Meg in tow. About to celebrate her 21st birthday, Meg herself attracts the not entirely unwanted attentions of notorious playboy Lord Darlington, who discovers that Robert has been paying Mrs. Erlynne a generous allowance. Complications ensue until a surprise ending (at least a surprise for anyone who doesn't know the play) uncovers the true facts behind the payments. The brittle wit of Wilde's words remains intact, but the zestful spirit seems missing given the lack of an appropriate emotional context for Wilde's shrewd observations to resonate. Ultimately it all feels very civilized but too tepid to make the story relevant to a modern viewer.Casting is part of the problem. As Mrs. Erlynne, a skeletal Helen Hunt seems miscast despite her best efforts at being scintillating. Her appeal comes from her contemporary, down-to-earth sensibilities, so her portrayal of a predatory bon-vivant feels off-kilter, especially as her character shows moments of vulnerability. The omnipresent Scarlett Johansson looks right as Meg, but she also seems at sea with Wilde's dialogue and the character's evolution. Even so, Mark Umbers is comparatively lackluster as Robert. Faring better are Stephen Campbell Moore as Darlington (spewing my favorite Wilde line as he describes America as a society ""that's gone from barbarism to depravity without bothering to develop civilization in between"") and, in particular, Tom Wilkinson, who plays Mrs. Erlynne's not-so-love-blind suitor, Tuppy, with the panache that the rest of the cast seems missing. All the externals are fine - Ben Seresin's sun-dappled cinematography, John Bloomfield's fanciful costumes, Ben Scott's Mediterranean-feeling production design. However, it all comes down to Wilde's incisive wit, and the movie is worth seeing just to listen to that.",3,Oscar Wilde's Wit Scintillates Even As the Cast Wavers and the Context Falters,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2926,"['reservations', ""'m"", 'glad', 'film', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'next', 'month', 'US', 'theaters', 'already', 'saw', 'United', 'Airlines', 'flight', 'November', 'much', 'worthwhile', 'director', 'Mike', 'Barker', 'adaptation', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'classic', 'play', 'manners', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'trademark', 'cleverness', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'Wilde', 'wrote', 'shrewdly', 'observant', 'trenchantly', 'funny', 'story', 'jealousy', 'hypocrisy', 'social', 'acceptance', 'Victorian', 'London', 'First-time', 'screenwriter', 'Howard', 'Himelstein', 'story', '1930', 'placing', 'most', 'action', 'glamorous', 'Amalfi', 'Coast', 'Italy', 'certainly', 'great', 'excuse', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'period-authentic', 'fashions.The', 'film', 'sticks', 'basic', 'outline', 'Wilde', 'play', 'plot', 'Mrs.', 'Stella', 'Erlynne', 'scandalous', 'socialite', 'who', 'been', 'run', 'New', 'York', 'using', 'wealthy', 'married', 'men', 'allow', 'live', 'high', 'life', 'become', 'accustomed', 'Italy', 'young', 'Robert', 'Windermere', 'successful', 'American', 'businessman', 'who', 'still', 'blissful', 'newlywed', 'demure', 'wife', 'Meg', 'tow', 'celebrate', '21st', 'birthday', 'Meg', 'not', 'entirely', 'unwanted', 'attentions', 'notorious', 'playboy', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'who', 'Robert', 'been', 'paying', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'generous', 'allowance', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'surprise', 'ending', 'least', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'play', 'true', 'facts', 'payments', 'brittle', 'wit', 'Wilde', 'words', 'intact', 'zestful', 'spirit', 'missing', 'given', 'lack', 'appropriate', 'emotional', 'context', 'Wilde', 'shrewd', 'observations', 'resonate', 'Ultimately', 'feels', 'very', 'civilized', 'too', 'tepid', 'make', 'story', 'relevant', 'modern', 'viewer.Casting', 'part', 'problem', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'skeletal', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'miscast', 'best', 'efforts', 'being', 'scintillating', 'appeal', 'contemporary', 'down-to-earth', 'sensibilities', 'portrayal', 'predatory', 'bon-vivant', 'feels', 'off-kilter', 'especially', 'character', 'moments', 'vulnerability', 'omnipresent', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'right', 'Meg', 'also', 'sea', 'Wilde', 'dialogue', 'character', 'evolution', 'Even', 'so', 'Mark', 'Umbers', 'comparatively', 'lackluster', 'Robert', 'Faring', 'better', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'Darlington', 'spewing', 'favorite', 'Wilde', 'line', 'America', 'society', 'gone', 'barbarism', 'depravity', 'bothering', 'develop', 'civilization', 'particular', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'not-so-love-blind', 'suitor', 'Tuppy', 'panache', 'rest', 'cast', 'missing', 'externals', 'are', 'fine', 'Ben', 'Seresin', 'sun-dappled', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Bloomfield', 'fanciful', 'costumes', 'Ben', 'Scott', 'Mediterranean-feeling', 'production', 'design', 'However', 'down', 'Wilde', 'incisive', 'wit', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'listen']",N/A

The movie opens in New York City during the 30's and we see this gorgeous and self assured femme fatale no longer welcomed by society because of the danger she represents. The credit she once had, provided by the rich and famous is no longer available but she wants to move to new territory and is forced to sell her jewelry to have enough money to buy passage to travel to the Amalfi Coast, the region of Italy's coastline located south of Naples.The beautiful settings of Amalfi, Positano and Ravello make this movie a cinematographic wonder. The shots of this world renowned stretch of mountainous coastline are breathtaking and we could not help but want to visit the picturesque villages, the beautiful villas that cling to the cliffs as if designed to become part of a portrait.We get to walk with the actors through the streets of these fishing villages and we join them as they purchase their lunch from the fresh catch of the day. Mrs. Eflynne has apparently set her sight on a newly married Robert Windermere, played by Mark Umbers.Meg Windermere, played by Scarlett Johansson is portrayed as nave, completely in love with her husband and incapable of doing anything to jeopardize her marriage. But when her husband starts to visit Mrs. Eflynne at her villa the local gossips become convinced that they are involved in a torrid affair and they become the talk of the town.John Standing delivers an outstanding performance as Dumby, the high society wealthy Lord Darlington, twice-divorced and reluctant to ever marry again, and yet, he is so smitten by Mrs. Eflynne that he proposes matrimony to the ""American"" woman that every woman despises and every man admires.This is one of those few movies that took us by surprise as the plot twists and turns, and rather than revealing it to you, we simply recommend seeing it. If you have ever traveled through Italy, this movie will remind you of the great natural beauty of Amalfi, Ravello, Sorrento and Rome.

In this wholly entertaining and luxurious adaptation of his fine play 'Lady Windemere's Fan' screen writer Howard Himelstein and director Mike Barker have created a bright confection of film that is bubbling with sex, scandal, seduction, secrets, and all manner of romantic subterfuge. It is a winner all around.Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a lady of desires who has just fled the USA with debtors breathing down her voluptuous d&eacute;colletage: she has always made her way by courting and conquering married men and their bank accounts.  She flees to Amalfi where she encounters the Windemeres - dashing Robert (Mark Umbers) and his gorgeous but somewhat naive wife of one year Meg (Scarlett Johansson).  Mrs. Erlynne and Robert share a secret that is mistaken by all to be an affair: Meg the pure is simultaneously being seduced by Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore).  The townsfolk of Amalfi gossip and spy and plan at every occasion to bring light to the goings on of the naughty Mrs. Erlynne - with the exception of a twice divorced older gent Tuppy (Tom Wilkinson) who instead has his eye on Mrs. Erlynne as his perfect new mate.  The trail of cookie crumbs is left when Mrs. Erlynne advises Robert to buy his wife a fan - with all the history of seductive uses that holds.  That fan travels around the circles and is eventually the means by which the secrets are made clear and the misrepresented scandals are solved.The setting of Wilde's comedy has been updated very successfully to the 1930s and the costumes and extraordinary views of the insides and vistas of Amalfi are a fine marriage.  The actors are to the person excellent with Helen Hunt giving a fine portrayal of a character at first difficult to like (but she is a good woman!).  Scarlett Johansson once again proves that her dramatic skills are equal to her beauty and Tom Wilkinson, Milena Vukotic, and the entire cast toss Wilde's wonderful lines into the air like butterflies.  This is a very special film, one that touches the brain, the heart and the sense of humor in a most delectable manner. One wonders why on earth the critics panned it during the theatrical release.  I'm sure Wilde would have a fitting answer for that! Highly recommended.

In this movie, based on Oscar Wilde's play ""Lady Windermere's Fan"", she impressed me the way a fine wine carefully aged to perfection might.  Add to that Tom Wilkinson's best performance since ""The Governess"", good support from Scarlett Johansson, Stephen Campbell Moore, and Mark Umbers; and top it all off with costumes and sets which will transport one back to the 30s and there's the formula needed for a truly good movie.

For instance, Wilde's play takes place in the later part of the 19th century while ""A Good Woman"" takes place in the 1930's. But it is a timeless play and could even have been remade in today's time period.Helen Hunt plays the part of a scandulous woman who has ""been around the block"" and who has run out of wealthy married men to sustain her lifestyle in America. Her acting is very well done as is that of all the other characters.  Helen's character, sells what jewelry she has left, buys a new trouseau and heads to the Italian coast to mingle with the wealthy there in the hope of upgrading her situation.  Those she comes in involved with, make for an intriguing story.After seeing it on TCM, when it was in progress, I knew that I had to have it.  I am very happy that I purchased it and, if you are one who likes period pieces, with great costumes, beautiful color, actual Italian seaside locations and scenery, you will very much ejoy this dvd and its story.The resolution, sound and color, are superior.

What she did, in not revealing the secret of the play is VERY effective. It brings a tear to the eye. Don't try to turn her into a prostitute crashing into the Upper Class. This play was not the romp of ""Earnest"". In my opinion, Wilde closely identified with the character because of his ""notorious"" homosexual relationship with Lord Douglas. Is it his best play? NO.

I must admit, at this stage in my life, adventure (for me) is jumping into a movie that I know absolutely nothing about and hoping for the best.  Daring, huh?  Such is the case with the vaguely titled ""A Good Woman.""  I knew it starred Helen Hunt, Tom Wilkinson and Scarlett Johannson--and that was enough to lead me on the ""adventure"" of discovering this film.  Imagine my surprise, then, (about a third of the way through) when a character named Windermere was purchasing a fan for his wife--and I suddenly realized I was watching a strange modernization of Oscar Wilde's classic play aptly entitled ""Lady Windermere's Fan.""  I felt pretty foolish, I must admit--but I don't entirely blame myself.Instead of the claustrophobic drawing rooms in 1890's England, ""A Good Woman"" is fashioned in Italy of the 1930's (an odd choice considering the political climate at the time--which is conveniently never mentioned).  The Windermere's are now Americans.  And what was once Wilde's comedy of manners has become a rather stilted drama with occasional one-liners that fans of Wilde's works will recognize.  I certainly have no problem with re-imagining a classic work, such as this.  But ""A Good Woman"" keeps the storyline of ""Lady Windermere's Fan"" while jettisoning the elements that make it an effective social commentary.  The intimate settings of the play establish a world where gossip is an essential part of daily life, the wicked interactions are all anyone have to occupy their time.  By opening things up to the Italian countryside, this seems to be less relevant.  It's as if the primary characters are engaged in a different movie from the supporting players who make mockery of them.""A Good Woman"" tells the story of Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt), a seductress that has made a career of manipulating the egos of wealthy men.  After being chased from American society, she settles in Italy where her path crosses with a young aristocrat named Windermere and his bride (Johannson).  Windermere's relationship with Mrs. Erlynne sets the tongues wagging.  It's best not to reveal too much of the plot for those unfamiliar with the play--but again, the film's screenplay loses much of Wilde's language, flow, and intricate comedy.  Only the talented and British supporting players, led by the sublime Wilkinson, seem to be trying to maintain Wilde's spirit.Still, this is a handsome production.  But no amount of lush scenery and exquisite costuming can hide the film's truly fatal flaw.  No offense to Helen Hunt, or her fans, but her interpretation of Mrs. Erlynne leaves much to be desired.  With a stilted cadence to her speech and a pinched expression, Hunt never convinces us that she could be the irresistible creation that she needs to be.  Johannson is somewhat vacant in her role, as well, but that is better disguised by her character's naivet&eacute;.  It is Wilkinson, in particular, that completely saves this production.  With much needed humor and charm, ""A Good Woman"" is inexplicably salvaged by a man!  While this isn't terrible by any stretch, it's unlikely to send new viewers to seek out the works of Oscar Wilde--and that's a real disappointment.  KGHarris, 03/07.",3,"Wild About Wilde?

I can't imagine A Good Woman working in a setting like New York or London, but I don't have to. It's set in 1930's Amalfi, the perfect background for a story like this one. Professional mistress Mrs. Erlynne flees to Italy when too many wives are on to her at home. On the ship, she notices a newspaper photo of a young couple, and she knows exactly what her next move should be. The young wife is innocent and naive, and all sorts of innuendo and gossip go flying around Amalfi that season.This is a woman's picture, and Helen Hunt as the adventuress has never looked more beautiful.

But I didn't really enjoy this movie because the performances lacked a bit of snap and crackle.  I think it needed some kung-fu.Without spoiling the story for anyone, the premise of the movie is as follows:  Mrs Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a (slightly) older New York socialite with a reputation for ""preying"" on wealthy married men.  Forced to flee New York she sets of for the Amalfi coast with her sights set on the newly married Meg (Scarlett Johansson) and Robert (Mark Umbers).  She quickly strikes up a relationship with Robert which sets tongues wagging and he is suspected of providing her with an allowance and beginning an affair.Meanwhile: Meg attracts the attention of a playboy Lord who sees an opportunity to make his move, Mrs Erlynne attracts the attention of old Lord Tuppy and the gossip starts to take its toll on any number of relationships.Things come to a head at Meg's 21st birthday party when the motivations of the various players are revealed and some unexpected truths emerge.What lets this film down is the fact that not one character has any charisma and as a result there is none of the requisite spark between the characters that a story like this needs.  Meg and Robert seem dull.  I suspect that Scarlett Johansson was cast more for her visual qualities than any else; Mrs Erlynne is just not sexy enough or alluring enough to seem believable in the role of a vamp; the playboy Lord fails to make any real impact - and the whole thing is just a little bit too PG rated.  Or a little bit too proper perhaps.

Here is a lovely cast of carefully selected, talented actors and here is a motion picture every bit as filmic as anything yet done, re-set at the 1930 seaside village of Amalfi, Italy, a watering place for the rich in pre-Hitler Europe.The period is lovingly restored perhaps only in the ways of Italian craftsmen in costume, architecture, ambiance and even camera film tone.  This care extended to the performances by actors we all recognize and admire; Helen Hunt, here, surprisingly beautiful, Tom Wilkinson and Scarlett Johansson.The film was not really seen here although apparently released theatrically.  Why not is puzzling and why the critics did not like it while they go bonkers over junk is far beyond my ken.Fortunately I saw the entire movie on Comcast's On Demand completely free of breaks and commercials on my large Sony Bravia.  For two hours I was in heaven with my cup of coffee and a cinnamon-raisin bagel from Brueggers' downstairs.

For anyone who saw his play in the theatre, this film is visual disappointment in terms of costumes, jewelry, hair and mannerisms of the female characters.  Two main female leads Scarlet Johnasson and Helen Hunt are miscast.  It is almost as if their roles are reversed.  Johansson is too seductive to be cast as a prim young bride, while Hunt's thin lips and deep, severe facial lines make her even less appealing in her role of a seductress of men.  Wilde's smart snippets of wisdom make this film lively.  Although film was made in Italy, I wish there were more beautiful places showing in the film that could entice some true romantic emotions - but that is not the case.  Tom Wilkinson is great in portraying aging, wealthy man, somewhat pretending to be shallow and yet remaining irresistibly endearing.  The moral tale of how men can get away with being a playboy while women have to conform to a higher standards of a moral virtue is still true today.  I liked the line that Helen Hunt had where she says to a young woman:""Do you think that just because we got a right to vote that makes us equal to the standards of men?""

However, I didn't realize the source of the screen play until I heard the name ""Windemere"" and then ""Fan"", when everything came clear that this was the Wilde play brought to the screen. But only a so-so effort. I thought the lead characters were poorly cast.  This doesn't mean they were poor actors, it just means they were not convincing in the parts.  Helen Hunt is usually funny and clever but doesn't strike me as a seductress or a ""woman of the world"".  The best and most believeable actors were the supporting cast, who unfortunately mumbled some of the better lines.  The Oscar Wilde play was a comedy of manners and a social commentary on the English upper class, but alas this was largely missing in the movie.  In fact, the pace and crispness of Wilde's wit was subdued due to the slow pace of the film.  However, this was still a fun movie, beautifully filmed and costumed.

982309,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F3UAFC,Tsuyoshi,"[48, 58]","The film is titled `A Good Woman,' but it is actually filmed version of Oscar Wilde play `Lady Windermere's Fan.' Wilde's original, which was put on stage in 1892 and became the first `hit' for Wilde, was set in the drawing room of end-of-the-century England, but `A Good Woman' shifted the background to the Amalfi coast (South Italy) in the 1930s. The director is Mike Barker from England (`To Kill a King'), but some of the main characters' roles are played by American actors.Two women play the central roles in `A Good Woman.' One is Mrs. Erlynne, `a woman of experience' (Helen Hunt, cast against type) a seductive middle-aged woman from New York. Shunned by the aristocratic society, she still hopes to win the love of gentleman - a rich gentleman - and here in Italy, it seems, she has already attracted some of them. One of them is `Tuppy' (delightful Tom Wilkinson), who refuses to listen to the rumor about Erlynne.The other woman is Lady Windermere, `a woman of innocence' (Scarlett Johansson), who is newly married, and devotes herself to her husband. After arriving at this beautiful Italian resort, however, her husband Lord Windermere (Mark Umbers) seems to have got nervous about something, some secret he knows, which lady's man Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore) also happen to notice in his checkbook.The film retains the basic storyline of Wilde's original. There is a twist (as in the original) which might or might not surprise you. All in all the filmed version is successful in maintaining our interest in the story, which gets melodramatic especially in the second half. The changed location is not a bad thing to me (the `stagy' films are not my cup of tea), but the changed times are a different matter. The 1930s is, I m afraid, too modern a period to make the rigid social conventions of late Victorian convincing. The first part of the film is, I think, considerably weakened by the changed situation and lengthy introduction.Here is another complaint. As the film's title suggests, `A Good Woman' is more about the ladies than about the gentlemen. That is good. Consequently, however, unlike the original play two male roles Lord Darlington and Lord Windermere look less impressive than the ones you meet in the book. This is a problem because many of the witty lines of Wilde are uttered by Lord Darlington and his character as a flirt plays an important role in the second half of the play. He should be more attractive, hopefully devilishly charming.You may object to the casting of Ms. Hunt and Ms. Johansson. I find Helen Hunt's lady Windermere sexually seductive enough, but not really seductive enough to make her look like a social climber. Not that her acting is bad, but you may name a name or two of someone who could play the same role as good as, or perhaps better than, Helen Hunt.`A Good Woman' is easy on the eye with two beautiful leading ladies in gorgeous costumes, and fun to see with intelligent dialogues (and it is Oscar Wilde, the genius, so why not witty after all?) The original play's social satire is no longer compelling, now. But `A Good Woman' is light-hearted, maybe too light-hearted you might say, but is still sweet and pleasant.",4,(3.5 STARS) Decent Adaptaion of Oscar Wilde's 'Lady Windermere's Fan',1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3202,"['film', 'titled', 'Good', 'Woman', 'actually', 'filmed', 'version', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'play', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'Wilde', 'original', 'was', 'put', 'stage', '1892', 'became', 'first', 'hit', 'Wilde', 'was', 'set', 'drawing', 'room', 'end-of-the-century', 'England', 'Good', 'Woman', 'shifted', 'background', 'Amalfi', 'coast', 'South', 'Italy', '1930s', 'director', 'Mike', 'Barker', 'England', 'Kill', 'King', 'main', 'characters', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'American', 'actors.Two', 'women', 'play', 'central', 'roles', 'Good', 'Woman', 'One', 'Mrs.', 'Erlynne', 'woman', 'experience', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'cast', 'type', 'seductive', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'Shunned', 'aristocratic', 'society', 'still', 'win', 'love', 'gentleman', 'rich', 'gentleman', 'here', 'Italy', 'already', 'attracted', 'One', 'Tuppy', 'delightful', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'listen', 'rumor', 'Erlynne.The', 'other', 'woman', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'woman', 'innocence', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'newly', 'married', 'husband', 'arriving', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'resort', 'however', 'husband', 'Lord', 'Windermere', 'Mark', 'Umbers', 'have', 'got', 'nervous', 'something', 'secret', 'lady', 'man', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'also', 'happen', 'notice', 'checkbook.The', 'film', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Wilde', 'original', 'twist', 'original', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'surprise', 'filmed', 'version', 'successful', 'maintaining', 'interest', 'story', 'melodramatic', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'changed', 'location', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'stagy', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'changed', 'times', 'are', 'different', 'matter', '1930s', 'm', 'afraid', 'too', 'modern', 'period', 'make', 'rigid', 'social', 'conventions', 'late', 'Victorian', 'convincing', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'think', 'considerably', 'weakened', 'changed', 'situation', 'lengthy', 'introduction.Here', 'complaint', 'film', 'title', 'Good', 'Woman', 'more', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'good', 'Consequently', 'however', 'original', 'play', 'two', 'male', 'roles', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'Lord', 'Windermere', 'look', 'less', 'impressive', 'ones', 'meet', 'book', 'problem', 'many', 'witty', 'lines', 'Wilde', 'are', 'uttered', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'character', 'flirt', 'important', 'role', 'second', 'half', 'play', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'hopefully', 'devilishly', 'charming.You', 'may', 'object', 'casting', 'Ms.', 'Hunt', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'find', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'lady', 'Windermere', 'sexually', 'seductive', 'enough', 'not', 'really', 'seductive', 'enough', 'make', 'look', 'social', 'climber', 'Not', 'acting', 'bad', 'may', 'name', 'name', 'two', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'same', 'role', 'as', 'good', 'perhaps', 'better', 'Helen', 'Hunt.', 'Good', 'Woman', 'easy', 'eye', 'two', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'ladies', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'fun', 'see', 'intelligent', 'dialogues', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'genius', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'witty', 'original', 'play', 'social', 'satire', 'no', 'longer', 'compelling', 'now', 'Good', 'Woman', 'light-hearted', 'maybe', 'too', 'light-hearted', 'might', 'say', 'still', 'sweet', 'pleasant']",N/A
