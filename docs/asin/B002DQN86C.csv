After seeing it, I was really angry - at Turner Classic Movies. Why is it that I've been a regular viewer of this channel for years and never seen this real gem of a pre-war film? It deserves to be brought out and shown more often - as in more than once every two or three years.The film stars three of MGM's child stars at various points in their career. Freddy Bartholomew is about at the peak of his career, Mickey Rooney is only beginning what will be a decades long career, and Jackie Cooper is getting a little too old to play the lead in children's films. However, the three come together perfectly here.Freddy Bartholomew plays Claude Pierce, the son of a divorced couple. The father is an aspiring architect living in a rough neighborhood, the mother is a society swell who looked upon her husband's career as an annoying hobby that took away time from their society hob-nobbing on her money - thus the divorce. The two have joint custody of Claude but very different lives. Half the year Claude is the sheltered citizen of the world with his mother, but now it is his father's turn. He thus attends public school and quickly runs afoul of Buck Murphy (Jackie Cooper) and Gig Stevens (Mickey Rooney). Claude is fascinated with these guys, even if they don't like him. He quickly learns how to earn their tolerance even if he doesn't really have their friendship.Shortly after Claude's arrival Gig's father is executed for a murder he commited. Gig's mission in life now is to get enough money together to buy a headstone for his father's grave. However, even the illegal endeavors that Gig and Buck come up with can't yield enough money. Oddly, it is Claude that comes up with a single caper that will produce enough money for the coveted headstone. For awhile Buck and Gig now consider Claude one of them, until the three are hauled into juvenile court for selling stolen goods and it turns out that Claude's caper wasn't as illegal as he would have the other boys think.Mainly a picture from a kid's point of view, this film does have some excellent performances from the supporting adults. Ian Hunter, who I always regarded as a bit of a prison sentence for Kay Francis because he was so often and so badly teamed with her, is perfect as Claude's dad. It would be easy for him to pamper and shelter Claude, but he realizes that Claude must learn to get along with all types of people in life. However, that doesn't mean he isn't always there with advice and a shoulder when needed. Then there is Peggy Conklin as Gig's aunt who has taken the easy way out of the tenement life that her sister and nephew are stuck in. It's never stated exactly what she is doing to pay for her high-rise lifestyle, but the insinuation is that she is a kept woman. Of course, in MGM family film tradition style, she decides to end this way of life for herself before the film ends. We also see the beginnings of what looks like a romance between herself and Claude's father.Highly recommended for fans of MGM's pre-war fare. This particular film comes on DVD-R and has not been specifically restored for this release. However, I found both the audio and video quality excellent.",5,An unknown gem of a film,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,3314,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'showed', 'up', 'sale', 'Warner', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'chance', 'seeing', 'was', 'really', 'angry', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'Why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'regular', 'viewer', 'channel', 'years', 'never', 'seen', 'real', 'gem', 'pre-war', 'film', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'shown', 'more', 'often', 'more', 'once', 'two', 'three', 'years.The', 'film', 'stars', 'three', 'MGM', 'child', 'stars', 'various', 'points', 'career', 'Freddy', 'Bartholomew', 'about', 'peak', 'career', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'only', 'beginning', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'decades', 'long', 'career', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'getting', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'lead', 'children', 'films', 'However', 'three', 'come', 'together', 'perfectly', 'here.Freddy', 'Bartholomew', 'plays', 'Claude', 'Pierce', 'son', 'divorced', 'couple', 'father', 'aspiring', 'architect', 'living', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'mother', 'society', 'swell', 'who', 'looked', 'husband', 'career', 'annoying', 'hobby', 'took', 'away', 'time', 'society', 'hob-nobbing', 'money', 'thus', 'divorce', 'two', 'have', 'joint', 'custody', 'Claude', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'year', 'Claude', 'sheltered', 'citizen', 'world', 'mother', 'now', 'father', 'turn', 'thus', 'public', 'school', 'quickly', 'afoul', 'Buck', 'Murphy', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'Gig', 'Stevens', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Claude', 'fascinated', 'guys', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'quickly', 'how', 'earn', 'tolerance', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'friendship.Shortly', 'Claude', 'arrival', 'Gig', 'father', 'executed', 'murder', 'commited', 'Gig', 'mission', 'life', 'now', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'together', 'buy', 'headstone', 'father', 'grave', 'However', 'even', 'illegal', 'endeavors', 'Gig', 'Buck', 'come', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yield', 'enough', 'money', 'Oddly', 'Claude', 'up', 'single', 'caper', 'will', 'produce', 'enough', 'money', 'coveted', 'headstone', 'awhile', 'Buck', 'Gig', 'now', 'consider', 'Claude', 'one', 'three', 'are', 'hauled', 'juvenile', 'court', 'selling', 'stolen', 'goods', 'out', 'Claude', 'caper', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'illegal', 'would', 'have', 'other', 'boys', 'think.Mainly', 'picture', 'kid', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'have', 'excellent', 'performances', 'supporting', 'adults', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'who', 'always', 'regarded', 'bit', 'prison', 'sentence', 'Kay', 'Francis', 'was', 'so', 'often', 'so', 'badly', 'teamed', 'perfect', 'Claude', 'dad', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'pamper', 'shelter', 'Claude', 'Claude', 'must', 'learn', 'get', 'types', 'people', 'life', 'However', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'always', 'advice', 'shoulder', 'when', 'needed', 'Then', 'Peggy', 'Conklin', 'Gig', 'aunt', 'who', 'taken', 'easy', 'way', 'tenement', 'life', 'sister', 'nephew', 'are', 'stuck', 'never', 'stated', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'pay', 'high-rise', 'lifestyle', 'insinuation', 'kept', 'woman', 'course', 'MGM', 'family', 'film', 'tradition', 'style', 'end', 'way', 'life', 'film', 'also', 'see', 'beginnings', 'what', 'romance', 'herself', 'Claude', 'father.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'MGM', 'pre-war', 'fare', 'particular', 'film', 'DVD-R', 'not', 'been', 'specifically', 'restored', 'release', 'However', 'found', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent']",The Devil is a Sissy
1263944,A23HLET8WYJ7UA,B002DQN86C,Eve Callaway,"[2, 2]","Claude Pierce (Freddie Bartholomew) is the young son of divorced parents living in very different parts of New York City. His father is a kind, gentle, understanding man who is very supportive of his son, giving him what he never got from his ex-wife, acceptance of him as the very one he is, a sensitive, artistic man who wants to be an architect. The mother is an arrogant, bossy socialite from a very wealthy family who wanted her ex to focus on having a good time, not making a contribution to society. In an interesting twist I had not realized was even possible in the 1930's, Claude's parents have joint custody, with the father getting Claude six months and the mother six months. When with his mother, he leads a very cushy, protected existence with an excellent education at a private school that has allowed him to become fluent in French. In contrast, his father makes no attempt to protect Claude from the rough neighborhood he lives in.Two of the toughs Claude runs into are Buck (Jackie Cooper) and Gig (Mickey Rooney. Gig's father is executed as a criminal, and Gig goes to desperate measures to earn $80--a huge amount of money at the time--to buy his father a fancy tombstone. In spite of Buck and Gig pushing him around, plucky Claude goes to great lengths to keep them out of trouble and get Gig the tombstone he wants so desperately. But in spite of Claude's best efforts, the three of them land in one big mess after another.This was the first time I've actually watched Freddie Bartholomew in a film, though he is so famous I had certainly heard of him. I can see why people were crazy about him. He was absolutely adorable, and the character he plays in this film is irresistible. No matter how he is treated, he never gives up, and in spite of constantly shadowing the older boys Buck and Gig, he never comes off as pathetic. Quite the opposite.The film is a bit preachy, which is not surprising for the times. And what passes for juvenile delinquency seems laughably tame compared to today's world (or even what probably existed on the streets in those days). Nevertheless, the film is definitely worth it to see the fine performances of three outstanding child actors of the day.This is G-rated fare suitable for all ages.",4,"A great opportunity to watch three famous, talented, male child stars on stage together",1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2249,"['Claude', 'Pierce', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'young', 'son', 'divorced', 'parents', 'living', 'very', 'different', 'parts', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'father', 'kind', 'gentle', 'understanding', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'supportive', 'son', 'giving', 'what', 'never', 'got', 'ex-wife', 'acceptance', 'very', 'one', 'sensitive', 'artistic', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'architect', 'mother', 'arrogant', 'bossy', 'socialite', 'very', 'wealthy', 'family', 'who', 'wanted', 'ex', 'focus', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'making', 'contribution', 'society', 'interesting', 'twist', 'had', 'not', 'realized', 'was', 'even', 'possible', '1930', 'Claude', 'parents', 'have', 'joint', 'custody', 'father', 'getting', 'Claude', 'six', 'months', 'mother', 'six', 'months', 'When', 'mother', 'very', 'cushy', 'protected', 'existence', 'excellent', 'education', 'private', 'school', 'allowed', 'become', 'fluent', 'French', 'contrast', 'father', 'attempt', 'protect', 'Claude', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'in.Two', 'toughs', 'Claude', 'are', 'Buck', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'Gig', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Gig', 'father', 'executed', 'criminal', 'Gig', 'desperate', 'measures', 'earn', '80', 'huge', 'amount', 'money', 'time', 'buy', 'father', 'fancy', 'tombstone', 'spite', 'Buck', 'Gig', 'pushing', 'around', 'plucky', 'Claude', 'great', 'lengths', 'keep', 'trouble', 'get', 'Gig', 'tombstone', 'so', 'desperately', 'spite', 'Claude', 'best', 'efforts', 'three', 'land', 'one', 'big', 'mess', 'another.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'watched', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'film', 'so', 'famous', 'had', 'certainly', 'heard', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'crazy', 'was', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'character', 'film', 'irresistible', 'matter', 'how', 'treated', 'never', 'up', 'spite', 'constantly', 'shadowing', 'older', 'boys', 'Buck', 'Gig', 'never', 'off', 'pathetic', 'opposite.The', 'film', 'bit', 'preachy', 'not', 'surprising', 'times', 'what', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'laughably', 'tame', 'compared', 'today', 'world', 'even', 'what', 'probably', 'existed', 'streets', 'days', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'see', 'fine', 'performances', 'three', 'outstanding', 'child', 'actors', 'day.This', 'G-rated', 'fare', 'suitable', 'ages']",The Devil is a Sissy
