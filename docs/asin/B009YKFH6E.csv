1603157,A24PTVSZSM8968,B009YKFH6E,Amazon Customer,"[15, 17]","The premise of this film is that a very rich Italian businessman promises his dying father he will spend one month away from home with no money. During the month, the former playboy meets the widow of an Army veteran and falls in love. The story is a fairly standard rich boy meets poor girl who doesn't know he's rich. There are a number of interesting characters in the movie and most of the scenes are fairly family-friendly. That being said, there is very poor character and plot development. Most of the things you would hope to see develop over the course of the movie are sort of simply taken for granted and a number of story lines either end up having nothing to do with the story in the end or sort of fall apart. I felt like I could see the chemistry between the main characters but there was little in the actual story to suggest how they could have ended up together as they did. They were in love after two hours of their first date and were soul mates within a week or two. As nice as the movie is, it could have been so much more. It's a watchable, if not memorable movie, but with a little better character development, it could have been a real gem.",3,"Nice idea, poorly developed",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1167,"['premise', 'film', 'very', 'rich', 'Italian', 'businessman', 'dying', 'father', 'will', 'spend', 'one', 'month', 'away', 'home', 'money', 'month', 'former', 'playboy', 'widow', 'Army', 'veteran', 'love', 'story', 'fairly', 'standard', 'rich', 'boy', 'meets', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'rich', 'are', 'number', 'interesting', 'characters', 'movie', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'family-friendly', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'poor', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'Most', 'things', 'would', 'hope', 'see', 'develop', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'sort', 'simply', 'taken', 'granted', 'number', 'story', 'lines', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'end', 'sort', 'fall', 'apart', 'felt', 'could', 'see', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'little', 'actual', 'story', 'suggest', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'did', 'were', 'love', 'two', 'hours', 'first', 'date', 'were', 'soul', 'mates', 'week', 'two', 'nice', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'watchable', 'not', 'memorable', 'movie', 'little', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'gem']",A Secret Promise
