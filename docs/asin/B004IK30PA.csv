1410839,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B004IK30PA,Andrea Polk,"[5, 6]","I liked the comedic premise of this movie: male best friend who yearns to be more gets drunk and makes the 'switch' to become his female best friend's sperm donor, without her knowing about it. Years later when he meets her kid and puts the drunken night's puzzle pieces together he knows he must tell his friend before she decides to spend her life with another man.What works in this film for me is Jason Bateman's portrayal of the BFF.  No one is good enough for him because he knows who he wants, but is afraid to say so and risk losing the friendship.  His comedic timing is good and he makes it believable.  His exchanges with his boss, played by Jeff Goldblume, are great.  He also works really well with the boy(s) who play the son. Without these good points, the movie wouldn't be a 'like' for me.What doesn't work is the tempo of the movie and Jennifer Aniston's performance. The tempo seemed to be OK initially, but then tended to drag.  It picked up with some laughs and then again, dragged. As for Aniston, I like her, but I find that one movie role seems to be pretty much like the next as far as her acting range - it's very limited.  I wanted to be but wasn't sold on her desire to get pregnant, her affection for anyone around her, and even less sold in scenes where she was 'mothering'.  For me, her performance was sort of like watching someone paint a wall white.  Nothing bad, just nothing interesting.  A 'C-' performance overall for her.It's a pleasant, but not noteworthy movie.

1410840,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004IK30PA,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I know that I shouldn't like this film as much as I do, considering the clich&eacute;s and the plot holes that seem to infest certain areas of the script, and yet I can't help but kind of love this movie.  Jennifer Aniston is kind of like Jennifer Lopez to me; not entirely talented and yet totally adorable and so every movie they do, whether it's terrible or not, is watchable thanks to them.  But, with `The Switch' it really isn't about Jennifer Aniston at all.  Sure, she is the big name that drew the most people to the theater, but it is the supporting cast that really brings this film to life; most notably Jason Bateman and that little adorable kid named Thomas Robinson.`The Switch' tells the story of Kassie; a single business woman who dreams of having a child but knows that her time is ticking away from her.  Her best friend is Wally, a neurotic yet sincerely concerned man who has been harboring feelings for Kassie for years, but has always been too afraid to do anything about them.  When Kassie decides to have a child via sperm donor, Wally is immediately concerned, and quite vocal about it to the point where it strains their friendship.  Eventually though, Kassie settles on a donor, but a drunken snafu leads Wally's `ingredient' into Kassie's uterus and out comes Sebastian.  The problem is that Wally was so drunk he blacked out and doesn't remember that fateful `switch'.  On top of that, Kassie moves away to `better raise Sebastian' and so Wally doesn't get to see her or his `son' for nearly six years.  When Kassie moves back to the city, Sebastian is thrust into Wally's life and, while he is initially cold shouldered to the boy, there is just something about that little wonder that fills Wally's heart.Of course, there are your standard Hollywood `curveballs' that get tossed into the plot (some of them making more sense than others), but it is the solid performances of Bateman and Robinson that truly elevate this film.Jason Bateman is one of those actors I wish big things for.  He's a lot like Paul Rudd to me; a cute and likable actor who brandishes his own breed of `funny' with authenticity and originality and can handle making his characters `his own' with ease.  Bateman is an easy standout in nearly all of his films.  What he does here is something special, because those blue eyes melt away whenever he's looking at young Thomas Robinson (that kids is something special in himself) and it adds this sincerity; this paternal love that is hard to `fake'.  Sure, at moments `The Switch' feels like a cheaper version of `About a Boy', and it never quite manages to be `that great', but the similarities to that film serve more as a compliment than anything else.The rest of the cast shines as well; especially Juliette Lewis and Jeff Goldblum; both serving up `funny sidekick' performances.In the end, `The Switch' is far better than I expected it to be.  I love it more than I should and yet I'm not ashamed to love it this much.  While I found the sub-plot concerning Roland, the assumed donor, to be halfbaked and somewhat farfetched, it didn't truly dampen my feelings for the film.  The film just hits too many `right notes', and while it certainly delves into the schmaltzy manipulative side of tear-jerking in certain scenes (""you can have this one"") it pulls it off thanks to the pure believability of Bateman and Robinson's performances.",4,For the love of the kid...,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,3392,"['know', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'considering', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'seem', 'infest', 'certain', 'areas', 'script', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'kind', 'love', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'kind', 'like', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'not', 'entirely', 'talented', 'yet', 'totally', 'adorable', 'so', 'movie', 'do', 'terrible', 'not', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'Switch', 'really', ""n't"", 'about', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Sure', 'big', 'name', 'drew', 'most', 'people', 'theater', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'film', 'life', 'most', 'notably', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'little', 'adorable', 'kid', 'named', 'Thomas', 'Robinson.', 'Switch', 'story', 'Kassie', 'single', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'child', 'time', 'ticking', 'away', 'best', 'friend', 'Wally', 'neurotic', 'yet', 'sincerely', 'concerned', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'harboring', 'feelings', 'Kassie', 'years', 'always', 'been', 'too', 'afraid', 'do', 'anything', 'When', 'Kassie', 'have', 'child', 'sperm', 'donor', 'Wally', 'immediately', 'concerned', 'quite', 'vocal', 'point', 'where', 'friendship', 'Eventually', 'Kassie', 'donor', 'drunken', 'snafu', 'Wally', 'ingredient', 'Kassie', 'uterus', 'Sebastian', 'problem', 'Wally', 'was', 'so', 'drunk', 'blacked', 'out', ""n't"", 'remember', 'fateful', 'switch', 'top', 'Kassie', 'away', 'better', 'raise', 'Sebastian', 'so', 'Wally', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'son', 'nearly', 'six', 'years', 'When', 'Kassie', 'back', 'city', 'Sebastian', 'thrust', 'Wally', 'life', 'initially', 'cold', 'shouldered', 'boy', 'just', 'something', 'little', 'wonder', 'Wally', 'heart.Of', 'course', 'are', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'curveballs', 'get', 'tossed', 'plot', 'making', 'more', 'sense', 'others', 'solid', 'performances', 'Bateman', 'Robinson', 'truly', 'elevate', 'film.Jason', 'Bateman', 'one', 'actors', 'wish', 'big', 'things', 'lot', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'cute', 'likable', 'actor', 'who', 'own', 'breed', 'funny', 'authenticity', 'originality', 'can', 'handle', 'making', 'characters', 'own', 'ease', 'Bateman', 'easy', 'standout', 'nearly', 'films', 'What', 'here', 'something', 'special', 'blue', 'eyes', 'melt', 'away', 'looking', 'young', 'Thomas', 'Robinson', 'kids', 'something', 'special', 'sincerity', 'paternal', 'love', 'hard', 'fake', 'Sure', 'moments', 'Switch', 'feels', 'cheaper', 'version', 'Boy', 'never', 'quite', 'be', 'great', 'similarities', 'film', 'serve', 'more', 'compliment', 'anything', 'else.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'shines', 'well', 'especially', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'serving', 'up', 'funny', 'sidekick', 'end', 'Switch', 'far', 'better', 'expected', 'be', 'love', 'more', 'should', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'love', 'much', 'found', 'sub-plot', 'concerning', 'Roland', 'assumed', 'donor', 'be', 'halfbaked', 'somewhat', 'farfetched', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'dampen', 'feelings', 'film', 'film', 'just', 'hits', 'too', 'many', 'right', 'notes', 'certainly', 'schmaltzy', 'manipulative', 'side', 'tear-jerking', 'certain', 'scenes', 'can', 'have', 'one', 'off', 'thanks', 'pure', 'believability', 'Bateman', 'Robinson', 'performances']",The Switch

1410845,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B004IK30PA,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[4, 4]","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be some slapstick comedy. Instead I got rather a drama with light elements. It is billed as a romance but it seems from the first reel the main characters are already in love or love each other, but just aren't willing to admit it to each other.  It is as if we come in at the middle of a relationship.  As as been mentioned Kassie has a shy and neurotic friend Wally. She decides to have a baby alone and not with him -- although Kassie doesn't seem to have a real problem with Wally, just again, isn't going to ask. Kassie seems to want Wally to ""try harder stupid"" and Wally seems determined not to do so. She continues to push forward and Wally ends up switching the donor's sample with his. Wally is drunk so he doesn't really remember doing this. Kassie moves away, again seemingly hoping Wally will say, I will go too, but he doesn't. Wally just won't put himself out there no matter what. Finally Kassie comes back to New York with her 6 year old.Wally is stunned to find her son, Sebastian, shares a lot of his traits. Sebastian is neurotic, looks like Wally, and seems to like him too. Sebastian does not take to the man everyone thinks is his father -- the sperm donor.  Wally finally remembers what he did and that Sebastian is his son and spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out how to tell Kassie. This journey is not a slapstick one. Wally, finally has to, and wants to, grow up. While his journey here has some funny moments, they are mostly dramatic and touching. The actor that plays Sebastian was just wonderful and you really buy Wally's transformation and growing love for his son.  Wally's love for Kassie wasn't enough for him to put himself out there but the love of his son was. I think if you go into this thinking it is going to be like ""just go with it"" or some other Jennifer Aniston films you will be disappointed.

I find it ironic that she became such a big star,actually I never watched thatmany shows when younger,and for some reason the character she played stuck out in my mind, tv is full of veryattractive and very talented actresses,star's have a special quality and this actress seems to have many fans.Anyways they do discuss she liked the script...and i think they mentioned that since perhaps they thought shewouldnt. It is a very good movie,modern ideas,very good dialogue,snappy interactions and moves breezily along.There are many scenes which stick out in my mind as quite original and well done. However just when you thinkthe movie is going to center on the adult characters a child moves in with all kinds of insurmountable childlike problems which do not overwhelm the movie since it is very well written. A good screenwriter. These kindsof movies are the hardest to do with all kinds of info on psychology which the more alert viewer may pick up.We hand it to the star for having made this film...bringing attention to these childlike issues..she has manygood scenes as well..for some reasons any film she's in you tend to recall her scenes.

That truly is the basic general plot but it is the emotions, love and caring between certain characters that truly hold this film together.  Jennifer Aniston keeps trying to find her place as a true romantic film star but again though she is pefectly lovely and quite fine here the film belongs to another.  Jason Bateman is the one who brings the depth, warmth and compassion to this film.  Aniston is Kassie, the woman wanting to have a baby.  Bateman is Wally, her neurotic best friend who has been in love with her for years.  Sadly he cannot speak truly of his feelings and suffers silently as Kassie goes through the process of the insemination.  Through certain mishaps that seem ridiculous but as portrayed in the film are truly believable, Wally changes the sperm of the actual donor with his own.  Kassie moves away and the film moves ahead 7 years when she returns to New York with her son Sebastian, superbly played by Thomas Robinson.It is here as Sebastian and Wally form their relationship that the film finds its true meaning and heart and soul.  Bateman is mezmerizing in his performance as he fully embodies the changes his character goes through as he falls head over heels for this young boy.  So yes the plot is about insemination and switched sperm but it rings true instead as a film about relationships  and characters we believe in and care about.  Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Wilson add the appropriate pieces to their characters and both have some fine moments.  Again, Aniston is fine but at the end comes across as the least developed character.  This film belongs to Bateman and Robinson as a father and son you will feel for, root for and laugh and cry with.  Highly recommend this film and want more such roles for Bateman.

I can think of a much better plot that would have really pulled me in and got me contemplating all the implications his drunken bathroom decision would bring. What about if he realizes what he did right after she reveals she's pregnant, struggles briefly but then tells her and we spend the rest of the movie fleshing out all the emotions the two of them would be having about this. (I mean we have all seen the countless movies and know she will not get married to the other guy...right?...we don't even need the other guy at all) Maybe she gets mad and moves away for a while. Maybe not 7 years but a year or so. Then starts thinking, maybe they start talking again, and she moves back to town so their son can be closer to his father (and we have all the scenes where father and son interact alone) but they still don't get back together because after all what he did was rather terrible though unintentional (he was blacked out drunk after all)(not to excuse it). Finally a few more years pass and he grows up and learns how to better convey his feelings for her and shows how good a father he is to their child. Then they end the movie with the two showing signs that they are starting to finally come together in a relationship that hopefully will lead to marriage but we don't know because the movie ends leaving us hoping they develop into a strong family.

Far nicer and sweeter than I expected, you may not LOVE this movie, but if it doesn't make you smile, there is something wrong with you.Jennifer Aniston plays Kassie, a woman who is tired of waiting on a seemingly non-existent Mr. Right to start a family. She decides to find a donor who is tall and has a good sense of humor (traits not possessed by her best friend, the neurotic Wally (Jason Bateman)) and hold a very special gathering for friends and family. At this ""insemination party"", a very drunk Wally decides to 'switch' her donor's ingredient for his own, thus secretly hijacking her pregnancy. Fast-forward seven years and we meet Sebastian, Kassie's child, who is becoming more and more like his real father Wally by the day.There is an underlying sad tension building all throughout the movie as we wait for the moment when Wally will put two and two together and remember what he did that fateful night, and then when he must reveal this dirty secret to Kassie. My guess is this is why some critics didn't like it. If you go into it with a better perspective though, it is more about how Wally decides he is ready to commit to this young child as a father, and how he is a better person for it, regardless of how everything ends up. A couple of scenes are downright touching, and the ending, while somewhat rushed and flawed, didn't ruin the story.

1410900,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004IK30PA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 7]","Back in 200, American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and short story writer Jeffrey Eugenides (""The Virgin Suicides"", ""Middlesex"") wrote a story titled ""Baster"" about one who would try to get pregnant via insemination and eventually ""Baster"" was given a film adaptation courtesy of Allan Loeb (""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"", ""21', ""Things We Lost in the Fire"") and directed by creative duo Josh Gordon and Will Speck (""Blades of Glory"", ""Cavemen"").The name would change to ""The Switch"" after post-production and would be released in August 2010 and earning  $49 million in the box office.""The Switch"" revolves around two best friends.  Neurotic Wally Mars (played by Jason Bateman) is always there to give his good friend Kassie Larson (played by Jennifer Aniston) advice.  But for Kassie, she feels that she is getting older and now wants to have a baby. Wally, with his neurotic way of thinking and tends to make noises when he eats, is not comfortable with Kassie choosing to get pregnant (via insemination) and expresses his feelings about it.Wally is against it and Kassie said that she will do it on her own if she can't get her best friend to support her decision.  Wally's co-worker, Leonard (played by Jeff Goldblum), insists that the two are like a couple and pretty much supports his friend when he talks about his problems with Kassie.As Kassie looks for a man suitable to become a donor, Wally is not so accepting of her choices but she eventually finds a sperm donor in Roland (played by Patrick Lewis), a married man who is an assistant professor at Columbia University.  He is only doing it for the money that will go towards he and his wife.Kassie organizes an ""insemination"" party and while Wally is usually critical towards Kassie, he knows that she is deadset in having a baby.  But Kassie's good friend Debbie (played by Juliette Lewis) doesn't like how Wally is neurotic and always in a mood, so she gives Wally an herbal pill to take.  Both don't really get along but makes a deal that if he takes the pill, she will not be near him.  So, he takes the herbal pill and when he mixes it up with alcohol, he becomes extremely drunk.While going to the bathroom, Wally finds Roland's sperm cup which will be used for the insemination.  But being drunk, he accidentally spills it in the sink.  He comes up with an idea to replace the sperm with his and uses a New York Magazine with Dianne Sawyer on the cover to get the job done.The next morning, Leonard tells him that he came to his apartment so drunk and puking everywhere and talking about Vikings and Dianne Sawyer.  But had no idea what he meant.  Wally has no recollection of what took place that night as Kassie's party.The next time he meets with Kassie, she tells him that she is pregnant and because she wants the child too live in an area suitable for children and not in New York City, so she moves to another state.Fast forward six years later and we see that Leonard is still the same, still neurotic and not doing so well with the women that he is dating.  Fortunately, he receives a call from Kassie and that she and her six-year-old son Sebastian (played by Thomas Robinson) will be moving to New York.  Excited that his friend is coming back to the city, they agree to meet at a restaurant.When the two actually meet, Wally meets the precocious yet neurotic Sebastian and immediately he starts talking about ecology and various words he has learned from Web MD and he has a habit of collecting picture frames.  Shocked by how her son is acting, Kassie asks Wally to do her a favor by watching Sebastian as she talks to a teacher in getting him enrolled at school.So, Wally takes Sebastian to the aquarium and park and starts to learn certain things about Sebastian's behavior that remind him of himself.  While riding in the bus, a woman talks about how they look like each other but Wally tells her that he is not his kid.  She tells him that the boy is like his miniature version of himself.Meanwhile, Kassie has wanted Sebastian to know his father and reunites with the sperm donor Roland, who is now divorced and the two end up eventually seeing each other.As for Wally, he starts to worry that Sebastian may be his.  As he tries to piece things together of that night at Kassie's insemination party, Leonard tells him all the things he told him that night and eventually Wally realizes that he hijacked Kassie's insemination by switching out Roland's sperm with his own.Knowing he needs to tell Kassie the truth but will he be able to...now that she is together with Roland?VIDEO:""The Switch"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Overall, picture quality is quite vibrant.  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep but only one time where I did notice a bit of banding when there was a lot of red light on Bateman's face.  But other than that, I didn't see any other problems with the video.If anything, the smartest thing that the producers and directors did was to showcase New York City in a traditional '70s and '80s sense by shooting in the city and showcasing the city.  Cinematographer Jess Hall (""Hot Fuzz"", ""Brideshead Revisited"") did a fine job in capturing the look and feel of New York and also capturing the living spaces of both protagonists.But overall, picture quality for ""The Switch"" is very good.  You do see how blue Jennifer Aniston's eyes are, closeups that do show skin pores and colors during scenes that showcases vibrancy.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Switch"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  For the most part, this film is dialogue-driven.  You will hear occasional ambiance of the various crowd scenes through the surround channels but pretty much, this film is front and center-channel driven.  Dialogue is crystal clearSubtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Switch"" comes with the following special features:* The Switch Conceived - (14:32) A making-of featurette featuring the directors, producers, writer and cast of ""The Switch"".

Bateman does a good job at playing the neurotic and Aniston's character shows a woman who feels that she is a woman that is getting older and needs to have a child and then later on, feeling that she needs a man in her life, also to be a father for her son.Both characters do a convincing job but I often struggled if these two talents actually had chemistry.  I also struggled with the utilization of the supporting cast.  While Patrick Wilson did a fine job in playing the character of Roland,  it was interesting to see Jeff Goldblum in a more passive performance and not quite sure if Bateman and Goldblum had chemistry onscreen to showcase that they are good buddies.  Especially Aniston's character and Juliette Lewis' character who seemed more hippy and party-like, the opposite of the more reserved character of Kassie played by Aniston.  But both Goldblum and Lewis do deliver a few hilarious lines throughout the film.So, chemistry-wise, the characters and the overall chemistry didn't seem smooth but it does work.  If anything, there are two things that stand out for me in ""The Switch"".  One is the writing by Allan Loeb and creating this relationship between Wally and Sebastian.  The funny thing is I know kids like Sebastian, neurotic, OCD and are quite different, so in some ways, it was hilarious for me to watch this film and just enjoying the overall relationship between the two as it develops throughout the film.  To be truthful, I found it more enjoyable to watch the father/son scenes vs. the adult scenes in this film.The scene in which Sebastian explains about the picture frames and keeping the photo inserts still in the frames was quite touching and I felt both Bateman and young Thomas Robinson had the onscreen chemistry for the entire film.The other positive for me about this film is how the filmmakers strived to incorporate New York City into the film and I thought that going that extra mile to shoot in New York and show as much of it as possible was very cool!As for the Blu-ray, I wished there was audio commentary but for the most part, it was good to have the various featurettes on the making of the film, deleted scenes and of course, bloopers.Overall, ""The Switch"" is a charming, heartwarming romantic comedy.  Sure, it is contrived and easily predictable and while it may not be on the list of top romantic comedy films of all time, I was entertained by the film and enjoyed it quite a bit. If you're looking for a fun romantic comedy, don't hesitate in giving ""The Switch"" a chance.",3,"Heartwarming and charming, ""The Switch"" may be a contrived and predictable but I was definitely

1410901,AU32ZJ0LGMBSA,B004IK30PA,"dgdbear ""David""","[1, 2]","I'm mostly one of those guys who when he sees a rom-com with Aniston in it, I usually don't even bother watching. But since this one had Bateman, who I like as an actor, and had a good supporting cast with some funny clips and odd presence, I couldn't resist waiting for it to come into my job for checkout. Thsi is very by the formula and predictable, but good performances and a very adorable Sebastian will win you over and make this one stand out from some recent rom-coms, ie 'Life as We Know It. On a side note, the power in my neighborhood went out for 2 hours during playback an hour in, so I felt disengaged by the time I finished watching, but before that, I felt really connected and the Bateman-Sebastian scenes were very touching.This is an overall good Blu-ray release with fine detail and good colors, although the whole movie has a whole desaturated look to it, but I can only guess that's director's intention, so no foul.

As he displayed consistently onArrested Development, the actor's dry delivery and slyly observant manner are a perfect match for Wally Mars, the comically cynical equities analyst he plays in this sadly overlooked 2010 romantic comedy co-directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon (who much to my surprise, helmed the Will Ferrell figure-skating comedy,Blades of Glory). Although he is the true protagonist of the story, the movie was marketed as a Jennifer Aniston vehicle. She plays rising TV producer Kassie Larson, his long-ago girlfriend who has relegated him to the ""friend zone"" even though he obviously hasn't gotten over her.Written with verve by Allen Loeb (who also co-wrote Aniston's other 2010 movie, the Adam Sandler starrer,Just Go With It), the story revolves around Kassie's ticking biological clock. In a seven-years-back flashback, she is seen deliberately bypassing Wally as a possible sperm donor in favor of a more predictable candidate, Roland, a struggling associate professor at Columbia, who happens to be married and drop-dead handsome. At an ""insemination"" party, Wally gets wasted and drops the carelessly placed vial of Roland's semen down the bathroom sink. This leaves Wally no choice but to replace the sample himself. Kassie eventually becomes pregnant and moves back home to Minnesota. Flash forward to the present, and Kassie returns to Manhattan with her six-year-old son Sebastian in tow. The fact that Sebastian acts like a miniature version of Wally gets completely past Kassie but not Wally who slowly realizes that out of his stupor years ago, his son was conceived.Although this indiscretion would seem like the perfect excuse for Wally to reveal his true feelings for Kassie, complications ensue when she starts a relationship with Roland, now desperately on the rebound from a bitter divorce. At the same time, Wally forms a close bond with Sebastian who naturally gravitates toward him because of their mutual idiosyncrasies. Bateman handles Wally's evolution from self-absorbed fatalist to paternal protector with aplomb and surprising depth. Aniston is better served here than in most of her standard-issue romantic comedies, and the sharp interplay between these two actors, especially in the beginning scenes, is refreshingly rapid-fire like a modern-day ""His Girl Friday"". With his constantly forlorn expression interrupted by moments of genuine happiness, Thomas Robinson is terrifically understated as Sebastian, and his unforced scenes with Bateman represent the true high points of the film.A crack supporting cast has been assembled. As Wally's best friend and manager, the sarcastic ladies' man Leonard, Jeff Goldblum takes a predictable role and gives it his special, off-kilter twist. The result is his funniest turn in years, for example, his use of the term ""ill-advised"" during the moment of revelation is hilariously unexpected. The same can also be said for Juliette Lewis, who plays Kassie's constantly inappropriate best friend Debbie with her spacey delivery intact as she slings clever putdowns at Wally. Even Patrick Wilson, saddled with the no-win role of the golden boy Roland, who has no capacity for honest introspection, is funny in a role that gets diabolically transparent as the proceedings get complicated. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray offers a standard set of extras - a fifteen-minute making-of featurette (""The Switch Conceived""); about ten deleted and alternate scenes running for nearly half an hour in total, one a more purposeful variation on the central scene; and a brief blooper reel.

Yes, it has been done many times with varying results, but what makes this version of the story different and worthy of merit and attention is the sparkling screenplay by Allan Loeb adapted from the short story 'Baster' by gifted author Jeffrey Eugenides ('Middlesex', 'The Virgin Suicides', 'My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead', and short stories 'The Speed of Sperm', 'Air Mail', 'Ancient Myths', etc).  It is a film that gives us the opportunity to remember the fine comic time of Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, and Juliet Lewis, courtesy of the fine direction by Josh Gordon and Will Speck..Wally Mars (Jason Bateman) is an oddly neurotic character who has a very difficult time connecting to people, especially in the dating department.  His best friend is Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston) a successful woman who abruptly decides her biologic clock is ticking down and decides to have a baby by paying a sperm donor.  Wally is shocked, but Kassie's other best friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis, bubbling brilliantly) supports her conviction to take charge of her life and plans a party to celebrate Kassie's incipient 'donation'.  Kassie selects a potential donor in Roland (Patrick Wilson) who is a square and married teacher but 'needs the money'.  At the party when the 'donation' is to be deposited, Wally gets drunk and accidentally spills Roland's 'contribution', and in drunken desperation replaces it with his own - a secret he doesn't even share with Leonard (Jeff Goldblum) with whom he works and has a strong friendship. The inseminated  Kassie moves back home, returning seven years later with her six-year old son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson, a very fine child actor).  Kassie courts the now divorced Roland, a blow to Wally who in his 'babysitting' chores grows close to Sebastian who is very much like Wally.  How the story ends is predictable but heartwarmingly humorous, especially watching the relationship between Wally and Sebastian develop.In addition to the strong cast of leading actors there are cameos by Kelli Barrett and especially the significantly impressive Scott Elrod (watch this young actor's career blossom!). Largely due to the smart dialogue delivered by specialists in comedy, this film works well.

1410965,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B004IK30PA,Jean-ren Leroux,"[17, 31]","The only reason i take time to talk about this movie is because it is symptomatic of too much ""Hollywood-Pop-Corn-Movies"" being made all the time where the heart of the action or the ""crux of the plot"" is being stretched to its maximum until the very end. The cause of the climax arrives at about 30 minutes in the movie. The leading man did something wrong and needs to reveal it to the leading lady. The film is built around that revelation-to-come. After about 40 minutes, more or less, the man has the occasion to tell it to the woman. Of course, events will come in the way and he won't be able to do so... until the conclusion arrives.My point is: why not take the opportunity to reveal it when the occasion arrives, at about 40 minutes, and then be creative and go in a new direction? Why stretch the whole thing for another 40 or 60 minutes? They won't be any new story devices unfolding. We will simply go through a series of clich&eacute;s until we finally arrive to what we knew would happen 40 or 60 minutes ago. Then, when it becomes interesting, the movie is over.""The Switch"" is therefore just another forgettable movie being made by following a narrative recipe which consists in having a good and solid beginning which is then stretched until the very end by using all the usual clich&eacute;s. We all love to be told the same romantic story over and over again. It's conforting. Here, we know how it will end and, of course, we want it to end that way. So the movie plays on that without any real flavor.For a good romantic comedy, which is original in its structure while using all the clich&eacute;s, try and see a french movie titled: ""Prte-moi ta main"" (""How to get married and stay single"" in its english version). it's available here at Amazon. The heart of the action comes at about 40 minutes. It is dealt with and then, it brings you in a series of original events until the very end... while still remaining mainstream and clich&eacute;.",1,"A good example on ""what-not-to-do-in-a-romantic-comedy"" or any commercial movie for that matter",1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1965,"['only', 'reason', 'i', 'take', 'time', 'talk', 'movie', 'symptomatic', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood-Pop-Corn-Movies', 'being', 'made', 'time', 'where', 'heart', 'action', 'crux', 'plot', 'being', 'stretched', 'maximum', 'very', 'end', 'cause', 'climax', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'leading', 'man', 'did', 'something', 'wrong', 'needs', 'reveal', 'leading', 'lady', 'film', 'built', 'revelation-to-come', '40', 'minutes', 'more', 'less', 'man', 'occasion', 'tell', 'woman', 'course', 'events', 'will', 'come', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'conclusion', 'arrives.My', 'point', 'why', 'not', 'take', 'opportunity', 'reveal', 'when', 'occasion', '40', 'minutes', 'then', 'be', 'creative', 'go', 'new', 'direction', 'Why', 'stretch', 'whole', 'thing', '40', '60', 'minutes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'new', 'story', 'devices', 'unfolding', 'will', 'simply', 'go', 'series', 'clich', 'eacute', 'finally', 'arrive', 'what', 'knew', 'would', 'happen', '40', '60', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Then', 'when', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Switch', 'therefore', 'just', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'following', 'narrative', 'recipe', 'having', 'good', 'solid', 'beginning', 'then', 'stretched', 'very', 'end', 'using', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'love', 'be', 'told', 'same', 'romantic', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'conforting', 'Here', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'course', 'want', 'end', 'way', 'movie', 'real', 'flavor.For', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'original', 'structure', 'using', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'try', 'see', 'french', 'movie', 'titled', 'Prte-moi', 'ta', 'main', 'How', 'get', 'married', 'stay', 'single', 'english', 'version', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'heart', 'action', '40', 'minutes', 'dealt', 'then', 'series', 'original', 'events', 'very', 'end', 'still', 'remaining', 'mainstream', 'clich', 'eacute']",The Switch

1410978,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B004IK30PA,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[3, 3]","It almost seems like a misnomer designating ""The Switch"" a romantic comedy.  There is romance, but in my book the chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman was a little sketchy at best.  The real draw was the dynamic between Bateman and Thomas Robinson, who brilliantly plays Sebastian, the little boy in the movie.  Watching the two grow in their father and son relationship was endearing and heartfelt.  I would also have to add that Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis added their quirky twists in the supporting cast area.  They did keep the comedic relief moving along, but......  The movie overall was a little slow.  While I did enjoy it, I never did feel any real connection between Bateman and Aniston and that left a decent sized hole in the overall plot.Jennifer Anniston plays a working woman who finds her biological clock shifting into overdrive.  She hasn't found that perfect man yet, but decides that he is not needed in order for her to have a child.  So she sets in motion the process of having a baby as a single mother, all on her own.  This is where the twist occurs when her best friend Bateman inadvertently injects his own input into the birthing plan, and life takes an interesting twist.Bateman is a successful businessman who has more neurotic issues than most average everyday citizens.  From humming while he eats, to convincing himself he has almost every sickness known to mankind, he just can't quite get his personal life on track.  The poor guy can't even figure out he is in love with Jennifer for thirteen years.  He really does define the definition of slow.  So Anniston gets pregnant but before the baby is born, decides to move back to her small Midwest home in order to be close to family.  Seven years pass and she ends up moving back to New York City, but this time she has a six year old boy in tow.Anniston and Bateman reconnect as old friends do, and at long last start to realize they might have feelings beyond just friendship, and then of course the third wheel comes into the picture and messes things up.  This part of the story was a little weak for me.  The triangle formed by Bateman, Anniston and the other guy never seemed real or believable.  It was awkward and almost distracted you from the overwhelming draw that inadvertently consumed your attention, which was the interaction between Bateman and Robinson.There are so many wonderful moments between father and son as they both grow to understand and acknowledge one another, that it almost seemed more of a movie about them than anything else.  Thomas Robison was perfectly cast as the quirky neurotic six year old, and his one liners had me laughing out loud.  Who knows a little boy that wants to have his birthday party at a last call animal shelter, and the lice scene for anyone who has a child was too funny.  Bateman looked at home wearing his plastic shower cap.So I absolutely enjoyed the movie overall but if you see it expecting a typical romantic cookie cutter comedy you will most likely be disappointed.  The romance was flawed at best, but the movie was saved by the neurosis of Bateman who was fantastic in his journey to maturity, albeit a slow one that at times had to drag him forward under severe protest.",4,Not your typical romantic comedy.,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,3246,"['almost', 'misnomer', 'designating', 'Switch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'book', 'chemistry', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'was', 'little', 'sketchy', 'best', 'real', 'draw', 'was', 'dynamic', 'Bateman', 'Thomas', 'Robinson', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'Sebastian', 'little', 'boy', 'movie', 'Watching', 'two', 'grow', 'father', 'son', 'relationship', 'was', 'endearing', 'heartfelt', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'add', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'added', 'quirky', 'twists', 'supporting', 'cast', 'area', 'did', 'keep', 'comedic', 'relief', 'moving', 'along', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'did', 'enjoy', 'never', 'did', 'feel', 'real', 'connection', 'Bateman', 'Aniston', 'left', 'decent', 'sized', 'hole', 'overall', 'plot.Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'working', 'woman', 'who', 'biological', 'clock', 'shifting', 'overdrive', ""n't"", 'found', 'perfect', 'man', 'yet', 'not', 'needed', 'order', 'have', 'child', 'motion', 'process', 'having', 'baby', 'single', 'mother', 'own', 'where', 'twist', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Bateman', 'inadvertently', 'own', 'input', 'birthing', 'plan', 'life', 'interesting', 'twist.Bateman', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'more', 'neurotic', 'issues', 'most', 'average', 'everyday', 'citizens', 'humming', 'convincing', 'almost', 'sickness', 'known', 'mankind', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'personal', 'life', 'track', 'poor', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'thirteen', 'years', 'really', 'define', 'definition', 'slow', 'Anniston', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'born', 'move', 'back', 'small', 'Midwest', 'home', 'order', 'be', 'close', 'family', 'Seven', 'years', 'pass', 'up', 'moving', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'time', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'tow.Anniston', 'Bateman', 'reconnect', 'old', 'friends', 'do', 'long', 'last', 'start', 'realize', 'might', 'have', 'feelings', 'just', 'friendship', 'then', 'course', 'third', 'wheel', 'picture', 'messes', 'things', 'up', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'triangle', 'formed', 'Bateman', 'Anniston', 'other', 'guy', 'never', 'seemed', 'real', 'believable', 'was', 'awkward', 'almost', 'distracted', 'overwhelming', 'draw', 'inadvertently', 'consumed', 'attention', 'was', 'interaction', 'Bateman', 'Robinson.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'father', 'son', 'grow', 'understand', 'acknowledge', 'one', 'almost', 'seemed', 'more', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'Thomas', 'Robison', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'quirky', 'neurotic', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'one', 'liners', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Who', 'little', 'boy', 'have', 'birthday', 'party', 'last', 'call', 'animal', 'shelter', 'lice', 'scene', 'anyone', 'who', 'child', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'Bateman', 'looked', 'home', 'wearing', 'plastic', 'shower', 'cap.So', 'absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'overall', 'see', 'expecting', 'typical', 'romantic', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'comedy', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'romance', 'was', 'flawed', 'best', 'movie', 'was', 'saved', 'neurosis', 'Bateman', 'who', 'was', 'fantastic', 'journey', 'maturity', 'slow', 'one', 'times', 'had', 'drag', 'forward', 'severe', 'protest']",The Switch

Long story short: Aniston wants a baby, gets a donor, Bateman gets drunk at her pary and accidentally loses the ""donation"" and decides to replace it thus hijacking her pregnancy. The highlights of this film are the the way Bateman interacts with people in general. He's super neurotic and not sure what to do in most situations. Things get more complicated when he realizes he's the father of Aniston's young son. Now that's where things get good, the interaction between Bateman and Thomas Robinson, who plays Aniston's son. This kid was good, he was cute and funny and just delightful to watch work off Bateman. The kid is a collector of picture frames and when you learn the story behind it you'll get a fuzzy feeling in your heart.

1411060,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B004IK30PA,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[2, 3]","I should get this out of the way upfront: I didn't really like this movie much.  The dialogue wasn't all that clever, the characters felt like character types, and a lot of it seemed like a paint by the numbers set up - once they had a basic scenario drawn from contemporary New York trends in place they thought: okay, we need each of these characters to have quirky same-sex best friends, etc.  My wife wanted to watch it, and she didn't end up liking it all that much either, but liked it more than I did.  Still, it's not bad and was moderately entertaining.  I didn't hate it - and while I usually don't write reviews of films I feel lukewarm about, I found the basic premise to be somewhat interesting and an amusing twist on the ""best friends that really should be lovers"" type of romantic comedy.  So I decided to write up something about that.Romantic comedies in general work by putting together two people who don't know and can't even imagine that they're destined to get together.  There's always something that keeps them apart, but we know eventually something will happen and they'll see they were made for one another.  In the ""best friends"" rom coms what keeps them apart is what keeps them together: they're best friends, they share every fear and insecurity and know all about each other's worst sides.  Usually, even worse, the guy still hopes maybe something between them could work out, but the girl decided long ago that he was too immature, too macho, too geeky, too serious, or too something to be seriously considered romantically.  In this case, as announced by a homeless man on the streets of NYC, it's that he's a ""man child"" - he (Jason Bateman) never really grew up from what was likely a morose childhood.  So he's the kind of guy she (Jennifer Aniston) loves to share her troubles with but couldn't imagine sharing an apartment with.  As his best friend's friend puts it, he's just not dating material.  While that's somewhat difficult to believe for Jason Bateman, there are a few scenes in there that show just how his character could cause a woman to quickly lose interest.  In spite of being generally attractive and successful, he's just too much of a downer.When his best girl friend decides to have a child even though she's unattached, he gets jealous and realizes he feels something for her.  Still, she just can't see him that way.  The twist - and it's tied to the ""switch"" described in the title (but might be a bit of a spoiler, so stop reading now if you don't want that) - comes when she ends up giving birth to someone very much like him.  Suddenly, for a variety of reasons, but mostly because she already loves and shares her life with another morose man child, she's able to see her best friend with new eyes.  What struck me was that there never really was much chemistry between Aniston and Bateman, and that didn't change much in the end.  What explains the shift is not really a romantic revelation but a peculiar reversal: on the one hand the best friend becomes father figure to the son, but on the other hand she loves him because he is just like the son she already loves.  So it's a peculiar triumph: the man that only a mother could love falls in love with and wins the heart of the one who is in a certain sense his surrogate mother.",2,"A guy that only a mother could love, and his best (girl) friend becomes a mother",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,3298,"['should', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'upfront', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'clever', 'characters', 'felt', 'character', 'types', 'lot', 'seemed', 'paint', 'numbers', 'set', 'up', 'once', 'had', 'basic', 'scenario', 'drawn', 'contemporary', 'New', 'York', 'trends', 'place', 'thought', 'okay', 'need', 'characters', 'have', 'quirky', 'same-sex', 'best', 'friends', 'etc', 'wife', 'wanted', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'that', 'much', 'liked', 'more', 'did', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'reviews', 'films', 'feel', 'lukewarm', 'found', 'basic', 'premise', 'be', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'amusing', 'twist', 'best', 'friends', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'lovers', 'type', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'decided', 'write', 'up', 'something', 'that.Romantic', 'comedies', 'general', 'work', 'putting', 'together', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'destined', 'get', 'together', 'always', 'something', 'apart', 'know', 'eventually', 'something', 'will', 'happen', ""'ll"", 'see', 'were', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'rom', 'coms', 'what', 'apart', 'what', 'together', ""'re"", 'best', 'friends', 'share', 'fear', 'insecurity', 'know', 'other', 'worst', 'sides', 'Usually', 'even', 'worse', 'guy', 'still', 'maybe', 'something', 'could', 'work', 'out', 'girl', 'decided', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'too', 'immature', 'too', 'macho', 'too', 'geeky', 'too', 'serious', 'too', 'something', 'be', 'seriously', 'considered', 'romantically', 'case', 'announced', 'homeless', 'man', 'streets', 'NYC', 'man', 'child', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'never', 'really', 'grew', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'likely', 'morose', 'childhood', 'kind', 'guy', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'share', 'troubles', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'best', 'friend', 'friend', 'just', 'not', 'dating', 'material', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'character', 'could', 'cause', 'woman', 'quickly', 'lose', 'interest', 'spite', 'being', 'generally', 'attractive', 'successful', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'downer.When', 'best', 'girl', 'friend', 'have', 'child', 'even', 'unattached', 'jealous', 'something', 'Still', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'twist', 'tied', 'switch', 'described', 'title', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'so', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'when', 'up', 'giving', 'birth', 'someone', 'very', 'much', 'Suddenly', 'variety', 'reasons', 'mostly', 'already', 'shares', 'life', 'morose', 'man', 'child', 'able', 'see', 'best', 'friend', 'new', 'eyes', 'What', 'struck', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Aniston', 'Bateman', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'end', 'What', 'shift', 'not', 'really', 'romantic', 'revelation', 'peculiar', 'reversal', 'one', 'hand', 'best', 'friend', 'father', 'figure', 'son', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'son', 'already', 'peculiar', 'triumph', 'man', 'only', 'mother', 'could', 'love', 'falls', 'love', 'heart', 'one', 'who', 'certain', 'sense', 'surrogate', 'mother']",The Switch

I watched her one of her first big screen movies, The Good Girl, and she was an amazing actress.  Sadly now she's just playing it safe with formulaic comedies that she seems to sleep-walk through.  And The Switch is no exception.The plot goes like this; 40ish career woman, Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) gets tired of waiting for Mr. Right while her eggs are aging faster than raw fish left out on the counter.  Being a can-do kind of gal, Kassie decides to have a baby the new-fashion way, and finds a strapping hunk of a handsome young man to donate his sperm to her project.  Because the whole idea seems a little cold and unfeeling to Kassie, she has a party the night of the insemination, inviting all her friends over to party it up before she goes under the 'turkey baster' so to speak.The donor (Patrick Wilson) is blonde haired-blue-eyed and a very upbeat kind of fellow, as opposed to Kassie's best friend Willie(Jason Bateman) who's puts the 'S' in sad-sack, but who loves her dearly.  So, Willie gets messed up with herbs and hard liquor and accidentally spills the donor's donation into the sink.  Not knowing what else to do, Willie makes his own donation.Fast forward 7 years, and Kassie moves back to New York with her six year-old son who's a mini-me of Willie.  Of course Willie figures it out, and then he wonders if he can possibly tell Kassie and risk losing her forever with his deceit.While the premise of the movie is fine, though sort of low humor, it's Jennifer's performance that bothers me.  She's not all warm and fuzzy with the truly cute kid who plays her son, in fact her only emotion seems to be irritability, so much so that I kept wondering why Bateman was in love with her.  Was it just that he's a sadist?  I guess that works, though it was hard to watch.I keep watching Jennifer's movies, hoping that I'll see the fine actress in The Good Girl, but she's wearing me out.
