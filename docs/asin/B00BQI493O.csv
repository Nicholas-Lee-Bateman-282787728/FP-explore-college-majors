Renken,"[0, 0]","I always admire a woman who, when down and out, has the gumption to pick herself up and improve not only her own life but that of family members.  This holds true not only for our Native Americans but for all women everywhere.  There is always a way to get help and if one needs it, get it!  Never could understand how a person can allow themself to become addicted to alcohol, tobacco, or anything else but so be it.

At 3 years of age she was raped and over many years as a child was molested.  She is a re-covering alcoholic and is trying to rebuild her life.  You follow her as mistakes are made and different paths are taken.  She tries to rebuild her relationship with her 2 charming children and make a better life for them.  I cheered for her to make her life better for herself and her children I really want her to succeed.  This is a series not to be missed .,5,Overcoming lifes hardships,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,531,"['movie', 'three', 'years', 'making', 'Robin', 'Charbonneau', 'family', '3', 'years', 'age', 'was', 'raped', 'many', 'years', 'child', 'was', 'molested', 're-covering', 'alcoholic', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'life', 'follow', 'mistakes', 'are', 'made', 'different', 'paths', 'are', 'taken', 'rebuild', 'relationship', '2', 'charming', 'children', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'cheered', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'herself', 'children', 'really', 'want', 'succeed', 'series', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Kind Hearted Woman: Film By David Sutherland
