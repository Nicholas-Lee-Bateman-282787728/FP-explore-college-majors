For a fun and innocent teenage comedy, it's totally worth watching.  It's about a young man in 7th grade who has two problems.  One, he has a major crush on a beautiful blonde-haired girl and he wants to get her attention any way he can, and two, he gets picked on by his older brother *constantly* and frequently seeks out to try and get along with him (and their parents have the exact same desire).Well the problem is, every time the boy tries to impress the girl, his older brother does something to humiliate him, which then usually shifts into an embarrassing adventure (for example, in one scene the older brother manages to get his younger bro to walk through a hotel in his underwear and threatens to spill the beans concerning this news to the blonde-haired girl at the end of the hallway involving a video tape that recorded this little mishap).The best segment however, is the one where the parents force the two brothers to get along while the parents are out of town, and the parents are hoping spending much needed time together will finally make their relationship better, but... the brothers go against their parents wishes and throw a party at home, haha.  This turns out to be a pretty popular chunk of the storytelling- this one huge party, which translates into the two boys trying desperately to keep the news hidden from their parents and clean up the after effects of the party before the parents make a surprise phone call and announce they're coming home early.  A lot of funny things happen at this party, though.Also some of the 7th graders friends are hilarious too, especially the one who unintentionally sits on a spiked ball!What I find extremely bizarre is that the older brother looks EXACTLY like a young Mick Jagger!  Seriously, check out Mick Jagger from circa-1963.  You'll see a facial similarity!  Also, the father (played by Steve Zahn) looks exactly like an old friend of mine from 11th grade environmental science class who used to make funny/scary faces whenever I entered the room, lol.  Good memories.Overall, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is most certainly a family movie, or more specifically, a movie for kids in between the ages of 5-15.  It's really funny though, and I wasn't expecting this at all.  I recommend it.",5,surprisingly funny,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,2404,"['Alright', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'wee', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'watch', 'movie', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', ""'m"", '30', 'years', 'old', 'Oh', 'well', 'fun', 'innocent', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'totally', 'worth', 'watching', 'young', 'man', '7th', 'grade', 'who', 'two', 'problems', 'One', 'major', 'crush', 'beautiful', 'blonde-haired', 'girl', 'get', 'attention', 'way', 'can', 'two', 'picked', 'older', 'brother', '*constantly*', 'frequently', 'out', 'try', 'get', 'along', 'parents', 'have', 'exact', 'same', 'desire', '.Well', 'problem', 'time', 'boy', 'impress', 'girl', 'older', 'brother', 'something', 'humiliate', 'then', 'usually', 'shifts', 'embarrassing', 'adventure', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'older', 'brother', 'manages', 'get', 'younger', 'bro', 'walk', 'hotel', 'underwear', 'spill', 'beans', 'concerning', 'news', 'blonde-haired', 'girl', 'end', 'hallway', 'involving', 'video', 'tape', 'recorded', 'little', 'mishap', 'best', 'segment', 'however', 'one', 'where', 'parents', 'force', 'two', 'brothers', 'get', 'along', 'parents', 'are', 'town', 'parents', 'are', 'hoping', 'spending', 'much', 'needed', 'time', 'together', 'will', 'finally', 'make', 'relationship', 'better', 'brothers', 'go', 'parents', 'wishes', 'throw', 'party', 'home', 'haha', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'popular', 'chunk', 'storytelling-', 'one', 'huge', 'party', 'two', 'boys', 'trying', 'desperately', 'keep', 'news', 'hidden', 'parents', 'clean', 'up', 'effects', 'party', 'parents', 'make', 'surprise', 'phone', 'call', 'announce', ""'re"", 'coming', 'home', 'early', 'lot', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'party', 'though.Also', '7th', 'graders', 'friends', 'are', 'hilarious', 'too', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'unintentionally', 'spiked', 'ball', 'What', 'find', 'extremely', 'bizarre', 'older', 'brother', 'EXACTLY', 'young', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Seriously', 'check', 'out', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'circa-1963', ""'ll"", 'see', 'facial', 'similarity', 'Also', 'father', 'played', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'exactly', 'old', 'friend', 'mine', '11th', 'grade', 'environmental', 'science', 'class', 'who', 'used', 'make', 'funny/scary', 'whenever', 'entered', 'room', 'lol', 'Good', 'memories.Overall', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'most', 'certainly', 'family', 'movie', 'more', 'specifically', 'movie', 'kids', 'ages', '5-15', 'really', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'recommend']",Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules

The second thing is that sequels are not usually better than the original movie but this one is.I've read all the Wimpy Kid books and like them, the natural progression was to watch the movies. I like this movie because it's light and fast to get through, no slow boring parts. I thought the casting was pretty good and all of them did their parts well despite the fact that they don't look like their characters as much as I thought. For example, because the mother has that old fashioned hairstyle in the book, I expected her to be much ""nerdier"".The whole movie was humorous rather than outright funny, but that was OK because that's what the book was and it followed the book pretty well. If you like the books, you should definitely see the movie.

1434421,A22QBZ3XB2ZS2Z,B004Z7AHTI,space&amp;time,"[0, 0]","""Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Rodrick Rules"" is one of the more under-rated surprise hit films of last year.  It made the number 1 slot for it's opening weekend at almost $25,000,000.00, a score very few films achieve.  It stole the opening week away from the favored and heavily marketed, lingerie clad bevy of beautiful Hollywood starlets who got ""Sucker Punched"" by ""The Wimpy Kid"".The sequel to the very popular 2010 ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movie, Rodrick Rules focuses on a different element than the first movie.  In the first movie, we find the main characters focus on surviving Middle School, relationships, bullies, family dynamics and popularity.  Both Wimpy Kid movies have been totally under-marketed and definately under-rated as films that are laugh-out-loud funny, relatable and deeply emotional to the masses of theater goers.In a ""John Hughes"" style, Rodrick Rules focuses on family dynamics, relationships, sibling rivalry, and parental frustration at it's core.  Instead of a ""High School"" setting that Hughes found so relevant, Wimpy Kid goes deeper into the most troubled and difficult times of our lives -- Jr. High School/Middle School.  This is the jumping off point from childhood with no-where to jump for most of us.  You are no longer treated like a kid, yet your still not old enough to be a teenager or adult.  This is truely ""no-mans"" land and the both painful and growing up lessons we learned during this period have etched their mark on our very souls.In DWK, Rodrick Rules, Mom (played delightfully by Rachel Harris), is trying so hard to get her two older sons to ""bond"" with one another.  She goes so far as to offer ""Mom Bucks"" (a sort of money payoff) if they spend time together or help each other.  This makes for a very funny ongoing set of comedic circumstances since the two brothers are about as far apart from each other as can be.  The middle son Greg Heffley (played brilliantly by an excellent kid actor - Zachary Gordon) is tormented most of the time by his older brother Rodrick (played wonderfully by Devon Bostick).  Rodrick would prefer to have nothing to do with his younger sibling, but Mom intervenes and forces the issue because it hurts her to see that they are so disconnected.  Dad (played understatedly well by Steve Zahn) sort of supports the mothers efforts, but really believes in his ""heart of hearts"" that mom's plan isn't going to work.  The whole cast is really exceptional and makes you believe in their struggles without much effort.There are so many funny scenes in this movie, you have to pay attention or you will miss alot of them and the adult inuendo's that fly by at a moments notice.  The story is sensible, realistic, relatable, emotional and heartwarming all at the same time.  We have all lived thru these well played out scenarios in real life and it just makes the connection that much better for us in the film.  There is nothing, not to like about this movie or the first one.This is a movie for all ages, well, let me qualify.  You have had to have survived or have an undertanding of Jr. High School or Middle School and some family dynamics in order to really connect with the first movie.  This doesn't apply as much to the second movie - DWK Rodrick Rules.  Also, you don't have to have seen the first one to enjoy the second.  If you allow yourself to slip into the movie, you will find yourself caught up in it's web of entertainment.  The movie is simply enjoyable, ""laugh out loud"" funny, it will keep your interest, it is paced well, and offers wholesome solid entertainment!If you are looking for a 3D, computer animated special effects film, you won't find it here.  Instead you'll find a wholesome emotional rollercoaster of enjoyable film entertainment at it's core level.  They have cleverly crafted interactions of live action characters with some of the cartoon characters from the actual Book for a rather interesting effect.  The adaptation to screen is very close, probably the closest I have seen in a book adaptation to screen.  But don't worry, you do not have to read the books to understand these films.  These films are about life, growing up, heartbreak, and finding oneself.You can watch this movie as a family, with a friend, or simply by yourself...you won't be disappointed!",4,A Wonderfully Funny and Entertaining Film!,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,4284,"['Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'one', 'more', 'under-rated', 'surprise', 'hit', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'made', 'number', '1', 'slot', 'opening', 'weekend', 'almost', '25,000,000.00', 'score', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'achieve', 'stole', 'opening', 'week', 'away', 'favored', 'heavily', 'marketed', 'clad', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'Hollywood', 'starlets', 'who', 'got', 'Sucker', 'Punched', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', '.The', 'sequel', 'very', 'popular', '2010', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'movie', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'different', 'element', 'first', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'find', 'main', 'characters', 'focus', 'surviving', 'Middle', 'School', 'relationships', 'bullies', 'family', 'dynamics', 'popularity', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'under-marketed', 'definately', 'under-rated', 'films', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'relatable', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'masses', 'theater', 'goers.In', 'John', 'Hughes', 'style', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'family', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'parental', 'frustration', 'core', 'Instead', 'High', 'School', 'setting', 'Hughes', 'found', 'so', 'relevant', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'deeper', 'most', 'troubled', 'difficult', 'times', 'lives', 'Jr.', 'High', 'School/Middle', 'School', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'childhood', 'no-where', 'jump', 'most', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'treated', 'kid', 'yet', 'still', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'teenager', 'adult', 'truely', 'no-mans', 'land', 'painful', 'growing', 'up', 'lessons', 'learned', 'period', 'have', 'etched', 'mark', 'very', 'souls.In', 'DWK', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'Mom', 'played', 'delightfully', 'Rachel', 'Harris', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'two', 'older', 'sons', 'bond', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'offer', 'Mom', 'Bucks', 'sort', 'money', 'payoff', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'help', 'other', 'very', 'funny', 'ongoing', 'set', 'comedic', 'circumstances', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'far', 'apart', 'other', 'can', 'be', 'middle', 'son', 'Greg', 'Heffley', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'excellent', 'kid', 'actor', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'tormented', 'most', 'time', 'older', 'brother', 'Rodrick', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'Rodrick', 'would', 'prefer', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'younger', 'sibling', 'Mom', 'intervenes', 'issue', 'see', 'are', 'so', 'disconnected', 'Dad', 'played', 'understatedly', 'well', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'sort', 'supports', 'mothers', 'efforts', 'really', 'heart', 'hearts', 'mom', 'plan', ""n't"", 'going', 'work', 'whole', 'cast', 'really', 'exceptional', 'believe', 'struggles', 'much', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'miss', 'alot', 'adult', 'inuendo', 'fly', 'moments', 'notice', 'story', 'sensible', 'realistic', 'relatable', 'emotional', 'heartwarming', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'lived', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'scenarios', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'connection', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'nothing', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'first', 'one.This', 'movie', 'ages', 'well', 'let', 'qualify', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'survived', 'have', 'undertanding', 'Jr.', 'High', 'School', 'Middle', 'School', 'family', 'dynamics', 'order', 'really', 'connect', 'first', 'movie', ""n't"", 'apply', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'movie', 'DWK', 'Rodrick', 'Rules', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'enjoy', 'second', 'allow', 'slip', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'paced', 'well', 'wholesome', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'are', 'looking', '3D', 'computer', 'animated', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wholesome', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'entertainment', 'core', 'level', 'have', 'cleverly', 'crafted', 'interactions', 'live', 'action', 'characters', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'actual', 'Book', 'rather', 'interesting', 'effect', 'adaptation', 'screen', 'very', 'close', 'probably', 'closest', 'have', 'seen', 'book', 'adaptation', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'understand', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'heartbreak', 'finding', 'oneself.You', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'family', 'friend', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules

If you have not seen the first one, then I highly recommend you do so before viewing this one. The first Diary of A Wimpy Kid was funnier than this film and also remained closer to its book counterpart. Rodrick Rules strays from the book, but shows more character development and plot than the first one did. The character development in this film is way better than the first installment. In Rodrick Rules, we get to watch Greg and Rodrick develop as not only brothers but as friends. We learn more about the characters and care about them more than ever. One problem is that Rodrick Rules is not as funny as the first film. Rodrick Rules has it fair share of jokes but it didn't have as many as the first. Whether this is a bad thing is entirely up to you. Another problem I see is that this movie does have its fair share of cliches which most movies now do have. The only other problem I see is that the dialogue can be corny and cheesy at times. The acting in this movie is fairly decent, not fantastic but not terrible. It gets the job done for a kids movie. Overall, I recommend you see this movie if you like the books or liked the first movie. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a good family movie that people of all ages can enjoy.
