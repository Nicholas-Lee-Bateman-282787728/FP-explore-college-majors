Not nearly as riveting as its classic predecessor 'Spider-man 2,' this movie swings ahead admirably enough.  Just when this adventure starts to reek of overconfidence, we find a fresh trek going in unexpected directions.  While 'Spider-Man 2' made our hero a constantly beleaguered underdog, #3 shuffles the deck of perilous contingencies.  Seldom extraneous or convoluted, the peril and story lines are still inventive enough to keep our interest.  Indeed, the shifting developments are at times intense and frightening.  In epic and intricate proportions, this installment seldom fails to awe.We begin where we left off with impending engagement between Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry's (James Franco) angst against Peter for his father's death.  At first the rift between Peter and Harry takes a run-of-the-mill amnesia course, but the subsequent developments provide greater vigor.  Meanwhile, Peter's uncle's killer, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison to become the Sandman, an elusive monster with morphing dimensions.  If one villain isn't enough, then Peter's new newspaper rival, Brock and alter-ego, Venom (suavely and savagely played by Topher Grace) comes to roost after Peter's professor develops an evil transformative potion that even gives Spiderman a new makeover.  (Spiderman`s inner conflict gives us more depth than previously provided, and the startling visual effects are less recycled than reinvented.  Both keep us guessing.)Still retaining characters we love (Peter's aunt still provides badly needed tenderness, and his growling newspaper editor boss is still the lovable curmudgeon) but giving us a whole new venue, 'Spider-Man 3' promises many sequels to come.  Although the tension is diminished compared to the masterpiece of 'Spiderman 2,' #3 is an edgy and excellent edition to the 'Spiderman' franchise.  Sam Raimi's directing refuses to dwell on past laurels, and the sharp editing ably assists eye-popping visuals.  Hopefully, the `Spiderman' franchise will continue to be this worthy.  Penetrating and often startling, 'Spider-Man 3' seldom disappoints.",5,'Spiderman' Returns with a Vengeance,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2244,"['4', '1/2', '*', 'Mainly', 'better', 'worse', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'back', 'vengeance', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'riveting', 'classic', 'predecessor', ""'Spider-man"", '2', 'movie', 'swings', 'ahead', 'admirably', 'enough', 'Just', 'when', 'adventure', 'reek', 'overconfidence', 'find', 'fresh', 'trek', 'going', 'unexpected', 'directions', ""'Spider-Man"", '2', 'made', 'hero', 'constantly', 'beleaguered', 'underdog', '3', 'shuffles', 'deck', 'perilous', 'contingencies', 'Seldom', 'extraneous', 'convoluted', 'peril', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'inventive', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'Indeed', 'shifting', 'developments', 'are', 'times', 'intense', 'frightening', 'epic', 'intricate', 'proportions', 'installment', 'seldom', 'awe.We', 'begin', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'impending', 'engagement', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Harry', 'James', 'Franco', 'angst', 'Peter', 'father', 'death', 'first', 'rift', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'run-of-the-mill', 'amnesia', 'course', 'subsequent', 'developments', 'provide', 'greater', 'vigor', 'Meanwhile', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'killer', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'prison', 'become', 'Sandman', 'elusive', 'monster', 'morphing', 'dimensions', 'one', 'villain', ""n't"", 'enough', 'then', 'Peter', 'new', 'newspaper', 'rival', 'Brock', 'alter-ego', 'Venom', 'suavely', 'savagely', 'played', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'roost', 'Peter', 'professor', 'evil', 'transformative', 'potion', 'even', 'Spiderman', 'new', 'makeover', 'Spiderman', 's', 'inner', 'conflict', 'more', 'depth', 'previously', 'provided', 'startling', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'less', 'recycled', 'reinvented', 'keep', 'guessing', 'Still', 'retaining', 'characters', 'love', 'Peter', 'aunt', 'still', 'badly', 'needed', 'tenderness', 'growling', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'boss', 'still', 'lovable', 'curmudgeon', 'giving', 'whole', 'new', 'venue', ""'Spider-Man"", '3', 'promises', 'many', 'sequels', 'come', 'tension', 'diminished', 'compared', 'masterpiece', ""'Spiderman"", '2', '3', 'edgy', 'excellent', 'edition', ""'Spiderman"", 'franchise', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'directing', 'dwell', 'past', 'laurels', 'sharp', 'editing', 'ably', 'eye-popping', 'visuals', 'Hopefully', 'Spiderman', 'franchise', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'worthy', 'Penetrating', 'often', 'startling', ""'Spider-Man"", '3', 'seldom', 'disappoints']",Spider-Man 3

Spiderman 3 is a simple movie with quite a bit of action.  Actually for anyone with a lack of attention this movie is great.  Yeah I would be included in that grouping.I guess what makes Spiderman so likable is that he isn't like so many other super heros.  He isn't a muscle man and his powers are pretty simple.  His enemies almost always seem stronger than him.  The enemies even seem to have a human side.I didn't really feel any letdowns.  The action was there from the get go and it seemed like every villain was after Spiderman.  The real villain was Spidermans alter-ego.  Coming from a black goo and transforming Spidermans suit.  This goo actually caused Spidey to be a little more evil and a lot less forgiving.  Of course there were several good battles that made everything worthwhile even when everything else was lacking.This movie won't have you yelling for more but it sure will give you a fun ride.  The action is intense and never seems to end.  The acting was so-so and seemed like the same story-line from other Spiderman movies.  Although with the negative this is still a good movie.

I can barely begin to describe how bad this movie is when compared to its two predecessors, but I will try.First off, this is supposedly the most expensive film ever made and while the FX are a sight to behold at only a few key moments, they don't impress as much as they would if the typical audience member actually gave a turd about what was happening.Second, there's just way too much going on at once for the audience to have the time it takes to reflect on the events in the story.Third, now I'm not a stickler for a film adaptation of a comic book that takes certain liberties with the original source material, but when a man gets inexplicably transformed into sand and can suddenly fly around the city in a cloud-like formation, or when for some equally unexplained reason a meteorite lands and produces an alien black substance, you're just asking too much of any rational or semi-intelligent movie goer to suspend disbelief of this crap.Fourth, It's equally difficult to suspend disbelief when you're asked to accept that Tobey Maguire can portray a sex symbol while at the same time being asked to endure the vocal stylings of Kirsten Dunst.In short, this movie is barely better than trash like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.Despite all of that though, I actually enjoyed seeing this in the theater, souly because the 8 year old boy sitting behind me provided one of the funniest commentary tracks I've heard in years.",1,really really really really BAD!!!,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,1632,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'usually', 'have', 'sixth', 'sense', 'not', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'ignored', 'sense', 'saw', 'Spider-man', '3', 'opening', 'day', 'can', 'barely', 'begin', 'describe', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'when', 'compared', 'two', 'predecessors', 'will', 'try.First', 'off', 'supposedly', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'FX', 'are', 'sight', 'behold', 'only', 'few', 'key', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'impress', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'typical', 'audience', 'member', 'actually', 'gave', 'turd', 'what', 'was', 'happening.Second', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'once', 'audience', 'have', 'time', 'reflect', 'events', 'story.Third', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'stickler', 'film', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'certain', 'liberties', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'when', 'man', 'inexplicably', 'transformed', 'sand', 'can', 'suddenly', 'fly', 'city', 'cloud-like', 'formation', 'when', 'equally', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'meteorite', 'lands', 'alien', 'black', 'substance', ""'re"", 'just', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'rational', 'semi-intelligent', 'movie', 'goer', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'crap.Fourth', 'equally', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'when', ""'re"", 'asked', 'accept', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'can', 'portray', 'sex', 'symbol', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'asked', 'endure', 'vocal', 'stylings', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst.In', 'short', 'movie', 'barely', 'better', 'trash', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Batman', 'Robin.Despite', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'theater', 'souly', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'sitting', 'provided', 'one', 'funniest', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years']",Spider-Man 3
649622,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00005JPFH,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[1, 2]","This movie is the best of the series (a couple notches better than two, but WAAAY better than one). Spider-Man finally gets the girl, thinks about marriage and seems overall happier. He and Mary J. get in a fight in the beginning because she accuses Peter of being insensitive to her Broadway performance critique. Their relationship is kinda up and down throughout. Some really shocking things happen during the course of the movie and it must be known that of all 3 of the movies with McQuire portraying Parker this has the most depth; an intriguing depth that the other two lack. But let me tell you; the trilogy of Spider-Man went out with a serious bang with this movie. It might not be perfect but as far as the series goes it's an all-time high. The action was really good and I disagree when I hear people say that three enemies was too much. Finally, the last few scenes rocked! They were very emotive and if you're sensitive, prepare for some tears.Now I know many have said that there were some issues with this movie but I didn't find too many. It gets really intense at times and you just feel for the characters involved but it really works in the movie's favor. There were also more than a couple of totally light-hearted scenese that balance the more serious matters at hand (Peter's raggedy apartment door, anyone??). This is definitely my favorite superhero movie of all-time after watching it again today (10/11/12). I can't believe I haven't been re-watching it over and over again as it is way better than some have let on.

649623,A1TUZL12O7X1A9,B00005JPFH,Alexander G.,"[0, 1]","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's &#34;transformation&#34; into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the &#34;big&#34; ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole &#34;inner conflict&#34; theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's &#34;dark side&#34; is more comedy than anything else.Blu-Ray Quality is Superb.",2,Spider-Man 3 is A Let Down.,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2306,"['are', 'things', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'also', 'present', 'other', 'movies', 'movie', 'off', 'nicely', 'great', 'looking', 'action', 'sequence', 'how', 'great', 'rest', 'could', 'be', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'so', 'convoluted', 'anything', 'coherent', 'plot', 'lost', 'as', 'well', 'significant', 'character', 'development', 'further', 'Harry', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'himself.Peter', '34', 'transformation', '34', 'darker', 'self', 'when', 'dark', 'suit', 'laughable', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', ""'re"", 'watching', 'comedy', 'drama', 'purposefully', 'ridiculous', 'B', 'movie', 'Peter', 'actions', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'just', 'want', 'laugh', 'script', 'rather', 'WITH', 'it.The', 'main', 'villains', 'get', 'only', 'short', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', '34', 'big', '34', 'ending', ""'re"", 'just', 'wondering', 'when', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'going', 'end', 'when', 'Spiderman', '3', 'will', 'begin', '90', '%', 'film', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'walking', 'around', 'crying', 'making', 'fool', 'various', 'over-the-top', 'ways', 'Perhaps', 'went', 'too', 'many', 'expectations', 'such', 'possibility', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'would', 'fit', 'what', 'was', 'happening.As', 'fan', 'old', 'cartoon', 'real', 'fan', 'Venom', 'was', 'incredibly', 'let', 'down', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'essentially', 'Eric', '70', 'Show', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'same', 'actor', 'same', 'scrawny', 'sarcastic', 'joker', 'always', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'comic', 'cartoon', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'was', 'NOT', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Venom', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'villain', 'total', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', ""n't"", 'very', 'exciting', 'anything', 'explained', 'simply', 'suddenly', 'THERE', 'thrown', 'movie', 'only', 'get', 'butts', 'seats', 'So', 'entire', 'movie', 'filler', 'even', 'end', 'credits', 'start.There', 'was', 'point', 'halfway', 'movie', 'simply', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'justify', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'villains', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'single', 'one', 'very', 'deep', 'whole', '34', 'inner', 'conflict', '34', 'theme', 'joke', 'Literally', 'Peter', '34', 'dark', 'side', '34', 'more', 'comedy', 'anything', 'else.Blu-Ray', 'Quality', 'Superb']",Spider-Man 3

649626,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B00005JPFH,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","Many others here in these reviews have already pointed out how the inclusion of too many villians hurt this movie.  You would think the makers of this film would have learned from the horror that was ""Batman and Robin"" that that doesn't work.  The reasons should be obvious to a first year film student: put too many characters in and none end up getting enough screen time to be developed properly.  I think the most probable reason they do this sort of thing in superhero movies is because the most popular superheroes in comics, like Batman and Spider-Man, have so many great and memorable villains in their rogues galleries that, given the likelihood of getting only two or three, or maybe four movies made before the actor playing the hero won't come back to play the part again, or wants too much money, or is just too old, they have to put several villains in at once in order to hit all the ones that just HAVE to be put onscreen.  At least that's the only reason I can think of to explain why they make such an elementary and obvious mistake.  One hopes this movie will reinforce the lesson that when it comes to villains, less really is more, but I rather doubt it will.The other main problem with this movie is also common to the superhero genre, on both big screen and small: unsympathetic love interests.  In romance, the chase is more dramatic than the victory and its aftermath.  When the hero is trying to win the heart of his love the audience is pulling for him, and hoping he'll succeed, and tuning in to see if he will.  Once he's got her, a lot of that dramatic tension is simply gone, and viewers may lose interest.  So the writers, in order to put the success of that romance in jeopardy, and thus maintain dramatic tension, constantly have to come up with things that keep pulling the hero and his girl apart.  The problem is, this can only be taken so far before it starts to make the characters look immature, selfish, and unsympathetic.  You can see it in ""Superman Returns"" where Lois comes off looking selfish, spiteful, and passive-aggressive to the point where you can't help but wonder what the hell Superman sees in her.  The same thing happened to Lana in the TV series ""Smallville"" (which is a pity since Lana started out in season one as a very sympathetic character).  Well Mary Jane gets the same treatment here.  In scene after scene she seems positively determined to misunderstand Peter, ascribe the worst of motives to him, and refuse to give him any benefit of doubt.  He tries to comfort her after she gets a bad review, and she bites his head off for telling her he knows what it's like to be mocked and misunderstood.  Before a crowd (and clearly for their benefit) Peter, in costune as Spider-Man, lets a girl whose life he's saved kiss him, and Mary Jane, who as a young, good-looking actress is certainly someone whose work would require her to kiss another man than her boyfriend for a role, and should understand that was just showmanship, but she holds it against him.  Mary Jane instead of calling Peter when she'd feeling a bit down, runs off to spend time his best friend and then initiates a kiss with him, and so on.  This hurts the movie because it makes Mary Jane a fickle, undependable, untrusting, unsympathetic girl that he just might be better off without.The movie was entertaining, for all its flaws. But I hope that if they make a Spider-Man IV, they'll avoid repeating the mistakes of this installment.",3,"A good movie, but could have been better",1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,3469,"['Many', 'others', 'here', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'inclusion', 'too', 'many', 'villians', 'hurt', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'makers', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'horror', 'was', 'Batman', 'Robin', ""n't"", 'work', 'reasons', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'first', 'year', 'film', 'student', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'none', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'be', 'developed', 'properly', 'think', 'most', 'probable', 'reason', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'superhero', 'movies', 'most', 'popular', 'superheroes', 'comics', 'Batman', 'Spider-Man', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'memorable', 'villains', 'rogues', 'galleries', 'given', 'likelihood', 'getting', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'maybe', 'four', 'movies', 'made', 'actor', 'playing', 'hero', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'play', 'part', 'again', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'have', 'put', 'several', 'villains', 'once', 'order', 'hit', 'ones', 'just', 'HAVE', 'be', 'put', 'onscreen', 'least', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'explain', 'why', 'make', 'such', 'elementary', 'obvious', 'mistake', 'One', 'movie', 'will', 'reinforce', 'lesson', 'when', 'villains', 'less', 'really', 'more', 'rather', 'doubt', 'other', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'also', 'common', 'superhero', 'genre', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'unsympathetic', 'love', 'interests', 'romance', 'chase', 'more', 'dramatic', 'victory', 'aftermath', 'When', 'hero', 'trying', 'win', 'heart', 'love', 'audience', 'pulling', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'succeed', 'tuning', 'see', 'will', 'Once', 'got', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'simply', 'gone', 'viewers', 'may', 'lose', 'interest', 'writers', 'order', 'put', 'success', 'romance', 'jeopardy', 'thus', 'maintain', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'constantly', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'things', 'keep', 'pulling', 'hero', 'girl', 'apart', 'problem', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'so', 'far', 'make', 'characters', 'look', 'immature', 'selfish', 'unsympathetic', 'can', 'see', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'where', 'Lois', 'off', 'looking', 'selfish', 'spiteful', 'passive-aggressive', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'Superman', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Lana', 'TV', 'series', 'Smallville', 'pity', 'Lana', 'started', 'out', 'season', 'one', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Well', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'same', 'treatment', 'here', 'scene', 'scene', 'positively', 'determined', 'misunderstand', 'Peter', 'worst', 'motives', 'refuse', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'comfort', 'bad', 'review', 'head', 'telling', 'what', 'be', 'mocked', 'misunderstood', 'crowd', 'clearly', 'benefit', 'Peter', 'costune', 'Spider-Man', 'girl', 'life', 'saved', 'kiss', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'who', 'young', 'good-looking', 'actress', 'certainly', 'someone', 'work', 'would', 'require', 'kiss', 'man', 'boyfriend', 'role', 'should', 'understand', 'was', 'just', 'showmanship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'instead', 'calling', 'Peter', 'when', ""'d"", 'feeling', 'bit', 'down', 'spend', 'time', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'kiss', 'so', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'fickle', 'undependable', 'untrusting', 'unsympathetic', 'girl', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'without.The', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'flaws', 'hope', 'make', 'Spider-Man', 'IV', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'repeating', 'mistakes', 'installment']",Spider-Man 3

649630,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B00005JPFH,amerdale876,"[2, 5]","Being a long-time fan of comics, I secretly look forward to releases of movies based on comics -- no matter what the subject. And while most comic book movies in the past have been shredded to pieces by a majority of critics, the comic book movies today are often crafted so well that they most often receive critical acclaim. Case in point, 2002's ""Spider-Man."" Everyone loved the origin story of Peter Parker and his struggles of responsibility with his power and trying to lead a normal life. Movie and comic geeks drooled over how well the movie stayed fairly close to the original comic. And usually I'd be with them. However, the first ""Spider-Man"" movie didn't ""wow"" me (I liked ""Spidey 2"" more), say, the way the original 1989 ""Batman"" movie did. Maybe it was because I've always been a bigger fan of Batman than I have Spider-Man, but, regardless, I just thought Batman was a better movie. Now comes the part of this review where you, the reader, say, ""Are you kidding me? Spider-Man stayed more true to the comic and appealed to a much broader audience!"" Well, of course Spider-Man appeals to more people, he's your everyman. I mean, seriously, who can relate to an orphaned kid who grows up to be a billionaire playboy? Not many. But that's what I loved about Batman; it was easier for me to accept that story of someone that insanely rich becoming that character as opposed to some dorky kid -- which I was myself in high school -- gaining some superpowers from a spiderbite. I mean, dorky kids don't get those powers and they don't get the girl. I did go on to write a novel that followed along those same lines of an outcast obtaining a ""superpower"" as a result of a prank, but the ending in my book differs greatly from that of Spider-Man. Now, I know, I know. This is a comic. A medium where most guys/girls can escape the harsh reality of life and become engrossed in fantasy. But that's not how I rolled in high school. I wanted reality. And while a billionaire obtaining high-tech gadgetry and becoming a masked vigilante isn't all that real, it's certainly easier to accept than some dorky kid becoming a masked hero and getting a variety of hot, young babes.Now, on to my second point, 2002's ""Spider-Man"" is closer to the origin story whereas 1989's ""Batman"" had the audacity of making The Joker the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. Well, anyone who's a Batman fan/reader can tell you that the man who murdered Wayne's parents was a common thug named Joe Chill. And that made most comic fans blast ""Batman"" the movie. That's why in 2005's ""Batman Begins,"" fans cheered when Hollywood finally got it right. Well, ""Spider-Man 3"" has gone from that upstanding critics fave comic movie to the same formula that had fans blast 1989's Batman. Didn't anyone tell Sam Raimi that you're supposed to improve your screenwriting as you go and not demote it?""Spider-Man 3"" insults fans' intelligence by making Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben Parker. Wow! That must sting to all those critics who blasted ""Batman"" for not sticking true to the origin. But now, even those critics are praising ""Spider-Man 3"" simply on its special FX. Oh, the hypocrisy. And then, to make matters worse, they give Marko a wife/girlfriend and ill daughter in an attempt to have the audience feel more sorry for him, which also is definitely not true to the original. Why the sudden need to have villains appear as wussies? Seriously. I know the filmmakers want to get the audience to say, ""Oh, well, he's bad, but for a good reason."" No! That's not how it is and not how it should be portrayed on film! While I don't mind a little creative liberty, there's still a fine line that you shouldn't go past. And ""Spider-Man 3"" definitely went over and beyond that line. They did the same thing with 2004's ""Spider-Man 2,"" making Doctor Octopus some poor, unfortunate character who lost his wife in a lab accident he caused. Yeah, that's not the story! At least in the wretched 1997 sequel ""Batman & Robin,"" the writers got the origin of Mr. Freeze right. No, no, no! Both Sandman and Doc Ock are hardass criminals, not misunderstood, heart-of-gold men! And that's how they should be portrayed in the movies. Now, as for Edward Brock Jr. and Venom, THAT they got right!!! Now, if you want a villain to feel sorry for, instead of Sandman, they should have incorporated The Lizard, who the filmmakers had a great opportunity to exploit as his alter ego Dr. Curt Connors is portrayed in the films by the excellent Dylan Baker. Also, The Lizard would've been a better choice seeing how he has that whole Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona that would've paralleled perfectly with the Spidey red suit/black suit persona storyline that Parker struggles with in this film.Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed ""Spider-Man 3"" and found it was a thrill to see in the theater. But while the first two at least held a solid-built story, this one seemed a lot more choppy in parts. Because of its extreme attempt at jamming so much Spider-Man lore into one movie, it lacked that feeling of a complete story with a good amount of focus on each character. A good example are the use of Gwen Stacy and her father Police Captain George Stacy, played by the illuminating Bryce Dallas Howard and the talented James Cromwell, respectively. In fact, they're hardly used at all in the film! Which is a further insult to fans seeing how Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's first major love and is so crucial to the storyline of Spider-Man. And to think that in Spider-Man 3 she is merely used as an insulting plot device to make Mary Jane jealous!? What an insult and what a waste.It's a bold move for Raimi to tackle so many story lines such as the Venom symbiote and therefore introducing Eddie Brock, the ongoing troubled relationship with M.J., the troubled friendship with Harry Osborn, Peter dealing with his feelings about his Uncle Ben's death, entering a new villain Sandman, and introducing Gwen Stacy and her father George. However, it was a bit too much. This movie had its funny moments (which come off completely dorky like the true character of Peter Parker and the comic), but it also had its scary moments. And while the two villains seem like a mere sidenote in this movie (not being as developed as previous villains Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus), the filmmakers are safe because, after all, the trailer does say that the main villain in this story is Parker's inner darkness. Like I said, this review may sound like an attack but it's just a warning to fellow fans/readers that it's not true to the original story. Now, moviegoers who don't know the comic that well (and only know the Spidey movies) will probably like this movie a lot. But it's not the dazzling story that's been originally written over the years and is an insult to true fans' intelligence.Overall, as a film, ""Spider-Man 3"" works and I'm amazed at how brilliantly the FX crews can bring Spidey's web-slinging adventures to the screen. The performances by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, and especially James Franco (who STOLE this movie) are great, but, unfortunately, Howard, Cromwell and especially Church (who had a very limited amount of dialogue) were wasted in this film. The writing was off in comparing to the previous two films but the overall plot is interesting enough to keep audiences jamming the theaters for the next month or so. Bottom line: Although enjoyable, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a big movie, and that may ultimately be its problem.",3,A good movie but still disappointing,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,7521,"['Being',

649631,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00005JPFH,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[3, 3]","I know there are many people who think this is the worst of the trilogy, but I must disagree. This third and last Maguire movie gives us closure. Too, it had Maguire playing many different subroles within Peter Parker. The nerdy Parter, the cocky Parker, the cruel Parker, the jackass Parker, the Parker who did what he wanted due to arrogance, etc. This allowed the character to grow and the movie to show the many different facets that existed in the Peter Parker/Spiderman persona. The multilayered performance gave us insight into the many torments and demons Peter Parker & Spiderman have had to endure. The last movie was about losing his confidence; this movie was about him being overconfident.I liked Flint Marko and identified with him greatly. A Vietnam-Vet, rejected by society and oppressed by New York cops. A man who by his own words was not a bad person, but had bad luck in his life. He is an example of the typical down-on-his-luck American from The Great Recession. Marko, like most men, was a neutral man. Not good, but not evil. His amorality made him the most realistic of all the super-villains in the original Spiderman trilogy.Seeing Venom for the first time was a shock to me. I never thought he would make an appearance in the movies, but when the character did I was noting but pleased.The culmination of the love triangle between Harry Osborn and Peter Parker was a joy. This, in my opinion, was a drag in the series, its only real weak point in my opinion. Indeed, I'm glad the new Spiderman movie has avoided that for the most part. Even the comics and cartoon versions never had this. In the end, Franco's alturistic sacrifice made the movie's (And Series) climax a triumph.Buy this DVD for the extra backstory (Somewhat Apocrophyl I Might Say) concerning Ben Parker and his murderer(s). That added another layer to the Spiderman mythos. I enjoyed that at the time and most Spiderman fans will too.A.

649632,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00005JPFH,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[3, 13]","I'm not a Spiderman fan, but I could see how the first one was good.  I thought the second was an absolute disaster, though.Luckily, this one wasn't as terrible as the second.  But that's not saying much.For one, the villains are totally spoiled, in my opinion.  The sandman is so damn mopey and frowney that he's no fun.  He's just one of those ""honest cons out to help his family"" and decides the best way to use his new super power is to steal money and give it to his dying child---because the cops wouldn't dare track the money down when he looses it.  He's also apparently invincible, which makes him that much less interesting.Venom, one of my favorite villains from the old cartoon show, is reduced to a snotty little teen brat played by the actor who will forever be known as ""That Foreman kid from That 70s Show"", who made very lame wise-ass remarks even while in the Venom suit.  Imagine that fiendish black muscled creature with the huge mouth and snarling fangs suddenly snipping ""Oh well look, Spiderman, you're like, such a douche!""Obligatory from the sequel is the ""new"" Goblin in the form of Harry Osborne.  This one seems to be the only one in the right frame of mind for killing Spiderman, as he's the only one who ever comes remotely close.  Unfortunately, he falls victim to the cliche' ""let me talk to you while we're fighting and rather than do something efficient like stab you or shoot you or blow you up, let me just throw you into things and hope your bones shatter"", and then ends up sustaining a head injury which SHOULD kill a normal person.  He loses his memory for a while, then slowly regains it long enough to provide the film's one high point for me---making Spiderman cry when Mary Jane walks out on him.Thus we enter Emo Spiderman.  The black venom's effect on Peter Parker, rather than make him anything remotely wicked or sneering, makes him emo.  Any time the venom takes hold of him, his hair goes over his eye emo-style, and he starts acting so ridiculously ""suave"", jerking his crotch at women at the street, dancing wildly at the local jazz club, and picking fights with people.  Tobey Maguire shows he's got a lot more acting classes to go through before he can convince us of this new ""darker"" Spiderman.Lousy acting, a dense plot, and laughably pathetic characters even more laughably pathetically acted makes this sequel worth watching only because of how bad it was.",1,Two words: EMO SPIDERMAN!!,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,2415,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Spiderman', 'fan', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'thought', 'second', 'was', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'though.Luckily', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'terrible', 'second', 'not', 'saying', 'much.For', 'one', 'villains', 'are', 'totally', 'spoiled', 'opinion', 'sandman', 'so', 'damn', 'mopey', 'frowney', 'fun', 'just', 'one', 'honest', 'cons', 'out', 'help', 'family', 'best', 'way', 'use', 'new', 'super', 'power', 'steal', 'money', 'give', 'dying', 'child', 'cops', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'track', 'money', 'down', 'when', 'also', 'apparently', 'invincible', 'much', 'less', 'interesting.Venom', 'one', 'favorite', 'villains', 'old', 'cartoon', 'show', 'reduced', 'snotty', 'little', 'teen', 'brat', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'known', 'Foreman', 'kid', '70s', 'Show', 'who', 'made', 'very', 'lame', 'wise-ass', 'remarks', 'even', 'Venom', 'suit', 'Imagine', 'fiendish', 'black', 'muscled', 'creature', 'huge', 'mouth', 'snarling', 'fangs', 'suddenly', 'snipping', 'Oh', 'well', 'look', 'Spiderman', ""'re"", 'douche', 'Obligatory', 'sequel', 'new', 'Goblin', 'form', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'one', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'killing', 'Spiderman', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'ever', 'remotely', 'close', 'Unfortunately', 'victim', 'cliche', 'let', 'talk', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'rather', 'do', 'something', 'efficient', 'stab', 'shoot', 'blow', 'up', 'let', 'just', 'throw', 'things', 'hope', 'bones', 'shatter', 'then', 'up', 'sustaining', 'head', 'injury', 'SHOULD', 'kill', 'normal', 'person', 'memory', 'while', 'then', 'slowly', 'long', 'enough', 'provide', 'film', 'one', 'high', 'point', '-making', 'Spiderman', 'cry', 'when', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'out', 'him.Thus', 'enter', 'Emo', 'Spiderman', 'black', 'venom', 'effect', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'rather', 'make', 'anything', 'remotely', 'wicked', 'sneering', 'emo', 'time', 'venom', 'hold', 'hair', 'eye', 'emo-style', 'acting', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'suave', 'jerking', 'crotch', 'women', 'street', 'dancing', 'wildly', 'local', 'jazz', 'club', 'picking', 'fights', 'people', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'acting', 'classes', 'go', 'can', 'convince', 'new', 'darker', 'Spiderman.Lousy', 'acting', 'dense', 'plot', 'laughably', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'laughably', 'pathetically', 'acted', 'sequel', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'how', 'bad', 'was']",Spider-Man 3

I was so exited to see what the movie was going to look like and to my surprise the movie just fell off high expectations. There are so many problems with the movie I don't even know what to start with.The movie is difficult to follow. It has so many characters that you get mixed up on which storyline you should follow. The writing wasn't so great either. The Scenes?? Well to tell you the truth, I can not take the good out of a movie just because it was bad, I would say the effect where amazing, clearly better than the ones before, but in the end, effects does not make a movie ""good"", there is not one scene that I would say ""Wow, that was an amazing scene"". I remember that in Spider-Man 2 the scene where Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are in the coffee shop and Doc Ock throws a car at them, the picture becomes slow motion, Kristen barely touched the car-- there was nothing like this in the picture, nothing worth really watching for, none of the stories really had an end. Everything was just mixed all over the place.I hope that if they plan on releasing Spider-man 4, they need to think about it, and if they are going to make it this long, please throw some action at us. I would say stick with the action-packed Spiderman, not with the ""heart-broken"" one.

649634,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPFH,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The controversy sparked by my recent raving of a certain Batman movie has caused me to dig up this atrocity and give it another watch.  I had to borrow it from my Spider-Man obsessed brother-in-law for I do not own this movie (nor will I ever).  I think it's important, before I get into discussing why I loathe this movie as I do, to set you up with my feelings going in, so you won't label this a review by a disgruntled Spider-Man hater who expected to rip it apart walking in.  I am not `Team Batman' or something like that; for it is not that simple.  I am simple `Team Good Movie' and this just doesn't fall into that bracket for me.Oh, and MKIA, this is all for you ;-)So, to set things straight; and am a total Spider-Man fan.  Growing up he was my favorite superhero ever and I collected the comics and had all the trading cards and played with the action figures and so when the original `Spider-Man' movie was released I went insane with excitement.  While I felt it was a bit long in areas I totally loved the movie and saw it three times in the theater.  When `Spider-Man 2' was released I bought my tickets almost a week in advance and showed up at the theater an hour early and was blown away by how amazing the movie was.  It was smart and intense and brilliantly directed and acted.  It was the perfect superhero movie, and I still consider it one of the best superhero movies of all time; maybe even the best.  Last year there were a slew of trilogies ending, all of which I was excited over.  `Pirates of the Caribbean' was ending and `Shrek the Third' was being released and of course there was `Spider-Man 3' and of the three this was the one I was most excited over.It was going to be amazing.Since seeing this film I have come to affectionately refer to it as `Spider-Mess 3'.  Okay, so maybe not so affectionately, but whatever.  I will state this before getting into the film also.  I understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character, so don't for one second even begin to conclude that I don't `understand' this hero; I know him very well.  I also know that Venom is one of the darkest characters in the Marvel universe and that the whole symbiote storyline was Spider-Man's darkest hour.  Just know that I know that and you should too before watching this film.My main issue with `Spider-Mess 3' is that it is, well, messy.  There is so much going on that Sam Raimi fails to get a firm grasp on what he is trying to portray.  There are a slew of villains who all have their own agendas but their agendas are all thrown into one pot to stew; and on top of that you have Peter Parker's personal life, which is in shambles, and his relationships with not only Mary Jane and newcomer Gwen Stacy but also his best friend who now wants to kill him because he knows that he is Spider-Man and blames him for his fathers death.  The movie is barely over two-hours which seems like a lot of time, but it isn't if you want to do this story any real justice.  Instead, the film seems rather rushed and thrown together, especially in the ridiculous ending which made me so aggravated I wanted to get up and leave the movie altogether.Like I mentioned earlier, Spider-Man is not a dark character and that is what made the first two movies so delightfully entertaining.  Raimi understood how to take the stylized world of Spider-Man and make it deep and meaningful without making it dark and brooding.  I know that this is not Batman, who has always been a darker character (unless you include the mockeries that have been made of him in the past; i.e. `BAM' and `POW' and Joel Schumacher).  The problem is that Raimi, in this installment, made a mockery of `Spider-Man', ridiculously overplaying the `fun' aspect of the film and sacrificing the intelligence.  There is no balance here.  Stripping the character of all dignity he made the evil of the symbiote play more like a arrogant frat-boy than anything else, making it a joke.  If you take it for comic relief you can justify it, but it deserves no justification.  This was Raimi's chance to explore that dark side to the story, but he opted for the childish way out and failed miserably.Another major issue that I have with this film is the special effects.  `Spider-Man 2' especially was so rich with visuals that I felt walking out that it would never be topped.  It was stunning to watch, mostly because nothing looked like a video game.  It was high speed action from start to finish but it never looked corny or `fake'.  The opening sequence in `Spider-Mess 3' with Spider-Man fighting Harry Osborn through the ally is horrible.  It was so fake looking, like a really poorly made videogame.  My best friend looked at me and rolled his eyes and said ""should he leave now?"" and I wish that I had conceded right then and there.  Even the freefall scene where Spidy rescues Gwen Stacy is horrible animated.  They would have been better off making this a cartoon.  Sure, the imagery of the Sandman is impressive in parts, but the lazy way they went about the ridiculous ending with Sandman looking like Kirby was just aggravatingly bad.  I wanted to bang my head against a wall, but I was in the middle of the theater (always have to sit in the middle) and there was no wall within reach.It was just a mess; thus the name `Spider-Mess'.Thankfully Tobey Maguire (inspired casting if there ever was one) continued to make Peter Parker a three-dimensional character and breathe whatever life he could into this interesting failure.  Kirsten Dunst also continued with some nice character development, and Topher Grace is just wonderful here as Eddie Brock; although it is sad what they did with Venom, making him an afterthought and just discarding him like he wasn't important when he really should have had his own movie.  Thomas Haden Church is decent here, but the film never really gets under his skin.  He's just your token bad guy who is really not so bad.  James Franco is horrible, but he was horrible in the first two also.  People are raving him as an actor now that he was in `Milk' this year, but I have yet to see it so to me he is still a terrible actor.  Bryce Dallas Howard is underwhelming to say the least, but I didn't expect a whole lot.This should have been a great movie, but sadly it isn't even a good one.  It is mediocre at best, and at times that feels like generosity on my part.  Yes, I loathe this messy film; not just because it is just plain bad but also because it ruined what had the potential of being the best `trilogy' of all time.  The first two films built so much promise, but this debacle just threw it all away.I don't have the heart to give it an F so I'll settle for a D.  If it weren't for the acting I would be forced to give it an F, but you can thank Maguire and Dunst (and especially Grace) for that extra star.Will I see `Spider-Man 4' if there ever is one?  Yes.  Will I walk in expecting greatness?  Yes, since Raimi has a lot of atoning to do, and I think he knows it.  Will I be shocked if it turns out to be a nightmare?  Not after this I won't.",2,A complete freefall from greatness...,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,7067,"['controversy', 'sparked', 'recent', 'raving', 'certain', 'Batman', 'movie', 'caused', 'dig', 'up',

For example the sandman, after he's been bombed at, flushed at, shot at, beat at, thrown at.... and still live on to create more destruction, he just SUDDENTLY realized that what he was doing was wrong and then went like: ""I was wrong, okay now I'm gonna go gone with the wind now"" WHAT?!the venom was about the same thing, an invinsible being who is scared of bell sounds???? it's as ridiculous as saying a dragon is scared of the color red. Not convincing at the least.the theme tried to stick to the whole ""superhero can't have girlfriends and normal life thing"" but it still failed. Because the reasons were pretty damn weak: Peter got bad because he was infected by the venom; Mary-Jane breaks up with Peter for saving his life. none of these things actually SHOWS convincingly that superhero CAN'T have a normal life, just that when new villains came, relationship gets screwed up (the venom just HAPPENS to fall where Peter and Mary Jane is, RIIIIGHT)...which doesn't even make much sense.overall this was a huge disappointing follow-up of the last one, which was the best super-hero movie I have ever seen. the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because of its special effects, and Toby dancing of course.",3,disappointingly overdone,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1721,"['Spider', 'man', '3', 'final', 'installment', 'spider', 'man', 'was', 'expected', 'followed', 'footstep', 'X-men', 'Pirates', 'other', 'trilogies', 'wanted', 'end', 'gigantic', 'finish', 'gigantic', 'part', 'was', 'gigantic', 'wrong', 'parts.to', 'start', '2', 'villians', 'do', 'keep', 'entertained', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'writers', 'kept', 'little', 'too', 'big', 'basically', 'made', 'villains', 'nearly', 'invinsible', 'then', 'end', 'gave', 'laughable', 'end-of-villian', 'finish', 'example', 'sandman', 'been', 'bombed', 'flushed', 'shot', 'beat', 'still', 'live', 'create', 'more', 'destruction', 'just', 'SUDDENTLY', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'wrong', 'then', 'went', 'was', 'wrong', 'okay', 'now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'gone', 'wind', 'now', 'WHAT', 'venom', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'invinsible', 'being', 'who', 'scared', 'bell', 'sounds', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'saying', 'dragon', 'scared', 'color', 'red', 'Not', 'convincing', 'least.the', 'theme', 'tried', 'stick', 'whole', 'superhero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'girlfriends', 'normal', 'life', 'thing', 'still', 'failed', 'reasons', 'were', 'pretty', 'damn', 'weak', 'Peter', 'got', 'bad', 'was', 'infected', 'venom', 'Mary-Jane', 'up', 'Peter', 'saving', 'life', 'none', 'things', 'actually', 'SHOWS', 'convincingly', 'superhero', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'just', 'when', 'new', 'villains', 'came', 'relationship', 'screwed', 'up', 'venom', 'just', 'HAPPENS', 'fall', 'where', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'RIIIIGHT', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'much', 'sense.overall', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointing', 'follow-up', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'special', 'effects', 'Toby', 'dancing', 'course']",Spider-Man 3

649638,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B00005JPFH,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[3, 4]","It's triple trouble for Spider-Man in this third installment in the mega franchise.Life is good for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). He's got the girl, about to propose, making bucks, the good people of New York love their Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man like it's their job--yeah, everything is smooth sailing.As if.Suddenly, a mysterious new villain shows up out of nowhere: the New Goblin (though he doesn't refer to himself as such in the film). Quickly, we find out it's Harry Osborne (James Franco), Peter's once best friend out for revenge because he thinks Peter murdered his dad.One villain Peter can handle, especially since his first altercation with the suped-up Harry Osborne ends rather quickly. But no, things quickly get worse for our favorite Wallcrawler when fugitive Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) gets himself trapped in a molecular blaster thingy and becomes the shape-shifting Sandman. Also adding to Peter's troubles is ultra-hungry photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who wants nothing more than to make a name for himself in the newspaper business.Unbeknownst to Peter, while he and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are on a date in a NY park, a mysterious meteor lands from the heavens, leaking a strange black goop that follows Peter home and eventually latches onto him, transforming him into someone darker, meaner and more spider-powered than ever before. When Peter finally realizes his new black suit is slowly destroying his life and he's alienating everyone he's ever cared about, he manages to ditch the suit in a cool church belltower scene that screams Peter's search for redemption, but also Eddie Brock's search for revenge. The black goop lands on Brock, carrying a copy of Peter's spider-powers with it, transforming Eddie into the menacing Venom.It's Black Spider-Man versus three villains in this web-slinging rollercoaster ride that scratches Spider-Man fans right where they itch!The good:The spider effects keep getting better with each installment, especially in the area of you feeling like you're right there with Spider-Man zipping through the air. That scene where Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) falls off that building and Spidey has to cut through the air between falling debris to save her? Pure good.The story had some good twists, especially building up the suspense while we waited for the black symbiote to latch itself onto Peter. Same with Peter proposing to MJ. The whole ""it not working out"" thing was well done.James Franco played the villain wonderfully. I genuinely hated him after a while, the big tip of the hat being to when he fooled Peter into thinking he was his buddy again only to screw him over bigtime later on.Topher Grace was easily the best actor in the film. He was funny, cocky, yet at times you sincerely felt bad for him.The fight scenes were great. The symbiote effects for the living suit were fantastic, too.The ending with Harry Osborne--even after all he did during the film--made tears prick the corners of my eyes.The not as good:One would think a major lesson had been learned from Batman & Robin: too many characters is just plain stupid. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 didn't take that warning to heart. The film had way too much going on. I know they had to wrap up some story threads as established in the first two movies, but when all was said and done, things just felt way too rushed and I know I'm not the only fan to think so. If it were me, I would have left it at two villains: the New Goblin and Sandman. Or just do Venom and leave it alone. (And if anyone knows the Venom story, from the comics or the 1990s Spider-Man cartoon, you know that Venom's mythology is more than enough for a feature film.) I really felt short-changed regarding Venom. So much time was spent building up to him--the origin, Peter going dark, Eddie Brock's character, both before and after he inherits the suit--that by the time Venom showed up, there wasn't much time left in the movie for him to really be the bad guy fans know him to be.There's really not much to complain about with this movie other than it feeling very rushed and cluttered. Over all, it still was a solid flick, but my least favorite of the three.Rumor has it that Spider-Man 4 is getting back to basics so I'm eagerly anticipating that one.Also stars: J.K. Simmons, Bruce Campbell, Rosemary Harris, James Cromwell, Ted Raimi, Bill Nunn, Willem Dafoe, Dylan Baker, Stan Lee and others.A.P.

When the movie is good, it blows me away. The scenes of Sandman is amazing. His introduction was probably one of the best scenes in the entire Spider series. How it was shot, the special effects, the concept and emotion that resonates while he discovers what he's become is a cinematic accomplishment. The first fight scene between Goblin and Spiderman was also amazing. Topher Grace was a great addition in the cast, though Venom came out too late and there wasn't too much of him in the film. The amazing Bruce Campbell cameo is here again and his scenes are longer and funnier.I think that's about it.The movie at some point seem disjointed. Characters and events come and go, and the story doesn't flow as smoothly as the first two movies. I think most of my problems in the film could be solved by editing. For example, when Venom and Sandman met and joined forces, it sort of just happened. The scene was unnecessary. We all know they have a common enemy. Some of Peter's scenes with Aunt May could have been trimmed, they drag the movie and doesn't add much dramatic impact. The scenes of Parker with emo-hair bang dancing in a jazz club was awkward. I don't mind the dancing and the make-up, but the dancing was terrible (shouldn't Spidey be more flexible?).I would say though that I still enjoyed it all in all. Its not the Spidermovie I want it to be, knowing this might be the last from Sam Raimi and his team, but I still enjoyed it. I think its time Sam Raimi puts his ideas into another effort.

Somehow they wrote a script that actually supported all the different characters and gave them each their own space.I saw this in 3D using myTV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-Dand there were loads of scenes in this movie that were just awesome in 3D. The alley chase scene at the beginning. And just before that there's a scene where Peter Parker is swinging in a wide arc around a spire, shooting web bullets at Goblin. It looked fantastic! I had to take the glasses off and back on to keep comparing it! Sandman, in any of his scenes was just perfect. I loved how they had him change sizes and make his fist huge, or when he comes rearing up out of the back of that sand truck, very cool. Also, the climax scene when Spidey, Mary Jane, Venom, Goblin, and Sandman are all fighting in a giant web, and in the half completed skyscraper. That was some good 3d scenes.This was definitely an eyecandy movie. And the heroes and villains were realized, both in emotions, motivations, and CGI to a high degree.But aside from the eye candy, there is actually a lot of story going on here. Peter's struggle with his guilt over his Uncle's death. Sandman's perpetual loser attempts to help his daughter. Even Venom's shallow, selfishness were all completely human and believable actions.This movie was the best of both worlds, over the top complex, beautiful CGI action, and rich emotional storytelling.

But personally, I still think this was a good Spider-Man movie. I will say, however, that this film does not necessarily have the same gripping story that the previous two had. It does make an effort at trying, but I think it tries too hard. I could go on and on by talking about how Venom wasn't good, or how the movie was too long... but the biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that it tries to put too many things in at once.When I say 'things' I mean:1) There were too many villains2) An abrupt and poorly fleshed out love triangle3) Too many story arcsDespite this, the movie still managed to entertain me, and I would never in a million years say this was a bad movie. There were improvements to action and other little things, but the overly complex (or maybe I should say underlycomplex) story was a bit of a negative.Something fans should keep in mind about this film is the director. He had complete creative control over the first two films. However, he did not have that same control that he had with this film. Matter of fact, Venom was never supposed to be in this film. Writers convinced the director that it would be a good idea. The director threw him in for the fans, but at heart, he didn't get to use the character as he saw fit. Matter of fact, I don't remember the director liking Venom's character to begin with, saying that he was 'more inhuman than he prefered'. Fortunately, a Spider-Man 4 and 5 have been confirmed, and the director plans on having total creative control again. With this in mind, I think we can expect the future installments in the series to be more like Spider-Man 1 and 2.",4,"A great Spider-Man film, not perfect however",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,1727,"['gave', 'third', 'entry', 'franchise', '4/5', 'may', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'high', 'understand', 'personally', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'have', 'same', 'gripping', 'story', 'previous', 'two', 'had', 'make', 'effort', 'trying', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'could', 'go', 'talking', 'how', 'Venom', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once.When', 'say', ""'things"", 'mean:1', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'villains2', 'abrupt', 'poorly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'triangle3', 'Too', 'many', 'story', 'arcsDespite', 'movie', 'still', 'managed', 'entertain', 'would', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'were', 'improvements', 'action', 'other', 'little', 'things', 'overly', 'complex', 'maybe', 'should', 'say', 'underlycomplex', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'negative.Something', 'fans', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'director', 'had', 'complete', 'creative', 'control', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'control', 'had', 'film', 'Matter', 'fact', 'Venom', 'was', 'never', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'Writers', 'convinced', 'director', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'director', 'threw', 'fans', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'use', 'character', 'saw', 'fit', 'Matter', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'director', 'liking', 'Venom', 'character', 'begin', 'saying', 'was', ""'more"", 'inhuman', 'prefered', 'Fortunately', 'Spider-Man', '4', '5', 'have', 'been', 'confirmed', 'director', 'having', 'total', 'creative', 'control', 'again', 'mind', 'think', 'can', 'expect', 'future', 'installments', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'Spider-Man', '1', '2']",Spider-Man 3

The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.But no...Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire,The Good German) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (Tristan and Isolde); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily ""more,"" if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud!It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (Elizabethtown) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as ""the bad one.""

They crammed too many half-developed themes into a movie with too many characters doing too many things that mostly don't get resolved (or not resolved well). Individual scenes in the film are good (e.g. the birth of Sandman, the final fight) but these scenes just did not mesh well with the others. Poor editing did not help either. The scene-stealer in this one is Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom. His character is a perfect blend of the Brock characters from Amazing S-Man and Ultimate S-Man and Grace plays it with style. I would recommend the movie to die-hard fans and people who just want to watch a movie with a lot of interesting CG fight scenes. If you are looking for another Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2, you won't find it here.The DVD: Tons of little featurettes dominate this 2-disc set. Each one spends a lot of time discussing the details of the CG and special effects processes which proves just how reliant the filmakers were on gimmicks instead of a coherent script. The 3 main featurettes focus on each villain. The interviews with the actors are good because you can see that they enjoy the characters they play. There is a trailer gallery that includes tv spots from different countries, an interesting addition (especially the German Venom-fest). There are two commentaries: 1)the producers/filmakers talk mostly about technical aspects of the film and pat each other on the back; 2)Sam Raimi and the main cast discuss there roles in the film. This latter commentary is entertaining since the cast has great chemistry together and crack plenty of jokes. The most glaring flaw in this (as with other S-Man DVDs) is the lack of deleted/alternate scenes. This is a shame because there were plenty of great scenes removed from the theatrical cut (read the novelization or scope the internet for details).I would recommend the 2-disc set for die-hard Spider-Fans only.

649652,A2IGYM7K8MFJRC,B00005JPFH,Bo stergaard Jepsen,"[4, 5]","The newest installment of the Spiderman franchise promised a lot, and actually kept a lot, but not all.The production values of ""Spiderman 3"" are, as we've come to expect, fantastic. The visual effects are stunning, the fights interesting and exilarating, the sound amazing, very well casted and well acted. It just goes on where the first and the second movie let off.""Spiderman 3"" is by far the funniest of the three movies, and at the same time also by far the darkest. The comedy ranges from J Jonah Jamesons rantings and Bruce Campbells cameo part as in the previous two movies to a physical and circumstantial comedy when Peter Parker finds his ""badass"" self which is unlike anything in the first two films. The dark side of the film is, as the tagline tells us, Parkers struggle within. We see him go from confident (where he's just a bit infatuated with himself) to bordering cocky (where his loveaffair with himself gets more heated) and finally to an arrogant bastard (where he's deeply in love with himself). The story of Harry/the Green Goblin also develops even further with Harrys deepening madness and love/hate relationship with Peter Parker, which makes a very interesting storyline. Also of course we see the rise of venom, one of the darkest and most twisted characters in the Marvel universe.It's not all a dance on roses though. First of all, with all those bad guys in play, they each don't get the attetion they deserve. There's not enough character development, and not enough ""action time"" for the baddies. They do it as well as can be done with the amount of time available. I don't think there's much that could have been improved in the film in this respect except for cutting out one of the characters (which in my opinion is what should've been done). They cleverly avoid the trap of ""X Men 3"", where it's all just a big confused mess though. We do get to know the characters, just not well enough.The character of Sandman, well played as it is, is a bit reminiscent of Doctor Octopus in the second film. It's hard to be convinced that he's truly a bad fellow. The biggest problem, characterwise though, is Venom. He gets very short time to develop and therefore seem as just another henchman or such, not really a main bad character. I think the best way to give him room to develop and still make him a main bad guy, was to have the creation of him in this film and then use him in a possible fourth. Also his voice is all wrong.Apart from the character/time problems, there's also a problem with one of the scenes. As Peter Parker grows more and more arrogant we see him develop in a very funny way. The way he walks, talks and acts all change in a hillarious way. The culmination of this change, a dance number in a nightclub, is sadly not up to par. It was, as another reviewer remarked, truly worthy of ""the Mask"", but not Spiderman.I still give this film 5 stars because it is pure entertainment and there are some very good comedy in there. The images alone are enough of a reason to see ""Spiderman 3"", but there is so much more to be had from it.I'm a long time fan of the comic so I guess, I may be a bit biased in my views, but still I would say that this film is highly recommendable.

649655,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JPFH,Brian Conway,"[2, 4]","Undoubtedly the first thought to come to many people's minds after viewing Spider-Man 3, the latest installment in the adventures of everyone's favorite web-slinger, is ""How?"" How, indeed, could Sam Raimi and company, the same team that infused the first two Spider-Man movies with such wit and humanity, have screwed up so, so badly? After kicking things off with an excellent origin story and following it with the amazing, spellbinding action and character development of the sequel, it seemed like Spider-Man 3 was bound to not only equal the high-water mark of Spider-Man 2 but in all likelihood surpass it. Perhaps such titanic expectations are unfair but after making what is widely considered the best super-hero movie ever the filmmakers would be hard-pressed to garner that sort of praise again. So where exactly does it all ""go wrong"" for Spider-Man 3?The movie starts with everything going right for Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire)--he's been given the key to the city, he's going to propose to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his best friend Harry (James Franco) doesn't hate him anymore. Things start to sour when it is discovered that Flint Marko, a.k.a. the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), was Uncle Ben's real killer. Naturally, Peter wants revenge and as luck would have it he's got a brand new black suit (which amplifies his aggression, bringing out his ""dark side"") to help him beat Marko. Before he knows what's happening to him, Peter succumbs to the dark power of the symbiote and makes decisions he will quickly regret. After losing his sense of identity and his relationship with Mary Jane, Peter decides he needs to face the darkness within and make things right again.The concept is sound but even at a lengthy 139 minutes there's a lot of things wrong here that should have been fixed. To start with, the script is nowhere near as tight as those of the previous two chapters. The reason the scripts for the first two movies worked so well was that the action was so tightly woven into Peter's inner turmoil and stressful life. After confronting enemies and personal problems he couldn't seem to beat (and enduring conveniently relevant lectures from Aunt May), Peter was able to learn important life lessons that helped him overcome whatever might have been plaguing him throughout the films. And while Raimi strives for Peter to learn forgiveness this time around the message doesn't stick like it did with the first two--it simply gets lost in the impersonal action-fest unfolding on screen. Of course, it doesn't help things feel more connected when the majority of the plot development rests on coincidence either; for example, the symbiote landing a few feet away from Peter, Flint Marko stumbling into a particle accelerator to become the Sandman, and a revelation from Harry's butler are just a few. Things are established or resolved in a manner so convenient that it's hard not to scoff. It seems screenwriters Alvin Sargent and Sam & Ivan Raimi were so busy cramming all the new characters in that they couldn't squeeze in the simplest of logical explanations. The selection of new characters brought on for Spider-Man 3 is excellent but what's unfortunate about the concentration on new faces is that none of them are properly developed. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), the freshest characters here, are on the screen for all of ten minutes. Stacy serves no other function than to make Mary Jane jealous and keep her at a distance from Peter for the length of the movie. Topher Grace is effortless as Eddie Brock and his performance is a joy to watch but there is so little screen time for him that the audience isn't even given a chance to explore his fascinating character, let alone the monster that he becomes. Venom is the most wildly successful villain in Spidey's entire rogues gallery so the fact that Venom is barely in the movie (and works as little more than a metaphor) will come as a huge disappointment to many fans of the comic series. The Sandman, on the other hand, is a sligthly more successful adaptation. He has a done-to-death back-story about a normal guy with bad luck but Raimi and Church humanize Sandman just enough to make him more than the career criminal he was originally. Had Sandman been the primary villain here, with Harry's storyline kept in tact and Venom saved for a fourth chapter, the screen time for all the newcomers could have been shared much more effectively, providing a narrative structure closer to Spider-Man 2. What audiences get instead is an unfocused plot weighed down by wonderful characters that were tragically underwritten.While the majority of the problems with Spider-Man 3 are the result of a subpar script, it's the smaller moments that will make or break the film for most audiences. These scenes consist of a Saturday Night Fever homage, Peter's moody emo hair and eyeliner, two songs by Mary Jane, and a jazzy dance number. It can be said that none of these moments fit with the previously created universe and only exacerbate the numerous problems this movie already has. On the other hand, one can just as easily argue that these ""laughably bad"" moments were designed to be just that--Peter Parker is such a geek that his idea of being ""the bad boy"" consists of having hair combed over one eye, thick eyeliner and black suits then whispering ""Now dig on this"" and one-upping his ex in a dance number straight from West Side Story. These bits uncompromisingly dance the razor's edge between the humorous and the ridiculous and, at the very least, credit is due to Sam Raimi for defying the sylistic trademarks expected of a Sam Raimi film and being bold enough to explore new territory. Whether these explorations work or not depends entirely on the mindset of the viewer.Thankfully, there are still some undeniably good, even exciting, things in Spider-Man 3. Seeing these stories and characters back on the big screen alone is worth the price of admission. After having invested so much time and money and emotions into this tangled web of relationships it is great to see them at it again. Peter and Harry's on-again, off-again antagonism starts out strong in the beginning of the movie with an intense action sequence to kick things off and just keeps on going. Their arc has been the strongest through the trilogy and getting to see Franco in full-on bad guy mode is a blast. Their conflict finally gets resolved here albeit in a way that is both poignant and predictable. Then there's the excellent comedic bits that have made the Spider-Man movies so enjoyable in the past--Bruce Campbell once again makes the most hilarious cameo of the movie as a charmingly sycophantic matre d', J.K. Simmons (as usual) steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, and even Toby Maguire is given a chance to really flex his comedic muscle. Spider-Man 3, with it's enormous budget, also has the most convincing shots of Spider-Man soaring through New York's skyline and more impressive fight sequences than ever before. If the bigger-than-life action spectaculars aren't as intense and personal as those found in the first two movies, then it can at least be said they are on par with the most epic battles of good-vs-evil to be released on the silver screen.Spider-Man 3 is likely to make its audience as conflicted as its title character. The series has always been ambitious but this time the script overshoots its reach. It's a simple case of quatity over quality, a fault quite common in summer blockbusters and sequels. That's not to say that Spider-Man 3 is a bad movie. There is a lot to enjoy here for fans and casual viewers alike--the talented cast and crew, the fantastic visual effects, the complex relationships--but an unfortunate case of sequelitis bogs down Spider-Man 3, making it the weakest chapter in the Spider-Man saga thus far. Hopefully when the inevitable sequel comes around the filmmakers attached will be smart enough to scale their efforts back a bit and put a greater focus on all that made this series great in the first place.",3,Spider-Man 3 (3 Stars),1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,8097,"['Undoubtedly', 'first', 'thought', 'come', 'many', 'people', 'minds', 'viewing', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'latest', 'installment',

I think it's because I just couldn't believe Mr. Vegan attitude problem Tobey as my beloved Spiderman. It wasn't enough that he is just not convincing as any sort of hero, he also really cannot carry these movies on his mediocre acting shoulders. He isn't handsome, not even ""goofy"" handsome, his voice is akin to a 12 year old boy, and hearing it come out of Spiderman's mask makes me weep. Now they make this 3rd movie and it's as if the powers that be really wanted to make sure they ended on the worst note possible.MJ (Dunst) and Peter (Maguire) have no chemistry, they never did. Her and Harry (Franco) actually do, and he is the more captivating character and actor than the lead. They make MJ an off Broadway actress, and Spidey is of course saving the city, but these kids aren't happy. She bombs, and he is now obsessed with finding his uncles ""real"" killer Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, or ""SandCGI"" as I call him.  Harry is bent on revenge still for his father's death, that he blames Peter for. That is the whole plotline right there. Oh wait, there is a meteorite that crashes conveniently next to Peter and out comes CGI black ooze that turns poor Peter into EmoVenom.  Apparently this ooze, like the Pink ectoplasm in Ghostbusters 2 likes people who are angry, sad or just in need of a new hairstyle. Being forced to watch Tobey try to act ....dark...was so very painful. The outfit, the hair, the eyeliner, the demanding of ""more milk and cookies"" never has there been a darker character on film, ever. (rolls eyes)The big ending with Brock Venom (who's fake teeth couldn't have looked faker)  and SandCGI, with MJ in peril again (and by the way all her screams? Taken from previous spiderman movies, she didn't want to do them again) was as lame as could be.

It would be great seeing Peter have to fight Sandman with that guilt on his shoulders too.So Sandman is just going to fly around for the rest of his life and rip people off and Spiderman is okay with that at the end?Why have Harry make Mary Jane break up with Peter if that was never going to come back into play at the end with Harry saying, ""I'm sorry,"" and Mary Jane confessing what had happened. I mean they were so giddy to talk about their feelings throughout, why stop there?I think it would have been better to have Harry find a way to make Peter break up with Mary Jane so Peter would have that hanging on his shoulders too.Also at the end, since Eddie/Venom is pissed that Peter ""stole"" his girl (actually Eddie and Gwen only had one date briefly mentioned in a throwaway bit of dialogue so they weren't actually going out) why not have both Mary Jane and Gwen hanging from the rooftops at the end so Peter would really have to make a choice and Mary Jane would be shown that Peter truly loves her.And yes, Venom is handled so fast, so abruptly that one is left with wondering why he is in the movie at all. I mean there are other characters in this series who are supposed to turn into villians too but they haven't so far, so it would been better to just have Eddie in this film and transform him in a later film.Overall, I was entertained but this is the weakest in the series so far as a film.",4,Spiderman is coming to the plate... two Strikes and three balls and bases are loaded,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,1619,"['Spoilers', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'watching', 'then', 'was', 'over', 'several', 'things', 'began', 'bother', 'me.If', 'one', 'going', 'have', 'Harry', 'die', 'end', 'why', 'not', 'have', 'just', 'die', 'ally', 'fight', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'seeing', 'Peter', 'have', 'fight', 'Sandman', 'guilt', 'shoulders', 'too.So', 'Sandman', 'just', 'going', 'fly', 'rest', 'life', 'rip', 'people', 'Spiderman', 'okay', 'end', 'Why', 'have', 'Harry', 'make', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'break', 'up', 'Peter', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'play', 'end', 'Harry', 'saying', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'confessing', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'mean', 'were', 'so', 'giddy', 'talk', 'feelings', 'why', 'stop', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'Harry', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'Peter', 'break', 'up', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'would', 'have', 'hanging', 'shoulders', 'too.Also', 'end', 'Eddie/Venom', 'pissed', 'Peter', 'stole', 'girl', 'actually', 'Eddie', 'Gwen', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'date', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'throwaway', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'were', ""n't"", 'actually', 'going', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'have', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Gwen', 'hanging', 'rooftops', 'end', 'so', 'Peter', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'Peter', 'truly', 'loves', 'her.And', 'yes', 'Venom', 'handled', 'so', 'fast', 'so', 'abruptly', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'mean', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'turn', 'villians', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'have', 'Eddie', 'film', 'transform', 'later', 'film.Overall', 'was', 'entertained', 'weakest', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'film']",Spider-Man 3

This one ties in two villans into one movie: The Sandman, and Venom. Also it has the Black Spiderman in this movie as well. I agree with JR Pinto's review believing that was a little too much with the movie and overdoing it. However I don't find that a problem at all since it was most likely going to be the last movie of the series, and everything tied into each other very well.With all of the events and villians appearing in the movie, it was very hard to fit everyone into a two hour movie. Not saying that it wasn't done, but it was very difficult. Many people (like myself) will probably forget that The Sandman will be part of the movie, because he dissapears for a while and so much is inside of the gam (Mary Jane breakups, the Black Spiderman suit). In fact, there are a lot of gaps in the movie that some people may forget, and may think that it appeared out of nowhere. As for the villians, it seems like each movie they want to do the same thing, hold Mary Jane suspended from a very high point and have Spiderman come and rescue her, just like every superhero is supposed to.Favorite parts will have to be when Peter Parker wears the Black Spiderman suit. That alone looks nice. A few action scenes are enjoyable like the fights between Peter Parker/Spiderman and Harry Osborne/New Goblin. The end of the movie is kind of nice though as most of this movie ties into Spiderman 1. Spiderman fans will be happy for this one despite the clutterness of the movie. I recommend you check this out. I myself can't wait for this to come on DVD (I want the bundle pack too!!!). An action packed movie will more than likely satisfy your needs. Peace!Spider-Man 4???

His confidence in his powers has returned, and New York City is awash in SpiderMania; he's acing his college courses, and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom he has loved since grade school, finally recognizes and returns his love.  But there are flies in the ointment still.  His lifelong friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spidey for his father's death, now knows that Spidey and Peter are one and the same, and has also discovered that the senior Osborn was the Green Goblin; with the Goblin's mask and sky-sled he's about to unveil himself as the New Goblin.  Peter is confronted with an ambitious rival photographer (Topher Grace) for J. Jonah Jameson's (J. K. Simmons) Daily Bugle.  And the police discover that his Uncle Ben was not killed by the con they had thought responsible, but by another, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who has recently escaped from prison and been transformed to a new super-villain, the Sandman.  On top of all this, a small meteoroid that lands unnoticed near the Lover's Lane where Peter and MJ are enjoying a quiet moment together proves to have a hitchhiker--a symbiotic alien lifeform that takes possession of Peter and magnifies all his less attractive qualities.  Besides the usual wonderful SFX (including a splendid sequence featuring an out-of-control crane crashing into a skyscraper) and Marvel angst, this concluding (so far) film in the Spidey franchise has as its theme the importance of making choices.  Will bad reviews of one of her parts push MJ into abandoning her dreams of Broadway success?  Will Peter let the symbiote continue to control him even after he knows what it is and sees what it's making him do?  Will he seek revenge against Marko as he did against Ben's supposed murderer?  Will Harry Osborn agree to help him rescue MJ from the Sandman, or be willing to sacrifice even the girl he once loved for the sake of his revenge?  Even Marko shows an unexpected side of his nature in a climactic scene between himself and Spidey.

I went along the timeline of the film and wrote down the times that storylines popped in and how much of each there was... Here is what I found:In a 2:19:00 movie. The venom storyline, apart from the slambang finale that was actually really good, consisted of a :38 scene, an :08 scene, a 2:15 scene, a 3:50 scene, a 2:55 scene and a :42 scene, adding up to 10:28. 10:28? To boot, the venom storyline doesn't take off until the 1:03:40 point of the movie.The Sandman storyline consists of 15:32 of film time. Dramatic scenes and everything.There was 25:57 worth of action scenes, including Goblin, Venom & Sandman... other than the finale, which was slightly less than 22 minutes.1:10:40 of the film was reserved for the romance storyline and other random dramas, like friendship and photography. Peter wanting to ask Mary Jane to marry him. Them going out to dinner. Peter making a jerk of himself at a club she's singing at. Peter telling his Aunt that he's gonna ask her. Peter dancing around like something out of Saturday Night Fever. Rehashing the old storyline of how his Uncle died. Harry Osborn and Mary Jane cooking omelets and dancing around. Mary Jane being replaced from her Broadway show.The 1:10:40 doesn't even include the dramatic scenes that involve Sandman and his plight to save his daughter.Ultimately, the movie has a terrible, no, 'terrible' is too generous, DEPLORABLE flow. Personally, I wanted to see more venom. Yet, I got a little more than 10 minutes of venom in 1:57:00 of movie time and had to wait until the 1:03:40 point for him to materialize. Action scenes were few and far between. Two minute action scenes were broken up by long scenes of emotional baggage.I want so badly to give this movie more than 2 stars. The action scenes, when they happen are really really good. Yet, for the life of me, I can't understand why the creators of this film skimped so much on action. They've made TONS and TONS of money with this trilogy. You'd think that they'd try and reward the viewers who have made them FILTHY RICH... yet, it seemed as though they were filming on a budget...So, bottom line... if you don't mind SPIDERMAN 3... the soap opera, you'll love this movie. If you wanted to see Venom, and lots of him, you'll be tremendously disappointed. Ultimately, there were too many storylines, and you'd think that these filmmakers would have learned a lesson from the original Batman movies. Apparently... they didn't.",2,Why I HATED Spiderman 3,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2609,"['Bottom', 'line', 'heck', 'even', 'kids', 'are', 'bored', 'thing.To', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'SPIDERMAN', '3', 'was', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', 'had', 'break', 'down', 'went', 'timeline', 'film', 'wrote', 'down', 'times', 'storylines', 'popped', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'Here', 'what', 'found', '2:19:00', 'movie', 'venom', 'storyline', 'apart', 'slambang', 'finale', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'consisted', ':38', 'scene', ':08', 'scene', '2:15', 'scene', '3:50', 'scene', '2:55', 'scene', ':42', 'scene', 'adding', 'up', '10:28', '10:28', 'boot', 'venom', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', '1:03:40', 'point', 'movie.The', 'Sandman', 'storyline', '15:32', 'film', 'time', 'Dramatic', 'scenes', 'everything.There', 'was', '25:57', 'worth', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'Goblin', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'other', 'finale', 'was', 'slightly', 'less', '22', 'minutes.1:10:40', 'film', 'was', 'reserved', 'romance', 'storyline', 'other', 'random', 'dramas', 'friendship', 'photography', 'Peter', 'wanting', 'ask', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'marry', 'Them', 'going', 'dinner', 'Peter', 'making', 'jerk', 'club', 'singing', 'Peter', 'telling', 'Aunt', 'gon', 'ask', 'Peter', 'dancing', 'something', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Rehashing', 'old', 'storyline', 'how', 'Uncle', 'died', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'cooking', 'omelets', 'dancing', 'around', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'being', 'replaced', 'Broadway', 'show.The', '1:10:40', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Sandman', 'plight', 'save', 'daughter.Ultimately', 'movie', 'terrible', ""'terrible"", 'too', 'generous', 'DEPLORABLE', 'flow', 'Personally', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'venom', 'got', 'little', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'venom', '1:57:00', 'movie', 'time', 'had', 'wait', '1:03:40', 'point', 'materialize', 'Action', 'scenes', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'Two', 'minute', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'broken', 'up', 'long', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'baggage.I', 'want', 'so', 'badly', 'give', 'movie', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'action', 'scenes', 'when', 'happen', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'creators', 'film', 'skimped', 'so', 'much', 'action', ""'ve"", 'made', 'TONS', 'TONS', 'money', 'trilogy', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'try', 'reward', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'FILTHY', 'RICH', 'yet', 'seemed', 'were', 'filming', 'budget', 'So', 'bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'SPIDERMAN', '3', 'soap', 'opera', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'Venom', 'lots', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tremendously', 'disappointed', 'Ultimately', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'storylines', ""'d"", 'think', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'lesson', 'original', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Apparently', 'did', ""n't""]",Spider-Man 3
649675,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPFH,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]","What set the ""Spider-Man"" films apart from many other superhero films was a delicate balance between comic book action and emotion, between high tech special effects and human drama. In this regard, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" is in no way a departure from the first two films; it remains on perfectly equal ground, presenting a story that carefully combines frenetic fight sequences, grandiose science fiction, and an emotional roller coaster. I don't dare assume that this is the best film in the series, nor can I claim that it's the greatest superhero film ever made. What I can say is that, like its predecessors, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a fun movie that is sure to entertain those who are willing to experience it.The first major scene has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) lying on a giant spider web in the middle of a park, staring up at the night sky. The romantic aspect plays itself to the fullest, and rightfully so; the emotional core of the story depends on their love and possible engagement, which will be tested in more ways than one. The first test arrives on a rogue meteorite that crash-lands in the park (where it came from is never explained, but I suppose it doesn't really matter); a viscous, shape shifting black goo emerges from its smoldering cocoon. It then attaches itself to Parker's motorbike and follows him home, where it waits. For what is not yet known, but if there's one thing to be sure about in this kind of film, it's that anything from outer space--especially a dark sludge--most likely means trouble.The second test is Spider-Man's fame, which is putting a strain on Parker and M.J.'s relationship. It seems to be going to Parker's head lately, and it shows during an award ceremony (Spidey is given the key to the city for his heroic acts). He swings into the crowd and high-fives a number of kids before doing gymnastics on the stage. He then hangs upside down and asks the presenter--Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard)--to kiss him like M.J. did in the first movie. It was never meant to be romantic; it was only for the sake of publicity. Nonetheless, M.J. is not at all amused. Parker is unconsciously pushing her away to keep his Spider-Man image strong, which doesn't exactly boost her self-confidence. It doesn't help that her dream of staring in a Broadway musical is shattered; the critics have a field day attacking her singing voice, and she's fired from the production.The third test is Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict. Because of a scientific accident only possible in a comic book adaptation, his molecular structure has been altered into grains of sand. At will, he can change from a solid man into the gritty monster Sandman; he can even meld with other forms of earth and make himself gigantic. But what exactly are his motives? I ask this because he was crafted as a sympathetic character: despite having done bad things to people, his only concern is the well being of his young daughter, who's apparently quite ill (with what is never revealed). What makes the situation worse is that he was responsible for the death of Parker's uncle. This ignites a rage within Parker, and it only gets stronger when the black space slime finally makes contact. Not only does it attach itself to his Spider suit, turning it black, it also intensifies Parker's aggression and fuels his hatred. It also makes him arrogant during normal daily life, an aspect that's more comical than serious.The fourth test is rival photographer, Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace), who threatens Parker's position at the ""Daily Bugle."" Loud-mouthed Editor in Chief J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) offers a desk job to anyone who can capture an incriminating photo of Spider-Man; this paves the way for a number of circumstances that eventually turn Brock and Parker into bitter enemies. I distinctly remember a scene in a church, in which Brock prays that God murder Parker. How heavy-handed for a superhero story: it could have been humorous had the atmosphere not been so intense. And it gets even more intense when he comes into contact with a bit of the black space goo; it turns him into the vile super villain known as Venom.The fifth and final test is Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose rage over the death of his father is deepening. Having since discovered the true identity of Spider-Man, he now vows to destroy Peter Parker, his former best friend. Not only does he fight with Parker as the New Goblin, he also forces M.J. to break up with Parker. At this point in the story, it's becomes obvious that revenge is the main theme. Granted, this isn't an original idea (consider ""Batman""). However, hidden beneath the vengeful layers is the possibility of forgiveness, and that alone made this film a lot more enjoyable. By the time we get to the climactic battle at a construction site (reminiscent of Raimi's own ""Darkman""), the audience will discover who can let go of the past and who will remain stuck in the depths of hate.And yes, they'll be treated to a number of impressive battle sequences, all of which rely heavily on computer generated imagery. I purposely avoided elaborating on this; despite being prominently featured, ""Spider-Man 3"" is about more than its eye candy; it's about balancing its eye candy with its human story. Generally speaking, it worked quite well (I exempt a dance sequence at a jazz club; talk about unnecessary). In fact, the entire ""Spider-Man"" series worked quite well, and with that, I have only one more thing to say: if you liked the first two, you'll definitely like the third.",4,The Dark Side of the

When i was sitting in the theatre waiting for the 3rd movie to begin, i was expecting something totally spectaculer that would blow me away. But i was extremely disappointed.The problem with spidey 3 is it lacks content. The first and second had in depth looks at the characters, but this one didn't as much. The biggest problem was the number of villains. It made the story seem somewhat unorganized and thrown together. It's also clear that Tobey Maguire is loosing intrest in his role as peter parker/spider man.Another problem was the way spider man was out numbered in the end. If it wasn't for Harry coming and saving him there would have been flattened spidey peices everywhere. They should have called it spider man 3 and in brackets: ""new goblin"" A real hero would have been able to take on everyone at once. But what would have been better would be if spiderman had taken on each villain one at a time, instead of all at once, although it did make it more of an intense sequence at the end.What the movie lacks in story it makes up for in visuals. The cgi is well done, especially for venom and sandman. Also the way the venom moves is quite intresting.Another thing i missed from the first 2 was spideys web slinging. He hardly ever swings from building to building, but that may be because Raimi figured spider man had done enough of that in the first 2.I gave this movie 3 stars because it doesn't have a great plot, but good cgi. I think because this movie was not as successful as the first 2, there might not be a 4th. Although i would like to see the lizard before they finish making the spider man movies.

Not outright terrible by any means but it just is; it doesn't transcend the genre and go from a good comic book movie to a great movie period like 2 was but rather this was just entertaining but not consistently.The film starts out with Peter Parker/Spider-Man happy as can be with a great girlfriend with Mary Jane who's on Broadway and Peter thinking about proposing. But the attention gets to Peter's head and he becomes a little arrogant and oblivious to certain problems which gets worse when Harry Osborne, furious with the knowledge Parker may be responsible for his father's death, is coming after him.As if they're needed to be more problems, escaped convict Flint Marko, the now-prime suspect in Uncle Ben's murder, has been mutated thanks to an experiment and can change his body's composition to mimic sand. Then of course there's Eddie Brock with a mind for being New York's top photographer, and a strange substance that latches onto Peter and turns him into something no one wants him to be.PHEW! Man it was tough writing all that because as most people have already said, this film is stuffed to the point where the button its pants would fly off and hit someone in the face by now. There's just way too much going on from storylines to villains to scenes and set-pieces yet at the same time the film doesn't have the strong pacing the second film had which is odd to say the least. Each storyline in essence deserves its own film so to boil it all down to one 2 hour 13 minute movie makes it too scattered. Then of course there's individual scenes (I highly suggest skipping chapter 36 to make the film run much smoother) to dialogue, handling of ""emo Peter"" complete with Conor Oberst haircut to the introduction of Gwen Stacy which seems to be written in as if to say to Spider-Man fans ""see? we have Gwen too, now watch us"".However, the effects, save a few scenes have definately gotten better, and the slightly darker tone is quite appropriate and even welcome and of course the action scenes are just as awesome as they should be. And despite the awful dialogue (at times), the actors do at least do a respectable job with their roles like Thomas Haden Church as Marko/Sandman and even Topher Grace, an oddball choice, is actually good at playing Brock. This is the kind of film where there's enough great parts but it comes after bad or even laughable parts so you're kind of glad there's at least something good in it.It's obviously not the worst comic book movie; what with Ghost Rider, Elektra and the Punisher out there but in a strange way, this is like the Batman Forever of the franchise: it's watchable sure but man, problems are coming out of its pores.",3,3.5; A film too big even for New York,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,3149,"['local', 'theatre', 'only', 'one', 'screen', 'so', 'movies', 'eventually', 'get', 'shown', 'several', 'weeks', 'even', 'month', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'strange', 'rarity', 'when', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'World', 'End', 'where', 'shown', 'same', 'time', 'everyone', 'else', 'got', 'So', 'rather', 'watching', 'film', 'month', 'later', 'disappointment', 'negative', 'comments', 'discovered', 'along', 'everyone', 'else', 'third', 'Spidey', 'installment', 'was', 'just', 'iffy', 'Not', 'outright', 'terrible', 'means', 'just', ""n't"", 'transcend', 'genre', 'go', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'period', '2', 'was', 'rather', 'was', 'just', 'entertaining', 'not', 'consistently.The', 'film', 'out', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'happy', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'who', 'Broadway', 'Peter', 'thinking', 'proposing', 'attention', 'Peter', 'head', 'little', 'arrogant', 'oblivious', 'certain', 'problems', 'worse', 'when', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'furious', 'knowledge', 'Parker', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'coming', 'him.As', ""'re"", 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'problems', 'escaped', 'convict', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'now-prime', 'suspect', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'murder', 'been', 'mutated', 'thanks', 'experiment', 'can', 'change', 'body', 'composition', 'mimic', 'sand', 'Then', 'course', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'mind', 'being', 'New', 'York', 'top', 'photographer', 'strange', 'substance', 'Peter', 'something', 'one', 'be.PHEW', 'Man', 'was', 'tough', 'writing', 'that', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'film', 'stuffed', 'point', 'where', 'button', 'pants', 'would', 'fly', 'off', 'hit', 'someone', 'face', 'now', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'storylines', 'villains', 'scenes', 'set-pieces', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'pacing', 'second', 'film', 'had', 'odd', 'say', 'least', 'storyline', 'essence', 'own', 'film', 'so', 'boil', 'down', 'one', '2', 'hour', '13', 'minute', 'movie', 'too', 'scattered', 'Then', 'course', 'individual', 'scenes', 'highly', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'chapter', '36', 'make', 'film', 'run', 'much', 'smoother', 'dialogue', 'handling', 'emo', 'Peter', 'complete', 'Conor', 'Oberst', 'haircut', 'introduction', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'be', 'written', 'as', 'say', 'Spider-Man', 'fans', 'see', 'have', 'Gwen', 'too', 'now', 'watch', '.However', 'effects', 'save', 'few', 'scenes', 'have', 'definately', 'gotten', 'better', 'slightly', 'darker', 'tone', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'even', 'welcome', 'course', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'awesome', 'should', 'be', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'times', 'actors', 'do', 'least', 'do', 'respectable', 'job', 'roles', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Marko/Sandman', 'even', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'oddball', 'choice', 'actually', 'good', 'playing', 'Brock', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'enough', 'great', 'parts', 'bad', 'even', 'laughable', 'parts', ""'re"", 'kind', 'glad', 'least', 'something', 'good', 'it.It', 'obviously', 'not', 'worst', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'what', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Elektra', 'Punisher', 'there', 'strange', 'way', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'franchise', 'watchable', 'sure', 'man', 'problems', 'are', 'coming', 'pores']",Spider-Man 3

Crawford ""shadowgmrlrd9""","[2, 3]","The basic reasons why this movie is hated on so much can be summed up like this:Peter's dance routine(s)High number of villainsMixed feelings over Topher Grace as Edward Brock Jr. aka Venom.Cut me a BREAK. First off, I and a lot of people found Peter's dancing routine funny; it reflected his now-dark, arrogant lifestyle; normal Peter Parker never would act like that, thinking he was all that and openly flaunting his arrogance.People complain about there being 3 villains in this. Seriously? I thought it was awesome seeing Venom and the Sandman teaming up, and the New Goblin doesn't really stay a villain too long, he's mostly there to complete the story arc of the Green Goblin, his father, from the first one. Having multiple villains in a movie isn't a new concept for super-hero movies or super-hero ANYTHING. I thought it worked well, seriously, tell me how the movie suffers from 3 villains.As for Topher Grace, eh, I guess I can kind of see why some people wouldn't like him. For my 2 cents, I always thought he looked a little like Toby McGuire in ""That 70's Show"" with his haircut, so I thought he was okay as Spider-Man's ""evil twin"" in this movie.As for everything else, seeing Peter Parker battle his own inner-demons personified in Venom is very interesting, and he suddenly snaps under the tension of everything he's going through. It's a very dark journey for Spider-Man. The whole movie's plot is interconnected revenge; Harry Osborn, the New Goblin, wants revenge on Peter for killing his father, Peter wants revenge on the Sandman for killing his Uncle Ben, and by the end Sandman and Venom both want revenge on Peter. Harry and Peter have to set aside their demons to work together and save Mary Jane, who was caught up in all this.Loved this movie, and it seemed like a lot of people did when I first watched it.

No. But, as a comic book film, it doesn't have to be (and, likely, it simply constitutionally could not be, for it is based on an art form for juveniles). Still, it's significantly better than its critics claimed, and this is likely because there is a tendency to subconsciously anticipate failure in such a successful series.

It's a fun film.Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long?

There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear.

649686,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JPFH,Craig Matteson,"[1, 3]","If you view this movie as a Spidey versus a Super villain flick, the story is too cluttered and seems confusing.  James Franco is back as Harry Osborn and the New Goblin trying to avenge his father's death against Spiderman / Peter Parker.  Then there is a story revision from the first movie (not uncommon in comic books) that the guy we thought killed Uncle Ben didn't, it was Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who was trying to raise money for his sick daughter.  On top of that, a new photographer has come to the Daily Bugle to expose Spiderman as a bad guy.  This is music to J. Jonah Jameson's ears, so Parker loses income he badly needs to a kid who is trying to do him in rather than just report what actually happened.  The conflict between Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and Peter Parker is the core of the film, but it takes awhile to really gather some steam.  On top of all this there is some kind of living goo that crashed to Earth in a meteor and it is after Peter / Spidey, too.So, is that enough stuff for one film?  Oh, yeah, there is also the love relationship between Peter and Mary Jane that has to undergo a crisis in the film.  And it is closer to this relationship that the real point of the film lies.  This is really a story about Peter Parker becoming a man and having to choose what kind of person he will be.  The huge cast of characters are there to present Spiderman with complex choices.  Will Peter choose the self-indulgent path, give up, or choose to be a good man and a hero?  You can guess which it will be by the end of the film, but it is a circuitous route.I enjoyed the film, and the personal crisis story does have its routes in Spiderman story traditions.  However, it isn't quite as much fun as the straightforward good-guy bad-guy smash `em with a building story.  My guess is that they powers that be felt they had done that twice already and wanted something different.  OK.  You did it.  Can we get back to Spidey fighting Rhino, Tombstone, Mysterio, or any of the other dozens of bad guys Spiderman has dealt with over the decades.

McClain,"[1, 1]","I know a good deal of people like &#34;Spider-Man 3&#34;, and even compared it to 1997's &#34;Batman & Robin&#34; (which I thought that was really messed up that their hatered for it went that far).  I could go on, and on, and on, and on...AND ON about why I thought &#34;Spider-Man 3&#34; is a really good movie and why all the haters are wrong. (At times I feel like we saw two very different movies here.)I guess, in short, I'll start from the beginning.  When the first &#34;Spider- Man&#34; movie came out, and all the anticipation behind the first film I was hoping for a big, summer outing for our friendly neighborhood super hero.  The first instatllment was my least favorite, and there just wasn't much that was all that memorable about the first film outside of the performances, and Danny Elfman's score. I mean in the summer of 2002  my favorite movies were Star Wars: Episode 2-Attack of the Clones ( argue with my thoughts on the Star Wars Prequels by reading my one & only  review on the Star Wars Franchise from the Star Wars Trilogy DVD review also here on amazon ) & Minority Report.  I mean i feel that in the first &#34;Spider-Man&#34; the only thing that I remember was the upside-down kiss. I thought the soundtrack was a pretty good listen though, and I still sing &#34;Hero&#34; every now and then.Now &#34;Spider-Man 2&#34; was definitly good, and it made was my favorite movie of Summer 2004.  But summer 2004 at the movies was such a disappointment anyway (but that's another story) that &#34;Spider-Man 2&#34; easily was the only one that actually lived up to it's hype.  I bought only the superbit collection when it came out, but I did buy the extended cut and separate blu-ray release later, because I just refuse to add that first installment to my library.Now when &#34;Spider-Man 3&#34; came out, as I had mentioned about wanting that big, summer blockbuster version of &#34;Spider-Man &#34;, I felt that third installment really delivered. I loved the villians, loved the story, loved Peter Parker's arc, I thought the musical numbes were just hiliarious.  And I even loved Christopher's Young's score for the film, including how it was interwoven with Elfman's suite in the opening credits. ( I Hate that the score it's available yet).Now sure It still would've been up for a fourth installment, and i thought &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; was everything that the first &#34;Spider-Man&#34; from Sam Raimi should've been.  And I'm looking forward to this new Franchise, and see how they play out the sinister six.  Because the only questionable cristisim I would give &#34;Spider-Man 3&#34; is how they would've done the sinister six after killing off both goblins and Doc Ock (in Spider-Man 2).  That was quite a pickle.But I'm excited to see &#34;Spider-Man 3&#34; coming to 4k blu-ray, and it Dts-hd (though I loved the dolby true-hd soundtrack from the eariler blu-ray).

Now the question on everyone's mind....is it as good as the other two?Well, not really.  Its not a bad film by any means but the third go around lost a little of the charm.  Tobey Maquire remains endearing as lovable nerd, Peter Parker, who is a diligent student by day and crime fighter every available minute of the day.  Kirsten Dunst is also back as Mary Jane, Peter's girlfriend who, in this film, is having an emotional meltdown.  And, James DeFranco, returns as well becoming the New Goblin, reviving his rivalry and hatred for his former friend, Peter Parker.  JK Simmons also gives us laughs as stressed out and Spidey hatin' Daily Bugle editor, J Jonah Jameson.New additions include Topher Grace, who does a decent job as Eddie Brock, who eventually becomes the evil Venom.  Thomas Hayden Church is the Sandman, a onetime crook who is linked to the death of Peter's Uncle Ben.  And then there is the beautiful Gwen Stacey, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who throws a little tension into the Peter/Mary Jane romance.So with all the amped-up action sequences, the extra stars and big budget you'd expect that Spidey 3 would trounce its predecessors.  The problem is this----sometimes you can simple OVERDO IT!  This is the case with Spiderman 3.  Things are so jam packed with extra villains and all the action sequences (my favorite being a scene at the beginning with Gwen Stacey and a runaway crane) that the story seems to just fall into the background.  Things are rushed this time to get us to Spidey vs Venom/Sandman and some things (such as the alien lifeforce that attaches itself to its host) go completely unexplained.With a record breaking weekend haul of 148 million domestically, it is certain we are hungry for a new Spiderman movie.  Let's hope, however, that our next viewing of the worlds favorite webslinger returns to a simpler, more story driven movie with enough action to keep us interested but not enough to bog the film down.

By the time it was over, I felt like I'd just been launched out of a washing machine on spin mode.  ""Action-packed"" is an accurate and (in this case) unflattering way to describe this film.  With a slew of underdeveloped (and unecessary) villians and a massive budget for special affects, there were fight sequences and disasters galore - none of which resulted in anything more than a jumbled mess.You KNOW a movie is bad when it involves amnesia, love trinagles, alien viruses, not-so-secret secret identities, and a random Jim Carrey-esque dance sequence by Tobey Maguire all in one film.  To say this movie had WAAAYY too much going on would be the understatement of the century.  There were more subplots and side characters than an episode of the Love Boat!Afte seeing the movie, I asked other people in my office what they thought of it.  The men [shocker] loved it because of all the action, while women like myself (who also like action but enjoy other things like a good plot, decent writing, and uh, I don't know?  Logic!) agreed with me that it was terrible.Normally, I'd roll my eyes at the mere mention of a fourth installment of anything, but Spidey 3 was so bad, I want them to make one more because I feel the director owes me a good movie after serving up this rotten slice of insanity that I had looked forwrd to seeing for months.",1,What a trainwreck!,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,1508,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'first', '2', 'Spidey', 'movies', 'hopes', '3rd', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'others', 'sprung', '20', 'see', 'Imax', 'theater', 'time', 'was', 'felt', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'launched', 'washing', 'machine', 'spin', 'mode', 'Action-packed', 'accurate', 'case', 'unflattering', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'slew', 'underdeveloped', 'unecessary', 'villians', 'massive', 'budget', 'special', 'affects', 'were', 'fight', 'sequences', 'disasters', 'galore', 'none', 'resulted', 'anything', 'more', 'jumbled', 'mess.You', 'KNOW', 'movie', 'bad', 'when', 'amnesia', 'love', 'trinagles', 'alien', 'viruses', 'not-so-secret', 'secret', 'identities', 'random', 'Jim', 'Carrey-esque', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'one', 'film', 'say', 'movie', 'had', 'WAAAYY', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'century', 'were', 'more', 'subplots', 'side', 'characters', 'episode', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Afte', 'seeing', 'movie', 'asked', 'other', 'people', 'office', 'what', 'thought', 'men', '[', 'shocker', ']', 'loved', 'action', 'women', 'who', 'also', 'like', 'action', 'other', 'things', 'good', 'plot', 'decent', 'writing', 'uh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Logic', 'agreed', 'was', 'terrible.Normally', ""'d"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'mere', 'mention', 'fourth', 'installment', 'anything', 'Spidey', '3', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'want', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'feel', 'director', 'good', 'movie', 'serving', 'up', 'rotten', 'slice', 'insanity', 'had', 'looked', 'forwrd', 'seeing', 'months']",Spider-Man 3

Spiderman does quite a bit of fighting in this movie and for the most part these scenes where quite impressive. The new goblin was great to see but I was disappointed that he did not wear the same wicked costume his father wore in Spiderman 1. Sandman was really impressive in this film and the cgi work done with him was amazing. The sight of Sandman being as tall as a New York city skyscraper was astounding and amazing. On the other hand, Venom was a disappointment to me. I have to say Venom was cool to look at only when he is actually seen with the Venom face. Every time Venom speaks, he uses Eddie Brock's face. I think this really took away the fear and impressiveness of the Venom character. Spiderman of course fights his inner demons in this movie as well. This movie also involves an ongoing love story between Peter and MJ. There is also the friendship between Peter, Harry, and MJ. In Spiderman 3 there seems to be quite a bit of comedy, which was done very smoothly as usual. Although this movie involves many different elements, the main theme in this Spiderman 3 movie is forgiveness. The only thing I did not like about this movie is some of the characters do not act like their usual selves.  This makes the movie somewhat weird to watch at times.

649705,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JPFH,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[1, 4]","""Spider-Man 3"" is a wonderful if a bit shaky successor to the spectacular ""Spider Man 2"" from back in 2004.  Though the reviews were decidedly mixed, it still became a phenomenal success.  I can't say for sure that it can stack up in the long-run against it's predecessor. I mean, I don't think they could surpass the mini-sun fusion machine that Doctor Octavius created.The dust settles from the epic confrontation with scientist turned diabolical madman Doctor Octavius. Peter Parker's double-life as Spider Man and as Peter Parker seems to be settling back to normal at last. Mary Jane has returned into his life, things are looking up, and New York cleans up from the magnetic mess from the mini-sun that brought down Pier 56. However new threats emerge. One is a criminal named Flint Marko is on the run from the law after escaping from prison on murder charges. Due to quantum circumstances, Marko's molecular structure is altered significantly which causes him to transform into Sandman who becomes Spider Man's most powerful adversary. The other one however is an enemy that is unlike any other. It is not even just another bad human. It is an alien liquid life form that survives by attaching itself and assimilating itself onto a human called a Symbiote. And when it bonds with a host, it's very difficult to separate from it. This symbiote will have major influences on Spidey that could potentially make him worse than the villains put together if allowed to fester for too long. The effects of the symbiote are enough that they are already making Peter into something that others no longer even recognize.This movie though while still a five-star suffers from a particular problem called character saturation where too many major characters are brought into focus. The same thing weighs down ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" from a year before with too many characters.",5,A great third entry.

School's going well; the city loves Spider-Man; Mary Jane has a part on Broadway; and Peter's planning on asking Mary Jane to marry him. But you know that can't last.And it doesn't.Mary Jane's show closes after one performance. Peter's former friend Harry Osborne is out for revenge, as the New Goblin, influenced by his father's spirit. The Bugle has a new photographer who's out for Peter's job, and who has a great success plan: prove Spider-Man is a bad guy. An alien symbiote bonds Peter to his suit, turning it black, amplifying his powers, and changing his personality. One of Peter's classmates, Gwen, is getting his attention and driving a wedge between him and Mary Jane. And as if that's not enough, Uncle Ben's real killer, who's only stealing money for his little girl, gets changed into the Sandman, a creature made of (what else?) sand. Oh, yes. Peter gets away from the symbiote, but it attaches to the ambitious photographer, who enjoys the power and becomes Venom.Did I leave anything out?That's really the whole/only problem I had with Spider-Man 3--it was just way too busy. Even at almost 2.5 hours, it still felt too rushed. Plenty of people have written opinions of which parts should have been cut or left out, but I'm not that picky--just get rid of one of the villains and one of the personal-life problems, and I'd be a happy camper.Other than that, it was a fun movie, and pretty much what I expected. Lots of web-swinging and action, plenty of emotional depth and consequences, and really cool special effects. The Sandman in particular had impressive effects--in fact, if it weren't for those effects and the difficulty Spidey had in fighting a creature who can re-form itself, I'd have said the movie could have done without that story line.One thing I do want to mention, because I saw a few reviews criticizing this: when Spidey is influenced by the symbiote, he becomes all arrogant, reminding me of Jerry Lewis in The Nutty Professor. But what I just loved (and this is apparently not a majority opinion) is that, unlike Buddy Love, Peter Parker's alter-ego is not irresistible to women. He's still just as inept and clumsy, and the arrogance does not endear him to people. I thought it was a nice bit of characterization, actually--the symbiote merely amplifying traits (like the suit's power) rather than actually changing those traits.",4,"busy, but fun",1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2430,"['beginning', 'movie', 'Spidey/Peter', 'made', 'School', 'going', 'well', 'city', 'Spider-Man', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'part', 'Broadway', 'Peter', 'planning', 'asking', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'marry', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'last.And', ""doesn't.Mary"", 'Jane', 'show', 'one', 'performance', 'Peter', 'former', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'out', 'revenge', 'New', 'Goblin', 'influenced', 'father', 'spirit', 'Bugle', 'new', 'photographer', 'who', 'out', 'Peter', 'job', 'who', 'great', 'success', 'plan', 'prove', 'Spider-Man', 'bad', 'guy', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'bonds', 'Peter', 'suit', 'turning', 'black', 'amplifying', 'powers', 'changing', 'personality', 'One', 'Peter', 'classmates', 'Gwen', 'getting', 'attention', 'driving', 'wedge', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'not', 'enough', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'real', 'killer', 'who', 'only', 'stealing', 'money', 'little', 'girl', 'changed', 'Sandman', 'creature', 'made', 'what', 'else', 'sand', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Peter', 'away', 'symbiote', 'ambitious', 'photographer', 'who', 'power', 'Venom.Did', 'leave', 'anything', 'out', 'really', 'whole/only', 'problem', 'had', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'busy', 'Even', 'almost', '2.5', 'hours', 'still', 'felt', 'too', 'rushed', 'Plenty', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'opinions', 'parts', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'left', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'picky', 'just', 'get', 'rid', 'one', 'villains', 'one', 'personal-life', 'problems', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'camper.Other', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'Lots', 'web-swinging', 'action', 'plenty', 'emotional', 'depth', 'consequences', 'really', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'Sandman', 'particular', 'had', 'impressive', 'effects', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'effects', 'difficulty', 'Spidey', 'had', 'fighting', 'creature', 'who', 'can', 're-form', ""'d"", 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'story', 'line.One', 'thing', 'do', 'want', 'mention', 'saw', 'few', 'reviews', 'criticizing', 'when', 'Spidey', 'influenced', 'symbiote', 'arrogant', 'reminding', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'what', 'just', 'loved', 'apparently', 'not', 'majority', 'opinion', 'Buddy', 'Love', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'alter-ego', 'not', 'irresistible', 'women', 'still', 'just', 'inept', 'clumsy', 'arrogance', 'not', 'endear', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'bit', 'characterization', 'actually', 'symbiote', 'merely', 'amplifying', 'traits', 'suit', 'power', 'rather', 'actually', 'changing', 'traits']",Spider-Man 3

649710,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00005JPFH,Dr. E,"[11, 15]","Comic-book fans will have little trouble following the unusually large cast of characters (and their entanglements); nonetheless, fans of the films alone may find themselves a little overwhelmed: Mary Jane Watson v. Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker v. Eddie Brock, Spidey v. Venom, Spidey v. Sandman, Spidey v. New Goblin. The uninitiated may need to bring a notepad! Likewise, comic-book fans will not mind the ""uncomfortable"" tension (in fact, many will enjoy it), but fans of the films alone might find it nearly unbearable. Now, Raimi tries to inject humor to deflate the film's tension, but it frequently leaves the viewer (even fans of the comic-book) more perplexed than amused. For example: it is really bizarre to see Venom's ""emo"" affect on Spidey ... his black eyeliner, black sweeping hair, and black dress shirts ... like he just fell out of a ""Panic! at the Disco"" video. Certainly, comic-book enthusiasts are familiar with this this ""dark side"" trope (like red kryptonite's effect on Superman), I personally wish it was done with a little more finesse (something that might stand the ""test of time"").Now for some points on which we all may agree (maybe!) Christopher Young's compositions undermine Raimi's intent. Dramatic battles are completely undercut by his decidedly undramatic score. On a positive note: the acting has remained fairly faithful to the previous two films. Maguire does the best he can with the whiplash script, Franco succeeds in his complex role, and Dunst does a perfectly adequate job. Of course, J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi rock ... and Bruce Campbell shines (what else would we expect?!) And, needless to say, it is always great to see Stan Lee!!Some will find that the conclusion is a little too ""clean"" (I, for one, agree with that assertion). Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that comic-book fans expect this ending ... it is faithful to its conventions.Like many of the reviewers here, I was relieved when the credits appeared.

649711,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B00005JPFH,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[2, 2]","OK this one is for my Twin Andrew! I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree that it is a little disappointing. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved.This is a very good film thou and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this story. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Topher Grace probably wasn't the best choice to play the character, but he's similarities to McGuire's physicality make for an interesting choice if the character had been handled better.Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes to the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes the transition to live action film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if it's a little too ambitious.I've tried dissecting this film and taking out a villain and there just doesn't seem to be an easy way to do it. Take out Venom and we probably wouldn't have seen Black Costume Spidey, take out Sandman and the finale wouldn't have been as spectacular and since the new Goblin was already implied and so woven into the first two films there had to be closure there.The Blu Ray is a huge upgrade for visual and audio and they did the right thing for this film by adding all the bonus material from the 2 disc DVD edition. So buy the Blu Ray release and dump your old 2 disc DVD edition and enjoy this film for what it is... a fitting end to a great trilogy.",4,"THE WORST OF A GREAT TRILOGY, BUT THAT'S NOT SO BAD!",1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,2313,"['one', 'Twin', 'Andrew', 'know', 'film', 'taken', 'beating', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'little', 'disappointing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'live', 'up', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'Raimi', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'long', 'enough', 'think', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'Spider', 'Man', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'installment', 'length', 'needed', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'detail', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'thou', 'only', 'area', 'Venom', 'seem', 'rushed', 'think', 'Venom', 'needed', '20-25', 'minutes', 'time', 'film', 'joining', 'forces', 'Sandman', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'interesting', 'character', 'time', 'develop', 'Venom', 'unique', 'character', 'Web', 'Heads', 'Rogue', 'Gallery', 'deserved', 'more', 'just', 'add', 'story', 'stronger', 'Spidey', 'who', 'Spidey', 'immune', 'Spidey', 'Spider', 'Sense', 'think', 'possibilities', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'think', 'extra', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'world', 'Grace', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'play', 'character', 'similarities', 'McGuire', 'physicality', 'make', 'interesting', 'choice', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'better.Considering', 'going', 'bloated', 'finale', 'Raimi', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'moving', 'becoming', 'too', 'confusing', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'changes', 'comic', 'book', 'history', 'have', 'expect', 'sort', 'thing', 'when', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'transition', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'think', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'fitting', 'end', 'series', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'ambitious.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'dissecting', 'film', 'taking', 'out', 'villain', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'easy', 'way', 'do', 'Take', 'out', 'Venom', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'Black', 'Costume', 'Spidey', 'take', 'out', 'Sandman', 'finale', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'spectacular', 'new', 'Goblin', 'was', 'already', 'implied', 'so', 'woven', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'closure', 'there.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'huge', 'upgrade', 'visual', 'audio', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'film', 'adding', 'bonus', 'material', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'dump', 'old', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'fitting', 'end', 'great', 'trilogy']",Spider-Man 3

People seem upset about mostly one thing (too many villans) and retaliate with one star ratings and uninsightful reviews.The director wanted Sandman (and I'm glad he was included) and there was pressure from the studio and fans to include the New Goblin and Venom. (Given how the second movie ended, it would have been wrong NOT to include the New Goblin.)  Given that he was trying to please everyone, I think he did a great job weaving them all into the story.The complaints that this one isn't as funny or bright as the other two is absurd.  Part of the story is Spiderman's struggle emotionally and using his powers for the wrong reasons.  To have a happy, cheerful movie with this going on wouldn't feel right.  And this was needed because this is how Venom is created.I thought the CGI work with Sandman was absolutely amazing.  The previous movies were nominated for visual effects, so 3 had some big shoes to fill.  The action sequences are pretty cool, though for some reason, don't seem to match up to the first two movies.I fully acknowledge that this movie doesn't really match up to the first 2, but I do think it's also highly underrated.

649713,A1SI5TSEAADQS,B00005JPFH,"Dusty Kothenbeutel ""World's Best Mashed Potat...","[4, 7]","Spider-Man 3 (SM3) had a lot of hype to live up to. Personally I had found Spider-Man 2 (SM2) to be very good, but still lacking in some areas. Even Ghost Rider had better character writing than SM2 did, so I was very hopeful that SM3 would succeed at truly setting a new bar. . Now having seen the premiere, I think it did.The action is well paced and spread throughout the movie from start to finish, one thing that SM2 had problems with. While I'm sure that many people will complain about the non-action parts, especially the dance scene at the Jazz club, those are simultaneously some of the funniest and most poignant parts of a movie which contains quite an emotional rollercoaster, and I loved it.Some people will also complain that because there are so many characters included, certain story arcs were too rushed, and would have made better full movies on their own. It is true that before seeing SM3, I had feared that it would suffer from ""Batman & Robin"" syndrome, but those fears were quite thoroughly allayed. The cast was just the right size, and each character received just the right amount of screen time to satisfy their part of the story without any tangential long-windedness.THE LOW-DOWN: This movie is extremely good, extremely heartfelt with many highs and just as many lows. It is hysterically funny in several sections, and never feels forced at any point. IMHO, one of the best-written scripts in a long time, and equally perfect acting, especially from Tobey Maguire. The production is spot-on, and I can't imagine a more perfect final cut could have been made, the pacing is just brilliant.It assumes the new #2 spot on my greatest superhero movie list, narrowly behind Batman Begins.

649714,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B00005JPFH,dylan21484nj,"[2, 4]","When we last saw our arachnid hero, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and lady love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) finally hooked up and Spidey-hating Harry Osborn (James Franco) has found out that the man he blames from his father's death is in fact his very best friend. Spider-Man 3 picks up not long after 2 left off. MJ is now the lead role in a broadway musical, Peter is about to propose to MJ, and Spider-Man is the toast of the town despite fast-talking Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's best efforts. All seems to be going well, but Harry hasn't let go of his vendetta against the webslinger, a new superpowered foe has arrived in the form of the granular-composed Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), a new love interest has entered Peter's life in Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), and a new photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is in competition with Peter for a staff photographer job at the Bugle. Things just got really tough for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.Too tough, in fact. The fact that the film has to juggle three villains really makes it tough to care about any of them. The performances are fine (particularly Franco's scheming Harry), but a lot of characters get wasted here because there just isn't enough time to give them all their due screen time. Harry's Goblin gets amnesia after a thrilling tussle with Peter (a plot turn that feels like it belongs in an afternoon soap opera rather than belonging in a big-budget Hollywood film), which takes him out of the story for a good portion of the film. His character is the only villain that gets any real resolution and closure, but you do see it coming a mile away and you start to feel that a simple five-minute sit-down with Peter would have straightened his entire storyline out.Sandman literally gets washed down a drain and he disappears for a long period of the film as well. His conflict involving his sick daughter serves as a means to make him a sympathetic character and give him a motive, but it has a very weak resolution that could have been handled better.And the final villain, fan-favorite Venom, appears only at the movie's climax and is disposed of rather quickly. Oh I'm sure a sneaky writer can find a way to resurrect him in later films since comic book characters rarely ever stay dead, but he gets the least screen time here despite being one of Spider-Man's deadliest foes and it is more than apparent that director Sam Raimi had his arm thoroughly twisted by Avid Arad and Marvel to squeeze Venom in. Venom could be the main villain all my himself. they should have saved him for Spider-Man 4 and gave him a whole movie to make Spidey's life a living hell.This movie is also composed of a long string of improbable coincidences. Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, who also happens to be Peter Parker's lab partner in science class, who also happens to be going out with Eddie Brock, Peter's rival. And it just so happens that the man who was really responsible for the death of Peter's uncle has escaped from prison and just so happened to stumble into a wacky science experiment and become yet another mutated madman for Spidey to tangle with. And it just so happens that a meteor crash-lands near Peter, some alien goo from the meteor attaches itself to him, and when Peter finally ditches it, Eddie Brock just so happens to be nearby to absorb the goo. Can anyone else say, ""Oh come on!""?And yes, Evil Peter (or as some on the Internet have dubbed him, ""Emo Peter"" due to his long bangs) just isn't dark enough. Heck, he dances and struts down the street like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever! He should be more malicious and angry than coming up with neat dance numbers to make Mary Jane jealous. True acts of rage and hate would have been more stark and startling.In all, the action may be thrilling, but it's way too much for one movie. Much of what was going on in this one movie could have waited for Spider-Man 4, although it was doubtful that a fourth movie was...well, forthcoming. But since then, Marvel and Sony are pushing forward to do another Spider-Man film whether Raimi, Maguire, or Dunst are involved or not. Maybe if the prospects for a fourth film were more clear when Spider-Man 3 was in production, there would not have been the urgency to cram so much into this movie and try to tie all the plotlines up. That way, they could have given the characters their due screen time and saved great stories for future films instead of giving us shallow, rushed versions of them.",3,"Good, but too many villains and a silly ""Evil Peter"" keep it from being great",1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,4507,"['When', 'last', 'saw', 'arachnid', 'hero', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'lady', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'finally', 'hooked', 'up', 'Spidey-hating', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'found', 'out', 'man', 'father', 'death', 'fact', 'very', 'best', 'friend', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'picks', 'up', 'not', 'long', '2', 'left', 'off', 'MJ', 'now', 'lead', 'role', 'broadway', 'musical', 'Peter', 'propose', 'MJ', 'Spider-Man', 'toast', 'town', 'fast-talking', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'editor', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'best', 'efforts', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'vendetta', 'webslinger', 'new', 'superpowered', 'foe', 'arrived', 'form', 'granular-composed', 'Sandman', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'entered', 'Peter', 'life', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'new', 'photographer', 'named', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'competition', 'Peter', 'staff', 'photographer', 'job', 'Bugle', 'Things', 'just', 'got', 'really', 'tough', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spider-Man.Too', 'tough', 'fact', 'fact', 'film', 'juggle', 'three', 'villains', 'really', 'tough', 'care', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'particularly', 'Franco', 'scheming', 'Harry', 'lot', 'characters', 'get', 'wasted', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'give', 'due', 'screen', 'time', 'Harry', 'Goblin', 'amnesia', 'thrilling', 'tussle', 'Peter', 'plot', 'turn', 'afternoon', 'soap', 'opera', 'rather', 'belonging', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'story', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'character', 'only', 'villain', 'real', 'resolution', 'closure', 'do', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'start', 'feel', 'simple', 'five-minute', 'sit-down', 'Peter', 'would', 'have', 'straightened', 'entire', 'storyline', 'out.Sandman', 'literally', 'washed', 'down', 'drain', 'long', 'period', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'conflict', 'involving', 'sick', 'daughter', 'serves', 'means', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'give', 'motive', 'very', 'weak', 'resolution', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'final', 'villain', 'fan-favorite', 'Venom', 'only', 'movie', 'climax', 'disposed', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'sure', 'sneaky', 'writer', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'resurrect', 'later', 'films', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'rarely', 'ever', 'stay', 'dead', 'least', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'being', 'one', 'Spider-Man', 'deadliest', 'foes', 'more', 'apparent', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'had', 'arm', 'thoroughly', 'twisted', 'Avid', 'Arad', 'Marvel', 'squeeze', 'Venom', 'Venom', 'could', 'be', 'main', 'villain', 'should', 'have', 'saved', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'gave', 'whole', 'movie', 'make', 'Spidey', 'life', 'living', 'hell.This', 'movie', 'also', 'composed', 'long', 'string', 'improbable', 'coincidences', 'Spider-Man', 'rescues', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'lab', 'partner', 'science', 'class', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'going', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Peter', 'rival', 'just', 'so', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'responsible', 'death', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'escaped', 'prison', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'stumble', 'wacky', 'science', 'experiment', 'become', 'yet', 'mutated', 'madman', 'Spidey', 'tangle', 'just', 'so', 'meteor', 'crash-lands', 'Peter', 'alien', 'goo', 'meteor', 'when', 'Peter', 'finally', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'nearby', 'absorb', 'goo', 'Can', 'anyone', 'else', 'say', 'Oh', 'come', 'yes', 'Evil', 'Peter', 'Internet', 'have', 'dubbed', 'Emo', 'Peter', 'due', 'long', 'bangs', 'just', ""n't"", 'dark', 'enough', 'Heck', 'down', 'street', 'Travolta', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'malicious', 'angry', 'coming', 'up', 'neat', 'dance', 'numbers', 'make', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'jealous', 'True', 'acts', 'rage', 'hate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'stark', 'startling.In', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'thrilling', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'movie', 'Much', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'waited', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'was', 'doubtful', 'fourth', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'forthcoming', 'then', 'Marvel', 'Sony', 'are', 'pushing', 'forward', 'do', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'Raimi', 'Maguire', 'Dunst', 'are', 'involved', 'not', 'Maybe', 'prospects', 'fourth', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'clear', 'when', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'production', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'urgency', 'cram', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'try', 'tie', 'plotlines', 'up', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'characters', 'due', 'screen', 'time', 'saved', 'great', 'stories', 'future', 'films', 'instead', 'giving', 'shallow', 'rushed', 'versions']",Spider-Man 3
649715,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPFH,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 9]","The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple storylines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors.

So I had some doubts going into the theater. Well I'm sure glad I went anyway, because this movie was a BLAST. The critics need to lighten up. No, it wasn't a perfect film, and if one insists on being a hardass they can nit-pick it and find some valid faults. But overall, it was one of the most exciting and *fun* movies I've seen in quite some time.One of the complaints seems to be that too many villains are in it. I thought this may be the case before seeing it, but I thought the film handled their screen time quite well, even if Venom didn't get to do much (although he does have a very good showdown with Spider-Man during the final confrontation scene). But I gotta say that the Sandman grabbed my attention the most, especially his fight scenes with Spider-Man and others. To me, seeing the Sandman in the final confrontation was worth the price of admission. The special effects for his character were simply outstanding - they were fairly standard CGI for the others.As with the other 2 movies, the scenes of humor were well timed and executed, without compromising the tone of the film. I do wish that Kirsten Dunst hadn't gotten suspended high in the air yet again, because we all know that Spider-Man is going to save her from falling, yet again. But I suppose that's a minor irritation I can live with. Performance-wise, I liked everyone in their roles. We already knew what to expect from Maguire and Dunst, so there were no surprises there. Thomas Haden Church put in a good show as the Sandman. And although I wish they had let Bryce Dallas Howard be her lovely redheaded self, she still looked mighty fine, and I'm glad she got a considerable amount of screen time.IMO the first ""Spider-Man"" film was decent but not much more than that. And I'd rate the second film along with this third installment as superb, just in different ways. Part 2 was great due to the solid story and overall script. While part 3 lacks some of that, it more than makes up for it with better and bolder action and pure entertainment level. I was originally going to give this 4 stars but decided to go all the way to 5 mainly because I had such a great time with it. Think of this film as the nitro-charged extension of part 2 and I'll bet you'll find yourself more than pumped by the time the end credits roll.",5,The critics can go fly a kite - this was a blast,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2426,"['went', 'see', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'tonight', 'reading', 'several', 'not-so-great', 'reviews', 'earlier', 'today', 'local', 'newspapers', 'So', 'had', 'doubts', 'going', 'theater', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'glad', 'went', 'anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'BLAST', 'critics', 'need', 'lighten', 'up', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'one', 'being', 'hardass', 'can', 'nit-pick', 'find', 'valid', 'faults', 'overall', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', '*fun*', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time.One', 'complaints', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'villains', 'are', 'thought', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'seeing', 'thought', 'film', 'handled', 'screen', 'time', 'quite', 'well', 'even', 'Venom', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'showdown', 'Spider-Man', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Sandman', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'most', 'especially', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Spider-Man', 'others', 'seeing', 'Sandman', 'final', 'confrontation', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'special', 'effects', 'character', 'were', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'were', 'fairly', 'standard', 'CGI', 'others.As', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'scenes', 'humor', 'were', 'well', 'timed', 'executed', 'compromising', 'tone', 'film', 'do', 'wish', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'suspended', 'high', 'air', 'yet', 'again', 'know', 'Spider-Man', 'going', 'save', 'falling', 'yet', 'again', 'suppose', 'minor', 'irritation', 'can', 'live', 'Performance-wise', 'liked', 'everyone', 'roles', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'Maguire', 'Dunst', 'were', 'surprises', 'there', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'Sandman', 'wish', 'had', 'let', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'be', 'lovely', 'redheaded', 'self', 'still', 'looked', 'mighty', 'fine', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'considerable', 'amount', 'screen', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'not', 'much', 'more', ""'d"", 'rate', 'second', 'film', 'third', 'installment', 'superb', 'just', 'different', 'ways', 'Part', '2', 'was', 'great', 'due', 'solid', 'story', 'overall', 'script', 'part', '3', 'more', 'up', 'better', 'bolder', 'action', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'level', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'decided', 'go', 'way', '5', 'mainly', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'time', 'Think', 'film', 'nitro-charged', 'extension', 'part', '2', ""'ll"", 'bet', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'pumped', 'time', 'end', 'roll']",Spider-Man 3
649721,A1E0APHODMK896,B00005JPFH,"Eric Hildebrand ""Flapdoodle""","[6, 12]","I love comic books and there are many comic book movies I have liked, including the first 2 Spidey films.  But `Spider-Man 3' is pretty terrible.  I think the major problems with this film come from 3 big mistakes:1) Trying to outdo the first 2 Spidey films.  I.e., Spidey #1 had 1 super-villain, #2 had 2 super-villains, therefore #3 should have 3 villains.  This doesn't work because these villains are clearly too much for Spidey, thus necessitating some extremely unbelievable and stupid plot twists.  And it doesn't work because there isn't enough time to develop any emotional interest in the hero-villain conflict.2) It's obvious that this movie was created to produce maximum video/computer game spinoffs.  The menu screen of the DVD features video game versions of Spidey and other characters moving about in video game style and a couple of the `special features' are video game promos.  The creative decision to go this way has led to fight scenes that are way too long, break too many laws of physics too often, shatter all sense of believability, and feel downfight oppressive and exhausting.  My guess is that for those of us over 35, at least those of us who don't play computer games daily, our eyes are simply not geared fast enough to really follow this kind of action.3) Over-reliance on Computer Generated Images (CGI).  The fight scenes all look like either cartoons or video games, and so you just don't have the kind of dramatic involvement required to suspend disbelief.  In the old days, directors had to rely on tricks of editing, camera position, stuntmen, harnesses, etc. to create exciting and believable fight scenes.  Now that those gimmicks aren't necessary, directors seem to think we'll just buy into anything.  Not so: the old school fight scenes, where you had stunt men doing what was vaguely possible intercut with close ups of the actors' faces, looking angry, exasperated, sweaty, etc., had much more dramatic impact.  Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI.  Hollywood seems to think that CGI solves all problems of special effects and fight scenes.  Not so: CGI looks fake, just in a new way.Overall, Spider-Man 3 is bad because it follows the conventions and formulae of most modern action films: more, harder, bigger, badder, etc. and full-speed ahead with the games and merchandising.

649723,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B00005JPFH,Ervin Griffin,"[1, 3]","Spider-Man 3 has been hyped as the best of the trilogy. I have to respectfully disagree. While not bad, it is the WEAKEST of the trilogy. On its own, its a good film but when compared to the first two (especially Spider-Man 2), it falls short. Here is my take:PROS - James Franco's portrayal of Harry Osborn remains strong here. His ""New Goblin"" is arguably the best villian in this film though he later turns good to help Spidey against The Sandman and Venom. Also, I found this one to be funnier in spots than the first two. Particularly Tobey Maguire's performance as ""Bad Peter"" when he acquires his black suit. The dance scene in the club was amazing and probably one of the better non-super scenes in the film! I also thought that the Sandman was handled well. The CG's for him were incredible!CONS - Speaking of Maquire, his and Kirsten Dunst's performances were still good but not as strong here. I blame that more in the writing though. Not enough Aunt May or J. Jonah Jameson in this one too.Bottom line here is this, there was too much stuff crammed into one film. In other words, some of this stuff could've easily been held over for a Spider-Man 4 if not for contractual concerns. I personally would've had just the Sandman and the black costume situation here and held Venom for a fourth film. Speaking of Venom, his character development was very rushed in my opinion. Another film could've fleshed him out much better!Overall, this film isn't a waste of money BUT I'd get it at a reduced price. While nowhere near as bad as some other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil (theatrical version/not the uncut), Batman & Robin (1997), Superman IV, Spawn and Steel, it falls way short of the first two Spidey films!

649728,A1R6KGK8TRJAGV,B00005JPFH,"Free Thinker ""Amazon made me remove my blog s...","[13, 17]","Once upon a time there was a comic book company named Marvel.  It was a tiny enterprise that was struggling to stay afloat in the shadow of its huge competitor, DC.  A man named Stan Lee worked for this company.  He had a vision that one day comic books would be more than, well, comic books.  Instead of simplistic plots and one dimensional characters he imagined story lines with heroes that shared all of the foibles of regular mortals, including fear, doubt, anger, hope and internal conflict.Stan Lee poured this vision into a person he created named Spiderman.  The character was an instant hit and showed that Lee's vision had potential.  Marvel went from being barely known to becoming the gold standard in its industry.Spiderman 3 is the ultimate fulfillment of Lee's vision.  This movie is a true epic.  Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman with incredible acting skill.  As the superhero's popularity grows he is faced with new temptations, including the desire to misuse his powers and give in to the dark side of his nature.  This is personified in the arrival of an extra terrestrial symbiont that gives Spiderman vast new powers but also magnifies his feelings of hatred and aggression.The lovely and immensely talented Kirsten Dunst does a fantastic job playing Mary Jane as a caring, sensitive, highly vulnerable young lady who is struggling with her own conflicts.  She becomes embroiled in the movie's climactic scene in which Spiderman must fight enemies created largely by his own misdeeds.  The result is one of the best battle scenes in motion picture history, where special effects are used to enhance and amplify the story line, not replace it.  The end is in equal parts tragic, inspiring, touching and romantic.  It explores the questions of what qualities make up a true hero as well as what motivates those who do evil.In my opinion the large cast is not a hindrance to this film.  Rather the sizable set of characters only adds to its epic status.In a day where authentic heroes are desperately needed, Spiderman 3 rises to the best standards of film making.  It gives us a character that not only entertains but also encourages all of us to live to the best of our natures.  In short, this isn't just a great superhero movie.  It's a great movie, period.  If you don't see this one you'll be missing something truly special.",5,Stan Lee's Vision is Fulfilled,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2373,"['Once', 'time', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'company', 'named', 'Marvel', 'was', 'tiny', 'enterprise', 'was', 'struggling', 'stay', 'afloat', 'shadow', 'huge', 'competitor', 'DC', 'A', 'man', 'named', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'worked', 'company', 'had', 'vision', 'one', 'day', 'comic', 'books', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'comic', 'books', 'Instead', 'simplistic', 'plots', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'imagined', 'story', 'lines', 'heroes', 'shared', 'foibles', 'regular', 'mortals', 'including', 'fear', 'doubt', 'anger', 'hope', 'internal', 'conflict.Stan', 'Lee', 'poured', 'vision', 'person', 'created', 'named', 'Spiderman', 'character', 'was', 'instant', 'hit', 'showed', 'Lee', 'vision', 'had', 'potential', 'Marvel', 'went', 'being', 'barely', 'known', 'becoming', 'gold', 'standard', 'industry.Spiderman', '3', 'ultimate', 'fulfillment', 'Lee', 'vision', 'movie', 'true', 'epic', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'role', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'incredible', 'acting', 'skill', 'superhero', 'popularity', 'faced', 'new', 'temptations', 'including', 'desire', 'misuse', 'powers', 'give', 'dark', 'side', 'nature', 'personified', 'arrival', 'extra', 'terrestrial', 'symbiont', 'Spiderman', 'vast', 'new', 'powers', 'also', 'feelings', 'hatred', 'aggression.The', 'lovely', 'immensely', 'talented', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'caring', 'sensitive', 'highly', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'struggling', 'own', 'conflicts', 'embroiled', 'movie', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Spiderman', 'must', 'fight', 'enemies', 'created', 'largely', 'own', 'misdeeds', 'result', 'one', 'best', 'battle', 'scenes', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'enhance', 'amplify', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'replace', 'end', 'equal', 'parts', 'tragic', 'inspiring', 'touching', 'romantic', 'questions', 'what', 'qualities', 'make', 'up', 'true', 'hero', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'who', 'do', 'evil.In', 'opinion', 'large', 'cast', 'not', 'hindrance', 'film', 'sizable', 'set', 'characters', 'only', 'epic', 'status.In', 'day', 'where', 'authentic', 'heroes', 'are', 'desperately', 'needed', 'Spiderman', '3', 'rises', 'best', 'standards', 'film', 'making', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'live', 'best', 'natures', 'short', ""n't"", 'just', 'great', 'superhero', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'period', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'truly', 'special']",Spider-Man 3

Fortunately, he and the screenwriters did not do that with SM3.I have read the other reviewers here chastising the number of villains in this movie, and the alleged ""watering-down"" affect.  Too much Tobey, too much action, too much romance, too much CGI.  To that I say...nonsense!  Ignore these reviews, some people will never be satisfied.SM3 is a fascinating look at a very basic human flaw...the desire for mercy and forgiveness vs. the unwillingness to grant it because of a lust for revenge.  Mix in Parker's impulsive naivete concerning matters of romance, and the tension that it creates with MJ, and you have the ingredients for an entertaining love story. Maguire, with his squeaky voice, is the perfect Spidey, and gangly Dunst, with her stringy hair and girl-next-door appeal plays a wonderful MJ.The story moves very quickly, briefly touching on many legends in the original Marvel Comics tales, as it must.  In a perfect world, we would have a dedicated movie to deal individually with Sandman, the alien symbiote, Venom, the new Goblin and Gwen Stacy.  That would be the only satisfactory result for many of the critics of this movie that you'll read here.But if you love Maguire and Dunst in their roles as I do, then you know that that just isn't practical.  If this is to be their last SM film, as has been strongly suggested, then bravo for this final installment from them.  Let other actors and directors and writers try to pick up the ball and run, and suffer the inevitable comparison and scorn from the critics (Batman, Superman, James Bond).  These two will always be Spidey and MJ, and they have set the bar high.As for SM3, we find satisfaction in friends reconciled, forgiveness given, personal demons conquered, the sorrow of loss and graceful love rekindled.  These actors are sure and comfortable in their roles, and the storyline does not fail them.  Add to that the wide open set-up for future installments, and SM lovers everywhere are left with hope.

But then, that is the good part. The bad part is, there is too much of plots, emotions, villians too... where the earlier two parts had to contend with one bad guy each, this one has more than both of the earlier ones combined!!! Four in all, if you count the black thingy that clings to spidey.However, having said that, there is essentially a coming of age that is shown in this movie, where the character of Peter Parker is shown to finally be able to have a life for himself (well, at least almost!). The story goes along quite well, and... wait... what is that? Oh... the green goblin reappears. Harry dons his father's suit, in a much anticipated sequence, and another much anticipated showdown takes place between Peter and Harry, and... but wait... what is that? Oh... the sandman appears...And so, before you've had time to digest the first subplot of this otherwise marvellous movie, the plot changes. Sad to say but that is precisely and the only aspect that lets the movie down. The acting is as usual - excellent from Tobey and James (Harry), and there are times when Kirsten looks kinda cute! My personal part - goes to Harry Osborne, and I feel sad that a character that had so much potential has been neglected in favor of lesser evil characters, and as such ends up being sidelined.Enough of the spoilers, go and watch the movie... you'll not regret it.

649743,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPFH,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 9]","Going into this one, I was wondering if Sam Raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus SPIDER-MAN 2. Bluntly, the answer is no. But, listen, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. SPIDEY 2 was a five star film, this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture.The special effects are seamless. CG Venom and the Sandman look great, while CG Spidey continues to astound. Admittedly, I wasn't too impressed with how the Goblin looked. You really gotta hand it to Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle epic superhero battles. In various fabulous faceoffs, Spidey takes on the Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom and, each time, our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor. Even though we knew Spidey was going to come out on top, the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter. I have absolutely no complaints with the Spidey sequences.SPIDER-MAN 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson (hilarious!) and the sexy Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant (more, please). Sam Raimi's buddy, Bruce Campbell, has a funny bit as a Maitre d', Mageina Tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence, Stan Lee provides the obligatory cameo ('nuff said), Bryce Dallas Howard is essentially wasted as Gwen Stacy, and Rosemary Harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom.Folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories. I say, ""Phooey"" to that. I was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character. In my opinion, the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories. By virtue of having been in every film installment, Harry Osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist. James Franco, whom I normally dislike, is very good here. Flint Marko, aka The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience, early on, becomes privy to his core motivation. Eddie Brock (a puny and miscast Topher Grace), however, is just plain bad egg. Now, there's a chance that newcomers to the Spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky, wriggly alien symbiote. Furthermore, Raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments, opting to leave it in residence at Peter's cramped apartment to bide its time. Raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory. Not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source. SECRET WARS, anyone?Hands down, Spidey's my favorite superhero. Like a host of kids, of the plethora of superheroes, it's Peter Parker with whom I identified the most when I was a mere tadpole. What makes him such a rootable underdog character is that Stan Lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teen/young man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies. This film strays away from what makes him so likable. The start of SPIDER-MAN 3 finds a smug Peter Parker as Spiderman has become the toast of New York. His image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers (excepting the Bugle, of course). He even is presented with the key to the city. This same scene also comes up with an act by Peter as Spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards Mary Jane. In fact, the success of his Spider-Man persona blinds him to what's going on with Mary Jane, whose career isn't flowing as smoothly. Understandibly, it's not too long before M.J. begins to feel that Peter isn't there for her. Suffice it to say, while I loved every Spidey sequence, there are moments here where I genuinely did not like Peter Parker.Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance. She's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as Mary Jane that every thoughtless act by Peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude. I'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk. And, since I'm crapping on the poor guy, I must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool. If it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn, it failed miserably, and the film, in my eyes, lost some credibility. The audience, including me, burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up. Unintended laughter - it's not a good thing.But I want to reiterate: Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. He got me thru junior high school (middle school, to you youngsters) and high school. I hated to criticize this movie, but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts. Yet, with its flaws, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much a sensational movie, and I do feel that, ultimately, its positives outweigh the negatives. Tobey Maguire is the definitive Peter Parker, no matter what. I can't really envision anyone else in that role. Dunst, as always, is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent. The complex story, in spite of hitting a few false notes, did keep me involved. The action scenes are eyepopping, nothing at all wrong with them. Sam Raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental, low key humor (for some reason, I like the doorknob bit). There's even several brief dance numbers, and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse. Most, hopefully, will do the former.",4,"""Look at little Goblin, Jr. You gonna cry?""",1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,5770,"['Going', 'one', 'was', 'wondering', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'would', 'be', 'able',

649746,A2BU0FDY5V0Y9T,B00005JPFH,Helmut von Seydlitz,"[4, 7]","So my biggest gripe with this movie is the villains and the necessity of having three while trying to entirely build their back-story in one movie. Yes, the cheesy dance number, Peter's weird emoish attitude in general and such also didn't help but my big issue is usually the villain. Without a ""good"" central villain a story can easily devolve into the saintly hero destroying armies of stormtrooper-redshirt-ninjas and then they just seem kind of overpowered and lose some of the hero's character itself.First off, the sandman in this adaptation is not particularly inspired. His daughter is sick and so this ...""justifies?"" his criminal activities. That is really his entire back-story in the film, and I find it very lackluster. It just made me feel vaguely sad, I don't want to root for him but I don't want his daughter to die. His vague emotional aspect didn't work for me and I found his scenes to be more boring than entertaining. Not to mention how he gains his powers: the idea that any scientist worth his salt would not factor in EVERY loose variable in an experiment is ludicrous. Science has not advanced to its current state with attitudes of ""there's a bird in our billion dollar experiment that could negate our entire test...lets hope it flies away."" Just plain dumb.Second, Harry is not a terrible villain but he seems a little wishy-washy and not particularly evil beyond getting revenge for his dad. He arguably has the most character development and screen time and I did like his redemption at the end. That said, hes not much of a major villain and I can see why the filmakers decided they shouldn't have him be the only villain.Finally there is Venom, one of my favorite villains of all time. He is just so epic and after the way they handled Doc Ock in Spiderman 2 I was pretty excited to see their rendition of Venom. This was probably my biggest letdown of the movie. He was only in the last quarter of the film, did almost nothing besides menace Mary Jane(like EVERY other spiderman villain), and to top it all off I wasn't big on the kid from That 70's Show playing this BA villain.The film tries to develop all three villains almost entirely in one movie and it, in my personal opinion failed. Sandman was too emotionally charged and generally boring, Harry was ok but not able to really take on his dad's mantle as Green Goblin, and Venom was just put in to draw nostalgic fans who were ultimately let down by his short and insignificant appearance. Again this is just my opinion but that's what killed Spiderman 3 for me.",2,Too many villains and too little development for them,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,2556,"['So', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'movie', 'villains', 'necessity', 'having', 'three', 'trying', 'entirely', 'build', 'back-story', 'one', 'movie', 'Yes', 'cheesy', 'dance', 'number', 'Peter', 'weird', 'emoish', 'attitude', 'general', 'such', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'big', 'issue', 'usually', 'villain', 'good', 'central', 'villain', 'story', 'can', 'easily', 'devolve', 'saintly', 'hero', 'destroying', 'armies', 'stormtrooper-redshirt-ninjas', 'then', 'just', 'seem', 'kind', 'overpowered', 'lose', 'hero', 'character', 'itself.First', 'off', 'sandman', 'adaptation', 'not', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'daughter', 'sick', 'so', 'justifies', 'criminal', 'activities', 'really', 'entire', 'back-story', 'film', 'find', 'very', 'lackluster', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'sad', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'root', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'daughter', 'die', 'vague', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'found', 'scenes', 'be', 'more', 'boring', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'mention', 'how', 'gains', 'powers', 'idea', 'scientist', 'salt', 'would', 'not', 'factor', 'EVERY', 'loose', 'variable', 'experiment', 'ludicrous', 'Science', 'not', 'advanced', 'current', 'state', 'attitudes', 'bird', 'billion', 'dollar', 'experiment', 'could', 'negate', 'entire', 'test', 'hope', 'away', 'Just', 'plain', 'dumb.Second', 'Harry', 'not', 'terrible', 'villain', 'little', 'wishy-washy', 'not', 'particularly', 'evil', 'getting', 'revenge', 'dad', 'arguably', 'most', 'character', 'development', 'screen', 'time', 'did', 'like', 'redemption', 'end', 'said', 'not', 'much', 'major', 'villain', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'filmakers', 'decided', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'only', 'villain.Finally', 'Venom', 'one', 'favorite', 'villains', 'time', 'just', 'so', 'epic', 'way', 'handled', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Spiderman', '2', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'see', 'rendition', 'Venom', 'was', 'probably', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'did', 'almost', 'nothing', 'menace', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'EVERY', 'other', 'spiderman', 'villain', 'top', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'kid', '70', 'Show', 'playing', 'BA', 'villain.The', 'film', 'tries', 'develop', 'three', 'villains', 'almost', 'entirely', 'one', 'movie', 'personal', 'opinion', 'failed', 'Sandman', 'was', 'too', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'generally', 'boring', 'Harry', 'was', 'ok', 'not', 'able', 'really', 'take', 'dad', 'mantle', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Venom', 'was', 'just', 'put', 'draw', 'nostalgic', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'ultimately', 'let', 'down', 'short', 'insignificant', 'appearance', 'Again', 'just', 'opinion', 'what', 'killed', 'Spiderman', '3']",Spider-Man 3

649751,AV56CQTOGFTCJ,B00005JPFH,Incredible Fulk,"[6, 7]","With the first two Spiderman films both a critical & financial success, Spiderman 3 had big shoes to fill. Does it live up? To me, it not only lives up but it surpasses my expectations. Unfortunately, many others were so appalled by this movie that they really went out of their way to say it ruined the whole Spiderman franchise. Appalled by what exactly? A goofy dance scene, a dark looking hair style that makes Spiderman look emo (when he really wasn't), a small scene that involves crying or the much awaited Venom only has three minutes of screen time? Sadly, those were the reasons. I knew so many people that were so butt hurt that Venom didn't have big screen time, that they would actually lecture me on why this movie ""sucked"". It's sad really, because that's not what I was looking for in this film. I expected an epic action movie that still kept all the traditional traits of the heart & soul of Spiderman. That's what I got. This movie was action packed, emotional, fast paced and FUN above all else. It takes a very big risk by having more than one villain (three in fact) in this film. I thought it was a great choice to do this because it gives the film a quicker pace and Spiderman more to do instead of discovering how to use his powers again. I feel like this film had a million ideas and used them all. The casting it still fantastic and still remains spot on.Tobey Maguire is still fantastic as Spiderman. He looks like he is having more fun this time around. He plays Peter Parker much more comfortably now just as much as the character is more comfortable with being Spiderman now. He still has moments that make his life difficult such as his girlfriend MJ having problems with him, Harry losing his memory, a competitive photographer joins The Daily Bugle and realizing that uncle killer is still out there. Like the first two films, it shows us how human he is and it's still a difficult life being a superhero. He gets even more interesting when wears the black suit which makes him more violent and more full of himself. Tobey has much more screen time than before and he really carries the film. Not once is he boring to watch, because he's always working. It was great to see the title superhero take center stage rather than having an iconic villain steal the film from the rest of the actors *cough Dark Knight*.James Franco as Harry Osborn is now a fully developed character along with Peter Parker. In the 1st film, he was a neglected son who was trying to impress his father. In the 2nd, he was cocky/ vengeful millionaire who was still living in the shadow of his father. This time, he is a full blown villain who wants vengeance on Spiderman now knowing it's his best friend Peter. Like Maguire, Franco really makes this film shine. He is unpredictable character who has a charm to him. For awhile, he loses his memory after a fantastic fight scene in the beginning of the movie. Even then his is quite charming and funny to watch because he almost acts like an innocent kid again. But things fade fast and he's back to wanting Spiderman dead. Like Spiderman, Harry is a character that is also human. He faces a tough time choosing between revenge and forgiveness. It was great to see another character go through a change from the first film.Kristen Dunst is still great as Mary Jane. She has much more screen time than the first and she's matured as well. MJ is also facing a tough point from getting fired from the theater to having a boyfriend (Parker) who's bit full of himself like a celebrity. She may come off as a whiny b.... to some viewers, she is still human. We've come to the point in life where we grow jealous of someone we care about. It adds to her character instead of making her a ditsy teenager like in the first movie or even the comics.Thomas Haden Church was awesome as Sandman. Following the footsteps of both William Defoe's Green Goblin & Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, he does a fine job filling those shoes. He is a sympathetic character who only commits crimes to save his daughter. But things are much harder on him when Parker learns he apparently killed Uncle Ben and is now out for vengeance. I was happy to hear that Sandman was finally going to have a spot in a movie; he is such an overlooked villain. How can anybody not like a guy made of sand? There was so much that could be done with him from making hammer arms to becoming a giant sand monster. I've never seen such an unlimited character since the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The CGI on Sandman looked amazing and it's one of the only few times I'll say it's CG used right. He has some really good fight scenes with Spiderman like the scene in the subway which really showed us what Sandman could do. He is sadly overlooked and many fanboys think some like Rhino should be in this movie. Yeah, people want a villain whose only specialty is running through walls instead of an unlimited villain who can do anything.Topher Grace is a fine Eddie Brock. Many fanboys were so angry that he wasn't a steroid looking character like in the comics. Honestly, I liked it better that he was skinny because it makes him like a shadow of Peter Parker. This is exactly what he is from the comics. His character is everything opposite of Parker. He's selfish, desperate, and a sore loser which is what the character of Eddie Brock is meant to be. Grace really pulls off being a character that is full of BS and was willing to do anything to get big. It all backfires both badly & gloriously. By the end of the movie, he obtains the black suit and becomes Venom. Many fanboys had their feelings hurt to see Venom only in the movie for the last half hour. I thought it was handled fine because it made an epic climax for this movie. The character is still true to the comics as in his hatred for Spiderman and being an opposite of him. He is an evil messed up character who I actually enjoyed watching regardless of how long his screen time was.The rest of the characters are still fantasic as always. J.K. Simmons always shines as J. Jonah Jameson along with his crew of The Daily Bugle (Ted Raimi, Elizabeth Banks, etc.). Rosemary Harris still plays Aunt May straight and perfect. She was to the first Spiderman films as to what Michael Gough (RIP) was to the first Batman films. Bryce Dallas Howard was fine (and good looking)as Gwen Stacy, although I do kind of agree she was just there. Elya Baskin as Mr. Ditkovich is still a funny random character who's slightly more sympathetic this time around but still press Peter on paying his rent. Of course this wouldn't be complete without Bruce Campbell as the French waiter who tries to help Parker purpose to MJ. I love Bruce Campbell and this film wouldn't be complete without him.The actions scenes are a show stealer in this movie. All of them are fun to watch and each of them have a story to back them up. The first fight between Peter & Harry was fantastic and emotional. How often do you see Spiderman fight without his costume? It's rare, not even the Nolan Batman films really do that. But the major theme of the film is revenge! Every character wants revenge in some shape or form. Spiderman wants revenge on Sandman for killing his uncle, Harry aka New Goblin want revenge on Parker for killing his father and Eddie Brock wants revenge for being screwed over. But either way, it comes back on Spiderman who is at the center of it all. Even though this film is action packed, it has it's share of funny moments like the Jameson scenes, the dinner scene with Bruce Campbell and the night club scene. The film doesn't go overboard with either it's silliness or it's darkness. It does a fine job keeping a balance.But there are it's share of negative moments. I feel like so bits were rushed like the intro of the black suit. I think Gwen Stacy was a pointless character who was their to add to the love triangle of Peter, Harry & Mj. I also think the some of the dance scenes could have been cut. But that's a minor issue because I enjoyed that scene.Overall, give this film a big chance and don't listen to fanboys who are butthurt the film wasn't all about Venom. It highly enjoyed this movie and it made a fine yet unexpected climax to the original trilogy. It saddens me to think that this film is considered to be the ""Batman & Robin"" of the Spiderman films. It was barley given a chance before fanboys cried for a reboot. It more saddens me that fanboys will now talk so much trash about the original trilogy's legacy because they got the reboot they cried & whined for. Forget about the original's having state of the art special effects for the time. Forget about the original's basically beginning the superhero genre going strong today. Forget about the fine acting for dialogue of the first three films. To the fanboys, it's all about ""Venom only in the movie for 3 mins. I won't remember this films for that. I'll remember them for it's clever writing, awesome action scenes, fine acting, ground breaking camera work and more. This film is no different. It was an action packed movie that never got boring or slowed down. It was what movies should be, FUN. I hope someday, people will look back at this movie with fond memories and give this movie a better review. Much like how Batman Returns was back in 92. It was panned at first but is now looked back as a classic film.",5,A sadley misjudged finale!!,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,9369,"['first', 'two', 'Spiderman', 'films', 'critical', 'financial',

I aknowledge that it did have its' problems--too many subplots, too many villains, too much silliness from Peter, too much whining from Mary Jane.  On the other hand--what worked, really did work.  Bryce Dallas Howard was wonderful, the Sandman rocked, and the special effects were fab. By far, though, what really made this movie for me was the buddy aspect between Peter and his best friend turned villain, Harry Osborn.

649754,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JPFH,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 10]","The problem with Spiderman is that he is a solitary super hero in perfect agreement with the animal he is embodying. But that limits his adventures a lot to dangling and swinging at the end of a spider thread. So he needs to be presented with some companions who are going to be his preys, if possible, if necessary. To make things even better an extra-terrestrial organism falls onto the earth with some meteor and this organism is going to invade that poor Spiderman and make him turn black, aggressive, vindictive, vain. He will then cause a lot of suffering by doing bad things for the pleasure of dominating people and things. He will also relive the death of his uncle in the most vengeful way and try to capture the supposed and convicted though not quite proved killer who has just escaped from his narrow prison cell. Then he will get into some riffraff with his supposed best friend who in his turn becomes vengeful about his father who was supposedly killed by Spiderman, though it was never proved. Add to that a little bit of technological magic to turn the escapee into a sandstorm and you have three fourth of the drama. The last fourth is a photographer who wants to become a star in the press and who cheats in order to do it with a fake Spiderman picture. He will be exposed. But that drama will not turn tragic because of some circumstances that will make the best friend realize he was dumb, that will make Spiderman free of his ET invader, that will even liberate the second host of the ET black invader. Bells will be the solutions, church bells of course, and a lot of luck too, and final forgiveness. Then the city will go back to its absolutely boring peacefulness.

I'd say it has half as much to do with the symbiotic alien life form known as Venom that attaches itself to him, and half to do with Mary Jane's hedonistic, prostitutorial ways.  Allow me to explain...While Spidey is solving crime, risking his life, and being a hero, he still has to deal with family and a girlfriend.  And his cult hero status - something won with much difficulty - doesn't seem to sit well with Mary Jane.  During a celebration of Spiderman saving the day once again, along with the life of a beautiful young blonde who makes Mary Jane look like a ginger hobo, the attention Spiderman gets is just a bit too much.  She can't stand someone else being the center of attention, and since she got her little feewings hurt by getting fired from a musical, she was looking to redirect the pain.  Spidey gets a celebratory kiss and Mary Jane, being the whore she is, cheats on Spiderman without any sympathy whatsoever.  Seriously, who cheats on Spiderman!?Unfortunately, she also helps to turn Spidey into a complete idiot, prancing around like a complete retard and making a fool of himself in front of every attractive woman he sees.  He pops his collar and gets an emo haircut, and is obviously emotionally damaged.  Luckily, he takes a date to Mary Jane's place of employment and teases her unmercifully, and she deserves every second of it.Along the way Spidey continues the battle versus the legacy of the Green Goblin, as well as the Sandman, and the aforementioned Venom (with new host).

Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has accepted her role as the web-winger's fianc&eacute;, and is preparing her own success story as a Broadway singer. Peter's best friend Harry Osborn and son of the late Green Goblin (James Franco) however, is slowly succumbing to the 'voices' of his father.

649762,A2CB0DNKYCIQE8,B00005JPFH,J. C. Amos,"[4, 6]","I have to admit, I went into this one hoping for a great movie, but was expecting to be dissapointed.  I was worried that with all of the characters and plot threads going on that Spidey 3 would just become a convoluted mess and simply eye candy for the action junky.  While it wasn't as well scrpted at #2, Rami did a pretty good job of juggling this menagerie of villains and plots into a cohesive and very enertaining film.  At a hefty 1:36 long, there's still plenty of room for character development in between the many villain fight scenes (probably more so than in the first 2 movies combined, natuarally with 3 villans.)  It sure doesn't feel like everyone was simply going for a paycheck.  Still, Rami did bite off a little more than he could chew in this one, and it shows in places.I'll try not to spoil anything important (the array of previews have done enough of this already) but here's a brief rundown of all of the plot points that this movie has to work out:-Peter Parker and his relationship with Mary Jane.-Mary Jane Becoming jealous of Gwen Stacey's Affection over Peter/Spiderman.-Harry's/Goblin's vendetta against Peter/Spiderman.-Emotional moments with Peter talking to his aunt about marriage and the late uncle Ben.-Spiderman fights Sandman.-Spiderman deals the black suit.-Peter battles for the Daily Bugle photographer position with Eddie Brock....You get the picture.  There's more plots and subplots in this movie than the first two had combined, and there were more I didn't list for fear of giving the movie away.  In a lot of aspects, Rami and crew deal with these threads pretty well, spinning (no pun intended) them together well enough to be believeable.  In other times, the merging of these threads didn't seem so coherent.  It's kind of like when you're making a mixed CD and you have so many different songs that have to go into it, you kind of have to pick an order for them to be in and hope it sounds good when you play it.  In places it kind of felt like Sandman was in this scene simply becuse we haven't seen him in a while, and 'wow, we kinda forgot about the whole Harry plot thread, let's devote the next twenty or so minutes to that and we'll get back to the rest later.'  Still... considering how much this movie does, you have to give it credit for not being hollow and uninspired like X-Men 3.There is one subject that may have forgiven all of that had the movie done better with it... Venom.  Yes, he's in this movie as you've seen from the previews.  In a way, I almost wish that he hadn't been, and if they make another, I sure hope he's in that one.  Venom should be the main show, the big cheese of the Spiderman villains.  Unfortunately, he's introduced lat in the picture and doesn't get a lot of screen time.  It felt like they tried to make him a secondary villain and gave Sandman and Harry front seat... oh well.  At least he was in there.Overall, this is a great movie and I found myself highly entertained.  As far as acting and character development, it succeeds almost as well as the others and it's not at all lacking in some well deserved action.  Go see it and enjoy it thouroughly.

However, each villian contributes in substantive ways to the emotional climax. My biggest complaint is the reworking of how Peter's uncle died. It didn't quite fit with the original movie.I'm not sure what's wrong with the plot, but it just seems weak. It has been a while since I've read the comic book; however, this plot seems like a soap opera. Peter and his girlfriend have many troubles. However, they seem more like troubles kids would have in junior high rather than two adults in their twenties. For the soap opera plot devices: amnesia for Goblin is introduced; Goblin is then healed and is evil again; and then forces MJ to break up with Peter.  Also a character who is a top model, the commissioner's daughter, and is in all of Peter's classes is introduced just to make things complicated.Another problem with the plot is venom. A meteorite hits and it just happens to be a few hundred yards from where Peter is. This gives venom an opportunity to slither onto the Peter's scooter. Talk about Deus ex machina.The movie lacks humor also. There are a few very good lines, but on the whole it is not very entertaining.On the positive side, the CGI and other special effects were very good. The Sandman effects were very good. Spidey's swinging was even better than the last film. The acting was ok. I thought Church was very good. Maguire looked a little emaciated, he almost had the Gollum look going on in some scenes. There were musical numbers in this movie and they just did not fit.In summary, the movie is ok.

Munson,"[0, 0]","Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return once again in this third installment of the Spiderman series.Maguire revives his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  Peter's life is going very well; he's doing well in school and his relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) couldn't be better.  Plus, he's just saved the police chief's daughter from certain death.  Now, he's being awarded the key to the city.  Life couldn't be much better, right?  Wrong!Harry Osborne (Franco) still blames Spiderman for the death of his father.  So, Harry's taken on a persona of his own as the New Goblin.  He and Spiderman fight it out over New York, but Spiderman managed to knock Harry off of his futuristic surfboard.  Harry ends up in the hospital with a loss of memory.  For the moment, Harry doesn't remember anything of his encounter with Spiderman, and he and Peter become friends again (or so it seems).Peter learns more about the death of his uncle.  He finds out that the man who was arrested for the killing was not the killer at all.  The real killer turns out to be Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church).  He escapes from prison and flees from the police, but something happens to him as he's fleeing.  He runs into some sort of physics lab where his bodily chemistry is altered.  He can now assume shapes in the sand and turns once again to crime.  He and Spiderman have several run-ins, and he's given the name Sandman.Peter is also going through changes of his own.  Some symbiotic being has attached itself to Peter's Spiderman suit.  It gives him a new sense of strength and power, but it also takes its toll on Peter mentally.  He's become stronger, but he's also become more abrasive and brash.  Mary Jane has noticed the change in Peter, and she's feeling more distanced from him.  Mary Jane decides to visit Harry, and they share a kiss.  Mary Jane runs from the house, but the kiss has triggered Harry's memory.  He again goes searching for Spiderman.  The two fight it out, and Spiderman leaves Harry for dead.Another enemy for Spiderman emerges in this film.  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is a new reporter selling pictures to Peter's newspaper.  J.J. Jameson likes Eddie's pictures better than Peter's and tells Eddie if he can find a picture of Spiderman ""with his hands in the cookie jar"", he'll get the open reporter position on the paper.  Eddie submits a picture to J.J. of Spiderman holding a bag of money in front of a bank, and J.J. gives him the job.  Peter finds out and claims that the picture is a fake.  The paper finds out that the picture is indeed a fake, and Eddie is fired.  He vows revenge against Peter.  Eddie goes to church and hears noises from the bell tower.  The noise is Peter trying to rid himself of the symbiote.  The symbiote falls on Eddie and soon, he has transformed into Venom; a villian intent on destroying Spiderman.Soon, Sandman and Venom have teamed up in an effort to destroy Spiderman.  Eddie has captured Mary Jane and placed her 80 stories above the ground inside a taxi cab.  Peter sees the events unfolding on television and goes to help.  He first stops at Harry's house to ask for his help, but Harry doesn't give in (by this time, Harry's butler has told him the truth about his father's death).  So, Spiderman goes off to fight the two  villains alone.  Will Mary Jane survive?  Will Harry come to help Spiderman?I thought this was the best of the Spiderman movies so far.  The acting is great and its always nice to have the same actors continue with their roles in sequels.  There is a lot of action and characters to keep track of in this movie, but everything is tied up at the end.  The ending leaves the door wide open for a fourth installment, which I'm sure will be coming soon.I recommend this movie very highly.

The plot was so underdeveloped that it turn out to be ridiculous, Tobey Maguire's character has so many mood swings that I couldn't help but wish I saved my gas and ticket money. The villains were mediocre; the ones which should have had more time on screen didn't live up to their potential. We should have been warned when Raimi said in an interview that he was never a fan of Venom. Spiderman represents good, Venom is evil. It's a classic match up, yet Raimi decided to add 30 minutes of Peter Parker becoming emo, thrusting his hips, and a dance sequence. Why have an epic battle between good and evil when you shoot yourself in the foot and focus on hormones? I bet if I would have tried to come up with a way to ruin this movie, I wouldn't have come close to what Raimi accomplished.And two and a half hours?! They could've made probably 2 decent movies out of those 3 villains and made each one a normal length. Why they decided to fill in as many characters as possible and give them all a whopping 10 minutes of background is beyond me. These are comic book characters, they're hard to make believable in the first place. You really need to give a character like that some depth for an audience to not want to ridicule them. Sandman and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and that not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!This movie will continue to be seen by lots viewers so there's no point on recommending this. It does has some great action sequences and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once.",3,[3.5]--Not everything magically turns Out for the best in the end,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2521,"['Firstly', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'certain', 'extent', 'rest', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'disappointment', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'out', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'mood', 'swings', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'saved', 'gas', 'ticket', 'money', 'villains', 'were', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'when', 'Raimi', 'said', 'interview', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Venom', 'Spiderman', 'good', 'Venom', 'evil', 'classic', 'match', 'up', 'yet', 'Raimi', 'decided', 'add', '30', 'minutes', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'becoming', 'emo', 'thrusting', 'hips', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Why', 'have', 'epic', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'when', 'shoot', 'foot', 'focus', 'hormones', 'bet', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'ruin', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'close', 'what', 'Raimi', 'accomplished.And', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'probably', '2', 'decent', 'movies', '3', 'villains', 'made', 'one', 'normal', 'length', 'Why', 'decided', 'fill', 'as', 'many', 'characters', 'possible', 'give', 'whopping', '10', 'minutes', 'background', 'are', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', ""'re"", 'hard', 'make', 'believable', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'need', 'give', 'character', 'depth', 'audience', 'not', 'want', 'ridicule', 'Sandman', 'new', 'goblin', 'admirable', 'foes', 'shown', 'well', 'however', 'venom', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'came', 'far', 'too', 'weak', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'seemed', 'be', 'slipped', 'back', 'average', 'film', 'try', 'boost', 'ratings', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'cliffhangers', 'large', 'franchises', 'mean', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3rd', 'matrix', 'film', 'was', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'pointless', 'second', 'film', 'killed', 'off', 'point', 'third', 'however', 'full', 'venom', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'due', 'sheer', 'fantastic', 'reasoning', 'design', 'even', 'introducing', 'character', 'carnage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'rushed', 'film', 'not', 'way', 'win', 'over', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'new', 'fans', 'like', 'movie', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'seen', 'lots', 'viewers', 'point', 'recommending', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'cameo', 'was', 'fantastic', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'thinking', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'same', 'quality', 'attention', 'detail', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'watch', 'X-Men', '3', 'just', 'what', 'good', 'trilogy', 'spoilt', 'lack', 'development', 'need', 'force', 'many', 'characters', 'once']",Spider-Man 3

649769,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JPFH,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 0]","Spiderman 3 isn't as good as part 1 and 2 but it has pleanty of good moments for me to recommend it. It's missing something that the others had. It seems like it has a different screen-writer and I also missed Danny Elfman. When the film was being filmed I remember reading something about him actually never wanting to work with Sam Raimi again for some reason. So he's not back even if you do hear some of his original score here and there. I also think the story is sort of a mess, too much happening it once. It's sorta messy. I read the novel based on the movie before the movie came out and it's surprisingly more solid in some cases. I mean the stuff with the Sandman is better done in it and we understand him a bit more. The screenplay itself isn't developed well. It has it's scenes of emotion that do work but most of them come at the end.Yes we have scenes with crying and argueing but that can be more annoying than it's entertaining. Kirsten Dunst for instance, she rarely smiles in this movie! She just accuses Peter of stuff through-out and whines about her acting career. Oh of course she gets taken by the bad guys once again too. Bryce Dallas Howard looks her best ever! as Gwen Stacey and she's not even developed much. She's just around to make Mary Jane jealous but the film could've used more of her. She's fresh to the movies and at least is happy and doesn't complain. Plus James Cromwell (Babe) is a great actor but he's pretty wasted as well as Captain Stacy, Gwen's father.People complained that Topher Grace wasn't built enough to play Eddie Brock. Yes he's mis-casted but that's in style these days, I mean you have Heath Ledger playing Joker in the next Batman film for god's sake. I think Topher does a fine job even if I do think he would've been a great Spiderman if Tobey didn't come back. Through most the movie he has nothing to do but run around with a camera. When he becomes Venom he's awesome and Venom is awesome but he's not in the film enough. When you have 3 villians, Venom should of course take up most of the movie but he doesn't. We have Peter wearing the costume through a lot of the movie and when he does his hair turns black but no one even mentions once how odd it is that his hair keeps turning color back and forth. Anyway I guess that's not that important lol. The black costume is mostly used to show how Peter lets hate take over him and how it's not good to let hate take over. I would've preferred more of Eddie Brock as Venom though.The film has a lot of too many simple flaws. We're supposed to believe that the Sandman just does bad stuff for his daughter. Yet the script just has him looking at her pic all the time and she's not used the way she is in the novel based on the movie. The Sandman's emotional scene in the end just sorta comes out of nowhere. It was actually done better in the book  since you had the daughter involved. Plus you also had a part in the book where he turns into a sand castle for his daughter. The movie could've used that too. Instead he never gets to have as big of a presence as the Green Goblin or Doc Ock. Plus like I said, I liked Topher Grace as Eddie Brock but he wasn't used enough either. But unlike in the book it's never explained why he knows stuff about Peter and Spiderman now that he has the stuff on.I admit that the Harry Osborne stuff isn't done that bad though. Eventhough he has memory loss through most the movie and forgets that he blames Peter for his father's death. I've seen too much convenient memory loss in Smallville to wanna see it in Spiderman too lol. But I think the drama involving him is one of the stronger things the movie has going for it. Tobey Maguire is a good actor but in some scenes he didn't even look like he got in shape for the movie. I mean people have knocked Topher's built but he even looked in better shape. Tobey looked so bad in some scenes that I feared for his health. He has some scenes that he's really good and some that his heart barely seems like it's into the movie.

The series isn't losing momentum as sequels are produced, and I daresay the plot and dialogue are at least as good as either the first two movies as well as being far superior as far as the special effects go. Thomas Haden Church did a great job as Sandman, although I thought that Topher Grace was somewhat lacking as Venom. I thought the director did a great job handling several somewhat complicated plot lines, some of which had their beginnings in the earlier movies, but found the coincidence of Topher being in the same church where Spiderman was shirking his suit to be a little too contrived.  It was refreshing to see the ""Dark Side"" of Peter Parker, and the almost risque development of the Spiderman/MJ/Hobgoblin love triangle was bold and lent depth to the plot. The effects on the Sandman and Venom were marvelous, and complicated emotional twists having to do with the fine line between right and wrong did much to breathe new life into the franchise.  Don't wait for this on DVD: you're going to want to see it thrice on the big screen.The theatre was so packed that Tammie and I had to sit at the very front with our necks cocked back at a 125 degree angle, so I'll definitely be going back again when it's thinned out a bit, but still hasn't been moved to a smaller screen in the theatre.J.

649776,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B00005JPFH,Joe Carugati,"[0, 0]","When I saw ""Spider-Man 3"" on opening night, I was really let down. How could a film with great-looking villains, amazing special effects, and Peter turning to the dark side, be bad? Well, for one thing, as great as the villains and special effects looked, they lacked heart and soul. As for Peter becoming more hostile and evil, the filmmakers decided to make a joke out of it and the whole storyline lost its punch. Also, by adding more, useless Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn drama, the story became bloated, routine, and at times, boring. ""Spider-Man 3"" was the weakest of the trilogy.After finally watching the film for a second time, I found the film slightly more tolerable(mainly because I knew what I was in for). It still contained the same problems though. First, the storyline is filled with too many stories that are connected in totally unbelievable ways. Second, even though the audience has been close with the characters the last two films, Peter Parker, M.J. Watson, and others seem very one-dimensional here. Finally, when the film should have been serious, it opted for a more funny tone (which, ironically, I found not funny at all). Even though I have my complaints about the film, there are many parts that I did enjoy, mainly the special effects and fight scenes, James Franco's and Thomas Haden Church's performances, and in my opinion, the greatest scene of the trilogy, the creation of Sandman. These aspects elevate the film from being a waste of time.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is loving life. He has the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), he's doing well in school, and most importantly, his alter-ego, Spider-Man is finally being revered for all his hard work. Regardless of all the good things happening to him, there is still a lot he needs to deal with.First, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), knows he is Spider-Man and still places the death of his father in the web-slinger's hands. Harry eventually dons a new version of the Goblin suit, hoping to get revenge.Second, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual killer of Peter's loving uncle, escapes prison and ends up falling into a science experiment that turns him into the Sandman.Third, M.J. begins to move away from Peter to Harry. After her show does poorly and she's fired from the role, she begins to dislike Peter because of the success he is receiving as Spider-Man. When M.J. turns to Harry, Harry decides to use to his advantage to make Peter miserable.Four, an alien symbiote lands on Earth and similar to a parasite, uses Peter's suit as a host. When he dons his new black suit, he becomes more powerful, but at the same time, more aggressive and volatile. Once he finally gets rid of the symbiote, it finds a new host: Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes supervillain, Venom.Five...Six...Seven...Eight...The script is a mess. Besides what I mentioned above, there are many other stories in the film that deal with both Peter and Spider-Man. The main issue I have with the script is that it consists of coincidences. It's a coincidence that Spider-Man is fighting the villain, Sandman, who also happened to kill Peter Parker's uncle. It's a coincidence that the alien symbiote from space landed ten feet away from Peter instead of somewhere else on the planet. It's a coincidence that when Spider-Man rips himself free of the symbiote, his rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock, is right below him in some random church and then becomes Venom. Once he's Venom, it's a coincidence he knows that M.J. is Peter's love interest even though he's never seen her or the two together before. ""Spider-Man 3"" is ridded with all these situations that are unbelievable in terms of story and make the film much longer than needed.Maybe I'm being a tad harsh. After all, the film is based off a comic book. Yet, this doesn't excuse the poorly written characters. The audience has already learned and cared a lot about Peter Parker and M.J, but the third film does nothing new with them. Even though they are together, they are still having tough times to work things out, which I find quite annoying. At the end of ""Spider-Man 2,"" M.J. knew what she was getting into by being with Peter and how he wouldn't always be around for her physically. In this film, she pouts and whines, because Peter is never there for her, making the ending to the great ""Spider-Man 2"" look pointless. I wished that in this chapter they would have just been a happy couple and had M.J. more in the background of the story.In a superhero film, the villains are usually the most interesting and the fun part of the film is when our hero fights them. The problem with ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the villains are similar to their characters on a comic book page: flat. As cool as both of the main villains are, they lack any depth or real characterization. All the audience knows about Sandman is that he killed Uncle Ben and now he searches for money to help his daughter get better from some sickness. That's it. The most hurtful part of the film is that the coolest villain in the Spider-man universe, Venom, gets reduced to fifteen minutes of screen time. What's even worse is that he doesn't have a long tongue or a muscular body frame like the comics, but instead looks like black Spider-Man with a mouth like a raptor and a face that changes from the raptor mouth to Eric Foreman's face...I mean, Eddie Brock's face. Venom is just there. There's no real purpose for him to be in the story. If I had had my way, I would have let the ending of this one be Brock changing into Venom. That way, Sandman would have more time to develop as a character and then Venom could have his own film with Spider-Man. By throwing too many villains into the pot, the film suffers.My final problem with the film is the humor placed throughout. In the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, I laughed with the film when intentional, but in ""Spider-Man 3,"" I found myself laughing at what was happening on screen. Peter's transformation to the dark side is what I'm referring to. What should have been a serious moment in the film becomes incredibly stupid. For instance, when he walks down the street, he breaks out into dance and ""Saturday Night Fever"" type moves. It's really embarrassing. As I watched that scene, I cringed, wanting it to be over as fast as I could, but it goes on for a good five minutes unfortunately. Other ""funny"" moments throughout take the viewer out of the film, especially at the moments when the viewer is supposed to be most engaged in what's going on.Now, I can finally get on to what I did like about the film. First, the special effects are dazzling. If anything has improved throughout all the films, it's the effects. Sure, Spider-Man is still a computer's creation when slinging around New York, but he felt much more believable this time around. Second, the action scenes are well-done and plentiful. None are overlong (even though, Venom's should have been), but they are well shot and edited, especially the Sandman and Spider-Man fight in the underground. Third, the performances by James Franco and Thomas Haden Church are top-notch. While the film suffers from bad writing, these two are the only actors that truly make the most of it. Franco brings a much-needed warmth and charm to the film and his character stands out the most. Even though Sandman isn't a well-developed character, Church really makes the most out of it, which brings me to the best part of the film: the creation of Sandman.Watching grains of sand slowly come together to form Flint Marko is a spectacle. Even though it's totally unrealistic, the special effects team along with the help of Thomas Haden Church, make the scene believable. As Marko tries to form, he stumbles and chunks of sand fall away. Once he realizes what he's becomes, his face of sand changes expressions and with the aid of Christopher Young's score, the scene is just beautiful and breath-taking. It's my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. If the film had more scenes that had great special effects balanced with heart, then it would have been amazing.Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" is the weakest of the trilogy. It was the one I was looking forward to the most, but was let down due to the script, characters, and the humor. Thankfully, the special effects, action, a few performances, and the creation of a villain were able to make it a better film and redeem it from being a waste of celluloid.",3,Spider-Man

Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[0, 1]","I felt that the main story of the movie, the corrupting influence of the alien costume and the effect it had on Peter's life and relationships, was very well done. I liked the conflict between Harry and Peter and MJ and Peter as well.Warning - spoilers may follow.My biggest complaint, however, was the Sandman. There was so much ruined potential with his character.First problem with him was, he was NICE?!?! Why? What happened to evil villians? Why are they always just misunderstood people who made a mistake?I would have liked to see Sandman as a truly evil villian (maybe an assassign or a hitman).The movie losses one star for this.The second star lost is also Sandman related. Why did they have to change who killed Uncle Ben? The defining moment of Spider-Man's career, what turned him into a hero in the first place, is the realization that ""with great power comes great responsibility"". A realization he has when he discovers that the man who killed his uncle is the very same man he let get away. This movie robs the Spider-Man legend of that pivotal moment. Given this new scenerio, whether Peter stopped the thief or not, his uncle could have ended up dead. (Plus, what seems like justice in the first movie when the carjacker falls to his death, is overkill for nothing more than a stolen car - not that I don't think car theives should be punished, just not with the death sentence.)Now, I realize that they added this in order to give Peter a reason to become obsessed with the Sandman, but given the influence the costume was having on him, just a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Sandman could have done that.I also don't like the way Venom was completely wasted in this movie. I would not have put Venom in it at all (Sandman alone could have given Spidey enough trouble to seek out Harry's help). Venom would have been perfect for a movie all his own (have him bond with the alien costume at the end of 3), especially given the mind games he would play with Peter in his first appearences in the comics.In the end, this movie could have been great, but all the wasted potential and ""nice"" villians was infuriating.I was tempted to give this only 2 stars, but know I will end up getting this on DVD anyway, so bumped it up one.

649780,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JPFH,John F. Rooney,"[2, 3]","In Spiderman 3 Toby Maguire wears his nerdy, simpy, goofy look. The New York Times (11/1/08) refers to him as ""a bespectacled nebbish who has been bitten by a radioactive spider."" Along with that screwy appearance, he has an enormous ego which his girlfriend Kirsten Dunst finds extremely annoying. His Spiderman persona has made him insufferable because he's so stuck on himself. Kirsten is annoyed because she is trying to make it on Broadway, and she needs a boost. She gets the boot from her show, and he is unaware of it and continues to see himself as the publicly acclaimed super hero.Later in the movie he is taken over by some meteoric black sticky goo which makes his costume black, gives him extra strength, a lot of sex appeal, and an evil streak. For a time, he's a villain, but the movie already has three other villains to keep the audience busy. Nome of them are evil in the way that the Joker is in the new Batman (2008).Twice in the movie Spiderman villains seemed to have been dispatched forever, but to my dismay, the villains come back to haunt me, Spiderman and the audience for additional mayhem.There are three super-villains in this movie: the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin. All three of them seem to have good streaks in them as well. The Sandman didn't mean to kill Toby's uncle, and he loves his little daughter. William Dafoe makes a cameo appearance as the father of semi-villain Harry Osborne.Naturally there's a lot of action with vehicles being tossed around like toothpicks. No deaths of innocents are shown, but how scores escaped death is beyond me.There are a lot of yuks and campy spots in this movie.

Spider-Man (Tobey Mcguire) seems to have a sweet life especially as Spider-Man as he's New York's number one hero and celebrity, he wants to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him. However things go out of hand, a vicious criminal named Mark Flint (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison as he was the true original killer of Peter's Uncle Ben suddenly gets caught in a experiment involving nuclear sand he becomes a man that has the power to become sand named ""Sandman"". Peter's bestfriend Harry (James Franco) becomes a new Goblin to get revenge on Peter while our hero persues the Sandman to get revenge. Later, a black alien symbiote from another world attaches itself to Spider-Man's costume making it black and with more advanced powers then ever for he must fight with Sandman but the costume somehow changes both Spider-Man and Peter's personality especially with him having a possible relationship with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) making M.J. jealous. New photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) becomes Peter's rival and wants him to be fired so he can be the best photographer as later Brock will be absorbed by the black costume to become the fanged alien creature named Venom, only Spider-Man must the madness from within him and stop the madness going on.A weak but entertaining entry of the Spider-Man cinematic saga is not as great as the second movie or as good as the first movie but does have some good and bad points. The bad points is that it has a complex storyline that goes over some of the audience's head especially using three villains instead of one and a goofy moment where Peter starts to be like Jim Carrey's The Mask at the jazz-bar which seem to be out of place,  the villains weren't deep or developed enough like the last two ones. But there are good points like some the returning cast like J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris back especially a couple of cameos by Stan Lee, William Defoe, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell and there's some of Sam Raimi's trademark direction like in some of his films with stunning special effects even on Venom and good action sequences. It maybe the weakest of the series but it's still watchable and not as good as the first two, let's hope the fourth movie will be an improvement.This 2-Disc special Edition contains lots of great extras like filmmaker and cast commentaries, outtakes, music video, photo and still galleries, ""Grains of Sand-Buidling Sandman"" featurette, ""Re-Imagining The Goblin"" featurette, ""Covered in Black-Creating Venom"" featurette, ""On Location in New York and Cleveland"" featurettes, ""Inside The Editing Room and Science of Sound"" featurette, three stunts featurettes, ""Tangled Web: The Love Triangles of Spider-man 3"", featurette, ""Wall of Water"" featurette, Teasers, Trailers and international TV Spots.",4,A weak but entertaining entry in the Spidey saga!,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2842,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'a.k.a', 'Spider-Man', 'Tobey', 'Mcguire', 'have', 'sweet', 'life', 'especially', 'as', 'Spider-Man', 'New', 'York', 'number', 'one', 'hero', 'celebrity', 'ask', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'marry', 'However', 'things', 'go', 'hand', 'vicious', 'criminal', 'named', 'Mark', 'Flint', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'prison', 'was', 'true', 'original', 'killer', 'Peter', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'suddenly', 'caught', 'experiment', 'involving', 'nuclear', 'sand', 'man', 'power', 'become', 'sand', 'named', 'Sandman', 'Peter', 'bestfriend', 'Harry', 'James', 'Franco', 'new', 'Goblin', 'get', 'revenge', 'Peter', 'hero', 'Sandman', 'get', 'revenge', 'Later', 'black', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'world', 'Spider-Man', 'costume', 'making', 'black', 'more', 'advanced', 'powers', 'then', 'ever', 'must', 'fight', 'Sandman', 'costume', 'somehow', 'changes', 'Spider-Man', 'Peter', 'personality', 'especially', 'having', 'possible', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'making', 'M.J.', 'jealous', 'New', 'photographer', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Peter', 'rival', 'be', 'fired', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'photographer', 'later', 'Brock', 'will', 'be', 'absorbed', 'black', 'costume', 'become', 'fanged', 'alien', 'creature', 'named', 'Venom', 'only', 'Spider-Man', 'must', 'madness', 'stop', 'madness', 'going', 'on.A', 'weak', 'entertaining', 'entry', 'Spider-Man', 'cinematic', 'saga', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'second', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'complex', 'storyline', 'audience', 'head', 'especially', 'using', 'three', 'villains', 'instead', 'one', 'goofy', 'moment', 'where', 'Peter', 'be', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Mask', 'jazz-bar', 'seem', 'be', 'place', 'villains', 'were', ""n't"", 'deep', 'developed', 'enough', 'last', 'two', 'ones', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'returning', 'cast', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'back', 'especially', 'couple', 'cameos', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'William', 'Defoe', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'trademark', 'direction', 'films', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'Venom', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'maybe', 'weakest', 'series', 'still', 'watchable', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'let', 'hope', 'fourth', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'improvement.This', '2-Disc', 'special', 'Edition', 'lots', 'great', 'extras', 'filmmaker', 'cast', 'commentaries', 'outtakes', 'music', 'video', 'photo', 'still', 'galleries', 'Grains', 'Sand-Buidling', 'Sandman', 'featurette', 'Re-Imagining', 'Goblin', 'featurette', 'Covered', 'Black-Creating', 'Venom', 'featurette', 'Location', 'New', 'York', 'Cleveland', 'Editing', 'Room', 'Science', 'Sound', 'featurette', 'three', 'stunts', 'Tangled', 'Web', 'Love', 'Triangles', 'Spider-man', '3', 'featurette', 'Wall', 'Water', 'featurette', 'Teasers', 'Trailers', 'international', 'TV', 'Spots']",Spider-Man 3

He could have been cut out entirely and you never would have missed it.Thirdly, the plot hinges on geographic coincidences that would make a statistician slit his own throat in disbelief.And how many times can we hear Peter's Aunt May spout the same dialogue over and over again?  It seems like she gives the same speeches in each movie.  At about the 2 hour mark in this film, just when the audience is tired of it all and ready for the film to end, Aunt May launches into another one of her dialogue scenes that is so corny it made the audience giggle.The audience I saw this movie with was a large crowd made up of all types of people, and I could easily sense the audience's restlessness towards the end.  Few people seemed to like this movie and sure left the screening room in a big hurry when it was all over.This movie wasn't just disappointing, it was plain out insultingly bad.  Big budget, low creativity and originality.I decided before the film was even over that I would NEVER want to sit through this again.  Shame on Raimi for making such a piece of garbage.The special effects were spiffy and looked cool, but so what?",2,"Overlong, underwritten, and the weakest by far",1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,1657,"['first', 'two', 'Spidey', 'films', 'had', 'moments', 'film-making', 'wonder', 'awe', 'fun', 'one', 'simply', 'was', 'fun', 'was', 'by-the-numbers', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'executed', 'Read', 'First', 'off', 'note', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'brother', 'not', 'more', 'seasoned', 'screenwriters', 'was', 'case', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'case', 'have', 'made', 'huge', 'difference', 'script', 'weak', 'lazy.Secondly', 'inclusion', 'Sandman', 'character', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'entirely', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'it.Thirdly', 'plot', 'hinges', 'geographic', 'coincidences', 'would', 'make', 'statistician', 'slit', 'own', 'throat', 'disbelief.And', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'hear', 'Peter', 'Aunt', 'May', 'same', 'dialogue', 'over', 'again', 'same', 'speeches', 'movie', '2', 'hour', 'mark', 'film', 'just', 'when', 'audience', 'tired', 'ready', 'film', 'end', 'Aunt', 'May', 'one', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'so', 'corny', 'made', 'audience', 'giggle.The', 'audience', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'large', 'crowd', 'made', 'types', 'people', 'could', 'easily', 'sense', 'audience', 'restlessness', 'end', 'Few', 'people', 'seemed', 'like', 'movie', 'sure', 'left', 'screening', 'room', 'big', 'hurry', 'when', 'was', 'over.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'disappointing', 'was', 'plain', 'out', 'insultingly', 'bad', 'Big', 'budget', 'low', 'creativity', 'originality.I', 'decided', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'would', 'NEVER', 'want', 'sit', 'again', 'Shame', 'Raimi', 'making', 'such', 'piece', 'garbage.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'spiffy', 'looked', 'cool', 'so', 'what']",Spider-Man 3
649785,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00005JPFH,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[11, 20]","I waited a long time for this movie to come out. I watched the trailers with anticipation and slowly awaited its release into theaters. I heard great stuff about this film. ""The best spider man"" or ""best movie of the year"". So yeah, I had some pretty high hopes for this movie. Would Harry try to get back at Parker? Would Parker marry Mary Jane? Would Jamison finally get off spider man's back?Then I saw the movie. Well actually, I almost didn't, because I almost fell asleep half way through. The whole movie was boring from the opening to the cry baby ending. Nothing here was fun; even the bad guys were stupid. How can you have venom in your movie and have it suck? That takes skill, or lack of skill.this movie suffers from Pirates of the Caribbean 2 syndrome, which is basically ""bigger is better, so lets jam as much stuff into a movie as we possibly can."" yeah, pirates was a complete flop because they tried to jam too much into the movie, and this one is the same. There are too many sub plots and no main plot. i mean come on, first we have sandman trying to get money to save his daughter (subplot 1) then spider man basking in his new fame and glory (subplot 2) then Harry trying to kill spidy and then being put in a coma and losing his memory, so now he doesn't even remember his fathers death (subplot 3). then Mary Jain losses her job and starts hating parker for being insensitive (subplot 4) and then spidy gets attacked by dark matter turning him into a bad guy (subplot 5) then parkers job is threatened by a new photographer (subplot 6) then Harry wakes up from his comma and starts going after peters heart, sound familiar? (Subplot 7). Not to mention the revelation that sandman was uncle bens real killer (subplot 8). Good god, that a lot of stuff. there's enough here to make two or three movies, but instead of doing that they decide to jam it all into one three hour movie (that's way too long by the way. the LOTR could pull that off, but not SM). What is missing though in this movie is a central plot. Unlike the first two movies there is no central plot that the rest revolve around. In the first it was Parker tying to learn how to use his powers properly and fight off Green Goblin, in the second it was Parker trying to juggle being a college student, spider man, his love life, his job, and his friends all at the same time and failing badly. Here it's just a jumble of subplots thrown in together with no logical thinking behind it. What is the main plot? Please, fans of the movie tell me. Was it spidy turning bad? Was it Sandman killing his uncle? What was it? Everything in this movie is just sort of randomly thrown together. After the first hour I got bored and almost fell asleep but couldn't because the lady sitting to me was eating her popcorn too loudly. too bad, I could have caught up on my sleep, but no, I had to watch this movie till the bitter end.And don't even get me started on the ending. First of all didn't the scene where Mary Jane is stuck in the wed and the cad is slowly making its way down to her look kind of similar to a scene in Jurassic Park? Yeah, I think it did. Second, when did spidy become so much of a wimp? I mean really, I know he was outnumbered, but he is a veteran super hero, while sandy and venom were newbie's. Couldn't he have at least put up a halfway decent fight?  I don't want to ruin the ending for you but pretty much think of the most clich&eacute;, corny, idiotic thing that could possibly happen and that is the ending. I'll give you a clue, it involves Harry.And after the battle when everyone was crying and boohooing I was just rolling my eyes. Everyone cries at the end, even sandman. How can he cry? He's made of sand. Now don't get me wrong, I like sad movies (read some of my lists and you can see that for yourself) but the ""sad"" ending in this movie was so over the top, so corny, so clich&eacute;, that I almost threw my popcorn at the screen in frustration.Another thing that annoyed the heck out of me was that the characters would constantly say and do the absolute worst things they could possible can at the absolute worst times. Mary Jane is going through a rough time, so Parker kisses another girl in public and then doesn't understand why she's upset. Please...Overall this movie sucked. Nothing good here, not even the fight scenes. You should still go see it just because, but don't expect anything like the first two movies. This one was bad, plain and simple. if you read thsi review, whether you agree with me or not, please leave a comment.",1,The biggest disappointment since Pirates of the Caribbean 2.,1178755200,"05

649786,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B00005JPFH,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[2, 3]","Based on when I saw it in theaters in May.""Spider-Man III"" turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I thought it would be and I had somewhat high hopes for it, especially after ""Spider-Man II"" let me down a bit, wait make that a lot.I'll try not to break down a huge synopsis of the film, but it picks up where II left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to balance life as Spidey, his job and his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Of course his friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) is still mad at him for killing his dad and a good action/fight sequence follows where Harry dons the new Goblin gear and attacks Peter when he's just in his regular clothes. Some good, no great special effects and sprinkled throughout the fight and Harry ends up bumping his head and loses his short term memory for a while, which is prolonged longer than it should've been in this overly long film.There's also an escaped convict (Thomas Hayden Church) who gets turned into a pile of sand that can take human form, sort of like Imhotep in ""The Mummy"", but this time the effects and the character, though somewhat cool seem unnecessary and no more than filler.There's also an alien symbiote that bonds with Peter and makes his suit a cool looking black, amplifies his power, brings out his aggressive side towards his enemies and others and makes him act like a fool around women.Obviously, like in the comics and cartoons, the symbiote will attach itself to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and become the ultra cool villain Venom and here in lies the biggest problem with the movie. By the time the symbiote dettachs itself from Peter and attachs to Brock to become Venom, the film has lost quite a bit of steam, though Venom looks cool, he's not in the film nearly enough, which was a big minus, but unfortunately I expected that to happen.There are some neat sequences in the movie, the aforementioned Goblin/Peter fight, a couple of the Sandman fights and the scenes with Venom, but too much of the movie is sappy and bogged down with trying to add sympathy, when it should be having a little more fun.One of the film's biggest problems, besides Venom's lack of screen time, is the fact that too many scenes throughout the movie feel like individual scenes and don't really have a lot of flow to them, which really detracts from what could've been a great, fun movie.It's still a fun movie for the most part, there's good humor (not the iced-dairy product) in some of the scenes, like almost any line or reaction by J.K. Simmons who plays Jameson, loved when he walked in on his secretary and Peter flirting and he says ""Ms. Yates, that's not the position I hired you for"". I also enjoyed Bruce Campbell's appearance as the Matre'd at a French Restaurant, very funny stuff, ""I am French"".Too bad there wasn't more to the movie besides the visual effects and humor, which should be more than you need for most summer movies, but this one felt like it needed more.The acting wasn't too bad, actually Church did a great job creating emotion for the Sandman character, but again it started to feel sappy after a while, same goes for Harry as the Goblin. A lot of the acting was not that good either and again the scenes seemed separate from each other, no real flow.After watching the movie twice, once with my two best friends and others at a midnight show, which was fun for the crowd reactions and again a week or so later with my girlfriend, I summed up the movie with the following assessment ""It felt too long, but rushed at the same time"", a lethal (and not the good kind of lethal) combination.Not a bad movie, but no where near as good as the first and it doesn't give me as much hope as I had before of another three or possible four sequels still to come, if the rumors are true.",3,"Spider-Man III, the best Spidey yet...... or not.",1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,3792,"['Based', 'when', 'saw', 'theaters', 'May', 'Spider-Man', 'III', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bigger', 'disappointment', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'somewhat', 'high', 'hopes', 'especially', 'Spider-Man', 'II', 'let', 'down', 'bit', 'wait', 'make', 'lot.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'huge', 'synopsis', 'film', 'up', 'where', 'II', 'left', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'trying', 'balance', 'life', 'Spidey', 'job', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'course', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'James', 'Franco', 'still', 'mad', 'killing', 'dad', 'good', 'action/fight', 'sequence', 'where', 'Harry', 'new', 'Goblin', 'gear', 'attacks', 'Peter', 'when', 'just', 'regular', 'clothes', 'good', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'sprinkled', 'fight', 'Harry', 'up', 'bumping', 'head', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'while', 'prolonged', 'longer', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'overly', 'long', 'also', 'escaped', 'convict', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'who', 'turned', 'pile', 'sand', 'can', 'take', 'human', 'form', 'sort', 'like', 'Imhotep', 'Mummy', 'time', 'effects', 'character', 'somewhat', 'cool', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'also', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'bonds', 'Peter', 'suit', 'cool', 'looking', 'black', 'power', 'out', 'aggressive', 'side', 'enemies', 'others', 'act', 'fool', 'around', 'women.Obviously', 'comics', 'cartoons', 'symbiote', 'will', 'attach', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'become', 'ultra', 'cool', 'villain', 'Venom', 'here', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'time', 'symbiote', 'dettachs', 'Peter', 'attachs', 'Brock', 'become', 'Venom', 'film', 'lost', 'quite', 'bit', 'steam', 'Venom', 'cool', 'not', 'film', 'nearly', 'enough', 'was', 'big', 'minus', 'unfortunately', 'expected', 'are', 'neat', 'sequences', 'movie', 'aforementioned', 'Goblin/Peter', 'fight', 'couple', 'Sandman', 'fights', 'scenes', 'Venom', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'sappy', 'bogged', 'down', 'trying', 'add', 'sympathy', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'having', 'little', 'more', 'fun.One', 'film', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Venom', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'fact', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'feel', 'individual', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'lot', 'flow', 'really', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'fun', 'movie.It', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'humor', 'not', 'iced-dairy', 'product', 'scenes', 'almost', 'line', 'reaction', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'who', 'Jameson', 'loved', 'when', 'walked', 'secretary', 'Peter', 'flirting', 'Ms.', 'Yates', 'not', 'position', 'hired', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'appearance', 'Matre', ""'d"", 'French', 'Restaurant', 'very', 'funny', 'stuff', 'am', 'French', '.Too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'movie', 'visual', 'effects', 'humor', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'need', 'most', 'summer', 'movies', 'one', 'felt', 'needed', 'more.The', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'actually', 'Church', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'emotion', 'Sandman', 'character', 'again', 'started', 'feel', 'sappy', 'while', 'same', 'Harry', 'Goblin', 'lot', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'again', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'separate', 'other', 'real', 'flow.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'twice', 'once', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'others', 'midnight', 'show', 'was', 'fun', 'crowd', 'reactions', 'again', 'week', 'so', 'later', 'girlfriend', 'summed', 'up', 'movie', 'following', 'assessment', 'felt', 'too', 'long', 'rushed', 'same', 'time', 'lethal', 'not', 'good', 'kind', 'lethal', 'bad', 'movie', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'first', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'hope', 'had', 'three', 'possible', 'four', 'sequels', 'still', 'come', 'rumors', 'are', 'true']",Spider-Man 3

I wasn't terribly impressed with Spiderman 3, even less than the second film. Much of the same action takes place, far too much CGI for my eyes to digest. The plot continues as Peter Parker gets more comfortable being Spiderman and is a little less awkward and clumsy as before (well, sort of).He and Marry Jane are due to be married, and his best friend Harry turned ""Green Goblin"" is out to destroy Spiderman for the death of his father, the original Green Goblin.Two new characters are introduced, Sandman and Venom (I'll get to those in a bit). A mysterious asteroid plummets and hits smack dab in the middle of New York, and wouldn't ya know it? Within walking distance of Peter and Marry Jane (how convenient).A weird, alien parasite creeps from the asteroid and hitches a ride on Peter's mope head. We also learn of The Sandman who is supposedly the real murderer of Peter Parker's Uncle. The sandman wasn't always the Sandman, as we get to see his creation due to his escape from jail and on the run from police to his unfortunate timing and ""science"" mishap.Pete begins undergoing strange behaviors as the mysterious, black, alien substance finds its way onto his outfit. Parker then seems to pretty much act like a jerk to everyone and pushes Marry Jane further and further away. Pete discovers the origin of not only his behavior, but his bad luck as well and literally tears it off of himself; there under ""convenience"" his next nemesis is born, ""Venom"" as the alien substance finds a new host...someone caught in the wake of Spiderman's own bad behavior and vows to destroy Spiderman. In the end, Peter makes good with his friend Harry and the two duke things out with Sandman and Venom. We find out that Peter's Uncle's death was an accident, and well...Harry sacrifices himself for his buddy and Venom is obliterated from existence.There are far too many subplots and things going on in the third installment, not that you can't follow it...but even in comic book terms...this would take many issues to develop instead of being summed up inside of 2 1/2 hours. The CGI was too much, although the action sequences would not have been possible without it. I didn't care much about Sandman, nor did I Venom or even Harry as the ""New Green Goblin"". The characters (as hard as Rami tried) were as one dimensional as the comic characters, actually...allot worse. I hope that Sam Rami, a director who I admire has Spiderman out of his system and moves onto bigger and better projects? I ultimately hope for a return and continuation of ""The Evil Dead"". Spiderman 3 is watchable, but only good for one viewing.

It has high production values, state-of-the-art special effects, and a good music score by Christopher Young(Young keeps some of Danny Elfman's Spiderman themes and motifs). Spiderman 3 does have too many subplots and characters crammed into one movie. The scenes with evil, ego-driven, emo-Peter Parker are campy and over the top. Spiderman rescues Gwen Stacy and he forgets to stop the out of control crane! Venom was hyped as the main villain, but he gets little screen time. The colors blue and black are flavored in many scenes. The film also uses a soap opera style cop out in order to give Harry Osbourne amnesia! Still, Spiderman 3 has some solid action scenes and I like the creepy screaming that comes from the black, slimy, alien symbiote.There was a Mad Magazine spoof of Spiderman 3. It showed images of Spiderman saving Gwen Stacy and letting three people fall to their death! The film takes us back to the origin story where we find out that Flint Marko/Sandman was the real killer of Uncle Ben! Spiderman and Gwen Stacy spoof the upside down kiss from the first Spiderman movie. Spiderman 3 portrays its heroes as selfish and the villains as human. Director Sam Raimi left the Spiderman movies to work on horror movies such as Drag Me to Hell(2009).

649793,A168KINQ59CZOZ,B00005JPFH,Josh B.,"[2, 5]","This movie should have focused solely about Peter and Harry's feud that was building up through the events of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. (And maybe they could have fit Dr. Connors turning into the Lizard if they would have written it correctly.)At the end of Spidey 2 Harry finds out who Peter is and wants to seek revenge on him for his fathers death because he believes Peter killed him. He finds his fathers Goblin gear and chemical compound. So the audience assumes he's going transform himself into either the Green Goblin or maybe even the Hobgoblin. Instead in Spider-man 3 he becomes this weird new character on a flying skateboard that does not resemble the original Green Goblin at all. And as bad as that was, thats what the whole movie should have mainly focused around.But the studio had its mind set that they absolutely must introduce Venom in this movie. It was not up to Sam Raimi (the director) at all. So they forced the whole symbiote saga into this movie. I'm not even going to go into how horribly they executed this, (emo Peter Parker) and how rushed it felt. But in the end Venom shows up at the end of the movie for like 20 minutes. In my opinion (and many others) Venom is the BEST Spider-Man villain and they only gave him 20 minutes!!!??? This symbiote saga could and should have easily been its own movie or even 2 movies for crying out loud!!!!Then if that not bad enough, in this movie they also have the villain Sandman. Thats right 3 villains in one movie. They did try to give the character of Sandman more backstory than he originally had in the comics, but the story they gave him was awful and it destroyed the original story of how Uncle Ben died. I actually enjoyed Thomas Haden Church's performance as Sandman, but this absolutely should not have been in this movie. The movie already had too much in it, this just made it WAY over the top.If all that wasn't enough they decide to make Peter and Mary-Jane split up and introduce Gwen Stacy and Peter's new love interest in this train-wreck of a movie.So I give this movie 2 stars. The only reason it doesn't get just 1 star is because I am a big Spider-Man fan and the entire cast came back and tried to save what they must have known was going to be an awful movie. They were set to start filming Spider-Man 4 for release in Summer 2011 but the entire thing fell apart weeks before shooting was scheduled. I can only assume the script was even more awful then Spidey 3 and no re-write in history could save it. So the entire cast and Sam Raimi decided to split. That is probably fantastic news for all Spidey fans for not having to witness another train-wreck movie.So if I could have done this, Spidey 3 would have been about Harry and Peter's feud and possibly  would have brought in the Lizard. Spidey 4 would have introduced the symbiote via the space shuttle crash like it should have been. It could have had black-suited Spidey vs. Sandman or some other villain and in the end teased the audience with Venom. And then Spidey 5 would just be the all out Spidey vs. Venom movie that everyone would have wanted to see, and they never would have had to reboot the franchise as early as they had to.",2,This movie is a TRAIN-WRECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,3193,"['movie', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'solely', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'feud', 'was', 'building', 'up', 'events', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'turning', 'Lizard', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'correctly', 'end', 'Spidey', '2', 'Harry', 'out', 'who', 'Peter', 'seek', 'revenge', 'fathers', 'death', 'Peter', 'killed', 'fathers', 'Goblin', 'gear', 'chemical', 'compound', 'audience', 'going', 'transform', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'maybe', 'even', 'Hobgoblin', 'Instead', 'Spider-man', '3', 'weird', 'new', 'character', 'flying', 'skateboard', 'not', 'resemble', 'original', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'what', 'whole', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'mainly', 'focused', 'around.But', 'studio', 'had', 'mind', 'set', 'absolutely', 'must', 'introduce', 'Venom', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'director', 'forced', 'whole', 'symbiote', 'saga', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'go', 'how', 'horribly', 'executed', 'emo', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'how', 'rushed', 'felt', 'end', 'Venom', 'up', 'end', 'movie', '20', 'minutes', 'opinion', 'many', 'others', 'Venom', 'BEST', 'Spider-Man', 'villain', 'only', 'gave', '20', 'minutes', 'symbiote', 'saga', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'own', 'movie', 'even', '2', 'movies', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Then', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'villain', 'Sandman', 'Thats', 'right', '3', 'villains', 'one', 'movie', 'did', 'try', 'give', 'character', 'Sandman', 'more', 'backstory', 'originally', 'had', 'comics', 'story', 'gave', 'was', 'awful', 'destroyed', 'original', 'story', 'how', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'died', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'performance', 'Sandman', 'absolutely', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'movie', 'already', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'made', 'WAY', 'top.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'decide', 'make', 'Peter', 'Mary-Jane', 'split', 'up', 'introduce', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Peter', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'train-wreck', 'movie.So', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'reason', ""n't"", 'get', 'just', '1', 'star', 'am', 'big', 'Spider-Man', 'fan', 'entire', 'cast', 'came', 'back', 'tried', 'save', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awful', 'movie', 'were', 'set', 'start', 'filming', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'release', 'Summer', '2011', 'entire', 'thing', 'fell', 'apart', 'weeks', 'shooting', 'was', 'scheduled', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'script', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'awful', 'then', 'Spidey', '3', 're-write', 'history', 'could', 'save', 'entire', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'decided', 'split', 'probably', 'fantastic', 'news', 'Spidey', 'fans', 'not', 'having', 'witness', 'train-wreck', 'movie.So', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Spidey', '3', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Harry', 'Peter', 'feud', 'possibly', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'Lizard', 'Spidey', '4', 'would', 'have', 'introduced', 'symbiote', 'space', 'shuttle', 'crash', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'black-suited', 'Spidey', 'vs.', 'Sandman', 'other', 'villain', 'end', 'teased', 'audience', 'Venom', 'then', 'Spidey', '5', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'out', 'Spidey', 'vs.', 'Venom', 'movie', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'as', 'early', 'had']",Spider-Man 3
649794,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B00005JPFH,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[2, 3]","I was really looking forward to this movie.  I really liked the first two.  Let me start out by saying that I watched this over two nights.  I did not feel like staying up until past midnight.  At first I thought the story was going to be about spider man vs The Sandman.  The Spiderman killed him (or so he thought.)  The His old friend whos father died in the last movie (the boy blamed spiderman)  looses his memory.  He gets it back and now it's him vs spiderman.  Then when I was getting into it The Sandman comes back and gets spideys friend to join him.  Ok I was a little erked then but it was ok.  I said it's just a movie.  THEN Spiderman gets this black goo stuff.  Kind of like a virus.  It takes him over and makes him turn mean.  It makes him real cockey and he stops thinking it bad to hurt his enemies.  Ok now I'm mad because already here are 3 stories going.  Then when I just about had enough Spiderman gets the stuff of of him and it goes onto someone else.  It goes onto Tofers character.  NOW there is a Sandman, a scientific ex spidey friend and a mutated spiderman trying to take down spidey.  Ok I think to myself, OK SOMETHING BETTER HAPPEN.  Well then Spiderman talks to his old friend and he decides to help him.  The Sandman tells Spiderman all about what happened when he killed his grandfather.  Spiderman tells him he isn't mad at him anymore and that he forgives him.  So now here I am, after seeing like an hour and a half of two enemies trying to kill Spiderman turn into either his friend or just turning into dust and flying away I'm a little milfed.  Siderman then gets the stuff off the evil Spiderman.  Let me just say something happens to the character he gets out.  I will not tell you what, for if I do then the movie will have no suprises at all.  BUT don't let that make ou feel good.  What happens happens so fast it's just over.  I don't even remember the last 10 or so minutes of the movie.  Oh and I forgot the part where Spidermans exfriend talks Spideys girlfriend into telling Spiderman she wants to move on and that they can;t go out anymore.  What it comes down to is this.  This could have been a good movie using just one of the many enemies they had spiderman face.  It is as though they had 3 or four differen't movies and said ""hey guys, instead of taking the time to make 4 movies.  Let's just through all this crap into one and save the time.  We know well make alot of money off of it because it's Spiderman.""  Well I was sad to see a movie that had the possibility to be such a great movie, come out so bad.  I hear there is a 4th movie beng made.  All I can say is this.  If any of the crew that has anything to do with the story and plot is reading this.  ""Just have one good solid story.  A great story can change your life.  I am reading a book now that has me so drawn into it.  It is harry potter 6.  The one story is amazing.  I leave my body when I read it and I awake in a world not of my own.  For this book brings in into a new existance.  One story.  one main purpose.  One main objective.  That is what makes a great story.  Not a bunch of action shots and fight scenes.""  Actually even the graphics are bad.  I mean the look amazing but you can see the fakeness of them.

""Let's give Spidey 3 a try"".Boy am I sorry we did!Let me start with the ONLY good thing about this movie.  The special effects.  That should be a given, and is not enough to make this review rise above 1 star.Other than that, this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I urge you not to waste your time on this.The acting is so bad and seems so forced in almost every scene, I can't help but thinking that the big wig just had to give up, and release it the way it stood.I can't imagine how this ever made it out...That someone didn't have the guts to say...""We're not going to release this crap...are we?""That's how bad this movie is.There is one section called ""Bad Peter"", where Peter Parker acts out, while wearing the ""black suit"" under his regular clothes.

I tried to reconcile with something in my limited ""Comic book"" background....but NO.  It's just bad.  It's so laughably bad, it not even funny.The title for my review came, after I watched the full movie, and then watched the bloopers.In the movie there are one or two scenes with Harry's butler, where he vindicates Spider-man from Harry's father's death.

They did it right in Spider-Man 2 by hiring Michael Chabon to co-write the script.  Based on the evidence of the other two films, he brought a much-need sensibility to the project.Part of the problem is that Spider-Man 3 is over-stuffed.  This is the same mistake that plagued the Batman sequels, as well as X-Men 3.  It tries to tell the Black Costume Saga, as well as the Venom Saga, as well as the Green Goblin II Saga, AND be a sequel to the previous two films (not to mention throwing in the Sandman too!).  Perhaps they thought that this would be the end of the franchise and they wanted to get everything out of the way.  The film opens with Peter Parker getting a swelled-head from all the acclaim Spider-Man is receiving and turning into a jerk.  All this seems very uncharacteristic of him and I spent the beginning of the film wondering if the symbiote had already attached itself.  When he does don the black costume, Peter Parker suddenly looks like Robert Smith from The Cure, and he REALLY becomes a jerk.  The worst scene in the film involves a musical/dance number that looks like it should have been in The Mask, not Spider-Man.The result of all this is that not everything gets the attention it deserves.  Venom fans will be most disappointed in this film.  He should have had his own movie.  Instead, he is treated almost as an after-thought.  He is not true to the comic-book character and unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to have his face revert to Eddie Brock almost every time he speaks.Supposedly, there will be three more Spider-Man films.  I don't know what the rest have in store - it feels as though they've exhausted their possibilities.  There are a lot of good things in this film - it is worth seeing.

649801,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPFH,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","After two hugely successful films, ""Spiderman"" and ""Spiderman 2"" respectively, Sony Pictures `Spiderman' franchise was definitely at the top of its game entering into the third, and for the moment, the supposed final chapter in the `Spiderman' series, at least as far as stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst may be concerned (their contracts were only good for three movies). So, with the primary cast assembled once again, Sam Raimi back in the director's chair, and also serving as co-writer with his brother Ivan and acclaimed writer Alvin Sargent (""Spiderman 2""), the latest chapter for good ol' web head was shaping up to be just as epic, and no doubt visually amazing, as its predecessors. Throw in a few more villains than usual, Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), to mess with Spidey's life and loves, along with a certain black space goo that will bring out the worst in Peter's psyche, and Spiderman may just be in for a bigger fight than even he can handle. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker/Spiderman, and all those aforementioned talented people responsible for bringing the character to life, must face the daunting task of attempting to top the first 2 films; but hey, superheroes are used to the odds being stacked against them so this film may have ended up being just business as usual for Spidey, but only time would tell.""Spiderman 3"" begins with Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) becoming swept up in his own hype as the citizens of New York are embracing a sort of Spidey-mania craze. As happy as Peter Parker/Spiderman's life seems to be, events are being set into motion that will soon bring him down off of his high. Peter's girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having difficulty finding success on Broadway, and with Peter's newfound arrogance, she is slowly beginning to get jealous of his rising popularity. Also, Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), has embraced his father's dark ways and has become the New Goblin, and his only goal is to see Spiderman pay for his father's death. As if this old friend turned new villain, and the possibility of losing his longtime love wasn't enough to deal with, a new super-villain is created in the form of the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). To top things off a strange alien substance has landed on Earth, and has found a kind of kindred spirit in the newly arrogant Spiderman, and as it bonds to its new host, the alien symbiote begins to slowly corrupt Spidey's soul, until he no longer knows who he truly is any longer. This time the odds may just be too much for Spiderman to handle by himself.If there is one thing that can be said about ""Spiderman 3"" that audiences and critics everywhere can agree on, it's the fact that this film is definitely the biggest in the franchise thus far. That aside, ""Spiderman 3"" found our hero not just in new territory by facing more than one villain in the film, but also finding himself disliked by many movie critics and audiences. Where the first two films were universally liked by everyone, this movie split audiences fairly even in their reactions to it. Many felt the story was far too bloated, with way too many new characters introduced, which resulted in uneven character development in some instances, giving the movie a disjointed feel that lacked the smooth flow of the previous two films and even made it a little difficult to follow. Another problem some audiences had was that the movie seemed to focus more on action than on the personal dramas being played out by the characters, not to mention the ending left people a little cold due to some corny dialogue between Peter and Harry, and a somewhat sappy and unbelievable resolution to the Sandman conflict. For those that enjoyed the movie, there were still some gripes that were shared with those that disliked it, but for the most part the gripes didn't seem to affect their view of the movie too much. I for one enjoyed ""Spiderman 3"", but found it to be the least enjoyable out of the series so far, still it's better than a lot of the action movies that Hollywood churns out. I agreed with some of the sentiments from those that hated the movie, but found some of their thoughts to be off in my opinion. Where I agree the most with those that disliked the film, is in the disappointing resolution to Sandman's conflict with Spiderman, especially in light of events that had occurred moments before between the two characters, but apparently Sam Raimi and his writers liked the resolution, though one does wonder why. Although, it did seem as if the writers were trying too hard to top themselves, which is a possible explanation for why this movie had so much going on, I must disagree with those who found the movie to be too hard to follow or lacked any sense of flow, apparently those audience members must not have been paying attention during the movie.The cast for ""Spiderman 3"" continues the tradition of excellence that this series had set forth with the very first movie. Tobey Maguire once again portrays the dual persona of Peter Parker/Spiderman, and this time he gets to show off a new side to Peter that had previously remained untapped, which would be his darker side. This element to the character's story arc was on one hand one of the true highlights of the film, but on the other was one of the film's weak points. I enjoyed seeing an angrier, more aggressive Spiderman, and the black suit definitely looked sleek and cool; however, I grew tired of Peter's darker side being essentially an uber-nerd, granted this is most likely true to character, but a little less of this side could have been shown and I would have been much happier, I especially could have done with some editing during the sequence where Peter is checking out all of the ladies on the streets of New York (too much cheese for my taste). Kirsten Dunst looked much better as Mary Jane Watson in this film than she did in ""Spiderman 2"", I don't know what happened in the previous movie, but she looked way too pale and even a little unattractive, not to mention the redness in her hair didn't even come close to matching her color in the first film. Thankfully, the make-up and wardrobe department must have heard the complaints from moviegoers that felt the same way about her in ""Spiderman 2"", and appeared to work harder at matching the hair color from the first film, and actually applying make-up and putting her in clothes that were more stylish and attractive. I mean come on, this is a girl who is supposed to be an actress, yet she dressed in such an unattractive manner that I didn't like seeing her on screen that much, so it was a welcome adjustment in that respect. From a character standpoint, Mary Jane didn't seem to evolve much over the course of this film, her anger at Peter was understandable in certain instances, but in others seemed rather juvenile and out of character. James Franco seemed to really come into his own with Harry Osborn this time around, as he embraced the darker side of his character to become the New Goblin. Other returning favorites, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, were enjoyable as always, but I found myself wishing for a little bit more Jonah when this film was all said and done. Joining the cast was Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways"") as the villainous Sandman, he definitely looked the part, but sadly he wasn't given as much to do as I would have hoped and his character felt a little underused in favor of giving more attention to the other villains in the story. TV star Topher Grace (""That 70's Show"") was perfect as the smooth-talking and morally challenged, Eddie Brock, who begins to develop a hatred for Peter Parker and Spiderman, and eventually comes into contact with the very alien symbiote that is plaguing Peter to become one of comic book fans favorite Spiderman villains of all time, Venom. I enjoyed the addition of Venom as a villain for Spidey, but I thought that he would have been better suited to be the only villain in the movie, rather than sharing the stage with two others, plus I wish they would have chosen to have Venom speak more in his monstrous form instead of having the symbiote pull back to show Topher's face a majority of the time... oh well, nothing's perfect I guess.Another highlight for ""Spiderman 3"" and the previous two films as well, were the numerous visual effects employed throughout the course of the movie. The effects department was definitely at the top of their game for this movie, the fight scenes were visually stunning and exhilarating, moving at an almost break-neck speed. The CGI for Sandman and Venom was among some of the best I have ever seen captured on film, and you could definitely see that no expense was spared in bringing these popular characters to the screen, and audiences absolutely loved it, regardless of what their overall opinion on the movie may have been.In the end, ""Spiderman 3"" was an entertaining installment in the franchise, and would be a fitting end to this hero's journey if that is what is decided. However, I must agree that the story did seem a bit bloated at times and some judicious editing could have been done to smooth things out a little more. Although there were times that I found myself wishing for things to have gone differently over the course of the film, overall I enjoyed the experience of watching this movie, and will continue to enjoy it time and time again.""Spiderman 3"" is rated PG-13 for mild language and violence.",4,Every Hero Has a Choice...,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,9564,"['two', 'hugely', 'successful', 'films',

Best special effects out of all 3 and did not seem to have the number of visual errors the other 2 had. Kirsten Dunst still makes a great Mary Jane and best character acting to date is Rosemary Harris as May Parker with Jk Simmons as J.Jonah Hameson second.Bruce Campbell in the restaraunt bit, best cameo of all 3 Spiderman Movies for him.Thought all the actors did a pretty good job all came off as believable.Could have been done better. The directing on Toby Maguire as Peter Parker, lines were dilvered great as spiderman, always seems a little off as Peter Parker.The bad:Spiderman still has no Webshooters, He's a genius and created is own webmaking fluid, This should have stayed in since the beginning.The whole ""Bad"" Peter Parker/Spiderman bit went on way too long don't know if they just needed filler space or what. Could have cut that down to 30 seconds. It was just dumb.Time line is ..WAYYY out of whack. Actual readers of the comics will vouch for this. It was a little hard buying the Sandman story line the way it was presented in the movie.

Too many characters, not enough character development, too long, you know something along those lines. Although 3 villains may seem like too many it didn't feel overcrowded. In this third segment Peter Parker deals with so much but don't fear because spidey appears or does Venom. In the beginning it's all about Peter Parker and how big his ego is getting.Everybody loves Spider-Man; he took care of his school and work problems, and best of all he has Mary Jane. What more could Peter ask for but during his short period of joy three things are in the process of attempting to destroy Spider-Man. The first is of course the New Goblin (Harry Osborn) who wants revenge for what Spider-Man did to his Father. The second being Flint Marko who just escaped from prison and eventually becomes the Sandman. Parker's third problem is that Venom just landed on earth and is looking for a host preferably a Spider-Man.A huge series of events occurs after these three including one at the end that is hard to believe but will excite many. After thinking about how the film began and ended I understand how some people feel. I think that Spider-Man 3 is an amazing movie but it will create problems for the Spider-Man films to come, that's if there will even be future films. So much drama is added to all these films because of Mary Jane and I imagine that her damsel in distress act will get old quick. Without her these films don't have much of a story or a heart, they wouldn't be able to have a deep story. They need something else other than Mary Jane, how long will she hold up because she is and will always be the target but that is his one weakness so I guess it's cool for now.Good bad villains were used in this especially the popular venom. I can only imagine that should there be a 4rth film that Carnage is next up to fight. The films pacing was pretty good, good suspense and great action, this may have been the most exciting of the three. The cinematography was great, acting was good, and the fight sequences were on point. The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 has to be that the usage of the villains went a little wrong but because these characters are not exactly human there is so much that can be done with them in the future. Where do you think Carnage comes from? There would be no him without Venom. Spider-Man 3 is a great film that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer.

MY. GOD.).With the amount of character content that was introduced in this latest installment, I think Sam Raimi did an outstanding job. He gave the fans exactly what they had been looking and asking for. Of course, any one of the villains this time out could have had their own Spidey film (and perhaps should have) but again, the fans had spoken and to me, it was handled marvelously.The character and story progression was handled very well. The action was just what you've come to expect from Raimi (and he didn't disappoint!)and the pacing was just enough that I didn't find myself restless at anytime due to the length of the film. I think that Raimi presented us with one of the truest presentations of comic-to-film adaptations possible, and no one can take that away from him (THE most true to date - TO ME - was SIN CITY, Rodriguez just dumped the film straight from the comic to the screen with that one). I loved the Goblin upgrade. I loved the Sandman CGI and battle sequences with our hero. I loved Venom (although, admittedly, wished that there could have been more time with him) and the over-all satisfaction and relief I felt after 1st hearing that there was even going to BE an S3 (you kind of get a little worried about sequel disappointment - ""awww maaann, they should have stopped at 2"" Blade 3 anyone?).Of course it was far from a flawless film but the things that I would pick on that I didn't like would probably be glossed over by someone else (I LIKED the little dance number Peter had and the Travolta, 'Saturday Night Fever' shout out Raimi added)so I won't bore you with what I felt were shortcomings and let you make your own decisions.What it boils down to is Yeah, I'd recommend this film to my pickiest friends with a cheese eating grin on my face and two thumbs way the heck up. I could get into some of the other unfolding story and character points but honestly feel that you'd like to see what they are for yourself (and hope you won't think me a sucky reviewer after seeing it).

649807,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPFH,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 7]","To start off this review, I'd like to give a brief plot synopsis:  Peter Parker's got the girl, got the old friend back, got the fame (as Spidey), and got no problems.  Then, petty criminal Flint Marko (who's got no money but does have a really sick daughter) gets some sandy powers and uses them to his advantage.  Then, Peter gets some galactic goo on his Spidey suit and gets more power (think HGH for superheroes).  It all goes to Peter's head and then he loses the girl, loses the old friend (but gains back an enemy), loses the fame, and takes on a ton of problems which include (but aren't limited to) competing photographer Eddie Brock.  It all sounds sort of like a very long and jumbled country song, doesn't it?  Well, in all honesty, that's sort of what this film is.The film starts with Peter on top and then he is taken down hard, very hard, by co-screenplay writer/director Sam Raimi and screenplay writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent.  Sam Raimi does an excellent job with this film considering the massive amount of subplots that this story deals with seemingly all at once.  He develops the new villains of Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) as best as he can.  He also tries to bring to a close the love triangle of Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osborne.  He also throws in a bit of jealousy between Peter and MJ via the introduction of Gwen Stacey.  We also get to catch up with Aunt May and Jonah Jameson.The story is held together rather well so long as it's just Spidey either fighting with Sandman or the new Goblin.  Heck, even Peter Parker's lovelife makes a little bit of sense so long as it's just him, MJ, and Harry.  Things don't get messy until Gwen Stacey and her boyfriend/photographer Eddie Brock enter the fray.  That's where the train leaves the tracks.  It's the same old song and dance as what happened to the ""Batman"" franchise once the Catwoman and Penguin were coupled together to cause problems for Batman.  The movie becomes rushed, characters are dealt with too quickly in order to make room for other characters, and plotlines are tied up too neatly or just left by the wayside.  That's the major problem of this film.Had Venom/Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace) been left out of this film, it would have been perfect.  Instead, we get a second-rate, rushed treatment of the Venom character and Eric from ""That 70's Show"" with an attitude and muscle to back it up.  Every time Brock popped up on the screen (with or without his symbiote companion), all I could think of was Eric getting razzed by Kelso or beat up by Donna.  Grace was miscast for this part.  He's not a bad actor.  It's just that Eddie Brock is played out too closely to Grace's Eric Foreman character from ""That 70's Show.""  Gwen Stacey is easy on the eyes and does a decent job of stirring things up between Peter and MJ, but the character doesn't belong in this film either.  It would have been much better had she and Eddie Brock been removed from the film completely.  In fact, Sam Raimi admitted that early on he didn't want Venom in this picture.  It was only after a little nudging from producer Avi Arad that he came to like the character's addition to the story.Otherwise, the film is outstanding.  Spiderman's battles with the new Goblin and Sandman are excellent and rival the brutal confrontations that Spidey had with Doctor Octopus in the second ""Spiderman"" flick.  They beat the heck out of each other.  The special effects are very good and Sandman's action scenes channel ""The Mummy"" with all the dust flying around.  I even enjoyed Peter Parker's ""Saturday Night Fever"" foray.  I found it to be quite funny, although it did run just a tad bit too long.The cast, excepting Topher Grace, was wonderful.  Tobey Maguire has a solid hold on the character of Peter Parker and much like Christopher Reeve as Superman, he'll be the only person worthy of being the Webslinger.  Dunst does an excellent job as MJ.  James Franco, despite having to struggle for screentime with Sandman and Venom, does a good job as Harry Osborne/New Goblin.  His character, in my opinion, developed the most in the second film and he carries that development over to this sequel well.  With little character development Church still manages to pull at the heartstrings as Sandman.  His character is given only a basic treatment so that we only understand why he's a criminal and why his fate in the film is what it is.  Bryce Dallas Howard does a good job as the airheaded Gwen Stacey.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Raimi stalwarts Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi, do excellent jobs with their limited rolls.So why four stars?  For the simple fact that this really is an excellent film considering how much information is processed in its 140-minute runtime.  Other than the unnecessary villain cluster that hampers the tale, ""Spiderman 3"" plays well as an action yarn and even as a moral story of personal responsibility over selfish acts.  If a fourth film is made (and I seriously doubt that Maguire or Raimi will be returning), I hope that Spidey's villain count is lowered to one.  If you enjoyed the other ""Spiderman"" films, you'll enjoy this one.  It loses its way here and there but is, overall, a very good action film.",4,The Web Gets Crowded,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,5257,"['start', 'off', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'brief',

Even if they had said it was made out of some kinda dark matter molecular energy it would have given some credability to the story. This film is also guilty of a major sequel no no. Changing the story line to fit the movies plot. With the sandman's charecter being incorporated into the story line back in the first film. Not to mention this movie is needlessly too long .

649813,AJW6KG5ATLE8H,B00005JPFH,"K. Olsen-Keyser ""BookChick""","[1, 1]","Raimi commits the ultimate sin of comic book movies - too many villains and too much going on. There are essentially four villains in this movie - Eddie Brock, Venom, The Sandman and Harry Osborn. Trying to squeeze all their stories into a cohesive script must have been a daunting task but could have easily been avoided by not having as many characters to develop in the first place. The result is a valiant but wholly unentertaining attempt to force a storyline from the cluttered lives of the bad guys and the already complicated existence that Peter Parker and M.J. share.The romance between Peter and M.J. takes center stage once again as we find our hero trying to live a managed life of being a super and boyfriend to a woman who needs full time attention. There are many opportunities for Peter and Aunt May to discuss the love of his life and Raimi makes sure we see them all. Pound for pound, there are just about as many heartfelt discussions during this movie as there where fight sequences.Topher Grace was a strange choice to play Eddie Brock but he does an admirable job of bringing the character to life. True to the comic, Brock is a journalist competing with Parker however, vying for a job with the Daily Bugle rather than working for rival newspaper Daily Globe. Topher's comedic timing carries him through most of the film and while this Brock may not be entirely what fans are expecting, Topher makes him work in this film.Why Gwen Stacy shows up in this script at all is complete mystery. Bryce Dallas Howard is an extremely talented actress but Miss Stacy has no place in the story besides acting as ""the other woman"", a title easily given to a contrived character.Kirsten Dunst continues her role as Mary Jane Watson, aspiring actress and all around party girl. There are some fantastic ""couples"" moments between the two including a classic restaurant scene that was not only amusing but a great example of the problems faced when being in love with someone more famous than yourself.While Thomas Hayden Church may have been a decent choice of actors to portray The Sandman, how the character fits into Peter Parker's life is forced. Loosely based on the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man storyline ""Sandblasted"", this Sandman appears to be responsible for the death of Uncle Ben. Hayden Church is a fine actor but The Sandman would have been better served if a full movie had been dedicated to the complex character rather than a measly one fourth.The special effects for Venom where right on target, however, when an actor signs on to essentially become a CGI based character, the movie goer ie: the person paying good money to see said special effect,is entitled to see that effect in all it's glory, not the face of the actor. The same goes for the ripped mask effect of Spiderman. Rarely in the comic does Spidey have his masked shredded. Clearly it is only to give more ""face time"" to Tobey Maguire.(An excellent example of an actor never showing his true face in a movie is Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta - kudos to Weaving for putting the character above and beyond his own agenda as an actor!)The real shame of this movie was in the treatment of Harry Osborn. Raimi and company did a fine job of extracting the manipulative, sadistic and insane side of Harry creating the ultimate foe for Spiderman. If the entire movie had been dedicated to the struggle between Harry, Spiderman and the Venom entity sans Eddie Brock, the audience would have been satisfied. Instead, Harry goes from sinister to sap with very little screen time explanation. It is truly a shame that Raimi did not focus more on the decline and rebirth of Harry as the Green Goblin and design a decent costume for the charcter rather than the not so frightening ""paint ball mask"" look. Also, rather than show the deep psychosis that plagued Harry much as it did his father, Harry comes to terms with his evil side not within his own mind but with the help of his butler, a moment better suited for Bruce Wayne than anyone in the Osborn family.Lastly, never has anyone seen so much song and dance in an action movie. Borderline ridiculous, Raimi's treatment of Spidey gone bad is one part hokey and three parts quirky leaving the audience not sure if they should laugh or stare at the screen blank faced.Overall, this fan girl is deeply depressed and confused as to how one of the greatest comic book adaptations of our time could have fallen from grace so completely. If there is to be a Spiderman 4, for the love of Stan Lee, don't let Sam Raimi write it!",2,"Three words sum up Spiderman 3 - Sloppy, ridiculous and sappy.",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,4556,"['Raimi', 'ultimate', 'sin', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'too', 'many', 'villains', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'are', 'essentially', 'four', 'villains', 'movie', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Trying', 'squeeze', 'stories', 'cohesive', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'daunting', 'task', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'avoided', 'not', 'having', 'many', 'characters', 'develop', 'first', 'place', 'result', 'valiant', 'wholly', 'unentertaining', 'attempt', 'force', 'storyline', 'cluttered', 'lives', 'bad', 'guys', 'already', 'complicated', 'existence', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'M.J.', 'share.The', 'romance', 'Peter', 'M.J.', 'center', 'stage', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'hero', 'trying', 'live', 'managed', 'life', 'being', 'super', 'boyfriend', 'woman', 'who', 'full', 'time', 'attention', 'are', 'many', 'opportunities', 'Peter', 'Aunt', 'May', 'discuss', 'love', 'life', 'Raimi', 'sure', 'see', 'Pound', 'pound', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'heartfelt', 'discussions', 'movie', 'where', 'fight', 'sequences.Topher', 'Grace', 'was', 'strange', 'choice', 'play', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'admirable', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'True', 'comic', 'Brock', 'journalist', 'competing', 'Parker', 'however', 'vying', 'job', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'rather', 'working', 'rival', 'newspaper', 'Daily', 'Globe', 'Topher', 'comedic', 'timing', 'most', 'film', 'Brock', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'what', 'fans', 'are', 'expecting', 'Topher', 'work', 'film.Why', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'up', 'script', 'complete', 'mystery', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actress', 'Miss', 'Stacy', 'place', 'story', 'acting', 'other', 'woman', 'title', 'easily', 'given', 'contrived', 'character.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'role', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'party', 'girl', 'are', 'fantastic', 'couples', 'moments', 'two', 'including', 'classic', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'amusing', 'great', 'example', 'problems', 'faced', 'when', 'being', 'love', 'someone', 'more', 'famous', 'yourself.While', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'choice', 'actors', 'portray', 'Sandman', 'how', 'character', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'life', 'forced', 'Loosely', 'based', 'Friendly', 'Neighborhood', 'Spider-Man', 'storyline', 'Sandblasted', 'Sandman', 'be', 'responsible', 'death', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'fine', 'actor', 'Sandman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'full', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'dedicated', 'complex', 'character', 'rather', 'measly', 'one', 'fourth.The', 'special', 'effects', 'Venom', 'where', 'right', 'target', 'however', 'when', 'actor', 'signs', 'essentially', 'become', 'CGI', 'based', 'character', 'movie', 'goer', 'ie', 'person', 'paying', 'good', 'money', 'see', 'said', 'special', 'effect', 'entitled', 'see', 'effect', 'glory', 'not', 'face', 'actor', 'same', 'ripped', 'mask', 'effect', 'Spiderman', 'Rarely', 'comic', 'Spidey', 'have', 'masked', 'shredded', 'Clearly', 'only', 'give', 'more', 'face', 'time', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'excellent', 'example', 'actor', 'never', 'showing', 'true', 'face', 'movie', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'kudos', 'Weaving', 'putting', 'character', 'own', 'agenda', 'actor', 'real', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'treatment', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Raimi', 'company', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'extracting', 'manipulative', 'sadistic', 'insane', 'side', 'Harry', 'creating', 'ultimate', 'foe', 'Spiderman', 'entire', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'dedicated', 'struggle', 'Harry', 'Spiderman', 'Venom', 'entity', 'sans', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'Instead', 'Harry', 'sinister', 'sap', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'explanation', 'truly', 'shame', 'Raimi', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'more', 'decline', 'rebirth', 'Harry', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'design', 'decent', 'costume', 'charcter', 'rather', 'not', 'so', 'frightening', 'paint', 'ball', 'mask', 'look', 'Also', 'rather', 'show', 'deep', 'psychosis', 'plagued', 'Harry', 'much', 'did', 'father', 'Harry', 'terms', 'evil', 'side', 'not', 'own', 'mind', 'help', 'butler', 'moment', 'better', 'suited', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'anyone', 'Osborn', 'family.Lastly', 'never', 'anyone', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'song', 'dance', 'action', 'movie', 'Borderline', 'ridiculous', 'Raimi', 'treatment', 'Spidey', 'gone', 'bad', 'one', 'part', 'hokey', 'three', 'parts', 'quirky', 'leaving', 'audience', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'laugh', 'stare', 'screen', 'blank', 'faced.Overall', 'fan', 'girl', 'deeply', 'depressed', 'confused', 'how', 'one', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'grace', 'so', 'completely', 'be', 'Spiderman', '4', 'love', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'write']",Spider-Man 3

The third installment opens happily enough with MJ starring on Broadway and Pete about to propose.  Of course, sticky situations start popping up right away, beginning with a creeping tar-like substance from space that attaches itself to Peter, changing him from sweet Spidey to mean-spirited Black-suited Spider-Man.This would have been enough conflict to deal with for a very good movie, but, unfortunately, we are introduced to two new villains - Sandman and Venom, as well as pal Harry Osborn (James Franco)'s New Goblin.  The first two films had one villain to focus on, but this is too much; none of the story lines has a chance to develop and the movie gets too crowded and choppy.  Toss in the third retelling of Uncle Ben's death and Bryce Dallas Howard in a thankless role and we end up with a disappointing movie.We do get to see Tobey Maguire show a wider emotional range this time, which is good; he starts as the loveable geek and changes into a conceited and nasty guy who thinks he's a macho muffin, strutting down the street like John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever.""  Dunst is fine as the long-suffering girlfriend and struggling starlet, and Franco gives a strong performance as the loyal pal turned arch villain.

I'm glad that Toby did his best in this one as this will be his last appearance as Spider-Man.  Best of luck to the new actor who will replace him.In Spider-Man 1, I could not get over that metallic mask of the Green Goblin.  I mean, really!  In part 2, I guess I just wasn't fond of the whole Dr. Octopus storyline.  Anyways, you have to watch the first 2 in order to fully understand part 3.  But, even if you don't, you won't be entirely lost because part 3 will play some scenes from the first 2 as flashbacks.So, what's happening here?  Spidey is at his all-time high as the residents of NYC are loving him.  Life is just grand for Peter Parker/Spider-man.  He's in love with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson.  He's even thinking of proposing to her.However, things immediately go downhill once Mary Jane has been booted from a Broadway play.  She finds solace in Harry Osborne, who is suffering from amnesia, because Peter Parker is too ""full of himself"".Predictably, Spider-Man finds himself in trouble...not just with one villian but with three!  Venom!  Sandman! And the Goblin (Harry himself).  Plus, Peter Parker is slowly losing Mary Jane.  The question is, can Spider-Man fight them all simultaneously?  Can Peter win MJ's heart again?Anyways, Spider-Man 3 is a wonderful film.  I love how they've added humor at the appropriate time and place.  My favorite part was when Peter was bonding with the Venom symbiote.  He's physically aggressive but at the same time, overly confident with the women around him.  He does these silly little dance movements.Marvel fans can spot Stan Lee anytime, anywhere.

649821,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPFH,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","When the review of ""Spider-Man 3"" in our local paper came out and trashed the movie I was braced for the worse, although since there were four midnight showings on opening day it seems obvious this movie is going to make a lot of money (at least this first weekend).  But I really did think it would be nigh impossible for this 2007 film to be better than its 2004 predecessor, which is my favorite comic book movie to date (a verdict I render as someone who teaches comic books in general and Spider-Man in particular in my Introduction to Popular Culture course).  ""Spider-Man 3"" certainly has its flaws and it is not as good as ""Spider-Man 2,"" but those things do not add up to the film being a disappointment.For Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Spider-Man these are the best of times.  Spider-Man is beloved by the people of New York City and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) has given Peter the engagement ring that she received from Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) a half-century earlier so that he can propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  But Harry Osborn (James Franco) knows that Peter is Spider-Man, believes Spidey killed his father Norman (Willem Dafoe), and has found the secret Green Goblin hideout.  So right off the bat he comes gunning for Spider-Man.  This seems like they are trying to wrap up a loose plot thread from ""Spider-Man 2,"" but this is but one of the several major pieces this movie puts in place for the endgame.  Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) has broken out of jail and become the victim of one of those classic comic book situations where science turns a man into a monster, in this case the Sandman.  When Peter finds out it was Marko who actually shot Uncle Ben he takes his first step off the deep end.  Peter also has problems in that ambitious Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace) wants Peter's job as a photographer at ""The Daily Bugle,"" where J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Then there is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter who gets rescued by Spider-Man and has a big old crush on the web-head, and the sticky black thing from another planet that has attached itself to our hero.  No wonder the movie runs 140 minutes.Director Sam Raimi pours on the special effects in the computer generated fight sequences.  What made Doctor Octopus a great villain for a Spider-Man movie was how the two could fight on both the horizontal and vertical axises.  Obviously that continues with Venom and to a lesser extent with Sandman, but what those two villains have in common is the fluidity of their ""costume"" and ""body"" respectively.  They have fun making Spider-Man's costume all torn and tattered, but that is nothing compared to what they are able to do with Sandman's face and body in these fight sequences.  When Spidey fights the New Goblin (and there is a reason Harry is not running around as the second Green Goblin), it looks more like a high-speed video game with everything happening faster than the eye can see (compare that with the great fight between Peter and Harry when they are not wearing their costumes).For me the problematic character is Gwen Stacy, because in the original ""Spider-Man"" comic books Gwen was Peter's girlfriend long before Mary Jane became his wife.  Given the relatively small number of Spider-Man movies that you can make, it made sense to skip Gwen and have Mary Jane there from the beginning, even if it meant turning her into the girl next door instead of the sexy redhead in the go-go boots.  But we now know that Peter ends up with MJ, just like we know Clark Kent ends up with Lois Lane and Bruce Wayne is never going to get married.  So Gwen's mere presence is problematic because she cannot be the woman he loves who dies because he is Spider-Man.  In the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" comic book MJ is there from the beginning too, knowing Spider-Man's secret identity, and the integration of Gwen's character into that revision of the story was okay, but it did not have the significance or resonance of the original storyline.  The movie Gwen is more like the comic book Mary Jane and that whole plot line would have worked better with Betty Brant (Elizabeth Banks) or an entirely new character than resurrecting Gwen Stacy.Besides the delicious irony that the blond Dunst has died her hair red while the redheaded Howard has gone platinum, I was bothered by how they had Gwen be a model.  Mary Jane was the model and that was important because just like Peter it was a mistake to take her at face value.  Instead Dunst gets to sing a couple of songs and while the movie agrees she is not good enough to sing on Broadway it seems a strange way to create a crack in her self-confidence, especially given that nobody faked self-confidence better than MJ.  But they are fully committed to the idea of Mary Jane as the girl next door even if they have yet to figure out what that means for the character and her relationship with Peter.  Howard is not given much to do, although her last moment is her character's best, and the same goes for James Cromwell as Captain Stacy.  But Bruce Campbell completely steals his one scene, Mageina Tovah as Ursula steals a couple, and Stan Lee has his best ""Spider-Man"" cameo to date, but Dylan Baker's Dr. Curt Connors is still no closer to turning into the Lizard.The main element they have kept from ""Spider-Man 2"" is the idea that the conflict between Spider-Man and his foes is no longer black and white, but shades of gray.  I liked that for once Doctor Octopus was not a ranting lunatic with mechanical arms but a good man turned evil by a fateful accident (the flip of what happened to Peter Parker) who refuses to die a monster.  It was that moment more than Mary Jane discovering that Peter was Spider-Man that really gave ""SM2"" its weight.  This time around there are important shadings for Flint Marko and Harry Osborn, just as there are for Peter Parker as his black Spider-Man costume gets the better of him (but Eddie Brock, Jr. is bad to the bone from start to finish).In the end I round down on ""Spider-Man 3"" because I think they are overdoing it with Spider-Man's mask coming off or being half torn (even though I understand the impulse to have the face of the actor you are paying millions to actually appear on screen), the comic relief from spectators during the big battle at the end gets in the way of the developing tragedy, and the fade out scene was by far the weakest of the series to date.  I am also not happy with the way Peter's character is regressing, because even before the symbiotic flips him to the dark side he is embracing his inner nerd way too much.  Maguire is hysterical when he has Peter strut himself down the street, but it rings wrong for the character.  Also, even with the swelled head he is getting from the public adoration as Spider-Man, I do not want to believe that having the costume on when he receives the key to the city was enough to let Peter betray MJ the way he does there.  The scene later on at the Jazz club is the insult; it was the other that was the real injury part of the equation.  Still, I bet I make it back to the theater to see this one again.",4,"""Spider-Man 3"": flawed but generally absorbing comic book movie",1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,7160,"['When', 'review',

649822,A3SSWZCKFB38VI,B00005JPFH,LazerBlader,"[0, 0]","Quite possibly one of the most expensive movies in history and definitely one of the years most highly anticipated, Spider-Man 3 finally premiered last of all last Friday, May 4th, 2007 (It opened everywhere else internationally on May 1st). I was fortunate enough to attend my local theater's midnight premiere of the film and at the cineplex, anyone could have told you this movie was anticipated. But in the end, how did it measure up?First off, the positives of the film. One of Spider-Man 3's best aspects undoubtedly was the special effects. SM3 utilized a new array of computer graphics programs given for use by Sony exclusively. And it sure paid off - New York never looked more brilliant, Sand-Man had lots of clear...sand, Venom was looking ferocious and more daunting than any other SM villain, and of course Spidey himself was in top-notch shape. All the fight scenes were thrilling to experience and the transitions from live-action actors and settings to CGI were seamless. Tied along with direction by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 3 has developed into a visual delight for film goers and Spidey fans alike.It also appears the crew didn't slack off in the areas of sound design and musical score either. All the sound effect and engineering was beautifully done. Pieces of a New York skyscraper falling apart, landing down below produced realistic impact effects. Most notably were the voice effects done with Venom's character: the shrilling heart-piercing cries and screams of the symbiotic villain frightening that I ever anticipated. Accompanying throughout the film was of course, the musical score. This time around SM3 featured a different composer than the original Danny Elfman of the first films, due to rough times working with Raimi the composer said. The film's new composer (Christopher Young) decided to keep the already existing themes of Spider-Man and the Goblin intact and with the new themes and scores, managed exquisitely to retain the wondrous feel of Elfman's original score while still creating a whole new tone for the third film.The picture's acting was overall well performed and convincing. The three title roles played by Tobey Maguire, James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst should never be replaced in my humble opinion and the casting of these three was one of the best decisions I've ever seen for any comic book movie or movie at that. The same applies to Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons as Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson, respectively. However, the villains are a different story. Casting of Venom and Sand-Man are not bad, per se just not the best I thought they could have been. Yet in no way did the actors bring the production's quality down in any way.Next, the not-so-great parts of Spider-Man 3. A major complaint made by many including myself is the film's inclusion of too many villains and storylines. So much of the film felt rushed. Sand-Man seemed a bit unnecessary and wasn't nearly as daunting as previous villains in the series. Venom at times seems cartoony and his presence in the film was fleeting. With both of these villains, there could have been much more time dedicated to devleoping their characters and such. By the final ""boss fight"" like sequence, it'd felt that the characters had been somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. Venom especially had so much potentially, being one of Spider-Man's most iconic and deadly villains. Again, less storylines and more emphasis on a few.Humor. In the first and second Spider-Man films, comedic sequences were added at just the right amount, like sprinkling on an ice cream sundae. Unfortunately, Sam Raimi enjoyed dousing on the sprinkles too much with our Spider-Man 3 sundae, saturating the film with humor, an unbelievable amount of it. In fact, you could almost consider the film a comedy at times. While funny at first, the humor sequences started appearing in scenes where they really didn't need to be and completely ruined the seriousness and concentration of other scenes. Many times throughout the film I wondered, "" Why? Raimi, Why?!""Finally, Spider-Man 3 exhibited something I thought was on par if not better than any of the other films at that. The ending. With what was already laid out and done, I don't think Raimi could have given us any better of an ending than he already did. Sure Venom was killed of a but too quickly and abruptly, but he had to be for heaven's knows if there will be a Spider-Man 4, especially with the massive mixed reviews coming out from critics. The final battle sequence will go down as one of the most epic in all of film history. It is the one point in the film in which we truly see what Sand-Man and especially Venom can do. 3's ending battle sequence also featured a brilliant Spidey team up with the enlightened Harry Osborn. At last there is the movie's gorgeous, emotional ending. As Sand-Man explains what really happened to Ben Parker, we finally see Peter find closure and he heroically forgives the Sand-Man. The last image of the sandy Flint Marco is of his dissipated grained body flowing throughout New York, presumably to finally help his daughter. Lastly is the death of the troubled Harry Osbourn who at last proved his heroics  and forgiveness of his true best friend. The New York morning sun rises and Harry slowly slips into death, creating the saddest ending of any comic book movie. Shockingly, I had a few tears roll down my cheek as peace unraveled on screen. What can I say? Beautiful. Just beautiful.Overall, at this point, I'd have to put Spider-Man 3 on just about same level as the second one however if not a little lower. The worst aspects of the movie in this film were really prominent in this time around. As to how it compares to the rest of the series and whether it really deserves a 4/5, I won't be able to make that call until I rewatch Spider-Man 3 once more. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.For everyone else, just go see it!Spider-Man 3 : Three out of Five- = Too many villians and storylines running, excessive humor, less-than-perfect villain casting+ = Amazing special effects, spectacular fight scenes and sound effects, good music score, very emotional and beautiful ending.",3,A less than perfect finish to the Spider-Man

649831,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JPFH,"Maine Writer ""David""","[4, 10]","And, so, I'll give Spider-Man 3 a nostalgic 3 out of 5 stars.I so wanted to love this movie. I liked the original Spider-Man, which was really fun, but didn't bear up during repeating viewings. Still, it was thrilling to watch, and captured Spidey's origins perfectly, even if the villain never really seemed particularly villainous. And then I really, really liked Spider-Man 2. It had the right mix of tenderness, energy, and action, and a fight sequence on a train that I'll never forget. The image of Toby Maguire trying to stop a speeding train was amazing, as was the touching carrying of his body by the appreciative men and women whose lives he saved. Simply poetic (as films, and even comic books, can sometimes be).Spider-Man 3 was a big let down for me. From a higher altitude, it has a bloated and a serviceable, but deeply flawed, script. The story has moments of real joy, energy, pathos and humor, but they're stuck in this undisciplined soup of emotions and transparent plot devices. It could have used a solid rewrite or two, and a hefty pair of scissors.The result is that the previously multi-faceted Spider-Man gets depicted in these broad, one-note strokes. His role is filled with repetitive beats, and instead of a clear character arc, he flips this way and that, black suit then not, until finally it's hard to figure who he is at the end of the film. How many times do we need to be hit over the head to figure out that Peter Parker is oblivious to the problems that beset his diva girlfriend? And because the story is so long and bloated, it forces us to swallow just one too many doses of the sage Aunt May (enough already with the dime store philosophy and the frugal nobility) and far too much of the whiny Mary Jane (who gives ""emo"" a new meaning). Why the heck does he want to marry her anyway? For a life of that? Gwen Stacy comes blowing in as this sweet, sensible, and shockingly gorgeous lab partner, and who does he want to be with? (Why didn't anyone tell me that Bryce Dallas Howard was such a knockout?)James Franco does a good job emoting, but, like the rest, fights against a meandering character arc that simply doesn't ring true or reflect the streamlined economy of a carefully crafted script. Also fighting the bloat is Topher Grace, who shows some wonderful comedic physicality, as well as deft handling of dialog. We don't get enough of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. We never do.There are some great effects, terrific fights, and magnificent visuals. There are scenes that not only work splendidly, but that maybe could only be pulled off by Sam Raimi. And despite its flaws, Spider-Man 3 is head and shoulders about so many superhero films -- way better than Superman Returns (by Bryan Singer, again tone deaf to story), The Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider (ouch), and Daredevil.  Yet, as I found myself checking my watch as Spider-Man 3 meandered along for well over two hours, I started thinking that the franchise may have lost its juice -- or that we reached that lamentable point where success and self-indulgence collide, and where self-discipline, economy, and the hunger for excellence suffer.I think I'll watch Spider-Man 2 again. That's the last memory I want of our web-slinging, awkward teen who captivated the hearts of awkward teens (like me) for so long. Adieu, Spidey.

649832,AZTDHDUTVOSCC,B00005JPFH,"mallard ""calvin""","[2, 3]","The original Spider-Man was my favorite of the series. From it's classic ""Spider-Man-first-learning-to-use-his-powers"" scenes to the climax on the bridge, I thought it was a truly engaging movie. And the second one for me mostly followed suit.I have to tell you, I had really high expectations for this third one, mostly based on the fact that I really enjoyed the trailer. However, I've come to realize that trailers these days really can make a movie look like a classic even when it isn't.""Spider-Man 3"" was a major let-down for me. For one thing, it was so LONG. And, as I said in my title, the 3 villains clogged the plot to the point where it became a chore to watch. The whole thing for me felt like it was made by a different director, though it wasn't.Besides the basic lower overall quality in the movie, it also was plagued by ridiculous ssequences, such as when the Sandman was escaping the police in the ""marshlands"". While the cops were a mere 10 feet away, they let loose their dogs on him. Sandman proceeded to punch out one of the dogs and hop over a random fence, leaving one the policemen to ridiculously ask, ""Where did he go?"". And to top of the sheer lunacy of the scene, Sandman then, after hopping over the fence, fell into a pit of sand, apparently being used for a scientific experiment. It then cuts to one of the scientists down in a lab saying ""There's something on the monitor."" The other one replies ""It's probably just a bird."" By the way, none of this gets explained later on in the movie.The entire ""Black Spider-Man"" segment was for me, the low-point of the entire movie. Tobey Maguire made a complete fool of himself in this portion of the film. It started off with a completely unnessecary moment when Spider-Man looked at himself in the mirror and played with his hair, making it look more ""emo"". He then looked like a complete idiot while dancing on the sidewalk in his black dress suit, pointing at beautiful women. People at the theater I was at were at were laughing at this point, but I was too busy cringing. And then to finish it off, there was an absolutely painful-to-watch scene in which Spider-Man escorts Gwen Stacey to the jazz club where Mary Jane works to get her jealous. He proceeds to play the jazz piano, dance with Gwen Stacey, and throw off his coat, making Gwen Stacey's hair blow back.The final action sequence was alright, though it still contained some riduculously cheesy moments, such as Spider-Man jumping in front of a billowing American flag, a completely unnessecary moment. Also, there were some absolutely awful TV News reporters, including a questionable British journalist and an old TV news anchor who at one point solemnly reported: ""This could be the end of Spider-Man."" Looking back, I couldn't have agreed more.The entire thing was grade-A cheese. Now why in the world would I give this thing 3 stars? Well, it was entertaining, I will give them that. And for another thing, I obviously felt strong enough about it to actually write a review. And finally, I saw it twice, once with my friends, once with my family.

He's finally dating the woman of his dreams, new Broadway star Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst).  He's doing very well at school.  And his alter ego, Spider-man, is the toast of New York City, much to the dismay of newspaperman J. Jonah Jamison (J. K. Simmons).The only downside to his life is former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).  Harry has recently learned (or decided) that it was Peter who killed Mr. Osborn and has vowed revenge.Soon, that will be the least of Peter's worries.  The man truly responsible for killing his uncle Ben has just escaped from jail.  Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) is on the run when he stumbles into a science experiment and gets molecularly turned into Sandman.  Meanwhile, Peter's plan to propose to Mary Jane falls apart and the two begin to drift.  And a mysterious substance has attached itself to Peter, tapping into his darker side and making him more powerful at the same time.  Will his new power and attitude destroy him?  Can he get revenge on a man who has no shape?Since I'm not a fan of the comic books, I can't comment on how the movie compares to the source material.  I can, however, complain about the change to the Uncle Ben storyline.  Those scenes in the original were what made Spider-man become Spider-man.  Suddenly, this revelation changes everything.  This doesn't sit well with me.  Couple that with the weak climax (I get why they had to do it thematically, but I still didn't like it), and you've got my complaints on the film.The rest of the film was wonderful.  The action scenes were amazing and had me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects made me believe everything I saw.  Yet the movie had plenty of emotional storylines.  They were perfectly balanced with the action and really made things even better.  For comic relief, there are Peter Parker's scenes under the influence of the virus.  And I loved Harry Osborn's arc in the film.  Even with all the different notes, the actors never missed a beat and made everything believable.If they just hadn't changed the details of Uncle Ben's death, I would have loved the film.

649841,A33X3ZY0JFQJ0K,B00005JPFH,Matthew E. Kenary,"[3, 4]","It was a fun movie to watch, plenty of action - a few laughs here and there.  in other words a popcorn movie that probably needs to viewed in the theaters.Having said that ... I do have some suggestions that would have made this movie better.1. the beginning ,where MJ and Parker are so in love and then MJ gets fired and Parker just can't understand her feelings and then Spidey gets the key to the city,  it all needs to be cut out of the film - bad acting and writing.2. Harry vs Peter = LAME-O .... a small little scuffle in the beginning then it just laughable the way their whole relationship  develops throughout the rest of the movie. Though James Franco was a lot less stiff in this one.  I'm not sure how this would've been better approached to make it less silly,  maybe killing off Harry during that first scuffle would have satisfied my bloodlust,  hey Lucas killed off Count Duku off in the beginning of the 3rd Star Wars, maybe it would have worked here too.3. What is with the friggin Mask???? Since the second installment Spider-Man can't seem to keep his mask on.  In 2 it was ridiculous how much he didn't have it on.  In 3, same thing  it was off more than it was on,  i think he carried it in his hands more than actually  wearing...and when he did wear it, it needed to be ripped or torn so parts of Toby Maguire's face always showed,  i forgot what the mask looked like by the end of the movie.4. Less to zero Sandman,  the guy from ""Wings"" didn't do a bad job, it was just more time should have been spent on the Eddie Brock/Venom story.  Venom is a superior character.5. The end battle was a little too silly for me,  but take away Sandman and the Goblin.  A one on one with a Spidey and Venom battle royal would have sufficed.  Too many people were fighting,  I found it suffocating and pretentious.If you enjoyed the other 2 then you'll love this,  probably the best of the lot.

The action sequences were amazing, and the franchise really outdid itself in this respect.  The acting was also very good.  Maybe not quite as good as the second film, but still good.  The villains in this film were cool, but not quite as nasty and intense like Dr. Octopus in #2.  As a big Venom fan, I was disappointed that Venom didn't receive more screen time.  To me, it would have made more sense to focus more on the Venom story rather than Sandman since fans of the franchise love Venom a lot more than Sandman.I think the hype leading up to the showing of this film hurt it in many ways.  The second film's pacing was different in that it started out quickly, then slowed down, then sped up again.  It was kind of like a rollercoaster in terms of what was going on.  In contrast, this film starts out slow, while its audience is ready for some hard core Spidey scenes right away.  SM 3 took a different approach where the pace gradually picked up as the film progressed, which I think hurt the film's reviews.Overall, SM 3 was not quite as good as #2, but it is still a worthy addition to the franchise.  I had a feeling this film would not be able to match the quality of the second film, considering Spider-Man 2 was heralded by many as ""the best superhero movie ever.""Bottom Line: Buy the DVD and watch it again.

MJ's character has only been developed as a pretty affection but lacks substantial integration into the script which Dunst is more than capable of carrying as a pretty decent actress. It's about time to dust off the checkbook and hire decent writers such as Peter David to make sure a smooth transition between plot, sub-plot, and character development.The special effects were over the top and by that I mean the quality level was too low to make it seamless. Excepting Venom, the film fails like those before it to capture how menacing the city is after dark and in so doing it appears as if Spiderman is just doing what the police would ordinarily be doing if it wasn't for the bizarre appearance of super villians.The story will capture your attention though it isn't all that compelling and in closing up loose ends from the first and second film there is a lot of room for future films if producers will allow enough latitude to develop characters while incorporating the numerous other superheroes Spiderman worked with a lot of the time.Though the film caught a whole lot of criticism, it is worth seeing and the DVD is a welcome addition to any collection.",4,Slightly less amazing than 1 and 2.,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1625,"['could', 'be', 'said', 'third', 'installment', 'Spiderman', 'franchise', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'amazing', 'difficulties', 'presented', 'storyline', 'are', 'partly', 'blame.Chemistry', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'continue', 'be', 'mixed', 'bag', 'understand', 'desire', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience', 'continuing', 'introduce', 'tension', 'two', 'begun', 'distract', 'film', 'vectoring', 'mistakes', 'made', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Star', 'Wars', 'MJ', 'character', 'only', 'been', 'developed', 'pretty', 'affection', 'substantial', 'integration', 'script', 'Dunst', 'more', 'capable', 'carrying', 'pretty', 'decent', 'actress', 'time', 'dust', 'off', 'checkbook', 'hire', 'decent', 'writers', 'such', 'Peter', 'David', 'make', 'sure', 'smooth', 'transition', 'plot', 'sub-plot', 'character', 'development.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'top', 'mean', 'quality', 'level', 'was', 'too', 'low', 'make', 'seamless', 'Excepting', 'Venom', 'film', 'fails', 'capture', 'how', 'menacing', 'city', 'dark', 'so', 'doing', 'Spiderman', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'police', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'doing', 'was', ""n't"", 'bizarre', 'appearance', 'super', 'villians.The', 'story', 'will', 'capture', 'attention', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'closing', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'first', 'second', 'film', 'lot', 'room', 'future', 'films', 'producers', 'will', 'allow', 'enough', 'latitude', 'develop', 'characters', 'incorporating', 'numerous', 'other', 'superheroes', 'Spiderman', 'worked', 'lot', 'time.Though', 'film', 'caught', 'whole', 'lot', 'criticism', 'worth', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection']",Spider-Man 3
649846,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JPFH,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 0]","There was just something about the first two Spiderman movies that made them good and watchable. Now I'm not saying this isn't good or unwatchable, but I am saying the director threw way too many ideas at it, and couldn't edit it good enough.My main problem always has been with the Spiderman movies Tobey Maguire. He's got the face of a little boy sometimes, and the hands of an old man. In my mind, he just doesn't fit as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Yes, he's a geek, but at some points, he's too geeky to BE Spiderman. Clark Kent was a hot geek. Tobey Maguire not so much.Spiderman 3 has a lot of special effects, some of the best being the effects creating Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, who is connected to the first movie in some way (whatever could that be?), and throughout the film he is a bad guy. But watch out for the ending he actually turns out good. I wasn't too keen on the bad-guy-with-no-name, who later turns out to be called Venom. It seemed a little too contrived that the black goo just happened to fall on him and create another bad guy. I'm sure this worked out better in the comics but a bit more explanation on screen would be better.However, the movie does have its hilarious moments. The scenes with Bruce Campbell as the Matre d', who fails miserably to do his part in the proposal, with a hilarious moustache. Then there's J.K. Simmons, who plays Peter's boss. He was funny in the first two films, but he comes into his own in this, and practically steals the show in every scene. Especially with the long running joke about his high blood pressure, his temper, and how many tablets he has to take. Definitely a scene I will be re-watching over & over when I get the DVD. ""Not that one!""I honestly did not see the point in Bryce Dallas Howard though. OK, bring a new love interest in, but some dumb blonde against Mary Jane? Not gonna work. Apart from evoking the green eyed monster in Mary Jane, there's not really much point in her being in the film. And she's underused to boot.I was forewarned that I would be cringing at one point during the film, and I thought ""What could possibly make me cringe in a Spiderman movie?"" How wrong was I?! I had my head in my hands, and not only was it a pointless scene, it felt like a very bad parody of Saturday Night Fever. Very bad parody. Accompanied by corny music, Peter Parker thinking he's turned into God's gift to women, complete with groin thrusting, must have been embarrassing for Tobey to film, but I hope it doesn't go to his head. Honestly. It's not an image I will ever get out of my head. I have to admit though, I did think he looked hot with the black suit/black shirt outfit. If his head suddenly disappeared inside the shirt of course.I did think James Franco deserved a bigger role in this film, especially with what happens. The whole goblin grenade to the face was just an insult, and then conveniently getting amnesia. Not good. He is turning into one of my favourite actors, and he is a bit of a good looking guy. But who's gonna be Peter's buddy now? Believe me, if you've got a heart of stone, you will shed a tear.I'm still not sure this was a good sequel to the Spiderman movies, and I have this baaaaddddd feeling they're going to continue the series, but Kirsten and Tobey have all said they really want to move on now. Hey maybe they'd bring in Jake Gyllenhaal instead! That would make it good. But they seemed to focus a lot of Mary Jane's jealousy and the cool special effects.

In the film, Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), is on top of the world...both literally and figuratively. He's happily involved with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and Spider-Man is loved and adored by all of New York City. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Mary Jane is fired from her first Broadway show, and Peter's freelance photography career is threatened when Eddie (Topher Grace), a rival photographer, tries to steal Peter's thunder. Things with Peter's former best friend, Harry (James Franco), aren't going very well, either, and there's also a new villain in town: the mysterious Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who is connected to the death of Peter's uncle. On top of everything else, Peter encounters a strange black organism that transforms into a powerful black Spider-Man suit, which turns out to have devastating consequences.The problem with this movie is that there's way too much going on at once, and all of the subplots and supporting characters are significantly short-changed. There were also many more stupid one-liners and failed comedic moments in ""Spider-Man 3"" than in the first three films, and I was extremely disappointed with the ending, which was unnecessarily depressing.

649851,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JPFH,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 9]","For the third installment of the ""Spider-Man"" film franchise that was released in 2007, director Sam Raimi (who directed the first two ""Spider-Man"" films in 2002 and 2004) also took on the role of screenwriter.  While Raimi is no stranger to taking on both roles, 15 years had elapsed since the last time he both directed and wrote a film, and that was for the 1992 horror/comedy ""Army of Darkness"", which was part of the ongoing ""Evil Dead"" film franchise.  Assisting Raimi in writing the screenplay for ""Spider-Man 3"" was his brother Ivan, who also cowrote ""Army of Darkness"" in 1992, but had not done any writing since his involvement as a writer in the very short-lived (13 episodes) 1997 TV series called ""Spy Game"".  Assisting the brothers in writing ""Spider-Man 3"" screenplay was writer Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 ""Spider-Man 2""; but it was the Raimi brothers who took full credit for writing the ""Spider-Man 3"" screen story.  Thus, unlike the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, ""Spider-Man 3"" was predominantly a Sam & Ivan Raimi effort; and the results were rather disappointing:  whereas the plot & characters of the first two films were interesting & engaging, neither can be said for the characters & plot of the third film.The film begins with Peter Parker, alias Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), planning to propose to his long-time love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) after she is highly criticized for her role in a musical play and is subsequently replaced.  Being totally oblivious to Mary Jane's pain over this for the entire film, Peter is instead preoccupied with his own ego & glory when the city of New York presents him with an award.  In the meantime, an escaped criminal, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), is accidentally transformed into the Sandman while fleeing police; and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is bent on destroying Peter/Spider-Man because of his father.  Later, Peter becomes the host to an alien symbiont creature that brings out the worst in Peter & Spider-Man; but he manages to separate himself from the creature only for it to join with a photography rival, Edward 'Eddie' Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes a new nemesis for Spider-Man named Venom.Thus, Raimi made the third installment of ""Spider-Man"" have three criminals: the Sandman, Harry as the new Goblin, and Venom.  On the surface, this sounds exciting; but in writing an engaging & character-driven plot, this becomes a liability when providing sufficient background & screen time to develop three completely separate characters, each of which must do battle with Spider-Man, as well as provide sufficient screen time to develop the relationship between Peter & Mary Jane.  The result: a plot weakened by too many antagonists, inadequate character development for the antagonists, and the unfortunate transformation of Peter from an engaging protagonist in the first two films to a non-engaging one in the third.  Especially damaging to Peter's character were the jazz club dance scene and his attempt at acting cool on the sidewalk (albeit under the influence of the alien symbiant), that not only turned the heads of bystanders (film extras) on the streets of New York in disgust, but many members of the audience as well.  So, in spite of lavish special effects of Spider-Man swinging his way through New York and doing battle with his three foes, the disjoint relationship between Peter & Mary Jane take away from the excitement of the final climatic battle, as well as the loss of interest already felt by many in the audience by the time the climax occurs.With great special effects & wonderful cinematography, but a poor plot and non-engaging characters, I can only rate ""Spider-Man 3"" with 2 out of 5 stars.  A fourth film has been announced with Stan Lee as executive producer, but no announcements have been made regarding who will direct, write or act in this proposed 2009 release as the contracts that Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst signed were only for three ""Spider-Man"" films.",2,Lots of Eyecandy Cannot Replace a Weak Plot That Has Too Many Antagonists,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,4014,"['third', 'installment', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'franchise', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'who', 'directed', 'first', 'two', 'Spider-Man', 'films', '2002', '2004', 'also', 'took', 'role', 'screenwriter', 'Raimi', 'stranger', 'taking', 'roles', '15', 'years', 'had', 'elapsed', 'last', 'time', 'directed', 'wrote', 'film', 'was', '1992', 'horror/comedy', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'was', 'part', 'ongoing', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'film', 'franchise', 'Assisting', 'Raimi', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'brother', 'Ivan', 'who', 'also', 'cowrote', 'Army', 'Darkness', '1992', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'writing', 'involvement', 'writer', 'very', 'short-lived', '13', 'episodes', '1997', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Spy', 'Game', 'Assisting', 'brothers', 'writing', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'screenplay', 'was', 'writer', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', '2004', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'Raimi', 'brothers', 'who', 'took', 'full', 'credit', 'writing', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'screen', 'story', 'Thus', 'first', 'two', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'predominantly', 'Sam', 'Ivan', 'Raimi', 'effort', 'results', 'were', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'plot', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'characters', 'plot', 'third', 'film.The', 'film', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'alias', 'Spider-Man', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'planning', 'propose', 'long-time', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'highly', 'criticized', 'role', 'musical', 'play', 'subsequently', 'replaced', 'Being', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'pain', 'entire', 'film', 'Peter', 'instead', 'preoccupied', 'own', 'ego', 'glory', 'when', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'award', 'meantime', 'escaped', 'criminal', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'accidentally', 'transformed', 'Sandman', 'fleeing', 'police', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'bent', 'destroying', 'Peter/Spider-Man', 'father', 'Later', 'Peter', 'host', 'alien', 'symbiont', 'creature', 'out', 'worst', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'separate', 'creature', 'only', 'join', 'photography', 'rival', 'Edward', ""'Eddie"", 'Brock', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'who', 'new', 'nemesis', 'Spider-Man', 'named', 'Venom.Thus', 'Raimi', 'made', 'third', 'installment', 'Spider-Man', 'have', 'three', 'criminals', 'Sandman', 'Harry', 'new', 'Goblin', 'Venom', 'surface', 'exciting', 'writing', 'engaging', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'liability', 'when', 'providing', 'sufficient', 'background', 'screen', 'time', 'develop', 'three', 'completely', 'separate', 'characters', 'must', 'do', 'battle', 'Spider-Man', 'as', 'well', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'screen', 'time', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'result', 'plot', 'weakened', 'too', 'many', 'antagonists', 'inadequate', 'character', 'development', 'antagonists', 'unfortunate', 'transformation', 'Peter', 'engaging', 'protagonist', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'non-engaging', 'one', 'third', 'Especially', 'damaging', 'Peter', 'character', 'were', 'jazz', 'club', 'dance', 'scene', 'attempt', 'acting', 'cool', 'sidewalk', 'influence', 'alien', 'symbiant', 'not', 'only', 'turned', 'heads', 'bystanders', 'film', 'extras', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'disgust', 'many', 'members', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'spite', 'lavish', 'special', 'effects', 'Spider-Man', 'swinging', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'doing', 'battle', 'three', 'foes', 'disjoint', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'take', 'away', 'excitement', 'final', 'climatic', 'battle', 'as', 'well', 'loss', 'interest', 'already', 'felt', 'many', 'audience', 'time', 'climax', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'poor', 'plot', 'non-engaging', 'characters', 'can', 'only', 'rate', 'Spider-Man', '3', '2', '5', 'stars', 'fourth', 'film', 'been', 'announced', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'executive', 'producer', 'announcements', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'regarding', 'who', 'will', 'direct', 'write', 'act', 'proposed', '2009', 'release', 'contracts', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'signed', 'were', 'only', 'three', 'Spider-Man', 'films']",Spider-Man 3

I was greatly disappointed.  There was just too much going on in this film.  Where Doc Ock and the Green Goblin were fascinating villains with powerful performances in the other films, the Sandman was a very dry character and Venom was comical like Danny Devito's Penguin in the Batman movie.  Additionally, Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane was all over the place and never properly resolved in the end.The best part of the movie is the first battle between Spidey and Harry in his Goblin gear (though it is never explained how he mastered all the equipment and had a much bigger arsenal and better glider than his father).

Jonah Jameson's character is reduced to a much smaller role than the other movies and I was expecting more from Doctor Connors and the University in this film.

What, so if we don't live in New York, we don't have any prayer of knowing what hot women really are? Wow, guess our lives suck! Why are the female scientists conducting the experiment Sandman-to-be ""stumbles"" upon so hot? Give us a break already, you are trying way too hard Sam and it just makes you looks idiotic! Anyway, the film is way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes for the ADD-laden and exhausted from being overworked and having too many children American audiences of nowadays, so they should have trimmed it by, oh, 45 minutes and saved themselves $100 million in budget anyway. The action sequences are way, way over the top and blindingly fast at times, thank the maker they just don't have the annoying ""oontz-oontz-oontz"" techno music of The Matrix films. Three villains in one film? Three words, Sam; BATMAN & ROBIN.Sam just loves showing how ""diverse"" New York really is, I think these films have more Asians in them than any film made in an Asian country! Oh Sam, you're so cute for a Democrat! Please go sing in a Southern Baptist church with a faux accent like Hillary! Why did you make Peter emo, Sam, when he turned ""dark""? Would you have done the same two years from now when emo inevitably crashes and burns like all other great American trends and nobody admits to adhering to it anymore? I doubt it! Boy, Harry Osborne sure can take a lot of beatings over and over again and not end up dead for a guy with no powers, just fancy equipment! Villains should be evil, Sam. Not guilt-ridden (you are a Democrat, aren't you!), not having any hidden agendas, not just ""needing a chance"". Make them detestable and ruthless instead of neo-hippies with muscles.Speaking of, Topher Grace was a horrible choice. Sure, he's recognizable and I suppose attractive to females, but he's skinny. And too boyish. You needed someone with a bodybuilder physique and a bit more dynamic. You might have to look beyond Hollywood for this, but it's not impossible. They got more than enough massive Caucasian dudes to star in 300, for crying out loud! It's entertaining. It's long, has some absolutely deplorable dialogue (gee, here's Aunt May in another scene, what liberal parables will she dish out this time?), and is WAAAAAAAY too MTV-poppy like its predecessors, but hey, it's another film with a classic superhero. It's not Superman Reuturns bad, and it's not Batman Begins great. I'll put it smack-dab in the middle. 3 out 5.

649857,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JPFH,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","I still nurse a grudge against Joel Silverman for mucking up the Batman series by stuffing it with way too many villains in the belief that it somehow bolsters the franchise.  And yet I understand: each supervillain means another toy, another lunchbox, another backpack that gets created.  They are literally worth millions, and to justify the budgets of superhero movies, action figures and other returns add up.But that's a cynical way of looking at it.  What happened to just focusing on making a good movie?Spider-Man 3, as you guessed, fell victim to the same problem.  And that's a shame.  At one point my wife turned to me and said, ""you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be.""  I agreed with her.  It was the scene when Peter was talking to Aunt May about proposing to Mary Jane.Fifteen minutes later, she changed her mind.Raimi does an excellent job of taking the superhero foibles and following them to their logical conclusion.  In a lot of ways, it's not unlike being a famous actor.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) learns that just because he's Spider-Man doesn't mean he can kiss girls in public while hanging upside from a web, ESPECIALLY if she's a hottie (the delectable Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy).  When things are looking great for Parker, Mary Jane Watson's (Kirsten Dunst, seeming a bit deflated in this film) career is tanking.  Sounds familiar, like something you'd read in a tabloid...Raimi and his cast handle all of these issues with grace.  And I don't mean Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock and later Venom.  There are no less than three villains in this film, one being Sandman (Thomas Haden Church playing Flint Marko, and he nails the look), the other being Venom the alien parasite. And we can't forget Harry Osborn (James Franco) as the new Goblin.  At various points in the film, it feels like bad guys just get thrown at Parker while he's driving down the street.Mind you, the special effects are amazing.  This is the first true, knockdown, drag out superhero battle that pulls no punches.  Between Goblin's aerial antics, Sandman's shapeshifting, and the amazing acrobatics of Spider-Man, this movie is so action packed with amazing feats of strength and agility that it's hard to look away.There's a convoluted connection to Marko that at least explains why he's in the film.  But Venom is another story.  He literally drops out of the sky, sneaks into Parker's room, and then takes him over.  The concept of Venom is already ludicrous to begin with: an alien parasite that bonds with people but mimics Spider-Man's powers during the Secret Wars on Battleworld, placed there by a being known as the Beyonder.  Hey, it was the 80s, give Marvel a break.A lot of the back-story is jettisoned in exchange for...no back-story at all.  The parasite just shows up in an asteroid.  It bonds with Spider-Man's suit.  It turns him evil.  For no reason.Other stuff like this happens.  At one point, Osborn threatens Mary Jane, forcing her to break it off with Peter or he'll kill him.  And she does.  When Spider-Man defeats Goblin (and, near as I can tell, killed him), nothing further is mentioned.  Doesn't Mary Jane want to explain what she did and why?  How come the police weren't called, when the first near-death experience with Goblin ends up (realistically) in an emergency room? Don't even get me started on the amnesia that strikes Osborn at a convenient moment...And so it goes.  Sandman is practically invincible, so fights with him are pointless.  We get an interesting back-story about his drive to save his daughter from illness, but then the film does nothing with it.  And since Sandman can fly (news to me), he's like a ghost.  You can't beat him.  Which makes one wonder...why fight Spider-Man at all?  And certainly, why would a powerful immortal-level being like Sandman team up with Venom, a crazy alien nutjob?We don't get our answers.  Spider-Man has an overarching theme of forgiveness, but I found it difficult to forgive the obvious cramming of too many ideas.  I suspect this is the installment where principal actors bow out.

649864,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JPFH,Mike Zimmerman,"[18, 22]","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found a balance between his life as Spider-Man and another with his long-time girlfriend M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst). However, his former long-time friend Harry Osbourne (James Franco), is still upset after finding out that Peter killed his father (Willem Dafoe), and donning his father's Goblin outfits, he plans to do anything possible to see him reduced to patheticness. Of course, Peter recently found out the real man behind his Uncle Ben's (Cliff Robertson) death: ex-con Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who was recently involved in an experiment gone wrong, and has become the Sandman. And a symbiote from space has infected Peter, turning him into an arrogant, overly confident punk who gets frisky with the New York captain's (James Cromwell) daughter Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and embarasses co-worker Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) to the point of revenge. Eventually, a bit from the symbiote has also turned Eddie into the monstrous Venom. So Peter must make up with M.J., quench Harry's thirst for revenge, stop the symbiote from taking over, and discover why Marko killed Ben.Right up there with Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"", the ""Spider-Man"" movies have been the epitome of superhero movies since it started. Throwing in high-quality acting talent, a twisted sense of humor (from the likes of J.K. Simmons as arrogant Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell playing different roles), affecting drama, slick special effects, and slam-bang action, director Sam Raimi has created a treat for the eyes and the heart that would lead up to ""Spider-Man 3"". In work since ""Spider-Man 2"", this is Raimi's most ambitious, expensive (the budget comes in at a whopping $250 million) project. And the wait was worth it.It's also long. Clocking in at two hours AND thirty minutes, ""SM3"" is loaded with everything. Raimi includes another batch of villains to the process, which include New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom, with aliases of misunderstood chums (Harry Osbourne is filled with passion to kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man, whom he believes to be his father's killer; Flint Marko is an ex-con who does whatever it takes to help his ailing daughter, even though his wife totally despises him; Eddie Brock is upset at Peter Parker for exposing him of a fraud, and a symbiote from Peter's suit turns him into the maniacal Venom). Raimi doesn't mind letting the viewer care for them, even though they're doing awful things (the Marko subplot is the most effective).Of course, he throws in a bunch of useless subplots. The revealing of Marko as the man who killed Uncle Ben, while weaving into the story, doesn't seem satisfactory. The Gwen Stacy subplot seems like an attempt of soap opera ridiculousness, something that the series knew well of steering clear from. And Mary Jane Watson still has no luck keeping a job (this whole subplot is getting old fast, even though Dunst manages to leave with a shred of dignity thanks to some effective line-readings). It seems like Raimi was afraid that his iconic franchise might come to an end (which it fitfully does), considering rumors going about, that he decided to throw everything but the kitch sink. Sharp line readings and good story-telling aside, maybe they should've saved some of that stuff for the recent video game adaptation.As usual, star Tobey Maguire is sharp and intense as he's ever been. With Peter Parker faced with alot of drama in his life - losing M.J., turning into an egomaniac that would put Tom Cruise to shame, and fighting off his enemies - the actor helps all of Parker's actions ring true. While he does overplay his hand with a dose of weepy scenes, that doesn't mean he continues sharing great chemistry with co-star Dunst (who still works her magic, but that ain't no surpris).The rest of the cast fares well. James Franco, coming off a series of bombs (""Annapolis"", ""Flyboys"", and ""Tristan & Isolde""), reclaims his powerful, brooding performance as Harry. Topher Grace, J.K. Simmons, and Bruce Campbell (now playing a French waiter) provide plenty of comic relief in their roles. Thomas Haden Church, known for playing the cocky friend of Paul Giamatti's character in ""Sideways"", is affecting in his role as an ex-con who may or may not have purposely killed Uncle Ben. Other memorable performances also come from smaller roles played by Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brandt) and Bill Nunn (Robbie) among others.I'll go out on a limb here and say that ""SM3"" is a delgiht. The film ends on a note that the trilogy has come full circle, which probably explains why so many characters and subplots have been added. If so, hat's off to Raimi for making one of the best comic book movies of all time.",5,"""This could be the end of Spider-Man""",1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,4723,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey',

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is basking is Spiderman's glory and plans to propose marriage to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who continues to struggle with her stage career. Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church), a small-time crook believed to have murdered Parker's dear Uncle Ben, has been transformed into the Sandman by an opportune accident with a particle accelerator. Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father by becoming the Green Goblin reincarnate. A self-absorbed upstart named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. If that weren't enough trouble, an insidious symbiotic organism is bringing out the worst in Spider-Man.That's only half of it. This plot is crowded. Ultimately, ""Spider-Man 3"" continues to explore Peter Parker's struggle with his own psyche in the form of conflicting emotions and desires. But this isn't as effective as the previous two films. The overloaded narrative seems scattershot. I don't think Tobey Maguire's performance is as strong as it has been in the past, but Topher Grace contributes a nice edge as the amoral narcissist Brock, who later becomes Venom, a villain who shares many powers with Spider-Man. My reaction to Sandman is lukewarm, but I love what they did with Venom. It's disappointing that this third installment isn't as visually smart as its predecessors. Dramatic, thoughtful composition is what placed the Spider-Man films a cut above most superhero movies. Still entertaining, but most of ""Spider-Man 3"" is nothing special.The DVD (Columbia 2007 single disc): Bonus features include Bloopers (6 min), a music video for ""Signal Fire"" (4 min), Galleries of Sketches, Paintings, Special Effects, Director & Cast, video game and toy previews (2 min), and 2 audio commentaries.

This is conversational but informative, a mix of the actor's experiences and observations with discussion of the collaborative aspect of the film, characters, visual effects, and more. The 2nd audio commentary is with producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, Grant Curtis, visual effects supervisor Scott Stokdyk, and editor Bob Murawski.

649866,A1KAR9G699RM56,B00005JPFH,M. Miller,"[3, 4]","As the story progresses from Spiderman 2, we see a sprite Peter Parker prepared to propose, and a glum Mary Jane, struggling as an actress unbeknown to Peter.  Then we see Peter's and MJ's friend, Harry, once again try to assault Peter, only to lose his memory in the process, and make a return to old times.  Additionally, Peter's schoolwork is excellent, but he's got competition at the office from a young hotshot Eddie Brock Jr., whose all to eager to get a scoop.  Then, we have Thomas Haden Church's character or Flint Marko in the story, running from jail, while still trying to get money for his daughter's medical needs, only to find himself turned into the Sandman early on in the film.  Peter finds out from the police that actually Marko was the one to kill Ben, and soon enough, all of these stories intertwine.I introduce the film this way one, to be free of spoilers, and two, because in reality the greatest downfall of the film is the entanglement of all the stories together, into what appears to be a relatively coordinated mess.  Mind you I do still like the film, but in this one, I wanted to get my complaint out there early.Now for my praise, as I felt that even with all of the crossing of story-lines, I did feel a sympathetic ear for the characters, as was intended.  Especially since, more then ever with the introduction of the symbiote, Peter Parker/(the Black Spider) takes a dark turn, and starts ruining his life, among others.  Thus, we were allowed to learn about all the characters, even if there were so many different characters.Which actually brings me to another complaint, and that's the unnecessary emphasis of Peter Parker's cockiness.  For instance, there's at least a five-minute scene where Peter's just strutting on the street, and sure we get he's changed, but this is quite worthless a scene.All in all, while the movie ran a little long, and definitely earned some of its negativity, I personally enjoyed the film, and that's all I can say when the lights go up.",4,Webs of wonder...,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,2011,"['story', 'Spiderman', '2', 'see', 'sprite', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'prepared', 'propose', 'glum', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'struggling', 'actress', 'unbeknown', 'Peter', 'Then', 'see', 'Peter', 'MJ', 'friend', 'Harry', 'once', 'again', 'try', 'assault', 'Peter', 'only', 'lose', 'memory', 'process', 'make', 'return', 'old', 'times', 'Additionally', 'Peter', 'schoolwork', 'excellent', 'got', 'competition', 'office', 'young', 'hotshot', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Jr.', 'eager', 'get', 'scoop', 'Then', 'have', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'character', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'story', 'running', 'jail', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'daughter', 'medical', 'needs', 'only', 'find', 'turned', 'Sandman', 'early', 'film', 'Peter', 'out', 'police', 'actually', 'Marko', 'was', 'one', 'kill', 'Ben', 'soon', 'enough', 'stories', 'intertwine.I', 'introduce', 'film', 'way', 'one', 'be', 'free', 'spoilers', 'two', 'reality', 'greatest', 'downfall', 'film', 'entanglement', 'stories', 'together', 'what', 'be', 'relatively', 'coordinated', 'mess', 'do', 'still', 'film', 'one', 'wanted', 'get', 'complaint', 'there', 'early.Now', 'praise', 'felt', 'even', 'crossing', 'story-lines', 'did', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'characters', 'was', 'intended', 'Especially', 'more', 'then', 'ever', 'introduction', 'symbiote', 'Peter', 'Parker/', 'Black', 'Spider', 'dark', 'turn', 'ruining', 'life', 'others', 'Thus', 'were', 'allowed', 'learn', 'characters', 'even', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters.Which', 'actually', 'complaint', 'unnecessary', 'emphasis', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'cockiness', 'instance', 'least', 'five-minute', 'scene', 'where', 'Peter', 'just', 'strutting', 'street', 'sure', 'get', 'changed', 'quite', 'worthless', 'scene.All', 'movie', 'ran', 'little', 'long', 'definitely', 'earned', 'negativity', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'lights', 'go', 'up']",Spider-Man 3

649870,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B00005JPFH,Mr. J. Murdock,"[0, 0]","I watched Spider-Man 3 a few days ago on FX and, from the looks of it, it was the weakest of the Spider-Man films. There were too many characters in Spider-Man 3 and not enough of a background for many of them. For instance, there isn't really any reason for Gwen Stacey to be in this movie. She didn't really add anything to the plot. Harry Osborn's character The New Goblin wasn't really fleshed out in this story. The Venom character is supposed to show Peter Parker's dark side but, instead, Peter Parker was strutting his stuff and dancing on the streets of New York. Eddie Brock was there as Peter Parker's rival at The Daily Bugle but, again, there wasn't much of a background about him. He was crammed into the film as Spidey's newest arch-villain of the month.There were some positive points as I did like the way Sam Raimi made The Sandman into a sympathetic character, though. He was the villain but they didn't demonize him as a vicious psychopath. You get the feeling that Flint Marko doesn't want to get into a life of crime but is forced to do so to take care of his daughter. Other positive notes is there were great special effects in this movie. The fight scenes were stunning. And Stan Lee made a memorable cameo appearance.Clearly, it's the weakest of the Spider-Man series but it's still contains some entertaining elements for fans of the super-hero genre.

649871,A1NMUSODK9RHAT,B00005JPFH,Mr. Maybe,"[1, 2]","As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, I enjoyed this film. As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watching from the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's second from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography.

He learns that Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is the man actually responsible for his Uncle Ben's Death, and Marko has just been mutated into the Uber-criminal, The Sandman; Peter's best buddy Harry Osborn (James Franco) dons the mantle of the New Goblin and seeks revenge on Spider-Man, whom he erroneously belives killed his father; M.J.'s performance in her musical generates a series of terrible reviews and leads to her being replaced by and understudy, and consequently, M.J. begins to resent how smoothly life is going for her spuerheroic boyfriend; and a mysterious meteorite crashes into central park, releasing a symbioitic alien creature that bonds itself to Spider-Man and begins to control him, turning him into the very fugitive Peter's vituperative employer J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) has always insisted he is.SPIDER-MAN 3, like it's two predecessors, effectively blends seamless visual effects (The Sandman is especially impressive), thrilling superhero action, and a genuinely involving and thouroughly unpredictable storyline (the event that motivates Peter to get rid of the symbiote truly comes out of left field.)And of course, the inclusion of the legendary Venom (Topher Grace) as a villian is something that SPIDER-MAN fans, including me, have been waiting for with baited breath. And by the time the climactic showdown with Venom and the Sandman arrives (during which Spider-Man acquires a most unexpected ally), it clear that Stan Lee's creation will not be leaving the silver screen in the near future.LONG LIVE SPIDER-MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,The greatest battle lies within,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,2349,"['SPIDER-MAN', 'movie', 'series', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'Spidey', 'third', 'celluloid', 'adventure', 'once', 'again', 'third', 'always', 'charm', 'superhero', 'epics.Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'never', 'been', 'happier', 'got', 'best', 'grades', 'class', 'Columbia', 'University', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'gotten', 'lead', 'boradway', 'musical', 'life', 'masked', 'web-slinger', 'Spider-Man', 'no', 'longer', 'time-consuming', 'chore', 'was', 'intially', 'Spidey', 'acuired', 'ham', 'radio', 'listen', 'police', 'transmissions', 'can', 'determine', 'crime', 'question', 'looks', 'job', 'Spider-Man', 'something', 'cops', 'can', 'handle', 'Spidey', 'greatest', 'challange', 'slam', 'head', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'man', 'actually', 'responsible', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Death', 'Marko', 'just', 'been', 'mutated', 'Uber-criminal', 'Sandman', 'Peter', 'best', 'buddy', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'mantle', 'New', 'Goblin', 'revenge', 'Spider-Man', 'whom', 'erroneously', 'killed', 'father', 'M.J.', 'performance', 'musical', 'generates', 'series', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'being', 'replaced', 'understudy', 'consequently', 'M.J.', 'resent', 'how', 'smoothly', 'life', 'going', 'spuerheroic', 'boyfriend', 'mysterious', 'meteorite', 'crashes', 'central', 'park', 'releasing', 'symbioitic', 'alien', 'creature', 'bonds', 'Spider-Man', 'control', 'turning', 'very', 'fugitive', 'Peter', 'vituperative', 'employer', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'always', 'insisted', 'is.SPIDER-MAN', '3', 'two', 'predecessors', 'effectively', 'seamless', 'visual', 'effects', 'Sandman', 'especially', 'impressive', 'thrilling', 'superhero', 'action', 'genuinely', 'involving', 'thouroughly', 'unpredictable', 'storyline', 'event', 'Peter', 'get', 'rid', 'symbiote', 'truly', 'left', 'field', 'course', 'inclusion', 'legendary', 'Venom', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'villian', 'something', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'fans', 'including', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'baited', 'breath', 'time', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'Spider-Man', 'most', 'unexpected', 'ally', 'clear', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'creation', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'leaving', 'silver', 'screen', 'near', 'future.LONG', 'LIVE', 'SPIDER-MAN']",Spider-Man 3

That being said, what we have here is a pretty solid superhero story that does as much right as it does wrong, and could have been so much better than what it is.  As the story picks up, Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are together and happy, which soon gets spoiled upon the arrival of new villain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is the real man responsible for Uncle Ben's death.  Not to mention the fact that a gooey, alien symbiote has latched itself onto Peter, and has allowed for all his inhibitions to get left at the door as he embraces his dark side.  The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that there are too many characters in the story.  Sure, it's nice to see Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the movie, but she's here for little reason really.  What is also disappointing is having Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) here as well.  Arguably the most hyped about aspect of the film upon it's release, Brock's character development is non-sensical, and while his transformation into Venom and usage in the climactic final battle are plenty good, he's just not here enough.  James Franco's turn as Harry/New Goblin is also quite underdeveloped, although when he's bad, he's good.  Despite the negatives, there is a lot to admire here, mainly Maguire's gleeful turn as the ""bad"" Peter Parker (with an emo haircut), and he is clearly having a blast doing it.  Stan Lee's cameo is the best the legendary creator has had in a Marvel movie yet, and Bruce Campbell once again pops up in a cameo, and provides some nice laughs.  The CGI effects are wonderful, and director Sam Raimi knows what he's doing, but it just feels like he wanted to do too much with too little time.  All in all, Spider-Man 3 isn't bad one bit, and you can certainly do much worse when it comes to mega budget superhero movies, but at the end of the day, the film proves sadly disappointing.",3,Disappointing,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,2022,"['secret', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'disappointing', 'entry', 'feature', 'film', 'franchise', 'Marvel', 'web-crawling', 'superstar', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'pretty', 'solid', 'superhero', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'right', 'wrong', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'story', 'up', 'Peter', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'are', 'together', 'happy', 'soon', 'spoiled', 'arrival', 'new', 'villain', 'Sandman', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'real', 'man', 'responsible', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'death', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'gooey', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'latched', 'Peter', 'allowed', 'inhibitions', 'get', 'left', 'door', 'dark', 'side', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'story', 'Sure', 'nice', 'see', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'movie', 'here', 'little', 'reason', 'really', 'What', 'also', 'disappointing', 'having', 'Eddie', 'Brock/Venom', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Arguably', 'most', 'hyped', 'aspect', 'film', 'release', 'Brock', 'character', 'development', 'non-sensical', 'transformation', 'Venom', 'usage', 'climactic', 'final', 'battle', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'here', 'enough', 'James', 'Franco', 'turn', 'Harry/New', 'Goblin', 'also', 'quite', 'underdeveloped', 'when', 'bad', 'good', 'negatives', 'lot', 'admire', 'here', 'mainly', 'Maguire', 'gleeful', 'turn', 'bad', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'emo', 'haircut', 'clearly', 'having', 'blast', 'doing', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'best', 'legendary', 'creator', 'had', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'yet', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'once', 'again', 'pops', 'up', 'cameo', 'nice', 'laughs', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderful', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'what', 'doing', 'just', 'feels', 'wanted', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'Spider-Man', '3', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'bit', 'can', 'certainly', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'when', 'mega', 'budget', 'superhero', 'movies', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'sadly', 'disappointing']",Spider-Man 3
649877,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B00005JPFH,Negative Comments,"[10, 13]","I loved the first two, I gave them both 5 stars. It's amazing how much of a joke this is compared to the first two. Although this one isn't completely terrible, the quality level is nowhere near the others, this one just feels so sloppy. There's three main reasons why this movie was a joke compared to the first two:REASON 1: It lacks all of the humanity that made the first two so great. The first two movies had great characters that were well written, and had motivations for everything they did. Nothing that the Green Goblin or Doc Ock did felt arbitrary. Their very existence was written in a very believable way, and all their actions and crimes had purpose to them to achieve some end goal. Tell me again, WHAT exactly was Sandman up to again the whole time?REASON 2: Humor was too over the top. This series has always been known for its tongue in cheek type campy humor, and it worked great in the first two. Here it felt so forced, there were so many cringe inducing scenes. From the overplayed gimmick of that desk buzzer ringing loudly at J. Jonah Jameson's desk (it's funnier if you do it just a couple times... not ONE HUNDRED times), to the absolutely horrific child actors and the terrible lines they were made to speak, everything was so over the top. During the climax of the movie, they completely slowed the movie down by putting in what felt like a 5 minute scene of Jameson asking that little girl for her camera, as she replied with all the acting talent of 2007's Bionic Woman. It's crazy that someone consciously put that unnatural scene in there. The whole thing is just so wrong.REASON 3: Too many subplots. I guess this pretty much ties in to Reason 1, the very reason why every character was shallow and paper thin was because this movie had one too many villains. Neither of the villains got enough time to be developed, and every time they show up it all feels so disjointed. They should've taken out one of the villains, and went much much deeper into one of the subplots, such as Peter's inner struggle. It would've been very interesting to see a truly dark, evil Spider-Man, and not an eyeliner wearing dancing buffoon.Scenes that were poorly written:--When Peter was looking at the ring in his hand, and Mary Jane unexpectedly knocks, why was he fumbling around as to where to hide the ring, only to eventually put it in his pocket? Wouldn't his pocket be the FIRST choice?--The scene where Gwen Stacy perilously hangs off the building, as her boyfriend and father look on calmly and talk to each other. I'm at a total loss of words here.--The butler dude that out of nowhere, all of a sudden deciding to tell Harry that his father's wounds came from his glider, so THEREFORE the wounds were self-inflicted. Was the script writer on CRACK here??--You could really tell the writers had no idea how to justify the meeting of Venom and Sandman with the way they had them just conveniently meet by chance, and say, ""we both hate him, wanna team up real quick?"" That should be a felony to write something like that.--I think this is more of an opinion based on my own understanding of the world, but I'm completely confused about how Peter could kiss Gwen Stacy in front of his girlfriend and not realize it's a big deal?--The ending of Sandman's story arc. He might as well have just stayed home if he's just gonna pathetically wisk away like that in the end with nothing resolved. What was that?This could've been a great movie had they tightened up the script, trimmed off the fat, left off one of the villains, and focused on the core of the story.

649878,A1U4VN19O89I3U,B00005JPFH,"Nick S ""Film, Book and Music Freak""","[0, 0]","Many would believe that it would either be a trivialization or too obvious to compare the series' of ""Spider Man"" and ""The Evil Dead"" together. The two series, both directed by Sam Raimi, do share some of the characteristics in style and design, while other points are a flip 180 degrees from Raimi's days as a blood-and-guts Grindhouse film maverick. This comparison is needed to understand, if not accept, what Raimi may have intended with this third Spidey entry, a film that is buoyed only by the character interaction of its central characters, all of which, have appeared in the last entries. The problem is, ""Spiderman 3"" does not seem to have anything more to say, and sadly backtracks its seriousness to corny, schlock humor and comic-book gimmicks that do not work on the big screen. This characterization dumb-down seems much more akin to the third Evil Dead movie, Army of Darkness-- yet, it is sadly more insulting than Evil Dead's descent into Three Stooges humor, as the first Spider Man film set up the series so it could emotionally develop and mature, unlike the intentional B-movie element of those splatter films.Perhaps the blockbuster success of the first two ""Spider Man"" films went to the filmmaker's head, like Tobey Maguire as the characters of Spiderman and Peter Parker in this film. As in Spiderman 3, Peter Parker's alternate ego of Spiderman is still shrouded in mystery from everyone but his best friend and girlfriend, but Spider Man is a hero to the people of the New York City. Then, one day, Peter wakes up in a black suit that makes him stronger, but it also makes him slowly succumb to his flaws, whether it be his tragic past, or his dark side. Parker's girlfriend, Mary Jane ( Kristin Dunst) gets very upset with him, as he seems to put his alternate identity above her. When Peter gets more aggressive and cocky, both in and out of his suit, he begins to lose the grasp on who he really is, while he still must save the city from a villain known as The Sandman, and another entity who posses many of Spiderman's own powers.See, back in the 1980's Raimi was a prodigy to horror film fans. Much like punk rock and its do-it-yourself ethos, Raimi and his friends made some of the funnest underground work of the era, and ushered in a wave of similar artists that wanted to follow suit. Flash forward to the Spiderman series and you have a similar craze of films that match the comic book craze, but unlike Evil Dead, this time they have a much bigger budget due to studio backing, and its cult is bigger due to using the actual Spider Man name, a staple of many comic-book reading youth for generations.  This might be the problem with Spider Man 3-- despite ever-growing gallant spectacle, it's the only film in this series that seems its solely for the comic book fans, because its generic, lacking depth, and feels too much like the bad clich&eacute; of comic books in which they are thought to be only one-dimensional and emotionally shoddy.As ""Spiderman 3"" is a film that mostly only works as a summer blockbuster, and any other way is only because the earlier movies were quite good, and set up the reoccurring characters that have carried over into this film.  There is no new dimension added to this film, even for the new characters that sadly are only ciphers.  Raimi may try to add ""some"" depth to the Sandman, and the one emotional scene involving him and his daughter does work well, yet it only leaves the viewer wanting more. While Topher Grace's antagonistic character has a pretty bland personality and no real depth, and the cheesy jokes in the entire movie are rather irritating and dumbs the material down--as, do we really need the cheesy dancing and fight scene in a nightclub, or a quick shot of Parker dancing on the street after getting a new style of clothes--real laughs, however, come from the irresistible cameo of ""Evil Dead's,"" Bruce Campbell, as a hilarious ill-timed garcon.One of the final blasphemies in the film is the way that the best parts of the Spider Man series was not the fights, but the emotion at its core involving its coming-of-age characters. With much dismay, in ""Spider Man 3,"" the tensions are more akin to soap-opera melodrama-- with themes that may match its good-vs.-evil struggle in the soul of mankind, but do not get into a proper examination, and does not let the characters properly develop. Instead the film makes half-baked statements that seem like a slogan for an after school special than a theme.Though I doubt this will be the last of the series, as ""Spider Man 3"" does not feel like a good caper to two surprisingly solid  comic book adaptations and certainly missed out on the possibility of expanding on past entries. It did, however, seem to run on the fumes of those two films, making it more of a time killer, as it will probably never prove to be a grower.*** (Out of 5)",3,3rd Spider Man Follows Path of Evil Dead

One scene Peter is begging for MJ to call him and literally 2 minutes later MJ is asking why he isn't returning HER calls.

649883,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B00005JPFH,One More Option,"[0, 2]","The film has been criticized for being too interested in saving the characters' souls - essentially the criticism is that the film is too religious.  I don't mind the strong moral themes because I've always been drawn to mythological and super hero stories because they aspire to touch on great moral and ""religious"" questions.  So I don't fault the movie for trying to bite off more than it could chew.  However, unfortunately this movie is not as easy to swallow as the previous two.Church's appearance and physical presence are great for Sandman, but the lines of dialogue he is given are a little bit too much one note over and over again.  Topher plays Venom very well, with great charm and panache.  Jameson and his staff's reparte are excellent as always.  Campbell's comic relief scene as a French waiter is pitch perfect again.  Stan Lee's cameo is always appreciated.  Franco's acting is always a little cagey, but he's asked to play improbable emotional arcs, so like Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars' prequels, you kind of have to tip your hat to both actors for trying to make something out of the sometimes humorously overwrought and implausible roles they have been given.Maquire and Dunst have proven to be perfect casting and are strong as always.  But Mary Jane's role is written a little too ""Damsel in distress"" and too imperceptive for modern sensibilities.The action scenes suffer from a sense of ""Matrix"" 2 & 3 style overload in that they are very well done, but not novel (but at least they are not all in monochromatic Matrix green tones).  The person I saw it with said, ""How many times can someone land on a their back on a steel beam?""  My other criticism of the action scenes is that they are done in low light and at night too often.  And even though there is a lot of fast action, it's almost too fast to fully appreciate the fighting decision making (kind of like watching a martial arts film that just keeps fighting & fighting superfast with little ingenuity, or like the lightsaber fights in Star Wars Episode III).  However, the crane action scene was novel and spectacular.Before the movie came out, fans were already criticizing trying to fit 3 villains into one movie, and the movie does run long.  The editors should have cut the Jameson ""Little girl, can I buy your camera scene?"" because it deflated the tension build up and wasn't that funny - if they were really trying to build up to an emotional release (a little too much like the many Tim Burton mistakes with the Batman franchise).  Editorially, we could have done without the news anchor and reporter lady 'commenting on the obvious' during the final battle scene.  Scriptwriting - we could have found a better pretext for the Venom power transfering from Peter Parker to Eddie Brock, instead of ""Oh wow, what a coincidence you were here when I was there.""  In a city of 10 million people, what were the odds?A primary theme of this movie was a redo of the excellently executed theme in Spiderman 2.  But we've already been convinced that one man can make a difference and that everybody always has a choice whether to fight for good or to not fight.  So thematically, it was too much of a redo, with added, heavy handed emphasis on forgiveness (which wraps up the story a little too sugary for modern viewers).  Like most American movies, the heroes overcome their enemies in this film by killing them.  For the movie to have packed more of a relevant punch, more of the villains should have survived, continuing their never ending menace.The movie and Raimi must be commended for doing the following very well: The movie reminds us there would be no Spiderman if there had been no Aunt May.  She is Peter Parker's moral compass.  She is a beautiful, archetypal model of a feminine conscience in a masculine hero (a theme also emphasized well in movies like The Bourne Supremacy).

There are three dance sequences (mary jane making eggs, peter walking streets, and jazz club) there are also two musical numbers (both mary jane). This is just silly and not needed.  The jazz club scene with Peter dancing and playing piano is so close as a nod to Anchorman its awe inspiring, in a bad way.  ""Dark Spiderman"" is a waste as well.  The only change is color, emo hairstyle, and pushing a cute russian girl to make him cookies....OOHHH!! During his ONE fight sequence as ""dark"" there is no change in spideys abilities or approach.  He might be slightly more aggressive, but thats it.  He states that the ""power"" of the suit feels great, but what diffrence did it make.  Spidey doesnt do ANYTHING out of the ordinary than what he did in the first two films strength and ability wise.  Sandman has the best scene of the film when the ""birth"" of sandman is displayed.  Outside of that, who cares? He may have a dozen lines througout the whole film.  Raimi said publicly he doesnt like Venom, and it shows.  The character is boring and undeveloped.  And the most ridiculous aspect is the ever growing demasking of everyone who has a ""secret"" identity.  In the final fight I couldnt count the amount of times everyone is revealed to the huge number of reporters and cameras below at street level.  And yes, they can see their faces despite the height.  They show a camera  zooming in within a foot of MJs face in the beginning of the scene.  How is it that the enitre world doesnt know who everyone really is??

649887,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B00005JPFH,P. Hardy,"[1, 2]","For the most part, I went into the movies unaffected by the hype (though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely annoyed with the endless chatter on Television about the BOX-OFFICE RECORDS the film was breaking before it was released in the US and even now. I especially disliked it when they kept showing scenes from the film not included the Teaser/Theatrical Trailers showcased wherever available. It really spoiled things for me.) and no expectations beyond a good Spider-Man Movie. It had everything I expected and more, though at first it felt as though the first several minutes of the film were moving far too fast for me, then quickly resumed a steady pace as the movie progressed. (I liked that they gave Peter's Neighbors, Ursula, and her father, more screen time. Heck, there was even a longer cameo scene for Stan Lee.) The action scenes were top notch and clearly so over-the-top (for reflex-purposes on Spider-Man's Part obviously) you couldn't help but watch as they unfolded upon the screen in awe. My favorite action sequence are the Harry (as the Goblin) vs. an Off Guard Peter Parker, and Spider-Man's daring rescue of Gwen Stacy as the building was being destroyed by the construction crane.Mary Jane is basically kept in Comic-Book characterization; She's obviously beginning to realize its harder to keep a promise than it is to say it in words when it comes to her relationship with Peter and his alter ego. Peter is overjoyed that the city no longer thinks of him as menace and is living in the moment of his fame. Its clear that its gotten to his head, especially when he tries to console Mary Jane's 'acting-gig' woes using his alter-ego as a constant example to compare her with. He especially let's it get to his head when he allows Gwen to kiss him in the very same manner Mary Jane did in the first movie. His success as a hero, his failure to listen to Mary Jane's underlying problems, and her failure as an actor begin drive a wedge between the two. So in turn, she begins to lean on an Amnesiac Harry Osborne for comfort, which unintentionally brings problems all three characters when Harry get's his head together finally and forces MJ to break up with Peter just as he get's his own head together (after vanquishing his uncle's killer). From there, things go downhill for Parker as he begins to turn to his infected Spider-Man suit for solace and vengeance against those who did him wrong.The acting, for the most part, was great on all sides. The primary actors (Franko, Dunst, and Maquire, JK Simons, among others) are pretty much comfortable in the skin of their characters, so nothing much has changed beyond the necessary personality-quirks required for this film. Its was nice to see a non-vengeance seeking Harry Osbourne for once, given that shtick was getting tiresome before they actually gave him something to do, and it was also nice to see the darker side of Peter Parker again. Thomas Hayden Church brings some intelligence and angst to otherwise dimwitted Brooklyn-accented character. The venom subplot isn't brought out of the closet until the right opportunity present itself (Uncle Ben's actual killer) and is utilized pretty much like it is in its various comic/cartoon incarnations. The score, composed by Christopher Young (Ghost Rider), is a welcome new sound, complete with themes for the new villains, while still keeping true to Danny Elfman's score for the previous two films. The only shame is that the producers didn't think it was worth investing a Soundtrack of its' own. Only the various artist soundtrack is available. By the way; it sucks, don't buy it.That aside, for me, the movie was allright despite the obvious lack of fluidity with the new characters (Gwen, Eddie, and Sandman). For one instance, the most wasted character in the movie was Gwen Stacy (my favorite female character in the SM-Series besides Black Cat); As much as I appreciate the acknowledgement of her presence in the films, there was really nothing for her do. She would've worked entirely better in Spider-Man II --- Mary Jane and Peter had yet to establish an actual relationship then --- as a potential lover for Peter. As it stands in Spider-Man III, she's just a tool used by the Venom-influenced Peter Parker to make his Ex-Girlfriend jealous.Thankfully though, Gwen doesn't stand for it and vanishes until the last moments of the film (in which Flash Thomson makes an appearance as well). Eddie Brock, wasn't given enough development to actually merit as something as a villain (or Venom in this case), but he wasn't a horrible character. Tropher Grace played off well as Maguire's rival in the film. I would've loved to have seen more of his and Gwen's relationship though. The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) was yet another 'misunderstood villain' type of character that viewers could actually sympathize for, as opposed to Dr. Octopus in SM-II. He is litterally showcased as a character in the wrong places at the wrong time. One of those wrong times actually bring him the means in which to retieve money for his daughter's sickness, but to his dismay he is constantly hindered by Spider-Man. The CGI used to create Sandman was amazing and quite reminiscent of the 1999 film The Mummy. The scene detailing Sandman trying to pull himself together after the accident, is poignant and dare I say it . . . beautiful in some grainy way.Another thing that irked me was the purposely-quick Up-close shots on Venom's (Eddie Brock) face and body whenever he appeared. It was as though they didn't take the time to refine this sidious character's appearance in the form of CGI and just went with what they used.One Last irksome thing I took notice since before the movie was released was the fact that Spider-Man's costume didn't lack its intricate web-design in place for a entirely black body suit. While I don't have problems with the final product, the black suit its very cool, for me, the webbless body suit always represented what Spider-Man wasn't and what Venom was.All in all It wasn't a bad movie. Sure it had its set of flaws, its biggest being one too many subplots, and one too many villians, but so did the first two. I mean who ever heard of Spider-Man loosing his powers because of is a confidence problem? [Spider-Man II] I cannot think of anything for Spider-Man, besides its innate silliness at times. ---- [3 out of 5]",3,"Spider-Man III fumbles with an ideal that would've been great, with one less

649889,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00005JPFH,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Please note that I've never read any Spider-Man comics and am simply judging this and any other Spider-Man film on their merits as films in a superhero film series.  Thank you for your understanding.When this film first came out, I quickly got the impression that people either loved it or hated it...no real middle ground.  I thought it was very good, though I stand firm by my stance that Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite in this series.  I do think that Venom, played by Topher Grace, came in kind of late in the game while the Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church, was absolutely great, becoming my second favorite villain in the series.  Tying him into the murder of Uncle Ben also contributed to this, as it made me wonder exactly how our favorite web-slinging hero would handle this.  It was nice to see Peter becoming comfortable in his duel role, showing that you don't need a billion dollars or an alien origin to accomplish this.  It was also nice to see him let his fame as Spider-Man get to his head, reminding us all how seseptible we can be to such cockiness when life's just going our way.  It was really nice to see Mary Jane actually doing something more than needing to be saved all the time, even if her blandness was only slightly lessened.  Harry Osborn's continuing story ark only got better, though it suffered from being rushed at times, a problem that plagued this entire movie.  There had been talk during production about spliting this movie into two flicks and, in my opinion, the church scene would have been the perfect end to part one.  I do wonder about the symbiote...it seemed to come a bit out of the blue.  I'm sure it was more established in the comics, but here, there was barely even ever a mention of outer space in this series and this thing from somewhere among the stars just suddenly shows up?  It seemed to jump the shark just a bit.  But for all my wondering and complaining, this was still a film I greatly enjoyed and I'd reccomend it to anyone.

First of all, I was fairly impressed by the way ""Sandman"" was done, though they portrayed him a little too sympathetically, as opposed to the way he was played in the magazine originally. In the original story introducing the character, he was given the standard, smarmy villain's personality....snarling, sassing Spidey whenever he could, threatening ....but in the movie, he's almost always silent as he fights Spiderman...and what FIGHTS!! Boy...Petey didn't like him much, did he?Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, THIS is the Spidey flick Roger Ebert should have saved his ""best superhero flick"" praise for, (it really IS the best of the Spiderman movies, but none of the Spidey flicks is ""the best superhero movie EVER...."") Jolly Jonah is the best he's ever been portrayed, live action, Topher Grace was a convincing proto-yuppie as Eddie Brock and all the drama and comedy relief was well done. And is it just me, or was Mary Jane's singing pretty much perfect in that dress rehearsal? Those producers had tin ears!There's a nod to ""Daredevil"" in the middle of the film, where Brock actually prays to the Almighty in a church, (while Spidey is there with his ""Venom"" coating,) to ""kill Peter Parker"" after Parker reveals him as a fraud in the Daily Bugle newsroom. Brock also eventually finds out Peter is Spiderman, so things get hairy from then on. A pattern is made rather obvious as Mary Jane is again used as a pawn in a game of death near the climax of the film. However, this is still handled well, and is a little tenser than the school bus scene in the first Spidey film.All in all, if you thought something was missing from the first ""Spiderman"" film, as I did, THIS one makes up for it!

This franchise was excellent under the guidance of Sam Raimi & I had my reservation if it's going to have an uneventful death as XMen3.  Fortunately, Spiderman 3 is still good when it could have been an outstanding classic. One outstanding trait from Sam is that he seldoms portrays the villains as two dimensional but that they are portrayed as victims of their circumstances.  This is intact for the third offering.  However, a better editing or a tighter script could have ironed out a few lull spots particularly Parker's relationship with Mary Jane which tended to drag on. In the cinema, I could see a large number of audience shifting uncomfortably looking for some actions.  The editor of the Daily Bugle is naturally the comic relief for this offering & so was Bruce Campbell from the Evil Dead.  I'm glad that the twists in this movie isn't revealed or else it would spoil the fun of others who haven't watched this movie.  Having said that, for comic book fans, you probably know already.  I do pick up nice messages from this movie, that ultimately, all of us have a choice in life.  At times, we might have lost our way but then, we need to persevere & we need to have self belief to bring the best out within ourselves.

After watching it, they actually helped me in being a bit more lenient on it and thus the three star rating.On the positive side are the special effects that are stunning (even more so on blu-ray) and the plot has some interesting twists that could have made the movie better than the two first ones.  For example the dark side of spiderman or the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend as they follow different paths in their careers.Alas that did not happen.  The plot remains swallow compared to what could have been.  Moreover the three villains are not well developed- especially Venom who could have been a great asset to the movie.  He has way to small part in a movie that evolves around super heroes and villains.  Sandman is a bit more developed and he could return if there is a Spiderman 4.All in all the movie is not that bad considering the special effects and costumes that are amazing.

I do have to admit I was afraid this movie would not live up to the first two Spider-Man's. I mean those first two were great and how could this one possibly match that? After I finished watching it I can say I was not at all disappointed. I think many people were expecting this to be just like Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 does take more risks than its predecessors by having more villains than usual, but It still manages to entertain, spark emotion and above all inspire and bring out the kid in many of us. It is like the first two with many of the same characters returning, but where Spider-Man 3 differs is when we get to see the dark side (with the black suit) of Spider-Man which takes the movie to a whole new level. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did a great job as usual and brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, that's what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride that I highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the hype of this movie, or the negative things some critics had to say. I went to see Spider-Man 3 to be entertained and I was not at all disappointed.Spider-Man 3 Two-Disc Special Edition DVD, Two-Disc Blu-rayDISC ONE Special Features:* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video* Audio: English Dolby True HD 5.1, English PCM 5.1 (Uncompressed), French, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai 5.1 (Dolby Digital)* Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese Mandarin, Chinese Cantonese* Bloopers* Photo Galleries* Snow Patrol Music Video* Audio Commentary with Director Sam Raimi and Cast Members Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard* Audio Commentary with Producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad and Grant Curtis, Editor Bob Murawski and Special Effects Supervisor Scott Stokdyk* Closed Captioned* Bonus PreviewsDISC TWO Special Features:* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video* Audio: English, Spanish 5.1 (Dolby Digital).

I only just recently bought the movie and watched it for a second time.  Surprisingly, I remembered almost nothing about it.  I felt as if I were watching some entirely new film.  Does that suggest the film is forgettable or that my brain synapses have really deteriorated?  In any event, I enjoyed the movie very much and was glad I made the purchase. Writing this at 1/29/11, I am already aware that the fourth Spider-Man will not feature any of the original cast or its director.  I don't want to pan something that hasn't been produced yet, but it's difficult to see how any production team can top the trilogy already in existence.  Above all, I credit Tobey Maguire for bringing to life Peter Parker and Spider-Man.  I seriously doubt that the Spider-Man franchise would have continued without Tobey.  His unique on-screen presence and subtle multi-dimensional characterization brought a distinct, charismatic quality to the web-slinger.  Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson was also exactly on the money.  The studio (Sony?) threw a proven, winning group of professionals to the wind.  If Spidey 4 bombs, it wouldn't come as a shock.  Anyway, Spider-Man 3 is a real roller-coaster ride.  The movie is fun, exhilarating, sentimental at times -- and keeping well in step with the comic book series.

Sorry, but that doesn't help the movie. And it doesn't fit in with Spider Man.3. WAY too many characters, most of which are under-characterized and unbelieveable; Venom is pretty much non-existent until the final fight, Eddie Brock has NO place whatsoever, and Sandman is whiny and emo for basically the whole movie.4. The Director is trying to cram way too many things into the movie; way too many charactors, too litle time. there aren't enough fight scenes and when there are, they are lame and only last for practically 1 minute.

649900,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B00005JPFH,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","I'd say the Spiderman franchise is doing pretty well in movies. Unlike other comic characters where there's never a story to tell and a lot of action sequences have to fill time, Spiderman has a life. And boy does it get complicated. Spiderman 3 is deceptively simple on the surface, but themes do take root and also tie together the earlier movies. I'm not sure why some people feel this is all too complex though, your average 10-year-old will get it, and guess who comics are actually for? What makes it even better for us adults are the powerful themes underneath like vendetta, breaking the law for a higher purpose, forgiveness, even what it takes to get married. Despite Spiderman being a hero, his life and the life of the villains aren't alien to us. That's successful screenwriting in my humble opinion.If there's one thing I didn't like about this film it's Peter Parker's dancing sequences. I wish I wasn't kidding, or that even that is was just a singular event. They're really a misplaced idea, a goof that absolutely should not have exceeded seconds of screen time but lasts minutes. They unfortunately really cheapen the movie by taking the viewer out of the experience. Others might take issue with the length of the movie, but I feel it uses every second (except the dancing) to effect, and didn't bother me.Overall I do like this movie though, because it represents one of the purest, most important cultural ideas. That is one many comics share, of the hero, of being an upstanding human being. Today kids are exposed to anti-social stuff constantly... whether it's videogames that are about shooting everything in the face and jacking cars, or TV reality shows about lying and backstabbing and prostituting yourself, or thug music that celebrates materialism and egotism. I feel sad for kids, what are they going to be inspired by? They're in training to be mediocre people who get their rocks off on disgusting behaviors.

649906,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B00005JPFH,RJ Smoove,"[11, 11]","I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a ""Deleted Scene"". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. Unlike the re-releases of the first two films, this one actually loses great extras that were on the first releases. Because of that, I have to dock it considerably in the extras department. All said, I Recommend it, but get the first release.",4,A Not-So-Guilty Pleasure,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3310,"['want', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'like', 'movie', 'Probally', 'more', 'do', 'said', ""'ll"", 'also', 'add', 'serve', 'purpose', 'prove', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'fine', 'character', 'development', 'okay', 'acting', 'make', 'shitload', 'money', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'only', 'decent', 'one', 'when', 'put', 'tall', 'dark', 'shadow', 'amazing', 'incredibly', 'revolutionary', 'predecessors', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'value', 'franchise', 'aside', 'introducing', 'most', 'popular', 'characters', 'Spidey', 'publication', 'history', 'said', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'attention', 'respect', 'deserve', 'feel', 'more', 'late', 'additions', 'were', 'shoehorned', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'Fantastic', '4', 'movies', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Elektra', 'Daredevil', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'less', 'savory', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'held', 'movie', 'down', 'were', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'unnecessary', 'dance', 'scenes', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'worst', 'two', 'dance', 'scenes', 'was', 'Peter', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'second', 'dance', 'scene', 'reminded', 'jazz', 'flute', 'scene', 'Anchorman', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'scenes', 'made', 'feel', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'was', 'too', 'comfortable', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'alot', 'money', 'was', 'major', 'competition', 'superhero/comic', 'book', 'movie', 'department', 'few', 'hits', 'couple', 'upcoming', 'challengers.That', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'passable', 'summer', '2007', 'now', 'have', 'Avengers', 'saga', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy', 'have', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'utmost', 'respect', 'care', 'addition', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'seemed', 'rather', 'pointless', 'planned', 'ellaborating', 'love', 'triangle', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'comics', 'later', 'installments', 'never', 'came', 'fruition', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'noticably', 'longer', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'felt', 'bloated', 'Thanksgiving', 'turkey', 'reason', 'two', 'dance', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'editors', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'truly', 'Deleted', 'Scene', 'Aside', 'dance', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'treatment', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Spidey', 'villain', 'Venom', 'Venom', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'late', 'addition', 'script', 'made', 'mad', 'addition', 'was', 'not', 'towering', 'manacing', 'presence', 'know', 'must', 'admit', 'loved', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'very', 'predictable', 'team-ups', 'Spider-Man', 'New', 'Goblin', 'versus', 'Sandman', 'Venom', 'really', 'brought', 'something', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'desperate', 'need', 'kick-start', 'Spidey', '3', 'was', 'not', 'disaster', 'so', 'often', 'been', 'called', 'geeks', 'armchair', 'critics', 'alike', 'was', ""n't"", 'achievement', 'either.Now', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', 'rather', 'mid-level', 'slightly', 'average', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'Simply', 'put', 'reference', 'quality', 'audio', 'video', 'transfers', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'flawless', 're-releases', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'actually', 'great', 'extras', 'were', 'first', 'releases', 'have', 'dock', 'considerably', 'extras', 'department', 'All', 'said', 'Recommend', 'get', 'first', 'release']",Spider-Man 3

For example...(this could be spoiler if you haven't seen any previews), Peter becomes infected with some black goop that not only turns his red suit to black...but unleashes his id.  He pulls his hair down over his forehead, resembling the lead singer of The Cure or Fall Out Boy.  That's amusing.  Then he begins to strut around the neighborhood, checking out the girls and buying ""stylish"" clothes in a scene that looks like it would be a spoof of Saturday Night Fever in a movie like Date Movie.  It's a sketch comedy bit in a bloated Action movie.  It was painfully out of place.There are other moments.  Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beloved, never manages to tell Peter she's lost her Broadway gig.  Granted, their relationship is struggling...but she would have told him at some point.Also, I'm finding it harder to buy all the coincidences.  First, the black goop falls from a meteor that happens to land right where Peter has his moped parked.  Then Flint Marko, the ""bad guy"" just happens to stumble into a scientific experiment at just the perfect moment to be turned into Sandman.  And then when Peter sheds the black stuff, he manages to drop it right onto his nemesis Brock.  It just stretches my willingness to suspend disbelief.Also, while we're on the ""bad"" stuff:  James Franco as Peter's friend/enemy Harry is terrible.  When his character gets amnesia, he also becomes a complete goofball.  And when he gets his memory back and is ""torn"" between helping or hurting Peter...his torment is just laughable.  I know Franco garnered a lot of acclaim in his earlier career...but he pretty much wasted any goodwill I might have had for him.  And frankly, Tobey Maguire looked mostly bored in his role.  I know he's always felt some ambivalence towards his role...but they paid you enough to lose that ambivalence, Tobey.  Get over being filthy rich, successful and a star!  I know it's tough, but suck it up!SPOILERS OVER:On the good side, we have nice performances from Topher Grace, who is alternately amusing and despicable.  Here's an actor who has some spark.  He could be in a league with Ryan Gosling if given the chance.  Think of his work in TRAFFIC.  Thomas Hayden Church does well by Marko/Sandman.  (And our sympathy for him is helped by EXCELLENT special effects for his various transformations.)  Bruce Campbell has a brief but VERY funny cameo as an unctuous French maitre d.  Thanks, Sam Raimi, for continuing to use him!The most important parts of any Spiderman movie are the action sequences, of course, and there are some good ones, alright!  The scene in which Spiderman saves the girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the malfunctioning high-rise crane is a blast.  There's real suspense there.  The final scene is over-the-top and exciting...especially as cars, cinderblocks and other debris plunge dangerously close to the imperiled Mary Jane.So I found the movie to be somewhat of a letdown from the psychological and acting standpoint.  The screenplay was just TOO packed...trying to be too many things to too many people.  But you won't complain about the action set-pieces...they are state-of-the-art.  So if you lower your expectations a little...you'll still have fun.  3.5 stars.",3,Great action scenes...but also feels bloated and lazy at times.,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3840,"['Spiderman', '3', 'adheres', 'pretty', 'tightly', 'More', 'More', 'theory', 'More', 'villains', 'more', 'subplots', 'more', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'big', 'loud', 'Summer', 'movie', 'apparently', 'most', 'expensive', 'ever', 'made', 'money', 'screen.It', 'also', 'occasionally', 'boring', 'silly', 'movie', 'realize', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'Spiderman', '2', 'gave', 'enough', 'believable', 'humanity', 'now', 'kind', 'expect', 'series', 'present', 'believable', 'humans', 'enduring', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'reacting', 'way', 'human', 'race', 'know', 'it.SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'BIG', 'ONES', 'Spiderman', '3', 'veers', 'back', 'incredulity', 'example', 'could', 'be', 'spoiler', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previews', 'Peter', 'infected', 'black', 'goop', 'not', 'only', 'red', 'suit', 'black', 'id', 'hair', 'down', 'forehead', 'resembling', 'lead', 'singer', 'Cure', 'Fall', 'Out', 'Boy', 'amusing', 'Then', 'strut', 'neighborhood', 'checking', 'out', 'girls', 'buying', 'stylish', 'clothes', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'spoof', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'movie', 'Date', 'Movie', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'bit', 'bloated', 'Action', 'movie', 'was', 'painfully', 'place.There', 'are', 'other', 'moments', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Peter', 'beloved', 'never', 'tell', 'Peter', 'lost', 'Broadway', 'gig', 'Granted', 'relationship', 'struggling', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'point.Also', ""'m"", 'finding', 'harder', 'buy', 'coincidences', 'First', 'black', 'goop', 'meteor', 'land', 'right', 'where', 'Peter', 'moped', 'parked', 'Then', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'stumble', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'just', 'perfect', 'moment', 'be', 'turned', 'Sandman', 'then', 'when', 'Peter', 'black', 'stuff', 'drop', 'right', 'nemesis', 'Brock', 'just', 'stretches', 'willingness', 'suspend', 'disbelief.Also', ""'re"", 'bad', 'stuff', 'James', 'Franco', 'Peter', 'friend/enemy', 'Harry', 'terrible', 'When', 'character', 'amnesia', 'also', 'complete', 'goofball', 'when', 'memory', 'back', 'torn', 'helping', 'hurting', 'Peter', 'torment', 'just', 'laughable', 'know', 'Franco', 'garnered', 'lot', 'acclaim', 'earlier', 'career', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'goodwill', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'frankly', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'looked', 'mostly', 'bored', 'role', 'know', 'always', 'felt', 'ambivalence', 'role', 'paid', 'enough', 'lose', 'ambivalence', 'Tobey', 'Get', 'being', 'filthy', 'rich', 'successful', 'star', 'know', 'tough', 'suck', 'up', 'SPOILERS', 'good', 'side', 'have', 'nice', 'performances', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'who', 'alternately', 'amusing', 'despicable', 'Here', 'actor', 'who', 'spark', 'could', 'be', 'league', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'given', 'chance', 'Think', 'work', 'TRAFFIC', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'well', 'Marko/Sandman', 'sympathy', 'helped', 'EXCELLENT', 'special', 'effects', 'various', 'transformations', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'brief', 'VERY', 'funny', 'cameo', 'unctuous', 'French', 'maitre', 'd.', 'Thanks', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'continuing', 'use', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'Spiderman', 'movie', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'alright', 'scene', 'Spiderman', 'girl', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'malfunctioning', 'high-rise', 'crane', 'blast', 'real', 'suspense', 'there', 'final', 'scene', 'over-the-top', 'exciting', 'especially', 'cars', 'cinderblocks', 'other', 'debris', 'plunge', 'dangerously', 'close', 'imperiled', 'Mary', 'Jane.So', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'somewhat', 'letdown', 'psychological', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'screenplay', 'was', 'just', 'TOO', 'packed', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'state-of-the-art', 'So', 'lower', 'expectations', 'little', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'fun', '3.5', 'stars']",Spider-Man 3

649911,A3E1N2J6DHGXL4,B00005JPFH,Robert Gamble,"[1, 1]","Here are the problems I had watching this movie (spoilers follow):1. The best action sequence was the first one between Parker and Harry.  Although that ring should definitely have hit the ground... Plus, Harry takes a ton of punishment before the clothesline and fall that 'kills' him until he's revived.  Obviously he doesn't have any specifically supernatural abilities so it's odd that he can just hop on one of his dear ol' dad's contraptions and suddenly show lightning reflexes and an ability to bounce off walls at high speeds with little damage.  The real problem is pacing... the fight scene is a lot of fun, breathtaking at times, and nothing in the rest of the movie, even the climax, comes close.2. Too many villains.  Three villains, three plot threads that all kind of messily combine at the end.  This makes for a movie that's too long but also too shallow.  Some elements occur too 'easily'.  For instance, Mary Jane's going along with Harry when he blackmails her.  She knows that Peter's Spiderman and can take care of himself.  Why does she just give in?  The Sandman's family and his interaction with them at the beginning was interesting, but he by the end of the movie you forget all about them.  Venom and Sandman become partners way too quickly, and then Sandman just as quickly does an about face for no apparent reason.  And why does Harry's butler take so long to tell him 'the truth' about his father?  And for that matter, what _was_ the apparation of Harry's father  that appears to Harry throughout the movie?  Was it all in his mind?  And why does Harry so quickly change sides?  Just because dear ol butler contradicts dear ol figmentary dad?  Seems a bit too convenient.  The writers made events which should have been relatively complex for them to have any believability into events that happened way too quickly.  Sandman suddenly having a change of heart was the only way they could have ended the movie without him killing Spiderman, since it was obvious he was indestructible to anything used on him (water?  he'll escape... turn him to glass? nope, he'll come back).The pacing was just wrong throughout the story.

Unless we filter in the topical criminal mind, and what makes him tick, we need not bother with the plot at all.OK, so they did that in the previous two flicks, and chose not to follow in the same avenue of what makes a ""criminal tick"" in this one, focusing more on the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane, which was fine with me. I don't view the superhero cartoons, or even Bugs Bunny with a yearning to find the origin of Yosemite Sam, and what's irking him. I simply accept his formidible non-compliance in dealing with his adversary.Same with the multi villain plot here. Although we do get casual glimps of the villains ""beefs"", this movie does not dwell on them, and I accept that wholeheartedly. I spent enough time with Doc Ock's woes in the previous film, and I'm glad they chose to make this one more nonsense, as well as fun.

649916,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPFH,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining.  There is such a plethora of characters, plotlines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.The ostensible selling point of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy.  The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time.  No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel fatigue).  The other foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father`s death (""old"" Goblin, if anybody`s keeping track); Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker`s uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero`s hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well).One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn`t have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment.  In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion.  While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles.  Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn`t all that convincing when he`s trying to play the bad-boy villain either).I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why ""Spider-Man 2"" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him.  In ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, Parker essentially has his ""evil"" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking.  Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spider-Man's ""flying"" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed).

Ok, so I hung onto comics till I was in my 30's.In the decades since, I've missed many Spider-Man stories, and many changes in Peter Parker and the Spider-Man.I was familiar with Green Goblin & Sandman, but not with Eddie Brock.

Peter is still struggling to earn a living, and Eddie Brock is there to challenge his limited progress.Then Spidey finds the black suit, and sees a more powerful, darker side of himself. The lives of Peter Parker and Spider-Man are threatened, as is Peter's relationship with Mary Jane.The movie's portrayal of the new Peter Parker is rather silly in so many ways. The silliest part is Peter's song and dance routine.

However, it tries to be much more than it is. For instance, the first movie had the Green Goblin. The second movie had Doc Oc. This outing has three--count 'em---three villains.Of course, this depends on the way you count the villains. One starts bad but turns good at the last minute. One starts of not ""good"" but aligned with Spider-man, then turns on him after being forcibly rejected. And one is presented as the escape convict with the misguided heart of gold.That being said, with so many villains whose story needs to be told, the story of Spider-man 3 ends up just feeling too rushed. There's too much story to be told here.My personal preference, if they insisted on making a movie with Venom, would actually be to present the symbiote in this movie, merged with Spider-man only. Then, after Peter realized what it was doing to him, he'd ditch it at the end of the movie, and end on the shot of Eddie Brock getting attacked/assimilated by the symbiote just before the fade-to-black, indicating that Venom would be the main villain of the fourth movie.

649925,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B00005JPFH,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[0, 0]","The strengths of the first two ""Spider-Man"" films are what you'd expect from Sam Raimi - insane action with moments (and many of them) of characterization.  With all of the action, you never feel rushed or short-changed, which made his films sorta the ""thinking man's action movies.""The same could be said for Tim Burton's take on Batman in his first go-around with the character.  Unfortunately, he fell on his face cramming two brilliant villains in one movie making for a much malaigned hurried pace that ruined what could've been two good movies.  The lesson here is obvious - too many things can simply add up to too many things.I had to think long and hard, obviously, about ""Spider-Man 3.""  (It took me THIS long to fairly write a review!)  Because there's a lot to like - I'm not being sarcastic here - yet there's simply too much jammed into the movie.  I'm stating the obvious, seeing what other people wrote, but when you really want to love a movie and see it just coming in slightly above average, one hopes the criticisms will add up, thus keeping producers, studio heads, et.al., from being too ""commercially ambitious.""Attacking the thinness and rushed pace is easy.  Mentioning that it's a disappointment when you expected more is a given.  Instead, let's look at what makes us love this movie, warts and all.  There are still moments of characterization here that makes it more deep than a simple summer popcorn movie.  For example, the complicated relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and the important people in his life.  Harry (James Franco, much underrated) and MJ (Kirsten Dunst, more than just a pretty face)get a lot of screen time here and none of it is wasted.  Harry blaming Peter for Norman's death isn't repetitive, it's refreshed anew by bringing in the traumatic amnesia that plagued the Goblin characters in the comic book (a good, not overstated, nod to comic continuity).  Harry's ultimate fate has that much more poignancy when it's played out because of this.The shoe being on the other foot in Peter's relationship with MJ was also a tad interesting, because it complicates things and that's always good for a romance that will be played out in a franchise.  It also tends to display how different Peter and MJ are - when Peter's life is going down the tubes, he internalizes it.  MJ however lashes out at Peter whan she loses her role on Broadway.  Thus the issue arises - IS MJ ""perfect?""  Nope.  She can be self-centered too.A conflicted villain is also interesting, which is why I rather liked Thomas Hayden Church's Flint Marko/Sandman.  We see a guy just trying to make money to save his daughter.  Being made into a silicon-based lifeform adds just enough of the spice to make him tough and tender.  He may be a crook, but he's being a crook (now) for the right reasons.  That they didn't split up the villains for two movies - giving both of them their due - is more of the shame looking at Church's take on Sandman.Topher Grace also deserved more as he was giving a good sociopathic charm to Eddie Brock BEFORE he became Venom.  At first, he's merely Peter's cheerfully obnoxious rival at the Daily Bugle.  However, we see hints of his delusional nature with how he inflates a ""coffee"" with Gwen Stacy (sorry I can't remember the actress' name right now, and that's another issue with too much in here - the new people don't have much time to shine) into a ""fantastic night.""  But the problem here is HIS story is a bit too rushed.  Wasn't it possible to have just the Symbiotic Thing that Venom becomes with Eddie play an (interestingly) understated villain in making Peter ""bad"" in this movie, paving the way for an expanded, and thus much better, fourth movie?Ah, but I'm being drawn into the negatives again.

649926,A2EZW8LU82S9KU,B00005JPFH,Scott Einig,"[3, 5]","Out of the Big Three in May of 2007 (which will forever be considered the biggest box-office showdown in history, composing of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,"" ""Shrek the Third,"" and Spider-man 3""), I was looking forward to ""Spider-man 3"" the most and wanted it to become the winner. I was and wasn't surprised when ""At World's End"" won. I was shocked because ""Spider-man 3"" had more going for it, mainly the fact that one of the most hyped Spidey villains (Venom) was in the film. I wasn't shocked because it was ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" the previous film ended on a cliffhanger, and it had a secret weapon: Jack Sparrow. And though ""Spider-man 3"" did have some weaknesses and its share of disappointments, I still ended up loving it (though nothing compared to ""Spider-man 2""). I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first:CAUTION: Some spoilers ahead1. Later on, it was revealed Venom (a fan favorite) was in the film, meaning all the Spider-man nerds would get their wish. I, of course, had no problem with it. My problem was that the villain was hyped to death, and he was only in the film for maybe fifteen minutes. I felt it wasn't fair of the filmmakers to let down the fanboys hoping for some sweet Venom action (although there are rumors of his return in future installments).2. Too much unnecessary comic relief. This is something the whole series suffers from on a grand scale, but it was very apparent in the third film. It rarely struck me as funny and came across as groan-inducing.3. The film was made out to be the darkest of the three, which I wanted. I expected the film to be very dark; I felt it would have benefitted the film more. Sadly, the trailers were off-putting again. ""Spider-man 3"" had an actually quite lightweight tone overall; I believe this hurt the film's previous reputation and hype in many ways. Sure, it had dark elements; but they could have spent more time developing those ideas and made them darker.4. Not enough action. ""Spider-man 2"" set the golden standard for comic-book action sequences, and I expected the third film to out-do it by a mile. Instead, the action scenes it had (while good) just (again) didn't meet the hype. The end battle with Venom and Sandman wasn't near as grand as it could've been. ""Spider-man 3"" was more of a drama film than an action film, and that was disappointing to an action fan like me.Enough bad stuff. Time for the goodies:1. The film stuck to the characters. No matter how much time is spent on them and their personal lives, I give lots of credit to director Sam Raimi for this. It gives us a reason to care for these characters and even the villains. On the human level the film succeeds mightily.2. The special effects were spetacular. We've come to expect this from nearly every major blockbuster, but the effects are almost always better in a ""Spider-man"" film. Though the particle effects on Sandman were at times unconvincing, overall the visuals were strong and believeable.3. Sandman. 'Nuff said.4. The film left me satisfied at the end, and gave me hope that in the years to come, we might see all of our beloved characters again. For any trilogy to accomplish that is a grand thing.So, in conclusion, regardless of the film's faults and missteps, I still think ""Spider-man 3"" is a grand-scale epic worthy of the name it's made for itself. Plus, it's a lot of fun to watch.",5,My personal favorite of the Big Three of '07,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,3379,"['Big', 'Three', 'May', '2007', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'considered', 'biggest', 'box-office', 'showdown', 'history', 'composing', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'World', 'End', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'Spider-man', '3', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Spider-man', '3', 'most', 'wanted', 'become', 'winner', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'when', 'World', 'End', 'won', 'was', 'shocked', 'Spider-man', '3', 'had', 'more', 'going', 'mainly', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'hyped', 'Spidey', 'villains', 'Venom', 'was', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', 'was', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'previous', 'film', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'had', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Spider-man', '3', 'did', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'share', 'disappointments', 'still', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Spider-man', '2', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bad', 'stuff', 'way', 'first', 'CAUTION', 'spoilers', 'ahead1', 'Later', 'was', 'revealed', 'Venom', 'fan', 'favorite', 'was', 'film', 'meaning', 'Spider-man', 'nerds', 'would', 'get', 'wish', 'course', 'had', 'problem', 'problem', 'was', 'villain', 'was', 'hyped', 'death', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'maybe', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'fair', 'filmmakers', 'let', 'down', 'fanboys', 'hoping', 'sweet', 'Venom', 'action', 'are', 'rumors', 'return', 'future', 'installments', '.2', 'Too', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'comic', 'relief', 'something', 'whole', 'series', 'suffers', 'grand', 'scale', 'was', 'very', 'apparent', 'third', 'film', 'rarely', 'struck', 'funny', 'came', 'groan-inducing.3', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'darkest', 'three', 'wanted', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'dark', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'film', 'more', 'Sadly', 'trailers', 'were', 'off-putting', 'again', 'Spider-man', '3', 'had', 'actually', 'quite', 'lightweight', 'tone', 'overall', 'believe', 'film', 'previous', 'reputation', 'hype', 'many', 'ways', 'Sure', 'had', 'dark', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'ideas', 'made', 'darker.4', 'Not', 'enough', 'action', 'Spider-man', '2', 'set', 'golden', 'standard', 'comic-book', 'action', 'sequences', 'expected', 'third', 'film', 'out-do', 'mile', 'Instead', 'action', 'had', 'good', 'just', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'hype', 'end', 'battle', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'grand', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Spider-man', '3', 'was', 'more', 'drama', 'film', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'disappointing', 'action', 'fan', 'me.Enough', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Time', 'goodies:1', 'film', 'stuck', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'personal', 'lives', 'give', 'lots', 'credit', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'reason', 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'villains', 'human', 'level', 'film', 'mightily.2', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'spetacular', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'nearly', 'major', 'blockbuster', 'effects', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'Spider-man', 'film', 'particle', 'effects', 'Sandman', 'were', 'times', 'unconvincing', 'visuals', 'were', 'strong', 'believeable.3', 'Sandman', 'said.4', 'film', 'left', 'satisfied', 'end', 'gave', 'hope', 'years', 'come', 'might', 'see', 'beloved', 'characters', 'again', 'trilogy', 'accomplish', 'grand', 'thing.So', 'conclusion', 'regardless', 'film', 'faults', 'missteps', 'still', 'think', 'Spider-man', '3', 'grand-scale', 'epic', 'worthy', 'name', 'made', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch']",Spider-Man 3

This movie is highly implausible, even for a superhero flick.  Are we to believe this intelligent alien lifeform just happened to come down in the park where Peter Parker is and glom onto his little weenie scooter?  I think Raimi was trying to cram way too much into this film.  And the romantic scenes between Parker and Mary Jane are laughable.  I suppose the fight scenes are pretty good, but then, it's hard to botch a fight scene with the computer animation and the budget that this film was slinging around.  One more bone to pick:  it infuriates me that this was only released in widescreen dvd format.  What about those of us who purchased the first two movies in full screen?  If the other two movies were released in both formats, then this one should be as well.  Let's hope this is the end of the Spider-Man movie franchise.  Superhero movie sequels can only go so long.

649931,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B00005JPFH,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[4, 5]","I saw SM3 yesterday, and needed a night to mull it over to decide if it was worthy of a four star rating.  At times, sitting in the theater I hated this movie during the romance conflicts between Peter and MJ.  During the action scenes, I loved it and couldn't get enough.  I kept thinking of other superhero movies that had made it to part 3, and what they had in common with this one.SpiderMan 3 definitely has it all.  There's romance with Peter and MJ on the verge of collapse.  Goblin Junior is still trying to take over Harry.  There's personal conflict when Spiderman becomes the darker side.  And there's super villains for Spidey to fight like Sandman.  What's important here is what Stan Lee said a few years ago for a TV special, ""Spiderman was always supposed to be different.  He's a college student with his own problems and trying to get the girl, but there's the struggle for his inner superhero to save the city. That's quite a bit of responsibility."" So, the director of this movie had quite a bit of responsibility too when it came to making this film.SM3 stays true to Lee's overall concept, although they do stray a bit from the original comic books in order to gel all of these storylines together.  The audience assumes that Topher Grace's dark side is Venom, Spiderman's worst enemy ever.  However, you are never told that in the movie.  Also, he's just another kid reporter taking photos.  Not an astronaut as he was in the comics.  Venom's reign lasts all but a few minutes here.  The true villain that we love to hate is Sandman, but you won't find yourself hating him here either.  He too is wrapped up in where he went wrong in life, escaping jail and unable to see his sick kid daughter.  He uses his powers just to rob a few banks, instead of trying to take over the world.Then, there's Goblin Junior.  There's an awesome battle scene between he and Parker at the very beginning, but then Harry forgets all about it and forgets who he is for a while after a bump on the head. I think this is because Goblin Junior had to be in the film since they left him wide open in Part 2, but they didn't want him to be the center of attention.And then there's Mary Jane.  She's a Broadway star.  Peter is going to propose.  Then MJ gets fired and Peter is too wrapped up in his Spiderman stardom to show her some sympathy.  As his darker side, he embarrasses her in a nightclub in an over-the-top cheesy dance scene where Peter is still craving to be the center of attention.  This storyline goes on and on and on, until Goblin Junior finally wakes up in Harry's head and forces MJ to break Peter's heart.  Again, GJ is quickly swept under the rug while we focus our attention on Peter defeating his dark side and Venom being born. The approach they took with GJ in the very end is a nice surprise (I won't spoil it for you here).So, in comparison with other superhero films, let's think about Batman.  Part II of the BM series was the first to approach there being two villains at once.  Burton kept it dark like the first one. Catwoman and Penguin were awesome.  Two totally different storylines that merge to defeat the caped crusador, but not too much for the viewer to keep up with on the big screen.  That was not true by the time we reached Part III and IV of the Batman legacy.  Plots were all over the place with multiple villains, bright lights, and way too much action that just made the movies silly.X-Men's Part III suffered because of too many mutant characters and underdeveloped storylines, and too much of the main characters we'd already seen in the first two; not to mention killing off 3 major characters all within 30 minutes.  These movies try to go all out and overwhelm us with special effects and poor character development.  I don't think SM3 suffers from that at all.  We do have 5 storylines: MJ and Parker, Goblin Jr and Harry, Dark Spiderman, Sandman, and Venom.  But they do fit together nicely.  There's romance, personal and superhero conflict, action, and villains.  I was never lost in the film or felt like they had left something unexplained.  No one was over-the-top and domineering of the storyline, leaving the other stories lacking at all.So, overall, I do think this is one of the best third films in the superhero franchise.  Yeah, I did want more of Venom and Sandman, but I kept having to remind myself that there was already a lot going on here.  SpiderMan II still remains my favorite to date out of all of them, but I will definitely be adding SM3 to my DVD collection!",4,"Too much conflict, but plenty of action!",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,4537,"['saw', 'SM3', 'yesterday', 'needed', 'night', 'mull', 'decide', 'was', 'worthy', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'times', 'sitting', 'theater', 'hated', 'movie', 'romance', 'conflicts', 'Peter', 'MJ', 'action', 'scenes', 'loved', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'kept', 'thinking', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'had', 'made', 'part', '3', 'what', 'had', 'common', 'one.SpiderMan', '3', 'definitely', 'romance', 'Peter', 'MJ', 'verge', 'collapse', 'Goblin', 'Junior', 'still', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Harry', 'personal', 'conflict', 'when', 'Spiderman', 'darker', 'side', 'super', 'villains', 'Spidey', 'fight', 'Sandman', 'What', 'important', 'here', 'what', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'said', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'TV', 'special', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'always', 'supposed', 'be', 'different', 'college', 'student', 'own', 'problems', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'struggle', 'inner', 'superhero', 'save', 'city', 'quite', 'bit', 'responsibility', 'So', 'director', 'movie', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'responsibility', 'too', 'when', 'came', 'making', 'film.SM3', 'true', 'Lee', 'overall', 'concept', 'do', 'stray', 'bit', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'order', 'gel', 'storylines', 'together', 'audience', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'dark', 'side', 'Venom', 'Spiderman', 'worst', 'enemy', 'ever', 'However', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'movie', 'Also', 'just', 'kid', 'reporter', 'taking', 'photos', 'Not', 'astronaut', 'was', 'comics', 'Venom', 'reign', 'few', 'minutes', 'here', 'true', 'villain', 'love', 'hate', 'Sandman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'hating', 'here', 'either', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'life', 'escaping', 'jail', 'unable', 'see', 'sick', 'kid', 'daughter', 'powers', 'just', 'rob', 'few', 'banks', 'instead', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world.Then', 'Goblin', 'Junior', 'awesome', 'battle', 'scene', 'Parker', 'very', 'beginning', 'then', 'Harry', 'forgets', 'who', 'while', 'bump', 'head', 'think', 'Goblin', 'Junior', 'had', 'be', 'film', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'Part', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'center', 'attention.And', 'then', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Broadway', 'star', 'Peter', 'going', 'propose', 'Then', 'MJ', 'fired', 'Peter', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Spiderman', 'stardom', 'show', 'sympathy', 'darker', 'side', 'nightclub', 'over-the-top', 'cheesy', 'dance', 'scene', 'where', 'Peter', 'still', 'craving', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'storyline', 'Goblin', 'Junior', 'finally', 'up', 'Harry', 'head', 'forces', 'MJ', 'break', 'Peter', 'heart', 'Again', 'GJ', 'quickly', 'swept', 'rug', 'focus', 'attention', 'Peter', 'defeating', 'dark', 'side', 'Venom', 'being', 'born', 'approach', 'took', 'GJ', 'very', 'end', 'nice', 'surprise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', '.So', 'comparison', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'let', 'think', 'Batman', 'Part', 'II', 'BM', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'approach', 'there', 'being', 'two', 'villains', 'once', 'Burton', 'kept', 'first', 'one', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'were', 'awesome', 'Two', 'totally', 'different', 'storylines', 'merge', 'defeat', 'caped', 'crusador', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'viewer', 'keep', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'time', 'reached', 'Part', 'III', 'IV', 'Batman', 'legacy', 'Plots', 'were', 'place', 'multiple', 'villains', 'bright', 'lights', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'just', 'made', 'movies', 'silly.X-Men', 'Part', 'III', 'suffered', 'too', 'many', 'mutant', 'characters', 'underdeveloped', 'storylines', 'too', 'much', 'main', 'characters', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'not', 'mention', 'killing', 'off', '3', 'major', 'characters', '30', 'minutes', 'movies', 'try', 'go', 'out', 'overwhelm', 'special', 'effects', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'SM3', 'suffers', 'do', 'have', '5', 'storylines', 'MJ', 'Parker', 'Goblin', 'Jr', 'Harry', 'Dark', 'Spiderman', 'Sandman', 'Venom', 'do', 'fit', 'together', 'nicely', 'romance', 'personal', 'superhero', 'conflict', 'action', 'villains', 'was', 'never', 'lost', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'left', 'something', 'unexplained', 'one', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'domineering', 'storyline', 'leaving', 'other', 'stories', 'lacking', 'all.So', 'overall', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'third', 'films', 'superhero', 'franchise', 'Yeah', 'did', 'want', 'more', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'kept', 'having', 'remind', 'was', 'already', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'SpiderMan', 'II', 'still', 'favorite', 'date', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'adding', 'SM3', 'DVD', 'collection']",Spider-Man 3

It's a mega blockbuster and come time for a sequel, expectations run amok. But I am happy to report that the third outing of this arachnid adventure is just what you would want it to be: very decent popcorn, amid some gulpy, wide-eyed sips of Coke.Nothing more, nothing less. Don't read too much if you haven't seen the film, it is best enjoyed with minimum hopes. The visual FX are a labor of love and grandeur, despite the running lament of CGI geeks. I had little idea prior to the movie that one of the villains would meet his biological alchemy. Very well composed (and decomposed).In trying to better what he has accomplished before, the director may have gone over-board by tripling the number of characters and by going for a much too bombastic face-off in the climax, which only amount to the exact opposite: a diminishing effect. But that is offset by the rewards of continuity from previous 'episodes'. There's a heady dollop of good-natured humor, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, love, morality, even some funky moves on the dance floor! Which is fun as it goes a bit beyond senseless derring-do.In the end, Spidey III is a refreshing departure from cardboard caricatures of good and evil. Bad guys are not always dripping in venom (they have a reason to do what they do, sometimes even rooted in affection), nor the good guys in saccharine. Tobey Maguire is effortless as the gentle, goofy Peter Parker, but we see an extra sliver of his acting range as he stretches his character--and his Spandex--when he is overcome by a dark, sinister thingie. Gives a whole new meaning to the expression ""getting one's tights in knots"".A word for Topher Grace. I am thoroughly impressed by how far he has come from That Seventies Show, to capers such as 'P.S.' and In Good Company, to a sharp, screen-dominating cameo in a Level A blockbuster. And he is equal to the task. His gamble with being the baddest of the bad guys, whose vindictive gene gets the better of him at last, is administered with such flair that one is guilty of hoping he would come around in the end. Does he? I'll leave that for you to find out. While he is at it, he sure is punchy.This is no classy noir but it is spectacular. And while it is studded with perhaps more characters than it may have time to fully develop, it does do its job, and does so with flying colors. Literally.",4,"IT DAZZLES.

Before 7-11 turned into Quickie Mart, you could get your Amazing Spiderman and Uncanny X-Men comics off the racks for .40 cents. Marvel comics and myself go back aways...Anyway, if you have not seen this movie, stop reading as there are some semi-spoilers!Spiderman 2 was a fantastic sequel due in part to the character development of Doctor Octopus throughout the movie. Raimi made us want Spidey to defeat him. The first movie also delivered the goods for Comic Book fans. Spidey's origin as well as his rivalry with the Green Goblin were spectacular. Their battles took you out of this world and into a Real-Life Comic Book world with heroes and villians.NOW, part 3... The biggest issue I have with this film is KEEP YOUR DAMN MASK ON SPIDERMAN! You are not Peter Parker Man with a Spiderman suit on. What was the deal with the ""New Goblin"" having a mask on for 30 seconds of the entire movie! I wanted to see him delve into the occult and become the ""HOBGOBLIN"". Part 3 could have centered around that (in my opinion). Topher's face was on a Venom Suit most of the movie also. The Headless Horseman could have been the villan, that way we would'nt have to see the actors faces the entire movie!!!!!!!!!!This movie suffered from Villan Overkill. What made the first 2 great were the hero/villan rivalries. Sandman was wooden and emotionless. Never once does he say ""OMG, I can make myself turn to sand and kick A** now"". His powers are there and that's that. The Goblin and Doc Oc were more aware of what they had become. There is no time for the Sandman's character to really ""interest"" us and make us hate him.Gwen Stacy is a very important figure in Spiderman comic book lore and could have been more vital in the movie. Obviously, too much is going on already in the movie at this point!The Venom part of this movie is the worst part for the Hardcore Fans! The Venom/Spiderman rivalry is STELLAR in the Marvel Comics Universe. What a disappointment it was to not see a hulking, muscular Eddie Brock as portrayed in the comics. Eddie towers over Parker and has true hatred for Parker for ruining his career. Why not cast Richard Simmons as Eddie Brock? He is scarier than Topher Grace. There are too many semi-important elements/sub-plots in this movie to have time to give Venom any screen time! SPOILER AHEAD...and why does'nt he just kill Parker when he's lying helpless in the clock tower. Venom can ""sense"" parker because he had previously bonded with the suit. Forget ""sense"" just look up! As vicious and blood-thirsty as Venom is in the comic books, he would have killed him in the tower.Everyone, including Peter Parker, cries too much in this movie also (WITH HIS MASK OFF, OF COURSE).SPOILER** At the end of the movie instead of crying like a baby he should have PUT HIS MASK ON, I REPEAT - PUT HIS MASK ON - PUT IT ON DAMMIT - and kicked Sandman's butt! I was waiting for the movie to end at this point anyway.BTW, NO ONE CLAPPED IN THE THEATRE AND THIS WAS OPENING NIGHT 12AM!

649934,A6UGTB17P5BX8,B00005JPFH,Simon Gifford,"[2, 3]","As a big Spider-Man fan, I was looking forward to this film a lot. First, let me point out it isn't a bad film. Far from it. But judge it by the standards of the excellent first 2 films and you may be disappointed.There's a lot to pack into 140 minutes of movie here, perhaps too much. Strangely, not only did I find the film too long, but also too short because there were lots of story threads to tie together, but some things seemed drawn out (Peter's transformation from good to bad) and others rushed (the storyline involving Harry Osborn's ""New Goblin"" villain and Sandman) and while I wasnt restless at all I confess I was waiting for the appearence of Dark Spidey, when some mysterious, black, alien symbiote takes over Peter Parker and his Spider-Man costume and turns him into a boorish, arrogant person. It also makes him more powerful when he is Spider-Man.However, despite what I said earlier it is a fun, exciting action film with some great set pieces.  It's also very funny. The scenes of Peter Parker gone ""bad"" are largely played for laughs, the scene where he walks out of a suit shop in swanky new threads and begins dancing like John Travolta was so funny.Having said that, it's out of step with the more menacing Bad Peter of the comic/cartoon though I realise the film series has always gone for a more comic style.Venom was great, and I liked the Goblin fights too. I won't spoil anything for you, but not only does the film deal with heroes with a dark side, it also shows sympathetic, humanised villains like Harry Osborn as the New Goblin, who thinks Spider-Man killed his father (in the first film). This element of the story is done very well, I think.Call me old fashioned if you like, but I thought the ""soap opera"" stuff with his girlfriend, Mary-Jane Watson (""MJ"") humanises Parker/Spider-Man.

I was worried myself that it wasn't going to be able to cover everything. It has Sandman, Gwen Stacey, Venom, Harry Osborn and Spidies turburlent relationship with MJ to deal with, thats alot of ground! but it also makes for a great movie. My gripe is that ever though it covered all of these story lines, it did it by simplifying most of them so they could fit. The action in the film is the best of the series and the best I've seen in all of the Marvel movies. There are a great number of fights and all of them are complex and dazzling to watch. The best part of of Spider-Man 3? The sub text of the plot. While it is a comic book movie and it's got all the eye candy to keep the kids and fan boys glued to their seats, it has a very rewarding moral. Spider-man 3 is a film of friendship and forgiveness. The characters of the film are often hurting each other out of pride or arrogance. The film shows that even though these things can be devastating to our personal relationships, forgiveness and understanding are always options to make amends.Through all of it's razzle dazzle and high octain action I found Spider-man 3 to be a deeper and more ""Human"" comic book film than most of the others combined.

649937,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00005JPFH,Sky,"[1, 1]","As I was watching Spiderman 3 I was reminded of when Joel Schumacher took the reins from Tim Burton (Batman/Batman Returns) to directBatman ForeverandBatman & Robin. Remember how Schumacher brought back the campy TV series Batman (especially for Batman & Robin) and destroyed the dark nature of the Batman series that Burton created?I wouldn't say that Spiderman 3 was as bad as Batman & Robin, but it was on par with Batman Forever...just an average movie. And that is surprising. Because it's not like there was a directorial change in the Spiderman series; Sam Raimi has been there from the start.Spiderman 3 has a...what's the word...'lighter' feel than the first two. It's brighter. It's a little campy at times. It's a little unrealistic. The effects are way over-the-top at times...especially The Green Goblin's glider skills. Spiderman 3 is just a lot less believable than the first two.Spiderman 3 was very fun to watch though. I was thoroughly entertained. Great visuals in high def (I watched the Blu Ray version). The first two Spiderman movies focus mainly on Spiderman's confrontation with one foe per film, but there are several villains in Spiderman 3. This helps provide an abundance of action.But the action doesn't save the movie from its wide stretches of reality. Sam Raimi is great at taking unfathomable situations, adding a little silliness, but making it all seem real. He just didn't do it as well in Spiderman 3 as he's clearly capable of doing it. So that took some of the shine off of Spiderman 3 for me.Let's hope that Raimi brings his A-game to Spiderman 4 announced for a 2009 release.",3,Raimi Goes Shumacher,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,1617,"['was', 'watching', 'Spiderman', '3', 'was', 'reminded', 'when', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'took', 'reins', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman/Batman', 'Returns', 'directBatman', 'ForeverandBatman', 'Robin', 'Remember', 'how', 'Schumacher', 'brought', 'back', 'campy', 'TV', 'series', 'Batman', 'especially', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'destroyed', 'dark', 'nature', 'Batman', 'series', 'Burton', 'created', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Spiderman', '3', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'was', 'par', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'just', 'average', 'movie', 'surprising', 'not', 'was', 'directorial', 'change', 'Spiderman', 'series', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'been', 'there', 'start.Spiderman', '3', 'what', 'word', 'feel', 'first', 'two', 'brighter', 'little', 'campy', 'times', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'effects', 'are', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'especially', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'glider', 'skills', 'Spiderman', '3', 'just', 'lot', 'less', 'believable', 'first', 'two.Spiderman', '3', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Great', 'visuals', 'high', 'def', 'watched', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'first', 'two', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'focus', 'mainly', 'Spiderman', 'confrontation', 'one', 'foe', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'villains', 'Spiderman', '3', 'provide', 'abundance', 'action.But', 'action', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'wide', 'stretches', 'reality', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'great', 'taking', 'unfathomable', 'situations', 'adding', 'little', 'silliness', 'making', 'seem', 'real', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Spiderman', '3', 'clearly', 'capable', 'doing', 'took', 'shine', 'Spiderman', '3', 'me.Let', 'hope', 'Raimi', 'A-game', 'Spiderman', '4', 'announced', '2009', 'release']",Spider-Man 3

649939,A3V43IU15LA3HA,B00005JPFH,snow47,"[0, 0]","First of all, this one is not tight quality wise as the first two Sam Raimi-directed films, in particular the masterful Spider-Man 2. However, even though it is overstuffed with villains and more than just a little bit crazy in more than one way, Spider-Man 3 is uniquely likable and ultimately hits all the right emotional notes.The biggest problem, for me, is that Venom really deserves his/its own film with more dedicated screentime. Venom probably should have been saved for a Raimi-directed Spider-Man 4 (which never happened). Also, Topher Grace may not have been the right actor for Eddie Brock, and Gwen Stacey's role is somewhat abbreviated. However, that is compensated for by Thomas Hayden Church's wonderful, pitch perfect turn as Sandman.In the realm of casual comparison, it's easy to lump this film in with other out-of-control sequels like X-Men: The Last Stand or Batman & Robin. But as time has gone by, I've realized that Spider-Man 3 hits the same sweet spot of meaningful characterization as the first two Spider-Man films.

649940,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00005JPFH,SteakSalad101,"[3, 6]","This is going to be a difficult review to write, but I shall try my best. I waited for Spidey 3 for a hell of a long time. Long, long time. I bought my tickets to see it in IMAX two and a half weeks before it opened. Slowly and even more slowly, the weeks went by alongside tons of schoolwork that only led me closer to the anticipated night.Well, it's half past midnight and I just got home from seeing it. First of all, let's look at the good side of the movie. The special effects were ASTOUNDING. They were incredibly realistic (even if it IS a comic book movie!) and experiencing the amazingly choreographed fight scenes in IMAX was well worth the extra five bucks per ticket. Sam Raimi's directing has also greatly improved, as he was able to balance somewhat of a minor interlocking storyline between three villains and still manage to keep the movie on its feet. I felt the length of the movie (roughly 2 1/2 hours) was perfect--long enough to keep you entertained, and short enough to keep you from not going bored out of your mind. Raimi and the writers even pack some HYSTERICAL humour into the film, with a classic cameo from Bruce Campbell as the Maitre'd of a French restaurant, plus many other laugh-out-loud hilarious scenes. Plus, my favorite part of the good points, is that Spider-Man 3 is a fun, fun, FUN popcorn movie. Lots of fun. Sometimes you look up at the screen and wonder ""what in the hell was that?"" But it's all good, cause overall, it's lots of fun and you end up not caring if the story makes sense or not. (It does, don't worry) The storyline is much more darker, complex, and mature than the first two movies, and it doesn't seem ""Spider-Man"" ish, which a lot of people were definitely NOT expecting. I think this is why a lot of people didn't like it. Now the iffy parts. The acting was OK. Yes, just OK. Not good, DEFINITELY not great--just OK. Tobey Maguire had me believing that he had improved from Spider-Man 2 but when we got to the scene with him and MJ on the bridge--oh my, the entire audience was gasping for air because we were all laughing so hard at his terrible fake-crying. Kirstin Dunst's acting skills never really annoy me; I think she's a great actress and while she's certainly not as good as many other actresses in Hollywood, she does a fine ""B"" job in Spider-Man 3 that works for the movie. I felt James Franco needed some variety, though, as throughout all three Spider-Man films he seems to be acting the same. And, surprisingly, Topher Grace was a lot of fun to watch! It'll be hard to watch That 70s Show again without thinking of Venom! Yet, out of all the performances, Thomas Haden Church comes out on top with a very serious portrayal of Sandman. He blew me away! (pun intended!) I didn't have a huge problem with the corniness of the movie. Yes, I know, the scene with Peter going emo and then gyrating his hips in front of a suit store had me raising my eyebrows, but it was a funny element to the storyline. Sure, we could've done without it, but they got some laughs and that's what counts. There were one or two scenes (particularly MJ and Peter on the bridge) that made me want to get up and leave, but they're over quickly.The part that bothered me the most, though, is that the ""strange black entity"" that bonds with Peter--the symbiote--had no real significance in the story whatsoever. It kinda just...happened. There was no backbone to the symbiote story, nothing about it was explained at all, and it just kinda attached itself to Peter's motorbike and then possessed him. It felt very random and, even though it was the whole movie storyline, very out-of-place. This bothered me a LOT.Overall: worth the trip, and if you get a chance, see it in IMAX. It's FAR from great, but it's a good film, and I liked it better than the first Spider-Man. A very nice kick-off to the summer movie season. Well done, Mr. Raimi!",4,Well...er...I liked it!,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,3892,"['going', 'be', 'difficult', 'review', 'write', 'shall', 'try', 'best', 'waited', 'Spidey', '3', 'hell', 'long', 'time', 'Long', 'long', 'time', 'bought', 'tickets', 'see', 'IMAX', 'two', 'half', 'weeks', 'opened', 'Slowly', 'even', 'more', 'slowly', 'weeks', 'went', 'alongside', 'tons', 'schoolwork', 'only', 'led', 'closer', 'anticipated', 'night.Well', 'half', 'past', 'midnight', 'just', 'got', 'home', 'seeing', 'First', 'let', 'look', 'good', 'side', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'ASTOUNDING', 'were', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'even', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'experiencing', 'amazingly', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'IMAX', 'was', 'well', 'extra', 'five', 'bucks', 'ticket', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'directing', 'also', 'greatly', 'improved', 'was', 'able', 'balance', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'interlocking', 'storyline', 'three', 'villains', 'still', 'manage', 'keep', 'movie', 'feet', 'felt', 'length', 'movie', 'roughly', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'was', 'perfect', 'long', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'short', 'enough', 'keep', 'not', 'going', 'bored', 'mind', 'Raimi', 'writers', 'even', 'pack', 'HYSTERICAL', 'humour', 'film', 'classic', 'cameo', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Maitre', ""'d"", 'French', 'restaurant', 'many', 'other', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'part', 'good', 'points', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'fun', 'fun', 'FUN', 'movie', 'Lots', 'fun', 'Sometimes', 'look', 'up', 'screen', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'good', 'cause', 'overall', 'lots', 'fun', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'caring', 'story', 'sense', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'storyline', 'much', 'more', 'darker', 'complex', 'mature', 'first', 'two', 'movies', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Spider-Man', 'ish', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'expecting', 'think', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'Now', 'iffy', 'parts', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'Yes', 'just', 'OK.', 'Not', 'good', 'DEFINITELY', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'OK.', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'had', 'believing', 'had', 'improved', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'when', 'got', 'scene', 'MJ', 'bridge', 'oh', 'entire', 'audience', 'was', 'gasping', 'air', 'were', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'terrible', 'fake-crying', 'Kirstin', 'Dunst', 'acting', 'skills', 'never', 'really', 'annoy', 'think', 'great', 'actress', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'fine', 'B', 'job', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'movie', 'felt', 'James', 'Franco', 'needed', 'variety', 'though', 'three', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'be', 'acting', 'same', 'surprisingly', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'watch', '70s', 'Show', 'again', 'thinking', 'Venom', 'Yet', 'performances', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'out', 'top', 'very', 'serious', 'portrayal', 'Sandman', 'blew', 'away', 'pun', 'intended', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'problem', 'corniness', 'movie', 'Yes', 'know', 'scene', 'Peter', 'going', 'emo', 'then', 'gyrating', 'hips', 'front', 'suit', 'store', 'had', 'raising', 'eyebrows', 'was', 'funny', 'element', 'storyline', 'Sure', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'got', 'laughs', 'what', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'MJ', 'Peter', 'bridge', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'leave', ""'re"", 'quickly.The', 'part', 'bothered', 'most', 'though', 'strange', 'black', 'entity', 'bonds', 'Peter', 'symbiote', 'had', 'real', 'significance', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'kinda', 'just', 'happened', 'was', 'backbone', 'symbiote', 'story', 'nothing', 'was', 'explained', 'just', 'kinda', 'attached', 'Peter', 'motorbike', 'then', 'possessed', 'felt', 'very', 'random', 'even', 'was', 'whole', 'movie', 'storyline', 'very', 'out-of-place', 'bothered', 'LOT.Overall', 'trip', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'IMAX', 'FAR', 'great', 'good', 'film', 'liked', 'better', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'very', 'nice', 'kick-off', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'Well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Raimi']",Spider-Man 3

649942,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B00005JPFH,Stephen C. Coyle,"[2, 3]","I truly enjoyed the Spider-Man movie.  Spider-man's acrobatics and and graceful leaps and swings over the city of New York never looked more impressive.  The Hobgoblin's defiance of gravity was well done too.  If there was an award for fight choreography while in the air, the people who made this movie would win it.In addition I was impressed by the Sandman.  They couldn't have picked a better actor to play the role and NEVER has the Sandman seemed more menacing or impressive.  He reminded me of some of those monsters from the 1960s issues of Strange Tales.  BEWARE!!!  FOR TODAY, THE SANDMAN WALKS!!!The Sandman was easily my favorite villain in this movie.Actually he was my favorite villain of ALL the Spider-Man movies.  They did a far better job on him than I ever expected they would.That having been said, I had a few problems with the movie.Let's start with those ""pumpkin grenades"" the Hobgoblin used.  In one scene a grenade exploded right in Harry's lap ... or his face.  You can't really see the grenades exact location when it blows up, the point is that Harry is at ground zero at the time.  Not only should Harry be dead, but his body should have shrapnel embedded in his bones and muscle tissue.  Most of his body should be scorched and burned beyond recognition.However in the movie, they ignore this.Instead of being dead, Harry has some burn damage to approximately 40% of his face.  And to make it even more ridiculous the burns don't even look fresh.  They look as if they've been healing for ten or fifteen years!Then it gets more ridiculous.Later in the movie, Harry throws one of his grenades at the Sandman.  When it explodes half the Sandman's head blows up.  At the time the Sandman's head is approximately 10 feet wide and approximately 12 feet tall.The same type of grenade ..... but dramatically different damage.Then things get FAR MORE ridiculous at the end of the movie.  One of those same grenades is used on Eddie Brock and the black symbiote.  THIS TIME the grenade does EVEN MORE damage!  Both Brock and the symbiote are incinerated.  After the explosion there's no charred flesh.  There's no broken bones.  There's no charred jawbone for identification by dental records.  There's not even any blood!  Eddie and the symbiote are totally vaporized!The same type of grenade that was used on Harry.  Only Harry survived with relatively minor damage.Did the writers and directors think that nobody would notice?Okay, that was my main complaint, but there is one more.After Mary Jane breaks up with Peter, he goes to the Jazz Club where she works.  He's acting like a guy on steroids at the time and engages in a number of activities that are either illegal or extremely tasteless.The main illegal activities I'm alluding to are when commits at least three acts of assault.  First he assaults the bouncer.  Then he assaults the club manager.  Then he assaults the lounge singer.There might have been more people he hit, but it all happened so fast it was hard to tell.Of course the club manager would love to press criminal charges against Peter Parker if he could ever find him or knew where he lived.  Mary Jane obviously didn't rat him out, but at the end of the movie PETER RETURNS TO THE CLUB WHERE HE COMMITTED MULTIPLE FELONIES!!!!The club manager and the bouncer would recognize him almost instantly and call the cops to have him arrested.If the club manager is a really nice guy he might not press charges and merely have Peter banned from the club for life.But really....... are any of the club managers in New York City THAT nice??",3,I've got a few complaints about this movie,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,3581,"['truly', 'enjoyed', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Spider-man', 'acrobatics', 'graceful', 'leaps', 'swings', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'impressive', 'Hobgoblin', 'defiance', 'gravity', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'was', 'award', 'fight', 'choreography', 'air', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'win', 'it.In', 'addition', 'was', 'impressed', 'Sandman', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'NEVER', 'Sandman', 'seemed', 'more', 'menacing', 'impressive', 'reminded', 'monsters', '1960s', 'issues', 'Strange', 'Tales', 'BEWARE', 'TODAY', 'THE', 'SANDMAN', 'WALKS', 'Sandman', 'was', 'easily', 'favorite', 'villain', 'movie.Actually', 'was', 'favorite', 'villain', 'Spider-Man', 'movies', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'ever', 'expected', 'would.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'movie.Let', 'start', 'pumpkin', 'grenades', 'Hobgoblin', 'used', 'one', 'scene', 'grenade', 'exploded', 'right', 'Harry', 'lap', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'grenades', 'exact', 'location', 'when', 'up', 'point', 'Harry', 'ground', 'zero', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'should', 'Harry', 'be', 'dead', 'body', 'should', 'have', 'shrapnel', 'embedded', 'bones', 'muscle', 'tissue', 'Most', 'body', 'should', 'be', 'scorched', 'burned', 'recognition.However', 'movie', 'ignore', 'this.Instead', 'being', 'dead', 'Harry', 'burn', 'damage', 'approximately', '40', '%', 'face', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'burns', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'fresh', 'look', ""'ve"", 'been', 'healing', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Then', 'more', 'ridiculous.Later', 'movie', 'Harry', 'one', 'grenades', 'Sandman', 'When', 'Sandman', 'head', 'up', 'time', 'Sandman', 'head', 'approximately', '10', 'feet', 'wide', 'approximately', '12', 'feet', 'tall.The', 'same', 'type', 'grenade', '..', 'dramatically', 'different', 'damage.Then', 'things', 'get', 'FAR', 'MORE', 'ridiculous', 'end', 'movie', 'One', 'same', 'grenades', 'used', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'black', 'symbiote', 'THIS', 'grenade', 'EVEN', 'MORE', 'damage', 'Brock', 'symbiote', 'are', 'incinerated', 'explosion', 'charred', 'flesh', 'broken', 'bones', 'charred', 'jawbone', 'identification', 'dental', 'records', 'not', 'even', 'blood', 'Eddie', 'symbiote', 'are', 'totally', 'vaporized', 'same', 'type', 'grenade', 'was', 'used', 'Harry', 'Only', 'Harry', 'survived', 'relatively', 'minor', 'damage.Did', 'writers', 'directors', 'think', 'nobody', 'would', 'notice', 'Okay', 'was', 'main', 'complaint', 'one', 'more.After', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'up', 'Peter', 'Jazz', 'Club', 'where', 'acting', 'guy', 'steroids', 'time', 'engages', 'number', 'activities', 'are', 'illegal', 'extremely', 'tasteless.The', 'main', 'illegal', 'activities', ""'m"", 'alluding', 'are', 'when', 'commits', 'least', 'three', 'acts', 'assault', 'First', 'bouncer', 'Then', 'club', 'manager', 'Then', 'lounge', 'singer.There', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'people', 'hit', 'happened', 'so', 'fast', 'was', 'hard', 'tell.Of', 'course', 'club', 'manager', 'would', 'love', 'press', 'criminal', 'charges', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'knew', 'where', 'lived', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'rat', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'PETER', 'RETURNS', 'TO', 'THE', 'CLUB', 'WHERE', 'HE', 'COMMITTED', 'MULTIPLE', 'FELONIES', 'club', 'manager', 'bouncer', 'would', 'recognize', 'almost', 'instantly', 'call', 'cops', 'have', 'arrested.If', 'club', 'manager', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'might', 'not', 'press', 'charges', 'merely', 'have', 'Peter', 'banned', 'club', 'life.But', 'really', 'are', 'club', 'managers', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'THAT']",Spider-Man 3

One reviewer asks us to ""let down our expectations."" Why? Why shouldn't I expect the same quality that the folks used for the first two? It isn't as if they don't have the time, money, or skills - not to mention forty years of comic books to browse for story lines. If anything I should keep my expectations high all the time. Why do we get crappy films? Because we have lowered expectations, that's why.This movie has too many bad guys, too much of a downright silly plot, shameful under utilization of entertaining characters (J.J.J.) in favor of smarmy ones (Eddie Brock/Venom) and veers back and forth between parody and seriousness to utter distraction. Perhaps the worst offense is that by the end of the movie, you just don't care about Peter Parker/Spider-Man. What a shame.In addition, this movie was a drag because it lacked any good action sequences, and for that matter, not enough action sequences period and it had WAY too much drama. The fight scenes were so fast and so hard to follow that I found myself wondering what was going on and the drama was so contrived and cliched that I simply didn't care. It is indeed a long fall from the spectacular train fight sequence and the simple agonizing romance of Peter and M.J. in the second movie to the nauseating action and embarassingly maudlin scenes in this film.I truly hope that they either stop this series now or go back to the first two movies and really study what made them so good.

But instead, the filmmakers decide to once again make Spidey an emotionally-complex character, and what only worked slightly for the previous entry pretty much wrecks ""Spider-man 3,"" probably the worst super-hero film I've seen. Ever.Tobey Maguire proves that he's been seriously miscast as Spider-man/Peter Parker, and whatever talents he had in the role are wasted in lame attempts at making emo-Spidey look like a jerk-wad, but are the stupidest thing they could have done. The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst is given very little to work with, so her performance is only adequate at best. James Franco shows some chops, but not much. Topher Grace is pretty much wasted as Venom, and Bryce Dallas Howard, so easy on the eyes, is provided with little as well. The best performance of the film comes from Thomas Haden Church, who turns in a strong performance as Sandman, a conflicted character the audience can't help but sympathize with.There's plenty of action, and the exciting climax makes up for a little, but the writer's packed way too much into a 139-minute movie, and the film drags because of it. What should have been a return to the elements of the comic book becomes a tedious, overly-long emo trip that fans are sure to find as horrid as I did.The Blu-ray release is good, with great picture and sound, and some nice extras.

649946,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPFH,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[47, 79]","This film had awfully big shoes to fill with the highly successful Spider-Man 2 which is arguably the best comic-book film of all time.  One can't fault the spidey team for trying to be ambitious here, but they just can't exceed, let alone match, their previous effort.  This film is extremely satsifying and deserves to be the blockbuster that it is with its record setting $148 million opening weekend, outdoing Pirates 2 the previous opening weekend champ.  Pirates 3 just missed outperforming Spidey 3 by about 10 million recently; therefore, Spidey 3 reigns champ for now on opening box-office revenue.One has to consider the pressure on this team to continue a story in which they obviously have great affection and in addition to living up to great expectations, these folks also had to heavily consider that this could be the last Spider-Man film as both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have made it very clear that they want to move on past Spider-Man before it wrecks their careers like the superhero actors of the past.  This may explain the overly complex storyline, the introduction of Gwen Stacey (for future romance should Dunst walk), multiple villains (under the notion that more is always better), and the over-reliance on special effects (which are outstanding).  It's all a bit too much even though it is all entertaining, but if this is to be the last Spidey film, they wanted to give it all they had.  Too bad it just isn't as good as their last effort, but it is still an outstanding film and great popcorn fun.  You will have a blast with this film if you lower your expectations just a bit.  I left the theater very satisfied.Some Strengths: The Sandman effects are outstanding and manage to emote great sympathy for this character who is skillfully played by Thomas Haden Church of TV'sWingsand the hit filmSideways.  The black blob effects are really spooky.  Kudos to James (Annapolis) Franco as Parker's best friend.  He was outstanding and believable the entire time.Some Weaknesses: Too ambitious and too contrived.  Spidey being taken over by the black blob wanders back and forth from weird and haunting to sensationally funny to the point of looking like a Saturday Night Live parody of Saturday Night Fever.

649951,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,B00005JPFH,SylvesterFox007,"[20, 37]","Right now, I know you're not going to want to believe me.  But trust me, this movie isn't what you think it is.  I loved the first Spider-Man movie.  I tell people that it took me on the whole emotional journey: I laughed, I cried, and I had more fun that I did during any other super hero movie.  And then I enjoyed the second Spider-Man movie.But there were those rumors that Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst all wanted out of the franchise.  And there were those rumors that the producers wanted to do more, with or without them.  About halfway through ""Spider-Man 3"", I got the distinct impression that writer/director Raimi and star Maguire were intentionally trying to sabotage the franchise, brilliantly screwing the studio heads begging for more sequels and, consequentially, the audience as well.The movie starts out promisingly enough, as an excellent character drama in the spirit of the first two movies.  Like the first two, the movie puts the emphasis squarely on the character of Peter Parker and his relationship with those around him, specifically beautiful redhead Mary Jane and ""New Goblin"" James Franco, as well as Eddie Brach Gwen Stacey, Aunt May, Sandman, J. Jonah Jameson, Captain Stacey, and too many others for the director to keep track of, even if he wanted to, which Raimi certainly doesn't seem to.  Then there's the sloppy handling of the introduction of the symbiote that will eventually create Venom.  And there's also the annoying continuity error of Eddie Brach, already mentioned as being a photographer for the Daily Bugle in the second movie, coming to the Bugle for the first time in search of a job.Despite a few excellent action sequences, the character drama soon devolves into an overly long soap opera filled with love triangle upon triangle and other contrived interactions between the characters.  The movie then devolves further into a B-list monster movie.  Along the way, it mixes in song-and-dance numbers, extremely awkward and sometimes laughable moments, forced humor, and clich&eacute; lines from cheesy buddy cops movies.  And the whole time the dialogue and situations become more and more cringe-worthy, to the point it seems certain that Raimi and Maguire were trying to make the worst movie possible in order to guarantee there wouldn't be a ""Spider-Man 4.""  The movie climaxes in a series of sickly sweet, over-the-top, sappy ""moral of the story"" scenes.Kirsten Dunst at least seems to not be trying to destroy the movie, turning in one of the film's better performances.  Nor does Christopher Young, who takes over scoring duties from Danny Elfman, who also wanted desperately out of the franchise.  The special effects people also seem to still be trying to turn in their best work, doing incredible jobs of bringing Sandman and Venom to life, even though the movie's major showdown involving the two villains seems like something out of a cheap Godzilla or King Kong movie.  Bryce Dallas Howard is kinda cute as Gwen Stacey but seems somehow unnatural.  Meanwhile, Topher Grace as Eddie Brach/Venom seems to be playing a more contemporary version of his character from ""That 70's Show"" while Tobey Maguire, who did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker in the first two movies, mugs so much that he, once again, seems intent on sabotaging the franchise.The only other people involved with the film who did a decent job were the advertisers.  By placing elements of all the best scenes into every trailer, they raised my expectations for ""Spider-Man 3.""

By the 3rd film, there are few surprises left, and the initial movie has taken on the glow of nostalgia. So although Spider-man 3 didn't seem to be getting such great reviews, I suspected that it would be better than its reputation. Still, I was surprised by just how good it actually was.The core of the Spider-man story has always been the soap opera of Peter Parker's life counterbalancing the superheroism. I was worried that with 3 classic Spider-man villains on the bill, the 3rd movie would veer too heavily in the direction of spider-action and shortchange Peter. Thankfully, it did not fall into this trap. There is a strong plot centering around Peter's plans to propose to Mary Jane, her faltering acting career, and the complication of Gwen Stacy.It was good to see the character of Gwen Stacy in the movie, even though she is a romantic complication rather that Peter's first love the way that she was in the original comic series. Though dramatically strong, the tragic fate of Gwen Stacy in the comics is a bit too heavy for an feel-good action film, so it does not seem unreasonable for the movie to follow more recent retellings of the Spiderman story by keeping the focus on Mary Jane as the primary love interest.Villain team-ups are of course a staple of Spider-man, but can veer off into overkill. That doesn't happen here. The main antagonists: the Sandman, Venom, and Harry as the son of the Green Goblin are different enough that they complement rather than compete. The film nails the character and look of the Sandman perfectly--a thug, not fundamentally evil, but a guy who always manages to make the worst possible choices. Venom similarly captures the character almost perfectly. The ultimate outcome of Peter's conflict with Harry caught me by surprise (fortunately I'd managed to avoid spoilers).The one aspect of the film that I found a bit weak, much to my surprise, was the CGI.

But such serenity is not meant to last, and our masked hero is attacked by foes both old and new. Parker's best friend Harry has again risen to avenge his father, a man made of sand terrorizes New York, and a gooey symbiotic life-form threatens to destroy Spider-Man entirely. With plenty of fantastical action, a heart-wrenching storyline complete with love and revenge, the funniest Bruce Campbell cameo ever, and a special effects-laden final showdown the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed before, Spider-Man 3 may be the best installment yet.Spider-Man 3 is undeniably an entertaining film. But Sam Raimi, perhaps pressured by the huge fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into the third chapter of this hugely popular franchise. One of Spider-Man's best designed and admired comic book villains, Venom, makes his big screen debut, but it feels awfully small. Focusing mainly on New Goblin and the Sandman, Venom is left to relish in only the last half of the film. His design is greatly lacking from the enormously muscular and grotesque look of the comics. His large teeth-laden mouth and flicking snake-like tongue are drastically toned down and instead he is equipped with a high-pitched shriek. While Topher Grace's acting is adequate, his scrawny stature just doesn't seem to fit with how Venom has been drawn for so many years. The character development for this character is greatly stunted, and by the time Eddie Brock becomes Venom we don't really hate him and his motives against Spidey seem somewhat trivial.On the bright side, Sandman is an astonishing villain to behold and his human side is developed with much more care. Thomas Haden Church portrays Flint Marko with a tender demeanor and an honesty that makes you believe he's merely a victim of circumstance. The premise that leads to Marko becoming a powerful manipulator of sand is a bit hokey, but relatively accurate to his comic book origins. Spider-Man even comments: ""where do these guys come from?"" The special effects are flat out jaw-dropping. The realistic particle effects and transformations of dirt and mud forming into Church's statuesque face are unbelievably impressive and toward the conclusion when Sandman becomes a giant monstrosity of earth and cement, his roar of utter awesomeness echoes his appearance.Spider-Man 3 does contain the most involved and complex love story of the three, and is a perfect culmination of all the loose ends and various plotlines started in the first two films. The story arc of Harry Osborn and his demented alter ego finally concludes and Spider-Man must try once and for all to mend their fragile friendship. Mary Jane and Peter plan to marry but jealousy and misunderstandings constantly impede their struggling love, and the appearance of Gwen Stacy (the gorgeous blonde Bryce Dallas Howard) further complicates their already murky love affair.Raimi divides the suspense in a few key spots with some truly inspired and outrageous dance numbers. Tobey throws around a few riotously funny moves after Venom's poison takes effect, giving him a cocky self-confidence and the desire to appear a bit ""emo"". These bits of humor perfectly supplement the tone and help ease the breakneck pacing of the film's action. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell's signature cameo, which easily outdoes the other two in comedic value.With near perfect special effects, interesting new characters, and an intensely complex storyline that converges and concludes every plot point and loose end from its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 is both a fitting finale and colossal blockbuster no Spidey fan should dare miss. Again shattering the myth that sequels can't be better than the original, this final chapter in the Spider-Man trilogy sends off our web-slinging superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations the legion of loyal fans hold for the series.-The Massie Twins",4,Spider Man 3 Movie Review,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,4141,"['final', 'chapter', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'trilogy', 'find', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'finally', 'reaching', 'fulfilling', 'equilibrium', 'normal', 'life', 'crime-fighting', 'one', 'proposal', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'such', 'serenity', 'not', 'meant', 'last', 'masked', 'hero', 'attacked', 'foes', 'old', 'new', 'Parker', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'again', 'risen', 'avenge', 'father', 'man', 'made', 'sand', 'New', 'York', 'gooey', 'symbiotic', 'life-form', 'threatens', 'destroy', 'Spider-Man', 'entirely', 'plenty', 'fantastical', 'action', 'heart-wrenching', 'storyline', 'complete', 'love', 'revenge', 'funniest', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'cameo', 'ever', 'special', 'effects-laden', 'final', 'showdown', 'magnitude', ""n't"", 'been', 'witnessed', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'installment', 'yet.Spider-Man', '3', 'undeniably', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'perhaps', 'pressured', 'huge', 'fan', 'base', 'studio', 'executives', 'tried', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'third', 'chapter', 'hugely', 'popular', 'franchise', 'One', 'Spider-Man', 'best', 'designed', 'admired', 'comic', 'book', 'villains', 'Venom', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'awfully', 'small', 'Focusing', 'mainly', 'New', 'Goblin', 'Sandman', 'Venom', 'left', 'relish', 'only', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'design', 'greatly', 'lacking', 'enormously', 'muscular', 'grotesque', 'look', 'comics', 'large', 'teeth-laden', 'mouth', 'flicking', 'snake-like', 'tongue', 'are', 'drastically', 'toned', 'down', 'instead', 'equipped', 'high-pitched', 'shriek', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'acting', 'adequate', 'scrawny', 'stature', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'how', 'Venom', 'been', 'drawn', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'character', 'development', 'character', 'greatly', 'stunted', 'time', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Venom', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hate', 'motives', 'Spidey', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'bright', 'side', 'Sandman', 'astonishing', 'villain', 'behold', 'human', 'side', 'developed', 'much', 'more', 'care', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'tender', 'demeanor', 'honesty', 'believe', 'merely', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'premise', 'Marko', 'becoming', 'powerful', 'manipulator', 'sand', 'bit', 'hokey', 'relatively', 'accurate', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'Spider-Man', 'even', 'comments', 'where', 'do', 'guys', 'come', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'flat', 'jaw-dropping', 'realistic', 'particle', 'effects', 'transformations', 'dirt', 'mud', 'forming', 'Church', 'statuesque', 'face', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'impressive', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Sandman', 'giant', 'monstrosity', 'earth', 'cement', 'roar', 'utter', 'awesomeness', 'appearance.Spider-Man', '3', 'contain', 'most', 'involved', 'complex', 'love', 'story', 'three', 'perfect', 'culmination', 'loose', 'ends', 'various', 'plotlines', 'started', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'story', 'arc', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'demented', 'alter', 'ego', 'finally', 'Spider-Man', 'must', 'try', 'once', 'mend', 'fragile', 'friendship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'plan', 'marry', 'jealousy', 'misunderstandings', 'constantly', 'impede', 'struggling', 'love', 'appearance', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'further', 'already', 'murky', 'love', 'affair.Raimi', 'suspense', 'few', 'key', 'spots', 'truly', 'inspired', 'outrageous', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Tobey', 'around', 'few', 'riotously', 'funny', 'moves', 'Venom', 'poison', 'effect', 'giving', 'cocky', 'self-confidence', 'desire', 'appear', 'bit', 'emo', 'bits', 'humor', 'perfectly', 'supplement', 'tone', 'help', 'ease', 'breakneck', 'pacing', 'film', 'action', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'signature', 'cameo', 'easily', 'other', 'two', 'comedic', 'value.With', 'perfect', 'special', 'effects', 'interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'intensely', 'complex', 'storyline', 'converges', 'concludes', 'plot', 'point', 'loose', 'end', 'predecessors', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'fitting', 'finale', 'colossal', 'blockbuster', 'Spidey', 'fan', 'should', 'dare', 'miss', 'Again', 'shattering', 'myth', 'sequels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'original', 'final', 'chapter', 'Spider-Man', 'trilogy', 'web-slinging', 'superhero', 'adventure', 'befitting', 'expectations', 'legion', 'loyal', 'fans', 'hold', 'series.-The', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Spider-Man 3

Cinematography by Bill Pope.Starring Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons, James Cromwell, Theresa Russell, Dylan Baker, Bruce Campbell, Ted Raimi, Emma Raimi, Lorne Raimi, Henry Raimi, Stan Lee, Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe.An appalling pile of rubbish, the film is the equivalent of BATMAN RETURNS, BATMAN BEGINS, BATMAN AND ROBIN, X MEN 2 or SUPERMAN 3. The problems--always inherent in the series since the first film and steadily growing have finally overwhelmed it here. An overstuffed, chaotic consistently badly done mess, it is very obvious that no one from Raimi, Maquire or Dunst down wanted to be there. Raimi--a bad director of the just toss things at the screen and nobody will care school ala Tim Burton--was never truly comfortable with being true to the book and has managed finally to screw up every single element that made the book and character great and popular. Everyone in the film--save Church's Sandman and Franco's Harry Osborn are portrayed as self centered jerks and are thoroughly unlikable. Maguire cannot keep the Spiderman mask on for more than three minutes and is constantly taking it off. Peter Parker's secret identity is now a joke. He has two full fights not even in costume. He runs around a construction site in front of thousands of people and TV cameras without his mask. Venom knows who he is. The Sandman knows who he is.The performances are all uniformly wrong. Howard plays Gwen Stacy as a airhead. There is no reason for Russell or Cromwell to even be in the film. There is an appallingly retarded scene where Gwen Stacy's father and boyfriend see her plunge to certain death and they make snappy one liners. Instead of Harry becoming the Green Goblin or the Hobgoblin, Raimi has him become the Rocket Racer!!! There is an embarringly ugly scene where the only truly evil villain in the series aka one who is not driven to his actions by some accident--is revealed to be a practicing Catholic, prays to Jesus to help him kill Peter Parker and the Messiah immediately grants his wish.(Raimi must have been trying to innoculate the film against negative reviews by indulging in Anti-Christian bigotry). The CGI is wall to wall and boring...utterly boring. Cartoon characters fighting in impossible to follow fights.The series--like the X men/ Superman series did with Singer-- needed to can IMMEDIATELY Raimi, Maquire and Dunst but it appears that it was considered beyond repair and needed to be rebooted.Great pity.",1,SPIDERMAN 3 VIEWER 0,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,2677,"['SPIDERMAN', '3', '2007', 'Script', 'Direction', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Produced', 'Avi', 'Arad', 'Stan', 'Lee.Score', 'Christopher', 'Young', 'Cinematography', 'Bill', 'Pope.Starring', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'James', 'Franco', 'Thomas', 'Church', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'Emma', 'Raimi', 'Lorne', 'Raimi', 'Henry', 'Raimi', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Willem', 'Dafoe.An', 'appalling', 'pile', 'rubbish', 'film', 'equivalent', 'BATMAN', 'RETURNS', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'BATMAN', 'AND', 'ROBIN', 'X', 'MEN', '2', 'SUPERMAN', '3', 'problems', 'always', 'inherent', 'series', 'first', 'film', 'steadily', 'growing', 'have', 'finally', 'overwhelmed', 'here', 'overstuffed', 'chaotic', 'consistently', 'badly', 'done', 'mess', 'very', 'obvious', 'one', 'Raimi', 'Maquire', 'Dunst', 'down', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'Raimi', 'bad', 'director', 'just', 'toss', 'things', 'screen', 'nobody', 'will', 'care', 'school', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'never', 'truly', 'comfortable', 'being', 'true', 'book', 'managed', 'finally', 'screw', 'up', 'single', 'element', 'made', 'book', 'character', 'great', 'popular', 'Everyone', 'film', 'save', 'Church', 'Sandman', 'Franco', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'are', 'portrayed', 'self', 'centered', 'jerks', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'Maguire', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'Spiderman', 'mask', 'more', 'three', 'minutes', 'constantly', 'taking', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'secret', 'identity', 'now', 'joke', 'two', 'full', 'fights', 'not', 'even', 'costume', 'construction', 'site', 'front', 'thousands', 'people', 'TV', 'cameras', 'mask', 'Venom', 'who', 'Sandman', 'who', 'is.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'wrong', 'Howard', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'airhead', 'reason', 'Russell', 'Cromwell', 'even', 'be', 'film', 'appallingly', 'retarded', 'scene', 'where', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'father', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'plunge', 'certain', 'death', 'make', 'snappy', 'one', 'liners', 'Instead', 'Harry', 'becoming', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Hobgoblin', 'Raimi', 'become', 'Rocket', 'Racer', 'embarringly', 'ugly', 'scene', 'where', 'only', 'truly', 'evil', 'villain', 'series', 'aka', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'driven', 'actions', 'accident', 'revealed', 'be', 'practicing', 'Catholic', 'Jesus', 'help', 'kill', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Messiah', 'immediately', 'wish', 'Raimi', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'innoculate', 'film', 'negative', 'reviews', 'indulging', 'Anti-Christian', 'bigotry', 'CGI', 'wall', 'wall', 'boring', 'utterly', 'boring', 'Cartoon', 'characters', 'fighting', 'impossible', 'follow', 'fights.The', 'series', 'X', 'men/', 'Superman', 'series', 'did', 'Singer', 'needed', 'can', 'IMMEDIATELY', 'Raimi', 'Maquire', 'Dunst', 'was', 'considered', 'repair', 'needed', 'be', 'rebooted.Great', 'pity']",Spider-Man 3

There are exactly zero scenes in this film that have any trace of plausibility (unlike its less-than-excellent but at least somewhat-explainable predecessors) or have any hint of an explanation given as to how they could be seen as plausible. There are countless moments of sheer idiocy that paint a perfect picture of this film's target audience (80-90 IQ, I'd imagine); however, the ""scientific experiment"" in which Sandman becomes Sandman is easily the most ludicrous. If you can explain to me what possible purpose this ""experiment"" originally had, what they were trying to accomplish, and why they simply didn't care that additional weight had been added to the sand (needless-to-say, no real scientist would say ""it's probably a bird,"" or whatever the hell he said...they'd probably care), then I'll be forever in your debt. Another great example of the lack of quality scriptwriting that went into the picture is the scene in which Tobey suddenly becomes a ""babe magnet,"" for lack of a better phrase; it rivals the most ridiculous scenes I've ever seen in any film, period; unfortunately, as he looks almost exactly like Trinity from ""The Matrix"" (judge for yourself...her image popped into mind more than once while watching this scene), it's very, very difficult to believe that any rational, straight woman would ever be instinctually attracted to such a ""man."" It's at this very moment that the film goes from being simply ""ridiculous"" to ""self-parody."" The dialogue throughout the picture makes clearly evident, if the aforementioned scenes don't, that the script was written in a matter of hours, and clearly designed to attract ""the masses."" However, there is little excuse for such poor effort, and I'm completely stunned by the level of unintelligence that I unfortunately witnessed while ""watching"" (struggling to sit through) this ""picture."" The first two pictures certainly weren't as excellent as ""critics"" decided they were (generally speaking...with Ebert's four-star review of the second picture being the most baseless and biased), but at least it was evident that at least someone edited the script before shooting the ""films.""In any event...this picture should never have been green-lit with such a script, and in the event of a ""Spiderman 4"" (which I can only pray won't be made...but money talks, of course...), I sincerely hope that more effort will be put into this stage, to avoid adding insult to injury.",3,One of the most mindless comic book films ever created...,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2480,"['2.5', 'StarsWell', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'are', 'exactly', 'zero', 'scenes', 'film', 'have', 'trace', 'plausibility', 'less-than-excellent', 'least', 'somewhat-explainable', 'predecessors', 'have', 'hint', 'explanation', 'given', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'plausible', 'are', 'countless', 'moments', 'sheer', 'idiocy', 'paint', 'perfect', 'picture', 'film', 'target', 'audience', '80-90', 'IQ', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'however', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'Sandman', 'Sandman', 'easily', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'can', 'explain', 'what', 'possible', 'purpose', 'experiment', 'originally', 'had', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'why', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'additional', 'weight', 'had', 'been', 'added', 'sand', 'needless-to-say', 'real', 'scientist', 'would', 'say', 'probably', 'bird', 'whatever', 'hell', 'said', ""'d"", 'probably', 'care', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forever', 'debt', 'great', 'example', 'lack', 'quality', 'scriptwriting', 'went', 'picture', 'scene', 'Tobey', 'suddenly', 'babe', 'magnet', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'period', 'unfortunately', 'almost', 'exactly', 'like', 'Trinity', 'Matrix', 'judge', 'yourself', 'image', 'popped', 'mind', 'more', 'once', 'watching', 'scene', 'very', 'very', 'difficult', 'believe', 'rational', 'straight', 'woman', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'instinctually', 'attracted', 'such', 'man', 'very', 'moment', 'film', 'being', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'self-parody', 'dialogue', 'picture', 'clearly', 'evident', 'aforementioned', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'script', 'was', 'written', 'matter', 'hours', 'clearly', 'designed', 'attract', 'masses', 'However', 'little', 'excuse', 'such', 'poor', 'effort', ""'m"", 'completely', 'stunned', 'level', 'unintelligence', 'unfortunately', 'witnessed', 'watching', 'struggling', 'sit', 'picture', 'first', 'two', 'pictures', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'excellent', 'critics', 'decided', 'were', 'generally', 'speaking', 'Ebert', 'four-star', 'review', 'second', 'picture', 'being', 'most', 'baseless', 'biased', 'least', 'was', 'evident', 'least', 'someone', 'edited', 'script', 'shooting', 'films', 'event', 'picture', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'green-lit', 'script', 'event', 'Spiderman', '4', 'can', 'only', 'pray', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'money', 'talks', 'course', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'more', 'effort', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'stage', 'avoid', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury']",Spider-Man 3
649960,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPFH,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[106, 143]","""Spiderman 3"" falls victim to a common ailment of most hero movie franchises. If one villain is good, then two would be great, But if two would be great, then three would be fabulous! (Think the horribly overstuffed ""Batman & Robin"" or ""Superman III."") So while I really enjoyed the third installment in the Spiderman series, I kept getting the feeling that I was watching what would have made two great movies crammed into a single average one.For instance, is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman necessary to this film? Granted he lets the dark Spiderman loose for a bit, but both The New Goblin and Venom get their turns as bad spidey bait. It also sucked points away by convoluting plot points and weakly re-writing the circumstances of Uncle Ben's death. The movie's pace would have significantly improved had the conflicts been more limited to Peter, Harry and Eddie Brock. Since the main focus was on Harry and Peter's attention to Mary Jane and Eddie's anger at losing his girl to Peter, it would have tightened the story if Sandman had been saved for later.The conflict also gives Tobey Maguire a chance to goof around with the role. His moments as Dark Peter Parker are some of the film's funniest (following J.K. Simmons as J. Johah Jameson), and his antics in the jazz-cafe were the ones that got the big reaction in the theater I was watching this. I also found it amusing that when Peter gets bad his bangs suddenly fall down his face and he looks like he should be joining a Fall Out Boy/My Chemical Romance concert.What all this crowding does accomplish is a shortchanging of character development. How Sandman and Venom form an alliance in zero seconds flat is whiplash inducing as is the almost total lack of development in Topher Grace's character. He's brought in so quickly you wonder how he became so angry so fast in his evolution into Venom. Aunt May is barely in the plot at all; Peter's apartment manager and daughter get more significance. Harry/The New Goblin plays a major role throughout, but his character stages are done so abruptly that, once again, you end up wondering what the heck just happened here.This probably won't distract you from all the action, and Sam Raimi again delivers the goods.

Lobascio,"[2, 4]","As the film opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), finds life finally going his way His relationship with girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is so great, in fact, that he's ready to ask her to marry him. And as superhero,--Spider-Man, he is much beloved by the city of New York, for all of his daring doo...But the celebration is short-lived. The webslinger soon finds himself facing multiple threats...Former pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) still blames Spidey for the death of his father and wants revenge; After a small meteor falls to earth, an alien organism attaches itself to his costume enhancing his powers, transforming our hero as well bringing out the vengeful side of his personality. Under the influence of the suit, Peter becomes overconfident and starts to neglect the people who care for him most. Forced to choose between the seductive power and the compassionate hero he used to be, Peter must overcome his personal demons in order to defeat two new enemies: Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace)As the final credits for the film began to roll--I couldn't help but think of last summer's Superman Returns...While I think Spider-Man 3 is a better movie overall, I think some of the same issues that hampered SR, also plagued this film...Specifics in a bit..Under Sam Raimi's direction, Spidey 3 offers us a lot to like: Some of the best battle scenes of the series. My favorite though, is by far, the face off between Harry as the new Goblin, and Peter. Wow! Great Stuff. Speaking of Harry, I thought Franco had the film's best performance, coming a long way since the first film. More visual high points include the birth of the Sandman and most of the Venom stuff... After 3 films, Maguire is quite comfy in the dual role, but obviously had a lot of fun exploring his dark side. Dunst spends most of her arc either bemoaning her character's stalled career or her relationship with a superhero...As to those issues: The screenplay by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2) has so much going on in it, that the film seems to go all over the place at times-juggling one too many plot lines really affecting the narrative. There's also a scene between Harry and his butler that left me saying--that should have happened in the the second film... With all of this going on--some of the characters really get short-changed. I love Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson--but both really don't have that much screen time here--I also wanted to find out more about Grace's Eddie Brock and Church's Sandman-who formed a villain alliance after a 30 second encounter in an alley...Since there are so many arcs to service the editing of the film is quite uneven--rushed in some spots, yet somehow long in others. Some of this stuff could have waited until the next installment...The final battle is a spectacular piece of filmmaking--That said, the emotional impact of the ending is lost in a sea of predictability.I liked Spidey 3 a lot--it's a must see--all of those ""issues"" aside...But in my opinion, the sequel would have been better served by cutting the fat.",4,Web Sight,1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,3142,"['film', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'life', 'finally', 'going', 'way', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'so', 'great', 'fact', 'ready', 'ask', 'marry', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'much', 'beloved', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'daring', 'doo', 'celebration', 'short-lived', 'webslinger', 'soon', 'facing', 'multiple', 'threats', 'Former', 'pal', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'still', 'Spidey', 'death', 'father', 'revenge', 'small', 'meteor', 'earth', 'alien', 'organism', 'costume', 'enhancing', 'powers', 'transforming', 'hero', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'out', 'vengeful', 'side', 'personality', 'influence', 'suit', 'Peter', 'overconfident', 'neglect', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'most', 'Forced', 'choose', 'seductive', 'power', 'compassionate', 'hero', 'used', 'be', 'Peter', 'must', 'overcome', 'personal', 'demons', 'order', 'defeat', 'two', 'new', 'enemies', 'Sandman', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Venom', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'final', 'credits', 'film', 'began', 'roll', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'last', 'summer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'think', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'better', 'movie', 'overall', 'think', 'same', 'issues', 'hampered', 'SR', 'also', 'plagued', 'film', 'Specifics', 'bit..Under', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'direction', 'Spidey', '3', 'offers', 'lot', 'like', 'best', 'battle', 'scenes', 'series', 'My', 'favorite', 'far', 'face', 'Harry', 'new', 'Goblin', 'Peter', 'Wow', 'Great', 'Stuff', 'Speaking', 'Harry', 'thought', 'Franco', 'had', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'coming', 'long', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'More', 'visual', 'high', 'points', 'include', 'birth', 'Sandman', 'most', 'Venom', 'stuff', '3', 'films', 'Maguire', 'quite', 'comfy', 'dual', 'role', 'obviously', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'exploring', 'dark', 'side', 'Dunst', 'most', 'arc', 'bemoaning', 'character', 'stalled', 'career', 'relationship', 'superhero', 'issues', 'screenplay', 'Raimi', 'brother', 'Ivan', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'go', 'place', 'times-juggling', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'lines', 'really', 'affecting', 'narrative', 'also', 'scene', 'Harry', 'butler', 'left', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'second', 'film', 'going', 'characters', 'really', 'get', 'short-changed', 'love', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'also', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Grace', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Church', 'Sandman-who', 'formed', 'villain', 'alliance', '30', 'second', 'encounter', 'alley', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'arcs', 'service', 'editing', 'film', 'quite', 'uneven', 'rushed', 'spots', 'yet', 'somehow', 'long', 'others', 'stuff', 'could', 'have', 'waited', 'next', 'installment', 'final', 'battle', 'spectacular', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'said', 'emotional', 'impact', 'ending', 'lost', 'sea', 'predictability.I', 'liked', 'Spidey', '3', 'lot', 'must', 'see', 'issues', 'aside', 'opinion', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'cutting', 'fat']",Spider-Man 3

It just added to the plot and twisted it even more. Above all, it made Peter seem 'human', instead of the do no wrong image that he had in the first two movies. In this movie, there are several things going on at the same time: the avenging of Harry's father's death, the avenging of Peter's uncle's death through Spider-Man, a relationship between Peter and Mary Jane going sour, a competition between Peter and another Daily Bugle photographer, and an aunt who's teaching Peter that revenge is not the answer to any problem. In the end, the killer of Peter's uncle is remorseful, and Peter accepts him. Also, Harry is told that his father's death wasn't at the hands of Spider-Man, and ironically he dies the same way his father did, but not before forgiving Peter and assisting him to bring down the villains. As usual, the effects are superb, the action plentiful (easily the most action out of the three movies), and the emotion is heartfelt.

649964,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JPFH,Tom Benton,"[1, 2]","*Possible spoilers within.*Though Bryan Singer's ""X-Men,"" released in 2000, revived audiences' dormant interest in the superhero film, it was Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man,"" released two years later, that renewed their fascination with it.  ""Spider-Man"" was exactly the kind of superhero film moviegoers wanted to see: lighthearted, humorous, over-the-top but still grounded in reality, action-packed but still clever.  After the huge box office success of that film, a sequel was inevitable, and so in 2004 we received ""Spider-Man 2"" like a gift from on high.  At the time of its release, ""Spider-Man 2"" was hailed as ""the greatest superhero movie ever made"" and, more than that, an excellent movie.  Needless to say it was a hard act to follow.  Yet follow it they did, and now, three years later, we have the very highly-anticipated ""Spider-Man 3,"" again directed by Sam Raimi.""Spider-Man 3,"" which makes Raimi the first director ever to direct every movie in a superhero film trilogy, is also the first of the ""Spider-Man"" series to feature more than one villain.  Raimi and star Tobey Maguire pushed for the inclusion of the Sandman, portrayed by ""Sideways""'s Thomas Haden Church, but the villain for which audiences gave ""Spider-Man 3"" the biggest box-office opening of all time is Venom, played by Topher Grace of ""That '70s Show.""  (Grace actually left the show solely to perform in this film.)  Among fans, Venom is by far the most popular of the ""Spider-Man"" villains, despite the fact that he is relatively knew to the comics (the character was introduced in the mid-80s).  He's the result of the combination of sleazy photographer Eddie Brock and a parasitic alien symbiote, which leeches on to Brock and brings out the aggression in him (although not before it's leeched on to Spider-Man himself, the central point of the film).Despite the fan interest in the character, however, Raimi was originally dead-set against included him in the film, claiming that the character's ""lack of humanity"" put him off.  It was producer Avi Arad who suggested Raimi take a closer look at the character (""I told him, 'You're not giving the fans what they want,'"" she says), and take a closer look at he did.  Thus Venom makes his big-screen debut in ""Spider-Man 3"" - for roughly 15 minutes.  At the end of the movie.  The good news is that for whatever time he's on-screen, Venom is the center of attention, a deliciously animalistic and vicious creature whose inhumanity and violent tendencies are what make him so fascinating.  He's everything the fans have been waiting so long for.  The bad news is that he's in the film for 15 minutes - before he, the symbiote, and Eddie Brock, the whole lot of 'em, are killed.But don't blame Spidey for the untimely death of Spider-Man's greatest foe: blame the writers.  The biggest problem with ""Spidey 3"" isn't that there's too many problems - it's that there's one problem big enough to nearly destroy the movie.  That problem is the script, authored by Alvin Sargent (who also wrote ""Spidey 2"") as well as Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, who also co-wrote Sam's cult legend ""Army of Darkness.""  Whether it's because there are too many writers (Sargent did pretty well solo on ""Spidey"" no. 2!) or because the film was just rushed (though you'd think three years would be enough time), or just because Sam Raimi had a hard time deciding which villain(s) to use, the script is a mess.  The storyline involving Sandman and Venom feels lopsided, and the story structure feels like it's strewn all over the place.  To top it all off, there's some absurd dialogue, ranging from an enraged Harry Osborne's ""I protected you in high school, now I'm gonna kick your ass!"" to a news anchor's cliched ""Oh, the brutality!""Aside from the film's lame duck of a screenplay, ""Spider-Man 3"" has a lot going for it.  For one thing, Tobey Maguire gives one of his sweetest, most likable performances ever, and that's saying something for a consistently-amiable actor like Maguire.  James Franco gives a surprisingly winning performance considering his character's pigheadedness.  And while the rest of the regular cast is as fine as ever, it's the newcomers who steal the show.  For example, Bryce Dallas Howard (of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water""), who plays Gwen Stacey (apparently related to her comic book counterpart in name and appearance only), is charming.  Again the script's lopsidedness comes into play, as Howard doesn't have nearly enough screen time.  Thomas Haden Church's Sandman is a sufficiently sympathetic character, but it's Topher Grace who really shines.  Grace's performance is perfectly sleazy and also delectably insidious.  He makes a surprisingly frightening Venom as well, considering his reputation as the thin wisecracker from ""That 70's Show.""  And, for the many fans of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, Bruce Campbell makes an obligatory (and, naturally, hilarious) cameo as a French maitre d'.Raimi himself takes a darker approach to directing the film than he did with the first two.  That's perfect, though, because the storylines demand that he do so.  Unfortunately, his approach is also a little too dreary.  Raimi seems to have lost some of his zest.  That's a pity, because his obvious enthusiasm was a big part of what made ""Spidey 1"" and ""2"" so much fun.  Nevertheless, his talent as a director is still quite clear through many emotional performances and neat camera tricks, as well at least one very memorable and moody panorama.Speaking of visuals, the film's special effects deserve some mention.  One of the things the film is not lacking in is spectacular fight scenes, and, since ""Spider-Man 3"" has the costliest budget in U.S. movie history, those scenes are pretty neat.  Unequestionably the highlight of the effects-laden sequences is the Sandman, whose ominous appearance becomes awe-inspiring through some stellar CGI.  Unfortunately, the great amount of this stellar CGI and the lesser amount of Mr. Thomas Hayden Church reduces the character to a simple visual showcase through most of his time on-screen.  Fortunately, though, one of the few good aspects of the script is a perfect balance between scenes of action and scenes of drama.One last thing of note: Christopher Young's score.  Young is taking over for the brilliant Danny Elfman, who declined to work on ""Spidey 3,"" citing ""creative differences"" with Mr. Raimi.  All of Elfman's really memorable score has been reused in the film, so he's not as sorely missed as was when he left the 90's ""Batman"" series with Tim Burton.  However, while Elfman would undoubtedly have crafted some very memorable music for the Sandman and particularly for Venom, Young's themes, like the rest of his score, are instantly forgettable and just plain uninspired.In the end, how much you enjoy ""Spider-Man 3"" depends on how much its faults bother you, and whether or not you can accept it for what it is.  What it is is a great superhero movie and a worthy installment in the ""Spidey"" saga, despite a few nearly fatal flaws.  And while comic book aficionados will have a bone or two to pick with Mr. Raimi, any moviegoer who enjoyed the previous adventures of Spider-Man should find ""Spider-Man 3"" a dandy way to entertain themselves for a little over two hours.  Though it may get some spider-senses tingling, ""Spider-Man 4"" is planned for a 2009 release, and regardless of whether you enjoyed ""Spidey 3,"" there's little doubt that audiences will still web-sling their way to see more adventures of the amazing Spider-Man.",4,The web too tangled,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,7564,"['*Possible', 'spoilers', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'released',

649965,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B00005JPFH,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","After two sucesfull and critically acclaimed movies,Spiderman returns to the big screen in 2007 in his third movie.While most fans knew it wouldn't turn out to be the best of the serie they still expected a good Spiderman movie.This third film in the franchise is certainly entertaining and visualy impressive and even funny at parts some could say.Yet critics said,and i have to agree with them that the decision to have three villains in the movie was probably thw worst thing to do.Those movie producers will say: ""the more villains,the better"",and Spiderman 3 proves that its not necessarily true.That confused a few,three bad guys in the same movie and battling Spiderman at the same time can indeed be comfusing but still the third film in the series remains a good superhero movie.In my opinion there are way too many superhero movies nowadays as it seems that movie studios have learned how great profits comic superhero based movies could generate.X-Men,Fantastic Four make and countless others made their beggenings on the big screen recently while other older superheroes make a comeback such as Batman,Superman and others.Spiderman managed so far to deliver a great superhero experience troughout all the trilogy and to distinguish from others.The first two films have been great translations of the famous Marvel comic to the big screen,filled with drama,action and with romance as well.Comes this third filled with action and villains,it clearly ain't the best of the three as i expected but it was still a good experience at the theater for me.I this third movie the storyline is kind of wicked because of the three villains but remains pretty solid overral.Peter still has feelings for Mary Jane and turns to another girl.His uncle Ben's death is further explored in this film and the killer's identity as well.Add to that Peter faces dark times with the dark Spidey suit and three villains after him and tha's the movie in short.There probably won't be as fourth Spidey because the actors wanted to move on to do other movies and that is probably packed this one with villains and all that.Also the movie relies on many great special effects maybe too much.Spiderman 3 is different from the other films in the franchise and that is great as sometimes sequels are too much like the original and they have no creativity,or they go too far and completly loose it.Spiderman 3 does not make those mistakes it still has some elements of the original but with a big touch of creativity.I tought Peter Parker discovering the dark suit was very interresting as it gave him this kind of dark personna nobody would have expect that too happen.His scenes in the cafe as dark spiderman are quite funny,i think that got a good laugh out of pretty much everyone!And i must admit the dark suit is pretty cool.The major mistake they did in the proccess of creating this third Spiderman is that they putted three vilains in it,reminescent of the Batman and Robin movie from the 1990s where the heroes had to fight many villains at the same time,as i recall that did not turn out to be a succesfull experiment.Venom would have been enough to make a movie with alone,and he's probably the coolest villain in Spiderman history.The Green Goblin only appeared in the movie for less than 10 minutes,he wouldn't have been needed.Sandman has quite an interresting story and all but was he really necessary?Besides that flaw its a really good movie,every movie has some flaws.To conclude i must say that this movie was nearly two movies i one actually.Had they put the Sandman's parts for another movie and added more scrip based on it it could have turned great.Even with that i have to say i was really satisfied with this third movie.There was plenty of action and the other elements that made the others so good and succesfull.I must say Topher Grace from cult show,""That 70s Show"" does a great job as Venom and i didn't recognize him at all until i was told it was him!Thomas Haiden Church is made a brilliant appearance as the Sandman and the rest of the cast is great as well.I definatly recommend it,even if you haven't seen Spiderman 1 and 2 you will probably have a good time watching this.4 stars,recommended!",4,"""Three Villains Is Too Much!""",1203465600,"02 20,

649969,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JPFH,trebe,"[1, 3]","Spider-Man 3 (2007) could be director Sam Raimi's final contribution to the Spider-Man saga.  The film introduces key characters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard),  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), and most significantly, the alien symbiote, that later creates Venom.  Small time crook, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), is transformed into The Sandman, and is also revealed as the actual killer of Uncle Ben.  If that were not enough, Harry Osborn (James Franco) makes a not unexpected appearance, as the new Goblin.  There is a lot going on, but even with some meandering subplots, things seem to hold together well enough.While Raimi's films can certainly be appreciated for the technical achievement of successfully bringing Spider-Man to life, from the very beginning I have not been comfortable with the universe created by these films, because it strays rather far from the original comics.  In this regard, the writers did not get many things right, most importantly capturing the essence of Peter Parker.  Maguire's Parker is an incompetent goof, which is absolutely not what the Parker from the comics ever was.  The mischaracterization is attributable to a combination of the script, and Maguire's personality.  Although he has trouble keeping his mask on, Maguire is pretty good as Spider-Man.Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, who plays Mary Jane Watson as written.  Which would be great, except the writers mischaracterized her as well.  The same can be said for characters like, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacey, and Betty Brant.  One bright spot has been the superb casting of the villains.  William Dafoe was excellent but was victim of a horrible costume.  Alfred Molina was absolutely brilliant as Doc Ock.  Thomas Hayden Church, and Topher Grace, and both give very good performances, and James Franco makes a stirring and impressive transition, into the new Goblin.  Regarded as disposable, Raimi continues the rather unfortunate trend of killing off his villains.Under the effects of the symbiote, Parker becomes an obnoxious, self absorbed jerk.  He treats his neighbor Usula (Mageina Tovah) like a dog, uses Gwen to degrade MJ, slugs MJ, blows off Harry face and almost kills him, and never even looks back.  Peter is a hard guy to have any empathy for.Venom's appearance is brief, but Topher Grace makes the most of out of what little time he has.  The special effects for Venom are outstanding.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for the lumbering giant Sandman, who looks like a pumped up escapee from a Stephen Sommers' Mummy flick.  In over forty years in comics, Spider-Man has never had problems with keeping on his mask, the way Maguire does in every film.  It is outrageous how many people have seen Spidey without his mask.As in life, Uncle Ben's spirit, shows only concern for Peter, not for vengeance, or even for his wife May.  The new Goblin teaming with Spidey is a really nice touch, with a fate for Harry Osborn that is sort of similar to the comic.  Likely reflecting last minute script revisions, the film has a rather untidy ending, with Peter forgiving Marko for killing Uncle Ben, and the symbiote's messy exit with Topher Grace.Spider-Man 3 looks fantastic in blu-ray, a film that takes full advantage of the benefits of the format, with lots of cool bonus materials.  The commentary track featuring Raimi, and assorted members of the cast is very freeform, with Thomas Hayden Church, providing some witty comments.  Surprisingly, Raimi's contributions are rather minimal.Spider-Man 3 concludes with no clear future direction.  As of January 2010, Sony Pictures has shelved plans for Spider-Man 4, after Raimi pulled out of the project.  A rumored complete reboot of Spider-Man, similar to Batman Begins, may be direction the series will take.  If this is the end of Raimi's affiliation with Spider-Man, it comes at a good time.  The foundation of Raimi's Spider-Man universe was off from the start, and it would have taken a fantastic story to rehab and reinvigorate the series.  Maguire and Dust are now a little old to still be in college, and the rocky relationship between Peter and MJ, took some major hits in Spider-Man 3.  Hopefully Spider-Man will continue in feature films, in a form closer to the original characterization by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.",3,. . . the time is right for a reboot,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,4321,"['Spider-Man', '3', '2007', 'could', 'be', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'final', 'contribution', 'Spider-Man', 'saga', 'film', 'introduces', 'key', 'characters', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'most', 'significantly', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'later', 'Venom', 'Small', 'time', 'crook', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'transformed', 'Sandman', 'also', 'revealed', 'actual', 'killer', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'not', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'new', 'Goblin', 'lot', 'going', 'even', 'meandering', 'subplots', 'things', 'seem', 'hold', 'together', 'well', 'Raimi', 'films', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'appreciated', 'technical', 'achievement', 'successfully', 'bringing', 'Spider-Man', 'life', 'very', 'beginning', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'comfortable', 'universe', 'created', 'films', 'rather', 'far', 'original', 'comics', 'regard', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'most', 'importantly', 'capturing', 'essence', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Maguire', 'Parker', 'incompetent', 'goof', 'absolutely', 'not', 'what', 'Parker', 'comics', 'ever', 'was', 'mischaracterization', 'attributable', 'combination', 'script', 'Maguire', 'personality', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'mask', 'Maguire', 'pretty', 'good', 'Spider-Man.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'good', 'actress', 'who', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'written', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'writers', 'mischaracterized', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'characters', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'Betty', 'Brant', 'One', 'bright', 'spot', 'been', 'superb', 'casting', 'villains', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'victim', 'horrible', 'costume', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'give', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'James', 'Franco', 'stirring', 'impressive', 'transition', 'new', 'Goblin', 'Regarded', 'disposable', 'Raimi', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'trend', 'killing', 'off', 'villains.Under', 'effects', 'symbiote', 'Parker', 'obnoxious', 'self', 'absorbed', 'jerk', 'neighbor', 'Usula', 'Mageina', 'Tovah', 'dog', 'Gwen', 'degrade', 'MJ', 'slugs', 'MJ', 'Harry', 'face', 'almost', 'kills', 'never', 'even', 'back', 'Peter', 'hard', 'guy', 'have', 'empathy', 'for.Venom', 'appearance', 'brief', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'most', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'Venom', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'lumbering', 'giant', 'Sandman', 'who', 'pumped', 'up', 'escapee', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'Mummy', 'flick', 'forty', 'years', 'comics', 'Spider-Man', 'never', 'had', 'problems', 'keeping', 'mask', 'way', 'Maguire', 'film', 'outrageous', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'Spidey', 'mask.As', 'life', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'spirit', 'only', 'concern', 'Peter', 'not', 'vengeance', 'even', 'wife', 'May', 'new', 'Goblin', 'teaming', 'Spidey', 'really', 'nice', 'touch', 'fate', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'sort', 'similar', 'comic', 'Likely', 'reflecting', 'last', 'minute', 'script', 'revisions', 'film', 'rather', 'untidy', 'ending', 'Peter', 'forgiving', 'Marko', 'killing', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'symbiote', 'messy', 'exit', 'Topher', 'Grace.Spider-Man', '3', 'fantastic', 'blu-ray', 'film', 'full', 'advantage', 'benefits', 'format', 'lots', 'cool', 'bonus', 'materials', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'Raimi', 'assorted', 'members', 'cast', 'very', 'freeform', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'providing', 'witty', 'comments', 'Surprisingly', 'Raimi', 'contributions', 'are', 'rather', 'minimal.Spider-Man', '3', 'concludes', 'clear', 'future', 'direction', 'January', '2010', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'shelved', 'plans', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'Raimi', 'pulled', 'project', 'rumored', 'complete', 'reboot', 'Spider-Man', 'similar', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'may', 'be', 'direction', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'end', 'Raimi', 'affiliation', 'Spider-Man', 'good', 'time', 'foundation', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'universe', 'was', 'off', 'start', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'fantastic', 'story', 'rehab', 'reinvigorate', 'series', 'Maguire', 'Dust', 'are', 'now', 'little', 'old', 'still', 'be', 'college', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'MJ', 'took', 'major', 'hits', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Hopefully', 'Spider-Man', 'will', 'continue', 'feature', 'films', 'form', 'closer', 'original', 'characterization', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko']",Spider-Man 3
649970,A1GMH7UI999M4P,B00005JPFH,"Trevis ""xyrodon""","[4, 7]","Well I must say I feel like a REAL geek writing a review for a movie that just came out today.  I cannot believe what Marvel is doing to their franchises.  I remember Marvel declared bankruptcy back in the late 1990's because Saban screwed them over.  Well they bounced back with brilliant some movies and new TV shows.  Now, their inevitable financial problems are a grave they dug for themselves.  With recent movie failures such as X-Men 3 (why did people like that movie?), Electra and Fantastic Four (Jessica Alba? Common, Marvel) you know where they're heading.  They have failed to produce a PROPER DVD release of extraordinary television series such as ""X-Men: Evolution"" and the 1990's Spiderman series.  Instead, we are being sold these lame DVD ""volume releases"" instead of season releases.  Marvel, try and learn something from DC.WARNING for some minor spoilers:I'll start with the inconsistencies from the previous movies.  Firstly, wasn't Eddie Brock in the first movie?  The answer is yes, he was (not physically though but he was mentioned being unable to capture a photo of Spider-man by Robby).  So, why was he just recently hired to work for the Daily Bugle?  Also, Spider-man was clearly having trouble with his powers in the 2nd instalment.  He was seen having trouble scaling walls or using his spider-web.  None of these issues are even mentioned in the 3rd film.  I saw that as an obvious opening for Kraven the Hunter and possibly the Neogenic Nightmare story from the very successful cartoon in the 1990's.  So much for that plan.Now for the inconsistencies of the third movie.  Harry gets a type of amnesia after his fall.  If he lost his short-term memory, why doesn't he know that he's rich?  Harry's butler knew that his father was killed by his own device, yet he doesn't tell Harry, even though Harry has obviously been suffering from this psychological torment.  The comet falling from he sky with the Venom symbiont seemed like a very forced entry for an amazing villain.  Why couldn't they incorporate the fact the Jameson's son (who is an astronaut that returned successfully from space in the second movie) brought Venom with him on the shuttle they returned in?Speaking of Venom, how the hell does Spider-man realize that loud noises will cause the symbiont to leave its host?  He just randomly visits some church that conveniently had a large bell.  Why did he decide to go there to get rid of the Venom suit?  How did he ever consider that loud noises hurt the symbiont?  Eddie Brock is conveniently at the church while Spider-man is trying to remove Venom.  Marko conveniently sneaks into some top secret physics test site with ease just to get converted into Sandman.  Everything is so conveniently placed.  Another strange point, Mary Jane leaves Jameson's son for Parker at the end of the 2nd movie.  Jameson's not even a little upset at Peter Parker?  Any father would be.  The last fight scene, with the ""Stop us if you can"" sign and Mary Jane in danger of falling (yet again) was pretty lame.I did like Peter's personality change; some parts of it were just hilarious.  The actions scenes were staggering.  Venom falling onto Eddie Brock in the church was really my favourite scene as it was identical to the cartoon series.

649972,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPFH,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Much-awaited second sequel of ""Spider-man"" offers a lot of thrilling action sequences (as you expected), but sadly lacks a coherent story with one (or two, or maybe more) too many characters who should have been kept for another installment of the series. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching ""Spider-man 3."" Yes, I did, but at the same time while watching the film, I was thinking: ""Did Sam Raimi really need two villains to make this film?"" Actually I don't think ""Sandman"" is really a villain, but anyway, Spider-man has to fight this formidable enemy before fighting another one, more vicious and powerful Venom.The cast is all excellent, and the action scenes are exciting. The CGI-created Sandman (played by perfect Thomas Haden Church) is simply great, but I still don't know why some characters should re-appear here in this way. It is not a bad idea to show the tragic background story of Sandman and his family, or the estranged relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but the story of vengeful Harry Osborn and short-term memory loss puzzled me, which goes nowhere after all.Add to them, there are Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, excellent too), Peter's new friend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father Captain Stacy (James Cromwell). Not only Aunt Parker re-appears to give kindly advice to Peter, but Uncle Parker is also seen again in the flashback scenes, and Bruce Campbell (always welcome) appears again. You need to be a skillful storyteller to handle all these characters, but even Christopher Nolan would find it hard to wrap up all these threads within 140 minute. And don't forget the Venom character which appears too late in the film and lovely Ursula who is totally wasted.""Spider-man 3"" has great special effects and great cast, with which they could have made two ""Spider-man"" films.",4,(3.5 STARS) Excellent Cast and Special Effects and ...

649973,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B00005JPFH,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[18, 31]","By ""most disappointing movie of the summer,"" let me clarify that ""Spider-Man III"" was not the worst movie of the summer by any means, but in terms of the quality we were expecting compared to the quality we received, it definitely is at the bottom of the list.Well, I saw it, partly because my ex-girlfriend had some free tickets and partly because I had to pass by the theater anyways because it was on the way to the library.  And I can say that ""Spider-Man III"" instantly made the list of one of the year's most disappointing films.  The film is so mediocre that it will immediately make you want to watch ""Spider-Man I and II: They Were Better"" over again, just to regain your pleasant memories of the franchise.Well, I guess there's some fun to be had with ""Spider-Man III,"" but it's a pale shadow of what's come before.  What's wrong with the film?  The first problem is that it tries to cram way too much into its 140-minute running time.  Not only is Spider-Man fighting two villains to begin with, he's also having to deal with an evil alien substance (which came from God knows where) that briefly turns him evil.  Then, he gets this substance off only for it to possess the character of a rival photographer.  So Spider-Man is fighting three villains, in addition to having to deal with a surprisingly whiny Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, looking as weepy and helpless as ever).  With all these subplots going on, none of them ever quite gains momentum, and some simply stop in mid-sentence.The plotting alone would have sunk the film to a good degree, but there is a lot of other awful stuff happening.  First, there's the acting.  As mentioned earlier, Dunst is little more than a screentime eater.  Tobey Maguire is good as the normal Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but is jaw-droppingly godawful as their evil alter ego.  He reminded me of Hayden Christiansen in ""Attack of the Clones"" more than a terrifying menace.  Hayden Church and Franco are OK as Sandman and Goblin (respectively), but Topher Grace as Venom gives one of the worst performances in a comic book film this decade.  He plays Venom with all the cheesy menace of a Fantastic Four villain, and his appearance immediately took me out of the film.Then there's tonal problems.  Parts of the movie are as campy as anything in ""Batman and Robin,"" (especially the increasingly awful one-liners) while others are similar in tone to a soap opera, making for a bizarre contrast that never fits together.  Perhaps most irritatingly, there are serious gaps in logic.  Why is Sandman not shocked at all that he's suddenly turned into a Sandman?  Since when did Harry Osbourne's butler become a genius?  Why can Sandman withstand the pummeling of a speeding train but not two small rockets?  Doesn't Harry forgive someone awfully fast that blew half his face off?  Doesn't Sandman change his mind about Spider-Man awfully quickly?  And Mary Jane...I'm going to stop here, to try to not give away too much.  This is definitely a major disappointment, on the level of ""X3.""  Its studio is obviously panicky over its financial performance, as it was quick to release polls that showed how much people ""liked the film.""  They're covering up something, as I have yet to meet anyone that has said anything more positive about it other than, ""Well, it wasn't as good as the first two, but it still entertained me.""  So, if you feel you must see it, beware to lower your expectations beforehand.  Otherwise, you face crushing disappointment.",2,Most disappointing movie in a summer full of them,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,3490,"['most', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'summer', 'let', 'clarify', 'Spider-Man', 'III', 'was', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'summer', 'means', 'terms', 'quality', 'were', 'expecting', 'compared', 'quality', 'received', 'definitely', 'bottom', 'list.Well', 'saw', 'partly', 'ex-girlfriend', 'had', 'free', 'tickets', 'partly', 'had', 'pass', 'theater', 'was', 'way', 'library', 'can', 'say', 'Spider-Man', 'III', 'instantly', 'made', 'list', 'one', 'year', 'most', 'disappointing', 'films', 'film', 'so', 'mediocre', 'will', 'immediately', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'Spider-Man', 'II', 'Were', 'Better', 'again', 'just', 'regain', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'franchise.Well', 'guess', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'Spider-Man', 'III', 'pale', 'shadow', 'what', 'come', 'before', 'What', 'wrong', 'film', 'first', 'problem', 'cram', 'way', 'too', 'much', '140-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'Spider-Man', 'fighting', 'two', 'villains', 'begin', 'also', 'having', 'deal', 'evil', 'alien', 'substance', 'came', 'God', 'where', 'briefly', 'evil', 'Then', 'substance', 'only', 'possess', 'character', 'rival', 'photographer', 'Spider-Man', 'fighting', 'three', 'villains', 'addition', 'having', 'deal', 'surprisingly', 'whiny', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'looking', 'weepy', 'helpless', 'ever', 'subplots', 'going', 'none', 'ever', 'quite', 'gains', 'momentum', 'simply', 'stop', 'mid-sentence.The', 'plotting', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'sunk', 'film', 'good', 'degree', 'lot', 'other', 'awful', 'stuff', 'happening', 'First', 'acting', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Dunst', 'little', 'more', 'screentime', 'eater', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'good', 'normal', 'Spider-Man/Peter', 'Parker', 'jaw-droppingly', 'godawful', 'evil', 'alter', 'ego', 'reminded', 'Hayden', 'Christiansen', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'more', 'terrifying', 'menace', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Franco', 'are', 'OK', 'Sandman', 'Goblin', 'respectively', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Venom', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'decade', 'Venom', 'cheesy', 'menace', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'villain', 'appearance', 'immediately', 'took', 'film.Then', 'tonal', 'problems', 'Parts', 'movie', 'are', 'as', 'campy', 'anything', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'especially', 'increasingly', 'awful', 'one-liners', 'others', 'are', 'similar', 'tone', 'soap', 'opera', 'making', 'bizarre', 'contrast', 'never', 'together', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'irritatingly', 'are', 'serious', 'gaps', 'logic', 'Why', 'Sandman', 'not', 'shocked', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'Sandman', 'when', 'did', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'butler', 'become', 'genius', 'Why', 'can', 'Sandman', 'withstand', 'pummeling', 'speeding', 'train', 'not', 'two', 'small', 'rockets', ""n't"", 'Harry', 'forgive', 'someone', 'awfully', 'fast', 'blew', 'face', 'off', ""n't"", 'Sandman', 'change', 'mind', 'Spider-Man', 'awfully', 'quickly', 'Mary', 'Jane', ""'m"", 'going', 'stop', 'here', 'try', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'definitely', 'major', 'disappointment', 'level', 'X3', 'studio', 'obviously', 'panicky', 'financial', 'performance', 'was', 'quick', 'release', 'polls', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'liked', 'film', ""'re"", 'covering', 'up', 'something', 'have', 'yet', 'meet', 'anyone', 'said', 'anything', 'more', 'positive', 'other', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'still', 'entertained', 'So', 'feel', 'must', 'see', 'beware', 'lower', 'expectations', 'beforehand', 'Otherwise', 'face', 'crushing', 'disappointment']",Spider-Man 3

I wount point out all the disappointments, but there is a couple worth mentioning.The alter ego Peter Parker was several degrees below being the nerd he usuall plays.  He was a down right creep show strutting and dancing down the street, but the real gem is when they had women look at him like he was a cool stud when doing that.....Ya right.Another beef of mine is that if you're going to make a movie after a comic book, then at least keep the powers somewhat comparable.

649975,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JPFH,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","In SPIDER-MAN 3, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally finding a balance to his life after having gained his spider-like powers a few years ago. His superhero alter-ego Spider-Man is beloved by New York. He is thinking about proposing to longtime girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's also finally learned how to juggle all of his responsibilities between school, work, personal life, and night time crime fighting. Things seem to be going well.That is until Harry Osborn (James Franco) shows up as the New Goblin and tries to kill Peter. Their skirmish ends in a stalemate, but threatens their fragile friendship. Not long after that the police inform Peter and his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that they have tracked down the second man who was involved in the murder of Uncle Ben. The suspect is one Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who during a late night chase falls into a genetic experiment involving sand and mutates into a sand monster. He starts stealing money to provide for his daughter, but is stopped by Spidey. That doesn't sit well with the Sandman and he promises to make things rough for Spider-Man. Things become even more confusing when extraterrestrial goo attaches itself to the Spider suit and turns it black. It gives Peter stronger powers, but also feeds on the darkness of his heart and threatens to overtake and control him.That's a lot going on in one person's life, but that's not all. Mary Jane is dumped on by the press and fired from her first big acting gig. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter's, is also making advances and proves a rival for Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Peter finds himself in a professional photography rivalry with Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). My, my what a tangled web we weave when we first chose Spider-Man to be.Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't a bad film. It's chock full of action, has a lot of character development, a healthy dose of humor, decent acting, and great special effects. In fact, the movie has a lot going for it.Yet, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't as exciting as it should be. There's just too much going on. For instance, usually one major villain in a film is enough. Sometimes you can get by with two, but even then a great deal of character development is lost. SPIDER-MAN 3 has three major villains who all want Spidey out of the way for different reasons. SPIDER-MAN 3 also strays more from the original comics than the first two films did. Turning a comic book into a major motion picture is never easy and Sam Raimi and company did an excellent job at tying everything together. However, in order to get all three villains in and make it all seem semi-plausible, the film strays more than would have been necessary otherwise.

649980,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00005JPFH,V. Berk,"[2, 3]","One of the most anticipated movies of summer 2007 Spider-Man 3 ended as possibly the biggest letdown.  The spirit that had driven the first two films seems to fizzle in a film that just doesn't have a story to work with its substantial budget.The original Spider-Man was a great popcorn film, providing a good live-action adaptation of the character's development while Spider-Man 2 was one of the best superhero features ever put on film.  So why does a sequel involving the same cast and director fail?  I personally believe it was art.  Director Sam Raimi seems so caught up in dazzling the audience with visual spectacles that he loses the heart of the previous films.  The special effects drive this film which is never a good thing.  Human elements are lost, and thus the film fails.  Sorry to say Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider-Man is amusing, but it isn't in the same league as Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow who'll pull in the crowds.  The acting in these films has been good, but no character has ever stood out to the point of wanting to see the movie for the character alone.  J. Jonah Jameson is probably the most enjoyable character of all three films, but of course no one wants to see a movie based on him.Part of the no plot problem is the villain overdose this film suffers from.  How they went from Green Goblin in the first one, Doctor Octopus in the second (my favorite of the web-slinger's villains) to the third with New Goblin, Sandman and Venom.  That's THREE villains, Sandman and Venom not getting enough character development for  the villain to care about them as characters, and you only know New Goblin because, you guessed it, Harry Osborn's been in the last two  films, prepping for his turn to crime...which also comes across as very forced in this movie.  Not to try and spoil the film, but to save viewer groans he has a period where he hits his head and forgets Peter's Spider-Man, but of course remembers later on.  The fact that they used that clich&eacute; is something I can't understand.Moving on to Venom and Sandman, we get a mixed issue.  Neither of these characters gets the screen time required to have the viewer care for them, especially Sandman.  Another problem I have is after they went through all the trouble of bringing realism to Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus, Sandman still looks and dresses exactly as he does in the 60s comic books, but not to discredit him entirely some of the Sandman effects in the film provide great entertainment.  Then we have Venom, who I actually liked the design of, but even if Eddie was fleshed out he must only be Venom for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and knowing how many fans the character has this will come as a major disappointment to say the least.Going back to visuals and specials effects; this film suffers from some of the same problems the original Spider-Man film did, and that's at times the special effects seem to deny reality in many ways.  Characters seem to fly through the air as if they are weightless, and some things just defy physics and logic, no matter how cool it looks on screen.  Spider-Man 2 didn't suffer from this, Doctor Octopus and Spidey seemed to have weight to them when they fought on building tops and fought across The Big Apple.  Sandman turning into a sandstorm and flying around (probably against the wind too) doesn't seem to cut it as real.Overall Spider-Man 3 is a great display of visuals, but not that great of a movie.  Lots of it looks like they had a concept artist sketch some cool images out which Raimi just randomly slapped in their (such as Spider-Man crouching in front of an American flag).  Could've worked as a poster collection, or comic book, just not as one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.Spider-Man 3, I give it a solid 3/5 Stars",3,Spider-Man 3 - All art no plot,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,3831,"['One', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'summer', '2007', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'ended', 'possibly', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'spirit', 'had', 'driven', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'fizzle', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'work', 'substantial', 'budget.The', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'great', 'popcorn', 'film', 'providing', 'good', 'live-action', 'adaptation', 'character', 'development', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'So', 'why', 'sequel', 'involving', 'same', 'cast', 'director', 'fail', 'personally', 'believe', 'was', 'art', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'dazzling', 'audience', 'visual', 'spectacles', 'heart', 'previous', 'films', 'special', 'effects', 'drive', 'film', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'Human', 'elements', 'are', 'lost', 'thus', 'film', 'Sorry', 'say', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'amusing', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'who', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'crowds', 'acting', 'films', 'been', 'good', 'character', 'ever', 'stood', 'out', 'point', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'character', 'alone', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'probably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'three', 'films', 'course', 'one', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'him.Part', 'plot', 'problem', 'villain', 'film', 'suffers', 'How', 'went', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'first', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'second', 'favorite', 'web-slinger', 'villains', 'third', 'New', 'Goblin', 'Sandman', 'Venom', 'THREE', 'villains', 'Sandman', 'Venom', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'villain', 'care', 'about', 'characters', 'only', 'know', 'New', 'Goblin', 'guessed', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'been', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'prepping', 'turn', 'crime', 'also', 'very', 'forced', 'movie', 'Not', 'try', 'spoil', 'film', 'save', 'viewer', 'groans', 'period', 'where', 'head', 'forgets', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'course', 'remembers', 'later', 'fact', 'used', 'clich', 'eacute', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand.Moving', 'Venom', 'Sandman', 'get', 'mixed', 'issue', 'characters', 'screen', 'time', 'required', 'have', 'viewer', 'care', 'especially', 'Sandman', 'problem', 'have', 'went', 'trouble', 'bringing', 'realism', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'Sandman', 'still', 'exactly', '60s', 'comic', 'books', 'not', 'discredit', 'entirely', 'Sandman', 'effects', 'film', 'provide', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Then', 'have', 'Venom', 'who', 'actually', 'liked', 'design', 'even', 'Eddie', 'was', 'fleshed', 'out', 'must', 'only', 'be', 'Venom', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'knowing', 'how', 'many', 'fans', 'character', 'will', 'come', 'major', 'disappointment', 'say', 'least.Going', 'back', 'visuals', 'specials', 'effects', 'film', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'did', 'times', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'deny', 'reality', 'many', 'ways', 'Characters', 'seem', 'fly', 'air', 'are', 'weightless', 'things', 'just', 'defy', 'physics', 'logic', 'matter', 'how', 'cool', 'screen', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'Spidey', 'seemed', 'have', 'weight', 'when', 'fought', 'building', 'tops', 'fought', 'Big', 'Apple', 'Sandman', 'turning', 'sandstorm', 'flying', 'around', 'probably', 'wind', 'too', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cut', 'real.Overall', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'great', 'display', 'visuals', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Lots', 'had', 'concept', 'artist', 'sketch', 'cool', 'images', 'out', 'Raimi', 'just', 'randomly', 'slapped', 'such', 'Spider-Man', 'crouching', 'front', 'American', 'flag', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'poster', 'collection', 'comic', 'book', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'year.Spider-Man', '3', 'give', 'solid', '3/5', 'Stars']",Spider-Man 3

With Spider-Man 3, we have the most disappointing film of 2007. Third time is not always a charm.The basic storyline of Spider-Man 3 has the theme of revenge, and it shoves that theme in our faces more than anything throughout the film. In fact, there are about a half dozen storylines here that all fall flat. There are three new villains in the movie, but none of them are appealing except for Venom (Topher Grace), who doesn't even get much screen time. The other villains are Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and a new version of the Green Goblin (James Franco), who is actually Harry Osborn set on getting revenge on Peter Parker for killing his father. Tobey Maguire returns as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane Watson. While these two are the main stars of Spider-Man 3, they are arguably the worst actors in this film. Not even for a second did I find Dunst's acting convincing, and there are a few scenes in particular where they turn Maguire into an angst-ridden thirty-something, and it is embarrassing to say the very least. Who on Earth read this script and thought it was acceptable?Spider-Man 3 isn't a complete waste of time. It has a couple cool action scenes, and a pretty funny cameo by Bruce Campbell, but in the end, it left me depressed and scratching my head.

And when I say people, I mean even the critics too!I was not hyped or raving about this movie and when I sall this movie in theaters, I loved it. I admit it had it's flaws, the biggest I think is our heroes and villans being bashed against brick walls, thrown through glass windows, etc. and not having any marks on them afterward. That didn't go well with me.I also enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand so I ended up enjoying this movie as well.My advice to you my dear reader: Watch the movie without nit-picking at it and you might enjoy it!",4,What distroyed this movie is the same thing that destroyed X3...

649985,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B00005JPFH,William James Taylor IV,"[32, 46]","Plot in a nutshell: picking up where #2 left off - or maybe a year or so after #2 - it almost looks like Peter Parker's life has turned around for the better. He's excelling in his studies despite being hit with spitballs by lesser intellects (spitballs? come on Sam, even first graders don't do that anymore!), he has the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson by his side, MJ just got the lead role in a Broadway musical, he's thinking of popping the question to her, and New York is loving his alter ego, Spider-Man. After the first showing of MJ's play, they enjoy a moment in a big web, staring at the moon, being romantic and affectionate towards each other, so for our hero, life is finally good.But then the real world brings Pete and MJ's fantasy world crashing down around them. Old friend Harry Osborne is still out to avenge his father, Norman's death, as Norman died as Green Goblin against Spidey - derailed only by a brief memory loss - MJ gets fired from her play due to bad critical response over her singing ability or lack thereof, Peter is so high on the love he's getting from the NY populace that he's not being quite as sensitive to her as he should while she's not giving him the grounding he needs, and Gwen Stacy, a cute classmate of Peter's, seems to have her eye on him. To make things worse, Peter learns that a villain named Flint Marko, now the mutated Sandman, was the real killer of Uncle Ben ala Joker killing Batman's parents in the 1989 Batman film - though Sandman reveals it was an accident - and Peter's spot at the Daily Bugle is now being threatened by a smarmy rival photographer named Eddie Brock Jr. Then Pete's Spider-Man suit gets slimed with black goo that turns out to be an alien symbiont, that augments his powers as well as his aggression. When Peter finally realizes what the black symbiont is doing to him and what it will cost him, he rids himself of it in a church, using the noise of the ringing bell to knock it off - only to have it fall on Brock, who came to the church to pray for Peter's death by God's hand after Peter got him fired for submitting photo-shopped pictures of Spider-Man doing evil. This results in the creation of Venom, who allies himself with Sandman to kill Spider-Man. Who will survive? While it stands head and shoulders above last year's barely broke even super-turkey ""Superman Returns"", a super-heroic dud if there ever was one, Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problems that plagued last year's runaway swashbuckler hit sequel ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest"" in that it over-stuffs itself and loses some of the idiosyncrasies that made the first go around so appealing, and also works against its themes of hubris and forgiveness. The actors do their best, but the material isn't up to par. Maguire appears to be having fun during his ""dark"" montage (the walk down the streets while pointing and pelvic thrusting at women who look at him with disgust obviously meant as a dark flip-side to the lighthearted 'Raindrops' montage of #2), but his fling with his dark side really should have been handled more seriously. Dunst, not the greatest actress by any means, gives her all but the film isn't always complimentary towards her. Franco perhaps fairs better as Harry, the friend haunted by old demons and a father's specter that he cannot shake.Sporting what must be the worst bleach job in cinema history, natural red head Bryce Dalla Howard, almost unrecognizable with ice cream blonde hair, makes the most of the underwritten Gwen Stacy, here given a connection to Eddie Brock that never existed in either the mainstream or Ultimate Marvel universes. But Gwen, the ill-fated lover who was brutally murdered by the Green Goblin back in the 1970s, is little more than a MacGuffin, a plot device to annoy Peter and MJ.Villains... oh there are too many. Thomas Haden Church makes the most of his Sandman character, a complex but fairly low ranking villain who gets the spotlight mostly because director Sam Raimi seems to like him, but he only appears sporadically, and the thing with him as Uncle Ben's accidental killer not only feels forced but undermines the guilt factor that drives Spider-Man.Rail thin Topher Grace is hopelessly miscast as Brock/Venom, playing him as basically a mean, jerky version of his 70s Show character, and he's clearly in over his head because he has neither the physicality or intense range to pull it off. Grace no doubt hoped Venom would do for him what Batman did for Michael Keaton, but it just doesn't work. This is what happens when directors are forced to use characters they clearly don't like and then create watered down hybrids of them from their mainstream/Ultimate universe counterparts.Well, the action sequences are still superb, and the film does have an obviously deep love for its title character. It's biggest crime is that it over-reaches its grasp, as seems to be the fate of so many comic book film franchises. So it's entirely great, but it's not entirely bad either.",1,"And they thought Topher Grace would be a great Venom... why, exactly?",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,5020,"['Plot', 'nutshell', 'picking',

649988,A38QEATH3NODFM,B00005JPFH,Wiseguy 945,"[2, 3]","This being the third in a series, Spiderman 3 has really created a lot of buzz, and criticism, and continues to break box office records.  I movie was good, but I'll admit it was slower at the beginning, and it was hard to figure out how they would tie the whole thing together, but the did a fair job, and of course left it open for another film. I guess their is a plan to do 5 movies total.  So, as expected, this being the third movie, the plot may be slower, but hopefully it will be a good building block for 4,5, and 6 (planned so far).  3 villans was a bit much, Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin-harry osbourne, but agian it was tied together at the end. I did feel this was a bit more violent than the other 2 films, so parents, i would watch this first before having the kids see it.  So for those who are worried about all the criticism, think of it in similar terms as the star wars trilogy, they have been out for many years, and millions of different answer are around at which one is the best, but together they are a film dynesty that will live on forever regardless of the pieces.

649989,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JPFH,Wuchak,"[3, 5]","I think so. 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting in repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure!This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films.Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom.On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume.Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun.The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition:- Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.- Themes of humble remorse, friendship and faithfulness are touched on.- The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.- What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgivenness.- On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let alone a superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior.You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own).On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit.My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary.CONCLUSION: ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth.

649990,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B00005JPFH,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[3, 4]","In SPIDER-MAN 3, Director Sam Raimi has kept the tone the same as in the other two great films.  Again, the heart of the film is the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Tobey McGuire & Kirsten Dunst) and this has been been the driving force of the film series. Each film has been emotionally powerful because of this. However, it might have slightly weighted down this film which is a minor complaint to this reviewer.  It didn't allow the full development of Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). However, whatever screen time they had, their characterizations were excellent. Once again, another key character in the film series is Peter Parker's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) as Spider-Man's voice of reason.  It's great that the creators of this film series have had the insight to carry over this element from the comics and use it in all three films (even the use of Ben Parker --Cliff Roberston--in flashback sequences). Rosemay Harris as Aunt May has been so good in all three films. SPIDER-MAN 3 had a lot to prove because SPIDER-MAN 2 was such a great film and this film had a lot of information to sift through. Such elements that were added to the plot was resolving the issues of the Peter Parker/Harry Osborn conflict and the real story behind the death of Ben Parker.  Another minor plot complaint is how the alien symbiote just happens to conveniently find Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Then again, this is a film based on a comic book and these type of coincidences happen all the time. The scenes with Peter and the symbiote provide a bit of comic respite in the film between all the mayhem. Tobey McGuire and his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is probably one of the best comic-book casting adapations to the screen. Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 is a very entertaining and satisfying film. The action and special effects were once again excellent, and the casting was great. Also, with all the plot elements in the story, this film, as in the first two, had another very emotional third act.",4,Bring on Spider-Man 4.,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2058,"['SPIDER-MAN', '3', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'kept', 'tone', 'same', 'other', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'Again', 'heart', 'film', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'been', 'been', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'series', 'film', 'been', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'However', 'might', 'have', 'slightly', 'weighted', 'down', 'film', 'minor', 'complaint', 'reviewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'full', 'development', 'Eddie', 'Brock/Venom', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Sandman/Flint', 'Marko', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'However', 'screen', 'time', 'had', 'characterizations', 'were', 'excellent', 'Once', 'again', 'key', 'character', 'film', 'series', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Spider-Man', 'voice', 'reason', 'great', 'creators', 'film', 'series', 'have', 'had', 'insight', 'carry', 'element', 'comics', 'use', 'three', 'films', 'even', 'use', 'Ben', 'Parker', 'Cliff', 'Roberston', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Rosemay', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'three', 'films', 'SPIDER-MAN', '3', 'had', 'lot', 'prove', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'information', 'sift', 'Such', 'elements', 'were', 'added', 'plot', 'was', 'resolving', 'issues', 'Peter', 'Parker/Harry', 'Osborn', 'conflict', 'real', 'story', 'death', 'Ben', 'Parker', 'minor', 'plot', 'complaint', 'how', 'alien', 'symbiote', 'just', 'conveniently', 'find', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'Then', 'again', 'film', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'type', 'coincidences', 'happen', 'time', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'symbiote', 'provide', 'bit', 'comic', 'respite', 'film', 'mayhem', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'comic-book', 'casting', 'adapations', 'screen', 'Overall', 'SPIDER-MAN', '3', 'very', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'film', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'Also', 'plot', 'elements', 'story', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'had', 'very', 'emotional', 'third', 'act']",Spider-Man 3
649991,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPFH,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","While watching the first two Spiderman films, I was impressed by a few things but also turned off by some as well.  I loved the action scenes and the sly little references to the Peter Parker/Spiderman duel identity, but was never really drawn into the Parker-Mary Jane romance or the development (or lack thereof of villains Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus).Thus, in stark contrast to most Amazon reviewers, I considered Spiderman 3 to be the best of the bunch due to a focus on even more action, plus better acting by Tobey Maguire as Parker/Spidey.  While still progressing the Peter/MJ relationship that screenwriters Miles Millar and Al Gough pretty much ruined in the second film, those scenes take a back seat to Spidey's struggles to fend off three new villains: Hob-Goblin, Sandman, and Venom.With the exception of Parker's friend Harry's Hob-Goblin, which got the short shrift of screen time, I considered both the other villains to be much more interesting than any previous ones.  Sandman actually had some character development that made him a true enemy of Parker, while Venom is probably the most interesting element of the entire Spiderman cannon.Besides that focus on action, though, was a much better performance by Maguire.  Likely do to the very interesting changes he undergoes while battling with Venom, Maguire is able to emote much more wildly/effectively than in the previous movies (where a wide-eyed stare was about all that ever happened).  I especially the scene in which Parker, under the full control of Venom, takes a night out on the town...hilarious!Thus, since I was never really drawn into the relationships/drama of the Spiderman franchise in the first place, I rate this film a cut above the rest for its focus on more action/fight scenes.  I can say with confidence that it did NOT kill the film franchise as many other reviewers are suggesting.",5,The Best Of The Bunch,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,1881,"['watching', 'first', 'two', 'Spiderman', 'films', 'was', 'impressed', 'few', 'things', 'also', 'turned', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'action', 'scenes', 'sly', 'little', 'references', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'duel', 'identity', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'drawn', 'Parker-Mary', 'Jane', 'romance', 'development', 'lack', 'thereof', 'villains', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', '.Thus', 'stark', 'contrast', 'most', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'considered', 'Spiderman', '3', 'be', 'best', 'bunch', 'due', 'focus', 'even', 'more', 'action', 'better', 'acting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Parker/Spidey', 'still', 'progressing', 'Peter/MJ', 'relationship', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'Al', 'Gough', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'second', 'film', 'scenes', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'Spidey', 'struggles', 'fend', 'off', 'three', 'new', 'villains', 'Hob-Goblin', 'Sandman', 'Venom.With', 'exception', 'Parker', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Hob-Goblin', 'got', 'short', 'shrift', 'screen', 'time', 'considered', 'other', 'villains', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'previous', 'ones', 'Sandman', 'actually', 'had', 'character', 'development', 'made', 'true', 'enemy', 'Parker', 'Venom', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'element', 'entire', 'Spiderman', 'focus', 'action', 'though', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'Maguire', 'Likely', 'do', 'very', 'interesting', 'changes', 'battling', 'Venom', 'Maguire', 'able', 'emote', 'much', 'more', 'wildly/effectively', 'previous', 'movies', 'where', 'wide-eyed', 'stare', 'was', 'ever', 'happened', 'especially', 'scene', 'Parker', 'full', 'control', 'Venom', 'night', 'out', 'town', 'hilarious', 'Thus', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'drawn', 'relationships/drama', 'Spiderman', 'franchise', 'first', 'place', 'rate', 'film', 'cut', 'rest', 'focus', 'more', 'action/fight', 'scenes', 'can', 'say', 'confidence', 'did', 'NOT', 'kill', 'film', 'franchise', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'suggesting']",Spider-Man 3
