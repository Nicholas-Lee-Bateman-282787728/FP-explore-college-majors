This new DVD is 45 minutes long with seven episodes full of Shaun the Sheep mischief!  We have seen some of the other episodes before but my boys (3 and 5) didn't mind.  What I like about Shaun the Sheep is that the characters don't talk, but rather make noises and use their actions.  It is a nice break from traditional animation.  There are even some lessons to be learned for kids and laughs for adults!",4,Classic Shaun the Sheep fun!,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,500,"['Shaun', 'Sheep', 'classic', 'family', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'new', 'DVD', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'seven', 'episodes', 'full', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'mischief', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'episodes', 'boys', '3', '5', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'What', 'like', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'rather', 'make', 'noises', 'use', 'actions', 'nice', 'break', 'traditional', 'animation', 'are', 'even', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'kids', 'laughs', 'adults']",Shaun Shear Madness

This DVD includes several new episodes, including a great sci-fi story with the goofy UFO aliens that have become regulars on the show, a couple with the farmyard pigs getting their comeuppance, and a wild house party where the farmer has a little too much fun.  The show shows remarkable durability - the jokes are still funny and the timing is still great. Recommended for viewers young and old! If you like Shawn already, you'll enjoy this collection as well.
