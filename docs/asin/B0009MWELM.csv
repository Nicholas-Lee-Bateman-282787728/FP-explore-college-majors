But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth.It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story.",2,Two hours of misery among losers,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,501,"['low', 'rating', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'least', 'part', 'result', 'having', 'wrong', 'expectations', 'it.I', 'had', 'heard', 'film', 'described', ""'charming"", ""'funny"", 'was', 'expected', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'black', 'one', 'good', 'acting', 'film', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth.It', 'dismal', 'agonizingly', 'dreary', 'film', 'people', 'never', 'come', 'care', 'am', 'avid', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'buff', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'merit', 'crude', 'hate-ridden', 'depressing', 'story']",Up and Down
908437,A2O2V6BE12IZDA,B0009MWELM,Brain Drain,"[3, 9]","The summary of this movie makes it sound like a light-hearted happy-go-lucky type of film.  Unfortunately, it is exactly the opposite.  Aside from the funny scene involving the Colonel, I didn't see much humor.  Mainly this movie revolves around the serious (not funny) topics of neglect, racism, and self-worth.  At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't getting the Czech type of humor, but by the end I was thoroughly depressed.  Maybe if my expectations had been different I could give this more than 2 stars.  If you like deep, thoughful movies, then this might suit you, but don't expect Sideways part 2.",2,This is a comedy?,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,612,"['summary', 'movie', 'light-hearted', 'happy-go-lucky', 'type', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'Aside', 'funny', 'scene', 'involving', 'Colonel', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'humor', 'Mainly', 'movie', 'serious', 'not', 'funny', 'topics', 'neglect', 'racism', 'self-worth', 'first', 'thought', 'maybe', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'Czech', 'type', 'humor', 'end', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'depressed', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'could', 'give', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'like', 'deep', 'thoughful', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'suit', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Sideways', 'part', '2']",Up and Down
908438,ANEP7R6LM206E,B0009MWELM,Dave92270,"[0, 8]","This movie could have been much better if only the director examined his work with some self criticism, and cut out (and replaced) about 40-60 minutes of boring and deadly dragging footage; that is what the movie fell into after 10 minutes or so of the promising opening scene. I'd be curious to find out where the director dug out the cast (I recognized only aged Jan Triska, who's fame has been long gone), but the quality of acting was terrible for the most of the time. I'm definitely puzzled by the choice of several non-native Czech actors portraying the locals (maybe a deeper meaning in this plot touching the immigration issue?). Anyway, perhaps the script was bad too, so combined with poor acting the result was inevitable; the not-so-original scheme of portraying bunch of losers going through theirs ups and downs did not help either. This movie will probably be soon forgotten; the creators tried to come up with something very original, and in my opinion they failed all the way. I feel somewhat sad for the fact that this piece of work represents the Czech country abroad these days; my country. Why do we need to be reminded of problems which mass media beats into us on a daily bases and long-term issues obvious when you look around if you stick in the country for a longer then 2 week holiday? If this material was presented in the more professional manner, maybe the movie had a chance - but bad matter wrapped into the equally bad movie hurts twice - painful enough that I felt need to write this short review.I'm not familiar with too many good Czech movies created during the last decade, I guess nobody sticks out of the crowd and has enough talent, experience and taste that would even remotely match exceptionally excellent Zdenek Sverak (my favorite Czech director). The director of ""Up and Down"" Jan Hrebejk has a lot to learn ahead, and I'll think twice before watching his next movie, even for free (my wife and I were silly enough to grab this on Pay-per-View for fee; I checked the mixed reviews here before the purchase and since I've seen split ratings, we gave it a try).",2,up and down...and down again,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,2107,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'director', 'examined', 'work', 'self', 'criticism', 'cut', 'out', 'replaced', '40-60', 'minutes', 'boring', 'deadly', 'dragging', 'footage', 'what', 'movie', 'fell', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'promising', 'opening', 'scene', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'director', 'dug', 'out', 'cast', 'recognized', 'only', 'aged', 'Jan', 'Triska', 'who', 'fame', 'been', 'long', 'gone', 'quality', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'most', 'time', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'puzzled', 'choice', 'several', 'non-native', 'Czech', 'actors', 'portraying', 'locals', 'maybe', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'plot', 'touching', 'immigration', 'issue', 'Anyway', 'perhaps', 'script', 'was', 'bad', 'too', 'so', 'combined', 'poor', 'acting', 'result', 'was', 'inevitable', 'not-so-original', 'scheme', 'portraying', 'bunch', 'losers', 'going', 'theirs', 'ups', 'downs', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'creators', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'very', 'original', 'opinion', 'failed', 'way', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'fact', 'piece', 'work', 'Czech', 'country', 'abroad', 'days', 'country', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'problems', 'mass', 'media', 'beats', 'daily', 'bases', 'long-term', 'issues', 'obvious', 'when', 'look', 'stick', 'country', 'longer', 'then', '2', 'week', 'holiday', 'material', 'was', 'presented', 'more', 'professional', 'manner', 'maybe', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'bad', 'matter', 'wrapped', 'equally', 'bad', 'movie', 'twice', 'painful', 'enough', 'felt', 'need', 'write', 'short', 'review.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'Czech', 'movies', 'created', 'last', 'decade', 'guess', 'nobody', 'crowd', 'enough', 'talent', 'experience', 'taste', 'would', 'even', 'remotely', 'match', 'exceptionally', 'excellent', 'Zdenek', 'Sverak', 'favorite', 'Czech', 'director', 'director', 'Up', 'Down', 'Jan', 'Hrebejk', 'lot', 'learn', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'watching', 'next', 'movie', 'even', 'free', 'wife', 'were', 'silly', 'enough', 'grab', 'Pay-per-View', 'fee', 'checked', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'here', 'purchase', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'split', 'ratings', 'gave', 'try']",Up and Down

Watched it last night thinking it would be a comedy, but I'd have to say it veers more towards drama with a couple of funny moments. The plot is sometimes a bit clunky but quite clever. The different (intersecting) stories make an interesting assessment of race, migration, and class issues in present-day Europe. Some of the acting is quite good, particularly the lonely mother (Vera) and the dim-witted yet endearing Franta.

908440,A25KKXUQQ0OLWB,B0009MWELM,"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher""","[5, 5]","The movie is similar to Crash.  It is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration, emigration and racial mixing among modern day Czechs.  The performances are expertly acted and very moving.  I love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to ""adopt"" a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home.  It seems when it comes to having a son, color doesn't really matter all that much, even to a committed Ayran!",5,Well I Really Liked It!,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,431,"['movie', 'similar', 'Crash', 'comedy/drama', 'subject', 'immigration', 'emigration', 'racial', 'mixing', 'modern', 'day', 'Czechs', 'performances', 'are', 'expertly', 'acted', 'very', 'moving', 'love', 'storyline', 'skinhead', 'footballer', 'who', 'adopt', 'colored', 'boy', 'when', 'wife', 'home', 'when', 'having', 'son', 'color', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'much', 'even', 'committed', 'Ayran']",Up and Down
908441,A1K94LXX833JTT,B0009MWELM,Sanpete,"[1, 1]","This film is way underrated here.  It's really very nicely done, with a sharp script and spot-on acting, soundtrack (and sound in general), decoration (especially loved the moving doll collection!), editing--everything works.  I can see why some don't like it, having expected something else, but those looking for a subtle, intelligent but not intellectualized comedy/drama won't be disappointed.  The comedy is more of manners than slapstick, with lots of delicious, delightful touches, some absurdist, most very real.The film takes up a number of story threads and brings them all together in a satisfying if only partly happy way, not too hard to follow.  The unifying theme of immigration/emigration/race is handled from many angles, with apt twists and ironies.  The characters, from a spectrum of social heights, are well drawn and played.  We're made to care about most of them, even if some of their pretenses or weaknesses are poked at in funny ways at times.  We feel both their triumphs and tragedies.Em&iacute;lia V&aacute;s&aacute;ryov&aacute;, as a spurned wife, is especially good here, bringing a perfect balance and nuance to a complex role that could easily have made her unsympathetic.  Her dialogue is also exceptionally well honed.The 18-minute making-of piece has the usual behind-the-scenes stuff, moderately entertaining and informative.There's a cameo in the film by Vaclev Havel, by the way, not played up; it's just there in the logical place for it.",5,"Yes, it's a comedy!
