If this was the main drive, it is tragic because it does not engage reflection of a life lost. Others have hit out at the Mel Gibson type scene of the battle-field crucifixion and the awful last sequence. As a love story it is unrealistic. As a First World War story?-in the telling the Canadian experience it suffers the usual &#34;There was only us&#34; on the field of battle mentality and a glut of cinematographic violence. Moments which capture the hand to hand combat, the mud and gore but, if you read the history of Passchendaele, most of this film is way off the mark. For example, the black and white footage in the credits of the battle ground seemed at odds with the overly stated setting and delivery of this film. Not sure the point of it, neither history nor engaging story. Protagonist a John Wayne with Clint Eastwood voice. Superb photography but a nothing film.

Be aware, though, that the primary plot of this film is the relationship in Canada, not the war in Europe.  It also has major ethical themes.  I would say this is more a romance than a war film.  If you are looking for a thoughtful commentary on love and the human condition in a time of crisis, this is a gem.  If you are looking for a swaggering war film, this is not it.All that said, the (too short, in my opinion) war scenes are spectacular.

1212703,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B001L1IDJ2,"Been around this block, several times over","[1, 6]","The relatively low ratings this film has received are undeserved.  I'm a psychotherapist and social scientist, and I watch a lot of movies because so much that is central to human experience is coded in narrative form.  Narrative transports us where we might never otherwise go, and it has the power to do so when few other things do-- e.g., I watched an antisemitic person bawl uncontrollably while seeing Shindler's list (not that she didn't struggle to insure that her attitudes remained unchanged, but she was unquestionably affected).  From my point of view, many of the less accepting reviews seemed somewhat to miss the point.We watch movies like our primitive ancestors used to sit around campfires listening to mythopoetic tales.  They seemed magical.  To achieve this, story tellers used symbols and personalized (interaction among character we can acre about and identify with)-- as well as plot progression.  We are drawn into a lot of ugliness we might otherwise avoid by having gotten caught up in the lives of the characters.  They're why the story matters to us.The movie is about a massive war that involved almost the entire world and turned warfare into a whole new level of technocarnage (represented here by the impersonal artillery explosions constantly occurring and taking a huge number of victims).  What matters most is that we know that in the case of WW I, no aspect of the war  mattered one bit (as we are told by the writing that appears at the end (which says that the grown gained by the Canadians was gained right back in just 3 weeks by the Germans).  This is represented by the absence of anything visible worth winning pictured on the screen most of the time.  WW I was indeed a war over puddles, and it ended because everybody just got tired a needed to take a breath (the fighting would continue in Versailles, only to culminate in that other debacle, WW II).  Were it not for Hitler and what he represented, WW II would have represented little m ore than a replay of the poiuntlssness of WW I-- only with much more dangerous toys.  Just look at the famous Civil War documentary, and that war would have been almost similar had it not been for Lincoln, the end of slavery, and how the U.S. turned out-- because, in terms of the actual dying, it was as pointless, and as due to idiotic bravado.  Alas, WW I had no such issues:  IT WAS POINTLESS!!!The movie, however, made a critical point here:  IT BECOMES MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT INVOLVES PEOPLE.  This was powerfully conveyed when the main character went after the nurse's little brother, and the previously anonymous bad-guys-to-be-slaughtered (as he had slaughtered the blond kid at the beginning) German soldiers suddenly rose up as human beings, and stopped shooting because they were able to appreciate the striving of one of their fellow human beings (even though he was on the other side).  In aviation history, WW I is known as the war that brought an end to such chivalry.  Moreover, the contrast between the warmth of small town life and the ugliness of the guys who scrawled on the walls of the nurse's house; the purity of the hero's love for the nurse (his masculinity so secure that they could reverse nursing roles with each other, as the elderly do if Alzheimer's hits the one who had always been the caregiver); and the scenes of the gorgeous home country landscape they left in order to undertake the muddiness of the battlefield.This movie has to be seen more in terms of poetic art rather than straight representation-- which is why I harken to the wonderment of ancient peoples listening to the tales of Gilgamesh in Babylon, of of the Iliad in ancient Greece, the Gospels in early Christianity, the Old Testament stories among the ancient Hebrews, the Koranic verses among Bedouins in the desert, etc.  This is what happened to the history of art when Civilization first hit PBS TV stations in the 60s.  By taking the license it does, this film transports us to the TRUE WW I experience, and everything that leaves us disturbed and unsatisfied about the pointlessness of it all is only due to the fact that's that how it really was.  I highly recommend this film as a means to the soul of WW I, as an inkling into what the people of the time were trapped into, AS WE WILL BE IF WE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO WHAT OUR HEARTS TELL US AFTER SEEING SUCH MOVIES ABOUT UNDERTAKING SUCH POINTLESSLY NARCISSISTIC SELF-INDULGENCES FOR NO GOOD REASONS (do you read Iraq?).",5,"Hard to recall title, unforgetable experience",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,4464,"['relatively', 'low', 'ratings', 'film', 'received', 'are', 'undeserved', ""'m"", 'psychotherapist', 'social', 'scientist', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'central', 'human', 'experience', 'coded', 'narrative', 'form', 'Narrative', 'transports', 'where', 'might', 'never', 'otherwise', 'go', 'power', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'do', 'e.g.', 'watched', 'antisemitic', 'person', 'bawl', 'uncontrollably', 'seeing', 'Shindler', 'list', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'struggle', 'insure', 'attitudes', 'remained', 'unchanged', 'was', 'unquestionably', 'affected', 'point', 'view', 'many', 'less', 'accepting', 'reviews', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'miss', 'point.We', 'watch', 'movies', 'primitive', 'ancestors', 'used', 'sit', 'around', 'campfires', 'listening', 'mythopoetic', 'tales', 'seemed', 'magical', 'achieve', 'story', 'tellers', 'used', 'symbols', 'personalized', 'interaction', 'character', 'can', 'acre', 'identify', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'progression', 'are', 'drawn', 'lot', 'ugliness', 'might', 'otherwise', 'avoid', 'having', 'gotten', 'caught', 'up', 'lives', 'characters', ""'re"", 'why', 'story', 'matters', 'us.The', 'movie', 'massive', 'war', 'involved', 'almost', 'entire', 'world', 'turned', 'warfare', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'technocarnage', 'represented', 'here', 'impersonal', 'artillery', 'explosions', 'constantly', 'occurring', 'taking', 'huge', 'number', 'victims', 'What', 'most', 'know', 'case', 'WW', 'aspect', 'war', 'mattered', 'one', 'bit', 'are', 'told', 'writing', 'end', 'grown', 'gained', 'Canadians', 'was', 'gained', 'right', 'back', 'just', '3', 'weeks', 'Germans', 'represented', 'absence', 'anything', 'visible', 'worth', 'winning', 'pictured', 'screen', 'most', 'time', 'WW', 'was', 'indeed', 'war', 'puddles', 'ended', 'everybody', 'just', 'got', 'tired', 'needed', 'take', 'breath', 'fighting', 'would', 'continue', 'Versailles', 'only', 'culminate', 'other', 'debacle', 'WW', 'II', 'Were', 'not', 'Hitler', 'what', 'represented', 'WW', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'represented', 'little', 'm', 'ore', 'replay', 'poiuntlssness', 'WW', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'toys', 'Just', 'look', 'famous', 'Civil', 'War', 'documentary', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'similar', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Lincoln', 'end', 'slavery', 'how', 'U.S.', 'turned', 'out', 'terms', 'actual', 'dying', 'was', 'pointless', 'due', 'idiotic', 'bravado', 'Alas', 'WW', 'had', 'such', 'issues', 'IT', 'WAS', 'POINTLESS', 'movie', 'however', 'made', 'critical', 'point', 'here', 'IT', 'BECOMES', 'MEANINGFUL', 'IT', 'INVOLVES', 'PEOPLE', 'was', 'powerfully', 'conveyed', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'went', 'nurse', 'little', 'brother', 'previously', 'anonymous', 'bad-guys-to-be-slaughtered', 'had', 'slaughtered', 'blond', 'kid', 'beginning', 'German', 'soldiers', 'suddenly', 'rose', 'up', 'human', 'beings', 'stopped', 'shooting', 'were', 'able', 'appreciate', 'striving', 'one', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'even', 'was', 'other', 'side', 'aviation', 'history', 'WW', 'known', 'war', 'brought', 'end', 'such', 'chivalry', 'Moreover', 'contrast', 'warmth', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'ugliness', 'guys', 'who', 'scrawled', 'walls', 'nurse', 'house', 'purity', 'hero', 'love', 'nurse', 'masculinity', 'so', 'secure', 'could', 'reverse', 'nursing', 'roles', 'other', 'elderly', 'do', 'Alzheimer', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'caregiver', 'scenes', 'gorgeous', 'home', 'country', 'landscape', 'left', 'order', 'undertake', 'muddiness', 'battlefield.This', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'terms', 'poetic', 'art', 'rather', 'straight', 'representation', 'why', 'harken', 'wonderment', 'ancient', 'peoples', 'listening', 'tales', 'Gilgamesh', 'Babylon', 'Iliad', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'Gospels', 'early', 'Christianity', 'Old', 'Testament', 'ancient', 'Hebrews', 'Koranic', 'verses', 'Bedouins', 'desert', 'etc', 'happened', 'history', 'art', 'when', 'Civilization', 'first', 'hit', 'PBS', 'TV', 'stations', '60s', 'taking', 'license', 'film', 'TRUE', 'WW', 'experience', 'everything', 'disturbed', 'unsatisfied', 'pointlessness', 'only', 'due', 'fact', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'means', 'soul', 'WW', 'inkling', 'what', 'people', 'time', 'were', 'trapped', 'WE', 'WILL', 'BE', 'IF', 'WE', 'REFUSE', 'TO', 'LISTEN', 'TO', 'WHAT', 'OUR', 'HEARTS', 'TELL', 'US', 'AFTER', 'SEEING', 'SUCH', 'MOVIES', 'ABOUT', 'UNDERTAKING', 'SUCH', 'POINTLESSLY', 'NARCISSISTIC', 'SELF-INDULGENCES', 'FOR', 'NO', 'GOOD', 'REASONS', 'do', 'read', 'Iraq']",Passchendaele
1212704,AT57B36BHDQ00,B001L1IDJ2,Big Mike,"[3, 6]","This film actually put me to sleep. I watched the ""Road to Passchendaele"" feature on the DVD and it seemed to go on forever. One thing is quite clear and that is Paul Gross seems very fond of himself and his abilities. The film is heavy-handed and slow. It alternates between battle scenes and scenes on the homefront. I never believed the far-fetched romance with the Canadian nurse nor her brother with asthma who manages to enlist and winds up being looked after by Gross's character of Sergeant Mann, ala Saving Private Ryan. Yes, the battle scenes are gruesome and well filmed. It is just that the rest of the film is not on a par with the action scenes. I much more enjoyed The Red Baron and Flyboys. Perhaps maybe if Paul Gross had not tried to dominate every possible part of this film the results might have been better. The actual events on which this film is based were very significant and the Canadian forces made a great sacrifice and contribution. It is just a pity that this was not more obvious than Mr. Gross trying to carry the film solely by himself. He should at least have left the writing of the screenplay to someone more capable and objective. Then he would have been left with only top-star billing, directing and executive producing.

It helps define what is in people. What they're made of. This is more of a war/ anti-war film.Here's the scoop. Paul Gross, as Sgt. Dunne, is wounded in action during WWI. He falls for a nurse and is sent back home to Calgary, Canada. He meets up again with her there. He's a bit touched in the head from the war. She's ""broken"" because of a dark secret regarding her father in the war. Her younger, asthmatic, brother, due to some official skullduggery, is recruited against medical protocol and is sent to the front lines. Gross feels he must get back there to protect the boy, his love interest, and somehow himself. This is a mere sketch but I don't wish to spoil.User reviews are justifiably split. Paul Gross both wrote and directed this. I liked it more than not. There was a lot to like but there were also some serious missteps. The depiction of the battles, I thought, had a good look and feel to them. The climactic battle, in particular, is pretty incredible. Seeing guys fighting close up, hand to hand, is very immediate. It brings home how one needs to keep himself packed tight in those situations. The home scenes were more pedestrian. One reviewer mentioned how it reminded him of a Hallmark movie. I don't know if it was quite that hackneyed, but it wasn't far. Some of these scenes were just plain clumsy.The performances, particularly Gross's, were uniformly good. It had a good look and a good musical score. A bit of punching up in the script and better handling of the quieter scenes would have added great measure to the whole film.I liked this more than I didn't like it.

He is very far from his 'goofy', but likeable character he plays in Due South from his TV show. The depiction of the hand to hand combat scenes is every bit as good as seen in Saving Private Ryan.

I had never heard anything about Canadian involvement ""Over There,"" so it was certainly an eye-opener.My grandfather fought in the trenches of France, and my great-grandmother's sister was a Red Cross field nurse there, too.  He came home without a scratch, but would never utter a single word about the experience for the rest of his life.  She came home with a Purple Heart, watched her true love die of his wounds, and never married after such an overwhelming loss.  I share this for those who might think ""Passchendaele's"" story line is contrived or convoluted; given my own family legends, it's pretty believable to me.  I am a Vietnam War era veteran myself, so the combat and hospital scenes were meaningful, disturbingly well-produced and heartbreaking for me to watch.  Most viewers probably won't have that problem, but I could never even get past the opening credits when trying to watch ""Saving Private Ryan.""The story's vehicle is the love a wounded, shell-shocked soldier bears for the rehab center nurse who helped him recover in Calgary as the war continued to rage in Europe.  She has a few flaws, feels unworthy of a meaningful life, and does nothing to encourage his attention.  He discovers the nature of her flaws and is undeterred.  For love, through different routes, they both end up in Europe at the battle of Passchendaele.The love story is a sweet one. Michael Dunne and Sarah Mann are beautifully and believably played by Paul Gross and Caroline Dhavernas.  Scenes of passion are tastefully filmed, and there is very little vulgar language.

In short, it's far better than most movies on WWI, but this still isn't the ""great"" movie that desperately needs to be done.The combat scenes and authenticity in this movie are BY FAR the best done thus far on trench warfare.  Even more impressive, this film was written by and produced by, the main ""star"" or character in the movie.  This man did an outstanding job!  The story, or at least the opening scene, is based on the experiences of his grandfather in WWI.  The extra features are fantastic and you get a great idea of the pains they went through to get the look of Passchendaele correct.  As a fanatic on authenticity, the uniforms, weapons, and the battlefields are top-drawer - I didn't see any mistakes and that seriously impressed me.  The ""major"" battle scene at the end of the flick is superb, a bit campy right at the end, but over all, it's the best and most graphic WWI battle sequence yet filmed.On the down side, as always, it seems film makers find it necessary to implant some type of love story into a movie which doesn't need one.  In this case, the main character falls in love with a nurse and therein lies the problem I had with the film.  The love story only serves to slow the movie down and adds a bit of unrealistic puffery which wasn't needed.  The love story comes off a little too much like something you'd expect to see in a 1940's era flick and because of this, you can pretty much figure out who's gonna' die and who's gonna' make it through.  This movie would've been much better if they had stuck to telling the story of the Canadian troops and their German opponents and left the soap opera out of it.If it weren't for the love story, I would've easily given this movie 5 stars, but for that, I have to knock one off.

The plot is that a sergeant gets blown up, gets a medal and gets to go home (Canada) to be nursed by a quite lovely Nurse played beautifully by Caroline Dhavernas. He falls in love, she gets outed as a German (her dad is `stained by the cloud of Germany'). In a pique of patriotic zeal and anti Bosh fervour - her asthmatic brother gets a rather horrid Doctor to forge his health forms and he flies off to Passchendaele. Our hero then follows to protect him.Let me say up front this is not a war film per se. There are some battle scenes and as ever they have tried to emulate the efforts of `Saving Private Ryan' realism. It is a love story that uses WW 1 as a backdrop and does address some of the issues from around that time. As one of Canada's most expensive films to date, it wants to remind us that of the 600,000 Canadians that fought one in ten did not come home. There is a central theme around the `crucified soldier', an incident that was supposed to have happened after Ypres in 1915. To this day controversy still surrounds this alleged incident, but the movie turns it into a piece of contrived artifice, that turns the schmaltz up to levels where one would expect feedback.This is also a nice advert for the Canadian Tourist Board, as the scenes in rural Alberta are truly stunning, but whether they add to the lot is very subjective.  There are some nice touches, the blackmailing of young men/boys to join up, the use of carrier pigeons, soldiers sleeping on floors as the beds were too soft after being in trenches etc.  All of that should be incidental and is, the plot is where this film falls down and the reason, as one other reviewer has said, is this is an ego trip for Paul Gross (lovable Mountie from `Due South'); he wrote, co-produced, directed, starred and even wrote the song at the end - sorry the incredibly sentimental song at the end.As a one man effort it ain't bad but could have done with a guiding hand of objectivity - the biggest allegation is that there is nothing new here, it is not the worse war film ever but it is so far from being a good one. If you like a love story with a plot so contrived that belief will require complete suspension, then you have found your celluloid Nirvana. If on the other hand you think the memory of the men who fought from the Commonwealth, deserves a better memorial, then you would be better advised to seek out `Beneath Hill 60'Beneath Hill 60.",3,Passion Tale - and even that is contrived!,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2568,"['nearly', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'liking', 'one', 'point', 'opportunity', 'be', 'better', 'stubbornly', 'be', 'worse', 'plot', 'sergeant', 'blown', 'up', 'medal', 'go', 'home', 'Canada', 'be', 'nursed', 'quite', 'lovely', 'Nurse', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'love', 'outed', 'German', 'dad', 'stained', 'cloud', 'Germany', 'pique', 'patriotic', 'zeal', 'anti', 'Bosh', 'fervour', 'asthmatic', 'brother', 'rather', 'horrid', 'Doctor', 'forge', 'health', 'forms', 'Passchendaele', 'hero', 'then', 'protect', 'him.Let', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'not', 'war', 'film', 'se', 'are', 'battle', 'scenes', 'ever', 'have', 'tried', 'emulate', 'efforts', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'realism', 'love', 'story', 'WW', '1', 'backdrop', 'address', 'issues', 'time', 'one', 'Canada', 'most', 'expensive', 'films', 'date', 'remind', '600,000', 'Canadians', 'fought', 'one', 'ten', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'home', 'central', 'theme', 'crucified', 'soldier', 'incident', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'happened', 'Ypres', '1915', 'day', 'controversy', 'still', 'alleged', 'incident', 'movie', 'piece', 'contrived', 'artifice', 'schmaltz', 'up', 'levels', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'feedback.This', 'also', 'nice', 'advert', 'Canadian', 'Tourist', 'Board', 'scenes', 'rural', 'Alberta', 'are', 'truly', 'stunning', 'add', 'lot', 'very', 'subjective', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'blackmailing', 'young', 'men/boys', 'join', 'up', 'use', 'carrier', 'pigeons', 'soldiers', 'sleeping', 'floors', 'beds', 'were', 'too', 'soft', 'being', 'trenches', 'etc', 'should', 'be', 'incidental', 'plot', 'where', 'film', 'down', 'reason', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'ego', 'trip', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'lovable', 'Mountie', 'Due', 'South', 'wrote', 'co-produced', 'directed', 'starred', 'even', 'wrote', 'song', 'end', 'sorry', 'incredibly', 'sentimental', 'song', 'end.As', 'one', 'man', 'effort', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'guiding', 'hand', 'objectivity', 'biggest', 'allegation', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'not', 'worse', 'war', 'film', 'ever', 'so', 'far', 'being', 'good', 'one', 'like', 'love', 'story', 'plot', 'so', 'contrived', 'belief', 'will', 'require', 'complete', 'suspension', 'then', 'have', 'found', 'celluloid', 'Nirvana', 'other', 'hand', 'think', 'memory', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'Commonwealth', 'better', 'memorial', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'advised', 'seek', 'out', 'Beneath', 'Hill', ""60'Beneath"", 'Hill', '60']",Passchendaele
1212740,A3373I4II32NA1,B001L1IDJ2,Tyler,"[6, 7]","This movie is great, but there's little mention behind what is ""exactly"" behind the scenes of Passchendaele. It is a small Belgian town near the Ypres Salient in the Flanders area, where hundreds of thousands of British and Canadian soldiers met their fate from 1914-1918. Ypres was wrecked completely during the war and Passchendaele was blasted to oblivion by artillery and close fighting on both sides of the military armies that wrecked against each other there. Entire battalions ceased to exist in the fighting there, and this movie is dedicated to the soldiers of the Canadian army that fought and died there. Their casualties in that area are rated as well over 60,000 Canadian dead, and all from a country that had less than 10 million in the population.In the movie, one particular Canadian sergeant, who is wounded and forever haunted by the gory scenes of war he had experienced, is sent to Calgary, Alberta, Canada for a recruiting assignment under a no-nonsense Major who goes by the rules. He is attracted to a Canadian nurse, who not only happened to lose her father in an earlier battle that he participated in, but the hidden secret that her father had fought for the wrong side, which is soon brought to the public and making her lose her job for the accusation that she is a foreign spy. The nurse's brother, who suffers from asthma, is in love with a girl and feels shamed that he is not doing his part for the war effort, and has his patriotism questioned by the girl's father. With the public shame of who his father fought for, he seeks to enlist in any way he can and somehow worms his way over to a trench in the front lines.The sergeant then does what he can to get back to the war in order to protect the nurse's brother, just in time to participate in the bloody finale of the battles that rage around Passchendaele. The casualties there are unpredictable, and quite bloody, as a warning to those that think that this is just a romantic drama. The ending is quite surprising and very dramatic to great effect. I only watched the movie once, but what I saw was all I needed as a reason to order the movie myself. There are few WW1 movies like this one.
