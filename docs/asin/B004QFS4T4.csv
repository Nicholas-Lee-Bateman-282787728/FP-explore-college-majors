1424138,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004QFS4T4,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Every Vishal Bharadwaj movie is awaited with bated breath and most of them have not disappointed. He is one of the few makers who have mastered the blend of art, cinema and music effortlessly. Bharadwaj has also been adapting Shakespeare but in 7 Khoon Maaf, he finds inspiration in a short novella by Ruskin Bond, entitled `Susanna's Seven Husbands. Vishal's current favorite Priyanka Chopra essays the role of Susana. In a difficult role, she portrays the transition of a black widow from youth to old age effortlessly. The movie shows Susana and her efforts to find love in the arms of her seven husbands, who are both flawed and perverted in their own way. Arun Kumar, ( Vivaan Shah, the son of Nasseruddin Shah)a young forensic doctor  narrates the story to his wife played by Konkona Sen Sharma, and we get to met Susana and her seven husbands. The best ones were the one played by Irffan Khan and Neil Nitin Mukesh. Vishal cements his authority as the master of noir by making this cinema interesting. It is difficult to successfully, narrate and conclude the various stories seamlessly but he tries and sometimes this effort is unsuccessful. However, the movie is a winner, all I wish that Vishal would find a happy subject soon. I am eagerly awaiting his `Two States `with Shahrukh Khan.",4,7 Khoon Maaf ( Seven murders forgiven),1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,1296,"['Vishal', 'Bharadwaj', 'movie', 'awaited', 'bated', 'breath', 'most', 'have', 'not', 'disappointed', 'one', 'few', 'makers', 'who', 'have', 'mastered', 'blend', 'art', 'cinema', 'music', 'effortlessly', 'Bharadwaj', 'also', 'been', 'adapting', 'Shakespeare', '7', 'Khoon', 'Maaf', 'inspiration', 'short', 'novella', 'Ruskin', 'Bond', 'entitled', 'Susanna', 'Seven', 'Husbands', 'Vishal', 'current', 'favorite', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'role', 'Susana', 'difficult', 'role', 'transition', 'black', 'widow', 'youth', 'old', 'age', 'effortlessly', 'movie', 'Susana', 'efforts', 'find', 'love', 'arms', 'seven', 'husbands', 'who', 'are', 'flawed', 'perverted', 'own', 'way', 'Arun', 'Kumar', 'Vivaan', 'Shah', 'son', 'Nasseruddin', 'Shah', 'young', 'forensic', 'doctor', 'story', 'wife', 'played', 'Konkona', 'Sen', 'Sharma', 'get', 'met', 'Susana', 'seven', 'husbands', 'best', 'ones', 'were', 'one', 'played', 'Irffan', 'Khan', 'Neil', 'Nitin', 'Mukesh', 'Vishal', 'authority', 'master', 'noir', 'making', 'cinema', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'successfully', 'narrate', 'conclude', 'various', 'stories', 'seamlessly', 'sometimes', 'effort', 'unsuccessful', 'However', 'movie', 'winner', 'wish', 'Vishal', 'would', 'find', 'happy', 'subject', 'soon', 'am', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'Two', 'States', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan']",N/A
1424139,A1M39P7MO277FV,B004QFS4T4,Chinmay Hota,"[5, 5]","Killing one husband is a life time achievement, killing two is a rarity, but seven is certainly fiction. This conviction unburdens your mind before you start watching the movie, which flaunts seven murders (`Saat Khoon'). Number seven, due to its strong associations with mythology, folktales and religious beliefs, further helps the cause of your voluntary suspension of disbelief. Perhaps your readiness to approach the subject with this alternative sense of reality helps you to accept and appreciate the psyche of the main protagonist, who goes through her hubby killing regimen with a vigor that can match only with the hubby hopping spirit of Liz Taylor.Susanna (Priyanka Chopra) is as exotic in her milieu as her pet cobras in the dark well at the back of her house. Born of Anglo-Indian parents, she is the quintessential Saheb to her household helps and the small boy she has taken under her wings. Having experienced family tragedies early in her life, she yearns for true love, and stumbles into one man after another. But every time she finds her marriage is an inconvenience which must be corrected. She finds no better way than to bump off the inadequate, drug addict, cruel, two-timing, lustful and scheming husbands with novel ways each time. Her close coterie is always close by and helping her to deliver the lethal blow.The beauty of the narrative is that despite the predictable and episodic succession of events, one does not lose interest in the `next' husband and his murder. There is an element of suspense in the execution despite the overarching predictability. The shikar killing, the snake bites, the Viagra killing all add to the thrill as do the sadism of one husband and lustfulness of another. The mystery surrounding Susanna's supposed `death' by fire and also her `seventh husband' keep the audience engrossed. The novelist Ruskin Bond gives an O. Henry type turn to the plot with the final husband episode.Priyanka Chopra excels in her enactment of different stages of Susanna's life and transition from a sprightly young woman to a graying old lady. The `Darling' song adds pep to the somber atmosphere of the plot.The movie did not succeed in the box office because the plot of husband killing is an assault on traditional Indian psyche, which expects a woman to be meek and weak: the sati savitri type. Susanna's hubby bashing with aplomb was considered outlandish, despite the fact that Indian mythology is replete with instances of female energy (shakti) destroying the evil power. During the fight with one of the demons Goddess Durga, manifested herself in seven forms, each signifying the energy of the gods of Hindu pantheon.  In the form of Chamundi she manifests the controlling power that destroys all distractions of the mind and facilitates withdrawal and inward concentration.  As Kaumari she personifies the awakening power that creates aspiration for spiritual liberation through a Guru and so on.How true of Susanna!Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'",5,Murder with Meaning,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,3008,"['Killing', 'one', 'husband', 'life', 'time', 'achievement', 'killing', 'two', 'rarity', 'seven', 'certainly', 'fiction', 'conviction', 'mind', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'seven', 'murders', 'Saat', 'Khoon', 'Number', 'seven', 'due', 'strong', 'associations', 'mythology', 'folktales', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'further', 'cause', 'voluntary', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Perhaps', 'readiness', 'approach', 'subject', 'alternative', 'sense', 'reality', 'accept', 'appreciate', 'psyche', 'main', 'protagonist', 'who', 'hubby', 'killing', 'regimen', 'vigor', 'can', 'match', 'only', 'hubby', 'hopping', 'spirit', 'Liz', 'Taylor.Susanna', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'exotic', 'milieu', 'pet', 'cobras', 'dark', 'well', 'back', 'house', 'Born', 'Anglo-Indian', 'parents', 'quintessential', 'Saheb', 'household', 'helps', 'small', 'boy', 'taken', 'wings', 'Having', 'experienced', 'family', 'tragedies', 'early', 'life', 'true', 'love', 'one', 'man', 'time', 'marriage', 'inconvenience', 'must', 'be', 'corrected', 'better', 'way', 'bump', 'off', 'inadequate', 'drug', 'addict', 'cruel', 'two-timing', 'lustful', 'scheming', 'husbands', 'novel', 'ways', 'time', 'close', 'coterie', 'always', 'close', 'helping', 'deliver', 'lethal', 'blow.The', 'beauty', 'narrative', 'predictable', 'episodic', 'succession', 'events', 'one', 'not', 'lose', 'interest', 'next', 'husband', 'murder', 'element', 'suspense', 'execution', 'overarching', 'predictability', 'shikar', 'killing', 'snake', 'bites', 'Viagra', 'killing', 'add', 'thrill', 'do', 'sadism', 'one', 'husband', 'lustfulness', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Susanna', 'supposed', 'death', 'fire', 'also', 'seventh', 'husband', 'keep', 'audience', 'engrossed', 'novelist', 'Ruskin', 'Bond', 'O.', 'Henry', 'type', 'turn', 'plot', 'final', 'husband', 'episode.Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'excels', 'enactment', 'different', 'stages', 'Susanna', 'life', 'transition', 'sprightly', 'young', 'woman', 'graying', 'old', 'lady', 'Darling', 'song', 'pep', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'box', 'office', 'plot', 'husband', 'killing', 'assault', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'psyche', 'woman', 'be', 'meek', 'weak', 'sati', 'savitri', 'type', 'Susanna', 'hubby', 'bashing', 'aplomb', 'was', 'considered', 'outlandish', 'fact', 'Indian', 'mythology', 'replete', 'instances', 'female', 'energy', 'shakti', 'destroying', 'evil', 'power', 'fight', 'one', 'demons', 'Goddess', 'Durga', 'manifested', 'seven', 'forms', 'signifying', 'energy', 'gods', 'Hindu', 'pantheon', 'form', 'Chamundi', 'controlling', 'power', 'distractions', 'mind', 'facilitates', 'withdrawal', 'inward', 'concentration', 'Kaumari', 'awakening', 'power', 'aspiration', 'spiritual', 'liberation', 'Guru', 'so', 'on.How', 'true', 'Susanna', 'Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', ""'Hits"", 'Misses']",N/A
1424140,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B004QFS4T4,C.Wallace,"[0, 0]","My spin on this movie is that the viewer should stay with the film, which has its ups and downs, until the conclusion. I found the conclusion to be simply overpowering.This is an Indian production. The dialogue is largely in Hindi with lengthy English passages. Many characters alternate English and Hindi. (There are subtitles throughout.)  Priyanka Chopra brilliantly portrays Susanna, who, to say the very least, is unlucky in love. She has six failed marriages to men who abuse her in various ways, often including brutal violence. There's also betrayal, to which Susanna responds most vigorously. It seems she attracts men of wealth and status. It made me think of Cleopatra, who seduced both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Most accounts say that Cleopatra was rather plain physically, but she had great charisma. Well, Susanna is a stunning beauty with intoxicating charm. She marries these six men, is a loving and faithful wife, but they do not return her love. So, the film gets dark. And you know what happens in ""dark"" movies. Some say there are comedic elements here; I did not laugh at all. Well, maybe a few grins.The direction is strong, the acting is great. One weakness of the film for me was that the shots were often shadowy and, literally, dark. I have read reviews that indicate this was purposeful, fitting the general theme. But I had a hard time making out what was going on sometimes.I recommend this film most heartily. It seems to me that Chopra captures something very important here about how women look at the world around them. I won't even try to articulate it.

1424142,A14H191AH66PPK,B004QFS4T4,Traddles,"[1, 1]","This film was advertised as a black comedy - emphasis on the black.  It has its fair share of unsettling moments, from the very start to the very end.  I won't say too much about the plot, since it's the type of story that should only be revealed in the watching of it.  Priyanka Chopra plays Susannah, a woman who marries seven times over the course of her life and is suspected of murdering her husbands.  The film is dark and atmospheric, with an aura of colonial decay.  Susannah's character evolves from a young woman who's been dealt some genuinely bad luck in life, to a cunning and calculating older woman descending into depression and, it seems, occasionally bordering on insanity.Susannah lives on her family's colonial estate with an entourage of loyal servants.  Her first marriage is to a cruel and abusive army lieutenant, and you feel for her as she is trapped in a terrible situation.  After husband #1 dies suddenly, she quickly marries again to an up-and-coming musician, who turns out to have some demons of his own.  Yet again, you feel for her as the victim.  It's husband #3 who's truly appalling; a man who initially looks promising is, in reality, sadistic at the core.  At this point you're practically rooting for her to kill him, so hideous is his treatment of her.  But husband #3 also marks an important turning point in the narrative.  With her first two husbands, it seemed that Susannah simply had a run of bad luck but hope remained that a good guy would come along.  Husband #3, however, seems to break her spirit and initiate her transition into a woman who will unhesitatingly hurt those who try to hurt her.  The plot darkens as Susannah becomes somewhat mercenary in her treatment of men, and the audience becomes exasperated at her unending ability to not only attract bad men, but welcome them into her life with open arms.Priyanka Chopra is excellent as a woman battered, bruised, and teetering on the edge of madness.  Whether or not she truly finds redemption is ambiguous.  I found it particularly interesting that the collective psyche of her ever-loyal servants seems to follow the same arc as her own; as Susannah's behavior becomes increasingly unbalanced, so too does their behavior touch on the surreal.The imagery of the film creates a deep impression.  The family estate decays over time; the repeated cycle of marriages and funerals is heavily imbued with Catholic motifs of incense, crucifixes, and looming stained-glass windows; and the seventh marriage relies on Catholic tradition to make the final connection between death and marriage, sin and redemption, very explicit indeed.",4,Very Noir,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,2637,"['film', 'was', 'advertised', 'black', 'comedy', 'emphasis', 'black', 'fair', 'share', 'unsettling', 'moments', 'very', 'start', 'very', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'type', 'story', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'revealed', 'watching', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'Susannah', 'woman', 'who', 'seven', 'times', 'course', 'life', 'suspected', 'murdering', 'husbands', 'film', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'aura', 'colonial', 'decay', 'Susannah', 'character', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'dealt', 'genuinely', 'bad', 'luck', 'life', 'cunning', 'calculating', 'older', 'woman', 'descending', 'depression', 'occasionally', 'bordering', 'insanity.Susannah', 'lives', 'family', 'colonial', 'estate', 'entourage', 'loyal', 'servants', 'first', 'marriage', 'cruel', 'abusive', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'feel', 'trapped', 'terrible', 'situation', 'husband', '1', 'dies', 'suddenly', 'quickly', 'marries', 'again', 'up-and-coming', 'musician', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'demons', 'own', 'Yet', 'again', 'feel', 'victim', 'husband', '3', 'who', 'truly', 'appalling', 'man', 'who', 'initially', 'promising', 'reality', 'sadistic', 'core', 'point', ""'re"", 'practically', 'rooting', 'kill', 'so', 'hideous', 'treatment', 'husband', '3', 'also', 'important', 'turning', 'point', 'narrative', 'first', 'two', 'husbands', 'seemed', 'Susannah', 'simply', 'had', 'run', 'bad', 'luck', 'hope', 'remained', 'good', 'guy', 'would', 'come', 'along', 'Husband', '3', 'however', 'break', 'spirit', 'initiate', 'transition', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'unhesitatingly', 'hurt', 'who', 'try', 'hurt', 'plot', 'Susannah', 'somewhat', 'mercenary', 'treatment', 'men', 'audience', 'exasperated', 'unending', 'ability', 'not', 'only', 'attract', 'bad', 'men', 'welcome', 'life', 'open', 'arms.Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'excellent', 'woman', 'battered', 'bruised', 'teetering', 'edge', 'madness', 'not', 'truly', 'redemption', 'ambiguous', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'collective', 'psyche', 'ever-loyal', 'servants', 'follow', 'same', 'arc', 'own', 'Susannah', 'behavior', 'increasingly', 'unbalanced', 'so', 'too', 'behavior', 'touch', 'surreal.The', 'imagery', 'film', 'deep', 'impression', 'family', 'estate', 'decays', 'time', 'repeated', 'cycle', 'marriages', 'funerals', 'heavily', 'imbued', 'Catholic', 'motifs', 'incense', 'crucifixes', 'looming', 'stained-glass', 'windows', 'seventh', 'marriage', 'relies', 'Catholic', 'tradition', 'make', 'final', 'connection', 'death', 'marriage', 'sin', 'redemption', 'very', 'explicit', 'indeed']",N/A

The narrative is intriguing and slowly grows on you. It makes you wonder, what would you do if you were in Susanna's shoes.Vishal veer's away from showing anything gory.
