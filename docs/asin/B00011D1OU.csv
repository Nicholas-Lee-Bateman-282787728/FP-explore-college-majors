790504,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00011D1OU,Acute Observer,"[2, 10]","The film begins in prewar England. People go about their lives. [No mention of the Great Depression here.] People are concerned with their pleasures and annoyed by changes in society. The Minivers live in a large house with servants. ""What is money?"" Are people wasting time on the vanities of life? What will their son learn at college? Do class privileges affect a mere flower show? Do students learn a new attitude at college? Is this to inculcate political views that differ from their home life? Who benefits?The people are in church when a message arrives: they are at war! They have to defend their freedom. Will they be bombed now? Horace is the first to leave. Vin prefers the RAF. Does the naming of a rose symbolize social changes? There are blackouts at night. One German plane was shot down, the pilot is at large. Mr. Miniver patrols at night with a rifle. Vin is in the RAF as a pilot officer. A night time call summons Mr. Miniver to the river patrol. The boats are filled with gasoline and sent to Ramsey. A fleet of small boats will rescue the British Army from Dunkirk. Mrs. Miniver finds that German pilot in her back yard! When he faints she calls the police. He predicts thousands more will come to bomb England, and shows himself to lack diplomacy and good manners.Mrs. Miniver researched the Beldon family history for an amusing scene. Time moves fast during a war. The family has a bomb shelter with a poison gas detector. The sound of explosions symbolize the air war. ]Don't put cans on the top shelf!] The children are frightened. Their house was damaged but life goes on. Lady Beldon announces the winners of the flower show. The station master wins for his Miniver rose. Then there is an air raid warning siren. Cars can't use lights at night. A two-engined plane crashes in flames. Some bullets hit the car. Carol is wounded but the ambulances are busy. They meet in the damaged church. The sermon gives hope to the people, to inspire them to fight the enemy. [A message to the audience.] This low-keyed story shows some of the effects of war on ordinary people. Later films would be more dramatic, and better.The English aristocracy own about 90% of the land. The villages must respect their lords and ladies or suffer for it. Even if they own a home they only lease the land from the aristocracy. In effect, it's a company town. Was Mrs. Miniver too young for a 20-year old son? [But not for marriage.] Helmut Dantine was a political refugee from Nazi Austria, and like others played the enemy. Richard Ney later wrote ""The Wall Street Jungle"", a guide for investors.",3,War Comes to Britain,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,2600,"['film', 'prewar', 'England', 'People', 'go', 'lives', '[', 'mention', 'Great', 'Depression', 'here', ']', 'People', 'are', 'concerned', 'pleasures', 'annoyed', 'changes', 'society', 'Minivers', 'live', 'large', 'house', 'servants', 'What', 'money', 'Are', 'people', 'wasting', 'time', 'vanities', 'life', 'What', 'will', 'son', 'learn', 'college', 'Do', 'class', 'privileges', 'affect', 'mere', 'flower', 'show', 'Do', 'students', 'learn', 'new', 'attitude', 'college', 'inculcate', 'political', 'views', 'differ', 'home', 'life', 'Who', 'benefits', 'people', 'are', 'church', 'when', 'message', 'are', 'war', 'have', 'defend', 'freedom', 'Will', 'be', 'bombed', 'now', 'Horace', 'first', 'leave', 'Vin', 'RAF', 'naming', 'rose', 'symbolize', 'social', 'changes', 'are', 'blackouts', 'night', 'One', 'German', 'plane', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'pilot', 'large', 'Mr.', 'Miniver', 'night', 'rifle', 'Vin', 'RAF', 'pilot', 'officer', 'night', 'time', 'call', 'summons', 'Mr.', 'Miniver', 'river', 'patrol', 'boats', 'are', 'filled', 'gasoline', 'sent', 'Ramsey', 'A', 'fleet', 'small', 'boats', 'will', 'rescue', 'British', 'Army', 'Dunkirk', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'German', 'pilot', 'back', 'yard', 'When', 'police', 'thousands', 'more', 'will', 'come', 'bomb', 'England', 'lack', 'diplomacy', 'good', 'manners.Mrs', 'Miniver', 'researched', 'Beldon', 'family', 'history', 'amusing', 'scene', 'Time', 'fast', 'war', 'family', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'poison', 'gas', 'detector', 'sound', 'explosions', 'symbolize', 'air', 'war', ']', 'Do', ""n't"", 'put', 'cans', 'top', 'shelf', 'children', 'are', 'frightened', 'house', 'was', 'damaged', 'life', 'Lady', 'Beldon', 'winners', 'flower', 'show', 'station', 'master', 'Miniver', 'rose', 'Then', 'air', 'raid', 'warning', 'siren', 'Cars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'lights', 'night', 'two-engined', 'plane', 'crashes', 'flames', 'bullets', 'hit', 'car', 'Carol', 'wounded', 'ambulances', 'are', 'busy', 'meet', 'damaged', 'church', 'sermon', 'hope', 'people', 'inspire', 'fight', 'enemy', '[', 'message', 'audience', ']', 'low-keyed', 'story', 'effects', 'war', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Later', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'dramatic', 'better.The', 'English', 'aristocracy', 'own', 'about', '90', '%', 'land', 'villages', 'must', 'respect', 'lords', 'ladies', 'suffer', 'Even', 'own', 'home', 'only', 'lease', 'land', 'aristocracy', 'effect', 'company', 'town', 'Was', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'too', 'young', '20-year', 'old', 'son', '[', 'not', 'marriage', 'Helmut', 'Dantine', 'was', 'political', 'refugee', 'Nazi', 'Austria', 'others', 'played', 'enemy', 'Richard', 'Ney', 'later', 'wrote', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Jungle', 'guide', 'investors']",N/A

790510,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00011D1OU,Bobby Underwood,"[87, 89]","This beautiful drama about a quiet English village and its inhabitants during the early days of WWII is perfect in every way. Director William Wyler was himself flying a bombing mission over Germany the night the Academy got it right and singled it out as Best Picture. Like the hat Greer Garson purchases despite the cost, this film is rather precious, and if made tomorrow, would still win the award for Best Picture.Wyler was delivered a fabulous script from screenwriters Arthur Wimpers, George Froeschell, James Hilton, and Claudine West. Greer Garson's restrained performance as Jan Struther's heroine won her Best Actress honors but the entire cast is equally good, Teresa Wright especially so as the bright and cheery young woman who would marry the Miniver's son and show them all the way.Wyler paints a lovely picture of day-to-day life in 1939 for the Miniver family and the small village where they live. Greer Garson is the nice Mrs. Miniver. An early scene when the kind porter Mr. Ballard (Henry Travers) reveals to her that he has named the beautiful red rose he intends to enter in the yearly floral contest after her, sets the feelings and mood of the entire film. The story of the white rose turning red from tears yet made more beautiful was not lost on audiences on both sides of the pond. If ever a film gave the world a resolve to stand up to evil, this quiet and touching film certainly did.Wyler shows the poignancy of young men going off to war as the Miniver's young son, Vin, home from college and full of ideals, joins the R.A.F. There is one terribly moving scene as Garson listens with all her being as the planes fly over, waiting for Vin's signal that he is one of those returning. Wyler shows the efforts of all during the early days of the war to help in any way possible. Clem (Walter Pidgeon) will use his small boat along with his fellow villagers in a dangerous rescue mission during the night, beautifully filmed by the director.But through the air raids, which become matter-of-fact for the Miniver family, the joyous moments of living are shown by Wyler, leaving no doubt that life will and does go on. Dame May Whitty is superb as the village's most powerful woman, Lady Beldon. She is the grandmother of the sweet Carol, portrayed winningly by Teresa Wright. It is her romance with Vin (Richard Ney) which will provide the most poignant moment in the film, showing that tragedy could come at any moment.Garson's cool resolve when confronting a downed German flyer in her kitchen is never to be forgotten. Neither are the moments of Mrs. Miniver's small children sleeping peacefully in the cellar during air raids hitting closer and closer to home while Clem talks and she knits. Just as moving, however, is the moment the winner for best rose is announced.There is a deeply moving and unexpected death, just as it happened to many families, English and otherwise, during the war. But it will not defeat the Minivers or the village, and the final speech was so stirring that Roosevelt had leaflets of it dropped from the air all over Europe.Rarely does something so entertaining have the substance of ""Mrs. Miniver."" It is no wonder that Churchill said ""Mrs. Miniver"" was more important to the war effort than an entire fleet of of destroyers ever could have been. A magnificent and unforgettable film you can watch time and again with the entire family.

In this film the victims, the stellar fighters are the civilians, the people who stayed home and quietly battled with their daily chores, food rations and welcomed their soldiers home. They do their tasks with humbleness, quietly. They are the the wives and brides, the upper and lower classes, they all fight together for the common cause, a just cause. Truly this was a war of classes: of all classes against a common enemy. Like Christian soldiers they march forward with resolution but no hatred, they helped with deeds more than words. There are truly some great scenes that will probably snatch a few tears from you.

The story opens in the last peaceful summer of 1939.  We meet the lovely Kay Miniver as she frets over buying a particularly expensive but beautiful hat.  It is a lovely, carefree scene which sets up the idyllic existence of Kay and her family in the close-knit village of Belham, a world which literally disappears when World War II breaks out.  Kay, her husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), eldest son Vin (Richard Ney) and his beautiful young bride Carol (Teresa Wright) become the central characters in a saga which scales the highs and lows of life lived in the worst possible circumstances, but the Miniver clan muddle through with strength, will and self-respect.There are many memorable scenes in the film: Kay reading `Alice in Wonderland' to the two younger children whilst in the bomb shelter; Clem leaving for the shores of Dunkirk on his rickety fishing boat; kindly station master Mr Ballard (Henry Travers) growing a rose in honour of Kay; and the amazing sequence where Kay herself confronts a downed Nazi fighter-pilot in her kitchen.MRS MINIVER remains to this day a moving account of wartime life in England.

I have been anxiously awaiting some of the older classic war movies like ""The Enemy Below (1957)"", ""African Queen (1951)"", ""Mrs. Minniver (1942)"", and ""The Pied Piper (1942)"" to come out on DVD. I am delighted to see this will be available in February.No movie that I have seen about WWII tells a better story of how the English endured so much hardship and personal loss for so many years. This could easily have been a very depressing movie but it has many lighter and uplifting moments that balance out the sorrow and make you feel good at the end of the movie. If you bought this just because of the award nominations it received you should consider yourself pretty smart. If you buy it because of the good reviews from people here at Amazon you are intelligent. If you bought it because you only buy the best movies, and this is a great movie with a boat load of extras, well there aren't words to describe how gifted you are.If you enjoy movies that take a more personal look at the impact of war on families you will like this movie. Far from being boring as some family movies drag when they get into far to many personal details. This movie has plenty of action with the Battle of Dunkirk, German bombings and strafings, and a enemy parachutist on the loose.

The biggest scandal for this village is when the lowly stationmaster has the effrontery to enter a rose in a `fixed' flower show.

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Mrs. Miniver was a character created by Jan Struther for a series of newspaper stories depicting life in England on the eve of World War II.  The articles were very popular and were issued in book form.  The rights were acquired by MGM in 1940 and a film version went into production.The film falls into two portion.  In the first, we find Mrs. Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family engaged in pleasant but everyday activities.  The family is well to do, living in a house with a garden that runs into the River Thames, where Mr. Miniver (Walter Pidegon) keeps a boat.  Mrs. Miniver has bought a new hat, and fears her husband will think she is extravagant; at the same time, Mr. Miniver has bought a new car, and has more cause to worry his wife will think him extravagant.  The couple have two young children at home (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son, Vin (Richard Ney), coming home from school.  Vin is quite taken with Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), the granddaughter of the local aristocrat, Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty.)  Everything is very pleasant--but everyone is increasingly aware of looming war.When the war does come, the Minivers find their pleasant way of life overturned in a number of ugly ways.  Vin joins the military.  Mr. Miniver takes his boat to participate in the evacuation of Dunkirk.  Mrs. Miniver confronts a Nazi in her own garden.  The family must hide in a garden bomb shelter against horrific bombing raids that leave their home, their church, their village damaged--and many killed, including a member of their family.MGM dramas of the 1940s tended to be very, very glossy, and MRS. MINIVER is no exception.  Indeed, he first half of the story is very much like a romantic comedy, excessively sweet and by today's standards a bit difficult to watch without the occasional groan.  But once the circumstances change, MRS. MINIVER becomes unexpectedly powerful in the unabashedly sentimental way that so many WWII movies have.  And it has numerous moments of greatness, most particularly the bomb-shelter sequence and the aircraft crash and its aftermath as wittnessed by Mrs. Miniver and Carol.  The last portion of the film is a real tear jearker, and it is easy to understand why audiences who walked into the theatre without much concern for England walked out demanding something be done.  When the film was released in 1942 President Roosevelt praised it for motivating Americans in the war effort, and Winston Churchill said it was worth six divisions.Seen today, the film is uneven, twitching between an idealistic English countryside and trivial melodrama before plunging into the horrors of war on the home front.  But director William Wyler and his cast carries it off extremely well.  Richard Ney is somewhat annoying as Vin, and Walter Pidegon is somewhat non-descript as Mr. Miniver, but Greer Garson is remarkable as Mrs. Miniver and Teresa Wright is nothing short of brilliant as the young Carol Beldon.  Strong support is offered by Dame May Whitty, Reginald Owen, Henry Travers, and Henry Wilcoxon.  And the cinematography by Henry Wilcoxon, music by Herbert Stothart, and other production details are very fine.The DVD offers little in the way of bonus material--a few shorts and a clip of Greer Garson winning the Academy Award as Best Actress--but the elements are clean.

790535,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B00011D1OU,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","MRS MINIVER is a classic example of a World War II Hollywood propaganda melodrama--but, oh my, what a fantastically entertaining, black & white movie treasure it is! All the artistic elements combine to completely overcome what qualms the viewer may have about propaganda films. Greer Garson positively glows as the prototype beautiful & kind wife & mother. She makes it easy to believe that a shy British stationmaster & rose enthusiast would name his prize hybrid bloom after her (as happens in the movie.)Garson is indeed a lovely revelation--but there is another revelation in MRS MINIVER, and it's actress Teresa Wright who plays the ill-fated daughter-in-law. In every film I've seen her in (THE LITTLE FOXES, BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, SHADOW OF A DOUBT) Wright radiates a simple charm & integrity, a person you can trust & believe in. Her natural form of acting is magnificent. She can convey in one glance what would require other actresses to use paragraphs of words. The really nice thing too, is that Teresa Wright conveyed that same honesty & gentle kindliness off-stage as well.I'll just mention one scene in MRS MINIVER that conveys the general tone of the movie. It takes place when the English Minivers, including two small children, are huddled in a homemade underground bomb shelter during the German Blitz. As explosions are heard all around, getting closer & the walls are shaking, Greer Garson's facial reactions are a marvel. There is fear. of course, but also anger that her children are placed in such jeopardy by the forces of war--and there is always that understated strength of her character. When the bombing finally ends, her little boy says, ""They almost killed us that time, didn't they?""A wonderful, wonderful film.The Little FoxesThe Best Years of Our LivesShadow of a Doubt (Enhanced) 1943",5,Shameless Melodramatic War Propaganda,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1823,"['MRS', 'MINIVER', 'classic', 'example', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Hollywood', 'propaganda', 'melodrama', 'oh', 'what', 'fantastically', 'entertaining', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'treasure', 'artistic', 'elements', 'combine', 'completely', 'overcome', 'what', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'propaganda', 'films', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'positively', 'prototype', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'wife', 'mother', 'easy', 'believe', 'shy', 'British', 'stationmaster', 'rose', 'enthusiast', 'would', 'name', 'prize', 'hybrid', 'bloom', 'happens', 'movie', 'Garson', 'indeed', 'lovely', 'revelation', 'revelation', 'MRS', 'MINIVER', 'actress', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'who', 'ill-fated', 'daughter-in-law', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LITTLE', 'FOXES', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'SHADOW', 'A', 'DOUBT', 'Wright', 'simple', 'charm', 'integrity', 'person', 'can', 'trust', 'believe', 'natural', 'form', 'acting', 'magnificent', 'can', 'convey', 'one', 'glance', 'would', 'require', 'other', 'actresses', 'use', 'paragraphs', 'words', 'really', 'nice', 'thing', 'too', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'conveyed', 'same', 'honesty', 'gentle', 'kindliness', 'off-stage', 'well.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'one', 'scene', 'MRS', 'MINIVER', 'general', 'tone', 'movie', 'place', 'when', 'English', 'Minivers', 'including', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'are', 'huddled', 'homemade', 'underground', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'German', 'Blitz', 'explosions', 'are', 'heard', 'around', 'getting', 'closer', 'walls', 'are', 'shaking', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'facial', 'reactions', 'are', 'marvel', 'fear', 'course', 'also', 'anger', 'children', 'are', 'placed', 'such', 'jeopardy', 'forces', 'war', 'always', 'that', 'understated', 'strength', 'character', 'When', 'bombing', 'finally', 'little', 'boy', 'almost', 'killed', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'film.The', 'Little', 'FoxesThe', 'Best', 'Years', 'LivesShadow', 'Doubt', 'Enhanced', '1943']",N/A

When war is declared, her life is deeply affected:  Her eldest son joins the Air Force, Clem is gone for days on boat patrol, and her village is subjected to enemy bombs.Released in 1942, this movie was a big hit with its patriotic message and wholesome family values.  While the Miniver family is somewhat idealized, they nevertheless feel the horror of wartime.

Beautifully directed by the great William Wyler(who won the first of his three Oscars for Best Director) and perfectly cast with suberb performances by Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Teresa Wright, Dame May Whitty and Henry Travers among others, it most certainly had an effect on audiences who went to see it in 1942. The United States had just entered the war but the people of Great Britian had been suffering constant bombardment by German aircraft for over three years. You really get a sense of what that was like when you watch what happens to the Miniver family who try to maintain their dignity during this awful time in British history. Watching this film, you really believe that Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon are married unlike most films they make today. This was in no part due to William Wyler. As he showed later in his films ""The Best Years of Our Lives""(1946) and ""Ben-Hur""(1959) as well as countless others, it's all about the family. You care about the Minivers and what happens to them. And after seventy years that still holds true today in 2013. Warner Home Video has finally released this superb film on Blu Ray and it's a wonder to behold. I'm not sure if this Blu Ray was from the original film negative but it sure looks like it. The film won the Oscar for it's cinematography by the great Joseph Ruttenberg and he would be proud of this Blu Ray persentation. Blacks, whites and grays are stunningly clear had there are no specks, dirt, lines or any defects for a film this age. The sound(mono) is crisp and clear. In fact, you'll probably have to turn the volume down during the bombardment scenes because they're so loud. And speaking of those scenes, most of us probably have never experienced that in our lives but these scenes make you feel what it must have been like, that's how well they're directed. The end of the film sends the right message. Through it all, there is hope. We know how things turned out, but audiences who left the theatre in 1942 didn't and wouldn't know for another three years. Warner Home Video deserves a lot of credit for finally putting this classic film on Blu Ray(aspect ratio: 1.37.1) and hopfully we'll see more blu ray classics from Hollywood's Goldern Era in the future. Mrs. Miniver is 134 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish(Castellano),Spanish(Latino) and Korean. Audio features include the following: English: DTS-HD Master Audio Mono and French,Italian,German,Spanish all in Dolby Digital Mono. This new blu ray edition of Mrs. Miniver is a must for any serious film collection.",5,A BEAUTIFUL BLU RAY ROSE FOR MRS.

Upon its release, Winston Churchill declared the film more influential in getting America involved in WWII than a fleet of destroyers. The plot concerns Mrs. Miniver (Greer Garson) the atypical English housewife quietly enduring the hardships of war and capturing a downed Nazi pilot in her begonias in the process. It sounds hoaky but actually the story is incredibly stirring. Walter Pigeon, Garson?s frequent costar, is cast as her tender husband, Clem. Richard Ney plays her slightly opinionated son, Vin who rises to the occasion and becomes a flyer for the RAF. Aside: Ney and Garson were carrying on an affair during the filming that eventually resulted in a disastrous marriage and a quicky divorce. Oh well, at least the relationships in the film are perfect. Of merit is Teresa Wright?s outstanding performance as Carol, Vin's doomed fianc?e.Previously issued versions of this film were near perfect so it's really no surprise to discover that this DVD carries on in the same tradition. Quite simply: the picture is outstanding. Blacks are deep and solid. The gray scale is beautiful and well balanced. There is hardly a scratch or a bit of grit or grain to distract. The soundtrack is equally impressive in MONO but very, very nicely balanced. A bit of a disappointment comes from the fact that no one at Warner Brothers had the foresight to do a ?making of? featurette.

There are extremely moving moments throughout, starting at the beginning with the lovely Mrs. Miniver accepting the compliment of having a rose, grown by the village station master, named after her.  We see her kindness.  As the film progresses we see the other facets of her personality---her charm, her humor, her love of frivolity (the hat!), her obvious love for her husband, her grown son and her two young ones.  She is the soul of tact in dealing with the class consciousness that is present in the form of the elderly Lady Balfour who objects to the marriage of her grand daughter to the Minifer boy.  As the war progresses and her challenges become more severe, Mrs. Minifer rises to each occasion.  If this sounds hokey, believe me, William Wyler presents this in a way that is very real.I've always heard of the English stiff upper lip and their staunch courage during WWII but this shows it in an amazing way...Mrs. Miniver knitting and chatting with Clem, her husband, about Alice in Wonderland as they are being bombed.  That was just one more incredible scene!We're not spared the sight of the heartache and loss of the war but the movie is not depressing...far from it. Again, it may sound cliche to a world that has grown so cynical, but this is indeed about the triumph of the human spirit.  If you need a reminder of what's important in life and what isn't, see this film!  I hate to think that we need a war to remind us; let's learn this lesson well so that we won't have to keep waging them.As everyone here has written, Greer Garson perfectly embodies all the virtues of Mrs. Miniver, including beauty.  But I'd also like to mention the very handsome and charming Walter Pidgeon!

The movie is very well acted and filmed. Director William Wylder did an excellent job creating a story beginning with the simple and peaceful life of people concerned with flower competitions and day to day family issues who are suddenly thrust into a conflict. Very few WWII movies deal as effectively with the impact of those on the home front. As the Battle of Britain rages overhead these characters continue to cope and try to live their lives in ever increasing difficulties. Greer Garson is fantastic as the wife and mother whose name gives the movie it's title.

It came out in 1942, after the Blitz and the Dunkirk rescue, but before the outcome of the war was decided.  Mr. and Mrs. Miniver are apparently upper middle class people, living in a nice house with a soldier-age son and younger children.  Their lives are disrupted when the dwelling is damaged by German planes.  The son becomes a fighter pilot and marries.  Mr. Miniver sets out in his little boat for Dunkirk to rescue trapped British soldiers in France.  Intermixed with this are attacks from the air, an escaped Nazi soldier, battles over who grows the best flowers and death.All the main characters seem to have been chosen for their looks, as well as their somewhat modest acting ability.  Greer Garson is especially attractive as the homemaker who appears to have been the English cousin of Beaver Cleaver's mom.  She did receive an Academy Award for her role, for inciting pride, patriotism, and anti-Nazism, as much as for her acting.  The son and his wife are a bit idealistic, as was the fashion of movies then, and Walter Pigeon is a bit too one dimensional.I had somehow missed seeing this for all these years, and I did enjoy it--if only for getting to see Greer Garson at her peak.",4,Well done,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,1259,"['nicely', 'done', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'British', 'propaganda', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1942', 'Blitz', 'Dunkirk', 'rescue', 'outcome', 'war', 'was', 'decided', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'are', 'apparently', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'people', 'living', 'nice', 'house', 'soldier-age', 'son', 'younger', 'children', 'lives', 'are', 'disrupted', 'when', 'dwelling', 'damaged', 'German', 'planes', 'son', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'marries', 'Mr.', 'Miniver', 'out', 'little', 'boat', 'Dunkirk', 'rescue', 'trapped', 'British', 'soldiers', 'France', 'Intermixed', 'are', 'attacks', 'air', 'escaped', 'Nazi', 'soldier', 'who', 'best', 'flowers', 'death.All', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'looks', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'modest', 'acting', 'ability', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'especially', 'attractive', 'homemaker', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'English', 'cousin', 'Beaver', 'Cleaver', 'mom', 'did', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'inciting', 'pride', 'patriotism', 'anti-Nazism', 'as', 'much', 'acting', 'son', 'wife', 'are', 'bit', 'idealistic', 'was', 'fashion', 'movies', 'then', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'bit', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional.I', 'had', 'somehow', 'missed', 'seeing', 'years', 'did', 'enjoy', 'only', 'getting', 'see', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'peak']",N/A
790572,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00011D1OU,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 2]","I write this in full knowledge that many aficionados of this well-made movie will be outraged.  ""Mrs. Miniver"" was made during WW II and is, in every way, a propaganda flick.  Yes, many English people did suffer during the Blitz exactly as depicted in the movie.  The old, children, women and lovely young people were struck down all over the globe.  The vast majority--no matter their nationalities--were entirely blameless. The most awkward point of this movie [some reviewers thought this was the most memorable part of this movie] was the German aviator.  Despite Mrs. Miniver's sincere efforts to help the wounded man, the German is an incredible monster.  He screeches ""better men than he will return and destroy the English more thoroughly than we [Nazis] destroyed the Hollanders at Rotterdam"" [which was pretty thorough but not nearly the 30,000 deaths our 'aviator' claims.  The actual Rotterdam death toll was 800-900.  The 30,000 death figure more closely approximates the number of civilians killed in the Allied bombing of Dresden in German Saxony].Despite the beautiful overall tone of the movie, the German aviator is grossly overdone entirely for propagandistic purposes.  It's difficult to know how an individual pilot would have behaved but--wounded on an enemy island with no chance for escape--it is likely that he would have been agreeable--probably even grateful--to help in any form.  I have some personal knowledge of this.  I live on the border with Mexico and frequently encounter illegal aliens.  Most are in trouble and need food and water [just like our German].  Few try to extort help from me.  Human nature.There is a fascinating film ""The Sorrow and the Pity"" about French collaboration with the Germans.  One resistance fighter cynically states that young German soldiers, stationed in France, were ""Nice, too nice, giving their bus seats to French old ladies.""  I believe this is a better characterization of young German soldiers.  Most of these young men came from families that required that children be polite and well-mannered.  As slightly older men--now soldiers--they [for the most part] adhered to long-standing family principles.  It's unlikely that many--especially if wounded in an enemy country that they couldn't escape--would have behaved like total pigs.",4,Beautifully Painted,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2306,"['write', 'full', 'knowledge', 'many', 'aficionados', 'well-made', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'outraged', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'was', 'made', 'WW', 'II', 'way', 'propaganda', 'flick', 'Yes', 'many', 'English', 'people', 'did', 'suffer', 'Blitz', 'exactly', 'as', 'depicted', 'movie', 'old', 'children', 'women', 'lovely', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'struck', 'down', 'globe', 'vast', 'majority', 'matter', 'nationalities', 'were', 'entirely', 'blameless', 'most', 'awkward', 'point', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'movie', ']', 'was', 'German', 'aviator', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'sincere', 'efforts', 'help', 'wounded', 'man', 'German', 'incredible', 'monster', 'better', 'men', 'will', 'return', 'destroy', 'English', 'more', 'thoroughly', '[', 'Nazis', ']', 'destroyed', 'Hollanders', 'Rotterdam', '[', 'was', 'pretty', 'thorough', 'not', 'nearly', '30,000', 'deaths', ""'aviator"", 'claims', 'actual', 'Rotterdam', 'death', 'toll', 'was', '800-900', '30,000', 'death', 'figure', 'more', 'closely', 'number', 'civilians', 'killed', 'Allied', 'bombing', 'Dresden', 'German', 'Saxony', ']', '.Despite', 'beautiful', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'German', 'aviator', 'grossly', 'overdone', 'entirely', 'propagandistic', 'purposes', 'difficult', 'know', 'how', 'individual', 'pilot', 'would', 'have', 'behaved', 'wounded', 'enemy', 'island', 'chance', 'escape', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'agreeable', 'probably', 'even', 'grateful', 'help', 'form', 'have', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'live', 'border', 'Mexico', 'frequently', 'encounter', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'Most', 'are', 'trouble', 'need', 'food', 'water', '[', 'just', 'German', ']', 'Few', 'try', 'extort', 'help', 'Human', 'fascinating', 'film', 'Sorrow', 'Pity', 'French', 'collaboration', 'Germans', 'One', 'resistance', 'fighter', 'cynically', 'young', 'German', 'soldiers', 'stationed', 'France', 'were', 'Nice', 'too', 'nice', 'giving', 'bus', 'seats', 'French', 'old', 'ladies', 'believe', 'better', 'characterization', 'young', 'German', 'soldiers', 'Most', 'young', 'men', 'came', 'families', 'required', 'children', 'be', 'polite', 'well-mannered', 'slightly', 'older', 'men', 'now', 'soldiers', '[', 'most', 'part', ']', 'adhered', 'long-standing', 'family', 'principles', 'unlikely', 'many', 'especially', 'wounded', 'enemy', 'country', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'would', 'have', 'behaved', 'total', 'pigs']",N/A

It carries the sentiment of its time with a great cast, but we don't see any violence and the war doesn't affect the people like one might expect. The results of war aren't sugarcoated, so the viewer is left with a powerful emotional experience at the end of the film.Mrs. Miniver (Greer Garson) is a kind and elegant women of England. Her primary concerns are caring for her family and convincing her husband (Walter Pidgeon) that her extravagant new hat is worth the price she paid for it. Then her son Vincent (Richard Ney) comes home from school, only to catch the eye of wealthy Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright). The town's biggest concern is a pending flower show where legacy winner Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) is threatened by Mr. Ballard's (Henry Travers) ""Mrs. Miniver"" rose. All of their happy plans come to a halt, though, when the country goes to war and homes are replaced with bomb shelters and families are torn apart to do their duty for the cause.The acting is outstanding. Garson is captivating in her role. Her age isn't well suited for the part, but her maturity makes that irrelevant. Ney is appropriately boyish and excited and Wright is lovely. Also notable are the children in the film (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) who play their roles convincingly and sweetly.Strangely enough, although Ney played her son in this film, Garson married him after the filming of Mrs. Miniver. The union ended badly, but their real-life relationship makes for interesting viewing.Also included on this disk is the theatrical trailor, Garson's Oscar speech, and two WWII era shorts.",5,"""It is a war of the people... of every man, woman, and child who loves freedom!""",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,1679,"['Mrs.', 'Miniver', ""n't"", 'typical', 'wartime', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'wonderful', 'sentiment', 'time', 'great', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'violence', 'war', ""n't"", 'affect', 'people', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'results', 'war', 'are', ""n't"", 'sugarcoated', 'viewer', 'left', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'experience', 'end', 'film.Mrs', 'Miniver', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'kind', 'elegant', 'women', 'England', 'primary', 'concerns', 'are', 'caring', 'family', 'convincing', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'extravagant', 'new', 'hat', 'price', 'paid', 'Then', 'son', 'Vincent', 'Richard', 'Ney', 'home', 'school', 'only', 'catch', 'eye', 'wealthy', 'Carol', 'Beldon', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'town', 'biggest', 'concern', 'pending', 'flower', 'show', 'where', 'legacy', 'winner', 'Lady', 'Beldon', 'Dame', 'May', 'Whitty', 'threatened', 'Mr.', 'Ballard', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'rose', 'happy', 'plans', 'come', 'halt', 'though', 'when', 'country', 'war', 'homes', 'are', 'replaced', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'families', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'do', 'duty', 'cause.The', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Garson', 'captivating', 'role', 'age', ""n't"", 'well', 'suited', 'part', 'maturity', 'irrelevant', 'Ney', 'appropriately', 'boyish', 'excited', 'Wright', 'lovely', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'children', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Severn', 'Clare', 'Sandars', 'who', 'play', 'roles', 'convincingly', 'sweetly.Strangely', 'enough', 'Ney', 'played', 'son', 'film', 'Garson', 'married', 'filming', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'union', 'ended', 'badly', 'real-life', 'relationship', 'interesting', 'viewing.Also', 'included', 'disk', 'theatrical', 'trailor', 'Garson', 'Oscar', 'speech', 'two', 'WWII', 'era', 'shorts']",N/A

Where Casablanca moves along and grounds everything in an emotional punch, this movie just slogs along in its own little world full of hokey music, adorable moppets and lazy staging. Almost every scene is static with a close-up and not much edit. The actors are shot in the middle of the frame and their acting ability consists of either goofy accents or (in the case of the title character) looking pretty but sometimes peevish when something is supposed to happen that is exciting. Sometimes she lets out a gasp between words which I suppose means that she's scared or worried. Most of the time she is just standing there stiff like she doesn't quite know what to do with her hands. At some points, she even stage whispers. That's the extent of her ability. I assume that she is the star and like many actresses and actors she was cast because she looked pretty and not due to any ability.There are also the requisite shots of adorable little moppets saying things that are supposed to be cute but aren't and family news that is supposed to be quaint but just isn't. And just in case you didn't know this was a propaganda melodrama, there's a German pilot to speak about crushing Britain beneath the Reich.This movie feels more like a stage show than a movie. I understand that many of the movie standards of the 1940s look hokey and silly these days, but there are genuine classics from the era that managed to still be original and compelling.

It starts out in a small English town just before world war 11 broke out.The oldest son joins the airforce right away. And everytime he goes out everyone fears he won't come back alive. His airbase is right by his parents house so he fly's right over their house every time he leaves.He is 20 & his girl is 18. He asked her to marry him & she said's yes so they get married right away.One time when the Germans frew right over their house they dropped bombs & destroyed half of the house. The family were in a bomb shelter. They also had two small children & it really was awful.Then the mother & the new wife were in town & were driving back home when the bombing started again.It is a edge of your seat movie.

790584,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00011D1OU,Turfseer,"[6, 10]","Winston Churchill's favorite movie was ""Mrs. Miniver"" and I can see why. It's an American picture designed to create a deep bond between a formerly isolationist American public (recently thrust into war) with the British people (who had already been involved in World War II for two years). While it has many moving scenes, 'Mrs. Miniver' is also very uneven.The first half hour of the film is extremely slow-moving. We're introduced to the town of Belham with both its upper-class and lower middle-class characters. Henry Travers (famous for playing 'Clarence' in 'It's a Wonderful Life' five years later) plays Mr. Ballard, the kindly stationmaster who plans to enter his rose in an annual flower festival sponsored by Lady Beldon (he names the flower 'Mrs. Miniver' is honor of the title character who has been friendly with him in the village for years). Ballard is a rustic simpleton and Lady Beldon is the stuffy aristocrat who provide the 'comic' relief in the film. Suffice it to say that the conflict over the flower is probably the weakest (and most dated) aspect of the picture.And then there's Mrs. Miniver and her husband, Clem, who we're also introduced to during this opening sequence. The Minivers both feel guilty about spending money over budget--Mrs. Miniver worries about an expensive hat and Mr. Miniver is concerned about a new car he's purchased. They are the parents of two small but wonderful kids. Soon afterward, we discover that Mrs. Miniver has a son, Vin, who's a student at Oxford (the casting of the Richard Ney as the son seems a bit odd since Greer Garson doesn't look much older than him; in real life she was 11 years older and ironically they got married right after this picture was made--only to divorce five years later!). Vin is probably the most interesting of the family members as he has Socialist leanings and seems a bit of a hothead. Also in the mix is Lady Beldon's granddaughter, Carol, (played by a solid Theresa Wright), who comes over to see Mrs. Miniver who she hopes will persuade her good friend Ballard to drop out of the flower festival (and allow her grandmother to take the top prize, as she's done for the past thirty years).The film's inciting incident occurs when the Vicar makes his announcement to the townspeople during a Sunday morning service that England has declared war on Germany. The film then focuses on the townspeoples' response (and particularly how the Minivers react and contribute to the war effort). There are many memorable scenes. Clem Miniver gets a call to meet with the other middle-aged and older men in the town at 2:30 in the morning at a bar and then are called upon to take their boats and be part of the famous rescue of thousands of British soldiers on the beaches at Dunkirk (the scene where an 'armada' of small boats slowly moving out to sea is very impressive). And then there's Mrs. Miniver who ends up confronting a downed German flier inside her house while he brandishes a pistol (in a touch of pure propaganda, Mrs. Miniver slaps the soldier in the face during his ugly pro-Nazi diatribe!).The two most powerful scenes in the film correspond to the Act 2 Crisis and Act 3 Climax. The Crisis occurs when the Minivers huddle with their young children inside the bomb shelter at their house. There are no exterior visuals of the bombing raid itself. The focus is on the family's reaction as we hear the SOUND of the bombs falling. It's a powerful and unsettling scene since it reveals what it's like for ordinary people to be caught up in the horrors of war. The Climax is even more shocking. Throughout the film we're expecting that Vin (who is now an RAF pilot) will end up as the one who's killed. But as Mrs. Miniver and Carol (who now has married Vin) drive home after the flower festival during an air raid (with their headlights off to avoid detection), Carol is shot as one of the enemy planes flies low and strafes the area with gunfire. Mrs. Miniver cradles the dying Carol in her arms after she manages to get back to her house. The next day, they're about to tell their son Carol is dead but he already has heard. The townspeople gather for a memorial service and all note the sacrifice of various victims including Carol and the kindly Mr. Ballard. The town is transformed with the Vicar speaking on their behalf during his sermon. He echoes the townspeoples' collective determination to see the war effort through, eventually leading to victory.While the film is called ""Mrs. Miniver"", she feels incomplete as a character. There are long stretches in the film where the focus is not on Mrs. Miniver at all. Aside from her confrontation with the German pilot, most of her role focuses on nurturing family members.'Mrs. Miniver' served a vital function during World War II to boost the morale of the American public on the home front. If you're expecting on the other hand to see the kind of multi-dimensional characters found in a film like 'It's a Wonderful Life', you will be sadly disappointed. The powerful scenes of war along with its impact on ordinary people all but make up for the incomplete character studies proffered up by the film's screenwriters.",3,Dated but powerful World War II
