1032559,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000K7VHQY,,"[3, 3]","Keeping Mum is a 2005 comedy/crime/thriller/family drama/mystery but first and foremost, a British black comedy at its finest, subtle and the bizarre that stars Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rowan Atkinson, and Patrick Swayze. It is full of surprises, twists, and un-expected revelations. It's got sex, murders, and violence but they are handled in such hilariously proper way that I was amused and entertained all along. Among plenty of surprises, I'd love to mention two first. Rowan Atkinson has turned by the other side of his talent. His vicar Walter Goodfellow is a true good fellow, a nice quiet man who is so overwhelmed by demands of his job that and he fails to recognize some troubling realities in his own family. His wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas) is sexually frustrated, and starts an affair with her American golf instructor (Patrick Swayze) who is also drooling over Gloria and Walter's stunningly beautiful teenage daughter Holy ( In 2007, Tamsin Egerton was voted tenth of the one hundred most beautiful faces in the world, by IndependentCritics.com. - I can't agree more. She was another surprise in the movie). Holy is a bit too eager to explore her sexuality with a new boyfriend every week. The couple's pre-teen son Petye is a target of a group of bullies at school. Enters new housekeeper, amazing Grace Hawkins (Dame Maggie Smith), efficient, charming, and extraordinary loyal to Goodfellows and their wellbeing. She brings with her a huge trunk full of memories and some clothes, and the life in Goodfellow household will never be the same. Grace certainly knows how to take care of the persistent annoying problems and these who cause them.Maggie Smith is delightful in every single role I've seen her. Her incomparable ability to bring very unique humor, depth, and mannerism into her performances make her deservingly one of the best British actresses in history. Just watch Smith delivering the lines that she makes devilishly funny and incredibly amusing. Smith has been supported by very able cast. The story combines several genres interestingly enough for me to recommend this movie highly. But you have to be a fan of British comedies and British dry black humor and not to be offended by murders and adulteries as the subjects of a comedy.I did not know anything about the movie until my mom rented it from our local library (I love our library - the source of little known but often very enjoyable movies free of charge) and recommended it to me. It was a very nice surprise - just as it was for the viewers at 2006 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival where Keeping Mum received Film Discovery Jury Award.",4,I won't keep mum about this movie.,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,2642,"['Keeping', 'Mum', '2005', 'comedy/crime/thriller/family', 'drama/mystery', 'first', 'foremost', 'British', 'black', 'comedy', 'finest', 'subtle', 'bizarre', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'full', 'surprises', 'twists', 'un-expected', 'revelations', 'got', 'sex', 'murders', 'violence', 'are', 'handled', 'such', 'hilariously', 'proper', 'way', 'was', 'amused', 'entertained', 'along', 'plenty', 'surprises', ""'d"", 'love', 'mention', 'two', 'first', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'turned', 'other', 'side', 'talent', 'vicar', 'Walter', 'Goodfellow', 'true', 'good', 'fellow', 'nice', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'demands', 'job', 'recognize', 'troubling', 'realities', 'own', 'family', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'affair', 'American', 'golf', 'instructor', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'who', 'also', 'drooling', 'Gloria', 'Walter', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Holy', '2007', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'was', 'voted', 'tenth', 'one', 'hundred', 'most', 'beautiful', 'world', 'IndependentCritics.com', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'was', 'surprise', 'movie', 'Holy', 'bit', 'too', 'eager', 'explore', 'sexuality', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'week', 'couple', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'Petye', 'target', 'group', 'bullies', 'school', 'Enters', 'new', 'housekeeper', 'amazing', 'Grace', 'Hawkins', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'efficient', 'charming', 'extraordinary', 'loyal', 'Goodfellows', 'wellbeing', 'huge', 'trunk', 'full', 'memories', 'clothes', 'life', 'Goodfellow', 'household', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Grace', 'certainly', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'persistent', 'annoying', 'problems', 'who', 'cause', 'them.Maggie', 'Smith', 'delightful', 'single', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'incomparable', 'ability', 'bring', 'very', 'unique', 'humor', 'depth', 'mannerism', 'performances', 'make', 'deservingly', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'actresses', 'history', 'Just', 'watch', 'Smith', 'delivering', 'lines', 'devilishly', 'funny', 'incredibly', 'amusing', 'Smith', 'been', 'supported', 'very', 'able', 'cast', 'story', 'combines', 'several', 'genres', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'British', 'comedies', 'British', 'dry', 'black', 'humor', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'murders', 'adulteries', 'subjects', 'comedy.I', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'movie', 'mom', 'rented', 'local', 'library', 'love', 'library', 'source', 'little', 'known', 'often', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'free', 'charge', 'recommended', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'surprise', 'just', 'was', 'viewers', '2006', 'U.S', 'Comedy', 'Arts', 'Festival', 'where', 'Keeping', 'Mum', 'received', 'Film', 'Discovery', 'Jury', 'Award']",N/A

1032562,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B000K7VHQY,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[147, 148]","This is probably the most touching film about homicidal old ladies I have ever seen. Grace (Maggie Smith) is not your ordinary homicidal grandmother - she has a heart of gold. When she comes into the life of the Reverend of Little Wallop (Rowan Atkinson) she immediately takes a proprietorial interest in his family's wellbeing. Before long Grace is proactively sorting out a lot of family problems - the son's bullies, the daughter's awful boyfriends, the Reverend's lack of confidence and his wife's marital woes. At the same time, a number of people and animals that get in the way of Grace's plans start disappearing. She is so charmingly innocent and so completely well-intentioned that it is hard to hold her methods against her. In fact, I spent most of the film cheering for her. Grace is a very rare character indeed (the closest approximate I can think of is Angela from ""Sleepaway Camp II & III"" - possibly a younger variation of the same creature) and we need more like her.The film is undoubtedly aided by an excellent cast. The central character, the reverend's frustrated wife Gloria, is played by the very convincing (not to mention attractive) Kristin Scott Thomas who effectively carries most of the film. Maggie Smith is adorable as the innocently-menacing Grace. Patrick Swayze is perfect as the hunky lothario/sleazoid pursuing both Gloria and her daughter. Jeez, he aged well, and I think he was perfect for this part (which is sort of a compliment). Given first billing despite performing in what was essentially a supporting role,is Rowan Atkinson in probably his most subdued role ever as the Reverend of Little Wallop. Don't let that deter you if you're a fan. He still manages to be hilarious without having to lift a finger and when he does go into full comedy mode he is marvellous. However, it is his performance as the absent-minded workaholic vicar who seems helpless in the face of his unravelling marriage that is both touching and believable and demonstrates acting capabilities I would not have expected of him.In short, this is a very funny and sweet film that should not be missed.",5,Best Homicidal Old Lady Movie Ever!,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,2119,"['probably', 'most', 'touching', 'film', 'homicidal', 'old', 'ladies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Grace', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'not', 'ordinary', 'homicidal', 'grandmother', 'heart', 'gold', 'When', 'life', 'Reverend', 'Little', 'Wallop', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'immediately', 'proprietorial', 'interest', 'family', 'wellbeing', 'long', 'Grace', 'proactively', 'sorting', 'out', 'lot', 'family', 'problems', 'son', 'bullies', 'daughter', 'awful', 'boyfriends', 'Reverend', 'lack', 'confidence', 'wife', 'marital', 'woes', 'same', 'time', 'number', 'people', 'animals', 'get', 'way', 'Grace', 'plans', 'start', 'disappearing', 'so', 'charmingly', 'innocent', 'so', 'completely', 'well-intentioned', 'hard', 'hold', 'methods', 'fact', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'cheering', 'Grace', 'very', 'rare', 'character', 'indeed', 'closest', 'approximate', 'can', 'think', 'Angela', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'II', 'III', 'possibly', 'younger', 'variation', 'same', 'creature', 'need', 'more', 'her.The', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'aided', 'excellent', 'cast', 'central', 'character', 'reverend', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'played', 'very', 'convincing', 'not', 'mention', 'attractive', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', 'effectively', 'most', 'film', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'adorable', 'innocently-menacing', 'Grace', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'perfect', 'hunky', 'lothario/sleazoid', 'pursuing', 'Gloria', 'daughter', 'Jeez', 'aged', 'well', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'sort', 'compliment', 'Given', 'first', 'billing', 'performing', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'supporting', 'role', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'probably', 'most', 'subdued', 'role', 'ever', 'Reverend', 'Little', 'Wallop', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', ""'re"", 'fan', 'still', 'be', 'hilarious', 'having', 'lift', 'finger', 'when', 'go', 'full', 'comedy', 'mode', 'marvellous', 'However', 'performance', 'absent-minded', 'workaholic', 'vicar', 'who', 'helpless', 'face', 'unravelling', 'marriage', 'touching', 'believable', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'him.In', 'short', 'very', 'funny', 'sweet', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1032568,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000K7VHQY,Brendan M. Howard,"[4, 4]","British comedies about murderous old people snuffing out the unwitting or the deserving are legion. My first experience was the play ""Arsenic & Old Lace."" That black comedy returns in a fairly funny script bolstered by great performances in Keeping Mum.Smith plays new housekeeper Grace Hawkins, an evil Mary Poppins type who silences noisy animals the hard way and punishes the bullies of one of her charges, Petey, with judicious snips of important wires. The family enjoys her excellent advice and the sudden absence of annoyances in their lives. Atkinson plays an overly serious vicar who gets a chance to show off his acting skills as a kind man of God, but also fumbling as a not-too-cool or sexually vivacious husband. Scott Thomas is his dissastified wife on the verge of infidelity with an American golf instructor (Swayze). Son Petey is mostly incidental, but daughter Holly's issue is nymphomania and too many boyfriends.The heads roll as the comedy rolls on, but so do doses of pleasant humor and plenty of ways to sympathize with the odd Grace Hawkins, who may be crazy but also seems to love her newfound home and its inhabitants.This is nothing new, but it's old hat that will appeal to comedy fans. It's not completely family friendly, though. There's almost no grisly, despite the fact that deaths rack up, but there is some frontal nudity of the older daughter. And it may end sweetly, but the moral of the story is a bit twisted in this twisted family home.-- Brendan Howard",4,Forget Arsenic & Old Lace!

The beautiful and colorful photography is unusually exquisite and quite moving giving one moments of exhilaration and reflection on what beautiful wonders the world beholds for those that can grasp it and become one with it.

It is one of those little 'comedies' Sir Alec Guinness made endearing, comedy touched with the morbid, but allowing the completed meal to be wholly palatable.Opening with a note '43 years earlier' we see a charming and attractive young pregnant woman (Emilia Fox) boarding a train somewhere in England, her only odd characteristic is her large trunk which is seeping blood: the trunk contains the bodies of the girl's husband and mistress and she is carted off to detention.Jump to the present (or 43 years later) and in a little English village the Vicar, Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson) tends to his flock and is frustrated with writing a speech for a convention, paying more attention to his clerical duties than to his frustrated wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas), his philandering daughter Holly (the beautiful Tamsin Egerton) and his bullied son Petey (Toby Parkes).  Holly is having an affair with her lothario golf pro Lance (Patrick Swayze) and in general the family is disheveled - until they hire Grace Hawkins (the inimitable Maggie Smith) who takes up residence with them, her only possession being her 'trunk'.Grace has her own manner of taking care of distasteful issues: she simply eliminates them and throws them in a pond growing algae.  She gradually breaks the news that Holly, an orphan as a child, is the progeny of Grace's pregnancy when she was imprisoned and proceeds to correct the various messes the Goodfellow family has been facing: she peppers the Vicar's sermons with jokes, increasing his congregation and dispenses with the vicar's headache parishioner Mrs. Parker (Liz Smith); she renews the marital fidelity to Gloria and the Vicar, disposing of Lance; she handles the school problems of Petey and the boy problems of Holly. Her trunk ends up being a Pandora's Box for the village and the family!With a thoroughly delightful cast of pros, settings that are picture perfect, a script that always retains humor even in the most odd circumstances, and a musical score that underlines the flavor of the tale, KEEPING MUM  is a delight to watch.

Recommended by the Swedish branch of JayFlix, I finally got a look at it a couple of days ago.First of all, the cast:* Maggie Smith (&#34;Ladies in Lavender&#34; and &#34;Harry Potter&#34;) a just-paroled murderer, now hired as a housekeeper* Kristen Scott Thomas (&#34;The English Patient&#34; and &#34;The Horse Whisperer&#34;) a frustrated minister's wife* Rowan Atkinson (&#34;Four Weddings...&#34; and &#34;The Black Adder&#34;) the frustrating minister* Patrick Swayze (&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; and &#34;Ghost&#34;) a smarmy golf pro* Tamsin Egerton (I think she's new) a gorgeous young actress who is the minister's precocious daughter!The minister's family lives next door to an annoying neighbor who has a constantly yapping dog, Clarence. The minister is such an excruciatingly boring speaker, his wife stays in bed; she can't bear to sit through his sermons any more. He is totally oblivious to the catastrophe looming in his own family. An elderly member of the congregation has a chronic problem with the flower arranging committee...AND she's snoopy! The daughter is not only beautiful, she's promiscuous. The son is bullied by his classmates simply because he is the minister's son. The golf pro is on the make...all the time...Enter Grace, the newly hired housekeeper. In no time at all, she assesses the situation and starts to rectify things. Watching her kick into action is a treat, even though you will probably recoil from some of her methods.I will emphasize: This is a BLACK comedy, but it's fun just the same. These are great actors who play characters who run true to form and you can't help but cheer them on. Just remember to suspend disbelief!

Kristin Scott Thomas is his neglected wife, with a penchant for golf lessons from the legend-in-his-own-mind golf pro, Patrick Swayze. In their busy domestic lives comes a treasure of a housekeeper, Maggie Smith, helping not only the parents but their children as well, to learn to live life ""with a little grace"".  Smoothing out the ""wrinkles"" of barking dogs, nosey neighbors, demanding parrishioners, golfing Lotharios, and the occasional pond inspectors, is all in a day's work. A heart warming if surprising twist at the end make this a truly endearing movie. A couple incidents of brief nudity, and violence heard but not fully seen, gives this a PG rating. I watched it twice to catch all the little clues I'd missed the first time when I was laughing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and recommend it highly.

1032609,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000K7VHQY,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[12, 13]","Although she's had a long and wonderful career, I'm guessing that most Americans will recognize Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagal from the ""Harry Potter"" films.  A few may recall her time in films like ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" and the ""Sister Act"" films.  Heck, if you go back as far as I do, you might remember her from ""Clash of the Titans.""  It's no matter, because she is simply hilarious and twisted in ""Keeping Mum,"" where she plays a loving housekeeper with a very effective and final way of cleaning things up.  The film begins with a little bit of background on Smith's character and then hurtles forty-three years into modern times where we get to meet the Goodfellow family.  The head of the family is Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), a well-meaning but ultimately dull and clueless vicar of the local church in Little Wallop.  His wife, Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas), is in search of a little more ""action"" in her life.  His daughter, Holly (Tamsin Egerton), is something of a slut and his son, Petey (Toby Parkes) is constantly harassed at school by bullies.When Grace Hawkins (Smith) strolls into Little Wallop to take a job as the Goodfellow's housekeeper, things begin to oddly change for the better.  The vicar is suddenly inspired to write a funny keynote address for an upcoming conference.  Holly turns off the oven in the bedroom and discovers the joys of baking.  Petey becomes unafraid of his cruel schoolmates.  The only person still somewhat unaffected by the arrival of Grace is Gloria, although she does begin to sleep through the night with more ease due to some devious acts.Gloria is still seeking out that ""something"" that's missing from her relationship with her husband.  She thinks she finds it blossoming in a secret relationship with her American golf instructor, Lance.  Lance is played to sleazy perfection by Patrick Swayze.  As Grace becomes more involved with Gloria's predicament, things get devilishly fun.  From lewd phone calls to video cameras, Grace has her hands full trying to save the Goodfellows' marriage.Atkinson is perhaps most familiar to U.S. audiences as the bungling ""Mr. Bean"" or the devious ""Black Adder.""  Both were often featured on PBS and ""Mr. Bean"" was turned into a mildly successful theatrical release in America.  Atkinson was also the voice of ""Zazoo"" in ""The Lion King,"" as well as having bit roles in a number of other American comedies.  Thomas has been in a few films here in the U.S., but they escape my memory right now.  Swayze, of course, is Swayze.  If you grew up in the U.S. during the 80's or even 90's, you know who he is.  All of the cast do a wonderful job.There is a bit of strong language, especially from the mouth of Thomas.  There's also a tad bit of toplessness from Holly and some sexuality (though no nudity) involving Thomas and Swayze and even Thomas and Atkinson (Mr. Bean scores!).  There's also a few moments where a sweet old lady whacks a few people, so the ""R"" rating is necessary.  Don't let your kids watch this film.  Other than that, this is a great dark comedy for folks of the suggested viewing age.Although you'll often shake your head and declare that you shouldn't laugh, it's just too hard not to as Smith carries out her quiet, lethal plans to clean up the mess that is the Goodfellow family.  She has good reason to as well, but even though it's pretty obvious from the start of the film, I won't reveal why.  Her nanny-like precision of making sure things turn out right make for a hilarious film, and I really recommend that fans of Smith, Atkinson, or anyone else in the flick should check this movie out.Highly recommended.",4,The Wonderful Maggie Smith Swaps Her Broomstick For A Shovel,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,3673,"['had', 'long', 'wonderful', 'career', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'most', 'Americans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Professor', 'McGonagal', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'few', 'may', 'recall', 'time', 'films', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'Sister', 'Act', 'films', 'Heck', 'go', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'do', 'might', 'remember', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'matter', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'twisted', 'Keeping', 'Mum', 'where', 'loving', 'housekeeper', 'very', 'effective', 'final', 'way', 'cleaning', 'things', 'up', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'Smith', 'character', 'then', 'forty-three', 'years', 'modern', 'times', 'where', 'get', 'meet', 'Goodfellow', 'family', 'head', 'family', 'Reverend', 'Walter', 'Goodfellow', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'well-meaning', 'ultimately', 'dull', 'clueless', 'vicar', 'local', 'church', 'Little', 'Wallop', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'search', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'life', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'something', 'slut', 'son', 'Petey', 'Toby', 'Parkes', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'school', 'bullies.When', 'Grace', 'Hawkins', 'Smith', 'Little', 'Wallop', 'take', 'job', 'Goodfellow', 'housekeeper', 'things', 'begin', 'oddly', 'change', 'better', 'vicar', 'suddenly', 'inspired', 'write', 'funny', 'keynote', 'address', 'upcoming', 'conference', 'Holly', 'off', 'oven', 'bedroom', 'joys', 'baking', 'Petey', 'unafraid', 'cruel', 'schoolmates', 'only', 'person', 'still', 'somewhat', 'unaffected', 'arrival', 'Grace', 'Gloria', 'begin', 'sleep', 'night', 'more', 'ease', 'due', 'devious', 'acts.Gloria', 'still', 'seeking', 'out', 'something', 'missing', 'relationship', 'husband', 'blossoming', 'secret', 'relationship', 'American', 'golf', 'instructor', 'Lance', 'Lance', 'played', 'sleazy', 'perfection', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Grace', 'more', 'involved', 'Gloria', 'predicament', 'things', 'get', 'devilishly', 'fun', 'lewd', 'phone', 'video', 'cameras', 'Grace', 'hands', 'full', 'trying', 'save', 'Goodfellows', 'marriage.Atkinson', 'perhaps', 'most', 'familiar', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'bungling', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'devious', 'Black', 'Adder', 'were', 'often', 'featured', 'PBS', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'was', 'turned', 'mildly', 'successful', 'theatrical', 'release', 'America', 'Atkinson', 'was', 'also', 'voice', 'Zazoo', 'Lion', 'King', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'bit', 'roles', 'number', 'other', 'American', 'comedies', 'Thomas', 'been', 'few', 'films', 'here', 'U.S.', 'escape', 'memory', 'right', 'now', 'Swayze', 'course', 'Swayze', 'grew', 'up', 'U.S.', '80', 'even', '90', 'know', 'who', 'cast', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job.There', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'especially', 'mouth', 'Thomas', 'also', 'tad', 'bit', 'toplessness', 'Holly', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'involving', 'Thomas', 'Swayze', 'even', 'Thomas', 'Atkinson', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'also', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'sweet', 'old', 'lady', 'few', 'people', 'R', 'rating', 'necessary', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'film', 'Other', 'great', 'dark', 'comedy', 'folks', 'suggested', 'viewing', ""'ll"", 'often', 'shake', 'head', 'declare', 'should', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'not', 'Smith', 'out', 'quiet', 'lethal', 'plans', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'Goodfellow', 'family', 'good', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'start', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'why', 'nanny-like', 'precision', 'making', 'sure', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'make', 'hilarious', 'film', 'really', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Smith', 'Atkinson', 'anyone', 'else', 'flick', 'should', 'check', 'movie', 'out.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","The 2005 dark British comedy ""Keeping Mum"", directed by Niall Johnson, is the strange tale indeed: the wife of Vicar Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), named Gloria Goodfellow (Kristin Scott Thomas), is not particularly happy with her marriage.  Being swooned by her professional, American golf instructor, the sleezy Lance (Patrick Swayze), Gloria considers running away with him while her teenage daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton) has more temporary boyfriends than she or her husband can remember and her son Peter (Toby Parkes) is being tormented by a group of bullies at school.  Things begin to change, though, with the arrival of their new nanny, Grace Hawkins (the incomparable Maggie Smith), who travels with a large, old trunk.  The contents of the mysterious trunk has little in common with the belongings that Mary Poppins or Nanny McPhee traveled with, but Grace does have some unusual abilities that (unlike Mary Poppins or Nanny McPhee) don't involve any magic.  One day, the old neighbor's dog and its annoying & incessant barking mysteriously disappear; the bullies at school receive an unhappy surprise; and Lance stops answering his phone.  How can this be?  Grace helps the Vicar find his lost humor and get an entirely new view of the ""Song of Solomon"".  Everything seems to be going quite well until, one evening, Holly sees a bizarre story on the news about a recently released convict named Rosie Jones (Emilia Fox) who served 40 years in prison for two brutal murders and an old trunk.With excellent acting, an intriguing story and engaging characters, ""Keeping Mum"" is very entertaining and well-done film. No doubt Maggie Smith very much enjoyed portraying Grace after playing Professor McGonagall in five (to date) Harry Potter films and many may remember Kristin Scott Thomas from her role in the 1996 film ""The English Patient"" that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  Overall, my rating for the 2005 dark comedy ""Keeping Mum"" is 4 out of 5 stars and is highly recommended.  Other notable characters in the film included Mrs. Parker (Liz Smith, who played the hilarious character of Letitia Cropley during the first season of ""The Vicar of Dibley"" in 1994) and the two pond workmen (Patrick Monckton and Rowley Irlam).",4,An Entertaining Dark Comedy starring Maggie Smith,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2261,"['2005', 'dark', 'British', 'comedy', 'Keeping', 'Mum', 'directed', 'Niall', 'Johnson', 'strange', 'tale', 'indeed', 'wife', 'Vicar', 'Walter', 'Goodfellow', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'named', 'Gloria', 'Goodfellow', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'not', 'particularly', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Being', 'swooned', 'professional', 'American', 'golf', 'instructor', 'sleezy', 'Lance', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Gloria', 'running', 'away', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'more', 'temporary', 'boyfriends', 'husband', 'can', 'remember', 'son', 'Peter', 'Toby', 'Parkes', 'being', 'tormented', 'group', 'bullies', 'school', 'Things', 'begin', 'change', 'arrival', 'new', 'nanny', 'Grace', 'Hawkins', 'incomparable', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'large', 'old', 'trunk', 'contents', 'mysterious', 'trunk', 'little', 'common', 'belongings', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'traveled', 'Grace', 'have', 'unusual', 'abilities', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'magic', 'One', 'day', 'old', 'neighbor', 'dog', 'annoying', 'incessant', 'barking', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'bullies', 'school', 'receive', 'unhappy', 'surprise', 'Lance', 'answering', 'phone', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'Grace', 'Vicar', 'find', 'lost', 'humor', 'get', 'entirely', 'new', 'view', 'Song', 'Solomon', 'Everything', 'be', 'going', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'evening', 'Holly', 'bizarre', 'story', 'news', 'recently', 'released', 'convict', 'named', 'Rosie', 'Jones', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'who', 'served', '40', 'years', 'prison', 'two', 'brutal', 'murders', 'old', 'trunk.With', 'excellent', 'acting', 'intriguing', 'story', 'engaging', 'characters', 'Keeping', 'Mum', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well-done', 'film', 'doubt', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'portraying', 'Grace', 'playing', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'five', 'date', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'many', 'may', 'remember', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'role', '1996', 'film', 'English', 'Patient', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Overall', 'rating', '2005', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Keeping', 'Mum', '4', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Other', 'notable', 'characters', 'film', 'included', 'Mrs.', 'Parker', 'Liz', 'Smith', 'who', 'played', 'hilarious', 'character', 'Letitia', 'Cropley', 'first', 'season', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', '1994', 'two', 'pond', 'workmen', 'Patrick', 'Monckton', 'Rowley', 'Irlam']",N/A

Enjoying the film requires, above all, the willingness to laugh at murder. Early drafts of the screenplay were written by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Richard Russo. Niall Johnson produced the final script and directs the film. In the English village of Little Wallop, the Vicar, Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), is indeed a good fellow, attentive to his parishioners, serious about his job, but perhaps a little dull. His neglected and frustrated wife Gloria (Kristen Scott Thomas) considers turning to her obnoxious American golf instructor (Patrick Swayze) for affection and respite from the dramas of her bullied son and wanton daughter (Tamsin Egerton). But the family's problems begin to turn around with the arrival of a new housekeeper, Miss Grace Hawkins (Maggie Smith), a very proper elderly lady with an unusual sense of ethics.It took me a while to get into this film, and my ability to do so at all is on account of the cast, not the story. ""Keeping Mum"" is a very British, straightforward black comedy, where the bodies pile up as the family comes together. Grace Hawkins' matter-of-fact social pathology has a certain gruesome charm. When she disapproves of someone, she does the obvious -to the horror of the normal folk around her. The characters are believable enough, but perhaps not quite likable enough to make this great comedy. ""Keeping Mum"" is pleasant enough entertainment -if you don't find the body count too unpleasant.The DVD (ThinkFilms 2007): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 min), 11 deleted scenes, outtakes and bloopers (6 min), an extended version of the soccer game scene (2 min), an alternative opening ""Rosie Jones"" sequence (not as interesting as the one that made the final cut) with optional director's commentary (3 min), and an audio commentary by director and co-writer Niall Johnson. This is a pretty good non-stop commentary in which Johnson talks about the 5-year history of the production, the 2 different opening sequences, production design, locations, performances, camera work, and what was left in or taken out and why.

1032626,APHX2A37KDRAH,B000K7VHQY,N. Trachta,"[3, 3]","Keeping Mum is the nice quiet story of Reverend Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson) and his totally dysfunctional family.  Reverend Goodfellow is absorbed in the community, sacrificing his family for the community.  Gloria Goodfellow (Kristin Scott Thomas) is the reverends wife and is totally frustrated that her husband is absorbed in his work; so much that she's taking up golf and has a sleazy golf instructor (Patrick Swayze).  Reverend Goodfellow's kids, Holly and Petey are almost cut from the Kelly and Bud Bundy mold; the young tramp and the young dweb whom everyone picks on.  To help this family correct itself a housekeeper is brought in (Grace, played by Maggie Smith) with a little bit of a background, she kind of murdered her husband and his lover when she a young twenty something bride.My Likes:The characters are so strong in this one and how couldn't they be with this cast.  Rowan Atkinson is on top of his game.  This is no Mr. Bean or Blackadder.  Instead this is more like an older Father Gerald (Four Weddings and a Funeral) who's married and settled in the country.  Rowan Atkinson sells the reverend who's forgotten his family for his job so well.  Equally of interest is how well we see Reverend Goodfellow learn about his family and religion with humor from Grace.Maggie Smith is outstanding as Grace.  She enables family see their problems and come together so well.  Of particular interest is the length's she'll go to keep the family together.  After all, it's hard to get over old habits...Patrick Swayze sells the greasy American golf pro that's trying to take advantage of his female students so well!  He uses sexual innuendos, pressure, promises, and a humorous male G-string.  It's almost as if he was born for the role.Kristin Scott Thomas does and excellent job playing the wife who's tired of her husband ignoring her for work.  She doesn't want to have an affair, but it seems to be the only way she'll have attention paid to her and maybe get rid of the annoying neighbors and the dog that yaps.My Dislikes:The movie is generally very strong.  Two slight weaknesses are that Kristin doesn't seem fully engaged in parts of the movie and Petey is sort of cleaned up and left out of the back half.  In Kristin's case I interrupt the lack of engagement to be because she's bored with her husband and wants some spice.The Rating:A very solid 4 star movie (going toward 5 stars!).  The plot is fun and engrossing.  The humor is a chuckler, not a belly-roarer.  Things have been nicely cut together to make this a nice cosy for people to enjoy on a quiet night.  The actors come across as real people, no one person totally dominating the scene; however the two main ones are Gloria learning about her family and Grace helping her and the family.  There are several nice surprises that are pulled out of the steamer trunk that make for an excellent show that's entertaining.  Sexual content is medium; there are several scenes' where sex is implied and/or a body part is seen.  No matter, this is an excellent black comedy.",4,How to keep Mum and enjoy it!,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,3051,"['Keeping', 'Mum', 'nice', 'quiet', 'story', 'Reverend', 'Goodfellow', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Reverend', 'Goodfellow', 'absorbed', 'community', 'sacrificing', 'family', 'community', 'Gloria', 'Goodfellow', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'reverends', 'wife', 'totally', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'absorbed', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'taking', 'up', 'golf', 'sleazy', 'golf', 'instructor', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Reverend', 'Goodfellow', 'kids', 'Holly', 'Petey', 'are', 'almost', 'cut', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'Bundy', 'mold', 'young', 'tramp', 'young', 'dweb', 'whom', 'everyone', 'help', 'family', 'correct', 'housekeeper', 'brought', 'Grace', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'kind', 'murdered', 'husband', 'lover', 'when', 'young', 'twenty', 'something', 'bride.My', 'Likes', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'one', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'cast', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'top', 'game', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Blackadder', 'Instead', 'more', 'older', 'Father', 'Gerald', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'who', 'married', 'settled', 'country', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'reverend', 'who', 'forgotten', 'family', 'job', 'so', 'well', 'Equally', 'interest', 'how', 'well', 'see', 'Reverend', 'Goodfellow', 'learn', 'family', 'religion', 'humor', 'Grace.Maggie', 'Smith', 'outstanding', 'Grace', 'family', 'see', 'problems', 'come', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'particular', 'interest', 'length', ""'ll"", 'go', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'hard', 'get', 'old', 'habits', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'greasy', 'American', 'golf', 'pro', 'trying', 'take', 'advantage', 'female', 'students', 'so', 'well', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'pressure', 'promises', 'humorous', 'male', 'G-string', 'almost', 'was', 'born', 'role.Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'wife', 'who', 'tired', 'husband', 'ignoring', 'work', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'affair', 'be', 'only', 'way', ""'ll"", 'have', 'attention', 'paid', 'maybe', 'get', 'rid', 'annoying', 'neighbors', 'dog', 'Dislikes', 'movie', 'generally', 'very', 'strong', 'Two', 'slight', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'Kristin', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fully', 'engaged', 'parts', 'movie', 'Petey', 'sort', 'cleaned', 'up', 'left', 'back', 'half', 'Kristin', 'case', 'interrupt', 'lack', 'engagement', 'be', 'bored', 'husband', 'spice.The', 'Rating', 'very', 'solid', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'going', '5', 'stars', 'plot', 'fun', 'engrossing', 'humor', 'chuckler', 'not', 'belly-roarer', 'Things', 'have', 'been', 'nicely', 'cut', 'together', 'make', 'nice', 'cosy', 'people', 'enjoy', 'quiet', 'night', 'actors', 'come', 'real', 'people', 'one', 'person', 'totally', 'dominating', 'scene', 'however', 'two', 'main', 'ones', 'are', 'Gloria', 'learning', 'family', 'Grace', 'helping', 'family', 'are', 'several', 'nice', 'surprises', 'are', 'pulled', 'steamer', 'trunk', 'make', 'excellent', 'show', 'entertaining', 'Sexual', 'content', 'medium', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'sex', 'implied', 'body', 'part', 'seen', 'matter', 'excellent', 'black', 'comedy']",N/A

Ancient Mrs. Parker suspects there is a conspiracy afoot  in the church Flower Arranging Committee to overturn her leadership. The local football club is so desperate to field a team to compete with the neighboring village that it has placed the entirely unathletic church vicar between the goal posts. Nasty algae have invaded the pond behind the vicar's house that have baffled local health authorities and turned the pond, like Little Wallop itself, into a murky uninviting stew whose continued existence is questionable.The swirling tensions in the tired little town are lost on earnest, well-meaning and distracted Reverend Goodfellow whose serious mind is absorbed by the challenge of composing the speech he must deliver to a convention of religious colleagues on the subject of ""God's Mysterious Ways"". He is unaware that his exasperated, sex-starved wife, exhausted by the sleepless nights caused by Mr. Brown's dog, is about to run away to Mexico with a panting American golf pro, or that his over-ripe daughter is a nympho who will couple with any boy registering a pulse, or that his adolescent son is daily tormented by school bullies.The situation looks hopelessly clogged until the arrival of Grace, the Goodfellows' new housekeeper, a protective, practical, problem-solving, paroled murderer.""Keeping Mum"" puts the lie to the lament that there are few good film roles for women or elderly actors. The British seem to have no trouble finding supple scripts to keep their seniors in front of the camera. Octogenarian Liz Smith is the paranoid Mrs. Parker and septuagenarian Maggie Smith is sharp and clear-eyed as the homicidal housekeeper who keeps finding uses for the dark pond behind the house. A buttoned-down Rowan Atkinson and a feverish Kristin Scott Thomas are the preoccupied reverend and his at-wit's-end wife. Patrick Swayze is suitably creepy as the lecherous American.

Rowan Atkinson is the subdued and uninspired vicar, rendered all the more potently comic by limited opportunities for 'Beanerismic' behaviour; once with gangling limbs akimbo as goalie in a local soccer match.

She puts a spring in everyone's step. She lightens the way for the clergyman to inject some humor into his sermons. She erases the sullen rebelliousness of the teenage daughter. Her presence averts a flirtation that was on the verge of turning into an actual adultery that would have destroyed the family. She awakens husband and wife to each other again romantically.But all these good things come at what price? The body count begins to climb, and other people get in on the act - doing good by doing bad.I didn't get any real guffaws from this movie. The British do have a fine tradition of making light of a little judicious homicide. Classic examples of this genre include the hilarious ""Naked Truth"" starring Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas, and  ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" starring Alec Guinness. This film isn't in that class. Perhaps part of the problem here is that some of the deaths are undeserved and almost incidental. It's hard to laugh at the deaths of virtual passersby.Still, this movie will bring a glow and a smile. Rowan Atkinson is wonderful as the clergyman who is opened up to life's possibilities. He has a few scenes that evoke his old Mr. Bean buffoonery. But for the most part, he displays a broad range of subtle, very human longings. His rekindled interest in his wife is reminiscent of the magic that transforms the couples in ""Enchanted April,"" the memorable romance starring Joan Plowright and Jim Broadbent.So the nature of the mayhem here might muffle some of the potential laughs.

It's also not for those who need prat falls and physical humor - I wouldn't call this a 'laugh-out-loud' movie, more of a quiet chuckle and an 'oh-ho!' type.Everything about this movie is subtle and subdued, and many may find it boring and slow.

1032641,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000K7VHQY,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 3]","Keeping Mum is a charmingly sweet story cleverly wrapped in a black comedy, with a dark plot about murder and strong undertones of family love and responsibility. Director and screenwriter Niall Johnson manages to pull it all together in a delightful way that will leave most audience members glad they watched, especially once they realize the pun in the title.The film starts out 43 years ago on a train. We're introduced to Rosie Jones (a charming Emilia Fox), a smiling, gentle, very pregnant young lady... with a trunk in the train's storage compartment that is seeping blood. When she's turned in to the by the police by a suspicious porter she freely admits that her husband and his lover, or at least the remaining pieces of them, are in the trunk. When one officer asks why she did it, she casually responds ""Well, I couldn't very well sit idly by, could I?"" Cut to a courtroom where a judge locks her away in an insane asylum.The audience is then introduced to the Goodfellow family (present day) and the rural English village of Little Wallop. Walter Goodfellow, the town vicar (subtly played by Rowan Atkinson of Mr. Bean fame), is so caught up in his sermons and the nagging members of his congregation that his home life is slipping away from him. His wife Gloria (the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas) is having an affair with her golf instructor (Patrick Swayze in a hilarious role that feels like it was written just for him), his daughter Holly is coming home with a different boyfriend every other day, and his son is getting bullied at school. Enter Grace Hawkins.Maggie Smith enters the scene as a renamed, aged Rosie Jones, who believes the best way to solve your problems is to get rid of them, literally. In a slightly twisted, darkly hilarious version of Mary Poppins, Maggie Smith comes to the Goodfellow family as a maid and nanny and in her own way starts to straighten things up. Her antics may be a tad outlandish, but in their own strange way, they're just what the Goodfellow family needs: a touch of Grace.The acting is top knotch, the humor is decidedly British and dark, and every joke delivers. Patrick Swayze really stands out in a cast of Brits as the libidinized Texas golf instructor trying to seduce the vicar's wife and spy on the vicar's daughter. Throwing himself into the role with reckless abandon shows Swayze's comedic timing and adds an extra layer to the British humor.The DVD includes several special features, including feature commentary by the director, a rather dry blooper reel, quite a few deleted scenes (I mean ""bonus"" scenes), and an extended scene of Rowan Atkinson as a soccer goalie that may be the funniest part of the DVD.

The movie begins with a young pregnant woman aboard a train in some part of England who also happens to be hiding something else in the trunk she brings along on the journey. Well, not to give too much away, she ends up incarcerated in an institution and fast forward years later to the tiny village of Little Wallop [population 57]. There's a steadfast vicar [played by Rowan Atkinson], his unsatisfied wife Gloria Goodfellow[Kristin Scott Thomas playing an uncharacteristic frumpy housewife], his teen nymphomaniac daughter Holly [Tamsin Egerton], and his young son Petey [Toby Parkes] who is prone to being bullied at school. There's also a golf instructor [Patrick Swayze] who is only too willing to provide 'comfort' to Gloria.Enter housekeeper Grace Hawkins [Dame Maggie Smith] who literally appears out of the blue but very quickly charms her way into the family and very efficiently takes care of each family member's problems, literally 'dispatching' the annoyances in a quick manner.The standout performance here is definitely Dame Maggie Smith's homicidal housekeeper. She is so lovable in her role that you actually empathise with her and find her victims the true annoyances that they are! Kristin Scott Thomas' jaded and sexually unsatisfied housewife is also very credible as she indulges in little sexual escapades with her golf instructor whilst still finding herself in love with her humorless husband. Patrick Swayze's Lance the sleaze is very much in character as he not only lusts after the viacr's wife, but has lecherous intentions towards young Holly as well. Rowan Atkinson, though in a minor role here, plays the hapless and boring vicar very well, with his reading of the Song of Solomon being the highlight of his performance here [it even got me a bit hot under the collar!].This is a dark comedy that may not elicit too many laughs, yet is well put-together and the acting effectively carries the movie through.
