You can also see the device type by looking at the kind of TV system supported (PAL=Europe or NTSC=USA or both). If the NTSC is present , this is the supplimentary indication for ""multizone"" or ""no zone"".The second posibility is to go with your dvd device to a laboratory to upload the ""multizone"" posibility on your device. It is a simple procedure that is made by any authorised specialist , it is a codec program like on your computer.The other posibility is transfering the dvd thru a specialist that can put the dvd from the PAL format to the NTSC format , preserving and according to the copywrite laws.Success !!!",5,pal (european ) format - answer,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,1032,"['have', 'problems', 'USA', 'DVD', 'PAL', 'formatI', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'Europe', 'USA', 'format', 'so', 'learned', 'are', 'DVD', 'devices', 'have', 'indication', 'MULTIZONE', 'ZONE', 'DVD', 'devices', 'can', 'play', 'also', 'zone', '1', 'USA', 'also', 'zone', '2', '0', 'EUROPE', 'can', 'track', 'dvd', 'devices', 'looking', 'technical', 'revew', 'written', 'dvd', 'device', 'multizone', 'zone', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'device', 'type', 'looking', 'kind', 'TV', 'system', 'supported', 'PAL=Europe', 'NTSC=USA', 'NTSC', 'present', 'supplimentary', 'indication', 'multizone', 'zone', '.The', 'second', 'posibility', 'go', 'dvd', 'device', 'laboratory', 'upload', 'multizone', 'posibility', 'device', 'simple', 'procedure', 'made', 'authorised', 'specialist', 'codec', 'program', 'computer.The', 'other', 'posibility', 'transfering', 'dvd', 'specialist', 'can', 'put', 'dvd', 'PAL', 'format', 'NTSC', 'format', 'preserving', 'according', 'copywrite', 'laws.Success']",N/A

So I sent it back. They were very nice about it and  ordered others. But I do hope that they could convert the movie to work on our regular DVD player. Or put it back on regular tv as a minseries again. I think it would be a big hit. It was a real good movie, many years ago.",5,Wush it I could see it again !

Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[0, 0]","""Delie and Brenton"" was the German title for ""All the Rivers run"" and German TV did not air the sequel :(.I'm glad it's finally available on DVD and fortunately with a multi regional DVD player it's no problem to be watched in the US as well. I wonder why there still is no system worldwide available for DVD's, so that they can be watched all over the planet no matter what continent you happen to live.I watched this Australian TV series first on German TV, then read the novel by Nancy Cato on which it's based.This was for sure one of my favorite Australian TV shows, but ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" and ""The Magic Boomerang"" (mid sixties) were even better. I wish both would be relased on DVD as well!!!
