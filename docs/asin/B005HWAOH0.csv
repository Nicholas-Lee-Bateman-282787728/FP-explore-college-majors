Along the lines of Murder She Wrote and Colombo, they open the movie showing you the murder and most of the clues. the events of which unfold as the story develops. The suspense is often found in the questioning of how it was done and by whom. And there is little blood and gore seen.  The only real drawback is the fact that Barry Van Dyke is not the actor his father is.

I hope it's not a bad sign that it's due out in a few days and still has no image available.But anyway. This is one of the greatest shows ever, and it's just wrong that they released 3 of 8 seasons and just stopped. We will hope that the fact that they are releasing these five movies means they will release the remaining seasons.Out of the first three movies, ""Diagnosis of Murder,"" ""House on Sycamore Street,"" and ""Twist of the Knife,"" before the series started, I always enjoyed ""Twist of the Knife"" the most. I thought Suzanne Pleshette was such a cute match for Dick Van Dyke. As anyone who loved the show knows, they never got a girlfriend for Mark Sloan! Off the top of my head, there were 2 episodes that ended with ""let's try a relationship"" moments, but they never panned out. I guess Mark was just too busy being a doctor AND a detective.After the series ended, they aired the final two movies, ""Town Without Pity"" and ""Without Warning."" ""Town Without Pity"" was excellent, even if it was heartbreaking. I think that one would have been an amazing finale. ""Without Warning,"" while good, was more like just a regular, average (though double-length) episode. But then again, maybe that's why they did it. After the sadness of the first one, everything needed to get back to normal.I miss this show, and shows like it. Crime dramas today... all they do is butcher people so they can show off how great they are at analyzing microscopic DNA evidence. Before, they used their brains to solve crimes.In the meantime, read Lee Goldberg's Diagnosis Murder novels. He was one of the writers for the show so they're pretty great.",5,Yay!
