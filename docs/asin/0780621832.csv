The yellow ribbon in the title refers to a tradition that the girls would wear a yellow ribbon to indicate that they were faithful to a lover in the cavalry. But the girl in the story manages to get three men to each believe the ribbon is for him. Neat trick, the little hussy!Anyway, John Wayne plays an officer who is one week away from retirement as the movie opens. He was actually pretty young at the time, but the makeup people did such a credible job that he really looks like he really did look when he got old -- except, as I recall, he was heavier than in this movie.The movie opens with a narrator who says ""Custer is dead."" This was the news of the day, and the Indians are teaming up, all the different tribes -- at least the young warriors -- to fight the white man, because the buffalo came back as Custer died, so they figured it was a sign from the Great Spirit. You know, when these religious fanatics take a notion . . .Anyway, the thing is a pretty typical cavalry versus Indians, with Wayne taking time out to talk to an old friend, one of the chiefs, who explains that he cannot control the young bucks because they don't listen to him anymore, since they got this sign from the Great Spirit. Nevertheless, Wayne and his soldiers (in the last hour or so of his command) stampede the Indian's horses right through their village and so make it impossible for them to make war.Frankly, I don't believe it.

30610,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,0780621832,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","In ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", John Wayne played an aging US Cavalry officer on the verge of retirement. There is one catch. An Indian uprising has started, and it threatens to put him out in the graveyard instead of out to pasture.This film has a surprisingly deep story, with a lot of heart. It is very likely one of Wayne's best acting performances. A young Ben Johnson plays an important role in the story, and really shows why his star would shine in Westerns for decades to come.The framing of western vistas is John Ford perfect. The direction of the few small unit cavalry actions comes across as sensible and accurate. These are professional soldiers doing their job the best way they know how. They aren't heroes ... unless pushed to it by exigent events. The serious tension in the film is released through truly humorous scenes from time to time in expert manner. That is a dying technique in Hollywood. Now tension releases of the humorous sort are as likely to be just plain silly (I reference any of several James Bond films), or even worse, to not come at all ... as in the otherwise excellent but devastatingly fatiguing Dark Knight.Most surprisingly, John Wayne's brave, heroic last ditch effort to solve the situation doesn't really work out. We're left at the end of the film knowing that there is still a lot of work to be done. No deus ex machina made everyone safe. That's a very different bit of plotting for a western from that era.If you're a fan of older westerns and have somehow missed this one, its time to check it out. Many regard ""The Searchers"" to be the best combination of John Ford directing and John Wayne acting.

As he slowly removes his spectacles, wipes  them off and then reads the sentiment, you really see that Wayne may not  have had the greatest range of any actor, but he was a great actor in the  right role. His characterization of Captain Nathan Brittles is near the top  of the list in all-time Duke performances.I've seen this movie 30 times  or more and never weary of it.

30620,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,0780621832,Chrijeff,"[2, 3]","The second part of Ford's ""Cavalry Trilogy"" (and the only one that was filmed in color) finds John Wayne playing, as he did the year before inRed River, a man of mature years (he was only 42 at the time).  It's 1876, and the Custer fight took place only about four months ago, rousing the tribes to a patriotic fury against the white man.  Capt. Nathan Brittles has been a soldier for 40 years, ever since he left his father's Indiana farm as a barefoot kid.  For the past nine of those years he has served at Fort Starke, ably sided by Top Sergeant Quincannon (Victor McLaglen), who has been at his side at least since the Civil War, and cared for the graves of his family--his wife and two young daughters perished, probably of one of the diseases that frequently scourged the Indian-fighting army, in the first year of his sojourn there.  Now, five days before his retirement, he is ordered to head up a final patrol, accompanied by his two dependable sergeants, Quincannon and Tyree (Ben Johnson), of whom the latter was a Captain in the Confederate forces, and his two lieutenants, Flint Cohill (John Agar), the son of a general, who has been at Starke as long as himself, and Ross Pennell (Harry Carey, Jr.), a ""spoiled rich kid"" who's seen only four years of service and plans to resign as soon as possible.  These two are engaged in a rivalry over Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), the visiting niece of Abby ""Old Ironpants"" Allshard (Mildred Natwick), whose husband Mac (George O'Brien) commands the post.  But with the Indian situation about to come to a boil, Maj. Allshard is resolved to send both Olivia and her aunt back to the East for the winter, and Brittles is unwillingly saddled with getting them to Sudreau's Wells to catch the stage.  A murdered and robbed paymaster, a sinister Indian agent who sells rifles to the hostiles on the side (watch for Paul Fix in a small role as his interpreter), and old sectional feelings (several of Brittles's C Troop are former Confederates, including ""Trooper John Smith,"" once known as Brig.

Familiar Ford faces include Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen, and Harry Carey, Jr, along with George O'Brien (Fort Apache), Mildred Natwick (The Quiet Man), Arthur Shields (The Quiet Man), Joanne Dru (Red River) and John Agar (Fort Apache). Wayne plays a cavalry captain about to grudgingly start retirement with two young competitive Lieutenants under his wing as an Indian uprising starts up requiring him to take action in the field for the last time. Adding to the tension is Agar as a First Lieutenant Career officer and Carey as a second lieutenant and short timer vying for Joanne Dru. Wayne does a very good job playing a captain in his late 50's struggling with early morning arthritis and dealing with McLaglen chronic drinking issues (virtually in every film). McLaglen plays his typical hard nosed, free drinking Irishman that plays the good sergeant in spite of his vice and penchant for fisticuffs. Along with that is Ben Johnson playing the familiar Sergeant role with as his running stock answer when asked a question by Wayne ""That's not my department"". Within the regrets of retirement and internal command conflicts, Wayne must take the field but he is burdened by women from the Fort that suddenly require an evacuation ruining Wayne's field maneuvers and causing injury to a patrol he cannot met timely. The picture becomes exciting as Wayne under constant pressure from Indians who now have up to date rifles from the typically 40's 50's portrayed of a lowdown dirty rotten sutler (Ford rarely put any in good light, see Fort Apache) as Wayne must hold off pursuit, split his command and return the women safely back to the Fort. The excitement continues with a touch of sentimentality that although prevalent in the film since Wayne is also a widower, he loses command due to forced retirement but without authorization, he unofficially returns to the field to assist Agar who is in the midst of his first independent campaign. This is an excellent portrayal of army life and in particular the running joke about being promoted in the post Civil War army in ""seven to ten years"". Dru serves well as the privileged but hard nosed romantic interest and at times slows the action, she also contributes to what appears to be some pre-matrimony squabbling that is not only entertaining but adds to the inner conflict of the command. Natwick, O'Brian and Shield s play their parts fine as well as the Ford pictures made them all stars.  The film also portrays the Indians in a positive light particularly showing their effective fighting methods, aversion to taking high casualties and the conflict between young and the old warriors.

It has a great cast (my favorite being Victor McLaglen); although I don't believe they used Mildred Natwick nearly enough and Joanne Dru way too much.  This is definitely one of my favorite John Wayne performances (to think John Ford almost didn't cast him in the lead role!).  I loved it when he kept hauling out his ""brand new silver watch"" at every opportunity.  I can't imagine anyone else playing this part.  I especially love the false ending, riding off into the sunset (but wait, there's more).  It's a beautiful film to watch, at turns frantic, fun, and sentimental.

30640,A192MB4JIDDOVX,0780621832,Father of four,"[5, 6]","John Wayne lives this part.  A battle hardened veteran of the war between the states, a career officer - Captain Nathan Brittles - finds himself on the Western Frontier nearing the end of his career.  A man for whom the military is not just a way of life, it is life.  And, in a remarkably sensitive fashion for the time, the ""hostiles"" are shown to be a civilized and intelligent people who have been pushed time and time again by the western expansion of this nation and are simply fighting to survive.  It would have of course been easy just to shoot another movie reflecting an Indian uprising with calvary charges and heroic gestures.  Thank goodness we're spared that.  Instead, we have a deeply well orchestrated movie developing many different characters and plot lines.  While he is Army through and through, Captain Brittles still poignantly takes time to water the desert flowers on his wife's grave and to talk to her gently until that day comes that he joins her. And, Sgt Tyree, the irrepressible scout that is almost an extension of Captain Brittles, has another life too that we learn about, in a touching and well done scene not often witnessed in today's pyrotechnic oriented films.  Is this the best western I've ever seen?  Maybe, maybe not, but the Searchers (who can forget that shadowy ending shot with John Wayne framing the door?) is close (not to mention the sleeper The Tin Star with Henry Fonda) and so are Fort Apache, My Darling Clementine (Henry Fonda again), and Gunfight at the OK Corral (Kirk Douglas) - some of which have been mentioned by other reviewers as well.

Cohen,"[1, 2]","I remember when I was going to college in the 1960s and being a great Wayne fan, I would hear from a lot of boobs about what a terrible actor the Duke was. (This was before the Oscar for ""True Grit"" and Wayne's final great performance in ""The Shootist."")  Well the individuals who spoke negatively of the Duke obviously never saw ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River,"" ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" or this film.  They were wrong about a lot of things, not the least of which was what a fine actor the Duke was, (on top of being the greatest movie star of all-time.)This film features one of his greatest performances as Captain Nathan Brittles, a veteran cavalry officer just a few days short of retirement.  Obviously, being a John Ford western, an indian uprising is going to start before the Captain can permanently take his uniform off.  Wearing make-up to make him appear much older than his actual age, Wayne has some wonderfully sensitive scenes, especially the ones of him talking to his late wife while sitting at her grave each night.This is the only one of Ford's cavalry trilogy to be filmed in color and, other than ""The Searchers,"" it is probably his most beautiful film.  Filmed in Monument Valley, with the red soil kicking up red dust as the horses trample through and the beautiful blue skies, this must have looked stunnning on the big screen.The supporting cast is great with John Agar and Joanne Dru (very attractive) doing a nice job as the constantly bickering young lovers, a young Ben Johnson as a former confederate soldier turned U.S. cavalry sergeant, and Victor MacLaglen hilarious as the stereotypical drunken Irish cavalry sergeant.  The rest of the cast is terrific as well.The extras include some color home-movies of Wayne and Ford scouting locations for this film, a re-release trailer and some information regarding the films Wayne and Ford did together.This and ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" came out the same year.  Wayne was nominated for the oscar for best actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima.""  I once read an interview with him where he mistakenly thought he was nominated for ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" instead.

So he chose an outpost of the cavalry and a captain who is going to retire. It is the story of his last days. There is no vision of the massacre of the Indians. There is no balanced vision of these Indian wars. The only moment when some distanciation is visible is when two whites are trying to sell fireguns to the Indians. They are punished in their attempt to make money out of these wars by being killed by the Indians. This gives of the Indians a vision of untrustworthy behavior. But what is essential is the attitude of the cavalrymen when they are confronted to two women who want to travel west in spite of the danger : tourism in times of war. These young men are shown as gallant and ready to serve these women as best they can, even if it means death for them. The vision of the cavalry is emotional too because the captain who retires does so with a deep grief in his heart. Once a cavalryman, forever a cavalryman. And he gets his nomination as a scout when he is already on his way to California. So he comes back and faces the end of his life in this outpost, fighting against Indians.

Each is an independent movie and may be viewed in any order.""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" is a nostalgic view of the ending of a career for Capt Nathan Brittles (John Wayne), a career in which he has spent the last 40 years of his life.  ""I was a lad in blue jeans and barefoot when I left my daddy's farm to join the army"", he comments and the pain of leaving the career he has loved all his life is painfully evident.  Nathan's whole life has been the cavalry and on that painful night before retirement he comments, ""Now tomorrow I'll be glad if the blacksmith asks me to shoe a horse."" As evident by the cemetery scene, Nathan Brittles views retirement as the beginning of the end; his life will no longer have meaning or purpose as he awaits to join his wife and family in death.But there is still one last patrol, one last mission, one last time to ride as Captain of the Troop before surrendering his command to two younger officers, Lt(s). Cohill and Pennell (John Agar and Harry Cary Jr.), who he has trained but who he feels are still not ready to assume command; two officers who spend more time fighting over a young girl, Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), then attending to duties.For the Indians, they are uprising in the wake of the Custer disaster of 1876, as tribes join together old quarrels forgotten.  Along with the return of the buffalo, they see it as a sure sign of the return of Indian dominance to the Great Plains.  But for Nathan Brittles this last patrol is his attempt to prevent another Indian war.This is John Wayne as his very best, a classic movie in every sense of the word featuring the beautiful Monument Valley so typical of John Ford westerns only this time filmed in glorious color.  Even Mother Nature lends a hand here, no special CGI effects, for the troops rides on with a pending thunderstorm approaching in the background an event which won this film an Oscar.  The movie also has most all of John Ford's stock Irish actors present, John Agar, Ben Johnson, Harry Cary Jr., Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick, George O'Brien, and Francis Ford.  Many of them also appearing in the other movies of this series as well.As an extra historical note you will want to watch out for the old Indian leader, Chief Pony that Walks (Chief John Big Tree).  You have seen him many times before and not just in the movies.  Chief John Big Tree, 100% Seneca, who in 1912, posed as the Indian on the famous Indian-Head/ Buffalo nickel which was in circulation during the early to mid 20th century.This Oscar winning film is truly John Wayne and John Ford at their best.Readers of this review are invited to comment below or by email as listed in my profile.",5,John Wayne & John Ford at their Very Best,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,2932,"['John', 'Ford', 'Cavalry', 'Trilogy', 'series', 'three', 'movies', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'BW', '1948', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'Color', '1949', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'BW', '1950', 'get', 'insight', 'life', 'manners', 'United', 'States', 'Cavalry', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'independent', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'order', 'Wore', 'A', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'nostalgic', 'view', 'ending', 'career', 'Capt', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'John', 'Wayne', 'career', 'spent', 'last', '40', 'years', 'life', 'was', 'lad', 'blue', 'jeans', 'barefoot', 'when', 'left', 'daddy', 'farm', 'join', 'army', 'comments', 'pain', 'leaving', 'career', 'loved', 'life', 'painfully', 'evident', 'Nathan', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'cavalry', 'painful', 'night', 'retirement', 'comments', 'Now', 'tomorrow', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'blacksmith', 'shoe', 'horse', 'evident', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'views', 'retirement', 'beginning', 'end', 'life', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'join', 'wife', 'family', 'death.But', 'still', 'one', 'last', 'patrol', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'ride', 'Captain', 'Troop', 'surrendering', 'command', 'two', 'younger', 'officers', 'Lt', 's', 'Cohill', 'Pennell', 'John', 'Agar', 'Harry', 'Cary', 'Jr.', 'who', 'trained', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'ready', 'assume', 'command', 'two', 'officers', 'who', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'fighting', 'young', 'girl', 'Olivia', 'Dandridge', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'then', 'attending', 'duties.For', 'Indians', 'are', 'uprising', 'wake', 'Custer', 'disaster', '1876', 'tribes', 'join', 'together', 'old', 'quarrels', 'forgotten', 'return', 'buffalo', 'see', 'sure', 'sign', 'return', 'Indian', 'dominance', 'Great', 'Plains', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'last', 'patrol', 'attempt', 'prevent', 'Indian', 'war.This', 'John', 'Wayne', 'very', 'best', 'classic', 'movie', 'sense', 'word', 'featuring', 'beautiful', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'so', 'typical', 'John', 'Ford', 'only', 'time', 'filmed', 'glorious', 'color', 'Even', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'hand', 'here', 'special', 'CGI', 'effects', 'troops', 'rides', 'pending', 'thunderstorm', 'approaching', 'background', 'event', 'won', 'film', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'also', 'most', 'John', 'Ford', 'stock', 'Irish', 'actors', 'present', 'John', 'Agar', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Harry', 'Cary', 'Jr.', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'George', ""O'Brien"", 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Many', 'also', 'appearing', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'extra', 'historical', 'note', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'out', 'old', 'Indian', 'leader', 'Chief', 'Pony', 'Walks', 'Chief', 'John', 'Big', 'Tree', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'not', 'just', 'movies', 'Chief', 'John', 'Big', 'Tree', '100', '%', 'Seneca', 'who', '1912', 'posed', 'Indian', 'famous', 'Indian-Head/', 'Buffalo', 'nickel', 'was', 'circulation', 'early', 'mid', '20th', 'century.This', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'truly', 'John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Ford', 'best.Readers', 'review', 'are', 'invited', 'comment', 'email', 'listed', 'profile']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

He's accompanied by fellow officer Victor McLaglen who's very funny in a broad way, as well as two stiffly acted young lovers, a subplot that doesn't take too much away from the overall film (fortunately).  Wayne has to rely a lot less on heroics in this performance, and instead concentrate on characterization, which he does with much success.  He brings depth and a bittersweet quality to his character in a way that might surprise some.  With a beautifully photographed backdrop framing each scene, this John Ford feature is sure to please fans of Wayne and Westerns alike.",4,One of Wayne's Finest,994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,755,"['John', 'Wayne', 'probably', 'finest', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'give', 'so', 'far', 'story', 'Calvary', 'officer', 'just', 'days', 'retirement', 'who', 'one', 'last', 'assignment', 'accompanied', 'fellow', 'officer', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'who', 'very', 'funny', 'broad', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'stiffly', 'acted', 'young', 'lovers', 'subplot', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'overall', 'film', 'fortunately', 'Wayne', 'rely', 'lot', 'less', 'heroics', 'performance', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'characterization', 'much', 'success', 'depth', 'bittersweet', 'quality', 'character', 'way', 'might', 'surprise', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'backdrop', 'framing', 'scene', 'John', 'Ford', 'feature', 'sure', 'please', 'fans', 'Wayne', 'Westerns', 'alike']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS
30653,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,0780621832,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[4, 7]","...but that is still saying a lot. Although the most spectacular looking of the three films, the acting of some of the important characters, and the relatively uninteresting romance portion of the story really makes this the least of the three movies in terms of film viewership.John Wayne is terrific as the troop leader who  has lots of experience fighting Indians as the settlers try to tame the west. He portrays a mature, intelligent and wily commander who understands the mission and likes to lose as few troops as possible. His performance is ably supported by Ben Johnson (who started his career as Wayne's stunt double) as his uber helpful ""galloper,"" Harry Carey Jr, as a four year trooper who  is still wet behind the ears, and Victor McLaglen who is Wayne's tippling aide de camp. McLaglen can take some corny material and put a smile on the audience's collective face. Some of the supporting players really fall down on the job, however. The worst offender is JoAnn Dru, who, although pretty, cannot manage to convey why she has the whole fort in an uproar other than her looks, which are no more fascinating than the other young ladies stationed there. Her true love interest, John Agar, creates absolutely no heat in his scenes with her and delivers his lines in a controlled monotone, not exactly the intonations calculted to inspire ardor in the female heart. Usually a good actress, Mildred Natwick just isn't the gal for her part of a still attractive chaperone who has seen life around the fort for a long time and knows what is going on behind the scenes.The best parts of the film are the war scenes with the Indians who have joined forces across tribes following Sitting Bull's stunning victory against General Custer. Their improved numbers and fierce attitudes make for some fine war scenes. Wayne's foray into the Indian encampment to talk peace with his old friend, an Indian chief who has lost control of the young warriors is striking. Wayne conveys his willingness to talk peace with his hunting and fishing buddy, while doing a little recon on exactly where those horses are corralled. When he asks Ben Johnson ""Ever been scared Tyree?"" we realize Wayne and Johnson are just as likely to be struck down by arrows as escape the peace visit with their lives. Wayne's scene, in which he covertly  puts on his reading glasses to read the inscription on a retirement gift, shows just how much the warrior has  aged while in the army.The real honors of the film go to director Ford. A sudden lightning storm came up during filming. As cinematographer Hoch packed up equipment to leave, Ford instructed him to photograph the storm. The resulting scenes are absolutely thrilling to watch. Hoch won an Oscar for his work on this film, but lodged a complaint against Ford with the cinematographer's guild for endangering his crew.This is a superior western and should be seen especially compared with the other two movies from the trilogy (although Ford didn't think the three were related in any particular  way). The best of the three is undoubtedly Fort Apache, featuring a compelling story, a tour de force performance by Henry Fonda, splendid black and white photography, and beautiful editing. Rio Grande is my second favorite of the three. Wayne and leading lady Maureen O'Hara are compelling as the mature lovers who have been estranged for twenty years, but are brought together by their son's enlistment in the army under Wayne, as well as the fact that they are still hot for each other. In both of these two films the supporting cast does an unbelievable job of portraying the danger, tensions, and strain of outpost life. See them all.

30660,A2GOTY2STOMEAU,0780621832,John G. Gleeson Sr.,"[19, 20]","John Ford's &quot;Cavalry Trilogy&quot; presents some of the finest western scenes ever made. I believe this to be the best of the three, although I'm sure to hear from folks who differ. Be that as it may, this is a beautifully made disc. On the big screen ( a must), it is the scenery that is a major factor, because the film is so vivid. I saw the &quot;Trilogy&quot; in the theatre when released, and I believe that the DVD viewer will see the film better realized on the digital screen than moviegoers saw in 1959. Another opinion that many will differ with is that this is John Wayne's best performance; his role as Captain Nathan Briddles could not be better done. John Ford had a cadre of actors that appeared regularly in his films, but Victor McLaglin, Ben Johnson and Arthur Shields do good work in their respective parts. Johnson, a former rodeo rider, is a superb horseman, and watch Shields' stagecraft when his character operates on a wounded trooper. It's fantastic attention to the details of the scene. Joanne Dru was a fifties actress, and the love interest is a bit dated, but it is the cinematography that is the winner here. Some of the scenes, one involving a thunderstorm, and another showing a stunning sunset are still amazing, especially since no computer graphics are involved. The attention to detail that makes or breaks historical film are consistantly well done here, as exemplified in the correctness of the cavalry scenes.

John Wayne's performance as an aging soldier was so out of character for him at the time, and yet he plays the part perfectly.  Even the make-up used to age him looks natural.  John Ford's use of Monument Valley for the location provided some breathtaking background while his direction is perfection itself.  Today the script seems a little cliched, but when I first saw the film it was fresh and brisk and still seems that way today.  And the supporting cast - what a dream!  Not one wrong note in the crowd, but as a real standout, Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree is one of my favorite characters in film.

There are some urban myths about John Wayne but I don't remember any of his films.So, hey, a long weekend was coming up.  I thought I might give it a try.This story is about the U.S. Cavalry shortly after the Civil War.  General Custer and his men have just been slaughtered.  The Indians are uprising.  John Wayne, a gray-haired widower who visits his wife's grave regularly, is in command of a fort in the territory. In less than a week he will be forced into retirement. A romantic triangle exists between Joanne Dru and two of the enlisted men. She's visiting the fort but because danger is imminent, she and her aunt have to be escorted to where she can get a stagecoach.  So she goes out on patrol with the men.I kept waiting for something to happen.  There was no real high drama.  Very little conflict.  John Wayne becomes the hero because he stops an Indian war by chasing away their horses.  Everything seems very unlikely.  And silly.  It was hard to keep watching because I was totally bored.  I guess John Wayne's performance was all right.  But I judge good performances on the subtlety of emotions displayed by the actors.  And John Wayne's performance was completely one-dimensional.I've see old movies where the essentials of a good story are well told.  But, aside from the song, ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"", which has a catchy melody, this film just doesn't even make the playing field in my list of recommendations.Don't waste your time with this one.

30675,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0780621832,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[0, 0]","That's the line Captain Nathan Brittles (John Wayne) keeps repeating at different junctures throughout this John Ford classic of a retiring cavalry officer and the last mission he must preside over.But although Brittles may not hold with apologizing, we see that his life has had many ups and downs, and will have more before this mission is complete. He and his men must escort his commander's wife and her niece to catch the stage back east, a task made dangerous because of the recent massacre of Custer at the Little Big Horn. There are two storylines at work here: a love triangle of the niece who's playing off two young soldiers against each other, and Brittles' more engrossing story as the old officer tries to carry out this last mission in a world where young blood continually stirs up trouble on the warpath--literally.Wayne does one of his best jobs here, playing a man much older than his actual age. One wonders what he might have done differently had ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" come later in his career, in the 1960s or early 70s. Nevertheless, even though the picture was 25 years ahead of schedule for Wayne, he does a convincing portrayal of the timeworn captain who understands that there is little of glory in the calvary, but much honor if you do your duty. Frequent co-star Victor McLaglin is on hand again, this time as Sgt. Quincannon, also due for retirement in the next few days. This is one of those ""stage Irish"" performances, more than slightly over the top, replete with whiskey drinking and brawling, but not troublesome for all that.Ford rarely handles women convincingly, and Joanne Dru is no exception. She looks more like a 1940s WAC than a 19th century girl visiting the still-untamed West, but Harry Carey Jr and John Agar aren't much help either. Of the younger crowd, the best job is turned in by Ben Johnson, that master horseman who populated not a few of the Ford calvary pictures. He playes Sgt. Tyree, a former Confederate captain who now is an enlisted man in the calvary. This speaks to the uneasy attempt to meld together two armies lately at war with each other, who now must unite to bring the west and the Indians down under US government authority.There are three major factors that make ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" a standout:One is John Wayne's performance. The second is the Nathan Brittles storyline. The third?Absolutely breathtaking cinematography. One knows that this picture's Best Cinematography Oscar was won by just one scene--that amazing storm gathering cloud threatening down on the the calvary as they march through Monument Valley. There are other good shots, but that's the Award-winner, no doubt about that.For those who think that all westerns are the same, make it your business to watch ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" to correct that misconception--and no apologies, please; it's a sign of weakness.",5,"""Never Apologize, Mister, It's a Sign of Weakness!""",1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,2868,"['line', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'John', 'Wayne', 'repeating', 'different', 'junctures', 'John', 'Ford', 'classic', 'retiring', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'last', 'mission', 'must', 'preside', 'Brittles', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'apologizing', 'see', 'life', 'had', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'mission', 'complete', 'men', 'must', 'escort', 'commander', 'wife', 'niece', 'catch', 'stage', 'back', 'east', 'task', 'made', 'dangerous', 'recent', 'massacre', 'Custer', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'are', 'two', 'storylines', 'work', 'here', 'love', 'triangle', 'niece', 'who', 'playing', 'off', 'two', 'young', 'soldiers', 'other', 'Brittles', 'more', 'engrossing', 'story', 'old', 'officer', 'carry', 'out', 'last', 'mission', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'blood', 'continually', 'up', 'trouble', 'warpath', 'literally.Wayne', 'one', 'best', 'jobs', 'here', 'playing', 'man', 'much', 'older', 'actual', 'age', 'One', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'had', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'come', 'later', 'career', '1960s', 'early', '70s', 'Nevertheless', 'even', 'picture', 'was', '25', 'years', 'ahead', 'schedule', 'Wayne', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'timeworn', 'captain', 'who', 'little', 'glory', 'calvary', 'much', 'honor', 'do', 'duty', 'Frequent', 'co-star', 'Victor', 'McLaglin', 'hand', 'again', 'time', 'Sgt', 'Quincannon', 'also', 'due', 'retirement', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'one', 'stage', 'Irish', 'performances', 'more', 'slightly', 'top', 'replete', 'whiskey', 'drinking', 'brawling', 'not', 'troublesome', 'that.Ford', 'rarely', 'women', 'convincingly', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'exception', 'more', '1940s', 'WAC', '19th', 'century', 'girl', 'visiting', 'still-untamed', 'West', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'John', 'Agar', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'either', 'younger', 'crowd', 'best', 'job', 'turned', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'master', 'horseman', 'who', 'populated', 'not', 'few', 'Ford', 'calvary', 'pictures', 'playes', 'Sgt', 'Tyree', 'former', 'Confederate', 'captain', 'who', 'now', 'enlisted', 'man', 'calvary', 'uneasy', 'attempt', 'meld', 'together', 'two', 'armies', 'lately', 'war', 'other', 'who', 'now', 'must', 'unite', 'bring', 'west', 'Indians', 'down', 'US', 'government', 'are', 'three', 'major', 'factors', 'make', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'standout', 'One', 'John', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'second', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'storyline', 'third', 'Absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'One', 'picture', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Oscar', 'was', 'won', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'amazing', 'storm', 'gathering', 'cloud', 'threatening', 'down', 'calvary', 'march', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'shots', 'Award-winner', 'doubt', 'that.For', 'who', 'think', 'westerns', 'are', 'same', 'make', 'business', 'watch', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'correct', 'misconception', 'apologies', 'please', 'sign', 'weakness']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.On the verge of his retirement, aging US Cavalry Capt. Nathan Cutting Brittles (John Wayne) is given one last mission: to take his troop and deal with a breakout from the reservation by the Cheyenne and Arapaho following the defeat of George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn... He must also escort two ladies, Abby Allshard (Mildred Natwick) and Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru), to a safe place away from the isolated outpost in wilderness. Two of his officers, 1st Lt. Flint Cohill (John Agar) and 2nd Lt. Ross Pennell (Harry Carey, Jr.), meanwhile vie for the affections of Miss Dandridge...This is one of those films which reached perfection - there is simply no other word for it. Every single scene, every single diaog line, every single image and every single piece of music (and especially the songs) are PERFECT! The film is frequently very moving and sometimes solemn, but also contains TONS of humour and the general tone is in the same time touching, heart-warming and optimistic - something mostly missing nowadays from the movies...John Wayne (aged for the needs of the scenario by carefully applied make up) is of course the main star of this film, but he certainly doesn't monopolise the screen time. In fact, another of the reasons why this film is such a masterpiece is the large time and latitude given to the secondary characters, especially Top Sergeant Quincannon, played wonderfully by Victor McLaglen and Sergeant Tyree, formerly known as Captain Tyree, in times when he served with Confederate cavalry with General Lee, played impressively well by Ben Johnson. Do not miss also Private John Smith - he appears only in a short scene, but it is an extremely powerful one...This film, even more that &#34;Fort Apache&#34;, is a tribute to the works, fights and tribulations of US Cavalry in the Wild West plains in the years which followed the War Between States - and in this aspect also it succeeds greatly.This is one of those films everybody should see at least once in a lifetime, a masterpiece made by one of the greatest directors ever, at a time when he was at the very top of his game...

30677,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,0780621832,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[56, 57]","Joanne Dru teams with The DUKE again in this Technicolor marvel (after appearing together in ""Red River"" the year before). In this one, Dru plays a young romantic hopeful for both John Agar and Harry Carey, Jr.Monument Valley never looked better. The stormclouds are stunning, even if the fake lightning is not. And the sunsets! Only Technicolor can capture the colors with such brilliance!While I prefer ""Rio Grande"" and the lamentably-not-on-DVD-yet ""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" plays more as a quiet homage to the cavalry than the actionfests of the other two films. Not that this film is sparse on action! However, the focus here is most definitely on the honor and wisdom of the old guard.As usual, Ford has many subtle threads woven in to the plot of the film that enhance the story with backstories that are only hinted at. The most notable of these is the former Confederate soldiers, now part of the U.S. Cavalry. Their honor is intact, and they are still true to their ideals, despite wearing the uniform of the Yankee. There is, we know, much more to their story, but we see just what we need to. Any more, and the real story would get lost, the focus moved to the wrong place. How many modern directors make the mistake of letting this happen again and again and again? Too many, for sure.Some people have complained that John Wanye was a lousy actor, which I've always chalked up to a refusal to recognize talent in a celebrity simply through differences in personal taste. Like ""The Searchers"", ""Red River"", ""The Horse Soldiers"" and ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" (also starring the late John Agar), there are solid moments in this film when DUKE delivers. Just look as he ""gives his report"" to his wife and children, when he writes out his protest to his commanding officer, and again, when he gets the memento of the silver watch from his troopers. The viewer's taste notwithstanding, it cannot be denied that DUKE could act.The usual excellent Ford supporting players abound. Ben Johnson, Arthur Shields, Harry Carey Jr., and of course, the lovable Victor McLaglen (yet again playing a man named Quincannon), are all on hand. Paul Fix has a cameo as a gun-runner.Two real-life Indian chiefs also appear. Chief John Big Tree appeared in several westerns (including ""The Big Trail"" and ""Stagecoach"", both with The DUKE), and is famous for being the original model for artist James Fraser when he crafted the indian head nickel. Chief Sky Eagle cameos in his only film appearance.A touching and poignant western, it is a must see for fans of Ford, The DUKE, The U.S. Calvalry, or the Old West.And, incidentally, this film was not shot in a widescreen format. It was shot in a 35mm, spherical process, with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1.

John Wayne plays an old officer who is just a few days away from retirement when the ""Indian"" problem boils over. In this picture Wayne's character is clever rather than ""charge forward and worry about things later"" very typical in his later career. His sidekick Sergeant Quincannon had some of the more humorous moments (played by Victor McLagen).A good job was made in references to the American Civil War as well as various officers in the U.S. Cavalry who had been a lot higher in rank in the Confederacy but were now several notches down. There's an old fellow who is a very minor character and dies and this lowly officer is later mentioned as a brigadier general of the Confederacy.At the very end Wayne's character comes to realize how much the U.S. Cavalry means to his identity.The film was directed by John Ford and part of his U.S. Cavalry trilogy. The movie just before this one was ""Fort Apache"" and the one right after was ""Rio Grande"". Of the three I think I most like ""Rio Grande"".

30684,AYU9LBROYQBG6,0780621832,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[2, 2]","She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is a 1949 western film directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne. The film was the second of Ford's trilogy of films focusing on the US Cavalry, the other two films being Fort Apache (1948) and Rio Grande (1950). With a budget of $1.6 million, the film was one of the most expensive westerns of the time, but became a major hit for RKO and remains a popular classic today.Known for its breathtaking views of Monument Valley located on the southern border of Utah; the cinematographer, Winton Hoch, won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Color Cinematography. Ford and Hoch based much of the film's imagery on the paintings and sculptures of Frederic Remington.Ford demonstrated a number of standard Cavalry procedures in horse management in this and other movies. Strict rotation between walk, trot, and leading the horses made them last as long as possible. They were still no match for the lightly burdened Indian horses for endurance, but US Cavalry horses were fed grain (when available), and this helped even the odds a bit.The film is named after a song common in the U.S. military, ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", which is still used today to keep marching cadence. It is a variant of the song ""All Around My Hat"".On the verge of his retirement, the aging Cavalry Capt. Nathan Cutting Brittles (John Wayne) deals with a series of attacks by the Cheyenne following the defeat of George Armstrong Custer. Unwilling to see more lives needlessly taken, Brittles takes it upon himself to try to make peace with Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John Big Tree).The movie's narrator references Pony Express rider's concerns over George Custer's defeat. Custer was killed in 1876, whereas the pony express made its last ride fifteen years earlier in 1861 after only a year of service.Actor RoleJohn Wayne Capt.

I go further in claiming for it high status in the genre of western films, it is one of the finest. Wayne wears makeup that ages him 20 years and his acting performance transforms him into that older man Captain Nathan Brittles, soon to be retired from the U. S. Cavalry. Captain Brittles talking to his late wife at her grave ,while he waters the plants he has placed there, with Monument valley in the background is one of the more moving scenes.  This and ""The Searchers"" are Wayne's finest acting performances. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" won an academy award for it's color cinematography and it was well deserved.

Crawford,"[0, 0]","This was the kind of film I watched as a kid:  all the good guys were handsome, indians formed an essentially indiscriminate mass of whooping killers, and the backdrops they rode through were reddish fakes.  Still, this is a truly great viewing experience, with vivid characters, plenty of humor, and a good plot.Wayne is an old calvary captain about to retire, going on his last mission, which included 2 tough women in wagons to slow him down.  He is an honest galoot, loved by his men, and wise from experience.  Interestingly, the story begins right at the moment that Little Big Man ends, with the coalition of tribes that killed Custer, who is present as a cherished memory.  So they set out on patrol and to deliver the women to the stage coach and safety.  However, along the way, it turns into a dangerous cat and mouse with the Indians, in particular the Cheyenne, and there are many good episodes of near slaughter.  Wayne does his best.  THere is also a subplot where the younger girl must choose between 2 officers, who are at each other for the whole film.  Finally, as he is about to retire, Wayne evolves and changes his mission to one of preserving peace.Bristling with stereotypes as it is, this is a fun film.  It is only that, as a history enthusiast who grew up rebellious in the 1960s, I see it with very different eyes than I did as a boy in the 1950s.  In a way, the subtext - what a different place America was before the Vietnam War - was present in my mind during the whole viewing.  It made me feel deeply nostalgic but also fascinated.  There is not a single jot of cynicism in the film, not even the blaring patriotic marches of the soundtrack were intended to reflect the irony that they would today, and empathy for the plights of the Indians is utterly missing in all the nationalistic fervor.  Indeed, that perspective made it doubly enjoyable for me to watch, though my European wife was uniformly critical of it throughout.  However, my kids would not enjoy this, though we will certainly watch it for purposes of discussion.Recommended for all these reasons.",4,"great filmmaking, stereotypes, and all",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2095,"['was', 'kind', 'film', 'watched', 'kid', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'handsome', 'indians', 'formed', 'essentially', 'indiscriminate', 'mass', 'whooping', 'killers', 'backdrops', 'rode', 'were', 'reddish', 'fakes', 'Still', 'truly', 'great', 'viewing', 'experience', 'vivid', 'characters', 'plenty', 'humor', 'good', 'plot.Wayne', 'old', 'calvary', 'captain', 'retire', 'going', 'last', 'mission', 'included', '2', 'tough', 'women', 'wagons', 'slow', 'down', 'honest', 'galoot', 'loved', 'men', 'wise', 'experience', 'Interestingly', 'story', 'right', 'moment', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'coalition', 'tribes', 'killed', 'Custer', 'who', 'present', 'cherished', 'memory', 'set', 'out', 'patrol', 'deliver', 'women', 'stage', 'coach', 'safety', 'However', 'way', 'dangerous', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Indians', 'particular', 'Cheyenne', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'episodes', 'near', 'slaughter', 'Wayne', 'best', 'also', 'subplot', 'where', 'younger', 'girl', 'must', 'choose', '2', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'other', 'whole', 'film', 'Finally', 'retire', 'Wayne', 'mission', 'one', 'preserving', 'peace.Bristling', 'stereotypes', 'fun', 'film', 'only', 'that', 'history', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'rebellious', '1960s', 'see', 'very', 'different', 'eyes', 'did', 'boy', '1950s', 'way', 'subtext', 'what', 'different', 'place', 'America', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'present', 'mind', 'whole', 'viewing', 'made', 'feel', 'deeply', 'nostalgic', 'also', 'fascinated', 'not', 'single', 'jot', 'cynicism', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'blaring', 'patriotic', 'marches', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'intended', 'reflect', 'irony', 'would', 'today', 'empathy', 'plights', 'Indians', 'utterly', 'missing', 'nationalistic', 'fervor', 'Indeed', 'perspective', 'made', 'doubly', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'European', 'wife', 'was', 'uniformly', 'critical', 'However', 'kids', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'will', 'certainly', 'watch', 'purposes', 'discussion.Recommended', 'reasons']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

30695,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0780621832,Robert Morris,"[4, 5]","For whatever reasons, Wayne's performances in westerns tend to be of a higher quality than in his other films and that is especially true of his work in this film, based on two of James Warner Bellah's short stories. Wayne portrays Captain Nathan Brittles who is about to retire. As the last day of his command approaches, Brittles must meanwhile cope with an Apache uprising which even his longtime friend Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John Big Tree) cannot prevent. One sub plot involves two young lieutenants who compete for Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru). One is Flint Cohill played by John Agar who appeared previously in Fort Apache as Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke. Other members of the John Ford Repertory Players include Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields, Harry Carey, Jr., and Ben Jonson who is especially effective as Sergeant Tyree.Frankly, I dislike westerns shot in color. Also, John Ford apparently had problems when directing actresses. (Maureen O'Hara's performance in The Quiet Man is a stunning exception.) More often than not, Ford's female characters are presented as saints, children, or furniture. I would have much preferred that this film had been shot in black-and-white, that the Olivia Dandridge character be omitted, and that the film focus entirely on the completion of Brittles' last command. Wayne is absolutely brilliant when Brittles is presented with a gold watch from his troops and struggles withy his eyeglasses so that he can read the inscription, ""Lest We Forget."" His conversation with Chief Pony That Walks in the Apache camp is also memorable. Wayne has better material to work with in this film than he had in Fort Apache (1948). In my opinion, his performance is flawless. Nevertheless, I rate this film a notch or two below Fort Apache and Rio Grande in which Ford is much less self-indulgent.",4,Measuring Ford by Ford's Standards,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,1850,"['reasons', 'Wayne', 'performances', 'westerns', 'tend', 'be', 'higher', 'quality', 'other', 'films', 'especially', 'true', 'work', 'film', 'based', 'two', 'James', 'Warner', 'Bellah', 'short', 'stories', 'Wayne', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'who', 'retire', 'last', 'day', 'command', 'approaches', 'Brittles', 'must', 'meanwhile', 'cope', 'Apache', 'uprising', 'even', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Chief', 'Pony', 'Walks', 'Chief', 'John', 'Big', 'Tree', 'can', 'not', 'prevent', 'One', 'sub', 'plot', 'two', 'young', 'lieutenants', 'who', 'compete', 'Olivia', 'Dandridge', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'One', 'Flint', 'Cohill', 'played', 'John', 'Agar', 'who', 'appeared', 'previously', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Lieutenant', 'Michael', ""O'Rourke"", 'Other', 'members', 'John', 'Ford', 'Repertory', 'Players', 'include', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Arthur', 'Shields', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'who', 'especially', 'effective', 'Sergeant', 'Tyree.Frankly', 'dislike', 'westerns', 'shot', 'color', 'Also', 'John', 'Ford', 'apparently', 'had', 'problems', 'when', 'directing', 'actresses', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'performance', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'stunning', 'exception', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'Ford', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'saints', 'children', 'furniture', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'black-and-white', 'Olivia', 'Dandridge', 'character', 'be', 'omitted', 'film', 'focus', 'entirely', 'completion', 'Brittles', 'last', 'command', 'Wayne', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'when', 'Brittles', 'presented', 'gold', 'watch', 'troops', 'withy', 'eyeglasses', 'so', 'can', 'read', 'inscription', 'Lest', 'Forget', 'conversation', 'Chief', 'Pony', 'That', 'Walks', 'Apache', 'camp', 'also', 'memorable', 'Wayne', 'better', 'material', 'work', 'film', 'had', 'Fort', 'Apache', '1948', 'opinion', 'performance', 'flawless', 'Nevertheless', 'rate', 'film', 'notch', 'two', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'Ford', 'much', 'less', 'self-indulgent']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

Winton C. Hoch won an Oscar for his Technicolor photography...The compositions and photography around Ford's new stamping ground of Monument valley are great to look at as always... The Monument Valley goes from bright sunlight to hail and sleet...There is a melancholy mixed together in those incredible vistas, with a certain sense of dreamlike contemplation... A backdrop so complex but so significant as the human characters...Ford has superbly achieved a huge and composite demonstration of all the legends of the frontier cavalryman... Never have the legendary troops been through the silent 'Indian country' and across the magnificent Western plains so brilliant, vivid, exciting and romantic...Ford has surely done better himself, unquestionably with 'My Darling Clementine,' and 'The Searchers,' yet one has to admit the undisputed merits of 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' Even the usual criticism launched against it-that it is a Western influenced by feeling rather by reason--can be dismissed at the start... Certainly Ford can be sentimental but only when the springs of honest feeling run dry and lose their inspiration, and this never really happens in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.'The story is that of an older cavalry officer (John Wayne) who is six days from retirement at Fort Stark when he's sent out, in a last mission, to escort the Major's wife (Mildred Natwick) and her niece, an attractive single lady (Joanne Dru) out of the danger area... Wayne tries to fulfill his military role protecting his female charges against the uprising of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche and Apaches...Wayne possibly more than any other Western star has re-created and heightened the mythology of the West-one has only to watch again his absolute and ideal image in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' or his avenging Ethan in 'The Searchers,' to be reminded of how irresistible the Duke has been on the cinema screen...'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' is above all a sentimental movie, with irresistible scenes, full of Ford's best touches:- The cavalry engaged in its everyday work... Wayne simply can't picture himself in a world far from the army...- The comic interaction between Wayne and Victor McLaglen, two hardcore professional officers...- The bravery of Sgt. Tyree (Ben Johnson), chased by hostile Indians, who must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw...- The rivalry of two young cavalry lieutenants (John Agar and Harry Carey Jr.) in love with the same woman, each competing to have her wear a yellow ribbon as a token of his love...- The 'beloved brute,' the tough-soft cavalry sergeant sharing his saddle with a little orphan rescued from a devastated stage station...- Ford celebrating McLaglen's lachrymose in self-indulgent fisticuffs in an epic saloon fight...- The last inspection of the C. troops almost bringing tears to Wayne's and the audience's eyes, as he reads the inscription that means so much to him...- Wayne riding into the war camp of the Indians to stop a war...- The U. S. cavalry at full gallop descending upon the encampment, firing wildly and stampeding hundred of Indian ponies...- The evocative use of music, notably the gay and spirited theme song of the yellow ribbon, played countless times...'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ' is an exciting story with strong characters and sentiment, highly enjoyable, and beautiful...",5,"Exciting, highly enjoyable, and beautiful!",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,3500,"[""'She"", 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'remains', 'many', 'viewers', 'favorite', 'Ford', 'film', 'certainly', 'most', 'striking', 'visually', 'Winton', 'C.', 'Hoch', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'compositions', 'photography', 'Ford', 'new', 'stamping', 'ground', 'Monument', 'valley', 'are', 'great', 'look', 'as', 'always', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'bright', 'sunlight', 'hail', 'sleet', 'melancholy', 'mixed', 'together', 'incredible', 'vistas', 'certain', 'sense', 'dreamlike', 'contemplation', 'backdrop', 'so', 'complex', 'so', 'significant', 'human', 'characters', 'Ford', 'superbly', 'achieved', 'huge', 'composite', 'demonstration', 'legends', 'frontier', 'cavalryman', 'Never', 'have', 'legendary', 'troops', 'been', 'silent', ""'Indian"", 'country', 'magnificent', 'Western', 'plains', 'so', 'brilliant', 'vivid', 'exciting', 'romantic', 'Ford', 'surely', 'done', 'better', 'unquestionably', ""'My"", 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'Searchers', 'yet', 'one', 'admit', 'undisputed', 'merits', ""'She"", 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'Even', 'usual', 'criticism', 'launched', 'it-that', 'Western', 'influenced', 'feeling', 'rather', 'reason', 'can', 'be', 'dismissed', 'start', 'Certainly', 'Ford', 'can', 'be', 'sentimental', 'only', 'when', 'springs', 'honest', 'feeling', 'run', 'dry', 'lose', 'inspiration', 'never', 'really', ""'She"", 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'story', 'older', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'six', 'days', 'retirement', 'Fort', 'Stark', 'when', 'sent', 'out', 'last', 'mission', 'escort', 'Major', 'wife', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'niece', 'attractive', 'single', 'lady', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'danger', 'area', 'Wayne', 'fulfill', 'military', 'role', 'protecting', 'female', 'charges', 'uprising', 'Sioux', 'Cheyenne', 'Kiowa', 'Comanche', 'Apaches', 'Wayne', 'possibly', 'more', 'other', 'Western', 'star', 're-created', 'heightened', 'mythology', 'West-one', 'only', 'watch', 'again', 'absolute', 'ideal', 'image', ""'She"", 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'avenging', 'Ethan', ""'The"", 'Searchers', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'irresistible', 'Duke', 'been', 'cinema', 'screen', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'irresistible', 'scenes', 'full', 'Ford', 'best', 'touches', 'cavalry', 'engaged', 'everyday', 'work', 'Wayne', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'world', 'far', 'army', 'comic', 'interaction', 'Wayne', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'two', 'hardcore', 'professional', 'officers', 'bravery', 'Sgt', 'Tyree', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'chased', 'hostile', 'Indians', 'who', 'must', 'finish', 'mission', 'reporting', 'captain', 'what', 'saw', 'rivalry', 'two', 'young', 'cavalry', 'lieutenants', 'John', 'Agar', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'competing', 'have', 'wear', 'yellow', 'ribbon', 'token', 'love', ""'beloved"", 'brute', 'tough-soft', 'cavalry', 'sergeant', 'sharing', 'saddle', 'little', 'orphan', 'rescued', 'devastated', 'stage', 'station', 'Ford', 'celebrating', 'McLaglen', 'lachrymose', 'self-indulgent', 'fisticuffs', 'epic', 'saloon', 'fight', 'last', 'inspection', 'C.', 'almost', 'bringing', 'tears', 'Wayne', 'audience', 'eyes', 'inscription', 'so', 'much', 'Wayne', 'riding', 'war', 'camp', 'Indians', 'stop', 'war', 'U.', 'S.', 'cavalry', 'full', 'gallop', 'descending', 'encampment', 'firing', 'wildly', 'stampeding', 'hundred', 'Indian', 'ponies', 'evocative', 'use', 'music', 'notably', 'gay', 'spirited', 'theme', 'song', 'yellow', 'ribbon', 'played', 'countless', 'times', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'exciting', 'story', 'strong', 'characters', 'sentiment', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'beautiful']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

30700,AY3AVLL5IWW9,0780621832,Russell Fanelli,"[8, 9]","In my opinion John Wayne is the greatest of all actors in the western genre and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon shows Wayne at his best as Captain Nathan Brittles of the United States Cavalry attempting to quell an Indian uprising months after Custer and his troop have been killed at the Little Big Horn.  Think of all the great Westerns with John Wayne such as Red River The Searchers, Rio Lobo, and True Grit, to name just a few, and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon takes its place nicely in this list of fine films.Alan Ladd in Shane remains my favorite western with Gary Cooper in High Noon second.  Yellow Ribbon's story is not as complex and compelling as either of the classics just named, but still it has much to recommend it.First, the scenery is spectacular, as it was in Shane.  Monument Valley is the backdrop for the action and we see much of it as Wayne leads his troop to bring two women to a stagecoach at a not too distant outpost.  The hostiles have arrived first to destroy the outpost and Wayne is forced to take the women back to his post to remain for the winter.Second, the acting is good, particularly Wayne and Victor McLaglen as his tough as nails, whiskey loving Sargeant.  Also, watch for a young Ben Johnson as Sgt. Tyree, a southern officer of the confederacy now enlisted in the U.S. Army.  Johnson is not as versatile an actor as Montgomery Clift, who rose to fame after Red River, but he is good enough to have had more than a career as a supporting player.Third, the story, as mentioned, is a bit thin.  Wayne uses all his considerable savy to prevent an all out Indian war in the southwest.  Joanne Dru is an army brat being fought over by two young lieutenants to fill out the story line and this bickering, with Wayne in the middle to sort things out, gets a bit tiresome, as it did in Red River.  But it is Wayne we have come to see and he does not disappoint.  He invests his role with enough humanity for us to care about what happens to him as he closes out his career with the army.She Wore a Yellow Ribbon gives us a simple, straightforward story in the best tradition of the American western.

I did not then when I saw it as a child really understand what was going on.So now after all the years I know the story is about Capt.

I know that there is a moving scene in which Capt. Brittles mourns his wife.

Each is more nuanced than like movies by other directors.This one features John Wayne playing Captain Nathan Brittles, nearing the end of his long career, nearing a retirement that he clearly is uncomfortable with. Wayne is playing a character much older than he was at the time. And, if one says that Wayne could not act, this movie is clearcut refutation of that charge. He makes his character work.Monument Valley provides the background for this movie. There is a set of familiar figures in John Ford's repertory company (e.g., Victor McLaglen as an old Irish sergeant nearing retirement; Harry Carey, Junior and Ben Johnson show up, too).The nuances include a more positive view of Native Americans than found in other Westerns; this is as much a study of different characters in the movie as of action; there is also the sympathetic portrayal of former Confederates who are serving in the cavalry.Brittles' wife is buried here, and he visits her every so often to ""report in.""

30711,AK61LQI92GTCH,0780621832,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[5, 7]","It's 1876, Gen. George Custer has just recently led the 7th Calvary to defeat at the Little Big Horn, and Capt. Nathan Brittles has less than a week to go until retirement.  Before then, though, he has one last mission - to escort the fort's commander's wife and niece to a rendezvous point with the stagecoach that will take the two women eastward to civilization and safety.  The trip won't be easy, though.  Emboldened by Custer's defeat, formerly warring tribes are gathering together and joining forces against the white intruders.John Wayne plays Brittles in John Ford's SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, a big western with an elegantly clean and simple plot - get the women to the stage on time, get back to the fort alive. Much of the movie is played out against the backdrop of Monument Valley in Utah - the location most associated with Ford.  Photographer Winton Hoch won an Academy Award for color cinematography on this one.  Ford fills the cast with a number of regulars - besides Wayne, of course, there's Victor McLaglen as Sgt. Quincannon, comic relief and the biggest scene-stealer in the movie.  Joanne Dru plays the niece who `isn't army enough' to tough it out at the fort, while John Agar and Harry Carey Jr. play two young lieutenants who battle for her attention.  Ben Johnson, who'd win an Academy Award of his own for his role in `The Last Picture Show,' here plays a young sergeant on a fast horse, the scout who keeps track of the enemy (the party loses valuable time riding around, rather than through, the swiftly gathering foe.)There are a number of books on John Ford, and I risk repeating what I haven't yet read by going on too long about him.  One observation ought to suffice: Like most people I hate the hokey and the sugary sentimental, and I don't much care for directors who load their movies up with `em.  Ford, who may have been the most macho director ever to come out of Hollywood, had a depthless love for men under arms.  The horse soldiers in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON are, typically, impossibly heroic and gallant.  For instance, when a wounded soldier is brought into camp, he is framed heroically (if that makes sense,) resting his wounded head in the arms of a comrade while he gives his report to Capt. Brittles.  Later, when we come upon a mortally wounded soldier, Ford tarries a while with him, not only giving him dying words to say, but a lengthy graveside service and burial.  It's all too romantic and idealized to accept.And yet every time I watch a Ford war movie - and they've all got scenes similar to this - I'm totally drawn in.  Against my better judgment Ford makes me see the heroes he sees, thrill at their bravery and mourn their loss side by side with him.  That has to be one definition of genius.  For my money, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is one of the better Wayne/Ford collaborations, and one that ought not be missed.",5,The last patrol,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2882,"['1876', 'Gen.', 'George', 'Custer', 'just', 'recently', 'led', '7th', 'Calvary', 'defeat', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'Capt', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'less', 'week', 'go', 'retirement', 'then', 'though', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'escort', 'fort', 'commander', 'wife', 'niece', 'rendezvous', 'point', 'stagecoach', 'will', 'take', 'two', 'women', 'eastward', 'civilization', 'safety', 'trip', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'though', 'Emboldened', 'Custer', 'defeat', 'formerly', 'warring', 'tribes', 'are', 'gathering', 'together', 'joining', 'forces', 'white', 'intruders.John', 'Wayne', 'Brittles', 'John', 'Ford', 'SHE', 'WORE', 'YELLOW', 'RIBBON', 'big', 'western', 'elegantly', 'clean', 'simple', 'plot', 'get', 'women', 'stage', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'fort', 'alive', 'Much', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'backdrop', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Utah', 'location', 'most', 'associated', 'Ford', 'Photographer', 'Winton', 'Hoch', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'color', 'cinematography', 'one', 'Ford', 'cast', 'number', 'regulars', 'Wayne', 'course', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Sgt', 'Quincannon', 'comic', 'relief', 'biggest', 'scene-stealer', 'movie', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'niece', 'who', ""n't"", 'army', 'enough', 'tough', 'out', 'fort', 'John', 'Agar', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'play', 'two', 'young', 'lieutenants', 'who', 'battle', 'attention', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'who', ""'d"", 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'own', 'role', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'here', 'young', 'sergeant', 'fast', 'horse', 'scout', 'who', 'track', 'enemy', 'party', 'valuable', 'time', 'riding', 'around', 'rather', 'swiftly', 'gathering', 'foe', 'are', 'number', 'books', 'John', 'Ford', 'risk', 'repeating', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'going', 'too', 'long', 'One', 'observation', 'ought', 'suffice', 'most', 'people', 'hate', 'hokey', 'sugary', 'sentimental', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'directors', 'who', 'load', 'movies', 'em', 'Ford', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'macho', 'director', 'ever', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'depthless', 'love', 'men', 'arms', 'horse', 'soldiers', 'SHE', 'WORE', 'YELLOW', 'RIBBON', 'are', 'typically', 'impossibly', 'heroic', 'gallant', 'instance', 'when', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'brought', 'camp', 'framed', 'heroically', 'sense', 'resting', 'wounded', 'head', 'arms', 'comrade', 'report', 'Capt', 'Brittles', 'Later', 'when', 'come', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'Ford', 'while', 'not', 'only', 'giving', 'dying', 'words', 'say', 'lengthy', 'graveside', 'service', 'burial', 'too', 'romantic', 'idealized', 'accept.And', 'yet', 'time', 'watch', 'Ford', 'war', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scenes', 'similar', ""'m"", 'totally', 'drawn', 'Against', 'better', 'judgment', 'Ford', 'see', 'heroes', 'thrill', 'bravery', 'mourn', 'loss', 'side', 'side', 'be', 'one', 'definition', 'genius', 'money', 'SHE', 'WORE', 'YELLOW', 'RIBBON', 'one', 'better', 'Wayne/Ford', 'collaborations', 'one', 'ought', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",She Wore a Yellow Ribbon VHS

In the months following the massacre at the Little Bighorn, all the Indians tribes throughout the west, Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, are uniting to fight back and destroy the white population.  At Fort Starke, Captain Nathan Brittles has only six more days in the army before his retirement becomes official.  Before he can retire, Brittles must lead his cavalry troop on one last patrol to try and stop the coming Indian attack.  Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful westerns ever put on screen.  As expected with a John Ford western, the cinematography in Monument Valley is breathtaking with gorgeous vivid colors.  At the same time, the movie is a perfect example of a how a story should be told.  Ford takes his time developing the story, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and enjoy the scenery of Monument Valley.  It goes without saying that if you like this movie, check out Fort Apache and Rio Grande.John Wayne gives one of his best performances as Captain Nathan Brittles, a retiring cavalry officer who must lead his troop on one more patrol.  Any movie fan that denies getting a little teary-eyed during the scene where Brittles addresses his company for the last time is lying.  Joanne Dru  plays Olivia Dandridge, a young Eastern woman traveling with the troop.  John Agar and Harry Carey JR play Lt. Flint Cohill and Lt. Ross Penell, the young officers vying for Miss Dandridge's attention.  In an excellent supporting role, Ben Johnson plays Sergeant Tyree, an ex-Confederate officer serving as the company's scout/point man.  Ford regular Victor McLaglen is equally as good as Sgt. Quincannon, the hard-drinking veteran and friend of Brittles who is also retiring.  The movie also stars George O'Brien, Mildred Natwick, and Arthur Shields.  The DVD offers a beautifully remastered standard presentation, production notes, a brief 4-minute home video with the Duke and Ford scouting locations, and a theatrical trailer.
