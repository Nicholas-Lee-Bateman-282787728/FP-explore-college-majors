As his band plays and sings he closes his eyes, drawing in every individual tone and beat around him and singing.  His vocals are a distinct melody yet they echo with the band's music before, after and throughout.He is like a fine acoustic 12 string guitarI've watched it 3 times since purchasing it.I'd hazard a guess he's a perfectionist, maybe tough to work with.  Or he could be such a sweetheart people do their best work for him!  It takes hard work to make something this good.  YES!  I love it!!!",5,Stunning concert accompanied by excellent cinematography.,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,576,"['Rarely', 'do', 'see', 'performer', 'personal', 'resonance', 'Rob', 'Thomas', 'band', 'plays', 'sings', 'eyes', 'drawing', 'individual', 'tone', 'beat', 'singing', 'vocals', 'are', 'distinct', 'melody', 'yet', 'echo', 'band', 'music', 'throughout.He', 'fine', 'acoustic', '12', 'string', 'guitarI', ""'ve"", 'watched', '3', 'times', 'purchasing', 'it.I', ""'d"", 'hazard', 'guess', 'perfectionist', 'maybe', 'tough', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'sweetheart', 'people', 'do', 'best', 'work', 'hard', 'work', 'make', 'something', 'good', 'YES', 'love']",Rob Thomas: Something To Be Tour - Live At Red Rocks

I just didn't like it.  Not nearly as good as the Matchbox Twenty Soundstage concert I have seen on cable.  Rob looks old and pale and I'm just not impressed with the songs presented.  I'm not really a big fan of Rob's solo work as much as his Matchbox Twenty stuff, but he does some of both.  The best song on the disk is a David Bowie cover.  I doubt I will watch it again, whereas the Matchbox Twenty show I have watched many times on my DVR and still enjoy that immensely.",2,Disappointed,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,617,"['concert', 'captured', 'Soundstage', 'production', 'expected', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'bluray', 'disk', 'complaints', 'there', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', 'Soundstage', 'concert', 'have', 'seen', 'cable', 'Rob', 'old', 'pale', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'impressed', 'songs', 'presented', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Rob', 'solo', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', 'stuff', 'best', 'song', 'disk', 'David', 'Bowie', 'cover', 'doubt', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', 'show', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'DVR', 'still', 'enjoy', 'immensely']",Rob Thomas: Something To Be Tour - Live At Red Rocks
