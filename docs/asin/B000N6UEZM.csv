It also doesn't build on any other story lines the show has produced.What this OVA does offer is another adventure showing Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura using their skills in ways that have become common. Apparently this takes place sometime after the third Hokage dies, but there is no mention of his death.",3,"Not the best story for Naruto fans, but not the worst either",1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,685,"['fell', 'little', 'short', 'expectations', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'released', 'American', 'market', 'earlier', 'date', 'did', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'aired', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'would', 'recommend', 'Fans', 'show', 'add', 'disc', 'collection.For', 'looking', 'answers', 'certain', 'questions', 'raised', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', ""n't"", 'build', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'show', 'produced.What', 'OVA', 'offer', 'adventure', 'showing', 'Naruto', 'Sasuke', 'Sakura', 'using', 'skills', 'ways', 'have', 'become', 'common', 'Apparently', 'place', 'sometime', 'third', 'Hokage', 'dies', 'mention', 'death']",Naruto OVA - The Lost Story

Hardcore Naruto fans, and possibly people that have never seen Naruto and want a preview of what the series has to offer. If you hate Naruto, you'll hate this. If you don't mind Naruto, you won't mind this, but you'll wish you didn't buy it. This OVA is purely worth the money for hardcore Narutards. And with saying that... I'm glad I brought it. It's a good fix for fans of Naruto wanting just some good dumb Naruto fun.Taking place between the Zabuza arc and the Chunin Exams arc, it offers nothing new... but if you like what Naruto already offered at that time, you'll like this.Coming from a hardcore Naruto fan...

Instead we get this tripe, another chance for Naruto to show off instead of something actually interesting, characters other than the main doing ninja battles.
