Complete with dry wit and charm, Rene'e Zellweger takes the lead in this thoroughly benign and lovable portrayal  of Beatrix Potter, the fanciful creator of the 'Peter Rabbit' series.  (Which remains the most successful children's literature in UK history.  Although I wonder if 'Harry Potter' is giving her a run for her money.)A spinster still living at home, Beatrix is an avid artist who loves to sketch animals.  Her absorbing interest is illustrated by the pictures coming to life with animated motion whilst she talks to her creations.  Whether this is factual or fanciful matters little as it shows her zeal in her own creations, and effectively demonstrates how artists often have difficulty separating their own world with the ones they devise.  In the background is her interest in men late in life, a matter of importance to her family and especially her friend, Millie.  This aspect comes from the backdrop to the forefront as Mr. Warren, her publisher, not only fancies her books, but herself as well.Besides drawing a parallel with her absorbed interest in her work, Zellweger delivers a well-rounded sketch of her heroine.  We see Beatrix come face life on her own terms, blossoming late in life and becoming assertive with her own affairs.Seeming at first to have a perfect life, there is, nevertheless, heartache in portions to create some tension, but how she copes is itself keenly interesting.Entirely innocent and drawing from such humor as putting a nip of brandy in the holiday coffee and servants who line up to snoop on the latest family developments, make 'Miss Potter' enchanted entertainment, indeed.",4,A Charmed Life,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1667,"[""'Miss"", 'Potter', 'thoroughly', 'British', 'Complete', 'dry', 'wit', 'charm', 'Rene', 'e', 'Zellweger', 'lead', 'thoroughly', 'benign', 'lovable', 'portrayal', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'fanciful', 'creator', ""'Peter"", 'Rabbit', 'series', 'Which', 'most', 'successful', 'children', 'literature', 'UK', 'history', 'wonder', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', 'giving', 'run', 'money', 'spinster', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'Beatrix', 'avid', 'artist', 'who', 'sketch', 'animals', 'absorbing', 'interest', 'illustrated', 'pictures', 'coming', 'life', 'animated', 'motion', 'creations', 'factual', 'fanciful', 'matters', 'little', 'zeal', 'own', 'creations', 'effectively', 'how', 'artists', 'often', 'have', 'difficulty', 'separating', 'own', 'world', 'ones', 'devise', 'background', 'interest', 'men', 'late', 'life', 'matter', 'importance', 'family', 'especially', 'friend', 'Millie', 'aspect', 'backdrop', 'forefront', 'Mr.', 'Warren', 'publisher', 'not', 'only', 'books', 'well.Besides', 'drawing', 'parallel', 'absorbed', 'interest', 'work', 'Zellweger', 'well-rounded', 'sketch', 'heroine', 'see', 'Beatrix', 'come', 'face', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'blossoming', 'late', 'life', 'becoming', 'assertive', 'own', 'affairs.Seeming', 'first', 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'nevertheless', 'heartache', 'portions', 'create', 'tension', 'how', 'keenly', 'interesting.Entirely', 'innocent', 'drawing', 'such', 'humor', 'putting', 'nip', 'brandy', 'holiday', 'coffee', 'servants', 'who', 'line', 'up', 'snoop', 'latest', 'family', 'developments', 'make', ""'Miss"", 'Potter', 'enchanted', 'entertainment', 'indeed']",N/A

1053478,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000N4SHOE,AIROLF,"[3, 3]","Miss Potter is a beautifully imagined fairytale-like story of Beatrix Potter, the author of the best-selling children's stories, most notably The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Her life and love story are touching and her determination to become published and share her ""friends"" with the world are remarkable. Not content to simply be a children's writer, this is a woman who is responsible for one of the largest conservations efforts, with a donation of 4000 acres to the British Empire.If after Chicago and Cold Mountain there are still nonbelievers in Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's acting ability, with Miss Potter she proves that she can wholly transform into any role of her choosing. What Zellweger managed for Bridget Jones, she applies the same magic to Beatrix's character.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Moulin Rouge), who previously teamed up in Down with Love, share chemistry that is overwhelmingly delightful to watch.Finally, it must be said that the animations in the film are precisely on cue and manage to capture Potter's extraordinary illustrations.To compare this film to Finding Neverland, as so many reviewers have done, is to do Miss Potter a disservice. Miss Potter is captivating and light-hearted even when the subject matter is grim.

1053479,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000N4SHOE,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","Frankly, in the mist of time back to the days of my childhood, I was both fearful and delighted by the stories and illustrations of the famous English children's' book writer and illustrator who is the subject of this film, Ms. Beatrix Potter. Perhaps it was fear of the size of the animals in the editions that I would receive from a great aunt. Or because that aunt was poor but thoughtful it might have been the black and white illustrations in the editions that I received. (I was rather startled to see in this film that her work during her lifetime, at her fervent request to her publishers, was done in multi-colors.) Be that as it may be there are a couple of points that I want to make about this very interesting and well-acted film (particularly by Rene Zellweger as Ms.  Potter) which on the face of it would seem outside the parameters of the kind of thing that would interest me and the kinds of subjects that I tend to write about in this space.I am not sure how faithfully the creators of this film were to the biography of Ms. Potter's life, however, for my purpose that is neither here nor there. The story line here concerns (aside from the various romantic interests which a commercial film seemingly cannot do without even with accomplished middle class educated women like Ms. Potter or Ms. Jane Austen) the public flowering of the her story telling and illustrative talents under the guidance of a member of her publishing company (and eventual doom-struck lover) in early 20th century England.That, of course, is a feat worthy of recognition in and of itself as this is the height of the Victorian period in that country. Her pluck and fortitude as she runs up against the ill wishes of her middle class but very class conscious parents (particularly dear Mrs. Potter) is one of the themes that drive this film. Another is the fate of a thirty-two year old unmarried woman who, moreover, is not concerned about being married if it interferes with her chances for artistic success. Fair enough, but Mother England (to speak nothing of Mother Potter) does not approve.Finally, this film is a nice look at the fate of the creative artist who is in searching for her self-expression faces at least some condescension for being, merely, a children's' book writer (especially when she could be a ...wife and mother).Those are the interesting themes presented in this film. The way that Ms. Potter struggles and perseveres to become an independent person with her own resources and navigate her own course through life is another in a now long series of female ""uplift"" films.  This one is a worthy addition to that genre. As to the downside of Ms. Potter's story. The period under discussion was one of great social turmoil in England. This is, after all, the heyday of the women's suffragette movement led by the like of Sylvia Pankhurst (and her sister and mother) and of the emergence of a British Labor party led by Keri Hardie as well as other social experiments. There is no sense in this film that Ms. Potter was aware of such movements or much interested in them.No one expects an artist, a creative artist to boot, per se to devote their talents for the greater good of their society in a political way. However it helps. Ms. Potter did begin to display a little of that consciousness toward the end of the movie, after she broke from her family and set on her own course, and set up independently in the country and attempted to preserve her Lake District surroundings. But rather than belabor that point let me end with this thought. When we fight for and get a more just society than we have now then maybe there will be time and space enough for a thousand thousand Beatrix Potters to flourish. Until then watch this film and do not be afraid to read her little books with those little animal drawings.",4,In Defense Of Whimsy,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,3833,"['Frankly', 'mist', 'time', 'back', 'days', 'childhood', 'was', 'fearful', 'delighted', 'stories', 'illustrations', 'famous', 'English', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'illustrator', 'who', 'subject', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'fear', 'size', 'animals', 'editions', 'would', 'receive', 'great', 'aunt', 'aunt', 'was', 'poor', 'thoughtful', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'black', 'white', 'illustrations', 'editions', 'received', 'was', 'rather', 'startled', 'see', 'film', 'work', 'lifetime', 'fervent', 'request', 'publishers', 'was', 'done', 'multi-colors', 'Be', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'couple', 'points', 'want', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'film', 'particularly', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'face', 'would', 'seem', 'parameters', 'kind', 'thing', 'would', 'interest', 'kinds', 'subjects', 'tend', 'write', 'about', 'space.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'faithfully', 'creators', 'film', 'were', 'biography', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'life', 'however', 'purpose', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'line', 'here', 'concerns', 'aside', 'various', 'romantic', 'interests', 'commercial', 'film', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'even', 'accomplished', 'middle', 'class', 'educated', 'women', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'Ms.', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'public', 'flowering', 'story', 'telling', 'illustrative', 'talents', 'guidance', 'member', 'publishing', 'company', 'eventual', 'doom-struck', 'lover', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'England.That', 'course', 'feat', 'worthy', 'recognition', 'height', 'Victorian', 'period', 'country', 'pluck', 'fortitude', 'up', 'ill', 'wishes', 'middle', 'class', 'very', 'class', 'conscious', 'parents', 'particularly', 'dear', 'Mrs.', 'Potter', 'one', 'themes', 'drive', 'film', 'fate', 'thirty-two', 'year', 'old', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'who', 'moreover', 'not', 'concerned', 'being', 'married', 'chances', 'artistic', 'success', 'Fair', 'enough', 'Mother', 'England', 'speak', 'nothing', 'Mother', 'Potter', 'not', 'approve.Finally', 'film', 'nice', 'look', 'fate', 'creative', 'artist', 'who', 'searching', 'self-expression', 'least', 'condescension', 'being', 'merely', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'especially', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'wife', 'mother', 'are', 'interesting', 'themes', 'presented', 'film', 'way', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'struggles', 'perseveres', 'become', 'independent', 'person', 'own', 'resources', 'navigate', 'own', 'course', 'life', 'now', 'long', 'series', 'female', 'uplift', 'films', 'one', 'worthy', 'addition', 'genre', 'downside', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'story', 'period', 'discussion', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'social', 'turmoil', 'England', 'heyday', 'women', 'suffragette', 'movement', 'led', 'like', 'Sylvia', 'Pankhurst', 'sister', 'mother', 'emergence', 'British', 'Labor', 'party', 'led', 'Keri', 'Hardie', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'social', 'experiments', 'sense', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'was', 'aware', 'such', 'movements', 'much', 'interested', 'them.No', 'one', 'artist', 'creative', 'artist', 'boot', 'se', 'devote', 'talents', 'greater', 'good', 'society', 'political', 'way', 'However', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'did', 'begin', 'display', 'little', 'consciousness', 'end', 'movie', 'broke', 'family', 'set', 'own', 'course', 'set', 'up', 'independently', 'country', 'attempted', 'preserve', 'Lake', 'District', 'surroundings', 'rather', 'belabor', 'point', 'let', 'end', 'thought', 'When', 'fight', 'get', 'more', 'just', 'society', 'have', 'now', 'then', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'space', 'enough', 'thousand', 'thousand', 'Beatrix', 'Potters', 'flourish', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'read', 'little', 'books', 'little', 'animal', 'drawings']",N/A

1053519,AAWJ95HY4G2HN,B000N4SHOE,"Boomer ""CeeCee""","[17, 18]","First, if you think Renee Zellweger can't be convincing as a turn-of-the-20th-century upper class London lady, you're wrong.  Don't feel bad; I was too, and happy to find it out.  That being out of the way---""Love"" is one of those words that has been worked to death by the greeting card companies, the pop music industry and just about every commercial enterprise you can think of.  If you want to remember exactly what it means, this movie offers a good strong display of many of its best facets.  To name only a few examples:1.  Familial love:  Beatrix and her brother Bertram grew up sharing everything together from the nursery on.  Though Bertram's character disappers from the story while he is still a child, the adult Beatrix stauchly defends him in his absence, which comes to pass because he ""married beneath his station"" for--of all the screwy motives--love.  Beatrix loves her parents, and they love her, their inability to see eye-to eye on the subject of matrimony notwithstanding.  Her publisher/suitor Norman Warne seems very much at peace with his family, too.  Beatrix's father, Rupert, respects her enough to make his wife/her mother keenly aware that their daughter has done the family proud by becoming a famous published author and artist.  Heavens above--a movie without a single dysfunctional family!  Isn't that a miracle or something?2.  Romantic love:  The development of the love between Beatrix and Norman Warne is wonderful--true mutual respect and admiration and support of one another as individuals evolves into something downright enviable by the standards of any age--and all without any nudity.  From now on, if I ever  hear the tune ""Let Me Teach You How to Dance,"" it will bring a tear to my eye.  And if I don't hear it ever again, that'll do the same thing.4.  Love between friends:  The relationship between Beatrix and Warne's single 30-something sister, played admirably (as always) by Emily Watson, is female bonding at its best.  These 2 are in a culture that thinks a woman must marry to have a future that consists of more than tea and crumpets.  It's a real treat to watch these two defy the norm and support each other in that bent and in so many other things.  Whether they are defying the culture around them or one is rescuing the other from the throes of debilitating grief, they are feminine strength at its best.5.  Love for your fellow humans: Beatrix respects Mr. Heelis no less when they are children--and he is a farmhand's son while she is an aristocrat's daughter vacationing in the country--than she does when they are adults and he is a soliciter (that's a lawyer to us Yanks).  Her mother's references to ""trades people"" as if they were an inferior species are presented in a way that makes her attitude blatently absurd.  And there's that subtle, understated affection between the servants in the Potter household and the young Potters, expecially Beatrix, that defies description.6. Self love:  That's meant in the positive sense, as in self respect.  Beatrix respects herself enough as an artist to persist at her craft and her efforts to bring it to the masses, despite just about everyone's discouraging her to do so--till Norman.  Speaking of whom, Norman Warne respects himself enough to insist that he be allowed to prove himself in the family publishing business--and then do it.  His sister respects herself enough to remain respectable while not compromising to convention at all.  (I love it when she wins the big money playing whist with the gentlemen at the Potters' Christmas party while the real ""ladies"" are in another parlour singing carols.)7.  Love of the earth:  Though it hardly gets 10 minutes' exposure in the movie, do note that Beatrix Potter used the fortune she rightfully accumulated on her own to purchase 4000 acres of land in England's beautiful Lake District and preserve it in a trust for everyone to enjoy in perpetuity.  The clamor of residential real estate developers to buy up farm land and ""put it to a good use"" plunked this story right into the present moment.  I hope somebody besides me was taking heed.Great performances, great scenery, great story, great directing, great photography.

While many may know her as the author of the famous children's book `Tale of Peter Rabbit' and others, few are familiar with her trail blazing life and warrior spirit, as she not only broke the preconceived mold of womanhood prevalent in her day but played an instrumental part in protecting and preserving vast areas of the rural landscape that England is famous for.Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor make a wonderful team as business associates and would be lovers, Beatrix Potter and Norman Wayne. I also enjoyed Emily Watson in the role of Norman's sister Millie, but the real star of the film for me was Lucy Boynton who played the part of young Beatrix.

Renee Zellweger turns in a delicate and well-rounded performance in the title role, with fine support from Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson.In Victorian-era London, Miss Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger) is a 32-year-old spinster still living at home with her parents (Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn).  Her prospects for landing a husband evaporated long ago, so Beatrix decides to parlay her talents at painting and telling stories into a career as a children's author. The ""bunny book"" is rejected by many publishers until F. Warne & Co. decides to take Beatrix on, albeit reluctantly as a project for the shy and inexperienced Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor).  With help from Norman, a whole new world opens up to Beatrix, and in turn, Norman discovers his real feelings for his client.While MISS POTTER may take some small liberties with the truth, it's an endlessly-delightful movie treat for the whole family.  Renee Zellweger invests the character of Beatrix with an edgy, modern sensibility; in many respects Beatrix Potter was a woman born generations ahead of her time, refusing to accept conventions and existing on her own terms.  As previously utilised in the ""Bridget Jones"" movies, Zellweger's British accent is extremely convincing.  The movie also explores Potter's efforts to raise awareness in environmental conservation for the Lake District.The supporting cast is sublime.  Ewan McGregor delivers a deft and touching portrayal as the shy Norman, with Emily Watson perfectly-cast as his forthright sister Millie.  Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn manage to make a great impression as Potter's parents; they walk the fine line between reality and caricature.  Lucy Boynton is marvellous as the younger Beatrix in the flashback sequences.MISS POTTER is a delightful feel-good movie, wholesome without being sickly-sweet, and with a magnificent cast.  The period photography and costumes are beautiful as well.  I urge anyone who has ever been touched by the magic of the Beatrix Potter books to see this movie...you won't be disappointed.The DVD includes the featurette ""The Making of a Real-Life Fairytale"", ""When I Taught You How to Dance"" music video with Katie Melua, audio commentary with director Chris Noonan, and the trailer.

Despite her sweet oulook and strict upbringing, she had a mind of her own and a wonderful taste of art and beauty. Not to mention her shrewd business sense and her passion for nature and botany.Miss Potter the illustrator did not belong to the old ages - she was a pioneer, a woman of action and conservationist. The movie, despite or because of its lack of action, portrayed the serene English countryside just the way it is. This is a biography of a respectable lady.

1053544,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000N4SHOE,C. Middleton,"[14, 14]","When I was invited to view this film, admittedly there were a few reservations. A bio of the famous children's author and illustrator in 19th century England was not at the top of my ""must see"" film list. Although dragged along hesitantly, the film surpassed all expectations, leaving the theatre believing the world is a better place.Beatrix Potter is a woman to be admired and a model for young women to emulate even in the 21st century. An artist in the fullest sense of the term, she created animal characters and charming stories that continue to be read by millions of children and their parents today. What makes Potter an example is her devotion to her art form and her diligence to be published in a ""man's world"".Renee Zellweger is also a true artist, her acting seemingly getting better and better with every new project. Although her English accent has been the butt of jokes in the British media, she has those difficult nuances down pat when speaking the ""Queen's English"". For this particular role, she trained with a voice coach to ensure the accents authenticity, as many English actresses, wanting the part of the great English author, were poised and ready to pounce on Zellweger's performance, however, her performance left no room for criticism, as her role was played with subtlety and restraint.One of the many themes in this wonderful film is England's class snobbery, personified beautifully by Barbra Flynn, as Beatrix mother. Ironically, so-called upper middle-class society and money, as Beatrix so eloquently points out in the film, came from the working and merchant trades of the industrial revolution. When Miss Potter wants to marry her publisher (Ewan McGregor) she is prevented from doing so because he comes from the ""trade classes"". Beatrix attempts to overcome these hypocritical prejudices, and manages to negotiate a proposal to marry the man; however, the tale takes a serious turn at this point, moving the plot in another direction.Director Chris Noonan, to my knowledge, has not made a film since his masterpiece, Babe. Interestingly in both films animals have the mind and emotions of people. Noonan has brought that same magical atmosphere of Babe to Miss Potter giving each film an innocent quality without falling into sentimentality.Miss Potter is an enchanting film, pleasant to watch leaving the viewer feeling amiable and positive about the world.",5,Pleasant & Enchanting,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2399,"['When', 'was', 'invited', 'view', 'film', 'admittedly', 'were', 'few', 'reservations', 'bio', 'famous', 'children', 'author', 'illustrator', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'was', 'not', 'top', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'list', 'dragged', 'along', 'hesitantly', 'film', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'believing', 'world', 'better', 'place.Beatrix', 'Potter', 'woman', 'be', 'admired', 'model', 'young', 'women', 'emulate', 'even', '21st', 'century', 'artist', 'fullest', 'sense', 'term', 'created', 'animal', 'characters', 'charming', 'stories', 'continue', 'be', 'read', 'millions', 'children', 'parents', 'today', 'What', 'Potter', 'example', 'devotion', 'art', 'form', 'diligence', 'be', 'published', 'man', 'world', '.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'also', 'true', 'artist', 'acting', 'seemingly', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'new', 'project', 'English', 'accent', 'been', 'butt', 'jokes', 'British', 'media', 'difficult', 'nuances', 'down', 'pat', 'when', 'speaking', 'Queen', 'English', 'particular', 'role', 'trained', 'voice', 'coach', 'ensure', 'accents', 'authenticity', 'many', 'English', 'actresses', 'wanting', 'part', 'great', 'English', 'author', 'were', 'poised', 'ready', 'pounce', 'Zellweger', 'performance', 'however', 'performance', 'left', 'room', 'criticism', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'subtlety', 'restraint.One', 'many', 'themes', 'wonderful', 'film', 'England', 'class', 'snobbery', 'personified', 'beautifully', 'Barbra', 'Flynn', 'Beatrix', 'mother', 'Ironically', 'so-called', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'society', 'money', 'Beatrix', 'so', 'eloquently', 'out', 'film', 'came', 'working', 'merchant', 'trades', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'When', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'marry', 'publisher', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'prevented', 'doing', 'so', 'trade', 'classes', 'Beatrix', 'overcome', 'hypocritical', 'prejudices', 'negotiate', 'proposal', 'marry', 'man', 'however', 'tale', 'serious', 'turn', 'point', 'moving', 'plot', 'direction.Director', 'Chris', 'Noonan', 'knowledge', 'not', 'made', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'Babe', 'Interestingly', 'films', 'animals', 'have', 'mind', 'emotions', 'people', 'Noonan', 'brought', 'same', 'magical', 'atmosphere', 'Babe', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'giving', 'film', 'innocent', 'quality', 'falling', 'sentimentality.Miss', 'Potter', 'enchanting', 'film', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'amiable', 'positive', 'world']",N/A

It's the story of Beatrix Potter, the all-time best-selling author of children's books. It's about how she became an author, who helped, who didn't, who encouraged her, who didn't, and who she fell in love with and what happened with him. This is a very involving film, right from the start and it doesn't overstay its welcome at 92 minutes.This is one of those rare films in which, even in some of its tougher moments, and there were some, had me almost in tears many times. I guess I am hopeless romantic. Anyone who is will treasure this film, male or female. Anyone who appreciates beautiful scenery will treasure this, too. Some of the shots of the English countryside are absolutely stunning. This is a beautiful picture, visually and in story. There really isn't anything to criticize.Rene Zellweger gives an terrific performance as ""Beatrix Potter."" She is the second American actor I have heard on screen in the last two months speak with a British accent and do it well enough that I didn't think about it after a short time. (The other was Edward Norton in ""The Painted Veil.""). Zellweger and Ewan McGregor (""Norman Warne"") are about as charming a couple as you will ever see on film. The support from Emily Watson, Barbara Flynn, Bill Patterson and the rest of the cast also is first-rate.This is about a clean a movie as you'd ever see, too, regarding language and sex.

It captured late Victorian upper class society beautifully and the kind of family from which Beatrix Potter came very well.Yes, as all movies do, it took out a few poetic licenses, such as the fact she was 36 in 1902, not 32.  Also, the movie doesn't let us know that she had suffered from severe headaches and even fainting spells in her 20s, but still, the movie captures her wonderful eccentricities especially as they relate to her art.  Oh, and her brother, Rupert, was sent off to boarding school for his education.  However, he is out of the movie quite early and only referred to in passing.The love that develops between Beatrix (about my favorite performance ever from Renee Zellweger) and Norman Warne (touchingly done by Ewan McGregor) is charmingly done and involves us though we see it coming.  A key role in the film is Norman's sister, Millie (very well played by Emily Watson).  She is the real ground for Beatrix in the movie, I do not know the real life relationship between the two.  They have similar life experiences in being women of proper upper middle class late-Victorian households who did not find a suitable marriageable partner when young.  It is a fascinating friendship.  Just beware of anachronistically foisting our time's ridiculous views of same sex friendships on those times.I also think that the actors playing Beatrix's parents deserve real praise.  The father, Rupert (Bill Paterson), is an indulgent man who wishes deep down he had been an artist, but to be a proper Englishman of his time and of the class he desired, he had to take up the law.  However, he never practices it and spends his days at his club.  He is kind to Beatrix, but doesn't take her seriously until he has to.  The mother, Helen (Barbara Flynn), is a thoroughly conventional woman of her time with all the social ambition the family will ever need.  However, she hasn't a single clue about what a tremendous talent Beatrix is or her art.  Helen views Beatrix as really as something the family must bear and try to fix, however difficult that might be.  She is kind hearted and loving and has ambitions for her family, but if something has no social utility it is lost on her.A fine film and a great family film.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Frankly, I was delighted to see these stars shine without the usual gratuitous disrobing, blood, or foul language.

1053554,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000N4SHOE,Deborah Earle,"[3, 3]","Amid the beautiful and verdant English countryside, the tale of Beatrix Potter unfolds.In the role of the title character, Renee Zellweger is pert, and simply done-up, but perhaps a bit too emphatic at times with the British accent that comes so naturally to her co-stars.Through Chris Noonan's skillful and enchanting direction, we are privy to Miss Potter's initial meeting with the Warne Brothers at their publishing firm as her now-classic tale of Peter Rabbit is reluctantly launched by them.The project is handed to the youngest Warne Brother,novice publisher, Norman, played by a sunny and amiable Ewan McGregor(with a strong resemblance to the actual Norman Warne), who in the company of Beatrix' elderly chaperone, Miss Wiggin(Matyelok Gibbs),introduces her to the publishing process.We see her life at home in a cozy London apartment with her parents, Rupert and Helen (Bill Paterson, and Barbara Flynn). Her father, a lawyer who never really practiced his trade, spends most of his days at a men's club, but who has encouraged his daughter's artistic prowess since her childhood, as he was once an aspiring artist himself.Her class-conscious mother disapproves of Beatrix' non-conformist lifestyle, but by insisting that the family summer in the Lake District, as is fashionable, ultimately provides her daughter with inspiration for a more desireable lifestyle, and for more fodder for her childrens' stories than she could have imagined.Miss Potter has tea with Norman's mother(Phyllida Law) and becomes good friends with his sister, Millie (Emily Watson giving a performance with a lot of range, but mostly with strength).In the meantime, we are treated to flashbacks of Beatrix' childhood, at home, and also in the Lake District where the little girl(Lucy Boynton) and her brother Bertram (Oliver Jenkins) roam about, chase the animals that Beatrix loves and loves to draw, where the caretaker's son William Heelis(Justin McDonald) takes an interest in her drawings and paintings, and she listens to stories about fairy beasts told to her by her nanny, Fiona (Patricia Flannigan). But like many imaginative children who become writers, Beatrix creates her own stories.Interspersed with this tale of a teller of childrens' tales are moments when the drawings of Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, and others of Beatrix Potter's now-world-famous menagerie of friends spring to life before our eyes--delightful moments that illustrate how real these characters were to their creator.Beatrix' father is more impressed with her literary success than her mother, and Mrs. Potter  reluctantly invites  Norman and Millie to the family's Christmas party. The siblings hold up well amid the Potters' many titled guests, and there is more than one romantic moment between Norman and Beatrix.Apprehensive about the romance between the two, the Potters coax their daughter to summer with them in the Lake District once again, to see if her feelings will change.Little does Beatrix realize that on this journey, she will be saying farewell to her past and hello to her future.Tragedy strikes, but just beforehand, she reunites with her former acquaintance, William Heelis, who is now a country solicitor(played with charisma by a tall, clear-eyed, crinkly smiling, photogenic Lloyd Owen, who has delightfully rich coloring).Ultimately, the childrens' author is compelled to make a life for herself on her own terms at a time when that was rare for women, and along the way, she discovers that someone close to her has the same regard for her watercolor and pen-and-ink pals as she has.Viewers are treated to a gem of a true story, told with as much vivid imagination as the authoress herself might have had, if not more, and we glean from this sunny triumphant tale, lessons about independance, and of how life goes on after the worst happens.""We must present ourselves to the world!"" she tells her menagerie at the beginning, ""and we must think of it as an adventure!""Now the world can share in the adventure of the animal characters and their creator in a film that is destined to become a classic in its own right.",5,As We Watch Her Drawings Dance....,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,4116,"['beautiful', 'verdant', 'English', 'countryside',

1053559,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000N4SHOE,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 4]","Everyone has heard of Beatrix Potter--author of over twenty children's stories featuring the likes of tiny rabbits dressed in sweet blue waistcoats with brass buttons and fussy ducks bonneted in gingham and lace.  In ""Miss Potter,"" director Chris Noonan of talking pig, ""Babe,"" fame, does a fine job of recreating some of this quirky author's personal story featuring a charming romance that she had with her publisher, Norman Warne, and her apparent love of conservation as illustrated in the 4000 acres of Lake District property she left to Britain's National Trust.""Miss Potter,"" played resiliently by the unflappable Renee Zellweger, sparkles as gleefully as a cheery-cheeked chipmunk.  Eccentric indeed, the script has her pegged as half marriage-eschewing suffragette and half talking fearlessly to her animal creations that double as her only friends in a turn-of-the-century world that did not look kindly on spinsters who wanted to make their own way in life.  In her mid-thirties, Miss Potter definitely epitomizes ""over the hill'"" as her parents all too fondly remind her.  Her decision to have her ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit,"" published catapults the film's story into action, introducing Beatrix to Norman (a delightfully understated but earnest Ewan MacGregor still sounding wonderfully like a young Sir Alec Guiness), the Warne brother with little experience other than his family name in the matter of bringing the ""Bunny Book"" to print.  Together, they make quite the feisty team--she struggling to shrug off the role with which society and her parents encumber her, and he forging on to make big something his brothers deem a sentimental fluff piece in comparison to other offerings in their literary empire.Quite charmingly, they fall in love, amidst Noonan's whimsical animation of Beatrix's lovingly rendered characters.  Jemima Puddleduck mischievously bats her eyes and swishes her rear as Norman inspects her portrait.  Peter refuses to wear a blue ribbon while Beatrix daftly looks on, openly scolding her creations that accept Norman and his pledge of love with the same twinkling nonchalance of their creator.  Adding to the charm is Zellweger's natural exuberance and delightful surprise at Mr. Warne's attentions.  The dance scene between them and Beatrix's wonderfully imaginative depiction of Norman and his sister as they leave the Potter townhouse exemplifies the film's ability to enchant.Unfortunately, the remaining thirty minutes of the movie move in a completely different direction.  The whimsy still exists, however the whole conclusion seem a little hurried to me; Beatrix and Co. abandon London and take up a long desired residence in the Lake District.  In too many picture perfect scenes, we watch her take idyllic walks amongst vistas so green they appear almost photographed through a warming filter. Understandably, the story must wind down and we must see Potter as history records her, however, I think more could have been made of her single-mindedness with regard to her property acquisition and the manner in which she decided to end out her days.  The abrupt ending of the fairytale aspect of this biopic disappoints; I wanted more characters coming to life and mingling with the ordinary humans.Bottom line?  In the tradition of ""Becoming Jane,"" ""Miss Potter"" takes the usual cinematic liberties in relating the bittersweet story of yet another British author's rise to fame and fortune.  With warmth and whimsy, director Chris Noonan does this tale of Peter Rabbit's creator justice, interjecting the sweet with the sad along with some memorable performances by Emily Watson as Norman's sister, Millie, and Barbara Flynn and Bill Paterson as Beatrix's formidable parents.

1053571,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000N4SHOE,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","For the most part, Chris Noonan turns out to be ideal director for this engaging 2006 biopic of renowned children's book author Beatrix Potter (The Tale of Peter Rabbit) as he has proven to be a master of whimsical touches with 1995'sBabe. He has the requisite light touch to bring a welcome breeziness and gentle poignancy to what could have otherwise been an unremitting historical slog. At the same time, dealing with the sanctity of a beloved real-life figure rather than the travails of a talking pig, Noonan faces greater challenges in bringing a deeper resonance to Potter's life story. Fortunately, the first-time screenplay by Broadway director Richard Maltby, Jr. contains well-considered dialogue that doesn't get too precious, and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, dusting off her flawless Brit-speak fromBridget Jones's Diary, gives one of her most textured and likeable performances in the title role.Set in Victorian-era England, the story starts with the begrudging acceptance of Potter's manuscript for Peter Rabbit by the Harold and Fruing Warne, a pair of curmudgeonly brothers running a publishing house. Already assuming it will be a failure, they see her small children's book as a safe means to test the business mettle of their younger brother Norman. What happens instead is the meeting of kindred spirits who fall in love. Her book is an immediate success even though her parents, especially her social climbing mother, disapprove of not only her professional activities but also her budding romance with what they consider a tradesman beneath their standing. The first part of the film shifts back and forth between childhood scenes where you can witness the young Beatrix develop her talent and passion for drawing and storytelling. A personal tragedy occurs later in the film which leads Potter to buy a bucolic farm in England's Lakes District. There she develops a proto-environmentalist's mindset and starts buying the surrounding properties to ensure the land stays pristine as working farms.With her ruddy complexion and modest period garb, Zellweger manages to capture the eccentricity of Potter's character without falling heavily into coy mannerisms. She gets help from Noonan's periodic use of animation to bring Potter's characters to life when she is alone. It's a decidedly Disney-style movie technique, but somehow it works in this context. As the shyly affable Norman, Ewan McGregor cuts a charming figure if not that much of a gravitational force in the story. Luckily, Zellweger and McGregor are more suitably matched here than in their previous coupling in 2003's execrable retro-romance,Down with Love. Emily Watson has a field day playing Norman's spinsterish, suffragette sister Millie. As Beatrix's parents, Barbara Flynn gets to play her pompous mother with relish, while Bill Paterson provides several touching moments as her quietly supportive father. All the production aspects are first-rate - Martin Childs' period production design, Andrew Dunn's picture-perfect cinematography, Anthony Powell's unobtrusive costumes.The 2007 DVD has several solid extras. Noonan provides an informative, often entertaining commentary track, but I wish Zellweger or others participated to fill in some of the empty audio stretches. Two featurettes are included. The more interesting is the twenty-minute ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter"", which takes a closer look at the author, her creative inspirations, her passion for naturalism, and her marketing and merchandising acumen. The other is the expected making-of short, a little long at 23 minutes but it does highlight the production process with plenty of interviews with cast and crew. Rounding out the features are the theatrical trailer and a music video of Katie Melva performing ""When You Taught Me How to Dance"", the song Beatrix and Norman sing and dance to at her family's Christmas party.",4,Surprisingly Deft Look at a Most Accomplished Woman Embodied Convincingly by Zellweger,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3893,"['most', 'part', 'Chris', 'Noonan', 'out', 'be', 'ideal', 'director', 'engaging', '2006', 'biopic', 'renowned', 'children', 'book', 'author', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'proven', 'be', 'master', 'whimsical', 'touches', ""1995'sBabe"", 'requisite', 'light', 'touch', 'bring', 'welcome', 'breeziness', 'gentle', 'poignancy', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'unremitting', 'historical', 'slog', 'same', 'time', 'dealing', 'sanctity', 'beloved', 'real-life', 'figure', 'rather', 'travails', 'talking', 'pig', 'Noonan', 'greater', 'challenges', 'bringing', 'deeper', 'resonance', 'Potter', 'life', 'story', 'Fortunately', 'first-time', 'screenplay', 'Broadway', 'director', 'Richard', 'Maltby', 'Jr.', 'well-considered', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'precious', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'dusting', 'off', 'flawless', 'Brit-speak', 'fromBridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'one', 'most', 'textured', 'likeable', 'performances', 'title', 'role.Set', 'Victorian-era', 'England', 'story', 'begrudging', 'acceptance', 'Potter', 'manuscript', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Harold', 'Fruing', 'Warne', 'pair', 'curmudgeonly', 'brothers', 'running', 'publishing', 'house', 'Already', 'assuming', 'will', 'be', 'failure', 'see', 'small', 'children', 'book', 'safe', 'test', 'business', 'mettle', 'younger', 'brother', 'Norman', 'What', 'instead', 'meeting', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'book', 'immediate', 'success', 'even', 'parents', 'especially', 'social', 'climbing', 'mother', 'disapprove', 'not', 'only', 'professional', 'activities', 'also', 'budding', 'romance', 'what', 'consider', 'tradesman', 'standing', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'childhood', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'witness', 'young', 'Beatrix', 'develop', 'talent', 'passion', 'drawing', 'storytelling', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'later', 'film', 'Potter', 'buy', 'bucolic', 'farm', 'England', 'Lakes', 'District', 'proto-environmentalist', 'mindset', 'buying', 'surrounding', 'properties', 'ensure', 'land', 'pristine', 'working', 'farms.With', 'ruddy', 'complexion', 'modest', 'period', 'garb', 'Zellweger', 'capture', 'eccentricity', 'Potter', 'character', 'falling', 'heavily', 'coy', 'mannerisms', 'help', 'Noonan', 'periodic', 'use', 'animation', 'bring', 'Potter', 'characters', 'life', 'when', 'alone', 'decidedly', 'Disney-style', 'movie', 'technique', 'somehow', 'context', 'shyly', 'affable', 'Norman', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'charming', 'figure', 'not', 'much', 'gravitational', 'force', 'story', 'Luckily', 'Zellweger', 'McGregor', 'are', 'more', 'suitably', 'matched', 'here', 'previous', 'coupling', '2003', 'execrable', 'retro-romance', 'Down', 'Love', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'Norman', 'spinsterish', 'suffragette', 'sister', 'Millie', 'Beatrix', 'parents', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'play', 'pompous', 'mother', 'relish', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'several', 'touching', 'moments', 'quietly', 'supportive', 'father', 'production', 'aspects', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Martin', 'Childs', 'period', 'production', 'design', 'Andrew', 'Dunn', 'picture-perfect', 'cinematography', 'Anthony', 'Powell', 'unobtrusive', 'costumes.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'several', 'solid', 'extras', 'Noonan', 'informative', 'often', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'wish', 'Zellweger', 'others', 'participated', 'fill', 'empty', 'audio', 'stretches', 'Two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'included', 'more', 'interesting', 'twenty-minute', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'closer', 'look', 'author', 'creative', 'inspirations', 'passion', 'naturalism', 'marketing', 'merchandising', 'acumen', 'other', 'expected', 'making-of', 'short', 'little', 'long', '23', 'minutes', 'highlight', 'production', 'process', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Rounding', 'out', 'features', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'music', 'video', 'Katie', 'Melva', 'performing', 'When', 'Taught', 'Me', 'How', 'Dance', 'song', 'Beatrix', 'Norman', 'sing', 'dance', 'family', 'Christmas', 'party']",N/A

(It would have to be, since his biggest credit thus far is as writer/director of the classic BABE--but not the sequel!)Here, Beatrix Potter-Heelis (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in what is hailed as the performance of a lifetime) is followed from her young adulthood to her marriage to country solicitor William Heelis (the great Lloyd Owen). Starting with her success as a children's author (THE children's author?) and ending with her purchase of Lake District land, the film breathes. I mean, it truly breathes with locations, costume (no designs, they used off-the-rack genuine stuff), perfect acting and a hint of the jolly humor Beatrix showed in abundance.Though I'm no expert on Beatrix, this dvd has two delightful, 20-minute-long documentaries explaining the life of Beatrix and the making of this film. Well worth it. In the biography, I learned that Beatrix married Heelis later in life, and there is no mention of her engagement to her publisher Norman Warne (perfectly cast Ewan MacGregor, allegedly Zellweger's idea). I do know that the Warnes are still around and in business.One thing I adored about this film was the attention paid to the actual composition/publication of the books, though it does not touch the number of books Beatrix published. It also shies away from her marketing genius: she virtually invented ""marketing rights"" and had royalties pouring in from endless sources, not just her books. She could have sold film rights...who knows.The addition of Bill Paterson as Beatrix's father Rupert and Barbara Flynn as her mother Helen is the most perfect casting I think I've ever seen in any film. Without over-burdening the film, these two immortals add the perfect weight to the portrayal of Beatrix's life. Indeed, this film could not have been done without them!My other favorites David Bamber (VALKYRIE) as Frewing Warne, Anton Lesser as Harold Warne and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's mother) as Mother Warne only add to the expert family quality of this great film. A surprise is in the character of Millie Warne (Emily Watson), Beatrix's best friend. Finally, kudos to the rarely seen Matyelok Gibbs as Ms. Wiggin, Beatrix's governess/chaperone.I can't say enough about this priceless gem, one of the unforgettable cinema classics of the 2000s. Get it and let your kids immerse themselves in it--especially if they like Beatrix's books (or even if they like Harry Potter).

""Miss Potter"" was a cutting-edge woman in the early 1900s, bucking the trend of settling down into a proper, upper-class marriage, turning instead to the dream of drawing and writing. Her seemingly childish endeavors made her an extremely wealthy woman, with her books becoming some of the bestselling children's stories of all time.The story centers around Beatrix Potter's personal goals as an artist, and around her romantic notions with her publisher.

Her overbearing mother (Barbara Flynn) disapproves of Beatrix' preoccupation with matters other than proper marriage and her father (Bill Patterson) supports her art but knows his daughter is not a 'fine artist'.  Yet on a fluke Beatrix wins over the publishing firm of the Warne Brothers: offering to publish her books is more to appease the youngest brother Norman (Ewan McGregor) who pleads for a project that will make him part of the family business than to lend credibility to Potter's output.  Potter and Norman Warne connect over the simple beauty of the books and with Norman's sister Millie (Emily Watson) the three find success in a difficult industry - one especially onerous for female authors.The story of Norman and Beatrix's developing love, appalling to her parents, includes a period of parental imposed separation as Beatrix moves to the Lake Country to write and paint and continue her growing passion for Norman in delicate letters.  Norman succumbs to an illness and his death devastates Beatrix and Millie.  Beatrix manages to temper her mourning with a newfound passion in the Lake Country, and with the help of  her old friend William Heelis (Lloyd Owen), she purchases her Lake Country home and as one of the first 'environmentalists' she buys the surrounding farms to prevent their destruction by corporate industrial greed.  Beatrix Potter has become a wealthy woman through her own triumph as a writer and illustrator of children's books and finds restored happiness in securing the fairytale countryside where her 'friends' continue to help her weave tales that remain to this time some of the world's finest stories.The visuals of this film, from the opening sequences of watercolor preparation to the enchanting vistas of the Lake Country, are stunningly beautiful. The script by Richard Maltby, Jr. remains rather superficial, but director Chris Noonan makes the best of a thin storyline to create a warmly human view of Potter.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Beatrix inhabits the roles in all but her flawed British accent, a factor that unfortunately stretches credibility in the presence of the rest of the professional cast.  But she captures Potter's determination and vulnerability and in the end she wins our hearts. This is a fine little film that pays homage to a great lady of the literary arts: it is as unfettered and simple as the durable classics Potter left as her legacy.

1053601,ANPE9R0D2G8AO,B000N4SHOE,Inanna Arthen,"[0, 0]","The box design for the DVD of this movie is a good example of how film promo can be entirely misleading. Renee Zellweger's smirk over her shoulder and the dreamy-looking man with her makes this movie look like a period *Bridget Jones Diary,* and that could hardly be further off the mark. *Miss Potter* is the portrait of an extremely talented and productive artist and story-teller in a age when women were cursed to have those gifts. She was fortunate enough to have wealth, at least one sympathetic parent and a will of iron. But the love story catalyzed her life, it didn't define it. Beatrix Potter was a woman who was startled to find love, rather than one who ever sought it.The period detail is meticulously done, but even more authentic is the film's presentation of the internal life of an artist/writer, a way of being that only writers and artists can fully understand and which is rarely recreated well onscreen. Anyone who is an artist or writer, especially a woman who struggles against disapproval and family obligations to find validity, will resonate with &#34;Miss Potter's&#34; experiences. Her success is inspiring, and the film (unlike the DVD box) does not gloss over Beatrix's age (late 30s) when she finds both love and acclaim, which is equally inspiring in another way. In Victorian terms she was an &#34;old maid&#34; (accompanied by an elderly chaperone almost every step she took). Even in modern times film tends to give us youthful overachievers in roles of authority or skill.

1053602,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000N4SHOE,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[9, 9]","This biopic, starring Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as famed children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter, is director Chris Noonan's first feature film since the enchanting Babe, released eleven years ago. Even though Zellweger's goofy brand of charm swept me off my feet in movies like Nurse Betty and Bridget Jones's Diary, I prepared to go on auto-pilot while I watched what I thought would be a benign but sappy ""chick flick.""Yet, when the opening credits rolled, I sat straight up as Zellweger dipped her painbrush into a water glass. In the close-up of the stirring brush, the water turns from translucent to a deep royal blue. I was struck with the sense of instant recognition upon seeing the work of a great but forgotten artisan materialize before my eyes.No, I'm not referring to Beatrix Potter, but to another woman from the early twentieth century, Natalie Kalmus. From the 1930s through 1950, she was color consultant for Technicolor, the company behind the opulent film process invented by her husband, Herbert Kalmus. For without Technicolor--a process Natalie Kalmus supervised down to the choice of paint and wardrobe fabric colors for such movies as Gone With the Wind, Duel In the Sun, and The Red Shoes--Miss Potter's director of photography Andrew Dunn would have had difficulty capturing that particularly saturated hue of royal blue.This is no small detail. While there have been great advances in multi-channel digital sound, nothing on the visual side has ever topped the warmth and feel of Technicolor's dye-transfer prints, which the company reintroduced to the screen in 1998 after a twenty-year absence. Although they discontinued that process in 2002, they've been able to maintain that trademark ""look,"" working with filmmakers at every step of production to create lush, vivid final prints with a new proprietary photochemical process. How fitting that this movie chose to honor the work of an artist whose exacting attention and mania for color detail in the printing of her work matched that of another.Miss Potter opens as thirty-two-year-old spinster Beatrix Potter occupies an upstairs bedroom of her upper-crust parents' London home. While it would seem she leads a charmed life of comfort and security, Beatrix is a veritable child-woman, bereft of both connubial bliss and human companionship outside her family, her life dominated by her snobbish, uptight mother (Barbara Flynn). Having rejected one unsuitable suitor after another (products of her mother's matchmaking), she has sworn off marriage. It appears that this poor little rich girl is fated to grow old, gray, and barren--as though she'd never lived at all.Beatrix's predicament is that she's a decidedly eccentric personality trapped in a period when the social circles prescribed and proscribed by rigid British formality allow for very little behavioral deviation, particularly from women. She has no friends to speak of, save for the cheeky farm animals that she sketches and paints. In fact, the lonely woman carries on imaginary, though serious, conversations with Peter Rabbit, Hunca Munca, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and Benjamin Bunny. In mid-drawing, she stops to scold them for their mischievousness, scrunching her nose, dimpling her cheeks, and squinting at them. In delightful, colorfully animated watercolor sequences, they wink back, oink, and shake their tail feathers. If another American actress affecting an English accent (such as Gwyneth Paltrow) had been cast in this silly role, I'd probably have left the theater straightaway. But Zellweger has such an irrepressible ebullience that her dotty prattle seems whimsical and endearing.Little does Beatrix realize that her miniature, imaginary world holds the key that will let her escape the lonely house and make her way in the real world. When she calls upon a publisher, portfolio in hand, the Warne Pothers (Anton Lesser and David Bamber) at first dismiss her children's book as unprofitable nonsense. But they decide to publish The Tale of Peter Rabbit anyhow, as a sop to their younger Pother, Norman. Acted with spirited resolve by Ewan McGregor, the sissified Norman has tired of ""playing nursemaid"" to his elderly mother and finally put his foot down, demanding a position in the family business. He takes Beatrix's ""bunny book"" quite seriously and throws himself into its publication.Now, movies with mama's boys named Norman usually wind up with female corpses in the bathtub, but this tale's passions are far more sensible. Norman's inexperience winds up being a boon to Beatrix, who's initially skeptical about his business acumen. He allows her to carefully supervise the book's presentation and printing. Soon, their business partnership blossoms into romance, although Beatrix's mother disapproves of her whirlwind courtship (as she intones, aghast) ""with a tradesman.""Unfortunately, in order to give us a glimpse into her furry characters' origins, the film takes side excursions into Potter's childhood that almost undermine the movie. Child actress Lucy Boynton's portrayal of young Beatrix comes off as snotty and petulant. If the movie were merely about Beatrix Potter's quirky little ""drawrings,"" then it would appear that she hasn't matured at all since childhood, except by no longer being annoying.However, the movie's true drama is about Beatrix's maturing into a level-headed, business-savvy woman, and the main story arc, as old as Romeo and Juliet, redeems the picture. Norman's marriage proposal forces Beatrix, for the first time in her life, to make a decision against her parents' wishes. Upon visiting her banker, she discovers that her books have made her wealthy beyond her wildest dreams. Now having the means to strike out on her own, Beatrix finally chooses independence.Richard Maltby's script also touches upon Potter's tireless efforts as a conservationist. Here, the Technicolor effect is felt most strongly, conveying breathtaking mountain and waterfront vistas filmed on location in the Isle of Man and Scotland. Another nice touch, I thought, was how the script related Potter's efforts to preserve her beloved Cumbria from land development and possible ecological despoilment. Although shown silently attending a meeting of local agitators, our Miss Potter's solution is to attend a real-estate auction and to bid on a foreclosed farm. It's an uncomplicated (though perhaps unintentional) demonstration of how the free market can provide non-governmental solutions to its own perceived failings. By the time she died, in fact, Beatrix Potter had bequeathed to the National Trust for preservation thousands of acres in England's scenic Lake District.Complementing quietly heart-rending portrayals by Zellweger and McGregor is a poignant one from Bill Paterson, playing Beatrix's enthusiastically supportive father.  When he makes a point of purchasing one of her books, she protests that she could have simply given him a copy. ""But I wanted to buy one, like everyone else,"" he replies, beaming with a parent's pride. Emily Watson also turns in a quirky performance as Norman's sister, Millie, a proto-feminist who wears neckties and encourages Beatrix's nonconformist aspirations.While composer Nigel Westlake's score is treacly during the film's ""fairy tale"" moments, he does what any sensible British film composer ought to during scenes depicting Beatrix's and Norman's ardor and sorrows: he lifts heavily from Elgar and Vaughan Williams, which is always welcome to my ears.And though the story is uneven in its exposition, I nonetheless found a soft spot in my heart for Miss Potter. It's a tender film that transforms the screen into a stunning Technicolor storybook, as is appropriate for this hugely popular children's author. Projecting a quirky, benevolent sense of life, Miss Potter carries itself with quiet dignity and shows how one woman gained the world by keeping her soul.",4,Color Me Charmed,1189123200,"09 7,

There is an amazing and real feeling of the repression of the age, where even taking a lady's hand was fraught with meaning.

If you liked ""Finding Neverland"" and its magical feel and look, you will love ""Miss Potter"". Okay, I admit I read all of her books as a young child, and loved the stories and illustrations, and seeing this film makes me want to read the books again! Like Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie in ""Finding Neverland"", Zellweger plays Beatrix Potter who, though ""grown up"" takes pure joy in her total dedication to her inner child and is not ashamed to do so, in spite of much criticism for her reluctance to lead a ""normal"" life. The film is beautifully photographed and acted and draws us into both Potter's ""real"" life and her fantasy life she shares with ""her friends"", i.e., her beautiful little illustrations that delight us with their life-like, often unexpected animations. Just as ""Finding Neverland"" whisks us away to childhood innocence and teaches us to fly, ""Miss Potter"" leads us down a similar path with a similar message: WHY do we have to leave childhood in the past? Both Depp and Zellweger never cease to amaze me with their range of acting because I never catch them reminding me that what I am seeing is nothing other than the truth.

In fact, I am thinking of pairing them up as holiday gifts for members my family!The reason for this is that both capture the magic which I recall so very clearly, when I read the stories written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter as a little girl. I had all the books, and I also had several porcelain statues (I had Mrs. Tiggywinkle and also Jeremy Fisher. If someone was making a collection for me, that is as far as they got!). Everything connected to Beatrix Potter and her stories was enchanting to me.  If you grew up with a love of Beatrix Potter, be sure to see this film. It is beautful and moving as well.  You can enjoy the tale of Beatrix herself, a strong and fascinating woman, way ahead of her time,  while revelling in the loveliness of the scenery (the North Country of Scotland). You can respond to the charm of her drawings (which sometimes animatedly wink at you--so alive they were to her! They were her ""friends""--she was a lonely child and young woman).  You can fall for her love story, which is sad indeed concerning her love life in her thirties, after the joy of true love was wrested away from her when she lost the great love of her life, underplayed in a sweet and most marvelous manner by Ewan Mcgregor, as her publisher, Norman, who was the first person who truly believed in the potential of her books.Ultimately Beatrix is triumphant in every way, healing in her farmhouse in the country and drawing again. Finally in love a second time, she continues to write and begins protecting her beloved countryside from developers. This will become one of her life's great purposes.Beatrix Potter, played to perfection by Rene Zellweger, was a shy yet determined woman. Rene Zellweger consistently amazes me by the perfection of her performances. I don't like her looks, frankly (hey, sorry!), and yet because she is such a very good actress, I find that I appreciate her value and outstanding contributions in every movie she is in. She is so good as Beatrix Potter, it's uncanny. I also think that Emily Watson as Norman's sister Millie really adds a lot to the plot. She makes the most of her part. She is downright excellent as a vunerable yet ""tough on the outside"" spinster, capable of great love, who has been dealt some bad cards in life, love-wise (Whist, anyone?). Several scenes between her and Beatrix are really memorable.I suggest you rent or buy this film and do as I did: if you like this film, maybe get the book I mentioned as well. You will be in for a great time if you love Beatrix Potter!

A biography of the life and times of the beloved children's author, Beatrix Potter, this film brings to life her incredible world and vivid imagination.  Sweet, joyful, and touching, MISS POTTER is not to be missed.Beatrix Potter lived a unique and rich life inside her head.  Her friends, Peter Rabbit, Jemimah Puddle-duck, Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, and a host of others, jumped out of her fertile, active mind and on to the water-color pages she so lovingly painted.  A spinster at the turn of the century, Beatrix Potter over came her quirkiness and shyness to become the world's best known children's author.  By a sheer twist of fate, she was thrown together with a publisher who believed in her and her work.  She remained innocent and naive throughout most of her life, unaware of her fame and her fortune, and under the thumb of a mother who did not understand her or believe in her.  Eventually, she finds her own way, and the children everywhere, and the entire world, are much richer for it.MISS POTTER is beautifully acted with stunning locations.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is simply delightful in the title role, and Ewan McGregor is outstanding as the one person who believes in her completely.  They are magical together, making this film a joy to behold.  The lush settings and locations are gorgeous; the colors leap off the screen, enveloping the audience in Beatrix Potter's life.Multiple generations of my family were touched by this this celebration of Beatrix Potter on a quiet Christmas afternoon.

When Beatrix falls in love with her editor, her parents object to the match because they deem their daughter's fiance to be beneath her socially.  Much of the film is shot in England's Lake District which makes a breathtaking background for the film.  Whether it is historically accurate or not, the film is charming and is highly recommended for anyone who loves Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter's other books.",5,Charming movie,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,952,"['Renee', 'Zellweger', 'right', 'notes', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'single', 'woman', 'upper-class', 'family', 'who', 'customs', 'day', 'publishing', 'children', 'books', 'falling', 'love', 'editor', 'beginning', 'movie', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'Beatrix', 'was', 'precocious', 'painter', 'storyteller', 'childhood', 'adult', 'not', 'marry', 'instead', 'children', 'books', 'mother', 'never', 'success', 'instead', 'worries', 'proprieties', 'social', 'standing', 'When', 'Beatrix', 'love', 'editor', 'parents', 'object', 'match', 'deem', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'be', 'socially', 'Much', 'film', 'shot', 'England', 'Lake', 'District', 'breathtaking', 'background', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'not', 'film', 'charming', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'other', 'books']",N/A

Animated bunnies and other creatures frolicked across the page and the movie seemed to move along slowly, so, I didn't expect to love it when I actually sat down to watch it.Instead I was surprised. The cover hints of a great quirky romance. The romance is understated and tragic, but sweet nonetheless. The inexperienced Mr. Warne and Miss Potter fumbled through endearingly. The bigger focus of the film was Beatrix herself. I don't know how I feel about the animated characters that she created in her mind. Part of me is creeped out, but part of me fully understands eccentricities.The history and customs, the simplicity and society add to the movie. The tragedy sadly unfolds in a time where bad news often arrived too late. This is so foreign to me since anyone I need to talk to can be reached within just a few hours if not minutes so the timing situation added an extra measure of poignancy for me.This would be a great film for older elementary age girls who get caught up in the fairy tale of Prince Charming since Beatrix follows her heart, hones her talent and leaves behind a world that was better for her presence in it. There is very little ""action"" and those who can't stand languid films won't be able to sit comfortably through it.

The animals the Potters consorted with are made of animation, so they move, dance and wiggle as Miss Potter talks to them.  Sometimes, her drawing skills bring the papers to life and the papers crinkle up and twitch like a real duck would.  Then she chuckles.  ""Naughty Jemima Puddle Duck,"" she murmurs throatily.  It's Renee Zellweger from CHICAGO and COLD MOUNTAIN playing a Potter for the first time--she fits right in to the world of jolly old England circa the 1900s.  Although the events of this latest Potter take place decades before Harry goes to Hogwarts Abbey, you get the same kind if family dynamic going on.  In Victorian London little Beatrix is ignored and patronized by a mean mother and absent father and pesky little brother Bertram, just as Harry is abused and picked on by the Dursley family, fat old Uncle Vernon, nasty Petunia, and the little monster boy, Dudley Dursley.  As we learn, as a girl Miss Potter was not allowed to attend Hogwarts Academy (nor any school, for most girls were educated at home by governesses and private tutors).The DVD features a great documentary about the real life Miss Potter who, due to her snobby family's imposing connections, became acquainted with the great Pre-Raphaelite painter Millsis (1829-1896), who praised the intricate nature drawings of little Miss Potter and encouraged her in her task of bringing the animals to life.  Fans of the Potter series will enjoy the documentary about Peter Rabbit and how he came to be.  Ewan McGregor (from STAR WARS and MOULIN ROUGE) plays the love interest, Norman Warne, who encourages Miss Potter to talk to the animals.  For Christmas she makes him a special present, a painting of the rabbit's Christmas party, which he treasures as long as he lives.A lovely romance ensues, with not just Norman, but also with Willie Heelis, a gardener boy (or something), and later on in life Miss Potter finally gets it together to buy all the land surrounding Hill Top Farm and turn it into eternal preserve of beauty in the Lake District of England.The Potters guard an ancestral treasure that plays a secret melody when Norman touches it, a music box encoded with the heartrending theme song, When You Taught Me How to Dance.  This theme is also sung over the credits by Katie Melua, the Georgian/Irish pop singer who made this track a hit in Lake District gift shops and in tea rooms in San Francisco here when we want a shot of Potter-mania, we hear it.  Its delicate air is like a breath of spring, and yet it has a fey note of shadowy foreboding to it, as though somewhere around the corner, lurks the shadow of the First World War and, or am I reaching, the hideous form of Lord Voldemort, with words by Richard Maltby Jr. screenwriter of this latest Potter film, and music by Mike Batt--who wrote the haunting song ""Bright Eyes"" as the theme for that other famous rabbit movie, WATERSHIP DOWN.",5,When He Taught Miss Potter How to Dance,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,3107,"['guy', 'video', 'store', 'told', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'was', 'younger', 'sister', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'loved', 'Harry', 'would', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'branch', 'family', 'talked', 'animals.It', 'was', 'so', 'cute', 'animals', 'Potters', 'consorted', 'are', 'made', 'animation', 'move', 'dance', 'wiggle', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'talks', 'Sometimes', 'drawing', 'skills', 'bring', 'papers', 'life', 'papers', 'crinkle', 'up', 'twitch', 'real', 'duck', 'would', 'Then', 'Naughty', 'Jemima', 'Puddle', 'Duck', 'murmurs', 'throatily', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'CHICAGO', 'COLD', 'MOUNTAIN', 'playing', 'Potter', 'first', 'time', 'right', 'world', 'jolly', 'old', 'England', '1900s', 'events', 'latest', 'Potter', 'take', 'place', 'decades', 'Harry', 'Hogwarts', 'Abbey', 'get', 'same', 'kind', 'family', 'going', 'Victorian', 'London', 'little', 'Beatrix', 'ignored', 'patronized', 'mean', 'mother', 'absent', 'father', 'pesky', 'little', 'brother', 'Bertram', 'just', 'Harry', 'abused', 'picked', 'Dursley', 'family', 'fat', 'old', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'nasty', 'Petunia', 'little', 'monster', 'boy', 'Dudley', 'Dursley', 'learn', 'girl', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'attend', 'Hogwarts', 'Academy', 'school', 'most', 'girls', 'were', 'educated', 'home', 'governesses', 'private', 'tutors', '.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'documentary', 'real', 'life', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'who', 'due', 'snobby', 'family', 'imposing', 'connections', 'became', 'acquainted', 'great', 'Pre-Raphaelite', 'painter', 'Millsis', '1829-1896', 'who', 'praised', 'intricate', 'nature', 'drawings', 'little', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'encouraged', 'task', 'bringing', 'animals', 'life', 'Fans', 'Potter', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'love', 'interest', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'who', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'talk', 'animals', 'Christmas', 'special', 'present', 'painting', 'rabbit', 'Christmas', 'party', 'as', 'long', 'lovely', 'romance', 'ensues', 'not', 'just', 'Norman', 'also', 'Willie', 'Heelis', 'gardener', 'boy', 'something', 'later', 'life', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'finally', 'together', 'buy', 'land', 'surrounding', 'Hill', 'Top', 'Farm', 'turn', 'eternal', 'preserve', 'beauty', 'Lake', 'District', 'England.The', 'Potters', 'guard', 'ancestral', 'treasure', 'secret', 'melody', 'when', 'Norman', 'music', 'box', 'encoded', 'heartrending', 'theme', 'song', 'When', 'Taught', 'Me', 'How', 'Dance', 'theme', 'also', 'sung', 'credits', 'Katie', 'Melua', 'Georgian/Irish', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'made', 'track', 'hit', 'Lake', 'District', 'gift', 'shops', 'tea', 'rooms', 'San', 'Francisco', 'here', 'when', 'want', 'shot', 'Potter-mania', 'hear', 'delicate', 'air', 'breath', 'spring', 'yet', 'fey', 'note', 'shadowy', 'foreboding', 'somewhere', 'corner', 'shadow', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'am', 'reaching', 'hideous', 'form', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'words', 'Richard', 'Maltby', 'Jr.', 'screenwriter', 'latest', 'Potter', 'film', 'music', 'Mike', 'Batt', 'who', 'wrote', 'haunting', 'song', 'Bright', 'Eyes', 'theme', 'other', 'famous', 'rabbit', 'movie', 'WATERSHIP', 'DOWN']",N/A

She and her publisher (Ewan McGregor) begin to fall in love, but since he is well below Beatrix's social station, her parents are outraged.  The plucky young writer agrees to wait a bit but is determined the wedding will take place.The movie has three things I liked very much: Miss Potter's iconic watercolors are lovingly shown and even gently animated, the turn of the century period is reproduced in fine detail, and the Lake District where she lived in later life is beautifully photographed.  Unfortunately, I thought Zellweger was badly miscast as Beatrix with her too-too precious 'Bridget Jones' accent and mannerisms and her constant, manic, smirking grin; I just found her annoying.  McGregor was bland and lacked any romantic appeal and the second love of her life is only alluded to, leaving a story that felt half-told.The Potter biography in the DVD Extras was much better than the actual movie, in my opinion.

He told their parents ""Why shouldn't Beatrix get married? I've been married for years!"" He had to sneak off and get married secretly himself because he knew how unreasonable they were.

1053687,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000N4SHOE,Marc Cabir Davis,"[17, 101]","First Question - Was Beatrix Potter really a vacuous, loopy, self-loathing retard who saw fairies and bunnies all day long?Second Question - Which brilliant mind decided that equally ridiculous actress Renee Zellweger should step into the actors' seat for this trainwreck of a film?Third Question - How did a film so obviously idiotic and ill thought-out possibly garner enough funding to complete production?If you knew the answers to that, I'd be your friend.The truth is - this is terrible. I'm not a fan or hater of Renee Zellweger, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that she is woefully miscast in a horribly written role. Now heres the thing, we have the story of childrens' author Beatrix Potter - and the film paints her in this saintly glow (with ethereal light pouring in on her face every now and then - seriously!), and completely misses the point that she was probably a normal woman who just liked to draw and write. I can understand the need to create melodrama for the sake of it, but this really took things too far.The problems are two-fold - the writers realized that the story of Potter as a person wasn't terribly interesting and milked the `its-so-hard-to-be-a-woman-in-this-era' card for all it was worth. This becomes tedious after a point. Add to that the magical visions she has, and the books metaphorically drawing themselves. They wasted at least twenty good minutes on this convoluted garbage, and if I was a fifteen year old ballerina, I'd probably be weeping during these scenes, but I'm not.What I do realize though, is how limited an actress Renee actually is. If you hated her in `Jerry Maguire' and every other film she has been in, here is a chance to see her debase herself to extents even she probably did not think possible! In fact, if you watch closely, all she seems to be doing is either grinning or wallowing in self pity. The scenes where she is `lost in her own world' should be seen to be believed.The primary concern I have with this, is that Renee comes across as severely drugged and cerebrally disabled during the course of this film. There is no other term for it. As for the Ewan McGregor angle, this is one actor who has been consistently wasted since the last episode of the `Star Wars' franchise, and watching him opposite Zellweger here is painful indeed, as there is obviously no chemistry on any level.Heres the bottom line - there is obviously an audience for this trash. Granted, I'm not it, but if you're a male or female with reasonable intelligence above the age of 25, I implore you - avoid this like the plague. This falls into the `movies so bad, they're not even bad enough to be called camp' category, and it has terrible screenwriting, and even worse performances from all concerned. When it got over, I was like, that's it? THIS was what Potter was all about? Granted, drawing bunnies all day didn't seem like the most trying thing around, but still, if her life was really this boring, I can only imagine how life must have been like during that era.Overly distraught, and evenly grotesque, ""Miss Potter"" is an abomination you should avoid.Watch this only to discover the uselessness that is Renee Zellweger, if you must.One Star - and thats for the books the original author wrote.",1,Hideous 101 - Renee Zellweger's Worst Ever Performance,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3274,"['First', 'Question', 'Was', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'really', 'vacuous', 'loopy', 'self-loathing', 'retard', 'who', 'saw', 'fairies', 'bunnies', 'day', 'long', 'Second', 'Question', 'Which', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'decided', 'equally', 'ridiculous', 'actress', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'should', 'step', 'actors', 'seat', 'trainwreck', 'film', 'Third', 'Question', 'How', 'did', 'film', 'so', 'obviously', 'idiotic', 'ill', 'thought-out', 'possibly', 'garner', 'enough', 'funding', 'complete', 'production', 'knew', 'answers', ""'d"", 'be', 'friend.The', 'truth', 'terrible', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'hater', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', ""n't"", 'take', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'figure', 'out', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'horribly', 'written', 'role', 'Now', 'thing', 'have', 'story', 'childrens', 'author', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'film', 'saintly', 'glow', 'ethereal', 'light', 'pouring', 'face', 'now', 'then', 'seriously', 'completely', 'point', 'was', 'probably', 'normal', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'liked', 'draw', 'write', 'can', 'understand', 'need', 'create', 'melodrama', 'sake', 'really', 'took', 'things', 'too', 'far.The', 'problems', 'are', 'two-fold', 'writers', 'realized', 'story', 'Potter', 'person', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'interesting', 'milked', 'its-so-hard-to-be-a-woman-in-this-era', 'card', 'was', 'worth', 'tedious', 'point', 'Add', 'magical', 'visions', 'books', 'metaphorically', 'drawing', 'wasted', 'least', 'twenty', 'good', 'minutes', 'convoluted', 'garbage', 'was', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'ballerina', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'weeping', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'do', 'realize', 'how', 'limited', 'actress', 'Renee', 'actually', 'hated', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'other', 'film', 'been', 'here', 'chance', 'see', 'debase', 'extents', 'even', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'possible', 'fact', 'watch', 'closely', 'be', 'doing', 'grinning', 'wallowing', 'self', 'pity', 'scenes', 'where', 'lost', 'own', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.The', 'primary', 'concern', 'have', 'Renee', 'severely', 'drugged', 'cerebrally', 'disabled', 'course', 'film', 'other', 'term', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'angle', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'consistently', 'wasted', 'last', 'episode', 'Star', 'Wars', 'franchise', 'watching', 'opposite', 'Zellweger', 'here', 'painful', 'indeed', 'obviously', 'chemistry', 'bottom', 'line', 'obviously', 'audience', 'trash', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'not', ""'re"", 'male', 'female', 'reasonable', 'intelligence', 'age', '25', 'implore', 'avoid', 'plague', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'camp', 'category', 'terrible', 'screenwriting', 'even', 'worse', 'performances', 'concerned', 'When', 'got', 'was', 'THIS', 'was', 'what', 'Potter', 'was', 'Granted', 'drawing', 'bunnies', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'most', 'trying', 'thing', 'around', 'still', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'boring', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'era.Overly', 'distraught', 'evenly', 'grotesque', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'abomination', 'should', 'avoid.Watch', 'only', 'discover', 'uselessness', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'must.One', 'Star', 'thats', 'books', 'original', 'author', 'wrote']",N/A

But she is surprised with the Warner Brothers decided to give her children's story and water color illustrations a chance.  What she doesn't know is that they don't hold out much hope for it.  They just think it is a good project to keep youngest brother Norman (Ewan McGregor) busy.Miss Potter has her own vision for the book and is surprised to find that Mr. Warner shares her vision.  The two work closely together on developing the perfect book.Beatrix had planned to just write one, but at the encouragement of Norman, she begins working on more.  And as the books begin to sell, the two become closer.None of this sits well with Beatrix's parents (Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn).  Mrs. Potter especially thinks that their daughter should have married into a suitable match ages ago.  And suitable can only mean someone with old money.  But her parent's objections to her new found fame and relationship are about to be the least of her worries.  Can she survive what is to come?The movie focuses on the beginnings of Beatrix's writing career and her relationship with Norman.  Near the beginning we are treated to a few flashbacks to her childhood, but just enough to show how she came to be the woman she was.  And, while some details have been changed for dramatic purposes, the main details are true.All the performances are good and draw you into the story.  Parts of the film take place in the English Lake District, and the locations used show just how beautiful that area is.The ads for the movie showed Beatrix's drawings coming to life.  Over the course of the movie, this happens a few times.  These scenes never overwhelm the film but add to the current mood.My only complaint is the movie feels like it moves too quickly.

1053702,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B000N4SHOE,Michael Walter,"[4, 5]","The friendship of three remarkable people is central to this beautiful, fast-paced film about Beatrix Potter. Potter published The Tale of Peter Rabbit--the first of many children's books that she wrote and illustrated--in 1902. She was 36. The film pulls this period of the Brit's life (she's played by Renee Zellweger) into appealing close-up. Mostly, it does so by showing her dynamic, fateful friendship with publisher Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor) and Warne's sister Millie (Emily Watson). The three are intelligent, educated, adventurous, and eccentric. Better yet, they're each other's equals.The film's greatest moment occurs when Potter and the two Warnes, along with the Warnes' quick-witted mother, sit outside at a table during the afternoon and have a conversation. They are candid but careful, free-spirited but self-aware. In this delicately-played scene, we see the grown-up tte-&agrave;-tte of a million childhood freaks, weirdos, and oddballs (maybe you know them, maybe you've been them). Their exquisite dress and daring but careful dialogue, combined with the green of the environment, make the scene almost ethereal.At the film's heart is the capacity for fancy and wildness. This is obvious in the sleek animated sequences that pop in and out of the narrative. These sequences show Potter's independent-minded characters in action. They fluidly interact with her (Potter seemed to believe that they had a kind of real existence). They are like doppelgangers of Potter and the two Warnes, and must, like the film's three main characters,  face the consequences of their actions, balancing responsibility and desire.Miss Potter is a delight throughout. Those who know nothing about Potter's life beforehand will be especially intrigued by unusual plot developments--there aren't a lot of clich&eacute;s here. Performances are vivacious, especially Watson's, whose eyes sparkle as she zestfully expresses avant-garde philosophies. Zellweger confirms that she is at her best in British-themed material (not that anyone who's seen the Bridget Jones films would doubt it), and Ewan McGregor is a pleasure to watch as the timid-but-determined Norman Warne. Other highlights: the costumes by John Bright and Anthony Powell, and Andrew Dunn's photography (several Lake District are especially memorable).One of my few complaints is that Potter's relationship with her mother is, for being such a pointed aspect of the story, almost completely unexplained. More insight into this tricky relationship would have been helpful. What is certain, however, is that her friendship with Norman and Millie helped her to face her mother with greater strength, and to become more self-sufficient.Minus its mother/daughter narrative flaws, Miss Potter is a strong, charming film. It leaves us wanting more--in a very happy way.",4,Friendship and Creativity Triumphant,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2827,"['friendship', 'three', 'remarkable', 'people', 'central', 'beautiful', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Potter', 'published', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'first', 'many', 'children', 'books', 'wrote', 'illustrated', '1902', 'was', '36', 'film', 'period', 'Brit', 'life', 'played', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'appealing', 'close-up', 'Mostly', 'so', 'showing', 'dynamic', 'fateful', 'friendship', 'publisher', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Warne', 'sister', 'Millie', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'three', 'are', 'intelligent', 'educated', 'adventurous', 'eccentric', 'Better', 'yet', ""'re"", 'other', 'equals.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'moment', 'when', 'Potter', 'two', 'Warnes', 'Warnes', 'quick-witted', 'mother', 'sit', 'outside', 'table', 'afternoon', 'have', 'conversation', 'are', 'candid', 'careful', 'free-spirited', 'self-aware', 'delicately-played', 'scene', 'see', 'grown-up', 'tte-', 'agrave', '-tte', 'million', 'childhood', 'freaks', 'weirdos', 'oddballs', 'maybe', 'know', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exquisite', 'dress', 'daring', 'careful', 'dialogue', 'combined', 'green', 'environment', 'make', 'scene', 'almost', 'film', 'heart', 'capacity', 'fancy', 'wildness', 'obvious', 'sleek', 'animated', 'sequences', 'pop', 'narrative', 'sequences', 'show', 'Potter', 'independent-minded', 'characters', 'action', 'fluidly', 'interact', 'Potter', 'seemed', 'believe', 'had', 'kind', 'real', 'existence', 'are', 'doppelgangers', 'Potter', 'two', 'Warnes', 'must', 'film', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'face', 'consequences', 'actions', 'balancing', 'responsibility', 'desire.Miss', 'Potter', 'delight', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Potter', 'life', 'beforehand', 'will', 'be', 'especially', 'intrigued', 'unusual', 'plot', 'developments', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'Performances', 'are', 'vivacious', 'especially', 'Watson', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'zestfully', 'avant-garde', 'philosophies', 'Zellweger', 'confirms', 'best', 'British-themed', 'material', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'films', 'would', 'doubt', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'timid-but-determined', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'Other', 'highlights', 'costumes', 'John', 'Bright', 'Anthony', 'Powell', 'Andrew', 'Dunn', 'photography', 'several', 'Lake', 'District', 'are', 'especially', 'memorable', '.One', 'few', 'complaints', 'Potter', 'relationship', 'mother', 'being', 'such', 'pointed', 'aspect', 'story', 'almost', 'completely', 'unexplained', 'More', 'insight', 'tricky', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'What', 'certain', 'however', 'friendship', 'Norman', 'Millie', 'helped', 'face', 'mother', 'greater', 'strength', 'become', 'more', 'self-sufficient.Minus', 'mother/daughter', 'narrative', 'flaws', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'strong', 'charming', 'film', 'wanting', 'more', 'very', 'happy', 'way']",N/A

Having refused the parade of suitors her parents chose for her, Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger) finds herself still an unmarried woman in her 30s. Seemingly resigned to spinsterhood, Beatrix dedicates her energies to her artwork. In 1902, she makes the rounds of London publishers with a small illustrated children's volume called ""Peter Rabbit"". It is to her most pleasant surprise that F. Warne & Company finally consents to publish her book. Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor) has been pestering his older brothers for a place in the family business, and this little volume with low expectations is deemed just the project for him. But Norman finds Peter Rabbit and his author utterly charming and is determined to make them a success.""Miss Potter"" presents Beatrix Potter's dilemma as that of a modern-minded woman forced to cope with Victorian expectations. She won't marry someone she doesn't like in order to advance her mother's social ambitions. She doesn't see why she can't make something of herself without a husband. I'm wary of instilling a person from the 19th century with late-20th century values and motives, but there is no denying that Beatrix Potter was very independent. At this point in her life, her personal and professional ambitions clashed with her society, in the form of her class-conscious, critical mother (Barbara Flynn). Some viewers may be disappointed that this film does not address Beatrix Potter's artistic background or her accomplishments as a natural history painter. But it does show us the satisfaction and pain she experienced as she transformed from eccentric spinster into the wealthy, famous, and accomplished author and conservationist that history remembers.The DVD (Weinstein 2007): There are 2 featurettes, a theatrical trailer, a music video for ""When You Taught Me How to Dance"" performed by Katie Melua, and an audio commentary. ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter"" (20 min) is a British documentary about the legacy of Peter Rabbit and the life of its author. It discusses Potter's artistic background and conservation efforts in more depth than the film. ""The Making of a Real-Life Fairy Tale"" (22 min) interviews director Chris Noonan, the cast, and creative crew about the performances, Beatrix Potter's work, and creating the onscreen world. In the audio commentary, director Chris Noonan talks about the film's production history, its themes and its central conflict between Beatrix' and her mother's wishes, the animation of Potter's characters, and scene-by-scene comments on some technical details.

Zellweger's role as the beleaguered Beatrix who must deal with an overbearing and critical mother and a weak father was beautifully acted and quite engaging.  McGregor was appealing as the suitor in love, and the authenticity of the sets and costumes enabled the viewer to feel a part of the era.  The movie hinted that Beatrix might have a touch of insanity, with animated paintings and her occasional appearance of confusion, but this is never brought out definitively.  I knew nothing of Beatrix Potter's life before watching the movie, but I came away with respect for her tenacity and courage, as well as compassion for the pain she suffered.

1053709,AF17B68RFKUW4,B000N4SHOE,Mrs. Robinson,"[5, 7]","It's not a bad movie -- pretty good, actually, if you like gentle, chastely romantic period pieces (and I don't mean that in a snarky way). There are several truly fine actors in it: the always-surprising Emily Watson, who here brings life to what would have been a boring, shallow character; Ewan McGregor, utterly charming and looking strikingly like the real Norman Warne; Bill Paterson, bringing warmth and subtle suggestions of complexity to the screen as Beatrix Potter's father; even David Bamber works his magic in a tiny role that arguably wastes his talents. There are, of course, all those lush Edwardian details that are so easy to love -- the clothes, the furniture, the achingly elaborate dining services. You can't go wrong with those delicious glimpses of English countryside, which are far too few if you ask me. And then there are Beatrix Potter's delicately beautiful, whimsical watercolor illustrations, which provide some delightful (and heartwrenching) scenes.I've been a fan of Beatrix Potter's stories and artwork since I was a little girl; that's why I got this movie. Alas, I should have stuck with the excellent BBC animated series ""Peter Rabbit and Friends"", as that brought to life her work and spirit better than this respectable but tepid period piece.I am annoyed, annoyed, annoyed by the vague, wifty feminism that peters in and out of this movie. It's all been done and done again, it all felt so tired. It drifts in wearily at the very beginning, where Renee Zellweger's voiceover (God, I hate voiceovers) wryly remarks on how there are definite ways that respectable 32-year-old spinsters are supposed to behave and they don't include doing ... whatever the heroine of whatever period piece happens to be doing at the given filmed moment. This sentiment is punctuated by the notably sour and sniffy Mr. Warne, too obviously disliking Peter Rabbit, asking Beatrix if she is a Miss or a Missus and hastily auto-correcting himself to ""Miss"" with the muttered aside, ""Silly of me"", for of course no married lady would behave as she does. Although she pretty much just told us not five minutes ago that unmarried ladies don't behave that way, either.This suffocating little scene (made bearable by the quivering nostrils and inimitable expressions of delicate disdain on the face of David Bamber) ends with Miss Potter's trumpeting but restrained command to her footman (?) to drive her through not one London park, but all the parks (a stunning proposition indeed!), and faster, faster! We see the coach ""speeding"" through Kensington Gardens as a startled gentleman manages to dodge breathlessly out of the way; we see Miss Potter leaning her momentarily free and sensuous head freely and sensuously out of the carriage window. It's a scene that's been seen so many times before: repressed, respectable young lady lets her hair down, sometimes literally, to give us modern viewers a glimpse of the true freedom and sensuousness of her abnormally modern soul, abnormally stuffed into the social equivalent of a tightly laced corset. Okay, yeah, I get it, proper little Miss Potter with her pursed little smile and perpetual black suit is a free spirit, perhaps even a hedonist, despite outward appearances.The tired, limp nod to feminism just carries on. Beatrix is shown as a child (a beautiful if weirdly precocious girl), primming up her mouth furiously at the suggestion that she will one day run a household, passionately declaring to her clueless mother that she will never marry and will be loved ""by my art"". Said clueless mother stolidly proclaims that Beatrix shall marry because ""all girls marry"". Really. This woman, who spends the movie putting her daughter down in the stupidest, most obvious and hamfisted ways, is a caricature. I can admire her skills as a chatelaine and a hostess to glittering society (and those really were admirable skills), but I cannot believe in her. She is a cardboard cutout, so blinded by her social climbing and limited ideas of womanhood that she cannot in any sense recognize her daughter's talent and, eventually, fame. Oh, I believe there were/are mothers like her, but this portrayal is a cartoon.It just gets worse when Norman Warne's sister Millie, who would be utterly ridiculous if not played by an actress as superb as Emily Watson, makes her declarations about marriage, declared ""shocking"" by Miss Potter, althought they would sound insipid and just plain silly if coming from any mouth but her regal and precise one. Of course, she shows the cream puff heart of this movie by melting into coos about ""being loved"" when Beatrix guiltily whispers of her marriage proposal from Mr. Warne.These weakly flailing little slaps of feminism are brought to a climax when a newly independent and frisky Miss Potter gleefully cuts off an overbearing developer who scolds her for her outrageous bidding practices at the end of the film. Sir, she is no longer in the habit of being lectured to. And fortunately she no longer is required to submit to such. [Lots of money now, remember -- for all this freedom and independence and assertiveness would of course be impossible if she were poor. Right, capitalist viewers?] Oh, one wants to vomit.As for Miss Zellweger, I found her performance simply odd. I don't dislike her. She was charming in ""Bridget Jones' Diary"". I do think she was miscast here and that her performance displayed a split personality: Most of the time she was a very soft-spoken, slightly self-effacing woman, but occasionally this odd, trumpeting, hooting harridan popped through, pinch-lipped and commanding. You see it when she waltzes out of the Warnes' office at the beginning, having regained her portfolio. You see it a minute later when she tells her footman (in a voice and accent notably different from the one she uses in the rest of the movie) that she wants to drive through ALL the parks. You glimpse her when she is first shocked by Norman Warne's suggestion that she accompany him to the printer's, then swiftly acquiesces. I understand that we all speak differently in different situations, but this is not believable.Miss Zellweger is an extremely pretty woman, but the camera is not kind to her in this movie. I understand that Beatrix Potter was plain, but that is not the same as unattractive. The lovely Miss Z. becomes unattractive in this movie purely from bad lighting and bad camera angles.Despite all this scathing criticism, I still give the movie three stars? Why? It works perfectly well as a period romance, for one. And the romance in this one is particularly sweet -- perhaps I should say bittersweet. The love scenes are very touching, the men are very handsome, the glimpses of Hilltop Farm breathtaking. I have also mentioned briefly the use made of Beatrix Potter's illustrations, and that was very well and imaginitively done.Oh, don't listen to me. I'm just a grouchy woman who wishes that the movie had focused less on Potter's bittersweet romances and insufferably snobbish mother and more on her actual work, to which this movie does not begin to do justice. But if you are watching it because you enjoy unobjectionable romance in beatifully filmed period pieces with just a piquant hint of feminism to add spice to the counterfeminism of the love story, then you will enjoy this. No, really. You will.",3,Weak Tea Feminism,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,7338,"['not', 'bad', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'actually', 'like', 'gentle', 'chastely', 'romantic', 'period', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"",

Better late than never I suppose.  Yes indeed, MISS POTTER is the woman who created those children's gems, and became known throughout the world, recognized by everyone except her mother, who was a fuddy-duddy and thought Beatrix Potter was worse than potty to be pottering about with silly drawings.  But MISS POTTER, nicely brought to life by Renee Zellweger and supported by Ewan McGregor, and those wonderful English character actors we've come to love so much.  But MISS POTTER is more than the sum of her parts.  What she accomplished with her life is remarkable even by today's standards.  However, I'm not going to tell you about those things, you must watch MISS POTTER yourself - it'll do you good.  By the way, I stopped at four stars instead of five because there's just a touch of sentimentality  here and there in the picture.

1053727,ABC8FXLD7W528,B000N4SHOE,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[0, 0]","Miss Potter is a delightful movie and I enjoyed it for so many reasons. First, as an author myself, I could completely understand how the characters came to life in Miss Potter's mind and how she loved to tell the stories of each character. Secondly, this movie contained all of the elements of a great story: romance, drama, and a bit of humor.Miss Potter is based on the life story of author and artist Beatrix Potter, known for her best-selling ""Tale of Peter Rabbit"" books. Having a gift for art since she was a child, Beatrix continued to hone her talent and seek publication as an adult. However, as one from a wealthy and upstanding family in the early 1900s, Beatrix was expected to take a different route with her life - to marry, have children, and host social events in her fancy home. She, however, had a different dream - to see her stories published in book form.When Beatrix receives an acceptance from a large publisher, she is ecstatic. However, her mother is less than thrilled, and we see the conflict throughout the entire film. Her publisher assigns the publication of her books to the youngest brother of the owners of the company, a man named Norman, who is almost as excited as Beatrix is about her books. Will their partnership blossom into something more?This movie is appropriate for all ages, although those under 8 or so will not likely understand the story line and might become disinterested.  There is nothing objectionable in this movie, although there is an incident where Norman is less than honest when he slips a bit of brandy into the elderly governess' tea.  Spoiler alert - be sure to have a tissue box because there is an unexpected tragedy woven in the movie.I highly recommend this movie, which contains a delightful story line,  a bit of wholesome romance,  and encouragement to follow your dreams. I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movie reviews on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of ""McKenzie.""",5,A Delightful Movie...,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,1976,"['Miss', 'Potter', 'delightful', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'First', 'author', 'could', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'characters', 'came', 'life', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'mind', 'how', 'loved', 'tell', 'stories', 'character', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'contained', 'elements', 'great', 'story', 'romance', 'drama', 'bit', 'humor.Miss', 'Potter', 'based', 'life', 'story', 'author', 'artist', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'known', 'best-selling', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'books', 'Having', 'gift', 'art', 'was', 'child', 'Beatrix', 'continued', 'hone', 'talent', 'seek', 'publication', 'adult', 'However', 'one', 'wealthy', 'upstanding', 'family', 'early', '1900s', 'Beatrix', 'was', 'expected', 'take', 'different', 'route', 'life', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'host', 'social', 'events', 'fancy', 'home', 'however', 'had', 'different', 'dream', 'see', 'stories', 'published', 'book', 'form.When', 'Beatrix', 'acceptance', 'large', 'publisher', 'ecstatic', 'However', 'mother', 'less', 'thrilled', 'see', 'conflict', 'entire', 'film', 'publisher', 'publication', 'books', 'youngest', 'brother', 'owners', 'company', 'man', 'named', 'Norman', 'who', 'almost', 'as', 'excited', 'Beatrix', 'books', 'Will', 'partnership', 'blossom', 'something', 'more', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'ages', '8', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'likely', 'understand', 'story', 'line', 'might', 'become', 'disinterested', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'movie', 'incident', 'where', 'Norman', 'less', 'honest', 'when', 'bit', 'brandy', 'elderly', 'governess', 'tea', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'tissue', 'box', 'unexpected', 'tragedy', 'woven', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'delightful', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'wholesome', 'romance', 'encouragement', 'follow', 'dreams', 'have', 'added', 'movie', 'list', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'reviews', 'wordpress', 'blog.Reviewed', 'Penny', 'Zeller', 'Author', 'McKenzie']",N/A

I had not heard of this movie before accidentally coming across it a few weeks ago while browsing available on-line Amazon Instant Videos. In this era of high tech special effects it seems difficult to find a well acted, beautifully filmed and directed movie that was made for the adult viewer in mind. This imaginary bio story is about the turn-of-the-century writer and illustrator of children's books, Beatrix Potter. The story follows the author's creative life pretty accurately according to recognized written biographies. The director's choice of beginning at the time when Miss Potter is first approaching the future publisher of her books, including flashbacks of her youth filled with imagination and resolve, while leading us through her difficult dealings with a domineering mother and social class who, at first, considers the creations of this visionary young artist just a passing diversion is a masterstroke of story telling.

It elicited absolute pleasure for the on screen rendition of a life well lived. While I doubt not at all that Potter's life might not have been quite so charming as this movie depicted, indeed that's what fiction is largely about - escape.

As a child I more admired them than liked them thinking their tales a bit stuffy and cautionary.  After viewing this film I've gained a greater understanding of the time in which these books were written plus a respect for their author.  Renee Zellweger portrays an awkward, plucky Beatrix whom we can't help but care about and root for.  The conventions and restrictions of the age are well employed within the story, from the fact that over-thirty Beatrix required an escort everywhere she went, to the absolute unquestioning obedience and respect she paid, however grudgingly, to her parents many overbearing requests despite her advanced age.  Yet here is a woman who did manage, as she put it, to make her own way, to find satisfaction and security in her talents, to eventually live life as she wished, to suffer love and loss only to marry later in life and happily from all accounts, and develop into a smart businesswoman.  Beatrix Potter became a landowner and conservationist and a working farmer at a time when her ""class"" of women were more to be mollycoddled than anything else.  (It's not mentioned in the film, but Beatrix was also a respected mycologist and her paintings of mushrooms and fungi are regarded as some of the finest.)  The greatest treats in the film are the many Potter drawings come to life and the gorgeous Lake District scenery.  Plus the extreme historical accuracy.  Zellweger did not wear makeup and looked very much as Potter would naturally -- messy hair, wrinkled a tad, a touch sunburned from tramping the woods which Miss Potter did with gusto whever she could.",4,Plucky Miss Potter !,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,1681,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'greatest', 'fan', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'charming', 'little', 'books', 'child', 'more', 'admired', 'liked', 'thinking', 'tales', 'bit', 'stuffy', 'cautionary', 'viewing', 'film', ""'ve"", 'gained', 'greater', 'understanding', 'time', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'respect', 'author', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'awkward', 'plucky', 'Beatrix', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'care', 'root', 'conventions', 'restrictions', 'age', 'are', 'well', 'employed', 'story', 'fact', 'over-thirty', 'Beatrix', 'required', 'escort', 'everywhere', 'went', 'absolute', 'unquestioning', 'obedience', 'respect', 'paid', 'however', 'grudgingly', 'parents', 'many', 'overbearing', 'requests', 'advanced', 'age', 'here', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'manage', 'put', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'security', 'talents', 'eventually', 'live', 'life', 'wished', 'suffer', 'love', 'loss', 'only', 'marry', 'later', 'life', 'happily', 'accounts', 'develop', 'smart', 'businesswoman', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'became', 'landowner', 'conservationist', 'working', 'farmer', 'time', 'when', 'class', 'women', 'were', 'more', 'be', 'mollycoddled', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'mentioned', 'film', 'Beatrix', 'was', 'also', 'respected', 'mycologist', 'paintings', 'mushrooms', 'fungi', 'are', 'regarded', 'finest', 'greatest', 'treats', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'Potter', 'drawings', 'come', 'life', 'gorgeous', 'Lake', 'District', 'scenery', 'extreme', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Zellweger', 'did', 'not', 'wear', 'makeup', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'Potter', 'would', 'naturally', 'messy', 'hair', 'wrinkled', 'tad', 'touch', 'sunburned', 'tramping', 'woods', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'did', 'gusto', 'whever', 'could']",N/A

They said yes because their little brother, Ewan McGregor, has just joined the firm and they needed an unimportant first project for him to bumble with.What begins as another story of a writer and artist whose once disdained work becomes wildly popular turns into a very human story of love, friendship, loss, and recovery.

1053751,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000N4SHOE,Robert Moore,"[136, 141]","I saw this lovely film this past week in Chicago at a preview showing and was simply delighted by it.  Only five years ago this would have been a Miramax film, but following the messy departure of the Weinsteins from Miramax to form their own production company, they are distributing this joint production.  Set in the early decades of the twentieth century, in a sort of extended Edwardian age, the film possesses a wonderful period feel and look.  Like the best of the Miramax films, it feels like a time capsule more than a contemporary production.With only some shame I have to admit to knowing very little about Beatrix Potter.  To inject some autobiography, I was not read Potter as a child and though after my divorce I raised my daughter, reading to her constantly, there was an agreement that on her periodic visits to her mother she would be allowed to read her Beatrix Potter (because of a Potter obsession by her own godmother) and Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I read my daughter every other children's' writer, but was forbidden to dip into either of those.  So I saw this biopic knowing next to nothing about her.  The film seemed to me to give a good impression of who she was.  She emerges in the film as a sort of timid feminist, not a activist, but quietly insisting on taking her own path.  Though there are flashbacks to her childhood and the final quarter of the film focuses on her moving to the Lake District, most of the film deals with the period of partnership and eventually romance between her and her publisher, Norman Warne.  One suspects that of necessity a great deal is left out, but as it exists it is compelling.  I did a bit of checking on the Internet and discovered that she was not 32 in 1903, so the film obviously fudges some numbers, but as presented the film still provided a delightful portrait.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is wonderful in the title role.  I have seen photographs of Beatrix Potter and there does not seem to be much of a resemblance between the two.  To the film's credit, they do a great deal to de-emphasize Zellweger's loveliness.  She isn't exactly plain, but she isn't as beautiful as usual.  But she brings a delightful simplicity to her role.  Ewan McGregor is fine in his role, but unlike their unfortunate film DOWN WITH LOVE, his role is not equal to hers in this one.  He manages to be everything he needs to be.  Emily Watson plays his sister.  There are movie stars and there are actresses, and she is an actress.  I have always been amazed at much her various roles can differ from one another.  A lot of actresses, unfortunately, as they near the age of forty, have probably reached close to the end of their career.  Watson is so splendid, however, and those huge eyes so expressive, that you sense that she probably hasn't reached half of her eventual film resume.  I'm certain we'll be seeing her in roles thirty-five years from now.  It was good to see Bill Paterson as Beatrix's father.  He has always been one of my favorite supporting actors and for my money we have always seen far too little of him.  Veteran British actress Barbara Flynn is excellent as well as Beatrix's mother.Chris Noonan directed the film.  The last time we encountered him as a director was in one of the most delightful films of the nineties, BABE.  I have absolutely no idea what he has been up to the past decade, but this film has some of the same lush look that BABE did.  Interestingly, animals feature prominently in both films.The last part of the film, that centers on the beginning of the final chapter of Potter's life as a farmer in the Lake District, features some of the most stunning landscapes you can ever hope to see in a movie.  The end of the film indicates that Miss Potter left 4,000 acres of Lake District property to the National Trust.  I hope that some of those scenes were filmed on some of that property.Finally, I want to add that while I've never been one to be on the lookout for ""family"" (which to me usually are synonymous with ""boring"" or ""bland""), this film, which could easily receive a ""G"" rating, is a film that any parent could feel comfortable showing any child.  Younger children might find it a bit slow, but any fan of Beatrix Potter, whether young or old, will surely enjoy this film.  Indeed, as someone who cannot count himself among her fans (entirely through a complete lack of acquaintance), I can attest that those unfamiliar with her work will love the film as well.",5,A marvelous period film in the best Weinstein tradition,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,4465,"['saw', 'lovely', 'film', 'past', 'week', 'Chicago', 'preview', 'showing', 'was', 'simply', 'delighted', 'Only', 'five', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Miramax', 'film', 'following', 'messy', 'departure', 'Weinsteins', 'Miramax', 'form', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'are', 'distributing', 'joint', 'production', 'Set', 'early', 'decades', 'twentieth', 'century', 'sort', 'extended', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'film', 'wonderful', 'period', 'feel', 'look', 'best', 'Miramax', 'films', 'time', 'capsule', 'more', 'contemporary', 'production.With', 'only', 'shame', 'have', 'admit', 'knowing', 'very', 'little', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'inject', 'autobiography', 'was', 'not', 'read', 'Potter', 'child', 'divorce', 'raised', 'daughter', 'reading', 'constantly', 'was', 'agreement', 'periodic', 'visits', 'mother', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'read', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Potter', 'obsession', 'own', 'godmother', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'read', 'daughter', 'other', 'children', 'writer', 'was', 'forbidden', 'dip', 'saw', 'biopic', 'knowing', 'next', 'nothing', 'film', 'seemed', 'give', 'good', 'impression', 'who', 'was', 'film', 'sort', 'timid', 'feminist', 'not', 'activist', 'quietly', 'insisting', 'taking', 'own', 'path', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'final', 'quarter', 'film', 'moving', 'Lake', 'District', 'most', 'film', 'deals', 'period', 'partnership', 'eventually', 'romance', 'publisher', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'One', 'necessity', 'great', 'deal', 'left', 'out', 'compelling', 'did', 'bit', 'checking', 'Internet', 'discovered', 'was', 'not', '32', '1903', 'film', 'obviously', 'numbers', 'presented', 'film', 'still', 'provided', 'delightful', 'portrait.Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'wonderful', 'title', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'photographs', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'there', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'resemblance', 'two', 'film', 'credit', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'de-emphasize', 'Zellweger', 'loveliness', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'plain', ""n't"", 'as', 'beautiful', 'usual', 'delightful', 'simplicity', 'role', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fine', 'role', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'DOWN', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'role', 'not', 'equal', 'hers', 'one', 'be', 'everything', 'be', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'sister', 'are', 'movie', 'stars', 'are', 'actresses', 'actress', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'amazed', 'much', 'various', 'roles', 'can', 'differ', 'one', 'lot', 'actresses', 'unfortunately', 'near', 'age', 'forty', 'have', 'probably', 'reached', 'close', 'end', 'career', 'Watson', 'so', 'splendid', 'however', 'huge', 'eyes', 'so', 'expressive', 'sense', 'probably', ""n't"", 'reached', 'half', 'eventual', 'film', 'resume', ""'m"", 'certain', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'roles', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'Beatrix', 'father', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'actors', 'money', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'Veteran', 'British', 'actress', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Beatrix', 'mother.Chris', 'Noonan', 'directed', 'film', 'last', 'time', 'encountered', 'director', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'films', 'nineties', 'BABE', 'have', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'been', 'up', 'past', 'decade', 'film', 'same', 'lush', 'look', 'BABE', 'did', 'Interestingly', 'animals', 'feature', 'prominently', 'films.The', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'beginning', 'final', 'chapter', 'Potter', 'life', 'farmer', 'Lake', 'District', 'most', 'stunning', 'landscapes', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'see', 'movie', 'end', 'film', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'left', '4,000', 'acres', 'Lake', 'District', 'property', 'National', 'Trust', 'hope', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'property.Finally', 'want', 'add', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'one', 'be', 'lookout', 'family', 'usually', 'are', 'synonymous', 'boring', 'bland', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'receive', 'G', 'rating', 'film', 'parent', 'could', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'showing', 'child', 'Younger', 'children', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'slow', 'fan', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Indeed', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'count', 'fans', 'entirely', 'complete', 'lack', 'acquaintance', 'can', 'attest', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1053752,A1NGQ4IG3YY0MA,B000N4SHOE,Robert V. Gibson,"[1, 1]","So many articles are coming out about the disappearance of Renee Zellweger from movie screens. I seem to recall an article where she said she was going to take a nice long break. Good for her! She's a very talented and successful actor and can obviously afford the break. Fortunately she found time to make &#34;Miss Potter&#34; before her break (or maybe she came out of seclusion to make it). Bio pics are hard. They can either be filmed in the star's dry chronological life, or they can take elements, and with a little creative license, add some elements that could have plausibly happened. &#34;Miss Potter&#34; seems to be a chronology, but Zellweger is so genuine throughout the film, we can forgive the &#34;play-by-play&#34; treatment. I think what makes this style work is that the real Miss Potter in this never really grasped how successful and rich she was. There is a great relationship subplot between Potter and her fianc&eacute;'s sister that adds the kind of depth that probably didn't follow some memoir transcript, and being able to imagine how that friendship may possibly have developed is endearing.

However, in the story chronicling the mushy love life of Beatrix Potter, the acclaimed author of whimsical children's stories like ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"", the duo get to continue their onscreen chemistry in a new way, as bumbling and awkward early twentieth century lovers.In Hollywood it is rare and refreshing to find a director who makes films because he is captivated by the story, but for Chris Noonan, who helmed this lush and lavish period piece, `Miss Potter' marks his first feature film since the phenomenally successful 1995 movie `Babe'. While there are a few nods to swine sprinkled throughout `Miss Potter', Noonan's new film focuses on human nuances more so than talking animals.With beautiful performances comprised from the film's stars, `Miss Potter' is an intriguing examination of an important literary figure which is designed for the whole family to enjoy. On the surface an unmarried, thirty-something daughter of a British aristocrat who spends her days not only painting small farm animals, but talking to her work as if they were living and breathing individuals, might serve as a beautiful case study for schizophrenia; however Zellweger's strong performance as Beatrix Potter makes the nuanced character come to life in charming and delightful ways.Of course half the fun of her character comes from her rebellious love for the tradesmen Norman Warne (McGregor), who just happens to be her publisher too. In a film that is filled with lavish, golden cinematography, doing justice to Potter's own watercolor illustrations, it is the moment when these two lovers culminate their relationship with an iconic kiss on the fog filled London train tracks that `Miss Potter' completely enraptures you.The epic challenge for Potter, even more difficult than getting her ""Bunny Book"" published, was winning her aristocratic parents over with the idea of marriage to Norman Warne. With a Shakespearean refusal to budge, Potter's parents force the author to seek out other ways for her to marry her true love. When she decides she might have the income to move out on her own Potter humbly asks her banker if she has enough money for a small home, to which he replies that not only could she afford a house, but several estates as well.As fun and family friendly as a great deal of the first act may seem, `Miss Potter' does have its darker moments which is sure to catch audiences looking for the next `Finding Neverland' off guard. When an important figure in Potter's life passes away due to illness, suddenly her entire future is in flux, a plot point which is sure to confuse younger audiences. While death may be an important subject for children to comprehend, it may be a subject that parents of young Peter Rabbit fans might not be ready to broach just yet.For their latest pairing on the big screen Zellweger and McGregor deliver another magical, yet decidedly different romance that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. For his first film since `Babe', director Noonan doesn't seem to be rusty at all when it comes to telling a story on film, and with a little luck we will hopefully get more cinematic fair from him. In the case of his second picture in over a decade I can only sum up the film with this statement: That'll do Potter, that'll do.-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.net",3,Miss Potter Review from MoviePulse.net,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,3595,"['Reunited', 'first', 'time', 'stylishly', 'acclaimed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Down', 'Love', 'stars', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'again', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'devoid', 'slick', 'candy', 'coated', 'perfection', 'made', 'last', 'outing', 'so', 'spectacularly', 'delicious', 'However', 'story', 'chronicling', 'mushy', 'love', 'life', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'acclaimed', 'author', 'whimsical', 'children', 'stories', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'duo', 'get', 'continue', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'new', 'way', 'bumbling', 'awkward', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'lovers.In', 'Hollywood', 'rare', 'refreshing', 'find', 'director', 'who', 'films', 'captivated', 'story', 'Chris', 'Noonan', 'who', 'helmed', 'lush', 'lavish', 'period', 'piece', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'marks', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'phenomenally', 'successful', '1995', 'movie', 'Babe', 'are', 'few', 'nods', 'swine', 'sprinkled', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'Noonan', 'new', 'film', 'focuses', 'human', 'nuances', 'more', 'so', 'talking', 'animals.With', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'comprised', 'film', 'stars', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'intriguing', 'examination', 'important', 'literary', 'figure', 'designed', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'surface', 'unmarried', 'thirty-something', 'daughter', 'British', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'days', 'not', 'only', 'painting', 'small', 'farm', 'animals', 'talking', 'work', 'were', 'living', 'breathing', 'individuals', 'might', 'serve', 'beautiful', 'case', 'study', 'schizophrenia', 'however', 'Zellweger', 'strong', 'performance', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'nuanced', 'character', 'come', 'life', 'charming', 'delightful', 'ways.Of', 'course', 'fun', 'character', 'rebellious', 'love', 'tradesmen', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'McGregor', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'publisher', 'too', 'film', 'filled', 'lavish', 'golden', 'cinematography', 'doing', 'justice', 'Potter', 'own', 'watercolor', 'illustrations', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'lovers', 'culminate', 'relationship', 'iconic', 'kiss', 'fog', 'filled', 'London', 'train', 'tracks', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'completely', 'you.The', 'epic', 'challenge', 'Potter', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'getting', 'Bunny', 'Book', 'published', 'was', 'winning', 'aristocratic', 'parents', 'idea', 'marriage', 'Norman', 'Warne', 'Shakespearean', 'refusal', 'budge', 'Potter', 'parents', 'force', 'author', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'ways', 'marry', 'true', 'love', 'When', 'might', 'have', 'income', 'move', 'out', 'own', 'Potter', 'humbly', 'banker', 'enough', 'money', 'small', 'home', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'afford', 'house', 'several', 'estates', 'well.As', 'fun', 'family', 'friendly', 'great', 'deal', 'first', 'act', 'may', 'seem', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'have', 'darker', 'moments', 'sure', 'catch', 'audiences', 'looking', 'next', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'off', 'guard', 'When', 'important', 'figure', 'Potter', 'life', 'away', 'due', 'illness', 'suddenly', 'entire', 'future', 'flux', 'plot', 'point', 'sure', 'confuse', 'younger', 'audiences', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'important', 'subject', 'children', 'comprehend', 'may', 'be', 'subject', 'parents', 'young', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'broach', 'just', 'yet.For', 'latest', 'pairing', 'big', 'screen', 'Zellweger', 'McGregor', 'deliver', 'magical', 'yet', 'decidedly', 'different', 'romance', 'sure', 'delight', 'audiences', 'ages', 'first', 'film', 'Babe', 'director', 'Noonan', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'rusty', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'film', 'little', 'luck', 'will', 'hopefully', 'get', 'more', 'cinematic', 'fair', 'case', 'second', 'picture', 'decade', 'can', 'only', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'statement', ""'ll"", 'do', 'Potter', ""'ll"", 'do.-Joe', 'Russo', 'MoviePulse.net']",N/A

1053799,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000N4SHOE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 41]","In an effort to give their younger brother, Norman (Ewan McGregor) a project to keep him busy now that he has joined the family publishing house, the older Warne brothers agree to publish Miss Beatrix Potter's (Renee Zellweger) first children's book. They don't expect the book about a young rabbit who wears a blue coat and gets into mischief to sell well, but they need to keep Norman busy. Beatrix is beside herself; as a single woman in Edwardian London, still living with her parents in her early 30s, she suspects this endeavor may provide her with a small measure of freedom, personal, financial, any type of freedom. But she also has very specific ideas about how the book should be published. As they work together, Norman surprises her with his ideas for the book and they become close. After the book is published, Beatrix is surprised to learn there will be a second book; ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"" is selling well. No problem, because she has many stories. One day at lunch, she meets the rest of Norman's family, including his sister, Millie (Emily Watson) and the two women become fast friends. Norman proposes, but Beatrix's parents object to the marriage proposal. After much argument, they agree to let Beatrix marry Norman provided they wait until the end of the summer; the Potters spend every summer at their country home. As Beatrix leaves for the country side, Norman rushes to the train station to say goodbye. Beatrix kisses her soaked fianc&eacute;e; he forgot his umbrella and a rainstorm has drenched his clothing. He'll catch his... They are only too happy to wait. After all, what can happen in one summer?""Miss Potter"" is a perfectly pleasant diversion for a few hours. Not a ground breaking film, it tells the story of one of the best selling children's authors of all time and hints a bit at her inspiration and life. But it merely hints. This is a film for Anglophiles who will love the scenery, the depiction of Edwardian London, the accents, the tea.But it also represents another entry in a current trend of British Cinema. Basically, this film is the British equivalent of an American studio release; plot points here, here and here, pleasant, solid if uninspired performances, light historical biography. It simply doesn't push the envelope like the great British, independent and foreign films we are used to and because of this, is a safer bet at the box office. I have nothing against a film biography, but give us a hint why the person is unusual, film worthy. The film's one concession to this is to show Beatrix's drawings come to life; they are her friends, providing companionship well into adult hood.I'm not sure the film can even be considered a British production. Produced by and starring Renee Zellweger and co-produced by Phoenix Productions and the Weinstein Company, a lot of American money went into this film. They clearly saw a market and a way to tap into this audience. But because the remainder of the cast is British, the film is set in England, it is directed by an Aussie and partially funded by a British television channel, I guess it qualifies. It just seems calling ""Potter"" a `British' film is a calculated attempt to get the film more Oscar attention then it deserves. You know, much like Will Smith starring in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a calculated attempt to get an Oscar nomination for the popular movie star. Oh, wait....I really wish Zellweger would give up her efforts to convince everyone of what a serious actress she is and return to making the romantic comedies she used to make. You know the ones without the British accent? Okay, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" was cute, but Renee, you're no Meryl Streep. You're an AMERICAN, play some Americans. Stay away from the faux British accent for a while. Remind us why we came to love (or at least like) you in the first place.As Beatrix Potter, Zellweger is good. She convincingly portrays the writer's love of animals, her drawings, her books. When the animals come to life, her eyes light up and she clearly enjoys their companionship. But when she is interacting with humans, she seems to have two facial expressions. One of these, her face scrunched up and her mouth forming a half smile seems to be meant to convey both happiness and sadness. Frankly, she looks like she is suffering from hemorrhoids. The other facial expression is a blank look, which isn't used that often. I'm sure the point is to show how awkward she is with humans, but it doesn't work. Once she forms a relationship with Norman and Millie, his sister, she shouldn't appear awkward towards them, but she does. A third facial expression would have helped.Ewan McGregor's Norman is cute, charming and very gung ho. As the male equivalent of Beatrix, a bit awkward, a bit shy, a bit restrained, they seem a good fit. He also seems to be a more complex character despite his smaller amount of screen time. Norman clearly feels a bit intimidated in the company business and is very satisfied when he succeeds, proving he can contribute to the family business. It is also interesting to watch McGregor portray Norman wrestling with the rules of the era.Emily Watson plays Millie. A forward woman who, like Beatrix, is single and in her early 30s, she quickly announces ""I have decided we are to be great friends"" after she meets Beatrix. Her premonition proves accurate, becoming a friend, and confidant to the author, providing advice to her new best friend. I get the sense Millie was more than just a single woman in her early 30s and may have been slightly attracted to Beatrix. But this isn't explored, probably deemed too controversial for a film about a woman who believes her drawings of animals come to life. Nonetheless, she provides an ear for Beatrix and later a shoulder to cry on. And remains very single.The film is best when depicting the Edwardian society Beatrix inhabits. Even though she is a grown woman, because she is single she must be accompanied everywhere by an escort, an older woman in her mid 60s, who wears nothing but black. When she returns from a visit to the printers, her mother can barely believe it when a smudge of ink is discovered on a blouse, so beneath her daughter. Beatrix manages to invite Norman and Millie to the family's Christmas party and they blend in well with all of the society folks her mother is so desperate to impress. Throughout the evening, Beatrix and Norman play a sly game of cat and mouse trying to earn a few moments of time alone.""Miss Potter"" is a good, if unremarkable portrait of a woman with some unique talent. Now if only the filmmakers had some unique talent to use on this project, we might have a more memorable film on our hands.",3,"""Miss Potter"" - Never A Bride, Always A Bridesmaid",1169683200,"01 25,

1053800,A188WBZZMNHMZ4,B000N4SHOE,tiggrie AKA Sarah,"[1, 2]","Beautifully filmed, and with a cracking supporting cast. Emily Watson & Lloyd Owen in particular brought their characters to life very well.I find Renee Zellweger a little annoying but I thought generally she was OK; her grieving I found very moving. A few too many screwing-up-the-face mannerisms but reasonably easy to overlook.Ewan McGregor as always is excellent and effortlessly charming.Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn are also good support to the main storyline.Potter's art is beautifully showcased and I rather enjoyed the animated characters in the paintings and drawings - Jemima Puddleduck a particular favourite.However I somehow felt there was something missing... the love story never really kicked in, not I think through fault of acting but just a lack in on screen chemistry. (I am not convinced by ""tremendous chemistry"" in Down With Love, I think the film manages to work despite the lack of it!) & although the grief scenes were beautifully done, things were all got over terribly quickly. I think this is partly the fault of trying to fit Potter's life into a film, and thus race through it far too quickly.On the whole, it's a ""nice"" movie, but it's not as good as one feels it could have been.The extras on the disc are also disappointing... overall, not one which I'll be likely to be adding to my collection unless I see it for sale very cheaply.",3,Charming but lacking.,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1372,"['Beautifully', 'filmed', 'cracking', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'particular', 'brought', 'characters', 'life', 'very', 'well.I', 'find', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'little', 'annoying', 'thought', 'generally', 'was', 'OK', 'grieving', 'found', 'very', 'moving', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'screwing-up-the-face', 'mannerisms', 'reasonably', 'easy', 'overlook.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'always', 'excellent', 'effortlessly', 'charming.Bill', 'Paterson', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'support', 'main', 'storyline.Potter', 'art', 'beautifully', 'showcased', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'animated', 'characters', 'paintings', 'drawings', 'Jemima', 'Puddleduck', 'particular', 'favourite.However', 'somehow', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'love', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'kicked', 'not', 'think', 'fault', 'acting', 'just', 'lack', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'tremendous', 'chemistry', 'Down', 'Love', 'think', 'film', 'work', 'lack', 'grief', 'scenes', 'were', 'beautifully', 'done', 'things', 'were', 'got', 'over', 'terribly', 'quickly', 'think', 'partly', 'fault', 'trying', 'fit', 'Potter', 'life', 'film', 'thus', 'race', 'far', 'too', 'quickly.On', 'whole', 'nice', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'also', 'disappointing', 'overall', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'likely', 'be', 'adding', 'collection', 'see', 'sale', 'very', 'cheaply']",N/A

Bolstered by capable cast including Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson, and the breathtakingly beautiful locations, ""Miss Potter"" is also unique in using animations to capture the imagination of Beatrix Potter.I won't repeat here her life story as other reviewers have done great jobs below. I only add that some of you might not find what you expect in ""Miss Potter,"" where romance plays a major role in the story. We see a glimpse of life of women living about one hundred years ago, and, yes, Miss Potter always has a chaperon, but things go pretty smooth for her from the beginning of the film. Her father and mother are understanding kind of parents, and after all, Beatrix Potter was a successful writer, which meant more options to take for her future. Cultural aspects of her story are not ignored, but not so strong as to prevent us from enjoying its romantic side.One of the most charming parts of the film is the romance between Beatrix and her publisher Norman played by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor respectively. I don't know why, but chemistry is visible between them, which was somehow missing in ""Down with Love"" starring the same players. Two interesting characters played by Emily Watson and Phyllida Law add colors and backgrounds to the character of Norman.One big thing happens in the middle of the story, and after that the film gets slower and, I'm afraid, weaker in terms of drama. You may not like that change, but I think the film is only trying to be faithful to her life story. Chris Noonan (his last film being ""Babe"") could have made the story more dramatic and eventful, but he made a quieter way to wrap up the story, which is probably a wiser course to take. The results are engaging story of Miss Potter, who, like the star playing her, is charming and unique in her own way.",4,Miss Potter: A Charming Story,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,1964,"['Miss', 'Potter', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'creator', 'beloved', 'tales', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'other', 'illustrated', 'tales', 'animals', 'Bolstered', 'capable', 'cast', 'including', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'also', 'unique', 'using', 'animations', 'capture', 'imagination', 'Beatrix', 'Potter.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'life', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'jobs', 'only', 'add', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'what', 'expect', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'where', 'romance', 'major', 'role', 'story', 'see', 'glimpse', 'life', 'women', 'living', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'yes', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'always', 'chaperon', 'things', 'go', 'pretty', 'smooth', 'beginning', 'film', 'father', 'mother', 'are', 'understanding', 'kind', 'parents', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'was', 'successful', 'writer', 'meant', 'more', 'options', 'take', 'future', 'Cultural', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'ignored', 'not', 'so', 'strong', 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'romantic', 'side.One', 'most', 'charming', 'parts', 'film', 'romance', 'Beatrix', 'publisher', 'Norman', 'played', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'respectively', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'chemistry', 'visible', 'was', 'somehow', 'missing', 'Down', 'Love', 'starring', 'same', 'players', 'Two', 'interesting', 'characters', 'played', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'add', 'colors', 'backgrounds', 'character', 'Norman.One', 'big', 'thing', 'middle', 'story', 'film', 'slower', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'weaker', 'terms', 'drama', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'change', 'think', 'film', 'only', 'trying', 'be', 'faithful', 'life', 'story', 'Chris', 'Noonan', 'last', 'film', 'being', 'Babe', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'dramatic', 'eventful', 'made', 'quieter', 'way', 'wrap', 'up', 'story', 'probably', 'wiser', 'course', 'take', 'results', 'are', 'engaging', 'story', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'who', 'star', 'playing', 'charming', 'unique', 'own', 'way']",N/A

Amazon Instant Video provided something to watch on a empty Saturday night, and I stumbled across this film about Beatrix Potter.  Of course, the name ""Peter Rabbit"" is recognized worldwide, but I knew nothing about the author behind the successful children's stories.  It's apparent that I've missed much in the area of children's literature!Being 32 and single in 1902 wins her the name of ""spinster,"" until Beatrix meets the man she falls in love with.  Played by Ewan McGregor, Norman Warne, is her first love who is in the family publishing business and works closely with her on her various releases.  They become engaged, but her family vehemently forbids the match due to the usual class system between the upper class and working tradesmen.  Nevertheless, Beatrix by now has become a self-supporting, rich woman from her royalties and spurns her parents' advice.  Unfortunately, her beau sadly passes away before they can marry.The story continues with her bid for freedom from her parents' domination, and she relocates to the Lake District where she buys a farm, and neighboring farms, to keep them protected from development.  Another love interest enters her life, and once again she finally finds happiness as she continues to pen her children stories throughout the remainder of her life.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film, with a sprinkle of fantasy.  The filmmaker allows her endearing animal characters to come alive on her pages  as she draws them.  She calls them her ""friends"" who are the only ones who really know and understand Beatrix Potter.  Though it seems odd that an artist/author should see her characters come to life on a page, I can attest from the muddled mind of my own stories, characters do tend to have a life of their own.With all that being said, I must confess that I thought the movie was horribly miscast. As much as I love Renee Zellweger in other roles, she makes a terrible English woman...no offense Renee.  She is quite toned down and a bit dowdy in appearance, but she has a horrible habit of facial expressions that look just plain painful and unnatural.  Picture a face after eating a sour pickle and that's Renee as Miss Potter. As far as the other performers, I had no qualms, but Renee really did nothing for me in the role.  It appears, though, that Renee was also one of the Executive Producers of the film, which probably is why she played the part that should have been given to another.All in all it was entertaining, informative, and cute.

Beatrix decides she will not marry, and instead will pursue a career as an author and illustrator of children's books - a very bold and unusual thing in Victorian England in the late 1800's. She receives scant encouragement in her pursuit until the Warne brothers agree to publish her first book, The Tale Of Peter Rabbit, and assign it to their youngest brother, Norman, in the hope he will fail and thereby give up the idea of joining them in the family business. Played by Ewan McGregor (Star Wars, Moulin Rouge, Down With Love, Big Fish), Norman becomes enchanted with Miss Potter and her book, as does his sister, Millie, played by Emily Watson (Gosford Park, The Waterhorse). The three become great friends, and eventually Norman and Beatrix fall in love.Meanwhile, Miss Potter's books are selling like hot cakes, and she eventually finds herself a very wealthy woman - much to the surprise of her mother, who has never understood her or her interest in art - and can now make her own way in the world - again, highly unusual for the time. She begins buying up estates in the Lake District of England - at first to settle there, but later to preserve the area as a farming district. Eventually, she donates 4,000 acres of the most prime real estate to the British people as a national trust. This is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see, and a wonderful story about a wonderful lady. It is full of imagination, cleverness and childhood magic.

An unusual woman makes a place for herself in a man's world, over the misdirected wishes of her family. She earns an independent income; it's not handed to her by family or marriage. Then, she uses her hard-earned wealth to preserve the beauty of the English countryside, a legacy that lives on today. Add in some personal triumphs and tragedies and it all came across nice enough in a drawing-room kind of way, but I found it forgettable.What an opportunity lost. Beatrix Potter was all that - successful children's author and strong, headstrong woman in a time when that was not widely appreciated. Before taking on children's books, she was a perceptive field scientist and innovative if isolated lab mycologist. Even the male establishment was forced to acknowledge her discoveries, and the watercolor paintings that illustrated her records would still improve many modern textbooks. (That scientific training guided the gorgeous precision that rendered Peter and the rest.) In frustration she turned to children's books, a more seemly occupation for a woman, and excelled. She also established a good-sized merchandising industry around her characters, and that just multiplied her uncommon financial success.The real, historical Potter deserves to have movies made about her - she just doesn't deserve this one. If you ignore the actual woman, scientist, and entrepeneur that the movie portrays, you'll find a fair but undemanding costume drama.

The movie explores the story of beloved children's author/illustrator, Beatrix Potter [Renee Zellweger] who finds her parents' lifestyle and social ambitions cloying and snobbish. She writes & illustrates stories for children as a way of escaping this rigid life. However, her efforts at getting published and taken seriously as an author face several stumbling blocks [this is after all England in the early 1900s] until she meets Norman Warner[ Ewan McGregor] and together they make history with the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Their romance is portrayed in such an understated manner yet effective in showing their genuine love and affection for one another. This movie reminded me of Finding Neverland [with Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie] but not as dark and much more uplifting. Renee Zellweger is enchanting in her role as Miss Potter[except for the awful British accent], and Ewan McGregor is convincing in his role as her love interest.Emily Watson shines in her role as Norman's sister who develops a genuine friendship with Potter. The cinematography deserves special mention - the lush depictions of the English countryside and the serene beauty of the Lake District. All in all, it is an inspiring tale of perseverance, love, loss, and convictions that is sure to uplift one's spirit.",5,A most enchanting story!,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,1426,"['Miss', 'Potter', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'imagination', 'tugs', 'heartstrings', 'well', 'movie', 'story', 'beloved', 'children', 'author/illustrator', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', '[', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', ']', 'who', 'parents', 'lifestyle', 'social', 'ambitions', 'cloying', 'snobbish', 'stories', 'children', 'way', 'escaping', 'rigid', 'life', 'However', 'efforts', 'getting', 'published', 'taken', 'seriously', 'author', 'face', 'several', 'stumbling', 'blocks', '[', 'England', 'early', '1900s', ']', 'Norman', 'Warner', '[', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', ']', 'together', 'make', 'history', 'publication', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'romance', 'portrayed', 'such', 'understated', 'manner', 'yet', 'effective', 'showing', 'genuine', 'love', 'affection', 'one', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Finding', 'Neverland', '[', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'J.M', 'Barrie', ']', 'not', 'dark', 'much', 'more', 'uplifting', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'enchanting', 'role', 'Miss', 'Potter', '[', 'awful', 'British', 'accent', ']', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'convincing', 'role', 'love', 'interest.Emily', 'Watson', 'shines', 'role', 'Norman', 'sister', 'who', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'Potter', 'cinematography', 'special', 'mention', 'lush', 'depictions', 'English', 'countryside', 'serene', 'beauty', 'Lake', 'District', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'perseverance', 'love', 'loss', 'convictions', 'sure', 'uplift', 'one', 'spirit']",N/A
