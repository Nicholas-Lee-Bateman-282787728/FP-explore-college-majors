My original impression is that the acting was a little stiff and not much to grip me into the story.  However, as it unfolded (like a good mystery should), I found myself gravitating to the story, the characters and the true suspense.  In a old-style Hitchcock way, the understand and sometimes non-existent soundtrack gave me no clues as to who the real murderer was.  Really, the only time I remember receiving those audio clues was for the patsy suspected killer and when a murder had occurred.  In the end, I was completely moved by the story, and bought into the characters.  Top that off with it being a clean movie and I would consider adding that to my collection.",5,Suspense mystery with a hint of Hitchcock,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,753,"['found', 'movie', 'little', 'difficult', 'get', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'My', 'original', 'impression', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'stiff', 'not', 'much', 'grip', 'story', 'However', 'unfolded', 'good', 'mystery', 'should', 'found', 'gravitating', 'story', 'characters', 'true', 'suspense', 'old-style', 'Hitchcock', 'way', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'non-existent', 'soundtrack', 'gave', 'clues', 'who', 'real', 'murderer', 'was', 'Really', 'only', 'time', 'remember', 'receiving', 'audio', 'clues', 'was', 'patsy', 'suspected', 'killer', 'when', 'murder', 'had', 'occurred', 'end', 'was', 'completely', 'moved', 'story', 'bought', 'characters', 'Top', 'off', 'being', 'clean', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A
703024,A3L5SNISL3VCTB,B000067J0L,Dave,"[3, 12]","I'm a Mormon. I liked God's Army. I live in small town Utah.That being said, let me tell you what my thoughts were on Brigham City.This movie had its heart in the right place, but it couldn't overcome the writer's shortcomings. It's like he wrote this movie with absolutely no research. If I were a small town cop, I'd be offended by this movie.It portrays small town police as naive and unwilling to get involved with investigations. When they do finally decide to get involved, after two people have been murdered, they do the stupidest things I've ever seen. These are the worst cops ever! We find out early on that the ""sheriff"" couldn't pass a POST exam because first he can't run, second he can't shoot. In the state of Utah, you have to be POST certified to be a sheriff or any type of law officer.These cops apparently never had POST or any other training. At one point they are responding to a dead body and the sheriff wants to keep it quiet, so the police show up with sirens and lights blaring. Why do they need the sirens on? The person is already dead. Things like this don't bother the cops of Brigham City. They break more rules in the first half of this movie than in all of the Lethal Weapon films combined. Before they investigate, the Aaronic Priesthood holders (for you none-Mormons, it's basically all the boy scout-aged boys) are called up to distribute a police flyer.Then the investigation begins, but instead of investigating, the police go to a bar, life finger prints off everyone in town who drinks and run them through the FBI computer. How many things are fundamentally wrong with this? Anyway, when that fails, and the body count continues to rise, they call all the Elders and High Priest (for the non-mormons, these are the men of the ward) to do a door-to-door search of the entire town. This leads to a scene where a man's porno collection is found. They arrest him based on his VHS collection and even though they don't have anything to hold him on, they hold him anyway.  They do all this without a warrant. Even if they found the body of the girl they were looking for, it wouldn't matter because they obtained the information illegally, the court would have no choice but the throw out the case and the killer would walk free. But the heroes of our story can't be bothered with details like that.There is some skill in the making of the film with some really suspenseful moments, but it feels like it was written by an eighth grade English student.  It has a surprise plot twist I guessed early on.One of the characters tells the sheriff, ""You're a good man."" They should have said, ""You're  a good man, and maybe even a good bishop, but you sir are a really terrible police officer.""Ultimately, this movie is as dumb as anything Hollywood puts out, but without any of the humor. Not one light, humorous moment.

The primary unfolding drama is the story of the small town's sheriff facing up to the sudden presence of a serial killer in their innocent little western oasis where nobody even locks their doors. What I really enjoyed, as both a non-Mormon and a strong believer in mysticism , was the film's humanization of Mormons through the subplot of a small faith-based subculture confronting tragedy and resolving its place in a non-believing world. I enjoyed the tension between the &quot;outsider&quot; female FBI agent and the widower sherriff (who is also a Mormon Bishop).The film has some flaws; but its by-the-book predictable plot devices don't get in the way of it being a deeply affecting film about the place of spirituality in modern life.

WHY???  I'll never know, but I have found out since that I have been glad that I did.Richard Dutcher.  Who in the WORLD is Richard Dutcher?  Other than writing, producing, acting AND directing this movie, I'd have to say he's a pretty smart fella.  Is he in a league with some of the grossly overpaid directors working today?  No -- not YET.  As others have gone out of their way to state, 'Brigham City' is a Murder/Mystery set in a small Utah town that lives, eats and breathes as a very strong LDS Community (Mormon).  Some reviewers, who are obviously anti-Mormon, and have a rather slanted version of ANYTHING done by ANYONE who happens to be a member of this religion have taken the low-road and blasted the movie's inclusion of the LDS faith, almost as an additional character in the story.  But for those of us who live in small rural communities, and have an understanding of the LDS beliefs, you realize that a story such as this could NOT be even remotely accurate without the religious additions to the storyline.With that said, 'Brigham City' is a facinating mystery tale told rather well.  Aside from Wilford Brimley, I recognized absolutely NOBODY...and that turned out to be actually a nice plus to the film.  A well-meaning Brigham City Sherrif stumbles upon a murder, and after first trying to brush it under the local floor mat to preserve the image that small towns simply do NOT have to deal with tragedies such as this, an additional horrific crime scene is discovered.  Before long, the sherrif must come to terms with the frightening realization that a serial murderer is on the loose in this tight knit community.  This forces the Sherrif into overdrive mode and he immediately takes action in ways that would cause almost all lawyers in North America to suffer heart attacks, but in small towns such as Brigham, the end result is not whether or not you violated someones rights in order to save a life, it's whether or not you saved a life -- PERIOD.  Can't say as I blame them.  I'm not too sure I'd be worried about having a search warrant if it meant ending the suffering of someone captured and held with the very real possibility of being murdered.  All that aside, (we could debate it for a very long time, I would imagine) this story is genuinely surprising, especially in unmasking who the real culprit is.  I admit I had him pegged fairly early on, but I waivered several times as the story unfolded, but that certainly didn't stop my overall enjoyment of seeing the plot unwind.I am going to be recommending this to all my friends who are fans of murder/mysteries.  And once again, for those of you who are stanch anti-Mormon, yes, it'd be a good idea to skip this, but if you can keep your short-sightedness in check for 2 hours, you just might end up learning something about the LDS Church, and enjoy yourself at the same time.  Something that I must admit happened to my wife and I as we sat and watched this engrossing tale.

It pretty clear that he must have learned many lessons from his first movie since Brigham City proves to be a highly interesting movie and well crafted one.Both acting and directing seem to be a major improvement over God's Army and this time around there seem to be a script that works and story that grabbed your interest. This is a LDS movie with a LDS theme but that doesn't interfered with the general story since the theme is reflected more in the characters of movie then the story. The main characters are Mormons and they behaved as such, just the way if the main characters were Catholics, they would behaved as such. The Mormon faith prevailed over the characters but it doesn't clutter the movie.Personally, I think its the Mormon characters that bring an interesting perception to this serial killer story which otherwise would be relatively humdum in nature thanks to the familiar theme.As a sheriff of a small town and a religous leader, the lead character, Wes Clayton have responsiblity and power most cops don't have. With such responsiblity and power, and a life at stake, his actions may appears reasonable even if they are technically illegal. (Can Wes be the kindlier gentler Dirty Harry??) As for the complaint the Wes can't walk so he can't be the sheriff, I think when he was injured, he was already a sheriff so he can be remain a sheriff as long as the town wants him.Not being Mormon, I am not sure exactly all the identification procedures but my bet is, Matthew Brown's character simply slip through the crack. The guilt that Wes felt toward the end was the fact the he screwed up by NOT running Brown's character fingerprint as he was supposed to, which allowed him to slip through the crack, a human error of colossal level but yet forgiving one considering the informal atmosphere of an informal small town where everyone is so laid back.On the few negative sides, I thought the director's used of his ""red herring"" proves to be very clumsy and heavy handed. I was bit surprised how casual the sheriff was with killer as the latter was assembling his gun. All the sheriff have to do take a single piece to prevent the gun from being operational but he sat there doing nothing but talk.

Mordecai ""Gum Flip Flop""","[5, 6]","I'm a Mormon and a huge fan of suspense thrillers and this film was right up my alley, being a murder mystery and a product of Zion Films. In the small Mormon town of Brigham City, Richard Dutcher and his missionary companion, Mathew Brown, from God's Army, return to play companion officers of the law. However, I was so drawn into the movie early on, I never found myself making comparisons to the first film. Probably because I was so wrapped up, not only in the ""who dunnit"" aspect of the film, but Dutcher's flawed yet basically good character and in the moral delemma created by having Dutcher being a bishop of the predominantly Mormon town as well as the sheriff. The Sheriff/Bishop means only well and appears to be the shephard keeping watch over his flock, which makes it harder to watch as he inadvertantly helps the murderer violate the town as he allows prejudice and distrust to mar his investigation. The bishop/sheriff eventually finds the killer but only after he fails in many respects as the town's protector. The story is heart-breaking and edifying at the same time as the bishop discovers his short comings as he attempts to serve the town and allows evil's shadow to be cast over the once innocent town. Yet, by the end, the Gospel become the town's much needed healing salve after the murderer is discovered and the town is again safe from him. I'd caution that this film is appropriately rated PG-13, but it does not have gratuitous violence and doesn't have a single cuss word or sex scene.

He's a tad portly, with one knee in a full brace.  He's not much of a shot with a handgun andhas never fired at a living thing since a boyhood trauma while out hunting.  He's soft-spoken and somewhat withdrawn since the car accident that killed hiswife and son and left him gimpy.  And he's a Mormon bishop.  Of course, Brigham City isn't your typical police beat.  It's a place where folks leave their doorsunlocked at night and where there's never been a murder.  Or, there had never been a murder, until Clayton and his over-eager young deputy, Terry, find thebody of a young California woman who was driving through town before someone crushed her skull.Where Terry sees an exciting opportunity to investigate a real crime for once, Clayton only hopes to protect his town from being affected by this contaminationfrom the outside world, and his initial efforts are mostly directed towards hushing up the murder and getting the FBI to handle the case.  But he recognizes therisk to the community that this intrusion of evil poses :What we got here is a little paradise. And nothing attracts a serpent like a paradise.And, as other murders are committed, it becomes obvious that the serpent has indeed settled in Brigham City.  In the scene that gave director Richard Dutcherthe idea for the film, the corpse of one victim, a beauty queen, is found under the lovely white gazebo in the town square. Clayton asks Terry : ""You had enoughof the real world yet?""  But must confront the possibility that his own failure to reckon with the possibility of such evil may have contributed to the killer'scause.Mr. Dutcher gives a very quiet, soulful performance as a man who's frightened of the violence of the outside world and within his own heart.  His devotion tohis community and his friends and neighbors leads him to strain constitutional bounds in ways that are troubling but understandable, just as his confrontationwith evil forces him to strain the bounds of his own morality, in ways that trouble him but are understandable to us and to the characters around him.  There'sa closing scene based around the communion that is one of the most affecting you'll ever see and while it, and much else here, is sort of religious propaganda, itis quite effective as drama too.Make no mistake about it, this is a proselytizing film and it may not appeal to all tastes.  But it is a fascinating glimpse into Mormon culture, a fine thoughgimmicky mystery/thriller, and a thoughtful and thought-provoking meditation on the persistence of evil.GRADE : A-",5,the persistence of evil,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2612,"['Wes', 'Clayton', 'Richard', 'Dutcher', 'odd', 'kind', 'sheriff', 'tad', 'portly', 'one', 'knee', 'full', 'brace', 'not', 'much', 'shot', 'handgun', 'andhas', 'never', 'fired', 'living', 'thing', 'boyhood', 'trauma', 'out', 'hunting', 'soft-spoken', 'somewhat', 'withdrawn', 'car', 'accident', 'killed', 'hiswife', 'son', 'left', 'gimpy', 'Mormon', 'bishop', 'course', 'Brigham', 'City', ""n't"", 'typical', 'police', 'beat', 'place', 'where', 'folks', 'leave', 'doorsunlocked', 'night', 'where', 'never', 'been', 'murder', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'murder', 'Clayton', 'over-eager', 'young', 'deputy', 'Terry', 'find', 'thebody', 'young', 'California', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'town', 'someone', 'crushed', 'skull.Where', 'Terry', 'exciting', 'opportunity', 'investigate', 'real', 'crime', 'once', 'Clayton', 'only', 'protect', 'town', 'being', 'affected', 'contaminationfrom', 'outside', 'world', 'initial', 'efforts', 'are', 'mostly', 'directed', 'towards', 'hushing', 'up', 'murder', 'getting', 'FBI', 'handle', 'case', 'therisk', 'community', 'intrusion', 'evil', 'poses', 'What', 'got', 'here', 'little', 'paradise', 'nothing', 'serpent', 'paradise.And', 'other', 'murders', 'are', 'committed', 'obvious', 'serpent', 'indeed', 'settled', 'Brigham', 'City', 'scene', 'gave', 'director', 'Richard', 'Dutcherthe', 'idea', 'film', 'corpse', 'one', 'victim', 'beauty', 'queen', 'found', 'lovely', 'white', 'gazebo', 'town', 'square', 'Clayton', 'Terry', 'had', 'enoughof', 'real', 'world', 'yet', 'must', 'confront', 'possibility', 'own', 'failure', 'reckon', 'possibility', 'such', 'evil', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', ""killer'scause.Mr"", 'Dutcher', 'very', 'quiet', 'soulful', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'frightened', 'violence', 'outside', 'world', 'own', 'heart', 'devotion', 'tohis', 'community', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'strain', 'constitutional', 'bounds', 'ways', 'are', 'troubling', 'understandable', 'just', 'confrontationwith', 'evil', 'forces', 'strain', 'bounds', 'own', 'morality', 'ways', 'trouble', 'are', 'understandable', 'characters', ""There'sa"", 'closing', 'scene', 'based', 'communion', 'one', 'most', 'affecting', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'much', 'else', 'here', 'sort', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'itis', 'quite', 'effective', 'drama', 'too.Make', 'mistake', 'proselytizing', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'tastes', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'Mormon', 'culture', 'fine', 'thoughgimmicky', 'mystery/thriller', 'thoughtful', 'thought-provoking', 'meditation', 'persistence', 'evil.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Aside from having a mostly unknown cast, the film was written, directed, produced, and starred Richard Dutcher, who created a production company called Mormon Cinema, which only makes Mormon related films. I have found that when a film comes from such a strong religious backing, that it usual has a preachy agenda, and tends to focus more on religion than anything else, but to my surprise, Brigham City does not. The film does takes place in a Mormon community, all the characters are Moron, and there is a religious angel to the film, that includes several scenes in the church, which were slow, but thankfully not overwhelming. The story centers around this small religious community in Utah, that is suddenly rocked by a series of murders. Dutcher, plays the sheriff, a highly respect, deeply religious man, grieving for the loss of his family. His town has always been a paradise and has never faced anything like this before, so the sheriff needs to come up with some pretty interesting ways to catch the killer. Dutcher was excellent in his role, after all he wrote it, and who else is better equipped to play such a role? What I really liked was how different the story was, this wasn't just your typical manhunt for a killer on the loose, there were many different facets to this film that made it unique. What gave Brigham City it's fourth star was the amazing twist at the end that no one will see coming. I've seen a lot of films like this and 9 times out of 10, I have the killer pegged before they are revealed, but this film completely blindsided me, which proves to be just another example of how clever it is. Yes, there is some religion and yes much of the cast is unknown, but I found this film to be fascinating.
