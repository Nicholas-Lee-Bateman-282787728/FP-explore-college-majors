Why talented, heralded actors like Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro choose to make films like this is even more unfathomable - Ishtar was Citizen Kane compared to either of these excreble excuses for entertainment. I saw both of these on the recommendation of people I'm close to; it's clear that, though I love them both dearly, their taste in movies and mine are very, very different. I haven't laughed so little since I saw Camille Claudel - but that won't mean much to most of you.
