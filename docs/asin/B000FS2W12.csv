994484,A1L0W5MGW0TKWV,B000FS2W12,"C. Logan ""Missy""","[0, 0]","In season four of Degrassi: The Next Generation, the show changes from a relatable teen drama, into an over the top parody of teen life. I'm not knocking the show, because even despite a weak season like this, Degrassi is still one of the best teen dramas on television. However, season four takes the show into over-dramatic territory, which is why I consider it one of the weakest seasons, with a few high points.The main problem I have with season four is the amount of drama crammed into each episode. Take the season four premiere for example. In ""Ghost in the Machine"", Paige's rape trial finally goes into effect. In some of the earlier seasons, that would've been enough to carry the entire episode. But instead, the show added more drama to add more shock value. Paige conveniently runs into her rapist at a college frat party, purposely runs into his car and totals it, and then has her boyfriend take the heat by getting arrested. This is what I mean by over the top. Too much drama for one episode. I liked it better when the show focused on the issues and less on dramatic effect.However, despite that one nitpick I have about this season, there are also a lot of wonderful episodes and storylines that ensue. One of the highlights of season four is Rick's storyline which develops wonderfully on screen. Rick is immediately introduced as a villain right from the start, as we know he's the guy responsible for putting Terri in a coma in season three. Consequently he is shunned and outcasted at school by his peers, which inevitably pushes him over the edge and causes him to bring a gun to school in ""Time Stands Still"", which is still considered one of the shows best, highest rated episodes to date. The aftermath of Rick's actions become a major part of the second half of this season, as some of the main characters are largely effected by what happened.Other issues covered this season are: bipolar disorder, STDs, and paralysis.Overall season four is filled with drama and spectacles of great proportions. However, I feel like this season the show lost a bit of its light hearted edge and the issues became less real and relatable and more over the top. However, a couple of great storylines make the season more enjoyable. And like I said, despite some weak points, it's still better than most teen dramas on television today.",4,Drama Takes Over,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2348,"['season', 'four', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'show', 'relatable', 'teen', 'drama', 'top', 'parody', 'teen', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'show', 'even', 'weak', 'season', 'Degrassi', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'dramas', 'television', 'However', 'season', 'four', 'show', 'over-dramatic', 'territory', 'why', 'consider', 'one', 'weakest', 'seasons', 'few', 'high', 'points.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'season', 'four', 'amount', 'drama', 'crammed', 'episode', 'Take', 'season', 'four', 'premiere', 'example', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'Paige', 'rape', 'trial', 'finally', 'effect', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enough', 'carry', 'entire', 'episode', 'instead', 'show', 'added', 'more', 'drama', 'add', 'more', 'shock', 'value', 'Paige', 'conveniently', 'rapist', 'college', 'frat', 'party', 'purposely', 'car', 'totals', 'then', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'heat', 'getting', 'arrested', 'what', 'mean', 'top', 'Too', 'much', 'drama', 'one', 'episode', 'liked', 'better', 'when', 'show', 'focused', 'issues', 'less', 'dramatic', 'effect.However', 'one', 'nitpick', 'have', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'episodes', 'storylines', 'ensue', 'One', 'highlights', 'season', 'four', 'Rick', 'storyline', 'wonderfully', 'screen', 'Rick', 'immediately', 'introduced', 'villain', 'right', 'start', 'know', 'guy', 'responsible', 'putting', 'Terri', 'coma', 'season', 'three', 'Consequently', 'shunned', 'outcasted', 'school', 'peers', 'inevitably', 'edge', 'bring', 'gun', 'school', 'Time', 'Stands', 'Still', 'still', 'considered', 'one', 'shows', 'best', 'highest', 'rated', 'episodes', 'date', 'aftermath', 'Rick', 'actions', 'become', 'major', 'part', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'largely', 'effected', 'what', 'happened.Other', 'issues', 'covered', 'season', 'are', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'STDs', 'paralysis.Overall', 'season', 'four', 'filled', 'drama', 'spectacles', 'great', 'proportions', 'However', 'feel', 'season', 'show', 'lost', 'bit', 'light', 'hearted', 'edge', 'issues', 'became', 'less', 'real', 'relatable', 'more', 'top', 'However', 'couple', 'great', 'storylines', 'make', 'season', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'said', 'weak', 'points', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'teen', 'dramas', 'television', 'today']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 4"

994488,AOU1I52M83CLV,B000FS2W12,Jonathan Clark,"[24, 29]","I accidently stumbbled onto Degrassi several years ago over a Christmas break and found the show to be easily addictive. Not being one for the standard sterotypical high school scene like in the OC or Dawson's Creek I was stunned on how well the show was put together along side it's addictiveness.Not only is the show intelligently written and plotted the acting from the youthful cast is spectacular. Each character (as partly a result from them being well written) is brought out onto the screen with that particular oddness and poignancy that is all to familar with someone who just left high school.This is not a show where the entire cast is drop down gorgeous nor act exactly the same; there is a wonderful diversity with the roster of characters present. They all don't wear most expensive clothes or drive the most expensive cars to school and do not go around spouting out mindless phrases such as 'waxing philosophical.' This is a real life show displaying real life characters with real life problems and having those characters work through them with real life means.About six months after I discovered this little gem of a show I found with much surprise that the DVD sets for each season were available and freaked out; quickly drove to the store and laid down my money. I bought season one sortly before season two came out in Aug. 2005, and saw that the release date for the third season was already scheduled for this past March and quickly pre-ordered. I watched them the entire way through and was able to pick up larger story arcs that I had missed when I saw the reruns on the Noggin Network and longed for more after the last episode had ended on the third season disk set. Once again I saw the release date was only about six months away after the third season (a very short time considering it takes over a year for each season of most other shows to be released on DVD).I wrote a review for the third season of this show months back and claimed it the be the best season of the entire show (based on what I had picked up on TV and later watched on DVD) and still claim that, but must admit that season four is a very close second.As in past shows Degrassi boldly faces down such issues as teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs, sex, cutting, homosexuality, violence, and much much more with a raw force that other shows would only dream of doing. The fourth season however goes even further with such issues as noted and beyond.Not to give anything away (though I will give away some) a school shooting occurs, a student is murdered, another paralyzed, affairs of the heart go out of control, secrets are revealed, and pretty much the same intensity ignites as it has done in the past seasons.Though some has called this show pretentious, overly dramatic, or just plain stupid they need to think again and take a look at the other shows out there depicting life in high school and recall what it was like for themselves years past in high school. I for one (as someone who just left it) find Degrassi to be all to true to the reality that teens go through as they walk the halls to class. It's safe to simply say this show gets it right.As for the DVD as with the past three seasons the extras seem to be a step above one another with each passing season. Deleted/extended scenes, gag reels, casting tapes; the usual (I'm not one who does much with extra features on DVDs apart from deleted scenes). The quality of the print of each episode is great (the only drawback is it's in fullscreen (although apart from HBO DVDs not many TV shows that I own are in widescreen format)).In the end is Degrassi worth laying down the money for? Absolutely...100%...YES!!! It is a must own for fans of the show, fans of high school programs, and fans of people who just like plain good old television; you will not be disappointed.",5,The 4th Season of the Best High School Drama Ever!!!,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,3838,"['accidently', 'stumbbled', 'Degrassi', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Christmas', 'break', 'found', 'show', 'be', 'easily', 'addictive', 'Not', 'being', 'one', 'standard', 'sterotypical', 'high', 'school', 'scene', 'OC', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'side', 'addictiveness.Not', 'only', 'show', 'intelligently', 'written', 'plotted', 'acting', 'youthful', 'cast', 'spectacular', 'character', 'partly', 'result', 'being', 'well', 'written', 'brought', 'out', 'screen', 'particular', 'oddness', 'poignancy', 'familar', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'high', 'school.This', 'not', 'show', 'where', 'entire', 'cast', 'drop', 'down', 'gorgeous', 'act', 'exactly', 'same', 'wonderful', 'diversity', 'roster', 'characters', 'present', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'most', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'drive', 'most', 'expensive', 'cars', 'school', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'around', 'spouting', 'out', 'mindless', 'phrases', 'such', ""'waxing"", 'philosophical', 'real', 'life', 'show', 'displaying', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'problems', 'having', 'characters', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'six', 'months', 'discovered', 'little', 'gem', 'show', 'found', 'much', 'surprise', 'DVD', 'sets', 'season', 'were', 'available', 'freaked', 'out', 'quickly', 'drove', 'store', 'laid', 'down', 'money', 'bought', 'season', 'one', 'sortly', 'season', 'two', 'came', 'out', 'Aug.', '2005', 'saw', 'release', 'date', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'already', 'scheduled', 'past', 'March', 'quickly', 'pre-ordered', 'watched', 'entire', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'larger', 'story', 'had', 'missed', 'when', 'saw', 'reruns', 'Noggin', 'Network', 'longed', 'more', 'last', 'episode', 'had', 'ended', 'third', 'season', 'disk', 'set', 'Once', 'again', 'saw', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'six', 'months', 'away', 'third', 'season', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'considering', 'over', 'year', 'season', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', '.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'third', 'season', 'show', 'months', 'back', 'claimed', 'be', 'best', 'season', 'entire', 'show', 'based', 'what', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'TV', 'later', 'watched', 'DVD', 'still', 'claim', 'must', 'admit', 'season', 'four', 'very', 'close', 'second.As', 'past', 'shows', 'Degrassi', 'boldly', 'down', 'such', 'issues', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'sex', 'cutting', 'homosexuality', 'violence', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'raw', 'force', 'other', 'shows', 'would', 'only', 'dream', 'doing', 'fourth', 'season', 'however', 'even', 'further', 'such', 'issues', 'noted', 'beyond.Not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'school', 'shooting', 'student', 'murdered', 'paralyzed', 'affairs', 'heart', 'go', 'control', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'intensity', 'done', 'past', 'seasons.Though', 'called', 'show', 'pretentious', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'need', 'think', 'again', 'take', 'look', 'other', 'out', 'there', 'depicting', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'recall', 'what', 'was', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'find', 'Degrassi', 'be', 'true', 'reality', 'go', 'walk', 'halls', 'class', 'safe', 'simply', 'say', 'show', 'right.As', 'DVD', 'past', 'three', 'seasons', 'extras', 'seem', 'be', 'step', 'one', 'passing', 'season', 'Deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reels', 'casting', 'tapes', 'usual', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'much', 'extra', 'features', 'DVDs', 'apart', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'quality', 'print', 'episode', 'great', 'only', 'drawback', 'fullscreen', 'apart', 'HBO', 'DVDs', 'not', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'own', 'are', 'widescreen', 'format', 'end', 'Degrassi', 'laying', 'down', 'money', 'Absolutely', '100', '%', 'YES', 'must', 'own', 'fans', 'show', 'fans', 'high', 'school', 'programs', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'old', 'television', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 4"

994493,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000FS2W12,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","Cons: I know every single relationship detail about every single girl on this show besides Hazel (played by Andrea Lewis), which makes little to no sense considering she's the girlfriend of a main character, Jimmy (played by Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham). When Jimmy was shot, the only time Hazel was in the hospital was to cry from outside of the hospital room. Although we saw other cast members (mainly Craig and Marco) visit, Hazel and Jimmy never had any alone time. Hazel is treated like an extra, which makes no sense to me considering the writers tried to bring her more exposure inDegrassi: The Next Generation - Season Threewith ""Take on Me."" If you're going to put the two together, you might as well actually give them actual stories together. Even when Jimmy came home, Hazel is hanging in the back, smiling and talking about ""My boyfriend's back."" What girlfriend is going to be that laid-back about her boyfriend coming back to school in a wheelchair? Even Ashley's character (who I was surprised didn't visit him considering they were friends even though they were no longer in a relationship) had a small ""hi"" moment with Jimmy. The two might as well have not been a couple with the way she's blatantly being ignored in cast writing. Meanwhile we find out all about Emma's oral fixation, Paige chasing behind a student teacher, Ellie struggling to keep a dead-end relationship ""happy,"" Liberty STILL crushing on J.T., and Ashley's up-down relationship with Craig. Manny's new relationship threw me off completely, but we got intimate details about her new beau and even reminders about her one-time relationship with J.T. So why can't Hazel get just a moment on the entire season outside of two crying scenes about Jimmy being shot?Pros: I loved the episodes with Rick (played by Ephraim Ellis). He did a perfect job of playing the character we knew we shouldn't like but was sympathetic for all the same. The episodes with him being bullied at the school reminded me of Jodi Picoult's bookNineteen Minutes. The whole time I was watching those episodes, I was getting angrier thinking, ""You all better leave that boy alone."" But then, I kept thinking, ""He deserved it for what he did."" I haven't seen the other seasons, but this is such a timely and valid concern for today's audience on how kids go from being vulnerable to vengeful. I especially enjoyed the complex reaction from Rick's mother and the episode with Jimmy and Rick having a few much-needed conversations. By now, everybody probably knows Jimmy ended up in a wheelchair, but I didn't know how or why. I loved those episodes. I also enjoyed watching Sean's reaction--although I truly wish Daniel Clark and Lauren Collins would stop doing that pursed-lip-pouty-face when they're mad. It's hard to take them seriously when their mad expressions look like something a two-year-old would do.The rest of the episodes were cool, but I just got tired of hearing about Paige. There were so many other characters on the show, and I was more interested in hearing about the ones who get left out. Manny and Ellie have a lot more depth to their characters, and they're not your typical popular teen girl. Paige is painfully boring to me, and I've seen her character one too many times, but she did surprise me ONE time during the shooting episode. That's the first time I actually appreciated her character. I was surprised to find myself liking Emma more and more, although she's still manipulative and slightly annoying. However, her scenes with Rick made me admire her busybody personality. I still don't care about the adults on the show. After seeing their scenarios once, I fast forward straight through them to get back to the kids. I think they should be treated like adults from the Peanuts comic strips. Wah wah wah wah wah wah.Fun show though, and I'm still watching. I can't wait to finish the seasons off! BTW, the bonus scenes with the bloopers were great this time around. On Season 3, they weren't really funny, just mistakes. On Season 4, the ones with Liberty and J.T. were THE best.
