In the movie there are many important messages about faith. Mel Gibson plays one of his typical rolls and has a stellar performance.The film took place on a farm out in Pennsylvania. The scenery and filming is beautiful with great aerial and reflection shots. There were lots of very suspenseful scenes, and some humor thrown in a couple times. Joaquin Phoenix steals the show with a performance even better than his in Gladiator. The overall plat involves Mel Gibson's wife dying and him questioning his faith. Then there begins to be sightings of Crop circle including one on his family's yard. then they begin to attack, and the best part is that they show the TV stations so you really think that they are attacking. Night pulls of an ending even better than the sixth sense and everything pulls together.I think that the title of the movie can account for the two main plot strands of the movie; one being the signs that he will regain his faith and his wife didn't die for nothing, the other being that of the Crop Signs.Overall, it is probably in my top ten movies of all time.",5,Great movie in all aspects,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1207,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'best', 'even', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Night', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'important', 'messages', 'faith', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'one', 'typical', 'rolls', 'stellar', 'performance.The', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'farm', 'out', 'Pennsylvania', 'scenery', 'filming', 'beautiful', 'great', 'aerial', 'reflection', 'shots', 'were', 'lots', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'humor', 'thrown', 'couple', 'times', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'show', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'Gladiator', 'overall', 'plat', 'involves', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'wife', 'dying', 'questioning', 'faith', 'Then', 'be', 'sightings', 'Crop', 'circle', 'including', 'one', 'family', 'yard', 'then', 'begin', 'attack', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'TV', 'stations', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'attacking', 'Night', 'pulls', 'ending', 'even', 'better', 'sixth', 'sense', 'everything', 'pulls', 'together.I', 'think', 'title', 'movie', 'can', 'account', 'two', 'main', 'plot', 'strands', 'movie', 'one', 'being', 'signs', 'will', 'regain', 'faith', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'nothing', 'other', 'being', 'Crop', 'Signs.Overall', 'probably', 'top', 'ten', 'movies', 'time']",Signs

594824,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JL3T,A Customer,"[0, 1]","It really wasn't what I was expecting.Summary:Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former minister who has become an atheist as a result of his wife dying in an car accident.  (Ray Reddy, who is played by M. Night Shyamalan, was the person who was driving the truck that killed Graham's wife.)  As an atheist he can't really serve his function as minister anymore so he turns to farming.  The movie opens up with Graham and his younger brother, Merrill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) chasing through their cornfields to find Graham's kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) who have wandered off in the early morning.  What they end up finding is a crop circle.The crop circle and the other accompanying spooky occurrences and signs that begin happening are portends of the coming alien invasion. ...My Comments:It was obvious if you had heard anything about the movie that it was supposed to about aliens and crop circles.  And if you have seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) then it should have been obvious that there was going to be a twist.  If you watch some of the extra features on the DVD, Shyamalan reveals that the movie is based on Hitchcock's The Birds and several other older horror films.  Though some might consider the setting (that most of the movie takes place in a house) limiting, I thought it really allowed us to get to know the characters, so that didn't bother me.  And, like The Birds, the movie never really explains a lot of what is happening, which did kind of bother me at times.  We see what the TV says, but we never really know what is going on.  The acting is good and the overall production is fun, but the film ends up with an overtly strong message.  I'm not sure if Shyamalan is religious, but if he isn't, he certainly is emphasizing a return to religion or at the very least he is trying to portray religion in a very positive light.  What about the fear of God that religious people carry with them?  How is that fear any less than the fear of death that atheists have?Overall, I did enjoy the movie.  I thought the message (if you want to call it that) was a bit blatant and that has a tendency to ruin things for me.  Also, the story kind of jumped in places and, even though it is fun not to know why certain things are happening, sometimes it is nice to know that they make sense.  The movie didn't always make sense.  If you like Shyamalan, you should enjoy this.  I have heard some people were really frightened by the movie.  I thought it was more entertaining than frightening.  Shyamalan's forte is not horror films but films with unexpected twists.",3,Good if you like M.

Of all things, when our national conscience and sensitivities have already been so violated by that republican Corn Holography!  The Victoria's Secret Service displayed its usual partisan deference to our freely elected chief.  Corporate America and Hollywood practically gave Monica (Mada Hare) Lewinski a medal for her service to her country--the short thinkin'-money hungry crowd enjoys prestige and indecencies without question in rouge.  I expected more from the Indian director, a refreshing departure from our Western corruptions and monolithic thought structures, not that I am suggesting or insinuating a complicity in any way shape or form with the infamous American sex scandal.  I guess everyone has to adapt, tow the cinematic line, and provide the prescriptions for imbecility and infantile simplicity turned into an unwritten standard for film mass distribution--at least we're looking in the same building for adjoining offices, Dumb and Dumber.We must first appreciate the effort applied in the film, to distort the geographic regions of the crop circles phenomenon--transporting them to the inauthentic locations of America and India.  The South of England is exempt, nothing wrong there.  And the Americans can figure it out with their standard lurching reliefs and implements for barbarous survival, successful in thwarting an advanced alien species capable of traversing the stars--a Flintstonian retaliation on the antigravity civilization with a Louiseville Slugger diplomacy.  The movie sets antipodal conditions for theological belief structures and the hypothesis of extraterrestrials, as much as any pre-Copernican obstinance, a slack-jawed escapism with a foul play on an automobile accident for afterlife relief.  Talk about ambulance chasing...Shyamalan has chased them with this movie.Impoverishment of movie writing is no doubt linked to the double undercutting of resources available for any given film.  Overcompensation of iconic sensations, stars, are simply taken as a necessary budget cut because the public is apparently incapable of recognizing a movie otherwise, and secondarily, it panders to a Patrician Caste of performers whose confidence payoffs ensure the film will have a prominent market exposure in a monopolized industry--with its pets, and all that smell and mess.  Maintaining the public image of their regency is the first and foremost image to be captured by any film, it sends the public a message that Business as Usual INC. is at the helm, and that the project has its official nod.  Perhaps like icon Martha Stewart, we will one day delight beside the bargain discount clearnaces at K-Mart, signaling a turn in the tide of image manufacture, and pseudo sophistications (like Martha's) affected on the public through the making of idols and trademarked people who are the Icarus.  The effect is self reinforcing, we pay for the inflation of content, (its lack of value), in order to be mesmerized by the unintelligent lure of a larger than life personality.  The dreams of avarice replace the work of dreams.  Art suffers, personas wax more and more phony, pretty soon its all disgustingly preschool.If we continue to sit on our children's intellect, or our own, to dire anoxic strains of Hollywood, tv, and the news media, we will do the alien's work for them, and devolve to meek and subsentient chattel they can prey on...or at least the luxury lizards of premium compensations, who delude us, can prey on us.  The public no longer buys the premise that it is lucrative to insult our intelligence out of a nostalgia for the medium's now trademark mediocrity.  We know it is meant to condition ignorance through ""emotionally potent oversimplifications"" (""Keeping the Rabble In Line"", Noam Chomsky quoting Reinhold Niebur), understood as a genuine endorsement and not a title of dissent.  It is to condition a deferment to institutional ineptness, corruption, official ignorance, and a policy of incommunicado between the people and the stooges like a recorded phone message.  The film industry gluts itself on the natural opportunities for scavengers, in this ecology of fend for yourself duplicity.  The planet is a quarantine of scurrilous demise, a HAZMAP, a do not go zone-[primitive life form in terminal sequence--wait till the smoke clears and the bull$#!+ subsides].  Maybe that's what the crop circles really say.It is up to us you know.  And whatever they are, they are mere words of a sort.  They will not solve our problems for us, they would spare us, it would be easier so to die, no one to blame but ourselves in our demise.  Why lend a hopeless cause such useless resolution as peace and community?  We are invaded enough as is to the nth degree of murderous daylight robbery from all quarters for all necessities.  Who do these film industry douche-bags think they are with their Puppet show?  You can't call ENRON green aliens from space, no matter how hard you try, nor the ignored memos that 9-11 was about to happen...nor the Arabic translation the FBI quashed after its subverter's espionage recognized their `finest hour' had arrived.  It all seems like a far more diabolical plan the way we're playing it.  We may be a budding sentient species, but we know that `alien's from space' ruse like the pull my finger joke it is, and the joke's over.  The inhumanity of accustomed barbarisms mocks itself in a space invader guise to amuse the docile public who just keeps taking it in the teeth.  Then even Spielberg has to imitate Shyamalan with `War of the Worlds', Cruise is Gibson, Gibson is Cruise-we all saw that mask used in `Mission Impossible'.  Anti-intellectualism does mean deliberately running out of ideas and recycling the bourgeois household gimmicks from a ministry of formulaic, staple disinformation.The crop circle makers surely know the ecology of our pond, the bottom feeders who try and distract enlightenment, and the controllers who've lost all control and merely have their appearances and back pocket movie makers.  The emperors have no clothes on the crop circles phenomena, it would appear.  A media blackout on crop patterns would only validate them, so a political campaign fought over unspoken philosophic and religious precepts is given lip service out of the side of the mouth--unspoken, because intelligent discourse would only put ideas in people's heads...and we can't have that can we...  The thief isn't going to let on about competition he fears might take what he wants to steal, any part of it.  So by puppeting with it, he appears to only offer considerations-or threatening with the D.O.A. scenario.The myth of our  humanity, as a cooperative world, is all too clear to sentient surmise...and it is not the myths in these B-grade after-school specials. For substantive content on the crop circles, the reader is deferred to my review of CONTACT, the movie.",1,Good night shinola man.,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,6992,"['Must', 'endure', 'trad',

594827,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00005JL3T,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[3, 4]","M. Night Shyamalan (originally: Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan) can now be held responsible for creating one of the best movies I have ever seen.I loved every instant, of every second, of every minute of both hours of Sign's. Once I saw Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall's ""John Handcock"" in the opening credits I knew it was going to be special. (They also executive produced ""The Sixth Sense"" for Shyamalan) Not only was Sign's backed by these Spielbergian's, it was brought to us courtesy of Touchstone, Beuna Vista, and Disney - (Pretty much the Siamese Triplet's of the Production/distribution world) and the production was handled by Blinding Edge.Watching Sign's was like an imaginitive, well-crafted trip into a familiar land with a different vision. Concerning one of the major question's most people have about Sign's. Roger Ebert says it best, ""I'm not even going to tell you whether or not there are alien's in this movie...it doesn't matter."" And I agree one hundred percent. It absolutely doesn't matter. How much will you like sign's? Depend's on the size of your imagination my friends. In this film, its what you allow your mind to see that scares you. That's what makes it so special. After the 673 million dollar success of the Sixth Sense, he could have done anything he wanted. It could have very easily been War of the Worlds. (Which Spielberg will have completed soon). Sign's is about calmness, a serene portrait about one family on one little farm. And there it stays.Mel Gibson, who plays Episcopalian priest Graham Hess, must learn a hard lesson of faith, that there is a purpose for everything, and that there is a God. But does he learn this lesson? Or, do we get the infamous Shyamalan twist at the end, and the last thing that we expect happens? Guess you'll have to see. Just keep your eyes open. Shyamalan's writing style has grown to it's magnitude. He's gotten plenty of practice while writing Unbreakable, Stuart Little, The Sixth Sense, Wide Awake and Praying With Anger. One of his favorite directors is Hitchcock, who is probably doing giddy summersaults in his grave right now. You can bet Shyamalan is the Hitchcock of our time. He has lassoed: Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, Wide Awake, and Praying With Anger. (You can see his childhood works on the dvd's. A guilty pleasure he had to do.)Like hitchcock he likes to be on screen in his movies a bit. He can be seen in Unbreakable (Stadium Drug Dealer), The Sixth Sense (Dr.Hill), Praying With Anger (Dev Raman). (He also produced Unbreakable and Praying with anger.) It is recorded that Shyamalan's biggest fear, is being average. He is far above average in my book. Sign's is set in the quiet farming community (thus the crop circles) in Buck County, Pennsylvania. It a great setting that is rural enough to feel creepy and at the same time (with the family) a home that feels safe. I was so glad to see Joaquin Pheonix, who is currently my favorite actor. (River Pheonix's brother) (can be seen in Gladiator, and 8MM...thats Eight Millimeter, for the unknowing folks. And at his best in ""Quill's"". Also, he is astounding in Ladder 49, on dvd in March.) He has a heart felt, loving role as an uncle who cares for his family and is dealing with his past. An excellent choice as Mel's brother.There are two young stars that are for sure to have awesome futures, if they keep this trend up: Rory Culkin and Abby {Abbigail} Breslin. I only have one one word for these kids - WOW. Yes he is Macauley's Brother, and hopefully he will stick around longer. These kids are natural's.Sign's now lays to rest on DVD FOR anyone to own. The picture and sound qualities are near perfect, and the extra's are sufficient for the release. In its Theatrical run, Sign's knocked it out of the park with a 408 Million dollar run. I couldn't think of a more deserving film.After Thousands of movies, and seven years of reviewing, I have a favorite. ~SAOS~",5,My Favorite Film,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,3925,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'originally', 'Manoj', 'Nelliyattu', 'Shyamalan', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'creating', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.I', 'loved', 'instant', 'second', 'minute', 'hours', 'Sign', 'Once', 'saw', 'Kathleen', 'Kennedy', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'John', 'Handcock', 'opening', 'credits', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'special', 'also', 'executive', 'produced', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Shyamalan', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Sign', 'backed', 'Spielbergian', 'was', 'brought', 'courtesy', 'Touchstone', 'Beuna', 'Vista', 'Disney', 'Pretty', 'much', 'Siamese', 'Triplet', 'Production/distribution', 'world', 'production', 'was', 'handled', 'Blinding', 'Edge.Watching', 'Sign', 'was', 'imaginitive', 'well-crafted', 'trip', 'familiar', 'land', 'different', 'vision', 'Concerning', 'one', 'major', 'question', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'Sign', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'best', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'tell', 'not', 'are', 'alien', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'agree', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'absolutely', ""n't"", 'matter', 'How', 'much', 'will', 'sign', 'Depend', 'size', 'imagination', 'friends', 'film', 'what', 'allow', 'mind', 'see', 'what', 'so', 'special', '673', 'million', 'dollar', 'success', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Which', 'Spielberg', 'will', 'have', 'completed', 'soon', 'Sign', 'calmness', 'serene', 'portrait', 'one', 'family', 'one', 'little', 'farm', 'stays.Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'Episcopalian', 'priest', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'must', 'learn', 'hard', 'lesson', 'faith', 'purpose', 'everything', 'God', 'learn', 'lesson', 'do', 'get', 'infamous', 'Shyamalan', 'twist', 'end', 'last', 'thing', 'expect', 'happens', 'Guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'Just', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'Shyamalan', 'writing', 'style', 'grown', 'magnitude', 'gotten', 'plenty', 'practice', 'writing', 'Unbreakable', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Wide', 'Awake', 'Praying', 'Anger', 'One', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'probably', 'doing', 'giddy', 'summersaults', 'grave', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'bet', 'Shyamalan', 'Hitchcock', 'time', 'lassoed', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Wide', 'Awake', 'Praying', 'Anger', 'can', 'see', 'childhood', 'works', 'dvd', 'A', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'had', 'do', 'hitchcock', 'be', 'screen', 'movies', 'bit', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Unbreakable', 'Stadium', 'Drug', 'Dealer', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Dr.Hill', 'Praying', 'Anger', 'Dev', 'Raman', 'also', 'produced', 'Unbreakable', 'Praying', 'anger', 'recorded', 'Shyamalan', 'biggest', 'fear', 'being', 'average', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'book', 'Sign', 'set', 'quiet', 'farming', 'community', 'thus', 'crop', 'circles', 'Buck', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'great', 'setting', 'rural', 'enough', 'feel', 'creepy', 'same', 'time', 'family', 'home', 'safe', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'Joaquin', 'Pheonix', 'who', 'currently', 'favorite', 'actor', 'River', 'Pheonix', 'brother', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Gladiator', '8MM', 'thats', 'Eight', 'Millimeter', 'unknowing', 'folks', 'best', 'Quill', 'Also', 'astounding', 'Ladder', '49', 'dvd', 'March', 'heart', 'felt', 'loving', 'role', 'uncle', 'who', 'family', 'dealing', 'past', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Mel', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'are', 'sure', 'have', 'awesome', 'futures', 'keep', 'trend', 'up', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abby', 'Abbigail', 'Breslin', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'one', 'word', 'kids', 'WOW', 'Macauley', 'Brother', 'hopefully', 'will', 'stick', 'around', 'longer', 'kids', 'are', ""natural's.Sign"", 'now', 'rest', 'DVD', 'FOR', 'anyone', 'own', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'are', 'perfect', 'extra', 'are', 'sufficient', 'release', 'Theatrical', 'run', 'Sign', 'knocked', 'park', '408', 'Million', 'dollar', 'run', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'deserving', 'film.After', 'Thousands', 'movies', 'seven', 'years', 'reviewing', 'have', 'favorite', '~SAOS~']",Signs
594828,A2S166WSCFIFP5,B00005JL3T,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[1, 3]","I've got no trouble saying that Signs is one of the 20 best movies ever made. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite filmmakers  (I put The Sixth Sense in the top 50 movies). I've no doubt that as time goes on, he will be recognized as the next Hitchcock. Their styles are very familiar--both have tight control over their film, with as little takes and editing possible, and both allow the audience's imagination to do the work. Both treat the audience as an intelligent being, and not some mindless drone. We have a true talent with M. Night Shyamalan.What makes Signs so great isn't the cgi (which Night doesn't like to use). It's the human drama, the story of this family, their hurt, and how they mend. And it is a story of faith--having it and losing it. It doesn't matter so much what is going on outside of the farmhouse, whether it is world war 3, an alien invasion, or just a hard winter. The true story is how these four family members interact with each other. First their is Mel Gibson, who plays an ex-reverend who lost his faith when his wife died. Gibson puts forth one of the strongest performances I've seen him give. It may be his finest performance. Joaquim Phoenix definitely gives the best performance of his career, as Gibson's younger brother. He's both strong and vulnerable. Rory Caulkin plays Gibson's son, and this may be Night's true talent, finding child actors and bringing such strong performances from them. But it is Abigail Breslin, who plays Gibson's daughter, who steals the show. She's an adorable child, who gives her lines with such a deadpan grace and humor. You can bet the best scenes, and some of the best lines, are hers. Rounding out the cast is M. Night Shyamalan (who gives a strong performance) and Cherry Jones as Officer Paski. What makes the movie so great is the mood Night evokes. The entire movie feels tragic, sad--it feels like the entire movie has been tinted blue. But through the movie's sorrow, Night still brings humor and hope. It's an emotionally charged movie. Combine that with James Newton Howard's amazing score (based on a three note motiff, evocative of Psycho) that never overpowers the movie, but enhances it. And the movies sound effects and dialogue mix perfectly with the music. The two never fight each other, but work together to give the viewer one of the best movie going experiences.The Vista Series dvd is a great value. Shyamalan's dvds always contain the bare minimum, but you never feel cheated. In addition to a great movie, the Signs dvd gives you a few deleted scenes and another of Night's movies he made as a kid. This one, his first 'creature' movie. There's no commentary, but there is a six part making of featurette (here's the real value of the dvd). I've seen a lot of making of and behind the scenes documentaries and featurettes, but none of this quality. You don't need a commentary track with these featurettes. Part one covers the writing of the screenplay, two covers the building of the sets (including the corn), three is the longest (22 minutes) and is the 'making of' documentary, four covers the effects (which really only is the creature), five is last voices and deals with scoring the movie, and the final featurette, ""Full Circle"", Night covers the business aspects of filmmaking--the marketing.",5,Shyamalan is the next Hitchcock,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,3307,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'trouble', 'saying', 'Signs', 'one', '20', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'one', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'top', '50', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'next', 'Hitchcock', 'styles', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'have', 'tight', 'control', 'film', 'as', 'little', 'editing', 'possible', 'allow', 'audience', 'imagination', 'do', 'work', 'treat', 'audience', 'intelligent', 'being', 'not', 'mindless', 'drone', 'have', 'true', 'talent', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan.What', 'Signs', 'so', 'great', ""n't"", 'cgi', 'Night', ""n't"", 'like', 'use', 'human', 'drama', 'story', 'family', 'hurt', 'how', 'mend', 'story', 'faith', 'having', 'losing', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'farmhouse', 'world', 'war', '3', 'alien', 'invasion', 'just', 'hard', 'winter', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'four', 'family', 'members', 'interact', 'other', 'First', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'ex-reverend', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'when', 'wife', 'died', 'Gibson', 'forth', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'give', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'Joaquim', 'Phoenix', 'definitely', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Gibson', 'younger', 'brother', 'strong', 'vulnerable', 'Rory', 'Caulkin', 'Gibson', 'son', 'may', 'be', 'Night', 'true', 'talent', 'finding', 'child', 'actors', 'bringing', 'such', 'strong', 'performances', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'who', 'Gibson', 'daughter', 'who', 'show', 'adorable', 'child', 'who', 'lines', 'deadpan', 'grace', 'humor', 'can', 'bet', 'best', 'scenes', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'hers', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'strong', 'performance', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'Officer', 'Paski', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'mood', 'Night', 'evokes', 'entire', 'movie', 'feels', 'tragic', 'sad', 'entire', 'movie', 'been', 'tinted', 'blue', 'movie', 'sorrow', 'Night', 'still', 'humor', 'hope', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'movie', 'Combine', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'amazing', 'score', 'based', 'three', 'note', 'motiff', 'evocative', 'Psycho', 'never', 'movie', 'movies', 'sound', 'effects', 'dialogue', 'mix', 'perfectly', 'music', 'two', 'never', 'fight', 'other', 'work', 'together', 'give', 'viewer', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'going', 'experiences.The', 'Vista', 'Series', 'dvd', 'great', 'value', 'Shyamalan', 'dvds', 'always', 'contain', 'bare', 'minimum', 'never', 'feel', 'cheated', 'addition', 'great', 'movie', 'Signs', 'dvd', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Night', 'movies', 'made', 'kid', 'one', 'first', ""'creature"", 'movie', 'commentary', 'six', 'part', 'making', 'featurette', 'here', 'real', 'value', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'making', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'featurettes', 'none', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'commentary', 'track', 'featurettes', 'Part', 'one', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'two', 'building', 'sets', 'including', 'corn', 'three', 'longest', '22', 'minutes', ""'making"", 'documentary', 'four', 'effects', 'really', 'only', 'creature', 'five', 'last', 'voices', 'deals', 'scoring', 'movie', 'final', 'featurette', 'Full', 'Circle', 'Night', 'business', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'marketing']",Signs

Which will you be, hard to say, but that's oddly the whole point. Signs is open to interpretation, as either a masterpiece or a total flop, and the title SIGNS is about things we interpret. My wife sees signs everywhere, there's a rainbow and she tells me it is a good omen, it's her interpretation of what she sees.Mel Gibson plays a Preacher and Religious people interpret things as having a deeper and greaeter meaning.And that's what SIGNS is, a movie about four people and one in particular who interprets his reality in certain ways.When the media suggests aliens are arriving on Earth we barely see them, but our main characters interpret this as a terrifying invasion of War of the Worlds proportions. Ironically, it turns out the aliens are a pretty useless lot who can be defeated quite easily. At the same time as our four main characters are percieving a nightmare from outer space, we learn the Preacher has changed his belief system, he lost his faith when his wife was taken from him in a car accident. In the finale, the Preacher concocts a rather outrageous set of unlikely interpretations of events, and uses his wild beleifs to save his family from the aliens. It's quirky and oddball and done with a mix of tension and humor, but ultimately the movie SIGNS is about how people interpret reality and give meaning to it which may or may not be there. Does this movie mean something? Some say it's just a bad film. Others attribute deep meaning to it. I say that's what the director wanted, it's the same as the way we do or do not see signs in life, its our choice to see meaning in events. The Preacher decides to see meanings in all kinds of things at the end, at it's quite preposterous really, but however absurd his interpretations may be, his faith helps him. I think the film Signs is saying that faith in God, or seeing signs or any kind of faith, may seem nutty and irrational and a far fetched way of interpreting events, but faith in itself helps human beings to cope with problems and to survive. This is not what you expect, it is simply a little film about characters.Personally, I liked it, but that's because of how I interpreted it.

Its presentation is almost unparalleled; from the opening credits, we're swept away into a world of uncertainty and dreaded expectation.  The opening credit sequence is simple, but extremely powerful, with towering words and booming music.  My heart jumped into my throat and stayed there through much of the rest of the film.  Shymalan is extremely talented in creating atmosphere; the thrills and chills are exquisitely choreographed.The performances are pretty solid, too.  Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are terrific as Mel Gibson's young children, and Cherry Jones is wonderful, as always.  Gibson is very evocative as a grieving widower, but at times I felt he was drowning in spiritually-conflicted pathos.  Similarly, I enjoyed aspects of Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Gibson's younger brother, but there was some scenery chewing evident.In addition, the climax of the film left me cold.  After a devastatingly chilling lead-up, I felt deflated.

Very different from other hits this summer, in it's second week receiving over $110 million at the US box-office, ""Signs"" is a must-see. The movie doesn't bore you to sleep with too many details. It concentrates on the horror theme. It may not be the sixth sense but it's still great! The movie is very interesting and quite emotional. It definitely has the gripping suspense and the fearful moments that have made us enjoy horror flicks. It's yet another film by Shyamalan that'll make you consider similar things for quite a while.The Hess family- a modern everyday family with happy times all the time!- NOT! Problems are taking place with the Hess family-strange problems. The story revolves around graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson) and his brother Merrill who awaken to find their dogs barking fiercely. The kids (brother-sister) are wandering around in the cornfields as if under somebody's commander as if they're zombies. If that wasn't strange enough, crop circles are spotted. The TV industry is going wild, and graham tries his best to ignore it all. He reads about aliens (no! It's not an alien movie). The plot shows Graham trying to get things back to normal.Shyamalan once again shows that he's great at making horror flicks. He's prepared yet another brilliant film that you'll have to see this summer. It's a reality problems show and a horror hour show. It's mystical and thought provoking. The cast did a great job. The plot was enthralling. It deserves raving reviews. It has it's share of humour. It's a great modern thriller.

Night does provide some insightful extras, but these are not adequate, in my opinion.Night's last 2 films suit my tastes.  I know not everybody is going to love his films because they are slow, sparse, deliberate, and character-driven.  Many people will be bored senseless by the goings-on of one family on a farm waiting out an alien invasion.I personally love Night's revelatory style, and I love how he involves the audience by allowing them clues as to what direction the movie will take, if only the audience will play along with him.  I love his ability to inject reality into his films that make them so resonant.-""I can't hear my children.""--Graham-""Don't ever say anything like that again.""--Merrill, scolding his nephew-Graham startling awake as his daughter stares down at him in bed.-Merrill falling out of bed when he hears his niece screaming outside.I could personally relate to every one of these instances, and they showed that Shyamalan knows what it means to be part of a family.  Night's attention to detail is evident through Mel's restraint when he deals with his athsmatic son.  His son is involved in a few situations that would send most kids into crying fits and most parents into fits of worry.  However, Graham and his child have developed a resolute calmness because overexertion could trigger a tortuous attack of asthma in the young boy.I don't think the movie was full of holes.  If you listen to every line and really understand the charcters, it makes sense.  If you just casually observe EVENTS and the most obvious details, the finer points, of course, will be lost.  Nobody seems to be allowing for the possibility that not only were the aliens hostile, but they were also arrogant.I was literally squirming in my seat by the end of this movie, and it was so compelling that even my 5 year-old daughter was riveted to the TV screen.Signs in a few words is:Compelling.  Intimate.  Revelatory.  Coherent.  Intense.  Delicate.  Deliberate.  Playful.  Personal.

594839,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005JL3T,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[2, 4]","Thought provoking and multi-layered, this ""the aliens are coming"" film goes way beyond its genre, and though it can be heart-thumping scary, it's also balanced with humor, as well as being full of symbolic meaning, and very moving in parts.The story centers on Reverend Graham Hess, who battles his inner demons as he prepares to confront the alien invaders; haunted by his wife's tragic death which made him question and negate his faith, he is left with two small children to figure out the meaning of life, and consider if ""it is possible that there are no coincidences"".Woven throughout the film are flashbacks of his wife's accident, so we get to know this man, in his stages of grief, courage, and reconciliation; Mel Gibson's performance is superb as Hess, with a great depth of emotion, and the others in this small cast are excellent, which includes writer/director Shyamalan and Joaquin Phoenix as Hess' brother. The children, Rory Culkin (from the large Culkin clan that includes aunt Bonnie Bedelia), and Abigail Bresslin, a truly angelic little girl, are both fantastic and enormously appealing. Also good are Cherry Jones as Officer Paski, and Merrit Weaver as a penitent pharmacist.The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is vibrant, and James Newton Howard's score is one of his best. This brilliantly constructed film is my favorite of Shyamalan's work, and it's one that should be seen at least twice to appreciate, as there is much more to it than meets the eye at first viewing, and it has something that is rare in films, a simple, meaningful, and perfect ending.Total running time is 106 minutes.The DVD ""extras"" include a ""making of"" documentary that is extremely interesting, and should not be missed, with Shyamalan explaining his meticulous way of working, from the seeds of the idea to the scoring of the film, a process that I find fascinating.",5,an introspective creature feature,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,1867,"['Thought', 'provoking', 'multi-layered', 'aliens', 'are', 'coming', 'film', 'way', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'heart-thumping', 'scary', 'also', 'balanced', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'full', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'very', 'moving', 'parts.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Reverend', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'who', 'inner', 'demons', 'confront', 'alien', 'invaders', 'haunted', 'wife', 'tragic', 'death', 'made', 'question', 'negate', 'faith', 'left', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'figure', 'out', 'meaning', 'life', 'consider', 'possible', 'are', 'coincidences', '.Woven', 'film', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'wife', 'accident', 'get', 'know', 'man', 'stages', 'grief', 'courage', 'reconciliation', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'superb', 'Hess', 'great', 'depth', 'emotion', 'others', 'small', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'writer/director', 'Shyamalan', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Hess', 'brother', 'children', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'large', 'Culkin', 'clan', 'aunt', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Abigail', 'Bresslin', 'truly', 'angelic', 'little', 'girl', 'are', 'fantastic', 'enormously', 'appealing', 'Also', 'good', 'are', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'Officer', 'Paski', 'Merrit', 'Weaver', 'penitent', 'pharmacist.The', 'cinematography', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'vibrant', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'film', 'favorite', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'twice', 'appreciate', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'first', 'viewing', 'something', 'rare', 'films', 'simple', 'meaningful', 'perfect', 'ending.Total', 'running', 'time', '106', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'making', 'documentary', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Shyamalan', 'explaining', 'meticulous', 'way', 'working', 'seeds', 'idea', 'scoring', 'film', 'process', 'find', 'fascinating']",Signs

Night Shyamalan's (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable)  Signs is an atypical invaders-from-space movie that emphasizes character and thematic development over the all-too-familiar big-budget special effects extravaganza a la Independence Day.Instead of using huge set-piece battles with flying saucers, ray guns, and the cool-but-ineffective Earthlings' conventional forces, Shyamalan goes for the less obvious yet more chilling technique of focusing on the extraterrestrials' insidious moves and their effects on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family.The overall feel of Signs, which is confined to the Hess farm and a small nearby town just outside Philadelphia, is that of an above-average Stephen King adaptation.  As in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan places ordinary people (in this case, a small family of four) in an extraordinary situation, beginning with reverend-turned-corn-farmer Hess' discovery of crop circles in his fields.  At first convinced that it's all a big hoax pulled off by the local miscreants, Hess and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) witness very disturbing events on and around the farm, most of them centering on Graham's two young children.To write more about this incredibly effective film would be criminal, especially to those reading this review who have not yet seen Signs.

Coincidences. Tragedies and miracles. The miracle is that in life grace can come from terrible events as often as from wonderful things. I don't want to give away too much of the story but essentially it's about one family's fear and confusion while the rest of the world confronts something extraordinary and sinister. It's beautifully set up, leisurely paced. I didn't want it to end, and I didn't want to leave the theater. The farm and family felt like my in-laws, the house is not unlike mine. It's familiar and comforting. (Well, except that I have the same attic door, and the same coal chute and the same junk in the basement...not so comforting!) The outside world is kept at bay. The threat is not shown until the end, but that also means no glib analysis is forthcoming, no method of coping with it ready to hand.

You know how toy commercials show you what a full toy set can do with the action figures, the vehicles they can ride in, the places they hide or work in.  That's what this film is like.  Take Mel Gibson's role as a pastor who's left the church and lost his faith when his wife dies in a horrible car accident.  He's an action figure you can purchase in a set that also comes with a son (Rory Culkin), daughter (Abigail Breslin), and brother(Joaquin Phoenix).  The aliens are extra and are like the vehicle that is sold separately.  You don't need the aliens to enjoy the figurines.  That's what this movie is like.  At the core, and forgive me if this sounds cheesy but, this film is about finding faith.  It's cliche, and I'll tell you what worked and didn't work.The actors all did a wonderful job in their roles, but it's the story itself that is suspect.  I believe this story would've been just as effective had the writer thrown in a hurricane or some other natural disaster in place of the aliens.  I mean, think about it.  You have a guy who loses his faith, and at one of the critical moments in the film where he's locked away in a basement with his family, he pleads to god for his son's life and subsequently regains his faith.  Personally, I think the aliens were tossed in to generate intrigue for the film, as well as to tap in the X-File fans.  But when all is said and done, the aliens weren't that crucial to begin with when you consider what the writer used as the alien's kryptonite.  ""High quality H2O"" in the words of Adam Sandler in the Waterboy.  They were completely dispensible, and easily at that.  They left in a hurry and that was the end of the story.  Geez, put a little more thought into it, will ya?On a brigher note, I think the director did a great job of building suspense and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats at key moments.  He also got the dry, subtle humor down.  But for most of the film, it was slow and kind of boring (even according to a guy who loved the film).

594853,A26GKRY72ROT25,B00005JL3T,"Amazon Customer ""HomeTheaterGuy""","[1, 1]","I have to say that I sometimes wonder if I'm some how intellectually inferior to these ""so called"" film critics. Or, maybe my pallet is used to bologna and theirs to caviar. Maybe they are just so desensitized these days that, short of a cinematic masterpiece that's also up for a Pulitzer prize, nothing phases them anymore.... They're almost numb. I thought this movie is an ""A"" movie not a sensational ""B"" movie as its being touted by these critics (I do give it 4 stars though). M. Night Shyamalans' 3rd movie is one that takes us back to the older movies that rely on scaring you with the unknown; the door that ""creeks"" as it's being opened and the dark rooms that scared us so much as children. Not exploding heads or someone being shot up to a million pieces right before our eyes. He also does a nice job of injecting that ""nervous humor"" from the adults and innocent humor from the children.This is about the challenges of faith and the strength of a parents love disguised as an alien invasion movie. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a farmer and former minister, that lives in rural Pennsylvania with his two young children, Morgan (Rory Culkin, Macaulay's brother), who has Asthma, and Bo (Abigail Breslin) who is absolutely adorable and, in my opinion, the next great child actor. Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), who's Graham's brother and one time minor league baseball player, has moved in after the death of Graham's wife six months prior when she was hit by a car. This incident has caused Graham to loose his faith and quit his congregation. Then, sudden appearances of crop circles in his cornfield, which at first is shrugged off as local pranksters, but the over night sightings all over the world challenges Graham and the rest of the world to re-evaluate our belief system. The chemistry between Gibson and Phoenix is very natural and convincing. In fact, this movie was cast extremely well! The movie, at times, can get a little heavy handed with the Fatherly love message but it doesn't ""muck up"" the movie to the point where you loose interest in the story. Shyamalan gives this movie the same feel that the old Twilight Zone episodes used to have, where you are left with anticipation and your imagination. The 4 stars instead of 5 stems from the fact that he could have punctuated 1 or 2 of the scenes a little with some visuals, instead of lying back like he did. That being said, this is the newest movie to enter my top 10 list of favorites. I can live with the few scenes that were too ""light""! As for the Home Theater experience, since the movie is more suspense than action/horror, there isn't much going on that will use the sub(s) or work the surrounds too much.

594860,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JL3T,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","Walking into `Signs', I had high expectations.  I consider `The Sixth Sense' to be near perfection, and `Unbreakable', while flawed, was truly inspired in both conception and direction.  I really anticipated another memorable night with Mr. Shyamalan.  Instead, what I encountered was a huge disappointment.  `Signs', while visually stunning at times, lacks nearly everything that made his previous efforts so remarkable.There was almost no tension, and there was no real cohesion.Aliens have been the topic of many horror films, with varying results.  Some films truly capture the dread that comes with the unknown, while others fail to capitalize on that human curiosity.  For me, `Signs' falls very short of its own promise by delivering a film that moves at a snails pace, setting up a conclusion that serves up mild amounts of paranoia.  Shyamalan also seems to have turned his brain off for this film, for the conclusions he asks the audience to draw from this are simply improbable and kind of, well, stupid.This is far better than `Lady in the Water', but that isn't say much since that film is beyond abysmal.`Signs' revolves around a close-knit family who discover crop circles that begin to make a serious impact on their lives.  You have Rev. Graham Hess, who is a widower and is suffering from a lack of faith (or at least a bout with it).  His brother Merrill lives with him on his isolated farm and works hard to keep what's left of his family together.  Together they raise Morgan and Bo, Graham's two children.  As the crop circles begin to pop up all over the world, Graham and Merrill start to contemplate what this all means for them, and for everyone else.Is there anything they can do to prevent what is bound to happen?The climactic scene in the cellar is chilling to a degree, but it lacks the visceral punch that one got when watching Shyamalan's previous films.  There was a layered and harrowing atmosphere created in both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' that is not present in `Signs'.  I know that some (maybe many) will disagree with me, but I just didn't find this film as gripping nor as suspenseful as so many claimed it to be.  I found the way in which Shyamalan connected the dots within his own story to be rather sporadic and disjointed and the eventualities weighed down any of the tension with their ridiculous nature.  I really admired Shyamalan in the beginning, for having an imagination he continually insisted on challenging in order to create something fresh and exciting, but he has continued to go so far out in left field that his ideas become tainted with preposterousness.It's like he forgot how to make a movie.The performances in `Signs' are all good.  Not a sour grape in the bunch, to be honest.  I am not almost convinced of Mel Gibson's talent, but he pulls out a very nuanced performance here (something that helps elevate the film in times of serious need).  Phoenix is an actor who I at one time adored but have grown somewhat cold on.  This is a minor effort for him, but it works.  Abigail Breslin (whose character arc is infuriating) and Rory Culkin (possibly the most talented of the Culkin clan) put out good performances here, doing their best to combat the script handed to them.As a director (at least in his earlier days) Shyamalan shines.  Even here he manages to deliver sequences that are visually captivating, and that style alone leads to sharp edits and sharper chills.  As a screenwriter he has diminished, and his ideas deter us from his directory flare.This should have been so much better.",2,"I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes...",1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,3571,"['Walking', 'Signs', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'consider', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'be', 'near', 'perfection', 'Unbreakable', 'flawed', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'conception', 'direction', 'really', 'anticipated', 'memorable', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'Instead', 'what', 'encountered', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Signs', 'visually', 'stunning', 'times', 'nearly', 'everything', 'made', 'previous', 'efforts', 'so', 'remarkable.There', 'was', 'almost', 'tension', 'was', 'real', 'cohesion.Aliens', 'have', 'been', 'topic', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'varying', 'results', 'films', 'truly', 'capture', 'dread', 'unknown', 'others', 'fail', 'capitalize', 'human', 'curiosity', 'Signs', 'very', 'short', 'own', 'promise', 'delivering', 'film', 'snails', 'pace', 'setting', 'up', 'conclusion', 'up', 'mild', 'amounts', 'paranoia', 'Shyamalan', 'also', 'have', 'turned', 'brain', 'film', 'conclusions', 'audience', 'draw', 'are', 'simply', 'improbable', 'kind', 'well', 'stupid.This', 'far', 'better', 'Lady', 'Water', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'film', 'abysmal.', 'Signs', 'revolves', 'close-knit', 'family', 'who', 'discover', 'crop', 'circles', 'begin', 'make', 'serious', 'impact', 'lives', 'have', 'Rev', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'who', 'widower', 'suffering', 'lack', 'faith', 'least', 'bout', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'isolated', 'farm', 'hard', 'keep', 'what', 'left', 'family', 'together', 'Together', 'raise', 'Morgan', 'Bo', 'Graham', 'two', 'children', 'crop', 'begin', 'pop', 'up', 'world', 'Graham', 'Merrill', 'start', 'contemplate', 'what', 'everyone', 'else.Is', 'there', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'prevent', 'what', 'bound', 'happen', 'climactic', 'scene', 'cellar', 'chilling', 'degree', 'visceral', 'punch', 'one', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'layered', 'harrowing', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'not', 'present', 'Signs', 'know', 'maybe', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'gripping', 'as', 'suspenseful', 'so', 'many', 'claimed', 'be', 'found', 'way', 'Shyamalan', 'connected', 'dots', 'own', 'story', 'be', 'rather', 'sporadic', 'disjointed', 'eventualities', 'weighed', 'tension', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'really', 'admired', 'Shyamalan', 'beginning', 'having', 'imagination', 'continually', 'insisted', 'challenging', 'order', 'create', 'something', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'continued', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'ideas', 'become', 'tainted', 'preposterousness.It', 'forgot', 'how', 'make', 'movie.The', 'performances', 'Signs', 'are', 'good', 'Not', 'sour', 'grape', 'bunch', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'not', 'almost', 'convinced', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'talent', 'out', 'very', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'here', 'something', 'elevate', 'film', 'times', 'serious', 'need', 'Phoenix', 'actor', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'adored', 'have', 'grown', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'minor', 'effort', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'character', 'arc', 'infuriating', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'possibly', 'most', 'talented', 'Culkin', 'clan', 'put', 'out', 'good', 'performances', 'here', 'doing', 'best', 'combat', 'script', 'handed', 'them.As', 'director', 'least', 'earlier', 'days', 'Shyamalan', 'shines', 'Even', 'here', 'deliver', 'sequences', 'are', 'visually', 'captivating', 'style', 'alone', 'sharp', 'edits', 'sharper', 'chills', 'screenwriter', 'diminished', 'ideas', 'deter', 'directory', 'flare.This', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Signs

594866,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005JL3T,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","In this reviewer's opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS (2002) is his very best film.With Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and the director himself, as a guilt-ridden man who fell asleep behind the wheel and caused an accident that has caused Reverend Graham Hess (Gibson) to lose much more than his faith in the Almighty.Graham can no longer function as a minister, and now believes hiimself an atheist. He hasn't any qualms about cursing a God that would allow such tragedy to occur.Phoenix, as Merrill Hess, Graham's younger brother, is a failed minor league baseball player. His weakness was swinging at bad pitches and striking out too much. But when Merrill connected... that pill flew a mile!On a lazy late summer day in rural Pennsylvania, eerie things start occurring on the Hess farm: a family dog goes violently mad, crop circles appear in the corn field, and seemingly invisible late night prowlers make their ghostly presence known. The TV and radio are flooded with similar reports. We soon learn that these night creatures are hostlie extraterrestrials. A full scale invasion of Earth (a la ""The War of the Worlds"") is on, and the Hess family (and their neighbors) will soon be under siege.Besides being an excellent story with superior cinematography, this M. Night-mare's brilliant orchestration (by James Newton Howard) adds to the terror.Kudos to casting director Douglas Aibel for pairing Gibson and Phoenix. They truly look like brothers and have great on-screen rapport.",5,"""There's a monster outside my room, can I have a glass of water?""",1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1530,"['reviewer', 'opinion', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'SIGNS', '2002', 'very', 'best', 'film.With', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'director', 'guilt-ridden', 'man', 'who', 'fell', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'caused', 'accident', 'caused', 'Reverend', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Gibson', 'lose', 'much', 'more', 'faith', 'Almighty.Graham', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'function', 'minister', 'now', 'atheist', ""n't"", 'qualms', 'cursing', 'God', 'would', 'allow', 'such', 'tragedy', 'occur.Phoenix', 'Merrill', 'Hess', 'Graham', 'younger', 'brother', 'failed', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'weakness', 'was', 'swinging', 'bad', 'pitches', 'striking', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'Merrill', 'connected', 'pill', 'flew', 'mile', 'lazy', 'late', 'summer', 'day', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'eerie', 'things', 'start', 'occurring', 'Hess', 'farm', 'family', 'dog', 'violently', 'mad', 'crop', 'circles', 'appear', 'corn', 'field', 'seemingly', 'invisible', 'late', 'night', 'prowlers', 'make', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'known', 'TV', 'radio', 'are', 'flooded', 'similar', 'reports', 'soon', 'learn', 'night', 'creatures', 'are', 'hostlie', 'extraterrestrials', 'full', 'scale', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'la', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Hess', 'family', 'neighbors', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'siege.Besides', 'being', 'excellent', 'story', 'superior', 'cinematography', 'M.', 'Night-mare', 'brilliant', 'orchestration', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'terror.Kudos', 'casting', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Aibel', 'pairing', 'Gibson', 'Phoenix', 'truly', 'look', 'brothers', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'rapport']",Signs

It's not even the type you can enjoy mocking, it's just plain bad. And to everyone who says ""You just don't get the message!""... believe me, I got it. Everyone who has been forced to watch this movie got it. The message is every bit as dull and predictable as the movie itself.Every time the story even starts to get going, something so freaking stupid it makes my very brain ache happens. Have a touching moment about God vs Chance... follow it up with a story about a girl puking on herself. Yep, that's good cinema.We have a family who are so dumb it's sad. No TV, it's evil. Don't ever talk to the girl who swears again, she's evil. Don't ever talk to any people from out of town, they're evil. Don't ever call anyone by anything but their full name, it's evil. Don't prey, it's evil... or something, he doesn't know. Got it? No? Cry about it now, because every 35 minutes there's gotta be a crying scene.Now we get to the aliens. Not only are they absolutely the worst aliens I've seen in ages, they're the stupidest as well. They can't break down a freaking wooden door or boards.  Give me a break... these absolute cosmic rejects would be destroyed in mere minutes.This movie is so very flawed it's hard to find the right words to describe it.

594869,A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,B00005JL3T,"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col...","[4, 7]","Back when Alfred Hitchcock was alive and making his first few films, I wonder if people really understood what a visionary filmmaker they had on their hands? I trust that only hindsight has brought an accurate assessment of the talent and skill posessed by the brillian filmmaker as well as the immense contribution he's made the the industry as a whole. M. Night Shyamalan is the only filmmaker in recent times that will be looked back upon from the future with a similar perspective.Signs is the fifth movie by the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, though few people have ever heard (much less seen) his first two. Most people erroneously believe The Sixth Sense to be his first film, but I say they are partly right. With the Sixth Sense, Night was reborn as a film maker, not in terms of success but in his understanding of how to make films. It was as if the first two films were just learning experiences; practice runs. After all, who considers a director's student films when looking back at their work?One of the amazing things about Night's work is his skillful use of symbolism and metaphor. It brings a very poetic feel to his storytelling lacking in just about every hollywood film out there. Even more amazing is his use of distractions and double meanings to tell you a story that you don't even realize your being told till the end. He's like a great stage magician; the wonderment is in what you don't see, even though it's right in front of your face.The problem with Night is that he is too good at what he does (and perhaps typical audience member's brain is too atrophied due to the constant deluge of brainless hollywood ... thrown on the screen to understand). I see people condemning Signs for being a poor example of an alien invasion movie, or about alleged flaws in the aliens' design, behavior, motivations, etc.. Unfortunately people like this are why brainless, big-budget garbage like Independence Day (ID4) makes more money. Just because the movie poster has a picture of a crop circle with the word signs right above it does not mean that's what the movie is about; not with M. Night Shyamalan it doesn't.Like The Sixth Sense, Signs points out early on what the film is about, yet people unbelievably fail to get it. Signs is no more about aliens than The Sixth Sense was about a kid who could ghosts or than Titanic is about a sinking ship. The main character is a priest who has lost his faith. The signs he is meant to see are not the ones in his corn crop, but like the audience, that is all he can see. Night masterfully keeps you focused on something else while he weaves his magic. The real signs are only finally understood when the characters understand them giving you a profound connection to them and the story. Award worthy performances seal the deal, making Signs a worthy addition to Night's three films.If you've already seen the film, you really didn't need to read the preceeding words. But perhaps you are wondering whether or not to get the DVD. I was excited to hear that Signs (like Unbreakable) was being released directly as a Vista Series release. Vista Series releases are known for their slick deluxe packaging, extra discs, loads of extra features, and superb audio and video formats. If you've seen the Vista Series versions of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Tombstone, etc. then you understand what I am talking about. Signs has ""Vista Series"" stamped on the cover, but missing is just about everything you've come to expect. The DVD is one disc in a plain ole plastic case, and while it does have some nice extra features there are even less then the non-Vista Series release of The Sixth Sense. Basic extras that you've come to expect such as trailers, cast/crew bios, etc are non-existent. There is a nice little behind the scenes documentary. In it we hear about Night's insistance that the film be marketed in certain ways and small clips of the trailers are shown for examples. This only makes me want the trailers included on the disc even more. Leaving them off a premier edition disc is simply inexcusable. There are some deleted scenes, but they are still rough and unfinished and are devoid Night's standard commentary explaining why they were cut. Speaking of commentary, there isn't ANY at all anywhere even for the film itself. The disc only has one english audio format; Dolby 5.1. No choice for DTS or even 2-Channel Surround for those without decked out home theatre systems.This DVD is not worthy of the Vista Series label. It is a direct deceit to those who have come to expect quality from the label. What's worse is that I smell executive gold digging attempting to extort more money from faithful fans with the release of a more deluxe version in the future. This would be the biggest sin. Executives have already got people to buy The Sixth Sense again by releasing the awesome Vista Series version. Now with Signs we get had again, or we get stuck with a shoddy, skimpy DVD release of a great film.",4,The people that don't like it are the ones that don't get it,1042329600,"01 12,

Night Shyamalan would forge ahead with another film, this time starring Mel Gibson and a plot revolving around an alien invasion.  Mr. Shyamalan also threw in one's test of faith, as Gibson must confront his own faith (he used to be a minister) and how he deals with this invasion.  What could've been intriguing story (which it does interesting at face value) is muddled and often silly throughout the film.A shame, because Mr. Shyamalan is a superb director.  By watching this film, however, you wouldn't agree with that statement.  Sure, it has atmosphere, but that's about it.  The story is filled with loopholes and silly plot points that could house many elephants.I tried SO HARD to like this film, really.  But after the first twenty minutes, you know it's over.  The aliens themselves are ridiculous and seem to have no reason for jumping on people's homes late at night/early in the morning or for invading the earth to begin with!  What's more, their hind legs can kick them ten feet in the air, but can they logically kick a wooden pantry door down? EH!  Nope.  Also, the aliens are weak to water, yet the earth is over 70% comprised of water and it's EVEN IN OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE.  Somehow, they're able to walk around without the protection of space suits.  In fact, the climax isn't that great at all; somehow his dead wife's last words (&quot;Swing Away, Merril&quot;) had to do with the invasion and that gave Joaquin, a former league baseball player, the initiative to SWING AWAY at the alien!  WOW!  GREAT plot device... NOT.  Where's the logic in this??  Wait, &quot;nevermind rational explanation... they're ALIENS&quot; (credit: maddox.xmission.com).Mel Gibson is superb in this and so is Joaquin Pheonix as his brother, but the rest of the cast is rather lackluster.  Rory Culkin is ANNOYING throughout the whole damn film, especially with his emotionless babbling about invasion (oh yeah, they figured out it was an invasion after reading an old sci-fi book... don't ask).Most importantly, it fails to actually scare or thought-provoke me.  The only intense scene was when Gibson's yelling at his family at the dinner table because he didn't want to pray.  Yes, there were no aliens involved.Overall, this is such a WASTED chance.  Not many films actually utilize God into a story and here's where I appreciated it (the fact that God is primarily involved in how things happen, etc.).  Unfortunately, the film is such a dud and even worse because of Mr. Shyamalan's talents; he could've made this better, really.

A lot.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was a priest (presumably Episcopalian) until his wife Colleen was killed in a rather absurd accident. She had been walking by the side of the road when neighbor Ray Reddy (played by Shyamalan) lost control of his truck and pinned her, nearly cutting her body in half. She survived long enough to talk to her husband for a couple of minutes after he was summoned to the scene by the local police.Then Hess quit the church and concentrated on raising his two adorable children, the older boy Morgan (maybe six or seven) and the little girl Bo (maybe three or four). They lived on a farm and grew corn, and Hess's brother Merrill returned home to help him.But one morning they find that their corn fields have been sculpted into what are known as crop circles, but which was actually a fairly elaborate design of several circles of different sizes with other details to the configuration. Naturally, the brothers Hess assume it is the work of pranksters. Before long, however, evidence mounts that there was more to it than a high school prank. A lot more.The story is as much about the relations of the two brothers, the children, and the pain Graham Hess suffered that caused him to curse God and leave the church. I will not attempt to describe all of that, except to say that it is a good story which is decidedly not predictable. Yes, some elements are relatively conventional in science fiction movies, but much is decidedly original.

594875,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JL3T,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 4]","I can't remember any movie dealing with this subject matter that was this effective, or human, since ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" in 1977. That is the movie that this one will most likely be compared too. Deservedly so. What writer/director/ M. Night Shyamalan has done here is concot a real story that isn't razzle dazzle, flashy, summer invasion epic like ""Men In Black"" or ""Independence Day"", but a film that deals with a remarkable matter in a very realistic, human way. I've said 'human' twice now because that's what it is. It's not a far fetched super hero or invincible people battling aliens or doing something fantasy driven. The people here could be you or me. It is an honest look at what we ourselves would do, say, or act, if this was really happening to us. It is done here in a real way. The movie follows former preacher turned farmer Graham Hess(who is played superbly by Mel Gibson), and his two kids Morgan(Rory Culkin, Macaulay's little brother), and Bo(the unbelievebaly adorable and sweet Abigail Breslin). His little brother Merill(Joaquin Phoenix), a former baseball player, also lives with them. One typical morning, the family is awakened to strange designs in their crop fields. Crop circles. It is believed at first to be a hoax, naturally, but our family soon learns that weird things have been going on. This is no hoax. Something serious and dangerous is coming. Something is about to happen. But what?. They, nor we, don't know for sure. That's part of the fun. We don't know exactly how it'll come to an end. How it will climax. What could possibly happen?. This is a movie that would much rather creep you out with what is implied and not seen, than actually seen. It works so incredibly well. What little is seen here and there, is executed in a very scary manner. As I always say, less is better. Shyamalan knows how to use his scares in an effective way. He doesn't cram it down our throats or cheat. He lets it build and build until something is about to happen. That is his style. Slow camera angles and parts that go on a bit until the big jump. It is so good how he does it. He is a master who is only getting better. The movie is also surprisingly funny too. The humor here is not tacked on humor just to throw a little in. The humor comes from these people in a natural manner. It comes from the situations these people are in and how they react to it. Very funny. Like in his previous two films, he appears in this as well. His cameo here is much bigger and important. The cast is really good. This is easily Mel Gibson's best work in a long time. Maybe his very best in fact. He is a man who has lost his way thru a horrible accident and no longer has faith in himself. Trying to cope with his family and his loss is hard, and he fleshes that out in his character. He makes Graham Hess a real person. He is great. Joaquin Phoenix is real too. He also gets some of the best lines. The kids. M. Night knows his kid actors. You can always expect any kid in his films to be good. These two are good. The little girl is the cutest thing in the world. You'll want to take her home. Culkin is solid and watchable. How many Culkins are there?. That's about it. Not a large cast. Cherry Jones as the sheriff is the only other one. The ending might satisfy everyone. I'm fine with it myself, although a little more meat to it would've been very appreciated. It's clear what the ending was doing and trying to be, but not everyone will be up for it. There's a religion arc running thru it that won't win over any non religious people. I'm not gonna say anymore on that subject. I can only imagine the people who whine about the film do so only because they can't sustain a movie for a long amount of time that doesn't spray some kind of eye candy across their face. If you are up for an interesting and fun ride, then pass by the ones that complain the movie is slow and doesn't show enough. If it showed everything, it would've ruined the movie. These people don't know these kinds of things. In the end, this is the kind of movie that takes you on an incredible journey and stays with you. This is just like early Steven Spielberg. It is magical and memorable. My favorite film so far this year. I don't think that will change.

All the reviews I see just from the first click to the page were 2 stars?!?  People trying to compare this to The Sixth Sense?  What?  This movie hit all it's marks in getting you scared when you're supposed to be, even throws in a little chuckle moment, but in no way did I feel this to be a B-movie.M. Night has pretty much made up for his short comings in Unbreakable.  Which if anything, Unbreakable should have been the Sixth Sense comparison.  It was a soft movie and didn't give a very intense conclusion.  Signs on the other hand did very well in giving a sense of fear and making you ask the question throughout the movie ""Is this just some pranks, or is it real?""Mel Gibson did a nice job playing a naive ex-clergyman.  Just have to chuckle at the townspeople still seeing him as a man of the cloth when he prefers not to do anything related.  Swearing?  Oops!  Listening to a confession of an upset girl, but yet tells his family, ""I just want you to stay away from her.""  A bit of logistics that probably flew by, but could be explained.Then there's this back story that you get introduced to about what happened to his wife that made him loose faith in being a clergyman.  A clansman of the Culkin clan,little brother to Macaulay who plays his son with asthesma, daughter who drinks a sip of water from a glass, then leaves the glass someplace to get another drink of water, only to leave the glass where others are.  Joaquin Phoenix plays the brother, who at times is comic relief himself, has his own past to deal with.In all, the movie played out well, I think M. Night did it again in hitting all the marks of making a movie entertaining, scary, fun, silly, and moving.  There's only going to be one Sixth Sense.  Signs is the next one in line that there can't be anything as powerful as it brings to the audience.  There's no doubt about it, this movie rocks.  I saw it at the first showing, 11:30am.

594879,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JL3T,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","I admit I was entirely wrong when I originally outright dismissed this movie when it first came out.  I was apparently holding a grudge at the time because of my *strong* dislike for the Sixth Sense.  Completely different movies, so my initial reaction upon watching Signs was totally unfair, and for that I feel the need to apologize.  I'm sorry!I guess back then I was expecting Signs to be an all-out alien invading film that involves the mysterious space creatures constantly finding terrifying ways to torture the people on Earth.  Instead, the storyline is much slower paced, allowing more time to build suspense, and allowing more time to slowly unravel what the aliens look like and what their intentions are.  Sorry, I didn't realize this back when the movie first came out.What's even more mysterious about my dislike for Signs back in the day is that I usually LOVE small town, family-oriented films.  I don't know what I was thinking back then to be honest, I really don't.It's also entirely possible I just didn't get M. Night Shyamalan's style.  After all, let's be completely honest here- his style was quite revolutionary when it first came out.  I mean, this isn't your ordinary horror film.  Some may love his style, others may not, but the one thing that can't be denied is that his style is certainly *different*.Anyway, Signs does a great job keeping the suspense constant by way of releasing a very small amount of storyline at a time.  It doesn't give away too much too soon so the movie ultimately becomes predictable.  No, it avoids all THAT typical nonsense.My favorite part of film is probably when the entire family is in the car, and hear alien screeches and sounds coming from the baby monitor.  Everyone then exits the car, as the sound continues (apparently coming from the nearby cornfield, though to be honest, I was quite confused over what was taking place in Pennsylvania and what was taking place in Mexico City and other places).  Talk about a perfectly executed eerie build-up in horror quality THIS moment is.The ending is probably the weakest part, and in fact, the only negative I have with the movie.  The best part about Signs is that, for the majority of it, we didn't actually SEE the aliens.  So when the ending came along...

Though not as shocking in it's finale as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable (a highly underrated movie in my opinion), Signs delivers some nice scares, and some raw emotion as well.Mel Gibson plays a former reverend who, after losing his wife, renounces his faith and dedicates his life to his farm and his two children. But one day, he awakens to find a mysterious circle in his crops, apparently a design of some kind and one he readily blames on local vandals. Apparently, he is not the only one. There are a rash of crop circles around the world. Some believe that it is the sign of an apocalypse, others beleive it to be signs of an alien invasion. What does it all mean? That is all I am going to say, go see the movie.Signs got mixed reviews on it's opening, as did Shyamalan's other movies. The reason I can only speculate is that they were expecting some kind of Independence Day movie with a full scale alien invasion, or a movie about those fascinating crop circles. To be honest, it is neither. What is in the movie might suprise you, but there are times when it is quite scary. The frightening moments are laregly the ""bump in the night"" variety, but done with a great sense of style. The suspense in the movie is more on a psychological level, which makes the movie all the more freaky.I have a lot of respect for M. Night Shyamalan's movies, he is one of the few mainstream directors who can suprise you from time to time. The trailer for Signs doesn't give any indication that the movie is about more than crop circles, but believe me, it is. The acting, while toned down, is superb, with Joaquin Pheonix giving a good supporting role.Will you like it? Probably, providing that you go into the movie with an open mind and something to bury your head in when the tense moments arise (a sweater or your partner's arms would do nicely).

Night Shyamalan ""the next Speilberg,"" because his forte is making big expensive pieces of crap designed for mass-market consumption.  The difference might be that while Speilberg liked to set up corny action-figure-style battles for the fate of the universe (or whatever), in which the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black purely for your ease of distinguishing between the two, Shyamalan likes to set up lame, schlocky ""thrillers"" with ""shock endings"" so utterly obvious that I have a bridge to sell to anybody who can't guess the twist by the end of the opening credits.""The Sixth Sense""?  Fine, we'll let that one slide; after all it's hard to be objective about it now that there have been so many copycat films featuring precious child actors with three names who whisper ominous-sounding rhetoric.  I'll admit that the ending may come as a revelation to anybody who has never seen a movie before.  ""Unbreakable""?  Clumsy and hamfisted in its plot manipulations towards a conclusion as trite and trivial as...well, as that of ""The Sixth Sense.""  So we're starting to see a pattern here.  Thus we arrive with inexorable logic at the next installment, ""Signs,"" which takes the established formula of contrived suspense and penny-plain plot twists to the next level of redundancy.Widower Mel Gibson (get it ladies - widower - now swoon on cue), his two kids (both suffering from patently plot-driven afflictions), and his brother Joaquin Phoenix  (I have nothing sarcastic to say in parenthesis about him except that he should make better career decisions) wake up one day to find huge ""crop circles"" on the family farm.  Turns out they aren't alone - hundreds of similar patterns start popping up in fields all over the globe with such rapidity that it's impossible to ascribe the phenomenon to human hoax.  Then spaceships start appearing in the sky, and green men start popping up at kids' birthday parties.  Looks like a good old-fashioned garden variety alien invasion.Of course, this is just the ""setup.""  Fans of this film will tell you that it's really all about the ""message,"" and this has to do with the fact that Gibson's character used to be a minister, but lost his faith after his wife's tragic death.  He's questioning the meaning of life, the validity of religion, the purpose of human existence - all in the most trite and cliched way possible, of course.  Basically, he's mad at God for killing his woman.  So God, never willing to let a sheep stray from the flock, duly sends a team of hostile aliens to almost-but-not-quite conquer the earth, purely to reaffirm Gibson's faith so that he can get started on ""The Passion.""  ""Signs,"" you see, refers not to crop circles, but to the apparently random events in our lives that can be seen by the enlightened as little messages from the Man Upstairs - such as your wife's death or the planet's invasion by extraterrestrials.In other words, this film can't decide whether it wants to be hackneyed sci-fi or hamfisted psychodrama, so it acquiesces in alternating back and forth between the two, or trying (and failing) to make sense of one mode in terms of the other.  The ""stylistic flair"" applied by ole ""M"" to the whole proceedings only emphasizes his fundamental bankruptcy of plot or point.  If some people call this a ""great movie,"" it's only because they can't distinguish style from substance, or, for that matter, Shinola from its notorious alternative.

Now, if he could just hire someone to actually write a decent script, he could turn out some good movies.  Unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen.The point of this movie (as I see it) is one man's journey to regain his lost faith.  Mel Gibson does a great job as ex-Father Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix is great as Graham's brother.  The plot of the movie, however, is senseless and devoid of anything interesting.The story revolves around a supposed alien invasion.  Most of the film is an utterly uninteresting buildup to this point.  The plot is full of holes, and (as is typical of Night's films) you are often left scratching your head and wondering why nothing seems to fit together.Most of the suspense (for which this movie was acclaimed) consists of the characters going somewhere without the means to protect themselves.  The Hess brothers repeatedly enter a corn field (which they suspect contains hostile aliens) with nothing more than a flashlight, and, at the end of the film, actually set down a pickaxe before going to 'check things out' and see if they're in physical danger.  Brilliant.  Flashlight dropping is a good trick too, one that is used repeatedly.  It seems that, whenever Night wants us to build suspense, someone drops a flashlight.  Cute.People who enjoy a movie where suspense means wierd camera angles and stuff jumping out of nowhere will be entertained--most everyone else will be bored stiff.

Along with his brother and two children, he slowly sees this occurence to be a sign of things to come...which ultimately has to do with the climatic ending.

594899,A1Y1PO0Z1312Q3,B00005JL3T,Brandon Wilkening,"[2, 3]","I'm not averse to directors' taking film genres that we are all familiar with and doing new things with them. That is what M. Night Shyamalan is apparently trying to do in Signs, taking the classical alien invasion film and focussing on how one particular family copes with everybody's worst nightmare. It's an interesting idea, and it worked really well for about the first half of the film. Up until that point, we still do not know what or who is leaving those mysterious crop circles. This creates an almost unbearable atmosphere of suspense, which is heightened by Shyamalan's technical skills as a filmmaker. I nearly jumped out of my seat a few times in the scenes in which Mel Gibson's character is walking through his cornfield at night, including one scene in which he catches a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye. This is the kind of stuff that I was expecting when I paid for my ticket. But then the film gets all messy. First we have an appearance by Shyamalan himself that is absolutely mystifying and seemingly unrelated to the whole plot. In another scene, Gibson's family watches recorded footage on television of an alien walking past terrified schoolchildren in Brazil. The scene is admittedly creepy to say the least, but it has the unsavory consequence of removing most of the suspense from the film. Now we know exactly who is leaving the crop circles; it doesn't really help that Shyamalan's aliens are incredibly unoriginal, indeed like something out of the original Star Trek series. After that, things kind of fall apart. This becomes especially acute when Shyamalan injects his typical spiritual conundrum into the plot, as we learn that Mel Gibson's character is a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a traffic accident. And unsurprisingly, after we learn this, much of the rest of the film revolves around Gibson regaining his faith in time to save his family. Just exactly what the connection is between Gibson's born again status and his family's survival is uncertain in the film, but the implication is that the former led to the latter. But ignoring the unsuitability of adding this dimension to the plot, the whole logic of Gibson's transformation is even stranger. Remember, his wife's death made him lose his faith; this is obviously a horrible tragedy for anyone to deal with, maybe the worst, but as a Christian Gibson's character would logically be consoled with the knowledge that his wife is in a better place and that he will see her again someday. Now, an alien invasion occurs. Rather than intensifying Gibson's disbelief, as his wife's death did, this unimaginable occurrence causes him to regain his faith. Wow! Maybe I'm being too picky, though. More unforgiveable is Shyamalan's attitude toward the whole plot. He seems to presume that his deep spirituality absolves him from having to come up with an interesting plot resolution. That is the only explanation that I can think of for the ending. It is simply too unconvincing and indeed absurd to be taken seriously. I won't say anymore on that. For me, the half-dozen or so terrifying scenes in the first half of the movie did not make up for the disappointing finale. I was not frightened once in the last hour, only irritated.

594901,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00005JL3T,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","This review DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!After several viewings of M. Night Shyamalan's movies I have come to the firm determination that most of them get better with repeated viewings.  (That is, all except ""Lady in the Water.""  She arrived DOA.)It is true ofUnbreakable [Blu-ray], which I thought was VERY slow.  It was definitely true ofThe Village (Widescreen Vista Series), which I HATED the first time I saw it.  It was also true ofThe Happening, which I thought had an excellent buildup and then just petered out to nothing.And it is true of this movie, which I was really torn about when I first saw it. During that first viewing I found I really loved ""Signs""...that is, until I was REALLY let down at the end.Since then, my feelings about it are still mixed, but they aren't so strong anymore. And, as with the other films I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I feel the merits of the film outweigh its shortcomings.When first I saw ""Signs"" I was enraptured by the signature Shyamalan slow pacing, the gradual psychological buildup.  If you've seen ANY Shyamalan movie you know what I'm speaking of: the gentle introduction of one plot element, then the next--for instance, the ""Signs"" themselves: the crop circles, the news broadcasts, the noise over the baby monitors, and then finally the sounds of footsteps around the characters' house.  It's these little accumulations that make us believe in the alien presence.  Even the aluminum foil the frightened family members wear upon their heads is eerie and helps us believe, as the path that they are on is entirely human and ordinary.  We would do much the same.Certainly the fact that Graham, a former preacher, has lost his faith due to the loss of his wife in a horrific accident seems believable--in fact, I had no problem with that upon my initial viewing. I was not overly happy with the notion that the wife somehow predicted all the key points of the ending once she was hit by the car...while it seemed far-fetched, at least them movie predicted that resistance from the onset, asking whether you were the kind of person who saw signs and miracles, or the kind who saw coincidences?  It was, after all, pretty much the point of the movie.However, I STILL have a problem that the aliens--who one would have to believe SHOULD have done SOME planning for their invasion before they got here, and that in all that planning they somehow overlooked the very substance that accounts for some 70 percent of the planet...WELL, THAT STILL BOTHERS ME!But, as I've said, I have gained a better perspective on this movie, and I think that my problem (and the problem of a lot of other people) is the same as Shyamalon's, and it is that we are hung up on the success ofThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)and are, whether we admit it or not, looking to Shyamalan to repeat that success each time out. It's like asking a batter for nothing but home runs, or a scientist to continuously win Nobel prizes.  He wrote and directed one EXTRAORDINARY film, and we all expect him to hit it out of the park with every movie.It's unfair, but the problem is not just ours...Shyamalan compounds it with every movie he makes, each of them trying to slowly build up to a ""trick"" at the end, some amazing conclusion that will knock our socks off each time.I'm glad to find out, though, that upon further viewings my outlook has become more accepting as to the merits of his films.  Seeing them with a much less hopeful approach softens my negativity; now that I realize that it's not going to be another ""Sixth Sense"" I stop trying to pigeonhole it, and it gives his movies a distinctly new advantage.Try it...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",3,I Am Definitely Not Sure About This Movie,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3696,"['review', 'DOES', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', 'several', 'viewings', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'firm', 'determination', 'most', 'get', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Lady', 'Water', 'arrived', 'DOA', 'true', 'ofUnbreakable', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'thought', 'was', 'VERY', 'slow', 'was', 'definitely', 'true', 'ofThe', 'Village', 'Widescreen', 'Vista', 'Series', 'HATED', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'also', 'true', 'ofThe', 'Happening', 'thought', 'had', 'excellent', 'buildup', 'then', 'just', 'petered', 'out', 'nothing.And', 'true', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'torn', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'first', 'viewing', 'found', 'really', 'loved', 'Signs', 'was', 'REALLY', 'let', 'down', 'end.Since', 'then', 'feelings', 'are', 'still', 'mixed', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'strong', 'anymore', 'other', 'films', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'paragraph', 'feel', 'merits', 'film', 'outweigh', 'shortcomings.When', 'first', 'saw', 'Signs', 'was', 'enraptured', 'signature', 'Shyamalan', 'slow', 'pacing', 'gradual', 'psychological', 'buildup', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ANY', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'gentle', 'introduction', 'one', 'plot', 'element', 'then', 'next', 'instance', 'Signs', 'crop', 'circles', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'noise', 'baby', 'monitors', 'then', 'finally', 'sounds', 'footsteps', 'characters', 'house', 'little', 'accumulations', 'make', 'believe', 'alien', 'presence', 'Even', 'aluminum', 'foil', 'frightened', 'family', 'members', 'wear', 'heads', 'eerie', 'believe', 'path', 'are', 'entirely', 'human', 'ordinary', 'would', 'do', 'much', 'same.Certainly', 'fact', 'Graham', 'former', 'preacher', 'lost', 'faith', 'due', 'loss', 'wife', 'horrific', 'accident', 'believable', 'fact', 'had', 'problem', 'initial', 'viewing', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'happy', 'notion', 'wife', 'somehow', 'predicted', 'key', 'points', 'ending', 'once', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'seemed', 'far-fetched', 'least', 'movie', 'predicted', 'resistance', 'onset', 'asking', 'were', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'saw', 'signs', 'miracles', 'kind', 'who', 'saw', 'coincidences', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'point', 'movie.However', 'STILL', 'have', 'problem', 'aliens', 'who', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'done', 'SOME', 'planning', 'invasion', 'got', 'here', 'planning', 'somehow', 'overlooked', 'very', 'substance', 'accounts', '70', 'percent', 'planet', 'WELL', 'THAT', 'STILL', 'BOTHERS', 'ME', ""'ve"", 'said', 'have', 'gained', 'better', 'perspective', 'movie', 'think', 'problem', 'problem', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'same', 'Shyamalon', 'are', 'hung', 'up', 'success', 'ofThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', 'are', 'admit', 'not', 'looking', 'Shyamalan', 'repeat', 'success', 'time', 'out', 'asking', 'batter', 'nothing', 'home', 'runs', 'scientist', 'continuously', 'win', 'Nobel', 'prizes', 'wrote', 'directed', 'one', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'film', 'expect', 'hit', 'park', 'movie.It', 'unfair', 'problem', 'not', 'just', 'ours', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'trying', 'slowly', 'build', 'up', 'trick', 'end', 'amazing', 'conclusion', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'find', 'out', 'though', 'further', 'viewings', 'outlook', 'become', 'more', 'accepting', 'merits', 'films', 'Seeing', 'much', 'less', 'hopeful', 'approach', 'softens', 'negativity', 'now', 'realize', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'stop', 'trying', 'pigeonhole', 'movies', 'distinctly', 'new', 'advantage.Try', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",Signs

From that perspective, this movie appears flawed an inconsistent in its logic.  But, to see this film as a story about one man's struggle with his faith in the face of possible annihilation, transforms Signs into one of the most moving pictures of 2002.  In signs, Shyamalan throws you right into the story, with little exposition, and relies on a sense of the unknown in order to create fear and suspense.

It's a wonderful story of humanity and the aliens are really a back drop to the real plot, which is human emotion and what we go through in certain situations. All of Night's four BIG movies so far have been about this. They are wonderful stories of love, faith and devotion.What bothers me is that the Vista Series has included a DTS 5.1 audio track on both the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable ""Vista Series"" releases. You are missing out on 50% of the reason to buy DVDs if you do not have a home theatre system as the audio is just as important as the video. The sound on The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable when listening to the DTS 5.1 track is truly remarkable. The sound reproduction is flawless and the surround mix is just divine.I was so looking forward to Signs being released when I noticed it was a ""Vista Series"" release. Whislt it was great to watch the movie again and also great to hear it at home in 5.1 Dolby Digital, I was seriously disappointed to note that the DTS 5.1 track had not been included.I beg the studio to not make the same mistake in January when you release The Village.

Night Shmyalan's new thriller is at least very well made, and the cast is terrific. Mel Gibson is emotionally moving as an Episcopalian priest who has lost (and regains) his faith. Joaquin Phoenix is likeable as Gibson's kid brother, with strong audience appeal as a good-hearted homeland hero in the face of grave danger from outer space. And Gibson's kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are genuinely the most adorable kids you could ever hope to meet. Even the bit players shine, in this movie.The production itself is gorgeous, though the soundtrack is a bit overdone. Shyamalan maintains a healthy sense of humor throughout the otherwise melodramatic plot and proceedings - with such bits as the kids (and then Phoenix) donning aluminum foil hats ""to keep the aliens from reading their minds,"" and Gibson's discomfort at swearing and listening to teenaged girls' absurd and unimportant ""confessions"" - but where he really excels is in sustaining suspense and menace through tight and claustrophobic shots, dark lighting, suggestively furtive glimpses of the aliens and really unsettling sound effects.The script, however, has holes and problems: the alien attack (and its anticipation) seem to come virtually out of nowhere, even with an early appearance from the space ships; the aliens are assumed hostile without any explanation as to why, and their motivations are similarly glibly presumed before they've even done anything; the religious subplot is forced and contrived, and its implied ""divine sanction"" of war is shamelessly propagandistic at a time when America is aggressively selling war ethics; and the method of dispatching the aliens is not only grossly unlikely, but actually rather silly.Still, Shyamalan does know how to put on a good show, and the actors make it all worthwhile.

But, for some reason, the producers felt that a family conflict would help the appreciation of the aliens somehow. Interestingly, in one of the climax scenes, Mel Gibson, instead of thinking of what to do against the alien, remembers his last conversation with his wife... Some things just do not make any sense.The movie is basically about the strange events taking place in the numerous different places of the world. And one of these places is a small county in east Pennsylvania, hosting the family of Mel Gibson, an old preacher. He has two little children, who are really weird, in that one reads science books despite his little age, whereas one never drinks from the same glass she has drunk just before. As the family discovers the perfectly circular shaped cropped areas in their farm, they call the police. But, the next day, they realize it's not just them. The whole family gathers before the television. The rest of the movie is about their waiting for the aliens to come to their house again, to confront them. But, I must say, the confrontation is not worth seeing.I wouldn't call this movie a thriller.

594907,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00005JL3T,Busy Body,"[0, 4]","After the huge success - critically and commercially - of ""The Sixth Sense,"" director M. Night Shyamalan had a tough act to follow up. He failed with ""Unbreakable,"" which I feel was an average film at best, but with his latest release, ""Signs,"" he surpasses almost everyone's expectations in producing not only his best film to date, but definitely one of the highlights of 2002. As soon as a film receives huge success and makes hundreds of millions the world over, people are always there waiting to criticise. This fact stands the same with Signs; the film grossed a staggering $110 million in its first two weeks of release in the US alone, and in my opinion was well deserved. There aren't many films that deal with the subject of a sci-fi storyline, along with faith and religion, but Signs does - and to excellent effect...Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He used to be a vicar, until six months ago when his wife, Colleen, tragically died in a car crash. He lost all faith in the church and abandoned his beliefs. He now lives with his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). Graham awakes one morning to find huge crop circles in his cornfields. He soon discovers he is not alone in all this; many more crop circles are discovered all over the world. The spontaneous reaction from the majority of the world is that aliens have finally visited us. Graham begs to differ. He acts very laid-back in front of his children, but deep down he knows that something isn't right. He wants answers. And he knows they'll come...soon. Over the course of the next few days, all his beliefs, fears and wishes will come true - with some life-changing and shocking results.The acting in Signs is absolutely first-rate. Mel Gibson is outstanding in his role as a confused and upset father of two, struggling to live without the presence of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood of the past few years, and I predict big things for him the future; he was superb in Gladiator and is even better in Signs. The success of his portrayal is that Phoenix finds the core of his character and plays upon it to brilliant effect. His on-screen relationship with his brother is very believable, and gives the film a more credible stamp overall. Rory Culkin is also brilliant as little Morgan, with his asthma problem. Culkin is mature beyond his years in Signs, and the portrayal is reflected in Morgan's adult flare. Culkin is slowly but surely following in his older brothers footsteps. He may never reach the crazed popularity and worldwide idolism that Macaulay did with the Home Alone movies, but he'll be big. Agibail Breslin is another superb young actress in Signs, and definitely one of the main reasons why I love the film so much. She instantly reminds me of the young Carol Anne in The Poltergeist. Her acting ability is superb for such a young age - only bettered by Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense."" There are also very professional acting moments from Cherry Jones as Officer Paski. Her wisecrack jokes at the start of the film are replaced with more serious and outstanding emotional moments. Director M. Night Shyamalan also has a role as Ray Reddy, the other person who was in the car with Graham's wife when it crashed. He survived. She didn't. Cue hatred from Graham between the two.There are so many brilliant scenes in Signs that make is such a unique film. The scene where Graham goes out in the middle of the night with his flashlight to investigate rustling in his cornfields (as if you would!) is just a classic - the leg that disappears into the crops is very creepy and his reaction is even more astonishing. There are also some brilliant TV scenes. The scenes where many bright lights are seen hovering over Mexico City and the birthday party scene in Brazil are just incredibly spooky - especially the latter. Imagine walking down an alley and seeing an alien staring back at you in a way that you'd feel like dying of total shock. The commotion of the birthday children also adds to the disturbing effect of the scene. The final half hour of the film is brilliant too. The family decide to stay in their house and board up all the windows and doors instead of leaving for good. There are many superb moments towards the end, and the highly dramatic musical score adds to this immensely. There are many symbolic meanings in Signs that make it all the more enjoyable. Bo's obsession with clean water leads to the source that rids the aliens from the earth and Morgan's asthma problem is perfectly handled, especially towards the end of the film. His asthma problem leads to Graham putting his faith back into the church and resuming his job as a vicar. The film has many emotional ties; while the rest of world is no doubt going crazy with horror, the film manages to keep most of the screen time on the family, and how they deal with such a situation.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Director M. Night Shyamalan is definitely one of the best directors in today's world of film. The man is a truly unique writer/director who already has a trademark ability to hold the audience in suspense through twists and clever filming. He is fast becoming the new king of horror/suspense films much like Hitchcock, but with his own trademark signature. Signs rounds off a brilliant trilogy of hugely successful films from Shyamalan, and I'm sure there will be more to come from him in the future.",5,Surprisingly Good,1048636800,"03 26,

594908,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00005JL3T,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","""Signs"" is listed as a science fiction thriller, but I believe that is not really the correct genre.  I would call this a ""religious"" movie - if it were still legal in the US to use that word - and so instead I'll call it a ""faith-based thriller.""Since the screenplay was written by M. Night Shyamalan - and directed by him as well, of course (with his standard cameo) - you know that it will have a twisteroo at the end, and this film is no exception.  Now, I myself am not a big fan of twisteroos, unless they are done well.  Films such as ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""The Village"" were three of his other films with a twist that I really liked, with obviously ""The Sixth Sense"" being my favorite.  So to Mr. Shyamalan:  ""Keep twisting away.""The actors here are very good, but that's not a surprise since it has such a good cast.  Mel Gibson, despite what people say about him, has quite a bit of talent, probably more in the direction department than acting.  Joachin Phoenix, despite having ""gone off the rails"" (the media's words, NOT mine) always gives it a go.  And seeing Abigail Breslin when she was young (how ironic is that statement?) was a treat.  If you haven't seen ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I urge you to check it out NOW.  One of the funniest comedies.  Ever.  And the surprising thing is:  this film is actually very funny as well, for at least the first couple of acts.  I had some good laughs until that point.  Then it tries to become more scary.I do have some issues with this film though, of course.  There are a couple of plot devices that I found to be a little, well, corny, which fits since the film was shot mostly on a farm.  Also, when the film ends, there is still a major issue on a global scale that seems unresolved to me.  It's hard to describe what that lack-of-resolution is without giving things away, so that's all that I will say.But still, I believe that ""Signs"" is a 3.5, but I'll round up today since I mostly had a good time watching.",4,I don't have faith that you'll like it,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1985,"['Signs', 'listed', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'believe', 'not', 'really', 'correct', 'genre', 'would', 'call', 'religious', 'movie', 'were', 'still', 'legal', 'US', 'use', 'word', 'so', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'call', 'faith-based', 'thriller', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'standard', 'cameo', 'know', 'will', 'have', 'twisteroo', 'end', 'film', 'exception', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'twisteroos', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'Films', 'such', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'Village', 'were', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'twist', 'really', 'liked', 'obviously', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'being', 'favorite', 'So', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'Keep', 'twisting', 'away', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'surprise', 'such', 'good', 'cast', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'quite', 'bit', 'talent', 'probably', 'more', 'direction', 'department', 'acting', 'Joachin', 'Phoenix', 'having', 'gone', 'off', 'rails', 'media', 'words', 'NOT', 'mine', 'always', 'go', 'seeing', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'how', 'ironic', 'statement', 'was', 'treat', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'urge', 'check', 'out', 'NOW', 'One', 'funniest', 'comedies', 'Ever', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'least', 'first', 'couple', 'acts', 'had', 'good', 'laughs', 'point', 'Then', 'become', 'more', 'scary.I', 'do', 'have', 'issues', 'film', 'course', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'devices', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'well', 'corny', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'farm', 'Also', 'when', 'film', 'still', 'major', 'issue', 'global', 'scale', 'unresolved', 'hard', 'describe', 'what', 'lack-of-resolution', 'giving', 'things', 'away', 'will', 'say.But', 'still', 'believe', 'Signs', '3.5', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'today', 'mostly', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching']",Signs

594910,AETS5ZMP2EM1U,B00005JL3T,Canary,"[0, 0]","This movie supports my theory that once somebody has had a big hit like The Sixth Sense, he can get away with sloppier story telling because he'll get the cast, scoring, editing and publicity help needed to bolster his next efforts. The film was moderately entertaining but missed a chance to be great because apparently nobody said, Hey Night, how about fixing this and that before we start production? I wanted to love the movie, and had no problem with the story turning out to be more drama than sci fi (although I like sci fi a lot and expected more). But the flaws in the story were distracting. How come the reverend lost his faith over one incident, his wife's death? His whole foundation was shaken by one innocent accident -- it wasn't like she was kidnapped, tortured, raped without a chance to say goodbye. As a non-cleric, moderately religious person who has lost loved ones, I don't think it's that simple to shake somebody's faith so I couldn't really see it as anything but a plot device. And if you're going to stick aliens into a family drama, at least have it make sense. How come the aliens spent all that time plotting an invasian and didn't figure out that millions of people have garden hoses to use against them? Why didn't they at least wipe out our water infrastructure first? And why did they stop attacking in just 12 hours? Did it suddenly hit them that duhh - there are 5 billion people on earth to knock off, one by one (since they didn't use weapons of mass destruction). What had they intended to achieve? All we got to help us with the alien backstory was a kid reading from a book about aliens. That backstory was much weaker, too much on the nose, than the family characters' backstory (provided mostly during the family's one trip to town). BTW, because I expected the story to be scary, since I was watching it at night in a dim living room in a house situated way out in a rural area, I had a friend watch it with me. No need. The few scary moments were easily endured. Perhaps it was scarier in the theater??? The humorous bits were nice, could have used more of those to compensate for the dramatic weaknesses.

594912,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B00005JL3T,Cary L. Brown,"[1, 2]","M. Night Shamalan (did I spell that right?) has a particular ""niche"" he writes for...  the ""twist-ending"" film.  His first major film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" was magnificent, and I really loved ""Unbreakable"" as well.  This is the other Shamalan film I really like.  (Others, such as ""The Happening"" and ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" are quite a bit more underwhelming in my opinion, though they're not nearly as bad as some reviewers would lead you to believe!)This film is really a classical fairy tale...  a term that may make people come to the wrong conclusion if I don't explain.  See, real ""fairy tales"" aren't what we often think of by that term today.  We think of them as being set ""in another time and place"" because most of those we know are set in our past, in a situation which to use seems strange.  But at the time that the stories came into being, they were cast in the actual work in which the listener to the tale was familiar.  They also tended to be quite dark, and often rather frightening and violent, not remotely like the ""Disney-fied"" version we often think of today.Basically, a ""fairy tale"" introduced a magical or supernatural element into the world that the audience was familiar with, and usually posed a a morality tale with great trial and danger, sometimes leading to a heroic victory (and maybe even a ""happily ever after"" though that's really part of the ""Disney-fication"" I mentioned earlier most of the time!) but at least as often, a tragic morality tale.This story is a modern fairy tale.  Yes, it's aliens instead of gnomes or succubi or fairies or witches or whatever...  but they serve the same purpose in the story.  The ""heroes"" aren't really glorious heroic figures, but are common people, going through a very personal trial... one which can either be overcome or which can prove out as a ""tragic morality tale""At the core of this story, and part of what some of the audience disliked about the flick, is the idea that ""there are no coincidences.""  The lead character is a former minister who lost faith due to a personal tragedy.  I know that some folks I know really liked that aspect of the character at first... and they were the ones who hated the movie the most once it was done...  because this is, in the end, a POSITIVE morality tale, about how even the most inconsequential-seeming (or even annoying) things in your life can, in the end, prove to be there for a reason.This movie has a hopeful ending, and is very much ""pro-faith.""  If that appeals to you, you'll enjoy the movie.  If you're one of those people who find the concept of ""faith"" to be something you associate (wrongly, I'd argue) with stupidity, you'll almost certainly hate everything about this film.Finally... this isn't an action movie, or a horror movie.  Yes, there's a global invasion going on, but every bit of this movie is small, and personal.  It's about what goes on INSIDE of a person, not what's going on outside.  It's a deeply emotional film, but if you expect an action-adventure film, you'll be very disappointed.I recommend this film, and have shared it with a number of friends and family members who never saw it...  for various reasons.  Virtually all appreciated it, except for a couple of folks I know who have a passionate hatred of the concept of faith (and who falsely associate that with being ""anti-intellectual"" or ""anti-science"" or whatever other nonsense they use to prop up their own faith-based belief that there ""is no God."")",5,"An excellent movie, in the ""fairy tale"" category...",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3485,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shamalan', 'did', 'spell', 'right', 'particular', 'niche', 'twist-ending', 'film', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'magnificent', 'really', 'loved', 'Unbreakable', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Shamalan', 'film', 'really', 'Others', 'such', 'Happening', 'Village', 'Lady', 'Water', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'underwhelming', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'film', 'really', 'classical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'term', 'may', 'make', 'people', 'come', 'wrong', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'See', 'real', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'often', 'think', 'term', 'today', 'think', 'being', 'set', 'time', 'place', 'most', 'know', 'are', 'set', 'past', 'situation', 'use', 'strange', 'time', 'stories', 'came', 'being', 'were', 'cast', 'actual', 'work', 'listener', 'tale', 'was', 'familiar', 'also', 'tended', 'be', 'quite', 'dark', 'often', 'rather', 'frightening', 'violent', 'not', 'remotely', 'Disney-fied', 'version', 'often', 'think', 'today.Basically', 'fairy', 'tale', 'introduced', 'magical', 'supernatural', 'element', 'world', 'audience', 'was', 'familiar', 'usually', 'posed', 'morality', 'tale', 'great', 'trial', 'danger', 'sometimes', 'leading', 'heroic', 'victory', 'maybe', 'even', 'happily', 'ever', 'really', 'part', 'Disney-fication', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'most', 'time', 'least', 'as', 'often', 'tragic', 'morality', 'tale.This', 'story', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Yes', 'aliens', 'instead', 'gnomes', 'succubi', 'fairies', 'witches', 'serve', 'same', 'purpose', 'story', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'glorious', 'heroic', 'figures', 'are', 'common', 'people', 'going', 'very', 'personal', 'trial', 'one', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'overcome', 'can', 'prove', 'out', 'tragic', 'morality', 'tale', 'core', 'story', 'part', 'what', 'audience', 'disliked', 'flick', 'idea', 'are', 'coincidences', 'lead', 'character', 'former', 'minister', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'due', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'know', 'folks', 'know', 'really', 'liked', 'aspect', 'character', 'first', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'most', 'was', 'done', 'end', 'POSITIVE', 'morality', 'tale', 'how', 'even', 'most', 'inconsequential-seeming', 'even', 'annoying', 'things', 'life', 'can', 'end', 'prove', 'be', 'there', 'reason.This', 'movie', 'hopeful', 'ending', 'very', 'much', 'pro-faith', 'appeals', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'concept', 'faith', 'be', 'something', 'associate', 'wrongly', ""'d"", 'argue', 'stupidity', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'hate', 'everything', 'film.Finally', ""n't"", 'action', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'Yes', 'global', 'invasion', 'going', 'bit', 'movie', 'small', 'personal', 'what', 'INSIDE', 'person', 'not', 'what', 'going', 'outside', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'film', 'expect', 'action-adventure', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'have', 'shared', 'number', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'various', 'reasons', 'Virtually', 'appreciated', 'couple', 'folks', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'passionate', 'hatred', 'concept', 'faith', 'who', 'falsely', 'associate', 'being', 'anti-intellectual', 'anti-science', 'other', 'nonsense', 'use', 'prop', 'up', 'own', 'faith-based', 'belief', 'God']",Signs

Is the world is just a hodgepodge of chance and coincidence, and therefore, meaningless, or is the universe guided by some metaphysical force, implying a purpose to everything that happens.

The movie which is supposed to be about a man (played by Mel Gibson) who's family is being left with these out of world ""signs"", is actually a drama about an ex reverend / preist (???) who's lost all faith in God as well as control of his family. The loss of his wife seems to have left this man a bitter, faithless and cynical person who's only keeping it together with the help of his little brother (played by the enormously talented Joaquin Phoenix). The signs and his lack of faith and his past seem to weave together leading the audience to believe that there will be some great touching climax that explains it all. Sadly, there is not. In fact, many of the questions in the film are left unanswered and some things were just down right stupid. Example: He calls himself a reverend, but the people in his town treat him like a preist asking if he'll listen to their confessions and calling him father. I find this to be terribly disturbing since the heart of the story obviously has nothing to do with aliens or signs, but is about a man's faith and his family. Many times (mostly towards the end) there are scenes that try to be scary, touching and inspiring all at once and it's about this time in the movie where you realize that the film's great set up was all for nothing. M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful with past films making you think the story was going one way and then revealing secrets and twists to turn the story upside down. In past films it worked. This time, it has not. What was meant to be a story about signs from another planet is neither thought provoking or scary. The only thrills come from the tension built by the incredible actors, an eerie setting and a great score. The real story is about a faithless man losing control of his life and if M. Night had followed through with the story that he had been building, this would have been an excellant movie. Too bad for us he sells out in the end and ends up confusing the audience. By the time the film was over, the tears that were being shed by those around me who were hoping to see a triumphant and satisfying conclusion were quickly replaced by frowns and puzzled faces; the most clear sign of the entire experience.",3,An Entertaining But Confusing & Often Disappointing Thriller,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,2325,"['saw', 'Signs', 'yesterday', 'theater', 'mother', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'confused', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'man', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'family', 'being', 'left', 'world', 'signs', 'actually', 'drama', 'ex', 'reverend', '/', 'preist', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'God', 'as', 'well', 'control', 'family', 'loss', 'wife', 'have', 'left', 'man', 'bitter', 'faithless', 'cynical', 'person', 'who', 'only', 'keeping', 'together', 'help', 'little', 'brother', 'played', 'enormously', 'talented', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'signs', 'lack', 'faith', 'past', 'seem', 'weave', 'together', 'leading', 'audience', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'touching', 'climax', 'Sadly', 'not', 'fact', 'many', 'questions', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'things', 'were', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'stupid', 'Example', 'reverend', 'people', 'town', 'treat', 'preist', 'asking', ""'ll"", 'listen', 'confessions', 'calling', 'father', 'find', 'be', 'terribly', 'disturbing', 'heart', 'story', 'obviously', 'nothing', 'do', 'aliens', 'signs', 'man', 'faith', 'family', 'Many', 'times', 'mostly', 'end', 'are', 'scenes', 'try', 'be', 'scary', 'touching', 'inspiring', 'once', 'time', 'movie', 'where', 'realize', 'film', 'great', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'nothing', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'past', 'films', 'making', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'revealing', 'secrets', 'twists', 'turn', 'story', 'upside', 'down', 'past', 'films', 'worked', 'time', 'not', 'What', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'story', 'signs', 'planet', 'thought', 'provoking', 'scary', 'only', 'thrills', 'come', 'tension', 'built', 'incredible', 'actors', 'eerie', 'setting', 'great', 'score', 'real', 'story', 'faithless', 'man', 'losing', 'control', 'life', 'M.', 'Night', 'had', 'followed', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellant', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'out', 'end', 'up', 'confusing', 'audience', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'tears', 'were', 'being', 'shed', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'see', 'triumphant', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'were', 'quickly', 'replaced', 'frowns', 'puzzled', 'most', 'clear', 'sign', 'entire', 'experience']",Signs

Night Shyamalan, who also made &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.PLOT SUMMARY: &quot;Signs&quot; takes place in the rural farm area of Pennsylvania, where a retired Preacher lives with his two children and younger brother. Mel Gibson stars as Father Graham Hess, who has lost all Faith in God ever since his wife died in a terrible car accident. One day, Graham thinks his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) are missing in the corn fields. He and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), go out searching for them and discover the legendary Crop Circles in the field. At first, Graham and Merrill insist that it's nothing but teenagers playing jokes, but things start getting creepy when they watch TV and find out that Crop Circles are being found all across the Globe, according to the mysterious news that keeps on being repeated on every single radio station and television channel. When the family dogs start acting up, they are put outside and not much later, one of them dies. Other strange occurences that happen on the farm are that they keep on getting strange signals from Morgan's walkie talkie and someone--or something--has been tresspassing onto their land every night. Morgan keeps on insisting that it's &quot;extra terrestrials&quot; trying to make contact with Earth, but Graham won't believe it. However, when nothing else in Graham's theories seem to work, it all adds up to the fact that maybe--just MAYBE--Morgan might be right.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: M. Night Shyamalan has taken the elements of religion, science, fiction, and even a little bit of horror, twisted them together, and turned them (along with top-notch acting performances, great special effects, and a superb storyline), into a spectacular and spooky film. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances to-date, as the retired minster who's lack of self-belief in religion really nearly drives him to insanity with the Crop Circles. Joaquin Phoenix also gives a superb performance as Graham's younger brother who came to live with the family after Graham's wife died. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are amazing as the kids who believe what's really causing the Crop Circles to form are aliens trying to give Earth signals, as there are only a limited number of them and they are basically the same. The supporting cast does well, too...and M. Night Shyalaman even makes an appearence in the supporting cast, as he usually does in his films. The special effects are wonderful, and the storyline and plot are solid and strong--holds your interest to the very end. A real &quot;thinker's film&quot;, and still manages to keep you entertained...and maybe even a little spooked.The DVD includes a nice package of extras including a six-part documentary on the making of the film, five deleted scenes, storyboards, and a featurette on Shyalaman's first alien film.

It borrows its main theme from the Exorcist as Mel Gibson struggles, and regains his faith confronting his assailants.The first ""signs"" of trouble are the news broadcast detailing the alien invasion - they are so poorly acted and executed - you'll think high school students filmed them.  The first broadcast is so out of place with the professional delivery of the main cast, that the viewer is immediately put on notice that corners were cut making the film - and the whole show loses credibility from that point on.Then they make the worst mistake ever - actually showing one of the aliens for the first time in a news broadcast - robbing the film of the opportunity to have the fine cast shape this important moment, as is done in almost every horror film.",1,The Corn Field &quot;Signs&quot; Originally read: Don't Buy This DVD,1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,1411,"['Signs', 'weak', 'B', 'movie', 'dressed', 'up', 'look', 'big', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'stars', 'what', 'so', 'disappointing', 'Signs', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'put', 'nice', 'performances', 'have', 'absolutely', 'story', 'work', 'with.Signs', 'borrows', 'heavily', 'two', 'genre-defining', 'horror', 'films', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Exorcist', 'location', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'narrative', 'devices', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'cast', 'boards', 'farm', 'house', 'assaulted', 'horrible', 'enemies', 'only', 'link', 'outside', 'world', 'being', 'television', 'main', 'theme', 'Exorcist', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'faith', 'confronting', 'assailants.The', 'first', 'signs', 'trouble', 'are', 'news', 'broadcast', 'detailing', 'alien', 'invasion', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'acted', 'executed', ""'ll"", 'think', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'filmed', 'first', 'broadcast', 'so', 'place', 'professional', 'delivery', 'main', 'cast', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'put', 'notice', 'corners', 'were', 'cut', 'making', 'film', 'whole', 'show', 'credibility', 'point', 'make', 'worst', 'mistake', 'ever', 'actually', 'showing', 'one', 'aliens', 'first', 'time', 'news', 'broadcast', 'robbing', 'film', 'opportunity', 'have', 'fine', 'cast', 'shape', 'important', 'moment', 'done', 'almost', 'horror', 'film']",Signs
594927,A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ,B00005JL3T,"Christopher Forbes ""weirdears""","[0, 2]","At the risk of adding to the some 507 rants on this page, I'm going to add my two cents to the debate. Signs was neither the worst movie that I've ever seen in my life, nor the best. But it was a disappointment, as it revealed that one of the most startlingly talented directors to come around the the last few years may have been a one-hit wonder. Shamalyan's Sixth Sense was a beauty of a movie, creepy without being gory, beautifully acted (even by Bruce Willis, who I usually think is pretty wooden) and with a twist ending that illuminates the entire movie. Even now that I've seen it several times, the ending is still powerful and changes the movie from a mere ghost story to a work of art. Unbreakable, Shamalyan's followup, was hugely disappointing to me. There was tons of creepy atmosphere but 'surprise' ending felt like a cheat rather than a revelation.Signs suffers from the same drawbacks as Unbreakable, though it is a better movie I think. First of all, the performances are better from Gibson, Phoenix and the kids...especially the little girl. But the whole premise of the movie begins to creak about half way through (I'm trying not to give away the ending here, so I apologize if I'm a bit nebulous.) and by the end, I don't much care about any of it.My biggest problem with this movie, however, is it's vacuous spiritual viewpoint. The emotional center of the story revolves around Mel Gibson, a former clergyman who lost his faith when his wife was killed in a truly horrifying accident. The spiritual message of this movie is that everything happens for a reason and events that look superficially tragic can end up as blessings. This sounds good...we moderns like this because it comforts us in the the face of the senseless tragedies of contemporary life. But as presented in this movie, the theological issues are full of holes. (DON'T READ ANY FARTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING) Shamalyan imagines a world in which people are puppets in some way, in which the tragic death of Gibson's wife provides the seeds that save the rest of his family. But it ignores the suffering of others. Are we to assume that somehow there's meaning and purpose to Gibson's life that others who were slaughtered didn't possess? Are some people allowed miracles while others are just fodder for invading aliens? This kind of thological view point actually turns to jelly when looked at closely.While I can't state it unequivocally, I believe this viewpoint to be actually erroneous and even dangerous. It leads to a feeling that some people are more ""special"" to God or whomever, than others. The message of most religions at there core, even Christianity, is not this at all. No one is more special to God than anyone else, and, while I do believe in an ultimate meaning behind all things, I'm not sure that the signs can be read as literally or as patly as in this movie. Real spirituality is a much deeper mystery than what is presented here.Rant aside, I wouldn't say this is a movie that you should avoid. It's not horrible.

594929,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B00005JL3T,cinemagirl,"[0, 0]","""Signs,"" the third wide release film of M. Night Shyamalan's career, affirms the old saying: less is more. Subtlety and cohesion are his strengths, and this film demonstrates both in the same vein of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable."" With the multitude of ""scare"" flicks released these days, it's a blessing that film audiences can go to the movies without expecting blood and gore as the primary fright tactics. A frequent question posed in the world of literature applies to film: Can an entertaining film be serious? Shyamalan answers with a resounding ""yes.""Moviegoers can put faith in almost any actor Shyamalan casts; they all give astounding and credible performances. Mel Gibson gives the performance of his career, but the real star is Joaquin Phoenix, who proves he doesn't need to play the role of an emperor in order to garner attention for his acting. The children, especially Rory Culkin, turn in good performances. One reason why his actors are so credible is due to the fact that subtlety is key; it's much easier to be genuinely afraid if there is ambiguity in a scene. Forget guts hanging out and scenes of knife stabbings - what you don't see (and what you don't understand) is what's terrifying.Greatness is clearly here. That storyline cohesion that Shyamalan seems to favor so much is a refreshing approach in cinema today. Most elements resonate with authenticity (for example, a previous review mentioned the realistic news reports). Shyamalan has crafted an intricate web that can be appreciated by those looking for a genuinely worthy film and by those who merely want to have see something fun over the weekend.In essence, Shyamalan may very well be the next Hitchcock and Spielberg amalgamated into one. The sense of awe he creates, his excellent filmmaking, and his ability to scare are all in his arsenal that has already taken him to the top.",5,Signs of Life.,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,1876,"['Signs', 'third', 'wide', 'release', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'career', 'old', 'saying', 'more', 'Subtlety', 'cohesion', 'are', 'strengths', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'multitude', 'scare', 'flicks', 'released', 'days', 'blessing', 'film', 'audiences', 'can', 'go', 'movies', 'expecting', 'blood', 'gore', 'primary', 'fright', 'tactics', 'frequent', 'question', 'posed', 'world', 'literature', 'applies', 'film', 'Can', 'entertaining', 'film', 'be', 'serious', 'Shyamalan', 'answers', 'resounding', 'yes', 'Moviegoers', 'can', 'put', 'faith', 'almost', 'actor', 'Shyamalan', 'give', 'astounding', 'credible', 'performances', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'career', 'real', 'star', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'play', 'role', 'emperor', 'order', 'garner', 'attention', 'acting', 'children', 'especially', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'One', 'reason', 'why', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'credible', 'due', 'fact', 'subtlety', 'key', 'much', 'easier', 'be', 'genuinely', 'afraid', 'ambiguity', 'scene', 'Forget', 'guts', 'hanging', 'out', 'scenes', 'knife', 'stabbings', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'terrifying.Greatness', 'clearly', 'here', 'storyline', 'cohesion', 'Shyamalan', 'favor', 'so', 'much', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'cinema', 'today', 'Most', 'elements', 'resonate', 'authenticity', 'example', 'previous', 'review', 'mentioned', 'realistic', 'news', 'reports', 'Shyamalan', 'crafted', 'intricate', 'web', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'looking', 'genuinely', 'worthy', 'film', 'who', 'merely', 'want', 'have', 'see', 'something', 'fun', 'weekend.In', 'essence', 'Shyamalan', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'next', 'Hitchcock', 'Spielberg', 'amalgamated', 'one', 'sense', 'awe', 'excellent', 'filmmaking', 'ability', 'scare', 'are', 'arsenal', 'already', 'taken', 'top']",Signs

Until news broadcasts start showing unidentified craft over Mexico City and other patterns in crops all over the world.One of the key components in this film: Suggestion over Revelation. Like the Blair Witch Project, what scares you is the things you don't see or glimpse. There's several scenes in the film before the end where you don't see full view an alien, you see his leg pass into a patch of crops or a hand under a door, or when they pick up distorted sounds from a baby monitor. You do see however a full view(albeit blurry)of an alien from a home video shot at a South American birthday party. Quite freaky actually.Don't expect another Sixth Sense with this one. It kinda lags a bit or it wouldn't explain something very clearly or it seems rather uninventive(one of the kids has asthma and naturally he has an attack at a critical moment). Or don't even expect a Sixth Sense-like ending. There's no huge revelation about one of the characters or the aliens.But otherwise like good suspense films it gets under your skin.

They take way too many liberties with the fact-- I mean, we all lived thru the great Alien invasion of '97, we know what Aliens are really like and how they are repulsed.  Hell, they didn't even have ships when they invaded us.  They just used their wings.  Hell, the aliens in this one didn't even *have* wings.

And they're repulsed by silver, not tap water, unless that tap water has an unusually large amount of silver in it, which is usually doesn't.  Furthermore, they never even explained how the Aliens actually loved us and came in peace, but they express affection thru murder so we didn't understand and it was all a big misunderstanding, until we fixed it and now we all live in peace with the aliens.  Remember that?  I mean sure, I could accept this movie if there were no alien invasion back in '97, and if we had no concrete evidence as to how aliens behave, or even if they exist.  Then you can have them behave however you want, because as a fictional creation there are no rules, and no reasons to believe the creatures would behave anyway in particular.

594936,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,B00005JL3T,Connor J. Hamilton,"[1, 3]","Aliens. Aliens invading the earth from another planet, with capabilities of spraying small amounts of poison gas at their enemies; aliens whose skin can take on the nature of their environment. Sound like your corny, everyday science fiction plot? On paper, yes-but here we're dealing with M. Night Shyamalan. With him, it's different.Signs is not what anyone in his right mind would compare with the sort of B-grade film you would expect from this genre. Not only does its suspense come in tantalizing, well-done bits-it also deals with far deeper matters.One factor that makes this film so good is its small scope-a lot of the film, and certainly the most climactic moments, is filmed within one house and its surrounding cornfield. For this type of movie, this limited scope is perfect. Rather than seeing spaceships land on wheat fields or little alien communities living on blasted planets, most of what we can see is restricted to the observance of Graham Hess and his children, and his brother Merrill. And being a family in rural Pennsylvania, this isn't much.As I said, the suspense comes in little snatches. First we find gigantic crop circles in the Hess cornield-and no explanation as to how it happened. Then on the TV we see that similar crop circles have been appearing in hundreds of places all over the world. Graham and Merrill chase a mysterious intruder around their house-who they think is a local troublemaker-and find out that he has jumped the ten-foot space from the ground to their roof, and that they need to re-think their ideas on who it was.And so it builds...the very atmosphere of the movie is wonderful. It was inspired by Hitchock's The Birds, but in my opinion Signs tops that by a long shot.As to the acting-it's all good. Mel Gibson is not what I would call a perfect actor, but his role as Graham Hess is not incredibly demanding, and he doesn't do very badly at all. He is by no means one of those actors who distracts the viewer attention by giving a bad performance.Giving a better performance is Joaquin Phoenix as his brother Merrill. You ought to ask-Roman emperor Commodus as a Pennsylvanian who works at a gas station? That's right, and he pulls it off admirably well, with a perfect balance of humor and drama, depending on what the situation requires. And he is, of course, helped along by Shyamalan's superb screenplay.Graham's son Morgan is the one flaw in this otherwise wonderful film. To put it in a nutshell...he's a brat. His brash, know-it-all behavior toward his father is extremely disrespectful, but mercifully doesn't take up much screen time. Seriously-in every aspect of life, who knows better? The father or the son? Obviously, the father would know more, but Morgan seems either not to realize this or ignore it in the film. I wish his character had been changed. But his mannerisms don't get too much time on the screen. Don't let it turn you off to this great film.His sister Bo (interesting name for a girl) is much better as a character, and far easier to watch on screen than her brother. The actress who plays her does quite well, especially considering the fact that she must be quite young.Then we come to Shyamalan's directing. We're talking about the man who helmed the tiller of the Sixth Sense here...it's tough to go wrong. The slow revealing of the aliens, the realism of the TV coverage of the invasion, the nail-biting suspense of the attack on the Hess' house, etc.-it's all awesome.Besides portraying an invasion of the earth from extraterrestiral sources, Signs also deals with other things-with some ""signs"", as a matter of fact. This name does not deal strictly with the crop signs. We find out in the course of the film that Graham Hess was formerly a minister, but after the death of his wife left the church and thought he had left his faith. But throughout the course of the film events come together in such a way that he can have no doubt that Someone is watching over him and his family, and in the end his faith is regained. Wow-this sounds rather close to Christianity. Keep it up, Shyamalan!For dealing with a genre like extraterristials, Signs is the best of its kind that I have run into.

Night Shyamalan is known for his twist endings, so a lot of people expected ""Signs"" to have a twist ending of its own.Unfortunately, this movie is not as satisfying as Mr. Shyamalan's previous efforts.The plot is structured around an alien invasion, but you hardly ever see the aliens. This made me feel like the director knew his Creature FX weren't going to be good, so he invented ways to get around showing them. What's scarier than not showing anything? Showing SOMEthing! The one cool alien scene is the ""birthday video."" It's bone-chilling, because we get to see the alien, even if only for a moment.The most enraging part of ""Signs"" was the thinly woven coincidences that you're expected to believe. It felt like M. Night Shyamalan just wrote a bunch of scenes, and came up with a way to slap 'em all together at the end. What a gyp!He also ""fixed"" plot holes by addressing them in the movie! For example, Rory Culkin finds a used book about aliens, and most of the theories in the book just happen to pertain to the aliens that are in the process of invading. M. Night Shyamalan knew the audience would be asking ""how would the author of the book know that?"" so he has Mel Gibson ask that very question! I guess we're all supposed to be grateful that the script identifies its own flaws for us.As an alien-invasion movie goes, this film is sub-par, especially in regards to the obligatory alien weakness. Look to a superior film like ""the Arrival"" (starring Charlie Sheen) to get a sense of how to really freak people out with aliens.Here's my twist ending for you: this whole review is false.

However, I really did enjoy Mr. Shyamalan's &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and found &quot;Unbreakable&quot; OK.  So, I was prepared to give this movie a chance, but had many doubts about what it was going to be.  And I thought I had the movie pretty much figured out, but it really is only about aliens as a means to the point of the movie, which is really about the issue of faith.There is a great deal of humor in the movie.  Who doesn't love the Hershey Kiss foil helmets?  Or the girl at the pharmacy who insists on confessing to Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) even though he reminds her firmly that he is no longer a priest.The tragedy of Graham's wife being run over in a rather amazing accident is important to the movie in unexpected ways.  It is interesting that Mr. Shyamalan plays the poor soul who fell asleep and killed Graham's wife.  But he ends up being the vehicle of the revelation of faith.I don't expect this movie to be everyone's cup of tea.  But I enjoyed it a great deal.  There is a lot of suspense.  The alien stuff is handled in a fresh way.  The child actors, especially Abigail Breslin, are very good.

594940,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00005JL3T,Crazy Jim,"[0, 0]","M. Night Shyamalan (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) has earned a reputation quickly as one of the hottest new suspense directors. On his third film, he tells the story of a faithless preacher whose family is being haunted by ominous unexplained crop circles at their Pennsylvabia farmhouse. Shylaman takes a different approach with his &quot;alien invasion&quot; story. Rather than relying on expensive production and elaborate special effects, he takes a creative approach and shows as little of the actual invaders as possible. Instead, he builds the film around the farmhouse's clostrophobic settings and allows the actors to tell the story rather than some overproduced CGI effects. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a man who has lost touch with his faith is a nice change of pace. This one might be too character-based to appeal to those looking for the same kind of science fiction roller coaster ride that they got with &quot;Independence Day&quot; but it's obvious that Shyamalan was never trying to make a popcorn movie.

Reilly,"[2, 6]","I'm a big moviegoer, but I rarely have a great sense of anticipation about a movie, because I've learned that the more I look forward to seeing something, the more disappointed I usually am. So far the movies of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan have all lived up to the hype...Signs presents a Close Encounters type scenario, from a more down-to-earth perspective: The Earth may be about to receive an Alien visitation, but rather than taking a Global-response view to the impending crisis, we see the POV of Farmer Graham Hess, a former man-of-the-cloth who has lost his faith in the wake of the tragic death of his wife. The film opens with Graham, his Brother (Joaquin Phoenix), and two children waking to an amazing sight: Their Cornfield has been marked by a Crop-sign, and they soon learn that this is becoming a world-wide phenomenon. The children immediately leap upon the Alien-visitation theory, while Graham and his brother take the more down-to-Earth approach of suspecting local pranksters.Things soon take a more ominous turn, as strange noises are heard, Graham sees a weird figure on the roof of his barn, and the kids begin to intercept snippets of what might be an extra-terrestrial conversation.I kept waiting for Shyamalan to drop the ball.....creating a film that is based so much on the apprehension of a terrible event seems very tricky: If he had slipped up just once, shown a little too much (or not enough), the result could have been laughable. I'm happy to say he not only doesn't make that fatal slip, he actually manages to maintain that feeling of impending dread right until the last frame. I'm pretty jaded as far as fright-films go, but my heart was almost leaping out of my chest towards the end of Signs. This is a film that definitely bears repeated viewings. Gibson is superb as the concerned father whose shaken faith colors every aspect of his life, and Shyamalan has written the part perfectly. (The dinner scene, where one of the kids suggestion that they say Grace is met with an explosive ""I WILL NOT WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE OF MY LIFE WITH PRAYER!"" is astonshingly effective.) The acting is great all around, and I thought the casting of the Children was especially well-done.The restraint excersized by Shyamalan is very effective in building the mood. We get a feel for what is going on Globally, but our concern never goes beyond the confines of the farmhouse where the Hess Family lives. James Newton-Howard's score is top-notch, and adds tremendously to the overall creepiness of the experience. I can't recommend Signs enough.

Finding out that Merril was an ex minor league ball player in the films beginning and hearing that Grahams wife's last words were ""swing away"", -boy, I didn't see that coming (yeah, right). Then there was all the water being left around the house by little daughter Bo. Hmmm, could this be leading up to something significant? Then the climax came. You would have thought that the writers would have come up with something better than they did. The aliens are vulnerable to water so they just pack up and leave? Did I miss something here? C'MON!!! With the aliens apparent superior technology and considering that they've been coming to Earth for centuries don't you think that they would have known about water and its effect on them and taken precautions against this ""deadly"" threat? They would have at least been wearing a protective suit instead of running around naked! And then there was the alien that just let Merril beat him to death with a baseball bat without even trying to fight back, and also the fact that the aliens are busting through the house with no problem but just can't seem to get past that one basement door.

They are even green and humanoid.We get to them after the Mel character's tragic loss of a good priest's wife, his near loss of his two children to the hatred that comes when a good father lets the unthinkable happen to Mommy, and the loss of things that Gibson's enormously capable face allows us only to guess at.'It's not ""Father"" any more', he insists, in abbreviation of all that has been lost but feels like it's been renounced. It hasn't been renounced, only placed on pause while Gibson deals with the kids, his brother, the aliens, and then the recovery of his faith after angry honesty has run its course.This is the perfect Sunday afternoon movie, best capped off by a nap and then a 'snacky plate', as Sunday evening hints at a bona fide meal are known in our family.Who would have thought it?

Shyamalan feels that he has to hit a homerun everytime he steps to the plate.  Unlike Merrill(Joaquin Phoenix) in ""Signs"", he doesn't strikeout but he hits singles and doubles.  First to the films positives.  Mel Gibson delivers one of his better performances as the father/farmer and former preacher whose faith has lapsed after the tragic death of his wife.  The children in the film (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) give natural unaffected performances.  Shyamalan establishes an eerie mood throughout the film, something of a homage to his idols Hitchcock and Spielberg but tempered by his own unique sensibility.  Even the opening credits, with a Bernard Hermann inspired music track, portend something Hitchcock-like.  To the film's detriment, the film barely recovers from certain plot holes and implausibilities, if you consider alien invasion as plausible.  That said, the strengths here outweigh it's weaknesses.

He keeps the focus tight on the experience of a single family that lives next to one of the fields where crop circles have been appearing.  We stay with this family and never learn anything that they don't know.  This makes for a very mysterious story.  No current filmmaker is better at creating an atmosphere of tension and dread than Shyamalan.Unfortunately, there is an ongoing theme about faith and the connections between seemingly unconnected events that is not well integrated into the story; it struck me as being rather contrived.  Furthermore, the resolution is simply dreadful.  Suffice it to say that it is difficult to imagine any species evolving with the weakness that these aliens display at the end of the film.

594960,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JL3T,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 5]","Is director M. Night Shyamalan returning to his roots? His first film (which only played at the Toronto Film Festival in 1992), Praying With Anger, explored some religious themes. Signs not only explores them, it exhausts them. If you go into the theater expecting a scary, action-packed chiller with freaky aliens and lots of special effects, you might be looking for other signs, the ones that say EXIT. If however, you're willing to settle for a drama about a man who's lost his faith in God and struggles to find it again when faced with a life and death struggle, you just might like Signs. It's not a bad movie, but it's not what it's being marketed as. I have a feeling that at least one of the crop circles was made by the missing reel that would have made this movie pay off its marketing plot.Billed as a thriller, Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and stars Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a recently widowed, recently retired preacher, raising two small children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and supporting his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) on the sprawling family farm. The signs start to occur right away, when crop circles appear in Hess's cornfield. Without much time to decide whether or not the circles are the work of pranksters, the news media announces that aliens have invaded the world and they're not here to use the telephone.Between the buildup (there are some excellent 'fakeout' scares), there are lots of flashbacks designed to show us why Hess lost his faith. His wife was hit by an inattentive director, er, driver (played by Shyamalan) while out on a late night walk on one of the country roads. Mrs. Hess, of course, hangs on just long enough to deliver some prophetic last words to her husband. (The other unforgivable clich&eacute; in the movie is the asthmatic child locked in a small room, separated from his precious medicine, while the bad guys roam the home.)Like Unbreakable, Shyamalan's second major feature, Signs takes a very long time to get to the point. And just when it seems like things are about to get exciting, it's decided that locking everyone in a dark coal cellar, where nobody (including the audience) can see anything, is a good idea. The cinematography (by the usually very capable Tak Fujimoto), is often too dim, flat, and muddied.You could say Signs is an amalgam of The Apostle, The Blair Witch Project, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Panic Room, and The Natural. I've heard some 'crap circles' grumblings from the movie-going ranks, and someone else compared The Sixth Sense director's batting average to the Phoenix character in Signs: he's a failed baseball player who struck out too many times and has found himself in limbo. Shyamalan hit the ball out of the park with The Sixth Sense, but now he's got two strikes with Unbreakable and Signs. One more and is he out? It may seem unfair to compare his three major motion pictures this way, but that's what moviegoers do. They try to make informed decisions on what they've seen before, before parting with their hard-earned dollars.In Signs, there are some excellent moments of suspense. You hear more than you see, and that works beautifully in connection with the understated, eerie score by James Newton Howard. Unfortunately, there are long stretches of downtime and distracting flashbacks between the moments of suspense. It's too bad, because Shyamalan is talented, and I know he is capable of ratcheting up the suspense levels to all-time highs. But in this case, it looks like he fell in love with the idea of ""two kinds of people"" (you have to see the movie to get that) and forgot he was making Signs for the general masses.There are bits and pieces of a good, scary story here, and the cast is definitely above par. Gibson paired with Shyamalan, and the promise of creepy aliens, is bound to bring in some dollar signs at the box office. Whether or not it will have legs depends on whether or not the audiences will accept that the sci-fi element is just a facade for the movie's true wares: a ponderous sermon on spirituality rising above the threat of 'the devil'.",2,Very disapointing...,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,4110,"['director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'returning', 'roots', 'first', 'film', 'only', 'played', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', '1992', 'Praying', 'Anger', 'explored', 'religious', 'themes', 'Signs', 'not', 'only', 'go', 'theater', 'expecting', 'scary', 'action-packed', 'chiller', 'freaky', 'aliens', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'other', 'signs', 'ones', 'say', 'EXIT', 'however', ""'re"", 'willing', 'settle', 'drama', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'God', 'struggles', 'find', 'again', 'when', 'faced', 'life', 'death', 'struggle', 'just', 'might', 'like', 'Signs', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'being', 'marketed', 'have', 'feeling', 'least', 'one', 'crop', 'circles', 'was', 'made', 'missing', 'reel', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'pay', 'off', 'marketing', 'plot.Billed', 'thriller', 'Signs', 'set', 'Bucks', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'stars', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'recently', 'widowed', 'recently', 'retired', 'preacher', 'raising', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'supporting', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'sprawling', 'family', 'farm', 'signs', 'start', 'occur', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'crop', 'circles', 'appear', 'Hess', 'cornfield', 'much', 'time', 'decide', 'not', 'circles', 'are', 'work', 'pranksters', 'news', 'media', 'announces', 'aliens', 'have', 'invaded', 'world', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'use', 'telephone.Between', 'buildup', 'are', 'excellent', 'scares', 'are', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'designed', 'show', 'why', 'Hess', 'lost', 'faith', 'wife', 'was', 'hit', 'inattentive', 'director', 'er', 'driver', 'played', 'Shyamalan', 'out', 'late', 'night', 'walk', 'one', 'country', 'Mrs.', 'Hess', 'course', 'hangs', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'deliver', 'prophetic', 'last', 'words', 'husband', 'other', 'unforgivable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'asthmatic', 'child', 'locked', 'small', 'room', 'separated', 'precious', 'medicine', 'bad', 'guys', 'roam', 'home', 'Unbreakable', 'Shyamalan', 'second', 'major', 'feature', 'Signs', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'point', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'get', 'exciting', 'decided', 'locking', 'everyone', 'dark', 'coal', 'cellar', 'where', 'nobody', 'including', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'anything', 'good', 'idea', 'cinematography', 'usually', 'very', 'capable', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'often', 'too', 'dim', 'flat', 'muddied.You', 'could', 'say', 'Signs', 'amalgam', 'Apostle', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Natural', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'crap"", 'circles', 'grumblings', 'movie-going', 'ranks', 'someone', 'else', 'compared', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'director', 'batting', 'average', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'Signs', 'failed', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'struck', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'found', 'limbo', 'Shyamalan', 'hit', 'ball', 'park', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'now', 'got', 'two', 'strikes', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'One', 'more', 'out', 'may', 'seem', 'unfair', 'compare', 'three', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'way', 'what', 'moviegoers', 'do', 'try', 'make', 'informed', 'decisions', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parting', 'hard-earned', 'dollars.In', 'Signs', 'are', 'excellent', 'moments', 'suspense', 'hear', 'more', 'see', 'beautifully', 'connection', 'understated', 'eerie', 'score', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'downtime', 'distracting', 'flashbacks', 'moments', 'suspense', 'too', 'bad', 'Shyamalan', 'talented', 'know', 'capable', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'suspense', 'levels', 'all-time', 'highs', 'case', 'fell', 'love', 'idea', 'two', 'kinds', 'people', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'get', 'forgot', 'was', 'making', 'Signs', 'general', 'masses.There', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'good', 'scary', 'story', 'here', 'cast', 'definitely', 'above', 'par', 'Gibson', 'paired', 'Shyamalan', 'promise', 'creepy', 'aliens', 'bound', 'bring', 'dollar', 'signs', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'will', 'have', 'legs', 'not', 'audiences', 'will', 'accept', 'sci-fi', 'element', 'just', 'facade', 'movie', 'true', 'wares', 'ponderous', 'sermon', 'spirituality', 'rising', 'threat', ""'the"", 'devil']",Signs

Mel Gibson plays a disillusioned and recently widowed pastor who lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with his two children and younger brother Merrill, played by Joaquin Phoenix.  When crop circles appear overnight in the pastor's cornfield and the animals in the area begin to act strange, this movie lets loose.  Many of the scenes take place in whipping wind or at night or in rooms with long shadows, lending the necessary creepiness to the scenes.The girl who plays Gibson's daughter is unbelievably charming with her childish deadpan delivery and sincere expressions; her natural performance is reminiscent of Drew Barrymore's in ""E.T.""  Rory Culkin, looking shockingly like his older brother in ""Home Alone"", is less compelling but still competent. Phoenix and Gibson do well separately, although they never seem to have the chemistry of brothers between them.  Their strongest scenes are with the children.  Gibson's interaction with the female sheriff (who once delivered the news that his wife was dying) and with his neighbor Ray (who was responsible for the pastor's wife's death) also sparkle.  I admired Shyamalan's ability to make the audience laugh uproariously one moment and gasp in fright the next.The editing can be confusing at points, but it keeps the suspense tight as the camera blasts from one moment to the next. My biggest disappointment with this movie was how it fell apart after I left the theater.  The break-neck pacing doesn't leave the audience much time for thought, which is good, because the script is not nearly as well-developed as ""The Sixth Sense.""  Too much of it is unrealistic and even nonsensical - unfortunately, I can't go into the details without ruining the movie.  Anyone who knows Bucks County (and Newtown, which gets a cameo appearance) will cringe at the inaccurate way the area is portrayed.In the theater, though, for a couple of hours, this movie is pure entertainment.

The film works well when it's in the old-fashioned scary film mode, but when it starts to tackle the big themes it occasionally becomes, quite frankly, silly. In fact, in all of Shayamalan's films, his insatiable desire to always have to include that big twist tends to be the film's undoing. He succeeded with a good twist in ""The Sixth Sense"", but since then the twists have all felt pretentious and left a bad taste-particularly so in the terrible ""Unbreakable"", which was basically a film that spent three quarters of itself just to build up to a so-so twist in the end. The Village and Signs suffer similar fates, and all three of these films feel too much as though they were written for the sake of a twist, rather than for the sake of being a good story.

Well, not only do they produce one of our most versatile and nutritious vegetables, but sometimes, they act as an afterlife portal for famous dead baseball players. They can also double up as a fabulous play area for Stephen King's children. M. Night Shyamalan's latest film demonstrates another handy use for a cornfield: ""aerial maps"" for alien pilots (even though they have the technology to build massive fleets of spacecraft capable of navigating light-year distances, these kooky invaders haven't quite got a handle on that whole ""G.P.S."" thing yet). Widower/ex-reverend Mel Gibson, his two kids and ""permanent houseguest"" brother (Joaquin Phonenix) are the lucky lottery winners in thier county for a cornfield-based UFO staging area. At its best, ""Signs"" has some gripping moments that recall Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" or Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead""; especially during the film's final third, which takes on a similar claustrophobic siege scenario. At its worst (and unfortunately for the bulk of its length) the film is a ""Close Encounters"" wanna-be, with an eye-rolling ending.

594979,AHTMSD2BWUPLU,B00005JL3T,"""dokterbob""","[1, 2]","After he became famous because of his talent to make a cliche to something which is realistic and emotional, M. Night Shyamalan is a director you can easily put next to the other Big Boys like Ridley Scott or Tim Burton. Now, he returns to complete something which he calls a trilogy. A trilogy of realistic and dramatic, suspensefull thrillers. And it seems like he is aiming for a place next to the Big Boss, Steven Spielberg. Not only because of his attempt to make Aliens new again (something Spielberg also did some years ago with his Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but also by showing that he has a brilliant vision, and now he is ready to entertain a very wide range of audience.The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were, although handling themes who were very much fiction, still very serious, emotional and above all; slow. With his new attempt of re-inventing a cliche, he changed a lot and still kept a lot the same. To start with the similarities, next to the main story line, there's also a plot about a man having to cope with the loss of his wife and losing his faith. Having faith in something seems to be the main theme of the movie; a pastor having to regain his faith in God, and his children who do or do not believe in Aliens who are taking over the world.This, of course, gives the movie something we have missed in a lot of blockbusters lately: depth. It also provides the much needed emotions and realism set agianst a story which is, at first, totally unconvincing. The mix of these two elements makes the whole movie much more believable and thereby also way more suspensefull. And as before, the movie never gets really violent.The movie also continues in the tradition of the director showing up in a cameo. Only this time his cameo has grown into an important character which was, to say the least, a bit surprising. But hey, the man does a great job and it makes the character really stick out, which is very important.But the most surprising element of all, which leads us to the differences between the previous 2 of his movies and this one, is the wit and humour at moments you need a relief. And this is at times really needed, because next to the tension you really feel in your body when sitting at the edge of your seat, you also get a fair amount of shock reactions (even more as in The Sixth Sense) All this adds up to the most intense motion picture experiences we have seen in, well, quite a while. And if you add to this a storyline which is faster in giving information and richer in action sequences, you get a movie which a very wide audience should see.To come to a conclusion, I could fairly say that, because of the much Shyamalan-elements, the fans of the director won't be disappointed. And because of the more commercial style, everyone who never really liked a movie of M. Night before should give Signs a try as well.

Both these central figures cannot make the story come to life, can't endow it with the energy that is needed to make it work. I, at any rate, never felt that we were getting anywhere, advancing toward what was the inevitable goal, visible from the moment we learn that the Gibson character was a minister who had lost his faith. When the denouement is reached and progresses to its end, I felt that the artificiality of the entire scenario still had not much sparked beyond that achieved by many a programmer (B picture) since the beginning of the movies. Frankly, Gibson tried very hard to be the Minister who had lost his heart and lost his faith, he is capable of a great deal as an actor, but he never made the material work. My opinion is that the fault was not his. The kids verged on being very good, but, once again, the weight of what they had to do and say, ultimately did them in. As for the part of the Minister's  younger brother, that was a lost cause from the beginning. This was not a guy who had ever starred in anything and never would convincingly be heroic. Insofar as there are other characters, they shared very little of the film; except for the lady sheriff, no more than one appearance in cameo roles. The lady sheriff is the only role that came off as it should have, whether due to the talent of the actress or the features of the role, I cannot say.All in all,  it is not a bad picture, just not a good one either; certainly, not as good as the possibilities. Gibson is a guy who can be very good indeed, but he can be the opposite as well: that is, he is a guy who is only as good as the material he gets.

Too bad the film didn't live up to its potential.I feel that Mel Gibson was miscast in this movie. While I love him in other films, this was not suited to his abilities. He plays a minister who lost his faith upon the death of his wife. First off, this is highly clich&eacute;. The best acting job was actually done by the young Culkin boy. I just could not be convinced that Gibson was a priest as he tried too hard to fit the role. It's evident in the perception the viewer receives of his struggle.Besides the miscast of the main role, the symbolism was too easily evident. I'll not go into what it is for those who haven't viewed the movie yet, but I will let you know that if you have an IQ higher than your height in centimeters, you'll spot atleast one of the three primary symbolisms that comes to fruition at the end of the movie.I was left wondering why the flashback scenes were done the way they were at the times they were done. For instance, when you are scared senseless at what lies behind door number one and you know it's something hair-raising, why would you go into a flashback that lasts a few minutes? This has been done in the past and perfected for smart opportune times. They were not placed well here.The aliens that visit have much to be desired as far as the costume. I can think of other flicks that had comperable aliens: the ""sleastaks"" from Land of the Lost; ""Gorn"" from the original Star Trek series; ""Godzuki"" from the Japanese Godzilla series; the martians in ""Mars Attacks""!

The plot drove me up the wall, the simplistic breakthrough at the end to take care of the alien situation was lets just say idiotic.  I'm sure that with the care the aliens put in making the crop circles and every other aspect of their behavior they would have know about something like what prooved to be their downfall.  Also the fact that the aliens were either so brave or so dumb to get out of their crafts to wage hand-to-hand combat with us? Isn't that an other potential way of ultimate defeat? Enough said about the alien part of the plot, taking the other non alien parts of the movie and ultimately tying them all together was a good idea, flawed, but a good idea in the least.  The movie was also entertaining since it kept you on the edge of your seat, it let you to see what an alien invasion might feel like if you and your family had to live through it.  Not everyone is able to fly a fighter plane to take out the alien menace like what happens in ""Independence Day"".

This is a film about faith and seeing how everything in life fits together and has purpose. Though it is not obvious from the outset why things happen the way they do, the pieces all fit together.This is not Mel Gibson's best performance, but his acting (and that of the other actors) is good enough to make this story work. The elements that come together at the end might be a bit contrived. In retrospect, it seems like the author of this screenplay thought up the ending, and worked backwards to get it all right.

Gibson plays a pastor who has lost his faith after a tragedy, living with his two small children and brother (Phoenix), a failed baseball player. They live in a big old farmhouse in the midwest, and before long, peculiar things start happening. Crop patterns appear. They hear things running around outside at night. And then....On another level, the movie's about people whose lives have fallen apart from loss. Coming face to face with their fears because of the 'scary events,' they reconnect with themselves and each other, and wake up from the unhappy slumber they've been in. Gibson and Phoenix portray their characters beautifully, and then children are excellent, too. Is it a scary movie? You bet - scary and gripping.

It had more of a plot than any other movie with Aliens in it has. It sure dominates ""It came from the sky"", and beats ""The day the earth stood still"", but I have to admit, both of those were pretty good for their times. This one sort of left the aliens in the shadows until it really needed to bring them out, and reveal their true nature. Then again, that's the purpose behind M. Night Shyamalan's genius.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is living a pretty strange life after his wife was killed in a mysterious car accident, but it is now the present time, 6 months later. His children (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) are under depression. His little girl, Bo, only drinking half a glass of water then saying it's contaminated. His brother of very few words (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to help by moving in with him, but maybe it's only making things worse.The matter changes when a mysterious crop circle appears in the family corn fields. Normally you'd shake this off, but one day later, over 50 crop circles appear all over India. It seems that someone is trying to prove a point by playing this perfectly executed prank, but the problem doesn't stop there. It seems as though people are making sightings of strange creatures just barely after the events of the crop circles, and it doesn't look like they want to leave.The acting in this one was great. The kid actors did a very good job, especially Abigail Breslin who played little Bo Hess. She's so precious. There was something about Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix that made them show their acting talents, even though it didn't seem like they were doing much, but it was great acting on everyone's part, maybe Rory Culkin just a little bit less, but he did good also. Probably runs in the famous Culkin family.The DVD was certainly entertaining escpecially with the deleted scenes. I always like to see DVD's with special features like that. Even M. Night Shyamalans first scary movie that he ever made when he was a kid. Seriously, how many people can say they started making movies as a kid? Not many, and it's surprising to see these, and they're actually pretty funny.What I liked about the movie the best were the aliens. You never even see them until the ending. You don't even need to see them just to know they're there, that what was what kept me watching it till the end. It truly did scare to think they might be hiding in the darkness someday.

Nor do they refer to him as Farmer, and yet his property is dominated by huge corn fields. (Who's taking care of all that corn? Not Mel -- never once do we see him on a tractor.) The plot is activated by the sudden appearance of patterns in his crops and the immediate suspicion that aliens are threatening planet Earth.Am I the only one to recognize the obvious inspiration here? The threat coming from the skies, the visit to an isolated home where terror waits, a child's disrupted birthday party, a family barricading itself inside a house which is being besieged -- this is ""The Birds"", unfortunately without Alfred Hitchcock. Whereas that 1963 classic was taut with gathering suspense and climaxed by a horrific attack, ""Signs"" meanders along somewhat haphazardly and there really is no climax to speak of. (When the alien finally appears at the end, he looks sort of like James Arness in ""The Thing From Another World"".) Many scenes simply don't work. There's one scene where the hero, his brother, and the hero's kids are discussing the situation when suddenly the phone rings. The ring is quite loud on the sound track and the characters on the screen jump in alarm, but the audience I was with didn't react at all.

594997,A2TV6SBCWT7P8S,B00005JL3T,ehakus,"[0, 0]","Quite frankly, it's very difficult to make a very good film about invading aliens. Usually directors get caught up in the special effects or the action, and don't pay attention to what is most important: the reactions of the characters and the effect such a shocking event would have on their community. So, even though M. Night Shyamalan's Signs has significant flaws, it deserves credit for approaching the whole ""alien invaders"" thing in, for the most part, an original, clever, and entertaining way.In Signs, a mid-western family, consisting of a former priest and widower (Mel Gibson), his children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix), is faced with mysterious occurances and then an actual alien invasion. As stated previously, Signs really isn't about the actual alien invasion, for few details about the aliens are provided and the only coverage of their attack on the world comes through the family's TV set. Instead, it's about peoples' reactions to the unknown and mysterious. Consequently, some people, especially those people who walk in expecting some slam-bang action/horror spectacle, may be disappointed.This, however, is unfortunate, because Signs really does have many admirable qualities. Its highlights include a terrific soundtrack (reminicent of Hitchcock's soundtrack for Psycho) and good performances from the actors. As for the directing, it is somewhat uneven. Although Shyamalan is clearly able to generate good ""Hitchcock-esque"" suspense and does have an ability for capturing the small details that create the atmosphere, he does sometimes become a little heavy-handed. The script is also uneven - it has patches of humor and genuine insight into the characters - but also often falls short and resorts to Hollywood cliches which make the characters seem shallow.Overall, however, Signs is quite good. Its biggest flaws are its message about spirituality, which is overly stressed, and the fact that the script sometimes becomes corny. Nevertheless, among the many junky summer blockbusters, Signs is one movie that is worth seeing regardless of its flaws, as its original take on the alien invasion idea and its creepy atmosphere, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, make it well worth the money.",4,Flawed but still pretty original and thrilling...,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,2242,"['Quite', 'frankly', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'invading', 'aliens', 'Usually', 'directors', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'reactions', 'characters', 'effect', 'shocking', 'event', 'would', 'have', 'community', 'So', 'even', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Signs', 'significant', 'flaws', 'credit', 'approaching', 'whole', 'alien', 'invaders', 'thing', 'most', 'part', 'original', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'way.In', 'Signs', 'mid-western', 'family', 'consisting', 'former', 'priest', 'widower', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'children', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'faced', 'mysterious', 'occurances', 'then', 'actual', 'alien', 'invasion', 'stated', 'previously', 'Signs', 'really', ""n't"", 'actual', 'alien', 'invasion', 'few', 'details', 'aliens', 'are', 'provided', 'only', 'coverage', 'attack', 'world', 'family', 'TV', 'set', 'Instead', 'peoples', 'reactions', 'unknown', 'mysterious', 'Consequently', 'people', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'walk', 'expecting', 'slam-bang', 'action/horror', 'spectacle', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.This', 'however', 'unfortunate', 'Signs', 'really', 'have', 'many', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'highlights', 'include', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'reminicent', 'Hitchcock', 'soundtrack', 'Psycho', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'directing', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'Shyamalan', 'clearly', 'able', 'generate', 'good', 'Hitchcock-esque', 'suspense', 'have', 'ability', 'capturing', 'small', 'details', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'sometimes', 'become', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'script', 'also', 'uneven', 'patches', 'humor', 'genuine', 'insight', 'characters', 'also', 'often', 'short', 'resorts', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'make', 'characters', 'seem', 'shallow.Overall', 'however', 'Signs', 'quite', 'good', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'are', 'message', 'spirituality', 'overly', 'stressed', 'fact', 'script', 'sometimes', 'corny', 'Nevertheless', 'many', 'junky', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'Signs', 'one', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'regardless', 'flaws', 'original', 'take', 'alien', 'invasion', 'idea', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'make', 'well', 'money']",Signs

That way the very slight ""squirm factor"" with the kids would be reduced.  But even the kids got into this one a lot more than I thought they would, considering the adult level the movie was shot at.This is a difficult achievement for a movie that works on a lot of levels.  Yes, you can call it a ""monster"" film.  And you could call it a ""space alien"" film.  And you could call it a mystery, as we are not sure what we are seeing until well into the story.  With just this alone, the movie would have been fairly decent.But there are a couple more factors that make it great.  First is the subtle way you see how people react when they believe they are in their last days, and even their last hours of life.  One would expect a lot of scenes of mass hysteria and panic, and in the real world, there probably would be a lot of it.  This movie chooses to take the path that some people would face their maker in a quiet, loving manner.Finally, it's great because we see Mel Gibson's battle with his own faith.  He plays a minister who's wife was taken away in a tragic accident.  He has a problem with God because of this, and at the start of the film, he is ""officially"" not to be called ""Father"" anymore, which the whole town conveniently ignores.

595005,AGM907X0URUZZ,B00005JL3T,"Ensio N Mikkola ""book worm""","[0, 0]","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is a throwback to the alien invasion pics of the 1950's. The plot certainly doesn't smack of originality. Hostile aliens invade earth, humanity is on the brink of extinction, zany humans find a way to defeat alien menace. No ""ET Phone Home"" here. These xenomorphs are purely evil.But Shyamalan chooses not to focus on the epic, ensuing struggle between the aliens and the humanoids but focuses on a single family living on a farm in the countryside.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former pastor who has recently lost his wife (and his faith). Joaquin Phoenix and McCaulay's slightly more talented younger brother play his two sons. These are your main characters. Seems like any episode of ""Little House on the Prairie"" until those nasty crop circles start appearing.Forget about the built-in morality play about faith. This is just a backdrop and an excuse for some boring ponderings about the meaning of life, faith, God etc. ""Signs"" is just a first class psychological thriller. Everything else is just the icing on the cake. The suspense is allowed to build up nicely. We don't find out at least a third of the way into the film that the aliens are hostile. In the meantime, more and more mysterious sightings are seen in the skies over various cities. All of this is revealed through the news playing on the Hess's television set. As a matter of fact, aside from a quick trip to the city, most of the film takes place in and around their old farm. This leaves you with that same sense of ""what the (heck) is going on?"" that they must feel.There are some genuine ""bump"" moments when the aliens finally converge on the farm house. But once the ET's are revealed, they look remarkably generic, plastic. So by the time our heroes find out the alien baddies have severe hydrophobia, you may be left somewhat unsatisfied. The build up was better than the conclusion.At this point, you might want to check out some of the extras on the DVD.

595006,A1SW80RQNB3DMK,B00005JL3T,EquesNiger,"[2, 3]","Father Graham is a disillusioned cleric with a ramshackle farm, two children, a mediocre former ball playing brother, and bitter memories of the tragic death of his wife when a driver falls asleep at the wheel. Whilst everyone else around him tries to move on, Graham (played by Gibson) clings desperately to his resentment, blaming God for taking his wife from him despite his role as a cleric in His service. The appearance of crop circles, and half-seen forms roving in and out of the farm's cornfields, confirm his lack of faith, until the final scenes of the film when he comes to realize that there are no coincidences.It never ceases to amaze me just how many people watched this film, and totally didn't get the message. I am the LAST person in the world to espouse feel-good Christian ideology, being about as Christian as Osama Bin Laden on a bad hair day and about as Orthodox in my approach to Spirituality as GW Bush is in his approach to Truth. Regardless, whether you agree with the ideology or not, the message is delivered in a profound and thought provoking way. One of the best points in the film is when Gibson, the ex-cleric, and Phoenix, the ex-baseball pro, are discussing the ""End of the World"". It sums up the entire message of the film:""People break down into two groups when the experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in Group number two are looking at those fourteen lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation isn't fifty-fifty. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there's a whole lot of people in the Group number one. When they see those fourteen lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?""As Spiritual as I considered myself to be, I realized that I fall into Group number two, and, considering the ramifications of it, I have to confess I wasn't too comfortable with it.So, why the ""ridiculous aliens that dissolve in water""? Did anyone count how many films with demons in them (or the title) came out in 2002? If Shyamalan had called these invaders demons, the message of the film would have been lost. He wants you to work for it a bit. Clearly, in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic theology, only God can fight demons. By obscuring their origins, or making it irrelevant, the message comes clearer. It's a parable of faith, and if demons existed, well, there had to be a God, as well, didn't there? Therefore having faith is a foregone conclusion in the circumstances. By making the villains less theological, but no less otherworldly, Shyamalan makes the question of faith under the circumstances less clear cut, but also more profound once it is made.I'm one of those folks who likes to watch movies that make me think. It doesn't matter whether the message is one I agree with. In fact, messages I haven't agreed with tend to be more interesting, since considering them expands my point of view. Shyamalan has taken a deep, profound and, frankly, terrifying message and wrapped it in a candy-coating, then in colorful cellophane. Regardless, if you take your time and get to the ""chewy middle"" of this one, you will find the message no less powerful than that of the Exorcist, though perhaps wholly more positive in note.",5,Profound if you get past the candy and look to the message,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,3901,"['Father', 'Graham', 'disillusioned', 'cleric', 'ramshackle', 'farm', 'two', 'children', 'mediocre', 'former', 'ball', 'playing', 'brother', 'bitter', 'memories', 'tragic', 'death', 'wife', 'when', 'driver', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'Whilst', 'everyone', 'else', 'move', 'Graham', 'played', 'Gibson', 'desperately', 'resentment', 'blaming', 'God', 'taking', 'wife', 'role', 'cleric', 'service', 'appearance', 'crop', 'circles', 'half-seen', 'forms', 'roving', 'farm', 'cornfields', 'confirm', 'lack', 'faith', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'coincidences.It', 'never', 'amaze', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'watched', 'film', 'totally', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'am', 'LAST', 'person', 'world', 'espouse', 'feel-good', 'Christian', 'ideology', 'being', 'as', 'Christian', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'as', 'Orthodox', 'approach', 'Spirituality', 'GW', 'Bush', 'approach', 'Truth', 'Regardless', 'agree', 'ideology', 'not', 'message', 'delivered', 'profound', 'thought', 'provoking', 'way', 'One', 'best', 'points', 'film', 'when', 'Gibson', 'ex-cleric', 'Phoenix', 'ex-baseball', 'pro', 'are', 'discussing', 'End', 'World', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'message', 'film', 'People', 'break', 'down', 'two', 'groups', 'when', 'experience', 'something', 'lucky', 'Group', 'number', 'one', 'more', 'luck', 'more', 'coincidence', 'see', 'sign', 'evidence', 'someone', 'up', 'there', 'watching', 'out', 'Group', 'number', 'two', 'just', 'pure', 'luck', 'Just', 'happy', 'turn', 'chance', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'Group', 'number', 'two', 'are', 'looking', 'fourteen', 'lights', 'very', 'suspicious', 'way', 'situation', ""n't"", 'fifty-fifty', 'Could', 'be', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'deep', 'down', 'feel', 'happens', ""'re"", 'own', 'fear', 'Yeah', 'are', 'people', 'whole', 'lot', 'people', 'Group', 'number', 'one', 'When', 'see', 'fourteen', 'lights', ""'re"", 'looking', 'miracle', 'deep', 'down', 'feel', 'going', 'happen', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'there', 'help', 'hope', 'See', 'what', 'have', 'ask', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'Are', 'kind', 'signs', 'sees', 'miracles', 'do', 'believe', 'people', 'just', 'get', 'lucky', 'look', 'question', 'way', 'possible', 'are', 'coincidences', 'As', 'Spiritual', 'considered', 'be', 'realized', 'fall', 'Group', 'number', 'two', 'considering', 'ramifications', 'have', 'confess', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'comfortable', 'it.So', 'why', 'ridiculous', 'aliens', 'dissolve', 'water', 'Did', 'anyone', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'demons', 'title', 'came', 'out', '2002', 'Shyamalan', 'had', 'called', 'invaders', 'demons', 'message', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'work', 'bit', 'Clearly', 'Judeo-Christian-Islamic', 'theology', 'only', 'God', 'can', 'fight', 'demons', 'obscuring', 'origins', 'making', 'irrelevant', 'message', 'clearer', 'parable', 'faith', 'demons', 'existed', 'well', 'had', 'be', 'God', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'there', 'Therefore', 'having', 'faith', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'circumstances', 'making', 'villains', 'less', 'theological', 'less', 'otherworldly', 'Shyamalan', 'question', 'faith', 'circumstances', 'clear', 'cut', 'also', 'more', 'profound', 'made.I', ""'m"", 'one', 'folks', 'who', 'likes', 'watch', 'movies', 'make', 'think', ""n't"", 'matter', 'message', 'one', 'agree', 'fact', 'messages', 'have', ""n't"", 'agreed', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'considering', 'expands', 'point', 'view', 'Shyamalan', 'taken', 'deep', 'profound', 'frankly', 'terrifying', 'message', 'wrapped', 'candy-coating', 'then', 'colorful', 'cellophane', 'Regardless', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'chewy', 'middle', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'message', 'less', 'powerful', 'Exorcist', 'perhaps', 'wholly', 'more', 'positive', 'note']",Signs

595010,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JL3T,Erik North,"[0, 3]","Having come up with a massive hit with THE SIXTH SENSE and then taken a few steps back with the bland UNBREAKABLE, writer/producer/director M. Nyght Shayamalan has re-emerged with a winning science fiction/suspense film in SIGNS.Mel Gibson stars as a priest in rural Pennsylvania who, because of the loss of his wife, has lost his faith and quit the church.  But when crop circles appear in his cornfield, his sheltered life with his children and his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) takes a weird turn.  As they continue to watch TV, they hear of more crop circles turning up all over the world until finally strange lights are spotted in the night skies over Mexico.  Gibson becomes more and more unglued and paranoid; and in the ensuing siege on his house, he must regain his faith to survive.Although it is still too early in the game to consider Shayamalan ""the next Spielberg"" (especially when the REAL Spielberg is still making superlative movies himself), SIGNS does show some of the Spielberg touches--suspense, shock effects, ordinary people and extraordinary circumstances.  Gibson gives one of his best performances as the priest whose confrontations with the alien forces see him regaining his faith but nearly losing his mind in a wash of paranoia.  As was the case in THE SIXTH SENSE, Shayamalan leaves little clues for the audience to follow as to how the story will eventually come out.

It had more of a plot than any other movie with Aliens in it has. It sure dominates ""It came from the sky"", and beats ""The day the earth stood still"", but I have to admit, both of those were pretty good for their times. This one sort of left the aliens in the shadows until it really needed to bring them out, and reveal their true nature. Then again, that's the purpose behind M. Night Shyamalan's genius.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is living a pretty strange life after his wife was killed in a mysterious car accident, but it is now the present time, 6 months later. His children (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) are under depression. His little girl, Bo, only drinking half a glass of water then saying it's contaminated. His brother of very few words (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to help by moving in with him, but maybe it's only making things worse.The matter changes when a mysterious crop circle appears in the family corn fields. Normally you'd shake this off, but one day later, over 50 crop circles appear all over India. It seems that someone is trying to prove a point by playing this perfectly executed prank, but the problem doesn't stop there. It seems as though people are making sightings of strange creatures just barely after the events of the crop circles, and it doesn't look like they want to leave.The acting in this one was great. The kid actors did a very good job, especially Abigail Breslin who played little Bo Hess. She's so precious. There was something about Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix that made them show their acting talents, even though it didn't seem like they were doing much, but it was great acting on everyone's part, maybe Rory Culkin just a little bit less, but he did good also. Probably runs in the famous Culkin family.The DVD was certainly entertaining escpecially with the deleted scenes. I always like to see DVD's with special features like that. Even M. Night Shyamalans first scary movie that he ever made when he was a kid. Seriously, how many people can say they started making movies as a kid? Not many, and it's surprising to see these, and they're actually pretty funny.What I liked about the movie the best were the aliens. You never even see them until the ending. You don't even need to see them just to know they're there, that what was what kept me watching it till the end. It truly did scare to think they might be hiding in the darkness someday. They could just as well exist. Definetelty not a movie to pass up.

Exactly which celestial trailer park did these aliens emigrate from?But again, this movie isn't about aliens, it's about losing one's religion, only to gain it back again throughthe understanding of how even the most traumatic events are actually teachable moments designed to makeus stronger and more resilient.

595017,A2UBS120XE605X,B00005JL3T,Frank Paris,"[3, 9]","Warning: spoiler. Only read this review if you've already seen the movie.I don't believe this is SCIENCE fiction. At best, it is fantasy. Water does the aliens in. That in itself is completely preposterous. Water is pervasive in the universe and it is inconceivable that creatures who live at ""room temperature"" (Earthly ""rooms"") would be destroyed by water. All creatures from wherever they are in the universe who could walk the Earth without ""space suits"" would depend on water for their very existence. So introducing that concept is just the ""War of the Worlds"" device used to get rid of the aliens and save the world. Because of that, the fact that this is an ""alien invasion"" movie is almost irrelevant. What's left is simply wrong-headed.So at best the details of the aliens are irrelevant to what this movie has to say, which to me is simply blasphemous. What I don't like about it are the religious implications of the nature of God, as if God would cause great suffering in the past so that people could be redeemed in the future. If God is like this, then Gibson's loss of faith in God when his wife dies in a senseless accident is justified, and it's absurd that he regains his faith when later circumstances ""prove"" the necessity of his earlier loss. It's inconceivable to me that God manipulates events to teach people a lesson so they'll be better off later in life. What about the people who suffer and die in the ""lesson""? I cannot believe that a God with unlimited perspective on things who understands every nuance of existence would ever act this way. Besides, there's absolutely no scientific evidence that God could ""cause"" accidents to occur. That is a concept of God that became incredible with the science of the 20th century.It's better to realize that however God might be, he has no powers of efficient cause in the world. Science refutes that possibility. The only role available to him is as a psychological persuasive force in competition with all of the ""demonic"" forces in the world, and that it is precisely limited perspective that is demonic. The wider your perspective, the better is your chance of understanding what God wants you to do. But the premise of this movie is that God causes tragedy and death for the benefit of those who live on. This means of course that God is the cause of evil in the world. It would be irrational to worship such a God, anymore than it would be rational to love any Great Leader with unlimited power, like Hitler or Stalin. Sure, some people under the unimaginably cruel rule of the Great Leader persuaded themselves that they loved their Great Leader. But it is beneath human dignity to succumb to such temptations.

The whole alien invasion plot is not the plot.  The plot is one man's failure of faith and what happens to renew that faith.  This is a movie about how the universe works in mysterious ways and how all things are connected...not a movie about crop circles and aliens and the threat of invasion by forces from another planet.This movie might as well have been about an invasion of squirrels from another dimension as aliens from another planet.  That was not and is not the point of the movie so there's little to be gained from pointing out plot holes regarding the aliens.  Because this not what this movie is about.That being said, the first time I saw the movie I didn't get it and I saw the same plot holes and was a bit spooked by the aliens, but overall not too impressed...right up until the end of the movie, when it finally dawned on me that the movie I was watching wasn't the movie I thought I was watching.  Which is completely and utterly brilliant!  I sat up and grinned madly and was completely enthralled by the realization of what the movie was really saying!Mel Gibson plays a religious man who falls from faith due to the death of his wife.  He and his kids and his brother--who lives with them in the farmhouse--have been wrapped up in pain and loss and disappointment ever since.  His brother never made anything of himself re baseball and regrets it.  His kids have physical and psychological issues that their father can't deal with.  Then a crop circle appears, there is ""something"" running around in the cornfields...and they find themselves under attack in their own home (while they get occasional tidbits of info that the whole world is under attack).There are quite a few spooky moments in this movie, so its not one for younger kids.

The circles test Hess's faith as he attempts to find out the truth behind them.Mel Gibson gives what is perhaps his best performance as a damaged father trying to do what he has come to believe is best for his children. Joaquin Phoenix, in quite a turn from his Oscar nominated performance as the antagonist in Gladiator, provides some humorous comic relief.This is a minimalist thriller. As repeatedly demonstrated by Hitchcock, and to a lesser extent Spielberg, what you don't see can be far more intense than what you do see. Director M. Night Shyamalan takes this to heart and uses lighting and sound to their full, suspenseful potential to indicate the presence of an other-worldly menace. James Newton Howard's Herrmann-esque musical score also adds greatly to the tension and mood.Signs falls apart during its outrageous finale that also tends to be unintentionally funny, and in my opinion, anti-climatic.

595024,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JL3T,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films.  Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style.  Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield.  He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities.  But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.The small cast is extremely, extremely good.  I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown tremendously since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well.  Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.What isn't flawless is the story.  The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick.  I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed.  There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark.

595025,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005JL3T,General Zombie,"[38, 47]","It's interesting, I'd always liked this movie a lot, but watching it again after a 3 year layoff I finally see just how extraordinarily well done this is. I've watched a helluva lot of horror movies in the past 3 years, and watching this again I really see how it's on a completely different level from the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating a slow rise in tension and simply inserting the supernatural into the apparently real world 'Signs' has few peers. This relates to a small flaw, perhaps: Once we get to the climax, once we've seen all there is to see, the reality proves a little too mundane. But, the strength of the journey itself more than makes up for this slight anticlimax.  This is definitely one of the very best horror movies of the new millenium.I've heard some complain that the film lacks sight of the big picture due to its exclusive emphasis on the central family but I think that's what really makes it work, what really makes it real. After all, who cares about the big picture? We don't experience the world as a city or nation, we do it as individuals. That and it just allows us to really get to know the characters, and for Shyamalan to create full, real characters rather than just having a pack of cliches in various cities spread out across the nation. (Like you'd see in something like 'Deep Impact', for example.) Phoenix and Gibson are both absolutely great in this film, particularly Phoenix. Gibson's Graham is a little to cold and distant for us to relate to him initially, so we really connect with Phoenix's Merrill first, though I definitely came around to liking Graham as the movie went on. They're both utterly naturalistic, and manage a real severe intensity in the most emotional scenes while still avoiding any histrionics. The two children, Culkin and Breslin, are fine. I'm always leery of children having prominent roles in movies, but Shyamalan largely avoids sentimentalizing them excessively (Morgan is kind of a whiny dork) or earning cheap audience identification. (In the scenes where the kids are in the greatest peril I identified far more with Graham then with the children themselves.)Certainly, this won't be to everyone's taste as it is extremely low key up until the very end. And I don't mean this simply in the sense that it isn't violent or gory; that's true of a lot of modern horror films. The film simply refuses to show you much of anything through out the vast majority of the run time. There's a lot of noise related horror, obviously, and it goes light on the jump scares. (More amazingly, some of these scare tactics were actually surprising. Even after having seen it a couple of time before a few years back a couple of these were slightly surprising.) The film uses a particularly classic setting, the old siege on the farmhouse a la 'Night of the Living Dead'. Again, the primary siege is just so impressive because it manages real intensity despite the fact that they show you virtually nothing. The true climax is less effective, but it's still fine and is necessary from a thematic standpoint.  Many people  have complained about the `twist' in this film. I've got some news for you: This movie doesn't have a twist.  Morons.In the end, however, it may be the human element that really makes this movie standout.  It's just a very tragic portrait of a family that has largely fallen apart. I'll admit it, it probably goes a little to far a couple of times, but it also manages a few genuinely moving scenes, which more than compensates. (Particularly note the great scene of Graham and Merrill discussing fate late one night, and Merrill's confronting Graham after the invasion night and so on.) As I always say, I don't really insist that my movies have realistic or likable characters, but the very best ones usually do. And 'Signs' has got that. Furthermore, Shyamalan's dialogue is generally leaps and bounds beyond what you usually see in a horror film, and it's also really quite funny much of the time.I've heard a lot of morons complain that the aliens here don't behave in a realistic fashion.  I had a long-winded rant worked out in my mind, but these people aren't gonna be convinced by that, or anything, as a matter of fact, so I'll just keep it simple:  It's absurd to claim that the aliens in this behave in an unrealistic fashion because we, the viewer, don't know anything about them.  There are an infinite number of potential explanations for why they act as they do, and 0 reasons to believe they would behave any other way.  Any supposed logic you may have come up with relating to the aliens is irrelevant, because they are wholly of and within the movie.  And perhaps more to the point, this comes with the territory.  Complaining about the aliens in this film is like complaining about how hardly anybody has any guns in a contemporary martial-arts film.Yes this is a great film. Definitely Shyamalan's best in my mind, as of this moment.Grade: A",5,Masterful Low-Key Horror,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,4964,"['interesting', ""'d"", 'always', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'watching', 'again', '3', 'year', 'layoff', 'finally', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'done', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'helluva', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', '3', 'years', 'watching', 'again', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'completely', 'different', 'level', 'vast', 'majority', 'When', 'creating', 'slow', 'rise', 'tension', 'simply', 'inserting', 'supernatural', 'apparently', 'real', 'world', ""'Signs"", 'few', 'peers', 'small', 'flaw', 'perhaps', 'Once', 'get', 'climax', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'see', 'reality', 'little', 'too', 'mundane', 'strength', 'journey', 'more', 'up', 'slight', 'anticlimax', 'definitely', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'new', 'millenium.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'complain', 'film', 'sight', 'big', 'picture', 'due', 'exclusive', 'emphasis', 'central', 'family', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'work', 'what', 'really', 'real', 'who', 'big', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'world', 'city', 'nation', 'do', 'individuals', 'just', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'Shyamalan', 'create', 'full', 'real', 'characters', 'rather', 'just', 'having', 'pack', 'cliches', 'various', 'cities', 'spread', 'out', 'nation', ""'d"", 'see', 'something', ""'Deep"", 'Impact', 'example', 'Phoenix', 'Gibson', 'are', 'absolutely', 'great', 'film', 'particularly', 'Phoenix', 'Gibson', 'Graham', 'little', 'cold', 'distant', 'relate', 'initially', 'really', 'connect', 'Phoenix', 'Merrill', 'first', 'definitely', 'came', 'liking', 'Graham', 'movie', 'went', ""'re"", 'utterly', 'naturalistic', 'manage', 'real', 'severe', 'intensity', 'most', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'still', 'avoiding', 'histrionics', 'two', 'children', 'Culkin', 'Breslin', 'are', 'fine', ""'m"", 'always', 'leery', 'children', 'having', 'prominent', 'roles', 'movies', 'Shyamalan', 'largely', 'sentimentalizing', 'excessively', 'Morgan', 'kind', 'whiny', 'dork', 'earning', 'cheap', 'audience', 'identification', 'scenes', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'greatest', 'peril', 'identified', 'far', 'more', 'Graham', 'then', 'children', 'Certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'extremely', 'low', 'key', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'simply', 'sense', ""n't"", 'violent', 'gory', 'true', 'lot', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'film', 'simply', 'show', 'much', 'anything', 'vast', 'majority', 'run', 'time', 'lot', 'noise', 'related', 'horror', 'obviously', 'light', 'jump', 'scares', 'More', 'amazingly', 'scare', 'tactics', 'were', 'actually', 'surprising', 'Even', 'having', 'seen', 'couple', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'couple', 'were', 'slightly', 'surprising', 'film', 'particularly', 'classic', 'setting', 'old', 'siege', 'farmhouse', 'la', ""'Night"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'Again', 'primary', 'siege', 'just', 'so', 'impressive', 'real', 'intensity', 'fact', 'show', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'true', 'climax', 'less', 'effective', 'still', 'fine', 'necessary', 'thematic', 'standpoint', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'twist', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'news', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'twist', 'Morons.In', 'end', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'human', 'element', 'really', 'movie', 'standout', 'just', 'very', 'tragic', 'portrait', 'family', 'largely', 'fallen', 'apart', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'probably', 'little', 'far', 'couple', 'times', 'also', 'few', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'scenes', 'more', 'compensates', 'Particularly', 'note', 'great', 'scene', 'Graham', 'Merrill', 'discussing', 'fate', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'Merrill', 'confronting', 'Graham', 'invasion', 'night', 'so', 'always', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'insist', 'movies', 'have', 'realistic', 'likable', 'characters', 'very', 'best', 'ones', 'usually', 'do', 'got', 'Furthermore', 'Shyamalan', 'dialogue', 'generally', 'leaps', 'what', 'usually', 'see', 'horror', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'quite', 'funny', 'much', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'morons', 'complain', 'aliens', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'had', 'long-winded', 'rant', 'worked', 'out', 'mind', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'gon', 'be', 'convinced', 'anything', 'matter', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'just', 'keep', 'simple', 'absurd', 'claim', 'aliens', 'behave', 'unrealistic', 'fashion', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'are', 'infinite', 'number', 'potential', 'explanations', 'why', 'act', 'do', '0', 'reasons', 'believe', 'would', 'behave', 'other', 'way', 'supposed', 'logic', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'relating', 'aliens', 'irrelevant', 'are', 'wholly', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'more', 'point', 'territory', 'Complaining', 'aliens', 'film', 'complaining', 'how', 'hardly', 'anybody', 'guns', 'contemporary', 'martial-arts', 'film.Yes', 'great', 'film', 'Definitely', 'Shyamalan', 'best', 'mind', 'moment.Grade']",Signs

It delivers the chills and the suspense that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, but ""Unbreakable"" did not.Mel Gibson would never have been my candidate (years ago) for an actor with ""legs"" (the ability to extend his career to the length and breadth that he has), but, man, he has proved me wrong.  Gibson is truly a chameleon actor - able to allow his characters to envelope his being.Joaquin Phoenix, also, would never have been someone I thought would have any potential for a strong career as an actor.  I thought that his career would rise and fall due to his late brother's fame and talent.  Apparently, those Phoenixs are better actors than I gave them credit, because Joaquin is really a fine actor.I think everyone actually knows the premise of the story, but here goes:  Crop circles are popping up all over the world and some have popped up in Mel Gibson's corn fields too.  Gibson is a recent widower and father of two, whose younger brother (Phoenix - a former promising minor league baseball player) has come to live with Gibson and family to help out.  Together, the family weathers the bizarre events that begin to unfold after the appearance of the crop circles.  Is it aliens?  As told here - yes - And how!""Signs"" is a ""War of the Worlds for the modern era.  It's ""Indepedence Day"" without all the explosions and CGI.  Don't get me wrong - it's a good movie and I think it would be hard to truly be unique in this genre as it is now well covered territory in the shadow of a myriad of films and television shows on the subject matter, including ""The X-Files"".What ""Signs"" does well is bring the whole genre back down into a more familial setting and turn up the tension by making it a 'haunted house' movie, so to speak.  We aren't subjected to, or fascinated by long detailed shots of the aliens, but rather see them out of the sides of our eyes (as it were) - in the shadows - and in reflections.

I took one look and stereotyped it as a typical aliens-take-over-the-world kind of movie. My birthday came and we arrived at the theatre, not knowing what to see. This was one of the few movies that was playing and remembering great reviews I had heard about it, we went in to see it. I remember sitting in my seat, petrified at times, and laughing at others. What makes this movie great, is the fact that it plays with your mind, leaving extremely tense edge-of-your-seat suspense. Earlier on in the film, you see some shadowy, grainy looking pictures of these aliens, but they really appear too fast to know what to make of them. You keep wondering, ""Are these guys friendly? What do they look like?"" This is the recipe that keeps this movie alive. I remember walking out of the theatre with my friends and just being blown away by everything.The DVD, is above average, not the best, but it works. I like how they contained M. Night's previous alien ""movie."" Everything is good here, except the fact that there is no theatrical trailer. Despite the fact that the trailer was really telling nothing about the film and was misleading, I still think it should have been included. Some people have mentioned that this movie is just a ""fun popcorn movie,"" and it is, but there's more below the surface.

595032,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005JL3T,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[1, 1]","M.Night Shyamalan is a director with great style. His visions are unique. His focus is always fresh, and clear. Like Spielberg, he tackles various genre, and he is able to wring out new perspective; and he uses children as a primary vehicle to inhabit the world both with a sense of wonder and fear. Much has been written about the lapses of logic in this film, yet I find its stylistic flair masks its imperfections perfectly.Shyamalan has woven a nightmare for us, pregnant with primal fears and suspensful moments; and like any other bad dream, certain things are out of balance. We, as the viewers don't realize the director's intent and perspective. We respond literally, and certain questions nag us.... why don't the Hess boys own a gun ? Why don't the aliens know more about the dangers of earth's environment ? Haven't the armies of the earth mobilized to fight them, and if so, what are the results ? Why don't the aliens use more technology to attack us ? And we wonder is this an actual weakness in the writing, or do we expect too much, have seen too much F/X laden Sci-Fi, loaded with pyrotechnics ? Reviewers seem conficted on these points. I tended to enjoy the film, praising the performances, and was propelled along on the crest of emotion as this family faced its peril.Mel Gibson, as lapsed minister Graham Hess, gives a heartfelt performance that reminds us what a fine actor he really is. His humanity, his doubts and fears, just leap off the screen. When he converses with his wife, as she is dying, love is wrenched from his grasp, torn from his chest. He is left with an inability to continue to believe in God, and a deep despair that grips him like a choke collar. Later, when he is holding his son in the basement, while the boy is having an asthma attack, one can see clearly that Mel, as an actual parent, intensily loves his own children.Joaquin Phoenix was very effective as the brother Merrill. He filled in the strength that Mel needed, to continue on the farm, to raise his children, and to fight against the alien menance that threatened to destroy them. Rory Culkin as Morgan, the son, was likewise quite good. His intellect and bravery, gave us a tiny hero to cheer for, and to pray for. Abigail Breslin, as Bo the daughter, was wonderful. She is a beautiful child, secure in her naturalness, and strangely calm as the hectic drama swirled about her. Cherry Jones, as officer Paski, brought dignity and warmth to the role of the local constabulary. It was refreshing to see a woman in this role.Principally, this is a 1950's invasion film, just cloaked in a modern perspective. There is no Spielberg sweetness and benevolence dropping on us from the night sky; rather these aliens are the stuff of 1930's pulp fiction and B movies. The aliens are out to conquer and harm. They are the bogeymen, and the things that howl and go bump in the night, staring through our windows, and running across our rooves. And they are the stuff of allegory and prophecy and symbolism. There are myriads of layers within this black dream.

Night Shyamalan would do something new and interesting with the genre but really it irked me on a number of levels.  Hopefully I won't give away any spoilers here but apologies in advance if I do.1. The premise, why would super advanced alien beings capable of interstellar travel invade a planet where the substance that they are extremely vulnerable to covers 70% of that planet's surface?  Not that smart for such an advanced race of beings.2. Why should a young kid conveniently know everything there is to know about a race of super advanced star-people?  I understand the whole ""creepy kid"" thing is a bit of a tradition in the suspense movie genre but I wasn't really sold in this case.3. Why did the director chose to cast himself in such a prominent role? For those who didn't spot him, M. Night Shyamalan plays the part of Ray Reedy the vet / doctor who is responsible for the car accident which claimed the life of the wife of Mel Gibson's character.  Not that he did a bad job, but it did seem a little self-indulgent.4. If your home was being invaded by anyone, especially Little Green Men, why would you proceed to beat one of them up, lock it in your kitchen pantry and then blag to your curious neighbour about it?5. M. Night Shyamalan did such a good job of building up tension by keeping the creatures lurking in the shadows and only showing them in silhouette.  Why would you shatter all that suspense and tension but then showing your bad guys walking around in broad daylight?  This in particular really ruined the movie for me.  I am a firm believer that less is more when it comes to this kind of movie. Let the audience's imagination run wild trying to guess what you mystery baddy is rather than exposing it to the world and losing all the shock value.  Compare for example the effectiveness and impact of the scene in the coal cellar when compared to the rather cheap shock of the movies final confrontation.This is not to say that I thought this movie was all bad.  The acting was at least of reasonable standard, with the two child actor standing out and Mr Phoenix being his reliable self.  And the direction was OK, most of gripes are with the story itself.It's nowhere near as suspenseful or satisfying as Sixth Sense, it's not even as good as Unbreakable, it's definitely not M.

Part philosophizing, part science fiction (or is it about the supernatural instead? heh, heh), part horror, part ... in the end, the best description is suspense, because a good part of the movie is ""guess what the plot is really about"" - not necessarily a bad thing.I've read a lot of complaints about the film (although most critics liked it), but I'm convinced the complainants were simply not paying attention - strange, because although this film is relatively slow-paced (just a little faster than Unbreakable), you'll be glued to the screen. The script is well written and you'll be constantly wondering where the plot is going, what Mr. Shyamalan is trying to say. Is it about groundless paranoia? Will the military foolishly start a war? Are the strange creatures benevolent, malevolent, not aliens at all?There seem to be two kinds of critics complaining about the film. The first kind does not get what the film is really about. They complain it's not great science fiction, that the plot devolves into chasing aliens, and so on. But these complaints only reveal that they have failed to grasp what this film is about.  Get this straight - it's not a science fiction movie. The sci-fi element is only there to provide a framework for the story, the means of telling a parable.The second kind of critic gets the point of the film, but does not like it at all. Ironically, this is also what the film is about: denial.At the core is a story about a pastor (Mel Gibson), someone whose whole life concerns faith, undergoing a crisis of faith - a battle which, at the outset, he has in fact lost - and the effects of that bitterness on himself and his family. (This leads to a couple of emotional outbursts which can be unsettling to younger viewers.) We are led to ask: does God really preside over our most painful moments? How could there possibly a good reason for some tragic, even horrific, events?Then strange things begin to happen which seem at first to have no relation to this plot whatsoever. Strange figures scamper around his homestead. Crop circles appear in his cornfields. His dogs have a hard time of it. What is happening? Thus begins Mr. Shyamalan's roundabout journey about faith, despair, life's meaning (or the lack thereof), denial, and hope, seasoned with dashes of fright and suspense.In the first part of the film, the ex-pastor , Father Hess, explains that he has lost his faith because of a terrible accident, in which a loved one's dying words open his eyes to the meaninglessness and randomness of life. But at the end, we see that he has not been entirely honest with himself, and it is this realization that could be their salvation. So another message of this movie is that unbelief is not necessarily a choice born of reason but from bitterness, a choice which can thereafter radically skew our view of reality.There is also an interesting dialogue between the main character and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) concerning ""two groups of people,"" and how their outlook on life affects their lives. The clarity of this exchange will be disturbing to those who deny God yet continue to live as though their lives can still have meaning, trying to drown out the logical conclusion of their views: absurdity and hopelessness.The characters are interesting and sympathetic, with the kids providing comedy in their serious, childlike way. A tragic death is described and partially shown without graphic detail or gore; as mentioned above, there are a couple of intense emotional flashes. An extraterrestrial being loses a couple of fingers.All in all, an interesting movie which will provide some chills and moments to kick off philosophical discussions.",4,Gripping and thought-provoking,1042588800,"01 15, 2003",2003,3774,"['Cliff', 'Notes', 'Signs', 'Movie', 'MusingsM', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'film', 'hard', 'categorize', 'Part', 'philosophizing', 'part', 'science', 'fiction', 'supernatural', 'instead', 'heh', 'heh', 'part', 'horror', 'part', 'end', 'best', 'description', 'suspense', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'guess', 'what', 'plot', 'really', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'complaints', 'film', 'most', 'critics', 'liked', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'complainants', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'strange', 'film', 'relatively', 'slow-paced', 'just', 'little', 'faster', 'Unbreakable', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'script', 'well', 'written', ""'ll"", 'be', 'constantly', 'wondering', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'trying', 'say', 'groundless', 'paranoia', 'Will', 'military', 'foolishly', 'start', 'war', 'Are', 'strange', 'creatures', 'benevolent', 'malevolent', 'not', 'aliens', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'kinds', 'critics', 'complaining', 'film', 'first', 'kind', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'complain', 'not', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'plot', 'chasing', 'aliens', 'so', 'complaints', 'only', 'reveal', 'have', 'failed', 'grasp', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'Get', 'straight', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'element', 'only', 'there', 'provide', 'framework', 'story', 'means', 'telling', 'parable.The', 'second', 'kind', 'critic', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'like', 'Ironically', 'also', 'what', 'film', 'denial.At', 'core', 'story', 'pastor', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'someone', 'whole', 'life', 'concerns', 'faith', 'undergoing', 'crisis', 'faith', 'battle', 'outset', 'fact', 'lost', 'effects', 'bitterness', 'family', 'couple', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'can', 'be', 'unsettling', 'younger', 'viewers', 'are', 'led', 'ask', 'God', 'really', 'preside', 'most', 'painful', 'moments', 'How', 'could', 'there', 'possibly', 'good', 'reason', 'tragic', 'even', 'horrific', 'events', 'Then', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'seem', 'first', 'have', 'relation', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'Strange', 'figures', 'scamper', 'homestead', 'Crop', 'circles', 'appear', 'cornfields', 'dogs', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'What', 'happening', 'Thus', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'roundabout', 'journey', 'faith', 'despair', 'life', 'meaning', 'lack', 'thereof', 'denial', 'hope', 'seasoned', 'dashes', 'fright', 'suspense.In', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'ex-pastor', 'Father', 'Hess', 'lost', 'faith', 'terrible', 'accident', 'loved', 'one', 'dying', 'words', 'open', 'eyes', 'meaninglessness', 'randomness', 'life', 'end', 'see', 'not', 'been', 'entirely', 'honest', 'realization', 'could', 'be', 'salvation', 'So', 'message', 'movie', 'unbelief', 'not', 'necessarily', 'choice', 'born', 'reason', 'bitterness', 'choice', 'can', 'thereafter', 'radically', 'skew', 'view', 'reality.There', 'also', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'main', 'character', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'concerning', 'two', 'groups', 'people', 'how', 'outlook', 'life', 'affects', 'lives', 'clarity', 'exchange', 'will', 'be', 'disturbing', 'who', 'deny', 'God', 'yet', 'continue', 'live', 'lives', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'meaning', 'trying', 'drown', 'out', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'views', 'absurdity', 'hopelessness.The', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'kids', 'providing', 'comedy', 'serious', 'childlike', 'way', 'tragic', 'death', 'described', 'partially', 'shown', 'graphic', 'detail', 'gore', 'mentioned', 'are', 'couple', 'intense', 'emotional', 'flashes', 'extraterrestrial', 'being', 'couple', 'fingers.All', 'interesting', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'chills', 'moments', 'kick', 'off', 'philosophical', 'discussions']",Signs

595041,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JL3T,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","Back when M. Night Shamalamadingdong was still thought of as a Hollywood wunderkind, SIGNS, followingThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)andUnbreakable (Two-Disc Vista Series), merely reaffirmed the man's cinematic creds. Donning our Hindsight-Is-20/20 Goggles, we note thatThe Village (Widescreen Vista Series)came along afterwards and began to elicit them doubts, them doubts. But, for now, we're focusing on SIGNS, a pretty terrific psychological thriller.If you haven't seen this movie before, you're in for something different, and I mean that in a good way. SIGNS, dual meaning noted, is one of those films where the less you know about it, going in, the better the viewing experience. The premise, in bare bones, centers on a grieving family living in a desolate Pennsylvanian farmhouse and the strange things which begin to happen to them. Okay, here's a minor spoiler: It begins with the family patriarch nosing around in the cornfields and chancing upon inexplicable crop circles.Fear works best when cultivated in the mind. Hitchcock knew this, and Shyamalan, eagerly borrowing a page from the Master of Suspense, manipulates the viewer's imagination and invites the brain to wander into all those dark scary places. In SIGNS, the horror is sparing in its physical manifestations. The scenes unveil in restrained fashion. Shyamalan allows the tension to build, utilizing an unsettling score, an unexpected noise here, a fleeting movement there. Above all, Shyamalan makes use of his very, very good actors to lay down a groundwork of uneasiness. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and the kids are very good, their characters coming off as uncomfortable in their skins and just a bit disturbing. In probing the psychological scars of this troubled family, Shyamalan also paves the way for their salvation. Made captive to the brooding atmosphere, I jumped at every turn and kept waiting, just waiting, for that nasty somehing to come tap-tap-tap on the bedroom window. So effective is the film in generating that eerie mood that when the bogeyman finally does appear in all its glory, I actually felt a pang of letdown. To quote Peggy Lee: ""Is that all there is?"" But the build up was so good!Not to say that there aren't several genuine jump-in-your-seat moments. Wait for the pantry sequence and wait for that video tape from Brazil. They're good for ambushing that peace of mind.I dig the offbeat vibe. I won't mention the context, but there's a baby monitor, tin foil, and half-empty glasses of water which all play key roles to the plot. SIGNS also breaks into metaphysical ground and meditates on the power of belief and faith and the interconnectivity of things. Something in my brain clicked, satisfyingly, when, near the end, the ex-reverend instructs the ex-baseball player to ""Swing away, Merrill."" Aha, I thought. That's what that was all about!In watching SIGNS, in experiencing this quiet creeping up of terror, you could see why the movie world was lauding Shyamalan so effusively. After thrilling to this one years ago, I couldn't wait to see what Shyamalan had next in store. But we won't talk about THE VILLAGE, okay?",4,"""There's a monster outside my room.

595051,AOIPPEZ66R2UP,B00005JL3T,"Into ""voidness""","[6, 12]","Close Encounters meets Field of Dreams?Yikes! I normally feel that there are very few works, of any kind, that deserve one star...but I just couldn't justify giving this two. This was just a REALLY BAD MOVIE! Sixth Sense was pretty good, although IMO it was let down a little let with the casting of Bruce Willis in the lead (don't have much against Willis, just thought he was all wrong for that part); Unbreakable was asinine; in its own way, Signs might've been even worse. It's not just a matter of this movie being ""oversold"" by friends, relatives, acquaintences, and some reviews--I would've thought it was dumb anyway.1) The movie was hyped to be more about the crop circles than it really was. After the first part of the movie, the whole crop circle angle essentially dropped out of sight. If the crop circles were going to be used to set up the plot, it seems like it would've made sense to provide a bit more information about their purpose, other than to just have the omnipresent TV voice say they might be some sort of navigation device. You go to the trouble of showing all of these elaborate designs, including using them in all of the publicity for the movie, and then don't provide more info about them? Kind of like a little ""bait and switch,"" almost. I'm not really much into crop circles or UFO's, but I think that most of the people who saw this movie were pulled in by the whole crop circle angle, yet this was just one of one of the many story elements that were not fully developed in this film.2) The chain of foreshadowing, revealed at the end of the movie, was really a strecth, much more so than either of M. Night's two earlier movies (even the fragile Unbreakable). I think it's time for him to abandon this whole device. It's the kind of plot device that really only works in a one or two movies, anyway...but for the whole thing to be set up by the dying wife uttering, ""Swing away, Merrill?"" Then the daughter's leaving half-full (or half-empty, if you prefer) glasses of water lying around turn out to be a vehicle for the ""alien's"" (and I'll get to them in a minute) demise? Then the son's asthma ends up saving his life.This film takes the whole, ""everything happens for a reason,"" concept (which I happen to believe BTW), and hits the viewer over the head with it (no pun intended) in the most unsubtle ways. So we're supposed to buy that the minister's wife goes out for a walk before dinner, so that the vet (played by M. Night himself, apparently representing the eastern mystic ""[SUV]ehicle"" for the events to unfold) could fall asleep at the wheel and smash her into a tree, so that she could have the ""Swing away, Merrill"" prophecy, that would help to save the rest of the family? And, correspondingly, the minister's brother's not being able to lay off a bad pitch was also a vehicle for the rest of the family to be saved? I am a Buddhist, but I am unable to ""suspend my disbelief"" enough to buy this implausible ""karma chain."" This all just seemed dumb, dumber, dumbest, to me. A sixth grader could write a better screenplay than this.3) A fifth grader could come up with more original ""aliens"" than these. Spider men who shot poison gas out of their wrists instead of webs. Also, the whole hostile alien thing has been way overdone in movies for like half a century now. If we're going to continue to make ""little green, or gray, or plaid, men"" movies, Let's try to be a little more original with their appearance--and their motives for traveling across the universe to visit this little green and blue planet. The whole chameleon thing was a dumb idea, too. I almost laughed out loud when the alien's arm matched the pattern on the kid's shirt.4) The acting left something to be desired, too, even Gibson's melodramatic performance (as an aside, I like Mel Gibson, but I'm already getting a bit tired of him using his film career to push his faith in less than subtle fashion, i.e. this role, and his upcoming Christ movie). Certainly not the first time in film history that the kids stole the show in a movie. The worst performance may have been from the woman who played the sheriff.5) Another thing I just thought of, on the subject of faith. I'm sorry but, ""crisis of faith,"" or not, what daddy--let alone an ex-minister--would deny his young son a prayer at the dinner table, especially when they all think the world's about to come to an end? He lets him have french toast and mashed potatoes for his ""last supper,"" but he can't muster up one last prayer? Sorry, I'm not buying that for a minute. That whole dinner table seen was really dumb, esp. Gibson's part.6) The usually weak and oddly placed injections of humor frequently undermined the already tenuous current of tension in the movie.7) I completely disagree with the reviewer who thought the last 15-20 minutes was so great: I thought this was one of the weakest resolutions I've ever seen in a suspense movie.8) From what I had heard about the movie, I was expecting a spiritual element to the resolution; but something better than ""minsister loses faith when wife dies...then regains his faith after his brother, and a few half glasses of water, kill an alien to save the rest of his family.""Bottom line: this movie built up a lot of expectations, both in the publicity for it, and during the movie itself...and it didn't deliver on any of them.

595052,A5TUY9IFBKNOK,B00005JL3T,"Isabelle ""isabellec""","[4, 5]","I think this is my all-time favorite movie.  I honestly don't know what everyone is complaining about.  This movie is suspenseful, perfectly executed, and its' simple theme of faith and hope and the importance of family and forgiveness is beautiful.  Forget the stupid aliens who reacted so badly to water and yet decided to invade a planet made up of 3/4 water; the aliens are a mere afterthought to what the film is really about.The real twist at the end of the film is that there isn't one!  I know I was fooled, thinking all along that it all just HAD to be a hoax, somehow, until the family left the basement.  And there were plenty of times I jumped in my seat in startelment.  We see only quick glimpses of the antagonists (the aliens) in this, but that's enough; somehow its' even more ominous because the imagination can provide far more scarier images than what can be shown on screen.  The music was also very good, the same 3 notes providing a background of tenseness and acute hyper awareness and expectation.Most of all, though, the circle of people that was the Hess family, Graham (Mel Gibson, my favorite actor), a recently widowed Episcopalian priest who recently left his church due to a crisis of faith; Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, my second favorite actor), a washed-up minor league baseball player in his early twenties, the younger brother of Graham (by about 18 years) who moved in with the family after the death of Graham's wife Colleen; and the two children, asthmatic Morgan and water-idiocyncratic Bo.  The level of devotion, protectiveness and caring for each family member was palpable; I could truly believe this was a real family.  And each of these people's distinctive traits wound up to all be for a reason.  The entire theme of the movie was like a sack with a drawstring tie that slowly pulled closed and tightened together until it was closed by the end of the movie, in a very satisfying, comforting manner.The performances of each cast member was flawless, and there were some wonderful moments of humor and silliness to offset the intensity. (Both Gibson and Phoenix have demonstrated their talents for dry wit and comedy before and used it in sparing doses in this.) I think my favorite scene was the ""Last Supper"", where they all went from tears and anger and impending doom and dread to simple re-affirmation of each one's love for each other.(And they all managed to do it without getting too sappy about it.) The moment when a sobbing Graham, surrounded by his two distraught children, pulls his weeping brother Merrill into their hug was both funny and very touching and poignant.Even the children did very well, bright and precocious without ever slipping into overly cutesy or bratty.I liked the extra ""Making Of"" feature and especially the deleted scenes; there was one in particular I really wish that would have been kept, where Merrill tries to block the attic door from the aliens and Graham tells him the story of when he, Graham, accidentally broke Merrill's arm when Merrill was 2 1/2.This is a movie I am able to watch multiple times without losing interest. It's well done all around with a little something of everything, and highly recommended.",5,Classic!  The very best of the best of M.

Terribly unconvincing acting by Mr. Mel Gibson, one of the worst performances he's ever turned out. But what can you expect from him with this kind of script? His character is a two-dimensional mess. A widower reverend, who saves the world from aliens. That's about it. There's no real connection. And if you tell me the movie isn't really about aliens but about faith and Christian love and whatnot, I'll tell you plainly to shut up. It's a sci-fi movie, and it's bad sci-fi. If you consider it as a family movie it's even worse. Joaquin Phoenix, remembered fondly from Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, is wasted. And the kids were even more irritatingly cute than Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense - if that's possible. We got mediocre directing (not up to M. Night Shyamalan's standards), bloody awful writing. Shyamalan's dialogue was always bad, but the stories were great. This time we have a story that is not much more than a remake of War of the Worlds. This movie was made dozens of times before. The fact that Phoenix mutters `It's like War of the Worlds' (oh, how self conscious) doesn't make it a parody or a homage. It's still a rip-off. Mars Attacks was a parody; Signs is a rip-off. The film doesn't excuse itself by using higher standards of special effects than were available before - the aliens look so awfully digital it's just pathetic.And the thing that bothered me worst is this. Watching a Shyamalan film, my expectations low though they were, I knew that as bad as the script will be, I'll still get a lovely, surprising twist ending. Well, there was a surprise. Here's the twist: there's not surprise. The ending is obvious and cheesy as hell. Maybe that's meant to be the surprise - if it is, it's a very tasteless joke. Sorry. The corny love-thy-neighbor-and-god-and-believe-in-yourself messages at the end don't impress me much either. Signs told me nothing I didn't already know. Look, I know all about crop circles, right? I kept hoping for a surprising explanation for the phenomena at the end of the film.

Night Shyamalan has done it again (directing, not his acting as he has a small role in this film). This is an excellent suspense film, classic Shyamalan.The story begins with an unusual massive shape or design imprinted in the corn field of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Father Hess has been left alone with his two children after the recent loss of his wife due to a fatal car accident. He has left the priesthood, believing that he was betrayed by the God that he has always advocated. His brother, Merrill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) helps to raise the children after the tragedy. Left without an explanation for the strange 'sign' in the corn field, Graham initially thinks pranksters are responsible.

It is very irritating when a director puts him or herself in an important role in a film and acts like a piece of drift wood. For most of the first half, I alternated between thinking how good it was at scaring me (which is no easy feet) and being bored. Unfortunately, the dialog left both a lot to be desired and a lot unexplained. At times what they were saying was completely disjointed. One of the conversations between Gibson and Cherry Jones, for instance, made little to no sense. On top of the plot holes (which there were many) and the plot contrivances (which there were many), it almost seemed like they couldn?t decide what to make the movie about. Apparently it was about Gibson's character's finding renewed faith in God, which is all good and fine. Except at no point in the film was there an act of God. If there had been an effort to show some Godly sign, I could follow that, but there never was one. I was entertained, even with occasional ""hurry it along"" feelings, for the first 3/4 of the movie, but the last part had me beyond irritated and feeling jerked around by a hack. It's almost like they just slapped the ending on, leaving me stranded with all of those horror movie cliches (Don't ever say, ""I'll be right back"", because YOU WON'T!) ringing in my ears.

The story takes place in rural Pennsylvania. The main character is Graham Hess (Gisbon) a former minister, who is recently widowed. Hess has completely lost his faith and walked away from the chruch. After the accident, Hess stays isolated at his farm away from the community. Helping him raise his two children, is his younger brother Merrill Hess (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball player. Then one day his children find several large crop circles in the middle of his cornfield. Is it the work of pranksters looking for publicity or are they the work of an supernatural entity? Several days after discovering the circles the family begins to hear odd noises at night, the wind sounds strange, and the family pets begin to act weird. There is something wrong and it begins to gnaw at Hess. Things get stranger when they watch TV and find that these circles are appearing all over the world. There are news reports of strange lights in the sky at night. Hess begins to believe the circles in his field are connected to these events.I thought Signs borrowed heavily from the Sixth Sense. It had some of the elements. Some critics, think Shyamalan has fallen into a career trap, becoming another Alfred Hitchcock. However, I did find the movie very chilling, well-crafted and suspenseful.

595065,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JL3T,Jason,"[1, 2]","Like Orson Wells' radio broadcast of ""The War of Worlds"", Signs is incredibly scary, with a tense buildup and suspense worthy of someone with ADD.  It's a great sci-fi story, with one MASSIVE flaw.  If the goal is a simple, mindless scare, then Signs does a fair job.A former precher and his mix-match family of a brother and two children live in a small farming town.  They live the typical eventless life that leads a young man to thinking about joining the military and a child to thinking about becoming a local fireman.  One day, however, a crop circle appears in their corn, and everything changes.The character development of Signs is absolutely superb.  Graham's (Gibson) loss of faith shows a true weakness, a character flaw seen in all heroes.  His brother Merrill (Phoenix) is the a former baseball star known for his home run power, but he's a typical late-twenty something, down on his luck and looking for a new life.  This and the small town existence is making him think about joining the military.  The other children, Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin) are intricately tied into the storyline and well-acted.  The entire movie, from beginning to end, gives the viewer great connections and a nice leadup; each character's uniqueness eventually flows together into the storyline.To make a long story short, the crop circles are a result of aliens, and the aliens are on earth to kill, maim, and pillage.  They are an intensely superior lifeform, more intelligent and advanced in nearly every way. HOWEVER, they are evidently, highly allergic to water.  In fact, with just a few drops the acidic nature of water can kill them.  And they decided to attack Earth, a planet comprised of 75% water?  Really?!  Advanced enough to master space travel, yet they and chose Earth?  Brilliant.If you like alien movies, and well made suspense movies, and you can ignore the one glaring flaw to this movie's premise, it's a great movie.  The twist ending is well thought out and enjoyable.  It's very easy to relate to the characters and get sucked into the story.",4,Swing Away,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2066,"['Orson', 'Wells', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Signs', 'incredibly', 'scary', 'tense', 'buildup', 'suspense', 'worthy', 'someone', 'ADD', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'one', 'MASSIVE', 'flaw', 'goal', 'simple', 'mindless', 'scare', 'then', 'Signs', 'fair', 'job.A', 'former', 'precher', 'mix-match', 'family', 'brother', 'two', 'children', 'live', 'small', 'farming', 'town', 'live', 'typical', 'eventless', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'thinking', 'joining', 'military', 'child', 'thinking', 'becoming', 'local', 'fireman', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'crop', 'circle', 'corn', 'everything', 'changes.The', 'character', 'development', 'Signs', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Graham', 'Gibson', 'loss', 'faith', 'true', 'weakness', 'character', 'flaw', 'seen', 'heroes', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Phoenix', 'former', 'baseball', 'star', 'known', 'home', 'run', 'power', 'typical', 'late-twenty', 'something', 'down', 'luck', 'looking', 'new', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'existence', 'making', 'think', 'joining', 'military', 'other', 'children', 'Morgan', 'Culkin', 'Bo', 'Breslin', 'are', 'intricately', 'tied', 'storyline', 'well-acted', 'entire', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'viewer', 'great', 'connections', 'nice', 'leadup', 'character', 'uniqueness', 'eventually', 'together', 'storyline.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'result', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'are', 'earth', 'kill', 'maim', 'pillage', 'are', 'intensely', 'superior', 'lifeform', 'more', 'intelligent', 'advanced', 'nearly', 'way', 'HOWEVER', 'are', 'evidently', 'highly', 'allergic', 'water', 'fact', 'just', 'few', 'acidic', 'nature', 'water', 'can', 'kill', 'decided', 'attack', 'Earth', 'planet', 'comprised', '75', '%', 'water', 'Really', 'Advanced', 'enough', 'master', 'space', 'travel', 'chose', 'Earth', 'Brilliant.If', 'alien', 'movies', 'well', 'made', 'suspense', 'movies', 'can', 'ignore', 'one', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'movie', 'premise', 'great', 'movie', 'twist', 'ending', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'characters', 'get', 'sucked', 'story']",Signs

The aliens are simply a catalyst.  This is about a family mourning the loss of someone they love.  Reverend Graham's (Mel Gibson)wife died in what seemed to be a tragic senseless accident.  His loss is so deep, that he gives up his practice and denounces God.  His children are attempting to cope with their grief and their father's.  Their uncle (Joaquin Phoenix), a washed up baseball player is staying with them in an effort to help the family.  Suddenly, this major world event (the alien visitors) come crashing into their lives.  How they cope with this horrifying experience is the story.All too often, we question things in our lives.  Why did I lose my job?  Why did so-and-so leave me?  Why do I have this illness?  This story is about questioning what happens in our lives and how we deal with certain situations.

595068,AGT3P9GVVB0XT,B00005JL3T,Jay Stevens,"[3, 6]","First, as a movie, ""Signs"" is only so-so. Despite great acting - especially from Mel Gibson - a handful of extraordinarily tense scenes skillfully wrought by director M. Night Shyamalan, and an exploration into the existence of God, ""Signs"" is pretty silly.Occasionally the dialog works, but most of the time it sounds like the pretentious script from a post-modern adaptation of a Greek play. Stilted. Monosyllabic. Bad. Also, Shyamalan's cameo in the flick is totally pretentious, and he exhibits the charisma of a two-by-four during his scenes. It's a shame he stole the part from some deserving professional, probably some guy looking for his big break. But it's Shyamalan's bat and ball, and he'll play shortstop if he wants.Then there's the whole premise of the movie. Alien invasion? As instrument to test an ex-preacher's faith? Talk about going overboard. Why couldn't God settle for a plague of locusts, a run of bad luck, or even your run-of-the-mill serial killer? But now I'm getting into my next topic...God. Faith. This is what ""Signs"" explores. It turns out in the movie that the whole alien invasion, the son's asthma, and the wife's gruesome death was just an intricate plot by God to test Mel Gibson's faith. (Well, the preacher Gibson plays.)?But...let's face facts. The actual, real, living, breathing God (whatever she looks like) did not make this film. M. Night Shyamalan did. He wrote the script, he created the characters, he framed the scenes, shot the shots. It's his universe, message, and plot. You get the feeling, though, that Shyamalan feels he's actually framing theological ideas or debates. Maybe even that he's channeling divinity by using his creative process (he wouldn't be the first artist to believe this). The earnestness of the movie underscores this point. In any case, it seems obvious that Shyamalan's spirituality seeps throughout this flick.In the end, it's an easy kind of spirituality. God reveals himself in a devious set of interrelated coincidences and saves everybody. There are no uneasy questions that linger past the closing credits. Happy, happy. But the drama unfolding outside the theaters is much more convincing for me. And confusing.",3,"God blows through a stop ""Signs""",1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,2197,"['First', 'movie', 'Signs', 'only', 'so-so', 'great', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'handful', 'extraordinarily', 'tense', 'scenes', 'skillfully', 'wrought', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'exploration', 'existence', 'God', 'Signs', 'pretty', 'silly.Occasionally', 'dialog', 'most', 'time', 'pretentious', 'script', 'post-modern', 'adaptation', 'Greek', 'play', 'Stilted', 'Monosyllabic', 'Bad', 'Also', 'Shyamalan', 'cameo', 'flick', 'totally', 'pretentious', 'charisma', 'two-by-four', 'scenes', 'shame', 'stole', 'part', 'deserving', 'professional', 'probably', 'guy', 'looking', 'big', 'break', 'Shyamalan', 'bat', 'ball', ""'ll"", 'play', 'shortstop', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'Alien', 'invasion', 'instrument', 'test', 'ex-preacher', 'faith', 'Talk', 'going', 'overboard', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'God', 'settle', 'plague', 'locusts', 'run', 'bad', 'luck', 'even', 'run-of-the-mill', 'serial', 'killer', 'now', ""'m"", 'getting', 'next', 'topic', 'God', 'Faith', 'what', 'Signs', 'out', 'movie', 'whole', 'alien', 'invasion', 'son', 'asthma', 'wife', 'gruesome', 'death', 'was', 'just', 'intricate', 'plot', 'God', 'test', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'faith', 'Well', 'preacher', 'Gibson', 'let', 'face', 'facts', 'actual', 'real', 'living', 'breathing', 'God', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'did', 'wrote', 'script', 'created', 'characters', 'framed', 'scenes', 'shot', 'shots', 'universe', 'message', 'plot', 'get', 'feeling', 'though', 'Shyamalan', 'actually', 'framing', 'theological', 'ideas', 'debates', 'Maybe', 'even', 'channeling', 'divinity', 'using', 'creative', 'process', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'artist', 'believe', 'earnestness', 'movie', 'point', 'case', 'obvious', 'Shyamalan', 'spirituality', 'end', 'easy', 'kind', 'spirituality', 'God', 'devious', 'set', 'interrelated', 'coincidences', 'saves', 'everybody', 'are', 'uneasy', 'questions', 'linger', 'closing', 'credits', 'Happy', 'happy', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'theaters', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'confusing']",Signs

Gibson's broken and bitter minister... the good ol' boy brother... the two precocious and adorable kids with their neurotic hang ups...The subtle tension is built up slowly. The windy cornfields are full of mystery and foreboding. An alien leg slipping into the cornstalks... an alien hand slipping under a door.... this stuff is masterful, and much scarier than a full blown, CGI confrontation with a well detailed monster...This is what Shymalan does well. He recaptures a Hitchcock style. He harkens back to the films of yesteryear. One DOES NOT NEED TO SEE EVERYTHING!!How effective it was to see Mel Gibson look out his window, and proclaim ""It's happening."" Much scarier than a scene depicting a well detailed spacecraft landing in the field.The soundtrack is awesome, and the story ties everything together at the end... making a case for faith...faith triumphing over ""coincidence.""The only weaknesses of the film would be in the story itself... why are the aliens so stupid? They need crop signs to navigate? They can't get through blocked doorways? (SPOILER) They are vulnerable to water, and they land on a planet that's mostly water?Perhaps the alien predators are meant to be stupid. For all we know, they aren't the creators of the spacecraft they arrive on... and they just go planet to planet, hoping to not meet resistence.This is simply an incredible, emotional film.

Night Shyamalan's other underrated flick Unbreakable, so it was a no brainer that I'd go and see Signs. Let me tell you, I don't scare easily, but this movie was so creepy and so scary it had me jumping out of my seat. I know a lot of people thought The Sixth Sense had some pretty scary moments, but this one is so much scarier that it's beyond comparison. I wasn't expecting that.What I was expecting is more superb direction from Shyamalan, and I wasn't disappointed. The thing Shyamalan does is make the impossible seem plausible and then completely beleivable by telling a huge story through the perspective of relatively average people. It's this perspective that allows Signs to be more than an alien movie or the Sixth Sense to be more than a ghost story. The characters in his stories have more depth and soul than 99% of the straight-forward dramas that hit the theaters these days. You care about the characters, they don't just exist to be eaten by monsters or run away from the scary ghosts. They ARE the story.I'll go one further by saying this is probably the best movie I've seen this year. It was an emotional rollercoaster.

All three of his movies are trying to build up to an ending that is simply world-moving.  6th Sense delivered.  Unbreakable was a letdown.  Signs was a drop right into the dumpster.4/5ths of the move was good.  That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of zero.  Shyalaman does have talent.  He's great at suspense, and his movies are very touching and funny at the same time.  I loved the scene when the family is having what may be their last supper, and Mel Gibson grabs everyone together around him.  Or the scene when Pheonix explains why he's a 'miracle man.'  There's lots of good suspense, but, damnit Night, the last 1/5th of the movie was veeeeery bad, and made me regret watching it....I know this was a movie about faith.  Hell, we were getting that beaten into us with a baseball bat.  But, if it's a movie about faith that involves sci-fi, and we're supposed to believe the sci-fi element is realistic, that the aliens are there and they're a threat, that it's not mass hysteria, then MAKE THE ALIENS REALISTIC!...So, overall, I give Night some good points for nice points in the movie and good direction, but major detractions for errors-in-fact, massive cliches, a huge letdown in the end, and logic holes.  Night, you're two strikes out.  After two bad experiences in the cinema theater, I'll wait for your next movie to hit DVD racks before picking it up.

Cramer ""wazuppie765""","[0, 2]","Having just seen the new movie ""Signs,"" to my surprise it seemed more like a comedy than a thriller.The plot is very simple. Basically, aliens are making signs on the earth and using them as navigational tools to get around and harvest everybody. Yep, that's it. I expected this movie to be a complex, mysterious thriller with a surprising ending like ""The Sixth Sense,"" but instead I got a regular movie aobut aliens taking over the world. Think ""Independence Day,"" but much less aliens and much less action.The overall intensity of the movie is usually not very great; almost every time there is about to be something scary something humurous happens. And that ruins the movie. How can a movie really be emotional or scary if something funny happens every time? I felt like I was watching a spoof of alien movies more than a real alien movie. And speaking of aliens, the people who made the aliens in this film didn't make them look very creative. They look like, well, the stereotypical kind of alien: Tall, green, big eyes. I expected them to look like the ones in ""Aliens"" or ""Predator,"" but I ended up being somewhat disappointed.But a good thing about this movie (besides if you like watching comedy when you go to a horror movie) is the acting. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Pheonix are great, and M. Night Shyamalan himself makes a cameo.Now about the ending: Instead of the usual M. Night Shyamalan ending, (which is usually full of surprising details, twisty turns, and shocking truths,) we get a really average one. Basically, there is a fight with one of the aliens that lasts about 1 minute. Yes, that's it. So you can imagine that when I walked out of this movie, I was a little bit disappointed. I felt like I'd seen a movie with a bad ending that was part comedy, part thriller, and part B-movie all wrapped up into one.Don't get me wrong; ""Signs"" does have some scary moments, but the cons outweigh the pros so much that this film (which had a phenomonal amount of potential) turns itself into an average horror flick which is easily forgotten. Overall, it's a good popcorn movie to watch if you have 2 hours with abosolutely nothing to do. This film may not be the scariest movie ever made, but if you're looking for a movie with some good scares and some solid suspense, this movie will deliver in spades.2002; 107 minutes; Rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some frightening moments, and some scenes with overall intensity.",3,The cons outweigh the pros,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,2441,"['Having', 'just', 'seen', 'new', 'movie', 'Signs', 'surprise', 'seemed', 'more', 'comedy', 'thriller.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'Basically', 'aliens', 'are', 'making', 'signs', 'earth', 'using', 'navigational', 'tools', 'get', 'harvest', 'everybody', 'Yep', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'complex', 'mysterious', 'thriller', 'surprising', 'ending', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'instead', 'got', 'regular', 'movie', 'aobut', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'Think', 'Independence', 'Day', 'much', 'less', 'aliens', 'much', 'less', 'action.The', 'overall', 'intensity', 'movie', 'usually', 'not', 'very', 'great', 'almost', 'time', 'be', 'something', 'scary', 'something', 'humurous', 'happens', 'movie', 'How', 'can', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'emotional', 'scary', 'something', 'funny', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'spoof', 'alien', 'movies', 'more', 'real', 'alien', 'movie', 'speaking', 'aliens', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'aliens', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'look', 'very', 'creative', 'look', 'well', 'stereotypical', 'kind', 'alien', 'Tall', 'green', 'big', 'eyes', 'expected', 'look', 'ones', 'Aliens', 'Predator', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'somewhat', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'like', 'watching', 'comedy', 'when', 'go', 'horror', 'movie', 'acting', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Joaquin', 'Pheonix', 'are', 'great', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'cameo.Now', 'ending', 'Instead', 'usual', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'ending', 'usually', 'full', 'surprising', 'details', 'twisty', 'turns', 'shocking', 'truths', 'get', 'really', 'average', 'one', 'Basically', 'fight', 'one', 'aliens', '1', 'minute', 'Yes', 'can', 'imagine', 'when', 'walked', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'felt', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'bad', 'ending', 'was', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'B-movie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Signs', 'have', 'scary', 'moments', 'cons', 'outweigh', 'pros', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'had', 'phenomonal', 'amount', 'potential', 'average', 'horror', 'flick', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'Overall', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'watch', 'have', '2', 'hours', 'abosolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'scariest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'good', 'scares', 'solid', 'suspense', 'movie', 'will', 'deliver', 'spades.2002', '107', 'minutes', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'brief', 'strong', 'language', 'frightening', 'moments', 'scenes', 'overall', 'intensity']",Signs

All I'll like to say is that don't expect Mars Attacks or ID4 because Signs is more about Mel's faith in god than anything. So it's hardly about the aliens. It has some thrills and chills but is more emotional than anything. It's surprisingly a very moving film that actually had this 23 yr old guy crying by the end, lol. Don't expect Mel to turn into Riggs and kick some alien [rear] either because that's just isn't what his character is about for once.

595088,A2HVC1IXR56PPS,B00005JL3T,J. McCormick,"[5, 7]","(Review contains spoilers)Signs is a movie that starts out kind of slow, then gets more suspenseful as time goes on, looks promising for a little while, and then falls completely flat.I'm going to mention but mostly ignore the obvious flaws in the plot, like the fact that the aliens to whom water is poisonous choose to come to a planet permeated with it. Those flaws are forgivable. I can perform some logical gymnastics and say that maybe it's only liquid water that's harmful. I'm not saying this makes a lot of sense, but I can at least put that aside.What can't be put aside is the pathetic ending. It turns out that a bunch of bad stuff that happened in the past turned out to be God's way of preparing this family to live through the alien invasion, including the wife's death in an accident. Her final words, ""swing away"", which the priest had originally thought were just random thoughts from a no-longer-coherent mind, turn out to be a prophetic message telling the brother to take the bat off the wall and try to beat the alien to death with it.Seriously? God needed to kill this woman in this horrible way so that she could deliver a message from beyond that maybe, possibly, it just might be a good idea to use the weapons you have lying around the house to defend yourself from a hostile intruder? No, really? These guys actually needed to have this carefully orchestrated set of circumstances to get it into their heads that maybe picking up the baseball bat and hitting the alien with it would be a good idea?The movie desperately wanted to have a message of ""Everything happens for a reason, even the bad stuff, so keep the faith."" Just about everyone in the movie at some point says, ""I don't know. It was almost like I was meant to [do whatever bad thing I did]."" But things like the ""swing away"" prophecy just didn't allow that message to be taken seriously.

595090,APRU373UYVK2Y,B00005JL3T,J. N. Mohlman,"[2, 5]","It is an unfortunate fact of the remarkable special effects available to directors today that far too many rely on effects as a crutch for a weak story.  For every Peter Jackson, there are three George Lucas's.  Fortunately, we have M. Night Shyamalan, who in ""Signs"" recognized that the unknown shadow is infinitely scarier than the most elaborate CGI monster.  Like Spielburg in ""Jaws"", for most of the movie, Shyamalan only hints at the menace that drives the tension.  When you combine such an insightful director with a brilliant, thoughtful script, you have a recipe for a wonderful movie, and ""Signs"" doesn't disappoint.As one might guess, ""Signs"" takes as its jumping off point the appearance of a crop circle in the cornfield of a rural Pennsylvania man.  Graham's not just any man though, he's the father of two (Morgan and Bo), a recent widower, and clergyman who has left the cloth in his grief.  His brother (Merrill) forms the final element in the primary cast of characters.  As UFO's appear in the skies and the world waits for the other shoe to drop, the viewer sees the drama unfold through the eyes of his family.  Rather than resorting to elaborate special effects laden, set piece scenes, Shyamalan uses the relatively simple vehicle of TV news and grainy camcorder footage to set the scene.It is difficult to describe much more without giving away key plot elements, but I can say that Shyamalan does an excellent job of ratcheting up the tension.  In particular, he makes excellent use of shadows and relatively simple sound effects (scratching, breaking glass, footsteps, etc).  Also, the score is utilized in a highly effective manner; in some ways it reminded me of ""The Exorcist"" which had very little music except for key moments.  While there is somewhat more background in this film, it is used to much the same effect.As entertaining and genuinely suspenseful a movie as this is, there is also a lot more to ""Signs"".  It is deeply moving and grapples with some truly profound issues.  I suspect that there are very few people who have ever been married, or even loved someone completely, who can watch Mel Gibson's scenes with his dying wife and not shed a tear.  At the same time, Shyamalan struggles with issues of faith that are all the more profound in this post 9/11 world (shooting began on 9/12).  Do things, even bad things, even awful things, happen for a reason?  Is there a something greater at work here, or are we all just spinning around the sun in a cold, indifferent universe?  At several points during the movie, Graham and Merrill share conversations that are among the most thoughtful I have ever encountered in any film.Finally, lest the reader think this film is stifling in its suspense and seriousness, I would like to add that this is a genuinely funny movie.  Merrill and Bo in particular add numerous light moments, many of which had me laughing out loud.  This humor is key in keeping the movie from bogging down, and is an element that was sorely lacking in Shyamalan's other films.Ultimately, this is a heartfelt, entertaining film of the highest caliber.  It is suspenseful and scary in the finest tradition of Hollywood, and its limited use of special effects offers a sense of realism, of emotional depth, that is noticeably absent from most movies today.  If you've ever struggled with issues of faith, if you enjoy scary, suspenseful movies, or both, ""Signs"" is definitely a film worth checking out.Enjoy!",5,A genuinely suspenseful and profoundly moving film,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,3470,"['unfortunate', 'fact', 'remarkable', 'special', 'effects', 'available', 'directors', 'today', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'rely', 'effects', 'crutch', 'weak', 'story', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'are', 'three', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'Signs', 'recognized', 'unknown', 'shadow', 'infinitely', 'scarier', 'most', 'elaborate', 'CGI', 'monster', 'Spielburg', 'Jaws', 'most', 'movie', 'Shyamalan', 'only', 'menace', 'tension', 'When', 'combine', 'insightful', 'director', 'brilliant', 'thoughtful', 'script', 'have', 'recipe', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Signs', ""n't"", 'disappoint.As', 'one', 'might', 'guess', 'Signs', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'appearance', 'crop', 'circle', 'cornfield', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'man', 'Graham', 'not', 'just', 'man', 'father', 'two', 'Morgan', 'Bo', 'recent', 'widower', 'clergyman', 'who', 'left', 'cloth', 'grief', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'final', 'element', 'primary', 'cast', 'characters', 'UFO', 'appear', 'skies', 'world', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'viewer', 'drama', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'family', 'Rather', 'resorting', 'elaborate', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'set', 'piece', 'scenes', 'Shyamalan', 'relatively', 'simple', 'vehicle', 'TV', 'news', 'grainy', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'set', 'scene.It', 'difficult', 'describe', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'can', 'say', 'Shyamalan', 'excellent', 'job', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'tension', 'particular', 'excellent', 'use', 'shadows', 'relatively', 'simple', 'sound', 'effects', 'scratching', 'breaking', 'glass', 'footsteps', 'etc', 'Also', 'score', 'utilized', 'highly', 'effective', 'manner', 'ways', 'reminded', 'Exorcist', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'music', 'key', 'moments', 'somewhat', 'more', 'background', 'film', 'used', 'much', 'same', 'effect.As', 'entertaining', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'Signs', 'deeply', 'moving', 'grapples', 'truly', 'profound', 'issues', 'suspect', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'married', 'even', 'loved', 'someone', 'completely', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'scenes', 'dying', 'wife', 'not', 'shed', 'tear', 'same', 'time', 'Shyamalan', 'issues', 'faith', 'are', 'more', 'profound', 'post', '9/11', 'world', 'shooting', 'began', '9/12', 'Do', 'things', 'even', 'bad', 'things', 'even', 'awful', 'things', 'happen', 'reason', 'something', 'greater', 'work', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'spinning', 'around', 'sun', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'universe', 'several', 'points', 'movie', 'Graham', 'Merrill', 'share', 'conversations', 'are', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'film.Finally', 'lest', 'reader', 'think', 'film', 'stifling', 'suspense', 'seriousness', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'movie', 'Merrill', 'Bo', 'particular', 'add', 'numerous', 'light', 'moments', 'many', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'humor', 'key', 'keeping', 'movie', 'bogging', 'down', 'element', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'Shyamalan', 'other', 'films.Ultimately', 'heartfelt', 'entertaining', 'film', 'highest', 'caliber', 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'finest', 'tradition', 'Hollywood', 'limited', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'sense', 'realism', 'emotional', 'depth', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'most', 'movies', 'today', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'struggled', 'issues', 'faith', 'enjoy', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'movies', 'Signs', 'definitely', 'film', 'checking', 'out.Enjoy']",Signs

Can anyone tell me how a race smart enough to master interstellar travel can't (a) deal with simple obstacles like locked doors and (b) aren't smart enough to bring protection against common Earthly threats (such as baseball bats and water)? Were they were supposed to be idiot savants? Clearly Shyamalan was looking for some plot vehicle to be both threating and mysterious--the problem is that the Aliens didn't pass the credibility test. The other problem is that Shyamalan assumes the audience is too stupid to see the final revelation coming (e.g., everything is part of God's plan). In fact, one could see it coming a mile away. The same was true with the &quot;revelations&quot; in his other recent effort (Unbreakable). He's obviously trying recreate the briliant twist from the Sixth Sense ending.

Night Shyalaman created a ghost story that ultimately wasn't about the ghosts, and a superhero movie that wasn't about super powers.  In ""Signs"", Shyamalan delivers an alien movie that's, in a sense, not about aliens.  Shyamalan's storytelling techniques are brilliant, something not lost on even those ultimately left cold by the actual story.  Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix turn in solid performances, and the 2 kids are excellent in fairly demanding roles.  ""Signs"" reminds me of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode - in fact Shyamalan's storytelling techniques owe more to Rod Serling than they do to Spielberg or even Hitchcock.  Like Serling, Shyamalan weaves a suspenseful and baffling story, and asks us to ""suspend disbelief"" (as well as overlook some plotholes) and just go along with the ride, promising there's a point worth reaching at the end.  ""Signs"" delivers on this promise, using a science fiction story to once again make a statement about self-discovery and redemption. (At the risk of seeming preachy, I appreciate the fact that the redemption in this case has a religious dimension - a somewhat gutsy move on Shyamalan's part).

What has become of M. Night Shyamalan's promise of talent?""Signs"" is a major let-down for so many reasons. First, its script gives us characters so caught in emotional inertia that it  results in the audience completely lacking empathy for them.Second (also a script issue) -- nothing really happens! For a film in which the world is invaded by aliens, so much of the action occurs as descriptions overheard on the news, with the actors reacting with such ""oh well..."" responses that we never have any feel for the gravity of the situation. As a result, none of the scare elements really work. Where is the hysteria?MAJOR SOILER WARNING: One of the worst elements of the film is the resolution and the classic M. Night ""reveal"". The idea that these aliens are harmed by water and choose to invade a planet that is, well, mostly water is just so illogical. Couldn't these interplanetary geniuses at least build a waterproof suit? C'mon! What, are we back in 50's B-movie territory? And the concept that ""everything happens for a reason"" is so slight an idea but given such heavy emphasis in the conclusion. It almost seems as if it was conceived after the fact of writing the final scenes so as to lend some sort of philosphical weight to the image of Joaquin Phoenix with a baseball bat, beating the bejeesus out of an alien! --- END SPOILERSAs for the performances, well, given what they had to work with, they are merely ok. Mel Gibson looks so weary throughout the film as to make you want to pull him off the set and put him to bed for a while (am I the only person that thinks that, for a man in his mid 40's, Gibson just looks [bad]?).What's good about this film? Well, it looks pretty nice. Good photography and nice, believable sets. I also kinda liked the idea that we never really get a good look at the alien.

595098,ARMH3GNZ83JGQ,B00005JL3T,John Margaritis,"[1, 3]","Just came back for seeing M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much.  The film features some really thrilling moments and will have the audience on the edge of their seats.  The cinematography is stunning and adds so much to the creepy atmosphere.  M.Night is one of my favorite new directors, and he did not disappoint me with this highly orginal take on the 'War Of The Worlds' theme.  And as much as the movie is about aliens and crop circles, there is also an underlying theme that deals with a man's search to regain his faith in God and to find the answer as to why sometimes bad things happen to the people we love.The movie begins with a series of geometric crop circles appearing mysteriously on the farm of Graham Hess(Mel Gibson), a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was accidently killed by a truck.  At first he thinks it is a hoax perpetrated by some local hooligans, but when he watches the news and finds that these crop circles are appearing in all parts of the world, he begins to realize that something more ominous could be happening.  The animals in the area begin to act strangely, and Graham's own dogs act violently, as if they were barking at something that wasn't there.  As the tension mounts, more reports on the television about crop circles, and then some strange lights that are seen hovering in the sky over Mexico.  People begin to predict the end of the world.  Graham tries to protect his family as the reports become even more terrifying.  This all leads to a very scary finale.Although the movie is filled with tension and suspense, there are also some great moments of comic relief, and they are interspersed nicely throughout the film.  Very good performances by Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix(Merill Hess, Graham's brother), but they are upstaged by the two kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.  Where does M. Night keep coming up with these great child actors from?  One minor problem I had with the film is a little too much reliance on sentimentality--in my opinion it could of done without so much of it and still been effective.  Also, in fairness I should say that I've already talked to someone who didn't like 'Signs' as much as I did, and I've read some of the bad reviews it has received, so my advice would be to see it for yourself, especially if you liked 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense'; if it is anything, it is certainly entertaining.

Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth.""Signs"" is the perfect example of the ""less is more"" approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really what makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws, but for the sake of spoilers, I won't go into them. Besides, I, for one, was too immersed in the story to care.Another thing I greatly appreciated in ""Signs"" was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, clich&eacute;, or intrusive like the identical ""original"" scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.But ""Signs"" is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it is also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming ""I hate you!"" at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenius, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.I guess ""Signs"" is one of those ""love it or hate it"" films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area.

Signs is not only scary, it is scary in the second or third watching.Signs is two stories seamlessly sewn into one.  At the heart we have Mel Gibson as a single father.  He had been a man of the cloth until the death of his wife.  Now he is trying to raise his children with the help of his younger brother.In the larger picture, the world is undergoing some amazing events.  We experience them through Gibson's family.  Like an Anton Checkov play, most of the action is off screen and thus scarier.As Gibson is trying to hold his family together, something happens in his corn field.  Cornstalks are bent in strange symbols.  Rustling, shadows and strange noises are used to great effect that literally raised the hair on the back of my neck.Gibson faces family and world events while trying to come to terms with his shaken faith.  Faith is at the heart of this movie and Gibson's portrayal is brilliant.Pay attention to the details.  Everything seems to have a purpose.  Even watch it a second time as casual remarks in the beginning take on new meaning once you know more of past events (i.e. Gibson's insistence at using a people doctor when the dog gets sick).In many ways I find this movie superior to The Sixth Sense even though the later was more favored by the media.  But both show seamless storytelling and great attention to detail.  If you enjoyed one, you should enjoy the other.  While you are at it, check out Unbreakable.",5,Terrifying Genius,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,1541,"['many', 'years', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'actually', 'been', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'scary', 'Signs', 'not', 'only', 'scary', 'scary', 'second', 'third', 'watching.Signs', 'two', 'stories', 'seamlessly', 'sewn', 'one', 'heart', 'have', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'single', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'man', 'cloth', 'death', 'wife', 'Now', 'trying', 'raise', 'children', 'help', 'younger', 'brother.In', 'larger', 'picture', 'world', 'undergoing', 'amazing', 'events', 'experience', 'Gibson', 'family', 'Anton', 'Checkov', 'play', 'most', 'action', 'screen', 'thus', 'scarier.As', 'Gibson', 'trying', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'something', 'happens', 'corn', 'field', 'Cornstalks', 'are', 'bent', 'strange', 'symbols', 'Rustling', 'strange', 'noises', 'are', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'literally', 'raised', 'hair', 'back', 'neck.Gibson', 'family', 'world', 'events', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'shaken', 'faith', 'Faith', 'heart', 'movie', 'Gibson', 'portrayal', 'brilliant.Pay', 'attention', 'details', 'Everything', 'have', 'purpose', 'Even', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'casual', 'remarks', 'beginning', 'take', 'new', 'meaning', 'once', 'know', 'more', 'past', 'events', 'i.e', 'Gibson', 'insistence', 'using', 'people', 'doctor', 'when', 'dog', 'sick', '.In', 'many', 'ways', 'find', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'even', 'later', 'was', 'more', 'favored', 'media', 'show', 'seamless', 'storytelling', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'should', 'enjoy', 'other', 'are', 'check', 'out', 'Unbreakable']",Signs
595106,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00005JL3T,JRP,"[0, 8]","A full on rant is something I haven't done in a long time this is 2002 in film Signs. This movie has speial acting just like The Happening which would come out 6 years after this movie. Directed by M Night Shyamalan who directed The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable which I like those movies. But this movie The Happening & Lady In The Water are horrible. I haven't seen The Last Airbender & I don't want to. It stars Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, Joaquin Phoenix as Merrill Hess, Rory Caulkin as Morgan, Abigail Breslyn as Bo & M Night Shyamalan has a role. The story is your introduced to Graham Hess a former Preacher he lost his faith when his wife was killed in an road accident. You have his Younger Brother Merrill who helps him he used to be a Minor League Baseball Player. 1 morning he can't find his kids Morgan & Bo. They find them in the corn field where they come across crop circles. This would've been great in the late 80's or early 90's when those stories were popular. Their dog is acting strange then you have the introduction of this Sheriff this character is 1 of the most useless characters I have seen in a movie in a long time. Morgan kills the dog. So you have Graham's Daughter Bo 1st off who names a girl Bo. She tells him that there is a monster outside Graham thinks he sees somebody trying to break in. He goes & wakes Merrill up how Mel Gibson says this line I busted out laughing I mean this isn't suppose to be a comic relief scene it's suppose to be suspensful ""Lionel Prichard & The Wolfington Brothers are back."" The next line I don't buy at all from Joaquin Phoenix ""It't time for an a s s whoopin."" Graham tells him maybe we should approach this in a smarter way. Merill says lets run around the house & act crazy & scare them off. OMG this scene is so funny I mean somebody is trying to break into what do you do. Then the next day you have The Sheriff come back they are talking about who it could've been on the roof. This Sheriif says it could've been a woman cause they got women that can run like the wind in The Olympics. They got these Scandinavain Women that can jump over me."" I was like wtf I understand the point she's tryng to make but it's dumb an Olympic athlete in the middle of no where braking into people houses. We get to what this movie is about UFO'S. The Sheriff tells Graham to take his family into town. Thankfully this is the last we see of this useless Sheriff character. So they go into town & you get the typical unlikeable characters in an M Night Shyamalan movie. You have this book store owner b i t c h ing about soda commercials on TV. They try to build on these characters & I don't really care about them & I've said it before when I don't care about the characters I don't care care about the movie. You have them at this restraunt where Graham spots M Night Shayamalan. You have them go home Morgan picks up a signal on the baby monitor. They watch what is going on The TV Morgan wants to record it he has Bo's ballet recital. She gets upset about it Morgan says that this is science history. There is a possibility that the world is going to be wiped out I don't think it's going to matter. Later on Graham goes to the director house you have Merill watch what's going on, on TV they show where 1 of the creatures has been spotted this would be scary had The Alien not looked like a cross between The Jolly Green Giant & the creature from Alien 4. The way Joaquin Phoenix acts it is so over the top it's really bad acting. So Graham goes to M Night Shyamalan's house & he tells him that he is going to the lake cause none of The Aliens have been spotted there he apologise's for the accident that killed his wife. He tells him that he has 1 of The Aleins trapped in the pantery. This was the only real suspesful scene where Graham goes into the house where he uses a knife to see the reflection of The Alien & a hand comes out he takes the knife & cuts a couple of it's claws off. He goes home & another thing is that the kids wear these foil hats so when he comes home Joaquin Phoenix is wearing a foil hat & he looks like a dork. Graham asks about if The Aliens get hostile. Morgan says oh my book says they would use ground tatics instead of fighting an air battle cause we would use nukes & The Earth would be useless then. Man this book he has just has all the ansrews. Graham says The Aliens haven't been spotted near water so he wants a show of hands to stay at the house or go to the lake Graham & Bo want to go to the lake Merill & Morgan want to stay. Graham says that I count as 2 parents so were going to the lake. Morgan says that cheating. Then you have the dinner scene the worst scene of the movie everybody gets there meal of choice. Morgan wants them all to pray before they eat. Mel Gibson becomes Mad Mel he is a a s s hole but so is Rory Caulkin who says he hates him & blames him for his mothers death. I mean Mel Gibson does some really bad acting in this scene ""Let's enjoy this meal!"" Bo starts crying he yells for her to stop her crying. He starts taking food off of everybodies plate cause there not eating. Then they all start to hug it's 1 of the worst scenes trying to convey emotion I've seen in a long time. Then they baby monitor goes off & you have The Aliens trying to get into the house they hide in the basement. Morgan is having an asthma attack how does his Dad get him throgh it by saying I hate you. Anyway the next day they hear on the radio that The Aliens have left no explaination just that they left. They go upstairs Graham brings The TV in & he sees the reflection same 1 that he encountered the day before. The Alien has Morgan he sprays some kind of toxin in his face Graham has a flashback to when he talked to his wife the night she died he realizes that Merrill should take the bat & use it on The Alien which he does & there are glasses of water all around that Bo left cause she thought that the water tasted bad. A glass of water falls on The Alien & guess what water kills The Alien. water! WTF!? So if it rained so much for The Alien invasion. Graham gets Morgan outside he gives this shot & he recovers. It goes to months later where Graham is back to being a Preacher. If you like this movie fine cause every movie has a fan & a hater. When I rant on a movie it's against the movie not against people who like it. I don't want to be told I didn't get it cause it's a sign that Graham has to regain his faith so I did get it. The Blu Ray has an amazing transfer. So if you do like this movie get The Blu Ray. The feature are actually decent & you find out a lot went on during the making of the movie. But there is 0 suspense unlikeable characters except for Mel Gibson maybe & Abigail Breslyn. Badly acted scenes along with dumb & laughable scenes a movie like Skyline that has characters I care about with tension & suspense gets called the worst movie ever made & Signs gets the pass. I might do a review defending Skyline. M Night Shyamamlan seems like a nice guy but he doesn't know how to build suspense. Mel Gibson had the 3rd worst performance. Joaquin Phoenix gave the worst performance. Rory Caulkin gave the 2nd worst cause he was annoying. Abigail Bresly did a good job though. Honestly I'd rather watch The Happening it's a really bad movie but at least it's so bad it's good. Next I will have 2002 in film Triple X.",1,2002 in film rant Signs 2.5/10 this review is back up learn how to take an opinion,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,7354,"['full', 'rant', 'something', 'have',

595107,A3G98NEA8A9K8H,B00005JL3T,J. Stoneking,"[8, 12]","If you expect sci-fi or if you expect horror from this movie, you may be quite disappointed.  However, if you don't mind watching a movie that is an analogy about the frailties of one man and his struggles with his faith with God, then sit down and put this in: I don't think you will be disappointed.To me, M. Night's movies have been becoming progressively BETTER.  His movies have gotten deeper and more cerebral.  Sixth Sense is good, but you basically just need to watch that movie twice (once to get surprised by the twist ending and a second time to figure out why you were fooled in the first place).  UNBREAKABLE had a better plot and a better ending (the ending set up two more sequels, so for those that didn't like the ending, you may not have realized that) and is great on repeat viewings.  SIGNS blows the other two out of the water and is a deep movie that requires more than just a surface glance; this movie deserves to be probed, dissected and examined from beginning to end.The movie is an analogy, most importantly.  The alien invasion is just a background thing and is more than likely a dream.  There is quite a bit in the movie to suggest that it is just a dream, that it's more than what it appears.**The first shot: the window glass is distorted and then you see Graham's family in a picture.  This could represent how Graham's views of his world and his family have become distorted.  It's also here that Graham wakes up, the first of many times he wakes up in the movie.**The first sign: Graham is looking for his children in a cornfield and gets lost, representative of his relationship with God and how he is lost and his Father is searching for him, and also representative of the signs God gives us that He's there and cares.**Graham cannot hear his children in the field later on, pointing out his relationship with God.  While he is derailed from his faith looking for his personal signs that God is there, his communication with God is not what it should be.  He has not forgiven God for losing his wife, and the Bible says that those who have unforgiveness in their heart are not heard by God.**The first time we see the aliens in the movie (on the TV, though they were present earlier on, as evidenced by the dogs' responses to them) Morgan needs to use his inhaler, and only uses his inhaler when he sees the aliens, a point that I feel is important later in the movie.**The aliens could be an analogy of demons in the movie, personal demons that Graham has to fight to regain his faith in God.  He is afraid of his demons, and refuses to confront them, and runs from them when confronted with them in the movie, and in the end says he is not ready when the demon tries to get in the basement.  He's not ready to face his demons because he has not worked out his struggle with God at this point to see the signs in his life he is looking for.**The instances where the invasion is compared to the War of the Worlds and Bo keeps asking if this is all in her dream and Graham keeps waking up as if trying to awake himself from a dream in the entire movie suggests this movie is a dream.  There are other elements, but I will leave that for the viewer to decide.**We never see how the mid east nations fought off the invasion.  It is ASSUMED to be water, but we do not know.  It's possible that the water in the house was Holy Water, blessed by Bo, as she was pure in spirit and like an angel (I know this is stretching it, but go with me).  Holy Water is seen as having an adverse affect on demons in other movies and media.  I think what really got rid of the demons was prayer, and it was Merrill's prayer in the basement that saved the family in Graham's time of darkest struggle.**God saves Morgan from dying, and Morgan is able to breathe normally once again.  At the same time, God touches Graham and he can see God's signs clearly for the first time in the movie, and is symbolically touched with the breath of God.  The final pan shot goes through the same window we saw at the beginning, only this time the distorted glass is gone, and Graham's vision or perception of reality is no longer distorted, and he's able to return to work.If you are expecting INDEPENDENCE DAY or ET from this movie, then you best go and buy or rent those, and leave this one on the shelf.

595110,A2WZEP1NW3X963,B00005JL3T,"""justleavemealone""","[2, 5]","This movie has a very unique premise: aliens are invading the world, and the attack is shown from the perspective of a farming family in rural PA.  The whole film is rather quirky and offbeat, and in my mind those are positives.  Mel Gibson is a corn farmer and embittered ex-minister (everyone calls him ""Father,"" but he has a family - go figure)who is ticked at God for letting his wife die six months previous.  While trying to raise his kids with the help of his younger brother, a failed baseball player, aliens show up in the middle of his cornfield and make big crop circles while stalking his house.  The brilliance of the director was in taking such a wacky premise and making it into a good movie anyway.  The film is heavy on suspense, with most of the terror implied or barely shown, which is another huge plus in my mind.  Gibson does a great job portraying the main character, and the child actor and actress are superb; Phoenix is OK in his role.  I personally did not care for the Sixth Sense, esp. since I figured out the ""secret ending"" in the first 10 minutes, but ""Signs"" kept me guessing till the end.

595111,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,B00005JL3T,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[0, 0]","I have to admit I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films.  I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was excellent, and despite the panning it got, I thought ""Unbreakable"" was pretty good too.  I got ""Signs"" out with trepidation; I'm not exactly an ""Alien"" movie type of fan though I do watch them.However in this case I will make an exception to the rule.  What a fantastic little film is all I can say.  And oh boy, what heart stopping moments there are from beginning to end.Don't rent this if you want gratuitous violence and bodies all over the place, this isn't that kind of movie.  What it does do is play with your head big time.  A series of crop circles are appearing all over the world and one of them has just turned up in a small field belonging to an ex-Pastor who is going through a crisis of faith.M. Night Shyamalan choose a good cast with Mel Gibson (Graham Hess) excelling as the Pastor who has lost his faith in God after the accidental death of his wife in a freak car crash.  The two child characters (Hess's young children) are equally good, with Rory Culkin (Morgan Hess) proving that he is as good as his famous older brother when it comes to acting.  Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess) does justice to her role as little girl who has an odd phobia about water, a phobia that just might help save her and her family.However out of all these excellent people for me by far the best was Joaquin Phoenix (Merrill Hess) who plays Gibson's much younger brother, a failed baseball player with a quirky habit of striking out because of his love of ""swinging"" the bat too much.The move starts off as a patchwork quilt of ideas that are slowly pulled together to create a creepy story about the invasion of earth, and the concept that somehow things happen for a reason, not matter how terrible they might be.  A surprise for me was how good an actor M. Night Shyamalan is.  He had a bit part as the Vet who accidentally killed Gibson's wife in the car accident and who gave me one of two great giggles in a film with few laughs.  Just as he about to flee to a place near water, he tells Gibson ""not to go into his pantry"" because one of ""them"" (the Aliens) is locked in their.  He does it with such a dead pan expression that I had to laugh out loud.  The next excellent giggle is when Gibson comes home (after his pantry experience) to find his two children and younger brother sitting on the sofa, all with aluminium foil hats on their heads, ""So that Aliens won't hear their thoughts,"" I howled at that, it was so comical and yet you could understand and even feel their desperation as they tried to understand what was happening to them and the world.The tension in the film builds up, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't let you glimpse the Aliens too often, all you get is a ""feel"" of them in the beginning but as the film gathers momentum you become more and more aware of them and their hostile presence.  There is a neat twist in this film that is at first subtle then as the answers dawn on you it becomes obvious.  I won't spoil it for you but this is cracking good film.Just remember, it has little violence on show that is left to your imagination instead it relies on playing tricks on your mind.I really enjoyed this film, and it made me jump on several occasions.

He's able to take the simplest everyday things and scare the crap out of you with them. After seeing this film, you will never view a cornfield, baby monitor, or scratching noise in your house the same again.If you've seen the commercials, you know that aliens play a key role in the film. Shyamalan is able to totally keep you on the edge of your seat by showing nothing more of them than shadows or claws. What also is amazing is that the aliens are, for the most part, seen in the full daylight. He doesn't always have the scary parts take place at night. Daytime isn't the safe haven that it usually is in a scary movie. This film also uses the theater sound system effectively by having sound effects of the aliens skittering over the house move all around the theater. It will totally freak you out. It's amazing how Shyamalan makes an effective alien invasion movie by hardly showing them at all. He knows that your imagination will create infinitely more terrifying images than he can ever come up with on the screen.This film takes some of the best elements of War of the Worlds and Close Encounters and repackages them for new audiences. It also combines several elements of UFO mythology into a cohesive tale. One of the most notable things about it is that it tells a very personal story. In the face of a global event, we concern ourselves only with what's happening in this particular family. We see everything from their point of view and from their isolated world. However, the true heart of this film's story is a man's restoration of faith in God and rebuilding bonds with his family. If you're looking for a good scare and an interesting twist on the whole alien invasion concept, this is one you'll want to check out.After &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; everyone expects Shyamalan's movies to have some earth-shattering twist at the end. With &quot;Signs,&quot; there's no major revelation at the end as you might hope for. Despite lacking that hoped for twist, the movie is still a little confusing and it may not necessarily answer all of your questions. Most of my unanswered questions involved what was happening beyond the Hess' house. But since that wasn't the focus of the film, my questions were never sufficiently addressed.

595116,A3BV9E9XSA4Z73,B00005JL3T,Karl,"[8, 15]","To be charitable, I imagine the writer/director of this film thought he was making something suspenseful, yet subtle and delicate. In fact so much of the film is pure &quot;talking heads&quot; the biggest mystery of all is why an actor like Mel Gibson let himself be talked into taking part in such a staggeringly vacuous piece of nonsense.There are just two story lines here, and even then they tend to occupy discrete sections of the fim rather than intertwining:1. Mel Gibson was a priest until his wife was killed in a road accident six months before the film begins. Losing his wife caused him to lose his faith. In the final scene, apparently on the ludicrous premise that God gave his son asthma to protect him from the alien gas attack, he dresses up as a priest again.2. Crop circles start appearing all over the planet, including one in the field of maize on Gibson's farm. Later on something big with lots of lights on appears over Mexico City. Then the earth gets invaded by aliens who are apparently intent on &quot;harvesting&quot; the human race, but are rather easily defeated because they cannot stand coming into contact with - Water!The first question that comes to mind is: What kind of alien race, whose members are fatally allergic to water, is bright enough to travel vast distances through space, yet stupid enough to waste all that technology, time and effort by trying to harvest a race of beings whose bodies are 80% water?Duh!I see some reviewers reject this kind of criticism on the grounds that the film isn't really about crop circles or the alien invasion but is about beliefs, faith, family, etc.Sorry, I don't see the logic.  Maybe I'm being naive but to my mind, if you use crop circles, aliens and an alien invasion as the hook on which to hang your story then the crop circles, the aliens and the invasion should be as credible as the other elements of the plot.If they AREN'T worth taking trouble over then why the heck are they there at all?  Could it be that they are included in an effort to attract an audience which wouldn't be even remotely interested in the &quot;real&quot; story?There may have been the basis for an interesting 20 minute TV programme here, but what we actually get is an hour and a half (approx.) of poorly lit (sorry, &quot;atmospheric&quot;), poorly recorded (&quot;natural&quot;?) nonsense. The special f/x are limited in every sense of the word, involving one pretty stereotypical alien (naked, humanoid, with silvery green skin, bald head and black eyes), and a still photo of a set of bright spots over some kind of urban area at night (Mexico City? It could have been Southend-on-Sea for all you could see). In fact (to save money?) the characters end up telling us all about the invasion. It's like watching the recording of a 1930's radio drama, except that the script really isn't up to the standards of a 1930s radio drama.As to the DVD extras, there's plenty there, but what does all that examination of a thoroughly mindless, boring picture get you? Right, more boredom.I personally liked &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; a lot, and I appreciated the slow build up of the plot to the final explanation of Bruce Willis' situation.Possibly Mr Shyamalan was trying to do something along the same lines here. If so, I can only say that he needs to get back some of his earlier objectivity, because this film failed to match his earlier work in every conceivable way.In fact, the only &quot;sign&quot; I found in this film was the one that pointed to the exit.",1,"If this is a sign, it's pointing to the EXIT",1061942400,"08 27, 2003",2003,3523,"['be', 'charitable', 'imagine', 'writer/director', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'making', 'something', 'suspenseful', 'yet', 'subtle', 'delicate', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'pure', 'quot', 'talking', 'heads', 'quot', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'why', 'actor', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'let', 'be', 'talked', 'taking', 'part', 'such', 'staggeringly', 'vacuous', 'piece', 'nonsense.There', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'here', 'even', 'then', 'tend', 'occupy', 'discrete', 'sections', 'fim', 'rather', 'intertwining:1', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'priest', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'road', 'accident', 'six', 'months', 'film', 'Losing', 'wife', 'caused', 'lose', 'faith', 'final', 'scene', 'apparently', 'ludicrous', 'premise', 'God', 'gave', 'son', 'asthma', 'protect', 'alien', 'gas', 'attack', 'up', 'priest', 'again.2', 'Crop', 'start', 'appearing', 'planet', 'including', 'one', 'field', 'maize', 'Gibson', 'farm', 'Later', 'something', 'big', 'lots', 'lights', 'Mexico', 'City', 'Then', 'earth', 'invaded', 'aliens', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'intent', 'quot', 'harvesting', 'quot', 'human', 'race', 'are', 'rather', 'easily', 'defeated', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'coming', 'contact', 'Water', 'first', 'question', 'mind', 'What', 'kind', 'alien', 'race', 'members', 'are', 'fatally', 'allergic', 'water', 'bright', 'enough', 'travel', 'vast', 'distances', 'space', 'yet', 'stupid', 'enough', 'waste', 'technology', 'time', 'effort', 'trying', 'harvest', 'race', 'beings', 'bodies', 'are', '80', '%', 'water', 'Duh', 'see', 'reviewers', 'reject', 'kind', 'criticism', 'grounds', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'crop', 'circles', 'alien', 'invasion', 'beliefs', 'faith', 'family', 'etc.Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'logic', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'naive', 'mind', 'use', 'crop', 'circles', 'aliens', 'alien', 'invasion', 'hook', 'hang', 'story', 'then', 'crop', 'circles', 'aliens', 'invasion', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'credible', 'other', 'elements', 'plot.If', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'taking', 'trouble', 'then', 'why', 'heck', 'are', 'there', 'Could', 'be', 'are', 'included', 'effort', 'attract', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'basis', 'interesting', '20', 'minute', 'TV', 'programme', 'here', 'what', 'actually', 'get', 'hour', 'half', 'approx', 'poorly', 'lit', 'sorry', 'quot', 'atmospheric', 'quot', 'poorly', 'recorded', 'quot', 'natural', 'quot', 'nonsense', 'special', 'f/x', 'are', 'limited', 'sense', 'word', 'involving', 'one', 'pretty', 'stereotypical', 'alien', 'naked', 'humanoid', 'silvery', 'green', 'skin', 'bald', 'head', 'black', 'eyes', 'still', 'photo', 'set', 'bright', 'spots', 'kind', 'urban', 'area', 'night', 'Mexico', 'City', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Southend-on-Sea', 'could', 'see', 'fact', 'save', 'money', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'telling', 'invasion', 'watching', 'recording', '1930', 'radio', 'drama', 'script', 'really', ""n't"", 'up', 'standards', '1930s', 'radio', 'drama.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'plenty', 'there', 'what', 'examination', 'thoroughly', 'mindless', 'boring', 'picture', 'get', 'Right', 'more', 'boredom.I', 'personally', 'liked', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'lot', 'appreciated', 'slow', 'build', 'plot', 'final', 'explanation', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'situation.Possibly', 'Mr', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'same', 'lines', 'here', 'so', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'get', 'back', 'earlier', 'objectivity', 'film', 'failed', 'match', 'earlier', 'work', 'conceivable', 'way.In', 'fact', 'only', 'quot', 'sign', 'quot', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'pointed', 'exit']",Signs

595121,A15FZG05WPUKYY,B00005JL3T,keith helinski,"[2, 6]","M. Night Shyamalan, the shining new writer/director of the overrated &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; and the underrated &#65533;Unbreakable&#65533;, had us going all summer long.  He had marketing with crop circles and slogans like &#65533;It&#65533;s Happening&#65533;.  &#65533;Signs&#65533; grossed $60 million in its opening weekend.  Up to the opener, I was looking forward to &#65533;Signs&#65533;.  It&#65533;s about time Hollywood makes a movie about crop circles (because whether or not you like to believe in UFOs, these strange shapes appearing in farmers crops overnight, are supposedly being reported). That&#65533;s what I thought, until I got an hour into the film.The first forty-five minutes of the film is the best filmmaking ever made.  It starts out in an abnormal morning, in which family man Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), finds crop circles in his crops.  From there, the story gets kind of suspenseful, in terms of the way the direction of the film goes. The plot seemed too much like Daphne Du Maurier&#65533;s original story of &#65533;The Birds&#65533; (which Alfred Hitchcock took and changed around to make his own version)From there, I got thrown away.  The whole crop circles angle was very pointless to the ending of the film, not to give anything away to those who hasn&#65533;t seen it.  Picture this: you&#65533;re an alien that is afraid of water, yet you are about to raid a planet that is two-thirds water.The few compliments I do give to the film are Mel Gibson, for his choice of picking such a different project.  This doesn&#65533;t go along with the freedom, kicking butt &#65533;Brave-Heart&#65533;, the wholesome melo-drama &#65533;The Man Without a Face&#65533;, nor the epic saga &#65533;Lethal Weapon&#65533;.  I will also give two thumbs up to the score of the film.  James Newton Howard didn&#65533;t make the film too bad with the haunting music, that is compared to how John Williams approached Steven Spielberg&#65533;s &#65533;Close Encounters&#65533; and &#65533;E.T.&#65533;, the beautiful yet undeniable creepy score, moves the film along.As for this uprising writer/director, Mr. Shyamalan is the new kid on the block who does have talent for directing a film.  In his films, I saw some camera angles on both &#65533;Unbreakable&#65533; and now, &#65533;Signs&#65533;, which I had never seen before.  But as for screenwriting, he should have somebody else write out the scripts for him.  He&#65533;s decent on character development, needs work on dialog, and certainly is horribly in terms of plots and sub-plots.What I hear from the rumor-mill, &#65533;Signs&#65533; is going to be a trilogy.  Whether or not good old Mel will rejoin this already gone bad series, &#65533;Signs&#65533; could have been done much better.  And adding the fear factor of crop circles does not help.  Even though this wasn&#65533;t a clich&eacute; in your face, blow up the world type sci-fi flick, it still runs with &#65533;War of the Worlds&#65533; and &#65533;Independence Day&#65533;, with the misconceptions of UFOs, whether you believe or not, the truth is out there.",1,Signs of Over-rated-itis,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,3107,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'shining', 'new', 'writer/director', 'overrated', '65533', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '65533', 'underrated', '65533', 'Unbreakable', '65533', 'had', 'going', 'summer', 'long', 'had', 'marketing', 'crop', 'circles', 'slogans', '65533', '65533', 's', 'Happening', '65533', '65533', 'Signs', '65533', 'grossed', '60', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'opener', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', '65533', 'Signs', '65533', '65533', 's', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'crop', 'circles', 'not', 'like', 'believe', 'UFOs', 'strange', 'shapes', 'appearing', 'farmers', 'crops', 'overnight', 'are', 'supposedly', 'being', 'reported', '65533', 's', 'what', 'thought', 'got', 'hour', 'film.The', 'first', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'film', 'best', 'filmmaking', 'ever', 'made', 'out', 'abnormal', 'morning', 'family', 'man', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'crop', 'circles', 'crops', 'there', 'story', 'kind', 'suspenseful', 'terms', 'way', 'direction', 'film', 'plot', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'Daphne', 'Du', 'Maurier', '65533', 's', 'original', 'story', '65533', 'Birds', '65533', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'took', 'changed', 'make', 'own', 'version', 'there', 'got', 'thrown', 'away', 'whole', 'crop', 'circles', 'angle', 'was', 'very', 'pointless', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'who', 'hasn', '65533', 't', 'seen', 'Picture', '65533', 're', 'alien', 'afraid', 'water', 'yet', 'are', 'raid', 'planet', 'two-thirds', 'few', 'compliments', 'do', 'give', 'film', 'are', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'choice', 'picking', 'such', 'different', 'project', 'doesn', '65533', 't', 'go', 'along', 'freedom', 'kicking', 'butt', '65533', 'Brave-Heart', '65533', 'wholesome', 'melo-drama', '65533', 'Man', 'Face', '65533', 'epic', 'saga', '65533', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '65533', 'will', 'also', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'score', 'film', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'didn', '65533', 't', 'make', 'film', 'too', 'bad', 'haunting', 'music', 'compared', 'how', 'John', 'Williams', 'approached', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', '65533', 's', '65533', 'Close', 'Encounters', '65533', '65533', 'E.T.', '65533', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'undeniable', 'creepy', 'score', 'film', 'along.As', 'uprising', 'writer/director', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'who', 'have', 'talent', 'directing', 'film', 'films', 'saw', 'camera', 'angles', '65533', 'Unbreakable', '65533', 'now', '65533', 'Signs', '65533', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'screenwriting', 'should', 'have', 'somebody', 'else', 'out', 'scripts', '65533', 's', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'work', 'dialog', 'certainly', 'horribly', 'terms', 'plots', 'sub-plots.What', 'hear', 'rumor-mill', '65533', 'Signs', '65533', 'going', 'be', 'trilogy', 'not', 'good', 'old', 'Mel', 'will', 'rejoin', 'already', 'gone', 'bad', 'series', '65533', 'Signs', '65533', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'adding', 'fear', 'factor', 'crop', 'circles', 'not', 'help', 'Even', 'wasn', '65533', 't', 'clich', 'eacute', 'face', 'blow', 'up', 'world', 'type', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'still', '65533', 'War', 'Worlds', '65533', '65533', 'Independence', 'Day', '65533', 'misconceptions', 'UFOs', 'believe', 'not', 'truth', 'out', 'there']",Signs

595123,A1M4027KTXCH5J,B00005JL3T,Kevin A. Little,"[0, 1]","I admired M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, but I think SIGNS is his weakest foray into Twilight Zone territory.  SIGNS has some great and scary moments, mostly built on jump-out shocks or on keeping things hidden from view.  But the payoff just doesn't come together very well.  The religious aspects of the movie (Gibson's struggle with his faith) and the ""trick"" ending (which is becoming Shyamalan's signature mark) are too obvious to offer any real suspense or any real sense of surprise and wonder that one got with his previous two movies.I also disagreed with the director's choice here to play a pivotal character.  In his previous two films, his appearances were nothing more than glorified cameos, but in this movie, his role is crucial to the plot and the dramatic tension.  And as good a director as Shyamalan is, he is not up the challenge of playing the character in this movie.That said, there is much to enjoy about this movie, including a good performance by Gibson (who unfortunately seems as miscast as Bruce Willis did in THE SIXTH SENSE) and a nice turn by Cherry Jones as a clear-thinking deputy.  Shyamalan is also a master at developing a story slowly (albeit sometimes too slowly) so that the audience is kept guessing.What worked in Shyamalan's previous two films, however, was keeping the audience's guess work more at bay, not letting them get too close to guessing the real ""twist"" he had planned.

595125,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00005JL3T,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 1]","Riding again on the tails of his success with ""The Sixth Sense,"" writer/director M. Night Shyamalan goes to bat with a metaphysical thriller, this time on a more purely science-fictional level than in his past films.  Does he succeed?  I guess, kind of, though not with flying colors.Trailers and ads for this film have focussed heavily on the crop circle phenomenon, a known hoax that gulled a lot of people fifteen years ago but is now known to be the work of ""artists"" with too much time on their hands.  This hoax is even acknowledged out loud more than once in the film.  One wonders if the emphasis on crop circles was because Shyamalan didn't know what else to use to kick-start the plot.The crop circles are a red herring anyway.  So are the aliens who appear fairly early.  The real story revolves around Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a priest who has renounced his vows after the sudden, violent death of his wife.  The prolonged crisis of faith he suffers through this film, consistent with Shyamalan's metaphysical musings in the past, is the real story here.Joaquin Phoenix turns in a good performance as Gibson's younger brother Merrill, and Cherry Jones is good in a rare screen performance as Officer Paski, a local cop and friend of the Hesses.  Both are underexplored, however, as are the rest of the supporting characters.  This is Graham Hess' story, and the others simply serve to propel him along.The story is good but not great.  Because of Shyamalan's fondness for twists and his wry sense of humor, it is at least engaging enough to keep viewers interested in the moment.  However, many will come to the film expecting to see something on the level of ""The Sixth Sense,"" and they will be disappointed.  Most of the negative criticisms owe less to the quality of the film than to the fact that it isn't on the same par as ""The Sixth Sense.""  Taken in itself, this film is better than most being made right now.The aliens -- a mix of puppetry, computer generation, and men in suits -- disappoint, but they're largely peripheral.  Only one is seen very closely.  Many people will certainly be disappointed by them, but keep in mind, they're not the heart of the story.The ending will also seem very pat.  The movie comes to a sudden halt rather than trying to resolve the outstanding questions.  In terms of story, this is the biggest flaw in the movie.Technically, there are other flaws, particularly Shyamalan's repeated use of point-of-view shots and tight face holds on speaking characters.  At times it seems as though he's trying to remind us that this isn't real, that we're only watching a movie.  The purpose for this is hard to fathom.  It takes some time to get used to these awkward shots, but once you're comfortable with them, they no longer really interfere with the story flow.This movie is enjoyable if you don't try to put it in the context of Shyamalan's body of work.  Take your time, immerse yourself.  It's not the best movie ever, but it is a strong picture with heart.",4,"Good, but not Great",1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3010,"['Riding', 'again', 'tails', 'success', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'writer/director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'bat', 'metaphysical', 'thriller', 'time', 'more', 'purely', 'science-fictional', 'level', 'past', 'films', 'succeed', 'guess', 'kind', 'not', 'flying', 'colors.Trailers', 'ads', 'film', 'have', 'focussed', 'heavily', 'crop', 'circle', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'hoax', 'gulled', 'lot', 'people', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'known', 'be', 'work', 'artists', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'hoax', 'even', 'acknowledged', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'film', 'One', 'emphasis', 'crop', 'circles', 'was', 'Shyamalan', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'use', 'kick-start', 'plot.The', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'red', 'herring', 'anyway', 'are', 'aliens', 'who', 'appear', 'fairly', 'early', 'real', 'story', 'revolves', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'priest', 'who', 'renounced', 'vows', 'sudden', 'violent', 'death', 'wife', 'prolonged', 'crisis', 'faith', 'film', 'consistent', 'Shyamalan', 'metaphysical', 'musings', 'past', 'real', 'story', 'here.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'good', 'performance', 'Gibson', 'younger', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'good', 'rare', 'screen', 'performance', 'Officer', 'Paski', 'local', 'cop', 'friend', 'Hesses', 'are', 'underexplored', 'however', 'are', 'rest', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'story', 'others', 'simply', 'serve', 'propel', 'along.The', 'story', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Shyamalan', 'fondness', 'twists', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'least', 'engaging', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interested', 'moment', 'However', 'many', 'will', 'come', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'something', 'level', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Most', 'negative', 'criticisms', 'owe', 'less', 'quality', 'film', 'fact', ""n't"", 'same', 'par', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Taken', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'being', 'made', 'right', 'now.The', 'aliens', 'mix', 'puppetry', 'computer', 'generation', 'men', 'suits', 'disappoint', ""'re"", 'largely', 'peripheral', 'Only', 'one', 'seen', 'very', 'closely', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'disappointed', 'keep', 'mind', ""'re"", 'not', 'heart', 'story.The', 'ending', 'will', 'also', 'seem', 'very', 'pat', 'movie', 'sudden', 'halt', 'rather', 'trying', 'resolve', 'outstanding', 'questions', 'terms', 'story', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie.Technically', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'particularly', 'Shyamalan', 'repeated', 'use', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'tight', 'face', 'speaking', 'characters', 'times', 'trying', 'remind', ""n't"", 'real', ""'re"", 'only', 'watching', 'movie', 'purpose', 'hard', 'fathom', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'awkward', 'shots', 'once', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'no', 'longer', 'really', 'interfere', 'story', 'flow.This', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'put', 'context', 'Shyamalan', 'body', 'work', 'Take', 'time', 'immerse', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'strong', 'picture', 'heart']",Signs

595128,A18Y3VRG7OP4J2,B00005JL3T,Kim F.,"[0, 1]","Actually, although tense and creepy, the film isn't so much about aliens and being scared by them as it is about each person coping with their own fears.I really expected Signs to fail to live up to it's advertising and was pleasantly surprised that it actually surpassed the hype, though not quite in the way I expected. While the crop circles & aliens are definitely an issue in the movie they are not the main focus. The focus is on the family and how they are coping with their own fears and issues. This is not to say that the aliens aren't part of the story - they definitely are - but it's more a character study than a ""monster"" movie.I think that one of my favorite things about the film is how lots of little loose ends are tied up. Things that don't seem too important early on become clear and vital later in the movie. In fact, I can't think of any issue that didn't get dealt with by the end.The acting is really good on a variety of levels. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a widower who has withdrawn from his faith is touching and powerful. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job as the younger brother of Gibson who is searching for his path in life. The 2 children are good as well, turning in believable performances.All-in-all, I believe that M. Night Shyamalan has proven his talent as a director (& writer).

I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it as an enjoyable film. This one had significantly less philosophy behind it as seen in The Sixth Sense, which was magnificent. But my husband and I enjoyed the subplot concerning the loss of the farmer's wife in such a traumatic way, and her final comments to her devastated husband. Her loss triggers his own doubt of God's presence in our lives. But everything she told her husband (Gibson) at the end and in flashbacks, had a meaning which he could not see until the he experiences the signs in his cornfield and the following events involving his remaining family.The director takes it for granted that viewers will know something concerning the rash of 'signs' created in a variety of places growing corn stalks. That may be a bit of a problem for someone coming into the movie with no knowledge of the connection originally made with these occurences...that extraterrestials made them, and not human beings with too much time on their hands.Gibson...well, what can  you say. He surprised me again. He's known to be such a practical joker and so many of his films have been humorous, or he injects his own sense of humor and his ability to see life from different points of view (even a childlike faith that is damaged and then mended). When I watch him in a film now, I always expect him to be a certain type of character, but I never expected him in something as serious as this particular character or as a minister.Phoenix, as Gibson's brother, who comes to be with him when he loses his wife, is absolutely great. So were the kids. I totally get the panicked awakening of Gibson when his young daughter stands at his bedside silently. My own kids have pulled that one on me. I also used to do it to my own parents, to make sure they were still there.There is more humor in this film, and it isn't as dark as his last film. There are a couple of parts in the film I'll always remember...first, where the two grownups run around the house screaming threats because they think punks are playing tricks on them. Then the picture of the two children with foil cones on their heads, with their uncle in between them, also wearing a foil cone. Just extremely funny, in an unfunny situation.So it's not deep...big deal.

It appears that a lot of people went to it with the expectation that it would be a sci-fi movie. And a lot of people watched the whole thing while still under the impression that they were watching a badly-done sci-fi movie. They pick it apart as though it were a sci-fi movie, because that's what it seems to be. And, quite frankly, when viewed with that mindset, it really does fail miserably.But only if you think Signs is a sci-fi movie. It's not. Signs is actually a fable. Like ""The Three Little Pigs,"" or ""Little Red Riding Hood."" It's meant to be viewed with the same mindset one uses when viewing ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" or most of Miyazaki's movies.

Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe. This supernatural thriller intricately weaves a well-crafted story about one man's journey of faith as he deals with the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence. And what I personally found to be a refreshing change from other flicks I have seen that have dealt with a similar theme is that this movie is just as entertaining as it is enlightening. It shines a bright flashlight upon the inner roller coaster of faith and yet gently illuminates in a subtle way that I found to be neither preachy or condescending. I also enjoyed the light-hearted moments in this movie well executed by a superb cast of talented actors portraying likable characters blending in just enough humor to balance out some of the more seriously intense scenes of dramatic tension.

As I'm sure you know,in Wells ""War of the Worlds"", the invading Martians fall victim to the simplest of threats.The common bacteria that is part of daily life on the Earth.Something the Martians hadnt considered as a threat due to their ignorance of it.  Thus the ""devil in the details"" punchline of the story.But in ""Signs"",The bad space guys are like...hyper allergic to water...(The stuff that covers  79% of the Earths surface).These bad space guys, they can  master space travel But cant figure out that the Earth, being covered with water, might not be the best place to start a shooting war.Had they considered rain?I can understand the Martians, in ""War of the Worlds"", not being completely squared away on the bacteria issue. But to have water as your primary tactical weakness, and not notice that the whole place is covered with the stuff, can only bring to question the intelligence of this menace from space.One reason why Hitler didnt go after Switzerland was that he didnt want to get cut to pieces in the Alps.But these arch-evil space guys,(who of course utilize surprisingly substandard communications equipment),dont have the tactical wherewithal to ask themsevles just what they were going to do with a water covered planet in the first place.I mean the stuff does kill them.When you throw in the subplots and the ""surprise ending"",you basically have a ""War of the Worlds"" re-write.  One that isnt at all original,nor entertaining.But instead, disappointing.Anybody that would buy the snake oil this movie is selling has no real idea about science fiction.Heres a hint,the best fiction has an element of truth to it.To come up with a species this stupid that is supposed to be this advanced is so countradictory that from a literary standpoint, its insulting.",2,"""SIGNS, SIGNS, EVERYWHERE ARE SIGNS...""",1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1883,"['what', 'be', 'worst', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'ever', 'Shyamalantakes', 'H.G.Wells', 'premise', 'absurd', 'level', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'Wells', 'War', 'Worlds', 'invading', 'Martians', 'fall', 'victim', 'simplest', 'threats.The', 'common', 'bacteria', 'part', 'daily', 'life', 'Earth.Something', 'Martians', 'hadnt', 'considered', 'threat', 'due', 'ignorance', 'Thus', 'devil', 'details', 'punchline', 'story.But', 'Signs', 'bad', 'space', 'guys', 'are', 'allergic', 'water', 'stuff', '79', '%', 'Earths', 'surface', '.These', 'bad', 'space', 'guys', 'can', 'master', 'space', 'travel', 'cant', 'figure', 'out', 'Earth', 'being', 'covered', 'water', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'shooting', 'war.Had', 'considered', 'rain', 'can', 'understand', 'Martians', 'War', 'Worlds', 'not', 'being', 'completely', 'squared', 'away', 'bacteria', 'issue', 'have', 'water', 'primary', 'tactical', 'weakness', 'not', 'notice', 'whole', 'place', 'covered', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'bring', 'question', 'intelligence', 'menace', 'space.One', 'reason', 'why', 'Hitler', 'didnt', 'go', 'Switzerland', 'was', 'want', 'get', 'cut', 'pieces', 'Alps.But', 'arch-evil', 'space', 'guys', 'who', 'course', 'utilize', 'surprisingly', 'substandard', 'communications', 'equipment', 'dont', 'have', 'tactical', 'wherewithal', 'ask', 'themsevles', 'just', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'water', 'covered', 'planet', 'first', 'place.I', 'mean', 'stuff', 'kill', 'them.When', 'throw', 'subplots', 'surprise', 'ending', 'basically', 'have', 'War', 'Worlds', 're-write', 'One', 'isnt', 'original', 'entertaining.But', 'instead', 'disappointing.Anybody', 'would', 'buy', 'snake', 'oil', 'movie', 'selling', 'real', 'idea', 'science', 'fiction.Heres', 'hint', 'best', 'fiction', 'element', 'truth', 'it.To', 'come', 'up', 'species', 'stupid', 'supposed', 'be', 'advanced', 'so', 'countradictory', 'literary', 'standpoint', 'insulting']",Signs

West ""KW11""","[62, 71]","Ok, I've read a few of the negative reviews that people did on this movie so I thought I'd take the time to defend it for all of you who haven't seen the film but are considering buying it.Signs was not your typical alien invasion movie.  There aren't any dazzling special effects.  There's no graphic alien attack scenes.  There are no images of the usual global chaos that generally accompany an alien invasion.  This was no ""Independence Day"" type movie.Rather than doing the usual Alien movie, Shyamalan decides to take a different approach.  If you've seen The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, you should already be familiar with his directing style.  Rather than making a big movie centered around a big event, he takes things to a more personal level.  He takes a character living what appears to be a typical or small life and gives them some extraordinary circumstance to deal with.  Its not about everyone else when it comes to his movies.  The story is never REALLY about the weird events, but rather, about the character's experiences with them.I really think some people were disappointed in Signs because it wasn't at all what they expected.  They went into the movie thinking it would be all the things I listed that it was not.Now I'll tell you what it was and hopefully you'll take the time to watch this movie and enjoy it as much as I did.This was a movie full of both humor and suspense.  Signs is about a family and how they come together to deal with the idea that not only are we not alone in the universe, but that aliens might be preparing an invasion.  Shyamalan manages to make us laugh at all the right moments as well as make us jump back with surprise.  He has a real way of catching us off guard which is one of the reasons why I loved Signs.  Just when you begin to relax, something exciting or scary or strange will happen to put you back on the edge of your seat.But more importantly, Shyamalan adds something new to the usual formula of alien movies.  He puts the element of faith into the plot.  Not only is the lead character (Mel gibson) dealing with the idea of aliens attacking, but he's also trying to deal with the death of his wife and his lost faith.  The alien invasion causes him to ask the question, does everything happen for a reason?  Or are we all on our own here?But make no mistake, this is not a movie I'd let a child see.  It gets pretty scary at times so if you're not one who enjoys getting freaked out every 10 minutes, Signs is not for you.If you are one who enjoys great films... rent or buy signs.

Signs, from director M. Night Shyamalan is a mellow yet gripping, edge of your seat thriller in the strongest sense of the term.  Although I'd heard several disparaging remarks about this film, I'm quite glad that I'd not listened to them.  This film is a fine addition to your DVD collection!The premise:  MINOR SPOILERSMel Gibson stars as a farmer and former pastor whose lost his wife due to a horrible auto accident and consequently he's lost his faith in God.  He wakes up one morning to find that his two young children are out of the house and screaming.  On his way out of the house, he runs in to his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix (of Gladiator fame).  They frantically search for and find them in the corn field where crop ""signs"" have been emblazoned in his corn crops.What follows from this point is clearly one of the finest suspense/thriller films this viewer has watched in quite some time.  As writer, director and actor, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a fine film that in no uncertain terms will quickly bring you into it emotionally and leave you exhausted at the end.  Of particular note is the older style of movie making where the director does not immediately put the special effects right in your face.  For the better part, until the end of the movie, he leaves much of the suspense to the imagination.  In doing this, he creates even more suspense for the viewer than any other format might've done.The musical score for the film lends perfectly to every scene, from the mellow to the highly dramatic.

From the unsuccessful pretensions of the director to be the next Spielberg to Mel Gibson's over-the-top mugging (I wouldn't call it acting), this movie falls flat in almost every area. The story revolves around a thoroughly unconvincing crisis of faith in the lead character (Gibson), complete with cornball (no pun intended) flashbacks to his wife's death. This scene in particular displays the film's faults - improbable situation coupled with absurd dialogue, and Mel Gibson's utterly unbelievable portrayal of a distraught husband/man-of-the-cloth. And then - aliens invade earth! In what I kept hoping was a dream sequence that would turn the movie's ending into a Sixth Sense-style twist, the improbable and pointless presence of hostile aliens instead turns the film into a ridiculous B-grade sci-fi ""horror"" flick.

When I say this, I mean actually SHOW the alien's face as in ""you get a good look at it"". If this wouldn't of happened and Shyamalan would of found a better way to end it, ""Signs"" would have been a much better movie. Besides the revealing of the face, where is the true horror? Yes, there was a couple of parts that made me jump, but it wasn't frightening enough. The comedy that was placed in the film didn't quite overwhelm it, but some of it wasn't necessary. I can understand completely that when some (or alot) of people went to see ""Signs"", they were hoping for a pure horror/drama with only a tiny bit of humor maybe here and there. So, the concept of the whole ""fun scary-type film"" got me kind of disappointed in the end. When I walked out of the theater I just said 'that wasn't at all like I hoped it would be'. The typical ending, the alien...the fact that it just wasn't frightening ENOUGH. Oh yes, the whole movie? Everything?

Night Shyamalan's so much. He so perfectly crafts his film to pull you into the story, make you care about the characters and keep you at the edge of your seat. He not only builds suspense, but knows how far to push before letting off with some sort of comic relief in order to maintain a very high level of interest and suspense. A stark contrast to this is Panic Room in which David Fincher does a great job of creating suspense, but pushes so hard on the suspense that there isn't any possibility to sustain that through the film. You get so tired of being so suspended for so long that ultimately the effect wears off.Mel Gibson is at the top of that list, with an excellent performance as a man who loses faith but continues to fight to hold his family together despite his many emotional ups and downs.

The local animals start acting strange. He sees disturbing shadow figures prowling around his house and feild at night. Crop circles are popping up all over the world...This movie has genuine charm to it. The first time I saw it, it gave me horrible creeps(coming from someone who thought 'The Exorcist' wasn't scary).

595145,A3LOXOMPX3ZPRK,B00005JL3T,"Lawrence Brown ""Larry Brown""","[1, 15]","SPOILER ALERTMany reviewers here complained about the ridiculous plot holes and I agree. It's full of holes.I see a lot of movies and I will walk if it looks lousy. There's 20+ movies to choose from, why waste time on a lousy one? If I hear lame dialog, a trite or cliche script, if I roll my eyes more than twice, I'm outta there. If the writer and director are lousy, they're not going to get any better. An exception to this is when they hire another writer or director after firing the lame one. An example of this is ""The Muppets Take Manhattan,"" where the first half is lousy, but the second half is good and even great in some parts.I walked on ""Signs"" after about 40 minutes and didn't look back. However, a family member insisted that it was good and all came together in the end, so I went back and watched the entire movie, start to end. Boy was I sorry, I should have stayed away.The movie is ridiculous on various levels, but besides that, it has nothing worthwhile to offer.As soon as the aliens came into the story, I was able to accurately predict the entire story: Aliens may or may not be here. As the movie progresses, the evidence of the aliens becomes more pronounced until we begin to see glimpses of them. From there we will go into the climax where we have a showdown with the aliens and win. That's a synopsis of the plot and who, I mean who, is going to say there is anything at all original about that? No one over the age of 13.The movie plays out just as I predicted. But there's some quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo thrown in there that's really the point of the story. Fine, the only problem is that the mumbo-jumbo is so utterly ridiculous that it's laughable.Unless I'm missing something (unlikely), the plot is this: God causes Gibson's wife to get horribly injured in an accident where she suffers in agony until Gibson can get there, whereupon she delivers a coded message from God to Gibson, without Gibson realizing it, and then she dies. This accident causes Gibson to lose his faith in God. Meanwhile, God has caused another family member that is a budding baseball star to suffer an injury and his career and life are ruined. Then, God causes the kid to have asthma and an irrational preoccupation with water, resulting in half glasses of water being left all over the house. Then, God causes all these circumstances to work together during an alien invasion of earth such that the coded message, the asthma, the water, and the sports career work together to defeat the aliens in the house and save lives. Gibson sees how God has wrought all of this and regains his faith. If that's it, that's the most utterly ridiculous, blasphemous, lame, contrived, etc story I've ever heard of.So I'm wondering two things: 1: Is my understanding of the story complete and my laughter is justified, or did I miss something? And 2: How on earth did the guy that wrote the brilliant ""The 6th Sense"" write this load of tripe? It would seem that his contract with the movie studio includes a ""right of subcontract"" and he subcontracted his swimming pool cleaning guy to write this.",1,"Total crap, an utter waste of time.

Graham is a priest-turned-farmer, wallowing in the wake of his wife's death.  But that is just one of the problems facing him when this movie starts.  If you've seen previews of this film, you no doubt know that crop circles center heavily in the storyline.  But never in a way that you would expect.Now I will admit that about 30 minutes into the film, I sat in the theater thinking, ""Where in the heck is this all leading to?""  I was starting to think that this movie was going to be a major dud, and that I'd forked over [money] for disappointment.  But that's when the movie slams on the gas pedal and doesn't slow down.  This is the only movie - and I mean, the ONLY movie - that has made my body shake for an hour and a half.  The tension and dread-like feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" is absolutely excruciating.  M. Night Shyamalan (who wrote, directed, produced, AND acted in this movie) is clearly taking over as the King of Suspense when it comes to thriller-type movies.  He knows just when to hit you full-force in the face with something; he knows when to hint at something; and he's very good at making you think one thing is going to happen when something else really does.I will not go much further into this film.  I don't want to give away any plot points.  But, my gosh, you cannot go wrong with this film.  If you liked such great movies such as ""The Others"" and ""Sixth Sense,"" this movie will be right up your haunted alley.  If you are looking for a movie where the power of suggestion is more frightening than what you might actually see, this movie is for you (I could write an entire review just based on that in and of itself).Go see this movie.

This movie worked for me in ways that did obviously not work for others. The movie had moments of real power buttressed by excellent acting (down to assured and realistic perfomances by the children), tight, natural dialog, and outstanding direction. People talk about how creepy this movie is and what makes this true is how isolated all the characters are: no one feels truly safe when the truly extraordinary happens. This movie engrossed me completely....I found it fascinating.As many people have pointed out, the movie hinges on the question of lost faith and, while this is true, I think the question of faith is much broader here than in strictly a religious sense. The movie's power comes from the universal love/hate relationship that we all have with the particular world view that is the foundation of who we are. In the case of Mel Gibson's character, he tries to deny any further relationship with God. But anyone who has ever had a crisis of faith, whether it be in one's church, in God, in humanity, in a relationship, in science, in whether the Red Sox will ever overcome the Curse of the Bambino (and we all now know the answer to that one), knows how hard it is to simply shut down the object of one's faith. And it is quite likely that we will return to that object of faith because we ultimately do not have a choice. In this movie, the aliens serve merely as the vehicle to make this point.I'll admit, I loved this movie for the ways the characters interacted and for the movie's message.

Yes the director bit a heck of a lot off to throw into a rather small scale intimate movie. But I for one was thankful he did.Creepy? Heck yes. Thought provoking? Most certainly. Are the performances first rate? A resounding yes. A feat in itself as I am not a fan of good ole boy Mel. But this movie really left me with a lot to think of. Something that is all the more special in its effects/affects than some of the trite and shallow critiques I have read thus far.Kind of tired of the computer graphics driven idiots that feel that good film making = big budget slam, bam, lobotomized mam.

""O Cordova""","[0, 0]","I enjoyed this movie and the concept of once again, dumb aliens wanting to come to this planet and get a piece of the pie.  Signs, a movie about the signs of spiritually being lost, and not believing to have faith when things go bad.  It seemed if that was one point of this movie, mixed in with the Alien being part.  ""What No""  Signs, the belief that we have been visited by alien beings in the past, who are now deciding, that they now want to come to this planet to stay, but first need to find a way of getting rid of its pest like inhabitants.  You defintely have to watch this movie in the dark and with as much silence as possible to get the full of effect, or you will fall asleep.  One thing for sure, I do not want to walk or run in corn stalk fields at night.  Second thing, I hate creepy dark basements, especially when a alien like arm trys to grab you!  The boy in this movie seems to be of a higher intelligence then the grown ups, in some parts I thought he was creepier then the aliens. I sure hate the part of the dog being done in by the boy, and I sure in heck did not like it when the second dog was left outside.  One day ""Aliens"" will smarten up, and find a way to really get us.  So, ""watch it"".

It's like the producers decided that, once Mel Gibson signed on for the project, they didn't need to bother with anything else, like a script that made any sense.  And to a point they were right.  Mel Gibson's acting was fantastic, as was that of the supporting cast, and for a little while at least you can enjoy the movie on that superficial level.  And if the alien element were removed and the film concentrated on character development, it might have worked.  The story arc about a reverend who loses and then regains his faith could have supported this film on its own, but for some reason they decided to throw a supernatural twist into the mix and introduce us to the dumbest aliens ever.  Forget the fact that these aliens traveled billions of miles to randomly kill people for no reason.  Forget the fact that these aliens who are smart enough to develop intergalactic travel aren't smart enough to develop a way to break a door down.  Forget the fact that these aliens can navigate their way safely across the galaxy, but can't find Mexico City without ruining some poor farmer's crops.  The most assinine thing is that these aliens are so stupid that, even though water is poisonous to them, they try to invade a world that is mostly made of water.  Duh.If you are a Mel Gibson fan, pick this film up.  He doesn't let the foolishness of the script interfere with his acting.  If you are looking for a story, however, look elsewhere.

This is quality film making, and I think the general populace has forgotten what that is.  M. Night Shyamalan is a breath of fresh air; a hands-on film maker/storyteller.  His direction reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock.  He has the confidence in us, the viewers, to allow our imagination some well-deserved exercise.  Hollywood has patronized our intellect; we've been spoon-fed blood and guts for so long now that we don't know how to fill in the blanks anymore . . .Before seeing Signs, I did not know anything about the story other than it was a test of one man who had lost Faith and that it had to do with crop circles and the fact they may have been created by aliens.  I was hesitant to see it because I thought ""crop circles, how lame!"".  I will now admit I was extremely touched by the story.  I was so sucked into the movie that I never gave the hokey premise a second thought.  It unfolded, neatly yet surreally, for me as I discovered what the characters were discovering.  My husband, who saw this movie in the theater some time ago, was kind enough not to give me any additional information other than what I had seen in the trailers and I will extend that courtesy to you.  For this film, it is better not to know too much.On a technical note, the acting was terrific - - I fully believed in each of the characters, and their roles were adequately developed to the extent necessary.  The children were wonderful actors, as was Joaquin Phoenix and, of course, Mel Gibson.As a mother of four, I was completely at ease sitting beside my children watching this film.  No uncomfortable sex scenes, no uncomfortable language.  I remember being impressed by some of the dialogue, realizing that people don't do that in movies anymore - - sit and talk in complete sentences without stuff exploding behind them - - talking for the sake of revealing their characters, their relationships, their motivations, the story.  That's not to say this movie is not scary - - my children are between the ages of 3 and 12 (the 3  yr old twins played in their room because the opening music was too scary for their taste), and they are all comfortable with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and other ""high-brow"" horror like Sam Raimi's ""Army of Darkness"", so the scary parts of this movie - - and there are some intense situations - - were not too much for them.  It could be too scary for other children, though.While I love to be entertained by a film, even scared by a film, I mostly enjoy being made to think after a film.  This is a wonderful story about Faith.  We have all wondered why bad things happen, and we've all heard the cliches - - when one door closes, another opens - - only God knows - - etc. - - and I think Mr. Shyamalan has given us a tale that is entertaining, suspenseful, well-crafted, visually pleasing, and good old-fashioned fun!  It is not often that I believe a film will be a classic but I do believe Signs will stand the test of timelessness.",5,I was hesitant but pleasantly rewarded - - a very good film,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,3034,"['saw', 'Signs', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'think', 'general', 'populace', 'forgotten', 'what', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'hands-on', 'film', 'maker/storyteller', 'direction', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'confidence', 'viewers', 'allow', 'imagination', 'well-deserved', 'exercise', 'Hollywood', 'patronized', 'intellect', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoon-fed', 'blood', 'guts', 'so', 'long', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'fill', 'blanks', 'anymore', 'seeing', 'Signs', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'story', 'other', 'was', 'test', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'Faith', 'had', 'do', 'crop', 'circles', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'aliens', 'was', 'hesitant', 'see', 'thought', 'crop', 'circles', 'how', 'lame', 'will', 'now', 'admit', 'was', 'extremely', 'touched', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'sucked', 'movie', 'never', 'gave', 'hokey', 'premise', 'second', 'thought', 'unfolded', 'neatly', 'yet', 'surreally', 'discovered', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'discovering', 'husband', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'kind', 'enough', 'not', 'give', 'additional', 'information', 'other', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'trailers', 'will', 'extend', 'courtesy', 'film', 'better', 'not', 'know', 'too', 'technical', 'note', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'fully', 'believed', 'characters', 'roles', 'were', 'adequately', 'developed', 'extent', 'necessary', 'children', 'were', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'was', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'course', 'Mel', 'Gibson.As', 'mother', 'four', 'was', 'completely', 'ease', 'sitting', 'children', 'watching', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'sex', 'scenes', 'uncomfortable', 'language', 'remember', 'being', 'impressed', 'dialogue', 'realizing', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'movies', 'anymore', 'sit', 'talk', 'complete', 'sentences', 'stuff', 'exploding', 'talking', 'sake', 'revealing', 'characters', 'relationships', 'motivations', 'story', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'children', 'are', 'ages', '3', '12', '3', 'yr', 'old', 'twins', 'played', 'room', 'opening', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'scary', 'taste', 'are', 'comfortable', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'other', 'high-brow', 'horror', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'scary', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'intense', 'situations', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'other', 'children', 'though.While', 'love', 'be', 'entertained', 'film', 'even', 'scared', 'film', 'mostly', 'enjoy', 'being', 'made', 'think', 'film', 'wonderful', 'story', 'Faith', 'have', 'wondered', 'why', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'cliches', 'when', 'one', 'door', 'closes', 'only', 'God', 'etc', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'given', 'tale', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'well-crafted', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'fun', 'not', 'often', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'do', 'Signs', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'timelessness']",Signs

It's a dog, but a dead mutt and it stinks.Mel Gibson gives as much as he possibly can with a [bad] script. It's not his fault. He is an expert professional actor and does his best. To his credit, he plays it seriously. Good for Mel!The story could have been successful, except M. Night Shyamalan decided to keep things dark. He probably wanted to make a claustrophobic thriller. All the tricks of the trade, designed to shake audiences were left out, except the ringing of a phone, especially amplified to awake the viewers. Oh, and turning off the lights at the proper moment. (All toddlers go into panic at that point, but then they do it because they can't see the bowl of popcorn and are afraid they won't be able to eat it.)""Signs"" is really a shocker in reverse. Apparently there has been an alien invasion of earth. How do we know this? Well, they show us some lights on a TV screen, in a newscast from Mexico. What made ""Independence Day"" famous (special effects and moving action), doesn't exist here. ""Signs"" lacks everything.It gets worse. They have this alien, an emaciated and anorexic fellow dressed in green. Aw, pleeeze! Gimme a break! My 6-year-old neighbor does it better for Halloween. No matter. They show a scene that ""contains disturbing material"" on that TV screen within the movie. This time from Brazil. A group of terrified children, running from one window to another, screaming in fear. (If they are so scared, why do they ask for more instead of going to Mom's lap? Are we supposed to be terrified by terrified children? Yes, we are. Sorry, it's true.) And then... yes, the skinny green fellow appears an disappears and the viewer says: ""What was THAT?""The scene by the way, is ludicrous to the extreme and the actor who's supposed to see it (he watches TV inside a closet, don't ask me why: I fell asleep before they show why he does such a silly thing), well, the actor is instructed to be horrified. By a skinny green alien? Yes, by a skinny green alien. Is he really, really horrified? Yes, he is, but we think nobody else on the whole wide planet would have been.The skinny green alien was played by a skinny, anorexic-looking, emaciated actress walking against a blue back drop (one of the thrilling special effects that director Shyamalan explains in a documental included in this DVD). And, don't be surprised, everybody sucks up to Shyamalan in this documental. Call it job security.Oh, why, why does an apparently talented director indulge in such a dog? And he WROTE the damned disgraceful thing.Shall I say more? Is there room left?Yes, there's room left. Let's go to the special futures. Director Shyamalan treats us to one minute of his first movie. He was young and inexperienced. Yes. He warns us that it's bad, really bad. Okay. Don't show it then, because your fans are gonna drop like flies. But no, he shows it. It's a ""horror"" scene so bad, that my 4-year-old neighbor could have done it better. And, yes, many fans actually drop like flies, including me.All in all, did M.

595161,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JL3T,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","The beginning of this movie might make you wonder whether this is ""The River II"", with Mel Gibson once again becoming a farmer.  However, this time the antagonist isn't a river, but aliens.  It seems as though aliens have become the easy path to creation an antagonistic foil for any modern movie where you can't come up with a better antagonist.Mel Gibson plays a former minister who lost his faith when his wife was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel (played by the director of the movie).  On top of this we have a son with asthma, various people with problems of their own, and aliens with apparently wimpy technology if they can travel invisibly, jump onto the roof of a house, and yet struggle with getting through a wooden door of the house.Portions of the movie are truly eerie, and for a little while you might find the movie frightening.  However, by the time you reach the final credits, the director has required too many suspensions of logic and belief to make the movie truly satisfying.  I would enjoy detailing some of the more significant lapses of logic, but some people have enjoyed this movie, and in the event you are one of those, I do not wish to spoil it for you.  I'll just say that the director asks us to believe by the abilities and actions of these aliens that they are incredibly superior beings, yet these same aliens appear to have incredible weaknesses that might have work in the 1950s, but for the significantly more sophisticated audience of the new millennium, the solid core of technology needed to support this movie just isn't there.Another down side of the movie for me was that in addition to the logic inconsistencies, he tried to develop too many central characters without sufficient depth for us to become truly sympathetic to them.  Instead we have too many details in too short a time, thrown in with aliens that perhaps we didn't need.  The antagonist just as easily could have been Big Foot and the lapses in logic might have been fewer.Giving M. Night Shymalan credit for the few moments when I felt the movie was suspenseful, but taking away credit for the multiple implausibilities (it's hard to believe that aliens navigating between solar systems would require crop signs as navigation aids - give me a break; maybe they should go to Radio Shack or Sears and buy GPS systems), I can only give this movie three stars.

Instead, the film wants to preach to us about hope and faith while at the same time scaring our pants off with creepy clicking aliens.

Sorry, this premise was already used in the mini-TV series ""V"" from 20 years ago, which I thought handled the issue much better as a sci-fi movie.The poison gas they have that comes out their thumb was also pretty cheesy. Jeez, maybe they could have given the aliens big schlongs and they would be more of a threat to humans that way? It would have made as much sense.Most of the acting is good, as both Gibson and Phoenix are fine actors, and the scene where Phoenix gets to swing away with the baseball bat at the bad-guy alien is pretty entertaining, although not likely to endear us to future space invaders or to the Protect Hostile & Ivading Aliens advisory board.I understand this wasn't a big-budget movie and that the director is a young and upcoming type, having previously done The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, both of which I liked a lot.

It is a movie that, to my mind, is so perfectly executed that it was a tragedy that it lost out to the inferior films at the Oscars.  I think that it was dismissed mainly by those who thought it was simply a clever ghost story.  Boy, did they miss real story.  I liked Unbreakable for the same reason:  interesting story cloaking a charged, emotional message about adult life and the small miracles that many of us stopped dreaming about somewhere close to middle age.But I loathed Wide Awake, another film by M. Night Shyamalan,  It was one his first major release, and it was awful.  I made the mistake of buying the DVD.  I thought about giving it away, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  So, it sits on my shelf ready to prompt an embarrassing question like, ""Is this a good movie?""  God, I should have realized as soon as I saw Rosie O'Donnell in the credits that it would be a mistake to watch further.But I'd forgotten about Wide Awake when I sat down to watch Signs.  After all, it was in the distant past.  M. Night had demonstrated that he had overcome his early ineptness at storytelling; that he had grown into a mature, highly intelligent filmmaker who would wow us again.I was wrong.  Signs is closer to Wide Awake than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  Let me tell you why I came away empty--despite Roger Ebert giving it 4 stars (?!).Signs is another metaphorical story, a message movie about crises of faith cloaked in a story about an alien invasion.  In the same way, The Sixth Sense was a story about how people grow dead to each other, how husbands and wives, for example, neglect each other, act is if they don't exist in the real world, and otherwise become the living dead.  So too, Unbreakable was a story about growing up and losing faith in oneself and in the magic of waking up in an amazing and miraculous world.But where The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable told their subtextual story in clever, subtle, and artistic ways, Signs is ham-handed, unconvincing, and, ultimately, a preachy little mess of a movie.  Unlike Night's other films, the cover story is neither coherent nor convincing.They won't let me give any ""spoilers"" in this review, so can't include my catalog of errors, inconsistencies, and plot holes.  So, you'll just have to add them up.Now, this movie clearly isn't as bad as Wide Awake.  I found Mel Gibson's character endearing, Joaquin Phoenix does a nice job, too.

But it's different in more than one sense: on one side it seems like a really low budget movie (with not too many performers, not too many locations and not too many special effects for an alien movie -at least for Hollywood's standard for alien movies).Stop! That's another thing: most people have said ""Signs"" is about aliens. Well, I found the movie to be more about loosing faith and regaining it, and the alien thing to be just the background for this, the real theme of the movie. It can be argued that the topic could have been touched in a different way, but I still liked it: I thought it was dealt with in a way that combined in a pretty unique way suspense (M. Night Shyamalan's tademark) with a LOT of humor... something you normally wouldn't expect neither in a movie of his nor in an ""alien"" movie (more to the point).

And even then, it's mostly hidden in shadowy TV-screen reflections.The problem for Shyamalan is that it isn't scary. It is somewhat suspenseful, yes. The ending, in which the Hess family borders all the windows and doors of their Philadelphia home and hides in the basement, reminds me of the classic Night Of The Living Dead.

It isn't science fiction, because Shyamalan insists on telling an alien invasion story from a microcosmic view point that never extends more than a mile or two from the Hess farm where the 'action', if I may use that term here, takes place. The only views of the rest of the world we get are from painfully stiff and fake-seeming news reports of alien ships around the world. This movie has no style, and someone ought to tell Mr. Shyamalan that there exists within the movie business numerous devices other than tripods and cranes with which to hold a camera. Either the camera is static, panning back and forth or rising above the action. There are no tracks, dollies, gimbals or anything that conveys motion, everything in the film seems to be a set-piece event with only a camera to bear witness to it. Everything in this film, characters, events, are so stiff that emotions are stifled if not smothered outright. No one reacts to anything in any consistent fashion. Worse, people's reactions to serious events are so skewed, that it quickly became unconvincing.The most noticeable examples of this are when we learn that the aliens' presence is making animals a little nutty, supposedly the way they act when a predator is nearby and one of the Hess family Shepherds lunges at Mel's daughter. The son kills the dog (off camera) with a big barbecue fork to the throat and when Mel and the sheriff arrive on the scene, the son is staring blankly, the daughter is sitting on her swing set staring blankly, with only a few mute tears between them. Mel and the sheriff stare blankly at the dead animal. However, when Mel decides to put it to a vote as to whether the family should head for the lake or stay in the farm house, the son freaks when Mel states that because he represents 2 parents that he gets two votes.There is no tension in this film. All we need to know, apparently, we learn from the son who reads ONE book on ETs and suddenly has them all figured out. And if he doesn't know it, the TV reveals everything else. If it's an invasion, he says, they won't use their advanced because we'll nuke the planet making it useless to them. They'll fight 'hand to hand' to prevent this, there seems to be no middle ground here. When it's revealed on the news that the aliens leave just as quickly as they arrived, the kid figures out that it's a raid and they're just harvesting humans. The crop circles themselves are map coordinates and while Washington and New York are major sites, so is Bucks County, Pennsylvania.The worst aspect of the film is Gibson's character. Apart from being stiff, he plays a priest/reverend/father who lost his faith when his wife died 6 months previous. But when his son doesn't die from an alien gas attack because he was having an asthma attack and didn't breath it, he suddenly finds it again, as if it were hidden behind the couch all along. Second, exactly WHICH Christian faith did he belong to? He dressed as a Catholic priest and took a confession in a drug store, yet he can't be Catholic, because he was married.Mostly though, this movie was just plain boring. I was never once on the 'edge of my seat' as so many people and the advertisements claim, and it isn't because I am so jaded a movie goer that 'Signs' just didn't reach me. I cried when Sully said good-bye to Boo in 'Monsters, Inc.' so I know it's not that. There is no suspense, no real imperilment of the family, only family pets left to die at the hands of the alien invaders. You can't makes these kinds of films in a microcosm, because there is just too much else to consider. It bored me, it really did, and I know Shyamalan can do better, because he had my undivided attention in 'The Sixth Sense', so why not this one? Because it's really that bad.",1,Alien invasion in a microcosm,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,4870,"['hate', 'when', 'writers', 'try', 'change', 'genre', 'fit', 'interpretation', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'hate', 'when', 'writers', 'try', 'change', 'genre', 'fit', 'interpretation', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'do', 'horrible', 'job', 'Personally', 'someone', 'break', 'new', 'ground', ""'m"", 'how', 'learn', 'discover', 'new', 'things', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'do', 'instead', 'corner', 'current', 'film', 'Signs', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'disenchanted', 'priest/father/minister', 'unknown', 'religion', 'trying', 'save', 'family', 'alien', 'invasion', ""'aliens"", 'can', 'apparently', 'navigate', 'hundreds', 'parsecs', 'space', 'find', 'planet', 'Earth', 'then', 'need', 'place', 'crop', 'circles', 'directional', 'positional', 'locators', 'apparently', 'Bucks', 'County', 'PA', 'such', 'import', 'place', 'crop', 'circles', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'back', 'forty', 'aliens', 'advanced', 'technology', 'can', 'get', 'locked', 'pantry.Firstly', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'not', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'thrilling', ""n't"", 'science', 'fiction', 'Shyamalan', 'telling', 'alien', 'invasion', 'story', 'microcosmic', 'view', 'point', 'never', 'more', 'mile', 'two', 'Hess', 'farm', 'where', ""'action"", 'may', 'use', 'term', 'here', 'place', 'only', 'views', 'rest', 'world', 'get', 'are', 'painfully', 'stiff', 'fake-seeming', 'news', 'reports', 'alien', 'ships', 'world', 'movie', 'style', 'someone', 'ought', 'tell', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'business', 'numerous', 'devices', 'other', 'tripods', 'cranes', 'hold', 'camera', 'camera', 'static', 'panning', 'back', 'forth', 'rising', 'action', 'are', 'tracks', 'dollies', 'gimbals', 'anything', 'motion', 'everything', 'film', 'be', 'set-piece', 'event', 'only', 'camera', 'bear', 'witness', 'Everything', 'film', 'characters', 'events', 'are', 'so', 'stiff', 'emotions', 'are', 'stifled', 'not', 'smothered', 'outright', 'one', 'anything', 'consistent', 'fashion', 'Worse', 'people', 'reactions', 'serious', 'events', 'are', 'so', 'skewed', 'quickly', 'became', 'unconvincing.The', 'most', 'noticeable', 'examples', 'are', 'when', 'learn', 'aliens', 'presence', 'making', 'animals', 'little', 'nutty', 'supposedly', 'way', 'act', 'when', 'predator', 'nearby', 'one', 'Hess', 'family', 'Shepherds', 'Mel', 'daughter', 'son', 'dog', 'camera', 'big', 'barbecue', 'fork', 'throat', 'when', 'Mel', 'sheriff', 'arrive', 'scene', 'son', 'staring', 'blankly', 'daughter', 'sitting', 'swing', 'set', 'staring', 'blankly', 'only', 'few', 'mute', 'tears', 'Mel', 'sheriff', 'stare', 'blankly', 'dead', 'animal', 'However', 'when', 'Mel', 'put', 'vote', 'family', 'should', 'head', 'lake', 'stay', 'farm', 'house', 'son', 'freaks', 'when', 'Mel', '2', 'parents', 'two', 'votes.There', 'tension', 'film', 'need', 'know', 'apparently', 'learn', 'son', 'who', 'ONE', 'book', 'ETs', 'suddenly', 'figured', 'out', ""n't"", 'know', 'TV', 'reveals', 'everything', 'else', 'invasion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'advanced', ""'ll"", 'nuke', 'planet', 'making', 'useless', ""'ll"", 'fight', ""'hand"", 'hand', 'prevent', 'be', 'middle', 'ground', 'here', 'When', 'revealed', 'news', 'aliens', 'leave', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'arrived', 'kid', 'out', 'raid', ""'re"", 'just', 'harvesting', 'humans', 'crop', 'are', 'map', 'coordinates', 'Washington', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'major', 'sites', 'so', 'Bucks', 'County', 'Pennsylvania.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'film', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Apart', 'being', 'stiff', 'priest/reverend/father', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'when', 'wife', 'died', '6', 'months', 'previous', 'when', 'son', ""n't"", 'die', 'alien', 'gas', 'attack', 'was', 'having', 'asthma', 'attack', 'did', ""n't"", 'breath', 'suddenly', 'again', 'were', 'hidden', 'couch', 'along', 'Second', 'exactly', 'WHICH', 'Christian', 'faith', 'did', 'belong', 'dressed', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'took', 'confession', 'drug', 'store', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Catholic', 'was', 'married.Mostly', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'was', 'never', 'once', ""'edge"", 'seat', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'advertisements', 'claim', ""n't"", 'am', 'so', 'jaded', 'movie', 'goer', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'cried', 'when', 'Sully', 'said', 'good-bye', 'Boo', ""'Monsters"", 'Inc.', 'so', 'know', 'not', 'suspense', 'real', 'imperilment', 'family', 'only', 'family', 'pets', 'left', 'die', 'hands', 'alien', 'invaders', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kinds', 'films', 'microcosm', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'else', 'consider', 'bored', 'really', 'did', 'know', 'Shyamalan', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'had', 'undivided', 'attention', ""'The"", 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'really', 'bad']",Signs

The thing about this movie is that it is so torturingly bad that one comes out the other end so demoralized as not to be able to think coherently, let alone deliver a bad review.  The movie centers around a crisis of faith and, ironically, it engenders a crisis of faith in me, the viewer, whose faith in mankind is shaken to its core by the fact that anyone can have tolerated this movie.  Not content with being thumpingly bad, the film also wallows in being far ickier than any of the preposterously crummy aliens we get a load of.  Mel Gibson plays a Catholic priest, with a wife and children no less, who flakes out on his religious routine after his wife is killed in a car accident.  We get to watch endless flashbacks of his wife's dying moments at the crash site.  This is so tasteless as to be mind-boggling.  It is as if this sort of thing is reasonable entertainment - something to take in while eating popcorn and taking down two big gulps that you smuggled into the theater from 7-11.  Well, apparently Father Gibson's phony faith can't take much jostling and it comes down like the house of cards it is, with Mel saying that ""there is no one watching out for us"" as if religiousness were a matter of God performing favors for you and, if you come to find it hard to believe that this is going on, since things are not going your way, you lose all religious belief.  Then, later in the movie, God seems to have woken up and started performing favors for Father Gibson again, and so he merrily dons his collar and whistles off to tend his flock again, presumably brimming with bonhomie about what a good sport God is and how recently God seems to have ensured that the tune-up given his SUV was extra-special.

595184,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JL3T,Martin Asiner,"[2, 3]","One of the problems that I had with SIGNS was to classify it.  Parts of it reminded me of standard aliens-attack-earth thrillers, new age spiritual discovery epics, and hide-out-in-the-basement horror shows from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Director M. Night Shyalaman tries with middling success to meld this variety of genres into what he clearly hoped was a thriller. Instead, what he presents is a movie that hides a sea of logical flaws behind several scenes that are effective nail biters.  These flaws become more apparent only after the closing credits roll, and the viewer takes the time to digest what he just saw.SIGNS portrays a world that suffers from a crisis of moral defection.  Mel Gibson is a priest whose wife dies horribly in front of his eyes, thereby causing him to lose faith in the power of prayer and the omnipotence of a benevolent God.  While he struggles with this crisis of conscience, the earth is invaded by a race of decidedly low-tech aliens who are so fumble-fingered that the viewer wonders how these plug-uglies could cross the street unaided, let alone bridge the intergalactic gap between the stars.  In a scene ripped straight out of George Romero, director Shyalaman locks Gibson, his brother Joaquin Phoenix, and Gibson's two young children into a basement with only a radio to fill them in on the details of the ongoing crisis.  Not content with that, Shyalaman then goes to the morally uplifting ending of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS to punctuate the belief that what distinguishes humanity from all hostile ETs is our fundamental belief in a higher power that tells us that all elements in our lives are intertwined in a spiritual tapestry that does not allow for unlikely coincidence.  Gibson and Phoenix, however, are surprisingly effective in reacting to a claustrophobic house that comes under alien assault.After watching this movie, I concluded that if the next alien invasion were to happen along the lines of SIGNS, then human beings have little to fear from a bunch of aliens who could learn a much needed lesson from John Wayne in how to kick a door down.",3,All 'Signs' Point to Other Films,1042588800,"01 15, 2003",2003,2101,"['One', 'problems', 'had', 'SIGNS', 'was', 'classify', 'Parts', 'reminded', 'standard', 'aliens-attack-earth', 'thrillers', 'new', 'age', 'spiritual', 'discovery', 'epics', 'hide-out-in-the-basement', 'horror', 'shows', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyalaman', 'middling', 'success', 'meld', 'variety', 'genres', 'what', 'clearly', 'hoped', 'was', 'thriller', 'Instead', 'what', 'movie', 'sea', 'logical', 'flaws', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'nail', 'biters', 'flaws', 'become', 'more', 'apparent', 'only', 'closing', 'credits', 'roll', 'viewer', 'time', 'digest', 'what', 'just', 'saw.SIGNS', 'portrays', 'world', 'crisis', 'moral', 'defection', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'priest', 'wife', 'horribly', 'front', 'eyes', 'thereby', 'causing', 'lose', 'faith', 'power', 'prayer', 'omnipotence', 'benevolent', 'God', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'earth', 'invaded', 'race', 'decidedly', 'low-tech', 'aliens', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'fumble-fingered', 'viewer', 'how', 'plug-uglies', 'could', 'cross', 'street', 'unaided', 'let', 'alone', 'bridge', 'intergalactic', 'gap', 'stars', 'scene', 'ripped', 'straight', 'George', 'Romero', 'director', 'Shyalaman', 'Gibson', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Gibson', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'basement', 'only', 'radio', 'fill', 'details', 'ongoing', 'crisis', 'Not', 'content', 'Shyalaman', 'then', 'morally', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'punctuate', 'belief', 'what', 'humanity', 'hostile', 'ETs', 'fundamental', 'belief', 'higher', 'power', 'elements', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'spiritual', 'tapestry', 'not', 'allow', 'unlikely', 'coincidence', 'Gibson', 'Phoenix', 'however', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'reacting', 'claustrophobic', 'house', 'alien', 'assault.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'concluded', 'next', 'alien', 'invasion', 'were', 'happen', 'lines', 'SIGNS', 'then', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'little', 'fear', 'bunch', 'aliens', 'who', 'could', 'learn', 'much', 'needed', 'lesson', 'John', 'Wayne', 'how', 'kick', 'door', 'down']",Signs

He's a fairly miserable character at the start of this movie as he has recently lost his wife in a horrendous accident. He was a minister when his wife had her accident and through flashbacks we can see that he lost his faith and blames God for the loss of his wife and subsequently left his church.  The entire household is miserable because of the wife's loss and are made far more miserable by the anger they know he harbors.  OK so that's the subplot.Into the story comes a bewildering crop circle. It is assumed that it was created by pranksters until the news reports that there are thousands of these circles that appeared all over the earth, in every country. The kids are terrified by the very real threat of alien invasion.  Meanwhile, their Dad tries to remain their rock solid support and deny the existence of any aliens.Now that I laid the groundwork I don't want to go any further because it might just ruin the movie for you.

595186,A258YDD6553JA2,B00005JL3T,Mary F. Sibley,"[3, 12]","Has anyone seen the ""real"" M. Night Shyamalan lately? The genius who was responsible for The Sixth Sense? Where has he wandered and will he ever return to the writing and directing form we know so well? As King Monghut (Yul Brynner) in The King and I would have said, ""is a mystery"" that I am loathe to solve.This reviewer has come away from his latest creation, Signs, and is wondering just what Mr. Shyamalan had on his mind as he envisioned and wrote it. He has produced, for all intents and purposes, two totally different sets of subject matter that are bucking the yoke that tries mightily to bind them, and the results are uneven and forced.Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, who until six months ago, was an ordained minister, married and the father of a young son and daughter. Tragically, his entire world is turned upside down when a young man (M. Night Shyamalan) falls asleep at the wheel of his car one night and crashes into a truck. The unlikely victim in this collision was not either driver, but Hess's wife, Colleen (Patricia Kalember) who had been taking a walk down the dark country road before dinner and is caught between the two vehicles, ""pinned."" We are shown throughout the film, at emotional times of trouble, flashbacks of that terrible night and the repercussions that resulted. As a result of this accident, Hess leaves the constrictions of his vocation and questions his faith with unceasing volatility, until a series of crop ""signs"" are discovered on his property.His young brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), has moved in with the family to help keep the farm, hearth and kin afloat as it is ferried down the River Styx and to the open arms of aliens who will make up the ""second"" story of this film. Merrill had a promising career as a minor league baseball player, but had the unfortunate habit of hitting every ball with such force and abandon that he literally played himself out a job and into the record books as possessing, among other things, the record for most strikeouts. As a result, he has never realized his full potential and is now employed at a gas station.Morgan and Bo Hess (played respectively by Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) are strange, out of sort children. Morgan has the ""tic"" of always assuming that there is a problem with any water that she drinks and as a result, the house is littered with glass upon glass that will present an encouraging turn of events as the film progresses (think of visions of The Wizard of Oz). Bo, as played by the younger brother of Macauley Culkin, is that child actor, ""flavour of the month"" that seems to permeate films today. He is old beyond his years and possesses the wisdom of the ages, or so we would be led to believe. His Achilles Heel is to suffer from asthma, and that too, will play a prominent part in the film.What is puzzling about this film is that Shyamalan can't make up his mind precisely what he wants to present to the viewer. Is it a story about feeling that God has abandoned a true believer in his hour of true need, or, is this a story about aliens and the wrath that they want to incur? Either story could have been built upon, but as separate units; rather like a ""two for two"" sale. Is the audience supposed to be mesmerized by a story that seems to borrow occasionally from George Pal's 1953 classic, The War of the Worlds or be stupefied by the desertion of Hess from his faith? It's extremely hard to fathom just how this family, this dysfunctional foursome, manage to hold it all together in the face of the alien invasion. Phoenix's one display of true emotion was garnered when he watched a news report on television of a birthday party video from Brazil on national news, that showed an alien in all his consummate and unwelcome glory. The senior Hess's make the decision to barricade themselves in their home and while this is fine and reasonable up to a point, at what juncture were they supposed to question their supplies, food, escape routes, or most importantly, making real contact with others in their community? Gibson does make an unexpected visit to Ray Reddy (Shyamalan), after receiving an aborted call, and discovers that while Reddy is ""ready"" to leave the area, he has left a ""caller"" locked in the kitchen pantry for Gibson to investigate, as we know he will. What is so incredible in this story, though, is the suggestion presented that the aliens, with all their technological wizardry, are susceptible to a very common thing here on Earth (a la ""The War of the Worlds). One wonders if H. G. Wells (author of The War of the Worlds) were alive today, along with Barre Lyndon (writer for the film of the same name), could they sue for infringement?The special effects of Signs are of the maniacal, crazed and evil variety - translation: the aliens. They are a decided change from the charmers of Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind who sought to be our friends. As in The War of the Worlds, Shymalan's are up to no good. Verbalizations by his aliens are akin to those as displayed in John McTiernan's 1987 film Predator, and are of the clicking variety (another liberal ""borrowing""), and their body makeup is as we have always taught it would be - green, but these visitors are NOT little.The one saving grace for Signs is the musical score by James Newton Howard. The four opening notes of the film reminded this reviewer of the opening notes from ""Danse Macbre"" by Saint Saens, and just as eerie. Howard has been in tandem with Shyamalan's films since the inception of The Sixth Sense and parlayed his success to Unbreakable and now Signs. It puts one in mind of the long association that Bernard Herrmann had with Alfred Hitchcock and one wonders if Howard will continue in the same vein as his esteemed colleague. Howard's score is ripe with characterizations and his three note motif is played with a variety of success throughout. Of course, some adoption has also come via Herrmann's most famous score for Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" with piercing violins, and while this is not totally a bad thing in and of itself, it cheapens an otherwise fantastic rendering by him.Shyamalan is missing in action, searching for that previous success that made his film The Sixth Sense, a household name and the sentence, ""I see dead people"" a catch phrase that still reverberates to this day. ""There's a monster outside my bedroom door. Can I have a glass of water?"", uttered by Bo, simply doesn't convey the same spine tingling scariness as that uttered by Haley Joel Osment. Perhaps Shyamalan needs to back away from the business of horror for a while and concentrate all of his energies on building a story that truly draws his audience into another world. Signs is a bastardized pretender to the throne and as Shakespeare would have said, it's ""much ado about nothing.""",2,Neither A Lender Nor A Borrower Be,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,6819,"['Has',

595189,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JL3T,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","""Signs"" is a sci-fi thriller which succeeds on a cinematic level because its director, M Night Shyamalan, is, like Hitchcock, Wilder, Scorsese, Spielberg and others, a master of the art of making movies. Every gifted filmmakers, past and present, does not produce a winner every time, and I suspect that ""Signs"" will be viewed in later years as one of Shayamalan's weaker entries. The problem is a script, which he wrote, that is intriguing but not completely thought out. There are too many obvious lapses in logic, and these prevent the viewer from becoming immersed in the story. [I can't go into much detail without ruining the movie for those who have not seen it.]The story takes place in rural Pennsylvania, where Graham Hesse [Mel Gibson] lives on a farm with his two young children and his brother, Merrill [Joaquin Phoenix]. They reside in a lovely Victorian farmhouse surround by cornfields. [One lapse in logic I can note is that Hesse never once does any work in these fields; in fact, no farm implements are ever seen.] He is a clergyman who lost his faith when his wife was killed in an accident. His interest in God and spirituality is nil. One beautiful morning, the family awakens to discover a large crop circle in the cornfields. Soon these circles begin appearing all over the world, and it appears that they may be the work of aliens. Hesse must consider the impact this possibility may have on his family, all the while battling his own feelings about the Almighty.""Signs"" almost succeeds in overcoming its script weaknesses because Shyamalan is so knowledgeable about film technique. At times the movie is genuinely frightening, often not because of what we see or hear but because of what we don't see or hear. The director knows how to let our imaginations run wild and how to keep us in suspense. And in a way, it doesn't matter that ""Signs"" isn't his strongest work because he's still good enough to make us look forward to his next movie. Some critics have been harshly dismissive towards ""Signs"", but I would remind them that the director is still very young.

595190,A2YJ9DT9YZ0DUN,B00005JL3T,Matthew K. Minerd,"[1, 1]","About once a year, I get an itching to pull out a copy of Signs and watch the movie, although I always approach such temptations with more than a little reservation.  The first time I saw the film in the theater, I was not overawed by the production, although it seemed to me to be an acceptable thriller with a bit of a trite ""destiny"" theme with a very strong cast of main characters.  Because of this first lukewarm appreciation which I had for the film, I always have reservation as I pull my copy of Signs off the shelf, afraid that the itching will ultimately end in my dislike of the movie.  However, after the third or fourth reviewing - and quite a deal of growing up - I can unequivocally say that Signs is a fantastic movie and believe that I now have the experiential wherewithal  to elaborate a bit on why this is my overall impression of the film.It is perhaps in its weakest point that Signs is most strongly supported for its perpetual enjoyment.  That weakness lies in the fact that, on the whole, the film is very ""cool"" - in the media sense of leaving much to the viewer's interpretation.  At first glance, this coolness can appear to be nothing other than laziness on the part of the director and writers of the film.  More is accomplished by wisps, shades, and intrigue than by direct dialogue.  This open environment is handled a bit clumsily at times, explaining why the film can come off as being nothing more than a trite sci-fi thriller with a twist and a moral.  However, a second (and third) viewing of Signs proffers to return to a thriller but instead finds itself to be as enriching of an experience as the first viewing, if not more enriching.  The second time around, one realizes that the haziness of details and looseness of plot is the gem at the heart of this film.  Upon repeat viewing, I found myself more captivated by the story, perhaps because I was more willing to embrace the film on something of a more existential level.This overall allowance for an existential appropriation is not found in lofty dialogue or enigmatic phrases.  Instead, the film poses the short (albeit complex) question, ""Is there something greater than chance tied into the fabric of causality in space and time?""  The openness of the film prevents the viewer from appropriating a singular ""Signs-watching experience"" and instead offers a wider vista for the consideration of these issues.  Each time that a viewer returns to this little diadem, (s)he is offered a chance, once again, to consider this question anew with a new set of life experiences.Additionally, this openness (and somewhat lack of detail) has the added effect of strengthening the thrill-based portion of the film.  Since the film doesn't really work in single shocking scenes but by means of high tension, multiple viewings are not destroyed by the dismissal of the action as merely a trite repetition of previous experiences.  The viewer is returned to a state of anticipation and not one of full resolution, thereby allowing for the continuation of suspense after numerous viewings.On the whole, I highly suggest the movie.  The more cynical viewers in the world may scoff at its simple question and utilization of Science Fiction as a genre.  However, those who are willing to at least engage in the conversation of the film will find themselves generously rewarded.  As seasons pass and experiences change, we can all return to the question of ""Is life more than chance?""  Because this is perennial to all humanity and thanks to the relative ""coolness"" of the film, Signs is a movie worth viewing many times throughout the years.",4,More Fulfilling After the Passage of Time,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,3621,"['About', 'once', 'year', 'get', 'itching', 'pull', 'out', 'copy', 'Signs', 'watch', 'movie', 'always', 'approach', 'such', 'temptations', 'more', 'little', 'reservation', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'not', 'overawed', 'production', 'seemed', 'be', 'acceptable', 'thriller', 'bit', 'trite', 'destiny', 'theme', 'very', 'strong', 'cast', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'lukewarm', 'appreciation', 'had', 'film', 'always', 'have', 'reservation', 'pull', 'copy', 'Signs', 'shelf', 'afraid', 'itching', 'will', 'ultimately', 'end', 'dislike', 'movie', 'However', 'third', 'fourth', 'reviewing', 'quite', 'deal', 'growing', 'up', 'can', 'unequivocally', 'say', 'Signs', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'believe', 'now', 'have', 'experiential', 'wherewithal', 'elaborate', 'bit', 'why', 'overall', 'impression', 'film.It', 'perhaps', 'weakest', 'point', 'Signs', 'most', 'strongly', 'supported', 'perpetual', 'enjoyment', 'weakness', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'cool', 'media', 'sense', 'leaving', 'much', 'viewer', 'interpretation', 'first', 'glance', 'coolness', 'can', 'appear', 'be', 'nothing', 'other', 'laziness', 'part', 'director', 'writers', 'film', 'More', 'accomplished', 'wisps', 'shades', 'intrigue', 'direct', 'dialogue', 'open', 'environment', 'handled', 'bit', 'clumsily', 'times', 'explaining', 'why', 'film', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'trite', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'twist', 'moral', 'However', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'Signs', 'proffers', 'return', 'thriller', 'instead', 'be', 'enriching', 'experience', 'first', 'viewing', 'not', 'more', 'enriching', 'second', 'time', 'one', 'haziness', 'details', 'looseness', 'plot', 'gem', 'heart', 'film', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'found', 'more', 'captivated', 'story', 'perhaps', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'embrace', 'film', 'something', 'more', 'existential', 'level.This', 'overall', 'allowance', 'existential', 'appropriation', 'not', 'found', 'lofty', 'dialogue', 'enigmatic', 'phrases', 'Instead', 'film', 'short', 'complex', 'question', 'there', 'something', 'greater', 'chance', 'tied', 'fabric', 'causality', 'space', 'time', 'openness', 'film', 'viewer', 'appropriating', 'singular', 'Signs-watching', 'experience', 'instead', 'wider', 'vista', 'consideration', 'issues', 'time', 'viewer', 'returns', 'little', 'diadem', 's', 'offered', 'chance', 'once', 'again', 'consider', 'question', 'new', 'set', 'life', 'experiences.Additionally', 'openness', 'somewhat', 'lack', 'detail', 'added', 'effect', 'strengthening', 'thrill-based', 'portion', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'single', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'means', 'high', 'tension', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'are', 'not', 'destroyed', 'dismissal', 'action', 'merely', 'trite', 'repetition', 'previous', 'experiences', 'viewer', 'returned', 'state', 'anticipation', 'not', 'one', 'full', 'resolution', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'continuation', 'suspense', 'numerous', 'whole', 'highly', 'suggest', 'movie', 'more', 'cynical', 'viewers', 'world', 'may', 'scoff', 'simple', 'question', 'utilization', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'genre', 'However', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'least', 'engage', 'conversation', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'generously', 'rewarded', 'seasons', 'pass', 'experiences', 'change', 'can', 'return', 'question', 'Is', 'life', 'more', 'chance', 'perennial', 'humanity', 'thanks', 'relative', 'coolness', 'film', 'Signs', 'movie', 'viewing', 'many', 'times', 'years']",Signs

After sighting the crop circles in his cornfield, Graham quickly dismisses any potential threat and concludes it as a hoax, hoping to appease his disturbed children. A series of strange events including the reported sightings of UFOs on TV escalate Graham's alert about these mysterious crop circles. Rumor has it that it could be a new round of alien invasion. The movie has a slow start but quickly builds up the suspense. For a long time the suspense really has it on the audience that something horrible might creep up around the Graham's house.

Night Shyamalan originally had, he's lost. When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I'm sorry to say, it's no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense.Signs just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It's also definitely not Mel Gibson's best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating.The problem I think that Signs has, is that it's already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There's also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy.The finale doesn't really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can't break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me? But the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs, who sensed something was not right (time to get myself a dog), but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect the aliens entering our atmosphere - but a BABY MONITOR can?! Huh?!A film to stay well away from. Thankfully, I didn't spend my hard earned (ha!) money on it, but borrowed it from a friend. I shall approach M. Night Shyamalan's films with trepidation from now.

Specifically, Father Gordon Hess' (Mel Gibson) loss of faith after the accidental killing of his wife which prompts him to renounce his commitment to the church and leads to his losing his faith in mankind and in his children and brother (Joaquin Phoenix).Gordon Hess and his family wake one morning in Bucks County, PA to find patterns carved out in their cornfield. Gordon and his family think that it is the work of local teenagers and laugh it off until these ""carvings"" are discovered all around the world.What came to my mind was Erich Von Daniken's 1970's, ""Chariot of the Gods"" which proposed that aliens had made these carvings as navigational signposts: a way to guide their space ships to Earth. Shayamlan then takes on Von Daniken's mantle but adds his own interpretation and artistic vision of these ""War of the Worlds""-like events.What makes ""Signs"" so interesting and human is that the focus of the movie is Hess and his family and not the aliens per se. The aliens arriving are, Shayamalan is saying, a direct result of we humans losing our faith in God, in ourselves and in each other: we're ripe for takeover for we have faith only in money, material goods and unbridled sensual pleasure.One particularly emotional scene is one in which the Hess family is sitting down to a ""last"" dinner before, what they assume is the inevitable advance and takeover by the aliens, in which Gordon breaks down and sobs; as much for his lost faith as for his family's death: without your faith what do you have at a time like this?Mel Gibson has never been better on screen: his humor and charm by now are a given, but here he strips away several layers of lacquered ""stardom"" and produces a performance with the pathos and emotional open-ness we haven't seen since the first ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously.""""Signs,"" based on Shayamalan's other films, could have been nothing if not interesting, but to also be as thought provoking and emotionally available as it is... is a revelation.",4,A Loss of Faith,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,2066,"['M.Night', 'Shayamalan', 'Signs', 'loss', 'Faith', 'Specifically', 'Father', 'Gordon', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'loss', 'faith', 'accidental', 'killing', 'wife', 'renounce', 'commitment', 'church', 'losing', 'faith', 'mankind', 'children', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', '.Gordon', 'Hess', 'family', 'wake', 'one', 'morning', 'Bucks', 'County', 'PA', 'find', 'patterns', 'carved', 'out', 'cornfield', 'Gordon', 'family', 'think', 'work', 'local', 'teenagers', 'off', 'carvings', 'are', 'discovered', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Daniken', '1970', 'Chariot', 'Gods', 'proposed', 'aliens', 'had', 'made', 'carvings', 'navigational', 'signposts', 'way', 'guide', 'space', 'ships', 'Earth', 'Shayamlan', 'then', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'mantle', 'own', 'interpretation', 'artistic', 'vision', 'War', 'Worlds', 'events.What', 'Signs', 'interesting', 'human', 'focus', 'movie', 'Hess', 'family', 'not', 'aliens', 'se', 'aliens', 'arriving', 'are', 'Shayamalan', 'saying', 'direct', 'result', 'humans', 'losing', 'faith', 'God', 'ourselves', 'other', ""'re"", 'ripe', 'takeover', 'have', 'faith', 'only', 'money', 'material', 'goods', 'unbridled', 'sensual', 'pleasure.One', 'particularly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'one', 'Hess', 'family', 'sitting', 'down', 'last', 'dinner', 'what', 'assume', 'inevitable', 'advance', 'takeover', 'aliens', 'Gordon', 'down', 'sobs', 'much', 'lost', 'faith', 'family', 'death', 'faith', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'time', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'screen', 'humor', 'charm', 'now', 'are', 'given', 'here', 'away', 'several', 'layers', 'lacquered', 'stardom', 'performance', 'pathos', 'emotional', 'open-ness', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'Signs', 'based', 'Shayamalan', 'other', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'not', 'interesting', 'also', 'be', 'thought', 'provoking', 'emotionally', 'available', 'revelation']",Signs

595205,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,B00005JL3T,Michael Bulger,"[3, 5]","M. Night Shyamalan rocketed into the pantheon of my favorite modern directors with his first two films, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable.&quot;  His signatures are twofold:  an element of the supernatural, and a glacial pace, which serves to highlight the moments of action that do happen.  The pace in particular would have to be Shyamalan's trademark; after watching only two of his films, I imagine I could now identify another one in the absence of any other information merely by viewing a few minutes' worth.  His characters walk through his stories like zombies, nearly devoid of obvious emotional reactions, contributing to the effect.  The result is peculiarly dreamlike, further enhancing the creepiness of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and the portentousness of &quot;Unbreakable.&quot;Shyamalan's third film is a new take on the basic &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; premise--aliens invade and quickly overrun the planet, only to be beaten off by the most primitive of means (although not, in this case, due to disease).  The twist here is that Shyamalan chooses to view the proceedings almost entirely from the perspective of a family of four in their rural Pennsylvania farmhouse; the only window on the rest of the world is provided by the TV.  The family itself is made up of a father (and recently ex-Father) his two children--an asthmatic boy and a younger girl, the latter prone to prophetic dreams--and his brother, an ex-jock who has come to live with the family after the death of their mother.Shyamalan has a second twist to add, however, in that the real focus of the movie isn't the alien invasion, but a question of faith.  Or, to paraphrase Gibson's character, are you the sort of person who believes in signs and miracles, or who sees only coincidences?It's an interesting idea, and Shyamalan infuses &quot;Signs&quot; with enough style to nearly make you forget the B-movie premise beneath it.  Nearly, that is.  There is enough humor in the movie to deflect accusations that it takes the alien invasion premise too seriously, but the climactic scene is patently ludicrous.  Shyamalan has not provided a blueprint for how to make a ridiculous premise believable in a dramatic presentation.  In the end, the alien invasion gets too much in the way of the crisis of faith that is clearly the main point of the film.  No matter how much I was supposed to care for Gibson's acceptance or rejection of the &quot;signs&quot; that have been given him, I failed to see how it amounted to more than a hill of beans in relation to the vast invasion taking place in the wide world outside that farmhouse.I still want to give Shyamalan his style points, since there are a few moments of genuine eeriness before it gets too silly.

Night Shamalyan, the gifted young genius who brought us the classic &quot;Sixth Sense.&quot;  In fact, these two performances are the main reason &quot;Signs&quot; is as effective as it is.  Gibson's scenes with the man who ran down his wife (director Shamalyan in a credible yeoman role) and with his wife who is dying are stunning and gut-wrenching.  His fight with his lack of faith is also clearly delineated by the talented Gibson.  Likewise, Phoenix's role as the younger brother is touching and convincing; only wish he didn't whisper so much.  And one has to admit the scene where Gibson finds his siblings looking like Hershey's Kisses is a howler.  But overall, the script is ambiguous enough to wonder:  why did the aliens leave so suddenly; why did only one show up at Gibson's farm?  The aliens seemed easy enough to dispatch; so why such &quot;horror&quot; around the globe?

595207,AEG3I82BVE2ZK,B00005JL3T,"Michael Cornett ""Madman""","[4, 6]","...but after thinking about this movie for a while, I liked it less and less.On the surface, it's a neat idea.  An alien-invasion story given a personal twist by focussing in on a single family, with emphasis on how it affects them and their lives.  I thought the loss-of-faith angle was well explored.But on further reflection, I started realizing how superficial it all was.  A clergyman losing faith because his wife was killed?  That's a time when people usually turn to their faith, and become stronger in it (in my experience), and not just reject it wholesale.  Yes, it does happen...but for a clergyman to do it, that must indicate that his faith was very weak, and that he had no business being in a position of spiritual authority.  And, of course, his faith returns at the end...it changes with the wind, it seems!  The final scene is unlikely and silly, and could have been handled in a more realistic and thoughful manner.  Shyamalan wanted to do a movie about faith, but sadly, he was unable to look any deeper than the surface.As for the alien invasion part of the story...it's stupid.  Just plain stupid.  Alien transmissions intercepted by baby monitors?  Silly.  And the final way in which the aliens are dispatched makes NO sense whatsoever.  (I won't reveal it.)  But it's on a level of stupidity that if you think about it for more than five seconds, you'll realize that the aliens should have been unable to leave their saucers at all.  Shyamalan has talked about how he tried to do the best thriller he could.  He failed.  The sci-fi elements of the story are stupid, stupid, stupid, and Shyamalan should be ashamed of himself.On the upside, Gibson's performance was good, but not exceptional.  Joaquin Phoenix was OK, the kids were below average.  The lady cop was cool, though.  And it was tense and exciting at times.But...this is just B-movie tripe pretending to be profound and meaningful, when it's not.",2,I liked it at first...,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,1932,"['thinking', 'movie', 'while', 'liked', 'less', 'less.On', 'surface', 'neat', 'idea', 'alien-invasion', 'story', 'given', 'personal', 'twist', 'focussing', 'single', 'family', 'emphasis', 'how', 'lives', 'thought', 'loss-of-faith', 'angle', 'was', 'well', 'explored.But', 'further', 'reflection', 'started', 'realizing', 'how', 'superficial', 'was', 'clergyman', 'losing', 'faith', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'usually', 'turn', 'faith', 'become', 'stronger', 'experience', 'not', 'just', 'reject', 'wholesale', 'Yes', 'happen', 'clergyman', 'do', 'must', 'indicate', 'faith', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'position', 'spiritual', 'authority', 'course', 'faith', 'returns', 'end', 'wind', 'final', 'scene', 'unlikely', 'silly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'more', 'realistic', 'thoughful', 'manner', 'Shyamalan', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'faith', 'sadly', 'was', 'unable', 'look', 'deeper', 'surface.As', 'alien', 'invasion', 'part', 'story', 'stupid', 'Just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Alien', 'transmissions', 'intercepted', 'baby', 'monitors', 'Silly', 'final', 'way', 'aliens', 'are', 'dispatched', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'level', 'stupidity', 'think', 'more', 'five', 'seconds', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'aliens', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'leave', 'saucers', 'Shyamalan', 'talked', 'how', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'thriller', 'could', 'failed', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'himself.On', 'upside', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'OK', 'kids', 'were', 'below', 'average', 'lady', 'cop', 'was', 'cool', 'though', 'was', 'tense', 'exciting', 'times.But', 'just', 'B-movie', 'tripe', 'pretending', 'be', 'profound', 'meaningful', 'when', 'not']",Signs
595208,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JL3T,Michael Crane,"[0, 2]","(The following review is ""spoiler free."")Let it be known that chances are there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be disappointed with this movie.  Especially if they're expecting another ""Sixth Sense"" or another movie with a shocking and twisted ending.  If you want ""Sixth Sense,"" then go see ""Sixth Sense.""  If you want to see ""Signs,"" then see ""Signs.""  This was a very different movie.  I enjoyed it very much, but at the same time I thought there were things that could've been done to make the movie better.Another thing I want you to know is that I was one of the few who absolutely LOVED ""Unbreakable,"" which people thought was slow and boring.  Just want to show you that I have an open mind and I went into this film, not wanting to see another ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable,"" and I don't have a problem with a movie having more story than action.The story is simple.  Mel Gibson plays a father who has lost faith every since the tragic death of his wife.  Now, it's just him, his two kids, and his brother.  Things are happening.  Very strange things.  It all starts with crop circles.  Then, more things start to happen.  (I really don't want to go into detail, because I don't want to give anything away.)  The movie doesn't focus on how the world deals with the problem, it focuses on the FAMILY, and how they deal with it.This movie is pretty scary, for a PG-13 movie.  There are a lot of frightening moments that make you jump out of your seat, and it's done without a lot of special effects or CGI.  And the trailer does a good job of not giving too much away.The acting was really good.  Everyone did a good job.  Mel, of course, was outstanding.  The kids were also great.  I liked how it was filmed and directed.  Lots of complicated shots and close-ups, very much like in the director's last two movies.I just thought that this movie was a lot different than I expected.  Maybe I was hoping for too much.  I think the movie is really good, but it's nothing special or spectacular.  I think the critics are putting a little too much hype onto the movie.  Plus, this was one that I could not figure out if I liked it or not until a couple of hours afterwards.  Mainly, because I was with my friends when I saw this, and they weren't too impressed.  So, this is one you'll have to be by yourself afterwards and decide if you like it or not.All in all, it's a pretty good movie.  Again, don't go into this expecting another ""Sixth Sense.""  That is the wrong approach to take when seeing this movie.  I really don't want to compare movies, but if I must, it is a lot like ""Unbreakable,"" meaning that there is a lot of story and character development.  So, this is one that no one can really help you decide if you'll like it or not.  I enjoyed it, but I can't recommend it, because I know that the feedback on this movie is going to be very mixed.  You're on your own, but if you want to see a really different movie with some really scary moments and top-notch suspence, then ""Signs"" just might be the movie for you.",4,A Very Different Approach to a Movie,1028937600,"08 10, 2002",2002,3047,"['following', 'review', 'spoiler', 'free', 'Let', 'be', 'known', 'chances', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Especially', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'movie', 'shocking', 'twisted', 'ending', 'want', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'want', 'see', 'Signs', 'then', 'see', 'Signs', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'thought', 'were', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'thing', 'want', 'know', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'Unbreakable', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'boring', 'Just', 'want', 'show', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'went', 'film', 'not', 'wanting', 'see', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'having', 'more', 'story', 'action.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'father', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'tragic', 'death', 'wife', 'Now', 'just', 'two', 'kids', 'brother', 'Things', 'are', 'happening', 'Very', 'strange', 'things', 'crop', 'circles', 'Then', 'more', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'detail', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'movie', ""n't"", 'focus', 'how', 'world', 'problem', 'FAMILY', 'how', 'deal', 'it.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'scary', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'frightening', 'moments', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'done', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'trailer', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Everyone', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Mel', 'course', 'was', 'outstanding', 'kids', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'directed', 'Lots', 'complicated', 'shots', 'close-ups', 'very', 'much', 'director', 'last', 'two', 'movies.I', 'just', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'different', 'expected', 'Maybe', 'was', 'hoping', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'nothing', 'special', 'spectacular', 'think', 'critics', 'are', 'putting', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'hype', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'liked', 'not', 'couple', 'hours', 'afterwards', 'Mainly', 'was', 'friends', 'when', 'saw', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'So', 'one', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'afterwards', 'decide', 'like', 'not.All', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'wrong', 'approach', 'take', 'when', 'seeing', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'compare', 'movies', 'must', 'lot', 'Unbreakable', 'meaning', 'lot', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'So', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'help', 'decide', ""'ll"", 'like', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'know', 'feedback', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'mixed', ""'re"", 'own', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'different', 'movie', 'really', 'scary', 'moments', 'top-notch', 'suspence', 'then', 'Signs', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'movie']",Signs

It's all nicely complemented by James Newton Howard's creepy score.The performances are superb. Gibson gives a career high performance as the heartbroken (and soul-broken) minister.

595211,A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,B00005JL3T,Michael Pappalardo,"[13, 15]","In an age where action movies with over the top explosions and death-defying battles with manevolent extraterrestrials in spacecrafts the size of planets or mind-numbing shoot-outs with druglords and cyborgs are too commonplace, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is  a terrifying and welcome return to the roots of what made movies of this type so great in the past: tension and fear.A small-town Pennsylvania preacher loses faith and becomes a farmer.  One of his children develops a bizarre habit with drinking water.  His dogs start to become frighteningly agressive, as if some sort of predator were on the loose...Just remembering the scenes of this movie give me the chills...a clear indication of how well Shyamalan's film-making and direction steer this movie in the direction of utter terror.  Mel Gibson is superb in his role as a preacher turned farmer who slowly begins to realize that all is not so well in this small countryside Pennsylvania town.  When a number of bizarre occurences, and an unforgettably terrifying encounter  both outside his daughter's bedroom window (which is giving me goosebumps just thinking about it) and in his own cornfields in the middle of the night sends his family and other locals into a paranoia fit, he must contend with his own inner struggles and beleifs to help guide his family through this terror.Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the film is that it is so realistic.  The events and occurrences on the film never go beyond unbeleivable...they are all very down to earth(no pun intended) and rational.  People who fear or are generally frightened by the thought of alien invaders will be completely terrified by the film's basic yet beleivable events.  Unlike most alien invasion type films, Shyamalan opts for a seemingly forgotten key in film making: Less is MORE.Like the Ridley Scott classic Alien, Shyamalan plays more on fear and emotion rather than visual effects.  This may disappoint some, but for most people who see this movie, including myself, it helps to convey a poignant and moving story while keeping you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing and chills running down your spine.  And as with most Shyamalan movies(namely the Sixth Sense), Signs has a message to convey to the audience and has a basic principal to the entire premise.Overall, Signs stands out as one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.  It is so basically beleivable that one may lose sleep after seeing this film.

As we learn more and more about the family's background we start to understand why they seem to be so stressed out and tense around each other.  There is some humor, to keep the movie from getting too dark, but I failed to care about what was happening or about the characters themselves.Don't get me wrong - the cast did a great job.  But the problem is I am thrown into the story right when the weird things start happening and well after the characters have started to fall apart as a family.  I don't see the good times, I don't see them as a loving family, so I don't really feel the pain of what is happening till near the end when the flashbacks explain what has been going on right under my nose.  The movie started in the wrong point of the family's story.  It should have started before the accident.The extras are interesting.  A documentary on the making of the movie, Night's first alien film, deleted scenes and storyboards.  But no audio commentary which are the norm for most discs yet the lack of one seems the norm for M.Night Shyamalan's movies.  And I think a commentary really does add to a film's extras.In the end I was disappointed.  Having watched The Sixth Sense and The Village I was looking forward to a thriller, full of suspense and plot twists, but that was not to be.

595213,A2F7UCDYPS7YBA,B00005JL3T,Michelle Lee,"[0, 0]","I have been an M. Night fan ever since ""The Sixth Sense"".  The movies he creates remind me of The Twilight Zone, and his sense of plot twists and suspense is phenomenal.  Even his underappreciated ""Unbreakable"" was a mind-bending trip.  However, ""Signs"" was a little different.  Maybe there was too much buzz.  Maybe I set myself up for another great twist.  But, somehow ""Signs"" didn't exactly hit the mark.Don't get me wrong.  Mel Gibson is poignant in his role as an ex-reverend who has lost his faith after losing his wife in a freak accident.  The mandatory creepy precocious children are present as always, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a surrogate parent role as Mel Gibson's younger brother.  As aliens begin to invade the planet, Gibson and his family realize that their farm has become an epicenter for these hostile visitors.The whole movie flows well and keeps you guessing with every twist and turn.  However, the climactic ending leaves something to be desired.  It hits the mark, but not quite hard enough.  By the end, you realize that the whole movie is centered around the ideas of faith and fate.  Little facts presented throughout the movie play significant roles in the ending.  However, their significance doesn't quite ring as loudly as it should.  The movie turns into a cheezy sci-fi movie/morality tale.  I'm sure M. Night meant to reel us into the belief that things don't happen without a reason.  However, his way of relating this idea is a little convoluted and contrived.However, I must admit that this is still a great chiller.  Shyamalan's directorial style is still captivating, and his ideas are still thought-provoking.  If he had just found a bigger, more dramatic way to get his point across, this could have been a real five-star movie.",4,"Good Shyamalan, but not the best",1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,1771,"['have', 'been', 'M.', 'Night', 'fan', 'ever', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'movies', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'sense', 'plot', 'twists', 'suspense', 'phenomenal', 'Even', 'underappreciated', 'Unbreakable', 'was', 'mind-bending', 'trip', 'However', 'Signs', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'Maybe', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'buzz', 'Maybe', 'set', 'up', 'great', 'twist', 'somehow', 'Signs', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hit', 'mark.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'poignant', 'role', 'ex-reverend', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'losing', 'wife', 'freak', 'accident', 'mandatory', 'creepy', 'precocious', 'children', 'are', 'present', 'always', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'surrogate', 'parent', 'role', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'younger', 'brother', 'aliens', 'begin', 'invade', 'planet', 'Gibson', 'family', 'realize', 'farm', 'become', 'epicenter', 'hostile', 'visitors.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'well', 'guessing', 'twist', 'turn', 'However', 'climactic', 'ending', 'leaves', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'mark', 'not', 'quite', 'hard', 'enough', 'end', 'realize', 'whole', 'movie', 'centered', 'ideas', 'faith', 'fate', 'Little', 'facts', 'presented', 'movie', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'ending', 'However', 'significance', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ring', 'as', 'loudly', 'should', 'movie', 'cheezy', 'sci-fi', 'movie/morality', 'tale', ""'m"", 'sure', 'M.', 'Night', 'meant', 'reel', 'belief', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'reason', 'However', 'way', 'relating', 'idea', 'little', 'convoluted', 'contrived.However', 'must', 'admit', 'still', 'great', 'chiller', 'Shyamalan', 'directorial', 'style', 'still', 'captivating', 'ideas', 'are', 'still', 'thought-provoking', 'had', 'just', 'found', 'bigger', 'more', 'dramatic', 'way', 'get', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'five-star', 'movie']",Signs
595214,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JL3T,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 4]","The Summer of 2002 has not been a generally good time for Touchstone Pictures or Walt Disney Studios in general. Bad Company, which starred Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, and The Country Bears flopped at the box office while Reign of Fire barely recouped its moderate $60 million production budget. So it is no surprise that they are hoping that their last film of the summer finishes the season better then the previously mentioned films had started. Director M. Night Shyamalan has been described by many as the next Spielberg and for good reason. The Sixth Sense became one of the biggest surprises of 1999 when the film grossed nearly $300 million domestically on a relatively small $40 million production budget. His second film, Unbreakable, was met with less success at the box office but acquired a cult following when the film became available on DVD. Disney is obviously hoping that Signs will bring about Sixth Sense-like success or will this show the decline of rising director's prosperity?The story focuses on a man named Graham Hess, a former minister, and his family as the world faces a major conflict. Graham is the father of two children who lives on a farm just outside the city of Philadelphia along with his brother, Merrill, a former minor league baseball player. A car accident that took the life of his wife causes Graham to lose his faith and makes him question the ways of the world. One morning, he discovers a crop circle that has appeared in his corn fields. At first he dismisses the crop circle as a prank and nothing more. But soon news from around the world shows that these crop circles are appearing all over the world and in greater numbers then pranksters could ever create in a short amount of time. Soon mysterious lights begin to appear in the sky over major cities around the world. Everything that we had feared about life from other worlds is coming true and an invasion by these alien life forms appears imminent. Graham must now find the faith within himself in order to save the lives of his family. The story, which written by Shyamalan himself, is done magnificently. Humor is mixed with intense plot in well placed areas where it is needed the most. The length of the plot does not seem too long nor too short which is so rare in most movies today.The cast of Signs is very well put together. Mel Gibson, who has starred in such successful films as Braveheart, What Women Want, and Lethal Weapon, is sure to have another huge hit on his hands with Signs. Gibson does a wonderful job with the crucial role of Graham Hess. He shows a great range of emotions throughout the film and one of the best examples of this is the scene involving the last supper with his family before the aliens invade. Joaquin Phoenix, who is probably best know for his role in the Academy Award winning Gladiator, is a great surprise as Graham's brother Merrill. His character adds well needed humor in certain places within the course of the film. Some child actors in films seem too cute and can often ruin the effect of a film but the children in Signs don't do that. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are perfect in their roles and make the audience both laugh and cry. M. Night Shyamalan, who made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense, takes on the role of the man who killed Graham's wife in a car accident, which shows that his genius goes beyond directing and writing.Overall, Signs spells out another huge success for the rising director M. Night Shyamalan as well as for actor Mel Gibson. This is clearly the best film of 2002 and one the best films in recent memory. The aliens are not seen fully until the end of the feature but Shyamalan is the only director in the movie industry today that can scare the heck out of an audience with just noises. The musical score by James Newton Howard is one of the biggest highlights of the film. Howard, who scored such films as The Sixth Sense, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire, out does himself with the brilliantly exciting score from the opening credits till the conclusion of the film. There are so many wonderful things to say about this film that any negative comments seem trivial. Though the ending to Signs does seem a bit cheesy that is the effect that Shyamalan is trying to get across. Much of the film is a slight parody of the old 1950's B-movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the film does come off as a bit of tribute to those films. But Shyamalan makes the film his own and does so with excellent flare and style. Signs is sure to remain one of the best films of the year and everyone should make it their duty to see this film at least once. You never know when life from other worlds may visit.

595216,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00005JL3T,"Mike London ""MAC""","[4, 8]","With M. Night Shyamalan's third major studio release as director, he once again proved that he may just be heir to the Hitchcock throne of suspense.  Do not think I am comparing him to the level of Hitchcock as a film maker, because Shyamalan still has a long way to go to achieve that goal.  However, of the film makers today you'd be hard pressed to find a director who could produce such a suspenseful film on such minimalist methods.Hollywood's mentality has long been the bigger the explosion the bigger the return, and in an age of special effects and showing off what they can do on the computer (take note, George Lucas), Shyamalan bypassed all that and harkened back to a time when the most important thing was the story.  Shyamalan constructed the film around the history and idiosyncracies of the family using everyday things such as half-filled glasses, a baby monitor, and other like things.  When Spielberg directed Jaws, he learned that by not showing the shark that much made the film much more effective (admittedly, this realisation came to be because JAWS was such a production disastor).  In a time when we have the specials effects to envision anything you could possibly dream, this film aptly illustrates that just because you have the technology it doesn't mean you have to use it to tell a good story.  The old adage of ""less is more"" fits wonderfully here. Another wonderful example that incorporates technology without sacrificing the story or characters is Minority Report.What is so remarkable about Signs' plot?  It's the fact that the characters exist in their own right and never feel like just plot devices or mouthpieces.  Mel Gibson plays an apostate preacher who suddenly has to handle the fact that crop circles are appearing in his corn field.  Simultaneously, all across the globe crop circles are, shall we say, cropping up.  His children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix from Gladiator) begin believing in the aliens, and try as he might Gibson's character realizes that these crop circles won't just go away.  The movie then moves to the question is are these alien formations, and if so what are they used for?  If there are aliens, are they hostile or not?  What do they want with Earth?Because Shyamalan always mades sure the Gibson's character and his family are in the forefront, the viewer becomes involved with them as individual characters to the point where the aliens are more events anything else.  More and more scripts have characters taking backseat to the special effects and this is sapping the film industry of vitality.  In Signs, when Morgan (the son)  has his asthma attack during an assault on the house, we are much more concerned with what effect it would have on the family if they lost him, instead of it being some cheap and lowbrow ploy that is more of a plot device than a character study (Panic Room anyone?).One of the key themes in Signs is faith.  This film deals with the anger that Gibson's character feels toward God and how he must work through that throughout life's circumstances.  Shyamalan's character (yes, he acts) is responsible for Gibson losing his faith.  The film traces Gibson's progression of losing his faith and then struggling with God over losing his wife.  This is illustrated ingeniously in the film's climax.While my faith in God hasn't left me, my faith in Hollywood has long since evaporated.  With directors such as Shyamalan still on the go-around, I find it getting a little stronger everyday.",4,Hollywood goes back to minimalism for outstanding results!,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3527,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'third', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'director', 'once', 'again', 'proved', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'heir', 'Hitchcock', 'throne', 'suspense', 'Do', 'not', 'think', 'am', 'comparing', 'level', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'maker', 'Shyamalan', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'achieve', 'goal', 'However', 'film', 'makers', 'today', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'produce', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'such', 'minimalist', 'methods.Hollywood', 'mentality', 'long', 'been', 'bigger', 'explosion', 'bigger', 'return', 'age', 'special', 'effects', 'showing', 'off', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'computer', 'take', 'note', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Shyamalan', 'bypassed', 'harkened', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'was', 'story', 'Shyamalan', 'constructed', 'film', 'history', 'idiosyncracies', 'family', 'using', 'everyday', 'things', 'such', 'half-filled', 'glasses', 'baby', 'monitor', 'other', 'like', 'things', 'When', 'Spielberg', 'directed', 'Jaws', 'learned', 'not', 'showing', 'shark', 'much', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'admittedly', 'realisation', 'came', 'be', 'JAWS', 'was', 'such', 'production', 'disastor', 'time', 'when', 'have', 'specials', 'effects', 'envision', 'anything', 'could', 'possibly', 'dream', 'film', 'aptly', 'just', 'have', 'technology', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'use', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'old', 'adage', 'less', 'more', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'wonderful', 'example', 'technology', 'sacrificing', 'story', 'characters', 'Minority', 'Report.What', 'so', 'remarkable', 'Signs', 'plot', 'fact', 'characters', 'exist', 'own', 'right', 'never', 'feel', 'just', 'plot', 'devices', 'mouthpieces', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'apostate', 'preacher', 'who', 'suddenly', 'handle', 'fact', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'appearing', 'corn', 'field', 'Simultaneously', 'globe', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'shall', 'say', 'cropping', 'up', 'children', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Gladiator', 'begin', 'believing', 'aliens', 'try', 'might', 'Gibson', 'character', 'crop', 'circles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'away', 'movie', 'then', 'question', 'are', 'alien', 'formations', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'aliens', 'are', 'hostile', 'not', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'Earth', 'Shyamalan', 'always', 'sure', 'Gibson', 'character', 'family', 'are', 'forefront', 'viewer', 'involved', 'individual', 'characters', 'point', 'where', 'aliens', 'are', 'more', 'events', 'anything', 'else', 'More', 'more', 'scripts', 'have', 'characters', 'taking', 'backseat', 'special', 'effects', 'sapping', 'film', 'industry', 'vitality', 'Signs', 'when', 'Morgan', 'son', 'asthma', 'attack', 'assault', 'house', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'concerned', 'what', 'effect', 'would', 'have', 'family', 'lost', 'instead', 'being', 'cheap', 'lowbrow', 'ploy', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'character', 'study', 'Panic', 'Room', 'anyone', '.One', 'key', 'themes', 'Signs', 'faith', 'film', 'anger', 'Gibson', 'character', 'feels', 'God', 'how', 'must', 'work', 'life', 'circumstances', 'Shyamalan', 'character', 'yes', 'responsible', 'Gibson', 'losing', 'faith', 'film', 'Gibson', 'progression', 'losing', 'faith', 'then', 'struggling', 'God', 'losing', 'wife', 'illustrated', 'ingeniously', 'film', 'climax.While', 'faith', 'God', ""n't"", 'left', 'faith', 'Hollywood', 'long', 'evaporated', 'directors', 'such', 'Shyamalan', 'still', 'go-around', 'find', 'getting', 'little', 'stronger', 'everyday']",Signs

As the possibility of alien invasion grows, television, radio, and an oddly prescient science book are the family's sources of abundant information.  The science book offers Shyamalan an opportunity for one of his patented clunky lines of dialogue:  ""If the aliens invade, it means that everything ever written in science books will be wrong.""  Of secondary concern, presumably, is the distinct possibility that they'll want to eat your face.  No matter.  As the story moves along, the global concerns slowly become a MacGuffin, and the local and familial concerns become supreme.  The film's focus narrows around Gibson and family and their struggles to comprehend and to survive.  It is an effective technique,The film wastes little time in establishing its mood, and its influences.  The credit sequence -- a bold grey background over which is laid a four-story tall font -- is punctuated by a score that will only *not* remind you of Bernard Herrmann's ""Psycho"" score if you've been deaf from birth.  Couple this with Shyamalan's trademark cameo appearance, in a role that carries much of the film's exposition, and you get a good idea who he's trying to ape here.  His detractors, eager to label him as a wannabe-Hitchcock, will have a field day gathering evidence to support their claims here.  But Shyamalan mines a more spiritual side, for better or for worse, in his contemplative films.Shyamalan is unable to shoot a bad-looking movie, helped no doubt by ace ""Silence of the Lambs"" lensman Tak Fujimoto.  His shot composition skills are near-perfect, must notably in the few scenes he arranges so that the camera peers through the farmhouse's window.  The effect this has is that the front lawn appears as if it is underwater.  A telling image, given where this film is going.  And in the film's key moments of fright, genuine enough that I and the people around me in the theatre leaped out of our seats at the exact same time, he tastefully shows only what he has to, leaving any big revelations for later.Gibson plays priest-turned-farmer Graham Hess, torpedoed into a faithless funk by the death of his wife, who is still charged with being the gatekeeper of the town's morality even though he tells those who still insist on calling him 'Father' to stop.  Whenever Gibson put on his priest's collar, in the mishandled flashback sequences, I had a tough time believing him.  But when wearing his average Joe jeans and t-shirts his quiet earnestness worked.  Burdened by a script that tries to make every spoken line of dialogue weighty enough to crush most mortal men, Gibson does a fine job of lifting with his legs and keeping everything on his shoulders.  After the movie was about an hour old, and this is the best compliment I can think of, I forgot that I was watching Mel Gibson ""act"", and believed in the character he was trying to portray.  Not a prodigious performance, but fine enough by Mel's low standards.Joaquin Phoenix, looking burlier than I've ever seen him, provides much of the film's comic relief.  Whenever the film threatens to get bogged down under its weightier and scarier moments, Joaquin shows up to deliver a Merrill Hess moment, which may include a pragmatic take on just who (""nerds... guys in their thirties who can't get girlfriends"") is making the crop circles, or a sympathetic -- and cute -- moment involving three Hershey's Kisses-shaped hats.  Despite the fact that nearly twenty years separates their ages, Joaquin and Mel are credible brothers, Mel's burdensome perfection offering a yin to Joaquin's ballplayer manque yang.Abigail Breslin, as young Bo Hess, serves much the same purpose as Phoenix, i.e. deflating the suspense for a moment.  Except where Phoenix provided comic relief, Breslin provides what can only be called cute relief.  She's an adorable little sprite, with one gear: straight-faced charm.  But it's a gear that you can't help giggling at whenever the little tyke is on screen.  At one particularly suspenseful point Gibson tells her the story of her birth.  All the women in the room squealed when she emerged from the womb, simultaneously exclaiming that she was the cutest baby they'd ever seen.  It's a touching moment, given credibility only because Breslin is the kind of cute little girl that would elicit such a reaction.Rory Culkin, so good as the innocent young son in ""You Can Count Me"", nearly crumbles under the weight of his character's precociousness.  Culkin does little more than stare pointedly at the adults around him, as if he is their peer.  It's a testament to this little man's skill as an actor that his Morgan Hess doesn't crumble under the weight Shyamalan shovels on him.The denouement doesn't reveal just one secret, like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable""; it reveals many.  But with less effect.  If one had been paying attention all along, to repeated motifs and curious bits of exposition, the ending can be easily anticipated.  But it's not about the secrets that are revealed; it's about the realization that these secrets prompt from the characters.  The audience is never given a grand epiphany; they must empathize with the characters for the ""gimmick"" ending to work.  I think this kind of ""gimmick"" storytelling has run its course, though.  If Shyamalan doesn't trust that his stories are intrinsically interesting, so much so that he must throw in a twist ending as bait for audiences, than he'll burn out pretty quickly as a filmmaker.  He's got strong skills, and when he learns to trust them throughout, he'll finally make great movies.",4,"""Sign"" Of The Apocalypse: I Enjoy A Shyamalan/Gibson Film",1028505600,"08 5,

595218,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JL3T,Miles D. Moore,"[1, 1]","With ""Signs,"" M. Night Shyamalan proves once again that he's one of America's most accomplished commercial filmmakers. While ""Signs"" lacks the perfect sheen and momentum of ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is also less diffuse and more moving than ""Unbreakable."" In telling the story of a disillusioned minister and his family threatened by alien invasion, Shyamalan borrows here and there--a pinch of Spielberg, a dash of Hitchcock, a hint of George Romero--but melds the film into something unmistakably his own. There are moments here as terrifying as any in cinematic history, all the more so because they leave the worst to the audience's imagination. The dictum ""Less is more"" applies to horror movies as much as anything, and Shyamalan understands that better than anybody. Above all, Shyamalan understands the overriding importance of spirituality in human lives--that the religious sense is, indeed, an essential part of our humanity, perhaps THE essential part. It is the spiritual theme in ""Signs"" that lifts it above the usual run of horror flicks, and also makes the wordless final scene one of the most satisfying in recent memory. Shyamalan of course is also an excellent director of actors; Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones and the two child actors give quiet yet deeply moving performances. It's too bad, then, that Shyamalan couldn't finesse the plot holes better--isn't it convenient, for example, that Gibson's son finds a book that tells the family everything it needs to know about the aliens? The worst aspect of ""Signs,"" however, is James Newton Howard's thudding score, which telegraphs the point of every scene and seriously undermines the film's impact.

I like the premise of the story: the crop signs and the creepy happenings at the farm, the mystery surrounding Mel Gibson's character losing his faith in God, and the death of his wife.But while the setup was great, the actual unfolding of the story left me underwhelmed.  There were just too many blunders in the plot to overlook.  For instance, why wouldn't Gibson's character report what he found behind the cupboard door?  Why wouldn't that have been on the TV news?  Did he just leave that house and not tell anyone?  That makes no sense at all.And like another said, what was the aliens' purpose in being there?  This was not explained properly.  Also, it was said in the story that they had higher intelligence and wouldn't need big muscles, but yet they attacked with superhuman speed and strength.I give this film three stars because I was marginally entertained and the tension at the beginning of the film was gripping.

595221,A1OXUVBFZAAQAQ,B00005JL3T,minguy,"[12, 18]","""Unbreakable"" was an ultra-serious comic book movie that may have been too morose for most. As a comic book fan, I fell in love with it (and the director's filmmaking style). ""Signs"" is an edge-of-your-seat drama that may have been too farfetched or ""preachy"" for some. It's the most fun I've had in years! Admittedly, M. Night Shyamalan's directing skills far surpass his storytelling skills, but the young writer/director again proves with his latest blockbuster that he is a filmmaker to be contended with.First let me say there were two things that surprised me about this film:1) There is NO SURPRISE TWIST. There is, admittedly, a REVELATION of sorts, but it's not nearly in the same capacity as his last two films. So don't set yourself up for disappointment and miss a well-made film despite (or because of) the lack of a huge twist.2) There is a lot more humor than I expected. Almost to the point of being distracting. ALMOST. ""Signs"" is essentially a family drama and the dynamics between the characters are extremely amusing.Despite the humor, the tension is almost unbearable at times. I don't recall being this nervous since ""Silence of the Lambs."" It's truly amazing how Shyamalan shifts between the two poles of comic relief and terror with such precision and effectiveness.A word of warning, like all of his other films, ""Signs"" walks a very fine line between surrealism and silliness. Depending on what you expected and what kind of mood you were in, you'll end up loving the film or despising it. There is no middle ground, because Shyamalan leaves no such choice at the end of the film. I've come to realize that you need a particular mindset when you enter a Shyamalan movie: namely, forget what you think you know about what you're going to watch. It's probably not true. Expectations and assumptions are key.Shyamalan's direction has been panned by some critics as being ""pretentious."" I can't disagree more. ""Unbreakable"" may have been pretentious, but ""Signs"" is subtle and understated. The camera never brings attention to itself because story and character require the complete attention of the audience. His writing is excellent, though there are several elements that can be considered ""plot holes."" Dialogue is a little silly but highly effective and, excluding a few anti-mind-reading tin-foil hats, it is the sole reason for the film's humor. Needless to say, Shyamalan's story development is in perfect sync with his visual storytelling.The music is SUPERB. It is one of the most effective scores I've ever heard. And the sound effects are extremely creepy. The resulting mood that is set with the music and sound is highly reminiscent of Bill Paxton's ""Frailty."" But while Paxton's inexperience is evident in his debut film, Shyamalan shows himself to be on top of his game.As for the acting, it is very good overall. Note that there are basically only 4 characters who make up the whole picture. Mel Gibson takes on most of the acting burden, and, as an actor who doesn't have the greatest range, he is his usual star self. Not his best work but good enough. The two child actors are charming and well-cast, but a bit too heavy-handed in their precociousness. In fact, they play their characters with such weirdness that I was expecting one or both of them to be revealed as aliens. Thankfully, such is not the case, cause that would've been way too creepy. Finally we have Joaquin Phoenix who totally steals the movie. Gibson's dry wit scores some chuckles and the kids have their occasional funny lines but Phoenix bats a thousand in all his scenes (sorry, couldn't help myself). He was born to play this part. One of the best scenes he has is the ""I'm a miracle man"" story.As much as I like it, there are four reasons why I'm not giving this film a perfect grade:1) With all the excitement and tension that is built up in the last 20-30 minutes, the climax does not completely satisfy. ""Swing away Merrill"" was a nice touch, though.2) The aspect of the ending dealing with Gibson's faith was appropriate, but it was too pat and simple and abrupt. It needed a little more development.3) This opening and closing title sequences are extremely ugly and unnecessarily HUGE. I can live with them since they're homages to Hitchcock but I will never like them.4) SPOILER: For a being who is super fast and fairly strong, the alien in the final scene did nothing to fight back.

The atmosph...ere was great. The score I thought was very eerie and fit the tone perfectly. The acting was fine from most of the cast. There are a lot of problems story wise. Plus the twist at the end is quite lame.Mel Gibson, back before he went looney, does fine here. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as well. I grew to like both characters throughout the film. The little girl I found annoying though. Rory Culkin, I felt was a bit wooden acting-wise. However, I found them both to be tolerable.The quality that this movie has most going for it is the atmosphere. The atmosphere is great and really draws you in, which is helped by the score. The design of the alien I did not mind either. If you are expecting a big alien invasion film like War of the Worlds look elsewhere. This film is mostly about this family and how they coup and deal with the situation of the alien attack.The problems with the film come from the aliens themselves. The aliens seem to be very primitive for an advanced alien race that is supposedly more advanced than we are. The alien's weakness that is revealed at the end also raises a lot of questions.Overall despite its problems I definitely recommend that you see this film at least once.

His Sixth Sense scared people everywhere, and revived in the process Bruce Willis's career with gusto, while Breakaway was a very intelligent and underrated thriller with a twist. I, therefore, very much looked forward to Signs, for fresh, original, and well written and directed films are few and far between these days, and any new output by directors like Shyamalan are a valuable addition to the art of cinema.Well, Signs did deliver the goods on many levels.Firstly it is a very well directed film, where the pace and tension starts from the first minutes and escalates steadily until almost the end.Secondly, the writing is superb, and I very much liked the emotional and humane element of a family trying to cope with the loss of a mother, and the father(an ex priest,played flawlessly by Mel Gibson)trying to cope with the loss of his faith as a result. This is powerful writing.The alien invasion of earth is done very smartly, the development of which is mostly seen through the eyes of this family, trapped in their farmhouse. Not since Spielberg's Close Encounter of a Third Kind, did a film handle an alien invasion/contact so brilliantly.Yet,why do I give the film only three marks??I was disappointed with few elemets of the film, and if you have not seen it yet, ps dont read on, as I do not wish to spoil any surprises for you.The last scene when we get to see the alien holding the boy,(played very well by yet another Culkin, this time it is Rory)spoiled the tension and atmosphere of the film for me.I would have very much prefered if the image and shape of these  aliens remained firmly in the viewer's imagination, since throughout the whole film we only see shadows,or fews seconds glimpses or hear footsteps which hightens the suspense.Moreover, the fact that the aliens in Signs are so smart they can read people's thoughts, yet they are afraid of water, the only element that can destroy them, which made me think 'Hmmm, they are not so smart after all, travelling galaxies to choose the one planet that is 70% water!!!So while I enjoyed Signs very much, and there are few memorable and powerful scenes, it is a pity that it has these very few flaws that prevents me from giving it a classic status, one that a talented filmmaker like Shyamalan deserves.",3,Scary Encounter of the Third Kind,1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,2359,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'very', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'doubt', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'scared', 'people', 'everywhere', 'revived', 'process', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'career', 'gusto', 'Breakaway', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'underrated', 'thriller', 'twist', 'therefore', 'very', 'much', 'looked', 'forward', 'Signs', 'fresh', 'original', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'films', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'days', 'new', 'output', 'directors', 'Shyamalan', 'are', 'valuable', 'addition', 'art', 'cinema.Well', 'Signs', 'did', 'deliver', 'goods', 'many', 'levels.Firstly', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'where', 'pace', 'tension', 'starts', 'first', 'minutes', 'escalates', 'steadily', 'almost', 'end.Secondly', 'writing', 'superb', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'emotional', 'humane', 'element', 'family', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss', 'mother', 'father', 'ex', 'priest', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss', 'faith', 'result', 'powerful', 'writing.The', 'alien', 'invasion', 'earth', 'done', 'very', 'smartly', 'development', 'mostly', 'seen', 'eyes', 'family', 'trapped', 'farmhouse', 'Not', 'Spielberg', 'Close', 'Encounter', 'Third', 'Kind', 'did', 'film', 'handle', 'alien', 'invasion/contact', 'so', 'brilliantly.Yet', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'three', 'marks', 'was', 'disappointed', 'few', 'elemets', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'ps', 'dont', 'read', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'spoil', 'surprises', 'you.The', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'alien', 'holding', 'boy', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'yet', 'Culkin', 'time', 'Rory', 'spoiled', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'me.I', 'would', 'have', 'very', 'much', 'prefered', 'image', 'shape', 'aliens', 'remained', 'firmly', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'whole', 'film', 'only', 'see', 'shadows', 'fews', 'seconds', 'glimpses', 'hear', 'footsteps', 'suspense.Moreover', 'fact', 'aliens', 'Signs', 'are', 'so', 'smart', 'can', 'read', 'people', 'thoughts', 'yet', 'are', 'afraid', 'water', 'only', 'element', 'can', 'destroy', 'made', 'think', ""'Hmmm"", 'are', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'travelling', 'galaxies', 'choose', 'one', 'planet', '70', '%', 'water', 'So', 'enjoyed', 'Signs', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'pity', 'very', 'few', 'flaws', 'prevents', 'giving', 'classic', 'status', 'one', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'Shyamalan']",Signs

595230,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JL3T,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 2]","A few years ago M. Night Shyamalan proved himself as a major player with his sleeper hit `The Sixth Sense', following it up with the critically appraised yet less accessible `Unbreakable' later on.  Now he tackles aliens, along with the issue of how September 11th has affected us all.  The set-up has Gibson as a bereaved priest who has lost his faith after his wife died in a car accident a year ago, now living with his brother Joaquin Phoenix and two children.  When crop circles start appearing he assumes it's a hoax, yet as disturbing facts come to light we swiftly realised that this is the work of sinister alien life forms and that an invasion signalling the end of life as we know it is at hand.Obviously this won't be to everyone's taste.  Alien movies are a hard thing to get right - should it be part parody or should it be taken literally?  For the most part Shyamalan chooses the latter, and thankfully so as the few attempts at humour often fall flat, especially with a script that at least in the beginning is clunky at best.  But that isn't really what anyone goes to see a Shyamalan (or more often than not any horror flick) for, but to be chilled, freaked out and to see how he'll tackle a difficult subject.  This is done very well, especially through inspired use of photography that makes it appear as if it is taken by some secret voyeur; indeed, the sense that some ominous force (God? Aliens?  Who knows?) is watching is palpable throughout.  Whether the camera is sweeping through fields of corn or studying a darkened room there always seems to be a feel that something is just off screen ready to pounce.  There are also some inspired turns, with Gibson underplaying effectively and supported more than ably by the young actors that play his children, both of whom are superb.  In fact, it's only really in Phoenix that there is any problem, and it certainly has nothing to do with his acting but more with the fact that a clearly talented actor has been, to an extent, wasted in a strangely stereotypical role.All in all though Shyamalan goes for the route of human horror rather than blood and guts, with more and more focus being leant to a family in crisis as the impending invasion looms.  One scene in particular, where Gibson tries to force his family into having a happy last meal together and they all end up in tears.  As he showed in `The Sixth Sense', an unseen horror is a much greater one and this is neatly balanced by the mixture of feelings the family has to a threat from the skies, in an obvious yet sensitively played metaphor for terrorism.  If, when the aliens finally do appear, they are a little disappointing, this appears to be more of a budget problem than anything else and the ending is pulled off very well indeed.  Whilst it may not be quite as excitingly different as `The Sixth Sense', it certainly is an excellent follow-up.",4,"Creepy, accessible and better than I'd expected",1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,2888,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'proved', 'major', 'player', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'following', 'up', 'critically', 'appraised', 'yet', 'less', 'accessible', 'Unbreakable', 'later', 'Now', 'aliens', 'issue', 'how', 'September', '11th', 'affected', 'set-up', 'Gibson', 'bereaved', 'priest', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'wife', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'year', 'ago', 'now', 'living', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'two', 'children', 'When', 'crop', 'circles', 'start', 'appearing', 'hoax', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'come', 'light', 'swiftly', 'realised', 'work', 'sinister', 'alien', 'life', 'forms', 'invasion', 'signalling', 'end', 'life', 'know', 'hand.Obviously', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Alien', 'movies', 'are', 'hard', 'thing', 'get', 'right', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'parody', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'literally', 'most', 'part', 'Shyamalan', 'latter', 'thankfully', 'so', 'few', 'attempts', 'humour', 'often', 'fall', 'flat', 'especially', 'script', 'least', 'beginning', 'clunky', 'best', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'anyone', 'see', 'Shyamalan', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'horror', 'flick', 'be', 'chilled', 'freaked', 'out', 'see', 'how', ""'ll"", 'tackle', 'difficult', 'subject', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'inspired', 'use', 'photography', 'appear', 'taken', 'secret', 'voyeur', 'indeed', 'sense', 'ominous', 'force', 'God', 'Aliens', 'Who', 'watching', 'palpable', 'camera', 'sweeping', 'fields', 'corn', 'studying', 'darkened', 'room', 'always', 'be', 'feel', 'something', 'just', 'off', 'screen', 'ready', 'pounce', 'are', 'also', 'inspired', 'turns', 'Gibson', 'underplaying', 'effectively', 'supported', 'more', 'ably', 'young', 'actors', 'play', 'children', 'whom', 'are', 'superb', 'fact', 'only', 'really', 'Phoenix', 'problem', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'do', 'acting', 'more', 'fact', 'clearly', 'talented', 'actor', 'been', 'extent', 'wasted', 'strangely', 'stereotypical', 'role.All', 'Shyamalan', 'route', 'human', 'horror', 'rather', 'blood', 'guts', 'more', 'more', 'focus', 'being', 'leant', 'family', 'crisis', 'impending', 'invasion', 'looms', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Gibson', 'force', 'family', 'having', 'happy', 'last', 'meal', 'together', 'end', 'up', 'tears', 'showed', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'unseen', 'horror', 'much', 'greater', 'one', 'neatly', 'balanced', 'mixture', 'feelings', 'family', 'threat', 'skies', 'obvious', 'yet', 'sensitively', 'played', 'metaphor', 'terrorism', 'when', 'aliens', 'finally', 'do', 'appear', 'are', 'little', 'disappointing', 'be', 'more', 'budget', 'problem', 'anything', 'else', 'ending', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'excitingly', 'different', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'follow-up']",Signs

595232,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JL3T,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 2]","In the latest movie from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense & Unbreakable), former man of the cloth Graham Hess discovers an elaborate 500 foot crop circle in his field of corn. As more of these circles appear across the planet, opinion in his family (two young children and a younger brother) is divided as to whether these circles are part of an elaborate hoax or signs of an alien invasion. As the story unfolds, so does a voyage of self-discovery in this slow-build movie.Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a lapsed Episcopalian minister, who locals still unselfconsciously address as ""Father"", despite the fact he abandoned his faith following the death of his wife in a horrific car accident six months earlier. He lives on a picturesque farm in idyllic Bucks County outside Philadelphia with his two young children and his somewhat delinquent, former minor league baseball star, younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix), who has apparently moved in to provide a shoulder for his grieving older brother to cry on. In trademark Shyamalan style the children, played by Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, have a major part to play in the telling of this story. Younger sister Bo is the wide-eyed innocent of the two, whereas older brother Morgan is the preternaturally wise child with an instinctive spiritual connection to matters not of this world.Signs, is a very worthy movie about faith and the meaning of life. Ultimately, the message is that everything, no matter how unpleasant, happens for a reason. We are all part of a bigger plan, nothing occurs by chance and that as long as we remember to read the signs (on our journey through life) and do not lose faith, everything will work out okay in the end. As such it is an uplifting story but if the old adage that a good story lies in its telling still holds true, then it must be pointed out that Signs has some serious flaws.While it becomes clear at the end of the movie that the aliens in this movie are merely a device through which to deliver the, everything happens for a reason, do not lose faith message, it has to be said that there appearance counts for many of the flaws and plot holes in the movie. For example, surely if a race had the technology to travel millions of miles through space, they might have the technology to have developed some sort of protective armour, or even a wet suit, and have some half-decent weapons to use against mankind? Surely also the locals might have contemplated kitting themselves out with some shotguns, if not a spare AK 47 or two? I mean, what farmer doesn't at least own a shotgun? Yet this movie is devoid of any weapons at all, with the exception of a kitchen knife and a baseball bat. It is also unclear as to whether or not our Mel was a farmer (as well as a clergyman) before his wife was killed because he certainly doesn't appear to do much work.On the plus side, however, Signs is an amiable and thought provoking enough movie. The suspense is built up with some skill, although a little slowly for my liking, with some good edge of the seat tension and the odd genuine scare.  Signs is also genuinely and deliberately amusing at times, with assured direction from it's very talented young director, who has obviously learnt a lot from watching the likes of Spielberg and Hitchcock. Shyamalan also proves once again what a great director of actors he is, as all the acting is both subtle and faultless, with the only exception being from Shyamalan, who totally mis-cast himself as Ray Reddy, the local vet responsible for the death of Gibson's wife.Signs is an enjoyable enough if somewhat uneven yarn but it's certainly not the great movie that some people would have you believe. It's possibly the weakest of M.Night Shyamalan's last three outings and it will take a large suspension of disbelief not to conclude at the end of the movie that those aliens sure were rubbish.",3,"GOOD STORY, BIG PLOT HOLES",1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,3895,"['latest', 'movie', 'writer-director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'former', 'man', 'cloth', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'elaborate', '500', 'foot', 'crop', 'circle', 'field', 'corn', 'more', 'circles', 'appear', 'planet', 'opinion', 'family', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'younger', 'brother', 'divided', 'circles', 'are', 'part', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'signs', 'alien', 'invasion', 'story', 'unfolds', 'so', 'voyage', 'self-discovery', 'slow-build', 'movie.Mel', 'Gibson', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'lapsed', 'Episcopalian', 'minister', 'who', 'still', 'unselfconsciously', 'address', 'Father', 'fact', 'abandoned', 'faith', 'following', 'death', 'wife', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'six', 'months', 'earlier', 'picturesque', 'farm', 'idyllic', 'Bucks', 'County', 'Philadelphia', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'somewhat', 'delinquent', 'former', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'star', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'apparently', 'moved', 'provide', 'shoulder', 'grieving', 'older', 'brother', 'cry', 'trademark', 'Shyamalan', 'style', 'children', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'have', 'major', 'part', 'play', 'telling', 'story', 'Younger', 'sister', 'Bo', 'wide-eyed', 'innocent', 'two', 'whereas', 'older', 'brother', 'Morgan', 'preternaturally', 'wise', 'child', 'instinctive', 'spiritual', 'connection', 'matters', 'not', 'world.Signs', 'very', 'worthy', 'movie', 'faith', 'meaning', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'message', 'everything', 'matter', 'how', 'unpleasant', 'reason', 'are', 'part', 'bigger', 'plan', 'nothing', 'occurs', 'chance', 'as', 'long', 'remember', 'read', 'signs', 'journey', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'lose', 'faith', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'okay', 'end', 'such', 'uplifting', 'story', 'old', 'adage', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'still', 'true', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Signs', 'serious', 'flaws.While', 'clear', 'end', 'movie', 'aliens', 'movie', 'are', 'merely', 'device', 'deliver', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'lose', 'faith', 'message', 'be', 'said', 'appearance', 'counts', 'many', 'flaws', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'example', 'surely', 'race', 'had', 'technology', 'travel', 'millions', 'miles', 'space', 'might', 'have', 'technology', 'have', 'developed', 'sort', 'protective', 'armour', 'even', 'wet', 'suit', 'have', 'half-decent', 'weapons', 'use', 'mankind', 'Surely', 'also', 'locals', 'might', 'have', 'contemplated', 'kitting', 'out', 'shotguns', 'not', 'spare', 'AK', '47', 'two', 'mean', 'what', 'farmer', ""n't"", 'least', 'own', 'shotgun', 'movie', 'devoid', 'weapons', 'exception', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'baseball', 'bat', 'also', 'unclear', 'not', 'Mel', 'was', 'farmer', 'as', 'well', 'clergyman', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'appear', 'do', 'much', 'work.On', 'plus', 'side', 'however', 'Signs', 'amiable', 'thought', 'provoking', 'enough', 'movie', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'skill', 'little', 'slowly', 'liking', 'good', 'edge', 'seat', 'tension', 'odd', 'genuine', 'scare', 'Signs', 'also', 'genuinely', 'deliberately', 'amusing', 'times', 'assured', 'direction', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'director', 'who', 'obviously', 'learnt', 'lot', 'watching', 'likes', 'Spielberg', 'Hitchcock', 'Shyamalan', 'also', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'great', 'director', 'actors', 'acting', 'subtle', 'faultless', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'totally', 'mis-cast', 'Ray', 'Reddy', 'local', 'vet', 'responsible', 'death', 'Gibson', 'wife.Signs', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'yarn', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'possibly', 'weakest', 'M.Night', 'Shyamalan', 'last', 'three', 'outings', 'will', 'take', 'large', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'not', 'conclude', 'end', 'movie', 'aliens', 'sure', 'were', 'rubbish']",Signs

For the life of me, I cannot believe this movie has gotten even one positive review. On second thought, I guess I can believe it, considering the level of brain activity left in most human beings as a species. I was keenly interested in the content of this film when it first came out, being as that I have been researching the phenomenon of Crop Circles that have been appearing in southern England and in all parts of the globe since at least 1978. This is a genuine mystery that has been ridiculed and touted as a hoax by those who are either dim witted or those who wish to promote dim wittedness. But the facts are there for anyone who has the will and the desire to find things out for oneself...one website of note would be cropcircleconnector.com, take a look at some of the ""signs"" there and try to convince yourself that these were created only by idjits in a field with wooden boards or by spooky alien geeks.Instead of giving us a film that explored the mysteries of crop circles, MidNight Scamalon gives us a familiar fright night tale of Bad Old Aliens. Puhlease. Whatever, Stooge. Mel Gibson looking scared and pathetic, boo hoo, I'll never pray again, lame kids screaming. Hasn't this movie been made thousands of times already? Hollywood has been making the same movie over and over and over again, and chumps still buying it!And what's worse, it's not even scary, or thrilling. It is however, sad. Sad in that so much potential was wasted here. The chance to present a genuine mystery to a large audience and let them question something that would open them to even larger questions. Clearly, this movie was never intended to make you think....it was only created to make you afraid. And it is also sad but true that if you are afraid, you will not think clearly, making it easier for you to be held in a prison of fear.

The director obviously has a talent for conveying suspense through subtle image - a trait which made the Sixth Sense so enjoyable. Like the Sixth Sense the first half of this film builds plenty of atmosphere through a perceived threat that we are only shown glimpses of. The films main themes of loss of faith and greater meaning are channelled through Mel Gibson's character, a pastor whose wife has died.In an almost patronising way Gibson is made to eat his 'cynical' words as the events that unfold around him suggest life experiences have a greater universal meaning & connection than his jaded belief that everything is random & unrelated suggests.The main problem with this film is the events that occur are hard to swallow. The aliens that are apparanly intent on taking over planet earth aren't able to bust down a bolted door, nor can they withstand an attack with a baseball bat - you would expect a species colonising other planets to be slightly more resilient than that. On top of this the aliens are featured far too prominently towards the end of the film, they look ridiculous and further undermine the weakening plot.This film tries to do too much and ends up being neither interesting philosophical pontification nor scary movie.",2,Ultimately unrewarding,1032739200,"09 23, 2002",2002,1393,"['Firstly', 'are', 'reasons', 'like', 'film', 'most', 'relate', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'stylisation', 'Hitchcock', 'early', 'Spielberg', 'director', 'obviously', 'talent', 'conveying', 'suspense', 'subtle', 'image', 'trait', 'made', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'plenty', 'atmosphere', 'perceived', 'threat', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'glimpses', 'films', 'main', 'themes', 'loss', 'faith', 'greater', 'meaning', 'are', 'channelled', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'pastor', 'wife', 'died.In', 'almost', 'patronising', 'way', 'Gibson', 'made', 'eat', ""'cynical"", 'words', 'events', 'unfold', 'suggest', 'life', 'experiences', 'have', 'greater', 'universal', 'meaning', 'connection', 'jaded', 'belief', 'everything', 'random', 'unrelated', 'suggests.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'events', 'occur', 'are', 'hard', 'swallow', 'aliens', 'are', 'apparanly', 'intent', 'taking', 'over', 'planet', 'earth', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'bust', 'down', 'bolted', 'door', 'can', 'withstand', 'attack', 'baseball', 'bat', 'would', 'expect', 'species', 'colonising', 'other', 'planets', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'resilient', 'top', 'aliens', 'are', 'featured', 'far', 'too', 'prominently', 'end', 'film', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'further', 'undermine', 'weakening', 'plot.This', 'film', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'up', 'being', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'pontification', 'scary', 'movie']",Signs

Joacquin Phoenix is particularly impressive as the young man who is fed up with his brother's refusal to accept what has happened and get on with life.I'm afraid the deeper meaning of it all is simply escaping me.

When I first walked into the theater to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything more than a cheesy B movie. It more than exceeded my expectations. Mel Gibson plays his role to perfection, playing a former clergyman who abandoned his faith when his wife was killed by a drunk driver because he doubted God's purpose for pain in a person's life. Then hostile aliens invade Earth, and Gibson's character, Gordon Hess and his family are caught up in a struggle to survive the alien invasion, and Hess returns to his former way of thinking, and believes in God again, having learned a valuable lesson in faith during the course of his struggle to survive the alien invasion. He realizes that it was miraculous that his family lived through the attack, and realizes further that God helped them through it.The best aspect of this film is the character development.

It was shocking to read the reviews (are people really so stupid that they missed the point of the film).  The aliens and crop circles were a unique medium for delivering a much deeper message.  The real point of Signs rested in a question of faith and coinsedence.  Does everything happed for a reason?-- the little girl who never finishes her water, the death of the ministers wife, the baseball bat, and the little boy's asthma-- all of these awkward happenings were essential for the final outcome of the film.

Mel Gibson plays a pastor who has lost his faith due to the violent death of his wife.  Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother; an washed up minor league baseball player who lives with Gibson and his two children.  As soon as the movie opens the family finds a rather large crop circle design in their farm field (which is in Bucks County, Pennsylvania which is a little under an hour from where I live), and later on they're dog behaves rather violently.  This phenomina starts to happen all over the world, and our answer of whether or not we are alone in the universe is finally answered.  Gibson and Phoenix are good in their respective roles, as are the children, and the movie is fantasticly shot.  Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to direct with a lot of suspense, and it all pays off big, not to mention there are some parts of the film that are really funny and you'll find yourself laughing out loud right before you jump in suspense.  The ending however I thought was a letdown.  The same old story of keeping faith in God was a turn off for me, not to mention if your not quick enough to sort every detail through by the time the credits start rolling you'll be left behind in the dust and wonder ""what the..."".

I do admit that it could have been even better than it was... btu it was still a really good movie.It think that a lot of people didn't like it because it was portrayed in the trailers to be a horror/thriller about crop circles and aliens... and really, that was the background story. So, I think that the Blair Witch lovers out there were a little disappointed that it wasn't what it was made out to be in commercials.The movie is about a widowed-ex-priest and father of two(Mel Gibson)who is having a hard time coming to grips with the death of his wife. His brother moves in the farm-house with him to help him with the housework and the kids.Out of nowhere, these perfectly detailed crop circles start popping up in the middle of their corn fields - and when they turn on the news they find out that they're not alone! They are popping up all over the world! And when it is revealed that aliens are behind the crop-circles and that they are planning on taking over earth, panic breaks loose all over the world as people search for a way to fight them off.But, as I stated above, the aliens and crop circles aren't the main focus of the movie. The movie has a much deeper plot - trying to drive home the fact that EVERYTHING in life - no matter how insignificant it might seem at the time - happens for a reason. Like the daughter who drives her father crazy with the bad habit of leaving half-full glasses of water ALL over the house, his son having asthma, his wife's last words, his brother-in-law being an ex-baseball rookie... it was all for a reason - to help them fight off the aliens in the end.I think that it was a really good ending.

Mel Gibson seems bent on tackling Michael Caine's ""I'll do any movie"" approach toward film roles, and while he is quite believable, one misses the edge he used to bring to roles. Phoenix is excellent, and really the best thing about this film. The corn fields in Doylestown are beautiful.

I was not disappointed. This is a great SciFi film that captures what a small farm family goes thru when they discover a large crop circle in their corn field on the eve of an alien invasion. The tension mounts as the alien presence intensifies. But there is a 2nd story here too. It is about hope and faith. The farmer is an ex-priest who has lost his wife and consequently, his faith. But during the alien scare he regains his faith as a result of events related to the aliens and his family. Make no mistake, there are very different colors of thread interwoven in this story, and the result is a powerful movie. You won't be disappointed unless you expect War of the Worlds or Independence Day. This is NOT that type of movie.

The premise is simple, and schlock-ish enough: Mysterious corn circles appear all over the world, explicable by none but the proverbial crazed Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly of NASA, whose best shot is that a greater intelligence from another world is here to say a big hello to planet earth. Maybe to make friends. Maybe to invade. Maybe to take humans for food. They're clever than us, so who knows?So far, so ID4. The cinematic hat-tipping doesn't stop there, though: Independence Day begets Close Encounters of the Third Kind, begets ET, begets Invasion of the Body Snatchers, begets (creepily and effectively) The Birds.But all this thriller/Sci Fi schtick is a ruse: the film actually ruminates on a few topics more cerebral than that, and to a large extent the thriller element just gets in the way.For example: it doesn't become clear till fairly late in the piece what is causing the crop circles. Up to that point, Mel Gibson and family spend considerable energy chasing rustling corn cobs around their back yard. Despite how it sounds, this is eerie, and makes a point (of which something has been made in the press notices on this film) about the new American Sense Of Unease. In the same way that Invasion of the Body Snatchers commented on the McCarthyist programme in the 1950s, there is good mileage to be made in the observation that, without much prompting, fully grown men will cack their pants when the wind blows on the plants over their back fence. But the force of that point evaporates the moment a rubbery green man pops out of the foliage and legs it, Benny Hill style, past the back porch and down the lane.The ""Signs"", it turns out, aren't really the crop circles at all, and this is the other major bone I have to pick with this film. This is a simple matter of preference, and I don't mark the film down on it at all, but simply mention for the record that I think it's bogus: The film has, from the very start, a pretty obvious metaphysical/religious angle (Gibson plays an ex-priest who has lost the faith) and, while it's finally addressed late in the film, the issue continually dangles throughout, hovering just so as you know it's there, only you don't know which side of the fence the film will come down on. It's like watching a golfer take a really long birdie putt. Well, and without giving the game away, it's firmly struck, the ball rolls true, and ... in the last yard it breaks violently the wrong way and careers down a very fast green and into a bunker.Bogey.

Most people are literally programmed for a film to last 90 minutes for everything to be explained up front for it to neatly wrap itself up and for all to be well at the end.  Unfortunately really good films are not simple, like the audience for bad films.  I really liked this movie not because of the building tension but because you weren't quite sure WHAT was going on.  I didn't walk into the movie knowing if anyone would live or die or if their were kids playing on the roof, spirits come back from the dead or aliens dropping from outer space.  The art to anything dramatic is the suspension of disbelief, of not knowing what's going to happen.  That doesn't mean that the pay off will be enormous, simply unexpected.There is a concept of synchronicity in the world, the concept that what you know is known and reverberates through the universe around you.  That what makes no sense today, glasses and glasses of water everywhere, may be your salvation tomorrow.  This film and M. Night Shyamalan take advantage of that and use it to stupendous results.

What Night is doing here is to show us that he has an interest in the horror sci-fi classics and would like to see these resurrected for the 21st century viewer. That is not a bad idea at all and Signs could also be played out by reducing your screen to black/white by adjusting the television nobs. When you do that you can see exactly where Night is coming from. This is one big homage movie with some experimental areas thrown in for good measure.The problem with this movie is that the marketing campaign and its theme is totally out of touch with what this film is about. Forget about the poster too. That is a crock. What you have here is essentially ""Night of the Living Dead"" crossed with ""It Came From Outer Space"". If anything the later half of this film is a straight forward nod to George A. Romero with one or two little tiny-weenie twists to keep us all happy.Mostly this film is about a looming apocalypse of extraterrestrial proportions. Our main protagonist (Gibson) plays an ex-vicar who has lost all faith in God because of a family accident. His son is a real nerd with asthma, his daughter has a water neurosis and his brother, an ex-baseball player, who lives with the family, seems to have a personality problem. When something starts making patterns in their fields (crop circles) Gibson tries to keep his family calm while the world goes into a dark phase because the aliens are coming. The movie is mostly psychological and is played out very well with a number of real seat jerkers to boot. You will never look at your pantry the same way again.The film does have some minuses though. It is slow and often stalls. We also learn that M. Night Shyamalan can not act, however in this movie he does show us that he has.. gasp... A SENSE OF HUMOUR!, which has been lacking in his other production. This film is very funny at times, in fact laugh out loud so.In short this is a homage movie to all the sci-fi and horror classics. Movies buffs will love it to pieces, but those expecting Night to throw our world upside with another out of the blue plot twist will be sorely, deeply, disappointed. Just stay on track with the homage theme and you will do much better and enjoy it all the more for it. The marketing people for this movie should have their pay checks revoked. They killed this guys winning streak, but this is a great movie all the same and worth watching more than once.**As a note I am not a fanboy who wants to give everything this guy does 5 stars. I did not like his 6th sense all that much to be honest, but this one is not bad.. not bad at all especially if you are a movie buff who has some general knowledge about this genre.**",5,The  Homage of M.

595265,A35TN5YGURE6IV,B00005JL3T,"""oxzo""","[2, 5]","I just went and saw this flick this afternoon and I must say I really liked it and it works on more than one level.  The storyline is well known from the trailers, promotions, and the Amazon review: a resurgence of crop circles after years of respite along with strange occurrences and sightings leave the viewer wondering just what happened and what is to come.  One thing I will say is that this is not one of those Alien types of monsters jumping out of people's chests with blood all over shows.  The movie relies on suspense and a sci-fi plot to keep the viewer engaged and it will most likely engage you in the first few minutes provided you are awake, at least relatively sober, and paying attention.I'm not going to go into the storyline other than to say it does jump out at you at unexpected times and from places you might not see it coming from.  While it is subdued at times it keeps coming at you with no slow paced build up like you see in some films and the low key parts merely make you jump more when something happens.The movie also touches on subject matter in a way that some literature does as well and I'm reasonably certain it is no accident given some of the directors other films.  You have the element of an unknown force that may or may not be threatening and the question arises do you have faith in something beyond and bigger than yourself?  Do you believe in luck or is there no such thing?  When you watch the movie you can follow the plot line which is a solid sci-fi story on it's own really but I would recommend that you also read between the lines.  Sometimes movies can be a vehicle to express or comment on deeper social issues of the day.  Keep in mind the mood of the U.S. at the time this came out and the months and years preceding it and the fact that strangers are now so ominous given the murders and kidnapping that are going on.  There is also the shadowy enemy the United States faces that for the first time is expressly targeting American citizens who are innocent and average citizens just like the character portrayed by Mel Gibson and his family.  There is a long tradition of ""otherness"" like this in American movies and the apocalyptic nature of this movie makes it pretty interesting.  This movie does have apocalyptic and end time overtones for those who are interested in such matters.I'm not really a huge Mel Gibson fan although I do think he is a fine actor who has been in some fine pictures.  I did really like his performance here and I think he really made the father of the family believable.  Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin all create likeable characters as well and I personally especially like little Abigail she did very well.It's interesting that Amazon editorial characterizes this as a ""B"" movie and is so critical of it in general when it is obviously a ""hit"" and everyone I know who has seen it says it is a ""must see"" movie.  I guess no one bats 1.000 and I think their review missed the point on this one (an exception they are usually reasonably good in my opinion).

595266,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B00005JL3T,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","A movie I had been wanting to see based on outstanding comments from fellow horror aficiandos, I was left dissapointed and half way empty. Not a bad movie by itself, it didn't rub me the right way for several reasons, and I thought it had the potential to be more than it was.A good part are the aliens when actually shown. Ultra creepy, realistic. The buildup around their appearance is top-notch; the flashes around their forms at the right moments in the right lighting with the right music or tension ws CREEPY! Especially the scene involving Graham and the pantry. The cornfield scene is quite suspenseful and there is enough of unanswered quetions that leave us sitting with a sort of morbid curiosity.There was a large subplot of religion and the loss of faith. Graham was an ex minister who bagn losing his way after the tragic and heartening death of his wife. The movie features several philosophical discussions concerning Christianity and the ending brings it all to a head.Unlike alien invasion movies like Independence day this one shows the encounter through only the eyes of this one family. It doesnt really show, besides brief news cast, how others are affected or coping. This is an interesting technique in that its more personalized, more documentary-like.The cast was convincing. Mel Gibson, known for his intense screen image, gives us Graham Hess. His brother is played by Joaquin Phoenix and is a likeable character, if not THE most likeable. The two children are Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). The children aren't annoying, which means they're good.This is a slower paced very quiet tone movie that is sort of like The Others in the theme. Besides some frightening scenarios I grew bored with a lot of it. I am all for slower films and serious drama like scenarios but this one was a bit too damp for me. I know half of the world seems to disagree and that I am in the majority. Strange as I usually dont find films boring that others do.There was some dry serious humor, some of it really was cute. So overall not a bad flick just not as good as I was expecting.

595269,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00005JL3T,Patrick A. Hayden,"[0, 0]","In his third major release, M. Night Shyamalan comes close to brilliance, but loses it in the end.  He is a filmmaker who takes risks, generally, but he does not take a big one at the end.  This is unfortunate, but in no way ruins the movie.  It just makes it less than the masterpiece that was ""The Sixth Sense"" and not as intriguing as the criminally underrated ""Unbreakable"".While some see this film as religious hogwash, it is my opinion that they are missing the larger point.  Yes, it's about Aliens coming to Earth, but the aliens here are not the point of the story.  The point is about faith, family, and how the two interplay.  Seeing the ending as a calling card for religion is short-sighted and foolish.  It is a calling card to have faith in something, anything, be it God, yourself, or your family.  Shyamalan believes that faith is important.  This does not hurt his movie.On the complaints about the aliens, they are meerly a plot device, a Hitchcokian ""McGuffin"", who only serve to help tell the larger tale.  They are stupid aliens, yes, but their intelligence is not the point.  Their presence is the important factor.Shyamalan is obviously a skillful director when it comes to staging creepy, tense scenes, but he does remarkable work with actors.  As he did with Bruce Willis in ""Unbreakable"", Shyamalan pulls a subdued performance out of the usually larger than life Mel Gibson.  He also uses Joaquin Phoenix effectively, and get great work out of his supporting cast, including the local sherrif, and a memorable scene with an Army recruiter.  One note though:  Shyamalan should stop playing roles in his movies.  Yes, Hitch did it too, but he never gave himself a key role.  Shyamalan should stick to wordless cameos.Another aspect of this film is the remarkable performaces by the two kids who play Gibson's son and daughter.  Shyamalan has shown in his previous films that he can do brilliant work with children.  Here, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are pitch-perfect as the slightly scarred offspring of a tragically killed mother and a spiritually angry father.  The scene at the dinner table before the aliens come is sad yet moving, and Shyamalan gets the best out of his cast.In the end, it is a B-movie with a message, and many different people will take the movie to be more or less than it is.  For me, it goes right next to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" on my DVD shelf.

595276,A348P63LKEES3Z,B00005JL3T,Paul S. White,"[3, 6]","This is the third of M. Night Shyamalan's suspense films and unfortunately shows a continued erosion in quality from the films that preceded it.  The Sixth Sense was Shyamalan's breakout movie and for good reason.  It was suspenseful and engaging with a twist at the end that no one saw coming and that made the viewer realize they were watching a very different film than they first thought.  Unbreakable was also an excellent movie, but the twist at the end proved more of a disappointment than a revelation.Signs again proves that Shyamalan is a master at setting up a suspenseful situation and engaging the audience in the story.  However, in this movie, he builds up to a climax that never comes.  First, multiple crop circles begin to appear throughout the world.  Then alien ships begin to appear over several major cities, and very quickly it becomes apparent that their intentions are sinister.  However, this is not a movie about alien invasions.  It focuses on farmer (and former minister) Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and how he and his family deal with the alien arrival.  There is a twist of sorts at the end, but not like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  Perhaps Shyamalan realized that he could not rely on this gimmick indefinitely and decided to try something new.  But the build up of suspense that he so carefully crafts through the movie ends with a whimper.  Ultimately, it is more a movie about Graham's struggles with his own faith than alien invaders.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the movie does cop out on resolving the alien conflict.It does not help that Mel Gibson acts like he is in a fog for the first two thirds of the movie, either.  Shyamalan employed a similar technique with Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable but was more successful with it in those movies.  And it made more sense in the context of those films.

Anyone who gets as much hype as he has gets a healthy dose of skepticism from me. However, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and now &quot;Signs&quot; have won me over.The mood and atmosphere of this movie are remarkable. By portraying world-shaking events from the perspective of a single, damaged-yet-strong family, Shyamalan personalizes the story for us and gives us a unique view. By not showing us very much of the invaders, he manages to scare our pants off when he does.More to that point - the first glimpse of the visitors is one of the most startling things I've ever seen and was the point where both the movie and the director earned my admiration. What a great bit of film-making!Both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix demonstrate that they are fine actors. They are both entirely believable in their roles, which are a big departure for both of them. The supporting cast is good, if unremarkable. The director makes a brief appearance. He does a fine job of acting the part, but physically seems out of place in small-town America. Perhaps that's a bit un-PC, but it sorta jumped off the screen at me.All in all, &quot;Signs&quot; is a lot of fun.

From the heavy handed, film school level screenplay, the very bad CGI (which I won't go into detail about to avoid spoilers) and the, at times, bad acting by Mel Gibson, this film had me fidgeting in my seat almost from the get-go.I loved ""The Sixth Sense"" and considered it one of the best films of 1999. I was less enamored of ""Unbreakable"", though it had its admirable qualities. I just didn't buy the basic premise which, therefore, ruined the entire film for me. But here, Shyamalan has a hit a wall. There are so many glaringly amateurish moments in this film that I am amazed the studio allowed it to be released in this form.If it weren't for Joaquin Phoenix and the kids, this would have been a total disaster. Phoenix has matured greatly as an actor and he's the only character I cared about in this film. The kids were cute and precocious, but that's it.If you feel you must see this film, see a matinee or wait for the DVD.

595281,AYQ2BWAU0DOBD,B00005JL3T,"P. M. Bradshaw ""P.M. Bradshaw""","[3, 6]","M. Night Shyamalan broke out with his first film, The Sixth Sense, a movie that may very well prove to be both his best and most popular. There are worse fates that creating a cultural touchstone in film your first time out. He followed this with what some thought of as the disappointing Unbreakable. In that line of thought, I must agree that his movie about comic book superheroes looked anything but super. But most of that can be attributed to the cinematographer. In its defense, part of the point was to have the film look mundane. It was about a person who discovers that he's a superhero. It's only a surprise to him if his life looks plain and ordinary, like everyone else's.SIGNS cinematography is much better, more in line with Shyamalan's first film, but in all other ways, plot, pacing, characters, it's a weaker film.Many reviewers have complained about the emotionless nature of M. Night's characters, and he fairs no better here. There are no characters in this film, just caricatures. There is ""the brainy kid"" who is also ""the kid who won't forgive one parent for the other parent's death."" Not that the child's a bad actor, but he's a Culkin. And let's face it, all the little Culkin Clones make you think about beating the crap out of Joe Pesci on Christmas Eve, not their character.Then there's ""the cute kid' who is also ""the kinda creepy kid."" Unfortunately, Kinda Creepy Kid was already done, and much better, by Haley Joel Osment, in Shyamalan's own The Sixth Sense.Next, we have Gladiator's ever-creepy Juaquim Phoenix, not as Mel Gibson's son, but as his brother. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is distracting. I'm sure there's at least 20 years difference in age between Gibson and Phoenix, and on screen it looks more like 30. Brothers? The theater-of-reality is blown in the first scene.Phoenix's character is an ex-minor league baseball player, for no apparent reason except that it's a convenient plot device when it comes time to beat the bad guy in the last reel. He doesn't play baseball anymore, despite the fact that he holds the minor league record for the longest hit, at 507 feet. With an arm like that, why isn't he playing ball in the big leagues, much less not playing at all? The only reason given is that he also holds the record for the most strike-outs. Sounds like a man who played in the majors in Cleveland for a decade, called Jim Thome. Someone should have told M. Night that the top 8 hitters in major league baseball all had more than 100 strike-outs each their last two seasons each. And that even back when Babe Ruth was the home run leader, he was also the holder of the record for the most strike-outs. So it just doesn't add up.And don't forget the town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead. The only problem with her is that we just had a town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead, in The Mothman Prophecies. And Laura Linney actually had the opportunity to add a little thing called DEPTH to the character. The actress here is just another cardboard cut-out, that ultimately could've been cut completely from the film without anyone noticing.But the award for cardboard cut-out character and winner of the prestigious Kevin Costner Wooden Indian Actor Award goes to Mel Gibson. For the first time in film, the man is emotionless, joyless, and humorless. He plays a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. One problem with this is that we saw this character ALSO, just a few years ago when we watched Harvey Keitel play a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Again, with the unfortunate result that the THEFT of this tired, Stock Character was also A bad choice, as that even in that ""We-Know-We're-Making-a-B Movie"" film (From Dusk Till Dawn), Keitel was much much better.We never believe that Mel Gibson has lost his faith. We don't believe it when his faith is restored (like we don't see that coming), and I don't believe he's a reverend in the first place. At all. Ever. Instead, he walks through the film like the ghost of an actor who used to be allowed to act, or in lieu of that, to at least play the part of Mel Gibson, Superstar. There's nothing to care about in this character, nothing to root for, and nothing heroic. Welcome to the City of Dullsville, Population: Mel.And let's not forget plot points that make no sense. 'You've locked what you think might be an alien in the pantry.' Do you A) Peek inside to see if you're right; B) Call a neighbor or friend to check with you; C) Go get a weapon, then check; or D) Call in the police ? Why, it's none of the above. It's obviously E) Just go home and forget about it.While the cinematography and music are both good, gone is the sense of doom around the corner. There are no plot twists, or what-ifs. What starts off as ""What if crop circles were made by aliens"" ends with ""crop circles were made by aliens."" Mel's faith is restored, but for no real reason, nor does he seem glad that it is.Not a BAD movie, Signs is still the lesser brother of Unbreakable, as Unbreakable was to the Sixth Sense.* * * * * * *

Who knows what compelled him to apparently draw upon ""Contact"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Birds"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""The Wizard Of Oz"", and whatever else and hand us a very pretentious movie. He even finds a part for himself in the plot - he's the person who fell asleep at the wheel and ended the life of Mrs. Hess and temporarily ended the religious career of Mr. Hess - Mel Gibson. (At least his idol Mr. Hitchcock got himself out of the proceedings after his ""cameo"").Mel and Joaqhim are the two bemused male leads. Don't think ""Men are back"" in the movies - they are both lost figures, one abandoning his faith after a tragedy, one a shoulda-been ballplayer. Gibson's children basically run the household with help from a local Policewoman.Gibson's faith is tested a second time when crop circles, I mean really big ones hoaxters couldn't do, show up in front of his country home. His suspicions are validated when he encounters an alien on the other side of the pantry door in the home of the guy who ran down Mrs. Hess. This creature was able defy universal laws of physics by traveling galaxies to Earth and by creating the circles - It was nice of him to let Earthlings know he was coming to destroy their planet - but he can't seem to find his way out of the broom closet.After the attack has begun and Hess, his Brother, his Son and Daughter, board themselves up at home to cower and wish away the aliens. Hess' son is aesthmatic and has an attack. His inhaler is in the other room - where an alien is. Gibson's character in this scene shows no ""Lethal Weapon"" tendencies. He curls and with his son on the floor. Eventually, his Brother grabs his Louisville Slugger and pummels the creature (who resembles a hybrid of the Jolly Green Giant and Alien). But it's H20 which does it in. Yes, this creature who can fly through space and scan his destination for spots to make a crop circle apparently missed that this place is 75% of what destroys him. A few bottles of water tip over...and he's gone just like the Wicked Witch from you know what movie. In the end, though, they all lived happily ever after. Hess bounces out the door with renewed vigor and interest in his work. (The fact that half the Earth is wiped out doesn't seem to affect him). The DVD offers production sidelights including an interview with the Director. He seems to be saying that the message of the movie is that order comes from chaos and that we should contemplate Universal harmony even as discord prevails. It's food for thought, but I assume that many others agree with me that despite the effective suspense, and the chance to see Mel Gibson do something different, it's wrong to take the audience for granted - Science Fiction has to have grounding in *reality*.

595285,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JL3T,"""qmlhcb""","[0, 1]","""Signs"" is the most refreshing film this summer. Finally, a movie without the fast-pace editing from MTV and without the in-your-face ""lets spell it out for the audience"" methods of storytelling that plague so much of Hollywood today. Those kind of movies have their place, and can be enjoyable, but movies which take their time like ""Signs"" are rare today. Shyamalan uses the camera to scare us more by not showing everything. You can hear the horrible things happening, but are forced to imagine them, rather then see them. What you imagine is always worse then the truth, and this movie hits a home run in its suspense. Borrowing from ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" Shyamalan creates a homage to these classics by bending them into a completly new tale. His choice to focus on a single family during a global crises brings home what such an event would be like for you and me. If you like your horror and suspense spoon fed to you and need to see blood, guts and everything that happens, stick to Friday the 13th and Freddy Krueger.

Though my comments here thus far have nothing to do with this film, I do have to comment that it seems like so many athiests seem to have a real chip on their shoulders now days. In fact though the religious messages are clear in this film, it sounds like our athiest here is bothered by the fact that Mel Gibson's character didn't stay an athiest by the end of the film. It wasn't enough that he had been a priest then turned into an athiest and stayed that way through nearly the entire film, this guy is upset that he chose to go back toward God at the end. Oh how sad :P I dont know what is with these athiests and their preaching their No God sermons, but its begining to wear me pretty thin. Yes I believe in God, but I don't feel the need to rant about it every time I review a movie. And I will never understand why these people fight so hard to believe in absolutely nothing. We live, we die, that's it. Seems like it takes more faith to believe there is no God than to believe there is one. Go figure. But I wish they wouldn't parade their anti-religious beliefs while reviewing a movie. It's extremely annoying. :( Now that I have said what needs to be said, I did find this film pretty interesting. This is not Spielberg territory here, but the film is filled with some great creepy moments, excellent direction, great acting, and some good thrills along the way. I really quite enjoyed it.

595287,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00005JL3T,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[1, 1]","I saw ""Signs"" three days after it released and I must say it was certainly a very interesting and suspenseful movie. I have to disagree with many people trying to compare Shyamalan to Spielberg; I mean, hello! just because a movie has a different intriguing storyline doesn't mean that people should think that the director is like a Spielberg wannabe, because everyone has their own unique way of making movies, so there shouldn't be any comparisons unless the storyline is 100% exactly similar between the two movies. Anyway, I wouldn't say that the storyline is a completly original one because there have been other movies like this..but the way M.Night Shyamalan has portrayed the storyline with the increasing depth and the relationship between the characters is excellent, and because of that, it is a must watch! True, it is not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", it is much much better than the unbearable ""Unbreakable"".The story is about Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lost his faith in God ever since his wife passed away. He lives with his two children, played by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, and his brother Merrill Hess (played by Joaquin Phoenix). One day, they discover large crop signs in their farm and notice that there were made similar crop signs in various fields in different countries and starts to wonder what's behind them. The story then deals around how Graham and his family come closer and closer to finding out what's behind the ""Signs"" and what they really mean and what's about to happen, and during this time, how their relationship towards one another expands.Mel Gibson has acted excellently in the movie and so have the children. A good thing about M.Night Shyamalan is that he always chooses great child actors for all his movies, which is really interesting. Joaquin Phoenix also acted good as the funny guy in the movie, which game the movie it's moments.All in all, if you would like to be entertained and have a liking for mystery/suspense movies, then this is a definite seeing for you.",5,Another excellent movie by Mr. Night Shyamalan!!,1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,2034,"['saw', 'Signs', 'three', 'days', 'released', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'certainly', 'very', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'have', 'disagree', 'many', 'people', 'trying', 'compare', 'Shyamalan', 'Spielberg', 'mean', 'hello', 'just', 'movie', 'different', 'intriguing', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'mean', 'people', 'should', 'think', 'director', 'Spielberg', 'wannabe', 'everyone', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'making', 'movies', 'there', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'comparisons', 'storyline', '100', '%', 'exactly', 'similar', 'two', 'movies', 'Anyway', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'storyline', 'completly', 'original', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'movies', 'this..but', 'way', 'M.Night', 'Shyamalan', 'portrayed', 'storyline', 'increasing', 'depth', 'relationship', 'characters', 'excellent', 'must', 'watch', 'True', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'unbearable', 'Unbreakable', '.The', 'story', 'Father', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'God', 'ever', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'two', 'children', 'played', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Hess', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'One', 'day', 'discover', 'large', 'crop', 'signs', 'farm', 'notice', 'were', 'made', 'similar', 'crop', 'signs', 'various', 'fields', 'different', 'countries', 'wonder', 'what', 'story', 'then', 'how', 'Graham', 'family', 'come', 'closer', 'closer', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'Signs', 'what', 'really', 'mean', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'time', 'how', 'relationship', 'one', 'expands.Mel', 'Gibson', 'acted', 'excellently', 'movie', 'so', 'have', 'children', 'good', 'thing', 'M.Night', 'Shyamalan', 'always', 'great', 'child', 'actors', 'movies', 'really', 'interesting', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'also', 'acted', 'good', 'funny', 'guy', 'movie', 'game', 'movie', 'moments.All', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'entertained', 'have', 'liking', 'mystery/suspense', 'movies', 'then', 'definite', 'seeing']",Signs
595288,A3HBMWR6BF4IGM,B00005JL3T,Randy Donahue,"[3, 5]","Let me start by saying, I love this film. It is a sci-fi masterpiece, a throwback to the classic sci-fi flicks of the 50s. Now, before you watch this movie, please keep that in mind. It has more in common with a movie like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" than it does with ""Independance Day"" or ""Alien.""The tension builds and fills the film like a massive lead weight that sits right on your heart as it thuds in your chest. You won't see lots of shooting, blood and gore. You will see a masterpiece of film-making unfold before your eyes.The problem with this movie, or perhaps rather the other reviewers of this movie who put it down, is that it does not fit in with modern sci-fi expectations. There's not lots of CG effects, blood, aliens being blown to bits and lasers beams flying everywhere. It's not a story line hung loosely around a collection of mayhem, death and destruction in a sci-fi enviroment.No, the problem is this movie is smart. It approaches fear in a way that is subtle, not in your face. It's not the junk food that movie audiences have been fed over the last few decades. It wants you to think more of it's characters than of the war. To me, this movie is more about the family it revolves around than the actual invasion. The alien invasion just serves as a backdrop for the story of a man's faith in God.I especially like the duality of the title. ""Signs"" refers both to the crop circles left by the alien invaders, and the signs from God that Mel Gibson talks over in a great piece of dialogue with co-star Joaquin Phoenix. Both of these stars are first rate in this film.As for the aliens, they seem to draw much criticism as well. I think M. Night wanted them to be an enigma. He accomplished that very well. Why did they act the way they did? I don't know. They were aliens! Hollywood has been spoon feeding us so much junk in sci-fi trappings, we've forgotten how to consume a REAL sci-fi movie.In closing, I am giving this DVD five stars. I would give it 4.5 if possible. The movie is a five star affair, but I was disappointed in the extras. No trailers, and the behind the scenes parts were a bit dry. The deleted scenes were good however. If you want a true, tense, sci-fi movie and a character driven story, buy this! If you want lots of explosions and blood, you came to the wrong place, but check it out anyway, you might be surprised how much you like it.",5,Classic Sci-Fi From A Modern Film,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2395,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'film', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'throwback', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', '50s', 'Now', 'watch', 'movie', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'more', 'common', 'movie', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'Independance', 'Day', 'Alien', 'tension', 'builds', 'film', 'massive', 'lead', 'weight', 'right', 'heart', 'chest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'lots', 'shooting', 'blood', 'gore', 'will', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'film-making', 'unfold', 'eyes.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'rather', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'who', 'put', 'down', 'not', 'fit', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'expectations', 'not', 'lots', 'CG', 'effects', 'blood', 'being', 'blown', 'bits', 'lasers', 'beams', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'not', 'story', 'line', 'hung', 'loosely', 'collection', 'mayhem', 'death', 'destruction', 'sci-fi', 'enviroment.No', 'problem', 'movie', 'smart', 'fear', 'way', 'subtle', 'not', 'face', 'not', 'junk', 'food', 'movie', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'fed', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'think', 'more', 'characters', 'war', 'movie', 'more', 'family', 'around', 'actual', 'invasion', 'alien', 'invasion', 'just', 'backdrop', 'story', 'man', 'faith', 'God.I', 'especially', 'duality', 'title', 'Signs', 'crop', 'circles', 'left', 'alien', 'invaders', 'signs', 'God', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'talks', 'great', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'co-star', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'stars', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'film.As', 'aliens', 'seem', 'draw', 'much', 'criticism', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'M.', 'Night', 'wanted', 'be', 'enigma', 'accomplished', 'very', 'well', 'Why', 'did', 'act', 'way', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'aliens', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'spoon', 'feeding', 'so', 'much', 'junk', 'sci-fi', 'trappings', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'consume', 'REAL', 'sci-fi', 'movie.In', 'closing', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'give', '4.5', 'possible', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'affair', 'was', 'disappointed', 'extras', 'trailers', 'scenes', 'parts', 'were', 'bit', 'dry', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'however', 'want', 'true', 'tense', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'buy', 'want', 'lots', 'explosions', 'blood', 'came', 'wrong', 'place', 'check', 'out', 'anyway', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much']",Signs

That film is guilty a thousand times over of assuming its audience is a group of dumbarses who believe every single bit of detail a movie tells them. Oh and let's not forget Shamalama's previous fiasco, The Village, which may be even worse for that. Except at least I liked the atmosphere of The Village.The irony here is that both of the mentioned movies are directed by the same person who directed Signs. Okay, let's also take the time to observe the pattern- each movie got worse as it got along. What am I saying: This movie is logically the best one of that horror trilogy but that doesn't say much.Here we have a family whose daddy was a preacher. Apparently he left the priesthood after his wife died yet he is still referred to as father. Bo, the girl, has a water problem, thd young brother has a problem with asthma, and the other brother... OK not sure since he isn't well developed. OK so looking past the priest problem, we have a strong start. They find a series of crop circles containing navigation signs, meaning there are aliens attacking them. Cool eh? Not when we find out some information about the aliens.Before the big spoiler (Actually please do read this review before you see the movie because I'm about to save you time and/or money), let me explain a huge flaw: So they have a fancy UFO. And they walk around naked (I'll explain why that's a flaw after the jump). And they use crop circles as navigation signs. And they have a poison that sprays out of their wrists (that somehow only affects Bo...??????). And they make trilling noises. And they can run at breakneck speed (so can the middle child, despite having asthma).But they can't break through wooden doors???? SERIOUSLY??? These strong aliens are apparently so evil but they can't break through doors????? They're strong enough to form giant crop circles in the cornfield but not strong enough to break through a freaking wooden door???Well, here's the spoiler: They are affected by water.Yeah, that's right. Water is their weakness.How is that a problem?-Now, the nudity problem.

595293,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JL3T,Reviewer,"[3, 8]","In his most pensive and thought-provoking film yet, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan examines personal faith and explores the possibilities of predestination, in ""Signs,"" a riveting drama/thriller that also makes a case for the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe; a film that questions the validity of coincidence, and puts forth the proposition that there is more going on in the vast expanses that surround our world than meets the eye.  It's Shyamalan's way of saying ""We are not alone,"" and he does it by whispering it in your ear rather than shouting to get your attention.  And get your attention he does, without question-- in a way that is spellbinding and unforgettable.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, awakens one morning and discovers a design, beginning with a huge circle, that has been inexplicably imprinted in the cornfield that surrounds his farm.  And he soon finds out that this is not an isolated incident; indeed, overnight the same thing has happened in fields around the world.  The burning question, of course, is who did it?  And moreover, how-- and why?  It's a mystery to which there seems to be no logical answer.  Or is it that it's too obvious, in which case it is also unbelievable.  These are questions that, over the course of the next few days, will fill every waking moment of Graham's life, as well as that of his two children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix); questions about things beyond contemplation.  Questions to which the answers can come none to soon.After his remarkable film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" in 1999, the question everyone was asking was how is Shyamalan going to top that?  He responded with ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, another remarkable film that presented a concept of evil unique in the history of the cinema.  And with this film, Shyamalan has done it again, with another unique film that is a study in subtlety and nuance.  There is a quiet intensity to this film that evokes the kind of silence in a crowed theater that is rarely encountered.  From the opening moments, Shyamalan casts a spell over his audience, then maintains it as he continues to build the suspense, right up to the very end.  He draws you in by getting up close and personal with his camera, which successfully puts you ""in the room"" as the drama unfolds.  It's a studied presentation, and Shyamalan sets a decidedly deliberate pace that makes it work most effectively.Shyamalan traverses territory that will be familiar to Ingmar Bergman aficionados, as he delves into one of Bergman's favorite themes, that being ""God's silence,"" which we find in Graham's ruminations of his own personal situation.  Add to that the best elements found in such films as ""Independence Day"" and ""War of the Worlds,"" with a dash of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone,"" and you have ""Signs,"" a true original, unique in it's own right and artistically and imaginatively rendered by Shyamalan, a one-of-a-kind writer/director who continues to amaze with film after film.  Few directors can transfix an audience with such things as the sound of a cornfield rustling in the wind like Shyamalan can.  And he allows his scenes time to not only develop, but imply; and it's these moments of silence, in which he focuses on a doorway, or an empty swing in the yard viewed through an open window, or an intimate close-up of the expression on a character's face, that are so telling and entirely captivating.As Graham Hess, Mel Gibson certainly hits his stride with his portrayal of a man who has come to a crossroads in his life only to encounter yet another challenge that exacerbates his inner conflict even more.  Gibson has a commanding presence on screen that naturally draws the eye, and his performance here has a reserve that adds strength and depth to his character, who is dealing with some very complex issues that transcend his immediate considerations.  To make this character (and the film) work, Gibson must convey a very real sense of personal loss and a need for redemption-- and he succeeds.  Shyamalan obviously has a knack for tapping into and bringing out the best in his stars; he did it with Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" and he does it with Gibson here.  It's an honest portrayal that is very real, and altogether convincing.Joaquin Phoenix, too, gives a grounded performance as Merrill, a young man who has seemingly come to terms with certain aspects of his past, as well as the circumstances that have brought him to where he is at present.  The success of his portrayal comes from the fact that Phoenix manages to find the core of his character and play upon it.  It's a matter of having the kind of focus that makes the character believable, which is what Phoenix achieves here.  He also has the kind of chemistry with Gibson that makes their relationship as brothers credible, which, in turn, is essential to the overall credibility of the film.Shyamalan has also worked his magic with his young stars, Culkin and Breslin, each of whom give affecting performances.  Culkin displays a maturity beyond his years that works well for his character, especially in light of Morgan's current fragile state of being.  And Breslin is absolutely endearing as Mo, a performance reminiscent of young Heather O'Rourke's Carol Anne, in ""Poltergeist.""The supporting cast includes Cherry Jones (Officer Paski), Patricia Kalember (Colleen Hess), Jose L. Rodriguez (Radio Host) and M. Night Shyamalan (Ray).  A film that is intrinsically enthralling, at times frightening and genuinely eerie, ""Signs"" marks the accomplishment of a cinematic hat trick for M. Night Shyamalan, who is quickly becoming the new Hitchcock/Rod Serling of film, yet with his own unique signature.  This makes three ""originals"" in a row for Shyamalan, a rare feat even among the greatest directors.  The question now is, how is he ever going to top it?",5,Compelling Drama/Thriller from M.

As for Signs....Mel Gibson is a widowed farmer, living with his two small children and brother, who discovers a crop circle in his corn field one day.  After that things start to get weird around his farm, with strange noises, unexplained movement, ""what's that"" kind of stuff.  And that should be enough to intrigue you.

It transcends genres, reaches across demographics, and touches the hearts of millions.In this film by M. Night Shyamalan, we find a farming family wounded by a recent loss. The children have lost their mother, and thus their father has lost his wife. In the midst of this traumatic event, the father has left his faith, seeing life governed only by chance.One morning, his son and daughter find a large, perfect circle in their field, with the cornstalks laid down and spiraling outward, but not broken. At first, the father believes it to be a hoax. But as hundreds of more 'crop circles' appear around the globe, and mysterious lights shine in the night sky, it becomes clear that these events reveal that mankind is not alone in the universe ----nor on the earth.During this film, we watch as the family passes from wonder, to anxiety, to dread, and finally fear. We feel their emotions, both by the actors' compelling performances, and by Shyamalan's beautiful, almost poetic script. The cinematography is eerie and superb, and James Newton Howard's score is captivating.  The storyline is simple yet logical, with the right doses of humor, heartache, horror, and hope. From the family's decision to wear tinfoil hats to keep the aliens from reading their minds (a handy piece of advice obtained from a book by `Dr. Bimboo'), to their sightings of creatures in the fields, this movie is one you will not soon forget. It is an uplifting tale, were a family finds they are not alone in life.

The production is a masterful exhibition of using the outdoors and indoors and making each seem open and inviting or intensely claustrophobic, dependent upon plot revelations.Mel Gibson has never been better.  Ever.Joaquin Phoenix is without doubt the finest American actor of his generation, and his role here is perfectly realized, brilliantly nuanced and touchingly delivered.The children were beautifully directed and give natural, effective performances.The story's evolution is one of revelation.  Everything is not obvious all at once, and each character's personality is revealed, layer by layer, until the storyline -- alien invasion -- forces each to face his fears and brings the family together in the face of adversity.I am in awe of M. Night Shyamalan's gifts as a storyteller and director.  He is clearly -- HANDS DOWN -- the successor to Alfred Hitchcock in delivering unusual stories with stylistic flair and unexpected plot twists.The music underscore, by Shyamalan's composer of choice James Newton Howard, is beautifully evocative and chillingly appropriate throughout the film.The four times I've watched this movie represent eight of the finest movie-watching hours I've ever spent!",5,"""Signs"" shines!",1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1470,"['had', 'particular', 'expectations', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', ""'m"", 'sucker', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'experience.I', 'was', 'immediately', 'engrossed', 'Shyamalan', 'story', 'enraptured', 'execution', 'production', 'masterful', 'exhibition', 'using', 'outdoors', 'indoors', 'making', 'seem', 'open', 'inviting', 'intensely', 'claustrophobic', 'dependent', 'plot', 'revelations.Mel', 'Gibson', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Ever.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'doubt', 'finest', 'American', 'actor', 'generation', 'role', 'here', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'brilliantly', 'nuanced', 'touchingly', 'delivered.The', 'children', 'were', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'give', 'natural', 'effective', 'performances.The', 'story', 'evolution', 'one', 'revelation', 'Everything', 'not', 'obvious', 'once', 'character', 'personality', 'revealed', 'layer', 'layer', 'storyline', 'alien', 'invasion', 'forces', 'face', 'fears', 'family', 'together', 'face', 'adversity.I', 'am', 'awe', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'gifts', 'storyteller', 'director', 'clearly', 'HANDS', 'DOWN', 'successor', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'delivering', 'unusual', 'stories', 'stylistic', 'flair', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists.The', 'music', 'underscore', 'Shyamalan', 'composer', 'choice', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'beautifully', 'evocative', 'chillingly', 'appropriate', 'film.The', 'four', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'represent', 'eight', 'finest', 'movie-watching', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'spent']",Signs

The plot in and of itself is nothing special...it's the way the story is told that makes it fun.Director Shymalan really shows us the effectiveness of the ""less is more"" idea.  Throughout most of the movie, he doesn an incredible job of building up a sense of dread.  We spend much of the movie on the edge of our seats, waiting for something horrible to happen.  There are many wonderful moments when we can almost feel the dread the family is going through.  We sense the tension in the family, as well as the love, and of course, the fear of dying.  Near the end, when they are down in their cellar, all the lights go out. That's a terrifying moment, not because the lights went out, but because of all the tension leading up to it, and the worst thing that could happen if FOR THE LIGHTS TO GO OUT, because we've just GOT to see what's happening!!!Joacquin Phoenix is very good in the movie, playing a more ordinary guy than he's been asked to in a long time.  Mel Gibson, although retaining some of his usual mannerisms, is effecitve and touching.  The kids are great.  The editing and cinematography are first rate, and Shymalan the DIRECTOR does everything right.Shymalan the writer lets us down BIG TIME.  I'm sorry, but the ending is very disappointing.  We've had a terrific build up through 95% of the movie, but the final couple of scenes are just a huge letdown.  Never have I said ""THAT'S IT????""  with more disappointment and fervor.

595301,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00005JL3T,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[12, 14]","It is an excellent example of that scary movie-psychological thriller genre that is epitomized by  Alfred Hitchcock. Proving that our imaginations are far more provocation and tumultous when allowed to be-when guided by, hints of images or suggestions of evil rather than being confronted with gruesome in your face reality like you see in slasher films. It's a far more scary movie than anything with dripping blood and constant screaming, mean people in masks, or even zombies in the mall. It is the suggestion, the hint of evil that gets you thinking, that worries you about what is around the next corner, what exactly is that rustling in the cornstalks?The movie is on a number of interesting levels. The big one for me is the collision of faith with the problem of evil, in this case revolving around the issue of signs, the meaning and purpose of our existence versus randomness-chance-meaninglessness-insignificance. The question is starkly put, the character played by Mel Gibson is a preacher whose wife dies violently pinned between a truck and a tree trunk nearly cut in half, dying as she calmly talks for a last moment with her husband, remembering each family member with a specific phrase. With her death he abandons his faith and his calling, leaving just a shadow of a cross hanging over the bed, where past sunlight bleached the wall around it. Gone now to is his belief in a good God who cares about His creatures and watches over each one, showing His care and concern with signs and miracles.What is the meaning of events? Especially ones so life changing as his wife's accidental death? What is the meaning and significance of the two kids problems: the young daughter is an compulsive-obsessive about drinking water, leaving partially filled glasses all over the house. The pre-teen son is a serious asthmatic, whose life depends on an inhaler and an occasional shot, any excitement could cause him to breath his last breathe as his airways close off his breathing. These things as well as the baseball bat are cleverly tied into the story line of an alien invasion, seen through the eyes of these people in their home in the middle of a cornfield with massive meaningful (to the aliens) crop circles.The big questions is about events, how to interpret them as signs and meaningful events, rather than just chance happenstance. To see life as meaningful in the midst of what appears to be large quantities of noise and the random movement of lifeless molecules, how to see signs-events with meaning against the changing background of our often chaotic world.......The movie offers an answer, one that Mel Gibson takes to heart, regaining both his faith and his clerical collar, that signs are there, they are what you make of them that matters. The son's asthma saves him from the poison gas of the alien, the daughter's water topples off the table burning and killing the alien, ""Swing away""-his wife's last words are the spark for the brother to clobber the alien with the bat he set a baseball record with. All things are connected, everything is meaningful and significant, even the little most insignificant (a bit like the bacteria that killed the aliens in ""War of the Worlds"") have there place, if only we have eyes to see and ears to hear-the meaning of the events.The movie is ambiguous concerning the next big question, is the meaningfulness there because we see it or is it there because of the way the universe is designed and how history is channelled and controlled. In the first case, the answer is that of faith in faith itself, the power of positive thinking, the prosperity gospel that rain follows the plow, that positive thoughts attract good people and that wealth, power and all good things come to those that believe in their hearts that they deserve these things given to them by a grateful universe that loves and rewards their positive outlook.It is the sign or the meaningfulness that human beings attach to it that is the locus, the central theme? Are the crop circles meaningful because they are created by the aliens as landing zone markers, or are they meaningful as they mark the graves and failed conquest due to the presence of saving water on the planet? What is the relationship of the sign to the meaning that people attach to it? is it really there or are we just projecting our natural hopefulness onto it? Is it real or just all in our heads? does it matter?good questions, scary movie, worthwhile watching.",5,"good questions, scary movie, worthwhile watching.",1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,4472,"['excellent', 'example', 'scary', 'movie-psychological', 'thriller', 'genre', 'epitomized', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Proving', 'imaginations', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'provocation', 'tumultous', 'when', 'allowed', 'be-when', 'guided', 'hints', 'images', 'suggestions', 'evil', 'rather', 'being', 'confronted', 'gruesome', 'face', 'reality', 'see', 'slasher', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'scary', 'movie', 'anything', 'dripping', 'blood', 'constant', 'screaming', 'mean', 'people', 'masks', 'even', 'zombies', 'mall', 'suggestion', 'hint', 'evil', 'thinking', 'what', 'next', 'corner', 'what', 'exactly', 'rustling', 'cornstalks', 'movie', 'number', 'interesting', 'levels', 'big', 'one', 'collision', 'faith', 'problem', 'evil', 'case', 'revolving', 'issue', 'signs', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'existence', 'randomness-chance-meaninglessness-insignificance', 'question', 'starkly', 'put', 'character', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'preacher', 'wife', 'violently', 'pinned', 'truck', 'tree', 'trunk', 'nearly', 'cut', 'half', 'dying', 'talks', 'last', 'moment', 'husband', 'remembering', 'family', 'member', 'specific', 'phrase', 'death', 'faith', 'calling', 'leaving', 'just', 'shadow', 'cross', 'hanging', 'bed', 'where', 'past', 'sunlight', 'bleached', 'wall', 'Gone', 'now', 'belief', 'good', 'God', 'who', 'creatures', 'watches', 'one', 'showing', 'care', 'concern', 'signs', 'meaning', 'events', 'Especially', 'ones', 'so', 'life', 'changing', 'wife', 'accidental', 'death', 'What', 'meaning', 'significance', 'two', 'kids', 'problems', 'young', 'daughter', 'compulsive-obsessive', 'drinking', 'water', 'leaving', 'partially', 'filled', 'glasses', 'house', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'serious', 'asthmatic', 'life', 'inhaler', 'occasional', 'shot', 'excitement', 'could', 'cause', 'breath', 'last', 'breathe', 'airways', 'close', 'breathing', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'baseball', 'bat', 'are', 'cleverly', 'tied', 'story', 'line', 'alien', 'invasion', 'seen', 'eyes', 'people', 'home', 'middle', 'cornfield', 'massive', 'meaningful', 'aliens', 'crop', 'circles.The', 'big', 'questions', 'events', 'how', 'interpret', 'signs', 'meaningful', 'events', 'rather', 'just', 'chance', 'happenstance', 'see', 'life', 'meaningful', 'midst', 'what', 'be', 'large', 'quantities', 'noise', 'random', 'movement', 'lifeless', 'molecules', 'how', 'see', 'signs-events', 'meaning', 'changing', 'background', 'often', 'chaotic', 'world', '.The', 'movie', 'answer', 'one', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'heart', 'regaining', 'faith', 'clerical', 'collar', 'signs', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'matters', 'son', 'asthma', 'saves', 'poison', 'gas', 'alien', 'daughter', 'water', 'table', 'burning', 'killing', 'alien', 'Swing', 'away', '-his', 'wife', 'last', 'words', 'are', 'spark', 'brother', 'clobber', 'alien', 'bat', 'set', 'baseball', 'record', 'things', 'are', 'connected', 'everything', 'meaningful', 'significant', 'even', 'little', 'most', 'insignificant', 'bit', 'bacteria', 'killed', 'aliens', 'War', 'Worlds', 'have', 'place', 'only', 'have', 'eyes', 'see', 'ears', 'hear-the', 'meaning', 'events.The', 'movie', 'ambiguous', 'concerning', 'next', 'big', 'question', 'meaningfulness', 'there', 'see', 'there', 'way', 'universe', 'designed', 'how', 'history', 'channelled', 'controlled', 'first', 'case', 'answer', 'faith', 'faith', 'power', 'positive', 'thinking', 'prosperity', 'gospel', 'rain', 'plow', 'positive', 'thoughts', 'attract', 'good', 'people', 'wealth', 'power', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'believe', 'hearts', 'deserve', 'things', 'given', 'grateful', 'universe', 'rewards', 'positive', 'outlook.It', 'sign', 'meaningfulness', 'human', 'beings', 'attach', 'locus', 'central', 'theme', 'Are', 'crop', 'circles', 'meaningful', 'are', 'created', 'aliens', 'landing', 'zone', 'markers', 'are', 'meaningful', 'mark', 'graves', 'failed', 'conquest', 'due', 'presence', 'saving', 'water', 'planet', 'What', 'relationship', 'sign', 'meaning', 'people', 'attach', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'projecting', 'natural', 'hopefulness', 'real', 'just', 'heads', 'matter', 'good', 'questions', 'scary', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'watching']",Signs

Night Shyamalan's third film makes me wonder: all those people who watched Unbreakable and trashed it, then watched Signs and loved it... what exactly were they smoking at the time?Signs is everything Unbreakable was not: boring, badly-paced, lacking in tension. The only good thing about the movie (and to be fair, it was a very good thing) was the acting by all the principals. Mel Gibson, while not acting with the intensity here that he gave in Braveheart, Payback, or even Chicken Run, turns in a good performance, while both Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin give the performances of their careers. Unfortunately, however, it's not enough to give the movie the power it needs to get from jump-in-your-chair scene to jump-in-your-chair scene; there's just not enough going on in the interim. It seems like Shyamalan wanted to get the tense atmosphere going all the way through, rather than try for something else when it wasn't being a horror film (in the way Audition is a romantic comedy, say, or Cure is a murder mystery), and it simply doesn't work.Worth seeing if you just like watching the princpals act.

A minister who lost his faithe because his wife died?  COME ON!  Where's the orginiality, M Night?  The characters are all well acted, if you can stay awake long enough to watch.  By the time something scary happens, you're so not interested that the scenes have little to no impact.

595305,A35KFRFSHMC0QJ,B00005JL3T,Robert DeRose,"[0, 0]","If there has been one major complaint among critics and serious moviegoers over the last 15 years or so it is that special effects, explosions, and other nifty gadgets have sucked the soul out of modern movies.  With a new generation of filmakers and actors now arriving and making their mark over the last few years, the trend does not seem to be changing soon. One exception to this, however, seems to be writer-director M Night Shyamalan.  If the name does not seem to ring a bell in every household, at least one or two of his last movies will.  In 1999, Shyamalan wrote and directed the neo-ghost story ""The Sixth Sense"" which ended up being a movie phenomenon with an ending that still has people talking.  A year later, he directed and wrote the underrated ""Unbreakable"" with Bruce Wills and Samuel Jackson.Both movies were not without flaws but they revealed something.  That is, that Shyamalan was not only a born filmaker but, just as important, a born storyteller.  Like the early films of Spielberg or Kubrick, he was not afraid to tell a  suspense story that unfolded gradually. Often, the silence and atmosphere that permeated those films spoke louder than any bombs or guns.Now comes Shyamalan's newest films ""Signs"".  On a personel note, this was the film I had been waiting for all summer.  (Much to the determiant of my review, however, I will not give away any key plot points ).  The movie begins in a sleepy farm field located in Bucks County, Pensylvania. The farm is owned and operated by a middle aged farmer identified as Graham Hess(Mel Gibson).  Mr Hess, we find out early in the film, is a widowed farmer and former clergyman. Living with him are his two children, Morgan(Rory Culkin) and Bo(Abigail Breslin) and his former minor league baseball player brother(Joaquin Phoenix).Unlike his two previous films(especially Unbreakable),Shyamalan wastes no time getting started in this film.  The first scene starts out with Graham being awaken and led by his children out to the middle of his cornfield. There, to his understandable astonishment, lies a series of ""crop circles"" which are designed like an occult-like skelton key the size of a football field.  Are the crop circles an elaborate hoax or were they actually designed by an unidentified life source from a different planet?Shyamalan, as he has demonstrated in the past, is a master at setting up truly frighful tales. As the story unwinds, more crop circles pop up around the world and the Hess family finds that the design in their backyard is only one small piece of a bizzare global puzzle.I will not go into further detail regarding the plot.  Wether or not aliens appear or don't in this film is not the point.  A lot of critics who do not like the film, especially the ending, are missing the point.  The movie, ultimately, is not about aliens or even crop circles for that matter.  It's about the Gibson character.  As mentioned, Gibson is a widowed and a former cleryman who has lost his faith in God due to personel tragedy which, again, I won't reveal.  It is that loss of faith and, at the end, Gibson's redemption that is at the heart of this movie.The movie is not perfect. As the story closes, all the pieces might not fit neatly and the audience may have some unanswered questions. It will also not appeal to cynics and people who want ""realistic"" outcomes.  To them, I ask, why go to the movie in the first place? At the risk of sounding corny, a lot has happened around the world in the last 12 months.  Corruption in our businesses and religious institutions now seem commonplace, and nations and people in general are more isolated than ever before. So much so that a film about an ex-clergyman regaining his faith in the middle of his farm in Bucks County, PA seems to be a perfect story right about now.",4,Redemption,1028246400,"08 2, 2002",2002,3811,"['been', 'one', 'major', 'complaint', 'critics', 'serious', 'moviegoers', 'last', '15', 'years', 'so', 'special', 'effects', 'explosions', 'other', 'nifty', 'gadgets', 'have', 'sucked', 'soul', 'modern', 'movies', 'new', 'generation', 'filmakers', 'actors', 'now', 'arriving', 'making', 'mark', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'trend', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'changing', 'soon', 'One', 'exception', 'however', 'be', 'writer-director', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'name', 'not', 'seem', 'ring', 'bell', 'household', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'last', 'movies', 'will', '1999', 'Shyamalan', 'wrote', 'directed', 'neo-ghost', 'story', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'movie', 'phenomenon', 'ending', 'still', 'people', 'talking', 'year', 'later', 'directed', 'wrote', 'underrated', 'Unbreakable', 'Bruce', 'Wills', 'Samuel', 'Jackson.Both', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'flaws', 'revealed', 'something', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'born', 'filmaker', 'just', 'important', 'born', 'storyteller', 'early', 'films', 'Spielberg', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'tell', 'suspense', 'story', 'unfolded', 'gradually', 'Often', 'silence', 'atmosphere', 'permeated', 'films', 'spoke', 'louder', 'bombs', 'guns.Now', 'Shyamalan', 'newest', 'films', 'Signs', 'personel', 'note', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'summer', 'Much', 'determiant', 'review', 'however', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'sleepy', 'farm', 'field', 'located', 'Bucks', 'County', 'Pensylvania', 'farm', 'owned', 'operated', 'middle', 'aged', 'farmer', 'identified', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Mr', 'Hess', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'film', 'widowed', 'farmer', 'former', 'clergyman', 'Living', 'are', 'two', 'children', 'Morgan', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Bo', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'former', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'brother', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'especially', 'Unbreakable', 'Shyamalan', 'time', 'getting', 'started', 'film', 'first', 'scene', 'out', 'Graham', 'being', 'awaken', 'led', 'children', 'out', 'middle', 'cornfield', 'understandable', 'astonishment', 'series', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'designed', 'occult-like', 'skelton', 'key', 'size', 'football', 'field', 'Are', 'crop', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'were', 'actually', 'designed', 'unidentified', 'life', 'source', 'different', 'planet', 'Shyamalan', 'demonstrated', 'past', 'master', 'setting', 'up', 'truly', 'frighful', 'tales', 'story', 'more', 'crop', 'circles', 'pop', 'up', 'world', 'Hess', 'family', 'design', 'backyard', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'piece', 'bizzare', 'global', 'puzzle.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'detail', 'regarding', 'plot', 'not', 'aliens', 'appear', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'not', 'point', 'lot', 'critics', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'film', 'especially', 'ending', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'not', 'aliens', 'even', 'crop', 'circles', 'matter', 'Gibson', 'character', 'mentioned', 'Gibson', 'widowed', 'former', 'cleryman', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'God', 'due', 'personel', 'tragedy', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'loss', 'faith', 'end', 'Gibson', 'redemption', 'heart', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'story', 'closes', 'pieces', 'might', 'not', 'fit', 'neatly', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'will', 'also', 'not', 'appeal', 'cynics', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'realistic', 'outcomes', 'ask', 'why', 'go', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'risk', 'sounding', 'corny', 'lot', 'happened', 'world', 'last', '12', 'months', 'Corruption', 'businesses', 'religious', 'institutions', 'now', 'seem', 'commonplace', 'nations', 'people', 'general', 'are', 'more', 'isolated', 'ever', 'before', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'ex-clergyman', 'regaining', 'faith', 'middle', 'farm', 'Bucks', 'County', 'PA', 'be', 'perfect', 'story', 'right', 'about', 'now']",Signs
595306,A1YSI93GVIVPPT,B00005JL3T,Robert Fernandez,"[0, 1]","I must be in the minority, but I loved Signs not for it's chilling suspense(which I enjoyed to), but for the film's symbolic message that came at the end. But if you're the type of person who would rather watch a horror/slasher movie, this would probably disappoint you. Signs doesn't really have much violence, albeit a couple scenes of a guy attacking a creature with a bat and a dog getting impaled by a barbecue fork etc., but don't be expecting anything like the Chucky movies. What drives the film is it's many 'suspenseful' moments, where the movie builds you up so you expect something scary to happen.It was also an ingenius idea to make the setting in a country-esque area, not only so the crop circles could appear, but for the feeling that the family is in the middle of nowhere, and there's not much places to run to, except the house. The only thing about Signs that I didn't like was the whole thing with M. Night Shyamalan in the role of the guy who killed the main character's wife. It was kinda distracting; when he made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense he wasn't as distracting because he only played a very small role and didn't appear often, but maybe it's just me.The Signs DVD isn't filled with extras; just the French language track with captions and some Making Of feature.

He lets your imagination create the suspense (which it invariably will) by subscribing to ""less is more"" filmaking.  Rather than revealing ""them,"" he allows them to lurk just out of sight.  Viewers catch only glimpses of some haunting presence.As far as the DVD goes, I was a bit disappointed that this wasn't packaged as the earlier Vista series releases were, with a fold-out card-stock design.  It looks out of place next to Tombstone, Unbreakable, and The Sixth Sense on my shelf.  A cost-cutting measure perhaps?  Each of those previous Vista series releases featured 2 discs, one containing the film and the other containing all the special features.  I can only guess that the 1-disc release is another cost-cutting decision....The DVD's cover is also a bit disappointing.  I preferred the original movie poster art that depicted the crop signs leading up the the house in the distance.  M. Night preferred this as well, as he reveals in the special features for Signs.  He made sure there were not Mel Gibson shots like the studio wanted, because he reasoned (and rightly so) that this was not a movie about Mel, but a film that stands on its own.  I like very much his views on this subject.  I can't stand movies like this that feature a huge shot of one of the stars rather than a well-done piece of design the truly illustrates the movie.

You've got to be kidding me. Thewriter/director made a great first hit movie (""The SixthSense""), for sure. ""Signs"" is not only not a verygood movie, but the script uses potentially interestingand inspiring themes like crop circles and ET's and totallytrivializes them, and I'd say in fact uses them in a mostdisingenuous, uncreative way to bring in the bucks bydrawing in viewers, who see an utterly banal movie thatcovers absolutely no new ground.I've read a number of books, seen videos, etc. on theaforementioned subjects over many years, and when I heard about""Signs,"" by the creator of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I expected atleast some attempt to shed some light on what is really happening.Parenthetically I find the assertions by ""scientists"" that allcrop circles are hoaxes to be nonsense. Shyamalan could havemade an interesting drama about how the crop circles are beingcreated, and might have shown how indeed some of them could behoaxed. He could have created some intriguing interactions betweenaliens and the characters played by Mel Gibson and his family, andindeed the talent was there had he so chosen.What we get is none of these, but rather a cheap rehashof the ""aliens are bad"" theme, and a so-called ""scary"" moviewhere the aliens are really nothing more than monsters we'vealready seen in countless movies. Further, neither the alien northe crop circle themes as portrayed in ""Signs"" are even believable.Crop circles are always found in wheat fields, but of course fordramatic effect here they are in corn fields, allowing better""action.""

595333,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00005JL3T,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[4, 5]","There are certain movies that are creepy beyond belief, but Signs still falls into my ""bedtime movie"" category from the overall feeling of comfort it somehow gives me, in spite of the shivers it produces.  To me, I found it an excellent presentation of Ying and Yang, the balance of life, that for everything there is a purpose; even the most horrid of life's tragedies could be a sign of better things to come.This is a beautiful story of family love and everyday life interrupted first by a tragedy, and then by an extremely creepy alien invasion.  The low-keyed small town lives of the people the movie centers around, make the actual eeriness of the movie even more palpable.  No overt terror and no gore at all, `Signs' is still a scary movie in that it invades your own imagination with subtle shadows and innuendos that do not strike out at you with clammy arms, but sneak up with deadly stealth.The premise is that a crop farmer and former Priest finds `crop circles' out in his corn field.  Then the news channels begin reporting on these incidents occurring on a global level, and sightings of alien spacecraft hovering over Mexico City, along with footage of a bizarre intruder at a birthday party in Brazil.  The veiled suspense builds as people realize that the threat is real, while they try to figure out why these aliens are here on Earth.  The most overt horror comes from Rev. Hess's flashbacks to Officer Paski's explanation of his wife's condition at the scene of a previous accident.  Sent shudders down my spine, it did.My hat comes off in a bowing sweep to some absolutely stellar performances from some remarkable actors in this film.  Aside from Mel Gibson as Rev. Graham Hess, there is young Rory Culkin playing Morgan Hess, whose acting abilities are equal to or above those of his old brother McCauley Culkin.  The little girl Abigail Breslin playing Bo Hess is adorable and perfect in every way, and take particular note of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Merrill Hess (believe it or not, he played the kid Gary in Steve Martin's Parenthood!).  He has turned into a notable actor and quite a hottie as well.  Merrill's bravery in part of the ending is so overwhemling that it makes the character (and actor) extremely attractive.  Officer Paski is played by the extremely talented Cherry Jones (Erin Brockovich) and the part of Veterinarian Ray Reddy was played by none other than M. Night Shyamalan, the director of `Signs'.  Even the bit parts of Lionel Prichard (Michael Showalter) and Tracy Abernathy (Merritt Wever) are noteworthy performances.Overall, this is a superbly acted movie, with a stealthy creepiness that will grow on you rather than slap your face, and a story of humanity at its very finest.  Watch out for those fingers coming up under the door, one of the most subtly terrifying moments ever created.

595335,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B00005JL3T,Scott,"[0, 1]","Out of the three films Shyamalan has made, this is the worst. He's a little young to be throwing his name up on every movie he makes now. It's not like he's Spielburg. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but he simply doesn't have the credit to be trying to use his name to throw up on every film in order to express how good it is. Since the Sixth Sense his films have been progressively getting worse. ""Unbreakable"" was decent, but nowhere near as intelligent as his first film. And casting himself in the movie, albeit in a small part, was a mistake. He's acting like he's Hitchcock all of a sudden.Signs was entertaining, but not something I would have enjoyed in the theater, and not something I'd be interested in seeing again. The plot was a bit broken up, and you couldn't really understand the central theme. Was this a film about a man who loses his faith, or aliens taking over the world? I was looking forward to this film because of the director, and because of my fascination with crop circles, which didn't really have much to do with the actual movie.I suppose it's a decent film if you're bored and want to rent it one night, but don't expect any of the great plot twists like you see in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.

595336,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B00005JL3T,Scott Kolecki,"[1, 3]","My wife and I entered the movie theater with different expectations, though each of us brought with us pre-conceived ideas as to what this film would be.  Having seen other films by M. Night Shyamalan, I was uncertain that the film would have the edgy feel that an alien-invasion movie should have.  My wife, in contrast, was hoping that she would make it through the film.  By its end, we knew for certain that we wanted to own this film when it became available on DVD.The general story is simple, an alien force has arrived on Earth, presumably to invade the Earth.  Signs begin to appear in the forms of crop-circles, lights in the sky, strange sounds in the night, shadowy figures seen through windows.  As alien invasion stories go, its pretty much predictable, and Shayamalan uses his expertise to carefully execute each sequence of this invasion in a fashion that is true to his style-giving glimpses and leaving the rest to the audience imagination.But what makes this a film that surpasses the masses of alien invasion movies is the focus on the characters within the story. It is a story that deals with an individual's loss in his faith.Graham Hess (wonderfully portrayed by Mel Gibson), is a retired minister who lives in distress, despair and in doubt after the sudden loss of his wife, who died in a car accident.  He, along with his younger brother Merrill (played by Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator)), and his children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), live together on the family farm, where they maintain large fields of corn.The story opens with the children discovering a massive crop circle in the middle of the field, and from that point forward, stange events begin to unfold.  In counter-point to the alien invasion story, we learn more and more about each character, and the individual quirks, accomplishments, beliefs and doubts that each possess.  As the story grows in its intensity, the movie attempts to ask some very big questions, including the possibility that God allows everything to happen for a reason; that there really is a method to the chaos of our daily existance.Of course, the movie grows in its intensity as we discover that all the &quot;signs&quot; are pointing to an invasion that indicates that the visitors are unstoppable, and that they have arrived for a very specific reason-to harvest humans.  At the same time, the relationships between this family are strained, tested, challenged and ultimately strengthened by the events occuring around them.The story is well-conceived, although there are some notable flaws in the story, and a climax that, like &quot;Unbreakable&quot; before it, leave you going &quot;huh?&quot;  The logic behind the characters actions is often questionable, and we have to wonder what Shayamalan was considering when he wrote the script.  In addition, his use of subtlety dissolves into an effects-laden ending that is disappointing and predictable, despite the fact that it does contain a logical conclusion to the idea that &quot;nothing happens by chance.&quot;In all, it is a strong film, and definitely creepy.  From our individual experience, my wife and I were both so engrossed in the film at our initial viewing of it, and so caught up in the intensity of it, that we were both ready to leave the theather at certain points.  M. Night Shayamalan does know how to build tension, fear, and terror, and he does it in a way that is so subtle, it creeps on you unexpectedly, making you jump, or just peak through your fingers as you clutch your hands over your eyes.  I have been a fan of this genre for a very long time, and I cannot remember having such a powerful reaction to any film before this one since I was a child-it is that good, and, save for the mildly disappointing ending, and loop-holes in the story, it is an excellent film which reaches beyond the realm of an E.T. invasion story and asks some really big questions.Well worth the time and money.In addition to the movie, the DVD edition of &quot;Signs&quot; also includes a 6 part feature on the making of this film, along with deleted scenes, and a short filmed by Shayamalan as a youth.  The deleted scenes and the short aren't worth a whole lot, but the making of is an insightful journey into the process of creating a film, and worthwhile viewing.",4,A Strong Film Despite Minor Flaws,1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,4312,"['wife', 'entered', 'movie', 'theater', 'different', 'expectations', 'brought', 'pre-conceived', 'ideas', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Having', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'uncertain', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'edgy', 'feel', 'alien-invasion', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'My', 'wife', 'contrast', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'end', 'knew', 'certain', 'wanted', 'own', 'film', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'DVD.The', 'general', 'story', 'simple', 'alien', 'force', 'arrived', 'Earth', 'presumably', 'invade', 'Earth', 'Signs', 'begin', 'appear', 'forms', 'crop-circles', 'lights', 'sky', 'strange', 'sounds', 'night', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'seen', 'windows', 'alien', 'invasion', 'stories', 'go', 'pretty', 'much', 'predictable', 'Shayamalan', 'expertise', 'carefully', 'execute', 'sequence', 'invasion', 'fashion', 'true', 'style-giving', 'glimpses', 'leaving', 'rest', 'audience', 'imagination.But', 'what', 'film', 'masses', 'alien', 'invasion', 'movies', 'focus', 'characters', 'story', 'story', 'deals', 'individual', 'loss', 'faith.Graham', 'Hess', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'retired', 'minister', 'who', 'distress', 'despair', 'doubt', 'sudden', 'loss', 'wife', 'who', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'younger', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Gladiator', 'children', 'Morgan', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Bo', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'live', 'together', 'family', 'farm', 'where', 'maintain', 'large', 'fields', 'corn.The', 'story', 'children', 'discovering', 'massive', 'crop', 'circle', 'middle', 'field', 'point', 'forward', 'stange', 'events', 'begin', 'unfold', 'counter-point', 'alien', 'invasion', 'story', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'character', 'individual', 'quirks', 'accomplishments', 'beliefs', 'doubts', 'possess', 'story', 'intensity', 'movie', 'ask', 'very', 'big', 'questions', 'including', 'possibility', 'God', 'everything', 'happen', 'reason', 'really', 'method', 'chaos', 'daily', 'existance.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'intensity', 'discover', 'quot', 'signs', 'quot', 'are', 'pointing', 'invasion', 'visitors', 'are', 'unstoppable', 'have', 'arrived', 'very', 'specific', 'reason-to', 'harvest', 'humans', 'same', 'time', 'relationships', 'family', 'are', 'strained', 'tested', 'challenged', 'ultimately', 'strengthened', 'events', 'occuring', 'them.The', 'story', 'well-conceived', 'are', 'notable', 'flaws', 'story', 'climax', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'leave', 'going', 'quot', 'quot', 'logic', 'characters', 'actions', 'often', 'questionable', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'Shayamalan', 'was', 'considering', 'when', 'wrote', 'script', 'addition', 'use', 'subtlety', 'dissolves', 'effects-laden', 'ending', 'disappointing', 'predictable', 'fact', 'contain', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'idea', 'quot', 'nothing', 'chance.', 'quot', 'strong', 'film', 'definitely', 'creepy', 'individual', 'experience', 'wife', 'were', 'so', 'engrossed', 'film', 'initial', 'viewing', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'intensity', 'were', 'ready', 'leave', 'theather', 'certain', 'points', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shayamalan', 'know', 'how', 'build', 'tension', 'fear', 'terror', 'way', 'so', 'subtle', 'unexpectedly', 'making', 'jump', 'just', 'peak', 'fingers', 'clutch', 'hands', 'eyes', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'genre', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'having', 'such', 'powerful', 'reaction', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'child-it', 'good', 'save', 'mildly', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'loop-holes', 'story', 'excellent', 'film', 'realm', 'E.T', 'invasion', 'story', 'really', 'big', 'questions.Well', 'time', 'money.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'DVD', 'edition', 'quot', 'Signs', 'quot', 'also', '6', 'part', 'feature', 'making', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'short', 'filmed', 'Shayamalan', 'youth', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'short', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'making', 'insightful', 'journey', 'process', 'creating', 'film', 'viewing']",Signs

The 'boo' frights were terrific and many of them made me jump out of my skin. The scares work best when they are psychological and silent, or all in your head. Just imagine what this family goes through, particularly in the brilliant finale. M Night Shyamalan puts you right in their shoes and doesn't let up with the terror until the very last frame.--Is ""Signs"" a horror movie? Yes. Is it a sci-fi movie? Yes. But when it all comes down to it, what is this movie genre-wise? This movie, to me at least, was all about the tale of this family, and the strife they're going through after losing someone close to them. The father is a priest who has lost all faith and the kids prefer their father's brother. ""Signs"" is about aliens, but it's about how the alien attack affects the family and makes them bring out the love and trust they all must have in each other to survive such a horrifying ordeal. This was shown amazingly in the wonderful and tragic final dinner scene.--Mel Gibson gives one of his finest performances to date. He is a tour-de-force as Graham Hess; he sold me completely in his role. The inner turmoil the character was experiencing was so brilliantly portrayed by Gibson, during quiet, lonely moments or through big, dramatic scenes such as the aforementioned final dinner scene. Joaquin Phoenix was very strong and always believable in his supporting performance as Graham's brother Merrill. The adorable Abigail Breslin and another one of the Culkin clan, Rory Culkin, are terrific rising stars with a lot of talent at such young ages.--M Night Shyamalan continues his run of terrific writing/directing efforts, he brings across the suspense of the situations in the film seamlessly, and injects a lot of emotion into the film. The strange and subtle camera movements and angles were also much appreciated.THE BAD:--I must warn that this section of my review has nothing more, nothing less than THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOR ""SIGNS"". DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISHED TO BE SPOILED! Like many others, I found the way the extra-terrestrials were defeated at the end of the film a little ludicrous and too convenient.

Night Shyamalan has been hailed as the next Spielberg with such writing/directing/producing credits as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs &amp; his new venture, The Village, and rightly so, in my humble opinion.  This film is generally unlike The Sixth Sense &amp; Unbreakable. That is precisely why Signs received mixed reviews from critics at the box office.Mel Gibson stars as the newly widowed ex-reverend/father Graham Ness. Along with his younger, ex-baseball hero brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and two young children, son, Morgan and little daughter, Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), the recently faithless ex-minister &amp; his family experience accidents, death, crop circles, extra-terrestrials, and much more while director/writer/ producer Shyamalan pursues a spookfest with great (thank you, H.G. Wells) &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; undertones.While the whole Ness clan re-evaluates their spiritual past, present and uncertain future, Graham &amp; Merrill debate/discuss what kind of people they really were while growing up, what kind of people they are now and what the experience that they go through in the film makes them out to be in the end. There are many a spiritual idea/moral to this odd story by Shyamalan &amp; certainly worth a look-see. Does the Ness family perceive a phenomenal occurrence as a series of spiritual signs and heavenly portents, or do they only believe in fate, chance, luck and divine providence?Watch this oddly, extraordinary film and find out for yourself.Happy Watching!",4,M.

595346,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005JL3T,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[23, 40]","I was delightfully surprised how good this movie was. I had seen a special on the Discovery Channel a couple of years ago that explained how crop circles were made w/ boards and rope... so they were no longer a mystery... how could ""Signs"" possibly be stimulating enough to not be laughable?Outstanding performances by  Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin bring the emotional center of this story to the viewer. You quickly become a member of this family and feel the recent loss of a wife & mother due to a tragic accident. The accident tests the faith of Gibson, who quits his job as the local church Reverend and holds tight to his fervent anger toward God.M. Night Shyamalan is a superb director, but not the best actor. He plays a small, yet crucial role in the film and in contrast to the stellar performances from the rest of the cast, his wooden acting is very distracting. Fortunately, his screen-time is limited and does not do irreparable damage to the rhythm of the story.Shyamalan pays homage to one of the ultimate sci-fi classics, ""War of the Worlds,""  with unclothed aliens with superior technology that have no respect for human life.What seems like a practical joke from local kids, turns out to be a global mystery... crop circles showing up in large numbers overnight, all over the world... and then something more chilling shows up and is captured on global news.The way pranksters have made crop circles in the past is covered in the film, so the story does not expect you to dismiss previous knowledge, but rather acknowledge that many  previous crop circles were indeed bogus... but these new ones cannot be ignored.There are some special effects, but they are few and far between... and Shyamalan knows that the unseen is far more horrific than what you can see. The music and sound effects help to make you sit on the edge of your seat and a few scenes had me let out a small scream when I was startled.This is a classic film-going experience and while it is too intense for small children, it is still family friendly.

595348,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B00005JL3T,S Martin,"[1, 2]","I expected a lot more out of this movie, the trailer really hinted at more. Instead of seeing a creepy movie I watched a movie about a man dealing with emotions, and the occasional alien. It just didn't add up for me.The movie really drags on; you spend most of the movie watching the crop circles and delving into the family history. You find out that the father (A former pastor) lost his faith in God after his wife was killed by a neighbour who fell asleep at the wheel. He's now trying to raise his two children with the help of his younger brother, who once played for the minor leagues, but had the highest strike out record. Here are the four of them, living in a small house on a corn farm, trying to patch together their lives. Then the crop circles came.For a movie that was hyped as much as it was, the special effects didn't live up to the promises.  The spaceships that appear in the sky are glowing lights, no definition, no close ups, just small spots of light.  You only get two good shots of the alien, along with a couple shots of their hands. They look like a stereotypical alien, tall, slender with long limbs and an oval head. At least they could have made them look more interesting.Overall, the film is a disappointment, I think there were a lot of things that could have been left out. The biggest one to me was the death of the wife. You keep seeing minor flashbacks throughout the movie, which eventually play out completely and help save one of the children from an alien, but they don't add anything to the movie. Mel Gibson is a good enough actor to be able to portray his loss of faith and anger without a bunch of flashback scenes. I also feel the last 10 minutes or so of the movie could be cut off, the only purpose they showed was how the family could unite together and start healing. It's a nice thought, but since the movie was hyped to be about aliens invading earth, the family plot just seems to make the movie drag on.",3,Disappointing,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1960,"['expected', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'trailer', 'really', 'hinted', 'more', 'Instead', 'seeing', 'creepy', 'movie', 'watched', 'movie', 'man', 'dealing', 'emotions', 'occasional', 'alien', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'me.The', 'movie', 'really', 'spend', 'most', 'movie', 'watching', 'crop', 'circles', 'delving', 'family', 'history', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'former', 'pastor', 'lost', 'faith', 'God', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'neighbour', 'who', 'fell', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'now', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'help', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'once', 'played', 'minor', 'leagues', 'had', 'highest', 'strike', 'out', 'record', 'Here', 'are', 'four', 'living', 'small', 'house', 'corn', 'farm', 'trying', 'patch', 'together', 'lives', 'Then', 'crop', 'circles', 'came.For', 'movie', 'was', 'hyped', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'promises', 'spaceships', 'appear', 'sky', 'are', 'glowing', 'lights', 'definition', 'close', 'ups', 'just', 'small', 'spots', 'light', 'only', 'get', 'two', 'good', 'shots', 'alien', 'couple', 'shots', 'hands', 'look', 'stereotypical', 'alien', 'tall', 'slender', 'long', 'limbs', 'oval', 'head', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'interesting.Overall', 'film', 'disappointment', 'think', 'were', 'lot', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'biggest', 'one', 'was', 'death', 'wife', 'keep', 'seeing', 'minor', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'eventually', 'play', 'out', 'completely', 'help', 'save', 'one', 'children', 'alien', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'be', 'able', 'portray', 'loss', 'faith', 'anger', 'bunch', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'also', 'feel', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'off', 'only', 'purpose', 'showed', 'was', 'how', 'family', 'could', 'unite', 'together', 'start', 'healing', 'nice', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'hyped', 'be', 'aliens', 'invading', 'earth', 'family', 'plot', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'drag']",Signs

595356,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JL3T,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","It's becoming a staple of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan to explore paranormal phenomenons with his films.  ""The Sixth Sense"" encapsulated the world's deeply rooted belief in the afterlife and the existence of restless spirits (ghosts); ""Unbreakable"" explored the inexplicable chance of surviving horrific catastrophes with either minor or no injuries sustained (the unexplained/miracles).  Now with his latest project, Shyamalan explores the phenomenon of crop circles and the possibility of life on other planets.  In short, aliens.Like his previous work, ""Signs"" is a deliberately paced film, slowly building the suspense as a no-name place like Bucks County, PE becomes the center of extraterrestrial activity.  The movie begins with widowed and retired reverend Graham Hesse (Gibson) waking from a restless sleep to the sound of Bo (Breslin) and Morgan (Culkin), his two young children, screaming from the cornfields.  He rushes out in a panic to find the both of them staring raptly at a circular patch of flattened stalks, one of many shapes that form an intricate pattern on nearly half his field.  Before long, crop circles start appearing en masse and soon there is a national uproar with news stations all over the world airing frightening footage 24 hours a day.  The obsession of Graham's children and his brother Merrill (Phoenix) grows when Morgan purchases an obscure reference on aliens from a local bookstore, sharing his wealth of information with his highly skeptical father.  Graham is soon wrapped up into it all as everything that Morgan reads and tells him becomes a reality, the group relying on their child messiah to guide them through the distinct possibility of a hostile invasion.Shyamalan gives us another small cast of characters, creating the illusion of total isolation with the stillness of the Hesse family's sprawling acres.  Gibson is the stand-out as the tortured Graham, struggling to raise his children while grieving their deceased mother.  Rory Culkin and Abigail Bentley are Morgan and Bo, Graham's precocious children; there seems to be a wealth of Culkin boys and it looks like Rory's the last in a long line, not to mention the best of them all so far.  People will find it hard not to crack a smile when Breslin's immense, puppy-dog eyes are consuming the screen and her tiny voice is asking Gibson for a glass of water (Bo has a fear of contamination).  Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones and Shyamalan make up the supporting cast.  Phoenix, having played many a queer and tortured soul (Gladiator, To Die For) in films past gets to show off comedic abilities no one knew he had.  Shyamalan is a fair actor but he's better off behind the camera.  Although he does an adequate job as an anguished neighbor named Ray (he has cameos in both of his previous films), his character serves no other purpose than to conspicuously drop an integral clue for the film's climactic ending.Although ""Signs"" is for the most part moody and suspenseful, it's also speckled with humor, particularly the farce involving long-documented folklore about aliens.  Shymalan goofs his own subject matter and gets genuine laughs, the many diverse superstitions of his audience (skeptics and believers alike) meshed into a universal humor.  Overall, the film will entertain most audiences but it only packs half the frightening punch of the ""The Sixth Sense"".  Those looking to get the creeps will feel a little disappointed but nonetheless satiated.Rent ""Signs"" if you crave a good-old fashioned thriller with light scares and a director who will never tire of exploring the strange and unusual.",3,Shyamalan Phenomenons (3.5 stars),1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,3617,"['becoming', 'staple', 'writer/director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'explore', 'paranormal', 'phenomenons', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'encapsulated', 'world', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'belief', 'afterlife', 'existence', 'restless', 'spirits', 'ghosts', 'Unbreakable', 'explored', 'inexplicable', 'chance', 'surviving', 'horrific', 'catastrophes', 'minor', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'unexplained/miracles', 'Now', 'latest', 'project', 'Shyamalan', 'phenomenon', 'crop', 'circles', 'possibility', 'life', 'other', 'planets', 'short', 'previous', 'work', 'Signs', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'film', 'slowly', 'building', 'suspense', 'no-name', 'place', 'Bucks', 'County', 'PE', 'center', 'extraterrestrial', 'activity', 'movie', 'widowed', 'retired', 'reverend', 'Graham', 'Hesse', 'Gibson', 'waking', 'restless', 'sleep', 'sound', 'Bo', 'Breslin', 'Morgan', 'Culkin', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'screaming', 'cornfields', 'out', 'panic', 'find', 'staring', 'raptly', 'circular', 'patch', 'flattened', 'stalks', 'one', 'many', 'shapes', 'form', 'intricate', 'pattern', 'nearly', 'field', 'long', 'crop', 'circles', 'start', 'appearing', 'en', 'masse', 'soon', 'national', 'uproar', 'news', 'stations', 'world', 'airing', 'frightening', 'footage', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'obsession', 'Graham', 'children', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Phoenix', 'when', 'Morgan', 'purchases', 'obscure', 'reference', 'aliens', 'local', 'bookstore', 'sharing', 'wealth', 'information', 'highly', 'skeptical', 'father', 'Graham', 'soon', 'wrapped', 'up', 'everything', 'Morgan', 'reads', 'reality', 'group', 'relying', 'child', 'messiah', 'guide', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'hostile', 'invasion.Shyamalan', 'small', 'cast', 'characters', 'creating', 'illusion', 'total', 'isolation', 'stillness', 'Hesse', 'family', 'sprawling', 'acres', 'Gibson', 'stand-out', 'tortured', 'Graham', 'struggling', 'raise', 'children', 'grieving', 'deceased', 'mother', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Abigail', 'Bentley', 'are', 'Morgan', 'Bo', 'Graham', 'precocious', 'children', 'there', 'be', 'wealth', 'Culkin', 'boys', 'Rory', 'last', 'long', 'line', 'not', 'mention', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'People', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'crack', 'smile', 'when', 'Breslin', 'immense', 'puppy-dog', 'eyes', 'are', 'consuming', 'screen', 'tiny', 'voice', 'asking', 'Gibson', 'glass', 'water', 'Bo', 'fear', 'contamination', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'Shyamalan', 'make', 'up', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Phoenix', 'having', 'played', 'many', 'queer', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Gladiator', 'Die', 'films', 'past', 'show', 'off', 'comedic', 'one', 'knew', 'had', 'Shyamalan', 'fair', 'actor', 'better', 'off', 'camera', 'adequate', 'job', 'anguished', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Ray', 'cameos', 'previous', 'films', 'character', 'other', 'purpose', 'conspicuously', 'drop', 'integral', 'clue', 'film', 'climactic', 'Signs', 'most', 'part', 'moody', 'suspenseful', 'also', 'speckled', 'humor', 'particularly', 'farce', 'involving', 'long-documented', 'folklore', 'aliens', 'Shymalan', 'goofs', 'own', 'subject', 'matter', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'many', 'diverse', 'superstitions', 'audience', 'skeptics', 'believers', 'alike', 'meshed', 'universal', 'humor', 'Overall', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'most', 'audiences', 'only', 'frightening', 'punch', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'looking', 'get', 'creeps', 'will', 'feel', 'little', 'disappointed', 'nonetheless', 'satiated.Rent', 'Signs', 'crave', 'good-old', 'fashioned', 'thriller', 'light', 'scares', 'director', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'tire', 'exploring', 'strange', 'unusual']",Signs

On a whim last night I mindmelded with the couch and watched this whole film.Verdict is ** 1/2 stars. Why?  Its a strange film mixing one mans path to redemption (Gibson) and the aliens-are-coming-to-kill-us -all flick. What this film does differently than many of the aliens-are-coming-to-kill-us flicks is that most of the action centers on Gibson's property and very little elsewhere.The director does set successfully a creepy tone of tension throughout the movie which in my opinion never really pays off. As the story climaxes it just doesn't sell itself to me. The bad guys have you trapped in the basement then all of a sudden decide to go home. Leaving scared humans in the basement.You'd think then that'd be it end of credits with hugs for all. Nope! After a tense night, coming out of the basement and receiving news of the bad guys left one is still in your house! Not only one, but one that is totally unbelievable looking. The alien looked like a digital effect more than a living and breathing creature. CG aliens don't cut it with me. Might for the younger generation - I prefer a film to at least try to make an alien tangible. These aliens were not.Then we find out its water that kills these alien folk. We have such a lauded director going for a beat to death device that defeats that aliens. You'd think that with all the singing of praise for Mr Shyamalan gets he'd pull a more creative plot device out of his back pocket. The baby monitor too I thought was a bit hokey.For the at times cheesiness of the story. There are moments it really connects. The study in human paranoia is interesting. The atmosphere and the vibe are very well done. The flashlight scene in the cornfield had good tension too.In the end though. I'm forced to say its not a great film. I agree with the previous reviewer that called it a B film. It defintely has that feel. It just wasn't a satisfying journey for me. I grant that Shyamalan has a great style.

In Signs 2, a herd of aliens allergic to down feathers will attack a huge pillow.The Movie: I enjoyed Sixth Sense. It was entertaining, it was engaging, had solid acting, and created a genuine tension that justified its long silences. Its structure has been ripped off more than anything except the matrix in the last ten years. The memory is fading however with Unbreakable and now Signs, two films with great potential and no follow through.Signs is driven by a worldwide alien attack, as witnessed from the perspective of a small conflicted farm family. Decent enough on screen together (led by Mel Gibson as a former priest) the actors in respective roles look and act nothing like a family that lives together, torn apart by death or not. Their lives are changed by crop circles which magically appear overnight in Gibson's corn fields. eventually we learn that these patterns are landing markers for alien invaders. So far so good. According to an early ""probing mission"" (not that kind perv) at the farm, the aliens are athletically gifted enough to outrun a great athlete and jump not only onto a roof but off of it and into distant corn crops. They can also spray poison gas from their wrists. Great, sounds challenging. The aliens attack and have camoflouging devices for their ships that make them invisible to the world. The set up is there for a truly amazing effort to be needed to bring down these guys. They have the technology and athletic ability to dwarf our own, what possible defense is there?Water.That's right, these technological geniuses are apparently big fans of advanced stupidity, too. When M. Night Shyamalan guest stars in his movie as the man who accidentally killed the preacher's wife, he was basically there to explain that ""he planned to go to the water"" because apparently ""the aliens don't like water, all the crop circles are inland after all"" right?. (a) the crop circles are probably inland because if you drew them in water they wouldn't stay there.  It's water. (b) landing in the middle of the pacific ocean isn't the best strategy attack wise.(c) why would they attack a planet covered by 70% water where the very atmosphere is filled with it? More obviously if they are able to build such great spacecraft with armor and camoflouge, why not get some body suits with similar technology so that water doesn't destroy them so easily? This isn't where the contradictions end unfortunately. The afore-mentioned athletic ability? It's explained by a child that the aliens wouldn't have much athletic ability because they would be intellectually developed. Well that makes the alien's inability to figure out how to open a door even more infuriating, as well ass the final scene in which one literally doesn't even fight back as its' being pummeled with a baseball bat. There is another scene where, stumbling on a grate as the family is trapped in a basement, a group of aliens attempt to find a way to get at the family. I was excited about this part for a specific reason. All movie long the little girls aversion to water (""it's contaminated"" she keeps repeating) was stressed. There was something different about her when she was born (she didn't cry at birth...) I was fully expecting this was to set up a twist to the effect that she had been tested on by the aliens as a way to research a resistance to the effects water had on them, and that she was somehow linked to them. A combination of human and alien dna with their strengths and less weaknesses? Maybe she was going to turn on her family, but that would have made all that foreshadowing mean something, so that a well directed and smartly paced buildup was worth something? No.  The aliens literally were just trying to figure out a way to get in a basement. Here, an idea. You have shown you have gas that you can emit from your wrists. You face a porous basement. Spray the gas either through that huge grate or underneath the door.In the end this is the undoing of the movie. The aliens are never scary or very smart. Their design has nothing original to it. They are tall bald skinny green aliens just like any other that you have ever seen in movies, and dumb as a box of hair. I am happy that M. Night gets to write and direct his own stories in a day where 5-6 people seem to write every movie. That does not, however mean that he has lost the need to ask someone to read it before he makes it into a feature. This is lazy filmmaking by a director/writer refusing to challenge himself or the audience, knowing his skill for building suspense will carry his movie on the big screen.

I know it's fake, but that doesn't matter. In this movie, there are no gory scenes. Not one. There is silence (echoing, mysterious, terrifying silence). And intrigue, and incredible suspense. It keeps you guessing right to the end, and while watching and waiting, you get the impression that something terrible (or wonderful) can happen. There's no background score to drown out the lack of sound. I saw this one in the theater, and was literally shaking in fear (and was tremendously relieved when it was over and I could release that pent up anxiety some other way). I can't remember a single movie that caused this kind of fear. The story was very good, but the way it was presented, was just incredible. It's something I really want to see again, but haven't been able to work up the nerve to.

595361,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JL3T,Steve Douglas,"[1, 1]","All my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from Standard Def DVD quality to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO.....While I do own this film on a Standard Def DVD this is not a side by side comparison.  That said, I did notice a significant improvement in the video transfer to Blu Ray.  Color grading for this film is very natural with images only slightly on the warm side. With improved contrast, details are much more clearly defined.  While scenes shot in the corn field might have presented many issues of aliasing and blurred details, the Blu Ray transfer does a fine job of keeping the details sharper than the Standard Def DVD without obvious DNR (digital noise reduction)  The Mbps rate appeared to average from the high 20's to low 30's.  A fine transfer and one that surprised me with its quality.AUDIO....The audio is a clear standout and one that I did not expect to be as demo worthy of a home theater as it is.  The audio is an uncompressed lossless LPCM 5.1.  While they say 'uncompressed', all audio on Blu Rays is compressed, it is just not as compressed as is a lossy codec found on most all Standard Def DVDs as well as a few Blu Rays like 'Goodfellas'.  Though I watched and listened on a 7.1 audio system that simply muxes the 6th & 7th channels to equal that of the normal 4th and 5th rear channels, you will be surprised at the great amount of discreet directionality the audio mix presents to every channel.  Along with the great musical score that very much created the creepy ambiance, the front sides and rear channels are used most prolifically for discreet foley fx.  It was a pleasure to watch a movie that didn't rely upon explosions and car crashes in order to utilize the surround speakers.  Even with quiet dramas there is much call for proper audio mixing, but that usually is the first  thing to go when it comes to film's budgets.  In 'Signs', it is quite apparent that proper audio mixing was an equal priority and the audio here is outstanding.  The LFE channel gets its moments as well when appropriate to the film's storyline.EXTRAS.....The one clearly negative thing about this Blu Ray is that there are 7 previews of other films.  You are paying for their advertising which takes up room on the Blu Ray calling for even more video compression in order to fit it all in.  Who wants to see an advertisement for a movie that is already 10 years old?  Not me, I'd rather have an improved video transfer with less compression.That said, the other extras are also outstanding.  Included are 6 deleted scenes, two of which, IMHO, could have been included in an extended version.  Most Blu Rays have a 'Making Of' documentary and many of them I find to be boring hyperbole. However, this film's 'Making of' is divided into 6 chapters some of which showed some of the filmed back room  storyboard discussions, gearing up the special fx and the set building.  I found them all interesting.Another extra that I have never seen on a Blu Ray DVD before was one they called Storyboard Multi-angle. This presented two of the more notable scenes and gave you 3 choices in how to view them...either with the full audio mix including foley fx, music score and dialogue, just the music score or just the foley fx.  Enjoyed this one and wish they had done this with a few more scenes than just the two.Finally, a one minute film with an introduction by the director of his first film made when he was only a child himself.  It was funny to watch the mind of the adolescent film maker to be.All in all, except for the advertising you have to pay for, this Blu Ray is a very definite step up from the standard def DVD.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",5,Signs on Blu Ray--A Great Blu Ray Surprise,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,4491,"['many', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'quality', 'higher', 'standard', 'set', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Summaries', 'plot', 'opinions', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'majority', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'redundant.Keep', 'mind', 'however', 'quality', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'dependent', 'quality', 'TV', 'monitor', 'are', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'theater', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'using', 'monitor', 'use', 'fairly', 'new', 'Panasonic', 'ZT', '65', '34', 'plasma', 'amps', 'speakers', 'cables', 'BluRay', 'player', 'Surround', 'Processor', 'use', 'are', 'hi', 'end', 'esoteric', 'gear', 'provide', 'more', 'realistic', 'objective', 'perspective.VIDEO', '..While', 'do', 'own', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'not', 'side', 'side', 'comparison', 'said', 'did', 'notice', 'significant', 'improvement', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Color', 'grading', 'film', 'very', 'natural', 'images', 'only', 'slightly', 'warm', 'side', 'improved', 'contrast', 'details', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'scenes', 'shot', 'corn', 'field', 'might', 'have', 'presented', 'many', 'issues', 'aliasing', 'blurred', 'details', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'fine', 'job', 'keeping', 'details', 'sharper', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'obvious', 'DNR', 'digital', 'noise', 'reduction', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'appeared', 'average', 'high', '20', 'low', '30', 'fine', 'transfer', 'one', 'surprised', 'quality.AUDIO', '.The', 'audio', 'clear', 'standout', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'demo', 'worthy', 'home', 'theater', 'audio', 'uncompressed', 'lossless', 'LPCM', '5.1', 'say', ""'uncompressed"", 'audio', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'compressed', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'compressed', 'lossy', 'codec', 'found', 'most', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'Blu', 'Rays', ""'Goodfellas"", 'watched', 'listened', '7.1', 'audio', 'system', 'simply', 'muxes', '6th', '7th', 'channels', 'equal', 'normal', '4th', '5th', 'rear', 'channels', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'great', 'amount', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'audio', 'mix', 'presents', 'channel', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'very', 'much', 'created', 'creepy', 'ambiance', 'front', 'sides', 'rear', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'most', 'prolifically', 'discreet', 'foley', 'fx', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'upon', 'explosions', 'car', 'crashes', 'order', 'utilize', 'surround', 'speakers', 'Even', 'quiet', 'dramas', 'much', 'call', 'proper', 'audio', 'mixing', 'usually', 'first', 'thing', 'go', 'when', 'film', 'budgets', ""'Signs"", 'quite', 'apparent', 'proper', 'audio', 'mixing', 'was', 'equal', 'priority', 'audio', 'here', 'outstanding', 'LFE', 'channel', 'moments', 'well', 'when', 'appropriate', 'film', 'storyline.EXTRAS', 'one', 'clearly', 'negative', 'thing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', '7', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'paying', 'advertising', 'up', 'room', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'calling', 'even', 'more', 'video', 'compression', 'order', 'fit', 'Who', 'see', 'advertisement', 'movie', 'already', '10', 'years', 'old', 'Not', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'improved', 'video', 'transfer', 'less', 'compression.That', 'said', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Included', 'are', '6', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'IMHO', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'extended', 'version', 'Most', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'have', ""'Making"", 'documentary', 'many', 'find', 'be', 'boring', 'hyperbole', 'However', 'film', ""'Making"", 'divided', '6', 'chapters', 'showed', 'filmed', 'back', 'room', 'storyboard', 'discussions', 'gearing', 'up', 'special', 'fx', 'set', 'building', 'found', 'interesting.Another', 'extra', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'called', 'Storyboard', 'Multi-angle', 'presented', 'two', 'more', 'notable', 'scenes', 'gave', '3', 'choices', 'how', 'view', 'either', 'full', 'audio', 'mix', 'including', 'foley', 'fx', 'music', 'score', 'dialogue', 'just', 'music', 'score', 'just', 'foley', 'fx', 'Enjoyed', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'just', 'two.Finally', 'one', 'minute', 'film', 'introduction', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'child', 'was', 'funny', 'watch', 'mind', 'adolescent', 'film', 'maker', 'be.All', 'advertising', 'have', 'pay', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'very', 'definite', 'step', 'up', 'standard', 'def', 'DVD.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'focused', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'HELP', 'well.Thanks', 'reading']",Signs

This film is extremely well-written, outstandingly acted by all familiar actors who disappear into their roles, and effectively directed by Shyamalan who also wrote the film.  James Newton Howard,ERandThe Sixth Sense, created the memorable and haunting score which greatly added to the atmosphere of the film.  In addition, the special effects and make-up team, guided by Shyamalan's vision and direction, created chills and believability without massive Spielberg-style (War of the Worlds) treatment which would have been only a distraction in this film.My only real criticism is that this film has Shyamalan's trademark approach.  That means that it's all rather contrived and he hammers us at the end for not seeing the ending coming (yet again, a laThe Sixth SenseandUnbreakable).  However, to pick on this element of his directorial/writing style is like picking on Hitchcock's use of suspense in his classic films.This film has great repeat value even after knowing how the ""signs"" all add up.

595364,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JL3T,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 3]","It's probably apt that a film about the human tendency to (mis)interpret things should ultimately have very little to do with the crop circle story seemingly pitched by its trailer.  Reviewing this film without giving too much away is almost impossible, so all I will say is this: M. Night Shyamalan is a master storyteller.  More than any other writer/director working today, he seems to understand the awesome power of a story well-told.  It's a rare pleasure to be confidently able to hand yourself over to a filmmaker for two hours to be toyed with, manipulated, deceived and misled, and ultimately stunned by a revelation.  But Shyamalan somehow manages to do all of that every time.  In the wasteland of predictable trash that flows daily out of Hollywood's slave pits, he reminds us that a good story can still hold us completely in its thrall. Mel Gibson as a minister might be a little hard to buy here, and the overt religiosity of Shyamalan's particular take on `serendipity' might push some viewers away.  But this is still a very good film, and love or hate Shyamalan's personal philosophy, you still have to thank him for that.",4,Shyamalan does it again,1039046400,"12 5, 2002",2002,1141,"['probably', 'apt', 'film', 'human', 'tendency', 'mis', 'interpret', 'things', 'should', 'ultimately', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'crop', 'circle', 'story', 'seemingly', 'pitched', 'trailer', 'Reviewing', 'film', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'almost', 'impossible', 'will', 'say', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'master', 'storyteller', 'More', 'other', 'writer/director', 'working', 'today', 'understand', 'awesome', 'power', 'story', 'well-told', 'rare', 'pleasure', 'be', 'confidently', 'able', 'hand', 'filmmaker', 'two', 'hours', 'be', 'toyed', 'manipulated', 'deceived', 'misled', 'ultimately', 'stunned', 'revelation', 'Shyamalan', 'somehow', 'manages', 'do', 'time', 'wasteland', 'predictable', 'trash', 'daily', 'Hollywood', 'slave', 'pits', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'hold', 'completely', 'thrall', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'minister', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'buy', 'here', 'overt', 'religiosity', 'Shyamalan', 'particular', 'take', 'serendipity', 'might', 'push', 'viewers', 'away', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'love', 'hate', 'Shyamalan', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'still', 'have', 'thank']",Signs

In one review the reviewer mentioned that seeing a flashlight roll around is not scary.

I am somewhat a fan of psychological thrillers (The Others) and enjoy most of Mel Gibson's movies. This movie delivered some excellent punches and lightened the mood with a little humor.The idea is a former preacher, Graham (Mel Gibson) is a widower who tends a corn farm in Bucks County Pennsylvania (in the theater in Lionville PA the audience started to cheer when the name of the county came up on the screen). He lives with his two children and brother (J. Phoenix). The preacher notices some crop circles in his fields and does not think about it. Then reports from all over the country state that similar incidents are occuring all over the place. Then in Mexico, lights appear in the sky. The son believes it is an invasion.What we learn is that Graham has lost his faith in God since the death of his wife. He no longer preaches the word and refuses to pray.There is an effective use of terror in this movie, especially the birthday party scene in Brazil. I also was terrified when the house was boarded up and the aliens started attacking the house. Of course we never really see them until the end of the film, but that is what adds to the high level of tension. People are afraid of what they do not understand nor what they cannot see.Character development is on a high priority in this movie. We know alot about these people by the end; including the children. The special effects were at a minimum but they were over shadowed by the plot. The aliens were uniquely different in design; and they were not pacifists.I went to see this with a friend who did not want to see it because of the mixed reviews. I NEVER BASE SEEING A MOVIE ON A CRITIC. You should make you own evaluations.This movie has alot of elements: drama, humor (classic Mel Gibson humor), science fiction and horror. It also has heart and the warmth of family.I would recommend this film to those who like alot of ingredents in their film. Mel Gibson does another fine job. I love the guy.

Perhaps the order of his movies should've been exactly the other way around because now he's becoming a ""take cover, the new film from Shyamalan is out"" proposition.Shame twice because ""Signs"" could have been a great film and only because someone forgot to hire a script writer the film it was not.But i'd rather start with the positives. Despite the incredible plot holes i actually enjoyed this b-flick. I enjoyed it because :a)Mel Gibson, after years of pointless trash films (culminating with the ultra silly What Women Want recently) finally plays a role in which he does not annoy. Now that is news.b) Because the film holds throughout its b-movie atmosphere and not since the superb Jeepers Creepers about a year ago have i seen a film that maintains its b-movieness in such a convincing way. Why is that good? Because it helps you forget this is Hollywood.c) Because most of the characters (except the aliens, sadly) are pretty ok and for the most part humorous.But that's where the candy runs out:1. The aliens come through as dumb as a wall. I wont give away why (for those that havent seen the film) but man, this must be the sorriest alien invasion ever conceived by anybody on film or not. It's a joke to even call it an invasion. It aint even a farce. What it is is a bunch of aliens full of phobias trying to save their skin and get back home to their sofas.2. The gapping holes in the script never let up. They go on from the beggining of it and last through to the very (bad) ending. It becomes worse when one thinks that these scenario lapses were perfectly avoidable. Classic case of ""what was the script writer thinking???"" But, like i said, there wasnt any script writer. I do have the lingering suspicion that Mel wrote the story himself (in which case everything becomes explainable).3. The ending, and particularly, the last 30 seconds of the film classify it as a ""bomb"". You need talent to invent an ending as bad as this. Or you need to be working in Hollywood too long. Even if this film had been a great film (and it had massive potential to be) the ending would've totally destroyed it.

I wanted to enjoy the abundant talents of Mel Gibson and Joachin Phoenix. The special effects looked great on the trailers. It turned out that it wasn't a bad movie but it sure wasn't a good movie, either. I suggest that you might not want to pay movie theatre prices to see this one and that you save it for the video release. The script is pretty awful, very wooden in spots, not like real people talking to each other. The country cop, played with skill by Cherry Jones, is stereotyped with a pathetically folksy script. The military recruiter is a silly characature as is one of the local bad boys in a cut-off leather jacket with a bad hair day happening. A teenaged girl who is worried for her soul because of all her cursing is ridiculous and unnecessary to the film. Be forewarned, multiple use of the word ""douche-bag"" actually passes for humor in this film. Attempting to make the townspeople around Bucks County, PA seem simple turns them into one dimensional people. The plot is so preachy it is obvious and transparent from the moment we learn that Mel's character is a minister who has quit the church and won't spend another minute of his life praying because his wife was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Wonder if Minister Mel will change his thinking by the end of the film? Mel does his best with the limited script and makes his grief as well as his bewilderment in dealing with small children as a single parent very believable and touching. Phoenix is also excellent with the emotional parts of his role and adds a wonderful understated comic aspect to it as well. The two children in the film are cute and endearing and that's about it but that works just fine in this film. Their characters introduce both levity and pathos to the plot. The crop circles or signs look very realistic and are well filmed. The news broadcasts that pepper the film are useful plot movers and are done well.The plot of the movie is very absurd. There is an undercurrent of prescience which is not clearly developed. There are aliens that find it impossible to escape from a wooden pantry closet but who can bust through boarded up doors and windows, roofs and coal cellar chutes with ease. The alien aspect of the movie is so dumb it can't even match up with those sci-fi monster movies of the '50s. The human characters' response to the alien problem is utterly unbelievable as is the government response. The ending is so predictable I think I could have described it lick for lick even if I had left the theatre midway through the film.There are some suspenseful parts achieved with camera angle and sound but for the most part the film left me uninvolved.

And when I finally got ready to watch it, I didn't know what to expect because some of my friends panned it while others raved about it.  When it was over, I found that I had very mixed reactions.On one hand, as one of my friend's is quick to point out, this movie ISN'T ABOUT THE ALIENS.  If you are watching this movie to see a good alien flick, then I think you will be disappointed.  That's not where the script focused its effort.  Rather, the script simply used the aliens as an instrument in the faith journey of Gibson's character.  For, you see, Gibson's character was an Episcopalean priest in town that everyone looked up to.  However, several months BEFORE the crop circles, Gibson stepped back from his position and his faith at the tragic and seemingly senseless death of his beloved wife.  His God allowed split-second timing &amp; eerie coincidences take her away, and he couldn't forgive God or make sense of his belief system any longer.With this perspective in mind, the relative simplicity of the aliens should not come as a surprise.  However, what did come as a surprise to me was the incredible oversimplicity of the ending.  Not to give anything away, but the plot tries to pull together everyone's quirks in a way that are necessary to bring salvation.  It's an event that supposed to show how God is in control and has orchestrated everything all along.  It's a key time in Gibson's faith journey.However, I found this scene flat and stale.  It was too one-dimensional to actually seem like the act of a infinite almighty.  Like with &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, I felt let down by a short-sighted feel-good ending that really leaves you with more questions than assurance.Feeling that this movie failed in delivering on its main thrust and seeing that it really didn't develop the sci-fi material too much, I thought it was a bit of a let down in the end.",3,A Bit of a Let Down,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,2008,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'supposedly', 'great', 'film', 'help', 'prepare', 'one', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'ready', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'friends', 'panned', 'others', 'raved', 'When', 'was', 'found', 'had', 'very', 'mixed', 'reactions.On', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'friend', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'movie', ""N'T"", 'ABOUT', 'THE', 'ALIENS', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'good', 'alien', 'flick', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'where', 'script', 'focused', 'effort', 'Rather', 'script', 'simply', 'used', 'aliens', 'instrument', 'faith', 'journey', 'Gibson', 'character', 'see', 'Gibson', 'character', 'was', 'Episcopalean', 'priest', 'town', 'everyone', 'looked', 'up', 'However', 'several', 'months', 'crop', 'circles', 'Gibson', 'stepped', 'back', 'position', 'faith', 'tragic', 'seemingly', 'senseless', 'death', 'beloved', 'wife', 'God', 'allowed', 'split-second', 'timing', 'amp', 'coincidences', 'take', 'away', 'could', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'God', 'make', 'sense', 'belief', 'system', 'longer.With', 'perspective', 'mind', 'relative', 'simplicity', 'aliens', 'should', 'not', 'come', 'surprise', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'come', 'surprise', 'was', 'incredible', 'oversimplicity', 'ending', 'Not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'plot', 'pull', 'together', 'everyone', 'quirks', 'way', 'are', 'necessary', 'bring', 'salvation', 'event', 'supposed', 'show', 'how', 'God', 'control', 'orchestrated', 'everything', 'along', 'key', 'time', 'Gibson', 'faith', 'journey.However', 'found', 'scene', 'flat', 'stale', 'was', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'actually', 'seem', 'act', 'infinite', 'almighty', 'quot', 'A', 'Prayer', 'Owen', 'Meany', 'quot', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'short-sighted', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'really', 'more', 'questions', 'assurance.Feeling', 'movie', 'failed', 'delivering', 'main', 'thrust', 'seeing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'sci-fi', 'material', 'too', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'end']",Signs
595376,A1MG0XHW2YSI9,B00005JL3T,the enlightened one,"[0, 3]","It comes as no surprise that 'Signs' by M. Night Shyamalan became the fourth highest grossing film of 2002, making this blockbuster the director's most successful project to date.  Favoring the creepy/suspenseful sci-fi genre once again, Shyamalan's previous two hits 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' made 'Signs' one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year.  And just watch the six-part documentary that talks about the movie's marketing for further proof.Shyamalan's third film delves into the question of 'Are aliens really out there?  And how would we know?'  He uses some interesting camera work and absence of background music in several scenes to set the mood for the mystery that is set to unravel itself.  However, there are some parts in the film where he seems to use the same setup way too much.  Another big pitfall in the film is the goofy comic relief that frequently cuts into the story.  Humor is fine and everything, but put it in the wrong places and you have a film that chokes and slows itself down.Let's not also forget the large gaps in logic!  At the end of the film, a television news program reports that the aliens have all fled due to a secret weapon that was discovered by middle-easterners.  The audience is then led to infer that the secret weapon is none only than - water!  Sounds like Shyamalan couldn't think of a proper ending, so he made up something quick to give the film a conclusion.  What I don't understand is how the aliens could have arrived on the planet to begin with, since our atmosphere has humidity in it and therefore is surrounded by water.One last point, the film made itself even worse by actually revealing what the aliens looked like.  It would have been much more suspenseful to have kept the extra-terrestrials hidden or running around briefly rather than to have had the camera fixate on a guy in a rubber alien suit.  The alien's cartoonish appearance was almost.. laughable.What I did enjoy about this film was its scenery and the use of lighting to create a mood.

M. Night Shyamalan's new movie is even worse than the anticlimatic &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000), which was the followup to his smash hit &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999).  Mel Gibson plays an ex-minister who gave up on his faith when his wife was tragically killed in a car accident.  When aliens crash land his home, not only must he act to protect his family, but he's also confronted by some personal inner demons.  The setup is promising, but the execution allows the movie to collapse under its own weight.  The dialogue (particularly among the kids) is cheesy, the film drags at an incredibly slow pace, and the viewer is distracted by M. Night's annoying cameo appearances.  But the biggest kick is when the family, having already been invaded by aliens, take a &quot;vote&quot; to decide whether they should vacate their home.  Vote???  To recycle an old joke, if Black people lived in that house, they would have left town--and fast--at the first sight of an alien.  To be fair, a few creepy moments do pop up, but by then we've already looked at our watches a half-dozen times.

Upon further investigation they discover a pattern of perfectly formed crop circles.  Trying not to overreact, Graham ignores the worldwide media frenzy that extraterrestrial life may be invading earth and has to search deep within himself for a faith that he once had to pull his family through the ordeal.ReviewThe director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable appears to be determined to carve himself a niche.  With each viewing of these three films one becomes aware of the recurring themes of distance &amp; finding oneself and a prominent style of silence &amp; enchantment from this emerging auteur.  Shyamalan, who gives a competent cameo in the film as a veterinarian who 6 months prior to the action of the movie fell asleep at the wheel of his car and ran down Hess' wife, has the potential to be the next Spielberg for the start of the 21st Century.  He writes his own films and manages to continue to deliver stories with a passion and lack of pretension that is rarely seen in the cinema today.The script is simply brilliant as it concerns itself far more with what is not said and rather looks to what is and should be implied.  It is an actors text and is delivered with an unrelenting passion by Gibson who I firmly believe is the modern embodiment of the `everyman' as he never fails to engage and has that rare skill of minimalistic acting that can say so much with so little.  Phoenix is competent throughout and works well as the distant brother who finds the faith that the elder Hess lost after leaving the Church following his wife's death.This is the anti-Independence Day, this is not about tall buildings being blown up or motherships being defeated through the convenient compatibility of an Apple I Mac and an Alien Parallel Port.  In fact, this isn't a lot about Aliens themselves, but rather its more than that: its about remembering who you are and your place in the world, and its importance no matter who you are - essentially its about faith.  The only failing in this film comes in the last ten minutes and is primarily the fault of a poorly edited sequence, where a powerfully emotive scene is cut away from too quickly and returns later with far less impact.The VerdictIf Shyamalan continues along the path he has begun to cut for himself, I have no doubt that his body of work will mature well.  Catch one of best up and coming Hollywood storytellers today so you can tell your kids about him tomorrow.  This is a brilliant film that offers so much on so many levels and sustains a tension throughout without falter or distraction.",4,Can you see the signs?,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2847,"['BriefEverything', 'farmer', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Gibson', 'assumed', 'world', 'when', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Phoenix', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'dogs', 'barking', 'children', 'Bo', 'Breslin', 'brother', 'Morgan', 'Culkin', 'wandering', 'bleary', 'eyed', 'corn', 'fields', 'further', 'investigation', 'discover', 'pattern', 'perfectly', 'formed', 'crop', 'circles', 'Trying', 'not', 'overreact', 'Graham', 'worldwide', 'media', 'frenzy', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'invading', 'earth', 'search', 'deep', 'faith', 'once', 'had', 'pull', 'family', 'ordeal.ReviewThe', 'director', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'be', 'determined', 'carve', 'niche', 'viewing', 'three', 'films', 'one', 'aware', 'recurring', 'themes', 'distance', 'amp', 'finding', 'prominent', 'style', 'silence', 'amp', 'enchantment', 'emerging', 'auteur', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'competent', 'cameo', 'film', 'veterinarian', 'who', '6', 'months', 'prior', 'action', 'movie', 'fell', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'car', 'ran', 'down', 'Hess', 'wife', 'potential', 'be', 'next', 'Spielberg', 'start', '21st', 'Century', 'own', 'films', 'manages', 'continue', 'deliver', 'stories', 'passion', 'lack', 'pretension', 'rarely', 'seen', 'cinema', 'today.The', 'script', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'far', 'more', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'rather', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'implied', 'actors', 'text', 'delivered', 'unrelenting', 'passion', 'Gibson', 'who', 'firmly', 'believe', 'modern', 'embodiment', 'everyman', 'never', 'engage', 'rare', 'skill', 'minimalistic', 'acting', 'can', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'Phoenix', 'competent', 'well', 'distant', 'brother', 'who', 'faith', 'elder', 'Hess', 'lost', 'leaving', 'Church', 'following', 'wife', 'death.This', 'anti-Independence', 'Day', 'not', 'tall', 'buildings', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'motherships', 'being', 'defeated', 'convenient', 'compatibility', 'Apple', 'Mac', 'Alien', 'Parallel', 'Port', 'fact', ""n't"", 'lot', 'Aliens', 'rather', 'more', 'remembering', 'who', 'are', 'place', 'world', 'importance', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'essentially', 'faith', 'only', 'failing', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'primarily', 'fault', 'poorly', 'edited', 'sequence', 'where', 'powerfully', 'emotive', 'scene', 'cut', 'away', 'too', 'quickly', 'returns', 'later', 'far', 'less', 'impact.The', 'VerdictIf', 'Shyamalan', 'path', 'begun', 'cut', 'have', 'doubt', 'body', 'work', 'will', 'mature', 'well', 'Catch', 'one', 'best', 'up', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'storytellers', 'today', 'can', 'tell', 'kids', 'tomorrow', 'brilliant', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'tension', 'falter', 'distraction']",Signs

In fact i hated it. It was just a jumpled mass of stuff was my first opinion. Signs just seemed boring to me. Recently we watched it again and i now think it is different then unbreakable but it truly deserves 5 stars.  the acting is first rate. Gibson is excellent as the almost failed preacher, Pheonix shows what an excellent and IMHO totally underrated actor he is.. I normally hate kids in films like these and on one or two occasions (e.g. Jurassic Park) was actually up for the bad guys to end the horror of them.  These kids are different. They can act and they are extremely funny. In fact there is an incredible amount of humour in this film but is not overbearing. The scene where the child is explaing to gibson about extraterestrials and say the author is perscuted for his beliefs and gibson replies in classic deadpan 'oh, so he is unemployed...' Classic acting, classic direction..

THis is  particularly tragic as it shows a  family that has been devastated already and is verging on completely imploding.if you are looking, a big screen shoot em up, this isnt it. you need to be in a better frame of mind. but if you want a good night in, and a good well paced, taut, well acted film and well directed, that stretches the mind just a small amount...this is the one for you.

In ""Signs,"" he goes too far, such that the world of his story is not fully fleshed out and contains glaring holes.To avoid spoilers, particularly those that give away its non-twist surprise ending (don't expect a ""why didn't I see that before?"" twist as in the other two films), ""Signs"" is about an alien invasion as seen through the eyes of Father Graham Hess, a farmer and former preacher who has lost his faith. The audience sees nothing which Father Hess and his family do not. This focus precludes scenes from such other invasion films as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""Independence Day"": the military response, the scientist's explanation of who the aliens are, what they want, and why they are here, etc. These scenes are not missed, and the imperspicuity helps the suspense. But there is vagueness in what we DO see. While advanced aliens could be susceptible to low-tech attacks, particularly if the higher beings lack brute strength, the aliens are portrayed as under-armed technologically. They seem more like pranking frat boys from outer space than a military invasion. Factual errors are also unexplained: the aliens' ships are said to all be ""within a mile"" of crop circles - yet they are hovering over downtown Mexico City!Worse still is the incompleteness of the characters' world, both factually (er, which religion was Father Hess a reverend in?) and emotionally. Although Mel Gibson turns in one of his best performances, his character's emotional detachment damages the story. He has given up, so the audience has no reason to care until the end of the movie.Alien and UFO enthusiasts will be disappointed. This is a film about higher themes than crop circles and extra-terrestrials.

I do know that it was not as exciting or thrilling as most of his movies.  It needed a little bit more of a punch or depth to it.

They find crop circles in their fields and strange things happen to his dogs and his children.

595401,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JL3T,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","When ""Signs"" is creepy and scary, it is really crepy and scary.  But when it is ridiculous, it is hopelessly ridiculous, and even laughable.  Many people, including me, saw the film with the first view in mind; others, though outnumbered, saw it with the latter, and have their good reasons.  Whichever category you belong to, you just pick it.The actors are all good; Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, who lost his wife in the tragic accident, is a sad, lonely and disillusioned father, growing corn in the quiet countryside.  Joaquin Phoenix is no less effective as one of his family members, but it is the two newcomers Rory Culkin (younger brother of more famous Culkins) and Abigail Breslin (sister of Spencer, who played a kid with Bruce Willis in ""The Kid"") who really steal the show.  The story goes around these four members, who encounter the ""signs"" created on the vast cornfield.  One of the kids believes it has a meaning; the other claims she saw ""it.""  And it won't take a long time for the two adults to be convinced.  But of what?Of what?  This part is the key of this very unique suspence film. so I cannot disclose it.  The only thing I can say is that the director M. Night Shyamalan's atomospheric approaches to create a creepy feelings, which can be found in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" still work, and though ""Signs"" is deeply flawed here and there, the film can scare us not a little.  His hand-made style of filmmaking, clearly based on Hitchcock's thrillers, is done in a ""less is more"" fashion, which is now something rare these days.As James Hewton Howard's score suggests (listen to the opening number, which reminds you of one film starring Melanie Griffith's mother), the film is actually old-fashioned thriller.  But it tries to achieve something more, and then it shows its shortcomings.  The script attempts to be deep in philosophical meanings, but it totally fails.  The last decision doens't require the logics the film shows in its flashbacks, but it is director himself to be blamed.  Not that his directing skill is bad; rather, Shyamalan himself appears in the film, as he did in two previous films, but this time his role is much bigger one, including a dialogue with Mel Gibson.  Hitch was wise not to take his signature cameos too seriously (in fact, he thought it as obligatory task) while Shyamalan goes much further, taking up the role which should have gone to a professional actor.The whole film build up tension tactfully, but it is the skills of the director that propel the whole story.  Many would answer, if asked, that ""it"" would not happen in the way it is described when it should really happen.  If you start to think that way ... and I confess I though a bit that way ... the film may look too ludicurous, and that is the reason for the complaints of some reviewers.  That is quite understandable when you see one homevideo sequence -- what do you think if you watch THAT on TV?  Do you take it seriously?So, let's forget those parts.  Let's not think that so-called mystery circles are nothing but somebody's practical jokes.  ""Signs"" goes smoothly as long as you keep fending off these doubts, and I think you can because of the film's well-measured pace and two cute kids.  Yes, those two child actors are the best thing of the film, which in the most unexpected moment, gives humor to the film.  With them and its eerie atomosphere, the film will be worth your time.",4,"Far From Perfect, But Offers Good Thrills and Humor Too",1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,3434,"['When', 'Signs', 'creepy', 'scary', 'really', 'crepy', 'scary', 'when', 'ridiculous', 'hopelessly', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'laughable', 'Many', 'people', 'including', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'view', 'mind', 'others', 'though', 'outnumbered', 'saw', 'latter', 'have', 'good', 'reasons', 'Whichever', 'category', 'belong', 'just', 'pick', 'it.The', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'tragic', 'accident', 'sad', 'lonely', 'disillusioned', 'father', 'growing', 'corn', 'quiet', 'countryside', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'less', 'effective', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'two', 'newcomers', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'younger', 'brother', 'more', 'famous', 'Culkins', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'sister', 'Spencer', 'who', 'played', 'kid', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Kid', 'who', 'really', 'steal', 'show', 'story', 'four', 'members', 'who', 'encounter', 'signs', 'created', 'vast', 'cornfield', 'One', 'kids', 'meaning', 'other', 'claims', 'saw', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'time', 'two', 'adults', 'be', 'convinced', 'what', 'what', 'part', 'key', 'very', 'unique', 'suspence', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'disclose', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'atomospheric', 'approaches', 'create', 'creepy', 'feelings', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'still', 'work', 'Signs', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'can', 'scare', 'not', 'little', 'hand-made', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'clearly', 'based', 'Hitchcock', 'thrillers', 'done', 'less', 'more', 'fashion', 'now', 'something', 'rare', 'days.As', 'James', 'Hewton', 'Howard', 'score', 'listen', 'opening', 'number', 'one', 'film', 'starring', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'mother', 'film', 'actually', 'old-fashioned', 'thriller', 'achieve', 'something', 'more', 'then', 'shortcomings', 'script', 'attempts', 'be', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'meanings', 'totally', 'last', 'decision', ""doens't"", 'require', 'logics', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'director', 'be', 'blamed', 'Not', 'directing', 'skill', 'bad', 'rather', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'did', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'time', 'role', 'much', 'bigger', 'one', 'including', 'dialogue', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Hitch', 'was', 'wise', 'not', 'take', 'signature', 'cameos', 'too', 'seriously', 'fact', 'thought', 'obligatory', 'task', 'Shyamalan', 'much', 'further', 'taking', 'up', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'professional', 'actor.The', 'whole', 'film', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'tactfully', 'skills', 'director', 'whole', 'story', 'Many', 'would', 'answer', 'asked', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'way', 'described', 'when', 'should', 'really', 'happen', 'start', 'think', 'way', 'confess', 'bit', 'way', 'film', 'may', 'look', 'too', 'ludicurous', 'reason', 'complaints', 'reviewers', 'quite', 'understandable', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'homevideo', 'sequence', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'watch', 'TV', 'Do', 'take', 'seriously', 'So', 'let', 'forget', 'parts', 'Let', 'not', 'think', 'so-called', 'mystery', 'circles', 'are', 'nothing', 'somebody', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Signs', 'smoothly', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'fending', 'off', 'doubts', 'think', 'can', 'film', 'well-measured', 'pace', 'two', 'cute', 'kids', 'Yes', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'most', 'unexpected', 'moment', 'humor', 'film', 'eerie', 'atomosphere', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'time']",Signs

Like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable,a Clif Note version could not adequately summarize or do justice to the story; hard core sci fi and Mel Gibson action adventure fans should be warned that this is neither of those genres,but rather a psychological mystery thriller infused with wonderful periodic comedic relief. Even the true meaning of the title only becomes clear as the movie unfolds.Suffice it to say that the alien markings in his Pennsylvania cornfield are not the most crucial signs in the family life that Mel Gibson is trying to rebuild following the tragic accident that killed his wife and caused him to resign from the ministry and lose his faith. Most of the limited violence and bloodshed is suggestive, but nevertheless psychologically disturbing, especically for younger children.I enjoyed it much more the second time, when the shock value of these scenes had worn off and I could pick up the all the nuances and implications which I had not caught when I first saw it because I was so involved in the action and the story line.

595406,A2ZXCWUWXLVK6I,B00005JL3T,"Vicky ""Vicky""","[1, 1]","SPOILER ALERT!Yes, we know, one of the biggest in-your-face blunders of this movie is that these supremely intelligent aliens with advanced technology and amazing problem solving skills decide to invade a planet that's 80% water when the aliens themselves are... easily killed by water. Yup. Just splash it on their skin and they burn up like vampires being doused with Holy Water. It's also never explained just WHAT the aliens want; to dine on our flesh? Harvest our natural resources? Have a big Earth-themed alien party? All we know is that they invade and start killing people, but we never find out WHY.But seriously, blunders aside... this is one FUN creep-you-out movie! The music, the visuals, the story's pace, the camera shots, all designed to just absolutely give you the ""holy crow, something weird and freaky is happening"" feeling, all the way through the movie. Helping it along is some superb acting by some true Hollywood talent, including Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin, all of whom do an incredible job (the kids are just as fantastic as the adults).The decisions to NOT show the aliens makes them all the more creepy and mysterious. Granted, we do have the final alien encounter at the end, which I found completely UN-creepy and anti-climactic. I wish they'd found another way to conclude the story without that whole scene, which is just tacky and corny. Enjoy the first three-quarters of the movie anyway! The one scene with the news reel playing from the South American children's party where the first alien is glimpsed... that still gives me the heebie jeebies every time! Same with the scene where they're in the car with the baby monitor and pick up the first, faint, strange sounds... is it something alien? Static? Interference? The suspense between ""Listen closer! Find out what it is!"" and ""NO, turn it off, we don't WANT to know what it is!"" is just delightfully tense.So yeah, it's lacking a lot of common sense, but it's still an awesomely creepy story filled with excellent acting. Can't say that about many alien flicks. This one doesn't bank on special effects, guts, lasers, explosions, or chase scenes.

Crop circles mysteriously appear over an individual's town, and as it all develops they don't appear to be caused by humans, and the circles appear to be a prelude of something far more terrifying to come.Mel Gibson plays an excellent and convincing performance for his role.  He plays an ex-pastor who lost faith after his wife died.  Ray Culkin is, understandably, reminiscent of a young Macaulay Culkin in several visible ways, except here he plays a character with a far more depressed and solemn attitude.  Like what Hitchcock did in his films, M. Night Shyamalan plays a comparatively minor character (try to spot him).For the most part the characters have an emotionless, quiet and almost lethargic speaking pattern, which creates a mood and atmosphere similar to what one would see in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" accentuated further by the lighting and occasional music.  Commendably, Shyamalan's methods to evoke frightful suspense are done well psychologically as opposed to inundating us with small bloodbaths, making it a more intelligent movie. The ""signs,"" from which the movie takes its title, are apparently not about the signs of the mysterious forces behind crop circles, but goes beyond that into the fabric of happenings in our daily world and to what it intriguingly suggests.  This principle as a plot element is utilized rather well in some of the closing scenes of the movie.Surprisingly, there are some occasional bits of humor inserted in the movie, though the movie is largely in a spooky suspense genre rather than a hardcore thriller.  The first half of the movie is relatively slow moving, to the extent that one might get almost impatient with the unfolding of the plot.  Near the close of the movie, however, things get quite suspenseful and one becomes eager and uncertain as to how things turn out.  The ending skillfully ties several plot elements together beautifully, and the close of it all is satisfying (though I won't say if it's a happy or sad ending).  All things considered, it is a good movie for those who don't mind these kinds of movies (occasionally slow moving, suspenseful, and the type of atmosphere that permeates the film).

Manoj ""Night"" Shyamalan does wonderfully in his exposition, regardless of what others have let [drop] from gaping mouths.  The story is simple to follow, every scene is masterfully detailed and meticulously shot in the pure tradition of ""mise en scene.""Mel Gibson's performance as a tortured spiritual leader and the ensuing tension in family and everyday life makes for one of the better roles I believe he's ever portrayed.  The dark style that has graced each of Shyamalan's previous films, which we are all familiar with, proves fresh yet again as we are invited to feel the same anxieties as those of the characters in the film, using true human emotion to convey character feelings as opposed to Hollywood glitz.  Those who concentrate on the short, minimalist section of CGI have forgotten, maybe they didn't even notice, that there is a story of human passion, spirituality, trust, fear and hope that precedes.

Clearly Night has tremendous talent as a director. While the characters are well drawn, the performances very good and the central idea interesting, the last act needed some work. Working solo as writer and director Night probably didn't get much input from another creative force. He could have used it with Signs.The McGuffin is the threat of alien invasion. Really, it could have been set at any time during World War II with the Nazi's. It's just the catalyst to drive the plot forward. The alien invasion itself is pretty tame and not very well thought out. The motives for invasion unclear, the reasons they leave also a mystery.The film is visually stunning and visually interesting using a lot of unconventional camera angles and stylistic choices to make the film interesting despite the flawed script. It's what Night doesn't show that frightens us more than seeing everything. It's a classic lesson that's been forgotten by most film directors. Night shows an understanding of suspense not seen since Spielberg's early days. He also avoids the cliches that Spielberg avoided early in his career and has only recently escaped from (for the most part).The DVD is stunning looking with sharp images and beautiful color. The beautiful transfer and resolution is most noticable during the night sequences particularly when Gibson first sees the ""monster outside my window"". The extras are nice with an excerpt (like some of his previous DVD's) from the films Night made as a youth. The multi-angle storyboard option is also nice as well giving us an inside understanding of the film making process.The only suggestion I would have made for improvement would have been to allow viewers to view the preview version vs. the final version. It would have, again, been interesting. Sometimes the preview version is superior to the final film (e.g., Jim Cameron's The Abyss). Overall, this is a fine DVD with a set up that doesn't quite have the eventual payoff it needs to succeed. It's still a riveting film for the first two-thirds of the film. Enjoy and keep your eye on Night as he's a major talent that's still finding his way.",3,"Sign, sign everywhere a sign",1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,2267,"['clever', 'well', 'directed', 'ultimately', 'underwhelming', 'suspense', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'Signs', 'much', 'right', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'wrong', 'Clearly', 'Night', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'director', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'performances', 'very', 'good', 'central', 'idea', 'interesting', 'last', 'act', 'needed', 'work', 'Working', 'solo', 'writer', 'director', 'Night', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'input', 'creative', 'force', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'Signs.The', 'McGuffin', 'threat', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'time', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Nazi', 'just', 'catalyst', 'drive', 'plot', 'forward', 'alien', 'invasion', 'pretty', 'tame', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'motives', 'invasion', 'unclear', 'reasons', 'leave', 'also', 'mystery.The', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'visually', 'interesting', 'using', 'lot', 'unconventional', 'camera', 'angles', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'flawed', 'script', 'what', 'Night', ""n't"", 'show', 'more', 'seeing', 'everything', 'classic', 'lesson', 'been', 'forgotten', 'most', 'film', 'directors', 'Night', 'understanding', 'suspense', 'not', 'seen', 'Spielberg', 'early', 'days', 'also', 'cliches', 'Spielberg', 'avoided', 'early', 'career', 'only', 'recently', 'escaped', 'most', 'part', '.The', 'DVD', 'stunning', 'looking', 'sharp', 'images', 'beautiful', 'color', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'resolution', 'most', 'noticable', 'night', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'when', 'Gibson', 'first', 'monster', 'window', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'excerpt', 'previous', 'DVD', 'films', 'Night', 'made', 'youth', 'multi-angle', 'storyboard', 'option', 'also', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'understanding', 'film', 'making', 'process.The', 'only', 'suggestion', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'improvement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allow', 'viewers', 'view', 'preview', 'version', 'final', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'again', 'been', 'interesting', 'Sometimes', 'preview', 'version', 'superior', 'final', 'film', 'e.g.', 'Jim', 'Cameron', 'Abyss', 'Overall', 'fine', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'eventual', 'payoff', 'succeed', 'still', 'riveting', 'film', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'Enjoy', 'keep', 'eye', 'Night', 'major', 'talent', 'still', 'finding', 'way']",Signs

A minister who has given up the cloth in his despair, he is a near zombie--unsure who or what he is, and barely able to get through his days. His only focus is his children, a young boy and girl who exactly mirror his condition. They never smile, they never use any vocal inflection. In one truly horrifying (and quite unnecessary) scene, they even endure the sudden violent death of their dog with the same eery quiet and lack of affect.This might work, except that in the real world, children do not react to grief as adults do, and instead of coming across as pathetic, they seem inhuman and more than a little weird. Be that as it may, they all live in a lovely farmhouse with Gibson's brother (Joaquim Phoenix), who has come to nurture the family during their time of crisis, and to lend his love and support to his big brother.When a scary series of events, beginning with spooky crop circles in the family's cornfield, threatens to tear apart the family even more, they react with the same strange, stressed silence. We know they are all on their last nerve, but they are so removed from reality that it is hard to react to their growing fear and tension as the worst comes to pass and aliens invade the planet.There are some scary scenes, and the photography certainly adds to the mood of utter despair and ultimate fear. But the whole thing just doesn't jell, and the ending is, to my mind, a major copout. Still, it makes for an interesting couple of hours on a boring Saturday night.

What I saw on-screen bored me to tears. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO END. Shyamalamadingdong is SO OBVIOUSLY trying to ape Spielberg's ridiculously unrealistic and manipulative filmmaking style. The absolute worst scene was when we see Joaquin Phoenix with the children wearing the tinfoil hat for protection. I could have DIED, it was so DREADFUL. It was also with this film that Night thought it interesting to insert himself as a character into his films - a HORRIFIC choice. The man CANNOT even act. For most of this film I shaded my face with my hand in embarrassment that someone would recognize me in the theater watching this GARBAGE. Mel Gibson, whether good or bad, has typecast himself as a 'macho', 'he-man' in most of his films. Here, he plays a COMPLETE AND TOTAL WIMP. I won't rehash the multitude of logical flaws, as there are too many for me to bother with. I HATED THIS FILM. I hated it all the more because The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were so GOOD. This is a crushingly bad film, it is unspeakably bad. I HATED the kid actors. I hated Mel Gibson's character. I HATED Joaquin Phoenix (still do - did you SEE him in ""GLADIATOR""?

And if you think about it this whole movie is filmed and thought out in a way that only adds to the tension.The tension created by this movie is unlike any I've seen in recent memory, and could give Hitchcock a run for his money.Cinematography, Plot and direction aside I would be blind if I didn't point out the Oscar-worthy performances of Mel Gibson and Joquain Phoenix.

He enjoys a calm life, until the crop circles show up.  The huge patterns carved into Graham's crops seem even odder when thousands of others turn up all over the world over night. Even more startling are the strange lights that appear in the night sky over Mexico City. The faith of Graham and everyone involved is tested as the world and their lives change around them.  The director (who lives up to all the `next Spielberg' hype that surrounds him) uses many techniques to evoke fear in his audience. What works the most is the personal level he establishes. Whereas most alien invasion flicks use high-tech weaponry and government forces to evoke extra-terrestrial thrills, `Signs' shows what might happen to ordinary people, should aliens invade. The result is both realistic and affecting.  `People break down into two groups,' Graham claims. `those who see signs and miracles, and those who believe we just get lucky. What you have to ask yourself is which kind of person are you. And is it possible that there are no coincidences?' Tough choice. And every person who sees this movie will ponder that question because the movie forces them to. And, for once, they will have time to think. As previously stated, this movie emphasizes character over action. In fact, halfway through the movie there is a 5-minute long scene that consists merely of the two main characters having a discussion. There is no background music, no diverting visuals - just two people talking. It is one of the most well written and acted scenes of the year.  Don't get me wrong though. No matter how philosophical the movie may be, it has more than it's share of thrills. Taking a cue from Hitchcock himself, Shymalan truly ""plays the audience like a drum."" I have seen audience members scream, cry, and all but wet themselves in fear during this movie.",4,The best movie of 2002,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,2668,"['Signs', 'movie', 'so', 'multi-faceted', 'near', 'impossible', 'sum', 'up', 'single', 'review', 'movie', 'terrifying', 'hilarious', 'inspirational', 'moving', 'thrilling', 'very', 'rewarding', 'Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'grain', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'character', 'action', 'suspense', 'violence', 'result', 'chilling', 'effective', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'finest', 'movie', 'year', 'Graham', 'Hess', 'Mel', 'Gibson', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'called', 'father', 'anymore', 'stint', 'reverend', 'ended', 'six', 'months', 'earlier', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'caused', 'lose', 'faith', 'now', 'small', 'farm', 'Pennsylvania', 'brother', 'Merrill', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'movie', 'best', 'performance', 'two', 'children', 'Morgan', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Bo', 'adorable', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'calm', 'life', 'crop', 'circles', 'show', 'up', 'huge', 'patterns', 'carved', 'Graham', 'crops', 'seem', 'even', 'odder', 'when', 'thousands', 'others', 'turn', 'up', 'world', 'night', 'Even', 'more', 'startling', 'are', 'strange', 'lights', 'appear', 'night', 'sky', 'Mexico', 'City', 'faith', 'Graham', 'everyone', 'involved', 'tested', 'world', 'lives', 'change', 'director', 'who', 'up', 'next', 'Spielberg', 'hype', 'many', 'techniques', 'evoke', 'fear', 'audience', 'What', 'most', 'personal', 'level', 'Whereas', 'most', 'alien', 'invasion', 'flicks', 'use', 'high-tech', 'weaponry', 'government', 'forces', 'evoke', 'extra-terrestrial', 'thrills', 'Signs', 'shows', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'ordinary', 'people', 'should', 'aliens', 'invade', 'result', 'realistic', 'affecting', 'People', 'break', 'down', 'two', 'groups', 'Graham', 'claims', 'who', 'see', 'signs', 'miracles', 'who', 'believe', 'just', 'get', 'lucky', 'What', 'have', 'ask', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'possible', 'are', 'coincidences', 'Tough', 'choice', 'person', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'ponder', 'question', 'movie', 'once', 'will', 'have', 'time', 'think', 'previously', 'stated', 'movie', 'character', 'action', 'fact', 'halfway', 'movie', '5-minute', 'long', 'scene', 'merely', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'having', 'discussion', 'background', 'music', 'diverting', 'visuals', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'talking', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'scenes', 'year', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'matter', 'how', 'philosophical', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'share', 'thrills', 'Taking', 'cue', 'Hitchcock', 'Shymalan', 'truly', 'audience', 'drum', 'have', 'seen', 'audience', 'members', 'scream', 'cry', 'wet', 'fear', 'movie']",Signs

Some of the scenes in Signs are the funniest I have seen on film in years, especially the scenes with the tin foil hats.Signs also can be quite creepy. There are corn field scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. There is also a subtle scene with a trapped alien that, while not scary in a conventional way, is sure to have your heart pounding.This is also not a hardcore sci-fi film, so do not shy away from it for that reason. Signs is story and character driven. There are touching scenes involving Mel Gibson's dying wife, and well as well played out scenes with the sheriff.The acting is quirky, but the characters are highly lovable and memorable. This is something that can't be said often for a film.Signs is not a conventional cookie cutter Hollywood movie, and that is good is you are searching for something quality, yeat slightly off alignment. Some people hate Signs, and some passionately love it. I love it, and own it.Either way, Signs is a definate must see.I have watched Signs at least 5 times, and still laugh, cry and jump even when I know what is coming.

595426,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JL3T,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" (2002) is about a disillusioned minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in the neighboring cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former.This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the ""father of lies"".There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called ""the prince of the power of the air"" in the bible). The primitive method of harming the aliens is discovered in the Middle East and is holy water. The daughter was said to be a ""gift from God"" who was sensitive to impure water. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God to speak to him. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the ""aliens"" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.***END SPOILER***There are many other clues, but I don't want to spoil the fun of finding them for yourself.I'm not saying that this is the only interpretation of the film, but rather than it's a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.I should add that I don't feel ""Signs"" is a great movie despite being impressed with its hidden meaning and potent themes. I give it a solid grade mostly for these reasons but, honestly, I don't find the film all that compelling. While watching it, I don't feel much for Gibson's struggle and grief; better writing would've made me feel for his situation, like Ted Danson in ""Loch Ness"". Also, the story plays out in a generally boring manner, the characters don't really trip my trigger and I was never seriously creeped-out by the creatures. At the same time, the movie's not bad and I especially like the reverent ambiance, which most of Shyamalan's films possess.BOTTOM LINE: This is a cool Shyamalan film and is about on par with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" (and, yes, I realize a lot of people despise the latter, but I'm not one of them).The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.GRADE: B",4,Is it really about aliens?,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,4257,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Signs', '2002', 'disillusioned', 'minister', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'country', 'son', 'daughter', 'brother', 'Juaquin', 'Phoenix', 'reasons', 'disillusionment', 'become', 'clear', 'story', 'unfolds', 'When', 'mysterious', 'crop', 'circle', 'discovered', 'neighboring', 'cornfield', 'wonder', 'prank', 'alien', 'invasion', 'plot', 'deals', 'possible', 'alien', 'invasion', 'theme', 'faith', 'are', 'two', 'general', 'views', 'life', '1', 'life', 'universe', 'are', 'one', 'big', 'meaningless', 'accident', ""'re"", 'just', 'insignificant', 'bug', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'squashed', 'existence', 'memory', '2', 'intelligent', 'design', 'universe', 'somehow', 'fallen', 'i.e', 'severely', 'messed', 'up', 'IS', 'meaning', 'love', 'hope', 'purpose', 'even', 'are', 'presently', 'unable', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'it.The', 'film', 'clash', 'two', 'opposing', 'views', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'conflict', 'two', 'positions', 'OWN', 'hearts', 'clash', 'flesh', 'id', 'spirit', 'super-ego', 'one', 'hand', 'WANT', 'believe', 'latter', 'position', 'life', 'dishes', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'crap', 'are', 'seriously', 'tempted', 'give', 'former.This', 'struggle', 'Gibson', 'character', 'story', 'given', 'up', 'God', 'stumbling', 'dark', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'exist', 'smile', 'mostly', 'facade.Many', 'people', 'diss', 'film', 'obvious', 'plot', 'hole', 'regarding', 'alien', 'weakness', 'Shyamalan', 'too', 'talented', 'not', 'realize', 'sign', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'possible', 'aliens', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'extraterrestrials', 'rather', 'demons', 'underworld', 'dark', 'dimension', 'invading', 'physical', 'realm', 'take', 'many', 'victims', 'can', 'idea', 'are', 'aliens', 'just', 'mass', 'deception', 'remember', 'devil', 'father', 'lies', 'are', 'many', 'clues', 'spaceships', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'just', 'lights', 'sky', 'devil', 'also', 'called', 'prince', 'power', 'air', 'bible', 'primitive', 'method', 'harming', 'aliens', 'discovered', 'Middle', 'East', 'holy', 'water', 'daughter', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'gift', 'God', 'who', 'was', 'sensitive', 'impure', 'water', 'dog', 'bird', 'were', 'clearly', 'possessed', 'crop', 'circles', 'are', 'occultic', 'symbols', 'possible', 'portals', 'underworld', 'When', 'disillusioned', 'minister', 'cries', 'out', 'God', 'actually', 'faith', 'believe', 'God', 'speak', 'precise', 'moment', 'son', 'recovers', 'asthma', 'attack', 'news', 'announcer', 'aliens', 'are', 'retreating', 'see', 'FAITH', 'enemy', 'fleeing', 'tails', 'legs.Also', 'see', 'evidence', 'demons', 'are', 'personal', 'nature', 'alien', 'locked', 'vet', 'pantry', 'was', 'linked', 'guilt', 'disillusionment', 'haunted', 'vet', 'minister', 'death', 'latter', 'wife', '***END', 'SPOILER***There', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'clues', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'fun', 'finding', 'yourself.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'only', 'interpretation', 'film', 'rather', 'legitimate', 'way', 'viewing', 'material', 'together', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'have', 'believe', 'God', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'case.I', 'should', 'add', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Signs', 'great', 'movie', 'being', 'impressed', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'potent', 'themes', 'give', 'solid', 'grade', 'mostly', 'reasons', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'compelling', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'Gibson', 'struggle', 'grief', 'better', 'writing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'feel', 'situation', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Also', 'story', 'out', 'generally', 'boring', 'manner', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'trip', 'trigger', 'was', 'never', 'seriously', 'creeped-out', 'creatures', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'especially', 'reverent', 'ambiance', 'most', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'possess.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'cool', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'about', 'par', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Village', 'yes', 'realize', 'lot', 'people', 'despise', 'latter', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', '.The', 'film', '106', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Eastern', 'Pennsylvania.GRADE', 'B']",Signs
595427,A3I92PEEL1B62O,B00005JL3T,"wysewomon ""wysewomon""","[5, 6]","M. Night Shaymalan is a director who seems less interested in coherent plot and logic of storyline than he is in strings of details:  interesting and sometimes bizarre events that, when looked at from a different point of view, tell a very different story than the one you think you've been seeing.  When this works, as in _The Sixth Sense_, it is incredibly moving and disturbing, and makes you question your own closely held notions of reality.  When it doesn't work, as in _Signs_, it comes across as pretentious and self-aggrandizing, a way of saying, ""Hey look at me, ain't I profound.""In _Signs_, Mel Gibson plays a former priest (Anglican, I'm assuming, tho' this was never made clear) who has lost his faith and left the church six months before on the sudden death of his wife. AS the movie opens, he and his family discover a giant crop circle in their cornfield.  Soon enough they discover that similar circles have sprung up overnight all over the world and that they are the markers for an alien invasion fleet. With aliens landing very near all the crop circles, it becomes up to Mel to save his family.There are actually a lot of good things about _Signs_.  All the performances are quite good, played with just enough realism. The style of the film is appropriate to the subject, with lots of spooky long shots and odd camera angles. The significant details do add up in a significant way, which in itself is hard to do.  And the storyline, though not incredibly original, is one of those that has become a kind of modern mythology, and is treated as such.However, I had numerous problems with this film.  The first and most overwhelming is that the ending is so incredibly obvious, given Mel Gibson's character.  I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as I knew he'd been a priest.  So the movie becomes more about a man's crisis of faith and the alien invasion seems a really dijointed vehicle to get the point across.  The theme and the plot didn't go together in my eye.  I kept asking myself, ""Why did it have to be aliens?"" and I couldn't come up with a good answer.Lots of details are missing from the story, and as they added up, it really began to bother me.  Things like, how did a full time Anglican Priest have time to also be a full time corn farmer? And why didn't he ever seem to be farming?

There seem to be a lot of folks who feel betrayed at it not being a horror film although I remember the trailers and that was never implied. Some have disliked the pace which is slow and deliberate. Still the film had me in the first few minutes.It is refreshing to see a lack of gore and violence. It is good to see implied threat rather than being bashed over the head with direct images. Not everything needs to be literal. While watching Signs I completely forgot about time. It is a simple film that contrasts the metaphor of signs within the context of the story line and theme of faith.The look of the film, the inherent beauty of the scenes and sets made for excellent atmosphere.Signs did well in the theaters and stayed popular for a substantial time. It seems large audiences want to see films in this nature, and this comes from a person that usually prefers so-called 'art' films.Based on some of the scathing comments I would not have bothered to view Signs.

595430,A2GR3LJ5HEYY1M,B00005JL3T,xyz,"[1, 1]","The movie offers some chilling psychological scares and excellent photography; but the buildup of the whole story appears to almost too manipulatively purposefully orbit around the &iexcl;twist.&iexcl; Many say the movie feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode, and I would not fervently disagree.The main theme of the movie deals with &iexcl;faith.&iexcl; Most reviewers say the movie focuses on the VALUE of faith: keeping faith pays, as is the case in the movie&iexcl;s climatic encounter between Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character and the alien. But whether or not it&iexcl;s the filmmakers&iexcl; intention, I feel the movie is actually more about the MEANING of faith.Warning: plot spoiler follows.To me, it&iexcl;s amazing how Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character could relate the means to defeat the alien to what her wife had told him before she died. The way he did it is reminiscent of how some people (quite ridiculously) claim that the novel &iexcl;Moby Dick&iexcl; could predict human history. Many try to interpret the happening of what appears to be just an ordinary event easily explainable by plain common sense (or due to pure coincidence) as a &iexcl;profound&iexcl; prediction of the &iexcl;supposed&iexcl; prophets. Such practice borders on &iexcl;superstition.&iexcl; But contemporarily people prefer to call it &iexcl;faith.&iexcl;There&iexcl;s of course another, much more meaningful, form of &iexcl;faith,&iexcl; which is about resilience and preservation. However, the &iexcl;faith&iexcl; emphasized in the movie belongs to the first kind.The message I get from the movie is that &iexcl;faith&iexcl; is deeply planted in the mind of a person. He might from time to time consciously question the intensity of his &iexcl;faith&iexcl; (just like Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character does in most of the movie). But during times of crisis (the alien encounter), his &iexcl;faith&iexcl; will always surface again and dictate how this person interprets what&iexcl;s happening around him (like how Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character interprets the alien encounter as pre-arranged and as predicted by his wife). A &iexcl;faithful&iexcl; person would go a great length to contrive a perception of significant meanings underlying an event (like how Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character relates how he defeats the alien to the words mumbled by his dying wife in a rather far-fetched manner.) In this sense, to me, the movie speaks against &iexcl;faith,&iexcl; highlighting how tyrannical it could be and how it could distort a person&iexcl;s perspectives.I&iexcl;m not sure what message the director really wants to bring across. But if it&iexcl;s the director&iexcl;s intention to use the final twist to show how the movie&iexcl;s characters benefit from keeping faith, I would feel the movie is too judgmental and the &iexcl;twist&iexcl; too abrupt and blunt. Also, in that case, the director would be just a real-life example of Mel Gibson&iexcl;s character: Contriving to give the movie (an event) some meaning that he stubbornly believes is central to movie-making (life). Here, the &iexcl;meaning&iexcl; in question is the audience&iexcl;s surprise by the final &iexcl;twist.&iexcl; But when you walk out of the theatre, you might not be able to suppress your own silent protest against the movie: a good movie should ultimately not only be about a &iexcl;twist.&iexcl; Building everything, however grandly and meticulously, around it feels like one devoting the whole life preparing his own burial ceremony.

It was paced, the cinematography was excellent and the movie score led you along and like the Erie score in Sixth Sense, never let you go. M. Night is becoming a guru in the field of how he lets the characters show how the movie is progressing; thru their facial expressions, you see in their eyes, what they are seeing in front, to the side, and to their backs. Thus making it even more spooky for the audience.  I am not fond of movies that go bump in the night, boo, type of thing as in (Resident Evil ). M. Night stopped way short of that, giving you a bump or I should say a jolt and it was like, ""Yeah I'm ready to leave!""M. Night is also in the movie. He has been in a few of his other movies, earning him the labels of a 'Hitchcokian' type Director and his movies do have a flavoring of feelings from Hitchcock.All the actors were superb, Mel as (Father Graham Hess) 'We Were Soldiers,' 'The Patriot,' 'Ransom.' Who gave up his belief in an all mighty being after loosing his wife in a freaky, horrific accident.  This accident is a pivotal point in Hess's thinking  as is the last words of his wife . Mels' expressions as all of  the others , were nothing short of perfection, but, after saying that I must say Joaquin Phoenix ,( Uncle Merrill) Clay Pidions , Gladiator, Buffalo Soldiers, does an incredible job  with his facials  and  those of the two children are not to be believed. Joaquin Phoenix is going a long way in filmdom. He is great!Rory Culkin , Morgan Hess, who did a great job in 'You Can Count On Me ,' does an even greater job in this flick. The scene of Morgan and his sister sitting on the couch, with their heads wrapped in tin foil so the Aliens could not read their minds is very funny. There are plenty of laughs in the first part of the movie, so hold onto them as it gets a lot more tense toward the end. Abigail Breslin plays the youngest of the Hess family (BO) and seems to have a water fixation, and is sort of annoying to her father.  But she is immune to  her critics .She has water glasses all over the house, and when asked by her father what is wrong with each glass, she can recite what is wrong with each one.Almost forgot Cherry Jones, Perfect Storm, Erin Brockovich, plays the sheriff who investigates the crop circles on Hess's farm and she is a very good actress.

Night Shyamalan was in the prime of his ""pull the wool over our eyes"" type of films.  It sure shows in this gem of a film dealing with both aliens and the question of ""fate vs. coincidence"".For a basic plot summary, ""Signs"" sees Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Caulkin), and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) suddenly dealing with an alien presence, begun by a strange crop circle on the nearby property.  This comes on he heels of the death of the mother of the family, so the remaining family members struggle to deal with this new test.What makes this movie so great is that, short of ""Sixth Sense"", it is the best ""trick ending"" of any M. Night film.  I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it for you, but suffice it to say that your jaw will be on the floor (provided you are ""going in blind"", of course, without any prior knowledge).  The ending even fits in with the context of the overall film, which is an area in which it surpasses later works such as ""The Village"" & ""Lady In The Water"".The acting is also terrific, with Gibson giving a poignant performance as the faithless former preacher.  Phoenix and the children characters provide some much-needed comic relief in such a dark (and sometimes emotionally dreary) film.  As usual, one of M. Night's most underrated directorial talents shines through: the ability to change the mood of a piece on a dime, perfectly blending satire with mystery/adventure without either getting stale.Overall, ""Signs"" is a wonderful movie if you are a fan of mysteries or sci-fi tales.  It even has the ""human touch"" to vault it into all-time favorite status.  Incredibly, after fooling us already with ""Sixth Sense"", M. Night turns around a scant few years later and turns the exact same trick.  Remarkable.",5,M.

To further confuse matters the news claims the same thing is happening all around the world. Graham is also perplexed by his daughter's sudden habit of leaving half-drunken glasses of water around the house and their dogs violent behavior.Though the true question of this movie is not whether it is a hoaxe or not, but that there a two groups of people.
