Anyway season four was an amazing, inspiring, and gutsy season. Kelly and Brenda's friendship was still strained, Andrea became pregnant and got married, and Donna was still a virgin and David couldn't accept it. A lot of reviewers say they hated Brenda but she was probably the most interesting character on the show, this would be Shannen Doherty's last season. This is the best and polished season of the college years so with that being said, I highly recommend it!",5,The college years.,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,642,"['Beverly', '90210', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'year', 'when', 'gang', 'started', 'college', 'together', 'hey', 'what', 'odds', 'friends', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'attending', 'same', 'college', 'Anyway', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'amazing', 'inspiring', 'gutsy', 'season', 'Kelly', 'Brenda', 'friendship', 'was', 'still', 'strained', 'Andrea', 'became', 'pregnant', 'got', 'married', 'Donna', 'was', 'still', 'virgin', 'David', 'could', ""n't"", 'accept', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'say', 'hated', 'Brenda', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'last', 'season', 'best', 'polished', 'season', 'college', 'years', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'highly', 'recommend']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 4"
1136689,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0012EM5DI,Austin Somlo,"[1, 3]","The fourth season of Beverly Hills 90210 is the most dramatic yet for the series. Also, I love the fact that the makers have fixed three running problems of the show. One, they stopped making the cast to be so egocentric everywhere it goes to, especially in high school. Making a transition to college environment and allowing the characters to go more or less in separate ways were the best things that ever happened. The less egocentric the show became, the much improved the storylines have been. Two, the series is no longer too white as the makers have started to add more racial colors to the mix, and it has been a better change. Three, in the past, characters have showed up and then dropped out like flies. But in season four, the new and old characters actually have stayed longer and surprisingly made a few cameos. I should add one more delight of the show: season four is the final one for Shannen Dougherty. What a huge relief! I am so sick and tired of her character as she stupidly makes mistakes after mistakes and never grows up. Her holier-than-thou attitude is so annoying and incredibly childish. I am glad the next six seasons will be Brenda Walsh free. As for the rest of the characters, I really thought everybody has matured greatly. However, I must say that intelligence is very sorely lacking among the characters. Out of any, Dylan McKay is probably the biggest idiot (or should I say pseudo-intellectual?) The scam, as revealed in the season ending episode, was so obviously seen in miles coming, and seeing Jim Walsh do his homework on the possible finance backing of Kevin's environment project is appallingly bad and amateurish. That kind of thing never is done this quickly. Worse than that, as we know that anybody can obtain a fake identity along with social security numbers, I am surprised that the way how Suzanne's criminal background check was conducted. Just simply take her fingerprints and run them. No professional scam artist will pull any con job so perfectly without having to serve some time. There must be a record. Also, while we are at it, why not take a DNA sample of the daughter? I mean, Dylan has money; otherwise, he would have left everything to her in his last will and testament. Meanwhile, of any characters, I thought Andrea's was the most dramatic and heartfelt, especially at the end with her pre-maturely born baby. I liked the fact that the makers decided her boyfriend-turned-husband to be Hispanic. That spoke volumes to the change of the show. David's drug addition was also dramatic and very interesting because maintaining celibacy with Donna actually drove him to that point. He did the right thing by allowing his relationship to be ended this way; it's just nearly impossible to sustain it while everybody is at the prime of their lives. Donna is unquestionably the nicest person of any, and I've always been surprised that nobody figured her as an animal lover before season four. Steve Sanders is easily the best character of the show, and he shows the best of his traits. He is the most fun to watch during season four, and his war with the great John Sears has been amazing. That really allowed the drama of the series to evolve in new ways like never before. Finally, Brandon Walsh the everlastingly hypocrite...he sure really solidified his position supremely well. He couldn't have chosen a more perfect profession for himself than politics. It is just so...him. Recall that during the episode, he was dating Lucinda Nicholson, and he finds out that she was married. He actually...went along with it before he found out that she was his professor's wife after all. But...he was very willing to carry on an adulterous affair with her if he didn't know who the husband was. Throughout the season, he acts like he is a Mr. Good Shoes with a moral conscience...I say, ""Baaaaaa."" Give me a break. I am surprised the most at Josh Richland for failing to uncover the fact that Brandon was a convicted drunk driver. That would have been very damaging. Speaking of politics, how in the world that Brandon Walsh is qualified to be picked for the Educational Task Force? Really...Brandon Walsh with no experience in this kind of matter? The Brandon Walsh who doesn't really spend any time when it comes to amelioration of student education? And Brandon Walsh out of 30,000 or so students? You have to be kidding me, that's just equally manipulative as it is to say that Brenda Walsh got away with everything with no punishment. Speaking of manipulation, how about that piece of job on Laura Kingman? That was the single worst piece of handling by the creators of the entire show so far. She was practically normal to me. Tell me, how would you really feel if you were greatly interested in a guy and then find out in the end that he was just using you and also had a girlfriend in the entire time? And tell me, how would you really feel if you gave the performance of a lifetime trying to get the lead part in a play after so much hard work and knew that the part was essentially yours yet to find out in the end that Brenda Walsh, who 100% choked in the final audition, just basically unfairly grabbed it (in real life, I know that the only way she could possibly win it was by sleeping with the director; please don't insult my intelligence either) by getting another chance via coming over to his house at night? Why wasn't there another chance for Laura (and PLEASE! Kelly has absolutely zero ability as an actress; that's why the whole thing was a sham) to make the competition more fair? And watching the way that she got treated in front of everybody else after being fired by Roy Randolph was the most unfair I've seen. I thought her feelings the entire time were perfectly normal, even at times where her frame of mind is a bit out of ordinary. She lost it in the end because the way things have been going have shocked her enough for her to harbor traumatic feelings. Anyway, of all episodes of season four, I thought ""And Did It My Way"" was the best. As usual, the writers of Beverly Hills 90210 did an excellent job of covering so many diverse topics and made the show much interesting to watch. I haven't mentioned Kelly Taylor yet, and she has really grown up after three season and matured. Her relationship with Dylan is interesting to observe; it is much more mature and sensible, almost like the real thing as compared with other TV-based relationships. I liked the specials of season four: The Loves of Season 4 (What happened to that New York girl?) and A Look Back with Charles Rosin. All in all, season four of Beverly Hills 90210 is easily the best yet.",5,The Most Dramatic Yet.,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,6645,"['fourth', 'season', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'most',

I was like, ""WHAT?"" Well then what the hell did the last 4 years mean to you? Brenda stood up for him in Season 2 when that gold digging bimbo was after him and called herself his friend.

This the best Season of this teen-friendly soapy drama because all the eps seemed much more grittier and realer. And the cast all seemed more confident and sure of themselves, because, by now ""90210"" was a huge worldwide hit!Here's thetentative coverof this set! This will be an 8-disc set with a total of 31 original eps!This is the Season 4 Cast of ""90210"" (listed in order of importance:)Brenda Walsh (played by the Original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty) - The StarBrandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) - main cast, 2nd biggest starDylan McKay (Luke Perry) - main cast, ""breakout"" starKelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) - main castDonna Martin (Tori Spelling) - main castSteve Sanders (Ian Ziering) - main castDavid Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) - main castAndrea Zuckerman Vasquez (Gabrielle Carteris) - main castNat Bussichio (Joe E.

Espinoza) - supporting, not on entire season or in every epIn this Season I really started to appreciate Andrea. In prior Seasons, she was such a nagging pain-in-the-@ss (not unlikeMelrose'sAlison.) But in Season 4 her character changed dramatically. Andrea moved out on her own (in the CU dorm) and started dating, and by the end of the Season she was a married mother with a hubby and a baby!For some reason the character of Brandon also changed a lot during Season 4. He was no longer the sweetie-pie boy-next-door. Brandon seemed somewhat arrogant. Maybe he was upset about still living at home? And, did you notice how in the very beginning of Season 4 his character almost seemed like the odd man out? All the other kids all seemed to have something going on (Steve and the Keg-house, Donna-David and Kelly in their new beach apartment, Bren with her new job, Andrea with her new romance and as usual Dylan was just trying to make it through the night.) But Brandon didn't really have much to say or do. Anywho, I didn't like him as much. Although, Bran was still (by far,) my favorite guy of this super-trendy Zip.I also enjoyed Season 4 because of Brenda. Dylan was the ""breakout"" star, but Brenda was the fan-favorite because Bren wasn't afraid to show her true feelings or let it all hang out, so to speak. Did you notice how some storylines even mirrored Shannon 's personal life (quickie marriage, nude controversy and getting arrested and the possibility of going to prison.) A very wise person once said that there are no coincidences. And, I tend to agree.These are the Season 4 eps:So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, GoodbyeThe gang throws Bren a going-away party.The Girl From New York CityBrenda can't deal with her over-sexed roommate, Darla (Wendy Benson-Landes.)The Little FishBren and Dylan go fishing and Bren decides what to do with her life next, now that she's a ""drop-out!""Greek to MeAndrea encounters some antisemitism when she pledges the Alpha Omega sorority.

Note: in syndication this ep airs in 2-parts as it was a 2-hour show.(Skip this if you don't like reading cryptic text.) As of today the p r*ce of this set is 41. 19. So far, this is the c *eapest set of ""90210."" If you're interested in getting it, I would p *ace my order now. A m@zon has a history of structuring their p r*ces in a really odd way; the p r*ces go up and down, not unlike a pure transient hotel rate. (TV Shows on DVD currently has the A m@zon pr*ce listed for this set as 38. 99, so I'm assuming that it has changed at least once over the past month, already!) By the way, I wouldn't be surprised if eventually A m@zon pulls this paged down as they also have a history of putting up pre-order pages way before the items go on sale only to yank the pages down a couple of weeks later. WTF! What's up with that??As you know, this was also the final season for Shannen. I really hated to see Bren go, and as Donna said to her in the Season 4 finale, between sobs, ""you're my best friend."" Brenda always added a touch of realism and maybe even a bit of narcissism to the Walsh Home. But alas, poor Shannen left. Season 5 of ""90210"" was nowhere near as interesting or welcoming as Season 4 always was. Maybe because I was never crazy about that little hog, Valerie (""Saved by the Bell"" butterball, Tiffani Thiessen, FKA Tiffani Amber Thiessen.) She was no Brenda. I also wasn't crazy about Kathleen Robertson. Fox took Shannen's salary and divided it among these two and still had (a lot of) money left over!There has never been another TV show that was able to speak directly to the teen audience as ""90210"" always did!Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break onFather Murphy, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that isLittle House on the Prairie. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in theLittle House TV movieseven after the series was canceled!In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,Girls Just Want to Have Fun. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other thanHeathers!In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titledClass Beverly HillsA year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called90210. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;Melrose Place! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",5,All About Shannen,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,15338,"['Season', '4', 'favorite', 'Season', '90210', 'best', 'Season',

In Strangers In The Night, Andrea finally loses her virginity which becomes an interesting story line and I love Twenty Years Ago Today when Brenda's new love interest proposes to her and she accepts.  Also later in the season we see David begin to use drugs and watch the problems that ensue as a result.

Up until this point, they'd had a mild flirtation, but were mostly friends (the prom kiss in Season One is my favorite moment between the first and third seasons).  Towards the end of the fourth season, Brandon and Kelly find their spark at the retreat, and a new, short-lived triangle of Brandon/Kelly/Dylan emerges.  And the love between Brandon and Kelly is born.While the music to the show will undoubtedly be changed, at least to some degree, as have the past seasons, that is a minor issue.  I rated this season as a four star.  It would have gotten five, but once again, it was chalk full of Brenda drama.  I can not stand Brenda.  Never could.  Perhaps I should have rated it with four a half stars since this is her last season.

Brandon gets involved in campus politics and begins an illicit affair with a 26-year-old anthropology professor. Brenda almost elopes in Las Vegas with a guy she barely knows, and eventually seeks solace in the theatre. Kelly is constantly frustrated by her relationship with Dylan, who loves playing the role of big brother to his newly-discovered eight-year-old sister. Donna and David's relationship hits some major bumps in the road, especially when David becomes addicted to drugs. Steve pledges a fraternity and winds up in all sorts of trouble, and Andrea shocks everyone by getting knocked up and married all in one season.

1136702,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B0012EM5DI,W. freeman,"[2, 4]","Yes i'm a guilty watcher of 90210, thought to be all about the glam and glitz of living life in Beverly Hills. Well thats true to a very small extent. I just turned 34 so when the show came on in 1990 i was 15 and a sophomore in high schoo, so it really fit the bill for me. Well after watching the show for year upon year, the show became touch and go when they finally graduated, so i caught it when i could, and saw lots of episodes through the late 90's. Actually some of my favorite episodes came in the later seasons, when Valerie (Tiffani Theisenn) came into the picture, spicing things up a bit with a new kind of Vixen character. Here are some things i like(d) and dislike(d) about the main characters, sorry i'm not going season by season it would take forever.Dylan-Luke Perry would have to be my favorite simply because he's the rebel who doesnt show much emotion, but is still an all around cool guy, and gives the show the much needed James Dean kind of edge. His battles with being car jacked, his father dying, being rich, and always seeming to find trouble made the show not your everyday teeny bopper high school tv series. To bad he left after the sixth season.Kelly-I like Kelly simply because she was always thought to be a bit trampish but isnt, she's really the nicest down to earth girl on the show(and in real life). Also yes she's hot even to this day pushing 40 years old. She also added ""good"" drama to the show by not really letting anything stop her and always maintained a head strong attitude.David- David is probably the least talented actor of the series, but he gives it kind of a boyish innocents and even in the later college years has all the temptation that he had in high school, just on a different level. Some of my favorite episodes are with him in this season are his battle with drugs, actually its the best he did probably in all the seasons that he's in.Andrea-Enh, the Jewish girl from the poor part of town, i never really cared for her character because she's always to critical of every single little detail of life, also her poor me, and anti-semitism really gets old throughout. Also much like Brandon her goals for perfection wane on you a bit throughout the years of the show.Steve-The good ole, big man(jock styled) guy on campus. Steve never seemed to have a steady girlfriend(except Celeste) but always had good intentions, sometimes thanks to his good buddy Brandon. Also he was always picked on and never really given a lot of credit, or a lot of episodes that really focused on just him. Very likable guy.Donna-Don't get me started on Tori Spelling, lets put it this way, she never really made it on the show, just there as the other peoples friends and davids gf. To goofy for my taste and she really didnt bring anything to the table except that guys during the years mistreated her. So being the producers daughter didnt help, hense why she is still on the series today i'm sure.Jim and Cindy-Ennh they have there moments as parents, but anything in the show that revolves around them seems to Seventh Heavenish for me. Thats where a lot of the shows like that, Felicity, and Dawsons Creek stemmed from, the good ole Walshes. As parents they were ok, but werent to pivetal in the success of the show itself.Brenda-Oh my my, drama queen Brenda. She had more drama in her life than 4,000 amateur movie stars trying to make it in Hollywood at once. Wine wine wine, moan moan moan, argue, argue, argue, ask Brandon for advice, and yell. Other than that she was definately the most annoying and whoas me character on the show, could she act(yes), but in real life i hear she's even worse than Tori Spelling. But she did bring something to the show even though i hate to admit it.Last but not least good ole, angel, perfectionist, womanizer Brandon Walsh-I like and hate his character a lot, if thats possible. I like the fact he is definitely the comic relief of the show and along with Dylan is one of the best actors on the series. BUT. He has probably kissed more girls than any guy in porn has had sex with them. I swear to god every other disc he finds some new girl that falls at his feet or wants to go to bed with him. The thing i do like about him, he does try to do things right, a little TO right soemtimes. But Brandon is definitely the center of attention for the whole show, and it probably would have never been as big without him. Much like Micheal J. Fox(Alex P Keaton) in family ties, brought the show stellar reviews and made it huge success.Many more stars that were cast throughout were very good and brought a new flavor to the show. But my review  would take 2 months to right if i tried to remember them all. I chose to review this season because its the one i'm on, and as i said i'm not reviewing every single one. The perks of this season, as mentioned were David getting into drugs, Andrea being pregnant, all the back and forth taboo relationships between Brandon and his women, and Dylans many issues that still prevail. I would suggest if you've never seen the show to start from the beginning, although if u know the story and have watched it from its inception, try starting from the middle of season 3 and going up. To me its best when they get out of high school and out into the real world. Also here's some data you maybe find interesting from when the show started in 1990 about the star's real ages, some hide it well, and some didnt. Enjoy all the seasons they are really addictive, heck some even pertanant to my life now at 34.Luke Perry (Dylan)-Born 1965, in Mainsfield Ohio- About 25 when the show began.Jason Priestly-(Brandon) Born 1969, in Vancouver British Columbia- About 20 when the show began.Brian Austin Green-(David) Born 1973, Van Nuys California- Around 17 when the show began.Jennie Garth(Kelly) Born 1972, in Urbana Illinois- Around 18 when the show began.Ian Ziering (Steve) Born 1964, in Newark New Jersey- Around 26 when the show began.Tori Spelling(Donna) Born 1973, in Los Angeles Cal.- Around 17 when the show began.Gabrielle Carteris(Andrea) Born 1961- in Scottsdale Arizona-around 29 when the show started.Tiffani Thiessen *main character in 1994*- Born 1974- Long Beach California- 20 at her start.So this is just some interesting facts in case your new, or have never seen the show and thought they all really started out as teenagers. :D",4,"I own them all, and this one is where i'm at thus far.
