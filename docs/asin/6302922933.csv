He went hunting alone and fell shooting himself in the leg. He lost as lot of blood waiting for help. He sent his dog for Stratton's wife who helped him get home. The leg was damaged and had to be amputated. Everyone wrote off his baseball career as hopeless. He alone rehabed his leg. He taught himself to walk and finally to pitch again. The Scout who originally found him and signed him up to play, came to live with the Strattons to take care of Monty. secretive effort was put into practice and Monty retained his pitching talent.Ultimately they got the old team to let him prove himself in the All Star Game.

The picture quality is very clear, so much so, that the people I was watching the movie with couldn't believe it was a movie from the forties.  Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job of portraying Stratton, a ""country"" baseball player from Texas who makes it to the majors and then wounds himself while hunting for rabbits.  Resulting in the amputation of his leg.  June Allyson is so very likeable as Stratton's very encouraging wife.  The interplay between Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson is very sweet and very funny.  Overall, the movie is just so delightful and likeable that I recommend it for everyone of all ages.  It has a lot of baseball that can appeal to the young and old alike and the story is one that reaches everyone.

346202,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6302922933,Craig Connell,"[0, 1]","This was a nice baseball story, nothing exceptional, but one in which Jimmy Stewart's presence in the title roll elevates it.Jimmy looks a bit old to be playing a rookie pitcher, and he doesn't throw like a professional, but at least he isn't pathetic in that regard like some of the other classic-era actors who attempted to do so (you know who they are). Anyway, they faked enough of the pitching scenes here to get away with Stewart's baseball shortcomings.It's just as much a human-interest story as it is a baseball movie, the story of ""Monty Stratton"" (Stewart) and his girlfriend-then-bride ""Ethel,"" played warmly by June Allyson. She and Frank Morgan, who plays the scout who discovers Monty, are excellent as the two other main actors of the film.On my second viewing I was surprised to discover that the key part of the film - the part which identifies this story as different from others - doesn't occur until the last third of the film. Then, after that, we see how a difficult and traumatic physical loss affects everyone and whether Monty can return to baseball.Overall, it's an entertaining film if you are a fan of Stewart's work, or a big baseball fan. Most people fall into at least one of those categories. If remade today, I would suspect the script would be a little tighter, but stories were told slower 50 years ago and one has to expect that.

But now having watched it for myself for the first time, I would rank it up there with REAR WINDOW and HARVEY.  THE STRATTON STORY is simply one of the best films ever made, but unfortunately it has been often overlooked.STRATTON boasts expert performances from Jimmy Stewart, the endearing June Allyson, and Frank Morgan.  It has the kind of good acting that makes you wish the movie would keep going on.  The true story of Monty Stratton as reproduced on film is of the unknown underdog who is then defeated and nearly destroyed and comes back more determined than ever.  The story of the underdog is all too common in Hollywood today.

He is discovered by a down-on-his-luck baseball scout (played by Frank ""Wizard of Oz"" Morgan) playing sandlot baseball. Morgan introduces himself and walks the ten miles with Stratton back to his home to try and convince Stratton's mother that her son is a big league pitching prospect. Mom is skeptical of both the scout and his claims; however he is welcomed to dinner and stays the night.  At breakfast, the next morning, Mrs. Stratton is seemingly unconvinced.  She surprises Monty by agreeing for him to go to California where the Chicago White Sox are in spring training.  She even gives him $5.The scout and prospect hitch-hike to California.  The manager of the White Sox, Jimmy Dykes (playing himself) agrees to give Stratton a try-out and eventually offers both the player and the scout a contract. Morgan's character becomes the White Sox pitching coach. Monty meets his future wife Ethel (played by June Allyson) on a blind date. The blind date arranger likes Ethel better than his date and Stratton recognizes the other woman is becoming depressed by the inattention. He promptly escorts Ethel out of the restaurant under a pretext unknown to Ethel that leads to a misunderstanding of Stratton's intentions.  So the blind date, as is often the case, was a mild disaster. Monty however is able to convince her he deserves a second chance and the romance begins.Stratton is with the White Sox as a seldom used pitcher, until during a game in which the Sox are being routed by the Yankees, he is called in as a relief pitcher. He is promptly clobbered.  He is then sent down to minor league Omaha for ""seasoning"".  It is in Omaha The romance with Ethel blooms into marriage.  After a successful minor league tour, he is recalled to Chicago and becomes an All-Star pitcher.The main point of the Stratton story is his struggle with life following an off season hunting accident that caused him to lose a leg.  His reaction to becoming an ex-baseball player is at first full of doubt and self pity.  But with the help of Ethel and a realization he was treating her as if she wasn't enough, he returns to be the old Monty.  Then he learns how, even with an artificial leg, to pitch again.I will not reveal the ending of the story.

In THE STRATTON STORY, director Sam Wood recreates a celluloid vision of grass roots America that audiences could well remember from PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. James Stewart as Monty Stratton has never been better as the small town pitcher who goes from the minors to the majors only to discover that the biggest obstacle of all is not the fearsome sluggers of Murderers Row but rather the difference between success and failure is the ability to rise above personal misfortune by sheer effort of will.Director Wood splits screen time between country scenes of dusty roads and Texas farmhouses with baseball parks, all of which are populated by the good folks that we see in any painting by Norman Rockwell.  Stewart as Stratton does far more than aw-shuck his way through a role that in the hands of a lesser might have emerged as little more than a bumpkin stereotype.  As Stratton struggles to rise in the hierarchy of baseball and slowly connects with June Allyson as Ethel, we can see that despite some serious obstacles in the way, we have no doubt that he will succeed.  Indeed, we find that as Stallone later could do as Rocky, we pull for him from the very first reel where Frank Morgan first sees him in some out of the way ball field and just knows that he is destined for greatness.  For a movie that is grounded in baseball, most of the really interesting parts occur off the field.  We can identify with the cast in a manner that is rare.  Agnes Moorehead as Stratton's mother is the rock that Ethel leans on when Monty loses a leg in a hunting accident, and Ethel tries to be that rock for a man who first needs to know what it means to be a man before he knows what it means to be a ball player. The on the field scenes ring with hardscrabble baseball lore, so much so that we do not care that the cliches add up mostly to justify the winning games that emerge from Stratton's prosthetic leg as much as from his strong right arm.  There are several cameos of real life ball players and managers, all of whom add a note of authenticity to a film that already rings true on every level that counts. What emerges by the end is an entertaining look into just what constitutes a myth of a larger than life hero that is peculiarly American.  When Gary Cooper gave his ""I am the luckiest man in the world"" speech at the close of PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, he might also have been speaking to Monty Stratton who can now see himself as similarly blessed.  In fact, it is the audience that can participate in Gehrig's and Stratton's paean to luck and happiness.
