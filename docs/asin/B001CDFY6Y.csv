1176007,AF61MRUO1WLFN,B001CDFY6Y,"C. Powell ""It's Always Sunny""","[5, 5]","So after seeing Andrew Garfield in The Social Network, I've decided to see how well the young man can act & after viewing this charm of a movie I was able to I've come to a conclusion that he is not a bad actor at all. Actually quite enjoyable on screen.Boy A follows the life of ""Jack Burridge"" (Beautifully portrayed by Andrew Garfield), which is a mysteriously chosen name from the young man in the movie after he is being secretly released from prison due to a crime he and another boy committed when they were much younger. The amount of footage put in from the earlier times when Jack was a kid was just the right amount. Unlike a movie that would just put the first half hour as someone's childhood, the director wonderfully edited flashbacks into the film and periodically placed them into it to add more questions and build more interest to what the boys did to be incriminated when they were younger. I won't spoil anything for you because the film is fantastic and really offers that question of ""Who decides who gets a second chance""? Jack Burridge has a bruised soul yet a very strong heart, but due to his lack of being nurtured properly, he is on a verge of an emotional collapse. While he is ""technically"" given his second chance, we follow Jack to see whether he will move on with his life or be pulled back into the life he once had, become the boy that he once was again? The film offers most of every emotion there is. Before taking a turn into becoming a psychological suspense, you are given laughter, love, hope, and a point of view of someone trying to adjust to world, tyring to work, have a girlfriend, have friends, but due to a past from his childhood, it may be tougher than expected. I recommend this for everyone, though some will differ on the ending of the film. I hope I've been helpful..-Cam",5,An Admirable Achievement,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,1826,"['So', 'seeing', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Social', 'Network', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'young', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'viewing', 'charm', 'movie', 'was', 'able', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'Actually', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'screen.Boy', 'A', 'life', 'Jack', 'Burridge', 'Beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'mysteriously', 'chosen', 'name', 'young', 'man', 'movie', 'being', 'secretly', 'released', 'prison', 'due', 'crime', 'boy', 'committed', 'when', 'were', 'much', 'younger', 'amount', 'footage', 'put', 'earlier', 'times', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'movie', 'would', 'just', 'put', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'someone', 'childhood', 'director', 'wonderfully', 'edited', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'periodically', 'placed', 'add', 'more', 'questions', 'build', 'more', 'interest', 'what', 'boys', 'did', 'be', 'incriminated', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'film', 'fantastic', 'really', 'question', 'Who', 'who', 'second', 'chance', 'Jack', 'Burridge', 'bruised', 'soul', 'yet', 'very', 'strong', 'heart', 'due', 'lack', 'being', 'nurtured', 'properly', 'verge', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'technically', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'follow', 'Jack', 'see', 'will', 'move', 'life', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'life', 'once', 'had', 'become', 'boy', 'once', 'was', 'again', 'film', 'most', 'emotion', 'taking', 'turn', 'becoming', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'are', 'given', 'laughter', 'love', 'hope', 'point', 'view', 'someone', 'trying', 'adjust', 'world', 'tyring', 'work', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'friends', 'due', 'past', 'childhood', 'may', 'be', 'tougher', 'expected', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'will', 'differ', 'ending', 'film', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'been', 'helpful..-Cam']",Boy A

And can a person ever really be rehabilitated? Just a few of the thoughts I had while watching this film.There are so many wonderful and troubling things going on during this hour and a half flim. It's very hard to separate what is real, what is true, and what is fictional. Are Jack's flashbacks to his childhood truth, or are they fiction he makes up to survive? Is his relationship with Michelle real or a fantasy? This fiction thread was driven further home in a brief hommage to Antonioni's Blow Up. Jack reaches a point of no return, just as David Hemmings does in Blow Up. There's a series of images of wind blowing through the trees, along with the singular sound of that wind in both films.The acting is outstanding. I felt drawn into the lives of each character as the film progressed. There's a few pacing issues here and there, some scenes that could be shortened. But overall, this was a very tight, well done film.This is so worth watching. Just be warned, it's not a happy film. And you can almost predict what will happen, but your mind keeps saying, no don't let that happen.There are no special features on the DVD. Just a bunch of previews.

1176012,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001CDFY6Y,Grady Harp,"[21, 24]","BOY A is a film that moves the audience in ways few other films do.  Part of this is the subject matter, part the solid drama of the novel by Jonathan Trigell on which Mark O'Rowe based his brilliantly understated screenplay, part the sensitive direction by John Crowley, and in large part is the cast of remarkably fine actors who make this impossibly treacherous story credible.'Boy A' refers to Eric Wilson (Alfie Owen) who was jailed for a crime with his friend with  whom he was associated as a youth.  He has been released from prison and under the guidance of his 'parole officer/advisor' Terry (Peter Mullan), the now young adult is renamed Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield) to protect him from the public who still remember the heinous crime of which he was convicted: Terry warns Jack to tell no one his real identity.  Jack is assigned a new family and finds new friends in this strange world outside prison walls, but he is still haunted by the crime that changed his life.  How Jack relates to his first female relationship and survives the bigotry of his classmates and city folk and finds a way to hold onto life despite his childhood 'sins' forms the development of this story.While the entire cast is excellent, Andrew Garfield's performance as the guilt ridden needy Eric/Jack is exemplary.  There are many issues this film deals with in addition to the trauma of starting life over after imprisonment, issues that are universal in nature and that probe our psyches for answers that are never easily resolved here.  It is a brilliant little film from the UK.  Highly recommended.

The story it tells, of Jack Burridge (a reformed convict who re-enters society after having served time in prison for a heinous crime he committed as a child), straddles the line between righteousness and sympathy. The film's narrative is structured perfectly--the story of the present-day Jack is intercut with flashbacks to his previous life as Eric, and just as our sympathy for Jack has reached its height, we are confronted with the grim reality of his past crime. Moral complications abound--just as Jack seems to have attained some stability in his new life, an act of selfless heroism thrusts him into the media spotlight, creating tragic implications. Andrew Garfield is masterful as Jack, and the largely unknown supporting cast is solid.

Peter Mullan who won a Best Actor award from the Cannes International Festival forMy Name Is Joe (1998. Peter Mullan, Louise Goodall, Anne-Marie Kennedy)plays Terry, a caseworker, assigned to help the reentry from prison for a young man, Jack Burridge.  Jack is played by Andrew Garfield.  While this was Garfield's first major film, he has gone on to work with Robert Redford in ""Lions for Lambs"" & with Johnny Depp in the upcoming ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassas.""  Garfield is all over the map emotionally, stoic & controlled, shy & uncertain, haunted & afraid to trust.  It's an impressive performance.  Jack starts a romance with Michelle played by Katie Lyons.

1176023,A38921VU3NJDFK,B001CDFY6Y,N. Anno,"[2, 2]","Boy A is diabolically affecting, and its societal dictum is as strong and significant as any in cinema over the last few years.You may not know the name Andrew Garfield, but that's irrelevant. You will. At age 26 and with a couple studio titles to his r&eacute;sum&eacute; (Lions for Lambs, The Other Boleyn Girl), he has attained a level of dramatic portrayal that takes some a lifetime and escapes others completely. The vessel for this breakout is director John Crowley's Boy A, the deeply tragic story of a rehabilitated ex-convict (Garfield)--dubbed ""Boy A"" in his juvenile case. Boy A is forced into leading a hidden life to protect himself from the social discrepancies that would otherwise hinder, maybe even destroy his chance at normality, success, and happiness.As Crowley's second feature film (his first was 2003's Intermission, starring Colin Farrell and Cillian Murphy), Boy A is astoundingly salient and equally persuasive, as are the actors, who improve its status from great to essential. But even before the force of its thespians hits, the film wins with the vitality of its writing and, specifically, the point it's set on hitting, which is best got at in its promotional tagline: ""Who decides who gets a second chance?"" The viewer is left to summon his or her own conclusion--perhaps the most distinguishably mature act of Crowley's adaptation--though it surely won't be considered an easy one, for the character that Garfield creates is so lushly endearing in his coyness and nervousness that the picture's audience will have a near-impossible time believing he ever had involvement in the heavy crime he's charged with.And that's the brilliance of Boy A (and Andrew Garfield's role). Is the movie's focal study reformed or was he ever a monster to begin with? The provocation of such a topic is consuming, and John Crowley constructs the film in a way that maximizes its power, which is no less than shattering in its totality. Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell, Boy is a regimented political and social voice--willed by the demand of today's society--that adheres to the world's paradoxes and contradictions and keeps screaming until they've been fixed and announced. It also happens to be one of the most heartbreaking films I've seen in a while.

He must establish a new identity so that the press can't reveal his whereabouts as he has received many death threats. He is helped by a social worker who has worked with him for several years and who finds him a new identity, a place to live, and a job.The film shows the challenges he faces in keeping his past hidden from the new friends he is making,  Andrew Garfield gives a very sensitive portrayal of the young man and shows his desire to reveal his identity so that he can live a truthful life and one where he doesn't have to hide who he is.This is a very moving film and shows great sensitivity and understanding about the abuse and neglect that led to a horrendous crime being comitted by two very young boys, and how the character played by Mr. Garfield has been able to rehabilitate himself and rejoin the community at large.",5,Excellent movie about guilt and redemption,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1356,"['wonderful', 'film', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'young', 'man', 'just', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'time', 'murdering', 'young', 'girl', 'crime', 'comitted', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'influence', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'came', 'abusive', 'home', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'what', 'led', 'commit', 'crime.The', 'crime', 'was', 'sensationalized', 'press', 'time', 'crime', 'was', 'comitted', 'release', 'reports', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'must', 'establish', 'new', 'identity', 'so', 'press', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'whereabouts', 'received', 'many', 'death', 'threats', 'helped', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'worked', 'several', 'years', 'who', 'new', 'identity', 'place', 'live', 'job.The', 'film', 'challenges', 'keeping', 'past', 'hidden', 'new', 'friends', 'making', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'very', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'desire', 'reveal', 'identity', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'truthful', 'life', 'one', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'hide', 'who', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'understanding', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'led', 'horrendous', 'crime', 'being', 'comitted', 'two', 'very', 'young', 'boys', 'how', 'character', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Garfield', 'been', 'able', 'rehabilitate', 'rejoin', 'community', 'large']",Boy A

There is so much that can be stated about what this film touches upon, including second chances, media persecution, love, friendship, youthful indiscretions, homicidal tendencies, being a hero to a child and so on.I admit I had to turn on the subtitles to understand half of what got said, but in the end I am glad I didn't miss a word. Garfield played a phenomenal performance that deserves all of the recognition he got; A powerful future he has in acting. This story of a young man getting a second chance at life after a childhood murder he is involved in gets intertwined with his present day life; an adequate pacing of this child's miserable existence coupled with his chance at living a life he never got. I find myself watching it again as I write this to see what I missed in the editing.The ""What's your name"" line edited to the tombstone in the first ten minutes gives you an idea of what to expect with the rest of the film. And I feel they did an incredible job throughout. So much of what I heard and saw makes me recall my days as a US Expat working with some outcast Brits (in so many ways).
