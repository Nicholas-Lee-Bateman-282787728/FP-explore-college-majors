It is challenging research he is presenting and a scientist can find some flaws in some of the experiments.  Nevertheless, it is a good job well done and very worthwhile of the time if you have any curiosity about why we are so different than our many quite close relatives.  I was one day staring into the eyes of a chimp at a well known zoo.  He and I examined each others eyes for what must have been at least five minutes, and were unaware of the crowd surrounding us.  I have often reflected on that interlude and marvelled at what must have gone through each of our minds during that time.  It was a humbling and acute experience, and one that I would like to repeat.  We are so close genetically, and yet so far from each other in capability.

The first part explains how the human species evolved, and why we charted one course of evolution as opposed to another. The focus is on anthropology, evolutionary anthropology, and archaeology. The second part focuses on the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives, chimps. And the final part was about the brain and how brain imaging can provide clues about our thought processes and language. The show, combined as a whole, was about what makes us uniquely human (or not); we are actually very similar to other animals. Alan Alda is the host and narrator - he was just average as a host; he's extremely old, not very knowledgeable about the subject and looked tired the whole time. If you have ever read or watched Guns, Germs and Steel by Diamond (and enjoyed it), then this is similar and would likely be of interest to you.

This difference is the HUMAN SPARK, the subject that's analyzed in this fascinating documentary hosted by M*A*S*H*'s Hawkeye Pierce himself, Alan Alda.In order to answer this big question, other questions are answered such as:(1) What is the origin of the human spark?(2) When and why did the human spark ignite?(3) Why didn't it ignite in our cousins, the Neanderthals?(4) Why didn't our present-day relatives (chimps and other apes) never get the spark?Alda travels all over the world to talk with those actively engaged in research to answer the big question and the other questions that follow from it.This documentary is in three episodes.  Each episode is composed of six chapters.The first episode is entitled ""Becoming Us.""  Here our earliest ancestors are examined.  My favourite chapter has the title ""Crash-Course in Primitive Tool-Making.""Episode number two has the title ""So Human, So Chimp.""  Here there is examination of our closest living relatives.  My favourite chapter is called ""Apes vs. Humans.""The final episode (and my personal favourite) is entitled ""Brain Matters.""  In this episode, neuroscientists in Boston scan and analyze Alan Alda's brain.  The last chapter of this episode is particularly important and interesting.  It is called ""The Essential Human Spark.""Watching Alan Alda host this documentary, you get the sense that he could teach basket-weaving and make it interesting, relevant, and fun!
