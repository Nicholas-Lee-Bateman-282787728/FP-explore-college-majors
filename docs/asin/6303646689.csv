I could remember certain scenes, Leslie Ann, the colorful gowns at the ball, the melodies...OH the melodies. My goodness, this score is so beautiful and even haunting. It is not simple happy major key tunes, but has such depth and conveys the evocative painful longing of love. Leslie Ann Warren, then and now, still one of my absolute favorite actresses of all time * PLEASE see Choose Me!!!*she was such a beautiful wise soul at 18, able to convey everything with her eyes, with that gorgeous smile, her angelic voice... Everyone in this movie, the breathtaking Celeste Holm, the elegant beauty Ginger Rogers... even the stepmother and sisters, their talent shines!Even though the sets were kind of simple and certainly not up to the big budgets of today, the story still works. The simplicity and colors convey the storybook feel, and certainly children will not mind that!I don't exactly know why I was crying my eyes out... the beautiful songs and how they were sung, the memories of my childhood, the simple story of love and magic?I can not recommend this enough for children and dreamers and lovers of all ages. Exceptionally magical!Even as a feminist, and someone who is not sure about the concepts of a Prince Charming, but who does believe in love... I am planning to get this for my little nieces, mainly so they can fall in love with a musical and stimulate their imaginations.",5,I can not believe how teary I got...,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1515,"['had', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'TV', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'how', 'details', 'were', 'burned', 'brain', 'then', 'could', 'remember', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Leslie', 'Ann', 'colorful', 'gowns', 'ball', 'melodies', 'OH', 'melodies', 'My', 'goodness', 'score', 'so', 'beautiful', 'even', 'haunting', 'not', 'simple', 'happy', 'major', 'key', 'tunes', 'such', 'depth', 'conveys', 'evocative', 'painful', 'longing', 'love', 'Leslie', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'then', 'now', 'still', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'time', '*', 'PLEASE', 'see', 'Choose', 'Me', '*she', 'was', 'such', 'beautiful', 'wise', 'soul', '18', 'able', 'convey', 'everything', 'eyes', 'gorgeous', 'smile', 'angelic', 'voice', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'breathtaking', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'elegant', 'beauty', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'even', 'stepmother', 'sisters', 'talent', 'shines', 'Even', 'sets', 'were', 'kind', 'simple', 'certainly', 'not', 'big', 'budgets', 'today', 'story', 'still', 'simplicity', 'colors', 'convey', 'storybook', 'feel', 'certainly', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'how', 'were', 'sung', 'memories', 'childhood', 'simple', 'story', 'love', 'magic', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'enough', 'children', 'dreamers', 'lovers', 'ages', 'Exceptionally', 'magical', 'Even', 'feminist', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'sure', 'concepts', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'who', 'believe', 'love', 'am', 'planning', 'get', 'little', 'nieces', 'mainly', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'musical', 'stimulate', 'imaginations']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS

It was never about the best sets, most well known actors or updating a plot that has stood the test of time, it was about (and remains) HEART!

383378,AFDYHKAH8AJDT,6303646689,A. Sloan,"[8, 8]","There is such a connection with my childhood when I first saw this.  I was six years old we were living on a military base in North Carolina. My parents  had just left for a Christmas party  and my older brother and sister who were in High School were left in charge of  us (there were a total 7 of us at that time.)  As soon as my parents left the party was ON for us!  I know we ran my brother and sister crazy.  We jumped on the furniture, ate way too many sweets and yes....we probably ran with scissors!  The only thing that got us to calm down was this.  I think it was a double feature with  Mary Martin's Peter Pan playing the same evening.  Nureyev's  ""Nutcracker"" played later that week.  It's such a vivid memory.Lesley Ann Warren's wild-eyed enthusiasm was contagious.  Her expressions and reactions drew me in.  The way she flinched at one point when Jo Van Fleet ( the step-mother who I'm sure Billy Idol stole his famous sneer from) snapped at her was heartbreaking.  I think I cried for her back then.  The acting on her part was superb considering how young she was and who she was acting with.  Van Fleet's persona alone usually eats up all other characters appearing with her in other films.  She was a bonafied scene stealer and a force to be reckoned with, but Lesley Ann Warren held her own beautifully.  Stuart Damon was and still is very nice to look at and his voice was very soothing and endearing.  (Although a bit stilted  and stiff in his acting at times.  I think the big names intimidated his some.)  Pat Carroll's comedic timing is on cue as usual, she was perfect.  Although I may have wanted to see more of Ginger and Celeste,  (Walter always bored me to tears)  the presentation was called  ""Cinderella""  after-all.The sets were so 60's it makes me laugh, but that was part of the charm back then.  Rodger's and Hammerstien were fantastic with songs that will stay with you a lifetime.  On the whole it's truly wonderful and magical as it should be and definitely worth picking up for your kids to see!",5,I'm six years old again!,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2037,"['such', 'connection', 'childhood', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'were', 'living', 'military', 'base', 'North', 'Carolina', 'parents', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'Christmas', 'party', 'older', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'were', 'High', 'School', 'were', 'left', 'charge', 'were', 'total', '7', 'time', 'As', 'soon', 'parents', 'left', 'party', 'was', 'ON', 'know', 'ran', 'brother', 'sister', 'crazy', 'jumped', 'furniture', 'ate', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'sweets', 'yes', 'probably', 'ran', 'scissors', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'calm', 'down', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'double', 'feature', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'playing', 'same', 'evening', 'Nureyev', 'Nutcracker', 'played', 'later', 'week', 'such', 'vivid', 'memory.Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'wild-eyed', 'enthusiasm', 'was', 'contagious', 'expressions', 'reactions', 'drew', 'way', 'flinched', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'step-mother', 'who', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'stole', 'famous', 'sneer', 'snapped', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'think', 'cried', 'back', 'then', 'acting', 'part', 'was', 'superb', 'considering', 'how', 'young', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'acting', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'persona', 'alone', 'usually', 'up', 'other', 'characters', 'appearing', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'bonafied', 'scene', 'stealer', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'held', 'own', 'beautifully', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'look', 'voice', 'was', 'very', 'soothing', 'endearing', 'bit', 'stilted', 'stiff', 'acting', 'times', 'think', 'big', 'names', 'intimidated', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'comedic', 'timing', 'cue', 'usual', 'was', 'perfect', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Ginger', 'Celeste', 'Walter', 'always', 'bored', 'tears', 'presentation', 'was', 'called', 'Cinderella', 'after-all.The', 'sets', 'were', 'so', '60', 'laugh', 'was', 'part', 'charm', 'back', 'then', 'Rodger', 'Hammerstien', 'were', 'fantastic', 'songs', 'will', 'stay', 'lifetime', 'whole', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'magical', 'should', 'be', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'kids', 'see']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS

I remember when I was growing up looking forward to the annual showing of this classic, just like 'The Wizard of Oz'.  I absolutely loved it then and time has not changed my opinion.  It has even improved with age.  The cast is perfection with a young Stuart Damon as the dashing, handsome prince, Ginger Rogers as the regal Queen, Walter Pidgeon as the king with the dry wit, Jo Van Fleet as the haughty stepmother, Barbara Ruick as Esmerelda, the stepsister with the batty eyes and Pat Carroll as Prunella (what a name for a character), the other nasty stepsister who manages to steal every scene she's in.  The scene where she's trying on the slipper is a howler!!  And let's not forget Celeste Holm as the epitome of goodness as the fairy godmother.  Oh, and the music???  My favorite is ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" and you'll find yourself singing along to ""Impossible"", ""In My Own Little Corner"", ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"", ""Ten Minutes Ago"", ""A Lovely Night""...and all the rest.  There is a charming fifteen minute retrospective featuring a much more mature Lesley Ann Warren who considers this film as a ""Gift"" to her career, (a now sadly bloated and yellow teethed) Stuart Damon and a still regal Celeste Holm reminiscing beautifully about this labor of love.

383381,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,6303646689,Ben Adam,"[13, 23]","This 1965 remake of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of Cinderella was justified by CBS because the original 1957 production could not be videotaped. Allegedly once it was broadcast, it was lost forever. That turned out not to be entirely true; it was preserved in a black-and-white kinescope recording that was recently released on DVD. This production, while technologically advanced and in full color, none the less lacks the magic that the original production had, largely because the producers decided to truncate the script and to make the entire production into a largely forgettable affair, wasting the talented actors they hired. While the production is not without charm, the charm pales in comparison to the original 1957, which is now available on DVD.Lesley Ann Warren, a newcomer when she appeared in the title role, never really seems to become the princess type. She sings beautifully, but comes across as less than graceful throughout the production. Stuart Damon, in the role of the Prince, sings well, but his acting leaves much to be desired; he always seems to be reading from a cue card. The talents of Barbara Ruick and Pat Carroll are not adequately utilized in this production. They sing well, which comes as no surprise, but their full potential was not explored in this production. Celeste Holm is charming and regal as the Fairy Godmother, but her role has been pared down to almost nothing, a far cry from the original role. The roles of King and Queen in this production, played by Walter Pidgeon and Ginger Rodgers, have been reduced to walk-on roles that could have been just as easily played by extras; the banter that made the roles of the King and Queen so endearing in the original production is gone in this version completely.It is hard to understand why the story was mutilated to such an extreme when the original story could have just as easily been used and given this production far more life than it had. The original story had so much verve that this production lacks that the two barely resemble one another. There is something very tragic in the waste of such a shabby production; it really was not necessary.Someone will really have to explain what was the meaning of having that woman leap up in front of the camera on the last beat of the song ""The Prince Is Giving a Ball."" It was embarrassing, to say the least, for her. It was one of many oddities in the production that really defied all explanation. This production adds one song to the score -- a leftover song from South Pacific, Richard Rodgers explained in the program notes in the soundtrack album, ""Loneliness of Evening,"" sung by Stuart Damon -- but it added nothing to the production.The quality of the DVD itself is fair; it's a shame that the contents don't justify making it. From reading the other reviews, I have a feeling that most of the others who gave five-star reviews never saw the 1957 version; otherwise, they would never have praised this version so highly. There really is no comparison. If it's quality you want, get the 1957 version with Julie Andrews; you won't regret the choice.",3,A marvelous musical; a mediocre production,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,3114,"['1965', 'remake', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'Cinderella', 'was', 'justified', 'CBS', 'original', '1957', 'production', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'videotaped', 'Allegedly', 'was', 'broadcast', 'was', 'lost', 'forever', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'true', 'was', 'preserved', 'black-and-white', 'kinescope', 'recording', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'production', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'full', 'color', 'none', 'less', 'magic', 'original', 'production', 'had', 'largely', 'producers', 'decided', 'truncate', 'script', 'make', 'entire', 'production', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'affair', 'wasting', 'talented', 'actors', 'hired', 'production', 'not', 'charm', 'charm', 'pales', 'comparison', 'original', '1957', 'now', 'available', 'DVD.Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'newcomer', 'when', 'appeared', 'title', 'role', 'never', 'really', 'become', 'princess', 'type', 'beautifully', 'across', 'less', 'graceful', 'production', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'role', 'Prince', 'sings', 'well', 'acting', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'always', 'be', 'reading', 'cue', 'card', 'talents', 'Barbara', 'Ruick', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'are', 'not', 'adequately', 'utilized', 'production', 'sing', 'well', 'surprise', 'full', 'potential', 'was', 'not', 'explored', 'production', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'charming', 'regal', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'role', 'been', 'pared', 'down', 'almost', 'nothing', 'far', 'cry', 'original', 'role', 'roles', 'King', 'Queen', 'production', 'played', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'Ginger', 'Rodgers', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'walk-on', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'easily', 'played', 'extras', 'banter', 'made', 'roles', 'King', 'Queen', 'so', 'endearing', 'original', 'production', 'gone', 'version', 'completely.It', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'story', 'was', 'mutilated', 'extreme', 'when', 'original', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'used', 'given', 'production', 'far', 'more', 'life', 'had', 'original', 'story', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'verve', 'production', 'two', 'barely', 'resemble', 'one', 'something', 'very', 'tragic', 'waste', 'such', 'shabby', 'production', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'necessary.Someone', 'will', 'really', 'have', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'meaning', 'having', 'woman', 'up', 'front', 'camera', 'last', 'beat', 'song', 'Prince', 'Is', 'Giving', 'Ball', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'oddities', 'production', 'really', 'defied', 'explanation', 'production', 'one', 'song', 'score', 'leftover', 'song', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'explained', 'program', 'notes', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'Loneliness', 'Evening', 'sung', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'added', 'nothing', 'production.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'fair', 'shame', 'contents', 'do', ""n't"", 'justify', 'making', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'others', 'who', 'gave', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'never', 'saw', '1957', 'version', 'otherwise', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'praised', 'version', 'so', 'highly', 'really', 'comparison', 'quality', 'want', 'get', '1957', 'version', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'choice']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS

I treasure it for the simple reason that it's a live-on-tape television broadcast instead of a movie, and pretty darn impressive for a fantasy story which features admittedly simple special effects. (As a guy now in my 40's, I admit to modern-day fairy tales having more sophisticated effects, but when I was a kid I thought the spinning prisms of light coming out of the fairy godmother's wand was the real thing!) Because it is a videotape, it does resemble a live performance, and may be as close as you can get to live since the next version was, in fact, filmed. I had a big crush on Lesley Ann Warren (all of 18 years old when this was taped), with her beautiful eyes and long swan neck, and was glad that this production expanded the ""Lovely Night"" sequence to accomodate her talents as a dancer.

A motion picture (35MM or whatever) when transferred to DVD gives a pure, crisp, almost perfect picture. Cinderella was recorded on video tape in the mid 60's. Tape images are composed of lines the same as a TV picture. You can't get a perfect image. A DVD has a higher image resolution than tape.

It couldn't TOUCH this version!  (And Julie Andrews has always been my favorite lady singer!!)  I thought the 57 version was flat, and the only thing really good in it at all were the ""Stepsisters, Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley!""  I thought I would be blown away by Julie singing these wonderful songs, but I was not.  I much prefer Lesley Ann Warren's versions of the songs.  THIS VERSION RULES!!!!!)This rendition of Cinderella is superb! The music is abolutely beautiful! I remember all the songs almost word for word from when I watched it when I was a child. I really loved it then, and watched it every year it came on. Now I'm 47, and I love it more NOW than I did THEN! I feel sorry for some of the reviewers here that can't see the beauty of this with their imagination, and who think everything has to have expensive new special effects and must be made with the greatest singers in the world (like Julie Andrews. No one can touch her singing!) But that is NOT what this is! This is a beautiful, unique, heartfelt rendition. Cinderella is fresh and sweet and tugs at your heart! The prince is gorgeous and nice and decent! The stepmother and sisters are FANTASTIC! They really make this complete! Jo Van Fleet's sneer is the best! (She even sneers when she's talking and has her back to you. ""There's no pleasing THAT prince!"" Her VOICE even sneered!!!) And Pat Carroll is so REAL!!!! And Esmerelda (Barbara Ruick) is hysterical with her eye batting!I LOVED the Prince's song at the beginning! It was warm and searching and heartfelt, and really set the tone for the singing! ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" was novel and catchy, and I've remembered parts of it for almost 40 years!!! ""In My Own Little Corner"" I have loved and remembered all the words to for all this time! This song really comes alive and she puts SO much into it! Ms. Holm is a beautiful fairy godmother, and makes me wish I had been able to see her films when she was young! Her and Cinderella singing ""Impossible"" is wonderful! It's the usual Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""nonsense"" song and is very fast-paced, ""wordy"" and hard to sing! But they did an excellent job of it, and Cinderella's eyes absolutely sparkled! (This is another catchy one I've remembered ALL the words to for ALL this time!!!) The Prince and Cinderella dancing is just too wonderful for words! I wish I had all that room to waltz in while they're waltzing, but I only have a tiny living room and I don't know HOW to waltz, but I really wanted to! The movement of the dance was GREAT!!! (It would have been nice to see Ginger Rogers do a whole dance instead of one turn around the floor--but it was nice to see the legend dance in this for only a moment!) The stepsister's song (Stepsisters' Lament) was really a masterpiece! That was for all the normal girls, who aren't sweet and beautiful and ethereal like Cinderella! (She's a frothy little bubble--with a flimsy kind of CHARM! And with very little TROUBLE--I could break her little ARM!!!) This song is TOPS!!! ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" are beautiful gems of songs. They are truly memorable! ""A Lovely Night"" is another lovely one (there really are NO bad songs in this one)!!! And when the Prince comes to their home to try the shoe on them!!! JO Van Fleet tries to steal the scene again, by sitting down for them to try the shoe on her old ""sneery"" self when she sees her daughters can't make it at all! The man just gets up and walks away--he wouldn't give her the satisfaction! But to me, the greatest scene in the whole thing, is when the Prince wants to try the shoe on Cinderella and the stepmother starts screaming and squawking, and the Prince yells ""SILENCE!!!!"" and they show the frozen tableau of the stepmother and sisters when they actually were made to shut up! THAT SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY indescribable! I truly can't think of words for how funny it was and how satisfying!This is not ""Gone With the Wind"" acting and it's not performed by opera queens. It wasn't high budget and out to make billions of dollars!However, the songs in it are beautiful. I rate it up there with Mary Poppins (Chim Chim Cheree and Feed the Birds) and of course, the Sound of Music.This is an operetta meant to entertain. It is witty and funny and heartwarming and fun and beautiful and memorable. I have remembered it and loved it since 1965 and find it truly unique and recommend it to all!!! (Except for people LOOKING for only Gone With the Wind Acting or Prima Donnas!)BRAND NEW UPDATE 7/26/12  I have now bought this wonderful version for my very precious, wonderful granddaughter, and we have watched it together a couple times.  She lives 200 miles away, and when I call her on the phone, we sing the songs in this movie together over the phone (she could sing and remember the words when she was 5).  She loves this movie too!

I understand this was a television movie, but they couldn't at least choose good actors and provide a better set?  Cinderella acts and sounds like a complete ditz, all starry-eyed and breathless voice.  It's partly the fault of the camera-work though.  Every 10 seconds and it's an extreme close-up of Cinderella's face.  It's frightening.  I love the music and this musical, but if it's not well-acted or well-sung, it's not enjoyable for me.  I've only heard the Julie Andrews version in soundtrack form, and already that one is 100X better.  There's none of the pleasant, exciting, and lovely performances of the original cast.

383409,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,6303646689,Jim Jr,"[5, 10]","This version of Rogers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" is decent but can not hold a candle to the original with Julie Andrews. Anyone who was lucky enough to have seen the original can not help but remember what a magnificent production it was. The cast was so good that any others playing the roles pale by comparison. Julie Andrews WAS (and still is) Cinderella. Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostly were a riot as the stepsisters and Edie Adams was a young, sexy, very funny godmother. The final image of her twirling her wand like a cheerleader with a baton at the wedding is unforgettable. She also had a much better singing voice than Celeste Holm.When this second version was produced, a new book was written that took out all the humor given the stepsisters and godmother. It became a rather straightforward almost cardboard version. Gone was the great song for the king and queen - one of the real delights in the original. (Luckily it can be heard on the CD of the original.) The king and queen were delightful off beat characters but were made too dignified in the new version. The roles were cut so drastically that casting Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon wastes the talents of these major stars.Leslie Ann Warren is an acceptable Cindy but the part was written for Julie Andrews so anyone else is at a disadvantage. It is rather ironic that she and Julie are both in ""Victor/Victoria"". Two more different actresses you could not find. Simply compare them in ""V/V"" to see this.But, even fondly recalling the first version - though it was in black and white, this would still be a production to watch over and over. Even with eliminated songs, the score is wonderful. The production design is storybook lovely with great color.""Cinderella"" will be successful in almost any version (except the one with Whitney Houston and Brandy - a real mistake) so perhaps comparing the Julie Andrews version to this one is a bit unfair.

383425,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,6303646689,octobercountry,"[1, 1]","Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" was such a success upon its premiere as a live television event in 1957, that the decision was made to mount another production in 1965, but to record it for posterity this time around. It starred Lesley Ann Warren, Ginger Rogers, Stuart Damon, Celeste Holm, and Walter Pidgeon (among others).I viewed this one in conjunction with the 1957 version; it had been quite a while since I've seen either one, and I wanted to compare the two. They certainly are very different, though the songs and orchestrations are pretty much the same in both versions. (The main difference with the music is that one song was dropped from the 1957 score, and another---""Loneliness of Evening""--- was added. It's a lovely little tune, which had originally been written for ""South Pacific"" but which was not used in that show.)However, apart from the music, this is completely different from the original teleplay. The 1957 script was scrapped entirely (not a trace of it remains) and replaced with an all-new story structure, dialogue---the works. And I'm afraid the new script doesn't compare to the old---it's dull and stodgy and lackluster, where the original was light and witty and vivacious. There's a certain lethargy present throughout the production, in fact. It isn't dull, exactly, but it doesn't have much energy either.Interesting to see how Lesley Ann Warren played the role quite differently than Julies Andrews did. Lesley's Cinderella is shy and retiring, wistful and lonely, while Julie's was cheery, hopeful, and energetic. I think both interpretations work well, but there's a slight problem with Lesley's performance, in that the actress really is not a singer and doesn't have a strong voice. She doesn't sound BAD, but she's obviously not a trained singer.  In fact, NONE of the actors in this production have particularly good voices apart from Stuart Damon as the prince---and in my opinion this is a big problem in a musical. When you're working with a musical score as lovely as this one is, you want to hear it performed at very high standards.The set design is an extremely stylized mediaeval concoction (in 1960's colours!)---there's no attempt at realism, but rather it's deliberately made to look like a stage play. The results are rather interesting, but everything is lit very brightly using a flat, uniform lighting design that robs the production of any shred of atmosphere. It's a pity, but I daresay this type of lighting was necessary for the primitive early colour video cameras in use during this time period.The costumes likewise are mock-mediaeval; I can't say I like the colour design, but they're kind of fun---I always got a kick out of those huge elaborate headdresses, particularly the tall pointy ones with flowing drapes on the tips. Unfortunately I thought that Cinderella's ball gown was most unimpressive---it flowed nicely when she was waltzing, but that's the best that can be said for it. Ginger Rogers likewise was dressed in an extremely unflattering gown---and hey, why on earth would they use Ginger Rogers in this picture if they didn't feature her in a dance with the king?So, despite the higher level of technical proficiency, and the fact that the original video elements are much better preserved, this version does not really measure up to the 1957 original, in my opinion. A mixed review from me---and yet I have a very strong fondness for this production, because it was the one that was broadcast every year when I was growing up. It was a big deal when this would be shown on television, and we would watch it without fail. And I still re-watch it every now and again, all these many years later. So, if you like the music, I'll recommend this one as well as the 1957 production.Inexplicably, this DVD is now out of print, but it much sought-after (if you read the reviews here, you'll see that most people remember this very fondly indeed). It regularly sells at a certain on-line auction site for sums between forty and eighty dollars---but if you keep an eye out for it, you can occasionally find a relatively inexpensive copy that somehow has been overlooked. The soundtrack album, however, is still available.",4,Very fondly remembered,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,4203,"['Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', 'was', 'success', 'premiere', 'live', 'television', 'event', '1957', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'mount', 'production', '1965', 'record', 'posterity', 'time', 'around', 'starred', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'others', '.I', 'viewed', 'one', 'conjunction', '1957', 'version', 'had', 'been', 'quite', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'wanted', 'compare', 'two', 'certainly', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'songs', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'versions', 'main', 'difference', 'music', 'one', 'song', 'was', 'dropped', '1957', 'score', 'Loneliness', 'Evening', 'was', 'added', 'lovely', 'little', 'tune', 'had', 'originally', 'been', 'written', 'South', 'Pacific', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'show', 'However', 'apart', 'music', 'completely', 'different', 'original', 'teleplay', '1957', 'script', 'was', 'scrapped', 'entirely', 'not', 'trace', 'replaced', 'all-new', 'story', 'structure', 'dialogue', '-the', 'works', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'new', 'script', ""n't"", 'compare', 'old', '-it', 'dull', 'stodgy', 'lackluster', 'where', 'original', 'was', 'light', 'witty', 'vivacious', 'certain', 'lethargy', 'present', 'production', 'fact', ""n't"", 'dull', 'exactly', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'energy', 'either.Interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'played', 'role', 'quite', 'differently', 'Julies', 'Andrews', 'did', 'Lesley', 'Cinderella', 'shy', 'retiring', 'wistful', 'lonely', 'Julie', 'was', 'cheery', 'hopeful', 'energetic', 'think', 'interpretations', 'work', 'well', 'slight', 'problem', 'Lesley', 'performance', 'actress', 'really', 'not', 'singer', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'voice', ""n't"", 'sound', 'BAD', 'obviously', 'not', 'trained', 'singer', 'fact', 'NONE', 'actors', 'production', 'have', 'particularly', 'good', 'voices', 'apart', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'prince', '-and', 'opinion', 'big', 'problem', 'musical', 'When', ""'re"", 'working', 'musical', 'score', 'as', 'lovely', 'one', 'want', 'hear', 'performed', 'very', 'high', 'standards.The', 'set', 'design', 'extremely', 'stylized', 'mediaeval', 'concoction', '1960', 'colours', 'attempt', 'realism', 'rather', 'deliberately', 'made', 'look', 'stage', 'play', 'results', 'are', 'rather', 'interesting', 'everything', 'lit', 'very', 'brightly', 'using', 'flat', 'uniform', 'lighting', 'design', 'production', 'shred', 'atmosphere', 'pity', 'daresay', 'type', 'lighting', 'was', 'necessary', 'primitive', 'early', 'colour', 'video', 'cameras', 'use', 'time', 'costumes', 'likewise', 'are', 'mock-mediaeval', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'colour', 'design', ""'re"", 'kind', 'fun', '-I', 'always', 'got', 'kick', 'huge', 'elaborate', 'headdresses', 'particularly', 'tall', 'pointy', 'ones', 'flowing', 'drapes', 'tips', 'Unfortunately', 'thought', 'Cinderella', 'ball', 'gown', 'was', 'most', 'unimpressive', '-it', 'flowed', 'nicely', 'when', 'was', 'waltzing', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'likewise', 'was', 'dressed', 'extremely', 'unflattering', 'gown', '-and', 'hey', 'why', 'earth', 'would', 'use', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'feature', 'dance', 'king', 'So', 'higher', 'level', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'fact', 'original', 'video', 'elements', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'preserved', 'version', 'not', 'really', 'measure', 'up', '1957', 'original', 'opinion', 'mixed', 'review', '-and', 'yet', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'fondness', 'production', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'broadcast', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'television', 'would', 'watch', 'fail', 'still', 're-watch', 'now', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'So', 'like', 'music', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'one', 'as', 'well', '1957', 'production.Inexplicably', 'DVD', 'now', 'print', 'much', 'sought-after', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'very', 'fondly', 'indeed', 'regularly', 'certain', 'on-line', 'auction', 'site', 'sums', 'forty', 'eighty', 'dollars', '-but', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'can', 'occasionally', 'find', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', 'copy', 'somehow', 'been', 'overlooked', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'however', 'still', 'available']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS

383430,A3MGDTPZVEDGR3,6303646689,phillindholm,"[10, 10]","Famed composers Richard Rodgers And Oscar Hammerstein wrote ""Cinderella"" as an original television musical (their only one) for young star-in-the-making Julie Andrews. Supported by a cast which included Edie Adams, Howard Lindsay, Dorothy Stickney, Ilka Chase, Kay Ballard, Alice Ghostley and Jon Cypher, it received a tremendous publicity campaign and aired on March 31 1957. At the time, it drew a record number of viewers, although only the East Coast saw the live color broadcast (the rest of the country saw a black-and-white kinescope.) And, due in part to the poor quality of the kinescope, it was not repeated again until 2004.Meanwhile, in 1964, Rodgers decided to mount a new production himself (Hammerstein had since died) with a new cast and adaptation, replacing the farcial quality of the original with a more traditional version. The result was another ratings smash, and as intended, a television perennial which was repeated for years. This time, the title role was played by young Lesley Ann Warren, who was introduced in this production and began a career which is still going strong today. Stuart Damon (later to gain fame on ""General Hospital"") played the prince. The supporting cast had Academy Award-winners Celeste Holm, as the fairy godmother, Jo Van Fleet as the stepmother, and Ginger Rogers as the queen. The beloved Walter Pigeon was cast as the king. And, as the two stepsisters Prunella and Esmerelda, were Pat Carroll and Barbara Ruick. Although the story stuck to the familiar fairy tale this time, the original songs were , of course, retained.What more can be said for this near-perfect treasure? Ms. Warren is simply glorious as Cinderella, her fresh beauty complimented by her sweet singing voice, and Damon is her ideal Prince (Christopher) Charming. Celeste Holm sparkles as the fairy godmother, and she and Warren share one of the best numbers ""Impossible/It's Possible"". Van Fleet is a beautifully caustic stepmother, and both Carroll and Ruick are outstanding as the step-sisters. Unfortunately, both Rogers and Pigeon have little to do as the king and queen, but they ARE regal in their roles.There are a couple of drawbacks--although critics at the time praised the ""lavish production""; in reality it is done in the manner of a stage show, with sparse (and very basic) settings, and typical television camera-work. But the biggest error was using videotape instead of film for this production. Because of it's limitations, videotape does no justice to a show like this, severely limiting the visual values needed to compliment the other elements. It may be fine for situation comedies, but it was totally wrong for a musical fantasy. It must be admitted, however, that after a few minutes, one gets used to it, but what a difference film would have made! Because this version is the traditional one, it is my favorite of the two, but both are so different in approach and treatment, that each can be enjoyed on their own terms.Two cast members of the 1965 version were already professionally acquainted with ""Cinderella"". Walter Pigeon provided the uncredited narration for the 1955 MGM film adaptation ""The Glass Slipper"" and Barbara Ruick was the daughter of character actress Lurene Tuttle, who played ""Cousin Loulou"" in the same movie.

383442,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6303646689,Susan Fong,"[127, 135]","Simply stated, Richard Rodgers is America's finest composer. No other composer in our history equals the consistent quality, innovativeness, range, and sublime beauty of his compositions. Rodgers' exquisite, unforgettable melodies are crafted with such subtle ingenuity and sophistication that they never lose their freshness or their appeal.Rodgers' musical genius was brilliantly matched in two legendary partnerships, the first with lyricist Lorenz Hart, and the second with librettist-lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers' collaboration with these two gifted men elevated and transformed musical theater into a true and distinctive American art form.The magic of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein partnership is beautifully realized in their definitive version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. No other composer was more adept than Rodgers in translating character and plot into music.  And in &quot;Cinderella&quot; as in all of his compositions, he does so with perfect clarity, inventiveness and irresistibility.Hammerstein's ever elegant lyrics are alternately and appropriately wise, witty, rapturous, and heartbreaking. Hammerstein had an unerring understanding of the human heart which is why he is able to consistently evoke profound empathy for his characters and their predicaments.Rodgers' graceful and exceptionally beautiful score is infectious and exhilarating.  And those Rodgers waltzes- perfection, as always!&quot;Cinderella&quot; is blessed with a sterling cast including a young and very handsome Stuart Damon as the Prince.  Damon has a beautiful voice and is quite appealing.  Newcomer Lesley Anne Warren, who sounds like an angel singing, is captivating and lovely.  The maturity, intensity, and poise of her performance as Cinderella belie her tender age of 18 when this production was mounted.  Celeste Holme as the Fairy Godmother, Ginger Rogers as the Queen, and Walter Pidgeon as the King add gravity and warmth to the proceedings.  And the comedic performances of Pat Carroll, Barbara Ruick, and Jo Van Fleet as Cinderella's nasty stepsisters and stepmother, respectively, sparkle, amuse,  and delight.What more can I say?

383443,A37NL9EDUT23IV,6303646689,"takemehome ""Joey""","[3, 4]","Since, in 1965, the 1957 TV production of Cinderella starring Julie Andrews was unavailable, CBS television decided to videotape a new production in color. This version starred newcomer Lesley Ann Warren as Cinderella, as well as Stuart Damon, General Hospital's future Alan Quatermaine, as the Prince. Also in the cast were Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon as the King and Queen, Celeste Holm as the Fairy Godmother, and Jo Van Fleet as the Stepmother.In this version, The Royal Dressing Room scene is omitted, a South Pacific outtake, Loneliness Of Evening, is added, and several scenes were rewritten and rearranged. In addition, Celeste Holm's Fairy Godmother is a sweet wishgiver, whereas Edith Adams' Godmother in the 1957 production was quite sarcastic and had not previously made her fairy status known to Cinderella. However, all of these differences do not matter much. It's a charming slice of classic TV.The DVD, unfortunately, is not as charming. In 2001, dual layer technology HAD been invented, and should have been put to good use by giving more space for the show itself and maybe some more bonus features. The movie only takes up about 3.5 GB on this disc. The movie also could have used some serious remastering, and it's obvious from the style of the still frame used during the overture that an old video transfer was used for this DVD. Due to the source material, there will never be an amazing mind-blowing transfer, but this one could still be improved. In addition, the 9-minute retrospective featurette leaves you hungry for more. A lame sing-along featurette is included, as well as ""bonus"" trailers for Oliver, Annie, and Bye Bye Birdie. It would have been nice for a longer making-of documentary, maybe vintage TV spots and interviews and some photo galleries to be included.Although it's wonderful to have this movie on DVD, this DVD seriously could have been improved, and hopefully in the future, this title will be revisited and given the royal treatment that Image Entertainment gave the 1957 TV production. Until then, while a disappointing release, you MUST own it simply to own it on DVD, unless you own a video cassette of it and have the ability to record it on DVD - you'll basically get the same quality.",3,Wonderful production - disappointing DVD.,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2245,"['1965', '1957', 'TV', 'production', 'Cinderella', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'unavailable', 'CBS', 'television', 'decided', 'videotape', 'new', 'production', 'color', 'version', 'starred', 'newcomer', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Cinderella', 'as', 'well', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'General', 'Hospital', 'future', 'Alan', 'Quatermaine', 'Prince', 'Also', 'cast', 'were', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'King', 'Queen', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'Stepmother.In', 'version', 'Royal', 'Dressing', 'Room', 'scene', 'omitted', 'South', 'Pacific', 'outtake', 'Loneliness', 'Evening', 'added', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'rewritten', 'rearranged', 'addition', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'sweet', 'wishgiver', 'Edith', 'Adams', 'Godmother', '1957', 'production', 'was', 'quite', 'sarcastic', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'made', 'fairy', 'status', 'known', 'Cinderella', 'However', 'differences', 'do', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'charming', 'slice', 'classic', 'TV.The', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'charming', '2001', 'dual', 'layer', 'technology', 'HAD', 'been', 'invented', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'giving', 'more', 'space', 'show', 'maybe', 'more', 'bonus', 'features', 'movie', 'only', 'up', 'about', '3.5', 'GB', 'disc', 'movie', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'serious', 'remastering', 'obvious', 'style', 'still', 'frame', 'used', 'overture', 'old', 'video', 'transfer', 'was', 'used', 'DVD', 'Due', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'amazing', 'mind-blowing', 'transfer', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'improved', 'addition', '9-minute', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'hungry', 'more', 'lame', 'sing-along', 'featurette', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'trailers', 'Oliver', 'Annie', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Birdie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'longer', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'maybe', 'vintage', 'TV', 'spots', 'interviews', 'photo', 'galleries', 'be', 'wonderful', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'seriously', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'hopefully', 'future', 'title', 'will', 'be', 'revisited', 'given', 'royal', 'treatment', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'gave', '1957', 'TV', 'production', 'then', 'disappointing', 'release', 'MUST', 'own', 'simply', 'own', 'DVD', 'own', 'video', 'cassette', 'have', 'ability', 'record', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'basically', 'get', 'same', 'quality']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS

383445,ABX3704SXNU5F,6303646689,"Toni ""the bookworm""","[6, 6]","In order to keep from repeating all the ovations from other reviewers, I would like to critique this from the eyes of a ""little girl"" who grew up with this classic many moons ago. My sisters and I waited, with great anticipation, every year for this musical to be played on TV. Back in the 60's, you didn't have VHS or DVD recorders so you set your whole TV schedule on when ""Cinderella"" was going to be aired. Ma made us popcorn and my sisters and I snuggled up together in front of TV screen. What a great time! What great memories! We loved the magic and fantasy of the perfect love and the perfect couple with dancing and music and dresses and colors and .................well, you know the rest. If you would like to have something that is wholesome and fun and allows the innocence of childhood to be entertained, then please consider this for whatever little girl you love in your life. Many people have scoffed at the purity and absurdity of promoting a ""Prince Charming"" to their children; they want the reality of life instead. Why? Isn't childhood the only time that you can dream? They'll become adults soon enough, but until then, let them enjoy Rodgers and Hammersteins notes and lyrics, the kindness and magic of the Fairy Godmother, and all the anticipation of what lies ahead for our Cinderella and her Prince. And when you think about it, being good and having faith, does bring you a greater reward than you might realize!!",5,Still a classic!,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1442,"['order', 'keep', 'repeating', 'ovations', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'like', 'critique', 'eyes', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'classic', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'sisters', 'waited', 'great', 'anticipation', 'year', 'musical', 'be', 'played', 'TV', 'Back', '60', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'recorders', 'so', 'set', 'whole', 'TV', 'schedule', 'when', 'Cinderella', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'aired', 'Ma', 'made', 'popcorn', 'sisters', 'snuggled', 'up', 'together', 'front', 'TV', 'screen', 'What', 'great', 'time', 'What', 'great', 'memories', 'loved', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'perfect', 'love', 'perfect', 'couple', 'dancing', 'music', 'dresses', 'colors', '..well', 'know', 'rest', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'something', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'be', 'entertained', 'then', 'please', 'consider', 'little', 'girl', 'love', 'life', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'scoffed', 'purity', 'absurdity', 'promoting', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'children', 'want', 'reality', 'life', 'instead', 'Why', ""n't"", 'childhood', 'only', 'time', 'can', 'dream', ""'ll"", 'become', 'adults', 'soon', 'enough', 'then', 'let', 'enjoy', 'Rodgers', 'Hammersteins', 'notes', 'lyrics', 'kindness', 'magic', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'anticipation', 'what', 'ahead', 'Cinderella', 'Prince', 'when', 'think', 'being', 'good', 'having', 'faith', 'bring', 'greater', 'reward', 'might', 'realize']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella VHS
