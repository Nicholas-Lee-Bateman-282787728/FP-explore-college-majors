Rexford,"[1, 2]","Open All Hours is a nice slice of late 70s-early 80s british television that focuses on a stuttering, miserly shopkeeper (Ronnie Barker), his nephew (David Jason), and the shopkeeper's love interest who lives across the street. Very mild bawdy humor and enjoyably consistent characters make for a nice half-hour of amusement, but it's the subtle environment of a quieter, slower paced and simpler time that envelopes the show with a nice departure from the rushing, brash and in-your-face television that saturates our sets currently.The DVD quality was clear and clean, beyond my expectations for a show this old, and all the better for preserving this slice-of-shop-life britcom. There are only one or two extras included on the disk, one being a pilot episode introduced a couple of years before the actuall series began, but having the entire series neatly availiable on 2 disks in good color and clarity is pleasing enough.I was already familiar with the series from a PBS run over a decade ago, so it's very nice to have Open All Hours released for home viewing, and in such good condition.",5,Good DVD quality,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,1096,"['Open', 'Hours', 'nice', 'slice', 'late', '70s-early', '80s', 'british', 'television', 'stuttering', 'miserly', 'shopkeeper', 'Ronnie', 'Barker', 'nephew', 'David', 'Jason', 'shopkeeper', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'street', 'Very', 'mild', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'enjoyably', 'consistent', 'characters', 'make', 'nice', 'half-hour', 'amusement', 'subtle', 'environment', 'quieter', 'slower', 'paced', 'simpler', 'time', 'show', 'nice', 'departure', 'rushing', 'brash', 'in-your-face', 'television', 'sets', 'currently.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'clear', 'clean', 'expectations', 'show', 'old', 'better', 'preserving', 'slice-of-shop-life', 'britcom', 'are', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'extras', 'included', 'disk', 'one', 'being', 'pilot', 'episode', 'introduced', 'couple', 'years', 'actuall', 'series', 'began', 'having', 'entire', 'series', 'neatly', 'availiable', '2', 'disks', 'good', 'color', 'clarity', 'pleasing', 'enough.I', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'series', 'PBS', 'run', 'decade', 'ago', 'very', 'nice', 'have', 'Open', 'All', 'Hours', 'released', 'home', 'viewing', 'such', 'good', 'condition']",N/A

Instead of drawn out, overpriced, single series releases we get the entire program of 4 series (25 episodes) at once this time at a reasonable price!  Special features are to include the pilot which aired as an episode of the 1973 series ""Seven of One"".Written by Roy Clarke (""Last of the Summer Wine"", ""Keeping Up Appearances"") the series takes place primarily in a small grocer's shop, in Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, a middle-aged, tight-fisted man, will stop at nothing to keep his profits high and his overhead low. He has a pronounced stammer and a knack of being able to sell anything. His put upon nephew is his errand boy, whose attempts at a love-life or even just a social life fall flat. He blames his uncle that he has to be up early to open the shop and stay late to close it.Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, Arkwright's long-standing fianc&eacute;e, and only weakness, lives across the road. Arkwright spends an inordinate amount of time attempting to make her marry, or at least sleep with him.The primary characters in the series are:Ronnie Barker (Porridge) - Arkwright, the shop ownerDavid Jason (Only Fools and Horses) - Granville, his nephewLynda Baron - Nurse Gladys EmmanuelKeep your eyes open for Kathy Staff (Last Of the Summer Wine) and Stephanie Cole (Waiting For God) as customers.Sometimes quaint, sometimes dark, and always with that dry British humor and penchant for the double entendre this is another in a string of fabulously funny sitcoms from across the pond!",4,All at once!,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,1634,"['Open', 'Hours', '1976', '1985', '8', 'Britian', 'Best', 'Sitcom', 'list', 'poll', 'conducted', '2004', 'BBC', 'ITV', 'Channel', '4', 'Instead', 'drawn', 'overpriced', 'single', 'series', 'get', 'entire', 'program', '4', 'series', '25', 'episodes', 'once', 'time', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'include', 'pilot', 'aired', 'episode', '1973', 'series', 'Seven', 'One', '.Written', 'Roy', 'Clarke', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'series', 'place', 'primarily', 'small', 'grocer', 'shop', 'Doncaster', 'South', 'Yorkshire', 'owner', 'middle-aged', 'tight-fisted', 'man', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'keep', 'profits', 'high', 'overhead', 'low', 'pronounced', 'stammer', 'knack', 'being', 'able', 'sell', 'anything', 'put', 'nephew', 'errand', 'boy', 'attempts', 'love-life', 'even', 'just', 'social', 'life', 'fall', 'flat', 'uncle', 'be', 'up', 'early', 'open', 'shop', 'stay', 'late', 'close', 'it.Nurse', 'Gladys', 'Emmanuel', 'Arkwright', 'long-standing', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'only', 'weakness', 'road', 'Arkwright', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'attempting', 'make', 'marry', 'least', 'sleep', 'him.The', 'primary', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'Ronnie', 'Barker', 'Porridge', 'Arkwright', 'shop', 'Jason', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', 'Granville', 'nephewLynda', 'Baron', 'Nurse', 'Gladys', 'EmmanuelKeep', 'eyes', 'open', 'Kathy', 'Staff', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'Waiting', 'God', 'customers.Sometimes', 'quaint', 'sometimes', 'dark', 'always', 'dry', 'British', 'humor', 'penchant', 'double', 'entendre', 'string', 'fabulously', 'funny', 'sitcoms', 'pond']",N/A

At times the antics with his lover the nurse gets a tad old but those moments are few and far between.  There are four DVDs in this set and for the cost this is a fair value.A word of caution.  Much of the humor is based on the shopkeeper's (Barker) speech impediment.  Watching this over and over does make one ask the question - is it fair game to use someone's impediment as the focus of humor?  Will it be funny if one uses say Parkinson disease and its tremors as a source of humor?  How about a blind person?  How about someone having a seizure? My point is this may offend some folks and it is best to be warned before coughing up a significant amount for this product.  I have always found that using a person's ""handicap"" as a source of humor just does not feel right.  Why? Because it seems like a desperate attempt to get a laugh when the material is bereft of substance.I for one find this series somewhat funny but not in the same class of say, ""Are You Being Served"" and definitely not even half as good as ""Yes Prime Minister"" and miles below ""Last of the Summer Wine"".",3,Another classic British sitcom.

1235523,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B001T21R6Y,Mr. Mambo,"[27, 28]","I am very glad to see that this hilarious series is finally out on DVD here in our US region. I would rate this as easily one of the top twelve Brit coms of all time (my other favorites being Fawlty Towers, Last of the Summer Wine, The Young Ones, If Wishes Were Horses, Little Britain, Absolutely Fabulous, Are You Being Served, Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Goes By, One Foot in the Grave, and Waiting for God).Ronnie Barker does a magnificent job as shopkeeper Arkwright, a stout, middle-aged proprietor of a small grocery in an unnamed Yorkshire town. After watching about thirty seconds of Episode 1 you will realize that (1) he has an extremely amusing stuttering habit; (2) he is notoriously tightfisted and (3) he lusts after his neighbor, the plain but amply-proportioned Nurse Gladys Emmanuel. What makes the show for me are the wonderful conversations between the--let's be honest here--very horny Arkwright and the resistant Gladys. He's constantly on the offensive, and nurse Gladys, a single woman caring for her invalid mother, puts up a good fight (she's neither naive nor a prude, and though she'd never admit it, she unconsciously welcomes the attention that this aging would-be lover showers upon her). Of course, the parsimonious Arkwright is very reluctant to open up the wallet too wide, even for the nurse. But as you will see, the promise of a kiss and a caress wins out.This show is at least thirty years old, but it holds up well. The English, and Europeans in general, have long been much more tolerant of race than us Yanks, and also do not seem anywhere near as hung up about sex. Consequently you have in Arkwright and nurse Gladys a couple of physically unspectacular middle-aged people who DO--particularly Arkwright--think about sex and pursue it. In US shows if you are not beautiful and/or extremely young, you have no sex life.American viewers will have to listen carefully lest they miss some of the absolutely devastating double entendres which come out of the mouth of Arkwright.

Down to the show, the writing is superb, the delivery sublime and the chemistry amazing between stuffy old tightwad Arkwright and his ""young"" nephew Gehger, Geguh, G-Granville.Speaking of which, the Amazon review misses the point slightly - Granville isn't literally supposed to be a teenager. Maybe the reviewer hasn't seen many episodes but it's definitely an intentional joke on the part of the older characters and Granville often laments being the world's oldest shopboy. Similarly Arkwright's stuttering is not a mean joke at sufferers' expense but a knowing and ironic comment on both the character of Arkwright's fiscally sharp tongue and cagey ways and an ironic wink from one of the best examples of great dialogue on television.For me this is the defining performance/character from the brilliant Ronnie Barker.

After being shown in the US on various tv stations over the years, the show seemed to vanish. With 1 vhs USA release with a few sampled episodes released years ago, we are at last graced with the release of the complete series in one set. NOW.The humor is not forced with this show. It could happen to anyone, and probably has! It is a show that doesn't rely on slapstick or crude humor. The show has a certain 'grace', that with each episode the viewer almost believes he/she is watching 2 shop keepers making do with each day.The acting is, and in my opinion, IS superb.I won't compare this show to the many others from Britain that the USA had the chance to watch over the years, as this show is in a place of it's own.
