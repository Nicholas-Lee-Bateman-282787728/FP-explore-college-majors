1041688,A2SJAZZBJR2MHX,B000LXHFNG,Angela Gray,"[1, 1]","One of the great disappointments of my childhood is that I never learned to double dutch.One of the great things about the Jump In DVD is that it shows you how to jump double dutch.  The movie itself goes a ways to both demystify double dutch, and show it off in spectacular ways.Corbin Bleu and Keke Palmer are good spoilers for each other.  He's a little Disney, and she's a little ghetto.  You end up rooting for both of them together.We wanted to watch this movie over and over in my house; it appealed to the boys as well as girls, and that's hard to do.  It had the boxing, and the cool jumping moves that excited everyone.It was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't about hooking up or anything sensual at all.  Free from all that garbage, you could just sit back and gawk at the beautiful hair braids, the flashy costumes, and watch the incredible jump rope moves to the booming sound tracks.  There were ear to ear grins at my house, as we kept rewinding to see that last cool move.  That made it one of the 7 happiest black movies of all times.",5,Loved that double dutch movie,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,1055,"['One', 'great', 'disappointments', 'childhood', 'never', 'learned', 'double', 'dutch.One', 'great', 'things', 'Jump', 'DVD', 'how', 'jump', 'double', 'dutch', 'movie', 'ways', 'demystify', 'double', 'dutch', 'show', 'off', 'spectacular', 'ways.Corbin', 'Bleu', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'are', 'good', 'spoilers', 'other', 'little', 'Disney', 'little', 'ghetto', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'house', 'appealed', 'boys', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'hard', 'do', 'had', 'boxing', 'cool', 'jumping', 'moves', 'excited', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'hooking', 'up', 'anything', 'sensual', 'Free', 'garbage', 'could', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'gawk', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'braids', 'flashy', 'costumes', 'watch', 'incredible', 'jump', 'rope', 'booming', 'sound', 'tracks', 'were', 'ear', 'ear', 'grins', 'house', 'kept', 'rewinding', 'see', 'last', 'cool', 'move', 'made', 'one', '7', 'happiest', 'black', 'movies', 'times']",Jump In!

Wuebker ""Actually, it's Katie""","[1, 8]","This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.Overall, an ""okay"" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, ""Push It To The Limit"", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half.",2,Fluff.

1041697,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000LXHFNG,Mark Baker,"[5, 6]","All Izzy Daniels (Corbin Bleu) knows is boxing.  He's the third generation boxer in his family and hopes to be the third to win the coveted Golden Glove.  After defeating neighborhood bully Rodney (Patrick Johnson, Jr.), he's well on his way.Izzy's neighbor has an obsession all her own - Double Dutch jump rope.  Mary (Keke Palmer) is quite good at it and the leader of a team trying to make the state competition.  Izzy constantly teases Mary and her team mates about their jumping.All that changes one day when Izzy is forced to take his sister to watch a Double Dutch competition.  He's fascinated by what he sees.  When Mary's team looses one of their members, Izzy agrees to step in while they search for another member but only to help them practice.  He quickly finds that, not only is he good at it, but he loves it.  Even more then boxing.  Can he balance the two sports?  Does he want to?  What will his dad say when he finds out about it?There's not doubt that this movie is modeled after High School Musical.  Not only does it have similar (but not identical) plot points, but it even stars Corbin Bleu.  But that's not to say this is a bad film.  While I knew where the story was going, I was still drawn into events.  The cast all does a good job acting.  And the Double Dutch scenes were choreographed so well.  They were fun to watch.This is definitely a movie trying to cash in on the success of High School Musical.  But that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.  It's an entertaining movie in it's own right.",4,Another Fun Movie for Tweens,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,1529,"['Izzy', 'Daniels', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'boxing', 'third', 'generation', 'boxer', 'family', 'be', 'third', 'win', 'coveted', 'Golden', 'Glove', 'defeating', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'Rodney', 'Patrick', 'Johnson', 'Jr.', 'well', 'way.Izzy', 'neighbor', 'obsession', 'own', 'Double', 'Dutch', 'jump', 'rope', 'Mary', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'quite', 'good', 'leader', 'team', 'trying', 'make', 'state', 'competition', 'Izzy', 'constantly', 'Mary', 'team', 'mates', 'jumping.All', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Izzy', 'forced', 'take', 'sister', 'watch', 'Double', 'Dutch', 'competition', 'fascinated', 'what', 'When', 'Mary', 'team', 'one', 'members', 'Izzy', 'step', 'search', 'member', 'only', 'help', 'practice', 'quickly', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'Even', 'more', 'then', 'boxing', 'Can', 'balance', 'two', 'sports', 'want', 'What', 'will', 'dad', 'say', 'when', 'out', 'not', 'doubt', 'movie', 'modeled', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'similar', 'not', 'identical', 'plot', 'points', 'even', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'knew', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'still', 'drawn', 'events', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'Double', 'Dutch', 'scenes', 'were', 'choreographed', 'so', 'well', 'were', 'fun', 'watch.This', 'definitely', 'movie', 'trying', 'cash', 'success', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'own', 'right']",Jump In!
