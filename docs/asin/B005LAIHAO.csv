Bruce Willis was finally given an opportunity to correct the many many (15) years of unforgivably awful movies he starred in and... he dies in the first 20 minutes!  How can this be?  His character was perfect too!  He was a fiesty ruthless govenment advisor with a dark history, a perfect chance for more of his character to develop!  Shades of his better days a couple decades ago before he went down the wrong path and attempted horror, comedy and dressed up as a cheerleader on the David Letterman Show but... he dies.  *pounds ground*  Nooo!!!!!Alright, so it's disappointing that Bruce had a chance to redeem himself but for storyline purposes, it just isn't happening.  It's also rare that such a big name actor is killed off in such a surprising way.  He even appeared to be the main star in the movie.  The good news is that Bruce Willis doesn't make this movie alone- Henry Cavill plays a pretty good role as a man on the run.  His father is Bruce's character and he has absolutely no idea why his father was suddenly shot in the middle of the night in Spain during a vacation.  Before getting shot however, Henry asks his father all kinds of questions pertaining to a violent outburst a moment earlier that involves Bruce helping Henry escape from a potentially life or death jam, but Bruce refuses to answer any of them.Basically Henry spends the entire time running down city streets, avoiding gunfire of the bad guys (Sigourney Weaver in particular) and looking for an explanation what happened to his father, as well as saving his kidnapped family.  Along the way Henry meets up with an attractive woman by the name of Veronica Echegui and it turns out she knew Henry's father really well, so a partnership is born.This is your typical ""run and gun"" high-octane suspense with car chases, gun shootings, etc.  The storyline is perhaps the weakest point since it never builds up any of the family members so we really have no reason to care if they live or die.  That could have been corrected had the movie been at least 20 minutes longer, but... that's that problem- it's too short.  85 minutes.  Still, even though it gets sort of chaotic after the halfway point as far as who's on Henry's side and who's not, it picks up remarkably well as soon as Sigourney Weaver plays a more significant role near the end.  A REALLY good action-packed period of excitement there.  It is hilarious how Sigourney plays it really calm and cool while guns are firing all around her, lol.

The main character is a man down on his luck forced into a family vacation that turns into a run for his life and a desperate attempt to save his family.

1469561,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHAO,Chris Kennison,"[5, 7]","I'm not sure I can explain ""The Cold Light of Day"", not knowing the inside story as to why the movie was made or how it was made with the likes of Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver. I do know that the lead actor in the film is Henry Cavill, who will soon be playing the lead role in the Superman movie ""Man of Steel"". As far as Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver go, this is what they call in the business, a paycheck or favor movie. As far as Cavill goes, my only assumption is that the studio, Warner Brothers, wanted to get Cavill's face out there before ""Man of Steel"" happened. I'm not sure ""The Cold Light of Day"" did them any favors.Cavill, I'm sure is a fine actor, but given the material here, he is an after thought in the midst of poor filming, poor direction, poor scripting and just an overall train wreck of a film. Cavill plays Will, a small business owner who goes on vacation to see his family in Madrid, all the while receiving phone calls galore about his business sliding into bankruptcy back home. This is just one of the pointless and irrelevant plot points.After accidentally tackling his brother's girlfriend on the boat and knocking her head into a railing, he decides to go to town for some pointless reason. I think it was to get ointment for the gash on her head. So, he dives into the water and swims to shore, leaving his family behind. When he returns, the family boat is gone and the spy, terrorist thriller begins. At this point, he looks out into the straight where his family boat should be, from the beach and sees nothing. Then we have to endure a ridiculous long pan from his view across a bunch of people and eventually the camera lands on Will's stunned face after what had to be a twenty second shot. After about five seconds, I sighed, as we endure another ten seconds of irrelevant stuff. This is the kind of stuff that plagues the film.Moments later, as the ""Taken"", ""Bourne Legacy"" wannabe film goes into full swing, we have to endure a four or five minute scene with terrible lighting. There are scenes in the film where all of a sudden, Will is just somewhere. We don't know how he got there or why he got there, but of course moments later, he was supposed to be there.The scripting is terrible. Will, at one-point yells to a man at the American embassy, ""My families missing and I'm wanted for a murder I didn't commit!""I don't know what ""The Cold Light of Day"" was intended to be. Was it a vehicle for Cavill so that people could see his face before ""Man of Steel""? Was it intended to be good or was it thrown together. I'm not sure, but the bottom line is, the movie was terribly done. There are too many characters and there are too many things that don't matter. There are unreasonable plateau's between Will meeting people and them helping or hurting him. Bottom line, just because a movie has Bruce Willis in it, doesn't mean its good. Willis did do ""Hudson Hawk"" after all.",1,"GREAT actors on hand, but a terrible screenplay and a bad director",1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2928,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'explain', 'Cold', 'Light', 'Day', 'not', 'knowing', 'inside', 'story', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'likes', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'do', 'know', 'lead', 'actor', 'film', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Man', 'Steel', 'As', 'far', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'go', 'what', 'call', 'business', 'paycheck', 'favor', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'Cavill', 'only', 'assumption', 'studio', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'wanted', 'get', 'Cavill', 'face', 'there', 'Man', 'Steel', 'happened', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Cold', 'Light', 'Day', 'did', 'favors.Cavill', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fine', 'actor', 'given', 'material', 'here', 'thought', 'midst', 'poor', 'filming', 'poor', 'direction', 'poor', 'scripting', 'just', 'overall', 'train', 'wreck', 'film', 'Cavill', 'Will', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'vacation', 'see', 'family', 'Madrid', 'while', 'receiving', 'phone', 'galore', 'business', 'sliding', 'bankruptcy', 'back', 'home', 'just', 'one', 'pointless', 'irrelevant', 'plot', 'points.After', 'accidentally', 'tackling', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'boat', 'knocking', 'head', 'railing', 'go', 'town', 'pointless', 'reason', 'think', 'was', 'get', 'ointment', 'gash', 'head', 'So', 'water', 'swims', 'shore', 'leaving', 'family', 'When', 'family', 'boat', 'gone', 'spy', 'terrorist', 'thriller', 'point', 'out', 'straight', 'where', 'family', 'boat', 'should', 'be', 'beach', 'nothing', 'Then', 'have', 'endure', 'ridiculous', 'long', 'pan', 'view', 'bunch', 'people', 'eventually', 'camera', 'Will', 'stunned', 'face', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'twenty', 'second', 'shot', 'five', 'seconds', 'sighed', 'endure', 'ten', 'seconds', 'irrelevant', 'stuff', 'kind', 'stuff', 'film.Moments', 'later', 'Taken', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'wannabe', 'film', 'full', 'swing', 'have', 'endure', 'four', 'five', 'minute', 'scene', 'terrible', 'lighting', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'sudden', 'Will', 'just', 'somewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', 'got', 'there', 'course', 'moments', 'later', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'there.The', 'scripting', 'terrible', 'Will', 'one-point', 'yells', 'man', 'American', 'embassy', 'families', 'missing', ""'m"", 'wanted', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Cold', 'Light', 'Day', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'Was', 'vehicle', 'Cavill', 'people', 'could', 'see', 'face', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Was', 'intended', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'terribly', 'done', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'are', 'unreasonable', 'plateau', 'Will', 'meeting', 'people', 'helping', 'hurting', 'Bottom', 'line', 'just', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'Willis', 'did', 'do', 'Hudson', 'Hawk']",N/A

This is certainly not one of Bruce Willis at his best, and the entire cast of acting was not to exciting. Will Shaw takes a trip to Spain for a family vacation to go sailing for a week. But, all hell breaks loose when his family is kidnapped by intelligence agents, who are anxious in recovering a mysterious briefcase, and he finds himself on the run.

THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY has the feeling of a tryout for a television series (note the lines at movie's end when strangely, Colm Meaney addresses Henry Cavill with the concept that perhaps Cavill has performed his mission so well that he consider taking on a new life job...). The story as written by Scott Wiper and John Petro is flimsy and the direction by Mabrouk El Mechri is incompetent, yet despite this the film holds our attention throughout its 93 minutes of lack of substantial plot. The reason may just be that finally we get the opportunity to look at the handsome Henry Cavill for an hour and a half.Will (Henry Cavill) is reunited with his family (Bruce Willis, father Martin, Carolyn Goodall, mother Laurie, Rafi Gavron, brother Josh, and Emma Hamilton, Josh's girlfriend Dara) in Spain for a vacation, though he is absentminded because of work issues back in USA: is small business has gone bankrupt. On a family outing on a sailboat Dara is injured and Will returns from a short trip to get supplies only to find the boat and his entire family missing. Someone has apparently kidnapped them and holding them hostage. It turns out that Will's father is not who he believes him to be. With the stakes high over a mysterious briefcase, it becomes a chase of cat and mouse without knowing whom to trust. Will discovers things about his family - his CIA agent father had an illegitimate daughter Lucia (Ver&oacute;nica Echegui) who of course is Will's sister, and his father was involved in a scheme with agent Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) and her sidekick Gorman (Joseph Mawle). The rest of the film is chase scenes with Will and Lucia in constant danger from Currack and apparently Israeli terrorists.Of course you know how it is all going to end before it is barely started. The script is very thin, the direction is a bit silly, but the personalities on the screen hold it all together on their looks and their chops.  Not a bad film, not a good film, but worth an escapist watch on VOD.

It seems he is just selling his name to the movie producers.  Ditto for Sigourney Weaver, although she does hang around until the end of the show, she pops in and out as needed, trying to look and act convincing as a stone-cold spy mistress.  She gives a ridiculous performance.Otherwise, no-talent actors, uninteresting plot, and a couple obligatory car chases, probably filmed only for the purpose of making the trailer.  Made on the cheap in Spain.________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.

1469601,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAIHAO,Robert Badgley,"[2, 4]","The Cold Light of Day(released Apr/12)stars Henry Cavill as Will Shaw,Sigourney Weaver as Jean Carrack,Bruce Willis as Martin Shaw and others.The film is an intriguing drama with good performances all around,and that includes Cavill,the lead character,who I think has a promising career ahead if he keeps up the good work I witnessed in this film.The story finds Cavill visiting his family in the Costa Del Sol region of Spain,from San Fran.He and his father Willis seem to have a strained relationship and Cavill is in not such a good humour,as he receives a phone call telling him his business has gone bankrupt.Next day the family goes out for a cruise in their sailboat.When a mishap on board occurs Cavill swims ashore to get some antibiotics.When he returns for the swim back,the boat is no where to be seen.He climbs a promontory and spies the boat sitting in a cove not too far away.Getting aboard he finds it to be deserted.He returns to shore and the police take him to a deserted area and introduce him to a man who asks him to come with them.He refuses,commandeers a police car and flees for his life.The pursuit ends when Cavill is run off the road and into a tree.As a cop puts a beating on him Willis pops out of nowhere and subdues the cop.Both father and son flee and Willis comes clean as to his real profession.It seems he works for a secret branch of the CIA,but can tell him little more.Willis has a rendezvous with Weaver,a fellow agent.They talk of a suitcase that Willis retrieved for her,but now he wants back to give to the people that he took it from,to save his family who are being held captive.Weaver is reluctant buts says she will see what she can do.As Willis gets back in the car,shots ring out and Willis falls dead.Retrieving his fathers gun and cell phone Cavill takes off.Cavill is chased through the Madrid streets in car and on foot.A cop is killed by the sniper which looks like Cavill did it,so he is also wanted by the cops.Cavill manages to get to the US Embassy where he meets up with Weaver and the sniper who tried to kill him,in a car outside.He gets in the car but realizes if he stays he is going to end up like his father.He feigns imminent sickness to get out then runs for it.Cavill uses his dads cell phone to call a person called Diego that pops up on his screen quite often.A girl on the other end, directs him to her location but the sniper is there waiting.A tussle ensues and they flee to her uncle Diego's apartment.They find her uncle dead,and Weaver and the sniper are awaiting his arrival,and the convo isn't going amicably.The girl enters and starts blasting which gives she and Cavill a chance to escape to the rooftop.From there they land at a local club whose owner is friends with Diego.Cavill has been wounded in the escape and they help patch him up.During their brief time there Cavill learns that the girl is actually his sister!He also gets a phone call by the kidnappers of his family demanding to talk with Willis.He tells them what has happened to him and he arranges to meet with them.He finds his family still alive and these men all Israeli agents.Willis took the briefcase from them,and they thought he was a rogue agent.It turns out now Willis was just under orders from Weaver,who is the real rogue.The trick now is to retrieve the briefcase,because if they don't Weaver and company will keep hunting Cavill and his family down until they are dead.Right now the family is safe under Israeli custody.At the nightclub the sniper comes looking for Cavill,and the owner and his men are waiting for him.They subdue and beat him but he won't confess to anything.However he escapes and they follow him right back to Weaver who has the briefcase and the sale of it is going down to terrorists in a parking garage.Cavill and an Israeli agent argue and Weaver hears their commotion.She and the sniper shoot the terrorists and flee.The sniper is killed in the chase through Madrid streets and Weaver tries to first outrun Cavill and his""new"" sister.Along the way the tables are turned and all three end up in a terrible crash.Weaver manages to get out of her vehicle first,suitcase in hand,and is about to deal the coup de' gras when she is hit behind and killed by an Israeli agent.The film ends as Cavill and his family are reunited.A US agent offers Cavill a job like his dad but refuses.Cavill's mother and brother go on to introduce themselves to their new daughter/sister.Admittedly there is alot of story to tell here but the pace,editing and drama keep you interested all the way through.I found very few slow ups and just enough twists and turns to keep it all interesting.Mention just has to be made for attention to details in this film,which you rarely see anymore in movies these days.When someone has a vehicular accident in this film,bystanders actually see it,react to it and come over to help.Most films a crash occurs and bystanders,if they are even see,react with little or no emotion let alone actually come to help.Another thing is as little as a car door being opened and left open.In reality your key causes a dinging sound to be heard.In this film you actually hear it,but in most movies you usually hear nothing.I LIKED that aspect of the film.It just made it seem more real and relevant.Bruce Willis is again on game in his relatively smaller part,as is a wonderful appearance by Sigourney ""Alien"" Weaver,whom I do not see enough of these days.Also watch for a too brief appearance by one of my favourite DS9(Star Trek-Deep Space Nine)folks,Colm Meaney;yet ANOTHER actor I see too little of.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a quite good action drama,whose pace,attention to detail and and good solid acting by all,will have you riveted the whole way through.Kudos to Cavill for bringing it to the table.Recommended.",4,A very pleasing action drama!,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,5891,"['Cold', 'Light', 'Day', 'released', 'Apr/12', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Will', 'Shaw', 'Sigourney',

1469606,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005LAIHAO,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 3]","You know a thriller is in serious trouble when the picteure-esque scenery is far more enthralling than the action scenes on screen. So goes the generic espionage potboiler the Cold Light of Day. The latest showcase for would-be British leading man Henry Cavill, that will leave you thinking to yourself that this guy will be forgotten, once...wait, what was his name again.Cavill, if you don't already know, will be seen next summer as the man of steel, so this vehicle, along with last year's lackluster Immortals are to familiarize audiences with him. You know kind of the way that the Recruit and Daredevil stalled the once promising career of Collin Farrell. Here, Cavill stars as Will Shaw, a man of anything but steel, on a week long boating vacation with a family that he seems to despise. When wouldn't you know it, mom (Caroline Goodall) and little brother Josh (Rafi Gaven) along with his girlfriend (Emma Hamilton) are all abducted by an unseen terrorist group. Pops (Bruce Willis) comes clean to Will about his real day job, he's not a cultural attach&eacute;, but a CIA operative, so there plan seems to be to get some quality father-son bonding time in while getting the fam back.This movie is as ludicrous as it sounds, and strangely enough it sounds to me just like an ancient Gen Hackman-Matt Dillon flick called Target. The narrative is obvious, far-fetched and mindless in a way that will make your head hurt and your brain angry.This all plays out as a sort of Taken, Jr., or maybe it's aim is as a cross between the Bourne films and the Spy Kids movies.At least the picture is set in a lovely Spain setting instead of Bulgaria or Yugoslavia, like so many actioners these days. The cinematography by Remi Andefarsijn, who also shot the gorgeous looking HBO mini-series Band of Brothers and  the Pacific, is something short of wonderful. Anderfarsjin manages to make the Cold Light of Day the best looking action movie I can remember this year, it's just such a damn shame that it is in the service of one of the most pedestrian.Directed by Mabrouk El Mechri, who's previous film was the critically esteemed JCVD. I didn't like that movie very much as I felt it reduced it's star and subject, action icon Jean-Claude Van Damme, to a whiney, self-loathing and an utterly embarrassing joke. Audiences seemed to know better and stayed away, I wrote at the time of it's release  that the same people who liked this film, were the same people who didn't like any of Van Damme's other movies. Now El Mechri has returned with another obnoxious movie with even more poorly staged action scenes, car chases, plot twists you'll see before you walk through the theater door and bland heroes. Action movies clearly are not his forte, and based on this evidence I would say that El Mechri has a distain for the genre, but I`m also not sure he has the skill or style for anything else. It almost seems like a curse, the one thing he has talent for he despises.Bruce Willis at least makes getting old look good, actually he manages to make it look cool, settling in quite well these days playing an older version of his well liked screen persona. Here, almighty Bruce gets to show he is still in full command of his bad assery, even more so than in recent titles like the Expendables 2 and the over hyped Red. However, he is not the star here, no matter what the marketing tries to lead you to believe, in fact he makes a none too unexpected, but no less unsatisfactory early exit. Leaving the picture in the hands of Cavill.Cavill is an intense, serious looking presence, with chiseled features and an action hero's physique, all that he is missing is charisma. Which is something no action star can do without, as we've seen before, actually acting chops are far more optional. As a leading man, he is just too colorless and prosaic, let's hope that things get better for him before sporting Superman`s cape. He makes a uninteresting film move at an even more lumbering pace.Sigourney Weaver, a class act and legendary movie star, is at her worst I have ever seen or even thought I would see from such a veteran talent,  Giving an entirely unconvincing performance  playing Jean Carrack, Willis' former partner, for the first half of the movie it's a badly kept secret that she's actually the villain. Part of the reason it is so badly kept is that Weaver plays the role as a villain from the get go. It's not that's she not a believable villain, she mostly plays villains these days, and it is certainty not that she can't pull off action roles. It is just such a badly written role that she has no idea what to do with it, she is saddled with some of the movie's worst dialogue, but also gets it's biggest laughs.  Then before it is all over, Weaver manages to morph into an unstoppable terminatrax.The seemingly endless car chases are at least givinen a little spunk by Valerio Bonelli's crisp editing which at least has trepidation if not suspense or successful audience involvement. Likewise Lucas Vidal's score does more to highlight the movie's lack of tension than to underline it.This kind of trite will only appeal to the least discriminating of action movie spectators, like last year's turkey Killer Elite. This one lacks the exhilarating spirit of earlier, much beloved action adventures, it's tedious and horribly boring too boot. This all goes on for what seems like hours, but in all actuality is just over ninety minutes. Once Willis exits the movie, at about the twenty or thirty minute mark, however, many viewers will find little to further their interest. If the Cold Light of Day proves anything it's that Cavill is no substitute for Bruce Willis.check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,generic espionage potboiler with a brief appearance by

The son, Will (Henry Cavill) is spending a lot of time on his cell phone as he just got a call his company is bankrupt. In spite of the sad violin music, they didn't bother to develop his character at this early point for me to care. Later, his brother Josh (Rafi Gavron), Dara (Emma Hamilton) and mom (Caroline Goodall) are kidnapped and ransomed. We discover Dad, Martin Shaw (Bruce Willis) is in the CIA. He and son Will must find a way to save their family in 24 hours. The kidnappers are demanding the return of a briefcase that Willis doesn't have, one that his case worker Jean Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) has already turned in.Yes, that would have been a great movie, except Willis doesn't get paid past the first 20 minutes and Cavill has to outrun horses and defeat the bad guys alone. So let's see, he doesn't trust the CIA. The police are after him for a murder he didn't commit. Armed with his dad's cell phone and enlisting the help of some movie eye candy (Ver&oacute;nica Echegui), Will sets out to save his family. Pretty standard stuff and then we get to the expected twist. At this juncture, the movie almost caught my interest, except that Henry Cavill never becomes convincing in this role. Instead of Henry being a stock broker, they should have made him a karate instructor, or an Olympic marksman giving him a skill he could use...No wait! He did use the cell phone.F-bombs.

But the movie itself, while enjoyable to watch, just never really told you anything.
