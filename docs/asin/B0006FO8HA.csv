866294,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006FO8HA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","I was very surprised by this film.  It was not this exceptionally funny film that will be remembered forever, nor was it this pre-teen comedy that prided itself on sexual humor and bathroom jokes, but instead a solid comedy about friends and their tribulations in the forest.  The comedy in this film was strong, providing some very funny moments and some humorous lines provided by actors that seemed genuinely interested in making this film.  There seemed to be a strong connection between our three actors as they played off each other exceptionally well.  What really impressed me about this film was not just the sporadic comedy that was top-notch when applied well, but also the story.  You don't see stories like this as often as you would like.  The 80s were classic for bringing a group of actors together to fight the elements of nature, but lately it seems that sex and drugs sell stronger.  While there was plenty of this in Without a Paddle, it wasn't the major theme.  The powers of friendship, the influences that it has on your life, and the effects of maturity when in a hostile environment were all major elements to this film.  It was like The Great Outdoors meets The Goonies created in 2004.  This is not a bad little combination that, despite the enormous pitfalls in the story line, played quite decent.The actors in this film were not comedy genius', but the did know how to make you laugh and that worked for me.  Seth Green was the standout performer in this film as his character provided some of the wittiest lines as well as hysterical physical humor throughout the film.  Green did a fantastic job with Mott, giving him not only several layers, but also this genuine feel of friendship.  That is what impressed me the most with Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, and Dax Shepard, they seemed genuine in their delivery.  Nothing seemed forced or to controlling with these guys.  Their ability to deliver some very funny lines while trying to keep a jigsaw puzzle of a story together was a great accomplishment.  Without the incredibly perfect casting in this film, I do believe it would not have worked.  Green's delivery, Lillard's emotion, and Shepard's physical humor embodied the core elements of comedy for this film.  They each carried Without a Paddle on their shoulders and with pride.  Also, I have to give credit to the supporting cast as well.  Burt Reynolds did a great job as the little guy that helps this band of yuppies to their final destination, as well as Ethan Suplee and Abraham Benrubi who were perfectly cast as the rednecks of the woods.  While Deliverance was a running gag throughout the film, I thought that these actors created something unique and worthwhile on their own.  The recreated a dying genre of wooded comedy and while they did not create perfection, they did a great job trying.Sadly, the actors couldn't do everything.  The gaping plot holes created by Fred Wolf and Harris Goldberg were devastating.  It literally ripped this film to shreds.  The ability to get from point A to point B seemed to be a challenge for the writers of this film.  While they were able to pull it off in the end, you could tell that they were having some trouble.  There just seemed to be too many ""What the ..."" combined with ""Whosa what..."" to make the story stand on its own.  With the help of MTV, they were able to cover some up by using songs from the 80s to divert us into a new direction.  For me, it just didn't cut it.  The ending was laughable, and not in the comedy sense, but in the ""the writers had to wrap this up quickly"" sense.  This was my biggest problem with this film was the story.  It felt as if there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do so.  Maybe it was the final editing, but you finished this film feeling like you missed a big chunk of the action.Overall, this was a decent little movie that had me laughing at some parts while waiting for others to end.  Seth Green fans will be highly impressed with his role in this film and definitely show that he needs to continue to get more work to improve this great gift.  The comedy delivered by the actors is a great blend of 80s humor without the sex and drug jokes.  I felt I wasn't being demeaned or my intelligence squandered on this film, but instead it kind of made me think of my youth and friends.  The story was, in all honesty, horrible.  I don't think the writers had a good grip on this film and therefore it suffered.  For those interested in seeing this film, I think the acting is worth checking out, but the story could have been tweaked a couple more times.  Not bad, but very far from perfection.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Thanks for breaking glass where my kids play.,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,4671,"['was', 'very', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'exceptionally', 'funny', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever', 'was', 'pre-teen', 'comedy', 'prided', 'sexual', 'humor', 'bathroom', 'jokes', 'instead', 'solid', 'comedy', 'friends', 'tribulations', 'forest', 'comedy', 'film', 'was', 'strong', 'providing', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'humorous', 'lines', 'provided', 'actors', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'making', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'strong', 'connection', 'three', 'actors', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'What', 'really', 'impressed', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'sporadic', 'comedy', 'was', 'top-notch', 'when', 'applied', 'well', 'also', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'stories', 'like', 'as', 'often', 'would', 'like', '80s', 'were', 'classic', 'bringing', 'group', 'actors', 'together', 'fight', 'elements', 'nature', 'lately', 'sex', 'drugs', 'sell', 'stronger', 'was', 'plenty', 'Paddle', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'theme', 'powers', 'friendship', 'influences', 'life', 'effects', 'maturity', 'when', 'hostile', 'environment', 'were', 'major', 'elements', 'film', 'was', 'Great', 'Outdoors', 'Goonies', 'created', '2004', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'combination', 'enormous', 'pitfalls', 'story', 'line', 'played', 'quite', 'decent.The', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'comedy', 'genius', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'laugh', 'worked', 'Seth', 'Green', 'was', 'standout', 'performer', 'film', 'character', 'provided', 'wittiest', 'lines', 'as', 'well', 'hysterical', 'physical', 'humor', 'film', 'Green', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Mott', 'giving', 'not', 'only', 'several', 'layers', 'also', 'genuine', 'feel', 'friendship', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'seemed', 'genuine', 'delivery', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'forced', 'controlling', 'guys', 'ability', 'deliver', 'very', 'funny', 'lines', 'trying', 'keep', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'story', 'together', 'was', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'incredibly', 'perfect', 'casting', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'Green', 'delivery', 'Lillard', 'emotion', 'Shepard', 'physical', 'humor', 'embodied', 'core', 'elements', 'comedy', 'film', 'carried', 'Paddle', 'shoulders', 'pride', 'Also', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'supporting', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'little', 'guy', 'band', 'yuppies', 'final', 'destination', 'as', 'well', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Abraham', 'Benrubi', 'who', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'rednecks', 'woods', 'Deliverance', 'was', 'running', 'gag', 'film', 'thought', 'actors', 'created', 'something', 'unique', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'recreated', 'dying', 'genre', 'wooded', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'perfection', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'trying.Sadly', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'created', 'Fred', 'Wolf', 'Harris', 'Goldberg', 'were', 'devastating', 'literally', 'ripped', 'film', 'shreds', 'ability', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'seemed', 'be', 'challenge', 'writers', 'film', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'end', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'What', 'combined', 'Whosa', 'what', 'make', 'story', 'stand', 'own', 'help', 'MTV', 'were', 'able', 'cover', 'up', 'using', 'songs', '80s', 'divert', 'new', 'direction', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'ending', 'was', 'laughable', 'not', 'comedy', 'sense', 'writers', 'had', 'wrap', 'up', 'quickly', 'sense', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'cover', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'Maybe', 'was', 'final', 'editing', 'finished', 'film', 'feeling', 'missed', 'big', 'chunk', 'action.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'little', 'movie', 'had', 'laughing', 'parts', 'waiting', 'others', 'end', 'Seth', 'Green', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'impressed', 'role', 'film', 'definitely', 'show', 'continue', 'get', 'more', 'work', 'improve', 'great', 'gift', 'comedy', 'delivered', 'actors', 'great', 'blend', '80s', 'humor', 'sex', 'drug', 'jokes', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'demeaned', 'intelligence', 'squandered', 'film', 'instead', 'kind', 'made', 'think', 'youth', 'friends', 'story', 'was', 'honesty', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'writers', 'had', 'good', 'grip', 'film', 'therefore', 'suffered', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'think', 'acting', 'checking', 'out', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tweaked', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'Not', 'bad', 'very', 'far', 'perfection.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

866304,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006FO8HA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Without a Paddle really doesn't do much to distinguish itself from other films of its kind, wherein the main characters take off on a comically hairy adventure in order to recapture their youth and end up figuring out the kind of adults they want to be in the process, but it does play out pretty well.  There are laughs to be had throughout the film, the underlying story holds together satisfactorily, the lush wilderness setting makes for a vivid backdrop, and I felt pretty entertained by the time all was said and done.  On the negative side, the film does rely on a number of hackneyed storylines, such as the ubiquitous ignorant locals who chase the main characters all over the woods, and the big life-changing realizations of each character ring a little hollow in the end.Some people say the film should appeal mainly to teenagers, but I'm not so sure of that.  Those of us who came of age in the 1980s love every chance we get to reminisce about our good old days, and this movie takes us back to those days of Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, 80s music, etc.  Without a Paddle also doesn't descend to the level of crudity that today's teens may have come to expect from their comedies.  Sure, the movie takes the low road every once and again, but it soon works its way back to middle ground - there's basically no nudity, relatively little cursing, and even the human waste product shtick (seemingly required by law in everything coming out of Hollywood these days) is somewhat sanitized here.I liked the setup of the story, with its link to the mystery of D.B. Cooper.  I know I was fascinated as a kid by the Cooper story, but I doubt that many young people today have ever heard of the guy.  For the record, Cooper stole a bunch of money, made his escape by parachuting out of a plane, and proceeded to vanish into thin air; no one knows what happened to him or to the stolen money.  This is exactly the kind of treasure hunt I dreamed of as a kid, so it makes perfect sense to me that this group of thirty-year-old friends would set out in search of Cooper.  They make the trip in honor of the fourth member of their childhood foursome, after bidding him farewell at a pretty disrespectful funeral.  It's certainly the adventure of a lifetime, complete with a whitewater washout, a very close encounter with a bear, a meeting with two modern-day flower children living high up in a tree, the aforementioned hostile locals, and a very grizzly Burt Reynolds.  You might expect Seth Green to stand out from his fellow actors, but it is really Dax Shepard who supplies most of the comic energy of the film.

Without a paddle offers such an answer in a broader sense as the film depicts the importance of risk taking in both leisure and professional life. The philosophical portion of the film is rudimentary, as it does not dwell on the mysteries of our existence, but merely states that one must take a chance in order to fully live life.The story begins with a flashback into the main characters' childhood through something that wants to appear like family video footage. Through archives of four neighborhood kids the audience gets to experience the how recklessly they build tree houses, jumped over streams with BMX bikes, and pretended to be Indiana Jones on dangerous quests. This risk taking seemed to have stayed within the four boys as they graduated high school. Billy, the most prone to take risks, is the first to leave the small town after high school graduation. The three friends later follow Billy's example as they end up in different parts of society.Years later the three boys have become adults and they all face the age of 30 with some level of anxiety. The once careless youth that faced the world with nonchalant bravery are now forced to deal with the responsibilities of adulthood, as they are doctors, businessmen, and drifting loners. On the day of Jerry Conlaine's (Matthew Lillard) dating anniversary his mom calls with sad news as Billy has passed on. Jerry calls Dan Mott (Seth Green) and Tom Marshall (Dax Shepard) about the sad news and they all participate in their lost friend's funeral.In reflection of the past, the three friends enter the backyard where their tree house still exists, and they discover a secret treasure map. The map is connected with an incident regarding an old robbery and it appears that Billy had planned a trip for his friends to uncover the treasure. This opportunity makes the three friends once more feel young as they enter the quest for the treasure in the name of Billy. Before they know it they are in too deep for their own good as they enter the dark woods of Oregon through a slow moving river much like that in Deliverance (1972), but it is far from a similar cinematic experience.Without a Paddle is directed by Steven Brill who also made Mr. Deeds (2002) and Little Nicky (2000), and this time Brill makes an entertaining mix with seriousness and humor. However, comedy is about timing and Without a Paddle seems to be off in its timing. The film has its moments, but some moments are awkward such as when Jerry attempts to untie his gym shoes to outrun a bear. In the version that is more commonly told among friends, the person wears heavy boots and as the boots are too heavy for escaping a bear the person unties them and takes them off. This untying of the shoes is an example of the lack of originality and misses as the timing seemed to be wrong. The film also leans heavily on ""borrowing"" from other films. For example, there is a sequence borrowed from Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983).There have been other films that have borrowed much from other films such as the hilarious Spaceballs (1987) by Mel Brooks; however, Brooks' film is timely, goofy, and off the wall. Without a Paddle tries to be funny in this way, but never achieves this level of comedy because the timing is off. This generates an awkwardness that appears to stem from Brill's attempts to incorporate serious undertones through existential philosophy, and it completely purges the comedy. Thus, Without a Paddle leaves a similar imprint as guidance counselors leave on many teenagers by asking existential questions in regards to planning. It is relevant, but out of context as most teenagers do not focus on long term planning.

866323,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006FO8HA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 12]","There is an obvious comparison to be made between ""Without a Paddle"" and ""Deliverance,"" and not just because Burt Reynolds is the best thing in both movies.  Both films are about a group of friends who make a big mistake when they decide to take to a river in canoes and both involve the friends being chased by scary guys with big guns.  However, I think there is a stronger point of comparison to be made between this 2004 comedy and the film ""City Slickers,"" because ""Without a Paddle"" is about friends coming to terms with growing up and living in the real world.  Granted, the trio in this comedy do so when they are about to hit thirty instead of waiting for a mid-life crisis, but where as the ""Deliverance"" gang just wanted to get off of the river and out of the woods alive, the trio in this film have important lessons to learn.Part of the problem with Steven Brill's film is that the serious elements have trouble neatly meshing with the comedic ones.  You can really tell this when you look at the deleted scenes and see the alternate for the one in which Jerry Conlaine (Matthew Lillard) gets the phone call that his childhood friend Billy has died.  Both of them are serious, but one merely touches on it, simply suggesting the seriousness, while the other (the alternative version) turns it into a fairly serious scene.  For most of the film we keep piling on the comic moments to the point that when it becomes time for the friends to learn the BIG LESSON of their adventure in the woods it seems tacked on rather than being the culmination of wall that has gone on before it.When Jerry returns home for Billy's funeral he meets up with the rest of his childhood friends, Dan Mott (Seth Green), who has become a doctor, and Tom Marshall (Dax Shepard), the group's obvious loser.  Each of the trio has their own problems: Jerry's girl friend is ready to leave him because of his problems with commitment, Dan pretty much picks up a new phobia each day, and the only time Tom is not lying is when he is merely exaggerating big time.  After the funeral they return to their old tree house where they discover their treasure box from when they were kids together.It turns out the boys were big fans of D.B. Cooper, the guy who hijacked an airline and jumped out of it somewhere in the Pacific Northwest with a whole bunch of money never to be seen again.  Along with some of the treasures of their childhood the trio discover that Billy had recently put a map into the box.  It seems he had a theory about where Cooper landed and this was the trip he had tried to talk his friends into taking the year before.  Now the trio decided to honor the memory of their friend by going treasure hunting.  Of course, once they get into the woods bad things start happening.Mother Nature has her say in terms of white water rapids and massive rain showers, but on the really bad side of the ledger the boys have repeated encounters with the unfriendly local sheriff (Ray Baker), a giant brown bear (Bart the Bear), and a pair of pot farmers named Dennis (Abraham Benrubi) and Elwood (Ethan Suplee).  On the good side of the ledger there are a couple of blondes (Rachel Blanchard and Christina Moore) up a tree and the pivotal character played by Burt Reynolds (you might as well be surprised at who he turns out to be, especially since he is not who you think he is going to be given the above).""Without A Paddle"" is based on a story by Fred Wolf and Harris Goldberg & Tom Nursall, with the screenplay being credited to Jay Leggett and Mitch Rouse.  There are some funny bits here, but most of them are really just attempts to be funny that try way too hard and fall short of the mark.  Green, who is usually a marvel of restraint in his performances, as amply demonstrated on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" has to move too far in the other direction, especially during his encounters with the bear.  Meanwhile, Lillard goes in the other direction, because he is technically the leading man in this film and so he has reigned in his character considerably from what we have seen in the ""Scooby Doo"" movies, and it is Shepard who ends up hitting exactly the right note with his character.  I bet a lot of viewers will be reminded of the guy in the Holiday Express commercials who acts like he knows what he is talking about when he does not, but Shepard pulls it off time and time again.In the final analysis ""Without a Paddle"" is just another disappointing 2004 comedy.  I would not go so far as to say that if you have seen the trailer you have seen all of the funny moments in the film, but it is certainly heading in that direction.  The performance by Shepard stands out, the interplay between the two drug farmers certainly has its moments, and if you can just pretend when Reynolds shows up that the movie has always been heading towards an ending with serious overtones you can get some enjoyment from what happens to the three guys in the end.Then again, there is an entire tradition of movie comedies that are improved based on what you drink while watching them.  At least that is what I have heard, lacking any personal frame of reference from which to confirm or invalidate the hypothesis.",3,Another 2004 comedy tries to hard and falls way too

866327,A2VVIT14CE3KGA,B0006FO8HA,Mark Twain,"[1, 1]","All too often is there an abundance of serious, straight-faced films that are released at an almost constant pace in theaters. Then every once in a while the proverbial ""ugly duckling""comes around and opens everyones eyes. Without A Paddle is a little of both of those. While it is anything but a monumental smash hit, it opened a lot of peoples eyes and did quite well for what it had to work with. Aside from Seth Green and Matthew Lillard, Without A Paddle really didn't have much going for it. In a nutshell it's basically your typical comedy. This means that it will include some gross-out humor, rednecks, and a huge amount of drug and ""downstairs"" references. Or at least that's what this film brings to the table. Without A Paddle is about four men (Tom, Dan, Billy, and Jerry) who, as children, were very troublesome and adventurous. This led them into their mid-twenties where Billy had to separate from the seemingly inseparable group to pursue other goals in life. What follows is the untimely death of Billy, and what could have been the demise of the rest of the gang. But instead, the remaining three become closer than ever before and, following directions from a map Billy left before he croaked, go on a final adventure. This journey consists of finding the hidden treasure of D.B. Cooper which had eluded the boys since early age. It all begins here as they set off while reminiscing about childhood, Culture Club, and mix tapes.As for more info on who Tom, Dan, and Jerry are... Dan, played by the awesome Seth Green, was the doctor that was worried and paranoid about being diseased. He also had a lot of phobias, which I found to be comedic considering that he was a doctor and most doctors have very few (if any) fears when it comes to health. Then there was Jerry. Matthew Lillard did a good job as Jerry, in my opinion. Jerry was basically a yuppie-like businessman with an unhappy life. He also had a girlfriend who he was too afraid to propose to. Tom, the third and final character, was played by Dax Shepard. Tom was, overall, a very good liar. He tended to stretch the truth more than was necessary, or he just flat-out lied. For instance, rather than having earned money off of selling prized Harley Davidson motorcycles, in reality he actually sold off several of his friends band t-shirts on eBay. So in short, the brief cast of characters in the flick were interesting enough, even though I would have preferred a bit more depth for each of them. I did like what Seth Green did for his character though. I couldn't have imagined a better actor casted for such a role.I actually liked Without A Paddle quite a lot for a standard Friday evening comedy. It's distantness and comedy were aimed at a much younger audience that I expected; teenagers will definitely like this one the most. Especially with the repetitive talk of women's ""downstairs"" and several scenes that include Tom, Dan, and Jerry escaping two of the villains in a field of weed. The humor is intended to be immature, but at times it can be very funny. Then again, there are some scenes that either take it too far or just go off the edge with ridiculousness. For example, the part where the three wander into a tree of two ""forest girls"" who appear to be lesbians is a little too much. In my opinion, the first half of the flick was much better than the final half. Actually, the beginning turned out to be very well-scripted and thought out. I liked the inclusion of the mix tapes and vintage posters. The opening childhood scene was neat, especially with the awesome music. If there's one thing that I liked in the movie, it was all of the music. The backgrounds and scenery kind of got tiring and boring after a while. It seemed like the guys fell off nineteen of the same waterfall. There was little to no variety when it came to the setting. I would have liked for the most to take place elsewhere, maybe in, say, the desert. That would have made for some good comedy, but would of been a surefire rip-off of that old Pauly Shore movie. Overall, Without A Paddle is for the younger audience. I wouldn't recommend it to small children for several reasons. One, some of the language is inappropriate.

They go on a treasure hunt that their friend sends them from beyond the grave. Heard this story before? You certainly will have. It's a lot better than Crossroads, which is more of a girlie movie. I don't want to put this into a box by itself, but it's a bit more of a guys movie, particularly with all the stunts. There's a very scary scene featuring a lot of water, and a little canoe which you could probably break in half over your knee. Not for me thank you. Thankfully it's not your typical road trip movie either, with plenty of babes thrown in along the way. The only babes in this are up a tree, and have hairy legs.The actors in this are really good, particularly Matthew Lillard, playing a slightly less goofy version of Shaggy, and more the spiritual one of the three. The other two actors were great as well, especially the little tiny one! He was so short compared to the other two. There's a brilliant supporting cast, with Burt Reynolds, Bonnie Sommerville (she was in Friends!) and Rachel Blanchard.There's some funny scenes, but the three guys getting stoned unintentionally in a field, and then the two dogs getting stoned too is hilarious! The dogs go all docile, and see a dog shaped group of stars in the sky. And does anyone else get the feeling Dax Shepherd, Seth Green & Matthew Lillard have no idea what it takes to get stoned? There's also a lovely scene where they're running around in their underwear, and then it rains, and they have to cuddle up together to try and keep warm. Put it this way, if your boyfriend seems to cringe at this, he ain't gonna want to go and see Brokeback Mountain.

B. Cooper's long lost treasure.  Once in the wilderness, they encounter a ferocious grizzly bear, a couple of tree-hugging (and tree-dwelling) nymphets, and two hillbilly pot farmers who look and act like a couple of leftovers from a touring company of ""Deliverance.""Dax Shepard, Matthew Lillard and Seth Green play the young men who spend most of their time rescuing one another from death-defying accidents or running for their lives from predatory man and beast - with the occasional time out for big-think observations around the campfire about freedom vs. responsibility, about overcoming fears and about just how much adventure a person should have in his life.  ""Without a Paddle"" feels an awful lot like similar lowbrow comedies from the past, but its overall fast pace and good-natured silliness give it an endearing quality.  The stunt work is impressive and, although the movie is far from being a laugh-riot, the viewer is sure to get a few chuckles watching these city slickers taking on the rigors and trials of the great outdoors.

But after a starting along this path it veers off into so many different areas that in the end, none of them have enough meat on the bones to fill you up and it becomes a fairly shallow film.  Not bad mind you, but certainly not great either.Dan (Seth Green), Jerry (Matthew Liiard) and Tom (Dax Shepard) are three boyhood chums, now all in their early 30's who reunited in Oregon for the funeral of their friend Billy.  When they were just kids, they had always planned on taking a trip to search for the legendary lost treasure of D.B. Cooper.  When the trio revisits their old tree house...Incredibly still intact after 20 years, those desires are rekindled, and they decide to honor the memory of their friend by setting out on the journey.At this point the film is holding true to the funny but fairly sophomoric humor and doesn't work too badly as they have a harrowing encounter with a motherly bear who (stupidly) mistakes Seth Green as her cub.  Then the group take the wrong fork in a river and survive the harsh rapids and our left without their boat or supplies.  This is where the film begins to fall apart.Wandering the woods they come upon some lights hoping for help only to run into some backwoods Oregon hillbillies who are running a major marijuana growing operation.  On the run from the gun-toting, ATV-driving rednecks, Without a Paddle now wants to become a coming of age film about three aimless thirty-year olds, while also making a stupid comment about preserving the environment as they take refuge in a giant redwood shared by two beautiful, and near-naked hippies.Without a Paddle ends up being sort of ""Goonies"" for the 2000's although it's not nearly as fun as that film.  Director Steven Brill had shown some ability with previous decent efforts with the Adam Sandler films ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Little Nicky"" but he falls a bit flat on this one.

There is even a `Those were the days' section using home video clips trying to give pathos, and the filmmakers are brave enough to even add a `meaning of life' message to the comedy with the appearance of Burt Reynolds, who appears with a thick beard.For all its uninspired script and direction, the film has good moments due to the cast. Seth Green, who perfectly knows the right timing to be funny, proves again that he can do great comic turn without making it too silly. Lilard (unusually subdued for him) is also good, and so is newcomer Dax Shepard. But for all good works from each of them, the three characters as a whole do not convince me as three old friends since childhood. The story about their friendship falls flat, which only help make the lack of originality in the film's numerous gags - jokes about pot, homosexuality, or toilet humor and so on - more obvious than otherwise.But I liked the three characters, not because of themselves or what they do, but because of the actors playing them. They and their acting leave no nasty taste in your mouth after watching this comedy, and that is not a bad thing at all. The film somehow refuses to be wild when it should be, and the actors look as if waiting for the cue to be wild, which never comes after all But it is still true that they did professional's jobs, all Green, Lilard, and Shepard, and to watch them is not a bad idea for me. If only director Steven Brill (`Little Nicky' 'Mr. Deeds' and others) had given them a chance to do something different.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Not Bad, But Great.

Billy had been obsessed with uncovering nearly $200,000 that famed highjacker D.B. Cooper (an actual real life criminal) supposedly hid somewhere in the wood of Oregon.  Partly out of adventure and partly as a final farewell gesture to Billy, the three young men leave for a multi-day canoeing trip down the Colombia River to see if they can find the object (the money) of Billy's obsession.  The river turns out to be the least of the men's worries as they encounter one strange encounter after another: illegal DELIVERANCE-type pot farmers, an angry sheriff, giant black bears, environment-loving tree-living women, and one expert woodsman who looks an awful lot like Burt Reynolds.When I first watched WITHOUT A PADDLE, I didn't think I was going to like it.  I like Matthew Lillard and Seth Green, but wasn't a big fan of Dax Shepard.  The plot didn't sound all that good to me and I was concerned with some of the content warnings.  Surprisingly, WITHOUT A PADDLE wasn't too bad of a movie.  Yes, there is pot smoking done for comic affect.  Yes, there is sexual innuendo.  Yes, there are a lot of crude jokes.  And yes, once the movie gets started much of it is nonsensical and seems like something out of a Benny Hill sketch or a Monty Python movie.  But, I actually enjoyed the movie.  It made me laugh and after I finished it I realized that I had a good time.Some of this might be due to the set up of the film.  The introductory backstory about the characters and their friendship growing up does a wonderful job making the audience care about the characters and setting up the rest of the picture.  When the movie turns into a Bizzaro World version of STAND BY ME, things don't seem as insane as they should.  The pacing of the movie also helps.  There are times the film could drag, but it never does.  The characters have a purpose and they will fulfill that purpose even if it kills them.  Once the boys leave for their trip it's one exciting and often humorous event after another.WITHOUT A PADDLE isn't a movie for children, which is a shame.  If some of the content would have been toned down a bit, it would have been a movie that most family members could enjoy.  Nevertheless, it is a good movie that teenagers on up can enjoy if they just give it a chance.",3,"An Enjoyable, Though Crude Comedy.",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2439,"['Three', 'friends', 'Tom', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'Jerry', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Dan', 'Seth', 'Green', 'come', 'together', 'death', 'one', 'closest', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'had', 'been', 'obsessed', 'uncovering', 'nearly', '200,000', 'famed', 'highjacker', 'D.B', 'Cooper', 'actual', 'real', 'life', 'criminal', 'supposedly', 'somewhere', 'wood', 'Oregon', 'Partly', 'adventure', 'partly', 'final', 'farewell', 'gesture', 'Billy', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'leave', 'multi-day', 'canoeing', 'trip', 'Colombia', 'River', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'object', 'money', 'Billy', 'obsession', 'river', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'men', 'worries', 'encounter', 'one', 'strange', 'encounter', 'illegal', 'DELIVERANCE-type', 'pot', 'farmers', 'angry', 'sheriff', 'giant', 'black', 'bears', 'environment-loving', 'tree-living', 'women', 'one', 'expert', 'woodsman', 'who', 'awful', 'lot', 'Burt', 'Reynolds.When', 'first', 'watched', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'PADDLE', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'like', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Seth', 'Green', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', 'was', 'concerned', 'content', 'warnings', 'Surprisingly', 'A', 'PADDLE', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'Yes', 'pot', 'smoking', 'done', 'comic', 'affect', 'Yes', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'Yes', 'are', 'lot', 'crude', 'jokes', 'yes', 'once', 'movie', 'started', 'much', 'nonsensical', 'something', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'sketch', 'Monty', 'Python', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'finished', 'realized', 'had', 'good', 'time.Some', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'set', 'film', 'introductory', 'backstory', 'characters', 'friendship', 'growing', 'up', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'audience', 'care', 'characters', 'setting', 'up', 'rest', 'picture', 'When', 'movie', 'Bizzaro', 'World', 'version', 'STAND', 'BY', 'ME', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'insane', 'should', 'pacing', 'movie', 'also', 'are', 'times', 'film', 'could', 'drag', 'never', 'characters', 'have', 'purpose', 'will', 'fulfill', 'purpose', 'even', 'boys', 'leave', 'trip', 'one', 'exciting', 'often', 'humorous', 'event', 'another.WITHOUT', 'A', 'PADDLE', ""n't"", 'movie', 'children', 'shame', 'content', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'most', 'family', 'members', 'could', 'enjoy', 'Nevertheless', 'good', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'just', 'give', 'chance']",N/A
