1099938,A1DJ7NEM06M0EK,B000VAHQVU,A Customer,"[15, 15]","I'd been looking for a cheap DVD copy of A Christmas Story to replace my VHS.  This was the bargain I was looking for.  A box set of three outstanding family Christmas movies at a great price.  And the slim cases save precious DVD storage space.  Each movie is hilarious, and the comedy style differs between each, making this a great set to watch in one sitting or over a few days.  Comes with an anti-ennui guarantee.Updated 1/10/11 - I ordered this set four months ago for 15.99, and I see today it's priced at 24.99.  I think it's still a bargain.  However, if your tastes are a little different, you might be interested inHoliday Family Collection: The Polar Express/Happy Feet/A Christmas StoryorHoliday Comedy Collection (Elf / National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation / Fred Claus).

1099949,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B000VAHQVU,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[0, 0]","My family doesn't have a television with channels. We only have a TV that plays DVDs. One thing I miss about not having channels is all of the awesome family-friendly Christmas shows that are played near the holiday season. So this year I went around and bought a bunch of Christmas DVDs. This set caught my eye right away and I snatched it up. I love comedy. I love Christmas. I love all three of these movies. And yes- you get ALL three! Each on their own DVD. Each in their own thin DVD case. All three of the cases fit nicely into the original box.The first DVD (and my personal favorite) that we watched was Elf. This movie features Will Ferrel as a human who was adopted by one of Santa's elves and raised as an elf in the North Pole. He then finds out his 'real father' is a typical New York executive living in the big city. He then ventures out to find his father (who is absolutely repulsed that his unknown 'son' thinks he's an elf) and spread Christmas joy to all of New York. Of course he hits a few funny bumps along the way. This movie had my children and I laughing the entire way through. It's very clean humour as well.The second DVD is A Christmas Story. This movie does have a few cuss words in it. I'd like to remind parents of that prior to them purchasing it. But we talk about those words when their mentioned- because other than that the movie is fantastic. It's a traditional holiday movie most people know or have watched. It's about a young boy who wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas. It's the *only thing he wants- and he will do anything to get it. A fun little story about coming of age and being a young boy.And the last DVD is National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. This is a good, clean, old fashioned movie about your typical &#34;have the entire family come stay with you over Christmas&#34; events. The family goes through everything from decorating the house to arguing with relatives. It's a funny, sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy (even teenagers).All together these movies are sure to have you giggling and in the Christmas spirit. I'd say they're best for kids ages nine and up. None of the DVDs have additional features. Basically just the movie and a scene selection. But that's all we care about anyways. We don't need special features. The playback quality is perfect. Good sound and amazing picture. They're not HD (I don't think?)- but they are very clear and easy to watch. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an affordable collection of Christmas movies.",5,Love It!,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2532,"['family', ""n't"", 'have', 'television', 'channels', 'only', 'have', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'One', 'thing', 'miss', 'not', 'having', 'channels', 'awesome', 'family-friendly', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'are', 'played', 'holiday', 'season', 'So', 'year', 'went', 'around', 'bought', 'bunch', 'Christmas', 'DVDs', 'set', 'caught', 'eye', 'right', 'away', 'snatched', 'up', 'love', 'comedy', 'love', 'Christmas', 'love', 'three', 'movies', 'yes-', 'get', 'three', 'own', 'DVD', 'own', 'thin', 'DVD', 'case', 'three', 'cases', 'fit', 'nicely', 'original', 'box.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'personal', 'favorite', 'watched', 'was', 'Elf', 'movie', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'human', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'one', 'Santa', 'elves', 'raised', 'elf', 'North', 'Pole', 'then', 'out', ""'real"", 'father', 'typical', 'New', 'York', 'executive', 'living', 'big', 'city', 'then', 'ventures', 'out', 'find', 'father', 'who', 'absolutely', 'repulsed', 'unknown', ""'son"", 'elf', 'spread', 'Christmas', 'joy', 'New', 'York', 'course', 'few', 'funny', 'bumps', 'way', 'movie', 'had', 'children', 'laughing', 'entire', 'way', 'very', 'clean', 'humour', 'well.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'cuss', 'words', ""'d"", 'like', 'remind', 'parents', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'talk', 'words', 'when', 'mentioned-', 'other', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'traditional', 'holiday', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'watched', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Red', 'Rider', 'BB', 'Gun', 'Christmas', '*only', 'thing', 'wants-', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'fun', 'little', 'story', 'coming', 'age', 'being', 'young', 'boy.And', 'last', 'DVD', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'good', 'clean', 'old', 'fashioned', 'movie', 'typical', '34', 'have', 'entire', 'family', 'come', 'stay', 'Christmas', '34', 'events', 'family', 'everything', 'decorating', 'house', 'arguing', 'relatives', 'funny', 'sweet', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', 'teenagers', '.All', 'together', 'movies', 'are', 'sure', 'have', 'giggling', 'Christmas', 'spirit', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'best', 'kids', 'ages', 'nine', 'up', 'None', 'DVDs', 'have', 'additional', 'features', 'Basically', 'just', 'movie', 'scene', 'selection', 'care', 'anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'special', 'features', 'playback', 'quality', 'perfect', 'Good', 'sound', 'amazing', 'picture', ""'re"", 'not', 'HD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'easy', 'watch', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'affordable', 'collection', 'Christmas', 'movies']",Christmas Comedy Collection: (Elf / A Christmas Story / National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation)
