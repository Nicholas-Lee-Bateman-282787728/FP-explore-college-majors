I fell in love with the character of Young Jolyon right away - I suppose it helps that I'm a big fan of Rupert Graves. He is so handsome and a fantastic actor. I had just finished watching The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and I was ready to watch more of Graves ASAP. He is my favorite character. I love all the characters, even Soames when he's horrible to Irene. Damian Lewis played Soames wonderfully - right down to the way he walked.  His character disgusted me often times, but there is something about Soames that made me secretly like him. I kept hoping that he would change for the better and become a better person at the end. (I wish Lewis' Life series hadn't been cancelled. I thought it was great, and Damian Lewis deserved a second season at least.)I was so sad when series 2 ended. The ending was very satisfying and well done, and I cried happy tears...I was just sad it was all over. I really felt the conflicting emotions of the two sides of the family through each generation, and I laughed and cried with both sides of the Forsyte family.Aside from the story, the setting and the costumes were beautiful, but I didn't much care for the later years in series 2 because the costumes were less elaborate although true to the time period. I'm not a fan of the clothing from the early 1900s...flapper dresses and hair adornments, as beautiful as they are, are just not as fun and flattering in my opinion for the women. At least the men always looked wonderful through the whole of series 1 and 2.I'm so glad I stumbled upon this saga. It's a keeper! I want more Forsyte saga series!",5,5 minutes and I was hooked!

713571,ARC7R1Z0J4OUV,B00006FHZD,"Angela G. Birt ""Silversurf4""","[8, 9]","The Forsyte clan would at once seem to be otherworldly with their Victorian English clothes and manners.  But when you look deeper all the familiar foils are there - sibling rivalry, black sheep and ne'er do wells that haunt every family.  Told at the turn of the century when people were marrying for money first and love second - it twists around the central character of Soames.  He's played amazingly by Damian Lewis, as a misunderstood man who loves beauty but can only own it rather than experience it.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Soames would have no redeeming qualities, but Lewis makes him human - odd with strange quirks and tics, but someone who wants to get love and just can't.  His frustration makes him mean and controlling, but for the want of someone, anyone who will show him some affection.I never read the books, but I found Irene to be a cold, vixen who made a choice to marry for money and then took up with every man who crossed her path - except her husband.  That had to annoy him - but nothing on the order of excusing the brutal marital rape scene depicted.  Soames is supposed to be unlikeable, but I found myself understanding, even empathizing with him.Their dysfunctional family includes the elder Forsyte brothers always in competition; the lecherous gambler - Darty and his wife Winnifred (Soames' sister) who put up with his debauchery - to a point; the two judgmental unmarried aunts; George who never seems to do much, but is always there; the black sheep (Joylon) who betrays his vows to follow his heart and some how still ends up with Irene (as does virtually every other man in the story).The other central character is June who is an abandoned child, then an abandoned woman (betrayed by Bossiny and Irene) and who must ultimately accept the woman who stole her lover as family (again).  She for some reason hates Soames, but forgives everyone else everything.  June I find a bit false in that she never seems to arrive at her betrayal being a function of both Irene and Phil, but rather lumps all wrongs onto Soames - he's a convenient target and easy to dislike.This is high drama, soap opera, lovers, trysts, betrayals, double crosses and in the end I return to Soames who must chose between his wife and the child he so desperately wants but can't seem to get in a heart wrenching decision - made dispassionately in classic Soames fashion.  It's as if he feels the emotions, but lacks the tools to express them - it all comes out as anger.  But there are moments...like when he lies to his father about having a son to give the dying man his last wish; or having to chose between his wife and child; or having to leave the wife and new born to go to his father's death bed.  He bears it stoically, but could you wipe away the steam and see underneath that glass - oh, what a roiling pot of trouble you'd find.  And the final scene of Soames and the baby took me back to the story his mother told about him smothering that kitten with too much love.  It's as if he lacks the ability to modulate his emotion - you get it all at once or none at all.The production's British, so naturally it's austere, understated, beautifully costumed and the sets are marvelous.  I, for one, would love to live at Robin Hill and having seen this I know now I must read the books from whence it sprang.

This said, the 2000 version is far and away superior to the 69 version. The performances here are vastly more nuanced and subtle, especially Damien Lewis as Soams. His predecessor was not only too old for the role but I find his performance very self-conciouse and one note. As for the huge uproar over the casting of Irene, I expected to be bowled over by the original, I was not. Here again a very stagey and also vacant performance. Gina McKee is an Irene who attracts not only with her grace and beauty.  She is attractive because of her sensitvity her insight and her unwilingness to bow to Victorian social standards. The very things that attract Soams to Irene are the things that make it impossible for their marriage to work.  The other characters are also, with rare exception, played better here than in the original especially June, Young Jolyon, Bossiney and Winifred. Do not let a bow to nostalgia cloud your judgement.

Fiction that turns on a hero-villain motif is very dependent, when it comes to the screen, on who plays the villain in chief. Get that wrong and the whole work goes down the drain. Eric Porter did a great job playing Soames Forsythe, the villain, in the original, but Damian Lewis, incredibly, is even better. Actually, he brings you very close to feeling sympathy for Soames by the end, which is no mean feat considering that Soames injures so many other people.  Lewis uses his physicality to great effect in the role as well, especially his pale, cold, unblinking eyes.  All the other actors, by contrast, play largely likable characters.  The plot  concerns an extended well-to-do Victorian family, the Forsythes, who intersect repeatedly with one another in every way conceivable, including romantically, sexually, and financially.  In fact, it borders on the incestuous the way these characters can't seem to find significant others outside of their own bloodline!  Soames does marry an outsider, Irene.  He is obsessed by her yet he revolts her. She was forced into this marriage of convenience by being left destitute at her father's death. Their stormy union brings about almost all the angst of the story line as Soames and Irene tumble into the lives of virtually every other Forsythe, radically upsetting the status quo of family alignments time and again.  Rupert Graves makes a very nice romantic leading man as Soames' artist cousin, young Jolyon, as does Ioan Gruffud as the architect who leads Irene away from Soames.  My favorite episode in the book and both series remains the same.  It is ""Indian Summer of a Forsythe,"" where the marvelous old Jolyon is given an idyllic time with Irene prior to his own encroaching death.  That episode always has a shattering impact of conveying a life well lived and brought to the end the way such a life should be.

Everyone is supposed to be a well-bred Brit, and yet many of the prominent portrayals are of people who seem unaccountably alien to the depicted time period.  Worse, these characters set the moral tone of the saga, which utterly rings hollow in a Victorian Age drama.  Betrayal of spouse, child, fiancee, and friend is acceptable if sexual desire is strong enough.  Those of an artistic bent are adored and forgiven all, while those of a prudent and practical turn are despised and shunned.  The unconventional is declared beautiful and accepted as such by one and all.  Hardly the stuff of a prim, proper, and strait-laced era!  Overall, the characterizations--though well acted--lack depth, and many of the supporting roles serve as mere props and foils.  All the action seems to spiral toward a central female lead, and when a character is bounced from her direct orbit, he or she withers as a personality within the plot.  There is nothing of the surreal in the story, though some situations seem almost fantastical in their rosy depictions of characters' reduced circumstances.

But for me, as I approached this with a beginners mind without any previous experience of this material, I was riveted by it.I thought the actress playing Irene was masterful. She oozed intrigue, coldness and an angelic quality all at the same time. She floated around with a refinement that made her stand out in a crowd, even if her looks might not have been perfect.The character of Solmes was also greatly depicted. I felt compassion for this man and hated him at the same time. The actor's port rail of an abusive because too controlling in his love type husband was realistic in my experience. I have come across a man of this kind. The raging, the subtle shaking, the twitching and the facial expressions were priceless here. I disagree with those that say his performance was monotone. Anything but.The costuming and the settings were also great. Some people said they looked too modern. I disagree. Modern UK decorating is very inspired to the Victorian era. I lived in the UK for 15 years and the sets looked beautiful and realistic to me.And last but not least the story- how wonderful.

713592,A2FS38D943KX12,B00006FHZD,chefdevergue,"[7, 11]","This production of ""The Forsyte Saga"" is certainly pleasing to the eye.  It is one of the more lavish productions to come out of Britain recently.  It is a large enough production that the producers had to make it in two parts (does it conclude the ""Saga"" or does it continue into ""The Modern Comedy?"").With all of the attention to Late Victorian/Edwardian detail, it is then a mystery to me how the producers leave us with such unsatisfying portrayals of some of the principal characters.Some portrayals, such as Ben Miles (as Montague Dartie) and John Carlisle (as James Forsyte) were square on the mark.  Also notable are Gillian Kearney (as a rather low-key June Forsyte) and Amanada Root (as Winifred Dartie).  In fact, virtually all of the performances are top-notch.Outstanding performances, unfortunately, do not compensate for bad casting.  While Damian Lewis gives a memorable performance, his Soames Forsyte barely resembles the character I remember from the books.  Also Irene Forsyte, portrayed by Gina McKee, has to be one of the coldest fishes in recent memory!  Neither of these characters could possibly hope to inspire the slightest feelings of sympathy on the part of the viewer.  Soames comes across at times as purely evil, but one still cannot care much for Irene's plight, as she seems extremely cold-blooded in her own right.This gives the viewer pause.  I found that in ""The Modern Comedy"" Soames becomes more nuanced and sympathetic as he grows older.  I always thought that Galsworthy rather liked Soames and felt a bit sorry for the man.  It is hard, as one anticipates the second installment of this series, to imagine such a character in the hands of Damian Lewis, at least as he was directed in this series.The series was enjoyable enough, but not particularly satisfying to those who are familiar with ""The Forsyte Chronicles.""

Soames mellows in both the books and both the tv series.  The best book and the best part of the series is the ""Man of Property"" part in which we are introduced to thePhilistine Forsytes in the 1970s when the British Empire reigned supreme.The acting in the new version is excellent. Gina McKee is not your usual beauty but her acting and cold sophistication are a wonder to behold. Damian Lewis is superb as Soames. The supporting cast is excellent.The camera angles are interesting with high shots sometimes giving one a panoramic view of the scenes; costuming and furnishing on the sets are accurate to the time period involved.Many people will find the action snail like and grow bored with this nineteenth century soap but those who stick with the proceedings will enjoy the series.In Simon Montefiore's new biography of Stalin I learned that the Russian dictator considered the old Greer Garson movie ""ThatForsyte Woman"" to be his favorite movie!

The best part of this book is the fantastic author who didn't assign a good or bad to the main people. That is unusual, and He lets you choose for yourself. That keeps you running questions around in your mind and possibly seeing the reasons good people do things that are not good for the the self or others.  And maybe forgive them for it. Did Irene not try enough to make the marriage work? Was her husband totally to blame?  What horrible choices were made? I must say the book suggest there was never any marriage sex allowed by Irene, and her husband regrets what he did. This is the most difference in the book,  ( and that's a big difference) but most of the Series stays pretty true to it.This is a great period series. It has lots of plots and subplots, and it easy to keep who is who. This has been a highly rated series that was well excepted when it was released. The actress and actresses are very talented.

713612,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00006FHZD,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[16, 21]","""The Forsyte Saga"" takes us back to another time -- when soap operas were dressed up in lace, gilt, marble and love threatened by society's dictates.This sprawling, sumptuous miniseries, adapted from John Galsworthy's novels, introduces viewers to the Forsyte family, who never change and uphold themselves with rigid propriety. And the first season of it is a wonderfully dramatic tale of love, possession, and a man's obsession with his unattainable wife.As the story opens, Young Jolyon (Rupert Graves) realizes that he is in love with the governess, and leaves his wife to begin a new life with his beloved. The Forsyte family shuts him out, more angered by his sin against society than his leaving his wife. (Lovely people)Four years later, Soames Forsyte (Damian Lewis) catches a glimpse of the beautiful Irene Heron (Gina McKee) at a concert, and is instantly smitten. Irene rejects him, but is trapped by lack of money. Eventually she concedes -- if he promises to let her be free if the marriage fails.But she doesn't come to love him, although he still tries to get her affection. Finally he commissions his niece's fiancee, Bosinney (Ioan Gruffudd), to build a country palace for Irene. But then Irene and Bosinney fall passionately in love, and the enraged Soames strikes back at them -- with shocking, then tragic results.Ten more years pass. Soames wants to remarry a pretty young French girl, but is still legally married to Irene. He demands that she name a recent lover, so he can get a divorce -- but then he starts obsessively stalking his wife, trying to win her back. Instead, he drives her into the arms of the grieving Young Jolyon...Love, sex, violence, death, war, gambling, scandal, babies and seething resentment -- all the ingredients of a juicy drama. And despite the period clothing, this is a very juicy miniseries, as well as being mostly faithful to Galsworthy's sprawling novels, and very prettily made.In fact, it juggles the various storylines -- Dartie's scandals, Holly and Val falling in love, Irene's affair -- with remarkable flair. And as Galsworthy did, it explores how women were treated (""Miss Heron, will you be mine?"" ""I will MARRY you, Mr Forsyte""), forgiveness, and how a scandal only affects you if you allow it to. The writing is impeccable.And it takes place in magnificent period sets. Sure, they're too ornate for the sensible Forsytes, but they are gorgeous -- from the more modern house by Bosinney, to the stately, ornate homes in London. The main flaw is that it slows down substantially in the final third, and some threads are left hanging for the second season.And the cast is stunning. Rather than making Soames sympathetic, Lewis makes him UNDERSTANDABLE -- he's despicable, but the audience can see how narrow-minded and desperate he is. McKee is quietly enigmatic, and Graves is passionate and lovable. They're backed by equally good performances by Gruffudd, Corin Redgrave as the family patriarch, and Gillian Kearney as lonely June.""The Forsyte Saga's"" first season is a dramatic, intense miniseries, though it slows down a great deal at the end.

713615,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B00006FHZD,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[89, 105]","Some of my readers might have very warm recollections of the 1967 black and white BBC mini-series (from before, I believe, the term was coined) that brought to life in 26 episodes and 21 hours  all six of the nine novels written by John Galsworthy under the supertitle &quot;The Forsyte Saga.&quot; Few video adaptations quite as good were  to come again until &quot;The Pallisers&quot; attracted millions, and both would be very difficult to improve upon. Well, Granada has tried with what might be an 18 part remake of the Galsworthy saga; and the first series of 6 is now available on three DVDs from Acorn Media.Taken on its own terms, it is extremely good--but not perfect--and had me and wife pretty well riveted to the screen on three successive evenings. It did not, however, erase fond memories of the earlier version. Now the 1967 version was &quot;studio-bound, with static camera work, long scenes and long speeches&quot; (as the press release puts it). What the release leaves out was superb acting by established stars and by newcomer Susan Hampshire whose Fleur made her a star.For example, Eric Porter made Soames a sympathetic human who hurt himself more than he hurt others, especially his miserable first wife Irene. In the 2002 version, Damian Lewis, looking like a demonic Steve McQueen, is 99% pure villain; and his mother's recollection of how he loved a pet cat to death does little to soften his character. It is only in the very last minute of the last episode that he softens--but I will not tell you why.Another problem is the actress playing Irene, Gina McKee. The original Irene was portrayed by the extremely beautiful Nyree Dawn Porter; and all of the comments in the script about her looks were not contradicted by what we saw of her. Here (at the risk of being attacked for being another John Simon), McKee is simply attractive but by no means beautiful. In fact, some of the profile shots make her quite unattractive; and somehow all the praises the other characters  sing about her are not justified visually. Then too, Soames' sister, played in 1967 by Margaret Tyzack, was always referred to as unattractive and lucky to catch a husband at all, even if he is a &quot;bounder.&quot; Here Amanda Root, being very pretty indeed, draws no such disparaging comments in this new script.The rest of the cast-- Ioan Gruffudd, Rupert Graves, Gillian Kearney, Corin Redgrave, and so many more that I could only wish Acorn Media had provided a booklet with the cast as it did for &quot;The Pallisers&quot;--can stand comparison with the 1967 actors.The production values are just fine, but all too often the camera work becomes annoyingly &quot;innovative&quot; when one character close to the camera is speaking to one further away, and they are brought alternatively in and out of focus as they speak or listen.But, as a comic Shakespearean character says, comparisons are odious. Again, on its own terms, this is a very enjoyable if somewhat flawed remake of (so far) the first two Forsyte novels; and I can honestly recommend them for once and future viewing as I look forward to the next releases when they are filmed. But let us yet hope for some Kind Soul to restore the 1967 version not too long in the future.",4,Not perfect but good enough on its own terms,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,3245,"['readers', 'might', 'have', 'very', 'warm', 'recollections', '1967', 'black', 'white', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'believe', 'term', 'was', 'coined', 'brought', 'life', '26', 'episodes', '21', 'hours', 'six', 'nine', 'novels', 'written', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'supertitle', 'quot', 'Forsyte', 'Saga.', 'quot', 'Few', 'video', 'adaptations', 'quite', 'good', 'were', 'come', 'again', 'quot', 'Pallisers', 'quot', 'attracted', 'millions', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'improve', 'upon', 'Well', 'Granada', 'tried', 'what', 'might', 'be', '18', 'part', 'remake', 'Galsworthy', 'saga', 'first', 'series', '6', 'now', 'available', 'three', 'DVDs', 'Acorn', 'Media.Taken', 'own', 'terms', 'extremely', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'had', 'wife', 'pretty', 'well', 'riveted', 'screen', 'three', 'successive', 'evenings', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'erase', 'fond', 'memories', 'earlier', 'version', 'Now', '1967', 'version', 'was', 'quot', 'studio-bound', 'static', 'camera', 'work', 'long', 'scenes', 'long', 'speeches', 'quot', 'press', 'release', 'What', 'release', 'out', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'established', 'stars', 'newcomer', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Fleur', 'made', 'star.For', 'example', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'made', 'Soames', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'who', 'hurt', 'more', 'others', 'especially', 'miserable', 'first', 'wife', 'Irene', '2002', 'version', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'looking', 'demonic', 'Steve', 'McQueen', '99', '%', 'pure', 'villain', 'mother', 'recollection', 'how', 'loved', 'pet', 'cat', 'death', 'little', 'soften', 'character', 'only', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'why.Another', 'problem', 'actress', 'playing', 'Irene', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'original', 'Irene', 'was', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'comments', 'script', 'looks', 'were', 'not', 'contradicted', 'what', 'saw', 'Here', 'risk', 'being', 'attacked', 'being', 'John', 'Simon', 'McKee', 'simply', 'attractive', 'means', 'beautiful', 'fact', 'profile', 'shots', 'make', 'quite', 'unattractive', 'somehow', 'praises', 'other', 'characters', 'sing', 'are', 'not', 'justified', 'visually', 'Then', 'too', 'Soames', 'sister', 'played', '1967', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'was', 'always', 'referred', 'unattractive', 'lucky', 'catch', 'husband', 'even', 'quot', 'quot', 'Here', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'being', 'very', 'pretty', 'indeed', 'such', 'disparaging', 'comments', 'new', 'script.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Gillian', 'Kearney', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'could', 'only', 'wish', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'had', 'provided', 'booklet', 'cast', 'did', 'quot', 'Pallisers', 'quot', 'can', 'stand', 'comparison', '1967', 'actors.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'too', 'often', 'camera', 'work', 'becomes', 'annoyingly', 'quot', 'innovative', 'quot', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'close', 'camera', 'speaking', 'one', 'further', 'away', 'are', 'brought', 'alternatively', 'focus', 'speak', 'listen.But', 'comic', 'Shakespearean', 'character', 'comparisons', 'are', 'odious', 'Again', 'own', 'terms', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'remake', 'far', 'first', 'two', 'Forsyte', 'novels', 'can', 'honestly', 'recommend', 'once', 'future', 'viewing', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'releases', 'when', 'are', 'filmed', 'let', 'yet', 'hope', 'Kind', 'Soul', 'restore', '1967', 'version', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'future']",N/A

Although she looks splendidly chic and soign&eacute;e in her costumes as Soames's trophy wife (she seems at times consciously to evoke Sargent's &quot;Madame X&quot;), she looks utterly unconvincing in her early scenes as a young unmarried girl who would capture Soames's attentions despite her relative poverty. Moreover, though she tries her best, she's just not up to the demands of the role, which requires her to be enigmatic (which she can manage) but also incredibly sympathetic (which she cannot).Otherwise this revisitation of the BBC miniseries which launched &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; in 1969 is superb from beginning to end. The writers, Stephen Mallatratt and jan McVerry, did magnificent work in expanding Galsworthy's text, adding beautifully done scenes (such as Young Jolyon's heartbreaking leavetaking of his unloved first wife, Frances) that are only background material in the original source material. The extremely gifted actor Damian Lewis serves as the linchpin figure of the cast as the &quot;man of property&quot; Soames Fosyte, baffled by his violent passion for Irene and her refusal to reciprocate his affections, but the entire magnificent cast is a kind of &quot;who's who&quot; of BBC productions from years past, adding to the sense of accumulated history in the material. Special mention should be made of Joanna David (from the late Seventies adaptation of REBECCA) as Irene's pushing yet vulnerable stepmother; Judy Campbell (NANNY) as the formidable senior member of the Forsytes, Aunt Ann; the delightful Wendy Craig (NANNY, BUTTERFLIES) as the gossipy Aunt Juley; Corin Redgrave (PERSUASION) as the complex and dignified Old Jolyon; and especially Amanda Root (PERSUASION) as the increasingly wearied Winifred.

His cousin Young Jolyon Forsyte is already married, but he has fallen in love with his daughter's governess and a scandal is about to ensue.Soames and Jolyon are the two main Forsytes in this series.

713644,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006FHZD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 17]","I have neither read John Galsworthy's novels nor seen the classic 1969 BBC version that was the first &quot;Masterpiece Theater,&quot; so my perspective is based on recognizing Damian Lewis from &quot;Band of Brothers,&quot; Gina McKee from &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; Ioan Gruffudd from &quot;Horatio Hornblower,&quot; and Amanda Root from &quot;Persuasion.&quot;  Actually, when I started watching this Granada Television production my immediate thought that this was going to be like &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons,&quot; and that sooner or later (I assumed later) Soames Forsyte (Lewis) was going to get his comeuppance.  By the end I was thinking more in line of &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man,&quot; because Young Jolyon Forsyte (Rupert Graves) becomes the other pivotal Forsyte in the saga and his path and Soames do cross throughout.  These comparisons are not meant to be gratuitous, because I think the mini-series at its best is as good as it gets (think &quot;Shogun,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice,&quot; name your own--in your heart you know that I am right).The short version of this saga is that it chronicles the lives of three generations of a monied, middle-class English family at the turn of the century.  As our saga begins Winifred (Root) becomes engaged to the wastrel Montague Darties.  Young Jolyon is disowned by his father (Corin Redgrave) after leaving his wife of this daughter June's governess.  Soames is a solicitor who forces his marriage to the beautiful but penniless and therefore desperate Irene, who falls in love with Philip Bosinney, the French architect hired by Soames to build a home in the country.  Those are the starting points for the major characters, but what becomes important is that the characters prove to be dynamic despite all the soap opera elements of the saga.  The predictability of their behavior is tempered by some surprises.  I also want to praise the adaptation by Stephen Mallatratt and Jan McVerry for its use of meaningful looks: there is a scene early on where Soames and his father have a discussion as to how much money to settle on Winifred after her marriage.  Soames says nothing but provokes an entire series of propositions form his father just by minute facial manipulations.I was rather surprised to learn after the fact that &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; on these three DVDs is not the entire Galsworthy epic.  What we have hear is based on &quot;The Man of Property&quot; (1906), the short story interlude &quot;Indian Summer of a Forsyte&quot; (1918), and the novel &quot;In Chancery&quot; (1920).  There is another interlude, &quot;Awakening&quot; (1920) and novel &quot;To Let&quot; (1921) which deals with the third generation of the Forsytes, particularly Fleur and Jon, who are born at the end of this series.  However, I was actually pleasantly surprised by where and how the saga ended.  I guess this is an &quot;average&quot; British mini-series, which certainly makes it above average by anyone's standards.  I did not enjoy it so much that I want to go out and read Galsworthy's novels, but it is still a worthwhile viewing experience.  However, I do want to check out the old BBC version.",4,"Well, two-thirds of the John Galsworthy literary saga",1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,3202,"['have', 'read', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'novels', 'seen', 'classic', '1969', 'BBC', 'version', 'was', 'first', 'quot', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'quot', 'perspective', 'based', 'recognizing', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'quot', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'quot', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'quot', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'quot', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'quot', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'quot', 'Persuasion.', 'quot', 'Actually', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Granada', 'Television', 'production', 'immediate', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'quot', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'quot', 'sooner', 'later', 'assumed', 'later', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'Lewis', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'end', 'was', 'thinking', 'more', 'line', 'quot', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'quot', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'Forsyte', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'other', 'pivotal', 'Forsyte', 'saga', 'path', 'Soames', 'do', 'cross', 'comparisons', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'think', 'mini-series', 'best', 'as', 'good', 'think', 'quot', 'Shogun', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pride', 'amp', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'own', 'heart', 'know', 'am', 'right', '.The', 'short', 'version', 'saga', 'lives', 'three', 'generations', 'monied', 'middle-class', 'English', 'family', 'turn', 'century', 'saga', 'Winifred', 'Root', 'engaged', 'wastrel', 'Montague', 'Darties', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'disowned', 'father', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'leaving', 'wife', 'daughter', 'June', 'governess', 'Soames', 'solicitor', 'who', 'marriage', 'beautiful', 'penniless', 'therefore', 'desperate', 'Irene', 'who', 'love', 'Philip', 'Bosinney', 'French', 'architect', 'hired', 'Soames', 'build', 'home', 'country', 'are', 'starting', 'points', 'major', 'characters', 'what', 'important', 'characters', 'prove', 'be', 'dynamic', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'saga', 'predictability', 'behavior', 'tempered', 'surprises', 'also', 'want', 'praise', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'Mallatratt', 'Jan', 'McVerry', 'use', 'meaningful', 'looks', 'scene', 'early', 'where', 'Soames', 'father', 'have', 'discussion', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'settle', 'Winifred', 'marriage', 'Soames', 'nothing', 'entire', 'series', 'propositions', 'form', 'father', 'just', 'minute', 'facial', 'manipulations.I', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'learn', 'fact', 'quot', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'quot', 'three', 'DVDs', 'not', 'entire', 'Galsworthy', 'epic', 'What', 'have', 'hear', 'based', 'quot', 'Man', 'Property', 'quot', '1906', 'short', 'story', 'interlude', 'quot', 'Indian', 'Summer', 'Forsyte', 'quot', '1918', 'novel', 'quot', 'Chancery', 'quot', '1920', 'interlude', 'quot', 'Awakening', 'quot', '1920', 'novel', 'quot', 'Let', 'quot', '1921', 'third', 'generation', 'Forsytes', 'particularly', 'Fleur', 'Jon', 'who', 'are', 'born', 'end', 'series', 'However', 'was', 'actually', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'where', 'how', 'saga', 'ended', 'guess', 'quot', 'average', 'quot', 'British', 'mini-series', 'certainly', 'average', 'anyone', 'standards', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'read', 'Galsworthy', 'novels', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'experience', 'However', 'do', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'old', 'BBC', 'version']",N/A

Soames knows he isn't a fancy catch - but he has money and class - and that counts for something.  He desperately wants Irene and finally wins her.  But he isn't much in the emotion department and she looks elsewhere to satisfy this need.  Thus, the story takes off  and all the characters go forward in their flaws and various storylines.The interiors of this production are in one word - fabulous.  It makes the story even more enjoyable.  Kudos to the art department.Even after Soames and Irene have their storyline - the children pick up with their turmoils.

While I did not expect that the new dramatization of Galsworthy's masterpiece would be an exact recreation of the original (nor should it be), I was expecting that it would be more faithful to the novels. The biggest disappointment was in the casting of Geena McKee in the major female role of Irene Forsyte:it is as though the casting director never read the books. In this case, the producers should have gone to the original series and watched Nyree Dawn Porter, who was the epitome of Galsworthy's Irene. The male cast members generally fare better, especially Colin Redgrave. I was also impressed by the interpretation of Annette, Soames Forsyte's second wife, which, so far, is more faithful to the books than was the original series. Soames and Annette have a marriage of convenience that they work out over the years; it is an interesting counterpoint to the marriage of young Jolyn and Irene, Soames first wife. There are also unsuccessful. and unnecessary, attempts to make the series more ""modern,""for example as in making the rape scene between Soames and Irene more explicit than the original or the book. Although the series is flawed, I am going to watch the second half, which is supposed to air later this year or early next year, but with my fingers crossed that the producers made a better choice in the casting of Fleur Forsyte than they did with Irene.

The contrast in their personalities and moral outlooks plays out as their and their families' intertwining life stories unfold over several decades of evolving cultural mores.  The complex plot is clearly delineated and consistently engaging.  The dialogue is natural.  The characters are well-drawn and thoroughly human.  They all make mistakes, they all behave badly at times, but even the &#34;bad guys&#34; have moments of, if not precisely redeeming qualities, at least sympathetic ones.  The production values are outstanding with careful period costuming and settings in stately homes and gorgeous domestic interiors.  The actors, whether well-known names or performers I at least had never heard of, are first-rate.  A couple of minor negatives:  the first episode, which introduces an enormous number of characters and sets the main wheels of the plot in motion, is rather heavy going, but stick with it and you'll be well rewarded.  Second, in several scenes where characters are in disputatious conversation in which their points of view are diametrically opposed, the director chose to show both characters in the frame, but throw whichever of them was not speaking out of focus.  This technique not only belabored the obvious point that the characters were in conflict, but also proved quite distracting and visually annoying.  But these are minor quibbles.

I never read Galworthy in college (though now I wish I had, though, sad to say, even if it had been assigned I probably would have relied on Cliff Notes.) However, I chose this set to watch inasmuch as I have written and had published several novels taking place during this period (Lily Queen, Alienation of Affection, among others, which have been well received), and thought it high time I read more of the authors who wrote of this period. I thought this set was extraordinary good, but having read the sixty or so reviews of it (many of which compared it unfavorably to the original 1967 series), I immediately got ahold of the 1967 version so I could decide for myself. Reminding myself of a quote from one of Galsworthy's characters (""comparisons are odious), I was equally impressed by the 1967 version and can understand completely how it grasped the imagination of Britain at the time, and can only imagine how each Saturday night was one of great anticipation. Both versions are outstanding in their own way, and I surely would not have been interested in watching the second version were it merely a carbon copy of the first. Nyrene's beauty in the first was as spectacular as Galworthy would have wished had he cast it, though I am convinced he would have liked Gina's character just as well in a different way. I must disagree with those who insist that only a ""classic"" beauty would have fit Galworthy's vision. There are so many vacuous beauties who might fit a narrow requirement of beauty, but in my experience the woman who inspire the deepest admiration and adoration are those who go beyond (Cleopatra comes to mind, who,  though not an exceptional classic beauty,inspired the deepest pasions of two of history's greatest figures). In many ways, Gina, whose beauty is concededly breathtaking,  is absolutely perfect in every other way as well, though admittedly in a different way from Nyene, who is also ""perfect"" in the context of the earlier production. Though I confess to being more of a sucker for the rich production values (particualry the street scenes) in the second version, the dialogue and character development in both versions overshadow completely the production values. This is quite the reverse of most current productions in both film and TV, in which a film is (apparently) far more valued for its production values--special effects, chase scenes, etc.--than for its plot or character development. I enjoyed both of these versions in their own right, including the characterizations of Soammes in both.

The Forsyte Saga makes it to the top of my list as an enjoyable treat of English life.  I'm often fascinated over how the rich lived in the Victorian age.  My English family made bricks; while families like these lived lives of luxury filled with all sorts of soap opera antics.As far as the characters, the central focus of Soames and Irene was interesting.  Frankly, my heart went out to the proper, stout Englishman who adored a woman, wanted to be loved in return, and desired children.  His passion, of course, borders on obsession, but you can't help but feel sorry for the poor man who never found a woman to love him.As far as Irene, I felt absolutely no sympathy for that woman whatsoever.  Perhaps my heart was a cold as the one she portrayed of stone with little remorse over the hurt she caused others in her life.  She was an interesting character who grated upon me throughout the series, which good characters are supposed to do!As far as the remaining hours, they were an interesting treat of English life and the gorgeous dresses and costumes.  No matter what English movie I watch, the birds are always chirping in the background.  Only problem I did have was the period jump in years that went from five, six, twelve and not one gray hair made it on anyone's head!  They all seemed to be ageless.  A little more realism in that arena would have been better. Otherwise enjoyable.

The story begins in the 1880s and follows the trials and tribulations of a large upper middle class Victorian family by the name of Forsyte. The main story revolves around Soames Forsyte (Damian Lewis), a successful London solicitor whose strait-laced manner and stiff upper lip make him a bit socially awkward. He sees a beautiful young woman one night at the opera while visiting Bournemouth on business. The young lady in question, a Ms. Irene Heren (Gina McKee), has recently lost her faher, and has been left at the mercy of a less than benign stepmother who is determined to marry her charge off to a rich man. Soames immediately falls in love with Irene and pursues her relentlessly only to be rebuffed again and again as Irene is determined to marry only for love. It is only out of sheer desperation that she finally capitulates and becomes Soames' wife, a union that leaves both of them disappointed and unhappy.There are other characters that round off this production such as Old Jolyon who is portrayed as a wise old man whose son, Young Jolyon leaves his wife and young daughter to run off with the beautiful governess. This may seem sordid but it is only so on the surface as Young Jolyon's marriage was not one based on love and he does find true love with Helene, the governess. There's Soames' sister, Winifred (Amanda Root ofPersuasion) whose love marriage to a womanizer and gaming man brings her a load of grief.Initially, I found Gina McKee to be rather an odd choice as the beautiful, much fancied woman, Irene because frankly speaking she did not seem all that beautiful, but I guess this is a matter of perspective. At the beginning of the series, she seemed too cold and indifferent and I could not fathom why so many men found her irresistible. Later on though, McKee gets into the role and embraces it with such emotion that I found her performance to be credible and natural. Her soft modulated tones are such a pleasure to hear.I hope to read the novels and compare this production with the books, though from the reviews it appears that the older adaptation might be judged superior. I shall have to look that adaptation up too. For now, I found this new adaptation to be visually pleasing with compelling performances by the cast and look forward to the second part.",4,Riveting period drama,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2470,"['confess', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'Galsworthy', 'novels', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'watching', 'series', 'especially', 'was', 'available', 'free', 'download', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'members', 'story', '1880s', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'large', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Victorian', 'family', 'name', 'Forsyte', 'main', 'story', 'revolves', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'successful', 'London', 'solicitor', 'strait-laced', 'manner', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'make', 'bit', 'socially', 'awkward', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'night', 'opera', 'visiting', 'Bournemouth', 'business', 'young', 'lady', 'question', 'Ms.', 'Irene', 'Heren', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'recently', 'lost', 'faher', 'been', 'left', 'mercy', 'less', 'benign', 'stepmother', 'who', 'determined', 'marry', 'charge', 'rich', 'man', 'Soames', 'immediately', 'love', 'Irene', 'relentlessly', 'only', 'be', 'rebuffed', 'again', 'again', 'Irene', 'determined', 'marry', 'only', 'love', 'only', 'sheer', 'desperation', 'finally', 'capitulates', 'Soames', 'wife', 'union', 'disappointed', 'unhappy.There', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'round', 'off', 'production', 'such', 'Old', 'Jolyon', 'who', 'portrayed', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'son', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'run', 'off', 'beautiful', 'governess', 'may', 'seem', 'sordid', 'only', 'so', 'surface', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'marriage', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'based', 'love', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'Helene', 'governess', 'Soames', 'sister', 'Winifred', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'ofPersuasion', 'love', 'marriage', 'womanizer', 'gaming', 'man', 'load', 'grief.Initially', 'found', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'be', 'rather', 'odd', 'choice', 'beautiful', 'much', 'fancied', 'woman', 'Irene', 'frankly', 'speaking', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'beautiful', 'guess', 'matter', 'perspective', 'beginning', 'series', 'seemed', 'too', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'found', 'irresistible', 'Later', 'McKee', 'role', 'such', 'emotion', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'credible', 'natural', 'soft', 'modulated', 'tones', 'are', 'such', 'pleasure', 'hear.I', 'hope', 'read', 'novels', 'compare', 'production', 'books', 'reviews', 'older', 'adaptation', 'might', 'be', 'judged', 'superior', 'shall', 'have', 'look', 'adaptation', 'up', 'too', 'now', 'found', 'new', 'adaptation', 'be', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'compelling', 'performances', 'cast', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'part']",N/A
