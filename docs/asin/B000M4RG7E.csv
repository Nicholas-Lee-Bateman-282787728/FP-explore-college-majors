The Science of Sleep would be such a movie, except it deserves a weirdness category all on its on.The blending of reality and dreams in this film is portrayed quite well. In fact, towards the end of the movie it's hard to distinguish what is happening to the main character and what is in his head. Unfortunately, the main character is so unsympathetic that the audience hardly cares as to his ultimate fate.Some will argue that this movie is a sweet romantic fantasy. If you want an unusual romantic fantasy that's sweet, with characters you want to know more about, about whose fate you'll truly care, check outMe and You and Everyone We Know.If you want a French movie that has personality and transcends border lines and is romantic, watchAmelie.If you do decide to watch The Science of Sleep, make sure that you fall asleep during it - at least it will be a good use of our time and your subconscious will absorb the ridiculousness of this film anyway.",2,"weird, but not in a good way",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1043,"['so', 'often', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movie', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'categorize', 'rate', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'movie', 'weirdness', 'category', 'on.The', 'blending', 'reality', 'dreams', 'film', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'what', 'happening', 'main', 'character', 'what', 'head', 'Unfortunately', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'unsympathetic', 'audience', 'hardly', 'ultimate', 'fate.Some', 'will', 'argue', 'movie', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'want', 'unusual', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'sweet', 'characters', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'fate', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'care', 'check', 'outMe', 'Everyone', 'Know.If', 'want', 'French', 'movie', 'personality', 'transcends', 'border', 'lines', 'romantic', 'watchAmelie.If', 'do', 'decide', 'watch', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'make', 'sure', 'fall', 'asleep', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'use', 'time', 'subconscious', 'will', 'absorb', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'anyway']",N/A

I found it visually very interesting and well-acted but lacking in the narrative drive and emotional heft of that masterpiece. The movie is clever, maybe too clever -- as if the director was seduced by his own cleverness.We meet Stephane played by the appealing Gael Garcia Bernal, moving back to his mother's apartment in Paris from Mexico after the death of his father. The apartment next door is occupied by the fetching Stephanie, played by the fetching Charlotte Gainsbourg. Though his native tongue is Spanish and hers French, they communicate in English -- adding a sweet displacement to their discourse.Stephane has what can only be described as an active dreamlife -- in fact he's the host of his own dreamworld TV late night chat show. The dream sequences are visually inventive and sometimes amusing -- but they intrude more and more until Stephane -- and we as viewers -- have increasing difficulty distinguishing dreams from reality.Stephane would like to have a relationship with Stephanie but seems to use dreams as a way of avoiding growing up. When not dreaming, he's often burrowing into his childish bed in womb position. As the film becomes more and more incoherent, the issue seems to be whether Stephane will take permanent refuge in unreality or whether Stephanie can force him back into reality.The problem is that we don't care enough one way or the other. Unlike ""Eternal Sunshine..."" in which characters with real souls struggled with a tragic dilemma, here I had the feeling of a director playing with his characters, constructing pretty scenarios for them to pose in, neglecting their true humanity.It's not a bad movie and as I said visually it's very inventive. But it misses the heights of the director's previous effort because of his cavalier attitude toward his own characters.",3,"Pretty, well-acted but rather baffling",1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1898,"['loved', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'too', 'found', 'visually', 'very', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'lacking', 'narrative', 'drive', 'emotional', 'heft', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'clever', 'maybe', 'too', 'clever', 'director', 'was', 'seduced', 'own', 'cleverness.We', 'meet', 'Stephane', 'played', 'appealing', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'moving', 'back', 'mother', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'Mexico', 'death', 'father', 'apartment', 'next', 'door', 'occupied', 'fetching', 'Stephanie', 'played', 'fetching', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'native', 'tongue', 'Spanish', 'hers', 'French', 'communicate', 'English', 'adding', 'sweet', 'displacement', 'discourse.Stephane', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'active', 'dreamlife', 'fact', 'host', 'own', 'dreamworld', 'TV', 'late', 'night', 'chat', 'show', 'dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'visually', 'inventive', 'sometimes', 'amusing', 'intrude', 'more', 'more', 'Stephane', 'viewers', 'have', 'increasing', 'difficulty', 'distinguishing', 'dreams', 'reality.Stephane', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'relationship', 'Stephanie', 'use', 'dreams', 'way', 'avoiding', 'growing', 'up', 'When', 'not', 'dreaming', 'often', 'burrowing', 'childish', 'bed', 'womb', 'position', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'incoherent', 'issue', 'be', 'Stephane', 'will', 'take', 'permanent', 'refuge', 'unreality', 'Stephanie', 'can', 'force', 'back', 'reality.The', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'characters', 'real', 'souls', 'struggled', 'tragic', 'dilemma', 'here', 'had', 'feeling', 'director', 'playing', 'characters', 'constructing', 'pretty', 'scenarios', 'pose', 'neglecting', 'true', 'humanity.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'said', 'visually', 'very', 'inventive', 'heights', 'director', 'previous', 'effort', 'cavalier', 'attitude', 'own', 'characters']",N/A

It's about a young man's inability to separate his sleeping, dreaming, and waking states which lead to wacky situations. The elaborate dream sequences are quite imaginative and fun to watch.

Particularly enjoyable is director Michel Gondry's various delightful and low-tech sets and special effects. At its best moments, the movie resembles the work of a prodigiously talented film student; it has that mix of unbridled creativity, innocence, and yes, even an endearing pretentiousness.And yet as soon as the film was over, I felt disappointed. It seemed to me that perhaps TOO much thought went into the movie's design, leaving the story somwehat malnourished. As the film is mostly in the form of a dream, this may seem like a nonsensical criticism, so let me amend my criticism; Stephane (played by the gifted Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) comes across as eccentric, perhaps even mentally ill. Fine, fine. But in the end, he also convinces us that he is infantile, and perhaps even irredeemably creepy and less interesting than we thought.Roll credits and cue disappointment.

1043624,AZKXH0J59TK11,B000M4RG7E,"Ben Dugan ""Ben Dugan""","[5, 10]","""The Science of Sleep"", director Michel Gondry's followup fictional piece to his modern classic ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""(he also directed the enjoyable ""Dave Chappelle's Block Party""), is both a great movie and a frustrating one, and one of the few movies I have seen this year that I would tell everyone they need to check out.Visually, the film is a treat, unlike anything that you've probably ever seen before. Gondry continues to work old school, no computer digital effects and green screen, rather opting for camera tricks and it gives the film an odd, one of a kind look. The vibe reminded me of a French New Wave picture but updated, and to say that watching the movie was an actual experience is an understatement.Listening to it however is something different. The script, by Gondry, gives little in the way of actual plot, and leaves the charactors one dimensional for the mostpart of the movie.  This is the movies principal flaw. It's as if Gondry came up with all the visual ideas and started shooting, as opposed to putting the images into a coherant story and giving scenes to the actors to build their charactors. Gael Garcia Bernal and Charlotte Gainsbourg both deliver good performances despite, Bernal ecspeccially showcasing his little scene comedic shops, and he reminded me a little of Buster Keaton in his mannerisms and reactions, a high compliment indeed.""The Science of Sleep"" works best if you just let it flow over you like a dream, and you donot bother paying attention to the specifics. It's a must see movie and, as said before, it is one of a kind. It's the only movie I have seen this year when I can honestly say I have never seen anything like it, and the techinical talent on display is obvious. But it's lack of believable and sympathetic charactors keep it from being the great movie it almost it.8/10",4,There is a science to sleeping? Wow.

Erland,"[13, 20]","`The Science of Sleep' released in `06 is a delightfully original, inventive journey into the somewhat unstable world of Stephane Miroux (Gael Garcia Bernal) a bored graphic designer in search of a job that will allow the full expression of his artistic abilities. Stephanes' world is a place where waking reality and dream images converge in a never ending collage of parallel, synchronized, random thoughts and events. His interior personal reality continually merges and separates with the exterior collective reality in cyclic waves of consciousness leaving him to deal with the flotsam and jetsam of both worlds.Things were confusing enough for poor Stephane when he was unattached. Now with the looming prospect of a love interest living in the apartment next door, Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), can Stephane bring the inner and outer harmoniously together and find true love?

1043626,A2MPXQB68PGSM8,B000M4RG7E,Chris Howard,"[7, 8]","The Science of Sleep is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Just finished watching it for the first time. It is the masterpiece of Michael Gondry, director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It is literally a work of art. The closest thing I have seen to it is Mirrormask, directed by Dave McKean.The Science of Sleep is the story of Stephane Miroux. Stephane confuses his dreams with reality. He cannot tell which is which. Languages are constantly switched throughout the movie from Spanish to English to French. The movie takes place in France. Stephane falls in love with his neighbor, Stephanie, who lives in his apartment complex. She is one of the few people in his life who understand him to an extent. She is a creative type and is an artist, which attracts Stephane. Rather than mock him, she works with him in his dream worlds; creates with him; brings imagination to life.Gondry shows us one of the most human movies I have seen in years. It is heartbreaking, heartwarming, charming, witty, and most of all imaginative. Gondry shows us what it is like to be Stephane. We experience this film from Stephane's eyes and his point of view, which is far from the ""normal"" point of view. But what is the normal point of view? Stephane's world seems very attractive to the viewer, but Gondry shows us that while it may look like an exciting way of viewing life, it is really a curse at times. Stephane's strongest and weakest points spring from his illness.Why this movie wasn't nominated for any awards I don't know. As I said before, it is filmed beautifully, the art direction is beyond superb, Gael Garcia Bernal gives a wonderful performance as Stephane, and it is the first look (though it may be an exaggerated look) into mental illness that I have seen portrayed so humanly and so directly behind the eyes of a person. I highly recommend this film to everyone.

1043628,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000M4RG7E,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","Music-video director Michael Gondry is known for doing some of the most inventive and strange videos ever, from many a White Stripes video to Beck and Foo Fighters and Bjork, Gondry took that style into his first film, ""Human Nature"" but hit paydirt with the delightful ""Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind"". Naturally, any huge film has to have the dreaded follow-up where it might not be as successful and well-liked with people calling it disappointing and I wouldn't call Science of Sleep disappointing but the charm that Spotless Mind has in spades is only found a little bit here.Stephane is an aspiring graphic designer who returns to live near his mom after his father dies. Instead of best using his talents, he's hired to paste paper onto calendars. By chance, and a little injury, he meets Stephanie and Zoe, with the former being his new neighbor. Although attracted to Zoe, he suspects its Stephanie who likes him and he soon starts fantasizing a romance with Stephanie since one in the real world doesn't seem likely but his dreams start to interfere with his life and he can awake from one and be thrown into the next.In many ways, Gondry's films, namely this one and Sunshine have themes that everyone can relate to but they don't necessarily have to follow the rules of reality. While the previous film was essentially a love story played out in someone's head, Science is about the longing for something you probably won't have and the fantasies becoming more easier to have than the real life. In many ways I can relate to this idea and while I won't be waking out of my fantasies anytime soon, the idea of what we think is unrequited love is a universal one and luckily Science doesn't just simply deal with it in plain terms.One of the nice things about Science is that it manages to have a sweet tone even if the story feels kind of sluggish. There's only so much crazy to show before it feels like we're just spinning our wheels in the air and not a lot of story developments happen. The neighbor Zoe at one point drops from the story and one fantasy even a co-worker doesn't go anywhere in the real life that it makes you wonder what's the point in it if he doesn't act on it? But the images, with characters looking like they're flying to cellophane acting like water to a TV set made of cardboard, the inventive visuals are just as welcome as they were in the videos.As for the acting, we have Gael Garcia Bernal who is always good, Charlotte Gainsbourg who has a unique attractive quality even though her neighbor friend might look cuter to some but Charlotte just has a quality about her where you would find her the more appealing. The rest of the cast is good too like Alain Chabat as Stephane's filthy-minded co-worker friend but this is mainly the Stephane and Stephanie show so it's not really ground for co-stars to be bigger but they do fill in the edges nicely.It's best if you watch the film without thinking you're seeing Sunshine part 2 so if you watch the film just as it is, you can find a delightfully quirky movie.",4,"Love can make you crazy, or crazier",1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,3060,"['Music-video', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'known', 'doing', 'most', 'inventive', 'strange', 'videos', 'ever', 'many', 'White', 'Stripes', 'video', 'Beck', 'Foo', 'Fighters', 'Bjork', 'Gondry', 'took', 'style', 'first', 'film', 'Human', 'Nature', 'hit', 'paydirt', 'delightful', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Naturally', 'huge', 'film', 'have', 'dreaded', 'follow-up', 'where', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'successful', 'well-liked', 'people', 'calling', 'disappointing', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'disappointing', 'charm', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'spades', 'only', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'here.Stephane', 'aspiring', 'graphic', 'designer', 'who', 'live', 'mom', 'father', 'dies', 'Instead', 'best', 'using', 'talents', 'hired', 'paste', 'paper', 'calendars', 'chance', 'little', 'injury', 'Stephanie', 'Zoe', 'former', 'being', 'new', 'neighbor', 'attracted', 'Zoe', 'Stephanie', 'who', 'soon', 'fantasizing', 'romance', 'Stephanie', 'one', 'real', 'world', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'dreams', 'start', 'interfere', 'life', 'can', 'awake', 'one', 'be', 'thrown', 'next.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Gondry', 'films', 'namely', 'one', 'Sunshine', 'have', 'themes', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'follow', 'rules', 'reality', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'essentially', 'love', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'someone', 'head', 'Science', 'longing', 'something', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'fantasies', 'becoming', 'more', 'easier', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'relate', 'idea', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'waking', 'fantasies', 'anytime', 'soon', 'idea', 'what', 'think', 'unrequited', 'love', 'universal', 'one', 'luckily', 'Science', ""n't"", 'just', 'simply', 'deal', 'plain', 'terms.One', 'nice', 'things', 'Science', 'have', 'sweet', 'tone', 'even', 'story', 'feels', 'kind', 'sluggish', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'crazy', 'show', ""'re"", 'just', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'air', 'not', 'lot', 'story', 'developments', 'happen', 'neighbor', 'Zoe', 'one', 'point', 'drops', 'story', 'one', 'fantasy', 'even', 'co-worker', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'real', 'life', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', ""n't"", 'act', 'images', 'characters', 'looking', ""'re"", 'flying', 'cellophane', 'acting', 'water', 'TV', 'set', 'made', 'cardboard', 'inventive', 'visuals', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'welcome', 'were', 'videos.As', 'acting', 'have', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'who', 'unique', 'attractive', 'quality', 'even', 'neighbor', 'friend', 'might', 'look', 'cuter', 'Charlotte', 'just', 'quality', 'where', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'appealing', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'too', 'like', 'Alain', 'Chabat', 'Stephane', 'filthy-minded', 'co-worker', 'friend', 'mainly', 'Stephane', 'Stephanie', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'ground', 'co-stars', 'be', 'bigger', 'do', 'fill', 'edges', 'nicely.It', 'best', 'watch', 'film', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Sunshine', 'part', '2', 'so', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'find', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'movie']",N/A

Chen,"[6, 8]","Some film reviewers labeled French filmmaker Michel Gondry's critically-acclaimed ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (with its Charlie Kaufman script) as ""Gondry lite"" or ""Gondry for beginners.""  If that's the case, you certainly get ""the full Gondry"" in his surreal but stunning ""The Science of Sleep.""St&eacute;phane Miroux (Gael Garcia Bernal) has just arrived in Paris from Mexico to live in his childhood home.  An artist, St&eacute;phane thought his mother had found him an important design job with a calendar publishing company. Unfortunately, he only has a menial layout task and hates his job.  St&eacute;phane, however, can escape from daily stresses into his own private world.  He's got quite a creative mind and a vivid imagination... his strange daydreams frequently seem to intersect with reality in often frightening ways.An accident leads him to meet St&eacute;phanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), his new next-door neighbor.  St&eacute;phane thinks he's falling for her best friend Zoe, but he soon realizes that he's more attracted to St&eacute;phanie's equally creative mind.  It's not quite clear whether the feeling is mutual, however - especially when she doesn't know quite how to deal with his impulsive behavior and random utterances.Gondry has taken bits of his innermost subconscious mind and made them explode like fireworks on the movie screen.  ""The Science of Sleep"" initially seems a completely disjointed mess in multiple languages, and the ending leaves audiences guessing somewhat.  The journey through the film with quirky St&eacute;phane, however, is an intriguing one.What makes this movie quite effective is Gondry's mastery of simple visual effects.  While the film does not use some of the seamless special effects that were the hallmark of ""Eternal Sunshine,"" it is still no less of a visual feast. The projections, stop-motion animation sequences and bizarre sets which bring St&eacute;phane's imagination to life truly give audiences the dizzy feeling of weaving back and forth across the line separating dreams and reality.Garcia Bernal gives an incredible performance as the reality-challenged St&eacute;phane, and Gallic beauty Gainsbourg quietly charms audiences as St&eacute;phanie.

Peppered with some of the weirdest scenes imaginable, Gondry guides this bizarre, sublime little movie to heights that most directors couldn't even dream of. (Pun intended)St&eacute;phane Miroux (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) is a creative young dreamer from Mexico, who is lured back to Paris to live with his widowed mother. Unfortunately, the job she gets him is dull and creativity-free -- making calendars. The only upside is Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a young woman who has moved into the same building.Though he is initially attracted to her roommate, he soon finds that it is Stephanie he likes. Their involvement starts off well, but soon St&eacute;phane has bungled things. He becomes increasingly wrapped up in his bizarre dreams, which are encroaching on his view of ""reality."" Will reality or dreams triumph, and will St&eacute;phane be won over by love?With a movie like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" under his belt, it must be hard for Gondry to try to surpass himself. And while ""Science of Sleep"" is another exploration of the mind, it's a radically different kind of movie -- visual, quirky, and with a bittersweet edge. It has some disjointed moments, and it's not nearly as accessable, but the overall effect is like one long dream.In a way, this movie is about escaping reality, into the labyrinth of your mind -- it might make you feel better for awhile, but ultimately it won't solve your problems, or improve your life. And to find love, you have to face the pain of reality. By the finale, some measure of peace is attained -- but still its meaning is utterly ambiguous. The viewer can decide what happens.For the visuals, Gondry falls back on his music-video past. His music videos for the White Stripes, Bjork and Chemical Brothers were all wonderfully strange, and this movie is full of kittycat suits, enormous hands, and other magical items that seem plucked from a child's whimsical daydream. Even the mundane surroundings are colourful and striking.Bernal plays a difficult character -- let's face it, St&eacute;phane is rather strange, with a child's wonder and selfishness. But through glimpses into St&eacute;phane's mind, Gondry creates sympathy for his awkwardness and creativity, and his yearning for love. The scenes where St&eacute;phane and Stephanie (similar names for similar people) make things together has a curiously innocent intimacy.Whimsical and almost hallucinogenic, ""The Science of Sleep"" is one of the most unique and compelling movies of the last year.

All the cardboard animation (something perhaps fortunately missing from the previous film) gets a bit overdone and tiring after a while, I was sorely tempted to fast forward through some of it.  I know the arts and crafts story element is supposed to work as a metaphor for the human imagination, but it did seem to get a little redundant at times.Still, I was glad that I rented this film.  Gael Garcia Bernal and Charlotte Gainsborough, the two main leads, are always a pleasure to watch and in this film they are supported by a strong cast---particularly the neanderthal co-worker Guy.  The camera work is quite interesting, a lot of unusual angles here.

1043636,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000M4RG7E,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 8]","It's no coincidence that this surreal 2006 film bears such a striking resemblance to 2004's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" since Michel Gondry directed both. The difference is that Charlie Kaufman's particular idiosyncrasies have not been recruited this time for the screenplay as Gondry chose to express his own by himself. Both films share an audacious visual style, but Gondry's solo effort feels less humane than ""Eternal Sunshine"" or another French film that seems to be a source of inspiration, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Am&eacute;lie"". Over the course of the film, the plot remains agonizingly distant from the characters in a way that makes their ultimate resolution less than enthralling, and much of the problem has to do with the way the characters have been developed.The plot focuses on the travails of St&eacute;phane Miroux, who leaves Mexico after his father's death to become a graphic artist at a Paris print shop. He feels constrained by the commercial limitations set forth by his boss who doesn't care for St&eacute;phane's disaster-of-the-month calendar idea. In Walter Mitty-like fashion, his fantasy world takes flight with a fanciful TV show showcasing his random thoughts on the everyday life he experiences. Inevitably, St&eacute;phane is caught between his reality and his dreams in a way that simultaneously charms and alienates his coincidentally named neighbor, St&eacute;phanie. Even though St&eacute;phane is tempted by her more vivacious friend Zoe, he recognizes a kindred spirit in St&eacute;phanie that haunts him obsessively.Gondry lends his dazzling images and sharp wit in many of the vignettes that track the narrative, but they begin to feel repetitious and undermine the emotional resonance that he is obviously seeking. The performances partially compensate as Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal displays dexterity with whimsy as St&eacute;phane that makes the character surprisingly fresh and relaxed in spite of the script limitations. In contrast to Bernal, Charlotte Gainsbourg underplays St&eacute;phanie with a nice delicacy and quiet intelligence. The rest of the cast are really just caricatures designed to move the plot along, even legendary French actress Miou-Miou as St&eacute;phane's put-upon mother.The 2007 DVD has a robust set of extras starting with an appealing but oddly lacking commentary track with Gondry, Bernal, Gainsbourg and Sacha Bourdo, who plays St&eacute;phane's smarmy co-worker Serge.

Already a dreamer, Stephane finds his dream world spinning out of control and blurring with reality when he falls in love with his neighbour, Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a woman who seems to be Stephane's perfect match.I was almost put off this film by its trailer. For those who haven't seen the trailer, it essentially portrays this film as a romantic comedy about two unusual people who somehow find each other and whom you know will go off happily in the end - yawn! Seen it before and didn't like it then...or so I thought. It was only the promise of the animated sequences that eventually got me to break down and watch this film and I'm glad I did. Although this film contains many of the elements of a typical romantic comedy, it has incredibly dark undertones to it that make it far more interesting than any films I have ever seen in this genre.Instead of making Stephane into a lovable dreamer living in some sort of parallel universe where he is sheltered from the horrors of reality, writer/director Michel Gondry places Stephane firmly in the real world, allowing the audience to see the real consequences of Stephane's actions and the tragic implications of them. This is a move that strikes me as being incredibly brave and I'm sure disagreed with many viewers. That's not to say that this film is depressing, though. Throughout the film, Gondry allows the audience to see Stephane dreams, animated sequences that can best be described as what Ray Harryhausen's special effects would look like if Harryhausen was only allowed to use toilet rolls and cellophane. These scenes lighten the film immensely, and are so fun that, even if you don't want to see the rest of the film, I would recommend just watching these.""The Science of Sleep"" is a film that will probably not appeal to all tastes.

1043640,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000M4RG7E,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","The French have a way with films that tinker with reality, fantasy, illusions, and delusions and the result of those traits have produced some of the most exciting and avant garde films ever made.  Michel Gondry has inherited the mantle from Cocteau, Resnais, etc and runs with it in this charming little diversion of a film THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP.Gondry is primarily a visual artist and tells his stories in a visual manner, but that is not to say his stories are superficial or trivial: he has a preoccupation with the thin line between reality and non-reality, between dream and diurnal creativity, and it is this space that occupies his mind, his pen, his camera, and his mission in this little tale.St&eacute;phane Miroux (the enormously gifted, dedicated and hunky Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) is a true 'artist', a young man whose father is Mexican and whose mother is French, and he has entered Paris to begin a job his mother Christine (Miou-Miou) assures him is creative: it actually is a boring, restricting graphic design outfit (though populated by some zany confr&egrave;res including Guy played beautifully by Alain Chabat who allows to run with his idea of publishing a calendar whose months are pictured by world disasters!) that at first defeats St&eacute;phane's artistic integrity.St&eacute;phane dreams and in his dream life he is a TV host who can make the most impossible things happen.  His work frustrations push him further into his dream world and he finds it more real than the mundane life of daytime.  He lives across the hall from an equally delicate artistic mind named St&eacute;phanie (the always fine and adroit Charlotte Gainsbourg) who is caught up in her own dream world of making little boats of paper and water of cellophane and clouds of cotton. The two begin a touch and run relationship that gradually develops into a mutual appreciation for each other's idiosyncrasies - in the best of all possible ways.Gondry peppers his script with make-believe constructions, testy conversations, and some very funny and naughty observations that he tosses off with aplomb.  Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal infuses this strange role with a facile use of three languages (English, French and Spanish) and with a tender sense of comic timing and sensual magnetism that makes him irresistible.  He carries the fantasy on his capable shoulders allowing us to love his bizarrely complex character at every quirky turn.  He is an actor who takes more risks than most and is destined to be one of our more important actors as he continues to gain attention.For those who need sharp margins of linearity and borders between reality and fantasy, this film may confuse and frustrate.  But for viewers who love 'taking rides through dream fantasies on felt horses' this film is sure to please.

Science of sleep shows the hapless Stefan trying to disentangle various obstacles in his way to try to reach his neighbor stefani. The fact that he doesn't speak fluent French hardly works for him because when he is around her he says the most silly of things that no one who has ever had a girlfriend would say to a girl they dig. The director tries to give the cemtral character an alter  ego in which he is guarded about sexual talk when he is in conversation  with his voracious natured co employee,Guy. This is contradictory of course, he tries to be cute by inventing  things which don't exist in real life and it's almost creepy how he tries to stalk his neighbor. All this while a parallel tv show showing the science of sleep goes on his mind, I found this particularly stressing and anything but arty. The film does try to weigh in viewers with art but I doubt it won any favors with me in this discourse.When science of sleep was just trying to be a simple film about a shy guy who is helping his neighbor move a piano it was good but somehow it ends in its own fate of sleep, awake disturbia which hardly proved to be charming or cute.I blame Gabriel Garcia bernal also for the failure of this film, he wasn't cast aptly. He is a man to do well in Mexican cinema not complicated plots such as this one. He hardly seems like an intriguing hip inventor with a half French background.As far as Charolette is concerned she has done some terrible films like Antichrist and melancholia.

1043644,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000M4RG7E,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","This is a very European production. ""The Science of Sleep"" permeates with the viewer even more than ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"" did after its first viewing because its more impulsive and creative. Michel Gondry, now having three full-feature films under his belt, does penetrate the very core of our dreams, and somehow makes us believe that we can too.In the beginning of this film we can clearly see that Stephane, played by the charming Gael Garcia Bernal, has problems distinguishing dreams from reality. Stephane at first, lived in Mexico with his father, then moves to Paris with his mother after his father death. Taking up a boring and unsatisfying job, he often flees to an imaginary world. He falls in love with his new neighbor Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourgh). She herself is some sort of a dreamer, though more grounded in reality than Stephane. Though smitten by his fantastic world and creativity helps kick off their relationship. Now as the movie progresses Gondry blurs this concrete line and it becomes difficult for us to see the difference. This is a key part of the film, and seems to keep the impulse to a minimum while keeping us more in tune with Stephanes fantasies. Like everyone Stephane does, in his dreams, what he wants to do in reality, but can never muster the nerve to.What's astonishing about this film is the sheer surreal childlike quality that Gondry is able to keep throughout the film. It's like an 8 year old was allowed to let his imagination go loose. Seldom have we seen such an inventive world on screen. The acting is naturally impressive. Gael Garcia Bernal is the perfect choice for Stephane. Though his character is a little bit uncanny (to say at least), he's able to make us feel sympathy for his character, especially at the end which is no small accomplishment.

1043650,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000M4RG7E,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 1]","The trilingual French comedy ""The Science of Sleep"" is the life of an overly imaginative young Mexican-Frenchman (St&eacute;phane played by Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) that develops a crush on his neighbor (St&eacute;phanie played by Charlotte Gainsbourg.) What makes the film interesting and memorable is Stephane being an artistic fellow with a runaway imagination who dreams of hosting a television talk show and creating artistic rendering including water that is in fact cellophane and a future machine. His flirtations with Stephanie, the renter that lives across the hall in the building owned by his mother, are all built around these daydreams of artistry.This is a film of brilliant endeavor and the ultimate creativity. Stephane's life, as told through the film, is a merger of fantasy and reality with the two often so mixed you can't tell the difference. It also has a wonderful script most 20-somethings will readily identify with in terms of youthful verve and spirit.The movie was clearly influenced by other films, none more than Robert DeNiro's 1981 tour de force, ""The King of Comedy,"" where the storylines of wanton fame, sexual desire, and glory and the intermingling of real life (real life in the movies, that is) and fantasy or dreamscape are regularly intertwined.While ""The King of Comedy""The King of Comedywas more tangible than ""The Science of Sleep,"" the two are a mated pair developed a quarter-century apart on similar themes and values. Even though none of ""King""'s black comedy came through in the French-English-Spanish speaking (with subtitiles for the trilingually impaired) gentleness and joyfulness of ""The Science of Sleep,"" the two share laugh out loud moments and an endearing comic spirit throughout. In one memorable scene, Stephane awakes from one of his dreams -- that you don't know isn't reality until he awakes -- to find his feet in the freezer covered with frost.""The Science of Sleep"" won't go down on anyone's list of 25 greatest films yet it is a memorable comedy infected with moments of pathos and sensitivity that will have you cheering for the lead characters. I'd never seen Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal before and he is very effective in the lead role. Charlotte Gainsbourg has a larger filmography; many have seen her in 2003's ""21 Grams"" and she was the victim of the 1999 thriller, ""The Intruder."" She does well here and has excellent chemistry with her male counterpart.Any fan of foreign film or comedy or even love stories should give this movie a whirl. It's unlikely you've ever seen anything like it no matter how many movies you watch. It is a delight and maintains interest throughout, even with something of a cop-out ending. It's not easy to end a movie as episodically artistic as this one -- with a limited plotline built around a couple characters whose interactions revolve around art in fantasy -- and they didn't quite overcome that hurdle, sending the pair riding off on a salt and pepper stallion at the end.

Unfortunately, the film spends more energy on the fantastic way it tells the story than on telling a story.  In short, we go through all these dreamlike images of hands that suddenly become huge, a dancing donkey or Bernal flying over a claymation-like cityscape, but that don't further the story.  As an actor, Gael Garcia Bernal is such a nice looking young guy that you seem to want to root for him.  However, he became increasingly strange and unlikable as the film went on.  Bernal won the Best Supporting Actor Award from the French Academy of Cinema in 1999 for ""La Buche"" and was impressive in ""The Motorcycle Diaries.""  As Stephane, he's more neurotic.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if he's asleep or awake; or in which world the big change in his life is supposed to happen.  Apparently, that change is supposed to be that he falls in love.  The film teases romance with Stephanie who lives across the hall.  I think we have the male Stephane and the female Stephanie's names selected to show a kindred spirit connection, but it becomes a bit confusing such as the film being spoken in Spanish, French and English intermittently.  Emma De Cannes who will be in ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" this year plays Stephanie's friend Zoe to who Stephane is attracted.  This is an odd complication since it's never clear which girl Stephane wants; and he seems never to be able to make a decision.  Then you have Alain Chabat as the obnoxious Guy showing up at work and in bars with his one-track mind.  Chabat was nominated for the French Academy of Cinema's Best Supporting Actor award in 2000 for ""The Taste of Others,"" but it's hard to see why with this one-note role and performance.  Overall, the film doesn't go anywhere.  Yes, it does make creative use of fantasy and absurd cinematic elements, but unfortunately they don't serve to tell a story.

The moments of private craziness and creativity. The magic of that emotional bond on young hearts.

Michel Gondry's The Science of Sleep may be the movie one may be wanting to spend an hour and forty-three minutes watching that may have the mind doing cartwheels and creating a topsy-turvy and wacky affect on the two major human senses of sight and sound.  No, this is not an episode of the Twilight Zone but possibly much more unpredictable than that.  Indeed, the film has comparisons to Gondry's previous works, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a very close resemblance to the major themes examined in this film, but it also bears a slight comparison or parallel to other films that involve a major character wanting to explain the ins and outs of the individual's dilemmas, Ameli&eacute; is another film that shows the intricacies of the human condition that includes the mind and dreams that accompany the interpretations.When first watching the first half hour of Science, there appears to be a great amount of disconnect and disarray that is shown between main character of St&eacute;phane (Gael Garcia Bernal) and the surroundings around him as well as the viewer attempting to comprehend the ambiguity and fragmentation.  It is those factors that make the film quite fascinating to the viewer that shows that films can still be creative and thought provoking.  Two major themes are played throughout the film but more may come to mind that stretches a wide spectrum of understanding.  At first glance, St&eacute;phane coming to grips with his father's death and one of the reasons why he moves from Mexico to France to live with his mother and to earn a living working at a small printing shop.  But in the interim, he encounters his neighbor Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a woman who enjoys making things from discarded items where he develops a subtle liking to her, and his dreams begin to take into affect all of these activities and all of the events that have happened in his life and dreams; while in his dream stage, he appears to be a show host in control and observant of what is taking place.  Themes of immortality, relationships, and the time contiuum play a very important role into his interpretations.  St&eacute;phane attempts to want to be in control of his destiny from a child-like and wide-eyed perspective with the quirky gadgets that he creates that he believes can move time forward or backward whenever he chooses.  However, that control is always hindered by the true fact of reality and that he himself without these special inventions can only decide where he would like his life to lead, in the past or in the present.The Science of Sleep does indeed takes viewers into the science of the mind from a extremely creative and artistic point of view that may not be understood by viewers who prefer a simple storyline.

I was hoping to indulge in some fantastic music scores and on that note I got very disappointed becuase music was so minimal, it was next to nothing.This is one of those experimental movies that require a lot of patience and endurance on the behalf of its audiences. It is a trippy story with dreamlike qualities where one never knows what is reality and what is imagination.  I found film ending to be cute, a pretty girl riding on a horse holding onto her beloved.  In that respect, this is a fairy tale - but it is an aquired taste.Also it is unfair that such a beautiful artist like Charlotte is treated so carelessly in this film.  Her hair looks like it has never seen a comb and her attire is almost the same with exception of a couple of scenes.  I am hoping to see her on a big screen again because she can act and she deserves a role that can relinquish her full potential, no matter if her acting is done in French or English language.

Yet somehow, we see them as the vulnerable people they really are, and their distance is much better than so many phony love story films about air-headed narcissists getting together.

If you fall under its spell you are probably still in touch with that innocence you once had.  I loved the elementary-school sets - full of egg-crates and paper tubes.  I hope most viewers agree that the world has a big star in Gael Garcia Bernal - barely 30 and a major talent.  He seems to more easily slip into this not-quite-mature role than his other heavier ones - giving me the impression that this character is closer to the real Bernal.

An homage to the dreamer in everyone, it is cute without being saccharine, over the top yet intimate. Set in Paris and told in three languages, principally English, the movie has an intriguing international punch.Mexican actor Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, known for his roles in ""Babel"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" is insecure and conflicted as Stephane. A young man returning home to Paris after his mother Christine, played by French actress Miou-Miou, exaggerates the prospects of an illustrating job, he is crushed at how little creativity it allows.Stephane frequently wanders off in his thoughts, but he has no mere daydreams. He often confuses fantasy with reality, disappearing often into ""Stephane TV"" where he puts together the ingredients that will comprise his dreams. A squirt of random thought, a little touch of reminisces of the day, a mix of old memories, and records he recently listened to are just some of the ingredients added to the pot.Not keen to head right back to Mexico, he tries to make the most of his present situation, but his innermost desires manifest themselves in his dreams, revealing a creative soul that's restless yet stunted.One morning a drill goes through the wall of his apartment, announcing the arrival of his new neighbor, Stephanie, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, whose piano he nearly destroys. When he sees a fellow creative spirit in her, he falls helplessly in love, but is too self-conscious and socially inept to properly win her heart. The dreams thus provide a soothing respite, but they also create their share of trouble.His well-meaning, oversexed co-worker Guy, played with suave nonchalance by Alain Chabat, tries to help Stephane overcome his anxieties and play the game of love, but it is easier said than done. He is older and more sophisticated, but this does not necessarily equal maturity.What drives the film is how Bernal and Gainsbourg treat the interactions between their characters. Stephanie may not make things easy for Stephane, but she is hardly cold or cruel, just less naive and idealistic than her starry-eyed admirer. That this difference makes them fine complements for each other is for the viewer to decide.The special effects in the dream sequences are not as impressive as they are simply eye-popping. Stephane's hands grow thirty times larger, Paris becomes more suited for swimming than for walking, and he becomes the respected artist he wishes he could be. In fact, his colleagues become so loyal they turn a note he wrote to Stephanie into a novel to impress her. ""I'm Just Your Neighbor and a Liar. By the Way, Do You Have Zoe's Number?"" becomes a blockbuster.""The Science of Sleep"" is not for everyone, but those who enjoy quirky, offbeat comedy/dramas will enjoy it immensely.

1043662,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000M4RG7E,Samuel McKewon,"[5, 8]","A playful, bittersweet diversion into the mind of a child grown old, ""The Science of Sleep"" is all about dreams, specifically about the way a man dreams in a messy pastiche of goofiness, fear, sex and egocentrism. It's too precocious for its own good, yet writer-director Michel Gondry is at least illuminating the soul, rather than insistently banging the elemental, involuntary, animal instincts in us.In a season of hopeless films about fallen, wrecked worlds, it is a ray of...something. Enough for me.Gondry's fiendishly gifted for his homemade, childlike animation and sets. He's also known for his music videos - especially those starring Bjork - and his directing work on ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"" that Charlie Kaufman-penned head trip that clearly serves as inspiration here.Boy again meets girl. Boy makes an idol out of girl. Girl is a just a girl, and a fairly wonderful one at that, but still a girl, and simply not capable of being the thousand points of light the boy needs her to be. Boy beats himself up and tortures the girl a little too, for the fact that she's just a girl, and not aforementioned points of light. Cue romantic dissonance.Here the boy is Stephane (Gael Garcia Bernal) an artist who returns to his native Paris for what he thinks is a job creating calendars of tragic disasters. The explosion of a plane, for example. He calls it ""Disasterology."" Truth is, his new job is as a type-setter. His mother lured him back to Paris with the promise of artistic freedom; the real job is skullduggery.The girl is Stephanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), kinda an artist, but mostly a girl, quirky, vaguely sexy and guileless. She wears the same pair of jeans for a week, chain-smokes (but doesn't seem particularly committed to it) and has to wear glasses when she cries. She's cute something awful, a disheveled movie cute that most American movies insist on ""making over"" in the dramatic ballroom scene. Not here, thank God.The misunderstandings, random glances and bubbling chemistry are pretty standard rom-com material; the twist is Stephane's dreams, all-night affairs that sometimes invade his waking hours, and occasionally make him sleepwalk.These dreams comprise a full half of ""The Science of Sleep,"" and many of them feature a sub-cable access show called ""Stephane TV"" where Bernal cooks potions, talks to Stephanie, beats his co-workers with giant hands, floats around, plays drums in a rabbit costume, you name it. They're hypersexual and funny until they bleed into real life, upon which the dreams turn just a bit confusing.That could be said for all of that third act, which compresses a lot of events and emotions into it that, just a scene before, has just begun percolating. It's like Stephane's life slips into warp gear, and the plot requires character arcs that seem rushed, almost senseless. Maybe Gondry figured, after an hour of literally dithering, the movie had to accomplish something more than the mildly-profane confection it is.No matter. The film is a sprite, a lark, a whim. It's pretty smiley despite it's low-grade angst and it'll remind you a little of childhood.

It's true-to-life in a strange kind of way because we all have weird dreams. The writing, directing, acting, etc. were all great. I will purchase this for my video library. I found it inspirational.

I loved the style of animation used to portray his dreams and whimsical personality.  However the film does less well developing the relationship between Stephan and Stephanie which is the heart of the story.  Although their ""inner children"" are kindred souls neither one seems to have the maturity to sustain a relationship.  Stephan is so needy he virtually throws himself at Stephanie.  The movie helps us understand him by alluding to the death of Stephan's father and alienation from his mother.  On the other hand we don't learn much about Stephanie.  Is she ambivalent because she's been hurt in the past?  Is she wary of Stephan's neediness, or should we take her statement that she simply ""doesn't want a boyfriend"" at face value?  We don't know what makes her tick, and she seems quite passive and reactive.I count myself among the many who hope for a happy ending when they see a romantic comedy.  If I can't have a happy ending I at least want a clear ending, but I got neither.  The confusion and uncertainty that plagued these characters all through the film remains unresolved.  It appears that even the film makers could not make a commitment to these characters.

Freeman ""Zach""","[11, 15]","I have to preface my review by saying that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind continues to be one of my favorite movies ever, so I may be a bit biased in reviewing Gondry's newest film.After watching The Science of Sleep in a sold-out theatre (the only theatre in town showing it), I have to say I'm ready to see it again. Much like Eternal Sunshine, this movie provides a very intimate, realistic portrait of a relationship. Instead of showing it in a straight-forward way, however, this film moves in and out of Stephane's (Gael Garcia Bernal's) dreams and the real world. We discover that Stephane has always had a problem with confusing his dreams and reality.This leaves the audience with the same problem. Sometimes you can't tell what's really happening and what is happening only in Stephane's dreams. Instead of hindering the plot, though, this only deepens the intensity of what you're seeing. It also demands to be watched over and over again. Like Eternal Sunshine, the plot is so finely crafted, that multiple views will give you more insight into what is happening and clear up scenes that were questionable before.Gael Garcia Bernal gives an amazing performance (in 3 languages) as a child-like man who spends most of his time living through his dreams instead of in reality. The rest of the cast is brilliant as well, and it's a cool experience to see characters switch from English to French in the middle of a scene.The stop-motion animation is great and really helps develop the other-worldly quality of Stephane's dream sequences. The dreams are linear enough to move the plot, but still disconnected enough to feel like realistic dreams.This film represents what movies are supposed to do: move and surprise us. You never know what's going to happen next in this film, and it's such a relief to witness something so original unfolding on screen.The only drawback is that this movie will probably not be released to wider audiences. Because of this, many people will miss out on a great movie experience.",5,This is what a movie is supposed to be,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,2027,"['have', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'biased', 'reviewing', 'Gondry', 'newest', 'film.After', 'watching', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'sold-out', 'theatre', 'only', 'theatre', 'town', 'showing', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'ready', 'see', 'again', 'Much', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'movie', 'very', 'intimate', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'relationship', 'Instead', 'showing', 'straight-forward', 'way', 'however', 'film', 'Stephane', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'dreams', 'real', 'world', 'discover', 'Stephane', 'always', 'had', 'problem', 'confusing', 'dreams', 'reality.This', 'audience', 'same', 'problem', 'Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'what', 'happening', 'only', 'Stephane', 'dreams', 'Instead', 'hindering', 'plot', 'though', 'only', 'intensity', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'also', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'plot', 'so', 'finely', 'crafted', 'multiple', 'views', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'insight', 'what', 'happening', 'clear', 'up', 'scenes', 'were', 'questionable', 'before.Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'amazing', 'performance', '3', 'languages', 'child-like', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'living', 'dreams', 'instead', 'reality', 'rest', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'well', 'cool', 'experience', 'see', 'characters', 'switch', 'English', 'French', 'middle', 'scene.The', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'great', 'really', 'develop', 'other-worldly', 'quality', 'Stephane', 'dream', 'sequences', 'dreams', 'are', 'linear', 'enough', 'move', 'plot', 'still', 'disconnected', 'enough', 'feel', 'realistic', 'dreams.This', 'film', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'move', 'surprise', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'film', 'such', 'relief', 'witness', 'something', 'so', 'original', 'unfolding', 'screen.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'wider', 'audiences', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'great', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A
