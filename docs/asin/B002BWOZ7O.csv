The Buntings have a new lodger, and he before long, the Buntings begin to grow suspicious of the man. Their daughter...their young, blonde daughter...has grown increasingly attached to the man. Something must be done!This movie is actually a very early Alfred Hitchcock movie - the second earliest one surviving. It was made in 1927, but even though the great director was only just starting out, the movie shows all of the traits of the master's brilliance. It's really a great movie, and the black-and-white film and silent format simply add to the spookiness and otherworldly feeling of it.

Laird Cregar was a great choicefor the part of jack the ripper. Not a slasher movie but for theday was very shocking material.

Not long afterward he was dead of complications induced by his efforts to lose a large part of his 300 pound weight. Sad. At 31, he had already established himself as one of Hollywood's leading character actors with roles in a variety of films but most successfully in such classics as ""This Gun for Hire"" (which also catapulted Alan Ladd to stardom), I Wake Up Screaming and Hangover Square.That one can find this prime example of his work so appealing almost seven decades later, is a tribute to its screenwriters, Director, Merle Oberon and George Sanders, his co-stars, but primarily to Mr.Cregar who underplays The Lodger, to excellent effect. Nothing is dated, the Victorian Era settings are sufficiently authentic seeming as to still be acceptable and, while the horror of death and mutilation is there, it does not overwhelm the players.I would commend this film to anyone with a taste for insidious killer movies, held within constrained limits by the commendable desire to avoid cheap thrills.",5,Laird Cregar Stars in a Fine Version of  the Book,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,1135,"['War', 'WW2', 'saw', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'stage', 'show', 'NYC', '20th', 'Century', 'Movie', 'Palace', 'Roxy', 'was', 'charming', 'amusing', 'Not', 'long', 'afterward', 'was', 'dead', 'complications', 'induced', 'efforts', 'lose', 'large', 'part', '300', 'pound', 'weight', 'Sad', '31', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'character', 'actors', 'roles', 'variety', 'films', 'most', 'successfully', 'such', 'classics', 'Gun', 'Hire', 'also', 'catapulted', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'stardom', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Screaming', 'Hangover', 'Square.That', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'prime', 'example', 'work', 'so', 'appealing', 'almost', 'seven', 'decades', 'later', 'tribute', 'screenwriters', 'Director', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'George', 'Sanders', 'co-stars', 'primarily', 'Mr.Cregar', 'who', 'Lodger', 'excellent', 'effect', 'Nothing', 'dated', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'settings', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'authentic', 'seeming', 'still', 'be', 'acceptable', 'horror', 'death', 'mutilation', 'there', 'not', 'overwhelm', 'players.I', 'would', 'commend', 'film', 'anyone', 'taste', 'insidious', 'killer', 'movies', 'held', 'constrained', 'limits', 'commendable', 'desire', 'avoid', 'cheap', 'thrills']",N/A

With this movie,which concerns a tenant and an an unsolved murder,  he found something he was really good at and he would spend most of the next 50 years making this type of movie. The level of suspense is high and Hitchcock fans should enjoy this quite well with one caveat.Silent movies are an acquired taste to the modern viewer.

1260380,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B002BWOZ7O,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Although the story of Jack the Ripper has been told many times onscreen, no movie has portrayed the killer more vividly than the 1944 version of &#34;The Lodger.&#34; Thanks to the talents of star Laird Cregar and director John Brahm, &#34;The Lodger&#34; is a brilliantly photographed, solidly acted thriller with a chilling lead performance by Cregar.While the Ripper murders are terrorizing London, a mysterious stranger named Slade (Cregar) rents a room from a middle class couple (Cedric Hardwicke and  Sara Allgood) that's down on its luck financially. Thanks to Slade's late hours and generally creepy behavior, it becomes clear to viewers, although not the family, that he's the Ripper. Despite this, the couple's niece, Kitty (Merle Oberon), a dance hall performer, befriends Slade, who, in turn, has a soft spot for her. The question eventually becomes whether police inspector George Sanders, who's sweet on Kitty himself, can get the goods on Slade before he turns on Kitty.As with many of the horror films of that era, &#34;The Lodger&#34; isn't really scary (and it's certainly not gory as a modern film would be), but it does build suspense, and it's always fascinating to watch due to Cregar's performance and the many amazing black & white compositions that director Brahm assembles. The camera work and use of light and shadow produces one memorable shot after another. In the meantime, Cregar dominates the screen, at first a seemingly mild man with a fear an distrust of women, especially actresses, but gradually becoming more and more unhinged. Cregar almost always played screen villains, but this was by far his most memorable performance.The DVD boasts some solid extras as well, including a documentary featurette on the making of the movie, an audio commentary by a couple of film historians who are fans of the movie, and a radio version of &#34;The Lodger&#34; with Vincent Price in Cregar's role.Although a number of horror films of that era are extremely dated, &#34;The Lodger&#34; holds up quite well today as an example of mounting suspense and menace, held together by terrific cinematography by Lucien Ballard and a thoroughly engrossing lead performance. &#34;The Lodger&#34; is a must for fans of the classic horror films.",4,A Rippingly Creepy Movie,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2260,"['story', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'onscreen', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'killer', 'more', 'vividly', '1944', 'version', '34', 'Lodger.', '34', 'Thanks', 'talents', 'star', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'director', 'John', 'Brahm', '34', 'Lodger', '34', 'brilliantly', 'photographed', 'solidly', 'acted', 'thriller', 'chilling', 'lead', 'performance', 'Cregar.While', 'Ripper', 'murders', 'are', 'terrorizing', 'London', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'named', 'Slade', 'Cregar', 'room', 'middle', 'class', 'couple', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'Sara', 'Allgood', 'down', 'luck', 'financially', 'Thanks', 'Slade', 'late', 'hours', 'generally', 'creepy', 'behavior', 'clear', 'viewers', 'not', 'family', 'Ripper', 'couple', 'niece', 'Kitty', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'dance', 'hall', 'performer', 'Slade', 'who', 'turn', 'soft', 'spot', 'question', 'eventually', 'police', 'inspector', 'George', 'Sanders', 'who', 'sweet', 'Kitty', 'can', 'get', 'goods', 'Slade', 'Kitty.As', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'era', '34', 'Lodger', '34', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'certainly', 'not', 'gory', 'modern', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'build', 'suspense', 'always', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'due', 'Cregar', 'performance', 'many', 'amazing', 'black', 'white', 'compositions', 'director', 'Brahm', 'camera', 'work', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'one', 'memorable', 'shot', 'meantime', 'Cregar', 'screen', 'first', 'seemingly', 'mild', 'man', 'fear', 'distrust', 'women', 'especially', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'unhinged', 'Cregar', 'almost', 'always', 'played', 'screen', 'villains', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance.The', 'DVD', 'solid', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'audio', 'commentary', 'couple', 'film', 'historians', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'movie', 'radio', 'version', '34', 'Lodger', '34', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Cregar', 'role.Although', 'number', 'horror', 'films', 'era', 'are', 'extremely', 'dated', '34', 'Lodger', '34', 'quite', 'well', 'today', 'example', 'mounting', 'suspense', 'menace', 'held', 'together', 'terrific', 'cinematography', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'lead', 'performance', '34', 'Lodger', '34', 'must', 'fans', 'classic', 'horror', 'films']",N/A

I guess you just had to be there then.The primitive nature of this public-domain copy seem to underline the primitive nature of this production.  And this was in 1926, during the ""golden age"" of silent films!I finally gave up trying to figure what the heck was going on and resorted to published descriptions about and synopses of the film.  Far from a good sign.To say that THE LODGER has not held up over time is really in error.  Compared to other silent films of the late 1920's, it never got off the dime.  The badly needed expository inter-titles (supposedly Hitchcock's forte) are few and far between; the editing is jump city making the film near impossible to follow much less comprehend; and the continuity is pretty much among the missing.All in all this movie looks like an ancient failed art-house experiment rather than a mainline entry.
