1140399,A15IBKVA8KGTUF,B0013A0FBK,Alicia Czechowski,"[15, 18]","""Happy Face Yoga"" is a good program for toning and reshaping the face. Some of the exercises are rather weird; tricky to do and hold, but they will work multiple muscles simultaneously, so it can be an efficient way of achieving significant results in a short time. I think some people will have difficulty ever doing certain exercises, like ""The Jowl Eraser"" which is a little like patting your head and rubbing your stomach while doing sit-ups.One of the women on the DVD is really bad at doing the exercises. Maybe she is comic relief, especially when she can't stop looking off screen and waving with her fingers to someone. Read: amateurish.Worst of all is the way Mr. Sikorski mangles the pronunciation of some of the muscles. I want to scream each time he says ""mylohyoid"". ""Platysma"" is almost as bad. Hey, Gary, buy a dictionary and learn their pronunciation. It's easy, easier that doing theses exercises!Nevertheless, this face exercise program is far better than the insipid and incompetent productions of Carole Maggio, of ""Facercise"" fame.However, ""Miss Craig's Face-Saving Exercises"" is still the unrivaled bible of face exercise; comprehensive, intelligent (and humorous!) and effective. But, for a tough facial workout you will really feel, ""Happy Face Yoga"" does the job.In spite of the drawbacks, most people who diligently practice the exercises on this DVD will probably notice an improvement within a month.A revised version of this DVD is in order, with a menu that goes straight to the workout with the option of not having each exercise explained every time. And, of course, let's hear the muscle names correctly pronounced. We can probably do without the silly lady, too.",5,"A diamond in the rough.But, please, Mr. Sikorski pronouce the muscle names correctly",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,1697,"['Happy', 'Face', 'Yoga', 'good', 'program', 'toning', 'reshaping', 'face', 'exercises', 'are', 'rather', 'weird', 'tricky', 'do', 'hold', 'will', 'work', 'multiple', 'muscles', 'simultaneously', 'can', 'be', 'efficient', 'way', 'achieving', 'significant', 'results', 'short', 'time', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'difficulty', 'ever', 'doing', 'certain', 'exercises', 'Jowl', 'Eraser', 'little', 'patting', 'head', 'rubbing', 'stomach', 'doing', 'sit-ups.One', 'women', 'DVD', 'really', 'bad', 'doing', 'exercises', 'Maybe', 'comic', 'relief', 'especially', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'looking', 'off', 'screen', 'waving', 'fingers', 'someone', 'Read', 'amateurish.Worst', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Sikorski', 'pronunciation', 'muscles', 'want', 'scream', 'time', 'mylohyoid', 'Platysma', 'almost', 'bad', 'Hey', 'Gary', 'buy', 'dictionary', 'learn', 'pronunciation', 'easy', 'easier', 'doing', 'theses', 'Nevertheless', 'face', 'exercise', 'program', 'far', 'better', 'insipid', 'incompetent', 'productions', 'Carole', 'Maggio', 'Facercise', 'fame.However', 'Miss', 'Craig', 'Face-Saving', 'Exercises', 'still', 'unrivaled', 'bible', 'face', 'exercise', 'comprehensive', 'intelligent', 'humorous', 'effective', 'tough', 'facial', 'workout', 'will', 'really', 'feel', 'Happy', 'Face', 'Yoga', 'job.In', 'spite', 'drawbacks', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'diligently', 'practice', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'notice', 'improvement', 'month.A', 'revised', 'version', 'DVD', 'order', 'menu', 'straight', 'workout', 'option', 'not', 'having', 'exercise', 'explained', 'time', 'course', 'let', 'hear', 'muscle', 'names', 'correctly', 'pronounced', 'can', 'probably', 'do', 'silly', 'lady', 'too']",Happy Face Yoga

The title is why I didn't...It sounded too spacey and new age for me. These exercises are serious. I feel every muscle in my face after these. He combines facial isometrics with resistance. The exercises are difficult to learn, so bought the training cards off his website, cost more but really helped me learn them. I have seen results with other programs, my favorites are Flex Effect and Facial Magic, but nothing seemed to help my genetic puffy bags. This seems to be working. Also the neck and double chin exercises are great. I would compare this to a barre workout for your face. (Getting into the right position before doing the exercise.) One word of advice- if I overwork my face it looks worse so I take a day or two off, like I would if I were doing muscle conditioning for my body. I do the exercises 3-4 days a week. I also do them at night as it makes my face very red. (blood getting to the face.) After two months of doing this program the skin on my face feels much firmer when I touch. Also he uses a lot of smiling, and smiling makes a person feel happy.",5,my favorite face program,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1193,"['have', 'tried', 'many', 'exercise', 'program', 'exercises', 'not', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'sooner', 'title', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'sounded', 'too', 'spacey', 'new', 'age', 'exercises', 'are', 'serious', 'feel', 'muscle', 'face', 'facial', 'isometrics', 'resistance', 'exercises', 'are', 'difficult', 'learn', 'so', 'bought', 'training', 'cards', 'website', 'cost', 'more', 'really', 'helped', 'learn', 'have', 'seen', 'results', 'other', 'programs', 'favorites', 'are', 'Flex', 'Effect', 'Facial', 'Magic', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'help', 'genetic', 'puffy', 'bags', 'be', 'working', 'Also', 'neck', 'double', 'chin', 'exercises', 'are', 'great', 'would', 'compare', 'barre', 'workout', 'face', 'Getting', 'right', 'position', 'doing', 'exercise', 'One', 'word', 'advice-', 'overwork', 'face', 'worse', 'so', 'take', 'day', 'two', 'would', 'were', 'doing', 'muscle', 'conditioning', 'body', 'do', 'exercises', '3-4', 'days', 'week', 'also', 'do', 'night', 'face', 'very', 'red', 'blood', 'getting', 'face', 'two', 'months', 'doing', 'program', 'skin', 'face', 'feels', 'much', 'firmer', 'when', 'touch', 'Also', 'lot', 'smiling', 'smiling', 'person', 'feel', 'happy']",Happy Face Yoga

I was skeptical how much could be expected from any kind of facial toning exercises, but Gary has made me a believer. For a small commitment of time, you can expect to see significant results and rather quickly too, based on my own experience. Gary does a great job explaining each exercise on the DVD and they are easy to learn and do.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Read my full review including before and after photos (how brave is that!) at myreallifereviews dot com",5,It Really Works!,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,581,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'exercises', 'Happy', 'Face', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'almost', '3', 'months', 'now', '6', 'day', 'week', 'basis', 'really', 'work', 'was', 'skeptical', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'kind', 'facial', 'toning', 'exercises', 'Gary', 'made', 'believer', 'small', 'commitment', 'time', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'significant', 'results', 'rather', 'quickly', 'too', 'based', 'own', 'experience', 'Gary', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'are', 'easy', 'learn', 'do.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'Read', 'full', 'review', 'including', 'photos', 'how', 'brave', 'myreallifereviews', 'dot', 'com']",Happy Face Yoga
