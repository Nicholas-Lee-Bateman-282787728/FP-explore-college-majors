The acting is great from Washington and Derek Luke but the way the movie is portrayed is unsettling and emotionally draining. The story of Antwone Fisher is heartbreaking but I just feel this film is one-sided.

604923,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005JLRZ,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 6]","""Antwone Fisher"" is a brilliant movie that melds into a pretty OK movie.  It tells the story of a young sailor whose ""anger management"" problems are so severe they make a cannon look like a firecracker.Sensing great potential and even superiority beneath Antwone's self-destructive acting out, Navy base psychiatrist (Denzel Washington) goes that extra mile, and goads and teases out the fear lurking beneath Antwone's slapped-on, stoic exterior that occasionally erupts into unbelieable, unaccountable rage.During sessions, the shrink discovers what Antwone has to find for himself:  his built-in anger resulted in an unwitting flawed personality as a result of early childhood abuse.  Antwone is a very tough case, but such a special case that Washington's character will step  up to the edge--maybe over--Navy rules and regs about his professional level of commitment.  Denzel wants to see a healing heart and soul.  The Navy wants an obedient grunt who won't cause trouble.  Antwone doesn't think it's that big a deal.Washington as always is superb and versatile.  Notice how in ""Training Day"" he could act with full body, voice and torso?  In this film, watch the wattage he can throw with a sneer, a raised eyebrow, a crooked smile.  He's throwing his patient all kinds of psychiatric spitballs that we can figure out in extreme closeup; but his desired goal his reached--to irritate Antwone without giving him reason to feel truly provoked.  (Is there any genre of film this man CANNOT do?  Should he move into comedy next and be a uni-talent like Spencer Tracy?)All the cast is good, no rotten apples or mediocrities.  My chief objection to this film -- not a small one -- is that what critics call Act Three is too slick, easy and middle-class; it seems to have been gleaned, adapted and edited from the Kenmorish teleplays of the 1980s or 1990s.  In my opinion this is disrespectful to Antwone and his family in several ways:  It glosses over the difficulty of his search for his biological family (one brief scene shows him and his girlfriend frienzedly tearing through out-of-town phone directories, a token gesture); it didn't have the time to explore any kind of relationship with Antwone's new relatives; and it didn't follow through on Antwone's psychological state.  Under a psychiatrist the poor abused young man had gone from confrontation to conversion, but that isn't enough:  he had to go from conversion to care.  Naturally, the best way to do that is to understand which, if not all, of your past isn't your fault, but someone with a rough history still has to work at it.  This story has a true happy ending, but when the audience isn't allowed to share fully all of it, we feel cheated.Act Two held the climaxes.  What critics usually call Act Three, in which Antwone begins the legwork, is well-meaning but condensed and flat.  There's no one  to point the finger to, really, except for loose plotting and everyone's whipping boy, TV, where we've been Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame'd for 40 years during which light sentimental stories are passed off as ""drama.""  So unfortunately,  ""Antwone Fisher's"" last act more or less shifts genres:  way from the roughness and the surprise, the ugliness and the revelation, the horror and the hope.  For the reasons above and perhaps to fit a movie theater's turnaround schedule (?), it didn't do justice to Twone's saga, nor his family, the structure of the last part didn't hold up, and I felt let down at the end.Nonetheless the virtues of this film far outweigh any defect one might find.  I heartily recommend ""Antwone Fisher"" in any medium.  My preference is for Widescreen because the film was shot to fit that kind of frame.",4,"Terrific overall, but not without slack",1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,3691,"['Antwone', 'Fisher', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'pretty', 'OK', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'sailor', 'anger', 'management', 'problems', 'are', 'so', 'severe', 'make', 'cannon', 'look', 'firecracker.Sensing', 'great', 'potential', 'even', 'superiority', 'Antwone', 'self-destructive', 'acting', 'out', 'Navy', 'base', 'psychiatrist', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'extra', 'mile', 'goads', 'out', 'fear', 'lurking', 'Antwone', 'slapped-on', 'stoic', 'exterior', 'occasionally', 'unbelieable', 'unaccountable', 'rage.During', 'sessions', 'shrink', 'what', 'Antwone', 'find', 'built-in', 'anger', 'resulted', 'unwitting', 'flawed', 'personality', 'result', 'early', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'Antwone', 'very', 'tough', 'case', 'special', 'case', 'Washington', 'character', 'will', 'step', 'up', 'edge', 'maybe', 'Navy', 'rules', 'regs', 'professional', 'level', 'commitment', 'Denzel', 'see', 'healing', 'heart', 'soul', 'Navy', 'obedient', 'grunt', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cause', 'trouble', 'Antwone', ""n't"", 'think', 'big', 'deal.Washington', 'always', 'superb', 'versatile', 'Notice', 'how', 'Training', 'Day', 'could', 'act', 'full', 'body', 'voice', 'torso', 'film', 'watch', 'wattage', 'can', 'throw', 'sneer', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'crooked', 'smile', 'throwing', 'patient', 'kinds', 'psychiatric', 'spitballs', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'extreme', 'closeup', 'desired', 'goal', 'reached', 'irritate', 'Antwone', 'giving', 'reason', 'feel', 'truly', 'provoked', 'there', 'genre', 'film', 'man', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'do', 'Should', 'move', 'comedy', 'next', 'be', 'uni-talent', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'cast', 'good', 'rotten', 'apples', 'mediocrities', 'chief', 'objection', 'film', 'not', 'small', 'one', 'what', 'critics', 'call', 'Act', 'Three', 'too', 'slick', 'easy', 'middle-class', 'have', 'been', 'gleaned', 'adapted', 'edited', 'Kenmorish', 'teleplays', '1980s', '1990s', 'opinion', 'disrespectful', 'Antwone', 'family', 'several', 'ways', 'difficulty', 'search', 'biological', 'family', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'girlfriend', 'frienzedly', 'tearing', 'out-of-town', 'phone', 'directories', 'token', 'gesture', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'explore', 'kind', 'relationship', 'Antwone', 'new', 'relatives', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Antwone', 'psychological', 'state', 'psychiatrist', 'poor', 'abused', 'young', 'man', 'had', 'gone', 'confrontation', 'conversion', ""n't"", 'enough', 'had', 'go', 'conversion', 'care', 'Naturally', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'understand', 'not', 'past', ""n't"", 'fault', 'someone', 'rough', 'history', 'still', 'work', 'story', 'true', 'happy', 'ending', 'when', 'audience', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'share', 'fully', 'feel', 'cheated.Act', 'Two', 'held', 'climaxes', 'What', 'critics', 'usually', 'call', 'Act', 'Three', 'Antwone', 'legwork', 'well-meaning', 'condensed', 'flat', 'one', 'point', 'finger', 'really', 'loose', 'plotting', 'everyone', 'whipping', 'boy', 'TV', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame', ""'d"", '40', 'years', 'light', 'sentimental', 'stories', 'are', 'passed', 'off', 'drama', 'So', 'unfortunately', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'last', 'act', 'more', 'less', 'shifts', 'genres', 'way', 'roughness', 'surprise', 'ugliness', 'revelation', 'horror', 'hope', 'reasons', 'perhaps', 'fit', 'movie', 'theater', 'turnaround', 'schedule', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Twone', 'saga', 'family', 'structure', 'last', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'end.Nonetheless', 'virtues', 'film', 'far', 'outweigh', 'defect', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'medium', 'preference', 'Widescreen', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'fit', 'kind', 'frame']",N/A

604925,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLRZ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Derek Luke is so brilliant in his breakout role as troubled Navy-man Antwone Fisher that I'm stunned, utterly stunned at his Oscar omission.  Then again, it was a strong year for leading actors and the veterans really clogged up the race, but still, you can't watch this film without embracing his screen presence and acting bravado.  He embellishes every scene with the right amount of truth, sincerity and emotion and commands his scenes, stealing thunder from co-star and first time director Denzel Washington who is known for his ability to steal scenes as it were.  Here though, Denzel his own acted by his young co-star and that, my friends, is a blessing to watch.Written by the real life Antwone Fisher, this biopic tells the struggles Antwone had within the Navy.  A man prone to violence and anger he's finally sent to see Jerome Davenport, a Navy psychologist played by Washington.  At first Antwone is reluctant to entertain the idea of seeing a shrink but he soon begins to warm to the idea, and its here that his character starts to unravel and his life begins to make sense.  The therapy sessions are done tastefully and prove engaging and informative.  As some have mentioned, they do come across Hollywoodized if you so chose to label, but they are still heartwarming and sincere.The power this movie has is as strong as its title character, and as Luke manages to unravel his character before our very eyes we are brought into his life and into his very plight.  As past abuse comes to the surface, physical, mental and sexual, we begin to understand his bursts of anger, his flurries of discontent and his utter lack of trust.  The events surrounding his childhood, from abandonment to betrayal, as well as those surrounding his early adulthood, like the death of a close friend, all help mold the man sitting before Davenport, but with a sound mind and patience he is able to help Fisher become a stronger and overall better man for it.Washington makes a great first impression in the director's seat, delicately handling the material, and while some scenes may be hard to witness and the events themselves are enough to bring forth tears, Washington elegantly maneuvers our thoughts to the positive amidst the negative.  Our tear ducts will be set on overdrive, but they will be happy tears cried for the boy who finally becomes the man and is welcomed back home, to the real home he's only seen in his dreams.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that I prefer Washington behind the camera as apposed to in front of it, but then again he's always been give or take for me.Alongside Washington there is another supporting performance that shines, and that is of young Joy Bryant who plays Antwone's love interest.  Now while her role in the film is not the longest she has one of the most powerful, that of the supportive woman who truly teaches Antwone how to love again, how to trust and how to put others before himself.  It's another great breakthrough performance that only adds more reasons to see this film.Fisher's life was hard to get through but in the end he found something that all of us are looking for, contentment and loyalty not with others but with himself.  He made such emotional growth in his lifetime and while he was only stunted by the ones closest to him, he was able to rise above the pain and the suffering to reveal the real person of the heart, the man that he always knew he needed to be.  Thanks in large part to Derek Luke's commanding performance Antwone Fisher becomes more than just a character but he becomes a real person to the audience, a friend, a relative, a loved one and so when we watch him finally embrace his dreams our cheeks are red and soar and wet with this tears of admiration.",5,A deeply moving experience that captivates as well as tames the heart...,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,3741,"['Derek', 'Luke', 'so', 'brilliant', 'breakout', 'role', 'troubled', 'Navy-man', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'utterly', 'stunned', 'Oscar', 'omission', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'strong', 'year', 'leading', 'actors', 'veterans', 'really', 'clogged', 'up', 'race', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'embracing', 'screen', 'presence', 'acting', 'bravado', 'scene', 'right', 'amount', 'truth', 'sincerity', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'stealing', 'thunder', 'co-star', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'known', 'ability', 'steal', 'scenes', 'were', 'Here', 'Denzel', 'own', 'acted', 'young', 'co-star', 'friends', 'blessing', 'watch.Written', 'real', 'life', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'biopic', 'struggles', 'Antwone', 'had', 'Navy', 'man', 'prone', 'violence', 'anger', 'finally', 'sent', 'see', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'Navy', 'psychologist', 'played', 'Washington', 'first', 'Antwone', 'reluctant', 'entertain', 'idea', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'soon', 'warm', 'idea', 'here', 'character', 'unravel', 'life', 'make', 'sense', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'are', 'done', 'tastefully', 'prove', 'engaging', 'informative', 'have', 'mentioned', 'do', 'come', 'Hollywoodized', 'so', 'chose', 'label', 'are', 'still', 'heartwarming', 'sincere.The', 'power', 'movie', 'as', 'strong', 'title', 'character', 'Luke', 'unravel', 'character', 'very', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'very', 'plight', 'past', 'abuse', 'surface', 'physical', 'mental', 'sexual', 'begin', 'understand', 'bursts', 'anger', 'flurries', 'discontent', 'utter', 'lack', 'trust', 'events', 'surrounding', 'childhood', 'abandonment', 'betrayal', 'as', 'well', 'surrounding', 'early', 'adulthood', 'death', 'close', 'friend', 'help', 'mold', 'man', 'sitting', 'Davenport', 'sound', 'mind', 'patience', 'able', 'help', 'Fisher', 'become', 'stronger', 'overall', 'better', 'man', 'it.Washington', 'great', 'first', 'impression', 'director', 'seat', 'delicately', 'handling', 'material', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'witness', 'events', 'are', 'enough', 'bring', 'forth', 'tears', 'Washington', 'elegantly', 'thoughts', 'positive', 'amidst', 'negative', 'tear', 'ducts', 'will', 'be', 'set', 'overdrive', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'tears', 'cried', 'boy', 'who', 'finally', 'man', 'welcomed', 'back', 'home', 'real', 'home', 'only', 'seen', 'dreams', 'fact', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'prefer', 'Washington', 'camera', 'apposed', 'front', 'then', 'again', 'always', 'been', 'give', 'take', 'me.Alongside', 'Washington', 'supporting', 'performance', 'shines', 'young', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'who', 'Antwone', 'love', 'interest', 'Now', 'role', 'film', 'not', 'longest', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'supportive', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'Antwone', 'how', 'love', 'again', 'how', 'trust', 'how', 'put', 'others', 'great', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'only', 'more', 'reasons', 'see', 'film.Fisher', 'life', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'end', 'found', 'something', 'are', 'looking', 'contentment', 'loyalty', 'not', 'others', 'made', 'such', 'emotional', 'growth', 'lifetime', 'was', 'only', 'stunted', 'ones', 'closest', 'was', 'able', 'rise', 'pain', 'suffering', 'reveal', 'real', 'person', 'heart', 'man', 'always', 'knew', 'needed', 'be', 'Thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'more', 'just', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'audience', 'friend', 'relative', 'loved', 'one', 'so', 'when', 'watch', 'finally', 'embrace', 'dreams', 'cheeks', 'are', 'red', 'soar', 'wet', 'tears', 'admiration']",N/A
604926,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00005JLRZ,Artist & Author,"[4, 4]","As I write this, I have watched about 1200 movies for a book on movies related to kids.  This film is one of my top two or three rated movie.  My grandfather was a ""slumlord;"" my father was as well.  When I went to visit their apartment complexes, every once in a while I'd observe a child that I noticed was what I called a ""superkid.""  Somehow, living in deplorable, filthy conditions their families created, constantly threatened with crime, prostitution, and drugs, those superkids would rise above their circumstances to go to school and even college, move out to the suburbs, and join the middle class.  Antwone Fisher is one such superkid, and everyone should see his story.This is the most masterful job I've seen of a movie depicting overcoming terrible circumstances, the search for family, and finally finding genuine love.  Unlike most ""overcoming"" movies, where the hero goes from disadvantaged to success in 90 minutes of ""formula movie,"" this movie shows the terrible pain, not only of abused childhood, but of facing the abuse, disappointment, dispair, and anger.  One really feels Antwone's pain.  Many psychologist's patients develop a sort of dependency on him or her; Antwone did as well.  So, there comes a point where the counselor has to cut the ties (the ""apron strings"") and the patient has to sink or swim on their own.  It is a terrifying - yet exhilirating as well - feeling.  This was shown with great skill in this film.So, Antwone begins a new life - certified okay by a psychaitrist, but scared to death - on his own.  I don't need to tell you if he rose to the challenge or not.  All I need to say is that no matter how one views any other person, they need to be considerate of their life experiences.  You don't know what they have been through or are going through.  There is no better movie today that shows an example of this.  For families concerned with traditional values, the language is not too offensive.  Some of the physical and sexual abuse would be above younger children.  But to show this film to older kids and then discuss Antwone's situation and how it might relate to kids they know would certainly be beneficial.",5,Do you really know what that person has gone through?,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,2167,"['write', 'have', 'watched', '1200', 'movies', 'book', 'movies', 'related', 'kids', 'film', 'one', 'top', 'two', 'three', 'rated', 'movie', 'grandfather', 'was', 'slumlord', 'father', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'went', 'visit', 'apartment', 'complexes', 'once', 'while', ""'d"", 'observe', 'child', 'noticed', 'was', 'what', 'called', 'superkid', 'Somehow', 'living', 'deplorable', 'filthy', 'conditions', 'families', 'created', 'constantly', 'threatened', 'crime', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'superkids', 'would', 'rise', 'circumstances', 'go', 'school', 'even', 'college', 'move', 'out', 'suburbs', 'join', 'middle', 'class', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'one', 'such', 'superkid', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'story.This', 'most', 'masterful', 'job', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'depicting', 'overcoming', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'search', 'family', 'finally', 'finding', 'genuine', 'love', 'most', 'overcoming', 'movies', 'where', 'hero', 'disadvantaged', 'success', '90', 'minutes', 'formula', 'movie', 'movie', 'terrible', 'pain', 'not', 'only', 'abused', 'childhood', 'facing', 'abuse', 'disappointment', 'dispair', 'anger', 'One', 'really', 'Antwone', 'pain', 'Many', 'psychologist', 'patients', 'develop', 'sort', 'dependency', 'Antwone', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'point', 'where', 'counselor', 'cut', 'ties', 'apron', 'strings', 'patient', 'sink', 'swim', 'own', 'terrifying', 'yet', 'exhilirating', 'as', 'well', 'feeling', 'was', 'shown', 'great', 'skill', 'film.So', 'Antwone', 'new', 'life', 'certified', 'okay', 'psychaitrist', 'scared', 'death', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'rose', 'challenge', 'not', 'need', 'say', 'matter', 'how', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'need', 'be', 'considerate', 'life', 'experiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'going', 'better', 'movie', 'today', 'example', 'families', 'concerned', 'traditional', 'values', 'language', 'not', 'too', 'offensive', 'physical', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'would', 'be', 'younger', 'children', 'show', 'film', 'older', 'kids', 'then', 'discuss', 'Antwone', 'situation', 'how', 'might', 'relate', 'kids', 'know', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'beneficial']",N/A

Arthur Penn did The Miracle Worker. John Sturges' The Great Escape was another one. Then there was Rocky from John Avildsen through Sylvester Stallone. Later in the 80's, John Avildsen did it again with Lean on Me, and also Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot was released. In the 90's, I saw the five year journey, chronicled by Steve James, through Hoops Dreams. So far this decade, Clint Eastwood directed a masterpiece, Million Dollar Baby. To my surprise, one esteemed actor adds another to this long line of impressive films, and it is Antwone Fisher. This film, behind the powerful directorial debut from Denzel Washington, is pushed in full force by supercharged performances. Its wonderful introduction of the boy in a dream is done somewhat amateurishly. Then the film becomes polished later to the point where it is ready to go deep to the core. At that point, it starts to hit me the hardest. Finally, I am met with a very satisfactory ending. A lot of emotions comes to me from watching Antwone Fisher, and the movie is brilliantly created because Denzel Washington allows a very simple maneuvering throughout the unfolding of the story. In a way, Antwone Fisher, through Denzel Washington's integrity and values, feels exactly how I see through him: the person and the character that he is. To transfuse that energy into Antwone Fisher, it serves well to his image. Derek Luke impresses me with his performance. One scene is especially memorable for me is when Derek Luke attempts to out-Trip Denzel Washington and then Denzel Washington ultimately out-Trips him. I am referring to Denzel Washington's character Trip of Glory. That is just a pure imitation of that aggression. Moreover, the rest of the scenes in the picture are so good that I am moved. In a summary, I am inclined to say that Antwone Fisher is one of the best films I've seen in my life. To this day, I hope I will see another picture just like that from Denzel Washington. By the way, I know that Antwone Fisher is similar to Good Will Hunting, and I should think of ""rip-off.""

604930,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JLRZ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Antwone Fisher is a story about a young man serving in the Navy.  He has a short fuss, doesn't get along with his mates, and gets into trouble frequently.  Upon visiting the guidance counselor, well this is actually when the *true* part of the storyline gets underway.Through a very slow and gradual process, the young man becomes friends with the guidance counselor as he reveals his entire life story and why exactly he's so bitter and angry all the time.  Once you hear this story... wow, it's a *great* story.  Don't miss a single moment of it, in fact, because every single element makes fantastic storytelling.The young man was forced to grow up in a foster home where the caretaker mentally and physically abused the HECK out of the poor boy.  Her actions were absolutely unforgiveable, so it's no wonder the boy develops anger issues all the time.  You can't help but sympathize with his state of mind once it's revealed just how much crap he had to persevere as a child.Another, smaller element of the storyline is the boys relationship with a girl he hooks up with in between his counselor meetings and Navy training exercises. She's beautiful and very polite.  At first the young man is reluctant to be with her and is noticeably extremely shy, and the exact reason why is revealed much later.For the most part, the storyline focuses around the boys relationship with the guidance counselor and how a friendship develops with each meeting.  The boy reflecting on his past and revealing his tragic life history *is* the main aspect of the plotline.It's amazing how emotional Antwone Fisher is overall, however the reason I'm not giving it 5-stars is because it sort of wears me out after a while.  The level of emotions never ceases- it's a constant thing.  The ending is a bit predictably written and again, too emotional for my tastes.  It's a really tiny complaint, though.  I can't deny the ending is totally appropriate.Overall, I highly recommend Antwone Fisher.  It's the story of a young man who knows right from wrong and does everything in his power to change into a better person.  He obviously just needs someone to communicate with on a deep, personal level.",4,really emotional,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,2181,"['Antwone', 'Fisher', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'serving', 'Navy', 'short', 'fuss', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'mates', 'trouble', 'frequently', 'visiting', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'well', 'actually', 'when', '*true*', 'part', 'storyline', 'very', 'slow', 'gradual', 'process', 'young', 'man', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'entire', 'life', 'story', 'why', 'exactly', 'so', 'bitter', 'angry', 'time', 'Once', 'hear', 'story', 'wow', '*great*', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'single', 'moment', 'fact', 'single', 'element', 'fantastic', 'storytelling.The', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'foster', 'home', 'where', 'caretaker', 'mentally', 'physically', 'abused', 'HECK', 'poor', 'boy', 'actions', 'were', 'absolutely', 'unforgiveable', 'wonder', 'boy', 'anger', 'issues', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'state', 'mind', 'revealed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'crap', 'had', 'persevere', 'child.Another', 'smaller', 'element', 'storyline', 'boys', 'relationship', 'girl', 'up', 'counselor', 'meetings', 'Navy', 'training', 'exercises', 'beautiful', 'very', 'polite', 'first', 'young', 'man', 'reluctant', 'be', 'noticeably', 'extremely', 'shy', 'exact', 'reason', 'why', 'revealed', 'much', 'most', 'part', 'storyline', 'boys', 'relationship', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'how', 'friendship', 'develops', 'meeting', 'boy', 'reflecting', 'past', 'revealing', 'tragic', 'life', 'history', '*is*', 'main', 'aspect', 'plotline.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'emotional', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'overall', 'however', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', '5-stars', 'sort', 'wears', 'out', 'while', 'level', 'emotions', 'never', 'ceases-', 'constant', 'thing', 'ending', 'bit', 'predictably', 'written', 'again', 'too', 'emotional', 'tastes', 'really', 'tiny', 'complaint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'ending', 'totally', 'appropriate.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'right', 'wrong', 'everything', 'power', 'change', 'better', 'person', 'obviously', 'just', 'someone', 'communicate', 'deep', 'personal', 'level']",N/A

The film tells the story of Antwone Fisher who at the time was in the Navy. After seeing a psychiatrist, the audience gets to delve into his past, which is tortured at the least. I was sceptical of the film at first. However, once I watched it, I was generally impressed. If you like true stories, Denzel Washington movies, or even military movies, I suggest you buy ANTWONE FISHER today.Antwone Fisher was a guard at a studio when he was discovered. After being discovered, he wrote the story of his life in a screenplay. The result of him being discovered is a great film. It takes the audience on a journey through accounts of abuse, violence, and finding truth. While some of the images and events are disturbing, the film is still good. Also, the star Derek Luke is talented. The combination of a powerful story, talent, and decent music make this film one you should see.This film is not for everyone, and it is not without flaws. If you don't enjoy violence, images of sexual and physical abuse, or psychological movies you won't enjoy ANTWONE FISHER. However, overall the film is great.

Denzel plays Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who looks to solve Antwone's anger issues not by nagging him but by giving him space & letting him come to grip with his anger by giving him space and time to come out with what's really bothering him. Joy Brant plays Cheryl who comes into Antwone's life & gives him the love and attention he seeked for so many years. She cared about him so much and it was obvious in the way she looked at him! with help from her & Jerome he decides to find his long lost mother and find out why she left him in the cold for so many years. the final speech he gives to her is so touching! the ending is so well done, I admit I cried! it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! props to everyone involved in this film!

The beauty of Fisher's screenplay is the story of a young man who must struggle, without those essential building blocks, to first construct a critical interpersonal relationship with his doctor in order to then find missing wider connectedness with family, tribe, and community, and to replace with a sense of identity what was disconnection and anger.  It is no accident that the story is set against the backdrop of military life.  Too often, stories about Service life are about combat and the bonds formed under its strain.  The reality is that peace-time prevails.  And in the male dominated world of the military, the relationships men form with other men--full of intense bonding and love of the nonromantic kind--become the connections that resonate with them for the rest of their lives.  Washington's character, the physician, is also dealing with personal issues; and it is his evolving relationship with patient that makes him, by his own admission, a better individual and healer.  Is this film a story of personal courage; human connectedness; identity; or of a loving relationship?  It is all of these, but mostly the story of a young man who discovers in one such loving relationship the strength to go out in the world and find family, place, and self.  Antwone Fisher is told with an intelligence, emotionalism, and humility that should resonate with all viewers regardless of culture, sex, age, or military service.  If the film doesn't emotionally connect with you on any level, you ought to check your pulse, because you may just not have a heart.  Though it received a long list of awards, the film did not garner even one Oscar nomination, including screenplay, which is a stunning indictment of the Academy Awards.

I love biopics (A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, Cinderella Man, Capote, Walk the Line), and this is one of my favorites.  The true life story of a man as moving as Antwone Fisher is hard to find, and the talent that oozes out of each frame from actors like Denzel and the wonderfully talented Derek Luke (who is much overdue for some recognition) makes each second worth so much.  Antwone (Luke) is a navy man sent to see Jerome Davenport (Washington), the Navy psychologist after Antwone gets in one too many fights.  Antwone has an anger problem and that problem stems back, way back, to a childhood he doesn't want to face.  It takes some time, but eventually Antwone breaks out of his shell and starts to confess all in his life, from abusive foster family, to child molestation to witnessing his best friends murder.  Everything has played such a part in his life now and he is effected so horridly by it all that the only way to get past it is to confront it, and he does this with the help of Davenport and his new love interest played by the beautiful, and talented, Joy Bryant (Get Rich or Die Trying).

This is the classic ""bury the trauma"" and ""let the parents off the hook"" mentality that blocks deeper healing.  No therapist worth his salt preaches forgiveness.3) Sickly idealized romance:  the girlfriend becomes a replacement mother.  In reality Antwone was far too immature to be in a healthy romantic relationship.  I suspect that if we had the chance to look at the realistic version of this relationship we'd see a whole different - and darker - story.4) Radical underestimation of the healing process.  As a patient Antwone barely scratches the surface of his grieving.

604947,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JLRZ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[14, 21]","Despite its palpably made-for-Oprah qualities, this psychological melodrama has its moments. The story revolves around the struggles of African-American Navy sailor Antwone Fisher to control his explosive, self-destructive anger and to confront the personal history of physical and psychological abuse that created his dysfunctional predicament. Fisher, who wrote this screenplay based on his own life, was put up for adoption by a ne'er-do-well mother, then raised in a series of abusive foster care environments, turning as a young adult to the armed forces as a last resort to straighten out his life. As the film opens, he's about to get tossed out of the military due to his habitual brawling, and is sent to see a Navy psychiatrist -- played by director Denzel Washington -- for one last chance. Fisher's character, a self-portrait, is perhaps a bit too warm, fuzzy and puppydoggish, although Derek Luke, the actor who plays the adult Antwone, is absolutely magnetic and expressive, and almost singlehandedly makes this film work. The Navy shrink, on the other hand, is a flimsily realized stereotype -- one of those semi-saintly medical saviors (with personal problems of their own that are brought into focus by the life-affirming struggles of the patients they guide) that Robin Williams nearly killed his career playing again and again and again. The cliche works, but Fisher's script certainly brings nothing new to the role, and as a result Denzel's a bit of a dud in this film. Still, the issues the film addresses are powerful, the brief flashback scenes showing Fisher's childhood abuse are genuinely horrifying, and skillfully, sparingly presented. Although the drama of Fisher's rediscovery of his biological family is symbolically transposed (some might say forced) onto the wider issue of the African-American slave diaspora, the emotional issues are still profound, and the scenes of him opening up about a lifetime of pain, first to his therapist, and then to his lover, will probably ring true for many viewers.",3,"+1/2.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[15, 16]","I believe today's society is too reliant on counselors, therapists, and an abundance of Dr. Phils who tell us how to act and feel.  But ANTWONE FISHER mellowed my opinion of couches and shrinks--made me better understand how a caring professional can make a positive difference in another person's life.I was fascinated to learn this movie is based on a true story; I was even more impressed that newcomer Derek Luke, who plays the title role, is an actual friend of the real Antwone Fisher.  Luke brings a plethora of range to his character:  anger, resentment, confusion, forgivness, integrity, dignity.  Portraying a young sailor trying to come to grips with his painful past--trying to control his violent outbursts--Luke flawlessly stays in character, whereas other newcomers have a tendency to overact.  Antwone Fisher, as it turns out, is a remarkable human being; Derek Luke effectively brings this fact to the forefront.Denzel Washington, portraying Navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport, is superb.  Davenport doesn't belittle, belabor, or browbeat his young patient--he gains Antwone's confidence through soft-spoken empathy and compassion.  As the relationship between the two men evolves, Davenport becomes a surrogate father to Antwone.  Yet Davenport also has problems in his personal life; his friendship with Antwone gives him the additional insight and strength he needs to confront them.The chemistry between Washington and Luke is extraordinary; the scenes featuring just the two of them are spellbinding.  ATWONE FISHER is also Washington's directorial debut; if Washington can furnish such exceptional storytelling right out of the gate, one can only hope he'll decide to go behind the camera again and again.--D.

604949,A3BGLVC6OZM2JW,B00005JLRZ,"douglas barton ""emotions in motion""","[1, 2]","At the beginning of "" Antwone Fisher "" there is a disclaimer that states that some scenes in this film were fictionalized but the core of the story of Antwone's search for his true idenity were completely factual. My intuitions tell me that due to a certain amount of 'padding' it was truly difficult to accept this movie on it's own terms. And, sadly, that be may the core of my less then enthusiastic expereince concerning a movie that asks to be taken at face value. Bearing in mind that this was Denzel Washington's directorial debut, "" Antwone Fisher "" sadly is not the awe inspiring movie experience that I was so initially hopeing for. To be frank I, oddly enough, was expecting something along the lines of "" Good Will Hunting "" with a military bent. While the film most definitely has it's moments it left me with a nagging feeling that somehow a unique opportunity had been lost.While it certainly isn't my intention to [...] Antwone Fisher with faint praise I simply fail to recognize this movie as the "" gripping story of survival and triumph "" that this film purports to be. A movie that proudly wears it's heart as preciptiously on it's sleeve as this one does, for my money, simply needs to bring more to the table then what Mr. Washington provides here...and that is it's curse. It kept running through my mind that the makers of "" Antwone Fisher "" seemed to want their film to be much more emotionally devastating ( and ultimately personally rewarding ) then what it truly is. Sadly, the impact that this movie had on this viewer was far less then devastating. I thought it interesting but, sadly, simply far too mundane to keep me in suspense. Playing the lead role actor Derek Luke is truly gifted as the troubled young seaman who is summarily sent to Naval psychiatrist ( Denzel ) for examination before being considered for expulsion from the military. As the search for Antwones painful past is exhibited in a series of flashbacks I generally felt slightly manipulated ( a huge no-no when it comes to attempting to establish any sort of gripping human drama ) into caring for the young sailor and his search for his true family. Which never bodes well when selling a story based on pure emotion, sadly ommitting any intellectual curiosites that may have sparked the film into the emotional drama that it seemed to, in all earnest, be painfully searching for. Overall, while the movie most certainly had it's moments it came off, at times, feeling much like a film I might see on the Hallmark television channel or even Lifetime, had our protagonist been a woman.Don't misunderstand me though, as both lead actors played very well against each other and the viewer will no doubt find him/herself cheering on Antwone to its predictably somewhat happy ending. In addition, the final scene in the film, which I suspect was inserted to show how Antwone had come full circle and had gained the respect of the psychaitrist seemed truly contrived and gave the air of somehow trying to wrap up circumstances just a little to nicely. Overall, I thought, for a freshman effort, Denzel Washington's directorial debut, if not a little pedestrian, was not without it's success. I do suspect though that as popular as Denzel Washngton is ( right along-side the perennially likable Tom Hanks ) perhaps audiences are giving him a little more leeway as opposed to an established director with a fully realized body of work. And who's to say, perhaps Mr. Washington's next attempt at film-making will be a story much more worthy of his efforts. 3.5 stars",4,Soul Cages,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,3557,"['beginning', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'disclaimer', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'fictionalized', 'core', 'story', 'Antwone', 'search', 'true', 'idenity', 'were', 'completely', 'factual', 'intuitions', 'tell', 'due', 'certain', 'amount', ""'padding"", 'was', 'truly', 'difficult', 'accept', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'sadly', 'be', 'may', 'core', 'less', 'then', 'enthusiastic', 'expereince', 'concerning', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'Bearing', 'mind', 'was', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'sadly', 'not', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'so', 'initially', 'hopeing', 'be', 'frank', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'military', 'bent', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'moments', 'left', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'had', 'been', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'intention', '[', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'faint', 'praise', 'simply', 'fail', 'recognize', 'movie', 'gripping', 'story', 'survival', 'triumph', 'film', 'be', 'movie', 'proudly', 'heart', 'preciptiously', 'sleeve', 'one', 'money', 'simply', 'bring', 'more', 'table', 'then', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'here', 'curse', 'kept', 'running', 'mind', 'makers', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'seemed', 'want', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'ultimately', 'personally', 'rewarding', 'then', 'what', 'truly', 'Sadly', 'impact', 'movie', 'had', 'viewer', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'then', 'devastating', 'thought', 'interesting', 'sadly', 'simply', 'far', 'too', 'mundane', 'keep', 'suspense', 'Playing', 'lead', 'role', 'actor', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'truly', 'gifted', 'troubled', 'young', 'seaman', 'who', 'summarily', 'sent', 'Naval', 'psychiatrist', 'Denzel', 'examination', 'being', 'considered', 'expulsion', 'military', 'search', 'Antwones', 'painful', 'past', 'exhibited', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'generally', 'felt', 'slightly', 'manipulated', 'huge', 'no-no', 'when', 'attempting', 'establish', 'sort', 'gripping', 'human', 'drama', 'caring', 'young', 'sailor', 'search', 'true', 'family', 'Which', 'never', 'well', 'when', 'selling', 'story', 'based', 'pure', 'emotion', 'sadly', 'ommitting', 'intellectual', 'curiosites', 'may', 'have', 'sparked', 'film', 'emotional', 'drama', 'seemed', 'earnest', 'be', 'painfully', 'searching', 'Overall', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'had', 'moments', 'came', 'off', 'times', 'feeling', 'much', 'film', 'might', 'see', 'Hallmark', 'television', 'channel', 'even', 'Lifetime', 'had', 'protagonist', 'been', 'woman.Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'though', 'lead', 'actors', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'viewer', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'cheering', 'Antwone', 'predictably', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'ending', 'addition', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'suspect', 'was', 'inserted', 'show', 'how', 'Antwone', 'had', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'had', 'gained', 'respect', 'psychaitrist', 'seemed', 'truly', 'contrived', 'gave', 'air', 'somehow', 'trying', 'wrap', 'up', 'circumstances', 'just', 'little', 'nicely', 'Overall', 'thought', 'freshman', 'effort', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'directorial', 'debut', 'not', 'little', 'pedestrian', 'was', 'not', 'success', 'do', 'suspect', 'though', 'as', 'popular', 'Denzel', 'Washngton', 'right', 'along-side', 'perennially', 'likable', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'perhaps', 'audiences', 'are', 'giving', 'little', 'more', 'leeway', 'opposed', 'established', 'director', 'fully', 'realized', 'body', 'work', 'who', 'say', 'perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'next', 'attempt', 'film-making', 'will', 'be', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'worthy', 'efforts', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

I remember seeing this film when it first came out on DVD and thinking that I missed out on a great theatrical experience. This has got to be one of the better directorial debuts from an actor. Denzel really surprised me with this film as far as the filmmaking, because I knew he would be great in this film as an actor.The film is the real life story of one Antwone Fisher obviously and what a story it is, so good he got hired to write it while working as a security guard at a studio lot. The film is a flashback/present day setting in which the hot tempered Fisher is sent to the Navy psychiatrist in order to stay in the Navy. It is here that Antwone is forced to tell his story but it is also here that Antwone learns to deal with that same story. I can honestly say that the things that happened to this man are horrible and will at times leave you wanting to cry. The things his foster family did to him are horrendous and no child should have to go through that, by the end when he is confronting all that plagued him you will no doubt be cheering for him. The real life Antwone wrote a marvelous screenplay that only he could obviously but none the less it was great, in fact he is still a screenwriter now for such films as ATL.Derek Luke is excellent in the title role as he not only has to deal with Mr. Washington but also with shipmates that only further his problems. Luke portrays Fisher perfectly as he will bring a lot of emotion out of you with his performance. Same can be said for Malcolm David Kelley and Cory Hodges who play Fisher as kids, Kelley at age 7 and Cory at 14 and both of which do an outstanding job. In fact a lot of the most emotional scenes happen when he is younger; Kelley's scenes in particular can be hard to watch at times. Of course Denzel Washington is great as Dr. Jerome Davenport who is the man that turns Fisher's life around while at the same time Fisher turns his around as well. Denzel shines in this role as is Salli Richardson who plays his wife. The scenes with these two are great because the characters are going through one of the worst things that could happen to a couple, they can not have kids and he is shutting himself down. I don't think there was a weak performance in this entire film, every single person hired to act in this movie was top notch.This was a great film to watch and enjoy but it is quite emotional and may bring tender hearts to tears, either way though I think you will enjoy this film.",5,REALLY GOOD FILM,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2595,"['ANTWONE', 'FISHERMan', 'Denzel', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'real', 'emotional', 'story', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'missed', 'out', 'great', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'directorial', 'debuts', 'actor', 'Denzel', 'really', 'surprised', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'filmmaking', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'actor.The', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'obviously', 'what', 'story', 'so', 'good', 'got', 'hired', 'write', 'while', 'working', 'security', 'guard', 'studio', 'lot', 'film', 'flashback/present', 'day', 'setting', 'hot', 'tempered', 'Fisher', 'sent', 'Navy', 'psychiatrist', 'order', 'stay', 'Navy', 'here', 'Antwone', 'forced', 'tell', 'story', 'also', 'here', 'Antwone', 'deal', 'same', 'story', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'things', 'happened', 'man', 'are', 'horrible', 'will', 'times', 'leave', 'wanting', 'cry', 'things', 'foster', 'family', 'did', 'are', 'horrendous', 'child', 'should', 'have', 'go', 'end', 'when', 'confronting', 'plagued', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'cheering', 'real', 'life', 'Antwone', 'wrote', 'marvelous', 'screenplay', 'only', 'could', 'obviously', 'none', 'less', 'was', 'great', 'fact', 'still', 'screenwriter', 'now', 'such', 'films', 'ATL.Derek', 'Luke', 'excellent', 'title', 'role', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'also', 'shipmates', 'only', 'problems', 'Luke', 'Fisher', 'perfectly', 'will', 'bring', 'lot', 'emotion', 'performance', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Malcolm', 'David', 'Kelley', 'Cory', 'Hodges', 'who', 'play', 'Fisher', 'kids', 'Kelley', 'age', '7', 'Cory', '14', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'fact', 'lot', 'most', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'happen', 'when', 'younger', 'Kelley', 'scenes', 'particular', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'course', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'who', 'man', 'Fisher', 'life', 'around', 'same', 'time', 'Fisher', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'Denzel', 'role', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'who', 'wife', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'one', 'worst', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'couple', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'kids', 'shutting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'weak', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'single', 'person', 'hired', 'act', 'movie', 'was', 'top', 'notch.This', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'emotional', 'may', 'bring', 'tender', 'hearts', 'tears', 'way', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

He meets a psychologist (Denzel Washington) who lifts his spirits up even though he's reminiscing about his unpleasant years.Derek Luke is an excellent up-and-comer who gives a naturalistic performance as Fisher, and Washington's directorial debut is fine.I was astounded by the real Antwone Fisher, who first revealed his story as a film-studio security guard, whose sad life is penetrating theme to the audience.

Derek Luke's performance was Oscar-worthy, and Denzel Washington did a fairly good job with what he was given. True, his character seemed a little two-dimensional, but that can be blamed on the script, not the acting.  The flashback scenes of abuse used just the right amounts of graphic-ness - the viewer was left wincing and horrified, but not totally grossed out. I especially liked the ending to this film - it was believable, and yet it was still uplifting. So many times in movies today we see unimaginable pain with no end, or are forced to watch contrived sugary endings. &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; was neither of the above. It was truly inspiring. The only thing stopping this movie from being five stars was the lack of characterization of Washington's character. The script should have either gone deeper into his home troubles, or should have left them out entirely. This was a movie about Antwone, and, especially in the bathroom speech, the psychiatrist's own problems seemed to have been added as an afterthought.

604963,A3I73B1FYGJIOD,B00005JLRZ,Jennifer C.,"[3, 3]","Many thanks to Amazon.com for sending me this DVD.  I will say that I normally avoid full screen versions of movies, as they almost always destroy the director's original vision of how the scenes should look by chopping off the action on the left and right sides of your screen.  This movie is no exception.  There are some scenes with simply gorgeous cinematography and watching the full screen version only makes me want to trade it in for a widescreen one because I know I'm missing half the picture this way and it irks me.That said, there's plenty of rage and violence in this film (with good reason, I might add), and after the gorgeous opening dream sequence, it starts off with a pretty testosterone fueled fight in the locker room between him and another Navy man.  As a result, Antwone is sent to the psych clinic where eventually, he is able to start to work through all of his unresolved anger issues, which stem from a rather dysfunctional childhood.  At first, it is made quite obvious that Antwone doesn't want to play the game -- who in his right mind would want to dredge up all that pain again? -- but he soon comes to realize that the Naval psychiatrist, played by Denzel Washington, really has his well-being at heart.  Once Antwone learns to trust, he is able to open the floodgates to reveal the puzzle pieces which comprise his tormented childhood.Antwone is an intelligent man who was abandoned by his mother, constantly kicked down by his foster ""family"" and others, and somehow still has the courage to pick himself up and  dust himself off after such shameful mental, physical and emotional abuse by the people who should have cared for him and protected him in his formative years.  It's great to see an abused child overcome the pain and grow up to become a mature, courageous, well-adjusted man with the help of therapy and true friendships.I was more interested in the psychological aspect of this movie than the romantic one --  purely a matter of personal taste -- but the scenes between Cheryl and Antwone were enjoyable and sweet and their chemistry was good.

I had seen this film numerous time especially on HBO and it's very true to life. I imagine that the actual process of Antwone's risking finding his ""roots"" and coming to terms with his birth family was based on more than three psych sessions. There is much to be said for good psychotherapy. More African American women and men suffer untold anguish keeping harsh realities of life to themselves under the misconception of ""being strong!"" while suffering from illnesses of the mind.Oscar winner, Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes which I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy - check out the gigantic-sized pancakes!) and the ending (dreams turned into reality), which beautifully tied the story together. In addition to directorial responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this movie. All the actors represented their parts well.Actor, Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed very real and heart-tugging work. Joy Bryant who played the part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters. My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him. Priceless.

This movie is based on the real life of Antwone Fisher and the screenplay is actually written by Antwone Fisher himself!  For a first time director, Washington did a fantastic job and made one of the best movies of 2002.The movie opens with a slow montage of a dream.  Antwone Fisher is dreaming of himself as young boy.  He dreams of a big feast with a large loving family welcoming him.  It is a sweet dream, but it ends abruptly.  We hear a cow bell, hear a gunshot, and see a red flash on the screen.  Fisher (Derek Luke) awakes.  He is in the United States Navy and is in his bunk on his ship.  We are presented very quickly with one of the major problems in Fisher's life: Anger.  It doesn't take much to set him off, and when he gets angry he fights.  Since fighting is an offense in the military and Fisher pleads guilty, his punishment includes seeing a psychiatrist.The psychiatrist that he is assigned to is Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington).  Though Fisher is initially reluctant, he begins to open up and tell his story at the insistence of Davenport.  His past has been full of pain.  His father was murdered two months before Antwone was born and his mother gave birth to him in prison.  He was raised an orphanage and once in a foster home.  The scenes in the foster home give rise to some of the most painful images of the film and thoroughly explain Fisher's anger.  It also presents the opportunities for Antwone's healing.  Despite how this may be sounding, the problem and solution are not presented as simply as might be implied.  Each time that it seems like we are leading into the conclusion of the film, we get another glimpse of Fisher's past and more is revealed that subtly changes how we viewed the story arc.  Not only is Antwone Fisher going through therapy, we are getting to see it.  We see the issues of trust and the slow revelations that take time to come out.  There are things that Fisher was reluctant to talk about.  Some things took most of the movie to come out.  I suspect this is part of Fisher's healing process, how long some things took for him to be able to reveal.This is a powerful movie, a bit painful at times, but an absolute joy to behold.  From start to finish this is an excellent movie and it doesn't ever take a wrong step.  This was very well done, and this is one of the best movies of 2002. Antwone Fisher is worth watching, and I would even suggest that somewhat who buys this without having seen it first will not be disappointed.",5,great directorial debut by Denzel Washington,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,2551,"['was', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'screenplay', 'actually', 'written', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Washington', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2002.The', 'movie', 'slow', 'montage', 'dream', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'dreaming', 'young', 'boy', 'big', 'feast', 'large', 'loving', 'family', 'welcoming', 'sweet', 'dream', 'abruptly', 'hear', 'cow', 'bell', 'hear', 'gunshot', 'see', 'red', 'flash', 'screen', 'Fisher', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'awakes', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'bunk', 'ship', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'quickly', 'one', 'major', 'problems', 'Fisher', 'life', 'Anger', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'set', 'off', 'when', 'angry', 'fighting', 'offense', 'military', 'Fisher', 'pleads', 'guilty', 'punishment', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist.The', 'psychiatrist', 'assigned', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Fisher', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'open', 'up', 'tell', 'story', 'insistence', 'Davenport', 'past', 'been', 'full', 'pain', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'two', 'months', 'Antwone', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'gave', 'birth', 'prison', 'was', 'raised', 'orphanage', 'once', 'foster', 'home', 'scenes', 'foster', 'home', 'give', 'rise', 'most', 'painful', 'images', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'explain', 'Fisher', 'anger', 'also', 'opportunities', 'Antwone', 'healing', 'how', 'may', 'be', 'sounding', 'problem', 'solution', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'as', 'simply', 'might', 'be', 'implied', 'time', 'are', 'leading', 'conclusion', 'film', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Fisher', 'past', 'more', 'revealed', 'subtly', 'how', 'viewed', 'story', 'arc', 'Not', 'only', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'going', 'therapy', 'are', 'getting', 'see', 'see', 'issues', 'trust', 'slow', 'revelations', 'take', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'are', 'things', 'Fisher', 'was', 'reluctant', 'talk', 'things', 'took', 'most', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'suspect', 'part', 'Fisher', 'healing', 'process', 'how', 'long', 'things', 'took', 'be', 'able', 'reveal.This', 'powerful', 'movie', 'bit', 'painful', 'times', 'absolute', 'joy', 'behold', 'start', 'finish', 'excellent', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'take', 'wrong', 'step', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2002', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'even', 'suggest', 'somewhat', 'who', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

It is also quite indicative of the times in which we live as it tells the tale of a young man that suffers through a childhood that would've literally destroyed many people, yet Antwone Fisher survived and eventually thrived in spite of his unimaginable childhood!As a directorial debut for Denzel Washington, this movie stands out brilliantly.  Given a low film budget and the constraints that were placed on him by filming on a naval base during and after the events of September 11th, 2001, his on screen and behind the screen performances come through in the quality of this film.  Derek Luke's performance as Antwone Fisher sets him apart as an outstanding actor who can easily cover the full the range of emotions that are inherent skills among the top actors in the business and he will probably feature prominently in many future roles.The premise:Antwone Fisher is the true story of a young man that begins on a naval vessel as we see Antwone waking up from a blissful dream yet he seems to be terrorized by the dream.  He then sets off to take care of the first order of business in the daily life of the military, the public personal hygiene.  Young Mr. Fisher's temper at this time is extraordinarily short as another sailor makes a racial slur and he belts him.  This action immediately lands him in front of the commanding officer of the ship, for non judicial punishment, which I believe is called a Captain's Mast in the Navy.  The Captain, being a good commanding officer, does his best to save Mr. Fisher's career by not having him thrown out of the Navy and instead sends him to one of the base's psychologists to make an attempt to determine where all of his anger his coming from and hopefully help him.  Here is where Denzel Washington steps in as the base psychologist and his role most definitely turns out to be much more than being Mr. Fisher's psychologist.I definitely recommend this film to any and all fans that are interested in a good drama that will definitely carry you through the whole range of emotions, from being appalled to being quite happy for this extraordinary man, Antwone Fisher.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Full length Audio Commentary by Director/Actor Denzel Washington and Executive Producer, Todd Black- ""Meeting Antwone Fisher"" Featurette- ""The Making of Antwone Fisher"" Behind the Scenes Featurette- ""Hollywood and the Navy"" Featurette",4,"Antwone Fisher - Heart wrenching, yet uplifting!",1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,2509,"['Antwone', 'Fisher', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'extremely', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'yet', 'uplifting', 'end', 'also', 'quite', 'indicative', 'times', 'live', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'childhood', 'would', ""'ve"", 'literally', 'destroyed', 'many', 'people', 'yet', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'survived', 'eventually', 'thrived', 'spite', 'unimaginable', 'childhood', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movie', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'Given', 'low', 'film', 'budget', 'constraints', 'were', 'placed', 'filming', 'naval', 'base', 'events', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'screen', 'screen', 'come', 'quality', 'film', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'performance', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'apart', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'cover', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'are', 'inherent', 'skills', 'top', 'actors', 'business', 'will', 'probably', 'feature', 'prominently', 'many', 'future', 'roles.The', 'premise', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'naval', 'vessel', 'see', 'Antwone', 'waking', 'up', 'blissful', 'dream', 'yet', 'be', 'terrorized', 'dream', 'then', 'take', 'care', 'first', 'order', 'business', 'daily', 'life', 'military', 'public', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'Mr.', 'Fisher', 'temper', 'time', 'extraordinarily', 'short', 'sailor', 'racial', 'slur', 'belts', 'action', 'immediately', 'front', 'commanding', 'officer', 'ship', 'non', 'judicial', 'punishment', 'believe', 'called', 'Captain', 'Mast', 'Navy', 'Captain', 'being', 'good', 'commanding', 'officer', 'best', 'save', 'Mr.', 'Fisher', 'career', 'not', 'having', 'thrown', 'Navy', 'instead', 'one', 'base', 'psychologists', 'make', 'attempt', 'determine', 'where', 'anger', 'coming', 'hopefully', 'help', 'Here', 'where', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'base', 'psychologist', 'role', 'most', 'definitely', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'Mr.', 'Fisher', 'psychologist.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'are', 'interested', 'good', 'drama', 'will', 'definitely', 'carry', 'whole', 'range', 'emotions', 'being', 'appalled', 'being', 'quite', 'happy', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Full', 'length', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Director/Actor', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Todd', 'Black-', 'Meeting', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'Featurette-', 'Making', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'Scenes', 'Featurette-', 'Hollywood', 'Navy', 'Featurette']",N/A

604975,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLRZ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","I live in a city that is off the beaten path, especially when it comes to movies.  ""Lost in Translation"" never came here and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" only made it to the local art theater.  I remember when ""Boyz in the Hood"" came to town there was a story about it in the newspaper that made it sound for all the world that it was a foriegn film, and there is a sense in which that is true because the idea of living in a place where police helicopters are buzzing overhead all the time is beyond our experience.  But even though films by African-American directors do not always manage to make it up this far into the Northland, I have made a point of checking them out when they are released on video and DVD.  One of the main reasons is that directors like Spike Lee and John Singleton are making films that speaks to the African-American experience in America.  This seems self-evident, but I have to tell you that very few movies have spoken to me directly about my life; I have identified with the television series ""thirtysomething"" and ""Once and Again,"" at vastly different times in my life, more than anything else.  But I can still appreciate the sense of purpose I almost always find in these films.We have all heard the alarming statistics about how many African-American children are raised in homes without a father and the devastaing impact that has had on generations of such children, and on one level ""Antwone Fisher"" is about one such child.  This 2003 film begins with a dream in which Antwone walks into a room and finds his entire family gathered for a big meal.  Then he wakes up on the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier on which he serves.  The next thing we know Antwone is getting into fights if anybody says the wrong word to him.  The captain hits him with a list of punishments and also requires him to see a therapist, Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington),  before the ship sails again.  Antwone refuses to talk and in the tradition of ""Good Will Hunting"" Davenport waits him out.  Eventually Antwone begins to tell his story and we learn of his horrific childhood.Antwone's father was murdered before he was born, which was in the prison where his mother was surving time.  When we see him as a boy he is in a foster home where he is abused emotionally, physically, and sexually.  All of his problems stem from what happened then and Davenport helps Antwone to put the pieces together.  But the final part of the healing process is Davenport's insistance that he has to go and find his family, whatever there is left to be found, and confront the last of his demons.  At this point we discover that everything in the first hour-and-a-half of ""Antwone Fisher"" has been mere prologue to the powerful series of scenes that conclude the film.The story behind this film is almost as impressive as the film itself.  Fisher was a security guard at the Sony Studio when his screenplay was bought and Denzel Washington decided to make it in his first try at director.  Then throw into the mix Derek Luke, a newcomer who was cast in the lead role and the end result is even more impressive.  We are told at the end of the film that Fisher based the screenplay on his life but dramatized some of the scenes, which is always the case, though rarely admitted so boldly.

604981,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JLRZ,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Please note: This review is for the widescreen DVD edition of Antwone Fisher.Antwone Fisher is a masterpiece! I was so moved as I watched this film based on a real life story and although I&#8217;m certainly not going to spoil it all for you I will readily admit that in the last thirty minutes or so the film becomes a real tearjerker. Derek Luke performed brilliantly as Antwone Fisher, a young man in the navy without a family but with a terrible temper that gets him into trouble rather easily and all too often. Denzel Washington both directs and acts very convincingly in this film and together with Derek Luke they carry this movie with panache. The choreography and cinematography are very well done and the sets reflect a lot of careful forethought. In addition, the quality of the print and the sound are excellent.At the start we quickly meet Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), a young lad in the navy who has a quick temper; he gets into a fight with a superior officer that has him demoted&#8212;and sent to navy psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) for three mandatory sessions after which Davenport will make a recommendation as to whether or not young Antwone should stay in the navy. Antwone has great difficulty opening up to psychiatrist Dr. Davenport but eventually he does begin to tell the doctor about his childhood&#8212;and the horrors he experienced partly because his father was killed before he was even born and his mother was incarcerated when she gave birth to him and he became a ward of the state. It&#8217;s at this point I began to truly feel for Antwone and that&#8217;s a testament to just how well Derek Luke plays Antwone! We also see Antwone begin a relationship, albeit slowly and cautiously, with a young woman who is also in the navy; Joy Bryant gives another masterful performance as Antwone&#8217;s girlfriend Cheryl, too.The three sessions are up but Davenport and Antwone continue their working relationship with Davenport mentoring Antwone as Antwone becomes more involved with Cheryl. Dr. Davenport also discovers much, much more about the brutality young Antwone had to endure as a child and as a young adult. Look in particular for a fantastic performance by Novella Nelson as Mrs. Tate, Antwone&#8217;s foster mother who isn&#8217;t exactly the motherly type.There&#8217;s more to the story than this but suffice it to say that we see what transpires when Antwone, together with Cheryl for moral support, goes on leave to find as many members of his family as he can. This proves to be a huge challenge for the young man even with Cheryl at his side.Look for other first-rate performances by Viola Davis as Eva; Salli Richardson-Whitfield as Berta Davenport; Leonard Earl Howze as &#8220;Pork Chop;&#8221; Kevin Connolly as &#8220;Slim;&#8221; Stephen Snedden as Berkley; Yolonda Ross as Nadine; De'Angelo Wilson as Antwone&#8217;s friend Jessie at age 19 and Earl Billings as Uncle James Elkins&#8212;among others!The DVD comes with some bonus features; I particularly liked the optional running commentary by director Denzel Washington and producer Todd Black as well as the featurette entitled &#8220;Meeting Antwone Fisher.&#8221;I highly recommend Antwone Fisher for fans of the actors in this film as well as drama with some romance mixed in for a great effect. In addition, people who like films based on real life stories and events will not be disappointed.",5,"""Who will cry for the little boy, lost and all alone / Who will cry for the little boy, abandoned without his own""",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,3429,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Antwone', 'Fisher.Antwone', 'Fisher', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'watched', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', '8217', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'will', 'readily', 'admit', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'real', 'tearjerker', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'performed', 'brilliantly', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'young', 'man', 'navy', 'family', 'terrible', 'temper', 'trouble', 'rather', 'easily', 'too', 'often', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'directs', 'very', 'convincingly', 'film', 'together', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'carry', 'movie', 'panache', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'sets', 'reflect', 'lot', 'careful', 'forethought', 'addition', 'quality', 'print', 'sound', 'are', 'start', 'quickly', 'meet', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'young', 'lad', 'navy', 'who', 'quick', 'temper', 'fight', 'superior', 'officer', 'demoted', '8212', 'sent', 'navy', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'three', 'mandatory', 'sessions', 'Davenport', 'will', 'make', 'recommendation', 'not', 'young', 'Antwone', 'should', 'stay', 'navy', 'Antwone', 'great', 'difficulty', 'opening', 'up', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Davenport', 'eventually', 'begin', 'tell', 'doctor', 'childhood', '8212', 'horrors', 'experienced', 'partly', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'even', 'born', 'mother', 'was', 'incarcerated', 'when', 'gave', 'birth', 'became', 'ward', 'state', '8217', 's', 'point', 'began', 'truly', 'feel', 'Antwone', '8217', 's', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Antwone', 'also', 'see', 'Antwone', 'begin', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'cautiously', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'navy', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Antwone', '8217', 'girlfriend', 'Cheryl', 'too.The', 'three', 'sessions', 'are', 'up', 'Davenport', 'Antwone', 'continue', 'working', 'relationship', 'Davenport', 'mentoring', 'Antwone', 'Antwone', 'more', 'involved', 'Cheryl', 'Dr.', 'Davenport', 'also', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'brutality', 'young', 'Antwone', 'had', 'endure', 'child', 'young', 'adult', 'Look', 'particular', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Novella', 'Nelson', 'Mrs.', 'Tate', 'Antwone', '8217', 'foster', 'mother', 'who', 'isn', '8217', 'exactly', 'motherly', 'type.There', '8217', 'more', 'story', 'say', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'Antwone', 'together', 'Cheryl', 'moral', 'support', 'leave', 'find', 'many', 'members', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'huge', 'challenge', 'young', 'man', 'even', 'Cheryl', 'side.Look', 'other', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Eva', 'Salli', 'Richardson-Whitfield', 'Berta', 'Davenport', 'Leonard', 'Earl', 'Howze', '8220', 'Pork', 'Chop', '8221', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', '8220', 'Slim', '8221', 'Stephen', 'Snedden', 'Berkley', 'Yolonda', 'Ross', 'Nadine', ""De'Angelo"", 'Wilson', 'Antwone', '8217', 'friend', 'Jessie', 'age', '19', 'Earl', 'Billings', 'Uncle', 'James', 'Elkins', '8212', 'others', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'particularly', 'liked', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'producer', 'Todd', 'Black', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'entitled', '8220', 'Meeting', 'Antwone', 'Fisher.', '8221', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'fans', 'actors', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'romance', 'mixed', 'great', 'effect', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'events', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Dr. Davenport (Denzel Washington) insists that Antwone see him once a week, whether or not he wants to talk about his problems. Finally, motivated by sheer boredom, Antwone tells Dr. Davenport about his past: the parents that abandoned him, the abusive foster home, the loss of his only friend, and the destitution that compelled him to join the Navy. Dr. Davenport takes an interest in freeing young Antwone from his consuming anger, and suggests that he try to find what is left of his long-lost family. With the help of his psychiatrist and his girlfriend Cheryl (Joy Bryant), Antwone is able to put the worst of his past behind him and embrace the family he should have had.""Antwone Fisher"" is a true story; its screenplay was written by Antwone Fisher himself. The film is also actor Denzel Washington's first effort at directing a feature film. Washington does a solid job. ""Antwone Fisher"" is presented in a straight-forward, conventional biopic style, which effectively evokes sympathy for its main character. Derek Luke is very good as Antwone Fisher. The actors who play the villains in Fisher's life are especially convincing and deserve a lot of credit. I'm not sure what to think of Denzel Washington's performance as Dr. Davenport, though. Dr. Davenport strikes me as pompous, selfish, and fairly screwed up. It seems to me that he wants to help Antwone Fisher in order to satisfy his own ego more than anything else. I found his character distasteful. I don't know if the Dr. Davenport was really like that, if he was written that way in the screenplay, if that is Denzel Washington's interpretation, or if it's just my interpretation.

It shows the struggles that face people who have not had the security of a family, and it helps those who haven't experienced that sort of insecurity relate to those that have.I'm not a big-fan of love interests either, but I think it was important to show that his girlfriend played a role in his rehabilitation. One thing I did not like about the movie was Denzel's character almost compelling Fisher to lose his virginity. I don't think this sends the right message especially to those young people who may be watching this movie, but then what movies do?The acting wasn't bad, although the movie had that Hollywood feel to it. I think some stories get through even if they are painted with tinsel-town's brush, and for this to have been Denzel's debut as a director adds to the specialness of this movie. I hope he comes out with another one sometime soon.On another note, it's good to see a positive potrayal of Afro-American people on film, there have been too many 'gangsta' films coming out of Hollywood of late.Finally, watch this movie to get a perspective on your own life.",4,Washington's debut is promising,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1550,"['must', 'admit', 'shamefully', 'did', 'move', 'tears', 'definitely', 'sad', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'ghettoes.Antwone', 'Fisher', 'story', 'importance', 'families', 'emotional', 'development', 'human', 'beings', 'earliest', 'age', 'time', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'bombarded', 'guilt-stories', 'tend', 'shake', 'off', 'what', 'consider', 'attempt', 'making', 'feel', 'guilty', 'story', ""n't"", 'making', 'anyone', 'feel', 'guilt', 'struggles', 'face', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'security', 'family', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'sort', 'insecurity', 'relate', 'have.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big-fan', 'love', 'interests', 'think', 'was', 'important', 'show', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'role', 'rehabilitation', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'Denzel', 'character', 'almost', 'compelling', 'Fisher', 'lose', 'virginity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'message', 'especially', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'then', 'what', 'movies', 'do', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'think', 'stories', 'get', 'even', 'are', 'painted', 'tinsel-town', 'brush', 'have', 'been', 'Denzel', 'debut', 'director', 'specialness', 'movie', 'hope', 'out', 'one', 'sometime', 'soon.On', 'note', 'good', 'see', 'positive', 'potrayal', 'Afro-American', 'people', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', ""'gangsta"", 'films', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'late.Finally', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'perspective', 'own', 'life']",N/A

It is about how childhood abuse and abandonment affects the life and career of a Navy enlisted man, especially in the area of anger.  It is a little painful to watch at times, because as Antwone Fisher (beautifully played by Derek Luke) remembers his pain, you also experience it in a way.  Ultimately, however, the effect is not dark but inspirational.  The movie is about how Antwone struggles to be strong and to overcome his past---this struggle, to one degree or another, is one we all can identify with.The acting was wonderful and the writing was also.  The special features that came on the DVD version I bought (widescreen version) included information and a feature about the real Antwone Fisher.  After he left the Navy, he was a security guard.  A producer discovered his background, believed in him, and supported him in writing the screenplay himself.  So the film is especially poignant in that it was written by the man who experienced it, one who does not have a writing background or college degree, yet who writes movingly, realistically, and wonderfully.Although the subject is serious, the film does not leave you with a depressing feeling, but encouraged and uplifted about the human experience.  I would have given it five starts, but I save that rating for ""great"" movies; although this movie was not great, it was moving and very worthwhile to watch and own.****",4,"A good movie, good acting, inspirational...a bit painful...",1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,1458,"['****This', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'viewing', 'experience', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'abandonment', 'life', 'career', 'Navy', 'enlisted', 'man', 'especially', 'area', 'anger', 'little', 'painful', 'watch', 'times', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'pain', 'also', 'experience', 'way', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'effect', 'not', 'dark', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'how', 'Antwone', 'be', 'strong', 'overcome', 'past', '-this', 'struggle', 'one', 'degree', 'one', 'can', 'identify', 'with.The', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'was', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'came', 'DVD', 'version', 'bought', 'widescreen', 'version', 'included', 'information', 'feature', 'real', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'left', 'Navy', 'was', 'security', 'guard', 'producer', 'discovered', 'background', 'believed', 'supported', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'film', 'especially', 'poignant', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'who', 'experienced', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'writing', 'background', 'college', 'degree', 'who', 'movingly', 'realistically', 'subject', 'serious', 'film', 'not', 'leave', 'depressing', 'feeling', 'encouraged', 'uplifted', 'human', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'starts', 'save', 'rating', 'great', 'movies', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'moving', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'own', '****']",N/A

What people all long for as they celebrate, as if compulsively, the annual rehearsals of Thanksgiving and other holidays?When I was young, I used to help my parents update the books of pictures of children in foster care.  Each state had a large binder.  And in each one were pictures of hundreds, thousands of young children, mostly African-American.  The pictures were removed when they turned 18. I still remember their faces, especially those of siblings who would not be parted.Antwone was one who made it through and who found, despite being emotionally and physically tortured, some kind of peace and viable adulthood.  May this movie encourage us to return again to the children we all have left behind.  Children do not deserve the bad ways they are treated.  They deserve to have their hands held, their faces held, their stomachs filled, and their loves returned.The foster care system and the plight of African-American children is not a ""black"" problem.

That the movie should present itself like this, as a kind of &quot;Ordinary People&quot; with more than dysfunction at its heart, instead of a straight, harrowing experience, speaks to just how ingrained the psychotherapy ethic has become. Whereas &quot;Hunting&quot; is about the therapy itself, the rhythms it can take, the mood of it, &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; uses Washington's character, Jerome Davenport, as a kind of admission price to the meat of the movie; this isn't therapy, it's exposition. By hewing us so close to Antwone's voice-over explanation of traumatic events, the trauma itself is robbed of impacting us in any way aside the version that the manipulative screenplay would prefer.The lead performances by Washington and Derek Luke, who plays Fisher, are genial enough, as is the work by the va-va-va Joy Bryant. But the movie is not about a solution to Fisher's troubles -- it knows the solution, and metes it out slowly to the audiences in the talking bits that occur between flashback traumas. There is an emotional scene at movie's end that works on pure dramatic value alone. But Washington, and the real life Fisher, hold the abuse scenes too dear to their heart; they are graphic, and very, very sad, but they merely shock, and nothing else; they exist in such a specific framework of the movie that they are little more than cues.Which is not to say Washington is a poor filmmaker. Visually, he shows promise, although that is not hard in today's directorial climate. Washington has an eye for performance, and beautiful women, and he uses the camera in a subtle, slightly lingering fashion to export far more out of Bryant's character than there is on the written page. Washington seems to know, and we seem to agree, that this is one seriously beautiful woman Antwone's involved with. She provides, without us really acknowledging it, the movie's real motivation for success.Washington, too, enjoys the brooding passivity of Luke's performance, as he smolders just underneath the surface of dispassionate analysis. Luke tells his ugly story as if he's turned over so many times as to learn how to tell it well, and while it steals some from the flashbacks, it marks Luke as a formidable player in the room with Washington. For his part, Washington sits back and waits too confidently; his Davenport acts as though he's read the screenplay and is merely waiting for Luke to fire off the first line.&quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; is deeply earnest, and pretty much on the level, and you cannot fault it for those things. It means very well. But it isn't very cinematic and you can see its gears churning before it ever gets there. As much as Luke works himself up, and as good as Bryant looks, the movie never seems to happen away from the preordained movement of the screenplay. It's honest, moving...and boring.",2,The movie's approach subverts the drama.,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,3507,"['quot', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'quot', 'story', 'bright', 'black', 'Naval', 'officer', 'who', 'violence', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'psychologist', 'was', 'delivered', 'built-in', 'comparison', 'schematic', 'theatrical', 'run', 'more', 'few', 'viewers', 'critics', 'labeled', 'minority', 'version', 'quot', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting.', 'quot', 'fact', 'movie', 'directed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'written', 'Fisher', 'quot', 'Hunting', 'quot', 'one', 'important', 'way', 'Damon/Affleck', 'picture', 'made', 'squeals', 'only', 'referencing', 'childhood', 'traumas', 'narrative', 'Washington', 'Fisher', 'show', 'scenes', 'consistently', 'interspersed', 'therapy', 'scenes', 'movie', 'should', 'present', 'kind', 'quot', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'quot', 'more', 'dysfunction', 'heart', 'instead', 'straight', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'just', 'how', 'ingrained', 'psychotherapy', 'ethic', 'become', 'Whereas', 'quot', 'Hunting', 'quot', 'therapy', 'rhythms', 'can', 'take', 'mood', 'quot', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'quot', 'Washington', 'character', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'kind', 'admission', 'price', 'meat', 'movie', ""n't"", 'therapy', 'exposition', 'hewing', 'so', 'close', 'Antwone', 'voice-over', 'explanation', 'traumatic', 'events', 'trauma', 'robbed', 'impacting', 'way', 'version', 'manipulative', 'screenplay', 'would', 'prefer.The', 'lead', 'performances', 'Washington', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'who', 'Fisher', 'are', 'genial', 'enough', 'work', 'va-va-va', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'movie', 'not', 'solution', 'Fisher', 'troubles', 'solution', 'out', 'slowly', 'audiences', 'talking', 'bits', 'occur', 'flashback', 'traumas', 'emotional', 'scene', 'movie', 'end', 'pure', 'dramatic', 'value', 'alone', 'Washington', 'real', 'life', 'Fisher', 'hold', 'abuse', 'too', 'dear', 'heart', 'are', 'graphic', 'very', 'very', 'sad', 'merely', 'shock', 'nothing', 'else', 'exist', 'specific', 'framework', 'movie', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'cues.Which', 'not', 'say', 'Washington', 'poor', 'filmmaker', 'Visually', 'promise', 'not', 'hard', 'today', 'directorial', 'climate', 'Washington', 'eye', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'women', 'camera', 'subtle', 'slightly', 'lingering', 'fashion', 'export', 'far', 'more', 'Bryant', 'character', 'written', 'page', 'Washington', 'know', 'seem', 'agree', 'one', 'seriously', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Antwone', 'involved', 'really', 'acknowledging', 'movie', 'real', 'motivation', 'success.Washington', 'too', 'brooding', 'passivity', 'Luke', 'performance', 'just', 'surface', 'dispassionate', 'analysis', 'Luke', 'ugly', 'story', 'turned', 'over', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'learn', 'how', 'tell', 'well', 'flashbacks', 'Luke', 'formidable', 'player', 'room', 'Washington', 'part', 'Washington', 'back', 'too', 'confidently', 'Davenport', 'read', 'screenplay', 'merely', 'waiting', 'Luke', 'fire', 'off', 'first', 'line.', 'quot', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'quot', 'deeply', 'earnest', 'pretty', 'much', 'level', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'things', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'very', 'cinematic', 'can', 'see', 'gears', 'churning', 'ever', 'there', 'As', 'much', 'Luke', 'up', 'as', 'good', 'Bryant', 'movie', 'never', 'happen', 'away', 'preordained', 'movement', 'screenplay', 'honest', 'moving', 'boring']",N/A

But it's not easy to dismiss Antwone Fisher as derivative as its considerable emotional power and its crafty use of these familiar elements to tell a story about African-American families feels new after all.It's a simple movie with well-timed breakthrough every 20 minutes or so.

Movies directed by actors can be little more than self-serving vanity projects that merely say, &quot;Hey!  I'm an actor!  And I can also direct!  I'm so multitalented!&quot;  You can say the same thing about this movie, but you would be wrong.  While it's a little sentimental at times, &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; is one of the most heartfelt and genuine movies of 2002.  Derek Luke is the title character, a young and hotheaded seaman who gets sent to Jerome Davenport (Washington) for psychiatric evaluation following a heated brawl with another soldier.  From there, the two begin a painful journey that involves discovering the roots of Fisher's anger and, more important, the broken family that left him behind. It's often disturbing to see the psychological abuse Fisher suffered at the hands of his elders, and his strong will and tenacity make him all the more respectable.  Luke gives a decidedly low-key yet strong performance and holds his own admirably against seasoned pro (and two-time Oscar winner) Washington.  But if I have a slight bone to pick with this movie, it's that its plot has a bit of a &quot;heard it before&quot; feel.  Several movies (&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; comes to mind) have already featured a story about a troubled kid whose life gets turned around by an older mentor.

605011,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JLRZ,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 2]","Director:  Denzel WashingtonCast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson.Running Time:  120 minutesRated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse.Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, ""Antwone Fisher"" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change.Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - ""I don't know what to do"" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera.This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, ""Antwone Fisher"" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors.",4,Antwone Fisher  (2002),1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,4276,"['Director', 'Denzel', 'WashingtonCast', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'Malcolm', 'David', 'Kelley', 'Cody', 'Hodges', 'Leonard', 'Earl', 'Howze', 'Novella', 'Nelson.Running', 'Time', '120', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language', 'mature', 'thematic', 'material', 'involving', 'child', 'abuse.Based', 'true', 'story', 'screenplay', 'written', 'eponymous', 'hero', 'own', 'book', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'heart', 'study', 'psychological', 'disturbance', 'laced', 'reasonable', 'amounts', 'Hollywood', 'sugar', 'optimism', 'human', 'spirit', 'peculiarly', 'American', 'medicine', 'swallowed', 'less', 'willingly', 'markets', 'others', 'probably', 'why', 'criticism', 'film', 'often', 'confused', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'directorial', 'talents', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'various', 'workings', 'film', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'story', 'navy', 'where', 'particularly', 'vivid', 'nightmare', 'fellow', 'shipmate', 'hauled', 'up', 'Captain', 'Sent', 'navy', 'psychiatrist', 'Jerome', 'Davenport', 'Washington', 'work', 'out', 'issues', 'anger', 'out', 'stem', 'abused', 'childhood', 'added', 'guilt', 'complex', 'dead', 'friend', 'same', 'time', 'Fisher', 'played', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'newcomer', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'establish', 'first', 'adult', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'inviting', 'Cheryl', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'parallel', 'plot', 'thread', 'Washington', 'character', 'ever-reasonable', 'Dr.', 'Davenport', 'having', 'marital', 'problems', 'due', 'course', 'discover', 'things', 'learn', 'communicating', 'too', 'Fisher', 'catalyst', 'own', 'change.Fisher', 'screenplay', 'reached', 'cameras', 'somewhat', 'circuitous', 'route', 'stint', 'navy', 'little', 'writing', 'experience', 'was', 'hired', 'Sony', 'executive', 'write', 'own', 'story', 'process', 'apparently', 'underwent', '40', 'drafts', 'was', 'acceptable', 'Most', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'uncertainties', 'new', 'craft', 'Washington', 'direction', 'papers', 'reasonably', 'well', 'many', 'cracks', 'most', 'unconvincing', 'elements', 'are', 'subplots', 'revolve', 'main', 'character', 'include', 'psychiatrist', 'ironic', 'domestic', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'Fisher', 'tentative', 'love', 'life', 'One', 'tempted', 'see', 'narrative', 'distractions', 'rather', 'manipulative', 'bolt-on', 'elements', 'leavening', 'appeal', 'central', 'harrowing', 'personal', 'history', 'Fisher', 'Cheryl', 'romance', 'instance', 'context', 'necessarily', 'clumsy', 'also', 'ultimately', 'gauche', 'once', 'consummated', 'left', 'languish', 'further', 'comment', 'further', 'exploration', 'side', 'Fisher', 'maturing', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Perhaps', 'sensing', 'central', 'weakness', 'Fisher', 'script', 'element', 'young', 'African-American', 'tortured', 'life', 'foster', 'child', 'flashbacks', 'deal', ""'slave-nation"", 'justifications', 'Mrs.', 'Tate', 'Novella', 'Nelson', 'suggesting', 'link', 'hurt', 'done', 'individual', 'presumably', 'done', 'whole', 'black', 'race', 'reasoning', 'frankly', 'unconvincing', 'none', 'too', 'interesting', 'Significantly', 'such', 'issues', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'psychiatrist', 'soon', 'disappear', 'view', 'plus', 'side', 'central', 'performance', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'hero', 'perfectly', 'judged', 'acting', 'job', 'neatly', 'inner', 'rage', 'confusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'lack', 'self-pity', 'Washington', 'role', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Given', 'difficulty', 'actor-director', 'role', 'be', 'applauded', 'carrying', 'off', 'so', 'effectively', 'fuss', 'either', 'front', 'camera.This', 'Washington', 'directorial', 'debut', 'admirable', 'job', 'painting', 'thorough', 'picture', 'Antwone', 'even', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'tighter', 'editing', 'still', 'film', 'emotional', 'goods', 'Arguably', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'casting', 'Luke', 'who', 'was', 'total', 'unknown', 'actor', 'mere', 'handful', 'television', 'credits', 'resume', 'obviously', 'Washington', 'knew', 'possessed', 'right', 'goods', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'flaws', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'intriguing', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'estranged', 'enigmatic', 'individual', 'film', 'will', 'stimulate', 'heart', 'make', 'wish', 'small', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'endure', 'such', 'horrors']",N/A

I'm happy to report that Denzel Washington's directorial debut falls into the latter camp.Antowne Fisher tells the true story of a troubled youth. The film centers on the relationship between Fisher's (also the screenwriter of the film)violent out of control temper and the Navy psychologist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) that tries to help him. Normally this type of film would be one of those ""special"" episodes or treacly television movies on one of the cable channels. Fisher jumps those obstacles due to the honest, forthright script and on the mark performances from newcomer Derek Luke and Washington.Washington's performance is refreshingly real and, given some of his recent performances (Training Day comes to mind), avoids cliches. Washington the director is as generous as Washington the actor. His direction is subtle but sure handed avoiding the potential hamfisted antics that have crippled other actor directed film projects. If a stage play is the actor's natural environment, movies can easily become a toxic environment for an actor if not handled well. Washington gives his actors plenty of space as performers allowing them to follow their own instincts. That confidence is mirrored in the pacing and structure of the film as well. Washington shows considerable promise should he choose to abandon his career as an actor.The DVD transfer is beautifully realized. While I can't comment on the widescreen edition, the full screen edition sent to me by amazon.com to review has a  richly detailed picture. The sound is also sharp and well defined. The three featurettes provide a wealth of knowledge on the background of both the production of the film and the real Fisher. Washington's commentary track while not as enlightening as some director's, focuses on the areas that interest him most--the performances and the script. His effusive comments on other aspects of the film are interesting as well.Antowne Fisher is a rarity in today's environment; it's a richly detailed look at one individual's journey to self realization presented with sensitivity and honesty. It's a pity that these are the very qualities that the Hollywood factory tries to portray but usually gets wrong.

605015,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JLRZ,Westley,"[1, 3]","""Antwone Fisher"" is the directorial debut of Denzel Washington.  Based on a true story, the movie depicts the tribulations of the title character, a young African-American Navyman.  As the films opens, Antwone (Derek Luke) is in trouble for fighting with fellow enlisted men and is referred for psychiatric treatment.  His new psychiatrist is, of course, Denzel.  The relationship is chilly initially, but the young man soon opens up to Denzel.  At first glance, Antwone appears to be an aggressive jerk, but it quickly becomes apparent that he's a sensitive young man who has endured a horrific childhood.  Denzel helps him confront and address that past.The film is pretty straight-forward - the kind of unglamorous, old-fashioned drama not made often today.  It's particularly refreshing to see this kind of movie starring an African-American cast.  Denzel's direction is solid, although a bit staid and sentimental. ""Antwone Fisher"" also marked the debut of Derek Luke; his performance is quite good, as it's appropriately understated for the material.  The film builds nicely to some emotional crescendos, although it has perhaps a few too many climaxes.
