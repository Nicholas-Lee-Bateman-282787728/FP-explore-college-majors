1536138,A132FCKZZYSHBY,B007QD0VCG,baylor,"[2, 2]","There's a lot you can say here but i'm going to start with this - i suspect most people watched this film for Sasha Grey. Internationally super famous porn star Sasha Grey starring in a movie about kung fu and prostitutes? This is a movie that knows what audience it's targeting. It's why she's one of the four names on the front of the cover, one of the four characters featured on the cover, one of only two people prominently featured on the cover and the only person on the cover in a bright color on an otherwise black and white cover - this movies wants you to know that Sasha is in this movie.Only she isn't.Well, OK, i guess she is. Jake, a bodyguard for call girls whose favorite girl Sandy has just been killed, is leaving a whore house after stealing his boss' client list when he gets in an elevator. There, in a sweater and overcoat, is Sasha Grey. She says ""Are you Jake? i heard about Sandy. i'm sorry."" They get to the bottom floor and Jake leaves. There, you now have all 5 seconds of Sasha Grey's appearance in the film. She's the background character with essentially no lines who is wearing more clothing than any 3 other people combined.So i'm subtracting a star for flat out dishonesty. What about the movie itself? Not bad.Jake is the main character. He is played by Jason Lee. Jason Lee is also the narrator. And writer. He beats up lots of people and he's good at it. My favorite part is the final hallway fight, which is like a shortened, not quite as awesome version of The Raid. If you haven't seen that fight, Jake ends most fights with 2 or 3 hits so you make the fight last long by throwing a dozen guys at him. How can our hero beat a dozen men? He doesn't. He might be a superhero but this is a realistic action film (no fancy kicks here) and there are limits. Also, honorable mention for the black guy that never speaks and uses capoeira (i don't know if he gets a name but he's not hard to find, there are only like 3 black guys in the film; most of the cast is Asian). That guy had such a fantastic ""yawn, i'm not impressed"" look on his face. He kicked ass.Every actor in this film is fantastic. i'm really surprised at how good they are. The one exception is Jake. The guy who's not only the main character but the ever-present narrator. i'm pretty sure he hired himself for his fighting, not his acting. Not that i'd say his acting is bad, but the movie has the feel of one of those old hard boiled detective movies where an apathetic, matter-of-fact, slightly bored-sounding guy keeps telling you what's happening. And listening to a bored guy be boring isn't much fun. Maybe it was a stylistic choice (bodyguards are supposed to be stoic, right?) but it sucked the fun right out of the listener.Another problem is that Jake isn't exactly a rocket scientist. Why should we care? Because the film is all about Jake following the clues to track down a killer. And he can't. Because he's stupid. Very, very stupid. Thankfully, a prostitute at a bar read Nancy Drew and tells him what Nancy Drew would do. This allows him to make a little progress but he never does figure out what happened, at least not until someone comes and literally tells him. It's easy to spend most of the film yelling ""what, are you a moron?"" and tearing out your hair in frustration.As a film about a strip club fronting a whore house, you obviously expect their to be nudity in the film, and there is. At least once. Probably twice.Pros: Fabulous actors (other than main character), good fight scenes, not awful story, that one capoeira guyCons: Dishonest advertising, joy-sucking commentator, stupid hero",2,The best Sasha Grey film she's never been in,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,3618,"['lot', 'can', 'say', 'here', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'i', 'suspect', 'most', 'people', 'watched', 'film', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'Internationally', 'super', 'famous', 'porn', 'star', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'starring', 'movie', 'kung', 'fu', 'prostitutes', 'movie', 'what', 'audience', 'targeting', 'why', 'one', 'four', 'names', 'front', 'cover', 'one', 'four', 'characters', 'featured', 'cover', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'prominently', 'featured', 'cover', 'only', 'person', 'cover', 'bright', 'color', 'otherwise', 'black', 'white', 'cover', 'movies', 'know', 'Sasha', 'movie.Only', ""isn't.Well"", 'OK', 'i', 'guess', 'Jake', 'bodyguard', 'call', 'girls', 'favorite', 'girl', 'Sandy', 'just', 'been', 'killed', 'leaving', 'whore', 'house', 'stealing', 'boss', 'client', 'list', 'when', 'elevator', 'sweater', 'overcoat', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'Are', 'Jake', 'i', 'heard', 'Sandy', 'i', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'get', 'bottom', 'floor', 'Jake', 'leaves', 'now', 'have', '5', 'seconds', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'appearance', 'film', 'background', 'character', 'essentially', 'lines', 'who', 'wearing', 'more', 'clothing', '3', 'other', 'people', 'combined.So', 'i', ""'m"", 'subtracting', 'star', 'flat', 'out', 'dishonesty', 'What', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad.Jake', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'also', 'narrator', 'writer', 'up', 'lots', 'people', 'good', 'My', 'favorite', 'part', 'final', 'hallway', 'fight', 'shortened', 'not', 'quite', 'awesome', 'version', 'Raid', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'fight', 'Jake', 'most', 'fights', '2', '3', 'hits', 'so', 'make', 'fight', 'last', 'long', 'throwing', 'dozen', 'guys', 'How', 'can', 'hero', 'beat', 'dozen', 'men', ""n't"", 'might', 'be', 'superhero', 'realistic', 'action', 'film', 'fancy', 'here', 'are', 'limits', 'Also', 'honorable', 'mention', 'black', 'guy', 'never', 'capoeira', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'not', 'hard', 'find', 'are', 'only', '3', 'black', 'guys', 'film', 'most', 'cast', 'Asian', 'guy', 'had', 'fantastic', 'yawn', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'look', 'face', 'kicked', 'ass.Every', 'actor', 'film', 'fantastic', 'i', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'one', 'exception', 'Jake', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'ever-present', 'narrator', 'i', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'hired', 'fighting', 'not', 'acting', 'Not', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'acting', 'bad', 'movie', 'feel', 'one', 'old', 'hard', 'boiled', 'detective', 'movies', 'where', 'apathetic', 'matter-of-fact', 'slightly', 'bored-sounding', 'guy', 'keeps', 'telling', 'what', 'happening', 'listening', 'bored', 'guy', 'be', 'boring', ""n't"", 'much', 'fun', 'Maybe', 'was', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'bodyguards', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'stoic', 'right', 'sucked', 'fun', 'right', 'listener.Another', 'problem', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'film', 'Jake', 'following', 'clues', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'Very', 'very', 'stupid', 'Thankfully', 'prostitute', 'bar', 'read', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'what', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'would', 'do', 'make', 'little', 'progress', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'least', 'not', 'someone', 'literally', 'easy', 'spend', 'most', 'film', 'yelling', 'what', 'are', 'moron', 'tearing', 'out', 'hair', 'frustration.As', 'film', 'strip', 'club', 'fronting', 'whore', 'house', 'obviously', 'expect', 'be', 'nudity', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'Probably', 'twice.Pros', 'Fabulous', 'actors', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'not', 'awful', 'story', 'one', 'capoeira', 'guyCons', 'Dishonest', 'advertising', 'joy-sucking', 'commentator', 'stupid', 'hero']",Girl From the Naked Eye
1536139,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B007QD0VCG,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[2, 4]","Late August and most of September is usually a crappy time of year for films at least for me. Sure there is Expendables 2 out and Lawless coming out Friday, but they aren't movies I desperately want to see or willing to fork at least ten bucks for to see, so this is usually the time I rent films, and that's what I did a few days ago. I rented The Raid: Redemption, Flowers of War and The Girl From The Naked Eye. The Naked Eye was a spur of the moment decision on my part. It's only a buck to rent at the Red Box and the summary sounded decent, so I decided to check it out which leads to my review of the film. This will be another relatively short review.The film follows Jake (Jason Yee) a driver for high class escorts who seeks justice for Sandy (Samantha Streets) who he finds shot dead in her apartment; even though he's a driver, a recovering alcoholic and in debit to the mob. The story is a noir-mystery that was influenced by the films of the late 1930's, 1940's and the 1950's. Even for the direct to DVD you can tell the film didn't have that big of a budget. Still the story works pretty well as Jake gives us his internal monologue as he tries to find Sandy's killer. The flashbacks gives detail into the relationship of Jake and Sandy and also gives depth to these flawed characters trying to get out of the sh*tty lives they have. For me this was a surprisingly good story with a sad and fitting ending.The acting by these C level stars was pretty good. Jason Yee was great as the lead showing depth of emotions that fit the role. I had never heard of the actor before this film. He's manly stared in direct to DVD films, but I was surprised he had an un-credited role in The Dark Knight Rises as one of Bane's mercenaries. Ron Yuan (Simon) did a decent job as Jake's boss. He's another actor I'd never heard off, but you might recognize his voice. He gets most of his work from video games. He's had roles in Command and Conquer, Prototype, Alpha Protocol, Fallout New Vegas and many others. Another unknown actor Gary Stretch plays Frank who has an interest in Jake and Samantha. He does a good job playing a bad guy, and apparently has had many roles in direct to DVD films. Samantha Streets is a beautiful actress and did a great job playing Sandy. She's only had guest roles on television shows and minor roles. I think some director or film studio should give her a chance. Samantha is attractive and is a pretty good actress. The overrated retired porn star Sasha Grey is on the cover of the DVD, but she's only in the film for a minute. I know why the studio did that so she could draw attention to the film, but like I said she's only in it for maybe a minute. On a side note I know some men find her attractive, but I don't see the appeal. In my opinion she's ugly and very flat chested. Sasha isn't Hollywood hot and she's not even street hot, and the majority of the women I see on the street are hotter than her. Anyway back to my review.With such a low budget film you can't expect special effects action sequences, and that was probably the worst part of the film. The action was at best decent. The best scene for action was the climax in a hallway, which was surprisingly really good, but that's pretty much the highlight of the film action wise. David Ren wrote and directed this film and he does a good job with the budget he has. I didn't know this until I looked him up, but he also directed another decent direct to DVD film called Shanghai Kiss, which I enjoyed.In my ratings you'll find I'm harsher in my criticism to films that I see in the theater then when I rent or download films. I expect more from films that are released in the theater, because they're supposed to be the higher quality films in writing, directing, acting and action/effects. I am a little more forgiving for films that are direct to DVD or films I rent. Would The Girl From The Naked Eye be worth paying at least ten bucks to see in the theater no, but overall the film is pretty good and I recommend that you rent it; it's worth the buck you'd spend to rent it at Red Box. It has a good story and characters with decent acting, below average action and good directing.",3,A much better film then I thought it would be.,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,4188,"['Late', 'August', 'most', 'September', 'usually', 'crappy', 'time', 'year', 'films', 'least', 'Sure', 'Expendables', '2', 'Lawless', 'coming', 'out', 'Friday', 'are', ""n't"", 'movies', 'desperately', 'want', 'see', 'willing', 'fork', 'least', 'ten', 'bucks', 'see', 'usually', 'time', 'rent', 'films', 'what', 'did', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'rented', 'Raid', 'Redemption', 'Flowers', 'War', 'Girl', 'Naked', 'Eye', 'Naked', 'Eye', 'was', 'spur', 'moment', 'decision', 'part', 'only', 'buck', 'rent', 'Red', 'Box', 'summary', 'sounded', 'decent', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'review', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'relatively', 'short', 'review.The', 'film', 'Jake', 'Jason', 'Yee', 'driver', 'high', 'class', 'escorts', 'who', 'seeks', 'justice', 'Sandy', 'Samantha', 'Streets', 'who', 'shot', 'dead', 'apartment', 'even', 'driver', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'debit', 'mob', 'story', 'noir-mystery', 'was', 'influenced', 'films', 'late', '1930', '1940', '1950', 'Even', 'direct', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'Still', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'Jake', 'internal', 'monologue', 'find', 'Sandy', 'killer', 'flashbacks', 'detail', 'relationship', 'Jake', 'Sandy', 'also', 'depth', 'flawed', 'characters', 'trying', 'get', 'sh*tty', 'have', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'story', 'sad', 'fitting', 'ending.The', 'acting', 'C', 'level', 'stars', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Jason', 'Yee', 'was', 'great', 'lead', 'showing', 'depth', 'emotions', 'fit', 'role', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'actor', 'film', 'manly', 'stared', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'un-credited', 'role', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'one', 'Bane', 'mercenaries', 'Ron', 'Yuan', 'Simon', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'Jake', 'boss', 'actor', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'off', 'might', 'recognize', 'voice', 'most', 'work', 'video', 'games', 'had', 'roles', 'Command', 'Conquer', 'Prototype', 'Alpha', 'Protocol', 'Fallout', 'New', 'Vegas', 'many', 'others', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Gary', 'Stretch', 'Frank', 'who', 'interest', 'Jake', 'Samantha', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'apparently', 'had', 'many', 'roles', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'Samantha', 'Streets', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Sandy', 'only', 'had', 'guest', 'roles', 'television', 'shows', 'minor', 'roles', 'think', 'director', 'film', 'studio', 'should', 'give', 'chance', 'Samantha', 'attractive', 'pretty', 'good', 'actress', 'overrated', 'retired', 'porn', 'star', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'cover', 'DVD', 'only', 'film', 'minute', 'know', 'why', 'studio', 'did', 'could', 'draw', 'attention', 'film', 'said', 'only', 'maybe', 'minute', 'side', 'note', 'know', 'men', 'find', 'attractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'appeal', 'opinion', 'ugly', 'very', 'flat', 'chested', 'Sasha', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'hot', 'not', 'even', 'street', 'hot', 'majority', 'women', 'see', 'street', 'are', 'hotter', 'Anyway', 'back', 'review.With', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'action', 'was', 'best', 'decent', 'best', 'scene', 'action', 'was', 'climax', 'hallway', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'highlight', 'film', 'action', 'wise', 'David', 'Ren', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'looked', 'up', 'also', 'directed', 'decent', 'direct', 'DVD', 'film', 'called', 'Shanghai', 'Kiss', 'enjoyed.In', 'ratings', ""'ll"", 'find', ""'m"", 'harsher', 'criticism', 'films', 'see', 'theater', 'then', 'when', 'rent', 'download', 'films', 'expect', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'theater', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'higher', 'quality', 'films', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'action/effects', 'am', 'little', 'more', 'forgiving', 'films', 'are', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'rent', 'Would', 'Girl', 'Naked', 'Eye', 'be', 'worth', 'paying', 'least', 'ten', 'bucks', 'see', 'theater', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'recommend', 'rent', 'buck', ""'d"", 'spend', 'rent', 'Red', 'Box', 'good', 'story', 'characters', 'decent', 'acting', 'average', 'action', 'good', 'directing']",Girl From the Naked Eye

1536141,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B007QD0VCG,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[8, 9]","""The Girl from the Naked Eye"" is one of those movies of which I'm torn between giving an overlookable three stars and a promising four stars, because even though it excels on all levels of DTV cinema, it does so unevenly.  It's one of the few movies I had actively anticipated to see, and the fact that I waited for so long probably raised my expectations to counterproductive levels...but rest assured, it's a good film. A very good film, if you're thinking strictly in terms of DTV action. Oh what the heck - have four stars, movie.The story: when a young call girl (Samantha Streets,Alien Raiders) is mysteriously killed, her only friend (Jason Yee,Dark Assassin) must untangle a deadly urban web to find the murderer.Be aware, folks, that this is basically an action-packed neo noir flick - something likeSin Citywithout superhuman characters but with a lot more martial arts. It's pulled off surprisingly well, by a surprisingly good cast: Jason Yee is yards ahead of Seagal or Statham as a dramatic action hero, and Samantha Streets is no mere pretty face; and along with an expectedly good performance by Gary Stretch (Alexander) as a dirty cop and an amazingly adept portrayal by Ron Yuan (Blood & Bone) as a pimp, there's a pretty good ensemble to be had here. The script has obviously also been given a good deal of attention, as it feels more like a genuine feature nearly ready for a theatrical release than the typical made-for-DVD dreck. However, regardless of how skillfully it handles the drama throughout its first three-quarters of runtime, the finale disappoints by more or less dropping the solution of the mystery into your lap and then ending sort of unenthusiastically. I'm not sure whether the script writers (including Yee himself) ran out of steam or just couldn't get the ending filmed properly, but I was disappointed either way.The film's trailer gave the impression that the movie's action content would be one I could really sink my teeth into, and it's true...for the most part. I've admired choreographer Ron Yuan's work ever since watchingAngel of Death, and I daresay that ""Naked Eye"" here is his best offering to date. Sadly, it's not as consistent as I would have liked. Twenty minutes in, the film first displays its adrenaline clout via a series of brief exchanges that expertly showcase Yuan's convincing yet liberal style: the vast majority of the fights look realistic enough to actually happen, yet there's no skimping on impressive kicks. A few minor scuffles here and there keep things alive until an ultimately disappointing club brawl. I thought for sure that the movie had failed in its action content when Yee's two battles with the usually-amazing Lateef Crowder (Undisputed III: Redemption) didn't exactly do either man justice, but then the film threw a fastball at me in the form of an incredibly pleasing four-on-one fight in a hallway filmed in a single shot with a single camera - easily one of the best fights I've seen this year.The occasional digital backdrop and digital blood during the fights give the impression that this is a cheap movie, but don't be fooled - it's classier than most things on the market with a similar budget, with swell cinematography and a memorable soundtrack. Having expected neither, I'm happy to say that while the film didn't meet some of my expectations, it outdid others just by being much more competent than anticipated. There's a good chance that people who don't view it on its terms won't have as much fun with it as me, but general martial arts fans, leisurely noir aficionados, and people who've spent the last five years waiting for a new Jason Yee vehicle should definitely be entertained.",4,"""I fell in love once before I died...""",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,3690,"['Girl', 'Naked', 'Eye', 'one', 'movies', ""'m"", 'torn', 'giving', 'overlookable', 'three', 'stars', 'promising', 'four', 'stars', 'even', 'levels', 'DTV', 'cinema', 'so', 'unevenly', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'had', 'actively', 'anticipated', 'see', 'fact', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'probably', 'raised', 'expectations', 'counterproductive', 'levels', 'rest', 'assured', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'strictly', 'terms', 'DTV', 'action', 'Oh', 'what', 'heck', 'have', 'four', 'stars', 'movie.The', 'story', 'when', 'young', 'call', 'girl', 'Samantha', 'Streets', 'Alien', 'Raiders', 'mysteriously', 'killed', 'only', 'friend', 'Jason', 'Yee', 'Dark', 'Assassin', 'must', 'untangle', 'deadly', 'urban', 'web', 'find', 'murderer.Be', 'aware', 'folks', 'basically', 'action-packed', 'neo', 'noir', 'flick', 'something', 'Citywithout', 'superhuman', 'characters', 'lot', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'pulled', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Yee', 'yards', 'ahead', 'Seagal', 'Statham', 'dramatic', 'action', 'hero', 'Samantha', 'Streets', 'mere', 'pretty', 'face', 'expectedly', 'good', 'performance', 'Gary', 'Stretch', 'Alexander', 'dirty', 'cop', 'amazingly', 'adept', 'portrayal', 'Ron', 'Yuan', 'Blood', 'Bone', 'pimp', 'pretty', 'good', 'ensemble', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'script', 'obviously', 'also', 'been', 'given', 'good', 'deal', 'attention', 'more', 'genuine', 'feature', 'nearly', 'ready', 'theatrical', 'release', 'typical', 'made-for-DVD', 'dreck', 'However', 'regardless', 'how', 'skillfully', 'drama', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'runtime', 'finale', 'disappoints', 'more', 'less', 'dropping', 'solution', 'mystery', 'lap', 'then', 'ending', 'sort', 'unenthusiastically', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'script', 'writers', 'including', 'Yee', 'ran', 'steam', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'ending', 'filmed', 'properly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'either', 'way.The', 'film', 'trailer', 'gave', 'impression', 'movie', 'action', 'content', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'could', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'true', 'most', 'part', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'choreographer', 'Ron', 'Yuan', 'work', 'ever', 'watchingAngel', 'Death', 'daresay', 'Naked', 'Eye', 'here', 'best', 'offering', 'date', 'Sadly', 'not', 'as', 'consistent', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'first', 'adrenaline', 'clout', 'series', 'brief', 'exchanges', 'expertly', 'showcase', 'Yuan', 'convincing', 'yet', 'liberal', 'style', 'vast', 'majority', 'fights', 'look', 'realistic', 'enough', 'actually', 'happen', 'skimping', 'impressive', 'kicks', 'few', 'minor', 'scuffles', 'here', 'there', 'keep', 'things', 'alive', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'club', 'brawl', 'thought', 'sure', 'movie', 'had', 'failed', 'action', 'content', 'when', 'Yee', 'two', 'battles', 'usually-amazing', 'Lateef', 'Crowder', 'Undisputed', 'III', 'Redemption', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'do', 'man', 'justice', 'then', 'film', 'threw', 'fastball', 'form', 'incredibly', 'pleasing', 'four-on-one', 'fight', 'hallway', 'filmed', 'single', 'shot', 'single', 'camera', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'fights', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.The', 'occasional', 'digital', 'backdrop', 'digital', 'blood', 'fights', 'give', 'impression', 'cheap', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'classier', 'most', 'things', 'market', 'similar', 'budget', 'swell', 'cinematography', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'Having', 'expected', 'neither', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations', 'outdid', 'others', 'just', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'competent', 'anticipated', 'good', 'chance', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'view', 'terms', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'general', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'leisurely', 'noir', 'aficionados', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'waiting', 'new', 'Jason', 'Yee', 'vehicle', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'entertained']",Girl From the Naked Eye
