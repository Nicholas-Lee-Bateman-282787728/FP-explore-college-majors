316512,A218A1NFBSHZ0U,6302503787,David B. Minter,"[6, 7]","One thing I wanted to note off the bat about this release.  The version of this WB VHS, dated 1992 on the copyright physically printed on the box, I viewed did not have complete closing credits.  I do not know if this common on all printings, but, on this one, the source material was not complete.  However, it was only missing part of the closing credits, and is far more complete than Disney and ABC airings which remove things like the entire Kubla Kraus musical number.Romeo Muller wrote the scripts for nearly all of the Rankin Bass stop motion animated holiday themed specials, as well as some other kids fare such as the Puff The Magic Dragon cartoons.  For Jack Frost, he combined two unrelated elements, the holiday of Groundhog's Day, with the idea of a spirit, Jack Frost, who helps to create the winter season.  While most would probably first think of Christmas when they hear of Jack Frost due to the holiday song, Muller successfully tacks on Groundhog's Day, providing an origin for that holiday.  A surprisingly complex story results.Muller's script focuses less on a story element, going from Point A to B and onwards to describe how X holiday came to be, and more on the emotional context.  While he completely satisfies the prerequisites for explaining how Groundhog's Day came to be by story's end, it is the internal character study that really stands out in this tale.  Jack Frost is a ""man"" who is known but never seen.  His actions are all he has to speak for himself: he helps Father Winter create winter.  In particular, as his name implies, the frosts that appear, but, he can also work with Winter and others to create the snows that fall.  He can never be just a simple man, because as he sings, it's lonely being one of a kind.  He is given a brief chance to be human, and tries to win the love of a woman who has always known him, even though she's never seen him.Jack's quest, though, is cut short when he decides to sacrifice his own chance at happiness, to give up being human, and regain his powers to save the town and the friends he has made in his brief time with them.  The ending is not a happy one, though, as Jack discovers that people can only love other people; his intended love has moved on beyond what was, basically, a fantasy infatuation.  Yet, she will never forget him, even though she never even knew he had visited her in real life.  Jack can only return to the task he has done ever since he can remember, and, apparently, will do for the rest of time.  While it hurts, it has to be enough for him, and, he eventually accepts it.This is one of the lesser known Rankin Bass stories.  While it will not achieve the status of a Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, it does not disappoint.  Each musical number is a charm, easily remembered, and easily repeated.  Two unexpected and unrelated source materials end up generating a highly recommended story with a strong emotional base.",4,Unexpected source materail provides a satisfying story.,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2931,"['One', 'thing', 'wanted', 'note', 'off', 'bat', 'release', 'version', 'WB', 'VHS', 'dated', '1992', 'copyright', 'physically', 'printed', 'box', 'viewed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'complete', 'closing', 'credits', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'common', 'printings', 'one', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'However', 'was', 'only', 'missing', 'part', 'closing', 'credits', 'far', 'more', 'complete', 'Disney', 'ABC', 'airings', 'remove', 'things', 'entire', 'Kubla', 'Kraus', 'musical', 'number.Romeo', 'Muller', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'nearly', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'stop', 'motion', 'animated', 'holiday', 'themed', 'specials', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'kids', 'fare', 'such', 'Puff', 'Magic', 'Dragon', 'cartoons', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'combined', 'two', 'unrelated', 'elements', 'holiday', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'idea', 'spirit', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'who', 'create', 'winter', 'season', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'first', 'think', 'Christmas', 'when', 'hear', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'due', 'holiday', 'song', 'Muller', 'successfully', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'providing', 'origin', 'holiday', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'story', 'results.Muller', 'script', 'less', 'story', 'element', 'going', 'Point', 'A', 'B', 'onwards', 'describe', 'how', 'X', 'holiday', 'came', 'be', 'more', 'emotional', 'context', 'completely', 'prerequisites', 'explaining', 'how', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'came', 'be', 'story', 'end', 'internal', 'character', 'study', 'really', 'out', 'tale', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'man', 'who', 'known', 'never', 'seen', 'actions', 'are', 'speak', 'Father', 'Winter', 'create', 'winter', 'particular', 'name', 'implies', 'frosts', 'appear', 'can', 'also', 'work', 'Winter', 'others', 'create', 'snows', 'fall', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'just', 'simple', 'man', 'lonely', 'being', 'one', 'kind', 'given', 'brief', 'chance', 'be', 'human', 'tries', 'win', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'known', 'even', 'never', 'seen', 'him.Jack', 'quest', 'though', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'chance', 'happiness', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'human', 'regain', 'powers', 'save', 'town', 'friends', 'made', 'brief', 'time', 'ending', 'not', 'happy', 'one', 'though', 'Jack', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'love', 'other', 'people', 'intended', 'love', 'moved', 'what', 'was', 'basically', 'fantasy', 'infatuation', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'even', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'visited', 'real', 'life', 'Jack', 'can', 'only', 'return', 'task', 'done', 'ever', 'can', 'remember', 'apparently', 'will', 'do', 'rest', 'time', 'be', 'enough', 'eventually', 'it.This', 'one', 'lesser', 'known', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'stories', 'will', 'not', 'achieve', 'status', 'Rudolph', 'Red-Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'not', 'disappoint', 'musical', 'number', 'charm', 'easily', 'remembered', 'easily', 'repeated', 'Two', 'unexpected', 'unrelated', 'source', 'materials', 'end', 'up', 'generating', 'highly', 'recommended', 'story', 'strong', 'emotional', 'base']",N/A

Shaken to the core, Jack - who doesn't really fit in with the less earthy winter sprites in charge of snow, sleet and hail but who also remains distant from the humans among whom he carries out his duties, realizes as if for the first time how lonely he really is.  He asks for - and is granted - a winter of humanity that may change to permanent status if he can earn his way in the world and win a wife by spring.  The gracefully awkward Jack is befriended by Elisa and her parents, all of whom he comes to love.Jack, however, has two strikes against him - a good-guy noble knight who turns Elisa's head and the evil Kubla Kraus, who forces Jack to make a heartwrenching but inevitable decision for the sake of his loved ones.This classic also has legs beyond Christmas, being appropriate anytime between first frost and Groundhog Day.",4,And now for something different...,1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,1300,"['bit', 'darker', 'average', 'Rankin/Bass', 'holiday', 'special', 'moving', 'entry', 'almost', 'there', 'Rudolph', 'Year', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'perhaps', 'most', 'beautiful', 'script', 'lot.Jack', 'gentle', 'personification', 'better', 'aspects', 'winter', 'going', 'business', 'when', 'Elisa', 'pretty', 'villager', 'January', 'Junction', 'trying', 'get', 'parents', 'stop', 'nagging', 'about', 'marriage', 'joke', ""'ll"", 'only', 'marry', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Shaken', 'core', 'Jack', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'less', 'earthy', 'winter', 'sprites', 'charge', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'who', 'also', 'distant', 'humans', 'whom', 'out', 'duties', 'first', 'time', 'how', 'lonely', 'really', 'granted', 'winter', 'humanity', 'may', 'change', 'permanent', 'status', 'can', 'earn', 'way', 'world', 'win', 'wife', 'spring', 'gracefully', 'awkward', 'Jack', 'befriended', 'Elisa', 'parents', 'whom', 'love.Jack', 'however', 'two', 'strikes', 'good-guy', 'noble', 'knight', 'who', 'Elisa', 'head', 'evil', 'Kubla', 'Kraus', 'who', 'Jack', 'make', 'heartwrenching', 'inevitable', 'decision', 'sake', 'loved', 'ones.This', 'classic', 'also', 'legs', 'Christmas', 'being', 'appropriate', 'anytime', 'first', 'frost', 'Groundhog', 'Day']",N/A

This is a Puppet-Mation which is the form of live-action puppetry done with stop motion animation. Where the sequences are shot one frame at a time. A long process and when completely brings these inanimate objects to life with song and dance.It's the story of Mr. Cold Chill himself - Jack Frost - who at one time actually became human. Why? Because he over hears that his one true love from affair claims that she loves him - but in a nature and imaginary sort of way. Because of this he speaks to Father Winter as is granted his request to remain human if he can find a House, Horse and a Wife.Kubla Krause - ""there's the rub"" is the one evil Kossack who keep him from marring Jack's Girl and defeating Sir. Ravinaw. The voice talents include Robert Morse (City Of Angeles) as Jack Frost, Debra Clinger (Midnight Madman) as girlfriend and the incredible multi talents and voices of character voice actor Paul Fries ( The Last Unicorn, The Hobbit).Did I mention this whole story is told from the perspective of a ground hog called Pardon-Me-Pete? He is the narrator of the whole film and is voiced by the incredible Buddy Hacket ( The Little Mermaid, Hey Babe)It would have been nice to add some commentary, behind the scenes stuff or some rough footage of the original production - but this is still a really good film for kids and adults.

He petitions Father Winter to grant him humanity and give him the chance to win her love.  The villain of the story is Kublah Krause, the Cossack King.  He gets the best song.  &quot;I'm Kublah Krause, I could have been a Shogun, but there are no Samurai around here, there's the rub, there's the rub...&quot;The only holiday represented is Groundhog's Day, and the Groundhog himself (voiced by Buddy Hackett) makes an appearance.  &quot;I've got a day named after me, February 2...&quot;  Other characters include Holly the Snow Gypsy and Snip the Snowflake Cutter.This DVD is a fairly frill-free production, and contains only the main feature.  It was produced for stores to put in their &quot;bargain DVD&quot; racks.  Still, the quality is great and there is no other DVD version of &quot;Jack Frost&quot; available.  A definite must-have for the holidays.",5,Who's that nipping at your nose?,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,1524,"['quot', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'quot', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'was', 'not', 'aired', 'as', 'often', 'quot', 'Rudolph', 'Rednose', 'Reindeer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'quot', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'special', 'was', 'more', 'treat', 'when', 'got', 'see', 'Also', 'had', 'knights', 'castles', 'steam-powered', 'horse', 'was', 'big', 'bonus', 'child.This', 'animagic', 'production', 'stop-motion', 'puppets', 'instead', 'cell', 'animation', 'story', 'winter-focused', 'rather', 'Christmas', 'focused', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'invisible', 'elf', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'participate', 'joy', 'humans', 'love', 'human', 'girl', 'Father', 'Winter', 'grant', 'humanity', 'give', 'chance', 'win', 'love', 'villain', 'story', 'Kublah', 'Krause', 'Cossack', 'King', 'best', 'song', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Kublah', 'Krause', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Shogun', 'are', 'Samurai', 'here', 'rub', 'rub', 'quot', 'only', 'holiday', 'represented', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Groundhog', 'voiced', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'appearance', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'day', 'named', 'February', '2', 'quot', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Holly', 'Snow', 'Gypsy', 'Snip', 'Snowflake', 'Cutter.This', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'frill-free', 'production', 'only', 'main', 'feature', 'was', 'produced', 'stores', 'put', 'quot', 'bargain', 'DVD', 'quot', 'racks', 'Still', 'quality', 'great', 'other', 'DVD', 'version', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'quot', 'available', 'definite', 'must-have', 'holidays']",N/A
