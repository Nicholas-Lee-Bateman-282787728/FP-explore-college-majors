1140359,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0013527IO,Amy Lynn,"[7, 8]","Sick Nurses is a story about a neglected hospital and 7 young nurses and a doctor who work there. It turns out the nurses and doctor are selling body parts of their dead patients on the black market. Soon one of the nurses threatens to blow the whistle and ends up murdered. The ghost of the woman then comes back and uses the nurses and doctors obsessions and fears to murder them with to exact revenge. The ghost is also forcing them to kill eachother to get revenge for her murder. The ghost can cause hallucinations, also manipulate their will.What I really loved about this movie is the way it was directed. The use of colors is exquisite. The way a bar bell floats in the air, the way the fan winds blow, the way the rain drips on the windows, and the way a clock pours blood will strike you as something new. Very creative, It is beautifully directed.This received lower ratings on some websites, Why? I don't know. It's a lot better than most of the Asian horror movies out today.There were some very strange killings in this. Very inventive and unlike anything you most likely have ever seen.Would I call it scary?  Not really. Would I call it unique?  Yes. It's a unique ghost story with inventive killings and haunts.

1140360,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B0013527IO,Anticlimacus,"[3, 5]","After killing one of their own, a group of organ-stealing nurses pay the consequences.  This is quite possibly the most entertaining Thai horror film ever made.  The characters are hyperbolized to the point where they are intrinsically interesting to watch (not to mention the fact that all of them are gorgeous Thai girls in scantily clad nurse uniforms) and they also add an element of black humor.  Even the ghost herself shatters genre cliches with her obvious sadism and enjoyment in reaping vengeance.  The main attractions, however, are the spectacular death scenes that arrive during the latter half.  These are highly imaginative with impressive quantities of blood, but are not very disturbing because they're so much fun to watch.  The nurse named Nook is one tough bitch who won't go down without a fight, and the one-on-one duel to the death between her and the ghost is an instant classic.  There are one or two scenes with poor CGI, but this is an extremely inventive horror film with frenetic pacing and excellent camerawork and lighting.  This is a horror film that's meant to be fun first and foremost - and it works.The other reviewers here seem to gloss over the fact that the ghost in this movie is NOT the cliched stereotype that pervades some of the Japanese and South Korean horror releases. After watching over 200 East Asian horror movies, I can tell you with 100% certainty that the ghost in Sick Nurses is instead a SATIRE of Japanese horror because she is unequivocally SADISTIC, reaping boatloads of pleasure with each and every kill. This is very different from the stereotype. The reviewers may be partially correct in pointing out that the antagonist is a woman ghost, but were completely wrong in asserting that the character is a cliche.Another obvious misstatement by these reviewers is that Sick Nurses is a superficial movie.  Sure, it's not as magnificent as A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) or as cerebral as Kairo (2001), but it does have quirky victims and good characterization in general because each obsession is exaggerated to the point where it becomes blackly comical. I know American moviegoers are typically too stupid to pick stuff like this up, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still there to be seen and enjoyed. Not every horror movie needs incredibly annoying, drug-addicted, sex-crazed teenagers as protagonists. For most viewers of mainstream Hollywood horror this little fact may be difficult to understand, I know, but there are other people that exist in this world.I'm probably the last person who would highly enjoy a slasher film (and yes, Sick Nurses is a ghost film that plays out like a slasher) because I prefer horror movies that are more dense with content (nothing from Hollywood obviously), but this movie has all the goods for a fun evening of death and destruction if you have enough brains to pick up on the satire and hyperbolized character traits.",4,I Strongly Disagree With the Other Reviewers Here,1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,2929,"['killing', 'one', 'own', 'group', 'organ-stealing', 'nurses', 'pay', 'consequences', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Thai', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'characters', 'are', 'hyperbolized', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'intrinsically', 'interesting', 'watch', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Thai', 'girls', 'scantily', 'clad', 'nurse', 'uniforms', 'also', 'add', 'element', 'black', 'humor', 'Even', 'ghost', 'shatters', 'genre', 'cliches', 'obvious', 'sadism', 'enjoyment', 'reaping', 'vengeance', 'main', 'attractions', 'however', 'are', 'spectacular', 'death', 'scenes', 'arrive', 'latter', 'half', 'are', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'impressive', 'quantities', 'blood', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'disturbing', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'nurse', 'named', 'Nook', 'one', 'tough', 'bitch', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'fight', 'one-on-one', 'duel', 'death', 'ghost', 'instant', 'classic', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'poor', 'CGI', 'extremely', 'inventive', 'horror', 'film', 'frenetic', 'pacing', 'excellent', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'horror', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'first', 'foremost', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'gloss', 'fact', 'ghost', 'movie', 'NOT', 'cliched', 'stereotype', 'Japanese', 'South', 'Korean', 'horror', 'releases', 'watching', '200', 'East', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'tell', '100', '%', 'certainty', 'ghost', 'Sick', 'Nurses', 'instead', 'SATIRE', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'unequivocally', 'SADISTIC', 'reaping', 'boatloads', 'pleasure', 'kill', 'very', 'different', 'stereotype', 'reviewers', 'may', 'be', 'partially', 'correct', 'pointing', 'out', 'antagonist', 'woman', 'ghost', 'were', 'completely', 'wrong', 'asserting', 'character', 'cliche.Another', 'obvious', 'misstatement', 'reviewers', 'Sick', 'Nurses', 'superficial', 'movie', 'Sure', 'not', 'as', 'magnificent', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', '2003', 'as', 'cerebral', 'Kairo', '2001', 'have', 'quirky', 'victims', 'good', 'characterization', 'general', 'obsession', 'exaggerated', 'point', 'where', 'blackly', 'comical', 'know', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'typically', 'too', 'stupid', 'pick', 'stuff', 'up', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'horror', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'drug-addicted', 'sex-crazed', 'teenagers', 'protagonists', 'most', 'viewers', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'little', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'know', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'exist', 'world.I', ""'m"", 'probably', 'last', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'highly', 'enjoy', 'slasher', 'film', 'yes', 'Sick', 'Nurses', 'ghost', 'film', 'out', 'slasher', 'prefer', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'dense', 'content', 'nothing', 'Hollywood', 'obviously', 'movie', 'goods', 'fun', 'evening', 'death', 'destruction', 'have', 'enough', 'brains', 'pick', 'up', 'satire', 'hyperbolized', 'character', 'traits']",Sick Nurses

It takes a little time for the blood and gore to come into the mix but when it does its truly a very bloody event. Theres a serious amount of blood and gore and its all done very well.

What's surprising about this one is that it originates in Thailand, which for years has been cranking out decidedly above-average horror films. Well, I guess everything has to come to an end sometime, and Southeast Asia's decades-long dominance in every aspect of horror film is starting to wear at the edges.Plot: underhanded dealings at a small hospital result in the ghost of one of the ill-treated patients coming back to haunt the staff responsible for her demise. Or so they think. Could there be a more mundane explanation for the killings?Yeah, that's it. Really, that's about as much plot as most recent Southeast Asian horror films have had, but what has always set them apart from the pack has been atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere. Where Laoyont and Siriwiat seem to have gone wrong was in assuming that one could simply shroud the entire movie in darkness and use that as an acceptable substitute for atmosphere; what it actually does is make everything still mediocre, but a lot harder to see. Which makes it a kind of tough sell when the big thing about your movie is that almost your entire cast is hot babes in skimpy nurse outfits. (Well, that and badly-CGIed death scenes, but you've got a while to go before you get to any of those.)It's silly, and it's not entirely terrible if you're in the mood for an Asian deathfest, but it's surprisingly tame.

1140371,A2D1F0HWHN4T1U,B0013527IO,Robert,"[7, 10]","I so rarely give one or five stars, but this movie really earned it. I struggled to finish it. The plot is reasonable enough. A nurse is murdered by a doctor and other nurses after threatening to reveal they were selling body parts from the deceased. When her own body parts are not claimed, she begins exacting revenge from those who killed her. Unfortunately, the tale is poorly executed, rambling from one unconnected scene to the next, with several hauntings leaving you to believe a nurse is dead, when her final moments are actually shown a half hour later. There are a few gory moments, but they often lack context or appear hurried. There is a feeling that the movie is a collection of random scenes, edited later to fit the plot. The cast of Asian nurses is an attractive one, but they present themselves like eye candy in a campy low budget American flick. The ghost, if you will, reminds one of the standard creepy Asian girl, with dark hair partially covering one eye, moving creepily. Unfortunately, this one is covered with dark grease paint, and has a habit of posing like a soap opera star waiting for the cheating boyfriend. This is particularly interesting because the ghost in the early part of the film is more vague and indistinct than what she becomes later in the second half. Just another example of a film that lacks any real coherence. It's as if it were directed by several different people, or at the very least, a few different personalities. There is a bit of a twist at the end, but it is by no means an adequate payoff for what you must suffer through to get there.",1,Viewer Beware,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1597,"['so', 'rarely', 'give', 'one', 'five', 'stars', 'movie', 'really', 'earned', 'struggled', 'finish', 'plot', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'nurse', 'murdered', 'doctor', 'other', 'nurses', 'threatening', 'reveal', 'were', 'selling', 'body', 'parts', 'deceased', 'When', 'own', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'not', 'claimed', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'who', 'killed', 'Unfortunately', 'tale', 'poorly', 'executed', 'rambling', 'one', 'unconnected', 'scene', 'next', 'several', 'hauntings', 'leaving', 'believe', 'nurse', 'dead', 'when', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'actually', 'shown', 'half', 'hour', 'later', 'are', 'few', 'gory', 'moments', 'often', 'lack', 'context', 'appear', 'hurried', 'feeling', 'movie', 'collection', 'random', 'scenes', 'edited', 'later', 'fit', 'plot', 'cast', 'Asian', 'nurses', 'attractive', 'one', 'present', 'eye', 'candy', 'campy', 'low', 'budget', 'American', 'flick', 'ghost', 'will', 'one', 'standard', 'creepy', 'Asian', 'girl', 'dark', 'hair', 'partially', 'covering', 'one', 'eye', 'moving', 'creepily', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'covered', 'dark', 'grease', 'paint', 'habit', 'posing', 'soap', 'opera', 'star', 'waiting', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'ghost', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'more', 'vague', 'indistinct', 'what', 'later', 'second', 'half', 'Just', 'example', 'film', 'real', 'coherence', 'were', 'directed', 'several', 'different', 'people', 'very', 'least', 'few', 'different', 'personalities', 'bit', 'twist', 'end', 'means', 'adequate', 'payoff', 'what', 'must', 'suffer', 'get', 'there']",Sick Nurses

Even with the cover art, it's still titillating.  It's anything but.  It is a well-crafted horror movie, with a good bit of humor thrown in.  It is the story of several nurses who are all enamored of one doctor (go figure!).  He seems to make promises to each and every one.  The one nurse he's supposed to be betrothed to is murdered because she caught him with her sister, and threatened to expose their side business of selling dead bodies.  The rest of the film encompasses her revenge as she seeks out each and every nurse involved with her death, saving her pregnant sister and ex-fiance for last.  The lead-up to the surprise ending is built around flashbacks the doctor indulges in as he continues to contemplate his upcoming nuptials.  Just think Crying Game.",4,The Title is Misleading,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,867,"['Somehow', 'title', 'Sick', 'Nurses', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'kind', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'Even', 'cover', 'art', 'still', 'titillating', 'anything', 'well-crafted', 'horror', 'movie', 'good', 'bit', 'humor', 'thrown', 'story', 'several', 'nurses', 'who', 'are', 'enamored', 'one', 'doctor', 'go', 'figure', 'make', 'promises', 'one', 'one', 'nurse', 'supposed', 'be', 'betrothed', 'murdered', 'caught', 'sister', 'threatened', 'expose', 'side', 'business', 'selling', 'dead', 'bodies', 'rest', 'film', 'revenge', 'out', 'nurse', 'involved', 'death', 'saving', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'ex-fiance', 'last', 'lead-up', 'surprise', 'ending', 'built', 'flashbacks', 'doctor', 'contemplate', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'Just', 'think', 'Crying', 'Game']",Sick Nurses
