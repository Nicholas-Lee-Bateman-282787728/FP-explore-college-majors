I was concerned with ordering that there would be something amiss with this set, but I was wrong. This is the complete series in a collectors box that holds all the individual DVD cases. Individually each season sells used for about $20, so I was amazed by this deal. I received this brand new yesterday, and started to enjoy one of my favorite shows from my childhood. Its really amazing to see the acting that was in TV shows from the 70s and 80s. Bill Bixby was an amazing actor, and his work on the TV adaptation of the Marvel comic series was one of the first screen successes for Marvel. Combine that with dramatic writing, and just a bit of cheesy action, and you have the recipe for a hit. Lou Ferrigno was perfect as the Hulk, as he was a mix of muscle and emotion. Whether he was smashing through a cardboard wall, or carrying someone to safety, you routed for the big green guy. Every kid wanted to be the Hulk. Don't look for big special effects, just enjoy a great show from the late 70s/ early 80s.  For a bit of nostalgia, and a fun time watching, this is a must for fans of the show and/or comics.

Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno are awesome team and I dont think they could have picked a better person than Lou for the Hulk.

Its too bad the show didn't take his career further.  Bill Bixby was great, too.  Even in the face of tragedy- the deaths of his ex-wife, and six year-old son in 1981, he still stayed with the show until its cancellation.I was also happy to get the entire series in a box set.  I wish all TV shows on DVD came that way.  It would save money and space in a TV room.The only thing I didn't particularly like about the show was David's quest to find a way to get rid of the Hulk.  In every episode, being the Hulk kept him from getting killed.  And, if David was such a notorious scientist, why didn't anyone recognize him when he went from place to place?  And, every time he turned into the Hulk, his clothes got ruined and he had to put on fresh ones when he changed back.  How did he fit all those clothes in that tiny bag he carried around with him?I saw an interview with Bill Bixby years ago, and he was asked if there was anything he disliked about the show. He said it was having to wear those white contact lenses because they were so uncomfortable.  I thought, Lou Ferrigno had to wear them longer than Bill Bixby did.I also believe that Ted Cassidy, the actor who narrarated the show's opener, and also did the Hulk's growling and roaring sounds, should have been identified in the show's closing credits as tha narrarator.

""Your Chicago So...","[5, 5]","The Incredible Hulk: The Complete SeriesFirst off, it's truly ""incredible"" to finally have this classic series in a full box set.  This series is what made the Marvel Comics character a household name.  It was also the star-making series for Bill Bixby, gaining him far more recognition from the public than any of his other series, combined.Great packaging, and the slim DVDs are nice.  The remastering of the 70s show is just spot-on.For the entire series, we have only two complaints.1) This box set does not feature the lenticular covers that the individual season box sets feature.  This is a disappointment for those who waited to buy the complete box set.  Those who waited did NOT get anything extra there for our patience.  This is especially problematic and disappointing for those who bought this set early on at full price.  As of this writing, the lowest price is $30, which is a VERY nice price for a new set.  Despite the nicer price tag for those who wait, the lack of the lenticular art is still a disappointment.  Yes, it costs a little more for the special disc cases, but it's something that should be considered for those fans who (like us!) were looking forward to them.2) Selection of commentary.  If you bought the ""Pilot""/Married"" disc with commentary, you will have already heard producer Kenneth Johnson's commentary.  So that is a disappointment there.  There are other discs with the same commentary, so why plug ""commentary"" on those particular episodes if there are ones with the same commentary elsewhere?  It's quite frustrating.  Speaking of frustrating, Kenneth Johnson makes repeated references to how much more effective the shots could have been had the ""morphing"" technology existed then, noting the ""Wolf Man"" style shots of the metamorphosis (as in, take a shot, cut, add more make-up, cut, et al).  Our opinion is that it is for that entire reason that the show is so memorable and quaint.  Yeah, there are lots of things that could be done different 30 years later, but the series would not be the same had it been done in 2000, as opposed to 1970.Also, as a special feature, they ""re-run"" the episodes, ""Stop The Presses"" and ""Homecoming"", which, while interesting episodes, what is the point of putting an episode as a special feature on a DVD box set, where you'll see it anyway?Back to commentary.  Prometheus is a GREAT episode to put additional commentary on.  The challenge of cutting back and forth from Bill Bixby to Ric Drasin and having to wear the ""white eyes"" contact lenses for most of the two-parter was terrific.  However, we would have liked to see commentary on ""The First"", discussing Harry Townes (Del Frye) and Dick Durock (Frye's Creature), and how they reacted to the contact lenses and the makeup and such, especially Townes, who was a frequent guest star on 60s television, and has a very distinctive voice.  We're sure fans would have loved to hear the genesis of such an episode.  Especially since this episode was included on the ""Ultimate Television Series Collection"" 6-disc box set.Aside from those two (admittedly minor) gripes, this is a superb box set and definitely worth it!

1185610,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B001ECDVH2,Taheen Lopez,"[7, 25]","This INCREDIBLE HULK-Complete Series sounds neat, since it contains every single episode from all 5 seasons throughout THE INCREDIBLE HULK's whole 1978-82 run on CBS, but since times are obviously tight right now and since Universal already has all 5 seasons released on DVD and already had the Hulk's 5th and final season released on DVD last Fall on the same day as this was released on DVD, I don't see why Universal felt it was necessary to make a complete series DVD of this Science-Fiction drama, especially in these tight economic times most people are struggling through the recession going on right now.Therefore, the only reason I can think of on why Universal decided to make this INCREDIBLE HULK-The Complete Series DVD was probably due to a major reason called MONEY! since businesses everywhere all over the country are seeing a decline in sales right now in todays depressing economy.Therefore, it's hard to purchase a complete series DVD that costs over a hundred simolians while everybody is feeling the hasty thrifty crunch right now while people all over the world are getting laid off left and right with all these hefty budget cuts that are wreaking havoc on the whole world right now.Therefore, most people are less likely to purchase a complete series DVD of this science-fiction show or any other show for that matter when people are and were able to buy each season on DVD one by one, which was way cheaper since each season was only under a hundred bucks apiece.The truth is, I'm considering on getting this complete series DVD of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, since I was a big fan of this show and used to watch it religiously every week on CBS during it's whole 4-year run, but it probably wont be for a while and hopefully this DVD will contain some genuine bonus features that we couldn't watch on any of the other INCREDIBLE HULK DVD's that were released season by season although I have a feeling this DVD is probably nothing more than a waste of money if you already have the whole DVD collection of THE INCREDIBLE HULK from Season 1 all the way through Season 5, but I don't understand why Universal felt it was necessary to make this complete series DVD box set since none of the individual season DVD box sets had any flaws or double sided discs that froze or skipped either since all 5 seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK came with single sided disc only as opposed to the double sided discs that froze and skipped on KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2, MIAMI VICE-SEASON 1, KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4, MIAMI VICE-SEASON 2, THE A-TEAM-SEASON 2, and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 4, which is probably why Universal doesn't make DVD box sets with 2-sided disks anymore and why they haven't done so in 3 years, but I don't think this THE INCREDIBLE HULK-The Complet Series DVD is to make up or compensate for any flaws made on the indididual season box sets that were released season by season one at a time between the Summer of 2006 and the Fall of 2008.It's just too bad that this science-fiction drama couldn't last longer and that THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th and last season had to be cut short, despite its high ratings, but unfortunately CBS cancelled this show abruptly in mid November of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS along with the fact that the special effects on the show got too expensive especially for the Hulk-out scenes, due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency.Therefore CBS had uncerimoniously announced in July of 1981 when its 5th Season was underway that they were cancelling THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Fall of 1981 even though the ratings were still going strong, so creator(Ken Johnson)had to compromise with CBS by making the Hulk's Fifth Season only half a season with only 7 episodes, which was why CBS had cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden on such short notice in November of 1981 along with the fact that the president at CBS at the time(Harve Shepherd) felt that the Hulk was getting tired and that this science-fiction drama was running out of steam along with the fact that rumor has it that both Bill Bixby(David Banner) and Lou Ferrigno(The Hulk)found it difficult to work with Ken Johnson and that Johnson could never come up with a suitable budget with CBS to keep running this show either, which left Hulk fans being and feeling cheated since nobdy knew that THE INCREDIBLE HULK was going to be axed when it was, but CBS had brought the show back on the air temporarily in the Spring of 1982 for about 2 weeks to finish off the remaining 2 episodes of THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th and last season, which were the ""Slaves"" episode and the ""A Minor Problem"" episode, yet CBS still didn't have a series finally episode proving to us once again that the recluse David(Bill Bixby)still hadn't found a cure for his struggling ordeal with the Hulk and that the Hulk was still being tracked by the persistent obsessed newspaper reporter Jack McGee(Jack Colvin), but what I don't understand is why was McGee no where to be found in THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season, but still had his name on the credits and introduction to THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 1981-82 Season as the investigative reporter pursuing the Hulk, yet McGee barely only came out on 1 episode in the Hulk's Fifth Season, which was the ""Triangle"" episode only, which was the last episode shown before this science-fiction drama was cancelled all of the sudden in the mid Fall of 1981 after the ""Triangle"" episode was shown on its original air-date which was Friday November 13th, 1981.Therefore, this shows sudden cancellation was very similar to when CBS abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in the early Fall of 1979 since the last 2 episodes of WONDER WOMAN ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" & ""The Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" led us to beleive that CBS was kicking off a 4th Season of WONDER WOMAN before CBS cancelled WONDER WOMAN all of the sudden in mid September of 1979 when THE INCREDIBLE HULK had kicked off its 3rd Season on CBS.Therefore, chances are CBS already had plans in the Summer of 1979 underway to cancel WONDER WOMAN in the Autumn of 1979 just like CBS already had plans to cancel THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Autumn of 1981 when the Hulks 5th Season was already in the works with 7 episodes already in the can which contributed to THE INCREDIBLE HULKs 1981-82 Season being an abbreviated season, except WONDER WOMAN had no 4th Season or even half a season before WONDER WOMAN was axed after showing its very last episode on Tuesday September 11th, 1979.",4,Just Another Gag!,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,6521,"['INCREDIBLE', 'HULK-Complete', 'Series', 'neat', 'single', 'episode', '5', 'seasons', 'THE',

After reading several customer reviews complaining about the size of the box, I was expecting it to be enormous. However, it's only 11 and one quarter inches long, 8 inches wide and 2 and three quarter inches deep. The size is just fine with me and the box is attractive and very sturdy. I do agree with other reviewers that the DVD cases could be packaged better within the box. It's awkward if you want to remove a particular case. The extras are quite interesting and though I've only watched brief snippets of several episodes, the video quality is very good for the most part, though there are some segments that call for remastering. My biggest complaint is the lack of an episode guide that gives the original airdate of each episode. There is no booklet nor are the airdates listed on the DVD cases. I wonder if a booklet comes with the box set and it was left out of my set by mistake.
