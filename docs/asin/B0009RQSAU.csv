With Japanese and English options, this anime about the Paper Sisters is a great addition to collectors.

Forget about it.Simply one of the best series on television, R.O.D. the TV delivers in character originality, character depth, excellent voice acting, memorable scenes, awesome action sequences, enough deep thinking to make adults appreciate this series, and happens to be downright creative in almost every way!It should be noted that this series is mistakenly called ""Read or Die the TV"" which it is not, it is ""R.O.D. the TV"" a spin off from the novel series which started the OVA Read or Die which ended up branching off both this series for the American audience and Read or Dream, a manga series (a new series I hear is in the works as I write this. This is an important distinction to make because the story arc which this series follows is extremely different from the original Read or Die novels as well as the Read or Dream mangas.So what can you expect with R.O.D. the TV? Plot twists, librarians, book store owners, evil corporations all of which is tied together with magical powers to manipulate paper and also manages to resurrect some loveable characters from the ""Read or Die"" movie (the OVA for which the series was based on). Slow moving and yet depressingly so as was the case in my opinion with Witch Hunter Robin, R.O.D. the TV will have you hooked in no time with some of the best character development and original story seen thus far in anime!Truly a wonderful production... though I'd suggest you rent the OVA and then the first couple of DVDs before buying it to make sure you'll love it just as much as some of the other die hard fans out there!

911215,A1U11PS71ML0YJ,B0009RQSAU,"Derrick Jenkins ""love of Gaming/Movies/Anime/...","[0, 0]",I figured that an anime centered around books would really keep me interested and even though R.O.D starts off kind of slowly.  It more than makes up for that with the interesting effects and attacks that the Paper Sisters use in their various adventures whether its protecting author Nenene from her stalker fans or looking for her best friend who's gone off missing for the past few years.  That storyline leads down the whole road of the series as a whole.  I dont want to give away much but it really picks around that point with various characters good/bad and some mixed in between that you arent quite sure about.But this series is one that requires patience and rewards you for said patience so take a trip in this excellent anime series featuring the Paper Sisters...Read or Die might even make you wanna pick up a book after your done with this series that clocks in at 26 episodes.  If that doesnt happen its cool you'll still enjoy the time invested in following this one through until the end.Love it!!Read or Die (Complete Collection) gets as close to a 5 out of 5 as possible.,5,Pleasant surprise,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1091,"['figured', 'anime', 'centered', 'books', 'would', 'really', 'keep', 'interested', 'even', 'R.O.D', 'kind', 'slowly', 'more', 'up', 'interesting', 'effects', 'attacks', 'Paper', 'Sisters', 'use', 'various', 'adventures', 'protecting', 'author', 'Nenene', 'stalker', 'fans', 'looking', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'missing', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'storyline', 'down', 'whole', 'road', 'series', 'whole', 'dont', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'really', 'around', 'point', 'various', 'characters', 'good/bad', 'mixed', 'arent', 'quite', 'sure', 'about.But', 'series', 'one', 'patience', 'rewards', 'said', 'patience', 'so', 'take', 'trip', 'excellent', 'anime', 'series', 'featuring', 'Paper', 'Sisters', 'Read', 'Die', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'wan', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'done', 'series', '26', 'episodes', 'happen', 'cool', ""'ll"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'time', 'invested', 'following', 'one', 'end.Love', 'Read', 'Die', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'as', 'close', '5', '5', 'possible']",N/A

There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll try to be inventive.This show is good.  Some people will say it has some slow episodes, and it does, but I like them.  They develope the characters and give you an idea of who these people are that you're supposed to be caring about.  And it does a good job of that.  Then the action and plot gets going and you won't want to stop watching.  There's conspiracies and secret plots and information control and evil empires, all on the subject of books and the crazy Brit, Mr. Joker (Joseph Carpenter, though no one calls him that).  But you already knew that.The action is good when it's around, which is often enough, but the show isn't about a group of super-warriors fighting progressively stronger bad guys until they fight the ""big boss"" to save the world--nothing that trite.  There's genuine intrigue and plot and suspense and you'll love every minute of it.I whole-heartedly recommend the show, but don't even spend upwards of a hundred dollars on the set.  That's rediculous.  I got it in a three-disc set on eBay for about thirty dollars.  It may have been a bootleg of some kind--I don't know, it looks real enough--but it's surely a bargain.  There's no reason to split this whole series into seven discs when you can do it on three.Other than that, this show is great.  And that one negative comment, which doesn't even have to do with the show itself, is all I've got.  I haven't seen the OVA (R.O.D. - Read or Die) yet, but I plan to very soon.  I do know, however, that you don't need to see the OVA to enjoy the series, which is a good thing.  But after seeing the series you'll most likely want to get the OVA, like I do.",5,One of my Favorites,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,1779,"['when', 'say', 'one', 'favorites', 'mean', 'darn', 'top', 'list', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'inventive.This', 'show', 'good', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'slow', 'episodes', 'like', 'develope', 'characters', 'give', 'idea', 'who', 'people', 'are', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'caring', 'good', 'job', 'Then', 'action', 'plot', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'conspiracies', 'secret', 'plots', 'information', 'control', 'evil', 'empires', 'subject', 'books', 'crazy', 'Brit', 'Mr.', 'Joker', 'Joseph', 'Carpenter', 'one', 'already', 'knew', 'that.The', 'action', 'good', 'when', 'often', 'enough', 'show', ""n't"", 'group', 'super-warriors', 'fighting', 'progressively', 'stronger', 'bad', 'guys', 'fight', 'big', 'boss', 'save', 'world', 'nothing', 'trite', 'genuine', 'intrigue', 'plot', 'suspense', ""'ll"", 'love', 'minute', 'it.I', 'whole-heartedly', 'recommend', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'spend', 'upwards', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'set', 'rediculous', 'got', 'three-disc', 'set', 'eBay', 'thirty', 'dollars', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bootleg', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'enough', 'surely', 'bargain', 'reason', 'split', 'whole', 'series', 'seven', 'discs', 'when', 'can', 'do', 'three.Other', 'show', 'great', 'one', 'negative', 'comment', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'do', 'show', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'OVA', 'R.O.D', 'Read', 'Die', 'yet', 'plan', 'very', 'soon', 'do', 'know', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'OVA', 'enjoy', 'series', 'good', 'thing', 'seeing', 'series', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'want', 'get', 'OVA', 'do']",N/A

It's also rather pricey.But it is well worth it. The storyline is long and complex, and sometimes moves at a glacial pace, but i always found myself watching 'one more episode'. The plot revolves around a young female Japanese (where have we seen THAT before?!) writer, named Nenene and her imposing 'bodyguards', 3, 'papermasters' who can manipulate paper to their wills. While protecting Nenene, the gang uncovers a much deeper plot by the 'British Library' to impose a new world order (like we have never seen that before either. Being a historian, and a book reader, i found it interesting, and entertaining. I also found it amusing that Japanese amine writes still seem to have an affliction with getting back at the US & UK as evidenced by some downright childish scenes regarding the US president. It's also amusing how they seem fixated on sinking the US Navy. In both this series, and the single disc OVA, an entire US carrier task force is sent to the bottom, something which the IJN was painfully never able to do in WW2. But i digress. Try to find it at a decent price.

""geek hipster""","[0, 0]","*IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT THIS SET IS DISCONTINUED*This is a series I watch again and again.Nenene Sumerigawa (close personal friend of Yomiko Readman from the ROD movie) is in Japan trying to write her new book after a long period of writers block.  Controversy surrounding her new work has led to attempts on her life, and she is put under the care of three bodyguards; Michelle, Maggie and Anita.. the Paper Sisters.  The story progresses from comic escapades and about midway thru (slight spoiler) arcs rather suddenly (though not jarringly) into a huge end of the world as we know it conspiracy story.. relating back to the first movie.This series has what I would call a wonderful softness to it.  There's alot of material here that's genuinely touching, beautiful use of color, and Taku Iwasaki's score is nostalgic genius. While the original ROD movie was more of a globe-trotting action packed fantasy spy story.. this series is really rooted in the bond these 4 women have for one another. The confusing story elements never overwhelm that aspect, which I admire this series for. Versimiltude- there's an emotional truthfulness here that really wowed me.  I found myself instantly bonded to them and had to watch the whole thing in about 2 days.It doesn't hurt to watch the original movie, as certain characters re-appear, making the action a little more obvious near the end, but I don't think it's totally necessary.  Having watched the show first, I found the film rather thin in story and emotion.My only complaint is it wasn't released in a widescreen format, that imo wouldve been perfect.Also, FYI, it's not a terribly violent show, doesn't use much profanity..

Each episode is generally a stand alone story and these vary from moderately interesting to extremely well written.
