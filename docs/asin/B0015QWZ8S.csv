1150557,A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ,B0015QWZ8S,"Alan Starr ""www.alanstarr.com""","[0, 1]","A surprisingly enjoyable season. Let's face it, this series really should have run its course by now. How many near-deaths can Jack survive? How many government conspiracies can there be?Yes, there are a few times that it's a bit preposterous (i.e. the storming of the White House???). But complaining about such things is like complaining that water is wet - you knew that going in, so why are you surprised?The first 5-6 episodes were my favorites, as it had a ""let's put the band back together"" feeling. ""Looks, there's Jack!"" ""And Bill and Chloe!"" ""And Tony! - hey, isn't he dead?"" The middle bogged down a bit, especially with the aforementioned WH scenes, but then the last 4-5 episodes really picked back up. The best part of '24' is guessing who the traitors are, and who's on the up-and-up. They did a good job of camouflaging the bad guy(s), and it came as a shock even to me when the turnabout was played. Cool!Basically, if you like the show, then you'll like Season 7, it an above average version of the same things you've seen since 2001. And if you don't like the show, then this won't convert you (but then again, nothing probably will).",4,Best season in a while,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1153,"['surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'Let', 'face', 'series', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'now', 'How', 'many', 'near-deaths', 'can', 'Jack', 'survive', 'How', 'many', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'bit', 'preposterous', 'i.e', 'storming', 'White', 'House', 'complaining', 'such', 'things', 'complaining', 'water', 'wet', 'knew', 'going', 'why', 'are', 'surprised', 'first', '5-6', 'episodes', 'were', 'favorites', 'had', 'let', 'put', 'band', 'back', 'together', 'feeling', 'Looks', 'Jack', 'Bill', 'Chloe', 'Tony', 'hey', ""n't"", 'dead', 'middle', 'bogged', 'down', 'bit', 'especially', 'aforementioned', 'WH', 'scenes', 'then', 'last', '4-5', 'episodes', 'really', 'picked', 'back', 'up', 'best', 'part', ""'24"", 'guessing', 'who', 'traitors', 'are', 'who', 'up-and-up', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'camouflaging', 'bad', 'guy', 's', 'came', 'shock', 'even', 'when', 'turnabout', 'was', 'played', 'Cool', 'Basically', 'like', 'show', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Season', '7', 'above', 'average', 'version', 'same', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2001', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'convert', 'then', 'again', 'nothing', 'probably', 'will']",N/A

I realized the Bauer character was pretty preposterous but I didn't care.  I needed the absurd escapism.  This time was when I was going through severe chemotherapy for cancer and was a number of seasons ago.  To put it mildly, I could not deal with anything (else) very weighty.  I've been well now for awhile and have been able to move back into weightier matter while still enjoying escapist fare.  However, I hit a brick wall with this season of 24.  The whole idea of Jack Bauer being this perfect patriot who is going to save the entire country in the next 24 hours is just too much.  Watching him use his cell phone EVERYWHERE to save the country is yet another element which has grown and grown and is now almost a satire within a satire.  Also, there is nothing that Jack cannot do. You need a plane flown?  Jack can do it.  Any kind of plane. You need someone to bear up under inhuman torture?  Piece of cake for Jack.  You need for other characters to die while Jack remains impregnable?  Just about everyone but Jack is always killed off in this series.  Some come back to life but most don't. In fact, I have come to miss Kiefer Sutherland playing the villain in movies because I am so tired of straight arrow Jack.  I am thinking of where he played the villain in FREEWAY with Reese Witherspoon and he was fabulous.  That deep voice of his is perfect for villainous roles. Finally, I miss the earliest seasons of 24 where we had some characters who were not stick figures who are all black or white.

After 2 years of writers strikes, Kiefer getting locked up and other delays, we finally get a new season.  You would think in that time the writers could come up with some good material.  Boy was I wrong.Moving the show to Washington DC was a good change of scenery...if only they had kept it in DC.  FYI, there is no such as thing as the Port of Alexandria.  The nearest port capable of handling those shipping containers is Baltimore.  Minor point I know and I'm sure a lot of LA residents had similar points about seasons 1-6.As for the plot.  It had promise to start with.  Bauer brought back to get preached to by holier-than-thou Senators about his behavior with the now disbanded CTU.  Then there is a terrorist threat (surprise).  Bauer gets called to the FBI to be an expert because Tony Almedia (back from the dead) is apparently behind it!!!  Shock!...yeah I totally didn't buy that.So Bauer teams up with Agent Walker who is at a fork in the road...does she follow Bauer into the ""at any cost"" way of preventing terrorists or does she follow the laws that may hinder the investigation?  It was a nice reflection of what is going on in the country right now.That's really where my praise for the season ends.  Spoilers ahead.The plot twists...saw them coming a mile away.  Why?  They've all been done before and they were so set up that there was no surprise.  Especially Tony's multiple plot twists.  Totally unbelieveable, even for 24.The First Dude's plotline for the first half of the season...really didn't care.  That doesn't make me cold, it just added nothing to the season.The attack on the White House?  Yeah....uh huh.  I'm all for suspending reality to watch 24 but when its so over the top that we're in a totally different dimension, you've lost my interest.And we had another season where the real bad guys are evil white American guys trying to control the nation.  Its time to get off this conspiracy stuff.  Seasons 1 and 4 were the only seasons when it was dedicated counterterrorism instead of unraveling a giant conspiracy.There was also a noticable lack of action in this season.  There were maybe 3-4 firefights?  They had the opportunity to have so much more action but failed.  This is 24, not a soap opera...enough of the ""will she/won't she"" on whether Agent Walker will go with Jack.  Enough of the teary-eyed moments of self-reflection.Hopefully, Season 8 will have Jack Bauer interrogating the writers for Season 7 so he can learn the location of the real writers and he'll go rescue them in time for Season 9.If it weren't for Jon Voight's acting and Agent Walker, it would have gotten 1 star.",2,Worst Season of 24,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,2670,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'season', '2', 'years', 'writers', 'strikes', 'Kiefer', 'getting', 'locked', 'up', 'other', 'delays', 'finally', 'get', 'new', 'season', 'would', 'think', 'time', 'writers', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'material', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong.Moving', 'show', 'Washington', 'DC', 'was', 'good', 'change', 'scenery', 'only', 'had', 'kept', 'DC', 'FYI', 'such', 'thing', 'Port', 'Alexandria', 'nearest', 'port', 'capable', 'handling', 'shipping', 'containers', 'Baltimore', 'Minor', 'point', 'know', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'LA', 'residents', 'had', 'similar', 'points', 'seasons', '1-6.As', 'plot', 'had', 'promise', 'start', 'Bauer', 'brought', 'back', 'get', 'preached', 'holier-than-thou', 'Senators', 'behavior', 'now', 'disbanded', 'CTU', 'Then', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'surprise', 'Bauer', 'called', 'FBI', 'be', 'expert', 'Tony', 'Almedia', 'back', 'dead', 'apparently', 'Shock', 'yeah', 'totally', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'that.So', 'Bauer', 'teams', 'up', 'Agent', 'Walker', 'who', 'fork', 'road', 'follow', 'Bauer', 'cost', 'way', 'preventing', 'terrorists', 'follow', 'laws', 'may', 'hinder', 'investigation', 'was', 'nice', 'reflection', 'what', 'going', 'country', 'right', 'now.That', 'really', 'where', 'praise', 'season', 'Spoilers', 'ahead.The', 'plot', 'twists', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'were', 'so', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'surprise', 'Especially', 'Tony', 'multiple', 'plot', 'twists', 'Totally', 'unbelieveable', 'even', '24.The', 'First', 'Dude', 'plotline', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', ""n't"", 'make', 'cold', 'just', 'added', 'nothing', 'season.The', 'attack', 'White', 'House', 'Yeah', '.uh', 'huh', ""'m"", 'suspending', 'reality', 'watch', '24', 'when', 'so', 'top', ""'re"", 'totally', 'different', 'dimension', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'interest.And', 'had', 'season', 'where', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'evil', 'white', 'American', 'guys', 'trying', 'control', 'nation', 'time', 'get', 'off', 'conspiracy', 'stuff', 'Seasons', '1', '4', 'were', 'only', 'seasons', 'when', 'was', 'dedicated', 'counterterrorism', 'instead', 'unraveling', 'giant', 'conspiracy.There', 'was', 'also', 'noticable', 'lack', 'action', 'season', 'were', 'maybe', '3-4', 'firefights', 'had', 'opportunity', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'failed', '24', 'not', 'soap', 'opera', 'enough', 'will', 'she/wo', ""n't"", 'Agent', 'Walker', 'will', 'go', 'Jack', 'Enough', 'teary-eyed', 'moments', 'self-reflection.Hopefully', 'Season', '8', 'will', 'have', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'interrogating', 'writers', 'Season', '7', 'can', 'learn', 'location', 'real', 'writers', ""'ll"", 'go', 'rescue', 'time', 'Season', '9.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'Jon', 'Voight', 'acting', 'Agent', 'Walker', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', '1', 'star']",N/A

1150592,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0015QWZ8S,Dave. K,"[1, 2]","24 SEASON 7****  Out of 5Premiere Date- January 11th, 2009Starring- Kiefer Sutherland, Cherry Jones, Annie Wersching, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Bob Gunton, Jeffrey Nordling, Colm Feore, James Morrison, Janeane Garofalo and Carlos Bernard as Tony AlmeidaWhile the 7th season of 24 may not be as strong as the first 5 seasons it did make for a semi return to grace after a some what lackluster season 6. While I don't think season 6 was as terrible as some make it out to be, but quite honestly the 6th of season 24 was hardly what it once was. We had some plots that in the end went nowhere and they never quite seemed to find their groove. Fans were disappointed and voiced their opinions, which forced the writers to step up. They have admitted that season 6 wasn't fully planned out and a lot of ideas were thought of during the season and it's quite obvious it wasn't fully planned.But season 7 of 24 made for a nice return for the show and while it does lack compared to the first 5 seasons when all was said and done 24 once again showed why many people consider it the most suspenseful and intense show on TV. What helped make 24 such a terrific show also sort of led to their downfall. After the 3rd season a lot of the characters weren't brought back for the 4th season and others would later come back during the season, which actually worked. We had new interesting characters and the fan favorites also came back.Season 5 was pretty much the same way only this time the fan favorites were killed off, which worked since we didn't know what would happen next. Plus the new characters were excellent, but with the deaths of many characters and the twists taken with others in the 5th season the 6th season had a lot of new faces and this time it didn't work. The new characters were boring and the ones that did return were getting stale and barley added to the plot. Many people including myself consider season 5 to be the best and I think that is also why season 6 gets so much heat due to fan expectations. So after season 6 I still liked the show enough to come back, but I didn't have the excitement I once did and I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of the 7th season.It's impossible to really explain the plot since so much happens over the course of the season and it would be impossible to explain without giving away spoilers. So I'll give a review without going into too much detail to keep this spoiler free.CTU has been dismantled and we now move from Los Angeles where the first 6 seasons were set and now we head off to DC. But the basic plot has Jack Bauer (Sutherland) getting ready to stand trial for the methods he's used on terrorists to get the job done, while working for CTU, but before things can get going the FBI pulls Bauer out of court to help prevent a pending terrorist attack on DC, which is being led by the thought to be dead former CTU Agent Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard). But of course things aren't always what they seem and what ensues is one of the craziest days Jack Bauer has ever gone through.The 7th season of 24 got off to a really fast start and it seemed like the 24 we came to know and love was back. Due to fan backlash over the sub par season 6 the writers knew they had to step up their game and Tony Almeida who was killed off in season 5 is now back and I can't help, but think it was due to fan backlash. Fans refused to accept it and I've never seen such an outcry over a characters death like this. So now we have Tony back and without spoiling anything this isn't the same Tony Almeida; he has more of an edge and sometimes you don't quite know what to make of him and over the course of the day many twists and turns come about with Tony. The explanation of how Tony survived is a bit out there, but works if you don't put too much thought into it.As I stated 24 got off to a solid start with the first 2 episodes, but it started to slightly slump after a hot start. The problem wasn't that it was poorly written, but more of it's a show that is getting up their in age and there is only so far you can take any show and looking back on season 6 there was some poor writing, but it was more of a show just getting old and thus getting stale; The Shield is one of the only shows that stayed just as fresh and well written in the end as it was in the beginning. 24 was just getting old and situations that worked in the past just felt a bit stale. But after the hot start things cooled down and it seemed 24 was just getting too old.The problems early on were certain subplots like Henry Taylor (Colm Feore) investigating the death of his son. The plot just never really worked and it often slowed down the show and more importantly it just wasn't very interesting. Henry's wife President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) made for a very excellent character, but her plot just wasn't working and as the season went on her plot picked up, but we've seen this before with past Presidents on this show, but I did find myself starting to enjoy storyline as the season went on clich&eacute;d or not it got more interesting. As for Henry Taylor his plot comes to an end around the 8th episode, which was the wise move since it often slowed the pacing down. That's not to say the plot was bad, but it just never fully worked either, but it did provide a few jolts at least. And as I said before President Taylor's plot while a bit of a rehash of past plots starts off slow and while never really epic it does begin to work well mid way through the season.We also have the possible mole in the FBI just like we had almost every season when the show was set at CTU. This plot point at this time in the series is quite tiresome and it shouldn't be too hard for viewers to figure out the identity of the mole. The plot wasn't bad or anything and added some decent suspense, but its something 24 has done far too many times and at this point in the series again it's quite tiresome. While it worked I suppose, but it was just tiresome.The turning point of the season was episode 12 7:00PM-8:00PM along with the very next episode, which were two of the very best episodes 24 has ever produced and that showed me there is still a lot of life left in this show. I don't wanna give any details of the episode, but these two were classic 24 (just suspend your disbelief) these two episodes were the classic edge of your seat 24 has done many times in the past and after that the season was back off and running. After that 24 got back to being one of the best shows on TV and while it may not be as good as the first 5 seasons it still made for some great TV and the final 4 episodes are among the strongest of the series. The first half of 24 was alright; again it wasn't poorly written, but just a bit stale, but the 2nd half of the season was amazing and 24 still has plenty of life left in it. The final half of the season I would say was classic 24.The high points of the season were some of the new cast members; unlike season 6 this season had some truly great characters. The best of the new additions was FBI Agent Renee Walker played by Annie Wersching who along the way channels her inner Jack Bauer. Jeffrey Nordling as FBI Agent Larry Moss was another great character who often stood in Jack's way (think along the lines of George Mason and Ryan Chappelle only not as much of a pain as they were). But as the season goes on Moss becomes more and more likeable, but still can be a pain at times, but made for a great character, which again was lacking in the 6th season.  My only complaint about the 2nd half of the season is too many episodes Jack just sort of sits around and this show now revolves around Jack and having him sit out of missions doesn't work. Unlike last season, this time there are solid characters so it makes up for it a bit, but Jack is too Iconic and must always be center stage at least this late into the series.Returning to the show besides Jack and Tony were Carlo Rota as Morris O'Brian, but he plays a very minor role; Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub) and former CTU director Bill Buchanan (James Morrison). Chloe was a bit under used this year and never really had much of an impact like past seasons and she goes MIA for several episodes and again Chloe never really had much of an impact when she came back and seemed to be there because she is a fan favorite, but Bill was given more to do and he's just as likeable as he was in the past. Bill is hands down one of my favorite characters of the series and he has a truly classic moment in episode 13.Elisha Cuthbert makes her return as Jack's daughter, Kim and this time around her character isn't nearly as annoying as she was in the past and while her storyline was typical Kim Bauer this time it added to the show rather than slowing it down and I actually found myself interested in her plot where as in the past she was just eye candy. Also returning is fan favorite Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower) last seen briefly in season 6. Good news is Aaron plays a nice sized role sort of like in season 5.Jon Voight guest stars on quite a few episodes as Jonas Hodges one of the main villains, but in typical 24 fashion there is always a higher power. Voight is solid in the role viewers will most likely respond well to the character and count down the hours until Jack gets hold of him. But the Hodges character was a slight rehash of some of the motives for characters back in season 2, but it still works well here.I would have to go back and view the season again to give it a much more accurate review. Sometimes you have episodes that were decent, but they are there to add to what's coming and when you see it the 2nd time now knowing what will come about you have a new appreciation for the episode now. As much as I loved the first 5 seasons and would count down the days until the next episode aired I've liked each and every season more the 2nd time around.Most viewers I'm sure will be most invested in what the deal with Tony is and the character takes a lot of twists and turns over the course of the day and without any spoilers this isn't the same Tony Almeida and by the end of the day his motivations are made quite clear (viewers should be able to put two and two together before hand though). I think all viewers though will be sympathetic with Tony and even if it's a bit out there he's still alive his plot actually works well and delivers some tense moments and it was great having him back since Carlos Bernard is a terrific actor.Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer obviously takes center stage and once again proves why he's one of the best actors working today. Sutherland, 7 seasons in is still giving it his all as the troubled Jack Bauer who is in for yet another day from hell. Annie Wersching though was the scene stealer and deserves a lot of credit for her performance. But Carlos Bernard as Tony was the stand out star of the season; while Carlos was great on the show in the past this season he is allowed to really show off his talents and the finale he delivers a brilliant and powerful performance.Again the 7th season of 24 may not be as strong as the first 5 seasons, but it was a major improvement over season 6 and when all is said and done the 7th season of 24 was a nice semi return. 24 is getting older and it's showing its age, but the writers were still able to deliver an action packed and tense season. This season took a little longer to fully take off, but once it does 24 once again provides some brilliant and classic moments and the final stretch are some of the best episodes of the series.As for the Blu-ray release; the extras are the same as the DVD and are fairly decent. But what makes this release stand out is the picture and sound quality. The Blu-ray is easily one of the bests I have ever seen; the picture is sharp and simply amazing and the sound is mind blowing. The sound is so good that even if you don't have extra hook ups for your system this still sounds great and it's even better with extra hook ups, but the sound quality is awesome; Even if the features are decent the sound and picture quality more than makes up for it.",5,After a lackluster season 6.

The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.

This isn't a real problem when this single day is stretched over 24 episodes, shown one a week on TV, for 5 or 6 months. But on DVD, when most of us watch two or three episodes a night during the course of a week or so, the preposterous succession of cataclysmic events, of the kind that most of us would be unlucky to witness in a lifetime, one after the other, reduces everything to the level of total and unbelievable farce.In this season, for example, we have the White House attacked and bombs going off inside the building, loads of people gunned down, and rooms and walls and furniture etc destroyed or sprayed with bullets... and yet, barely two hours later, there is no evidence of this whatsoever, and life goes on in a pristine, undamaged White House as if nothing has happened at all!One of the bonus features on Disc 6 shows the writers discussing the various problems of tailoring stories to the strait jacket of the 24 hour 'real time'format, with one guy saying they did consider having a 'time gap' between each event, like fast forwarding to three weeks later, for example. Sadly, this was dismissed as it might upset the 24 'purist' fans. To me this was a big mistake and might have freed them up to deliver more credible storylines with a bit more character development, for example.Still, all this is moot now, as I gather Season 8 has just ended and it was the last they're doing. Daft as 24 was, you can't deny it was entertaining and had some money spent on it, and Jack Bauer is a great character... that's why I can grudgingly give Season 7 one star. It loses the other 4 for bringing back really annoying bit part characters from earlier seasons for no reason whatsoever, and for all the other reasons mentioned above.I don't know if Jack Bauer survives at the end of Season 8, but if he does, there'd be nothing wrong with perhaps two or three feature films based on his character...

I'm not one to watch this show on a weekly basis, I'd much rather wait until the end of the year and watch all 24 episodes on DVD in less than a week: no commercials, no waiting days for cliffhangers to be solved. Sure, after such marathons you end up listening to the 24 theme and Jack uttering the words ""previously on 24"" in your dreams, but that's not so bad really.THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT SEASON 7#1 Jack's as great as ever, if maybe a bit more complex character with all the discussions about the evils of torture, hey, if in guessing, real life politicians batted 1.000 like Jack maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to allow it though that doesn't seem very likely. Anyway, Keifer is going to need a throat transplant from all the yelling sooner rather than later but it seem worth it.#2 The excelent President Taylor, unquestionably the best 24 president since Palmer (not Wayne obviously). She's just like Hillary without the pantsuits. This fictional character is the best way to learn it was a good thing that Hillary didn't become president, after all, wouldn't it have been horrible to refer to Bill as ""the first gentleman"" like they mention here all season long ?# 3 Good Tony / Bad Tony. Like most 24 fans, my stomach twisted when Tony's true nature was revealed but to my surprise the last few episodes I learn to accept it and the way the writers tied things up at the very end wasn't so terrible. To name Tony's resurrection as contrived is definetely an understatment but hey, maybe this means there is hope for Edgar fans all over the world.# 4 Much fewer eye-rolling moments than in past seasons though it was hard to accept the best way the 24 writers could think of a White House infiltration is underwater. If you've ever taken the tour of the place, like I have, you may not remmember any bodies of water in the vecinity.# 5 Oldie characters popping all the time: Aaron the no nonesense bodyguard and his ever present ear-piece-phone-cable.

After seeing Season 6, I was starting to get concerned that the writers behind 24 were running out of ideas.  The fact that Jack's dad was constantly coming up got incredibly tedious after a while.  Luckily in Season 7 this doesn't happen.  The villains change and get bigger as the show goes on, like we would normally find in a season of 24.One of the things that made this season especially strong was the change in location.  The fact that this season takes place in Washington D.C. really gives it a breath of fresh air in my opinion.  As you can guess this involves a threat to the White House and it is connected to ""Redemption"", but I won't say anything more than that.  At first with the setting in Los Angeles with David Palmer it was really great, but after a while the terrorists always attacking this one location got a little run of the mill after a while.  For whatever reason the change of location makes everything better.  In fact I think it would be awesome to let Jack's character go to different locations in future seasons.The season kicks off with Jack on trial with Congress for his use of torture tactics.  This is a theme that gets revisited quite a bit throughout the season.  Obviously this reflects the U.S.'s current questions on how effective torture tactics are.  I like seeing those sort of questions being reflected in popular media.  I also like that they don't force their character to completely change to popular thinking, and then of course we wouldn't have Jack Bauer.As some people have mentioned the packaging for this DVD is excellent.  I have to agree, it's the size of a regular DVD case, yet has six discs in it!  This saves on space and it does not require the use of Dual Disc.  I hate Dual Disc because you run a higher risk of scratching a surface of a disc, with these DVD's all of them have the top coated surface.  I think all large DVD sets should use this form of packaging; the sheer space saving aspect is completely worth it.If you felt that 24 was starting to flounder like I was, you might be pleasantly surprised at this season.  Sure the events are over the top, but that gives us the action packed episodes we all want.

1150629,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0015QWZ8S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 7]","After a lengthy hiatus, Jack finally has another really bad day. I don't know how many more times Jack gets himself out only to be pulled back into the counter-terrorism gig, but 24: SEASON 7 demonstrates that there are still legs on this thing. In the show's internal continuity, four years have elapsed since the events in Season 6, and in the interim Jack had roamed from place to place in search of some kind of inner peace. Except I'm guessing that wasn't ever gonna work out.The damnable writers' strike of 2007-08 delayed Season 7 for one year - which, as it turns out, was a blessing in disguise for the writers of 24 as they'd been stuck for ideas - and it wasn't until the24: Redemptiontelevision movie came out that I finally became convinced that there really was gonna be a seventh year. I frankly thought 24 was done. But here's Jack Bauer again, scarred and wracked with guilt, his methods condemned, still saving the world.As mentioned, four years had passed, and things haven't stayed the same. There's a new American President, a woman. CTU had been shut down, its tactics questioned and its operatives scattered. In Washington, D.C., Jack Bauer is on the verge of being indicted for past acts of brutality. But then a daring, broad daylight kidnapping puts Jack's trial on hold as the FBI seeks his expertise. Especially since one of the kidnappers is identified as Jack's old friend Tony Almeida, who isn't quite as deceased as everyone had assumed. From there, things quickly worsen.I think it's a boost in the arm, switching things up, moving to D.C. and taking CTU out of the equation and putting in the FBI as Jack's new intel and tech support - although one character would refer to the FBI agency as ""CTU Lite."" This introduces a running theme (and a hot button topic), that of Jack's ruthlessly doing whatever it takes to achieve his objective versus the FBI's strictly by the book methods. There's a new supporting cast brought in, with FBI agent Renee Walker impacting Jack the most. Agent Walker, in some ways, demonstrates how someone, under extreme duress and in light of horrific circumstances, can be swayed into adopting Jack's perspective. Her boss and friend cautions her: ""Renee, we're FBI, not CTU. We honor the law."" But how do you hold back when the price of idealism is possibly thousands of murdered lives? The most startling thing for me, though, may have been when Janeane Garafalo shows up as an FBI computer analyst. Talk about wonderful counter-casting.Season 7 basically unfolds in three stages, starting out as a follow up to 24: REDEMPTION as Jack and the FBI go up against the murderous warlord of Sangala. 24 still reeks of extreme paranoia and pervasive conspiracies, so it shouldn't be a surprise when Jack and Walker learn that things go much deeper than the Sangalan plot. There are layers and layers of duplicity.In another front, there's good focus on the President, effectively portrayed by Cherry Jones, as the American government once again falls under siege. There are sub-plots involving the suicide of her son and the alienation of her daughter. And, as usual, you never quite know who you can trust in the White House, in that most elite inner circle.It's pretty cool that Carlos Bernard is back, which means that Tony Almeida is back, or rather a darker, even more smoldering version of Tony. But it's almost like old times seeing him and Jack side by side again. They're eventually joined by other familiar faces, including one of my old favorites, Glenn Morshower, as straight-shooting Special Agent Aaron Pierce, the only guy other than Kiefer to have appeared in all of the seasons so far.Political intrigue, deadly espionage, riveting human drama, that blurring of ethics. 24 continues to be one of the best - if not THE best - thrill rides on television. That ominous beat we hear each time we glimpse the digital clock counting down, it's still pulse pounding to me. As the episodes progress, I fall in line with the pervasive mood of the show, and I trust no one and I constantly look for twists because there are plot reversals everywhere. We're still treated to storytelling that is complex and both plot and character driven, and the series still rides on the strength of its technical merits. And, except for Jack, each character in the show is expendable. Key players bite the bullet. Jack's actions provoke debate even as he remains the best guy out there to clean up the mess.24: SEASON 7 comes in six discs, with a cast & crew audio commentary on a whopping 12 episodes: ""8am-9am"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Carlos Bernard); ""10am-11am"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Carlos Bernard); ""12pm-1pm"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Annie Wersching); ""4pm-5pm"" (Producer David Fury & actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim); ""5pm-6pm"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Annie Wersching); ""7pm-8pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner & actor Tony Todd); ""8pm-9pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner, Composer Sean Callery, & actor James Morrison); ""9pm-10pm"" (Producers Evan Katz & Juan Carlos Moto, actors Annie Wersching & Bob Gunton); ""1am-2am"" (Producer Howard Gordon, Carlos Bernard, & Jeffrey Nordling); ""5am-6am"" (Producer Evan Katz, actors Mary Lynn Rajskub & Glenn Morshower); ""6am-7am"" (Producers David Fury, Alex Gansa, and actor Glenn Morshower); and ""7am-8am""(Producers Howard Gordon & Jon Cassar). It's always fun soaking in the actors' behind-the-scene commentaries, but I'm wondering how come Kiefer didn't drop by for a few words?Other special features include: 14 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Producers Stephen Kronish & Paul Gadd (including an emotional 6-minute scene with Kiefer and a familiar face); ""The Fimucite Festival Presents: The Music of 24"" - Composer/conductor Sean Callery and the Tenerife Film Orchestra & Choir perform the score from 24 live at the Guimer&aacute; Theater in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands (13 minutes long); ""Hour 19: The Ambush"" - we follow the f/x crew as they prep to blow up a building near the L.A.X. area (12:45 minutes); and ""24-7: The Untold Story"" - the show's writers reflect on the disappointment of Season 6, on the need for the show to reinvent itself, and then on the long, strenuous struggle to come up with a working story for Season 7 (almost 16 minutes long).Some things to look out for and maybe even savor:- First and foremost, Jack just being Jack, getting the job done, inhabiting that grey moral area; Kiefer Sutherland rules all- Tony Almeida alive and very much in the thick of things- The ongoing Ugly Chick Cyber War between Garafalo and Mary Lynn Rajskub- Yet another indecisive turnip for an American Vice-President (I don't know, 24 seems to enjoy featuring VPs who hem and haw)- If you're a fan of POPULAR, then nostalgia might kick in as Carly Pope shows up for a few episodes; oddly enough, her character's name is still Sam- One of the no-nonsense bad guys looks like a leaner, meaner Tracy

M Pyles,"[63, 70]","I have watched every season of 24 the same way:  wait for it to come out on DVD, start it on Friday night, and finish all 24 episodes by Sunday night.  I end up exhausted, sore, and somewhat addled, having missed -- like Jack -- a few critical phone calls, several meals, and almost all emotional connection with my fellow human beings . . . but with at least some sense of how poor Jack must feel when he punches out at the end of a workday only a superhero can handle.  It's really the only way to do it.Season 7 was a rollicking good time, restarting the adrenaline drip that ran somewhat dry last season.  I'm a big fan of Cherry Jones and am still grousing about how she lost the movie role in ""Doubt"" that she so sublimely played on stage.  With the shadow of Mother Aloysius hanging over things, I spent the first few hours wondering whether Ms. Jones was miscast as Madame President.  Where was the edge, the certainty, the petulance?  But after a couple of terrorist attacks the cussing started, she was in her groove, and we were finally treated to a President whose grim grit even a testy nun could respect.It's hard actually to discuss the story arc of a season of 24 without running into the spoiler alert problem.  Suffice it to say that season 7 is in a new town with some new characters and some returning friends and foes.  But the grander messages carry on from earlier seasons.  Terrorists never sleep, so neither may heroes.  There are many good people in government, but they just can't seem to keep the hatches battened down on their security systems, their classified information, and the whereabouts or plottings of their families and friends.  Moral dilemmas will never be resolved, as the need to protect our way of life and our system of laws can only be served by violating our way of life and our system of laws.  The people who opt to abide by the law are a lot more frustrating - and more boring - than the heroes who throw the law out the window to save our ability to have law.  Terrorists never, ever display compassion.  Heroes pick and choose.  There is a conspiracy behind everything, and no matter how far up the chain you go, there is always someone higher and nastier and better dressed.  Jack may seem easy to fathom, but he's complex.  Very complex.Lordy, I love this show.The big flaw to me in season 7 was Jack's little problem with his nervous system and the magic hypodermic.  Since everyone knows that Kiefer Sutherland is under contract for at least one more season, just how are we expected to get on the edges of our seats wondering if he's going to make it?  SPOILER ALERT:  He's going to make it.But one thing 24 proves is that with enough well-designed and well-photographed bombings, conspiracies, chases, shootouts, car wrecks, whizbang technology gadgets, and dramatic confrontations both loud and soft, the audience will hang in through any amount of untenable doings.Did I say how much I love this show?",4,As Tired as Jack,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2961,"['have', 'watched', 'season', '24', 'same', 'way', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'start', 'Friday', 'night', 'finish', '24', 'episodes', 'Sunday', 'night', 'end', 'up', 'exhausted', 'sore', 'somewhat', 'addled', 'having', 'missed', 'Jack', 'few', 'critical', 'phone', 'calls', 'several', 'meals', 'almost', 'emotional', 'connection', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'least', 'sense', 'how', 'poor', 'Jack', 'must', 'feel', 'when', 'out', 'end', 'workday', 'only', 'superhero', 'can', 'handle', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'it.Season', '7', 'was', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'restarting', 'adrenaline', 'drip', 'ran', 'somewhat', 'dry', 'last', 'season', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'am', 'still', 'grousing', 'how', 'lost', 'movie', 'role', 'Doubt', 'so', 'sublimely', 'played', 'stage', 'shadow', 'Mother', 'Aloysius', 'hanging', 'things', 'spent', 'first', 'few', 'hours', 'wondering', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'was', 'miscast', 'Madame', 'President', 'Where', 'was', 'edge', 'certainty', 'petulance', 'couple', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'cussing', 'started', 'was', 'groove', 'were', 'finally', 'treated', 'President', 'grim', 'grit', 'even', 'testy', 'nun', 'could', 'respect.It', 'hard', 'actually', 'discuss', 'story', 'arc', 'season', '24', 'running', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'problem', 'Suffice', 'say', 'season', '7', 'new', 'town', 'new', 'characters', 'returning', 'friends', 'foes', 'grander', 'messages', 'carry', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Terrorists', 'never', 'sleep', 'may', 'heroes', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'people', 'government', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'hatches', 'battened', 'down', 'security', 'systems', 'classified', 'information', 'whereabouts', 'plottings', 'families', 'friends', 'Moral', 'dilemmas', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'need', 'protect', 'way', 'life', 'system', 'laws', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'served', 'violating', 'way', 'life', 'system', 'laws', 'people', 'who', 'opt', 'abide', 'law', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'frustrating', 'more', 'boring', 'heroes', 'who', 'throw', 'law', 'window', 'save', 'ability', 'have', 'law', 'never', 'ever', 'compassion', 'Heroes', 'pick', 'choose', 'conspiracy', 'everything', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'chain', 'go', 'always', 'someone', 'higher', 'nastier', 'better', 'dressed', 'Jack', 'may', 'seem', 'easy', 'fathom', 'complex', 'Very', 'complex.Lordy', 'love', 'show.The', 'big', 'flaw', 'season', '7', 'was', 'Jack', 'little', 'problem', 'nervous', 'system', 'magic', 'hypodermic', 'everyone', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'contract', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'just', 'how', 'are', 'expected', 'get', 'edges', 'seats', 'wondering', 'going', 'make', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'going', 'make', 'it.But', 'one', 'thing', '24', 'proves', 'enough', 'well-designed', 'well-photographed', 'bombings', 'conspiracies', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'car', 'wrecks', 'whizbang', 'technology', 'gadgets', 'dramatic', 'confrontations', 'loud', 'soft', 'audience', 'will', 'hang', 'amount', 'untenable', 'doings.Did', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'show']",N/A

It's hard not to see Jack in all-out action, and that's where the season started to feel a little lethargic. But in exchange for Jack being on the sidelines for a bit, we did get a GREAT plot twist that I will not give away for those who don't watch the show near the end that gave a certain important character even more to work with.The themes of the season are two-fold: Betrayal being the big theme, and the most civic-minded one - how does one condone the 'enhanced interrogation' techniques that Jack and other agents use to acquire life-saving information. The second theme seems to get thrown under the bus for a few eps, but then comes back nearer the end as FBI Agent Renee Walker, who, at first dealings with Jack, is an obvious opponent of torture, sees what she may have to become in order to protect the greater good.What makes Jack a great action hero is that in those moments where dozens, hundreds, thousands, or in a few cases for Jack, millions of innocent lives are on the line, he knows that he has to do whatever it takes to save those people, and sometimes that requires a proverbial twist of the thumbscrews. What makes Jack a great character is that while he says that he doesn't regret those moments, he knows that there's a line that shouldn't be crossed.There have been people who maintain that this show is an outline for the justification of torture in extreme scenarios, and I think that it's high time that those good folk shut up and enjoy the OBVIOUS hyper-realism of 24. Look at Jack Bauer for a few minutes. He's literally died twice (possibly three times) during the run of the show (S2 when his heart stopped due to being tortured himself and S4 where they had to fake his death in order to prevent his murder). This show runs so far off the rails of conceivable realism that we cannot use this program as a microcosm of society's faults and triumpths. It's a great, pulse-pounding, thrill-a-minute action show.Remember in DIRTY HARRY when Callahan shoots the Scorpio killer and then steps on his wounded leg in order to extract information? Remember how good that felt because Harry's the good guy and the Scorpio's the bad guy? It's not supposed to be real. It's supposed to be entertainment. Get off the ""24 CONDONES TORTURE"" kick. Seriously. It's tired.Take 24 for what it is: Great entertainment.Except for Season 6.

I'm not saying it needs more character exposition (hopefully the show learned THAT lesson season 6), but I mean honestly how many times can California's anti-terrorist unit (apparently run by GQ models and ex-Microsoft employees) get infiltrated before someone notices it's ineffectivenes? Thankfully 24 season seven not only gets rid of CTU (mostly) but places the show in a much more diverse setting: Washington DC.This season of 24 starts off with a bang. Hero Jack Bauer on trial for his and CTU's inhumane treatment of criminals and terrorists (about time huh?). Then with the return of Tony Almada (who we saw die in season 5) Jack's called back into action. While the story of this season has the show's usual ups and downs (we already know Jack won't die so why even go there?) it's overall very solid. The action scenes are also very good and rank up there with this series's best (I don't think anything can quite compare to the adrenaline rush of Tony and Jack shooting their way out of Quantico!). The acting this season is also above average with cast regulars turning in their usual strong efforts and are joined by the equally good Cherry Jones as the new US president, Colm Feore, and Janeane Garofalo.The packaging of this DVD set is probably the best I've seen yet! Seriously I hope the rest of the seasons (and every other TV show out there for that matter) get re-issued in this case format.

1150643,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B0015QWZ8S,John Morgan,"[0, 0]","I have to admit, after a lackluster sixth season and what I thought was a disappointing TV movie (""24: Redemption""), I was worried that ""24""'s glory days were behind it. My confidence wasn't restored very much by the first eight episodes of season seven, either, which just seemed to be a rehash of all the same tired cliches from previous seasons. And then I had to leave the U.S. and didn't see the rest of the season until I returned recently and watched them on DVD. But I have to say, season seven improved greatly after the first episodes (the reason for this is explained by the writers on an extra on the DVDs), and the season as a whole definitely met my hopeful expectations. Jonas Hodges (Jon Voigt) was the best villain they've had in years, and turning Tony into an ambiguous figure (is he good or evil?) was an inspired turn for the series. And I loved the introduction of some truly positive Muslim characters for a change. It definitely proved to me that there's still life in ""24"" yet.As for the DVD presentation, it is good but not up to the standards of the other seasons. While there are a few extra features and 14 deleted scenes, the deleted scenes pale in comparison to what was offered on previous ""24"" sets, which usually had literally dozens of deleted scenes. And also, what happened to the option to watch the deleted scenes within the episodes in which they appeared? On this set, you can only watch them as extras on the last disc - in every other season except for the first, you have the option to watch them at the end or else embedded within the season itself, which to me is much preferable and is one of the things which made the ""24"" sets unique. Perhaps the rush to get the season 7 set out as soon as it was finished airing, as opposed to releasing it several months later as was traditional, accounts for this drawback. Perhaps Fox is planning to release a special ""deluxe"" set for season 7 in the future which will have more deleted scenes - which wouldn't be surprising given their propensity for milking the hardcore fans for every penny they can get (such as the ""Special Edition"" of season 6 which was a blatant ripoff).In short, a great year for ""24,"" but less than great for the producers of these DVDs.",4,"""24"" pulls its nuts out of the fire, but where are the deleted scenes?",1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2250,"['have', 'admit', 'lackluster', 'sixth', 'season', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'disappointing', 'TV', 'movie', '24', 'Redemption', 'was', 'worried', '24', 'glory', 'days', 'were', 'confidence', 'was', ""n't"", 'restored', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'eight', 'episodes', 'season', 'seven', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'rehash', 'same', 'tired', 'cliches', 'previous', 'seasons', 'then', 'had', 'leave', 'U.S.', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'rest', 'season', 'returned', 'recently', 'watched', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'seven', 'improved', 'greatly', 'first', 'episodes', 'reason', 'explained', 'writers', 'extra', 'DVDs', 'season', 'whole', 'definitely', 'met', 'hopeful', 'expectations', 'Jonas', 'Hodges', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'was', 'best', 'villain', ""'ve"", 'had', 'years', 'turning', 'Tony', 'ambiguous', 'figure', 'good', 'evil', 'was', 'inspired', 'turn', 'series', 'loved', 'introduction', 'truly', 'positive', 'Muslim', 'characters', 'change', 'definitely', 'proved', 'still', 'life', '24', 'yet.As', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'good', 'not', 'standards', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'few', 'extra', 'features', '14', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'pale', 'comparison', 'what', 'was', 'offered', 'previous', '24', 'sets', 'usually', 'had', 'literally', 'dozens', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'what', 'happened', 'option', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'appeared', 'set', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'extras', 'last', 'disc', 'other', 'season', 'first', 'have', 'option', 'watch', 'end', 'else', 'embedded', 'season', 'much', 'preferable', 'one', 'things', 'made', '24', 'sets', 'unique', 'Perhaps', 'rush', 'get', 'season', '7', 'set', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'finished', 'airing', 'opposed', 'releasing', 'several', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'traditional', 'accounts', 'drawback', 'Perhaps', 'Fox', 'planning', 'release', 'special', 'deluxe', 'set', 'season', '7', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'given', 'propensity', 'milking', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'penny', 'can', 'get', 'such', 'Special', 'Edition', 'season', '6', 'was', 'blatant', 'ripoff', 'short', 'great', 'year', '24', 'less', 'great', 'producers', 'DVDs']",N/A

1150646,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B0015QWZ8S,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[1, 3]","I hadn't watched one episode of ""24"" during its first six seasons. That was until this year when the seventh season of the Emmy Award winning show made its long awaited premiere (the seventh season was suppost to have aired last year but was pushed back because of the writer's strike). The Fox network moved one of my favorite shows, ""House, M.D."", from Tuesday nights to Monday nights and aired right before ""24"". So I got my first taste of this action packed series, and after viewing all of the episodes of season seven on DVD, now I'm hooked. The seventh season of ""24"" was the best TV series of the 2008-09 season. Yes, it was even better than the two current TV shows that I watched: ""House, M.D."" and ""Desperate Housewives"". And I plan to go back and catch up on the first six seasons which I haven't seen yet.""24"" follows the adventures of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, who through the first six seasons has stopped bombs, viruses, assassination attempts, etc., and has saved hundreds of lives in the process. Each season has played out in real time in a twenty-four hour frame of a very bad day for Jack and everyone else involved with what's going on. I got to see this play out for the entire seventh season and it was fascinating, not to mention scary, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and spectacular, usually all at the same time. But what really made season seven of ""24"" so special is the talented acting, writing, and directing that came together. There was hardly a boring moment in every frame of all 24 episodes.The plot of season seven deals with terrorists attacking the nation's capital, usually with the aide of people on the inside who you think are good but turn out to be bad. Make that very bad. There are so many villains that I couldn't keep track of them. And there are moments where you don't know who the characters can trust. From the early episodes with endangered airplanes in the sky to the middle episodes with a terrorist attack on the White House to the later episodes with Jack Bauer fighting for his life after being exposed to a lethal toxic gas, I was really amazed at how good this season of ""24"" was. This is TV drama at its finest.The acting is first-rate. Kiefer Sutherland was already a big movie star when he made the switch to the small screen in 2001 when ""24"" made its debut. But this show made him an even bigger star. Sutherland, who has usually played bad guys in the movies, got a chance to play a good guy and even though I haven't seen the first six seasons he must have been really good right from the start. He won a Golden Globe in 2002 and an Emmy in 2006 as proof. And I'm sure he'll be in the Emmy running again this year because in season seven he's brilliant. Also brilliant: Cherry Jones, who made her ""24"" debut in season seven as female U.S. President Allison Taylor. Jones delivered powerhouse performances in many of the episodes, and if she doesn't receive an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series this year, then it will be proof that the Emmy voters don't have any brains. Not only does she deserve to be nominated, I think she should win. Great acting gets big awards, and Jones did a great job this season. I'm alreadly looking forward to seeing her again in season eight. The other supporting actors did terrific work too. From series regulars Carlos Bernard, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and James Morrison to series newcomers Annie Wersching, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, and Jeffrey Nordling, as well as special guest appearences from Oscar winning actor Jon Voight, everyone does a great professional job here. The acting is not the only strong asset of the seventh season of ""24"". The writing and directing is excellent as well.Don't miss the seventh season of ""24"".

1150651,A1XH86OU75RY6Y,B0015QWZ8S,kem,"[60, 73]","I've noticed all of the reviews mainly focus on the season itself and not the essentials of the whether the blu-ray transfer of this season was good or not. So I've decided to add my two cents in. And remember everyone we are all entitled to our opinions so feel free to disagree. O.K. First of all I think season 7 was pretty good. I would give it 4 stars overall. It was better than the mess of season 6 and came close to the greatness of season 5. Of course nothing has come close yet to season 2 in my opinion. That was the standard that will be used to measure all action series for years to come. Anyway, yes there were some uneven moments and plot holes this season at times but when you look at the big picture after watching the entire show the writers explained it well enough to satisfy my curiosity. The acting was great as usual with plenty of new characters getting a chance to flex their muscles and of course Jack barking his way through the day as usual. I liked the dialogue between him and agent Renee Walker and how Jack finds some of his humanity in the process by the time the show draws to an end but Renee ends up somewhat losing her's. Those who have seen the finale know what I mean. And I can't say enough about Jon Voight. His acting was superb. I felt the show really hit a new gear when he took center stage as the main enemy. And yes there are a few moments where the story will make you scratch your head but in the end the writers do a good job of tying everything up and entertaining you in the process. For example, who cares why Jack is fighting someone when you get to see him kill a guy with a screwdriver through the chest and then use that same screwdriver to start-up a truck. A true classic Jack Bauer moment :) You'll even get to see Kim become a mini jack near the end. Overall a satisfying season that did more things right than it did wrong.Now on to the transfer. This is where my 3 star review comes into play. The blu-ray version is only slightly above the standard edition in picture quality in my opinion. On several occasions I noticed grain and bland or washed out colors. The blacks and grays were decent but didn't have that pop that I know blu-ray can produce. However, on a few scenes the picture quality was noticeable better than at other times. It seemed almost that fox didn't have their high def cameras working right on some of the episodes. Overall I would give the picture quality between a 7 and 8. The audio also is not quite what I was hoping. The dts master audio mix is a definite step up from dolby digital but for a show like 24 I was surprised that my system didn't get a better workout than it did. The audio mix is extremely front channel heavy with very little going on with your surrounds. This is a real missed opportunity on the part of fox since something is always going on behind the scenes with each set on 24. I wanted to hear the conversations and computer analysts typing away in the background with fbi headquarters or the grinding of hydraulics in the background as Jack and company stake out the loading docks. I just didn't hear any of that. And I feel that my ht is a pretty good set up (cost me about $3000) so I know that the mix could have been so much better. As a contrast I just finished watching Taken on blu and that was a audio mix done right. Anyway if I had known the mix would end up being so front channel heavy and the picture quality not popping as much as I had hoped I would have just went with standard def.

There is no sense in going into the plot, as it would spoil the viewer's enjoyment of the series.  That said, certain themes are once again explored in this remarkable award-winning drama.  Season 7 explores the theme of interrogation techniques used to extract critical information from suspects.  In the previous 6 seasons of ""24"", CTU Agent Field Commander Jack Bauer routinely violated prisoner's rights in order to get information that would save thousands of lives.  It comes down to this: Is is acceptable to violate one individual's rights in order to protect the safety of thousands, or even tens of thousands? Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?, (as Mister Spock so memorably said to Captain Kirk as he was dying), or should the rule of law always prevail without exception?  This season deals in-depth with this issue, not only for field agents, but for computer operators, doctors, and yes, even presidents.  It seems that we all have ethical decisions to make, some of which have profound implications.  How far is a person willing to go to reach the ""truth""?  Jack Bauer's psyche is explored in detail in this regard, and this sub-plot is an extremely important and interesting element of this season.The supporting cast is once again superb, second to none, and the interactions between characters is both humorous and tragic. The character development is absolutely astounding, more characteristic of a full-length movie than a TV series.""24"" not only will accelerate your heart, it will grab it too.

Redemption was in fact a redemption for the series.Despite season 6 having been a horrible season, it still was one of the best shows on. Btw, for the record, and hopefully the producers, writers and studios will see this, but every time 24 has a ""To be continued"" cliff-hanger, the following season sux (for 24). Season 6 was another of those not up to 24 par seasons. I'm guessing the reason is, 24 uses these cliff-hangers and then when the new season begins, they say, ""4 months later"" completely ignoring the entire cliff-hanger! They did that in season 2 or 3 and again in season 5. Note to the wise, and those that matter: DONT DO THIS ANYMORE!Taking the year off, rather than trying to force an 8 hour season last year was probably the wisest thing. Rumor has it that 24 had the first 8 episodes ready to go, but, they looked back on it, and decided to rewrite.What has occurred is a reminiscent, if not fresh look at things. Returning this season, so far, is Bill and Chloe, and a confused Tony Almeda. Confused as we don't don't what side he is on, after his ""death"" and the death of his wife, Michelle. Nor do we know if he is finished for the season, or if he turns up again later.The typical agency mole is the show's huge dependancy factor, as is the ""Jack's bad... No Jack's good...ok, everyone, Jack's the greatest Superhero ever"" roller-coaster. One thing that is not as predictable, is 24 has seemingly dropped the mini 4 episodic plots, and has gone much longer with the plots, which seem to help develop the story better.Even in a bad season, like 6, the show will be intense.

Lately i'm averaging 4 episodes per day & i'm happy to report that these episodes are just as addictive & suspenseful as they were when it first aired on FOX. As usual, each show is jam packed with action & suspense & the tension also harldly ever lets up.  Great stuntwork & explosions abound as well. But one of best things about this show are all the great character actors they always seem to bring in for each season.  Kurtwood Smith (Robocop) as Senator Blaine Mayer, Jon Voight (Deliverance) as the corrupt leader of a Blackwater-like mercenaries for hire outfit, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the White House Chief of Staff, Colm Feore (The Sum of All Fears) as the First man, Will Patton (Armageddon) as the head conspirator, Glenn Morshower (Blackhawk Down) reprising his role as Secret service agent - Aaron Pierce & Janeane Garofalo (Copland) as a nosy & suspicious FBI computer expert. Carlos Bernard also reprises his role as former CTU Agent turned fugitive Tony Almeida & Elisha Cuthbert  returns as well as Jack's estranged daughter - Kim.  The best new character in S7 though is the FBI agent Renee Walker played by lovely actress - Anne Wersching. She accompanies Jack Bauer through most of the series & quickly learns that in order to assist Jack in saving the day, she will sometimes have to bend the rules & do things that go against her own moral beliefs. This makes her very uneasy & frequently gets her in trouble with her boss - The ""By the book"" FBI Head Agent - Larry Moss (Jeffrey Nordling) who resents Jack for breaking law after law & torturing suspects. The tension between the three characters is very palpable & really helps add to the suspense & drama of the show. Add in a great story with frequent plot twists, lots of great action, terrific characters & more suspense than you can shake a stick at & you've got one of the most captivating seasons in the entire franchise.  I'd personally rank S7 as one of the top 3 best in the series & a must watch for anyone who's fan of 24 or great action thrillers with good character development.",5,One Of 24's Best Seasons,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2223,"['recently', 'bought', 'S7', 'dvd', 'set', 'let', 'tell', 'show', 'eating', 'fav', 'candy', 'Once', 'start', 'damn', 'impossible', 'stop', 'Lately', 'i', ""'m"", 'averaging', '4', 'episodes', 'day', 'i', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'addictive', 'suspenseful', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'FOX', 'usual', 'show', 'jam', 'packed', 'action', 'suspense', 'tension', 'also', 'harldly', 'ever', 'up', 'Great', 'stuntwork', 'explosions', 'abound', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'always', 'seem', 'bring', 'season', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Robocop', 'Senator', 'Blaine', 'Mayer', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Deliverance', 'corrupt', 'leader', 'Blackwater-like', 'mercenaries', 'hire', 'outfit', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'White', 'House', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'First', 'man', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Armageddon', 'head', 'conspirator', 'Glenn', 'Morshower', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'reprising', 'role', 'Secret', 'service', 'agent', 'Aaron', 'Pierce', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Copland', 'nosy', 'suspicious', 'FBI', 'computer', 'expert', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'also', 'role', 'former', 'CTU', 'Agent', 'turned', 'fugitive', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'as', 'well', 'Jack', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'best', 'new', 'character', 'S7', 'though', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Renee', 'Walker', 'played', 'lovely', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Wersching', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'most', 'series', 'quickly', 'order', 'assist', 'Jack', 'saving', 'day', 'will', 'sometimes', 'have', 'bend', 'rules', 'do', 'things', 'go', 'own', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'very', 'uneasy', 'frequently', 'trouble', 'boss', 'book', 'FBI', 'Head', 'Agent', 'Larry', 'Moss', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'who', 'Jack', 'breaking', 'law', 'law', 'torturing', 'suspects', 'tension', 'three', 'characters', 'very', 'palpable', 'really', 'add', 'suspense', 'drama', 'show', 'Add', 'great', 'story', 'frequent', 'plot', 'twists', 'lots', 'great', 'action', 'terrific', 'characters', 'more', 'suspense', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'seasons', 'entire', 'franchise', ""'d"", 'personally', 'rank', 'S7', 'one', 'top', '3', 'best', 'series', 'must', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', '24', 'great', 'action', 'thrillers', 'good', 'character', 'development']",N/A

It is also slightly less violent than season 6 which makes it less nasty which is good. Then on the other hand there is a lot of ""torture is not ok but i still do it"" blabla by Jack Bauer and even others.

But the hearing has just started with Jack is pulled out and taken to the FBI.  There he learns that former CTU agent and friend Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) is a terrorist.  And he's working with others planning an attack for that very day.  Teaming up with FBI agent Renee Walker (Annie Wersching), he sets out to stop the unfolding events.Meanwhile, President Taylor (Cherry Jones), the US's first female president, is trying to deal with the unfolding events and the revelation that there are people in her own administration working against her.  Can her administration survive the day?  Can Jack stop the terrorists?I think most every one agrees that season six of this thriller was non-thrilling.  Taking advantage of the writer's strike, the show spent two years working on the just concluded seventh season.And it shows.While it wasn't quite the fresh approach they advertised, it was once again fun.  Yes, several plot elements were way too used and the FBI really just subbed for CTU, but the action was non-stop and most of the twists good given enough time to be explained.  And there was one set piece near the middle of the season that had my heart racing just like old times.Probably my favorite moments in this season involved Mary Lynn Rajskub's Chloe and her FBI counter part Janis Gold, played by Janeane Garofalo.  The two characters are very similar, and watching them work together, or not as the case may be, has provided some comic relief.  The fact that I wish there were more probably means they used them just about right.This season was set in Washington DC.  Since plot is king (as always), I'm not sure the location really mattered.  I did find the location details not quite as distracting as they were when the show was set in LA.Considering the current real life political climate, they tried to have some thoughts about torture.  However, it was overshadowed by the race to the next plot point.Any fan of the show owes it to themselves to give this season a chance.

The setting is washington  DC, the task...well its 24 so its save america from bad guys.  I won't give any spoilers or tell the story, but it very much follows the 24 template, a story begins, morphs into another, and morphs yet again.  The use of the new FBI characters works well.  I especially liked the young Rene opposite baurer, who is starting to show his age.  Rene's youthful vigor and debate over right and wrong plays well with Jack's do anythiny necessary approach, without coming off nagging.  There was also a return of some well missed characters.  My only complaint, the new president, and her story, wasn't a particular grabber to me.  The president is often the basis of the additional story in the show, as their decisions are important and relevant.

Furthermore, we own all the Seasons on DVD.This will remain a classic TV series and deserves much praise for it's creativity.Having said that, all things have a lifespan and eventually come to an end.It seems that any series after 6-7 seasons begins to decline -- It can't be helped --- After 130+ episodes of ANY SHOW, what more is there to do or say ?It is kind of like life.... As we age there are fewer and fewer exciting ""firsts"" that we expererience and everday life becomes simple repetition of the same events with only minor variations.Season 5 was probably the last strong season.Season 6 was of course an ""off-season"" as most fans and viewers agree.The writer's strike seemed to kill the momentum for many shows.24 tried to bridge the gap with the African-based mini-movie filler, but that mostly fell flat for most viewers.SPOILER BELOW ....Season 7 seemed to start very good, but pretty much after the White House seige, this season seemed to just limp along with no real directon, consistency or pacing.By the time we got to the last 10 episodes, one was just hoping for the series to end and be done with it already.The 2 hour Season Finale may in fact be the worst and weakest single 24 episode ever as it was totally out of character, stiff, and apparently FOX felt some need to start shoving more and more political correctness into the show this season that went beyond neccessity.Will we watch next season ......... hmmm, Yes.BUT........ if Season 8 continues going in the direction that Season 7 ended, we may very well drop off and stop watching.This is not a nasty critique of 24 at all ........ as I said at the beginning, we have loved the show ---------  but there comes a time for EVERYTHING (Cheers, Seinfeld, Wings, etc..etc..etc..)24 was a GREAT, GREAT show .......it's just that it feels as though it's time has come to end.UPDATE -Over the Memorial Day weekend we received Season 7 DVD in the mail and decided to watch it straight thru for a re-evaluation.I feel the need to update my earlier review.OVERALL, Season 7 was better than I remembered.  I think my earlier tough rating was skewed by the most recently aired (final 5-6 episodes).I still feel the Season ""fell apart"" at the end and seemed to wander aimlessly and lose it's way at the very end.Watching Season 7 again non-stop two (2) things become apparent...(1) It seems that perhaps 10-12 episodes were filmed BEFORE the strike in Hollywood.  I say this because the feel and vibe of the writing changes erratically around the 11th episode as though the writers and cast had been on a long break and had a hard time getting back in the vibe.(2) Depite item #1, the Season was really pretty good overall.... but something just derailed during the last 5-6 episodes and as mentioned before, I still feel the final episode was like a car with a blown engine just rolling to a stop.The feeling during the last 5-6 episodes is almost as though the writers ran out of story but realized they had another 6-7 hours to fill so they started ""running out the clock"" to fill the time void.All things considered, I feel my rating should be UPGRADED to a Four (4).",3,May be time for the clock to stop for good,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3301,"['wife', 'are', 'big', '24', 'fans', 'have', 'long', 'defended', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'Even', 'weak', 'season', '24', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'days', 'Furthermore', 'own', 'Seasons', 'DVD.This', 'will', 'remain', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'much', 'praise', 'creativity.Having', 'said', 'things', 'have', 'lifespan', 'eventually', 'come', 'end.It', 'series', '6-7', 'seasons', 'decline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', '130+', 'episodes', 'ANY', 'SHOW', 'what', 'more', 'there', 'do', 'say', 'kind', 'like', 'life', 'age', 'are', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'exciting', 'firsts', 'expererience', 'everday', 'life', 'simple', 'repetition', 'same', 'events', 'only', 'minor', 'variations.Season', '5', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'strong', 'season.Season', '6', 'was', 'course', 'off-season', 'most', 'fans', 'viewers', 'agree.The', 'writer', 'strike', 'seemed', 'kill', 'momentum', 'many', 'shows.24', 'tried', 'bridge', 'gap', 'African-based', 'mini-movie', 'filler', 'mostly', 'fell', 'flat', 'most', 'viewers.SPOILER', '7', 'seemed', 'start', 'very', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'White', 'House', 'seige', 'season', 'seemed', 'just', 'limp', 'along', 'real', 'directon', 'consistency', 'pacing.By', 'time', 'got', 'last', '10', 'episodes', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'hoping', 'series', 'end', 'be', 'done', '2', 'hour', 'Season', 'Finale', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'worst', 'weakest', 'single', '24', 'episode', 'ever', 'was', 'totally', 'character', 'stiff', 'apparently', 'FOX', 'felt', 'need', 'start', 'shoving', 'more', 'more', 'political', 'correctness', 'show', 'season', 'went', 'neccessity.Will', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'hmmm', 'Yes.BUT', '..', 'Season', '8', 'going', 'direction', 'Season', '7', 'ended', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'drop', 'off', 'stop', 'watching.This', 'not', 'nasty', 'critique', '24', 'said', 'beginning', 'have', 'loved', 'show', 'time', 'EVERYTHING', 'Cheers', 'Seinfeld', 'Wings', 'etc..etc..etc..', '24', 'was', 'GREAT', 'GREAT', 'show', 'just', 'time', 'come', 'end.UPDATE', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'weekend', 'received', 'Season', '7', 'DVD', 'mail', 'decided', 'watch', 'straight', 'thru', 're-evaluation.I', 'feel', 'need', 'update', 'earlier', 'review.OVERALL', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'better', 'remembered', 'think', 'earlier', 'tough', 'rating', 'was', 'skewed', 'most', 'recently', 'aired', 'final', '5-6', 'episodes', '.I', 'still', 'feel', 'Season', 'fell', 'apart', 'end', 'seemed', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'lose', 'way', 'very', 'end.Watching', 'Season', '7', 'again', 'non-stop', 'two', '2', 'things', 'become', 'apparent', '1', 'perhaps', '10-12', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'strike', 'Hollywood', 'say', 'feel', 'vibe', 'writing', 'changes', 'erratically', '11th', 'episode', 'writers', 'cast', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'break', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'back', 'vibe', '2', 'Depite', 'item', '1', 'Season', 'was', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'something', 'just', 'derailed', 'last', '5-6', 'episodes', 'as', 'mentioned', 'still', 'feel', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'car', 'blown', 'engine', 'just', 'rolling', 'stop.The', 'feeling', 'last', '5-6', 'episodes', 'almost', 'writers', 'ran', 'story', 'realized', 'had', '6-7', 'hours', 'fill', 'so', 'started', 'running', 'out', 'clock', 'fill', 'time', 'void.All', 'things', 'considered', 'feel', 'rating', 'should', 'be', 'UPGRADED', 'Four', '4']",N/A

Anyone who is even slightly farmiliar with Amazons pre-ordering knows that they do not charge you until the item ships. With that knowledge it becomes painfully clear that these pre-order's are a fantastic idea both for Amazon and the paying customer. Its good for Amazon because they get better knowledge on just how many copies they will need when its released and its good for the customer because they offer significant discounts for pre-ordering. Since your not charged until it ships and since you can cancel at any time before it ships, well lets just say that anyone speaking out negatively about such business practices has no clue what they are talking about.If Amazon charged your credit card before it shipped than this would be a completely different story but that simply is not the case. They are not getting any money until they ship the product. Lets face it some people just have to complain. Its literally a part of thier personality and trust me I have known a couple people like this in my life. They dont bother to educate themselves about something before lashing out, they just immediatly form a biased opinion and the bashing begins. Its really the very essence of ignorance. So take my advice and just ignore all of the naysayers because not a single one can formulate a logical argument against Amazon;s pre ordering system.Thank you Amazon!!

Things were (at least for me) getting a bit tired in season 5. (Was that the season where Kim was chased by a cougar wearing a beret and carrying a knife?) Anyway, I digress... So, I sort of thought it was done.After seeing some other positive reviews of season 7, I thought it was worth trying again... especially at the low prices that an ""old"" show goes for. I was very happy with it! This is probably the best season I have seen so far. Of course, you must maintain a casual relationship with reality in some cases throughout the series, but overall it works very well.If you are a fan of 24 (or what it used to be early on) this is worth buying.

While it met most of its expectations and then didn't, it was a surprise return to form as a show that everyone was starting to think was about to kick the bucket returned with a tour de force attitude.Like any other ""24"" season, however, it suffers from filler, outrageous plotlines, but most of them are absent this time, almost equaling (but not quite) the amount of filler and ridiculous plotlines of season 5 (there were hardly any in that season).Unlike the previous season, the new cast in season 7 is exciting, engaging, and engrossing.  We finally get a new female Jack Bauer, Renee Walker, but she just isn't quite there yet, she has a hard time going above the law to save her country.  Her former lover and boss, Larry Moss, heads her FBI unit, who is totally against the man that is Jack Bauer, but over the day, learns that Jack Bauer isn't an evil man, he's trying to save his country.Cherry Jones commands her role as President Allison Taylor, who is the most liberal president ever featured on ""24"", and a nice departure from the usual president on ""24"".

Most characters are well depicted, although I thought some would have been better represented by other actors - yet the acting was talented in general.The last few episodes stretched credibility to show how even Jack Bauer could keep going with such stamina to endure and persevere through a horrible nuclear infection to again save the day. Fans must have suffered through the seasonal hiatus wondering what was going to happen (would the show be canceled, but maybe that pumped up ratings). So I felt disappointed that Jack's illness wasn't addressed in more detail at the beginning of the next season, when he was miraculously cured and again in fighting form.(Perhaps later episodes present more detail - I'm just starting season 8, but that's another review).Other gaps in season 7's storylines (which may have been stripped from the final episode versions) include Bill Buchanan's marital relationship, Jack's daughter's sudden appearance after years of estrangement, and Tony Almeida's real motives for his apparently back-and-forth ""whose side is he on, anyway""?

1150705,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B0015QWZ8S,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[16, 18]","Like most fans, I was disappointed in Season 6, but willing to give 24 another try based on its past greatness. Season 7 surpassed my expectations.While 24 is an action show, its best moments for me are the pivotal ones in the lives of the characters we care about so much, especially Jack. (Like, in Season 2 Jack talking with Kim while flying the plane, then Mason showing up and talking to Jack about what Jack should really be doing with his life; or, in Season 3, Jack and Nina's final confrontation; or in Season 5, our last visit with David Palmer.) There are several such memorable moments in Season 7.This season benefits from a great cast, including some returning favorite characters (Tony, Chloe, Agent Pierce, and a couple others) and some great new ones (FBI Agent Renee Walker, super talented & resourceful and a possible love interest for Jack in Season 8 - if he lives that long), and uber bad guy Jonas Hodges, played to a tee by Jon Voight.Season 7 borrows the more successful plot elements from previous seasons, and does them well in a new context. Jack, once again, is working on the outside, with the help of Chloe on the inside. Jack, once again, must infiltrate a group of bad guys by pretending to be one of them, and must pretend to kill someone he - and we - care about to convince them of his loyalties. There's a well-placed mole, feeding intel to the bad guys and keeping them a step ahead of our hero. There's a Sherrie Palmer-like character in the President's daughter, and, finally, once again, a President with principles - like David Palmer.I am hoping the writers try some different plot elements next year instead of rehashing the same formula. Stop making Jack prove he's a good guy - sheesh, he's saved the world 6 or 7 times over, you'd think people would have learned by now. Give him some real resources and the unconditional faith of the leaders he serves.But, after the disappointing Season 6, the writers did a fantastic job, and Season 7 brings the comforting feeling of the old 24 magic. Most fans, I think, will easily forgive the writers for reusing some past plot points. And while not all seasons of 24 portray their villains as 3-dimensional characters with plausible motivations, Season 7 gives us a nicely fleshed out villain in Jonas Hodges, and another guy who's pretty bad reveals his true motivations to Jack in Episode 24, and it's pretty plausible and satisfying.In the end, despite the terrorist threats to the nation, and all the great action and stunts and car crashes, Season 7 is more intimate - it's about Jack facing his demons and about other characters we've long known dealing with theirs. And as a bonus (I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler), Kim's reappearance sets things right with fans - she doesn't wind up in any cougar traps - far from it - and she makes a positive contribution when it counts most. In my view, everything wraps up perfectly in Episode 24. The writers don't explicitly show the actual resolution to certain things, like what Renee is about to do when we last see her, or what will happen after the very final scene. But they show enough to make it clear how things turn out. And it is very satisfying.If you have not seen 24 Season 7 yet, I envy you for the treat you're in store for.",5,Season 7 reestablishes 24 as one of the TV's best,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3284,"['most', 'fans', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Season', '6', 'willing', 'give', '24', 'try', 'based', 'past', 'greatness', 'Season', '7', 'surpassed', 'expectations.While', '24', 'action', 'show', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'pivotal', 'ones', 'lives', 'characters', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'especially', 'Jack', 'Season', '2', 'Jack', 'talking', 'Kim', 'flying', 'plane', 'then', 'Mason', 'showing', 'up', 'talking', 'Jack', 'what', 'Jack', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'doing', 'life', 'Season', '3', 'Jack', 'Nina', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Season', '5', 'last', 'visit', 'David', 'Palmer', 'are', 'several', 'such', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Season', '7.This', 'season', 'benefits', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'returning', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Tony', 'Chloe', 'Agent', 'Pierce', 'couple', 'others', 'great', 'new', 'ones', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Renee', 'Walker', 'super', 'talented', 'resourceful', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Jack', 'Season', '8', 'long', 'uber', 'bad', 'guy', 'Jonas', 'Hodges', 'played', 'tee', 'Jon', 'Voight.Season', '7', 'more', 'successful', 'plot', 'elements', 'previous', 'seasons', 'well', 'new', 'context', 'Jack', 'once', 'again', 'working', 'outside', 'help', 'Chloe', 'inside', 'Jack', 'once', 'again', 'must', 'infiltrate', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'pretending', 'be', 'one', 'must', 'pretend', 'kill', 'someone', 'care', 'convince', 'loyalties', 'well-placed', 'mole', 'feeding', 'intel', 'bad', 'guys', 'keeping', 'step', 'ahead', 'hero', 'Sherrie', 'Palmer-like', 'character', 'President', 'daughter', 'finally', 'once', 'again', 'President', 'principles', 'David', 'Palmer.I', 'am', 'hoping', 'writers', 'try', 'different', 'plot', 'elements', 'year', 'instead', 'rehashing', 'same', 'formula', 'Stop', 'making', 'Jack', 'good', 'guy', 'sheesh', 'saved', 'world', '6', '7', 'times', ""'d"", 'think', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'now', 'Give', 'real', 'resources', 'unconditional', 'faith', 'leaders', 'serves.But', 'disappointing', 'Season', '6', 'writers', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Season', '7', 'comforting', 'feeling', 'old', '24', 'magic', 'Most', 'fans', 'think', 'will', 'easily', 'forgive', 'writers', 'reusing', 'past', 'plot', 'points', 'not', 'seasons', '24', 'portray', 'villains', '3-dimensional', 'characters', 'plausible', 'motivations', 'Season', '7', 'nicely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'villain', 'Jonas', 'Hodges', 'guy', 'who', 'pretty', 'bad', 'true', 'motivations', 'Jack', 'Episode', '24', 'pretty', 'plausible', 'satisfying.In', 'end', 'terrorist', 'threats', 'nation', 'great', 'action', 'stunts', 'car', 'crashes', 'Season', '7', 'more', 'intimate', 'Jack', 'facing', 'demons', 'other', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'long', 'known', 'dealing', 'theirs', 'bonus', 'hope', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'Kim', 'reappearance', 'sets', 'things', 'right', 'fans', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'cougar', 'traps', 'far', 'positive', 'contribution', 'when', 'most', 'view', 'everything', 'wraps', 'up', 'perfectly', 'Episode', '24', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'explicitly', 'show', 'actual', 'resolution', 'certain', 'things', 'what', 'Renee', 'do', 'when', 'last', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'show', 'enough', 'make', 'clear', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'very', 'satisfying.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '24', 'Season', '7', 'yet', 'envy', 'treat', ""'re"", 'store']",N/A

1150712,AMP6LJ9WW3YC,B0015QWZ8S,sebastian crane,"[7, 11]","First off, let me say that this is the first time I've bought a season of a television show on blu ray. I'm really quite disappointed. The constant-- and seemingly arbitrary--shifts between nice clear shots and what I can only assume are intentionally grainy shots (for artistic purposes I suppose), are irksome and really throw into question the purpose of having this on blu ray to begin with. I like blu ray in general, but I wish I had gotten the regular dvd version of this and saved 12 bucks.As for the season itself, I've been a follower of 24 since the beginning, and this season is, I must say, the weakest of the 7. I, like most, was disappointed with season 6 and was looking forward to a return to form for the show. Most seem to think season 7 IS a return to form but I disagree. In addition to being poorly constructed, the writers have returned to all the same narrative devices that were exhausted after the first few seasons--moles in the government, machiavellian relatives, tiresome on-screen debating about the ethics of torture (let the audience debate Jack's methods, don't resort to simplistic middle-school level on-screen disputes--it's creative writing 101 that you SHOW don't TELL), twists you can see coming a mile away, the impossible choice scenario, characters complaining to co-workers that another co-worker or superior may not be up to job, innocent people being asked to go along with the bad guy so that jack can find the location of the headquarters (which always goes wrong), the first villain only being part of a much larger plan, etc... I realize some of these are hallmarks of the show, and are what originally made the show so captivating, but really, how long can they keep being recycled?Also, some of the characters here are used in such a perfunctory manner, the show simply feels listless. Chloe disappears for large chunks of the narrative and doesn't have much to do when she is onscreen; Aaron Pierce is mostly standing around and it's never really clear why he's even there; the great talent of Jon Voigt is essentially wasted in a hyperbolized role; if you're not gonna do more with Morris, leave him out. Moreover, the narrative itself is not well assembled. Plot threads frequently disappear inexplicably (a situation more common in later seasons of the show, most infamously in the case of Beruz from season 4--what ever happened to him??) or the show leaves them dormant for extended periods of time. The dialogue could also use some new life; how many times can Jack Bauer convincingly bark things like ""We're running out of time!"" and why must we be subjected to repeated summaries of the plot by characters who blow up at other characters in moments of frustration: ""There's a terrorist out there with a nuclear weapon, the president is about to order an invasion, one of our agents is missing, and we're tracking a criminal who may lead us to the enemy's headquarters, so go back to your station and do your job!"" Of course, there is also the obligatory death of a major character. Finally, the events of the show are, of course, absurd and over the top, but the whole mother/daughter as the president/chief of staff thing was really too much.Anyway, many will disagree with me, and that's fine, but I think this show has clearly jumped the shark and could really use some fresh thinking in the writing department.

Keifer Sutherland and the cast and crew really pulled out all the stops with this newest day of terror. You start off immediately by finding out that CTU has been disbanded and it's 4 years from the events of season 6. Jack Bauer, played by Keifer Sutherland, is on trial for his various crimes and infractions built up by the previous seasons. But the trial is interrupted by FBI agent Renee Walker, played by Annie Wersching, saying that Jack is needed to help out with a priority situation. A rash of attacks built up to a kidnapping perpetrated by the supposedly deceased Tony Almeida, played by Carlos Bernard.Now for die hard fans of 24, they'll remember in season 5 that Almeida was not given the traditional silent countdown usually given to a hero who has died. So fans were speculating that Tony would be revived in some way shape or form. In the meantime we do see reappearances of the following characters, mind you the character list includes the amazing actors who played them.Bill Buchanan - James Morrison-- Morrison provides audio commentary on an episodeChloe O Brian - Mary Lynn Rajskub-- Rajskub also provides an audio commentaryMorris O Brian - Carlo RotaNow for those who have seen and bought the prequel movie, 24-Redemption, they'll remember the chain of events leading up to season 7. Keep in mind, it is not exactly necessary for viewers to have watched the prequel movie, but it does help in back story for events dealing with the white house and the new president played brilliantly by Cherry Jones.This season is the most action packed, story driven, character driven, cliffhanger of a season that 24 has ever produced. You see new main characters, you see the deaths of multiple characters. I won't spoil too many details for newer viewers of the show. But we also get the inclusion into the villainy by two top notch actors, Will Patton and most importantly the incredible Jon Voight.And you'll definitely get irked as I did at the ending of season 7. For that is the ultimate cliffhanger. Jack Bauer has made sacrifice after sacrifice to protect his country. He's lost almost everything he could have ever lost. And in the process of defending his country for day 7, he gets infected by a weaponized gas that has no known cure. Jack Bauer lays dying. His daughter Kim, played by Elisha Cuthbert, arrives to say goodbye to Jack. But Kim isn't ready to let her father go.All I'll say no is that it'd better not take as long to give us the answers in season 8.",5,A Valiant Victory For 24,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,2557,"['Firstly', 'long', 'wait', '7th', 'season', '24', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'cast', 'crew', 'really', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'newest', 'day', 'terror', 'start', 'immediately', 'finding', 'out', 'CTU', 'been', 'disbanded', '4', 'years', 'events', 'season', '6', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'played', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'trial', 'various', 'crimes', 'infractions', 'built', 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'trial', 'interrupted', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Renee', 'Walker', 'played', 'Annie', 'Wersching', 'saying', 'Jack', 'needed', 'help', 'out', 'priority', 'situation', 'rash', 'attacks', 'built', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'perpetrated', 'supposedly', 'deceased', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'played', 'Carlos', 'Bernard.Now', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', '24', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'season', '5', 'Almeida', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'traditional', 'silent', 'countdown', 'usually', 'given', 'hero', 'who', 'died', 'So', 'fans', 'were', 'speculating', 'Tony', 'would', 'be', 'revived', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'meantime', 'do', 'see', 'reappearances', 'following', 'characters', 'mind', 'character', 'list', 'amazing', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'them.Bill', 'Buchanan', 'James', 'Morrison', 'Morrison', 'audio', 'commentary', 'episodeChloe', 'O', 'Brian', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Rajskub', 'also', 'audio', 'commentaryMorris', 'O', 'Brian', 'Carlo', 'RotaNow', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'bought', 'prequel', 'movie', '24-Redemption', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'chain', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'season', '7', 'Keep', 'mind', 'not', 'exactly', 'necessary', 'viewers', 'have', 'watched', 'prequel', 'movie', 'help', 'back', 'story', 'events', 'dealing', 'white', 'house', 'new', 'president', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Cherry', 'Jones.This', 'season', 'most', 'action', 'packed', 'story', 'driven', 'character', 'driven', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '24', 'ever', 'produced', 'see', 'new', 'main', 'characters', 'see', 'deaths', 'multiple', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'newer', 'viewers', 'show', 'also', 'get', 'inclusion', 'villainy', 'two', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'Will', 'Patton', 'most', 'importantly', 'incredible', 'Jon', 'Voight.And', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'get', 'irked', 'did', 'ending', 'season', '7', 'ultimate', 'cliffhanger', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'made', 'sacrifice', 'sacrifice', 'protect', 'country', 'lost', 'almost', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'lost', 'process', 'defending', 'country', 'day', '7', 'infected', 'weaponized', 'gas', 'known', 'cure', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'dying', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'played', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Jack', 'Kim', ""n't"", 'ready', 'let', 'father', 'go.All', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'d"", 'better', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'give', 'answers', 'season', '8']",N/A

The timeline has moved several years past the nuclear incident, and Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is testifying before a Senate committee, when he is taken into custody by FBI agent Renee Walker (Anne Wersching), who seeks his help in tracking down Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), believed to have been killed back in Day 5.Thus begins what is a return to a more traditional 24 adventure.  Unlike Day 6, where Bauer was off balance and questioning himself, Jack is totally committed to the job at hand, and willing to do whatever it takes.  Contrasting this is Rene Walker, Bauer's companion for much of the day.  She rises to the meet the day's crisis, but is conflicted by having to employ Bauer's methods, that while morally questionable, usually produce the desired results.  Her behavior is frustrating to her boss, Larry Moss (Jeffery Nordling), and her gradual, at times disturbing, and perhaps tragic transformation, is one of the season's key story elements.  The pacing is mostly brisk, the characters interesting, and the acting edgy and mostly believable.  There are plenty of the kind of plot twists, surprises, and sudden deaths, viewers have come to expect, topped off with an (for now) ambiguous ending, that helps to wash away some of the bad aftertaste from Day 6.Besides Almeida, characters returning from previous seasons include Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Bill Buchanan (James Morrison), Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower), Morris O'Brian (Carlo Rota), and Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  24 has always featured a tremendously talented cast, and Day 7 is no exception, with Cherry Jones, Jeffery Nordling, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, Sprague Graydon, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Enuka Okuma, Ravi Kapoor, and Jon Voight.24 Redemption a two hour prequel to Day 7, focused on the events in the African nation of Sangala, and introduced President Allison Taylor (Jones), Jonas Hodges (Voight), Colonel Ike Dubaku (Kazim), General Juma (Tony Todd) and Chief of Staff Ethan Kanin (Gunton), setting the stage for the events in Day 7.Typically, Day 7 involves several major story arcs.  One involves the penetration of a government computer system, by terrorists who threaten the nation's air traffic control system.  Bauer and Walker work to stop the terrorists, and uncover a conspiracy that involves members of the federal government.  Sangalan General Juma leads an audacious assault on the White House, taking the President hostage, and threatening to cut her daughter Olivia's eyes out.  A beloved character makes the ultimate sacrifice, leaving Jack shaken, as this story arc closes.There is still much more to come, as Jonas Hodges spearheads a plot by the private security company Starkwood, to employ a biological weapon that was developed in Sangala.  And Tony Almedia has much unfinished business to attend to.  Jack's exposure to a biological pathogen, is life-threatening, and gradually affects his ability to function.  The arrival of Kim Bauer, provides a slim hope for Jack's survival.  The finale is a massive emotional ride, with evil mastermind Alan Wilson (Will Patton) taken into custody, Jack and Renee having a deep heart to heart, the first family's drama in the White House, and Jack seeking absolution for his sins.  With Bauer in a coma and Kim by his side, the final dispensation of ""justice"" rests in another's hands.In Day 7, reality is stretched and molded in manners normal for 24, and there are some rough spots, and a few totally illogical developments.  The setting in the vicinity of the Capitol, features mostly urban locations.  Still, those troubled by the trends in Day 6, and Day 5, may find the more focused storytelling in Day 7 more palatable and satisfying.  Kiefer Sutherland delivers another powerful performance, tough but also vulnerable.  Carlos Bernard transitions several times in Tony's bittersweet ""it's about justice"" return.  Anne Wersching has the challenging role and pivotal role as Agent Renee Walker, and her performance is powerful and compelling.  She fades a bit in the third quarter, but finishes strongly after taking over from Larry Moss.  There are many other standout performers, including Sprague Graydon, Jon Voight, Cherry Jones, Bob Gunton, Janeane Garofalo, Elisha Cuthbert, and as always Glenn Morshower as solid as a rock, Aaron Pierce.As in previous seasons, a number of episodes have a commentary track.  Most are mildly informative, though some are more animated (Carlos Bernard), or amusing (Glenn Morshower), although unfortunately Sutherland, Jones,  Graydon, Voight, and Garofalo do not participate.  Among the extras are some deleted scenes, the best of which is a powerful, expanded initial meeting between Kim and Jack.  ""24-7 The Untold Story"" is a featurette detailing the writers' travails attempting to get the series back on track, after Day 6.  Perhaps only a program with the huge gravitas of 24, could afford to make such an admission.  Of interest is how the prequel 24 Redemption, ended up meshing nicely with the events in Day 7.With a strong comeback, the continuing saga of 24, is poised to embark boldly onto the eighth day.",4,"Day 7: Go back Jack, do it again . . . the Bauer effect, and Renee Walker . . .",1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,5626,"['controversial', 'Season', '6', '2007', 'featured', 'nuclear',

Corse ""OldOneEye""","[1, 2]","I've been a ""24"" fan since the series began, and as many earlier reviews have stated, the 7th season was a true ""high point"" for this show.  It's true that the series had been getting a bit stale over the previous 2 seasons, then there was the Writer's Strike which basically set everything back a year, with co-creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochrane eventually leaving the show for good.In this case, the infusion of ""new blood"" (pardon the pun) was just what the show needed.  I've been watching my DVD's again recently, and here's the high points:>Great pacing.  The action is non-stop, but the plot threads are as twisted as I remember the First Season's being, and they strike a great balance between the two.>We really see Jack's dark side.  Although it's seldom mentioned in these episodes, the torture at the hands of the Chinese has left both visible and hidden scars on our hero.  He's still doing his job, still dedicated to saving lives, but he's a man who's pretty much lost all hope in the future.>Casting for this season is excellent! Cherry Jones as the President, and Anne Wersching as FBI Agent Renee Walker nail their roles, plus we get to see Bill Buchanan, Tony Almeida and Secret Service agent Aaron Pierce again, as well as Chloe O'Brien.  We also have a perfect foil for Jack in FBI Bureau Chief Larry Moss, a ""by the book"" lawman who refuses to see things Jack's way even the wheels start coming off.  This was a tough role to pull off, and both the actor and the writers deserve extra credit here.  And of course you can't have a better villain than Jon Voight!>The resolution was just what it should have been.  No, Jack doesn't die (obviously, since there's another season after this one) but he comes as close as we've ever seen, and for once he has to depend on someone else to save him.  It's a touching moment.If you still don't have this set, buy it!  I have the regular DVD set and am very pleased with both the sound and the video quality. This was the season where we saw Jack come full circle, and actually get some closure at the end.

Every 24 fan has his or her favourite season. I liked them all. No other series had me sitting at the edge of my seat the way 24 did and still does. Jack Bauer is a unique character. You'll find bits and pieces of the character in various works but none as complete a character as Sutherland and the writers made Jack Bauer. It is my all time favourite show. Since 24 you will find a number of characters in TV, movies and books which emulate Jack Bauer--Jack Reacher, the lead character of Taken 1 and 2 and several others--but they fall short of Jack Bauer. He is the ultimate hero and anti-hero rolled into one. 24 is a work of fiction, first and foremost, but it explored security problems confronting all nations today regarding terrorism. It took an unflinching look at terrorism, at the escalating threat it posses. It is gritty and doesn't blink where violence is concerned. It posed hard questions and solutions in ways that are rarely portrayed on TV. I cannot recommend this propramme highly enough.

1150745,AP3B615GM191G,B0015QWZ8S,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In contrast to most critical and fan reviews of this show, I thoroughly enjoyed the sixth season of ""24"", yet did not get into ""Redemption"" at all. Thus, as I began the Seventh Season of perhaps the greatest TV show on TV today (LOST is about the only thing that probably beats it), I was a bit concerned about the quality of a season that would be building on the events that transpired in ""Redemption"".Of course, in typical ""24"" style, I should have never doubter the writers and actors...I was blown away!The seventh season opens with Jack Bauer in front of a Congressional Committee and on trial for torture. This provides the perfect transition into what would become a season of change for the show. Once Bauer finishes his business in front of the Senators who seem to be out to get him, he is called away to help an F.B.I. investigation in Washington. At this point in the show's timeline, CTU has been shut down for its reckless procedures, so the entire show has a bit of a different feel to it.Of course, Jack Bauer's task eventually leads him into the thick of a terrorist plot against the United States, and thus once again he is ""on point"" most of the time, with action scenes and surprising cliffhangers that rival any previous season.The true success of this season, though, was its ability to move the show into a new locale while still giving subtle nods to old friends. Renee Walker (played by Annie Wersching) and Larry Moss (Jeffrey Nordling) morph into very interesting F.B.I. agents over the course of the show, while Madame President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) more than holds her own in the tradition of David Palmer, Charles Logan, Wayne Palmer, and Noah Daniels.Plus, old friends such as Bill Buchanon, Chloe O'Brien, and Kim Bauer (in perhaps the most emotional story-arc of the season) make return appearances, as does Tony Almeida (although his status as friend or enemy is tough to decipher).Yet, as usual, the show really needs to be judged on the intensity/emotions of the Jack Bauer character, and the ability of the writers to inject genuine, thought-provoking political situations into each episode, and on both accounts this season succeeds with flying colors!Thus, even if (unlike me) you found Season Six to be a major disappointment, have no fear about purchasing the next installment of the show, as even I will admit that it was probably the best season in a few years. The only other TV show I have ever given 5-star ratings to in every season has been LOST, and that's some pretty fine company.",5,New Locale...Same Incredible Show,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2541,"['contrast', 'most', 'critical', 'fan', 'reviews', 'show', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'sixth', 'season', '24', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Redemption', 'Thus', 'began', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'TV', 'today', 'LOST', 'only', 'thing', 'probably', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'quality', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'building', 'events', 'transpired', 'Redemption', '.Of', 'course', 'typical', '24', 'style', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'doubter', 'writers', 'actors', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'seventh', 'season', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'front', 'Congressional', 'Committee', 'trial', 'torture', 'perfect', 'transition', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'season', 'change', 'show', 'Once', 'Bauer', 'business', 'front', 'Senators', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'out', 'get', 'called', 'away', 'help', 'F.B.I', 'investigation', 'Washington', 'point', 'show', 'timeline', 'CTU', 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'reckless', 'procedures', 'entire', 'show', 'bit', 'different', 'feel', 'it.Of', 'course', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'task', 'eventually', 'thick', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'United', 'States', 'thus', 'once', 'again', 'point', 'most', 'time', 'action', 'scenes', 'surprising', 'cliffhangers', 'rival', 'previous', 'season.The', 'true', 'success', 'season', 'though', 'was', 'ability', 'move', 'show', 'new', 'locale', 'still', 'giving', 'subtle', 'nods', 'old', 'friends', 'Renee', 'Walker', 'played', 'Annie', 'Wersching', 'Larry', 'Moss', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'morph', 'very', 'interesting', 'F.B.I', 'agents', 'course', 'show', 'Madame', 'President', 'Allison', 'Taylor', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'more', 'own', 'tradition', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'Wayne', 'Palmer', 'Noah', 'Daniels.Plus', 'old', 'friends', 'such', 'Bill', 'Buchanon', 'Chloe', ""O'Brien"", 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emotional', 'story-arc', 'season', 'make', 'return', 'appearances', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'status', 'friend', 'enemy', 'tough', 'decipher', '.Yet', 'usual', 'show', 'really', 'be', 'judged', 'intensity/emotions', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'character', 'ability', 'writers', 'inject', 'genuine', 'thought-provoking', 'political', 'situations', 'episode', 'accounts', 'season', 'flying', 'colors', 'Thus', 'even', 'found', 'Season', 'Six', 'be', 'major', 'disappointment', 'have', 'fear', 'purchasing', 'next', 'installment', 'show', 'even', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'few', 'years', 'only', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'given', '5-star', 'ratings', 'season', 'been', 'LOST', 'pretty', 'fine', 'company']",N/A
