1663871,A2Z7IMHSP2JTOR,B00E2U4EM4,"Dr.K ""Happy""","[2, 2]","As a paranormal investigator if someone described a house as &#34;paranormally active with violent entities&#34; this is what I would expect so see. I thought that the depictions of entities and their frightening antics were accurate. The paranormal is frightening in more ways than one--it affects all your senses--sight, sound, touch, smell. All of these were present in the action. I don't know how the director did it in so short a time period with so little to work with but he got me to like the lead actor, to feel what he went through, to identify with him, and feel empathy for him. The carefully selected details of the actor's leaving home, the gift of the lighter, the few words, to his arriving at the sight and taking off his jackets to accommodate the tool belt, then putting his jackets back on--all of these built a likable demeanor around the character. Cinematography was breathtaking although bleak. The flashlight and periods of darkness are real in a boarded up house. His fright was not over-the-top but in keeping with his rational character.",5,Among My Favorites,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1066,"['paranormal', 'investigator', 'someone', 'described', 'house', '34', 'paranormally', 'active', 'violent', 'entities', '34', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'so', 'see', 'thought', 'depictions', 'entities', 'frightening', 'antics', 'were', 'accurate', 'paranormal', 'frightening', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'senses', 'sight', 'sound', 'touch', 'smell', 'were', 'present', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'director', 'did', 'so', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'got', 'like', 'lead', 'actor', 'feel', 'what', 'went', 'identify', 'feel', 'empathy', 'carefully', 'selected', 'details', 'actor', 'leaving', 'home', 'gift', 'lighter', 'few', 'words', 'arriving', 'sight', 'taking', 'off', 'jackets', 'accommodate', 'tool', 'belt', 'then', 'putting', 'jackets', 'back', 'built', 'likable', 'demeanor', 'character', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'bleak', 'flashlight', 'periods', 'darkness', 'are', 'real', 'boarded', 'up', 'house', 'fright', 'was', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'keeping', 'rational', 'character']",N/A

1663873,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B00E2U4EM4,Ferdy,"[1, 1]","There were a few good moments in this otherwise comically bad very low budget movie. The man who plays the main character is actually a pretty good actor and the setting couldn't have been more perfect for a haunted house movie.  What really makes this the worst is the acting of the two women.  They appear on the verge of laughter even as they are delivering their most serious bits of dialogue.  It's hard to watch and even try to take it seriously.  Secondly, the special effects, especially of the children ghosts is as bad as my kid's Halloween make up.  It consists of a couple of dark circles under their eyes and a weird bit of twisting their mouths.  You really can't conjure up a scare with ghosts like those.  There are a few moments of absolute blackness on screen without even sound to indicate what's happening.  I seriously thought the movie had stalled and closed my browser.  I think the story here has potential if it were done by a studio with a bit more money to put behind it.  I can't really recommend it unless you're doing it for a laugh.",2,Maybe more like 2.5 stars,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1063,"['were', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'otherwise', 'comically', 'bad', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'setting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'perfect', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'worst', 'acting', 'two', 'women', 'appear', 'verge', 'laughter', 'even', 'are', 'delivering', 'most', 'serious', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'watch', 'even', 'try', 'take', 'seriously', 'Secondly', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'children', 'ghosts', 'as', 'bad', 'kid', 'Halloween', 'make', 'up', 'couple', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'weird', 'bit', 'twisting', 'mouths', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conjure', 'up', 'scare', 'ghosts', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'absolute', 'blackness', 'screen', 'even', 'sound', 'indicate', 'what', 'happening', 'seriously', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'stalled', 'closed', 'browser', 'think', 'story', 'here', 'potential', 'were', 'done', 'studio', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'doing', 'laugh']",N/A
