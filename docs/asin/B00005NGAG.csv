668420,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005NGAG,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[8, 9]","While this movie had a promising start, it sort of crumbled like a cookie by the middle.  Billed as a black comedy/suspense thriller, Beautiful Creatures stars Rachel Weisz and Susan Lynch and Petula and Dorothy, respectively.  At the outset we find both women are involved in abusive relationships with very despicable men.  Through a chance meeting, Dorothy intervenes, with an usual choice of a weapon, while Petula's boyfriend, Brian, is throttling her, and he is knocked unconscious.  Fearful of legal entanglements and repercussions, they drag him back to Dorothy's apartment and try to decide how to best proceed.  Brian regains consciousness, and while still suffering from too much drink, he falls and hits his head, ending his own life.  This sets up the rest of the movie, as the women have to now deal with a dead body.Now Brian, who is well off, works for his brother Ronnie, who is even more well off, so the women concoct a scheme to make it appear as if Brian has been kidnapped, and extort a large sum of money from Ronnie, in hopes of using that money to make a better life far away.  The scheme doesn't go as planned, as a crooked cop gets involved, along with Dorothy's boyfriend, to which they both develop plans of their own.  Complications abound, as the women try to stay on top of things, but eventually just end up riding out forces beyond their control.I thought the actor who played Ronnie was especially good, presenting a calm yet menacing character, someone you wouldn't want to upset.  He presented a very controlled exterior, but underneath you knew he was a dangerous man capable of providing a great deal of pain to those who crossed him.  His concern for his missing brother seemed genuine, but his motivation appeared more to punish those who would dare to mess with him or his family, and restore face to his family name.  I missed if he was 'connected' somehow, like a mob or something, but it certainly had that feel.  I would have liked to see him get more screen time, as he presented a very interesting character.Both Weisz and Lynch played their parts well, appearing as sort of helpless women trapped in abusive relationships, who find the strength in each other, realizing that they don't have to be victims.  Weisz looked a little off with her bleached hair, but when it was cut short, it looked much better.  I still prefer her with dark hair, but she is still an amazingly attractive woman.  Compared to Weisz, Lynch has a more understated beauty, a more earthy quality, but equally attractive.As I said before, the pacing kind of fell off around the middle, and there were some holes in the plot, but it's a fun ride.  As far as the ending, I was a little disappointed as I saw it coming.  All the threads got tied up neatly, with no surprises.  Not a lot of originality, but great photography, with the movie set and filmed in Glasgow, Scotland.  I was happy to see a fresh, interesting venue, providing a little extra spice to a decent meal.  Along with good photography, I thought the music used really helped create a proper mood for this movie.  One thing I really enjoyed about the score was it wasn't intrusive, and fit the scenes very well.The presentation is in wide screen, and is excellent, along with the audio.  There are the basic extras consisting of a trailer, production notes, and bios.  A solid movie, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend anyone go out of their way to see it, unless you've got a real thing for Rachel Weisz.  (I admit, she was the main reason I bought this)  And no, I didn't forget about the dog.  Seems I won't be able to get out of this review without mention Pluto (that's the dog's name in the movie), so I will say, for a minor character providing a key element in a number of scenes, he did quite well.  I would even go so far as to say his performance was 'finger lickin' good'.  (If you see the movie, you'll know what I mean)  Also, a number of reviews reference the movie Thelma and Louise in comparison to this movie, but I didn't, as I never saw it.  There was so much attention and hype around that movie at the time it came out, I got turned off to it.

Unsuccessful in her attempt to help, she is shoved aside into a construction site ... where she finds a wonderful lead pipe that finishes the trick.  Together, the women drag the dead man back to Dorothy's apartment, where they make initial plans to make the disappearance look like a kidnapping attempt ... but the machinations of a wilely detective inspector and the abusive man's father lead the girls to a wild series of events, each less predictable than the one before.Brilliantly photography, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES makes great use of the principals as well as a wonderful soundtrack to send this fancy little caper flick into its twists and turns.

Instead, this is a British murder movie, whose off-beat humor is more than offset by the occasional extreme brutality and misogynist viewpoints.Two women, both exploited and abused in different ways by their boyfriends, somehow accidentally team up and save each other from their boyfriends, killing said boyfriends in the process.  The boyfriend villains were too awful to endure,  and the women were sympathetic but it was too hard to watch their continued bad treatment by the men around them.  Instead of feeling empowered when they defended themselves, I ended up feeling sickened by not so much the actual violence killing the men, but the threatened horrific violence against the women!  I had to stop the film, and then deleted it from my account.To be a fan of this movie you will need a strong stomach, a thick skin about women's issues, and a high tolerance for violence.
