1091093,A1LKI2DJVA5ATE,B000TJBNHQ,A. King,"[6, 6]","I was never more than a very casual Stargate viewer, but am a fan of the SGU series so I have been tempted for a while to buy this series. I held back because of the reviews in here with regards to the damaged disks.Then Amazon took them off the market for a while before re-releasing them. Great I thought, they have sorted the problem of the scratched and pitted disks, now is the time to purchase this set - and at a great price.Alas the set arrived yesterday and I too am now the proud owner of the complete series of SG1 and the infamous scratched disks. They have to be seen by your own eyes to understand just how bad the disks are when they arrive. I have absolutely no clue as to why the disks are so scratched up and why they are still being distributed this way. I certainly cannot see how the packaging (as bad as it is) could have been able to do as much damage.It begs the question why are they being sent out this way? It is clearly a long term, problem; it beggars belief that there has been no solution offered. It must cost the distribution company a fortune in returned sets.However I have ordered another set, we can only hope these are better. I really do want this series so I intend to return each bad one until I get a good one. One of the other reasons I bought this set despite the bad press is the fact that I have always found Amazon to be second to none as far as returns go. I ordered in the confidence that if I got a bad set (which I did) then they would replace it without a problem.I will certainly add to this saga and let you know if and when I get a good set of 54 disks.EDIT: I have dropped my review from 3 stars to 1. I received multiple scratched sets and Amazon were a bit poor on their customer service with this one.",1,Great price - but I join the bad disc club.,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1760,"['was', 'never', 'more', 'very', 'casual', 'Stargate', 'viewer', 'am', 'fan', 'SGU', 'series', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'while', 'buy', 'series', 'held', 'back', 'reviews', 'here', 'regards', 'damaged', 'disks.Then', 'Amazon', 'took', 'off', 'market', 'while', 're-releasing', 'Great', 'thought', 'have', 'sorted', 'problem', 'scratched', 'pitted', 'disks', 'now', 'time', 'purchase', 'set', 'great', 'price.Alas', 'set', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'too', 'am', 'now', 'proud', 'owner', 'complete', 'series', 'SG1', 'infamous', 'scratched', 'disks', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'own', 'eyes', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'disks', 'are', 'when', 'arrive', 'have', 'absolutely', 'clue', 'why', 'disks', 'are', 'so', 'scratched', 'up', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'distributed', 'way', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'packaging', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'damage.It', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'being', 'sent', 'out', 'way', 'clearly', 'long', 'term', 'problem', 'belief', 'been', 'solution', 'offered', 'must', 'cost', 'distribution', 'company', 'fortune', 'returned', 'sets.However', 'have', 'ordered', 'set', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'better', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'series', 'so', 'intend', 'return', 'bad', 'one', 'get', 'good', 'one', 'One', 'other', 'reasons', 'bought', 'set', 'bad', 'press', 'fact', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Amazon', 'be', 'second', 'none', 'as', 'far', 'returns', 'go', 'ordered', 'confidence', 'got', 'bad', 'set', 'did', 'then', 'would', 'replace', 'problem.I', 'will', 'certainly', 'add', 'saga', 'let', 'know', 'when', 'get', 'good', 'set', '54', 'disks.EDIT', 'have', 'dropped', 'review', '3', 'stars', '1', 'received', 'multiple', 'scratched', 'sets', 'Amazon', 'were', 'bit', 'poor', 'customer', 'service', 'one']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

Ugh..and I spent 73 on this version. This makes my soul cry. But anyways, onto the review.This includes two dvd boolets that hold all the dvds of the series in the two books. I think its more like 5 seasons in one and 5 seasons in the other. Separated by a little booklet you can read about the series. What gets me about the book that you can read that comes with it, is that it has the cast on the first cover of the book, and richard dean anderson is NOT in the picture. I mean I know he left the show for personal reason at the end of what season 9 or 10?! But seriously?! You couldn't let him appear with the cast on the booklet? Wow low move sirs.Now I have a friend with this same box set, which is one reason I spent some time trying to find a good deal on this one myself. She told me herself that the lil dvd holders that hold the disc are made of cardboard and have in fact scracted her disc from being put in and taken out as much as she watches the series. Looking at the actual set up of the dvd disc holders, I can totally see this happening. So I've taken time to make sure I'm extra careful with my disc when taking them out of their holder and putting them back in.So in summary, good series, be careful not to scratch you disc when returning them to their cardboard sleeves, AND if you're smart and have a blu ray player...don't be like me and buy the dvd version...*sigh*",3,sg1,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1551,"['first', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'why', 'only', 'gave', '3', 'rating.I', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'sold', 'blu', 'ray', 'item', 'well', 'cheaper', 'price', 'Ugh..and', 'spent', '73', 'version', 'soul', 'cry', 'anyways', 'review.This', 'two', 'dvd', 'boolets', 'hold', 'dvds', 'series', 'two', 'books', 'think', 'more', '5', 'seasons', 'one', '5', 'seasons', 'other', 'Separated', 'little', 'booklet', 'can', 'read', 'series', 'What', 'book', 'can', 'read', 'cast', 'first', 'cover', 'book', 'richard', 'dean', 'anderson', 'NOT', 'picture', 'mean', 'know', 'left', 'show', 'personal', 'reason', 'end', 'what', 'season', '9', '10', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'appear', 'cast', 'booklet', 'Wow', 'low', 'move', 'sirs.Now', 'have', 'friend', 'same', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'reason', 'spent', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'one', 'myself', 'told', 'lil', 'dvd', 'holders', 'hold', 'disc', 'are', 'made', 'cardboard', 'have', 'fact', 'scracted', 'disc', 'being', 'put', 'taken', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'series', 'Looking', 'actual', 'set', 'dvd', 'disc', 'holders', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'happening', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'time', 'make', 'sure', ""'m"", 'extra', 'careful', 'disc', 'when', 'taking', 'holder', 'putting', 'back', 'in.So', 'summary', 'good', 'series', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'scratch', 'disc', 'when', 'returning', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', ""'re"", 'smart', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'buy', 'dvd', 'version', '*sigh*']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

1091101,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B000TJBNHQ,AverageReviewer,"[3, 4]","This is the longest running science fiction series of all time.  They originally made a movie based on this premise with Kurt Russell playing Col O'neilStargate (Ultimate Edition).The premise for the movie was simple, during the 1930s a group of archaeologists discover a ring shaped artifact buried in the Egyptian sands under rubble from the times of the Pharohs.  Fast forwarding 60 years or so, the gate is now in Cheyene mountain (a giant military complex under a mountain) and a group of scientists working for the government figure out that there's a way to activate the device by decyphering the symbols written around the ring and that a certain combination of symbols opens a gateway between Earth and another planet that looks like Egypt.  I won't spoil the movie but a team goes through and finds aliens and all kinds of adventure.  This was very much the premise for the original movie.  Its worth watching.The TV series was originally made for HBO and featured the Mcguyver himself Richard Dean Anderson playing Col Jack O'neil.  The series features a great cast of supporting characters like Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks.  The series also had the great plus of featuring Don S. Davis whom I consider to be a phenomenal actor  Beau Bridges succeeds Don S. Davis in the latter part of the series and Ben Browder takes over for Richard Dean Anderson in the later seasons when Richard Dean Anderson becomes so obscenely wealthy (partially owning the franchise) that he doesn't need to work much.  Overall, the series is made wonderful by the spectactular chemistry and interraction of this case of characters mentioned above along with some of the minor characters that over the series become very memorable like the gate technician Master Sergeant Walter played by Gary Jones.Overall, the premise of stargate is that about a year after the events of the theatrical movie, gate experts like Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks figure out that the gate doesn't just lead to one planet (the original planet visited by the characters of the movie) but rather the stargate can be used to ""dial out to"" and is connected to  tens of thousands (perhaps millions or tens of millions) of gates located on planets throughout our galaxy.  Stargate teams SG-1 thru SG-XX are formed to go out into the galaxy.The series follows the exploits of the Flagship team SG-1 headed by Col O'neil.  Needless to say, the possibilities for the show were tremendous and the premise also lends itself very nicely to television because our heros don't need spaceships to go places, they just dial to another world and viola! they're in some beautiful Vancouver forest.  This leads to a series that can be kept in budget rather easily.  However, since this series was originally HBO they had some great budgets to begin with and they did start to dabble with spaceships and the like early on.  As the series became more and more popular the special effects became much better particularly by seasons 5 - 10.Over the course of 10 seasons and 10 years, over 200 episodes are filmed with multiple complex story arcs and numerous standalone adventures.  The series holds extremely well together.  It has action, adventure, drama, a dash of comedy and a dash of romance - great formula.I must say that I never watches this series at the beginning because it was on HBO and I didn't have HBO so sometime around season 5 they began releasing DVD sets of the series and I got entirely hooked on it.  I must say that I might never had been hooked if not for the sets which allow you to see the entire series back to back which makes it much easier for you to follow the great story arcs.  Sad to say, I spent many an hour watching this series.The Stargate series spun off a sister series Stargate AtlantisStargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4which ran for 5 seasons although I haven't found a complete set yet.  Atlantis was based a team which heads off to another galaxy because they discover that the stargate can be used to dial gates in another galaxy (albeit using a ton of power) so they can't just go back and forth between galaxies easily.  So a team goes off to another galaxy and sets off a base.  The premise is very similar to Stargate SG-1 and focuses heavily on the chemistry and interraction by the team.The Stargate series also spun off a couple of moviesStargate - The Ark of TruthandStargate: Continuumwhich I found to be nice capstones to the series.The Stargate franchise also launched Stargate Infiniti (an animated series based on the show)Stargate Infinity: The Complete Series.Finally, there's a new television series planned called Stargate Universe.I can't say enough good things about the series but it is definitely larger than life and very grand in scope but homey in its own set of ways.  I love the SG1 series the best followed closely by Atlantis.Regarding the packaging for this series, I love the fact that its so compact - it takes up a lot less space than the packaging for the individual series.  I've never had any problems that some have reported (I might have been lucky or they fixed whatever problems they had).Enjoy watching the longest running and most successful TV series out there.  This stands up there with the Star Trek franchise.",5,If you've never seen stargate - Fantastic Series,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,5270,"['longest', 'running', 'science', 'fiction', 'series',

1091102,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B000TJBNHQ,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[0, 1]","The original cast, specifically Sam, Daniel, Teal'C, and O'Niell (plus Hammond and Dr. Frasier) are easily the best gelling of the casts. Not that I disliked Mitch (O'Niell's replacement), Quinn (Daniel's temporary replacement), Dr. Lamm (Dr. Frasier's replacement), or Landry (Hammond's replacement), but they never quite worked for me the way our original and longest running quartet plus worked for me. And at times I quite liked Valla, though I question her being placed on SG-1. Especially because it is odd to see five instead of four.What I loved most about the series is they way they took myths about Gods from different cultures and explained how they came about. Sure, there were the Goa'uld pretending to be Gods in order to enslave people and use them as hosts, but there were also the Norse Gods, portrayed by some friendly grey aliens (so Roswell is real!) as well as some gods on other planets who weren't what they seemed.There was also the surprises, such as with the Nox, who are anything but what they seem, technologically and otherwise. With the Goa'uld ability to take over a person with little or no sign (plus mind control and the many other entities that could take over a person's mind and/or body), you never quite knew who to trust.Whether or not I agree with the idea that people couldn't handle knowing that aliens are out there...is mostly besides the point. They deal with the issue a few times, but it is rarely actually addressed as a true debate and is more an issue of the Stargate people making sure the secret is kept.The most surprising aspect of the show is how much it concerns itself with politics and corruption. This is a theme that runs through all three series of the show. There are always people/governments/organizations who want to subvert the Stargate program and the technology procured for their own purposes. Sometimes, they truly believe they are doing the right thing. And sometimes you can't help but wonder if the seemingly more fanatic groups might be right, even if just a teeny-tiny bit...Sometimes the show got goofy. Sometimes it even made fun of its own goofiness (Sam's on screen love interests always die, Daniel always dies, TV shows made about the show itself within the show, etc), which is always appreciated. Perfect quote:I'm thinking I can back-sell it and say you were beamed out at the last second. [Martin]Is that not too convenient? [Teal'c]Not if you hang a lantern on it. It's a writer's term. Another character points out how convenient it is. That way the audience knows I intended for it to be convenient, and we move on. [Martin]But for all it's goofiness, there are some serious moments. The way they dealt with Dr. Frasier's death, for one, was extremely well handled.The only thing I wish they had done, was kill someone off on the main cast for good. It was a little too (dare I say it) convenient, that the cast, especially Daniel, was always brought back to life after he died. There was never a concern for serious consequences because no one we really cared about ever actually died. Which seems surprising considering how powerful some of the people we were dealing with were.I greatly appreciate the way they bring in characters from previous episodes, either by mention or by actually bringing them in. For example, we see Sam bond with Cassandra, the little girl whose home was destroyed by the Goa'uld and though Sam isn't the one to adopt her, she comes up a few more times and is mentioned even more often than that. (There was a little disappointment that we never got confirmation of a Sam-O'Niell relationship, but not exactly a surprise either.)The biggest question I had from this series stemmed from a set design choice.

Forget the whole issue of what if you're attacked and one of the flames gets knocked over...isn't it an unnecessary stress on life support?

1091103,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000TJBNHQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 2]","During it's extraordinary 10-year run, ""Stargate SG-1"" was never taken seriously by either it's critics, or by many in the industry, itself. The concensus opinion was that it lacked the nostalgic value of ""Star Trek"", off-beat imagination of ""Farscape"", or gritty drama of the updated ""Battlestar Galactica"" or even it's own spin-off, ""Stargate Atlantis"", and that it was little more than lightweight weekly silliness. This is a shame, and completely unwarranted; after viewing the entire series, in ""Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection"", I can honestly say I've seldom enjoyed myself more!It's hard to keep a review of a ten-season collection brief, but allow me to single out praise to Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright, who took the framework of the original ""Stargate"" movie, and actually improved upon it, adding terrific characters (Amanda Tapping as brilliant Air Force officer Samantha Carter, and Christopher Judge as stoic alien warrior, Teal'c), finding an actor equally as gifted as the film's James Spader, for the role of Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), and, best of all, allowing Richard Dean Anderson to cut loose in the Kurt Russell role of Jack O'Neill (""Two 'L's...there's another guy who spells it with one 'L'...too serious, no fun at all...""). In enlarging the premise, through the introduction of a system of Stargates, the series opened a rich vein of story opportunities, with our heroes battling a pantheon of advanced aliens posing as false 'gods', in a multitude of cultures. Episodes ranged from somber drama, to edgy suspense, and swashbuckling adventure, with even an occasional near-slapstick comedy tossed in (although the comic interludes could be a bit self-serving, at times). Making things even better was the series' present-day setting, giving viewers an increased sense of involvement, as well as the dramatic possibilities of current global politics (wonderfully personified by guest appearances by Ronny Cox and William Devane). The special effects were extraordinary (that the series was never honored for them in America is beyond comprehension!), and the score, by Joel Goldsmith, frequently enchanting.Most remarkably, the series never lost a beat when Anderson, and key supporting star Don S. Davis, left the series (other than occasional 'guest' appearances). Anderson's replacement, ""Farscape's"" Ben Browder, proved every bit as funny, physical, and charismatic, and Beau Bridges, as the new boss, combined Davis' authority with a warmth uniquely his own. The addition of another ""Farscape"" alum, Claudia Black, increased both the humor and sexiness of the proceedings, as a fast-talking alien con woman, wrapped up in both the storyline, and Daniel Jackson's life. These last two seasons, with the near-omnipotent Ori, Arthurian legends, and intergalactic battles, is heady stuff, indeed, despite a few 'clunker' episodes!Tons of Special Features, fascinating episode commentaries, even fan convention footage with cast members, all enrich the collection, lifting it far above nearly every other series compilation you can buy. I should warn you, however, if you plan on viewing this with small children, the pilot episode does have full-frontal female nudity (I believe Showtime, where it first aired, hoped to market the series as more 'adult'...a decision which, thankfully, never went any further than the pilot).This collection isn't cheap, but is worth every penny if you love a great adventure series with an outstanding cast.""Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection"" has a prized place in my growing collection of DVDs!",5,"Underrated, Long-Running SciFi Series Deserves Respect!",1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,3600,"['extraordinary', '10-year', 'run', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'was', 'never', 'taken', 'seriously', 'critics', 'many', 'industry', 'concensus', 'opinion', 'was', 'lacked', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'Star', 'Trek', 'off-beat', 'imagination', 'Farscape', 'gritty', 'drama', 'updated', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'even', 'own', 'spin-off', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'lightweight', 'weekly', 'silliness', 'shame', 'completely', 'unwarranted', 'viewing', 'entire', 'series', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seldom', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'hard', 'keep', 'review', 'ten-season', 'collection', 'brief', 'allow', 'single', 'out', 'praise', 'Jonathan', 'Glassner', 'Brad', 'Wright', 'who', 'took', 'framework', 'original', 'Stargate', 'movie', 'actually', 'improved', 'adding', 'terrific', 'characters', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'brilliant', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer', 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'stoic', 'alien', 'warrior', 'Teal', 'c', 'finding', 'actor', 'equally', 'as', 'gifted', 'film', 'James', 'Spader', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'best', 'allowing', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'cut', 'loose', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'role', 'Jack', ""O'Neill"", 'Two', 'L', 'guy', 'who', 'one', 'L', 'too', 'serious', 'fun', 'enlarging', 'premise', 'introduction', 'system', 'Stargates', 'series', 'opened', 'rich', 'vein', 'story', 'opportunities', 'heroes', 'battling', 'pantheon', 'advanced', 'aliens', 'posing', 'false', ""'gods"", 'multitude', 'cultures', 'Episodes', 'ranged', 'somber', 'drama', 'edgy', 'suspense', 'swashbuckling', 'adventure', 'even', 'occasional', 'near-slapstick', 'comedy', 'tossed', 'comic', 'interludes', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'self-serving', 'times', 'Making', 'things', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'series', 'present-day', 'setting', 'giving', 'viewers', 'increased', 'sense', 'involvement', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'current', 'global', 'politics', 'wonderfully', 'personified', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'William', 'Devane', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'extraordinary', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'honored', 'America', 'comprehension', 'score', 'Joel', 'Goldsmith', 'frequently', 'enchanting.Most', 'remarkably', 'series', 'never', 'lost', 'beat', 'when', 'Anderson', 'key', 'supporting', 'star', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'left', 'series', 'other', 'occasional', ""'guest"", 'appearances', 'Anderson', 'replacement', 'Farscape', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'proved', 'bit', 'funny', 'physical', 'charismatic', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'new', 'boss', 'combined', 'Davis', 'authority', 'warmth', 'uniquely', 'own', 'addition', 'Farscape', 'alum', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'increased', 'humor', 'sexiness', 'proceedings', 'fast-talking', 'alien', 'con', 'woman', 'wrapped', 'up', 'storyline', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'life', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'near-omnipotent', 'Ori', 'Arthurian', 'intergalactic', 'battles', 'heady', 'stuff', 'indeed', 'few', ""'clunker"", 'episodes', 'Tons', 'Special', 'Features', 'fascinating', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'even', 'fan', 'convention', 'footage', 'cast', 'members', 'enrich', 'collection', 'lifting', 'far', 'nearly', 'other', 'series', 'compilation', 'can', 'buy', 'should', 'warn', 'however', 'plan', 'viewing', 'small', 'children', 'pilot', 'episode', 'have', 'full-frontal', 'female', 'nudity', 'believe', 'Showtime', 'where', 'first', 'aired', 'hoped', 'market', 'series', 'more', ""'adult"", 'decision', 'thankfully', 'never', 'went', 'further', 'pilot', '.This', 'collection', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'worth', 'penny', 'love', 'great', 'adventure', 'series', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'prized', 'place', 'growing', 'collection', 'DVDs']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

1091106,A3QD53AJRM3J7F,B000TJBNHQ,Bill,"[1, 1]","I purchased mine through a different vendor and the set I recieved had very little damage. I'm halfway through the series and have found only one disk with scratches and it worked fine in my bluray player.I won't comment on the series itself since most people probably already have an opinion in that regard. Nor will I rate the packaging as that has been discussed ad nauseum. Instead I'm going to evaluate the way it was compiled and published.Pros: It's all here. Plenty of supplimental material(featurettes, commentary). Episode guide book w/ brief synopses that aren't spoilers for the newcomers yet provide enough info for established fans to identify the desired episode.Cons: The early seasons, originally broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio, were cropped to 16:9. I would have prefered to see them in their OAR. Less is more and there would be many fewer foreheads being chopped off. It appears, though, that the producers gradually began framing it for 16:9 even while they were still being broadcast in 4:3.The pilot and most of the first seasons had fairly poor video quality. Some looked like it had a lot of compression artifacts. It may also be the cameras they used early on. Later seasons(3 or so and beyond)show significant improvement in PQ.In addition to the scratch issues already sited by so many, the early season(s) disks also seem to be slightly out of balance and cause my players to vibrate. It's not enough to keep them from playing but very noticeable audibly. It makes me a little concerned about wear & tear on my players.Finally, the chapter points are seemingly random or each episode was divided into equal length chapters rather than at commercial breaks as is traditional w/ tv series box sets. If, after you've seen the title sequence 20 or more times and you want to skip past it now, it will not jump to the end of the title but several minutes into the next act.Conclusion: I'm very satisfied with this set but I'm not totally w/out reservations. Because of the packaging issues I've decided to store the set in a different storage solution.

1091108,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B000TJBNHQ,Brandon J. Smith,"[15, 15]","Before saying anything else, there is one inescapable issue with this set, and it is well-documented through other reviews: This is, without a doubt, the worst packaging of any series I've ever encountered. The outer box is attractive, and it looks great on my shelf, but that's the only positive thing I can say. You can't just open it like a normal box; you have to lift the entire thing off the base, so it's inconvenient to do that every time you want to access a disc. Once open, that's when the real horror is revealed. The discs are held in the worst possible way, as though the designers were trying to ruin discs and make it as horrible for the user as possible. It's so bad that Amazon added a warning about it in bold print near the price listings. It's simply an embarrassment. I was lucky, though: Taking the advice of another reviewer, I purchased some disc-sleeves and carefully placed each disc in one, inspecting them for scratches as I went. Fortunately - miraculously - nothing got scratched, and I was able to watch the series without technical difficulties. So, if you do get this set, keep in mind that you'll have this issue to contend with. For me, I took the risk, payed a little bit extra for sleeves, and it paid off. I got a great deal on a tremendous series. For others, the packaging led to damaged goods, and it was not worth their troubles.Some more background on my perspective: Before purchasing this set, I'd never seen an episode of the show. In fact, I'd avoided it. Catching glimpses of it here and there, it never looked very good to me. I had seen the original film, though, and after years of watching Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, and other shows, I wanted to try something different, and I figured a show that ran for ten seasons must be better than I'd given it credit for in the past. Also, I am a huge Farscape fan. When I heard that Ben Browder and Claudia Black were on the last two seasons, I was sure that I needed to see this show.All that said, I reach the first point I'd like to make: Stargate SG-1, in my view, is two different shows. The first one ran for eight seasons. The second, after an unexpected renewal by the network, ran for two. Both are excellent, but they are clearly distinct from each other. The most obvious aspect is that Richard Dean Anderson left the show after the eighth season, and he was the first among equals when it came to the starring cast, even if his role was limited during particularly the seventh season. The other is that they wrapped up the main storylines at the end of the eighth season, not anticipating a ninth or tenth. New story arcs came about to go along with the updated cast, so it has the feel of a spin-off at least as much as a continuation.I watched SG-1 just about every night for eight months. I would watch one episode a night, in general, occasionally watching two or skipping a night for various reasons. Going through ten seasons, it never got old. Not every episode was a masterpiece, but few were really bad. Most ranged from good to outstanding.I love that they don't recreate the original movie. Instead, they go a year into the future, recast the two lead roles, and take things from there. It's a great way to get a running start in the series premiere. (Notably, there's a scene with full-frontal nudity in the first episode, but you can get the revised ""Children of the Gods"" on a separate DVD. There's even a set with that and the two post-finale movies that were made.)Every science-fiction show has some hurdles to contend with. The main one, by far, is the Star Trek comparison. You simply cannot make a sci-fi show and not have it compared to the various incarnations of Star Trek. It set the template, so now shows have to either accept certain conventions or make choices to differentiate their own creation. Farscape, for example, had the concepts of a living ship and bacteria that acted as the ""universal translator."" Stargate SG-1 has the original movie giving it its foundation, but to become a series it had to do adopt some television conventions. In many ways, I do think Stargate is derivative, pulling influences from other sci-fi programs, but they always have a nice twist to make it fit well to this individual series. The stargate itself is a network of wormholes, which we'd seen in Deep Space 9 and Babylon 5; the rings are a new take on the transporter; the zat guns are a particular type of phaser. Add into the mix the occasional actor known for roles on Star Trek, and I think SG-1 reveals that it's aware of its influences and embraces the plethora of science fiction that came before.It helps immensely that the show has so much humor and a great set of lead actors. I didn't particularly care for Teryl Rothery as Dr. Fraser, and Don S. Davis' General Hammond too often did little more than say, ""you have a go,"" but they were typically peripheral to the adventures of the SG-1 team, and each certainly had their moments over the years. Richard Dean Anderson brought a ton of charisma and humor to the show. It took me a little while to stop seeing him as MacGyver, but eventually I was able to embrace him wholly as Jack O'Neal. Michael Shanks also managed to make the role of Daniel Jackson his own. Characters that hadn't been in the original movie, Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter and Christopher Judge as Teal'c, also become deep and interesting as the series progresses. Corin Nemec did well in his one season as Quinn. It's too bad they didn't find a way to keep him involved. I also found the additions of Ben Browder and Claudia Black to be a great way to inject some interesting new energy and ideas into the final two seasons.Also key to the show's success was its rotation of guest stars, particularly Tony Amendola and Carmen Agenziano. Many of the one-off guest stars were only so-so, but SG-1 had a great set of recurring characters that would show up once in a while to help out or make trouble, like Ronny Cox's Senator Kinsey and Tom McBeath's Harry Maybourne.As with Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1 dealt with trouble both ""off-world"" and at home. I never found the Earthbound political issues as compelling as the adventures on the other side of the stargate, but it was great that the show was willing to call into question the motives and occasional hypocrisy of our own government. Also like B5, there seemed to be a focus on the Americans and Russians without much, if any, mention of other Earth cultures. It fits with the notion of which countries were involved with the space race, but sometimes I wondered why the show never touched on those modern cultures, especially since it dealt so heavily with ancient cultures and religions.And that's another aspect Stargate did so well: using ancient religious beliefs and mythologies to drive storylines. It's very secular viewpoint clashed against the ""false gods"" that abound in our history and (in the universe of the show) were really just powerful aliens playing gods. Occasionally, it veered into the realm of straw man arguments against believing in false gods, but generally this was avoided, as fighting these aliens was so central to the overall plot of the series.So, this set gets four stars from me. I have to deduct one star due to the egregious packaging flaw (though, if the discs arrive without scratches, you can get past it by investing a few extra bucks in disc sleeves, which you can then store in the box). Other than the packaging issue, the series itself deserves five stars for sure. It's got action, wonder, intriguing ideas, and, most of all, characters that are worth spending ten long seasons with. I'm happy to add it to my list of must-see sci-fi series along with Star Trek, TNG, DS9, B5, Battlestar Galactica, and Farscape.",4,"An Epic, Extraordinary Series",1370995200,"06 12,

My wife was a bigger fan of Farscape at the time but she came around to this series too. This is by far the best thing since the classic Star Trek. And for current SciFi there is no better. Even after ten years it could have continued to run successfully. Even the Stargate Atlantis spin-off could have went longer. Stargate Universe coming up now on the SyFy channel has big shoes to fill. When this series first came out on DVD each season ran as much as seventy-five dollars in some stores. The lowest I think I got it then was around fifty-two dollars so you can see getting ten seasons for only a little over one hundred dollars is a bargain. The series has something for everyone young to old. I highly recommend the series, but I am not sure the price warrants celebration as several viewers indicated problems with the discs. The quality of the DVDs may only be fair but the replayability of the series is excellent. I would imagine if Richard Dean Anderson and MGM had anything to say about the DVD disc and box quality this would be another matter and it wouldn't be piece worked out to some dirty third world slave shop. So although I paid a bit more, I'm glad I got mine in the individual slim cases a few years ago when they were done right. I think you should grab the individual seasons in the thinpacksStargate SG-1 Season 1  (Thinpak)while you can before they goe OOP.

Still, that's not entirely a slam, but a reflection of the fact that early on, there wasn't enough money to do anything else.The series grew and embraced numerous aspects of humor, social and ethical commentary and always entertainment. Some episodes are tear jerkers, while others are hilarious. Very few of them were awful, though when they were bad, they were hideous.One recurring issue was language. How is it that most cultures spoke English? Well, they didn't. The stargate had to recondition the minds of people to communicate, just as it had the power to transport, but it was never explained. In one episode, a visiting Tollan commented on the word ""triad"" being very similar to the word ""trial."" Well, that he was speaking English was far more remarkable than the similarity of two words! It's like the story of the fellow who, after being beheaded, picked up his head and walked a thousand paces. It wasn't the thousand paces that was so remarkable as the notion that he was able to walk one! If one can accept that he picked up his head and walked one pace, accepting the other 999 isn't so difficult!Having said that, the series is well worth owning. I noticed that using the ""zoom"" control of my DVD player, that the image doesn't have a great resolution. At 2x you can really see the image degradation. I'm going through the entire 10 seasons now and am having a ball. I don't like Season 6 (?) where Daniel was replaced by an ""alien"" that spoke better English than I do and was so culturally dissimilar as to be ridiculous. In my view, it came too close to the line of suspension of disbelief. (Actually it's the suspension of belief, not vice versa!) I didn't really even like the guy, anyway. And killing Daniel never got old, as the writers never lost a night's sleep over how to bring him back. (He died and came back even more than Spock!)The pilot CHILDREN OF THE GODS was reworked and is far superior to the one in this collection, but you have to buy that separately. The time travel stories also were quite good. As always, there are paradoxes, but the writers came as close as anyone can.Buy the series.

I also liked the original movie Stargate, so I was very pleased with the SG-1 series.  The series collection is very nice and as others have said there is some minor scratching evident on a few of the discs.  This is most likely due to the way they are packaged.  The sleeves in which the disc appears to be the cause of the scratches, as some of the discs must rub a bit during transit, causing the scratches.  I haven't checked these discs yet to find out if this is a problem, but I am sure Amazon will exchange them is a disc is not working.  I have a buffer device that can buff out the scratches as they are minor, so I am not too worried about them.

1091127,A5T08I564I0D5,B000TJBNHQ,"DeeJaye6 ""- DeeJaye6""","[10, 14]","MGM and Fox dropped the ball on this set.  The first nine seasons lack a ""Play all"" feature.  The first 2 seasons bump you back out to the main episode list to select the next episode, but then seasons 3-9 only take you back to the episode menu, forcing you to go back to the list before selecting the next episode.  Not a big deal for one episode, but after about 100 eps, you get really sick of it.Another gripe?  The DVD authoring ad shows at the end of EVERY episode for the first 6 or so seasons.  Every one!  Most TV shows on DVD manage to put that at the end of the final ep on the disc.  It took MGM/Fox about 6 or 7 years to figure that one out.Lastly, the title sequence is nearly a full minute long.  After you've seen it about a dozen times, you just want to skip over it.  Tough luck.  If you hit Next Chapter, it skips over the Title Sequence *and* the first act!  You have to scan through it, possible overshooting and having to back up.  It stays that way for seasons 1 through 9.Season 10 finally included a ""play all"" feature, and finally allowed us to easily skip the title sequence with ""Next Chapter.""None of these by themselves are enough to make me unhappy with this set, but combined altogether?  Crappy.As for the show itself, the first 8 seasons are fairly solid.  It's a better show in many respects than most other sci-fi out there.  For example, in Star Trek: TNG, if a new way of doing something was discovered in an episode (such as using a strand of hair from when you were 25 to make the transporter turn you young again?), it was never again spoken of.  Not so in SG-1!  If they learned something useful, expect that they *will* use it!  And if they don't, you can be sure that there will be an explanation.Unfortunately, the show makes a turn for the worst in 9th and 10th seasons.  I will not put any spoilers here; suffice to say that the team ends up trying to solve their newest crisis, but-- ooooo, shiny!!  It's as if the writers just couldn't fill the last two seasons with enough substance so we end up with more throw-away episodes than there should be (especially 4 of the last *5* episodes of the entire series!!).  At the end of the last episode, I found myself wanting those 30 hours of watching seasons 9 and 10 back.  And no, that's not a math error.  There are only 20 episodes each in 9th and 10th season.  Also, if you have not seen Stargate: Atlantis, there are a lot of spoilers for that show in these last 2 seasons (including a real doozy!).Last complaint?  The ""Stargate: SG-1"" logo in my ""gate"" on my box?  It's at a 10-degree list.  (Means it's crooked.)  And it's noticeable, too!  I wrote to MGM to see if I could get a replacement box cover and the jerks never wrote back.Overall, I was pleased with the series.  But I strongly suggest you stop at the end of 8th Season.  You will be better off for it.",3,"Good Show, Crappy DVDs (NO Spoilers)",1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,2865,"['MGM', 'Fox', 'dropped', 'ball', 'set', 'first', 'nine', 'seasons', 'lack', 'Play', 'feature', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'bump', 'back', 'main', 'episode', 'list', 'select', 'next', 'episode', 'then', 'seasons', '3-9', 'only', 'take', 'back', 'episode', 'menu', 'forcing', 'go', 'back', 'list', 'selecting', 'next', 'episode', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'episode', '100', 'eps', 'get', 'really', 'sick', 'it.Another', 'gripe', 'DVD', 'authoring', 'ad', 'shows', 'end', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'first', '6', 'so', 'seasons', 'one', 'Most', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'manage', 'put', 'end', 'final', 'ep', 'disc', 'took', 'MGM/Fox', '6', '7', 'years', 'figure', 'one', 'out.Lastly', 'title', 'sequence', 'nearly', 'full', 'minute', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'skip', 'Tough', 'luck', 'hit', 'Next', 'Chapter', 'Title', 'Sequence', '*and*', 'first', 'act', 'have', 'scan', 'possible', 'overshooting', 'having', 'back', 'up', 'way', 'seasons', '1', '9.Season', '10', 'finally', 'included', 'play', 'feature', 'finally', 'allowed', 'easily', 'skip', 'title', 'sequence', 'Next', 'Chapter', 'None', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'unhappy', 'set', 'combined', 'altogether', 'Crappy.As', 'show', 'first', '8', 'seasons', 'are', 'fairly', 'solid', 'better', 'show', 'many', 'respects', 'most', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'there', 'example', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'new', 'way', 'doing', 'something', 'was', 'discovered', 'episode', 'such', 'using', 'strand', 'hair', 'when', 'were', '25', 'make', 'transporter', 'turn', 'young', 'again', 'was', 'never', 'again', 'spoken', 'Not', 'so', 'SG-1', 'learned', 'something', 'useful', 'expect', '*will*', 'use', 'do', ""n't"", 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'explanation.Unfortunately', 'show', 'turn', 'worst', '9th', '10th', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'put', 'spoilers', 'here', 'suffice', 'say', 'team', 'up', 'trying', 'solve', 'newest', 'crisis', 'ooooo', 'shiny', 'writers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'fill', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'enough', 'substance', 'end', 'up', 'more', 'throw-away', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'especially', '4', 'last', '*5*', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'found', 'wanting', '30', 'hours', 'watching', 'seasons', '9', '10', 'back', 'not', 'math', 'error', 'are', 'only', '20', 'episodes', '9th', '10th', 'season', 'Also', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'are', 'lot', 'spoilers', 'show', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'including', 'real', 'doozy', '.Last', 'complaint', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'logo', 'gate', 'box', '10-degree', 'list', 'Means', 'crooked', 'noticeable', 'too', 'wrote', 'MGM', 'see', 'could', 'get', 'replacement', 'box', 'cover', 'jerks', 'never', 'wrote', 'back.Overall', 'was', 'pleased', 'series', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'stop', 'end', '8th', 'Season', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

Gabe told me the other day that he actually loves the Stargate universe more than the Star Trek universe. He never thought anything would supplant Star Trek, but it's happened. I have to agree 100%. This series is fantastic. Humor, drama, social commentary (but not in a heavy-handed way), great sci-fi, in-jokes, and characters you will come to love. We not only own this full set, but have given it as a gift as well. We also have it electronically to take with us on the go.

All I can say is that if you enjoy it even a tenth as much as we do, you're going to be thrilled that you bought it.We DID have a problem with an audio track on one of the 54 discs. I think it was in season 7. We were a little worried since it had been quite a while since we'd bought it (we were watching them in order that first time), but Amazon was great about it. The CSR understood completely that 54 was just too many discs to be able to quickly check out. They replaced the disc quickly and conveniently. I know I've read lots of people's stories of their horrible experiences with Customer Service here at Amazon, but I have to say that every time I've contacted them, my issues have been resolved fairly quickly and so far satisfactorily.Edit: Someone pointed out that my review made it sound like Amazon plucked out a single disc from a collection of Stargate discs and sent it to us. I apologize for that. We got a replacement of the collection we'd bought, checked the disc that was faulty in our set, and since we had seen the series at that point and knew all our other discs were fine we put the damaged one in with the rest of the replacement set and sent it back.

1091133,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000TJBNHQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[262, 298]","Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), but such wasn't the case with ""Stargate SG-1."" Starting as a simple exploration series, the series expanded into a brilliant tangle of politics, aliens, and Earth's spirit and guts -- excellent writing, acting, and a sense of humor about itself and its characters.The Stargate has been inactive for a year. Then a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap an officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement, and sends him to Abydos to find out what happened. O'Neill is reunited with Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) -- only to have Daniel's wife and brother-in-law abducted by the evil Apophis. A rescue attempt sparks off a war with the Goa'uld -- aliens who have been impersonating human gods for many centuries.So the team SG-1 -- made up of O'Neill, Jackson, scientist/pilot Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Apophis' ex-slave Teal'c (Christopher Judge) -- explore through the Stargate, finding plenty of hostile aliens, strange allies (the Unas, the Asgard), and humans scattered all over. Not to mention the gate-builders, who have ascended to another plane.Frst they battle the arrogant Apophis, then the devil-imitating So'kar, and the malignant half-energy Anubis and his army of undead warriors. The Goa'uld power structure starts to splinter, and new secret organizations make power plays on Earth, as SG-1 uncovers the hidden legacies of humanity's ancestors.Even after the Goa'uld storyline ends, things haven't ended for SG-1. Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) is given command of SG-1, and manages to gather the disbanded team back together, with the help of a quirky alien mercenary, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black). Together, they find that the Milky Way faces its most deadly threat ever -- the Ori, evil ascended beings who demand that everyone worship them... or else.Previously all ""exploration"" sci-fi focused on people on ships. ""Stargate"" avoids the usual space opera approach -- even when ships are introduced, the main focus is on walking through a big stone ring. It's also full of real military, political battles (both on and off Earth), and a very plausible reason why everybody in the galaxy (more or less) looks just like us.It's graced with elaborate, opulant sets, solid special effects, shoot-'em-up action from Marines and Air Force, and some truly kinetic space battles (including one that resembles the climax of ""Star Wars IV""). The storyline stumbles somewhat in the last two seasons, with the sudden switch in villains and cast. But all ten seasons are sprinkled with very warm human moments -- Daniel's farewell to his wife, Sam bonding with a doomed little girl, and Teal'c's struggle for freedom.Best of all is the snappy script. Some of it comes from Teal'c (""Undomesticated equines could not remove me""), but mostly from the tart-tongued O'Neill (""Well, I guess we all start shooting. There's blood, death, hard feelings... it'd suck""). Other characters get great lines too ("" I think the circle means 'the place of our legacy'...or it could be 'a piece of our leg', but the first seems to make more sense"").The cast is nothing short of brilliant -- Anderson does a quirky, disrespectful, pop culture-lovin' guy with a hidden tragic past, while Tapping and Shanks are great as an enthusiastic geek and a smart, capable military woman. And Judge is absolutely astounding as Teal'c, who slowly turns from a stoic, tragic warrior to a warm legendary hero.Corin Nemec had a one-season stint as Daniel's ""replacement,"" and he makes a nice, eager young newbie, and Ben Browder channels much of O'Neill's quirkiness when Anderson left. Black is kind of annoying at times, but she's admittedly quite funny and quirky, with a tragic past of her own.""Stargate SG-1"" is undeniably the best TV spinoff, and one of the best ""exploration"" shows to make it onto the air... and stay there for a whole decade. Definitely worth seeing, from beginning to end.",5,Enter the Stargate,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,4038,"['Most', 'TV', 'shows', 'spun', 'off', 'movies', 'are', 'uninvolving', 'uninteresting', 'Blade', 'anyone', 'such', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Starting', 'simple', 'exploration', 'series', 'series', 'expanded', 'brilliant', 'tangle', 'politics', 'aliens', 'Earth', 'spirit', 'guts', 'excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'sense', 'humor', 'characters.The', 'Stargate', 'been', 'inactive', 'year', 'Then', 'bunch', 'Egyptian-styled', 'warriors', 'come', 'kidnap', 'officer', 'General', 'Hammond', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'Jack', ""O'Neill"", 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'retirement', 'Abydos', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', ""O'Neill"", 'reunited', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'only', 'have', 'Daniel', 'wife', 'brother-in-law', 'abducted', 'evil', 'Apophis', 'A', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'war', ""Goa'uld"", 'aliens', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'impersonating', 'human', 'gods', 'many', 'centuries.So', 'team', 'SG-1', 'made', ""O'Neill"", 'Jackson', 'scientist/pilot', 'Sam', 'Carter', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'Apophis', 'ex-slave', 'Teal', 'c', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'Stargate', 'finding', 'plenty', 'hostile', 'aliens', 'strange', 'allies', 'Unas', 'Asgard', 'humans', 'scattered', 'over', 'Not', 'mention', 'gate-builders', 'who', 'have', 'ascended', 'plane.Frst', 'battle', 'arrogant', 'Apophis', 'then', 'devil-imitating', ""So'kar"", 'malignant', 'half-energy', 'Anubis', 'army', 'undead', 'warriors', ""Goa'uld"", 'power', 'structure', 'splinter', 'new', 'secret', 'organizations', 'make', 'power', 'plays', 'Earth', 'SG-1', 'uncovers', 'hidden', 'legacies', 'humanity', 'ancestors.Even', ""Goa'uld"", 'storyline', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'ended', 'SG-1', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'given', 'command', 'SG-1', 'manages', 'gather', 'disbanded', 'team', 'back', 'together', 'help', 'quirky', 'alien', 'mercenary', 'Vala', 'Mal', 'Doran', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'Together', 'find', 'Milky', 'Way', 'most', 'deadly', 'threat', 'ever', 'Ori', 'evil', 'ascended', 'beings', 'who', 'demand', 'everyone', 'worship', 'else.Previously', 'exploration', 'sci-fi', 'focused', 'people', 'ships', 'Stargate', 'usual', 'space', 'opera', 'approach', 'even', 'when', 'ships', 'are', 'introduced', 'main', 'focus', 'walking', 'big', 'stone', 'ring', 'also', 'full', 'real', 'military', 'political', 'battles', 'Earth', 'very', 'plausible', 'reason', 'why', 'everybody', 'galaxy', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'us.It', 'graced', 'elaborate', 'opulant', 'sets', 'solid', 'special', 'effects', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'action', 'Marines', 'Air', 'Force', 'truly', 'kinetic', 'space', 'battles', 'including', 'one', 'climax', 'Star', 'Wars', 'IV', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'sudden', 'switch', 'villains', 'cast', 'ten', 'seasons', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'very', 'warm', 'human', 'moments', 'Daniel', 'farewell', 'wife', 'Sam', 'bonding', 'doomed', 'little', 'girl', 'Teal', 'c', 'struggle', 'freedom.Best', 'snappy', 'script', 'Teal', 'c', 'Undomesticated', 'equines', 'could', 'not', 'remove', 'mostly', 'tart-tongued', ""O'Neill"", 'Well', 'guess', 'start', 'shooting', 'blood', 'death', 'hard', 'feelings', ""'d"", 'suck', 'Other', 'characters', 'get', 'great', 'lines', 'too', 'think', 'circle', ""'the"", 'place', 'legacy', 'could', 'be', 'piece', 'leg', 'first', 'make', 'more', 'sense', '.The', 'cast', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'Anderson', 'quirky', 'disrespectful', 'pop', 'culture-lovin', 'guy', 'hidden', 'tragic', 'past', 'Tapping', 'Shanks', 'are', 'great', 'enthusiastic', 'geek', 'smart', 'capable', 'military', 'woman', 'Judge', 'absolutely', 'astounding', 'Teal', 'c', 'who', 'slowly', 'stoic', 'tragic', 'warrior', 'warm', 'legendary', 'hero.Corin', 'Nemec', 'had', 'one-season', 'stint', 'Daniel', 'replacement', 'nice', 'eager', 'young', 'newbie', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'channels', 'much', ""O'Neill"", 'quirkiness', 'when', 'Anderson', 'left', 'Black', 'kind', 'annoying', 'times', 'admittedly', 'quite', 'funny', 'quirky', 'tragic', 'past', 'own', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'undeniably', 'best', 'TV', 'spinoff', 'one', 'best', 'exploration', 'shows', 'make', 'air', 'stay', 'there', 'whole', 'decade', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'beginning', 'end']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

1091137,A1TUUSQODOPXOE,B000TJBNHQ,"Frank Forrest ""Quasar""","[0, 0]","By now you've probably read all the horror stories about scratched and damaged discs in the complete boxed set of Stargate SG-1, but a recent super-low promotional price for this item pushed me over the edge and i believed it was worth the jump. Fortunately, due to all the complaints about the boxed set on here, this led me to immediately do a spot check on the contents and I was amazed to find that the discs were in pristine condition with no marks, scuffs or dings.My only conclusion is that MGM may have replaced the original vendors who supplied and assembled their sets. But this is just a guess. In any event, I did not see any problems with the boxed set that was sent to me.I never watched Stargate SG-1 when it was on television, so the whole experience is new to me. And with all ten-years of Stargate SG-1 at my fingertips, it makes viewing the series even more enjoyable. The production values of this show are great, and I really enjoy the stories.If you have concerns about purchasing the Stargate SG-1 boxed set, as I was, just make sure you purchase yours from Amazon and not a third-party vendor. I was counting on Amazon's excellent return policy to bail me out in the event of damaged discs, but this proved to be unnecessary.The only reason why this set gets four-stars instead of five-stars is because all the discs are somewhat hard to remove from their individual slots, and are pretty tightly packed. But this may be due to a redesign of the package to make sure that the discs will not slip out during shipping to prevent damage. So I guess its a good tradeoff.Even at its present price, it's still a pretty good deal and you get free shipping too.",4,Good series.

I recently picked up season one of SG Atlantis  in Wmart because it was only about $13. I really liked Atlantis so I eventually bought all seasons.  After that I thought maybe I would take another look  at SG1. So I found this deal ($102 including shipping) and thought that's a lot of entertainment for the money.  I am now about midway through Season 2 and I am hoping they got some hope they got better writers on the job by 3rd  season. SG1 is just comic book hoaky compared to Atlantis.  There seems to be NO scientific minds OR military in SG1.  The only character that is a plausable Sci Fi character to me is Tealc (sp)  The other three members of SG1 are more like the 3 Stooges than explorers. Not the actors faults though, I have seen them do other stuff. I have not even looked to see who the writers on Atlantis and SG1 are but they cannot be the same .Atlantis is right on par with Star trek, and they absolutely copied many things from Star Trek DS-9 , but that is fine by me they copied good stuff.In Atlantis their military tactics are very good and the Sci Fi is plausible but so far (Midway through second season.)

1091145,A2QNS95WGN35G9,B000TJBNHQ,Jason,"[59, 65]","I'm going to assume, if you are thinking of buying this collection, you are a fan of stargate.  So it goes without saying, it is one of the best shows ever. To say this is my favorite series of all time, would be a vast understatement.Now on to what most people are here to know.  Previously, I bought the stargate disc sets when they first started coming out (remember the big boxes, they were a real pain to get to fit anywhere!).  I paid full retail for them, and watched them countless times.  These dvd's got a heavy workout.  And cost quite a bit.  I own season 1-9 in the original box.  I didn't buy ten because of this coming out (and I had a season pass on itunes).  With that said, buying this set was still a no brainer for me.The 4 discs that are included in this package are very indepth. They contain many video features that are 45 minutes in length (discs 1 and 2), and 20 minutes for the other features.  Some, like the directors series run 8 to 10 minutes.  I would guess their is approximately 8 hours of bonus features.  My only complaint is the first disc is letterboxed opposed to widescreen, and disc 2 only has 1 (mythology) in widescreen, the rest are also 4:3 letterboxed.The other complaint I have about this purchase, are the containers that house the discs.  Several of my discs arrived in bad shape. On my first batch I got 26 discs that had a good amount of scratches on them, 4 of those had glue or some other white mass attached to the discs.  I was able to rid them from the discs using a cleaner, but this is still very bad.I own both the buffy and angel collectors sets, and I think all collectors sets should use a similar style. Buffy takes up as much room as 2-3 of my other tv show cases, and all of the discs arrived scratch free because they use cd holders opposed to cardboard.  I cannot forget my horrible experience with Alias, I could not find one disc without a serious scratch.  The stargate discs with scratches were small, light, surface scratches.  They were able to play through (just finished a marathon session) with only a few discs exhibiting slight problems.  Thanks to amazon's amazing customer service, a replacement set is on it's way, and with luck, I will be able to replace the ones with flaws for those without. (I would recommend only buying this set from amazon, if you buy from other places the discs could be horribly damaged, and you would be unable to request another set)On my small shelf, I can fit the whole Stargate Collection as well as 2 seasons of another show, on the same small shelf.  (opposed to 3 of my original stargate boxes only), so economy wise, you cannot get any better.The box is beautiful, it is more muted compared to the image you see in the description, and the Stargate water does not glow as it does in the image.  I love this set, the care and attention that went into designing it is fantastic.  You also get a small book, that shows you the episodes, tv guide line, and any special feature that is located on each disc.I cannot wait for the future movies (coming in march and july), and I truly hope MGM will release this show in a High Def format.I highly recommend purchasing this set, and I eagerly look forward to a blu-ray or hd-dvd release of this in the future.---------edit 12/04/07--------I mentioned in my review Amazon sent me a replacement because of the badly scratched discs (overnighted even, wow, way to go amazon!), sadly this brought new attention to details I did not notice prior.First, the new box I got, most every disc was perfect, the packaging arrived pristine (minus the fact that the box seems to be of lesser quality (coloring wise) and the logo is on sideways).  The part about the case stinks, because my original box was smashed on the sides thanks to UPS, so I either keep it (damage is minimal) or go with the box with the cockeyed logo (no thanks).On to another problem.  As I said, this new box set, almost every disc was pristine. There were disc's with scratches, but very very few (maybe 5, and those were very light surface scratches, most every other disc was mint!).  What I noticed upon replacing damaged discs with those that were not, was the new discs (and my old) had different printing.  Some had that cheap hong kong bootleg copy coloring going on, while other were perfect, deeply saturated, and sharp.  What is sad is many of my damaged discs from my first batch where sharp, and the replacements seemed to be incredibly dull and blurry (not the picture quality, I have yet to check that on these new discs, but I doubt those are changed).It seems the studio is using different companies to produce these box sets.  Discs in each set are both faded, and sharp (different discs throughout the set),  on their own, they are un-noticeable.  but when you stack them up with a duplicate set, or your older disc's, it becomes increasingly obvious.Shame on this company for not having better quality control and using the same printing throughout!",5,Best series ever!

1091149,A2A6YAYYX5YFMN,B000TJBNHQ,Jim,"[3, 3]","Let me start by saying that, initially, I had a hard time getting into the ""Stargate"" franchise. I grew up on the films of Lucas and Spielberg. I watched the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" as well as its sister series ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century."" Later, I became a fan of the various ""Star Trek"" television series. I had given ""Stargate"" a shot a couple of times- mainly because I was a huge fan of Richard Dean Anderson and ""MacGyver."" I thought sci-fi + MacGyver, how can it miss? However, I could never seem to immerse myself in the mythology of the ""Stargate"" universe. Eventually, I realized that I was unfairly comparing it to all the other things that I had loved as a ten-year-old boy. Nostalgia is a powerful force. In this case, I was unwilling to accept anything new- after all, the things you see as a kid are very formative. After this realization, I purchased the first season of ""SG-1"" on DVD and watched without an agenda. I found that I had been missing out on something that, once I gave it a chance, was a worthy successor to the adventures I enjoyed in my youth. ""Stargate"" has adventure, humor, imagination and excitement and, in fact, I now find it difficult to watch any of the Star Treks (it seems I never learn!) In any case, this series has completely drawn me in and I quickly devoured each season. As I was watching it, a funny thing happened- I realized that this series and its spinoff (""Stargate Atlantis"") contain the very same raw materials that I loved in all those other shows: great characters, interesting stories, imaginative hardware (does the Odyssey resemble the original Galactica?) and amazing effects. That is not to say that it is in any way derivative- ""Stargate"" has a mythology all its own, but it is that combination of the familiar and the new that has placed ""Stargate"" in my personal pantheon of great storytelling.",4,Great Storytelling!,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,1874,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'initially', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'Stargate', 'franchise', 'grew', 'up', 'films', 'Lucas', 'Spielberg', 'watched', 'original', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'series', 'Buck', 'Rogers', '25th', 'Century', 'Later', 'became', 'fan', 'various', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'series', 'had', 'given', 'Stargate', 'shot', 'couple', 'times-', 'mainly', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'MacGyver', 'thought', 'sci-fi', '+', 'MacGyver', 'how', 'can', 'miss', 'However', 'could', 'never', 'seem', 'immerse', 'mythology', 'Stargate', 'universe', 'Eventually', 'realized', 'was', 'unfairly', 'comparing', 'other', 'things', 'had', 'loved', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'Nostalgia', 'powerful', 'force', 'case', 'was', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'anything', 'new-', 'things', 'see', 'kid', 'are', 'very', 'formative', 'realization', 'purchased', 'first', 'season', 'SG-1', 'DVD', 'watched', 'agenda', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'out', 'something', 'once', 'gave', 'chance', 'was', 'worthy', 'successor', 'adventures', 'enjoyed', 'youth', 'Stargate', 'adventure', 'humor', 'imagination', 'excitement', 'fact', 'now', 'find', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Star', 'Treks', 'never', 'learn', 'case', 'series', 'completely', 'drawn', 'quickly', 'devoured', 'season', 'was', 'watching', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened-', 'realized', 'series', 'spinoff', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'contain', 'very', 'same', 'raw', 'materials', 'loved', 'other', 'shows', 'great', 'characters', 'interesting', 'stories', 'imaginative', 'hardware', 'Odyssey', 'resemble', 'original', 'Galactica', 'amazing', 'effects', 'not', 'say', 'way', 'derivative-', 'Stargate', 'mythology', 'own', 'combination', 'familiar', 'new', 'placed', 'Stargate', 'personal', 'pantheon', 'great', 'storytelling']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection
1091150,A2DVAT6T0JYEQZ,B000TJBNHQ,J. Moyer,"[1, 1]","I purchased this set a while back from another retailer. Everything was fine the first time through until I got to season 3 when and episode frozen in the middle. After inspection, I found the disk was scratched. I then noticed that a small piece of plastic was at the bottom of the cardboard sleeve. This had to have happened at the manufacturer as the only place the plastic bit could have come from was a disk and all of mine were fine (other than scratches). There were a few more disks that had scratches and wouldn't play. I've since been able to replace a couple of the disks but each time I watch the series, a different disk turn up scratched. This has to be due to the cardboard packaging in this set. The disks are packed tight into the sleeves so inserting and removing the disks tend to lead to scratches. The cardboard doesn't protect the disks in any way. I have other box sets that use plastic cases to secure the disks better and are still working fine even after several viewings. This box with this set looks really cool but it's no good if you can't watch the episodes. I love this series but I highly recommend getting the individual seasons because the packaging tons better and in the event a couple of disks get scratched, it would be much easier to replace.",1,Great series...Terrible packaging,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1282,"['purchased', 'set', 'while', 'back', 'retailer', 'Everything', 'was', 'fine', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'season', '3', 'when', 'episode', 'frozen', 'middle', 'inspection', 'found', 'disk', 'was', 'scratched', 'then', 'noticed', 'small', 'piece', 'plastic', 'was', 'bottom', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'had', 'have', 'happened', 'manufacturer', 'only', 'place', 'plastic', 'bit', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'was', 'disk', 'mine', 'were', 'fine', 'other', 'scratches', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'disks', 'had', 'scratches', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'replace', 'couple', 'disks', 'time', 'watch', 'series', 'different', 'disk', 'turn', 'up', 'scratched', 'be', 'due', 'cardboard', 'packaging', 'set', 'disks', 'are', 'packed', 'tight', 'sleeves', 'so', 'inserting', 'removing', 'disks', 'tend', 'lead', 'scratches', 'cardboard', ""n't"", 'protect', 'disks', 'way', 'have', 'other', 'box', 'sets', 'use', 'plastic', 'cases', 'secure', 'disks', 'better', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'fine', 'even', 'several', 'viewings', 'box', 'set', 'really', 'cool', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'episodes', 'love', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'individual', 'seasons', 'packaging', 'tons', 'better', 'event', 'couple', 'disks', 'get', 'scratched', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'replace']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

From there, the presentation jumps the rails in a hurry. Once inside the box, you'll discover 2 cardboard books of disks. Rather than set the books up with conventional pages, the books unfold in a cumbersome, multi-folded, gate fold. Each facet of this double-sided arrangement holds 3 disks in tight fitting pockets. It's here that the scratched disk phenomenon arises. (So far, my set has escaped the problem.)The double-sided, multi-folded booklets make searching for a specific disk awkward, but they haven't completely turned the set into a mockery of common organizational principles - yet. That comes when you realize that the colors of the disks are randomly assigned, not by season, episode, nor any other rationale. They're just random colors. So to select say, Disk 5 of Season 3, you have to pull disks from their pockets and read the smallish print to find the area of the book that has Season 3, then keep pulling until you find Disk 5. I have no doubt that this unnecessary handling leads to many a scratched disk. Just as confusing, is the icon in between the season number and disk number. It consists of a pentangle of 5 'blocks', with one highlighted, and a number in the middle. Nowhere is it explained what this signifies. It obviously has nothing to do with season, disk or episode.The shame of it is, with just a little bit of thought, or even basic organizing principles, this could have been a great boxed set.

1091154,A1H1C2UZ6FH0YL,B000TJBNHQ,Johnfourtytwo,"[0, 0]","This is a review of the DVD Boxset since the Blu-ray isn't available yet.I agree with the majority with the packaging but I put all my DVDs and Blu-rays in CD albums so this is basically a none issue for me. I did check all the discs for scratches and gouges and found none. The only problem was some of the dics were duplicates and I immediately notified Amazon and they I immediately provided me with the shipping labels to return this purchase. The replacement had all the discs, there was no damage, and they all play perfectly. That was about four years ago.Recently I've upgraded to an HD TV and Blu-ray and the DVDs play just fine on those machines. The earlier seasons do show a bit of grain but is still better than being played through my DVD player. The later seasons were apparently filmed in HD or at least some kind of digital format because they are much clearer/sharper than the earlier seasons but not quite blu-ray quality but I'm not complaning just stating opinion based on empirical evidence.The 4-star rating is as close to perfect that I can honestly give since the play all feature wasn't added until Season 9. If the Blu-ray version has play all with all the discs and updated special features menus along with additional features then it will be 5-stars without a problem.The review for the entire series would be 4-star at most due to various personal preferences I would have taken if I were the producer. For the most part the suspension of disbelief hit the mark but from a military standpoint I take serious issue with the various childish behavior potrayed every now and then by these elite special forces units which is due from the various writers with no military experience getting a stronghold on various scripts; fortunately they were few and far between.Also it was very fortunate that the series wasn't bogged down in endless technobabble (I do admit there was some but not a lot) of trying to explain everything like another very popular TV show did for almost 25 seasons. I did enjoy how most if not all mythologies were woven together to tell this very appealing story.",4,To Boldly Go Where No Science Fiction Show Has Gone Before,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2112,"['review', 'DVD', 'Boxset', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'available', 'yet.I', 'agree', 'majority', 'packaging', 'put', 'DVDs', 'Blu-rays', 'CD', 'albums', 'so', 'basically', 'none', 'issue', 'did', 'check', 'discs', 'scratches', 'gouges', 'found', 'none', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'dics', 'were', 'duplicates', 'immediately', 'notified', 'Amazon', 'immediately', 'provided', 'shipping', 'labels', 'return', 'purchase', 'replacement', 'had', 'discs', 'was', 'damage', 'play', 'perfectly', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'ago.Recently', ""'ve"", 'upgraded', 'HD', 'TV', 'Blu-ray', 'DVDs', 'play', 'just', 'fine', 'machines', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'do', 'show', 'bit', 'grain', 'still', 'better', 'being', 'played', 'DVD', 'player', 'later', 'seasons', 'were', 'apparently', 'filmed', 'HD', 'least', 'kind', 'digital', 'format', 'are', 'much', 'clearer/sharper', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'not', 'quite', 'blu-ray', 'quality', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaning', 'just', 'stating', 'opinion', 'based', 'empirical', 'evidence.The', '4-star', 'rating', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'can', 'honestly', 'give', 'play', 'feature', 'was', ""n't"", 'added', 'Season', '9', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'play', 'discs', 'updated', 'special', 'features', 'menus', 'additional', 'features', 'then', 'will', 'be', '5-stars', 'problem.The', 'review', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'be', '4-star', 'most', 'due', 'various', 'personal', 'preferences', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'were', 'producer', 'most', 'part', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'hit', 'mark', 'military', 'standpoint', 'take', 'serious', 'issue', 'various', 'childish', 'behavior', 'potrayed', 'now', 'then', 'elite', 'special', 'forces', 'units', 'due', 'various', 'writers', 'military', 'experience', 'getting', 'stronghold', 'various', 'scripts', 'fortunately', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'between.Also', 'was', 'very', 'fortunate', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'bogged', 'down', 'endless', 'technobabble', 'do', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'lot', 'trying', 'explain', 'everything', 'very', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'did', 'almost', '25', 'seasons', 'did', 'enjoy', 'how', 'most', 'not', 'mythologies', 'were', 'woven', 'together', 'tell', 'very', 'appealing', 'story']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

1091157,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B000TJBNHQ,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[1, 2]","Ok, I have never seen the show.  But the first movie is one of my favorites.  It is such an interesting idea.  The story draws you in and kind of keeps you wondering and excited.  The cast is full of great actors.  The show ran for such a long time.  You will have so many episodes to watch.  There were also 2 other shows that went with the Stargate idea.  There was also an animated series.  I know show got less than great reviews, but I am a collector.  So, if I get one series, I will get them all.  With Stargate you have loads of stuff to watch.  Besides the episodes and movies, you have the special features.  There is a lot of entertainment here.That being said, there was one problem I had with this set.  Most of the DVDs had marks.  Some were small while others covered the entire disc.  Besides that, there seemed to be a film substance on a lot of them.  They may work fine, but I will not take the chance.  So, I just got them today, I went on Amazon to the help - chat thing.  First they said they would give me a partial refund.  There was no reason for that.  It is not their fault.  So, they told me to contact the manufacturer.  They gave me the phone number.  I asked my mom to call and she did so.  The company said there were some sets with errors or problems.  They said they check each disc in the set before sending it out.  They will email her a label, I return the defective set and am sent another one.  That is fine with me.  I think the set is really cool.  I chose not to get my money back.  Even if something happened and the next set was defective, the company has to get me a good copy.  So, I am fine with it.  Some people sad the DVDs were moving around or would do so, thus scratching them.  I can not see that happening.  While there were two discs that were out of there slots, I think it was how they were put in.  The rest of the DVDs would not move.  It took some real force for me to remove them.  I am 100% confident that when a non defective set arrives, the DVDs will be fine.  If you don't feel the same, you could always go buy some felt stuff or whatever you felt best with and put them under the DVDs.  That is what I did with the Friends series.When you read through this you may wonder why I gave the set 5 out of 5 even though there was something wrong with it.  The reason is this, sometimes things happen.  No company wants to sell someone bad or defective stuff.  They are the ones that end up losing money.  Some people don't like the fact that they have to go through the work of sending the set back, and then wait for the new to arrive.  But just relax.  Everything will work out in the end.  If you got like 5 series sets and they all were defective, then you could tell them you wanted your money back.  Now I have an adventure of my own.  I get to wait and see if the next set is 100%.  If you want to buy the set, maybe it would be better contacting the company who makes the set.  As I said, they check each disc.  So, this is a cool story done over 10 seasons, if something is wrong it will be fixed.  Check it out!!!!Update 7 - 25 - 2012Ok, I got my new set in the mail yesterday.  I was excited to finally get to watch the show.  I checked the DVDs and out of the 10 or so I checked, they were useless,  I only saw one with a scratch or scratches actually, but most of the ones I looked at had this stuff on them.  Big clusters of stuff.  I tried wiping them off, but they could not be removed.  I can not figure out what was on them.  It is almost like before they put the stuff on the DVD to protect it, something got on the Disc.  Maybe they would have played, but it seems to me that is there is something that is covering a DVD and it is unable to be removed, you will have problems.  So, I contacted Amazon, and am getting a full refund when they get the set in the mail.  I told them they should refuse to sell until the company can figure out what is wrong and package it better.When the company who actually makes the set was contacted, they said they check each DVD before they ship it out now.  Well, either they forgot their glasses, or that was just something that was said that is not true.  Either way, now I am out a series and the company and Amazon are out money.I think I heard people were having problems with the single seasons as well.  I will go to FYE and get one used.  Then if something is wrong I can return it to them.",5,An interesting story over 10 seasons.

The acting is top shelf and the stories usually engaging.My reason for 3 stars. The packaging for this series frankly sucks. The external case is ok. The sleeves that the disks are kept in are a totally garbage design. They're made from cardboard which means the disks can get scratched easily taking them out and putting them back. Fox who distributes and manufactures these disks for MGM should be ashamed of the quality of the product.Their manufacturing quality control is non existent I'd say. Quite a few of the disks look like they're heavily scratched and upon closer inspection you see that those are actually on the internal part of the disk on the recording media not the outer external surface. That's just sloppy , poor workmanship. I had amazon send me a replacement set so that between two sets I could get one good one and I actually came close. I swapped out a total of six disks that would not play on either my PC or my Sony BD player. I actually have a 7th disk that only partly plays before locking up from the ""good"" set and the same disk from the other set wont play at all.  I sent the original set back for a refund.If I didn't love SG-1 so much I'd just send the second set back for a refund because the workmanship is so lousy.

I am really disappointed I didn't buy it long ago (especially the time I saw it on sale for 78$ with Amazon!).  Yes, the packaging is probably the worst I've ever seen.  In fact, I'm shocked they couldn't figure out a way to do a better job of it.  I would have gladly paid extra for better packaging.  Granted, the box is really neat looking and the concept (the way the DVD's are kind of in a ""book"") is great... but not sufficient for such a large investment.  I will still give the whole package a 5 star rating because for the price you are going to get literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of content.  SG1 (in my opinion) brought something totally different to the Sci-fi genre.  The characters (especially around the 6th season), played by actors who truly have grown to love each other as family, play off of each other brilliantly.  What I did right away was buy a huge DVD holder and carefully removed all of the DVD's from the original packaging and placed them in the DVD case.  It was a 13$ investment that was WELL worth it. The DVD's that were scratched had only minor scratches that my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player ignored.  I have not had one problem playing any of the DVD's at all.  Not one. I would not let a few scratched DVD's keep me from buying this set.  You will be hard pressed to find this much entertainment at such a great price.

I've gotten through season 2 so far and I have not found any problems so far. I do like this series and how it took a very well done movie and explored how deep a series can come from this. the story lines are well done and has very few weak episodes....Watching Richard Dean Anderson and his witty remarks never seem to get old.

1091210,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B000TJBNHQ,Terry Sunday,"[1, 1]","Sometimes an item is so good that you just have to give it five stars, regardless of whether it has a couple of little quirks. ""Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection"" is one of those.As one of the longest-running, most-highly-regarded science fiction television shows ever, ""Stargate SG-1"" surely warrants a high rating based on quality alone. I don't now (and never did) have cable television, so I missed the show when it originally aired on Showtime and the Sci-Fi channel. My local CBS over-the-air broadcast affiliate Channel 4.2 (ThisTV) now shows two episodes back-to-back every Sunday evening. They've just started through the whole 10-season series for the second time, and I rarely miss an episode. But how long it will be before its yanked from the airwaves is anybody's guess. So picking up this DVD set was a no-brainer for me.With that said, let me address two issues that show up pretty often in other reviews and in the forums for this set, namely: 1) scratched disks, and 2) nudity in the pilot episode.Based on other reviews, I inspected all 54 disks in the set as soon as I got it. As many reviewers note, the packaging technique of shoving each disk down into an individual little slot in the thin accordion-fold cardboard gizmo is not the best. Some of the disks I looked at have--well, I wouldn't call them ""scratches,"" exactly; they're more like ""scuffs"" or ""abrasions"" where they've rubbed up against the edge of the slot. About a third of the disks have some kind of marks on them. It looks like relatively minor damage--it's nothing like the gouged, scratched, smudged and smeared disks that I sometimes get from the public library. Some of those disks DO skip or hang up in my player. But the damage on them is much more severe than the marks on the Stargate disks. It'll take me months or years to work my way through all the seasons of Stargate, so I can't report at this time whether any of the scuffed disks don't play properly. But it doesn't look like the marks are bad enough to matter, at least based on a visual inspection.Okay, on to the nudity in the pilot episode ""Children of the Gods."" There are, it's true, a few lingering shots of (GASP!) bare female BREASTS, and even a momentary glimpse of pubic hair (Oh, the HUMANITY!), in this episode. So what? There are also MANY scenes of people being shot, wounded and killed, with blood flowing from their wounds, and mayhem and carnage on a large scale. I'm not (quite) anal enough to count how many dead bodies pile up in this episode, but it's not a small number. So, if you're going to object to this episode's content, why not do so based on the violence, not on a little tasteful nudity? In my opinion, there's something fundamentally, disturbingly wrong with a value system that regards cinematic depictions of the most depraved acts of violence as ""suitable for all ages,"" while images of the human body are considered disgusting and evil. Every person on earth has nipples. What's the big deal?Okay, now that that's off my chest (which has two nipples, one on the right side and one on the left), let me heartily and enthusiastically recommend ""Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection.""

I have 3 Blu Ray players, a top of the line Sony and 2 Panasonic&#8217;s. Almost the same results on all three. I believe some of minor skipping has to do with the case the disk&#8217;s are in.

I already own the first seven seasons but they are in the big box sets and take up way too much room so they'll be going to a friend or sold.Plenty of extras including all of the Atlantis/spin-off specials (not the episodes but the introduction and coming features type stuff), interviews and behind the scenes specials SciFi channel did through the decade that the show aired. A nice little booklet that lists the contents for all the discs with a synopsis of each episode and whatever special content is on the disc.The packaging is decent enough but nothing special. I've never cared much for storing discs in cardboard pockets when they could've done with spindles or at least envelopes or lined pockets. This is better than most that use flat unsurfaced cardboard instead this is a glossy cardboard that has been folded to help separate the discs from each other and the packaging. Even though this is an improvement I removed a star for the packaging since some already show scratching/scuffing (not enough to stop them from playing but a sign of things to come). A better design could've ensured the long life and safety of the discs.",4,"Great set, disc storage could be better though",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1231,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'Stargate', 'universe', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'first', 'aired', 'already', 'own', 'first', 'seven', 'seasons', 'are', 'big', 'box', 'sets', 'take', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'room', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'friend', 'sold.Plenty', 'extras', 'including', 'Atlantis/spin-off', 'specials', 'not', 'episodes', 'introduction', 'coming', 'features', 'type', 'stuff', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'specials', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'did', 'decade', 'show', 'aired', 'A', 'nice', 'little', 'booklet', 'contents', 'discs', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'special', 'content', 'disc.The', 'packaging', 'decent', 'enough', 'nothing', 'special', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'much', 'storing', 'discs', 'cardboard', 'pockets', 'when', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'spindles', 'least', 'envelopes', 'lined', 'pockets', 'better', 'most', 'use', 'flat', 'unsurfaced', 'cardboard', 'instead', 'glossy', 'cardboard', 'been', 'folded', 'help', 'separate', 'discs', 'other', 'packaging', 'Even', 'improvement', 'removed', 'star', 'packaging', 'already', 'show', 'scratching/scuffing', 'not', 'enough', 'stop', 'playing', 'sign', 'things', 'come', 'better', 'design', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ensured', 'long', 'life', 'safety', 'discs']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

The boxed set was wrapped in clear thick Plastic wrap - AOK not tears.  Then I went though all 54 dvd's Whew! EVERY dvd was in perfect condition, not a scratch or flaw on any of them. the discs are clearly marked in the correct order.

1091220,A1O1NI60MEENGR,B000TJBNHQ,Walt,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best SciFi series I have seen.  It is the characters that make most shows work if they are to last. Stargate SG1 has some of the best. The writing is superb, and the humor O'neill inserts into serious situations adds another dimension. The special features are informative providing background on the show and the stars.  Another unexpected was that one episode contained scenes not shown when aired on TV.My main negative is the disc quality. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The first set I got had multiple discs with smudges and scratches. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent a replacement. The second set also had many scratched discs.  My first thought was to return that one also and get a refund. But I really wanted this series. So I decided to see how they played.  So far 11% of the episodes have had minor problems. By minor problems, I mean it would freeze for one or two seconds. It is definitely not the quality I expect from new discs.  But the alternative would be paying much more somewhere else. And while the freeze is an annoyance, it doesn't prevent the enjoyment of the show. I should also point out that the freezing and scratches do not seem related. Some discs that were not scratched froze, and some that were scratched badly played fine. So if you get this set, you won't be able to tell how they play by inspecting them.The other thing I don't like is the case the discs are in. I recommend buying a case of DVD cases with the series.",4,Great series - disc quality subpar,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1503,"['one', 'best', 'SciFi', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'characters', 'make', 'most', 'shows', 'work', 'are', 'last', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'best', 'writing', 'superb', 'humor', ""O'neill"", 'serious', 'situations', 'dimension', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'informative', 'providing', 'background', 'show', 'stars', 'unexpected', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'contained', 'scenes', 'not', 'shown', 'when', 'aired', 'TV.My', 'main', 'negative', 'disc', 'quality', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'first', 'set', 'got', 'had', 'multiple', 'discs', 'smudges', 'scratches', 'returned', 'Amazon', 'promptly', 'sent', 'replacement', 'second', 'set', 'also', 'had', 'many', 'scratched', 'discs', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'return', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'refund', 'really', 'wanted', 'series', 'decided', 'see', 'how', 'played', 'So', 'far', '11', '%', 'episodes', 'have', 'had', 'minor', 'problems', 'minor', 'problems', 'mean', 'would', 'freeze', 'one', 'two', 'seconds', 'definitely', 'not', 'quality', 'expect', 'new', 'discs', 'alternative', 'would', 'be', 'paying', 'much', 'more', 'somewhere', 'else', 'freeze', 'annoyance', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'freezing', 'scratches', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'related', 'discs', 'were', 'not', 'scratched', 'froze', 'were', 'scratched', 'badly', 'played', 'fine', 'So', 'get', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'how', 'play', 'inspecting', 'them.The', 'other', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'case', 'discs', 'are', 'recommend', 'buying', 'case', 'DVD', 'cases', 'series']",Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection

I can't wait for the made for dvd movies to release to finally get closure on the Ori storyline! I also have to admit I love Atlantis nowadays more than I ever thought I could! I at first thought it was going to be a failure, but I was very wrong!
