Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, and Penn Badgley bring great energy to this teen drama. Chace Crawford is easy on the eyes and Kelly Rutherford is someone I am glad is back on t.v. after her days on Melrose Place. This show is a bit slow but the post-writers strike episodes were the best so far. Kristen Bell is the ""voice"" of gossip girl and she does a great job selling that coy voice of hers.

1107195,A130YN8T37O833,B000W6ZUUC,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[5, 6]","I kept putting this show off because it just didn't do a thing for me within the first ten minutes of the first episode. None of the actors seemed to have the WOW factor to keep me glued. Here we are almost a year later and the show has arrived on DVD. Me being the bargain shopper that I am, I decided to finally pick this up on DVD solely based on the fact that it was under seventeen dollars. Considering there's only eighteen episodes making each episode a little less than one dollar (Total Bargain). Needless to say, I was bored last night and needed something to watch and this flipped the bill perfectly. I finally gave this show a chance and it was worth it.Yes, the acting is bad and even on some levels hideous by some of the actors - amateurish acting at its best. Even veteran actors like Matthew Settle and Kelly Rutherford don't really deliver the goods either. It's true what they say - You have to work with what you're given and these actors aren't given the best lines. Nor do I believe that the director of each episodes pushes to get the best of them. But under the cheap exterior of a soap opera with actors in their twenties playing teens, lies a decent show.The lead actress Blake Lively looks like she is in her thirties during the first few seconds of the show on her train ride into Grand Central Station and pretty much in every episode as well. It bothers me that she doesn't look seventeen, but I can handle it.The show reminds me a lot of Cruel Intentions for some strange reason. If Manchester Prep School was made into a show, this would be that show.I feel helpless because the show is almost done with its second season and I am only on episode three of season one.The show revolves around Serena, the so-called IT GIRL who has disappeared for boarding school only a few months in only to make a surprise return into the city. Her old posse are all in shock when she returns and after much negative influence from Blair is axed from their inner circle. Though the narrator, Kristen Bell, keeps harping on the fact that it revolves around the lives of the rich and privileged in the Upper East Side of Manhattan - this couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. I adore that the show is shot in Manhattan, but it's rarely on the UES. Many of the scenes are shot around Midtown and under. The Palace Hotel where Serena stays during the first season is in the fifties on Madison Ave. And the UES is not even all that. Everyone that lives in Manhattan knows how untrendy the UES is. It's just a playground for married couples who have children and want to pay overprice fees to send them to private schools instead of public schools.Leighton Meester (Blair Waldorf) is just a bad actress. So is the young sister (Jenny Humphrey) played by Taylor Momsen. She is beyond atrocious in the acting department. If speaking like a valley girl means acting than I must have that act down pat. But, Ed Westwick (Chuck Bass) was born to play his role. Everything about his overall presence fits the part of the snotty angry rich kid that causes nothing but trouble. He wreaks havoc perfectly.Overall there is promise for this show. It's packed with beautiful people (for the most part) and the basic premise is an interesting spin. It's like watching celebrities live their lives after they read their own gossip that swirls the headlines and the fury ensues.Though this show is much like most teen soaps, lacking real talent and most of its stars just don't have the x-factor - its still deliciously devilish fun in the vein of Melrose Place. Kristen Bell narrates this show annoyingly yet fittingly with that darn teen condescending voice of hers. If you need something on TV to keep you entertained since Sex and the City went south after season three, this is the show for you. You know you love it XOXO!

1107198,A2EO3TWW174F7P,B000W6ZUUC,"Cameron Dimez ""GM Custom Jewelry Owner""","[7, 9]","Gossip Girl: Starring Leighton Meester, Blake Lively, Kristen Bell, Penn Badgley, Taylor Momsen, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Matthew Settle and Jessica Szohr.It's easy to write Gossip Girl off as a flighty teen drama about spoiled rich teenagers that whine and complain about those trivial problems over 80% of America wishes they had to worry about. You see the shows on MTV like ""My Super Sweet 16"" and see teen girls whine to their parents because ""they wanted the Valentino, not the Dolce"". While not groundbreaking, Gossip Girl has engrossing plots, relatable characters, snarky dialog and effervescent visuals.In 2005 when Gossip Girl was to be made into to movie starring Lindsay Lohan, I read the first book curious what the series was about. It was interesting, the books center around a jealous and privileged teenager named Blair Waldorf who after her best friend (and worst nightmare) Serena van der Woodsen returns from boarding school is once again insecure about herself now that she's the new 'it girl'. The scandals and mishaps between her and her friends are chronicled by an anonymous blogger who goes by ""Gossip Girl"" who ensure the only secret she keeps is her identity. She also endures the usual teenage temptations; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Well, maybe not rock and roll, but she's got her vices. Add to the mix some other quirky characters, a pothead boyfriend, and an eating disorder and you've got yourself one traumatic adolescence.After the series was greenlit by the CW, I was honestly curious and excited to see this show. I thought it would be better as a TV series because it's a book series, and I've never seen a successful condensation of storylines transferring onto the big screen for one jumbled movie with a bloated running time. The pilot itself was decent; there were some obvious changes (some I didn't care for) but overall I saw the potential for a great teen drama. The problem with Gossip Girl is that it seems as though the creators (or executives) don't know what direction to take the show. We have been given a handful of great episodes that would be easy to pitch as ""the next great teen drama"", but there have been lots of others that are confused, lack direction, and fall flat from prior expectations.First and foremost, the changes the series made mostly are about the characters. The character of Serena was supposed to be annoyingly perfect. She is the ""it girl"" of New York. Tall, thin, blonde, and effortlessly breezy. In the TV series, she seems to be just there, lacking purpose or reason. That was one dynamic I appreciated from the books, as I think that it speaks for teenage girls' insecurities. A lot of girls think their classmates have this guidebook that tells them how to dress, act, and look perfect, while they inside crumble. Serena is that girl, and on the surface she looks perfect, but she has her demons too. Then there are some other obvious changes, like Jenny's character and appearance, Dan's personality, and Vanessa's ensemble. There were a lot of quirks that were taken out and have resulted in a plain cardboard cutout.Throughout Gossip Girl's first season, the series strays more and more from the books and in time adapts to its own creation. The real issue is that Gossip Girl lacks a genuine identity, throughout the first 10 episodes every episode revolves around some 'wonderful party', that gets old as we are overwhelmed by this ""privileged lifestyle"" that instead of being shown to us is simply told, or rather listed. Fans complained creator Josh Schwartz copied a lot of plot elements from his previous successful teen drama The O.C. and Gossip Girl lacked originality. While the series at times became cliche, there have always been occasional glimpses of brilliance. Here I take down the 'best' and 'worst' list of episodes of Gossip Girl's first season.The Best:Episode 2: The Wild BrunchSerena realizes she's not welcome, Dan and Chuck almost tear eachother to shreds but good-boy Nate steps in, Jenny becomes engrossed in Blair's lifestyle, and a butler at Bart's brunch gets knocked over in a teenage crossover.Episode 5: Dare DevilAlpha-bitch Blair Waldorf invites social climber Jenny Humphrey to her sleepover and sets her up for humiliation. Meanwhile Serena has her first date with Lonely Boy, and Amanda's boyfriend put his tongue in the same mouth that breathes his secret to his girlfriend.Episode 7: Victor/VictrolaWhat do you get when you combine a burlesque bar, a Blair ultimatum, Dan's sexual research and Vanessa's jealousy? One pretty damn good episode.Episode 13: The Thin Line Between Chuck and NateGossip Girl is being flooded by rumors of a pregnant Serena. Meanwhile, Blair's two men fight for their honor, Jenny rises up the social totem pole thanks to newfound friends Penelope and Hazel, and Dan thinks he's in love with Serena. Thinks.Episode 14: The Blair Bitch ProjectBlair, recently de-throned as queen bee forcibly returns for a grueling day at school, but after little Jenny tries to take the throne, Blair puts her best Jimmy Choo forward to face off. The outcome of this schoolyard fight proves this freshman won't go down without a fight.Episode 16: All About My BrotherIn the final battle for Queen Bee, Blair and Jenny face off in the sharpest episode of the season. Meanwhile, Dan sees something he shouldn't have, Rufus and Lilly's romantic life heats up, and two characters reveal their true nature. Also, Georgina Sparks (played brilliantly by Michelle Trachenburg) continues to wreak havoc on Serena's life.The Worst:Episode 3: Poison IvyWas the choir singing Glamorous by Fergie?! This episode hits a few more speedbumps down the road, and except for the final scene, was really just a filler episode.Episode 6: The Handmaiden's TaleFor a lame episode centering around some ""glamorous event"", we can watch MTV, thanks. Oh, and the costumes for this episode were... questionable.Episode 18: Much 'I Do' About NothingFor a season finale, this episode certainly didn't live up to it's predecessors. Loose ends are tied up way too quickly, Dan pulls the a-hole card, Chuck does a 360 on personality, and Blair plays the little girl that cried tattletale.Overall, if you enjoyed Mean Girls, or Cruel Intentions, there's something you'll like about Gossip Girl. Though this season was somewhat shaky at times, it's never boring and always is entertaining.Rated TV-14 DLS for sexual content, language and mature situations all involving teens.My Rating- 14+ teen

We encounter sex, lies, secrets, and schemes at every turn. We're introduced to characters so deliciously shrewd, we don't know whether to root for them or hope for their inevitable demise. Yet they are well written characters nevertheless; layered with hidden agendas and sympathetic backstories.These prominent characters who will shape the rest of the series are..Dan -- an outsider from the wrong side of the tracks thrust into the elite world of the UES.Chuck -- a cold and callous womanizer, who at first glance, appears to show no semblance of a soul or conscience.Serena -- a reformed party girl eager to change her rebellious ways.Blair -- conniving and ruthless in all her endeavors, yet consistently driven to succeed.Jenny - the social climber, desperate to enter this elite world at any and all costs.Nate -- the quintessential brooding pretty boy, burdened by his family's own shady misgivings.These are characters who you may occasionally loathe, but will inevitably grow to care about.What makes these characters redeemable? Their backstories. The show propels us into their world. We peer into their home lives. We discover where they come from, who they are, and what provokes their choices and actions. The character's families become an integral part of the series as well. The drama isn't solely centered on the teenage characters. The characters' parents find themselves oddly connected to the drama in their kids' lives as well. As we venture into their lavished Upper East Side world, we are transported into high society; extravagant parties and luxurious fashion. We're exposed to a world that is both enticing and addictive to viewers. The scandals that the characters wrap themselves in are complex and provocative.

I could not believe the way that they had completely changed the look of some of the main characters. So for a while I stopped watching the show, but my curiousity got the best of me, and after it came back after having been on hiatus for a while, I resumed watching it, and I admit, I was hooked.Although many things are completely different than the book series, the show still has that provacative, addictive edge that will keep you coming back for more.Now, if you are a fan of the books, such as myself, yet have never seen the show before, I feel this are some things I must warn you about.First of all, many of the storylines that happen on the show, never happened in the book. I won't go into detail about any of the plots though, because I don't want to give anything away.I was a bit angry about everything being so different at first, but then after having thought about it rationally for a while, I realize that this is after all a TV show, and if they went exactly by the book, chapter for chapter, then the show certainly wouldn't have enough plots to last for more than one season!Second of all, (the thing that disappointed me most) the characters of Dan, Rufus, Jenny, and Vanessa look extremely different on the show, than the way that they are described in the book. Drastically different, in fact. And in the books, Serena has a hot older brother, yet on the show, he turns into her younger brother.But they did get a few of the characters right.The extremely sexy Chace Crawford makes THE perfect Nate Archibald...in fact he may even be more delicious on the show than the way they describe him in the book! The only flaw that he has is that in the book he is a chronic stoner, but not on the show, although that's really no big deal.The lovely Leighton Meester makes a wonderful Blair, actually coming very close to the way I had imagined her to be in the book, and the same goes for the beautiful Blake Lively, who plays the role of Serena.And then we come to Ed Westwick, who plays the role of Chuck Bass. I am extremely impressed. He makes the perfect Chuck, from the way he looks, right down to his personality.So yes, ill admit I started off being very critical, but now I consider myself a fan of the show, and am eagerly awaiting for it to come out on DVD, as well as for the new season to begin.If your a fan of the books, who started out skeptically as I did, then I feel that you should give the show a chance.

An anonymous woman reports on the lives of upper class New Yorkers and people who associate with them, and this is how we penetrate into the lives of Serena, Blair, Nate, Chuck, Dan, Jenny, and eventually Vanessa.The show is very similar to other popular teen shows these days, in the sense that the characters deal with issues with drugs, sex, and family conflicts. What I especially like about this series, though, is that they have pretty witty one-liners and complicated plots in which different characters' situations intertwine.If you're watching Season 4 currently on the CW, but you missed out on one or more of the earlier seasons, you might be a little lost when it comes to what's going on. Thus, I would highly recommend you start watching with Season 1 and work your way up. Even in the new season, the characters make references to events that happened in the first season, and you're not going to know what exactly that was unless you watch it for yourself.Also, it's a really great idea to buy it here on Amazon, as opposed to elsewhere.

1107216,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B000W6ZUUC,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[8, 10]","Finally, a teen drama which scores with its take and spin on the absurd and stupid genre. Everyone knows that this style of drama is far fetched, highly unbelievable, and utterly pathetic when placed in such serious contexts with moral issues. But Josh Schwartz,  the creator of Gossip Girl, is turning the show into a ""close sister"" to his original work: The OC. And his work is the complete opposite of portraying ridiculous incidents for teenagers and their disfunctional parents to take part in such serious manners. Gossip Girl takes a refreshing approach to the teen drama genre with humor, heartfelt moments, self parodies, and not trying to make everything so serious with attempted ""landmarks."" It is because of these traits, that keeps Gossip Girl so interesting and enjoyable to watch. Its viewers know that teen dramas are stupid, its creators know that the genre is stupid, and so they all have fun making it stupid and fun to watch. Nothing more is needed. Making such a genre serious raises the absurdity of a such a show to extreme levels and enjoyment is lost. Josh Schwartz has learned this with his previous work. The OC fans know that ratings on the show tanked during the second and third season due to the attempts for serious writing and loosing the humorous parody of the teen drama. Now if only Schwartz and his team keep that factor in mind and don't do the same thing for the second and third year of Gossip Girl, this series will continue to be a delightful viewing pleasure with great fun.

1107217,A235FM9P7NUROA,B000W6ZUUC,"J. Miller ""Gotmywings2001""","[1, 1]","Remember the episode of ""Seinfeld"" where Jerry claimed to have never seen an episode of ""Melrose Place"". And then under a lie detector test confessed his addiction to it? That's how I feel about Gossip Girl. I read a few articles about it but never saw an episode until its first season finale. I taped it and then all the reruns of the first season (sorry, no DVR yet!). Then I spent Labor Day weekend watching all of them in order. This is a supremely addicting show that only got better as season 1 rolled on and its characters' storylines played out.Gossip Girl is like an east coast version of ""90120"" or ""The O.C."" and follows the spoiled rich kids of New York's upper west side, who live in a world of elite schools, designer clothes, limos and endless excesses. And whose reputations can be made or broken by a few lines in a mysterious website called Gossip Girl. The purveyor of this site is never seen, only heard in voice-overs by Kristen Bell. The series centers on Serena van der Woodson and her return (from parts unknown) to New York, and her reconnecting with her often catty classmate Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meissner) and her denizens at their elite private school. Blair's feelings for another classmate, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), have been jeopardized when she has an ill-fated tryst in a limo. Nate tries to keep himself together as his family slowly implodes and his unrequited love for Blair is tested by the fallout from her limo indiscretion with Chuck Bass. Serena also attempts to reconcile with longtime boyfriend Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgeley), whose younger sister Jenny has fallen under the spell of Blair's clique. With unforeseen and potentially dangerous consequences. Dan still carries a torch for Manhattan's Serena, but must try to balance his feelings with that for old Brooklyn friend Vanessa. And as with any show of this kind, there must be an element of danger. In this case, it's from bad boy Chuck Bass, who cruelly blackmails Blair with details of their limo tryst. Bass becomes even more loathsome for Serena when he becomes her stepbrother. Serena's life gets even more complex when a destructive nemesis from her past (Michelle Trachtenberg of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") shows up and fatally disrupts the new life she's been building since her return to New York.  The end result of this storyline is surprising, as they all band together to ""take down the bitch"" as Chuck so eloquently puts it. But that ""take down"" comes at the cost of Dan & Serena's relationship. But Nate's life starts to look up when he finds a new ally in Serena in the season 1 finale.I've neglected to mention the actress playing Serena, because I must single her out. She's played by Blake Lively (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" films). She is truly one of the most beautiful actresses working today and was made for a part like this. She can play a vulnerable and strong character with ease. I really believe great things are in store for this beauty.Can't believe I'm saying this, but to quote the Gossip Girl;""You know you love me, XO XO""",5,Another guilty pleasure for me!,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3081,"['Remember', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'where', 'Jerry', 'claimed', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'then', 'lie', 'detector', 'test', 'confessed', 'addiction', 'how', 'feel', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'read', 'few', 'articles', 'never', 'saw', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'taped', 'then', 'reruns', 'first', 'season', 'sorry', 'DVR', 'yet', 'Then', 'spent', 'Labor', 'Day', 'weekend', 'watching', 'order', 'supremely', 'addicting', 'show', 'only', 'got', 'better', 'season', '1', 'rolled', 'characters', 'storylines', 'played', 'out.Gossip', 'Girl', 'east', 'coast', 'version', '90120', 'O.C', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kids', 'New', 'York', 'upper', 'west', 'side', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'elite', 'schools', 'designer', 'clothes', 'limos', 'endless', 'excesses', 'reputations', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'broken', 'few', 'lines', 'mysterious', 'website', 'called', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'purveyor', 'site', 'never', 'seen', 'only', 'heard', 'voice-overs', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'series', 'centers', 'Serena', 'van', 'der', 'Woodson', 'return', 'parts', 'unknown', 'New', 'York', 'reconnecting', 'often', 'catty', 'classmate', 'Blair', 'Waldorf', 'Leighton', 'Meissner', 'denizens', 'elite', 'private', 'school', 'Blair', 'feelings', 'classmate', 'Nate', 'Archibald', 'Chace', 'Crawford', 'have', 'been', 'jeopardized', 'when', 'ill-fated', 'tryst', 'limo', 'Nate', 'keep', 'together', 'family', 'slowly', 'implodes', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Blair', 'tested', 'fallout', 'limo', 'indiscretion', 'Chuck', 'Bass', 'Serena', 'also', 'reconcile', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'Dan', 'Humphrey', 'Penn', 'Badgeley', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jenny', 'fallen', 'spell', 'Blair', 'clique', 'unforeseen', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'Dan', 'still', 'torch', 'Manhattan', 'Serena', 'must', 'try', 'balance', 'feelings', 'old', 'Brooklyn', 'friend', 'Vanessa', 'show', 'kind', 'must', 'be', 'element', 'danger', 'case', 'bad', 'boy', 'Chuck', 'Bass', 'who', 'cruelly', 'Blair', 'details', 'limo', 'tryst', 'Bass', 'even', 'more', 'loathsome', 'Serena', 'when', 'stepbrother', 'Serena', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'when', 'destructive', 'nemesis', 'past', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'up', 'fatally', 'disrupts', 'new', 'life', 'been', 'building', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'end', 'result', 'storyline', 'surprising', 'band', 'together', 'take', 'down', 'bitch', 'Chuck', 'so', 'eloquently', 'take', 'down', 'cost', 'Dan', 'Serena', 'relationship', 'Nate', 'life', 'look', 'up', 'when', 'new', 'ally', 'Serena', 'season', '1', 'finale.I', ""'ve"", 'neglected', 'mention', 'actress', 'playing', 'Serena', 'must', 'single', 'out', 'played', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'Sisterhood', 'Traveling', 'Pants', 'films', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'was', 'made', 'part', 'can', 'play', 'vulnerable', 'strong', 'character', 'ease', 'really', 'believe', 'great', 'things', 'are', 'store', 'beauty.Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'quote', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'know', 'love', 'XO', 'XO']",Gossip Girl: Season 1

I said it.I had read the Gossip Girl books back when they first came out. And I liked them. I never did end up finishing the series. So when I heard they were creating a TV show based on the books I was mildly interested. But I actually didn't end up watching it due to my own gripes with the CW network.But I ended up catching the end of an episode posted on youtube (Victor Victrola) and was instantly intrigued. So I watched the previous episodes online. It moved a little slow at first, but it soon picked up. And by the time the next episode aired on TV, I was hooked!Let me just say that this show is NOT anymore scandalous/provocative  than other TV shows! That's all hype that the CW lets build in order to create buzz around the show. So all these parental boards freaking out need to chill. You're kids have probably already seen worse- hate to break it to you.Yeah the show can be silly and dramatized. That's half the fun! And its nice to escape my boring everyday life for an hour and get caught up in it! In my opinion, it blows the novels right out of the water!Another thing I like about the show is the cast. They always seem to be down to earth and cool in real life, and I think they do a great job with the material they're given. Its VERY easy for some of the story lines to become cheesy and redundant (given its technically a TEEN drama), but they always seem to pull it off and make it seem believable.My only con of the DVDs is that there is no cast commentary of an episode. I think that would have been a good feature to have! The bloopers, however, are pretty hilarious.There's a reason there's so much buzz about the show with young and older audiences alike. And that is because it truly is an addicting show. And every week you find yourself more buried in it than the week before. Its a vicious cycle really...I definitely recommend it. Season 2 starts September 1st on the CW and I've never been so happy to see summer end! I know its gonna be good.You know you love it.",4,Gossip Girl is like crack.

Well, I guess someone out there does, but as a group I find them a tedious lot at best, at least in fictional settings.  I suppose I shouldn't have said ""foremost,"" because another reason I have sometimes disliked the show is the way that Josh Schwartz shows (well, at least THE O.C.) tend to introduce extraordinarily unlikable characters that the show persists in keeping right in your face.  In this one we have two inconceivable unpleasant characters, Blair's boyfriend, who has all the personality of a manikin, and his buddy the serial rapist.  My suspicion has always been that Josh Schwartz doesn't understand the difference between characters that we love to hate and characters that we merely hate.So why did this episode appeal to me so much?  Easy.  Neither Manikin Boy nor Serial Rapist Boy are in the episode for even a second.  Instead, the episode focuses mainly on Serena and Dan's first official date and Dan's sister Jenny's experiences at a Blair sleepover where they all play Truth or Dare.Unfortunately, Manikin Boy and Serial Rapist Boy aren't dead and will tragically reappear, dragging the show down every second in which they appear.  My hope is that Schwartz and Co. will have learned from THE O.C. and its string of tediously unlikable characters (from Oliver to the end); my fear is that they haven't.",4,Best episode yet of my top guilty pleasure show,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,1453,"['So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'had', 'really', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'GOSSIP', 'GIRL', 'First', 'foremost', 'who', 'frak', 'social', 'elite', 'Well', 'guess', 'someone', 'there', 'group', 'find', 'tedious', 'lot', 'best', 'least', 'fictional', 'settings', 'suppose', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'foremost', 'reason', 'have', 'sometimes', 'disliked', 'show', 'way', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'well', 'least', 'O.C', 'tend', 'introduce', 'extraordinarily', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'show', 'keeping', 'right', 'face', 'one', 'have', 'two', 'inconceivable', 'unpleasant', 'characters', 'Blair', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'personality', 'manikin', 'buddy', 'serial', 'rapist', 'suspicion', 'always', 'been', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', ""n't"", 'understand', 'difference', 'characters', 'love', 'hate', 'characters', 'merely', 'hate.So', 'why', 'did', 'episode', 'appeal', 'so', 'much', 'Easy', 'Manikin', 'Boy', 'Serial', 'Rapist', 'Boy', 'are', 'episode', 'even', 'second', 'Instead', 'episode', 'mainly', 'Serena', 'Dan', 'first', 'official', 'date', 'Dan', 'sister', 'Jenny', 'experiences', 'Blair', 'sleepover', 'where', 'play', 'Truth', 'Dare.Unfortunately', 'Manikin', 'Boy', 'Serial', 'Rapist', 'Boy', 'are', ""n't"", 'dead', 'will', 'tragically', 'reappear', 'dragging', 'show', 'down', 'second', 'appear', 'hope', 'Schwartz', 'Co.', 'will', 'have', 'learned', 'THE', 'O.C', 'string', 'tediously', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'Oliver', 'end', 'fear', 'have', ""n't""]",Gossip Girl: Season 1
