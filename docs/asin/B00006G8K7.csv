715561,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00006G8K7,Randy Keehn,"[41, 42]","I was looking for some of those old National Geographic nature specials when I came upon this selection of WWII DVD's.  I had a lot of respect for the quality of the National Geographic specials based on what I'd seen on TV over the years.  I expected the same when I ordered this set of DVD's.  I have to admit that the quality of the production is very good.  It's the overall content that disappointed me.The first DVD I watched was titled ""Untold Stories of WWII"".  It had several sideline stories about supposedly little known developments during the war.  The main subject was the Nazi Germany early-stage development towards an atomic bomb.  The events primarily take place in Norway and you probably would enjoy watching the movie ""Heroes of Telemark"" more than this segment.  There's another on the development of the other super weapons that Germany developed towards the end of the war.  There's is also a segment on the Japanese mini-sub which segues into the next DVD I watched.The second DVD of this set that I watched was ""Pearl Harbor-Legacy of Attack"".  This and the final DVD of the series apparently grew out of the funding that the National Geographic Society provided for a couple of undersea explorations.  One was the search for a Japanese mini-sub supoosedly lost during 12/7/41 and the other was for the USS Yorktown lost after the Battle for Midway.  The modern day underwater searches were a questionable aspect of the Pearl Harbor and Midway DVD's.  I enoy the views of sunken ships that have become technologically possible in the last decade or so.  However, they did seem to detract from the recounting of the history of the two battles.  There is a lot of good original films of the two battles, good narration and outstanding reminiscences by surviving veterans.The Pearl Harbor DVD, I felt, was the most worthwhile of the three in the set.  Frankly, I'd recommend that you save money and just buy that one.  It gives a better overview of the battle than does the Midway DVD.  The one on Midway seemed rather sporatic in its' narrative.I'm still looking for those great National Geographic nature specials that I saw when I was growing up.  I'm not sure what to make of the National Geographic's journey into the realm of history.  Maybe if the underwater discoveries are put on the center stage and the rest was just used as background, I might have appreciated these videos more.  As it was, the two battle DVD's seemed to be trying to tell two seperate stories simultaneously and I didn't think that worked too well.",3,Out of their Element?,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2552,"['was', 'looking', 'old', 'National', 'Geographic', 'nature', 'specials', 'when', 'came', 'selection', 'WWII', 'DVD', 'had', 'lot', 'respect', 'quality', 'National', 'Geographic', 'specials', 'based', 'what', ""'d"", 'seen', 'TV', 'years', 'expected', 'same', 'when', 'ordered', 'set', 'DVD', 'have', 'admit', 'quality', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'content', 'disappointed', 'me.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'watched', 'was', 'titled', 'Untold', 'Stories', 'WWII', 'had', 'several', 'sideline', 'stories', 'supposedly', 'little', 'known', 'developments', 'war', 'main', 'subject', 'was', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'early-stage', 'development', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'events', 'primarily', 'take', 'place', 'Norway', 'probably', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'Heroes', 'Telemark', 'more', 'segment', 'development', 'other', 'super', 'weapons', 'Germany', 'developed', 'end', 'war', 'also', 'segment', 'Japanese', 'mini-sub', 'next', 'DVD', 'watched.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'set', 'watched', 'was', 'Pearl', 'Harbor-Legacy', 'Attack', 'final', 'DVD', 'series', 'apparently', 'grew', 'funding', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Society', 'provided', 'couple', 'undersea', 'explorations', 'One', 'was', 'search', 'Japanese', 'mini-sub', 'supoosedly', 'lost', '12/7/41', 'other', 'was', 'USS', 'Yorktown', 'lost', 'Battle', 'Midway', 'modern', 'day', 'underwater', 'searches', 'were', 'questionable', 'aspect', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Midway', 'DVD', 'enoy', 'views', 'sunken', 'ships', 'have', 'become', 'technologically', 'possible', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'However', 'did', 'seem', 'detract', 'recounting', 'history', 'two', 'battles', 'lot', 'good', 'original', 'films', 'two', 'battles', 'good', 'narration', 'outstanding', 'reminiscences', 'surviving', 'veterans.The', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'DVD', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'three', 'set', 'Frankly', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'save', 'money', 'just', 'buy', 'one', 'better', 'overview', 'battle', 'Midway', 'DVD', 'one', 'Midway', 'seemed', 'rather', 'sporatic', 'narrative.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'looking', 'great', 'National', 'Geographic', 'nature', 'specials', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'National', 'Geographic', 'journey', 'realm', 'history', 'Maybe', 'underwater', 'discoveries', 'are', 'put', 'center', 'stage', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'background', 'might', 'have', 'appreciated', 'videos', 'more', 'was', 'two', 'battle', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'tell', 'two', 'seperate', 'stories', 'simultaneously', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'too', 'well']",The Ultimate National Geographic World War - II Collection: (Untold Stories / The Battle for Midway / Pearl Harbor - Legacy of Attack)
