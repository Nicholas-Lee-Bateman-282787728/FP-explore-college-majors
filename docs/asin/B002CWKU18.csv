Centuries later (in 1972), Mamuwalde is released from his coffin by two interior decorators, causing a vampiric assault as the Prince slakes his thirst for human hemoglobin. Marshall is wonderful as the title character, biting his way through to the cop-tossing finale at the local chemical plant. SCREAM, BLACULA, SCREAM has Mamuwalde (Marshall again) resurrected by a voodoo ritual, allowing him to once again bring terror and bloodshed.

I remember this movie so well as when I first saw it over 30 years ago. William Marshall's Blacula character approached two pimps. They were rude and tough. They did not realize that they were staring death in the eye. When Blacula realized who they were and what they were doing, he became quite upset and told them &#34;you are making slaves of yourself and our women&#34;. They then became his victims. His character ooozed with pride. He was a former African Prince. When he became Blacula, he felt shame of the choices he had to make. In one scene he is called by his African name. He is about to strike another victim. At this point he cannot attack his victim. He then corrects his pursuer and tells him &#34;my name is Blacula&#34;. It is then that he can continue his attacks.

The deep-bass voiced and renown stage actor, William Marshall (The Cartoon King on Pee-Wee's Playhouse) is regal as African Prince Mamuwalde who was turned into a vampire.  He pines for his dead wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee) and laments over Dracula's treachery that resulted in his vampirism. This was the first of two Blacula films and ushered in a number of black horror films.  The film itself, follows the formula which was set in LA of the early-1970s.  Of course, Mamuwalde runs into a modern-day woman, Tina (Vonetta McGee) who bares a striking resemblance to his long-dead wife. It works mainly because of Marshall's heartfelt performance and some truly scary scenes.

1262892,ARYPK3ZRXTGWB,B002CWKU18,"J.N. ""Fat Loser""","[0, 0]","I saw Blacula and the sequel 40 years ago when I was a little kid.  I viewed the movies as a straight horror, as any satirical references went over my head.  I saw them again only once after that.  Now with the advent of DVD's and You Tube, films are at your command and I was able to watch both Blacula movies with adult eyes.  I was shocked to discover there were things I missed as a child since you filter out information that isn't immediately gratifying.  As an older adult viewer, new aspects caught my attention.  Blacula was not some scary boogeyman indiscriminately biting people.  He was Mamuwalde, an imposing and intelligent character, whose motivations were the most selfless and genuine.  He was in the process of negotiating with Count Dracula in order to abolish the slave trade.  Mamuwalde cancels the meeting when the Count makes inappropriate advances on his wife and is later cursed.  The rest of the film he spends seeking his lost love.  I did not catch these on my prior viewings.  I love the scene where Mamuwalde takes down two pimps.  He says ""you made a slave of your sister and you're still slaves imitating your slave masters"".  An incredibly insightful statement from a cheesy horror flick.  The thing that stand's out despite the ""blaxploitation"" stamp is William H. Marshall's marvelous performance.  This skilled, stage trained actor turned this b-movie character into a very sincere, memorable, strong anti-hero.  According to interviews, the movie was supposed to be an all out stereotype with a vampire named ""Andrew Brown"".  William Marshall was opposed to this version and fought to make the vampire an African prince named Mamuwalde, who was fighting to end slavery.  Credit should be given to Marshall because this change along with his dominating performance is what I believe made the film a success.  As a character, Mamuwalde transcends the constraints of this movie due to the talents of the late, great William Marshall.",4,A Regal Vampire in a Schlocky Film,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,1967,"['saw', 'Blacula', 'sequel', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'viewed', 'movies', 'straight', 'horror', 'satirical', 'references', 'went', 'head', 'saw', 'again', 'only', 'once', 'Now', 'advent', 'DVD', 'Tube', 'films', 'are', 'command', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'Blacula', 'movies', 'adult', 'eyes', 'was', 'shocked', 'discover', 'were', 'things', 'missed', 'child', 'filter', 'out', 'information', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'gratifying', 'older', 'adult', 'viewer', 'new', 'aspects', 'caught', 'attention', 'Blacula', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'boogeyman', 'indiscriminately', 'biting', 'people', 'was', 'Mamuwalde', 'imposing', 'intelligent', 'character', 'motivations', 'were', 'most', 'selfless', 'genuine', 'was', 'process', 'negotiating', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'order', 'abolish', 'slave', 'trade', 'Mamuwalde', 'meeting', 'when', 'Count', 'inappropriate', 'advances', 'wife', 'later', 'cursed', 'rest', 'film', 'seeking', 'lost', 'love', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'prior', 'viewings', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Mamuwalde', 'down', 'two', 'pimps', 'made', 'slave', 'sister', ""'re"", 'still', 'imitating', 'slave', 'masters', 'incredibly', 'insightful', 'statement', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'flick', 'thing', 'stand', 'out', 'blaxploitation', 'stamp', 'William', 'H.', 'Marshall', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'skilled', 'stage', 'trained', 'actor', 'turned', 'b-movie', 'character', 'very', 'sincere', 'memorable', 'strong', 'anti-hero', 'According', 'interviews', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'out', 'stereotype', 'vampire', 'named', 'Andrew', 'Brown', 'William', 'Marshall', 'was', 'opposed', 'version', 'fought', 'make', 'vampire', 'African', 'prince', 'named', 'Mamuwalde', 'who', 'was', 'fighting', 'end', 'slavery', 'Credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Marshall', 'change', 'dominating', 'performance', 'what', 'believe', 'made', 'film', 'success', 'character', 'Mamuwalde', 'constraints', 'movie', 'due', 'talents', 'late', 'great', 'William', 'Marshall']","Blacula / Scream, Blacula, Scream Double Feature"
