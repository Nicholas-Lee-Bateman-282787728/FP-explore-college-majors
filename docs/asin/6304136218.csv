There are two women involved and the screenwriter has used his God-given talents to assimilate this tidbit of information with the common phrase &quot;too much&quot; (as in an excess) to arrive at the pun &quot;Two Much.&quot; I don't mean to mock, but having watched this movie I feel I can rightly surmise that there must be a village out there somewhere missing an idiot because he was responsible for this. The humor has its moments, but is generally predictable and stale. I really can't make any accurate guesses at the intelligence on the scriptwriters, but their density much be such that light can bend around them.  This film is cliche, poorly acted, and just plain bad.  There are innumerable things that one can do with two hours and I suggest you partake in one of those things.  Just please, do not watch this movie.",2,The title's a pun!,984182400,"03 10, 2001",2001,849,"['Two', 'Much', 'Get', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'involved', 'screenwriter', 'used', 'God-given', 'talents', 'assimilate', 'tidbit', 'information', 'common', 'phrase', 'quot', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'excess', 'arrive', 'pun', 'quot', 'Two', 'Much.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'mock', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'feel', 'can', 'rightly', 'surmise', 'must', 'be', 'village', 'there', 'somewhere', 'missing', 'idiot', 'was', 'responsible', 'humor', 'moments', 'generally', 'predictable', 'stale', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'accurate', 'guesses', 'intelligence', 'scriptwriters', 'density', 'much', 'be', 'such', 'light', 'can', 'bend', 'film', 'cliche', 'poorly', 'acted', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'are', 'innumerable', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'hours', 'suggest', 'partake', 'one', 'things', 'Just', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie']",Two Much VHS

Did they just choose Eli Wallach to be Antonio's dad because they liked him in another film?? NOTHING in this film works, and the actors try to hide that with silly over acting which falls flat at every turn. I expected to see some chemistry between Antonio and Melanie, since this is the movie where they met and fell in love, and yet there was ONE scene that was good, the rest was awful. Maybe the empathy came over dinners commiserating on their choosing this script. Save your money OR go buy 'Miami Rhapsody' instead, it actually IS a comedy.",2,Actors can't make up for a bad script,1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,646,"['Why', 'when', 'often', 'have', 'Spanish', 'actor', 'parents', 'siblings', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'Spanish', 'too', 'Did', 'just', 'choose', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'be', 'Antonio', 'dad', 'liked', 'film', 'NOTHING', 'film', 'actors', 'try', 'hide', 'silly', 'acting', 'flat', 'turn', 'expected', 'see', 'chemistry', 'Antonio', 'Melanie', 'movie', 'where', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'yet', 'was', 'ONE', 'scene', 'was', 'good', 'rest', 'was', 'awful', 'Maybe', 'empathy', 'came', 'dinners', 'commiserating', 'choosing', 'script', 'Save', 'money', 'OR', 'go', 'buy', ""'Miami"", 'Rhapsody', 'instead', 'actually', 'comedy']",Two Much VHS

403426,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,6304136218,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[18, 19]","This movie doesn't require a college degree, isn't Oscar material, and won't make you wake up in the middle of the night pondering its 'true meaning', but it will distract you for a couple of hours and provide you with the opportunity to laugh.Perhaps I find this predicament so humorous because I tried something of the same gambit when I was younger.  Not in such detail, not to such depths (altar), and certainly not with such success.  But remembering my antics provokes a good laugh and so did this film.I loved seeing Antonio Banderas (OK, there could be a period right there, but...) in a comedic role.  I find him believable in any role and...so easy on the eyes.  He makes acting look so easy.  What Billy Bob Thornton accomplishes with only a few choice words, Antonio can do with his eyes.As for what he and Melanie Griffith may have discovered about one another during the filming, I couldn't say.  I still don't know what they have in common, I just trust them to know their hearts.  But in 'Two Much' the chemistry isn't required between THOSE two on the celluloid, it is instead between Antonio and Daryl Hannah.  So if you don't see sparks between Melanie and Antonio, maybe it is due to good acting in their roles as 'lovers' who weren't in love (at least with each other).Certainly the plot wasn't as deep as the well-utlizied pools and the laughs weren't the kind that get you in the gut (except perhaps for the morning race between bedrooms with an ever-present pool in between).  So, maybe I go for cheap laughs.  But I also go for entertainment.  This movie provided that.So watch it with a friend and a bowl of popcorn and let yourself be entertained for a rainy afternoon.  It will temporarily erase the clouds and lift your spirits.",4,"Not TOO much, but just enough....",1026000000,"07 7, 2002",2002,1757,"['movie', ""n't"", 'require', 'college', 'degree', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'material', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'wake', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'pondering', ""'true"", 'meaning', 'will', 'distract', 'couple', 'hours', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'laugh.Perhaps', 'find', 'predicament', 'so', 'humorous', 'tried', 'something', 'same', 'gambit', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Not', 'such', 'detail', 'not', 'such', 'depths', 'altar', 'certainly', 'not', 'such', 'success', 'remembering', 'antics', 'good', 'laugh', 'so', 'did', 'film.I', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'OK', 'could', 'be', 'period', 'right', 'there', 'comedic', 'role', 'find', 'believable', 'role', 'so', 'easy', 'eyes', 'acting', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'What', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'only', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'Antonio', 'can', 'do', 'eyes.As', 'what', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'may', 'have', 'discovered', 'one', 'filming', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'have', 'common', 'just', 'trust', 'know', 'hearts', ""'Two"", 'Much', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'required', 'THOSE', 'two', 'celluloid', 'instead', 'Antonio', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sparks', 'Melanie', 'Antonio', 'maybe', 'due', 'good', 'acting', 'roles', ""'lovers"", 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'love', 'least', 'other', '.Certainly', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'deep', 'well-utlizied', 'pools', 'laughs', 'were', ""n't"", 'kind', 'get', 'gut', 'perhaps', 'morning', 'race', 'bedrooms', 'ever-present', 'pool', 'So', 'maybe', 'go', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'also', 'go', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'provided', 'that.So', 'watch', 'friend', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'let', 'be', 'entertained', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'will', 'temporarily', 'erase', 'clouds', 'lift', 'spirits']",Two Much VHS
