Watching her brought back many fond memories of the original Heather Locklear character Amanda. I completely agree with what one reviewer said about Ashlee Simpson, which was, heard she was on it and said UGH! but then watched it and said OOOOH. She was great as violet, the seemingly nice girl with a dark twist. It was also so great to Laura Leighton aka Sydney Andrews again; I still can't get the opening scene of the series out of my head (you will have to watch it). They really did a good job of combining the old and new characters without feeling forced. The only obvious leap was bringing back Amanda, and let me just say, Bravo to that. You knew ratings were low when they finally brought back the queen b***h, and all I have to say is they should have done that in the beginning, however the series would be called Ella vs. Amanda rather than Melrose Place. The series ended too quickly; they were just about to finish the story lines of intertwining the old and new and were ready to be their own Melrose Place.I realize I may be blinded by my love for the original Melrose Place that I may have missed some flaws of the new series, but I thought it was a really great show.

And they were reusing the same building? PERFECT! But I feel like the producers didn't go far enough. They didn't go ""there"". They mad the same mistakes that the original Melrose Place made in its first season. The only difference is that the original was able to overcome their boring start and transform itself into the guiltiest of pleasures. I feel like the new MP was trying to hard to keep in line with the new 90210. They didn't give us enough drama. And the fact that they brought Sydney back just to kill her off again was ridiculous. Ashley Simpson actually wasn't bad at all in her character but the writers didn't give her enough to work with. They should have made her all-out crazy like Kimberly. It was starting to get good when she threatened to blackmail Michael but then they just kind of dropped that plot. Seeing some of the old faces was great but I didn't like that they were ALL evil, like Jane. and Jane didn't even mention Sydney when she appeared...what was that all about.

1379447,A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,B0040JHPGO,Eric K.,"[11, 12]","Oh,Melrose Place, how I missed you.  I missed Amanda's b*tchiness.  I missed Kimberly ""wigging"" out.  I missed Michael turning from good to evil.  I missed Brooke falling and hitting her head on the side of the pool.  I missed Sydney sleeping with everybody.When I heard that they were bringing back Melrose with some of the original characters, I was ELATED.  It was the must-see show for me for the Fall 2009 TV season.  Unfortunately, it didn't last long, being cancelled after one season.  And just when I was getting to know (and love) all of the new characters.  As the season went on, the plotlines got a little wackier and reminded me of Melrose Place of yesteryear.  And the guest appearances by some of the former cast members of the old series made me absolutely giddy.  Melrose Place was again a guilty pleasure for me.Before the show was aired, I had read about some of the casting choices.  When I heard about Ashlee Simpson being added, I thought, ""UGH.""  After seeing her on there, though, my opinion changed completely.  She was actually...good.  Her character, Violet, was kind of creepy (in a good way, like Kimberly used to be), and I looked forward to seeing her in this role every week.  Her tie to Sydney from the original show (who also appears in this series) intrigued me as well.The stand-out character from the new show had to be Ella.  She was b*tchy like Amanda, but with a heart.  She had some of the best dialogue, and Katie Cassidy played the part to a ""T.""I don't know what more there is to say about this show but R.I.P., Melrose.

Although I was highly disappointed when it was cancelled, it didn't make me want to hate the show, it made me want to hate the CW! I'm sure it would've lasted if it were back on FOX.

Fantastic Vixen. But personally, I think they should've focused more on the new characters rather than bringing back the old cast. (Minus Heather Locklear).

It's the content that counts. Even though it only has one special feature, it's very good. It has interviews with the cast from the new and older version of Melrose Place.

The set is a step up from the old Melrose apartments-swankier and the apartments are gorgeous--not at all like the 'real' Melrose.I really started getting into the story around the third tape but since there were only four tapes in this collection I wondered how on earth they would end it. Well I found out. You pretty much had to figure that out for yourself. Nothing was completely 'wrapped up-storyline-wise' but another dvd would have been better and gone further to close out each storyline.It seems that this Melrose was not on TV but went straight to DVD. The previous actors who played in the original series - Michael, Amanda, Jane, Jo and Sydney made appearances but Michael was still a sex maniac and a rotten person all around (we kind of knew that from the old Michael). Amanda was the one with the most dialogue and the other 'oldtimers' were on the show in small parts. It was great seeing them again and how good they all looked after ten years but I was going crazy waiting for Jake to show up and he didn't! Damn is all I have to say about that.I didn't know any of the cast members; never saw any of them before but I must say the acting was first rate though the story couldn't compare with the original. The end was a disappointment  for there were four shows on each disc-four discs in all at the price of 35.00-- a mighty sum for what you got.Mostly the show made me want to see ALL of the other characters we grew to love or hate and even those who had little more than cameos didn't suffice.To sum up it wasn't terrible but I didn't get closure! I hate to guess what happened when a show leaves things up in the air--you could figure it out I suppose but I like to see it played out.For the money it really wasn't worth it-in my opinion!",3,An attempt-not bad-not great-not terrific and certainly not worth the price.,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,1869,"['had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'third', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', ""'Melrose"", 'Place', 'set', 'step', 'up', 'old', 'Melrose', 'apartments-swankier', 'apartments', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'not', ""'real"", 'Melrose.I', 'really', 'started', 'getting', 'story', 'third', 'tape', 'were', 'only', 'four', 'tapes', 'collection', 'wondered', 'how', 'earth', 'would', 'end', 'Well', 'found', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'Nothing', 'was', 'completely', ""'wrapped"", 'up-storyline-wise', 'dvd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'gone', 'further', 'close', 'out', 'storyline.It', 'Melrose', 'was', 'not', 'TV', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'previous', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'series', 'Michael', 'Amanda', 'Jane', 'Jo', 'Sydney', 'made', 'appearances', 'Michael', 'was', 'still', 'sex', 'maniac', 'rotten', 'person', 'kind', 'knew', 'old', 'Michael', 'Amanda', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'dialogue', 'other', ""'oldtimers"", 'were', 'show', 'small', 'parts', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'again', 'how', 'good', 'looked', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'going', 'crazy', 'waiting', 'Jake', 'show', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'Damn', 'have', 'say', 'that.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'cast', 'members', 'never', 'saw', 'must', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'compare', 'original', 'end', 'was', 'disappointment', 'were', 'four', 'shows', 'disc-four', 'discs', 'price', '35.00', 'mighty', 'sum', 'what', 'got.Mostly', 'show', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'characters', 'grew', 'love', 'hate', 'even', 'who', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'cameos', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffice.To', 'sum', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'closure', 'hate', 'guess', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'show', 'things', 'up', 'air', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'suppose', 'like', 'see', 'played', 'out.For', 'money', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'it-in', 'opinion']",N/A

That series alone help make the FOX network what it is today. So, it wasn't surprising when the new network, The CW, decided to bring ""Melrose Place"" back this time with an entirely new cast as well as some old favorites the fans hadn't seen since the original.The new ""Melrose Place"", unfortunately, wasn't given a chance to survive in today's television market. If the series had been back on FOX I am sure the soap wouldn have survived. Having the series air on The CW, a network that has been struggling for survival, really killed its chances of gaining an audience of any kind.The series was extremely well-done with beautiful actors and good scripts. And the fact that it took place in the same apartment building made it a must-see TV show. I found these new inhabitants even more interesting than the old characters on the original. The two best characters were Ella (Katie Cassidy), a beautiful bisexual woman written along the same lines as Amanda, and gorgeous hunk David, played by stud Shaun Sipos, who is Michael Mancini's son caught up in a ton of trouble. The serial opened with the murder of Sydney Andrews and the question, ""what tenant of ""Melrose Place"" killed her?"".Thankfully, all 18 episodes of this great show are available on DVD along with cast interviews in a deluxe 6 disc set.Again, it is too bad this show never had a chance to make a name for itself in the television ratings. It took the original a few seasons before it found itself and look at what that series eventually became. However, the powers-that-be gave up on the show when Heather Locklear's  much hyped return as Amanda didn't bring a rise in ratings.
