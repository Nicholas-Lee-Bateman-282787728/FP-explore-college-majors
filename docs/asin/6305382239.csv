462732,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6305382239,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","LikeTHE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY(1947), Melville Shavelson's THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN (1972) has an unusual subtext of fantasy. In this romantic comedy based on the writings and cartoons of James Thurber, Jack Lemmon is a cartoon satirist and long-time bachelor with a dislike for women, dogs and especially kids, who turns his world upside down for love.Peter Wilson's been blind in his right eye since childhood and now his left has developed a sympathetic disease that is likely to leave him sightless. While the good eye is dilated at the opthamologist's office he stumbles into another patient, getting a handhold on her breast to break his fall. An unlikely beginning for what would lead to marriage.Book publicist Theresa Kozlenko (Barbara Harris) is a divorc&eacute;e with three kids, so based on Peter's propensities their union seems unlikey, but it happens. Barbara's ex, world famous news photographer Stephen Kozlenko (Jason Robards Jr.), shows up at the Wilsons' backyard wedding and he later becomes an annoying fixture in their home.When his marriage gets a bit rocky, Peter's resentment toward this perceived rival for Theresa's affections turns to brotherly bonding. They tie a good one on and in an act of rebellion against wifely interference commiserate about this story's so-called war. This introduces an artistic highlight of the film. Peter draws on bare walls outlines in his inimitable style of two women on horses. They come to life and attack him and Stephen. It's women vs. men in an all-out to-the-death struggle that includes bows and arrows, spearguns, bats, biplanes and Moshe Dayan's tank..The other Thurber moment is far more charming, a gentle scene between Peter and stepdaughter Linda (Lisa Gerritsen). He presents the troubled pre-teen with his latest work and they read it together. Lemmon narratesTHE LAST FLOWER, which is magnificently animated, and the best thing in this domestic comedy that's recommended for all James Thurber and/or Jack Lemmon fans.Cast includes Herb Edelman, Moosie Drier, Severn Darden, Joey Faye, Alan DeWitt, Dr. Joyce Brothers and producer/scripter Danny Arnold. An amusing music score is by Marvin Hamlisch.",5,Longest continuous battle in human history,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2186,"['LikeTHE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', '1947', 'Melville', 'Shavelson', 'THE', 'WAR', 'BETWEEN', 'MEN', 'AND', 'WOMEN', '1972', 'unusual', 'subtext', 'fantasy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'based', 'writings', 'cartoons', 'James', 'Thurber', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'cartoon', 'satirist', 'long-time', 'bachelor', 'dislike', 'women', 'dogs', 'especially', 'kids', 'who', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'love.Peter', 'Wilson', 'been', 'blind', 'right', 'eye', 'childhood', 'now', 'left', 'developed', 'sympathetic', 'disease', 'likely', 'leave', 'sightless', 'good', 'eye', 'dilated', 'opthamologist', 'office', 'patient', 'getting', 'handhold', 'breast', 'break', 'fall', 'unlikely', 'beginning', 'what', 'would', 'lead', 'marriage.Book', 'publicist', 'Theresa', 'Kozlenko', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'three', 'kids', 'so', 'based', 'Peter', 'propensities', 'union', 'unlikey', 'Barbara', 'ex', 'world', 'famous', 'news', 'photographer', 'Stephen', 'Kozlenko', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'up', 'Wilsons', 'backyard', 'wedding', 'later', 'annoying', 'fixture', 'home.When', 'marriage', 'bit', 'rocky', 'Peter', 'resentment', 'perceived', 'rival', 'Theresa', 'affections', 'brotherly', 'bonding', 'tie', 'good', 'one', 'act', 'rebellion', 'wifely', 'interference', 'commiserate', 'story', 'so-called', 'war', 'artistic', 'highlight', 'film', 'Peter', 'bare', 'walls', 'outlines', 'inimitable', 'style', 'two', 'women', 'horses', 'come', 'life', 'attack', 'Stephen', 'women', 'vs.', 'men', 'all-out', 'to-the-death', 'struggle', 'bows', 'arrows', 'spearguns', 'bats', 'biplanes', 'Moshe', 'Dayan', 'tank..The', 'other', 'Thurber', 'moment', 'far', 'more', 'charming', 'gentle', 'scene', 'Peter', 'stepdaughter', 'Linda', 'Lisa', 'Gerritsen', 'troubled', 'pre-teen', 'latest', 'work', 'read', 'together', 'Lemmon', 'LAST', 'FLOWER', 'magnificently', 'animated', 'best', 'thing', 'domestic', 'comedy', 'recommended', 'James', 'Thurber', 'and/or', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'fans.Cast', 'Herb', 'Edelman', 'Moosie', 'Drier', 'Severn', 'Darden', 'Joey', 'Faye', 'Alan', 'DeWitt', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Brothers', 'producer/scripter', 'Danny', 'Arnold', 'amusing', 'music', 'score', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch']",The War Between Men & Women VHS

462734,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6305382239,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","My guess is that, sadly, there are few people living today who know the name of James Thurber. A noted humorist and cartoonist, Thurber was hailed as one of the greats for many years. A TV series called MY LIFE AND WELCOME TO IT aired in the 60s based on his life and drawings. But today he is long forgotten. Unless of course you check out THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.Jack Lemmon stars as Peter, a divorced man who draws and writes for a living and who has decided that men and women should not co-mingle. In his mind's eye the only thing it leads to is a disruptive life at best and mental cruelty at worst. Of course this means that before long he'll meet someone special enough that he'll want to get married.Enter Theresa (Barbara Harris), a woman he meets in the waiting room of his eye doctor. You see Peter also has a problem that will completely affect his work: he's losing his sight. This is not something he shares with anyone, including his friends. So this first encounter with Theresa doesn't go well. They do contact one another and eventually spend the night together. An interest develops and soon Peter not only finds himself married but with three children and a pet dog as well.As if this wasn't enough to complicate Peter's life and his various crotchety attacks on women via his drawings and writings, Theresa's ex-husband suddenly falls into the picture. Steven (Jason Robards) is the adventurer extraordinaire, a prize winning photographer who has traveled the world and taken pictures from various war torn countries. He is a hero in his children's eyes and a pain in the posterior to Peter as he flirts with his ex from the moment he arrives...and invites himself to stay with them.Seen at first as adversaries circumstances lead the two men to become friends of a sort ending with a war of cartoon characters on the walls of Peter and Theresa's home between men and women. Just how the actual battle involving all three parties is resolved makes for an interesting film at times but not the blockbuster that Paramount was expecting.There are moments that are truly touching, most notably a story that Peter shares with Theresa's middle daughter Linda (Lisa Gerritsen) involving a world that falls apart and is saved by a flower. Based on one of Thurber's actual stories it helps her come to grips with the world she lives in.This movie is being released on DVD and for fans of Lemmon who feel the need to own everything he ever made you'll be pleased. For the rest of us we get a movie that isn't too bad but nothing special either. It truly feels dated from the clothing to the atmosphere to just the way the movie is made. It isn't a great movie but it could provide a decent night's entertainment.",3,THURBER COMES ALIVE,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2730,"['guess', 'sadly', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'living', 'today', 'who', 'know', 'name', 'James', 'Thurber', 'A', 'noted', 'humorist', 'cartoonist', 'Thurber', 'was', 'hailed', 'one', 'greats', 'many', 'years', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'MY', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'WELCOME', 'TO', 'IT', 'aired', '60s', 'based', 'life', 'drawings', 'today', 'long', 'forgotten', 'course', 'check', 'out', 'THE', 'WAR', 'BETWEEN', 'MEN', 'AND', 'WOMEN.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Peter', 'divorced', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'who', 'decided', 'men', 'women', 'should', 'not', 'co-mingle', 'mind', 'eye', 'only', 'thing', 'disruptive', 'life', 'best', 'mental', 'cruelty', 'worst', 'course', 'before', 'long', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'someone', 'special', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'married.Enter', 'Theresa', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'woman', 'waiting', 'room', 'eye', 'doctor', 'see', 'Peter', 'also', 'problem', 'will', 'completely', 'affect', 'work', 'losing', 'sight', 'not', 'something', 'shares', 'anyone', 'including', 'friends', 'So', 'first', 'encounter', 'Theresa', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'do', 'contact', 'one', 'eventually', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'interest', 'develops', 'soon', 'Peter', 'not', 'only', 'married', 'three', 'children', 'pet', 'dog', 'well.As', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'complicate', 'Peter', 'life', 'various', 'crotchety', 'attacks', 'women', 'drawings', 'writings', 'Theresa', 'ex-husband', 'suddenly', 'picture', 'Steven', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'adventurer', 'extraordinaire', 'prize', 'winning', 'photographer', 'who', 'traveled', 'world', 'taken', 'pictures', 'various', 'war', 'torn', 'countries', 'hero', 'children', 'eyes', 'pain', 'posterior', 'Peter', 'ex', 'moment', 'stay', 'them.Seen', 'first', 'adversaries', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'friends', 'sort', 'ending', 'war', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'walls', 'Peter', 'Theresa', 'home', 'men', 'women', 'Just', 'how', 'actual', 'battle', 'involving', 'three', 'parties', 'resolved', 'interesting', 'film', 'times', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'Paramount', 'was', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'truly', 'touching', 'most', 'notably', 'story', 'Peter', 'shares', 'Theresa', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Linda', 'Lisa', 'Gerritsen', 'involving', 'world', 'apart', 'saved', 'flower', 'Based', 'one', 'Thurber', 'actual', 'stories', 'come', 'grips', 'world', 'in.This', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Lemmon', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'own', 'everything', 'ever', 'made', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'rest', 'get', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'nothing', 'special', 'either', 'truly', 'feels', 'dated', 'clothing', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'way', 'movie', 'made', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'provide', 'decent', 'night', 'entertainment']",The War Between Men & Women VHS

462736,A1MG78N06W1BZU,6305382239,Murrell R. Morgan,"[1, 1]","Jack Lemmon is great in this movie, but Barbara Harris steals the show. Like Edward G. Robinson and Michael Douglas- I never saw her give a bad performance. Its a shame in my opinion that Ms. Harris never hit it big in movies-although I suspect that the smart and astute Ms. Harris was smart and  discerning and took film roles that were first rate. I was 18 in 1972 and the movie is faithful to all of the quirks of that time ( the technology of that time-changing relationship roles and great sense of trust and order in the society of then vs the chaotic complexity of today's globalized world  .) This film  shows a world where at least the older generation :(Ms Harris and Mr Lemmon were around 45 years old when this movie was filmed)eventually sought after and found  romance old fashioned love and long term relationships were seen as desirable, possible, and the norm. What I like best is that  all of the characters in this movie  immerse themselves in the character so that you forget you are watching a movie and seeing a slice of real life. Indeed the movie was based on a novel that I suspect was based on actual life experience.  Young folks will find this dated for many of the reasons I've outlined, however it might work for them as a look into their grandparents world- and in some cases why people may think and feel they way they do.
