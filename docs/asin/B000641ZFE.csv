How could anything starring Diana Rigg, John Cleese, Felicity Kendal, and Oliver Reed be bad?  It is. Very.The plot is predictable, and there isn't a smile, let alone a laugh in the whole of the film, billed as a ""black comedy.""  Indeed, the movie hasn't a single redeeming feature.  The music is irritating, and even the photography isn't very well done.  Oh yes, and Rigg was 25 years too old to play the part she was given.  See her in bed with a man easily old enough to be her son.  Mercifully, we were spared a nude scene.

His career as a restaurant critic was taking off and his colorful TV commercial career was just around the corner. The industry had changed and Winner's type of medium budget films were no longer being financed. So, for his swan song, he decided to make a movie for himself using a story that he wrote and peopled with several friends from the British film industry. The result was the appropriately titled PARTING SHOTS. In the director's written commentary which is one of the DVD's special features, Winner explains how he wanted to make a film that harked back to the Ealing comedies of Alec Guinness especially KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS. Combine the spirit of that film with the scenario of Winner's best known film DEATH WISH and this is the result.Singer-songwriter Chris Rea (no relation to Stephen) plays Harry Sterndale, a less than successful photographer who discovers that he has only 6 weeks to live. When told by his lawyer (Peter Davison) to put his affairs in order, he acquires an illegal gun (remember this is England) and decides to bump off everyone who took advantage of him or made him feel miserable. These include his bitchy ex-wife (Diana Rigg), a crooked financier (Bob Hoskins), and a business associate (John Cleese) who stole his ideas. Along the way he meets the love of his life (Felicity Kendal) and in order to provide for her, he hires a hitman (Oliver Reed) to bump him off for the insurance money but then things do not go according to Harry's plans.The film opened to less than stellar reviews (as did so many of Michael Winner's later offerings) and quickly disappeared. This Canadian DVD allows us to see the film again and to appreciate it for what it is instead of what it isn't. While lead actor Chris Rea is not to everyone's taste (I think he's fine), there are a host of delightful performances from the rest of the cast including Ben Kingsley as an egotistical chef and Joanna Lumley as a New Age bartender. The DVD comes with cast bios, background trivia, and the aforementioned written commentary from director Winner. Try it, I think you'll like it. Just don't expect Monty Python or Simon Pegg style English humor and for heaven's sake, don't expect the British version of DEATH WISH.",4,DEATH WISH Meets KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS.,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2293,"['1998', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'had', 'had', 'movie', 'business', 'career', 'restaurant', 'critic', 'was', 'taking', 'off', 'colorful', 'TV', 'commercial', 'career', 'was', 'just', 'corner', 'industry', 'had', 'changed', 'Winner', 'type', 'medium', 'budget', 'films', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'financed', 'So', 'swan', 'song', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'using', 'story', 'wrote', 'peopled', 'several', 'friends', 'British', 'film', 'industry', 'result', 'was', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'PARTING', 'SHOTS', 'director', 'written', 'commentary', 'one', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Winner', 'how', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'harked', 'back', 'Ealing', 'comedies', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'especially', 'KIND', 'HEARTS', 'AND', 'CORONETS', 'Combine', 'spirit', 'film', 'scenario', 'Winner', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'result.Singer-songwriter', 'Chris', 'Rea', 'relation', 'Stephen', 'Harry', 'Sterndale', 'less', 'successful', 'photographer', 'who', 'only', '6', 'weeks', 'live', 'When', 'told', 'lawyer', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'illegal', 'gun', 'remember', 'England', 'bump', 'off', 'everyone', 'who', 'took', 'advantage', 'made', 'feel', 'miserable', 'include', 'bitchy', 'ex-wife', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'crooked', 'financier', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'business', 'associate', 'John', 'Cleese', 'who', 'stole', 'ideas', 'way', 'love', 'life', 'Felicity', 'Kendal', 'order', 'provide', 'hitman', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'bump', 'off', 'insurance', 'money', 'then', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'according', 'Harry', 'plans.The', 'film', 'opened', 'less', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'later', 'offerings', 'quickly', 'disappeared', 'Canadian', 'DVD', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'appreciate', 'what', 'instead', 'what', ""n't"", 'lead', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Rea', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'think', 'fine', 'are', 'host', 'delightful', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'egotistical', 'chef', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'New', 'Age', 'bartender', 'DVD', 'cast', 'bios', 'background', 'trivia', 'aforementioned', 'written', 'commentary', 'director', 'Winner', 'Try', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'style', 'English', 'humor', 'heaven', 'sake', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'British', 'version', 'DEATH', 'WISH']",Parting Shots

Its interesting to watch the lead actor (who is a musician and I don't believe had ever acted before), because he doesn't act like an ""actor"" (because he isn't). Some big names make very brief appearances (namely a hilarious John Cleese), but we could've used more of Ben Kingsley in a fun role.

858532,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B000641ZFE,Stephen C. Coyle,"[0, 0]","The traditional saying is that nice guys finish last.Harry Sterndale is a nice guy, and he's been getting stepped on, abused, exploited, lied to and scammed his entire life.  He was bullied in school, one of his friends stole an advertising idea from his and got rich off of it (and got Harry fired while he was at it), a con-man scammed Harry out of 50,000 and his wife (now his ex-wife) spent years verbally abusing Harry for trusting the con-man (even though she enthusiastically lobbied Harry to hand the money over and insisted that giving 50,000 to this guy was a ""no risk"" proposition)and then she divorced him for being ""a failure"".Harry has spent his life accepting such abuse without raising his voice or taking any sort of retaliatory action against his tormentors.  In real life he would probably have continued to follow the same course of action (or inaction) until the day he died.  However because this is a movie, things play out rather differently.When Harry is diagnosed with an inoperable form of cancer (and given six weeks to live) he decides to exact revenge on everybody who had ever done him wrong.  He goes down to a pub and purchases a 9 millimeter handgun from a barmaid named Fred and then methodically proceeds to murder those who had abused and victimized him earlier in life.Since Harry has been given a mere six weeks to live, Harry doesn't put a lot of effort into hiding his guilt.  Murder trials can drag on for months, so Harry figures that if he's arrested, he'll be dead before a jury can ever reach a verdict.I thought I knew how this movie would end (it SEEMED predictable at the outset); however the movie actually had a MUCH happier ending than I was expecting!
