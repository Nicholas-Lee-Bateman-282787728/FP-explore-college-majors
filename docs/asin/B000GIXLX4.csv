1004985,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GIXLX4,A Customer,"[53, 56]","Directed by Saul Dibbs, this opulent adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty - his decadent coming of age novel about love, class, sex and money set in the hypocritical Thatcherite Eighties - is indeed a feast for the eye.  Beautifully acted, with a spot-on affinity for detailing time and place, The Line of Beauty replicates Hollinghurst's hedonistic themes and the moral quandaries of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens), the titular middle-class outsider in this world of privilege.As with the book, this film adaptation begins in 1983 when the young twenty-year-old Nick Guest is asked by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to come and stay with his family in their sumptuous Notting Hill home in the Kensington Park Gardens estate. Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a sycophantic Tory Member of Parliament who is on the rise, and is basking in the glory of Thatcher's economic policies. Gerald lives with loyal wife Rachel (Alice Krigg), his daughter Catherine (Hayle Atwell), and Toby.Nick's comes from a provincial, terribly middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - but he is welcomed into the Fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time, he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic and troubled Catherine. Nick is wined and dined, enthusiastically partaking of the family's lavish parties and political dinners, trying to impress them in their superficial discussions on literature, art and antiques.Nick tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom, but he's unsure of his footing in this opulent, prosperous looking-glass world. In fact, Dan Stevens plays Nick with a kind of wide-eyed, eloquent fury, always nicely mannered, but forever hidden is the ever-present pretension and affectation, and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror, this troubled man finds it reluctant to give its approval.Nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure, yet when he falls in love with Leo, (Don Gilet) a lusty black cockney and socialist council worker, he finds himself caught in a Jamesian-like dilemma, wedged between the powerful, privileged life led by the Feddens and their friends, whilst also having to face the stark realities of Eighties Britain - the vast unemployment and the rise of AIDS.The second and third episodes of the series feature Nick's relationship with Wani (Alex Wyndham), a long-lashed Lebanese millionaire playboy. While working as a creative consultant on Wani's new magazine, Ogee - named after the curve that is Hogarth's line of beauty - Nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes, moneyed decadence, and cocaine-fueled days and nights. And of course this all culminates in the beautifully recreated coke-fuelled dance with ""The Lady"" herself, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (Kika Markham).This BBC adaptation follows Hollinghurst's book pretty much to the letter, although in some instances, the film fails to catch much of the subtleness and nuance of the source material. The scenes involving Nick's sex and coke binges in the toilets and bedrooms of his grand surroundings seem hurriedly cut short, and the pivotal scene of the dreary piano recital fails to capture the tiniest social shenanigans and inherent boredom of all the guests as well as it could.Also, when the Fedden's take Nick on their holiday to France, the pacing slows a bit, but thankfully picks up speed again in readiness for the final d&eacute;nouement, the penultimate dance with The Lady. The cast is solid throughout, but Stevens is without a doubt the standout, imbuing Nick with a neediness and an obvious desire to be loved. He speaks his emotions and is in need of reassurance of his place within the Fedden household. He exists in a limbo space of not quite belonging, and in innocence of the dark undertones of the world he has entered.Amidst the euphoria of first love, champagne and high society parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, deception, and the ultimate hypocrisy towards his sexuality, and that of his bretheren. The unsaid mantra is that it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you keep it quiet and do it in private. The Line of Beauty is indeed a richly textured coming-of-age story, and accomplished adaptation of a classic work of literature set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade of change and transformation.

1004986,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B000GIXLX4,A. Hickman,"[7, 11]","Noteworty, but probably a matter of personal taste, is this 3-part TV miniseries from Britain, ""The Line of Beauty,"" on BBC Video, which is based on the Booker-prize winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst.  If you know anything about Thatcher's England in the 1980s, a period of excess that included the introduction of AIDS and the Falklands War, this might appeal to you.  But the characters are mostly unsympathetic, and the story lacks cohesion (as in the novel).  Nick Guest (get it?) comes to live with the family of an up-and-coming Tory politician who lives to please ""The Lady.""  Nick's entree into this world is the politician's straight son Toby (this thread goes nowhere), but he stays on to look after Toby's dysfunctional sister, Cat (whose name may as well be short for catalyst as for Catherine).  There are some grand moments, as when Nick takes Thatcher for a turn on the dance floor, but it all leaves a pretty sour taste in the mouth.  Nick goes on to live with the Feddens for four years, at the end of which he is sadder but probably no wiser.  The actors do a fine job (Dan Stevens will no doubt go on to do a biopic of Oscar Wilde one day), and there are some pretty weighty issues bandied about, but you'll have to decide for yourself whether you want to invest three hours in the lives of these, ultimately, unattractive and rather clueless people.",4,Clueless in Thatcherland,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1370,"['Noteworty', 'probably', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', '3-part', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Britain', 'Line', 'Beauty', 'BBC', 'Video', 'based', 'Booker-prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Hollinghurst', 'know', 'anything', 'Thatcher', 'England', '1980s', 'period', 'excess', 'included', 'introduction', 'AIDS', 'Falklands', 'War', 'might', 'appeal', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'unsympathetic', 'story', 'cohesion', 'novel', 'Nick', 'Guest', 'get', 'live', 'family', 'up-and-coming', 'Tory', 'politician', 'who', 'please', 'Lady', 'Nick', 'entree', 'world', 'politician', 'straight', 'son', 'Toby', 'thread', 'nowhere', 'look', 'Toby', 'dysfunctional', 'sister', 'Cat', 'name', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'short', 'catalyst', 'Catherine', 'are', 'grand', 'moments', 'when', 'Nick', 'Thatcher', 'turn', 'dance', 'floor', 'pretty', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Nick', 'live', 'Feddens', 'four', 'years', 'end', 'sadder', 'probably', 'wiser', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'will', 'doubt', 'go', 'do', 'biopic', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'pretty', 'weighty', 'issues', 'bandied', ""'ll"", 'have', 'decide', 'want', 'invest', 'three', 'hours', 'lives', 'ultimately', 'unattractive', 'rather', 'clueless', 'people']",The Line of Beauty
1004987,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B000GIXLX4,-Ashi-,"[2, 2]","June 24, 2008 (original review, with minor edit)There is much to learn from UK's treatment of homosexuality in films.  The subtle detail of realism is often absent in American version of the gay cinema.  The story does not insult viewer's intelligence with some self-pity fest or wrap things up in an unbelievable Hollywood ending.The undertone of the story is rather grim, much likeBreakfast on Pluto.  The future is viewed as bleak and hopeless.  The way it unfolds is likeMaurice, so it's not really for people with short attention span.  Fortunately, the story is divided into three episodes, and can be viewed more or less independently.  The story can sink one's heart rather deep, so be forewarned.The main character is called Nick Guest.  Like his surname suggests, he could not find a place where he belonged.  The way I see it, he is this paradigm figure that represents every gay man.  He had fun, had made a career, while it lasted....  He thought he had love and friendship, but everything was but a grand illusion.  After that, he moved on again, with uncertainty.The very last spoken line wrapped up everything....  When Nick decided to move on and move out of the house he had made it home for the last four years, he had a little chat with Elena,.  He amusingly recalled he had mistaken the maid as the mistress of the house.  Elena, with a smiling indifference, said something like, ""You know when you first came..., I thought to myself, you were no good.""  To me, that is the line that hurts the most; an in-your-face denial of the familial connection.The film captures the essence of what is like to be gay very well (from a soul-searching perspective).  It's not without flaw, however.  I was quite baffled at how Nick could flip from sexually-inexperienced to someone who engaged public sex with a stranger.  He also seemed to know how to do it (from behind) at his first try....In any case, it's a good gay film that deserves to be called a drama (and not to be mistaken as a ""drama"" ;-)).  Whole-heartily recommended, but please watch it when you're not already too depressed.* * *August 14, 2009 (update)It's been a year since I first watched ""The Line of Beauty.""  The story haunted me in a heart-sinking but beautiful way.  A romantic notion, I guess.  I noticed the screen writer this time.  What a surprise, my favorite, Mr. Andrew Davies!  No wonder the treatment is so sublime and simply beautiful.  For those who aren't veterans of BBC dramas, Andrew Davies is responsible for many successes of classics novel adaptions such as 1995 version of Jane Austen'sPride and Prejudice(with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle), and 2005 version of Charles Dickens'sBleak House(with Gillian Anderson).  He seems to have a great touch to turn everything into gold (except for one, but that's only my opinion).Anyways, here is what I think after the second screening.  The story remained more or less the same of how I remembered.  However, I found out there are more sex scenes than I first awared.  Don't know how that happened.  Maybe I was so focused on the story, my mind skipped them, despite they were rather daring acts.  Some people who reviewed the original novel mentioned they were offended by the number of sexual elements.  The original novel,The Line of Beautyby Alan Hollinghurst, is 2004's Booker Prize winner, by the way.If you think my original review is a little muddy, well, I am not going to change that.  However, I do want to explain what I think about Nick's character, which many people neither understand nor could relate to (I don't remember who said it's okay for the reader not able to relate to his character, because that means the character is refreshing).  He did not suck up the family for his own benefit.  He was accused of doing so by Gerald, when his political career went kaboom.  Imagine yourself in Nick's shoes.  His position in society was grossly under that of the rest of the family.  He had to be tactful and be diplomatic.That brings up an interesting observation.  For those who have watchedThe Talented Mr. Ripley, you might remember Tom Ripley did a gig as a classical pianist, but Dickie liked jazz.  Nick Guest also played a Mozart to Catherine, probably that's what he thought a grand family like hers would do, but Catherine thought it was like a funeral or something so she played some punk rock on the radio.  Subconsciously, people do that sort of things.  But some reviewers of the novel or DVD did get frustrated and called it sucking up to the high society.  If that's the case, then they are just as bad as Gerald, and totally missed the point why it was such a tragic event for Nick.I'm going to use another example, this time withMansfield Park.  I'm not entirely sure if it's in the novel (I'm not that far into it yet, but I am reading it), but in the movie version Fanny was caught between two worlds.  She was born in an under-privileged household, but brought up in a high-society.  She was constantly reminded that she was below everyone else in the rich household.  When she decided to retreat to her blood family, figured she would be treated as equal, but ironically everyone thought she was too grand a lady.  That's Nick.  He is a guy, obviously, but I mean it doesn't matter where he goes, he is not received properly.So... to my fellow Americans, yes, you DO understand class system.  I had strangers decided to talk to me in big words when they were obviously not comfortable using it.  Perhaps I should be flattered that they thought of me as a grand lady (though I am neither).  The effect of education, I suppose.  ;-D  (yes, that's from Rozema's version of Mansfield Park featuring Frances O'Connor)  (*ponders a bit then laughs at his own remark*)In the last of the three-part mini-series, you can tell Nick was genuinely absorbed into the way of this strangely dysfunctional family, which had a value very different from his own.  People do get comfortable in a place, especially when one treats it like their home already.  What did he get at the end?  These people who he spent four years, lived, laughed, endured crisis(eseseses) with, just HAD to hurt him, only because he was gay.  Mr. Nick Guest, where do you beautifully belong?",5,A Life Perpetual Wandering,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,6230,"['June', '24', '2008', 'original', 'review', 'minor', 'edit', 'much', 'learn', 'UK',

1004989,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000GIXLX4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[12, 13]","This three-part, three-hour drama, based on Alan Hollinghurst's novel of the same name, has much going for it. Taking place in 3 episodes in 1983, 1986, and 1987; many themes are explored with sensitivity and insight. However, I would like to focus this review on just one aspect of the film, which is the price of privilege.Middle-class Nick Guest (played well by handsome Dan Stevens) is attracted to his best friend Toby Fedden (played by Oliver Coleman). When they graduate from Oxford, Nick comes to visit Toby in the Fedden's beautiful grand home in West London. Soon his gracious personality and wit and handsome appearance win over the entire family, especially daughter Catherine Fedden, a self-mutilator. Gerald the father (played to perfection by Tim McInnerny) and Rachael the mother (played by Alice Krige) run off the France leaving Nick to care for the house and for Catherine (nicknamed Cat). Dissonance immediately begins since the Feddens seem much to smart, sensitive, and informed to run off to France and leave a mentally ill daughter with a virtual stranger. Catherine and Nick soon however become best of friends since Catherine is fascinated with the fact that he is gay and she seeks non-sexual intimacy with him. She also specializes in penetrating hypocrisy, almost as if hypocrisy was unbearable to her. This is a trait that makes her a social and political liability for her parents. This is also the trait that drives the multiple tragedies of this story.What kind of fellow is Nick? He lives in fabulous surroundings in a home where the father is a conservative member of parliament yet, as his name implies, he is a guest in this rare world of privilege and he done not yet know its price or the price others pay. Nick is a student of Henry James and wishes to go to graduate school to study James. However in the meantime he begins to explore his sexuality and soon begins an affair with a handsome Jamaican man, Leo, played by Dan Gilet. This allows for more exploration of conservative hostility toward persons of color which is contrasted with Nick's erotic attraction to warm sweet Leo.  But as the story progresses, Nick goes through the maturing steps of a broken heart and then eventually becomes lovers with a multimillionaire Lebanese, Wani Ouradi, who supports Nick in a world of multiple partner sexual adventures, cocaine drug orgies, and the development of an indulgent arts magazine that appeals to the ultra-sophisticated rich. Wani is played by Alex Wyndham who maintains the erotic mysterious decadent stereotype of the gay exotic.All of this splendor begins to crumble with the rising political success of Gerald Fedden, which requires him to associate with wealthy bigots and prejudicial hate-monger ideologues that direct the policies of the conservative party. It is daughter Cat who pulls the world down around the other characters by exposing all the hypocrisy and hidden scandal that supports the privileged life that she and her family enjoy. However her desire to reveal all hypocrisy also bleeds into the life of Nick and his lover Wani, who is dying of AIDS. Wani does stretch toward honesty and authenticity as he begins to die, offering to leave Nick the building in which they manage their arts magazine.Having sex with men while implying to the world that you are straight may protect privilege but it makes a man vulnerable. Thus when we see Gerald fall from his political perch due to financial and sexual scandals, we also see Wani fall as he deteriorates physically from the effects of HIV. Nick looks at the first edition of their magazine Ogee and the impression is that the wealthy, privilege, glamour, and luxury is at best an illusion, and more likely a diversion from authenticity.Nick becomes the scapegoat for the scandals that plague the Fedden home, even though his gayness was surely one of the least scandals the Fedden's faced. Yet the viewer is left with the impression that the scapegoat role allows him to make an emotional break from the Feddens and maybe one day this young man's painful experiences will afford him authenticity. The film is oddly optimistic in the end since Nick may be in both pain and grief and must start his life over, but the viewer is never in doubt that the painful lessons will be integrated into this bright sensitive young man so that the final product is stronger and more self directed.Well made, beautifully acted, clearly formatted and edited, the film is very good and is highly recommended.",4,The price of priviledge,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,4511,"['three-part', 'three-hour', 'drama', 'based', 'Alan', 'Hollinghurst', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'much', 'going', 'Taking', 'place', '3', 'episodes', '1983', '1986', '1987', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'explored', 'sensitivity', 'insight', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'focus', 'review', 'just', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'price', 'privilege.Middle-class', 'Nick', 'Guest', 'played', 'well', 'handsome', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'attracted', 'best', 'friend', 'Toby', 'Fedden', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Coleman', 'When', 'graduate', 'Oxford', 'Nick', 'visit', 'Toby', 'Fedden', 'beautiful', 'grand', 'home', 'West', 'London', 'Soon', 'gracious', 'personality', 'wit', 'handsome', 'appearance', 'win', 'entire', 'family', 'especially', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Fedden', 'self-mutilator', 'Gerald', 'father', 'played', 'perfection', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'Rachael', 'mother', 'played', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'run', 'off', 'France', 'leaving', 'Nick', 'care', 'house', 'Catherine', 'nicknamed', 'Cat', 'Dissonance', 'immediately', 'Feddens', 'seem', 'much', 'smart', 'sensitive', 'informed', 'run', 'off', 'France', 'leave', 'mentally', 'ill', 'daughter', 'virtual', 'stranger', 'Catherine', 'Nick', 'soon', 'however', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Catherine', 'fascinated', 'fact', 'gay', 'non-sexual', 'intimacy', 'also', 'penetrating', 'hypocrisy', 'almost', 'hypocrisy', 'was', 'unbearable', 'trait', 'social', 'political', 'liability', 'parents', 'also', 'trait', 'multiple', 'tragedies', 'story.What', 'kind', 'fellow', 'Nick', 'fabulous', 'surroundings', 'home', 'where', 'father', 'conservative', 'member', 'parliament', 'yet', 'name', 'implies', 'guest', 'rare', 'world', 'privilege', 'done', 'not', 'yet', 'know', 'price', 'price', 'others', 'pay', 'Nick', 'student', 'Henry', 'James', 'wishes', 'go', 'graduate', 'school', 'study', 'James', 'However', 'meantime', 'explore', 'sexuality', 'soon', 'affair', 'handsome', 'Jamaican', 'man', 'Leo', 'played', 'Dan', 'Gilet', 'more', 'exploration', 'conservative', 'hostility', 'persons', 'color', 'contrasted', 'Nick', 'erotic', 'attraction', 'warm', 'sweet', 'Leo', 'story', 'Nick', 'maturing', 'steps', 'broken', 'heart', 'then', 'eventually', 'lovers', 'multimillionaire', 'Lebanese', 'Wani', 'Ouradi', 'who', 'Nick', 'world', 'multiple', 'partner', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'orgies', 'development', 'indulgent', 'arts', 'magazine', 'appeals', 'ultra-sophisticated', 'rich', 'Wani', 'played', 'Alex', 'Wyndham', 'who', 'erotic', 'mysterious', 'decadent', 'stereotype', 'gay', 'exotic.All', 'splendor', 'crumble', 'rising', 'political', 'success', 'Gerald', 'Fedden', 'associate', 'wealthy', 'bigots', 'prejudicial', 'hate-monger', 'ideologues', 'direct', 'policies', 'conservative', 'party', 'daughter', 'Cat', 'who', 'world', 'down', 'other', 'characters', 'exposing', 'hypocrisy', 'hidden', 'scandal', 'privileged', 'life', 'family', 'enjoy', 'However', 'desire', 'reveal', 'hypocrisy', 'also', 'life', 'Nick', 'lover', 'Wani', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'Wani', 'stretch', 'honesty', 'authenticity', 'die', 'offering', 'leave', 'Nick', 'building', 'manage', 'arts', 'magazine.Having', 'sex', 'men', 'implying', 'world', 'are', 'straight', 'may', 'protect', 'privilege', 'man', 'vulnerable', 'Thus', 'when', 'see', 'Gerald', 'fall', 'political', 'perch', 'due', 'financial', 'sexual', 'scandals', 'also', 'see', 'Wani', 'fall', 'physically', 'effects', 'HIV', 'Nick', 'first', 'edition', 'magazine', 'Ogee', 'impression', 'wealthy', 'privilege', 'glamour', 'luxury', 'best', 'illusion', 'more', 'likely', 'diversion', 'authenticity.Nick', 'scapegoat', 'scandals', 'plague', 'Fedden', 'home', 'even', 'gayness', 'was', 'surely', 'one', 'least', 'scandals', 'Fedden', 'faced', 'viewer', 'left', 'impression', 'scapegoat', 'role', 'make', 'emotional', 'break', 'Feddens', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'man', 'painful', 'experiences', 'will', 'afford', 'authenticity', 'film', 'oddly', 'optimistic', 'end', 'Nick', 'may', 'be', 'pain', 'grief', 'must', 'start', 'life', 'viewer', 'never', 'doubt', 'painful', 'lessons', 'will', 'be', 'integrated', 'bright', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'final', 'product', 'stronger', 'more', 'self', 'directed.Well', 'made', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'clearly', 'formatted', 'edited', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Line of Beauty

1004993,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GIXLX4,Grady Harp,"[17, 19]","Alan Hollinghurst's brilliant novel THE LINE OF BEAUTY has been well adapted for film by Andrew Davies and brought to BBC television by director Saul Dibb and an outstanding cast. That television miniseries is now available on one DVD with each of the three parts intact as seen in the UK (not the parceled version shown in the USA) and it is a satisfying transition from Hollinghurst's visual poetry to cinematic depiction.The story takes place from 1983 to 1987 in England - the Thatcher years - when class differences, hypocrisies, paparazzi, and homophobia were peaking.  Essentially the tour guide through this time is one Nicholas Guest (Dan Stephens), a 'middle class' son of an antiques dealer who has just finished Oxford (on scholarship) and visits the home of his wealthy roommate Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) whose father Gerald (Tim McInnerny) is climbing the steps of politics as his warmly understanding and supportive wife Rachel (Alice Krige) looks on and worries about their knotty daughter Cat (Hayley Atwill) who loathes politics and sees the hypocrisy spoken by all of her father's associates.  Nick is welcomed into the family with genuine warmth and he is smitten by the grandeur of their lifestyle and the beauty of their home: he becomes their surrogate son when Toby leaves for adventures with his shallow sweetheart, taking care of at times self-mutilating Cat.Nicholas is gay, finds love with a lower class handsome black man Leo (Don Gilet), and shares his proclivities with Cat, his confidant.  Insidiously Nick becomes a full part of the Fedden family, serving as a son would, entertaining at parties with them, and meeting the important people whom Gerald engages in his political pyramid.  Among them is a Lebanese family whose wealthy son Wani Ouradi (Alex Wyndham) catches Nick's eye and though Wani is 'engaged' to a girl he also is a severely closeted gay man and Nick and Wani become entwined in drugs and love.  When the spectre of AIDS begins to diminish the population of England some secrets are revealed, secrets of sexual liaisons that are intolerable for the Feddens and their associates yet lead to the hypocrisy of affairs within Gerald Fedden's protected world.  It is the surfacing of the true lives of the characters that proves to be the downfall of Nicholas and his relationship to the world of wealth as well as the crumbling of the fragile political, media-infested world of Gerald Fedden's creation.The cast is uniformly excellent and Dibb is able to coax the acrid aura of England of the 1980s with lucidity and a sensitive eye for revealing corruption and fractured human relationships.  If the viewer is left with the feeling that Nicholas does not really deserve our concern because of his hollow devotion to wealth as a means to happiness then the point of Hollinghurst's novel has been well served.  The film is not without flaws (a pianist at one of the soirees, we are told by supertitles, is paying Grieg's Piano Concerto....when that could not be further from reality!), and insufficient time is given to the Nick/Wani and Nick/Leo relationships to allow us into the inner sanctum of gay life in this tough time, etc., it still is an engrossing drama and one very well played by credible actors.

Nick Guest, who is aptly named, (Dan Stevens) moves, at the urging of his straight friend from Oxford, Toby, into the lush Nottingham home of Toby's family consisting of Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny), a Tory MP in Margaret Thatcher's government; his crazed daughter Catherine; and his wife. The action takes place in 1983, 1986 and 1987. Nick meets and falls for Leo (Dan Gilet) early in the first part. Leo has disappeared in the second hour, and Nick, a Henry James scholar, has pretty much given up James for the exotic Lebanese Wani Duradi who introduces him to coke (the line of beauty) and decadent sexual encounters. Both Fedden and Nick's worlds come crashing down (""The End of the Street"") in 1987.The film is about class and corruption. While Nick certainly has his flaws, he redeems himself, at least in part, by accepting the consequences of his actions. Catherine, a strange young woman, is the moral center of the film.One question I had about both the film and the book: while I am not a close student of the life of Margaret Thatcher, I cannot see her shaking it up and dancing with the coked-out Nick at a party.

The older men, however, are uniformly opinionated, right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan/Thatcher years. Young or old, however, morals in this three-part mini-series are suspect and no one comes off particularly well.Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. While not pivotal to the story, he has an extraordinary head of hair which at least makes watching this drivel easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician. He babysits their house, and daughter Cat, while the rest of the family frolics in the south of France. They neglect to inform him that Cat, when upset, cuts herself with an assortment of kitchen implements. Nick mistakes their self-serving gratitude for affection and moves in, finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years but, as the plot depends on this point, it's best not to question it.While Nick is pleasing to look at, he is unbearably obsequious. His coy subjugation to the rich bigots soon had this viewer climbing the walls. Deeply closeted except to Cat (she guessed his big secret on sight), he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick's sexual orientation, and connection to Gerald's family, is reported in a tabloid.

1004999,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B000GIXLX4,"pjf ""pjf""","[0, 0]","Dan Stevens is luminous in this lengthy three part and very faithful adaption of the book that won a Man Booker prize, playing Nick Guest, the gay middle class Oxford grad who goes in search of love and beauty along the Tory set in Thatcher's London.  Kudos must be given to Tim McInnerny who could not be better in the role of the pompous and somewhat false Tory MP Gerald Fedden.  And Alice Krige also gives a touching portrayal of Rachel Fedden.  Friend of son Toby, Nick comes to stay as a vacation house minder in the Fedden's magnificent Kensington Park Gardens mansion. In addition to minding the house, Nick is also to keep an eye on volatile daughter Catherine (the Cat) a cutter who walks a manic-depressive line.Having done well over the vacation, Nick is invited to lodge there while pursuing his doctoral degree at UCL, to serve as a buffer between Cat and her parents, and as a filial substitute and general dogsbody and syncophant to the egotistical Fedden.  In this, he's a little false. While he's in love with their lifestyle, he's also critical of it, seeming to secretly sympathise and long to be Tory when with Gerald and his friends, and with Labor when with more middle class associates. He's a lodger, who pays a little rent and lives in a tiny attic room, but is included in the parties and lifestyle of the rich Feddens.In the film, Stevens does a far better job of making the viewer like his character than the book does, giving him a naive, gushing, longing portrayal, making the most of his blue eyes and tousled locks.  It's just as well he does and that the film can't replicate the internal dialogue in the book, where Guest will give a spoken compliment and mentally take it back. It makes the viewer sympathize and like his character far better than it deserves. making him a little less of a leech, and makes the ending a bit more shocking.While living with the family,ostensibly pursuing his degree, Guest's primary mission is to find love, or failing that, sex.  He goes about this in a clueless and not terribly competent way. With all Guest's physical charms and Oxford accomplishments, he can't seem to develop an honest relationship.  The same issues that drive him to lodge with the Tory Feddens cause him to latch onto millionaire Wani Ouradi, a beautiful closeted and gay fellow Oxford grad, who takes Nick on as am employee and sometime lover. But Wani is more interested in coke, porn and sex than his business, and regards Nick more as just another bought and paid for syncophant than lover, employee or equal. And the specter of Aids begins to haunt the gay community.Catherine flies from depression to mania, and when manic, babbles secrets that were best kept hidden. Nick the outsider is an easy scapegoat for the troubles she creates,partly because he was her ""minder"" partly because he's suspected of telling one of Gerald's secrets that she discerned on her own. And Nick's tentative house of cards, that depended not upon real regard, but upon at least partly false relationships between all these people, begins to fall.One difference between the book and the film -- the film also makes Nick's ultimate fate more optimistic, if still open-ended. It also offers a final scene with Catherine that wasn't in the book, but should have been.This film has wonderful performances, beautiful settings and an allegedly faithful representation of Tory London and the fallout of AIDS on the gay community in the 80s. The problem (and it is the same in the book, if less so), is that Nick Guest isn't, and was never meant to be an entirely likable character, and his fate is left very open ended.  But while the characters aren't entirely likable, they are well drawn enough to be unforgettable, and it is a mini-series worth seeing.",5,"faithful adaption, lovely to watch",1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,3778,"['Dan', 'Stevens', 'luminous', 'lengthy', 'three', 'part', 'very', 'faithful', 'adaption', 'book', 'won', 'Man', 'Booker', 'prize', 'playing', 'Nick', 'Guest', 'gay', 'middle', 'class', 'Oxford', 'grad', 'who', 'search', 'love', 'beauty', 'Tory', 'set', 'Thatcher', 'London', 'Kudos', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'role', 'pompous', 'somewhat', 'false', 'Tory', 'MP', 'Gerald', 'Fedden', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'also', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'Rachel', 'Fedden', 'Friend', 'son', 'Toby', 'Nick', 'stay', 'vacation', 'house', 'minder', 'Fedden', 'magnificent', 'Kensington', 'Park', 'Gardens', 'mansion', 'addition', 'minding', 'house', 'Nick', 'also', 'keep', 'eye', 'volatile', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Cat', 'cutter', 'who', 'manic-depressive', 'line.Having', 'done', 'well', 'vacation', 'Nick', 'invited', 'lodge', 'there', 'pursuing', 'doctoral', 'degree', 'UCL', 'serve', 'buffer', 'Cat', 'parents', 'filial', 'substitute', 'general', 'dogsbody', 'syncophant', 'egotistical', 'Fedden', 'little', 'false', 'love', 'lifestyle', 'also', 'critical', 'seeming', 'secretly', 'sympathise', 'long', 'be', 'Tory', 'when', 'Gerald', 'friends', 'Labor', 'when', 'more', 'middle', 'class', 'associates', 'lodger', 'who', 'little', 'rent', 'tiny', 'attic', 'room', 'included', 'parties', 'lifestyle', 'rich', 'Feddens.In', 'film', 'Stevens', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'making', 'viewer', 'character', 'book', 'giving', 'naive', 'gushing', 'longing', 'portrayal', 'making', 'most', 'blue', 'eyes', 'tousled', 'locks', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'replicate', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'book', 'where', 'Guest', 'will', 'give', 'spoken', 'compliment', 'mentally', 'take', 'back', 'viewer', 'sympathize', 'character', 'far', 'better', 'making', 'little', 'less', 'leech', 'ending', 'bit', 'more', 'shocking.While', 'living', 'family', 'ostensibly', 'pursuing', 'degree', 'Guest', 'primary', 'mission', 'find', 'love', 'failing', 'sex', 'clueless', 'not', 'terribly', 'competent', 'way', 'Guest', 'physical', 'charms', 'Oxford', 'accomplishments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'develop', 'honest', 'relationship', 'same', 'issues', 'drive', 'lodge', 'Tory', 'Feddens', 'cause', 'latch', 'millionaire', 'Wani', 'Ouradi', 'beautiful', 'closeted', 'gay', 'fellow', 'Oxford', 'grad', 'who', 'Nick', 'am', 'employee', 'sometime', 'lover', 'Wani', 'more', 'interested', 'coke', 'porn', 'sex', 'business', 'regards', 'Nick', 'more', 'as', 'just', 'bought', 'paid', 'syncophant', 'lover', 'employee', 'equal', 'specter', 'Aids', 'haunt', 'gay', 'community.Catherine', 'flies', 'depression', 'mania', 'when', 'manic', 'secrets', 'were', 'best', 'kept', 'hidden', 'outsider', 'easy', 'scapegoat', 'troubles', 'partly', 'was', 'minder', 'partly', 'suspected', 'telling', 'one', 'Gerald', 'secrets', 'discerned', 'own', 'Nick', 'tentative', 'house', 'cards', 'depended', 'not', 'upon', 'real', 'regard', 'upon', 'least', 'partly', 'false', 'relationships', 'people', 'fall.One', 'difference', 'book', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'Nick', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'more', 'optimistic', 'still', 'open-ended', 'also', 'final', 'scene', 'Catherine', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'should', 'have', 'been.This', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'allegedly', 'faithful', 'representation', 'Tory', 'London', 'fallout', 'AIDS', 'gay', 'community', '80s', 'problem', 'same', 'book', 'less', 'so', 'Nick', 'Guest', ""n't"", 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'entirely', 'likable', 'character', 'fate', 'left', 'very', 'open', 'ended', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'likable', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'enough', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'mini-series', 'worth', 'seeing']",The Line of Beauty
