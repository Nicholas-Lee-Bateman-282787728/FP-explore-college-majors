1139421,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B0012RWQJ8,DarthJustice,"[0, 0]","The Mannequin franchise is one of those franchises where I actually saw the sequel first. It was a few years later that I saw the original after purchasing it on VHS. Years later, I finally got around to purchasing the two movies on the DVD double feature pack.--MANNEQUIN--Mannequin, released in 1987, stars Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall as Jonathon and Emmy. Jonathon is a would-be artist who finds himself getting fired from dead-end job after job. Originally, he is working building mannequins and, after spending too much time on each one, especially his most recent one he seems to have taken quite a liking to, is fired. His luck finally changes when he inadvertently saves the life of the owner of a local large department store. The same one he just happens to spot this last mannequin in, the one he liked so much.After getting an entry-level job by one of the movie's antagonists, the store manager, Jonathon meets Hollywood who, when you really think about it, is probably almost every gay stereotype in the book. But it never comes across as insulting and Hollywood is easily one of the best and funniest characters in the two movies.Emmy grew up in BC Egypt (as probably one of the whitest Egyptians I've ever seen) but wanted to be more out off life. It just so happens the Egyptian gods grants her wish and she ultimately she ends up becoming (possessing?) Jonathon's mannequin in the present day. It works out that only when Jonathon is around can Emmy become a normal person. Otherwise she's trapped as a mannequin.Throwing in the mix is the manager/owner of the main rival department store who wants to ""steal"" Jonathon due to his mannequin and art abilities sending the store's profits through the roof.-----MANNEQUIN ON THE MOVE-------Mannequin 2, released in 1991 has little connection to the first movie, other than featuring the same department store and Hollywood and a brief and passing reference. This time, the main character is Jason, played by William Ragsdale, who has just gotten a job at the store.This time, the ""mannequin"" is Jessie, played Kristy Swanson, a young peasant girl from 1,000 years ago. 1,000 years prior, she and a prince were in love and were planning on marrying, something his mother disapproved of. So much she had a sorcerer place her under a curse that turned her into a mannequin. Officially, she gets turned to stone, but the ""stone"" is a very mannequin-like piece of stone, I'd say. The curse goes that she can only be freed by her true love in a foreign land after a 1,000 years have passed.Present day, Jason gets a job working directly under Hollywood, from the first movie. It so happens the store is getting ready for a presentation of the ""Peasant Girl"", essentially Jessie and the curse has become a legend. The descendant of the sorcerer and three bodyguards are taking the ""statue"" on tour and the store is the first location. As fate would have it, Jason turns out to be her true love and once the necklace is removed, Jessie becomes human again. In the process, Jason must stop the sorcerer from stealing her away.----Plot summaries out of the way, personally as much as I enjoyed both movies, I thought the first movie was better. It just seemed less....silly than On the Move. The acting in both movies were fun if not over the top in certain cases. I thought On The Move was a tad bit sillier in nature with the sorcerer's grandson and the three dimwitted bodyguards.I will give On the Move one thing though. I did think that William Ragsdale and Kristy Swanson had better chemistry as a couple than Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall did, though they weren't bad at all.If you're looking for simple movies to just have fun watching, these two movies would be a good choice to pick up.
