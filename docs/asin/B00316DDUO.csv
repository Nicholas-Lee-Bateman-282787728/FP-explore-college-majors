I immediately started buying eveything he is in. High life is sort of a tragic comedy where an intelligent man (Olyphant) tries to catch a break by stealing some money, and of course, it all goes wrong because of the missteps of his criminal friends. High Life is worth watching, if for no other reason than to see Olyphant. He is such a good actor; I am glad he is finally coming into his own with Justified. There were some pretty funny moments here, where I guess one is laughing to keep from crying. It did make one hope against hope that Olyphant's character, Dick, would finally be able to straighten his life up, but one also knows that this is unlikely, as it's Dick's prison buddy who is picking Dick up being released from prison. Anyway, anything with Timothy Olyphant in it is well worth watching.",4,Timothy Olyphant; Always worth watching!,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,919,"['bought', 'movie', 'have', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Timothy', 'olyphant', 'Justified', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'immediately', 'started', 'buying', 'eveything', 'High', 'life', 'sort', 'tragic', 'comedy', 'where', 'intelligent', 'man', 'Olyphant', 'catch', 'break', 'stealing', 'money', 'course', 'wrong', 'missteps', 'criminal', 'friends', 'High', 'Life', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'Olyphant', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'coming', 'own', 'Justified', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'where', 'guess', 'one', 'laughing', 'keep', 'crying', 'did', 'make', 'one', 'hope', 'hope', 'Olyphant', 'character', 'Dick', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'straighten', 'life', 'up', 'one', 'also', 'unlikely', 'Dick', 'prison', 'buddy', 'who', 'picking', 'Dick', 'up', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'Anyway', 'anything', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

It definitely reminds me the Coen Brothers, with it's fusion of comedy and thriller.I've been a fan of Timothy Olyphant since 1999, when he was cast as drug dealer Todd Gaines in Go, so I was drawn to this film where he plays the lead.  He does a convincing job as Dick, a morphine addict that can't seem to catch a break.  I was also impressed with Stephen McIntyre's performance as Bug, a high-strung addict with all of the restraint of a rattlesnake.  One of the more enjoyable aspects of the film is watching junkie logic in action, as his fellow addicts and heist conspirators view everything from a warped perspective.Canadian director Gary Yates, whose career had mostly involved shooting for television, does a surprisingly good job.  A perfect example is the self-help group for addicts, where the lighting and camera work makes for a great monologue by suave junkie Billy.  The film has a great score which also sets the mood of the movie, with tracks by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Three Dog Night and April Wine.It's not a straight comedy, so the laughs are infrequent, but the use of humor is always on the money.  The buildup to the heist is definitely more interesting than what occurs in the latter half of the film, and the conclusion is a little unsatisfying.  It's not a terrific movie as far as crime or drug flicks go, but it's definitely off of the beaten path, and worth a watch.",3,Decent Comedic Heist Movie,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,1508,"['High', 'Life', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'better', 'straight-to-video', 'film', 'far', 'hit', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'fusion', 'comedy', 'thriller.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', '1999', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Todd', 'Gaines', 'Go', 'so', 'was', 'drawn', 'film', 'where', 'lead', 'convincing', 'job', 'Dick', 'morphine', 'addict', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Stephen', 'McIntyre', 'performance', 'Bug', 'high-strung', 'addict', 'restraint', 'rattlesnake', 'One', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'aspects', 'film', 'watching', 'junkie', 'logic', 'action', 'fellow', 'addicts', 'heist', 'conspirators', 'view', 'everything', 'warped', 'perspective.Canadian', 'director', 'Gary', 'Yates', 'career', 'had', 'mostly', 'involved', 'shooting', 'television', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'job', 'perfect', 'example', 'self-help', 'group', 'addicts', 'where', 'lighting', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'monologue', 'suave', 'junkie', 'Billy', 'film', 'great', 'score', 'also', 'mood', 'movie', 'tracks', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'Three', 'Dog', 'Night', 'April', 'Wine.It', 'not', 'straight', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'infrequent', 'use', 'humor', 'always', 'money', 'buildup', 'heist', 'definitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'what', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'conclusion', 'little', 'unsatisfying', 'not', 'terrific', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'crime', 'drug', 'flicks', 'go', 'definitely', 'beaten', 'path', 'watch']",N/A

This movie is one of the very best bank robbery movies I've seen in a very long time. This is not a comedy, but there is humor. It started off as a non-violent caper, but it got violent. Imagine if Tarantino and the Coen brothers teamed up to do a movie! Well, This movie could have been the end result. You never know what is going to happen next, until it happens. You are never going to predict the ending to this flick, unless you already know it. From the beginning, I was sucked into this movie. There are only one or two slow spots, and they are not long. ( do not attempt to get beer or popcorn from the kitchen during these slow spots), you will end up reversing to see what you missed. I did!

Those of a certain age (i.e., all you dang kids) won't get it, so be it, I don't care.If you like Timothy Oliphant, you should enjoy seeing him playing a 'non-characteristic' character ... instead of being a straight-laced (Deadwood) or wise-cracking (Justified) good ol' boy lawman, he's a shiftless loser, a stoner/druggie/delinquent ... they don't clearly specify his character's age, but Timothy was actually around 40 when he did this flick, although he looks a LOT younger to me.The story was a bit twisty with a few surreal drug induced hallucinations and/or imagination scenes that took me a few moments to catch on to ... but in general it's the story of a loser druggie ex-con named Dick (Timothy) who being fresh out of jail is observing the technological advances that have occured while he was put away and contemplating how to take advantage of the weaknesses of new tech in order to make a grand score to set himself up for good. He gathers a crew of old friends and new, makes a plan, and then everything goes to hell.And all throughout we hear some of the rockin-est tunes from April Wine while the s**** goes down, so it's all good :-DThis isn't necessarily a great movie, but I thought it was a fun movie, with fairly good acting from all involved, no major flaws in plot or execution.
