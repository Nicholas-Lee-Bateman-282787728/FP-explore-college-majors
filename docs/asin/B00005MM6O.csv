666407,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005MM6O,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","""Mask of Death"" is a well-made thriller from Lorenzo Lamas' career as a staple player of the golden days of direct-to-video action fare. It's basically a remake of Chuck Norris'The Hitman, and I'm surprised to say that the Lamas flick is the superior effort of this sort of storyline. With that said, it's not a fantastic action film, and that's what brings down my rating: if I could value low-budget storytelling over fistfights, this one would have a four-star rating, but as it stands, ""Mask of Death"" is missing the one crucial element to my idea of a good mid-90s action flick.The story: after his wife is killed in a criminal deal gone wrong, Officer McKenna (Lamas,Renegade) is declared dead but instead undergoes plastic surgery to disguise himself as a hitman killed in action. Going undercover, McKenna infiltrates the dangerous underworld to bring a cruel mobster (Conrad Dunn,Nero Wolfe) to justice.The script is written by a virtual nobody (R.C. Rossenfier,Starforce) and by high standards probably isn't all that special, but I like how it goes more into the mindset of Lamas and the ethical problems he faces in this situation than the aforementioned Norris picture. Lorenzo Lamas isn't a fantastic actor but he makes the most of this role while staying within the macho archetype. There are some surprisingly well-staged parts here, like the interrogation scene in the middle of the film. Additionally, I appreciate the casting of part-time action lady Rae Dawn Chong (Commando) as McKenna's ex-partner: it's not a fantastic role, but it allows her to play a tougher character than she usually gets to, one who gets into fistfights and car chases and crashes.As that last line indicates, the film is far from action-free but, it's too little and too impersonal for my tastes. There's a speedboat chase, two car chases, one shootout that Lamas is barely a part of, one bad hand-to-hand fight, and an instance wherein Rae Chong fends off an assassin with a towel, a jar of paint, and a wrench. Most of this passes as fairly big-budget stuff and would be at home in many a Hollywood feature, but it's just not what I'm after. There is plenty of opportunity for more karate and stylish gunfighting, but apparently the film was geared towards generic action to tide over the ultimately good story. It's disappointing and keeps the film from attain a four-star rating, but I don't think everyone will be bothered by it as much as me.Basically, Lamas fans - especially those of his TV show - can feel free to check this one out, and potential fans who want to acquaint themselves with Lorenzo via a slightly sophisticated vehicle might as well seek it out too, but everyone else ought to settle for happening upon it on TV someday.",3,"""No ammo, no booze, no broads - gentlemen, this man needs our help""",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,2741,"['Mask', 'Death', 'well-made', 'thriller', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'career', 'staple', 'player', 'golden', 'days', 'direct-to-video', 'action', 'fare', 'basically', 'remake', 'Chuck', ""Norris'The"", 'Hitman', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'say', 'Lamas', 'flick', 'superior', 'effort', 'sort', 'storyline', 'said', 'not', 'fantastic', 'action', 'film', 'what', 'down', 'rating', 'could', 'value', 'low-budget', 'storytelling', 'fistfights', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'four-star', 'rating', 'Mask', 'Death', 'missing', 'one', 'crucial', 'element', 'idea', 'good', 'mid-90s', 'action', 'flick.The', 'story', 'wife', 'killed', 'criminal', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Officer', 'McKenna', 'Lamas', 'Renegade', 'declared', 'dead', 'instead', 'undergoes', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'disguise', 'hitman', 'killed', 'action', 'Going', 'undercover', 'McKenna', 'dangerous', 'underworld', 'bring', 'cruel', 'mobster', 'Conrad', 'Dunn', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'justice.The', 'script', 'written', 'virtual', 'nobody', 'R.C', 'Rossenfier', 'Starforce', 'high', 'standards', 'probably', ""n't"", 'special', 'like', 'how', 'more', 'mindset', 'Lamas', 'ethical', 'problems', 'situation', 'aforementioned', 'Norris', 'picture', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'actor', 'most', 'role', 'staying', 'macho', 'archetype', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well-staged', 'parts', 'here', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'Additionally', 'appreciate', 'casting', 'part-time', 'action', 'lady', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'Commando', 'McKenna', 'ex-partner', 'not', 'fantastic', 'role', 'play', 'tougher', 'character', 'usually', 'one', 'who', 'fistfights', 'car', 'chases', 'crashes.As', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'far', 'action-free', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'impersonal', 'tastes', 'speedboat', 'chase', 'two', 'car', 'chases', 'one', 'shootout', 'Lamas', 'barely', 'part', 'one', 'bad', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'instance', 'wherein', 'Rae', 'Chong', 'assassin', 'towel', 'jar', 'paint', 'wrench', 'Most', 'fairly', 'big-budget', 'stuff', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'just', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'more', 'karate', 'stylish', 'gunfighting', 'apparently', 'film', 'was', 'geared', 'towards', 'generic', 'action', 'tide', 'ultimately', 'good', 'story', 'disappointing', 'film', 'attain', 'four-star', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'bothered', 'as', 'much', 'me.Basically', 'Lamas', 'especially', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'feel', 'free', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'potential', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'acquaint', 'Lorenzo', 'slightly', 'sophisticated', 'vehicle', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'seek', 'out', 'too', 'everyone', 'else', 'ought', 'settle', 'happening', 'TV', 'someday']",N/A
666408,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00005MM6O,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","Who would have thought that there might be an addition on B Mount Rushmore? Swayze McQueen Segal...Lamas? It might be coming true after the ponytailed adonis played a dual role in Mask of Death. Sometimes picking out a B is the toughest part of doing a review but this one was a no-brainer. You know you're living right when you sign on to netflix and a movie like this is recomended for you. When we read the description we were hooked. A Face-Off ripoff starring Lamas and Billy D. Williams? 5 thousand dollar occupancy fee? Yes we have that actually. Click and 30 seconds later we knew the right decision was made as the opening credits were very similar to those ofDeath Ring [VHS]. Then it was Lamas time.This movie was nonstop action for the first 45 minutes. It starts with Lamas playing Lyle Mason who is a maniac tough guy mercenary that normally works for the Russian mob. On this day he is doing a deal on a boat with Frank Dailio for some sort of microchip that was never really explained. Aparently Frank was working with the FBI because as soon as the deal goes down bam Billy D Williams is shooting at them from a helicopter. There was then a 25 minute helicopter/boat chase scene during which the same shot was shown at least 5 times. Eventually Mason eludes the FBI and happens upon a campsite by the lake. The campers are 2 cop partners and their families. Mason and Dailio end up killing the chick cop's husband and the dude cop's wife. So they have to get away and Mason carjacks a guy by punching him in the face while he's backing out of his driveway. That's a new one. Then the male cop, McKenna, jumps on the windshield of Mason's new ride and Mason shoots him POW right in the kisser. Now Lamas was playing both roles so he shot himself in the face. But when Lamas was playing the cop he looked just like Boston George. Not cool It ain't me babe it ain't me Boston Groege; creepy molester Can I walk you to school in my flourescent warmup suit stringy hair Boston George. After shooting McKenna, Mason is in a monster car accident and dies so naturally Billy D talks McKenna into getting plastic surgery and impersonating Mason to put Dailio away for good. When any B movie tough guy needs info where's the first place they go? The tattoo shop right? So of course Mason goes to the tattoo shop to rough up some guy for Dailio's whereabouts. Obviously McKenna ends up finding him and blowing him up at the end with booby trapped money he was using to buy the microchip. The microchip was kept by Dailio inside of one of those things that Santa had that said vulgar stuff when you pressed the button. And also Dailio's #2 looked just like the Rubenator minus the dyed Beavis hair. It was every bit as great as it sounds.For the first hour, this movie was as good as just about any B out there. A small step below Death Ring. Yeah it was that awesome. It had The Look. You know. There was dubbed audio from Lamas crappy picture quality cheap production, confusing plot points and a star who was just living the B dream. We had to take a star away however because things went downhill fast after the hour mark and because there was a morning scene and yes we still don't like that even now. This movie puts Lamas into a new stratosphere on the B charts, Sid is heavy into the Lamas market so be on the look out for more from The Renegade soon. And go watch Mask of Death. Seriously do it now and thank us later.",4,Lorenzo Lamas: This guy's got it,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,3432,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'addition', 'B', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'Swayze', 'McQueen', 'Segal', 'Lamas', 'might', 'be', 'coming', 'true', 'ponytailed', 'adonis', 'played', 'dual', 'role', 'Mask', 'Death', 'Sometimes', 'picking', 'out', 'B', 'toughest', 'part', 'doing', 'review', 'one', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'know', ""'re"", 'living', 'right', 'when', 'sign', 'netflix', 'movie', 'recomended', 'When', 'read', 'description', 'were', 'hooked', 'Face-Off', 'ripoff', 'starring', 'Lamas', 'Billy', 'D.', 'Williams', '5', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'occupancy', 'fee', 'Yes', 'have', 'actually', 'Click', '30', 'seconds', 'later', 'knew', 'right', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'very', 'similar', 'Ring', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'Then', 'was', 'Lamas', 'time.This', 'movie', 'was', 'nonstop', 'action', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'Lamas', 'playing', 'Lyle', 'Mason', 'who', 'maniac', 'tough', 'guy', 'mercenary', 'normally', 'Russian', 'mob', 'day', 'doing', 'deal', 'boat', 'Frank', 'Dailio', 'sort', 'microchip', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Aparently', 'Frank', 'was', 'working', 'FBI', 'as', 'soon', 'deal', 'down', 'bam', 'Billy', 'D', 'Williams', 'shooting', 'helicopter', 'was', 'then', '25', 'minute', 'helicopter/boat', 'chase', 'scene', 'same', 'shot', 'was', 'shown', 'least', '5', 'times', 'Eventually', 'Mason', 'FBI', 'campsite', 'lake', 'campers', 'are', '2', 'cop', 'partners', 'families', 'Mason', 'Dailio', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'chick', 'cop', 'husband', 'dude', 'cop', 'wife', 'have', 'get', 'away', 'Mason', 'guy', 'punching', 'face', 'backing', 'driveway', 'new', 'one', 'Then', 'male', 'cop', 'McKenna', 'windshield', 'Mason', 'new', 'ride', 'Mason', 'shoots', 'POW', 'right', 'kisser', 'Now', 'Lamas', 'was', 'playing', 'roles', 'so', 'shot', 'face', 'when', 'Lamas', 'was', 'playing', 'cop', 'looked', 'just', 'Boston', 'George', 'Not', 'cool', 'ai', ""n't"", 'babe', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Boston', 'Groege', 'creepy', 'molester', 'Can', 'walk', 'school', 'flourescent', 'warmup', 'suit', 'hair', 'Boston', 'George', 'shooting', 'McKenna', 'Mason', 'monster', 'car', 'accident', 'dies', 'so', 'naturally', 'Billy', 'D', 'talks', 'McKenna', 'getting', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'impersonating', 'Mason', 'put', 'Dailio', 'away', 'good', 'When', 'B', 'movie', 'tough', 'guy', 'needs', 'info', 'where', 'first', 'place', 'go', 'tattoo', 'shop', 'right', 'So', 'course', 'Mason', 'tattoo', 'shop', 'rough', 'up', 'guy', 'Dailio', 'whereabouts', 'Obviously', 'McKenna', 'up', 'finding', 'blowing', 'up', 'end', 'booby', 'trapped', 'money', 'was', 'using', 'buy', 'microchip', 'microchip', 'was', 'kept', 'Dailio', 'one', 'things', 'Santa', 'had', 'said', 'vulgar', 'stuff', 'when', 'pressed', 'button', 'also', 'Dailio', '2', 'looked', 'just', 'Rubenator', 'minus', 'dyed', 'Beavis', 'hair', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'just', 'B', 'there', 'small', 'step', 'Death', 'Ring', 'Yeah', 'was', 'awesome', 'had', 'Look', 'know', 'was', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'Lamas', 'crappy', 'picture', 'quality', 'cheap', 'production', 'confusing', 'plot', 'points', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'living', 'B', 'dream', 'had', 'take', 'star', 'away', 'however', 'things', 'went', 'fast', 'hour', 'mark', 'was', 'morning', 'scene', 'yes', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'even', 'now', 'movie', 'Lamas', 'new', 'stratosphere', 'B', 'charts', 'Sid', 'heavy', 'Lamas', 'market', 'so', 'be', 'look', 'out', 'more', 'Renegade', 'soon', 'go', 'watch', 'Mask', 'Death', 'Seriously', 'do', 'now', 'thank', 'later']",N/A
