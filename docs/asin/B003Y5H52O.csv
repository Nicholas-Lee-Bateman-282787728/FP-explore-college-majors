1372099,AAZRWLML88IZK,B003Y5H52O,A kids review,"[2, 8]","Monte Carlo is very obviously targeted for a specific demographic. It's a travel movie about three young girls who plan a dream trip to Paris, only to be whisked away in glitz and glamour to Monte Carlo when one of them is mistaken for a wealthy heiress, and it stars Selena Gomez, Leighton Meester, and Katie Cassidy. It should, therefore, surprise no one that the film was predictably sweet and charming in parts, and completely riddled with formulaic clich&eacute;s in most others. What we have here is a piece of fantasy fiction for young girls who dream of being princesses - or, at the very least, treated like princesses - so you can take that for what it's worth and decide if it's right for you. What I can tell you is that I wasn't so impressed by it, but let's be honest for a minute here: are the girls who will watch this really going to care what I have to say about it?",1,Monte Carlo,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,884,"['Monte', 'Carlo', 'very', 'obviously', 'targeted', 'specific', 'demographic', 'travel', 'movie', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'plan', 'dream', 'trip', 'Paris', 'only', 'be', 'whisked', 'away', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'when', 'one', 'mistaken', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'should', 'therefore', 'surprise', 'one', 'film', 'was', 'predictably', 'sweet', 'charming', 'parts', 'completely', 'riddled', 'formulaic', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'most', 'others', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'piece', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'dream', 'being', 'princesses', 'very', 'least', 'treated', 'princesses', 'can', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'decide', 'right', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'impressed', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'minute', 'here', 'are', 'girls', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'really', 'going', 'care', 'what', 'have', 'say']",N/A

It didn't take her long before she went straight to her room to watch the movie. Of course, I didn't get to watch the movie the first time around, so I watched it the 2nd time in the living room with my little girl. This movie is great for young girls and tween's. To be honest even at my age I found it be a really cute movie. The movie has tons of great music that makes you want to dance and sing along with it. My little girl couldn't help but get up and dance when the music started playing.This movie also teaches young girls self confidence with is really important for our girls that are growing up nowadays. Since, my little girl was already a fan of Selena Gomez, I knew she would love the movie, and she did. This movie will give you and young girls tons of laughs, and a great movie to watch together.

As Grace (Selena Gomez), Emma (Katie Cassidy) and Meg (Leighton Meester), race around in Paris then head off to Monte Carlo on a whim, I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. As a graduation present from her parents, Grace receives a trip to London, but that's not all. Grace's parents are also generously sending her best friend Emma and her step-sister Meg along on the trip. The excitement soon dies down once they get to Paris and later end up with sore feet in a seedy hotel room. They decide to book with a tour group and that is when all the fun begins. At first Emma races around ridiculously in her high heeled shoes on the tour as Grace tries to keep the peace between her friend and step-sister. After being left behind by the fast-paced tour group, the girls enter an expensive hotel. It is at this hotel that Grace's looks match exactly to the likes of a high class wealthy lady staying at the same hotel. Soon Grace is being waited on hand and foot and all the action begins. Anyone that has been on a vacation for the first time or to a new destination for the first time can relate to this film. I could relate with this film as I had a similar experience traveling with new friends for the first time to a new destination. Just as in this film you have different personalities thrown together and crazy experiences going on and then there are the boys. Finding love in another country is just plain exciting and so romantic. Monte Carlo has this and so much more. I give this movie 5 stars and recommend it to all you girls out there looking for a movie that includes fun, finding true friendship and romance all wrapped up in a pretty package. This movie, however, is not just a chick-flick. My husband watched the movie with me and he too laughed with me from the start.",5,A delightful treat!

1372104,A2F7CCPK4QL359,B003Y5H52O,"Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD""","[1, 1]","Monte Carlo is a teen version of the Prince and the Pauper with girl friends. Be forwarned--This is a Disney-like formula for the teen crowd. A few years ago, it would have Hillary Duff, Miley Cyrus or Lindsay Lohan playing the female lead instead of Disney star from Wizards of Waverly Place's Selina GomezThis film had been done before in a wayt in the Disney Lizzie McGuire movie. Funny,  Who says? (the Lizzie McGuire movie theme song) is sung by  Gomez on the end credits.Before you get to the end credits, you get a lovely  plot of sibbling rivally between two step sisters (Gomez and Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester) who dont respect each other and their parents send them to Paris together. Gomez's waitress friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) joins their trip. It seems almost like a modern day, Europian ""Where the Boys are""!The threesome miss their tour bus in Paris. Gomez also plays a look-a-like monster socialite who is a brat. Gomez is mistaken for the heiress.  The threesome take her hotel since the socialite goes on a unplanned spree. The threesome then ventures to Monte Carlo in the socialite's place and plot gets predictable..but it is fun in a Disney-ish, Frank Capra like wayThere are big names in small roles in this film. Glee's Cory Montieth is Emma's boyfriend who searches Paris for the trio. His four scences of the film  is short at best, but longer than a cameo. Dr Who's Catherine Tate steals the end of the film in her cameo. However Jane by Design's Andie MacDowell and Make It or Break it's Brett Cullen appearances are wasted as Gomez's and Meetser's parents in this movie.The direction is similar to a modern day Disney Teen adventure...something you may get on ABC family channel.  It works and it succeeds on many levels. Its formula, but adults who want to watch something with their teens, other than Pretty Little Liars, will have a GREAT TIME watching this because the films does not talk down to the audience..i do mean it. It is formula that we have all seen before but it is intelligently presented.Its fun in a four star way!Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",4,Cute and done before,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2092,"['Monte', 'Carlo', 'teen', 'version', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'girl', 'friends', 'Be', 'forwarned', 'Disney-like', 'formula', 'teen', 'crowd', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'playing', 'female', 'lead', 'instead', 'Disney', 'star', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'Selina', 'GomezThis', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'wayt', 'Disney', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'movie', 'Funny', 'Who', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'movie', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Gomez', 'end', 'credits.Before', 'get', 'end', 'credits', 'get', 'lovely', 'plot', 'sibbling', 'rivally', 'two', 'step', 'sisters', 'Gomez', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'who', 'dont', 'respect', 'other', 'parents', 'send', 'Paris', 'together', 'Gomez', 'waitress', 'friend', 'Emma', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'trip', 'almost', 'modern', 'day', 'Europian', 'Where', 'Boys', 'are', 'threesome', 'miss', 'tour', 'bus', 'Paris', 'Gomez', 'also', 'look-a-like', 'monster', 'socialite', 'who', 'brat', 'Gomez', 'mistaken', 'heiress', 'threesome', 'take', 'hotel', 'socialite', 'unplanned', 'spree', 'threesome', 'then', 'ventures', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'socialite', 'place', 'plot', 'predictable..but', 'fun', 'Disney-ish', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'are', 'big', 'names', 'small', 'roles', 'film', 'Glee', 'Cory', 'Montieth', 'Emma', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'Paris', 'trio', 'four', 'scences', 'film', 'short', 'best', 'longer', 'cameo', 'Dr', 'Who', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'end', 'film', 'cameo', 'However', 'Jane', 'Design', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Make', 'Break', 'Brett', 'Cullen', 'appearances', 'are', 'wasted', 'Gomez', 'Meetser', 'parents', 'movie.The', 'direction', 'similar', 'modern', 'day', 'Disney', 'Teen', 'adventure', 'something', 'may', 'get', 'ABC', 'family', 'channel', 'many', 'levels', 'formula', 'adults', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'teens', 'other', 'Pretty', 'Little', 'Liars', 'will', 'have', 'GREAT', 'TIME', 'watching', 'films', 'not', 'talk', 'audience..i', 'do', 'mean', 'formula', 'have', 'seen', 'intelligently', 'presented.Its', 'fun', 'four', 'star', 'way', 'Bennet', 'PomerantzAUDIOWORLD']",N/A

It always seemed like Connie Francis, Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, Troy Donahue or Sandra Dee were heading to Florida or California to have fun in the sun. Inevitably someone fell in love, someone was hurt and life long romances followed. These were light and fluffy films that offered fun with a touch of drama and an occasional great theme song (""Where the Boys Are""?). MONTE CARLO is like one of those movies made for the current generation.Selena Gomez stars as Grace, a waitress who can't wait to get out of her one note town and discover the world. Living with her mother and step father is fine but she can't seem to get along with her step sister Meg (Leighton Meester) at all. In an effort to iron things out, their parents allow Grace to go on a vacation to France is Meg goes along. Neither is happy with this but it happens. Along with them goes Grace's best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy), a rough and tumble fellow waitress with dreams of romance and a boyfriend who just doesn't seem to get her.The three land in France only to discover that the brochure about their planned trip doesn't quite live up to it's promises. Cramped hotels and getting only seconds to look at the sights isn't what they expected at all. Accidentally separated from their group, they stop in a hotel where Grace is mistaken for Cordelia Winthrop Scott, a socialite snob of English nobility who treats people like dirt. Overhearing that she's sneaking off to meet someone and avoid the press, shrugging off the duties of her position, Emma convinces the girls to take her place with Grace impersonating her.The usual follows with them enjoying the high life and never having to pay for it all. Financially that is. Emma is treated to the interest of a wealthy man and his ways. Grace meets a man in charge of the auction her ""character"" is supposed to be a part of and falls in love and Meg meets the man of her dreams who makes her open up a bit. As with the old movies, some are setting themselves up for a fall while others will find happiness. In the end it's all good and things work out for the best. Okay that's not a spoiler so no reason for a warning. These movies always end the same and that's just fine. It's not the end result that comes into play here but the journey it takes to get there that makes them fun.All three actresses do a fine job here, making you believe that they are the naive girls who just want to sample the good life before heading home to their mundane lives. While the situations they find themselves in seem a bit over the top, it's all in good fun and that's what watching this is all about. Looking for something light, fluffy and fun?

El-Hewie""","[1, 13]","Watching Selena Gomez in Ramona and Beezus, I could not resist but conclude that any other actor would have done much better that Gomez. Joey King was the real star there. Here, Monte Carlo is another piece of self-serving comedy that elevate Gomez far and beyond her real potential. The three females who went to Paris on summer vacation all seem to have not been preparing for performing their roles, their emotions detached form their actions, there were plenty of scenes where the three seem confused on what to do next.Gomez went through many abrupt changes in her dialogue and actions in a manner that is far from convincing.
