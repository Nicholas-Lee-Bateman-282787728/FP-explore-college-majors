I used to watch this when I was younger and I liked the fact that the main character is a woman doctor in the mid 1800's that finds a job on the frontier. All of the episodes deal with some type of conflict for example, disease and sterilization of tools, death, racism, Native American's being on reservations and losing their heritage, women in the field of medicine, love, the Union Pacific, and hardships that the frontier presented at the time. And this series comes with 1-6 seasons and 2 movies. I have only gotten through 4 seasons so far and I am getting pretty upset that it will be over soon. So, if you are looking for a good series for the family or just in general, I would recommend this one.",5,Great Family Show with an independent undertone,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,727,"['love', 'series', 'used', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'liked', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'woman', 'doctor', 'mid', '1800', 'job', 'frontier', 'episodes', 'deal', 'type', 'conflict', 'example', 'disease', 'sterilization', 'tools', 'death', 'racism', 'Native', 'American', 'being', 'reservations', 'losing', 'heritage', 'women', 'field', 'medicine', 'love', 'Union', 'Pacific', 'hardships', 'frontier', 'presented', 'time', 'series', '1-6', 'seasons', '2', 'movies', 'have', 'only', 'gotten', '4', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'am', 'getting', 'pretty', 'upset', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'series', 'family', 'just', 'general', 'would', 'recommend', 'one']","Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset"

I watched this show from beginning to end back in the 1990's and I think Jane Seymour was well cast, as was Joe Lando (Sully), the kids, the towns folk....everyone!! Oh, yes we can't forget Cloud Dancing (Larry Sellers).  My only complaint is that there is absolutely NO EPISODE GUIDE anywhere with this set.....it's not even writtten on the insides of these seasons!An episode guide for a set like this is necessary to find the episodes you are looking for, because they usually contain television log lines that tell you about each episode. So I am taking two stars off for that.....shame on you A&E; channel!A&E;?  You tried to appease us by adding a list of Episodes in the cover of the First Season....that is not enough!!! You mearly, copied what is already written on the backs of each season in this set. That's another reason this product is getting only three stars.I liked the price of this set, it used to be much higher, but this price resembles the product a lot more....a  good deal considerring there are six seasons plus two movies, and a few good extras.Like the A&E; Biography on Jane Seymour, interactive menues, and tidbits about the real Colorado Springs in the 1860's.I wish there were interviews with Joe Lando and Jane Seymour....instead they have voice over commentaries on favorite episodes.....Joe  was absolutely gorgeous!! This series teaches youngsters high moral values in my opinion.  It doesn't have eveything I want in it, but I am still enjoying myself when I watch these.

1161659,A8PP8NPRJSAKO,B00197POXG,Brazilian Jazzaholic!,"[7, 9]","""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" (DQMW) is one of my favorite TV series ever.  Since the series ended in 1998, numerous fans in the US and abroad (myself included) have been waiting with bated breath for the series to be released on DVD.  Over the years, certain episodes and individual seasons were released on VHS and DVD, but fans of the show were never able to own the ENTIRE series on DVD ... until now.DQMW was the type of series that caught on with viewers from the get-go.  I was completely hooked from the first time I saw the DQMW Pilot on January 1, 1993.  The Pilot was so well done and I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't wait to tune in for the 2nd episode, ""Epidemic,"" the following night.  Apparently, I was not alone: DQMW defied all expectations and became a hit with millions of viewers from the beginning.The series featured the character of Dr. Michaela (""Mike"") Quinn, a female doctor from Boston, Massachusetts in the mid-1860's.  Faced with the impenetrable glass ceiling that frustated women doctors at that time, Dr. Mike relocated to the Colorado Territory on the old US frontier.  There, she adjusted to her new life in Colorado Springs, adopted the 3 orphan children of her deceased friend, dealt with the townsfolks' initial mistrust of a ""lady doctor,"" and encountered the brooding, mysterious ""mountain man"" and friend of the Cheyenne Indians, Byron Sully (""Sully"").  Eventually, Dr. Mike gained the respect and friendship of the townsfolk, the familial love of her children, and the undying, romantic love of the elusive Sully.  As a series featuring a pioneering, educated woman (Dr. Mike) finding professional, emotional and spiritual fulfillment in the face of tremendous odds, DQMW provided a positive role model for many young women.The series addressed a variety of timeless topics, such as: Race & gender discrimination; physical & psychological diseases & cures; death; the effects of modernization & technology; family issues; growing up & teenage life; politics & US history; financial issues; romance (lots of it!); and marriage, pregnancy & childbirth. DQMW tackled it all (and then some!), all while preserving its status as a family show that could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.As a hopeless romantic, I was (and still am) a huge supporter of the epic romance between DQMW's lead characters, Michaela and Sully. The Michaela & Sully wedding episode was an ""event"" that I'll never forget. Joe Lando and Jane Seymour were pure MAGIC together onscreen, with an acting chemistry that comes along only once in a blue moon.  Simply put, they just don't make TV series like DQMW anymore.After a few years of surviving on Hallmark channel reruns of DQMW (until 2005), and the occasional internet clips, I recently fell in love with the series all over again when I bought this Complete Series Megaset when it was (finally!) released in the Fall of 2008. I've watched the entire series again from soup-to-nuts, and the 2 movies, which are included in the Megaset. And I've been reminded of why I adored DQMW in the first place.  If you were a fan of DQMW back in the 1990's, you're looking for a quality family show to share with your kids, or you're a hopeless romantic, the ""Dr. Quinn"" Complete Series Megaset is for you!",5,FINALLY ...

1161666,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B00197POXG,D. Fowler,"[1, 1]","No doubt about it, the complete series of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman provides a wallop in good clean entertainment.  In all this series has forty-two discs and if you factor in the cost of the entire series you are looking at a tad over a dollar per episode.  Keep in mind there are three or four episodes on each disc, episodes you can watch time and time again if you so choose. The movies are also included.  I've read all the other reviews, agree with some points and beg to differ on others.  I'm giving this series five stars, not for its minor glitches, but for the series itself.  It's just plain old wonderful!The packaging was well thought out.  Each disc is firmly tucked in its respective pocket, each page is glued back to back with the next and therefore the discs seem tight.  I simply tuck a finger under the paper in the front, reach in with my spare hand and carefully remove the disc.  The ring bound book can be tucked inside an accompanying hard cover sleeve to really keep the dust and grime out.I like the fact that there is a good table of contents, index and brief summaries under each disc in the book.  If anyone can recall a favorite episode, it's easy to find!  Not being as familiar with the series as I'd only seen a few, I find that when I put a disc in and click for an episode there is a more in depth recap of each story.  They're all so good I haven't skipped one over yet.Glitches?  Well, I suppose you can find a glitch in anything if you look hard enough.  The only one that irks me can be easily remedied.  The voices are not in sync on many of the discs.  I opted not to return the series as it was a great buy.  I either rewind slightly or open my DVD player and put the disc back in.  That little move is an easy, quick fix and voila!  The voices are right back on track giving me my entertainment fix for the evening.

Unfortunately I had just finished purchasing all six seasons individually a few months before this megaset came out.I was young when Dr. Quinn came on, and I watched it every Saturday night for the first few seasons. As the third season waned, I entered my upper teen years, and I had better things to do with my Saturday nights (and TiVo didn't exist yet).For years, all I had were a few OLD VHS with some episodes we'd recorded, like The Heart Within (forever to be known to me and my sister as Dr. Quinn Goes to Boston).Finally, one day, I did it--I bought the series. I kept this secret at first, not wanting to admit my great attachment to a show notorious for being adored by grannies the world over. But in time, I became aware of many friends who also remembered the series fondly and was able to loan out my discs to them. I was proud to own them!While working from home, I found myself zipping through disc by disc, season by season. Approaching the more unfamiliar seasons, I was surprised that right to the end, I immensely enjoyed each episode. The show never seemed to jump the shark.Now, that being said, I'm not going to ascribe adjectives to this show that it doesn't deserve. It has it's moments of getting a little too sappy or melodramatic. When used, the stock footage is always blatantly obvious. At times the acting is less that Emmy worthy...But all that doesn't matter to me, because despite its flaws, I love it. Is it because I'm a silly girl who will always have a heart that beats for Sully? Maybe. But it was a great show, the last of its kind.It was a show that empowered women without demeaning men, covered a wide range of timeless personal, historic, and societal issues, gave a real example of a healthy and successful marriage, taught timeless values, and was full of sweeping romance and thrilling drama.I've heard of petitions to resurrect the show, I don't know about that, but Dr. Quinn will always hold a place in my heart.",5,A Place in My Heart,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2036,"['review', 'show', 'not', 'necessarily', 'edition', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'purchasing', 'six', 'seasons', 'individually', 'few', 'months', 'megaset', 'came', 'out.I', 'was', 'young', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'came', 'watched', 'Saturday', 'night', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'third', 'season', 'waned', 'entered', 'upper', 'teen', 'years', 'had', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'TiVo', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', '.For', 'years', 'had', 'were', 'few', 'OLD', 'VHS', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'recorded', 'Heart', 'Within', 'forever', 'be', 'known', 'sister', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Goes', 'Boston', '.Finally', 'one', 'day', 'did', 'bought', 'series', 'kept', 'secret', 'first', 'not', 'wanting', 'admit', 'great', 'attachment', 'show', 'notorious', 'being', 'adored', 'grannies', 'world', 'time', 'became', 'aware', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'remembered', 'series', 'fondly', 'was', 'able', 'loan', 'out', 'discs', 'was', 'proud', 'own', 'working', 'home', 'found', 'zipping', 'disc', 'disc', 'season', 'season', 'Approaching', 'more', 'unfamiliar', 'seasons', 'was', 'surprised', 'that', 'right', 'end', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'show', 'never', 'seemed', 'jump', 'shark.Now', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'ascribe', 'adjectives', 'show', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'moments', 'getting', 'little', 'too', 'sappy', 'melodramatic', 'When', 'used', 'stock', 'footage', 'always', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'times', 'acting', 'less', 'Emmy', 'worthy', ""n't"", 'matter', 'flaws', 'love', ""'m"", 'silly', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'heart', 'Sully', 'Maybe', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'last', 'kind.It', 'was', 'show', 'empowered', 'women', 'demeaning', 'men', 'covered', 'wide', 'range', 'timeless', 'personal', 'historic', 'societal', 'issues', 'gave', 'real', 'example', 'healthy', 'successful', 'marriage', 'taught', 'timeless', 'values', 'was', 'full', 'sweeping', 'romance', 'thrilling', 'drama.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'petitions', 'resurrect', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'will', 'always', 'hold', 'place', 'heart']","Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset"

Caught an episode on cable TV a few months ago and was delighted with what I saw. However, coming into a *new* series without the background that this one requires would have made for a less enjoyable viewing. Therefore, when I saw what a low price Amazon had on this series with the movies included, I couldn't keep my finger off the *one click* button. I got my set in just a few days and have now watched the entire series (this is an update of my initial review).One of the things I really like about this show is that it's *clean*. No reliance on smut, profanity or shock value to entice the so-called mature viewer. There is some silliness -- Dr. Quinn's wardrobe should take up her entire house, for instance, and some of the plot lines are rather weak. (The girl with the webbed hands, for instance or the masquerade ball with Seymour in a Cinderella-like costume  -- not likely, the plastic surgery Dr. Quinn is able to perform on the disfigured railroad engineer, etc). Balancing that are some excellent performances by the main cast and the recognition that this was never meant to be Masterpiece Theatre. Outstanding episodes to me were The Abduction and the one where Grace and Robert E.'s son faces a serious illness. I also really enjoyed the episode in which Mr. Brays *runs away*. There are more but these were especially good.Anyone uneducated in the treatment of Native Americans during this time period will appreciate that for the most part, Dr. Quinn truly doesn't gloss over it. We are presented with attitudes that would shock us now but which were common at the time. The Washita episode is heartbreaking and Larry Sellers did an excellent job in conveying the reality behind the perception of Indian stoicism.So it helps immensely that Dr. Quinn has a great cast (my favorites being the lovely Jane Seymour and the sometimes crotchety, always interesting Orson Bean in the role of Mr. Bray).Indeed, there are many, many exciting and very touching moments. Larry Sellers does a wonderful job in conveying Cloud Dancing's innate dignity and Barbara Babcock is perfect as Dorothy. I preferred Erika Florez as Colleen but Jessica Bowman is very good. Chad Allen has some fine acting moments and Joe Lando was a very pleasant surprise.The core of the series, of course, is the love story between Dr. Mike and Sully. They are *so* different. My favorite part of that storyline is the two-part episode which takes Michaela and the children to Boston with a (justifiably) jealous Sully discovering he has a worthy rival for her affections. So romantic, and so much fun to watch!Anyways, Dr. Quinn is a pretty good series, one you won't be embarrassed to watch in front of your great aunt Bessie or your pre-teen children. The DVD packaging is perfect, in my opinion, and I like that the titles are easily visible on each DVD. I've ordered some series where you had to get out a magnifying glass to see which DVD you were looking at!Very good show and one well worth the money. I'll watch it again in a few years.",4,Just What the Doctor Ordered,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3133,"['always', 'admired', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'even', 'surprised', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'Caught', 'episode', 'cable', 'TV', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'delighted', 'what', 'saw', 'However', 'coming', '*new*', 'series', 'background', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'Therefore', 'when', 'saw', 'what', 'low', 'price', 'Amazon', 'had', 'series', 'movies', 'included', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'finger', '*one', 'click*', 'button', 'got', 'set', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'update', 'initial', 'review', '.One', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'show', '*clean*', 'reliance', 'smut', 'profanity', 'shock', 'value', 'entice', 'so-called', 'mature', 'viewer', 'silliness', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'wardrobe', 'should', 'take', 'up', 'entire', 'house', 'instance', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'rather', 'weak', 'girl', 'webbed', 'hands', 'instance', 'masquerade', 'ball', 'Seymour', 'Cinderella-like', 'costume', 'not', 'likely', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'able', 'perform', 'disfigured', 'railroad', 'engineer', 'etc', 'Balancing', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'main', 'cast', 'recognition', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Outstanding', 'episodes', 'were', 'Abduction', 'one', 'where', 'Grace', 'Robert', 'E.', 'son', 'serious', 'illness', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'Mr.', 'Brays', '*runs', 'away*', 'are', 'more', 'were', 'especially', 'good.Anyone', 'uneducated', 'treatment', 'Native', 'Americans', 'time', 'period', 'will', 'appreciate', 'most', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'truly', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'are', 'presented', 'attitudes', 'would', 'shock', 'now', 'were', 'common', 'time', 'Washita', 'episode', 'heartbreaking', 'Larry', 'Sellers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'reality', 'perception', 'Indian', 'stoicism.So', 'immensely', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'great', 'cast', 'favorites', 'being', 'lovely', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'sometimes', 'crotchety', 'always', 'interesting', 'Orson', 'Bean', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Bray', '.Indeed', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'exciting', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'Larry', 'Sellers', 'wonderful', 'job', 'conveying', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'innate', 'dignity', 'Barbara', 'Babcock', 'perfect', 'Dorothy', 'preferred', 'Erika', 'Florez', 'Colleen', 'Jessica', 'Bowman', 'very', 'good', 'Chad', 'Allen', 'fine', 'acting', 'moments', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise.The', 'core', 'series', 'course', 'love', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'are', '*so*', 'different', 'favorite', 'part', 'storyline', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Michaela', 'children', 'Boston', 'justifiably', 'jealous', 'Sully', 'discovering', 'worthy', 'rival', 'affections', 'So', 'romantic', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Anyways', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'pretty', 'good', 'series', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'embarrassed', 'watch', 'front', 'great', 'aunt', 'Bessie', 'pre-teen', 'children', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'perfect', 'opinion', 'like', 'titles', 'are', 'easily', 'visible', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ordered', 'series', 'where', 'had', 'get', 'out', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'see', 'DVD', 'were', 'looking', 'Very', 'good', 'show', 'one', 'money', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'years']","Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset"

The DVD set is well set up, although they really should have included closed captioning, :( but that is my only gripe.I'm almost at the end of the 5th season and the show never misses a beat.  It is inspiring to watch Dr. Quinn and her family (Sully too) show excellent values and hope, and patience, and to see the other characters evolve as she spreads her patience and kindness.  It is like every lesson there are words of wisdom or some lesson that you can follow to make you a better person.  The actors are wonderful and this was well thought out.  I started taking notes of to remind myself to be more present and see the good in all people.  I'm not deeply religious but spiritual, Dr. Quinn is inspiring.  It is also a show that tries to stick with being true to the date, hardships and all.I do recommend this for the whole family, even if a few others don't, maybe because the saloon has saloon girls.  It is done well and does not diminish the story. Everyone is treated with respect.If you want to feel good watch this!!

Ewing of this show, & many walks of life, with character's like Hank(the bartender/pimp), Jake(barber/mayor), Loren(store owner), characters I didn't like at first, but who grew on me, Larry Sellers was great as Cloud Dancing, Joe Lando as Sully, the show's heart & passion, Erika Flores as Colleen who I think outgrew the role of Colleen by being replaced by Jessica Bowman, even Chad Allen who later comes into his own as sherriff, many country music guest stars here as well (Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, Willie Nelson) & John Schneider, it was nice to see him in a role other than Bo Duke(Dukes of Hazzard), this role fit him perfectly as Sully's best friend later sherriff in the 5th & 6th Seasons....whether historically accurate or not, this show gives us the early western life of this nation in a more simpler time & watching the characters you realize that we as a nation have become slaves to our own prosperity & yet you can see the seeds being planted of the challenges now facing our nation today, this show for me was a good history lesson on our never ending need to make money even at the expense of others, all & all a good show, money well spent.",4,Great show....Great set!!....but.....,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2024,"['Having', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'initially', 'aired', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'engaging', 'addition', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'show', 'very', 'family', 'oriented', 'heartfelt', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'sadly', 'are', 'thing', 'past', 'network', 'T.V.', 'lot', 'history', 'show', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'one', 'few', 'women', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'there', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'beautiful', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'historical', 'events', 'run', 'parallel', 'one', 'General', 'Custard', 'war', 'native', 'indians', 'President', 'Grant', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'women', 'movement', 'Quinn', 'struggle', 'be', 'accepted', 'woman', 'doctor', 'plagues', 'killed', 'many', '1800', 'advancing', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'first', 'railroad', 'first', 'bank', 'run', 'Preston', 'Lodge', 'J.R.', 'Ewing', 'show', 'many', 'walks', 'life', 'character', 'Hank', 'bartender/pimp', 'Jake', 'barber/mayor', 'Loren', 'store', 'owner', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'who', 'grew', 'Larry', 'Sellers', 'was', 'great', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'Sully', 'show', 'heart', 'passion', 'Erika', 'Flores', 'Colleen', 'who', 'think', 'role', 'Colleen', 'being', 'replaced', 'Jessica', 'Bowman', 'even', 'Chad', 'Allen', 'who', 'later', 'own', 'sherriff', 'many', 'country', 'music', 'guest', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Travis', 'Tritt', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'John', 'Schneider', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'role', 'other', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'role', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'Sully', 'best', 'friend', 'later', 'sherriff', '5th', '6th', 'Seasons', '.whether', 'historically', 'accurate', 'not', 'show', 'early', 'western', 'life', 'nation', 'more', 'simpler', 'time', 'watching', 'characters', 'realize', 'nation', 'have', 'become', 'slaves', 'own', 'prosperity', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'seeds', 'being', 'planted', 'challenges', 'now', 'facing', 'nation', 'today', 'show', 'was', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', 'never', 'ending', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'even', 'expense', 'others', 'good', 'show', 'money', 'well', 'spent']","Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset"

I loved that each season is in its own box, and yet the discs are numbered consecutively (1-42) and clearly labeled... sometimes a ""complete series"" will use double-sided DVDs, to save space, but these are easy to read and handle. YES--the movies are also included (though not my favorite part, by any means... but that's another review).The series itself is great family entertainment, and wonderfully romantic. For once, a series managed to show a ""realistic"" (TV Realistic, anyway) relationship, from attraction through courting through marriage, without losing the dramatic elements. Viewers start to feel like they know all the unique townspeople, from Hank the saloon owner to Dorothy the journalist to Horace, the sweet but bumbling telegraph operator, who are lovable at least as often as they are less than intelligent. If you've never seen the series, you should be forewarned that almost every episode is a Very Special Episiode--Dr. Mike (our heroine) goes head to head with issues as varied as corporal punishment, teaching evolution, and gun violence. The character of Colleen is played by a different actress starting midway through (ala Becky from Roseanne or Darren from Bewitched). And the sixth season bogs down in more depressing episodes and less Sully (our hero). Still, it's great to see the characters and the town grow.
