That's who!THE BOOK OF POOH is a wonderful DVD.  First off, anything dealing with Disney's most loved character has to be sensational.  But the truth is, this truly is a remarkable DVD.Winnie the Pooh and his friends are so realistic looking, even though they are in the form of puppets, and the computer-generated annimated backrounds are fantastic.  The colors are so vivid and pleasing to the eye, it is hard not to enjoy the film.The DVD has a collection of six super stories featuring Pooh and the gang.  Each is beautifully done, with nice positive messages that are peppered with a subtle amount of humor and catchy songs to keep the audience entertained.  Tigger trying to teach Piglet how to become a Tigger is incredibly funny.  THE BOOK OF POOH is a winner.

Mitchell also is the creator of Bear in The Big Blue House, a favorite around our house. Hannah enjoyed The Book of Pooh, which in the end is vastly more important than my enjoyment of it. The DVD runs 70 mins, and Hannah sat and watched it from beginning to end (a mark of a good kid's DVD). The effect that they use on The Book of Pooh, where they marry puppets and computer animated backgrounds, is really cool; I found it much more aesthetic and approachable than the computer-only animation shows out there (like Rollie Pollie Olie). Honestly, I enjoy watching Bear in The Big Blue House more with Hannah, but The Book of Pooh was lightyears beyond the annoying Dragon Tales or insufferable Rugrats and I really like how at its heart The Book of Pooh is about teaching kids to love reading and storytelling.

My daughter was instantly able to relate to them and eagerly watched the rest of the movie. The movie is made up of a few short stories dealing which each character. Afterwards I asked her why she liked the movie and she said that the characters in this movie look real compared to the animated ones.
