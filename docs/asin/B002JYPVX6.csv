1273447,ARM1R53AAEVE8,B002JYPVX6,C. Lewis,"[3, 3]","I saw this play at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland,Ca. this play had me laughing from start to finish,my favorite part was the guy on the roller skates pretending to be 50 cent and vivica said, ""your never gonna let me forget 50 are you"" while ""in the club"" music was playing in the background. I had the opportunity to meet vivica fox in person during an autograph session. She looked pretty but clearly she was tired but like a trooper she kept on signing autographs. And I also had a chance to meet Lil G from Silk he is so cute and very charming and I took a picture with him, they charged me $20.00 just for a picture in the back of my mind I was thinking rip-off but on the same note it was worth it. I definitely recommend this play.",5,whatever she wants,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,741,"['saw', 'play', 'Paramount', 'Theatre', 'Oakland', 'Ca', 'play', 'had', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'guy', 'roller', 'pretending', 'be', '50', 'cent', 'vivica', 'said', 'never', 'gon', 'let', 'forget', '50', 'are', 'club', 'music', 'was', 'playing', 'background', 'had', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'vivica', 'fox', 'person', 'autograph', 'session', 'looked', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'was', 'tired', 'trooper', 'kept', 'signing', 'autographs', 'also', 'had', 'chance', 'meet', 'Lil', 'G', 'Silk', 'so', 'cute', 'very', 'charming', 'took', 'picture', 'charged', '20.00', 'just', 'picture', 'back', 'mind', 'was', 'thinking', 'rip-off', 'same', 'note', 'was', 'worth', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'play']",N/A

I wish that I could have seem it live but that probably will not happen in Arizona.Tyler has been here twice and I am standing up clapping for that.This play is a masterpiece of actors who really know their game well. It is well directed, and sets the mood for laughter, tears and thought.Vivica Foxx leads in with dialog that it too too funny. A cute little man machine which detects who is good for you or not in a social club setting. What fun! She is the owner of this club against her protective fathers blessings. Even with that being a factor however, her father decides to play a really poor joke on her (I won't give that part away), and it backfires on him.Throughout the play, you see complications in relationships however with different viewpoints played out by each character. Je Caryous does a fantastic job very realistic characters for each scene. Singers are doing it big too portraying this story line.I loved it!",5,Very very nice...,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,961,"['great', 'play', 'DVD', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seem', 'live', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'Arizona.Tyler', 'been', 'here', 'twice', 'am', 'standing', 'up', 'clapping', 'that.This', 'play', 'masterpiece', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'game', 'well', 'well', 'directed', 'mood', 'laughter', 'tears', 'thought.Vivica', 'Foxx', 'dialog', 'too', 'too', 'funny', 'cute', 'little', 'man', 'machine', 'detects', 'who', 'good', 'not', 'social', 'club', 'setting', 'What', 'fun', 'owner', 'club', 'protective', 'fathers', 'blessings', 'Even', 'being', 'factor', 'however', 'father', 'play', 'really', 'poor', 'joke', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'part', 'away', 'him.Throughout', 'play', 'see', 'complications', 'relationships', 'however', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'played', 'out', 'character', 'Je', 'Caryous', 'fantastic', 'job', 'very', 'realistic', 'characters', 'scene', 'Singers', 'are', 'doing', 'big', 'too', 'portraying', 'story', 'loved']",N/A
