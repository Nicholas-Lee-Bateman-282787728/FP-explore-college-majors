The rest of the film falls into an indescribable mess. Return to Horror High is one of the worst horror films ever made. Nothing of it makes sense, just one random scene to next resembling the worst of Plan 9 from Outer Space. In fact, Return to Horror High is probably Plan 10 from Outer Space. After maybe thirty minutes, I thought that I could probably stomach it, but as clock started to tick and tock by the minute, the movie was getting worse and worse until the unfathomable ending. Return to Horror High is one of those pictures that tries to be smart and fails in a big way. It is almost a movie within a movie within a movie, jumping around and confusing me.

375726,A2582KMXLK2P06,6303460046,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Let's see... how to describe this film?Simply bad, severely dated, an inexcusably low budget feel *and* a sorry horrible storyline designed to make fun of the horror genre rather than attempt to make a real effort at actual horror. That about sums up Return to Horror High.Basically Return to Horror High does absolutely nothing right. No suspense, no excitement, not even some frightening horror segments to at least salvage it somewhat.The storyline is about a group of people trying to become actors and actresses by making a horror film of their own inside a high school, all the while attempting to fool the cops and make it seem like people really ARE being killed inside the school.Of course there's also a REAL killer roaming around that makes his presence known sometimes... and this is what makes the storyline significantly worse.  Everything's basically a huge hidden joke- how CAN a film like this possibly be frightening?Every time you believe a real suspenseful moment of storytelling is taking place involving a real actual death, it quickly turns out to not be real in any shape or form, because every moment of horror is actually nonexistent and all part of the actors and actresses filming their own little movie throughout the hallways and classrooms.A lot of times what you believe is real is quickly interrupted with the movie directors saying ""Cut"" which completely interrupts the momentum the suspenseful storyline *could* have had.  This means you go from feeling fear to feeling cheated.I hate movies that mock the horror genre because they're neither funny or interesting and *definitely* not suspenseful. It's like these type of storylines fail completely around every single corner of storytelling, and that's exactly what Return to Horror High does- it completely misses the mark.

375729,AUDIJM3VUULS7,6303460046,Charles Tatum,"[3, 6]","As a matter of fact, George Clooney is the first victim in this slasher comedy wannabe. He is also the luckiest, since he does not have to endure the rest of the film.Five years after murders rock a high school, film makers return to shoot a film based on that event. Slowly, members of the cast and crew begin disappearing, indicating the killer is still lurking in the halls of Crippen High.The killer did not do enough slashing, he should have had a stab at this cliched script. All the film makers' characters have been done before. The director is all artistic frenzy, the producer is a sleazy scumbag, the screenwriter is ignored, and the actors are shallow. At one point, an actor playing a corpse with a hatchet in his face asks ""what is my motivation?,"" as if that joke has not been done a thousand times before.The hero here is a local cop and his cute actress girlfriend, who begin wandering around the set, writing down lists of names of the crew who have a connection to the high school. This plays like rejected scenes from ""Harriet the Spy,"" as they happen on a conversation, whip out a notebook, and nod and write. In the end, they do not even solve the murders, as the killer is revealed a'la ""Scooby-Doo.""Other familiar faces here are Vince Edwards, who proves he will appear in anything for a paycheck, and Maureen McCormick, TV's Marcia Brady, who has an odd role as an oversexed police woman. Clooney does disappear early, but the look on his face tells you he has to do this silliness to fill a resume.The film makers constantly try to trick the viewer with ""are you watching the film or the real thing?"" scenes that get real old after a while. The ending is insipid, makes no sense, and thankfully the sequel everyone promises then never was made...yet.""Return to Horror High"" should be held after class and put into detention.

375730,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303460046,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 5]","Parody, spoof, satire, prank, hoax, send-up, take-off, lampoon, jest, joke...call it whatever you want, but Return to Horror High (1987) is still a dog...and not a very original one at that, as the film brought to mind the movie Happy Birthday to Me (1981), which, comparatively, was modestly better.  That's not to say Return to Horror High couldn't have been more than it was, but it would have taken a whole lot of work to turn it around.  The film actually lists four writers, one of them being Bill Froehlich (""Freddy's Nightmares""), who was also the director, this being his first (and only) film.  Appearing is a number of actors I'm not familiar with like Brendan Hughes (Howling VI: The Freaks), Lori Lethin (Bloody Birthday), and Richard Brestoff (Car Wash), along with a few that I have heard of, like George Clooney (Welcome to Collinwood), Vince Edwards (""Ben Casey""), Alex Rocco (Detroit 9000), and Maureen McCormick, probably most known for her role as Marcia Brady on ""The Brady Bunch"" television series, but has had something of a career afterwards appearing in films like Dogtown (1997), The Million Dollar Kid (2000), and Title to Murder (2001), none of which I've actually seen, but they're out there.At the outset some text is displayed on the screen stating that in 1982, a series of brutal, savage murders occurred at Crippen High School, and the homicidal maniac responsible was never caught.  Flash forward to the present (I'm assuming the present being 1987, as that's when the film was released) and we learn a film crew is now occupying the since abandoned school with the intent on shooting a movie about the grisly events.  The low budget production has its problems, flighty actors, creative differences between the director and producer, etc., but what no one counted on was that the killer who struck so long ago may still be around...after the disappearance of a few crew members (hardly noticed by anyone...""Say, where's that grip?  What his name?""), lead actress Callie Cassidy (Lethin) and policeman/technical advisor turned lead actor (after the male lead left for a better part) Steven Blake (Hughes) become suspicious enough to suspect perhaps there is a malevolent force stalking the halls of Crippen High, an evil that's been waiting patiently these many years for some fresh blood...what gruesome secrets are stashed away within the bowels of the school?  Will you care?First of all, it should be noted this isn't really a horror movie in the conventional sense, but an attempt at a comedy poking fun at the genre.  As far as what I actually liked about the film, it wasn't much...I liked Alex Rocco's portrayal of the stereotypical, slightly sleazy, manipulative, condescending, two-faced, backstabbing movie producer Harry Sleerik who was more concerned with the elements the would sell a low budget horror film, specifically buckets of blood and lots of boobage, much to the chagrin of the director who fancies himself a junior Hitchcock of sorts, constantly perturbed at thoughts of having to compromise his artistic integrity for the sake of appealing to, in his eyes, the lowest common denominator...the sequence where Sleerik actually disrupts filming of a scene of the film within the film by grabbing the lead actresses chest, claiming something to the effect of `we need more of this' was really pretty funny.  Also, Vince Edwards was pretty good in his role as an actor playing the role of lecherous biology teacher named Mr. Birnbaum (""Mr. Birnbaum, why am I getting a C when I used to get A's? "", ""Have you looked in the mirror lately?"")  And that was really about it...there were perhaps a few more humorous moments, but nothing that stands out in my mind (and I only watched the thing last night).  The biggest problem with this movie, in my opinion, is something I believe someone else already brought up, specifically the convoluted nature of the story.  I think the intent was to blend the material in such a way as so it would be difficult for the viewer to discern what was actually the movie, and what was the movie within the movie.  The story begins sort of at the end, after most of the crew has been murderlated, and then flashes back to how the events came about.  This goes on constantly, along with the mixing of realities of the story with that of story of the film within the film...sound confusing?  Try watching it...throw in a dream sequence and what you have is a muddled mess, which lost my interest about halfway through.  Perhaps the material and how it would go down was clear in the director's mind, but I felt he got just a little to cutesy with it, especially this being his first film.  I can't really fault someone for taking a risk, trying to push the boundaries and break from the norm, but such a seemingly complex conceptualization, if not handled properly, will most certainly crash and burn, spectacularly, I might add.  I went into this blindly, assuming it was a straight up horror film, but eventually realized otherwise, but it did take awhile, as the comedic aspects were often subtle enough to make me question if the characters were parodies, or just being stupid (the latter not an uncommon occurrence in a lot of the slasher flicks of the early 80s).  Overall the acting was just this side of passable (other than the aforementioned performances by Rocco and Edwards), but I suppose someone would say that was also intentional due to the satirical nature of the material, but I'm not buying, as I've seen other parodies with much better performances.  I guess the gist of what I'm getting at is by the time this film was released, the slasher/horror genre had grown somewhat stale, even to the point where parodies of the genre had even become tired, but then that's just my opinion.Anchor Bay Entertainment, as usual, provides an excellent looking widescreen (1.85:1) print transfer on this DVD, along with a clear and audible Dolby Digital 2,0 Mono audio track.  I was surprised at the lack of extras, as all that's included is a theatrical trailer along with a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art on a card within the DVD case, the flipside listing the chapter stops.Cookieman108",2,"""Some of the bodies were pretty torn up, sir.""",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,6187,"['Parody', 'spoof', 'satire', 'prank', 'hoax', 'send-up', 'take-off', 'lampoon',

375731,A2JLX9KX51OWCM,6303460046,derek glidewell,"[16, 20]","Unlike many reviewers, I actually enjoyed this film, ""Return to Horror High"" is not only a 80's nostalgic slasher, it is also a spoof/satire on the whole low-budget horror film franchise, which I feel gives the film a big boost. The plot is rather original, it's not the typical ""invincible man in a mask stalking half naked teens through the woods with farm tools"" formula, it's about a film crew who is filming a low-budget horror film on a mass murder that happened 3 years ago at Crippen High, and mysteriously the killer was never apprehended. So as soon as filming begins, one by one the cast and crew start getting knocked off, and it's up our heroic duo to solve the mystery of who could be behind the murders and what really happened at Crippen High. The story is more ""in-depth"" than the typical 80's slasher flick and the acting is above average, as most of the cast provide very believable performances. The overall production value is high, as the effects are realistic, even when purposefully campy, and the overall school setting is eerie.As for the DVD, Anchor Bay has done another fine job restoring a lost 80's classic. The only feature is a trailer, which is more like a teaser, but is superbly crafted and is made of the highest quality, it's very convincing, very dark, and I personally do not see how it didn't sell the film well. The picture is in 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, and is excellent, no blotches, no streaks, no cracks, and the colors are well divided and very vibrant. My only complaint was the sound, if they would have done a 3.0 surrond, or even a 2.0 Stereo  remix, the effect of many ""BOO"" scenes would have been much greater as oppose to Mono. But still the dialogue and sound effects are distinguishable from each other and do not blend. Plus you get a mini theatrical one-sheet inside the package.Overall, I highly reccomend ""Return to Horror High"". Some may get confused by the ending, but I feel it's from a lack of paying attention, because I understood the ending just fine, but if you pay attention and listen carefully during the last 10 minutes, everything should make sense. Once again, Anchor Bay has provided us with another great classic and given it a nice transfer, plus a very reasonable price.

375737,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6303460046,Michael R Gates,"[6, 9]","In spite of what the title implies, 1987's RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is not a sequel but is, instead, a tongue-in-cheek horror film that is intended as a spoof of the slasher sub-genre wildly popular during the 1980s.  Interestingly, it predates Wes Craven's similarly themed (and excellent) SCREAM by almost 10 years. But RETURN TO HORROR HIGH doesn't even come close to Craven's magnum opus in terms of production quality, scares, or laughs.The word RETURN in the title of this film is not just a deliberately misleading joke; it also is a reference to the film's plot.  The story involves a group of filmmakers who have &quot;returned&quot; to Crippen High School to make a low-budget fictionalized horror movie about the &quot;real&quot; murders that occurred there 5 or so years earlier.  Unfortunately for these movie-mogul wannabees, the killer was never caught, and when members of the cast and crew start getting offed one by one, it looks like history might be repeating itself....Admittedly, RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is not an example of great horror filmmaking, not even as a spoof, especially when compared to later and better genre films that are both funny and scary--films like SCREAM (1986) and SCARY MOVIE (2000).  Its primary failures? One, the flashback structure of the plot is not handled well, easily causing confusion for the average audience member.  Two, a lot of the acting is, to put it succinctly, just plain rotten.  Three, the special FX are sometimes cheesy.  Four, it's nearly impossible to suspend disbelief during the disappointing Scooby-Doo-like revelation of the real killer.  And five, there is very little of the copious T&amp;A offered in many low-low-budget horror films as compensation for the low, low production values.Okay, so it's not going to appear on an AFI top-100 film list.  Still, RETURN TO HORROR HIGH does have its moments.  For example, some of the killings are staged in ways that are both creepy and humorous, the most notable being a decapitation that is done in silhouette, with the head rolling up into the air in subtle slow motion; and a little scene in which a cold-hearted and sadistic biology teacher gets dissected in much the same manner that he forced his students to cut up formaldehyde-saturated frogs.  Another cool segment is a dream-within-a-dream piece in which the audience is just as surprised as the dreamer each time one scenario segues into another. That one is carried off quite skillfully, and the scene's ending leaves viewers with both chuckles AND goosebumps.Also notable is the appearance of a few familiar faces.  Cinematic heartthrob George Clooney fills a minor role in one of his early career jobs, and in an interesting casting choice, Maureen McCormick--better known to couch potatoes as Marcia Brady on TV's THE BRADY BUNCH--appears as an oversexed police woman who seems to get turned on by all the blood.  Gravelly voiced Alex Rocco, ubiquitous character actor of TV and the silver screen, generates a few chuckles playing a lecherous movie producer. And fans of vintage TV should recognize Vince Edwards, the actor who came to fame playing the title character on the show BEN CASEY in the 1960s.  Although she is a lesser-known actor with a smaller resume than those listed above, some movie buffs may also recognize Lori Lethin, who here plays one of the main protagonists in the film's &quot;flashback&quot; sequences.  Not only is Ms. Lethin quite attractive, she does a pretty good job of acting, too.As is almost always the case with Anchor Bay releases, the DVD offers a nearly pristine transfer of the movie.  The disc does present the film in anamorphic widescreen, but other than the trailer, there are no bonus features.  Considering the low retail price, lack of extras is no problem for those who want to add the disc to their collections.  However, this release of a so-bad-it's-good film would have greatly benefited from the inclusion of a feature commentary with members of the cast or crew.To recap, RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is, overall, a pretty poor film.  But it's one of those awful films that is, under the right circumstances, just good enough that it's actually fun to watch, though it's just bad enough that you won't admit you watch it.  For some genre fans, then, this film might be one of their guilty pleasures.  If so, the Anchor Bay DVD will definitely be something those fans will want to pick up.",2,A Horror Comedy Has Never Been This...Dead,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,4416,"['spite', 'what', 'title', 'implies', '1987', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'HORROR', 'HIGH', 'not', 'sequel', 'instead', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'horror', 'film', 'intended', 'spoof', 'slasher', 'sub-genre', 'wildly', 'popular', '1980s', 'Interestingly', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'similarly', 'themed', 'excellent', 'SCREAM', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'HORROR', 'HIGH', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Craven', 'magnum', 'opus', 'terms', 'production', 'quality', 'scares', 'laughs.The', 'word', 'RETURN', 'title', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'deliberately', 'misleading', 'joke', 'also', 'reference', 'film', 'plot', 'story', 'group', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'quot', 'returned', 'quot', 'Crippen', 'High', 'School', 'make', 'low-budget', 'fictionalized', 'horror', 'movie', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'murders', 'occurred', '5', 'so', 'years', 'earlier', 'Unfortunately', 'movie-mogul', 'wannabees', 'killer', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'when', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'start', 'getting', 'one', 'one', 'history', 'might', 'be', 'repeating', '.Admittedly', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'HORROR', 'HIGH', 'not', 'example', 'great', 'horror', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'even', 'spoof', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'later', 'better', 'genre', 'films', 'are', 'funny', 'scary', 'films', 'SCREAM', '1986', 'SCARY', 'MOVIE', '2000', 'primary', 'failures', 'One', 'flashback', 'structure', 'plot', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'easily', 'causing', 'confusion', 'average', 'audience', 'member', 'Two', 'lot', 'acting', 'put', 'succinctly', 'just', 'plain', 'rotten', 'Three', 'special', 'FX', 'are', 'sometimes', 'cheesy', 'Four', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'disappointing', 'Scooby-Doo-like', 'revelation', 'real', 'killer', 'five', 'very', 'little', 'copious', 'T', 'amp', 'offered', 'many', 'low-low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'compensation', 'low', 'low', 'production', 'values.Okay', 'not', 'going', 'appear', 'AFI', 'top-100', 'film', 'list', 'Still', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'HORROR', 'HIGH', 'have', 'moments', 'example', 'killings', 'are', 'staged', 'ways', 'are', 'creepy', 'humorous', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'decapitation', 'done', 'silhouette', 'head', 'rolling', 'up', 'air', 'subtle', 'slow', 'motion', 'little', 'scene', 'cold-hearted', 'sadistic', 'biology', 'teacher', 'dissected', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'forced', 'students', 'cut', 'up', 'formaldehyde-saturated', 'frogs', 'cool', 'segment', 'dream-within-a-dream', 'piece', 'audience', 'just', 'as', 'surprised', 'dreamer', 'time', 'one', 'scenario', 'one', 'carried', 'quite', 'skillfully', 'scene', 'ending', 'viewers', 'chuckles', 'goosebumps.Also', 'notable', 'appearance', 'few', 'familiar', 'Cinematic', 'heartthrob', 'George', 'Clooney', 'minor', 'role', 'one', 'early', 'career', 'jobs', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choice', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'better', 'known', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'Marcia', 'Brady', 'TV', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'oversexed', 'police', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'turned', 'blood', 'Gravelly', 'voiced', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'ubiquitous', 'character', 'actor', 'TV', 'silver', 'screen', 'few', 'chuckles', 'playing', 'lecherous', 'movie', 'producer', 'fans', 'vintage', 'TV', 'should', 'recognize', 'Vince', 'Edwards', 'actor', 'who', 'came', 'fame', 'playing', 'title', 'character', 'show', 'BEN', 'CASEY', '1960s', 'lesser-known', 'actor', 'smaller', 'resume', 'listed', 'movie', 'buffs', 'may', 'also', 'recognize', 'Lori', 'Lethin', 'who', 'here', 'one', 'main', 'protagonists', 'film', 'quot', 'flashback', 'quot', 'sequences', 'Not', 'only', 'Ms.', 'Lethin', 'quite', 'attractive', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'too.As', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'transfer', 'movie', 'disc', 'present', 'film', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'other', 'trailer', 'are', 'bonus', 'Considering', 'low', 'retail', 'price', 'lack', 'extras', 'problem', 'who', 'want', 'add', 'disc', 'collections', 'However', 'release', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'film', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'benefited', 'inclusion', 'feature', 'commentary', 'members', 'cast', 'crew.To', 'recap', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'HORROR', 'HIGH', 'overall', 'pretty', 'poor', 'film', 'one', 'awful', 'films', 'right', 'circumstances', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'just', 'bad', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'watch', 'genre', 'fans', 'then', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'so', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'something', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'pick', 'up']",Return to Horror High VHS

375739,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303460046,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Return to Horror High (Bill Froehlich, 1987)Those few who remember the ridiculous Return to Horror High, a movie made at the very edge of the golden age of the slasher film, remember it for one reason: it was an early film role (his third big-screen appearance) for a twenty-one-year-old George Clooney. What fewer people remember about the movie is that it also contains, for roughly the same amount of screen time, one of TV's most bankable seventies stars, Maureen McCormick. Yes, Marcia Brady (who went on to another lucrative TV career a couple of years later in The Love Boat, as well as being a guest star on Fantasy Island more times than you can shake a stick at), who'd abandoned her attempt at a big-screen career way back in 1981, picked this movie to try and break out again. It didn't work too well--she would make only three more features between 1987 and 2000--but man, as crappy as this movie is, Maureen McCormick rocks in it. (And, if you're one of the tl;dr crowd, I'll just tell you the punch line now: she's the only reason to watch this turkey, but she's oh so worth it.)Plot: some years ago, a killer terrorized Crippen High School. Now, someone's making a movie about the incident. A bunch of someones, actually, and they're at odds. The producer is a low-budget sleazeball who's interested in getting as much of the first two of Joe Bob's three Bs on the screen as possible, while the director and the writer--one of the survivor's of the killer's rampage--are trying to make something that might actually be considered a good movie. As if that wasn't enough of a problem, there's a possibility that the killer--who was never caught--has returned to the scene of his crimes to get up to the same old hijinks...Seriously, this is bad. I mean, awful. It doesn't work as a horror film, it barely works as a comedy. And you're going to wonder why I told you to watch this for the majority of its length. Trust me, the payoff comes at the end. Ms. McCormick, who, let's face it, was involved in three of the most wholesome family shows ever to grace a television screen, decided to try the same breakout technique tried by some other actresses who were considered to be typecast as teens. Except where, say, Christina Applegate tried to do the erotic drama (Claudine's Return, which is almost--almost--as bad as this movie is), Ms McCormick got stuck here...but wanted to try that same approach. And so there's a glorious scene about ten minutes from the end of McCormick, covered in fake blood, writhing sensuously that must be seen to be believed. If you grew up with The Brady Bunch, it will probably scar you for life. I loved it. I rewound and watched it again--something I will never do with any other scene in this mess of a movie. * ",2,"This movie is so bad it's... nah, it's just bad.",1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,2762,"['Return', 'Horror', 'High', 'Bill', 'Froehlich', '1987', 'few', 'who', 'remember', 'ridiculous', 'Return', 'Horror', 'High', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'edge', 'golden', 'age', 'slasher', 'film', 'remember', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'third', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'twenty-one-year-old', 'George', 'Clooney', 'What', 'fewer', 'people', 'remember', 'movie', 'also', 'roughly', 'same', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'one', 'TV', 'most', 'bankable', 'seventies', 'stars', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'Yes', 'Marcia', 'Brady', 'who', 'went', 'lucrative', 'TV', 'career', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Love', 'Boat', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'guest', 'star', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'who', ""'d"", 'abandoned', 'attempt', 'big-screen', 'career', 'way', 'back', '1981', 'picked', 'movie', 'try', 'break', 'out', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'three', 'more', 'features', '1987', '2000', 'man', 'as', 'crappy', 'movie', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', ""'re"", 'one', 'tl', 'dr', 'crowd', ""'ll"", 'just', 'tell', 'punch', 'line', 'now', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'turkey', 'so', 'Plot', 'years', 'ago', 'killer', 'terrorized', 'Crippen', 'High', 'School', 'Now', 'someone', 'making', 'movie', 'incident', 'bunch', 'someones', 'actually', ""'re"", 'odds', 'producer', 'low-budget', 'sleazeball', 'who', 'interested', 'getting', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'three', 'Bs', 'screen', 'possible', 'director', 'writer', 'one', 'survivor', 'killer', 'rampage', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'problem', 'possibility', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'returned', 'scene', 'crimes', 'get', 'up', 'same', 'old', 'hijinks', 'Seriously', 'bad', 'mean', 'awful', ""n't"", 'work', 'horror', 'film', 'barely', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'going', 'wonder', 'why', 'told', 'watch', 'majority', 'length', 'Trust', 'payoff', 'end', 'Ms.', 'McCormick', 'who', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'involved', 'three', 'most', 'wholesome', 'family', 'ever', 'grace', 'television', 'screen', 'decided', 'try', 'same', 'breakout', 'technique', 'tried', 'other', 'actresses', 'who', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'typecast', 'teens', 'where', 'say', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'tried', 'do', 'erotic', 'drama', 'Claudine', 'Return', 'almost', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', 'Ms', 'McCormick', 'got', 'stuck', 'here', 'wanted', 'try', 'same', 'approach', 'so', 'glorious', 'scene', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'McCormick', 'covered', 'fake', 'blood', 'writhing', 'sensuously', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'grew', 'up', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'will', 'probably', 'scar', 'life', 'loved', 'rewound', 'watched', 'again', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'other', 'scene', 'mess', 'movie', '*']",Return to Horror High VHS

The film allows the characters to understand that they may be involved in a &quot;horror film&quot; plot and thus they attempt to act accordingly. Many of the jokes fall flat and the film as a whole is essentially a set-up for the fairly amusing payoff ending. For an early eighties &quot;gore&quot; film there is not much blood and those seeking such should look elsewhere. It is rather humorous to see an actor of George Clooney's &quot;stature&quot; earning his wings in this low budget horror. Overall, if you are up for a minor piece of fluff on a boring Saturday night, this will fit the bill. The DVD picture is good, a trailer is included but there are no other extras.

The reason it seems to have these issues is because it: (1) lacks quality caliber actors and actresses (yes, it did have George Clooney and his bloody moment did come off rather well, and Marcia Brady was a bit odd to see here as well), (2) lacked an awe-striking budget, (3) sometimes hits a few plotholes has it trudges through various deaths, (4) it has a few laughs along the way. Still, the elements to something enjoyable all manifest themselves herein.Return to Horror High is a movie about someone making a movie about a massacre that took place years removed. In it, they decide to use the scene of the crime itself, people that had knowledge of what had transpired here in the past (including the school's principal, its janitor, and a local policeman), and some portions of truth in their otherwise horror-prone plot. Since its low budget they also want the actors to go that ""extra mile"" as well, having them pick up the extra slots left open by people ""quitting the film"" as well as staying on location day and night while its shot. Little do they realize that something is there working with them in the dark with them, something that obviously doesn't mind a sequel.Personally, I enjoyed this movie and I think that other people will enjoy it as well, given the fact that they understand exactly what they are watching. Be warned, however, that it is lacking in many respects and that you have to appreciate the qualities of a good laugh to really enjoy this.",4,Everything Scream Has A ForeFather,1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,1703,"['Return', 'Horror', 'High', 'beginning', 'entire', 'limb', 'horror', 'leaned', 'away', 'trying', 'be', 'truly', 'horrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'received', 'open', 'arms', 'when', 'spoof', 'qualities', 'were', 'first', 'exhibited', 'still', 'problems', 'day', 'reason', 'have', 'issues', '1', 'quality', 'caliber', 'actors', 'actresses', 'yes', 'did', 'have', 'George', 'Clooney', 'bloody', 'moment', 'did', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'well', 'Marcia', 'Brady', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'see', 'here', 'as', 'well', '2', 'lacked', 'awe-striking', 'budget', '3', 'sometimes', 'few', 'plotholes', 'various', 'deaths', '4', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'Still', 'elements', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'manifest', 'herein.Return', 'Horror', 'High', 'movie', 'someone', 'making', 'movie', 'massacre', 'took', 'place', 'years', 'removed', 'decide', 'use', 'scene', 'crime', 'people', 'had', 'knowledge', 'what', 'had', 'transpired', 'here', 'past', 'including', 'school', 'principal', 'janitor', 'local', 'policeman', 'portions', 'truth', 'otherwise', 'horror-prone', 'plot', 'low', 'budget', 'also', 'want', 'actors', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'pick', 'up', 'extra', 'slots', 'left', 'open', 'people', 'quitting', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'staying', 'location', 'day', 'night', 'shot', 'Little', 'do', 'realize', 'something', 'there', 'working', 'dark', 'something', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sequel.Personally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'think', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'fact', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'Be', 'warned', 'however', 'lacking', 'many', 'respects', 'have', 'appreciate', 'qualities', 'good', 'laugh', 'really', 'enjoy']",Return to Horror High VHS
