1653867,A38NGZ2PXBH01X,B00D6I7IYY,Dusty Kramer,"[0, 0]","A 1952 drama about a United States Forest Service smokejumper (Richard Widmark) who works to save his fire fighting crew from a disastrous forest fire and how the son of a smokejumper that was lost reacts to his perceived cowardice. This film is loosely based on a real event, the Mann Gulch Fire of 1949. If you like breathtaking scenery you'll probably find a great interest in this film. The acting is a little over dramatic at times, but nothing anymore unusual for early '50s films. Widmark, as he usually does, effects a strong performance, but at the expense of very slight overacting. Plausible because this film is based on a real event, the story is surrounded most of the time by natural action.  .",4,Based on a real event,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,709,"['1952', 'drama', 'United', 'States', 'Forest', 'Service', 'smokejumper', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'who', 'save', 'fire', 'fighting', 'crew', 'disastrous', 'forest', 'fire', 'how', 'son', 'smokejumper', 'was', 'lost', 'reacts', 'perceived', 'cowardice', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'event', 'Mann', 'Gulch', 'Fire', '1949', 'like', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'great', 'interest', 'film', 'acting', 'little', 'dramatic', 'times', 'nothing', 'anymore', 'unusual', 'early', ""'50s"", 'films', 'Widmark', 'usually', 'effects', 'strong', 'performance', 'expense', 'very', 'slight', 'overacting', 'Plausible', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'event', 'story', 'surrounded', 'most', 'time', 'natural', 'action']",Red Skies of Montana
1653868,A3LELA17Z2VC61,B00D6I7IYY,Eric,"[1, 1]","This DVD has great color and comes in a good packaging.  The movie is well known but little seen.  The story is inspired by the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire that claimed the lives of a smokejumper crew and the surviving leader was the subject of an investigation and was cleared of any wrong doing.  This film is a fictional version of that incident with Richard Widmark as the surviving team leader.  Widmark had made a career out of playing aloof hard nosed leaders of elite teams.  This movie comes just one year of him playing the leader of a team of Underwater Demolition Team divers in ""The Frogmen"" and while that movie inspired a generation of watermen to become frogmen and SEALs it is no doubt that this movie played a big part in leading young foresters to become smokejumpers.The movie shows many of the unique aspects of smokejumping, such as the ford tri-motor aircraft that they jumped from and also special training like the use of loweringlines and the dreaded sit up rack and has some good jump scenes. A few years ago I worked on airfield improvements at the Missoula smokejumper center, where this movie was filmed, and it was interesting to compare it from than and now.I first became aware of smokejumpers in the 1970's in jr High School when I read the book ""The Smokejumpers"" by Randle Hurst about 1955 fire season.  After 6 years as an army paratrooper I became a park ranger but went to work under the waves as an underwater rescue/swift water rescue specialist.  That was rewarding but when a touring Ford Tri-motor came to my airfield I took a ride and sat by the jump door and dreamed about what could have been.This is a good movie and a good way to enjoy the outdoors when you are in doors.Eric Howard, former Director of the Lee's Summit Underwater Rescue & Recovery team",5,An Outdoors Adventure Classic,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,1795,"['DVD', 'great', 'color', 'good', 'packaging', 'movie', 'well', 'known', 'little', 'seen', 'story', 'inspired', '1949', 'Mann', 'Gulch', 'Fire', 'claimed', 'lives', 'smokejumper', 'crew', 'surviving', 'leader', 'was', 'subject', 'investigation', 'was', 'cleared', 'wrong', 'doing', 'film', 'fictional', 'version', 'incident', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'surviving', 'team', 'leader', 'Widmark', 'had', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'aloof', 'hard', 'nosed', 'leaders', 'elite', 'teams', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'playing', 'leader', 'team', 'Underwater', 'Demolition', 'Team', 'divers', 'Frogmen', 'movie', 'inspired', 'generation', 'watermen', 'become', 'frogmen', 'SEALs', 'doubt', 'movie', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'leading', 'young', 'foresters', 'become', 'smokejumpers.The', 'movie', 'many', 'unique', 'aspects', 'smokejumping', 'such', 'ford', 'tri-motor', 'aircraft', 'jumped', 'also', 'special', 'training', 'use', 'loweringlines', 'dreaded', 'sit', 'up', 'rack', 'good', 'jump', 'scenes', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'worked', 'airfield', 'improvements', 'Missoula', 'smokejumper', 'center', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'interesting', 'compare', 'now.I', 'first', 'became', 'aware', 'smokejumpers', '1970', 'jr', 'High', 'School', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Smokejumpers', 'Randle', 'Hurst', '1955', 'fire', 'season', '6', 'years', 'army', 'paratrooper', 'became', 'park', 'ranger', 'went', 'work', 'waves', 'underwater', 'rescue/swift', 'water', 'rescue', 'specialist', 'was', 'rewarding', 'when', 'touring', 'Ford', 'Tri-motor', 'came', 'airfield', 'took', 'ride', 'sat', 'jump', 'door', 'dreamed', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.This', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'way', 'enjoy', 'outdoors', 'when', 'are', 'doors.Eric', 'Howard', 'former', 'Director', 'Lee', 'Summit', 'Underwater', 'Rescue', 'Recovery', 'team']",Red Skies of Montana

1653870,A1AUIUPJPHH890,B00D6I7IYY,Michael Shepley,"[7, 7]","The re-emergence of this film is extremely timely, given the tragic deaths of 19 firefighters in Arizona as of July 1, 2013.  The film starkly shows how dangerous these wildfires are. How they put the movie together is a wonder, particularly in an era without computer special effects.  Trees are burning and exploding all over the place.  You learn a great deal about fire-fighting back in the 1950s (Richard Widmark has a walky-talky that looks like a giant handheld robot) and it's in color no less.  The blah actress Constance Smith is given top billing but has little to do but wish her husband (Widmark) well as he goes off to fight another fire.  (She's vacuuming the bedroom when he calls to tell her.)  There's a big misunderstanding by Jeffrey Hunter about Richard Widmark, but it all gets resolved at the end after everyone fights a really big fire.  Richard Boone, who has always seem dour and depressing to me, turns in a really good performance here and is sympathetic to boot.  Oh, by the way Fox Cinema Archive fans -- there's a pet raccoon in this film and I believe it's the same one used in ""Lost in the Wilderness.""  A good full-frame (4:3) print.

1653873,AEOTFNGGN2A9E,B00D6I7IYY,Pvt. W.G. Kirby,"[11, 12]","As I write this, the shock of the loss of nineteen firefighters in the major wildfires in Arizona is still an open wound on the hearts of all who consider such men and women doing this as a career as  true heroes. Indeed, my DVD arrived on the day of the memorial service in Arizona for the fallen ""Hotshots"". Forest fires, newly coined as ""Wildfires"" are part of life in the American West. They will always occur, and teams of firefighters will always go into danger to extinguish them to lessen loss of life and property. And unfortunately, from time to time, some of these courageous women and men will lose the fight and their lives.The Red Skies of Montanna was produced in 1952 and is the story of the loss of five of six members of a crew of elite  ""smokejumpers"" working on a remote fire in the forests of Montanna, much the same as what has just happened as life imitated art. In this story, however the foreman of the crew is the only survivor, and in investigations that clear him, the seeds of doubt as to his courage are planted in his own mind as well as in the mind of the son of one of the killed crewmen, and the film rides on this terrible  tide of amnesiac doubt, mistrust, and blame. Richard Widmark as the survivor and Jeffery Hunter as the vengeful son shoulder the load. Action is present in a well done plot and Technicolor photography is beautiful, although most intense in fire scenes. And speaking of scenes, the film was mostly shot on location with some real fires filmed and intercut with studio filmed special effects. That's real fire the actors are filmed in, with the only model stuff shown is some false forests going up. No computer effects were even dreamed of then. Hats off to 20th Century Fox on this one. The cast actually went through a substantial bit of U.S. Forest Service basic training and show the smokejumper drills with actors doing a lot of the stuff. Also to be found among the actors are many guys who would later be recognizable faces in movies ant TV of the 50s and 60s- Richard Boone, Richard Crenna( in the equipment line behind "" Pop"" as the doomed men gear up for the drop early in the film), John Fiedler( we know him as the little owl-faced milquetoast actor from the era, but mostly as ""Lawyer Dagget"" from TRUE GRIT),and in the crew cafeteria and later on the fire line at the climax of the movie, look for Charles Bronson.The Forest Service also supplied equipment and aircraft for the film. Great shots of the smokejumpers inside and leaving a USFS Ford TriMotor. A movie to watch as well as own. (Boy, it would be a natural to remake and update today.)One final note, the story here is fiction, but it is rooted in fact. In 1949, a smokejumper team was lost in fighting a fire in the Mann Gulch tragedy. This story borrows a bit from those events. And still more, in the late  1990s, Sebastian Junger, writer of The Perfect Storm, wrote the book YOUNG MEN AND FIRE, telling the story of yet another such fatal tragedy as well as directing interest towards the Mann Gulch event and this film. One more book- Stan Cohen of Missoula, Montanna, home of the smokejumpers school, wrote a history of SMOKEJUMPING in the 1980s with references to the above movie and events up to that time.",5,Timely release of a long awaited movie.,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,3247,"['write', 'shock', 'loss', 'nineteen', 'firefighters', 'major', 'wildfires', 'Arizona', 'still', 'open', 'wound', 'hearts', 'who', 'consider', 'such', 'men', 'women', 'doing', 'career', 'true', 'heroes', 'Indeed', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'day', 'memorial', 'service', 'Arizona', 'fallen', 'Hotshots', 'Forest', 'fires', 'newly', 'coined', 'Wildfires', 'are', 'part', 'life', 'American', 'West', 'will', 'always', 'occur', 'teams', 'firefighters', 'will', 'always', 'go', 'danger', 'extinguish', 'lessen', 'loss', 'life', 'property', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'time', 'courageous', 'women', 'men', 'will', 'lose', 'fight', 'lives.The', 'Red', 'Skies', 'Montanna', 'was', 'produced', '1952', 'story', 'loss', 'five', 'six', 'members', 'crew', 'elite', 'smokejumpers', 'working', 'remote', 'fire', 'forests', 'Montanna', 'much', 'same', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'life', 'imitated', 'art', 'story', 'however', 'foreman', 'crew', 'only', 'survivor', 'investigations', 'clear', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'courage', 'are', 'planted', 'own', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'mind', 'son', 'one', 'killed', 'crewmen', 'film', 'terrible', 'tide', 'amnesiac', 'doubt', 'mistrust', 'blame', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'survivor', 'Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'vengeful', 'son', 'shoulder', 'load', 'Action', 'present', 'well', 'done', 'plot', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'most', 'intense', 'fire', 'scenes', 'speaking', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'shot', 'location', 'real', 'fires', 'filmed', 'intercut', 'studio', 'filmed', 'special', 'effects', 'real', 'fire', 'actors', 'are', 'filmed', 'only', 'model', 'stuff', 'shown', 'false', 'forests', 'going', 'up', 'computer', 'effects', 'were', 'even', 'dreamed', 'then', 'Hats', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'one', 'cast', 'actually', 'went', 'substantial', 'bit', 'U.S.', 'Forest', 'Service', 'basic', 'training', 'show', 'smokejumper', 'actors', 'doing', 'lot', 'stuff', 'Also', 'be', 'found', 'actors', 'are', 'many', 'guys', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'recognizable', 'movies', 'ant', 'TV', '50s', '60s-', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'equipment', 'line', 'Pop', 'doomed', 'men', 'gear', 'up', 'drop', 'early', 'film', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'know', 'little', 'owl-faced', 'milquetoast', 'actor', 'era', 'mostly', 'Lawyer', 'Dagget', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'crew', 'cafeteria', 'later', 'fire', 'line', 'climax', 'movie', 'look', 'Charles', 'Bronson.The', 'Forest', 'Service', 'also', 'supplied', 'equipment', 'aircraft', 'film', 'Great', 'shots', 'smokejumpers', 'leaving', 'USFS', 'Ford', 'TriMotor', 'movie', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'Boy', 'would', 'be', 'natural', 'remake', 'update', 'today', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'story', 'here', 'fiction', 'rooted', 'fact', '1949', 'smokejumper', 'team', 'was', 'lost', 'fighting', 'fire', 'Mann', 'Gulch', 'tragedy', 'story', 'bit', 'events', 'still', 'more', 'late', '1990s', 'Sebastian', 'Junger', 'writer', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'wrote', 'book', 'YOUNG', 'MEN', 'AND', 'FIRE', 'telling', 'story', 'yet', 'such', 'fatal', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'interest', 'Mann', 'Gulch', 'event', 'film', 'One', 'more', 'book-', 'Stan', 'Cohen', 'Missoula', 'Montanna', 'home', 'smokejumpers', 'school', 'wrote', 'history', 'SMOKEJUMPING', '1980s', 'references', 'above', 'movie', 'events', 'up', 'time']",Red Skies of Montana

Smoke Jumpers, (later renamed Red Skies of Montana) protrays the first 'hot shots' in the USFS.  Paratroopers dropped into back country wild fires to hold the lines until Cats could clear roads into the fire zones for full on assaults.  The delight is seeing the country as it was sixty years ago; the cars we drove, the way we dressed and talked, and what we expected of ourselves.  The simple plot of this film unwinds within the war zone of big fires.  It's all he-man and the social mores are so different.  Women stayed home and fretted and men went out to slay the dragons.  Really it's the look back to another time I enjoy the most.  Depiction films, movies based in current affairs, show us close ups and wide angles on our own past.  Our Grandfathers, my Dad, I'm 61, lived these movies.  They take us back.  Richard Widmark had a talent for the troubled, introverted, courageous, everyman.
