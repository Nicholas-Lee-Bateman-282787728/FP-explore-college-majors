579770,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00005B1WX,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[74, 78]","Good collection of Rascals shorts. ""Shrimps For A day"" is the classic tale of Spanky and two midgets (Olive and Dick Brasno) who lead a kiddie revolt against a tyrannical orphanage owner. If seen in childhood, it will stay in your mind forever! ""Hi Neighbor"" and ""Fly My Kite"" are great, but easily available elsewhere (they seem to be on almost every Our Gang DVD). ""Beginner's Luck"" is a howl-fest about Spanky's misadventures at a kiddie talent show. Look for Alfalfa's debut in this one as well as the Five cabin Kids, a talented group of Black children who were quite popular at the time. Check the kiddie imitation of Louis Armstrong!Then there's ""The Kid From Borneo."" One of the less ""politically correct"" Rascal epics, modern Black viewers may not take well to the story of the children's encounter with a Black ""jungle savage"". Stymie (of all people) is given lines referring to the title character as a ""sissy cannibal"" and a ""gorilla ape."" However, it does have moments of real humor and contains some great chase scenes. One has to really ""leave your brains at the door"" to enjoy this one and remember that the positive racial aspects of the Rascals far outweigh the negative, given the times that they were made. Personally, my reaction to the film veers between cringing and laughter, although I've seen far worse.That aside, the transfers vary and youmay have to turn up the brightness on your tv to enjoy this set. But overall, a good collection, especially for longtime fans.",4,Affordable Good Stuff,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,1493,"['Good', 'collection', 'Rascals', 'shorts', 'Shrimps', 'day', 'classic', 'tale', 'Spanky', 'two', 'midgets', 'Olive', 'Dick', 'Brasno', 'who', 'lead', 'kiddie', 'revolt', 'tyrannical', 'orphanage', 'owner', 'seen', 'childhood', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'forever', 'Hi', 'Neighbor', 'Fly', 'My', 'Kite', 'are', 'great', 'easily', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'seem', 'be', 'almost', 'Gang', 'DVD', 'Beginner', 'Luck', 'howl-fest', 'Spanky', 'misadventures', 'kiddie', 'talent', 'show', 'Look', 'Alfalfa', 'debut', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Five', 'cabin', 'Kids', 'talented', 'group', 'Black', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'quite', 'popular', 'time', 'Check', 'kiddie', 'imitation', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Then', 'Kid', 'From', 'Borneo', 'One', 'less', 'politically', 'correct', 'Rascal', 'epics', 'modern', 'Black', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'story', 'children', 'encounter', 'Black', 'jungle', 'savage', 'Stymie', 'people', 'given', 'lines', 'referring', 'title', 'character', 'sissy', 'cannibal', 'gorilla', 'ape', 'However', 'have', 'moments', 'real', 'humor', 'great', 'chase', 'scenes', 'One', 'really', 'leave', 'brains', 'door', 'enjoy', 'one', 'remember', 'positive', 'racial', 'aspects', 'Rascals', 'far', 'outweigh', 'negative', 'given', 'times', 'were', 'made', 'Personally', 'reaction', 'film', 'veers', 'cringing', 'laughter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'worse.That', 'aside', 'transfers', 'vary', 'youmay', 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'brightness', 'tv', 'enjoy', 'set', 'overall', 'good', 'collection', 'especially', 'longtime', 'fans']",Our Gang - Little Rascals Greatest Hits

The darkness of the picture (sometimes) was another thing.  I don't know - maybe all the Little Rascal b&w; versions are like this.Also, seemed like there'd been cropping (?) - some of the letters in the opening titles, for example, are not visible.On the other hand, for the price you can't complain too much.  I don't know if these 6 shows are the ""best"" of the Little Rascals, or if they represent the same quality you'd find in larger collections, but it may be worth picking up something like this before spending more on a larger collection.
