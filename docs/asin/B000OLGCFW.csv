1064630,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000OLGCFW,Julie Neal,"[11, 12]","This is one of the best Little Einsteins DVDs yet for exposing kids to classical music. Twice as long as a regular television program, its 51-minute main feature, ""Rocket's Firebird Rescue,"" will really make children familiar with Igor Stravinsky's ""The Firebird.""Just about the perfect length for many youngsters' attention spans, the program tells the tale of the Firebird, a mythical crane that spreads music throughout Russia until a mean, magical ogre traps it. It also introduces kids to the painting ""Improvisation"" by Wassily Kandinsky, the amazing eggs of Carl Faberge, Russian nesting dolls, even St. Basil's Cathedral and the Baikal freshwater seal.It's even better if you view it with a home theater set-up, as the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack includes the kids' ""Rocket"" flying machine zooming around you as it travels.The DVD also contains a regular episode of the Little Einsteins television series, 2007's ""Rocket Soup,"" in which the kids fill up their transporter with its favorite food, a mix of cheese, peas, and jumping beans. It features Antonin Dvorak's catchy ""Humoresque No. 7"" (you'll know it when you hear it) and the painting ""Moonrise"" by Paul Klee.There is just one bonus feature, ""Magic Mission,"" which plays the main feature with ""hidden"" pop-up cards. When selected with a remote, each leads to an animated fun fact.",5,One of the best Little Einsteins,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1348,"['one', 'best', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'exposing', 'kids', 'classical', 'music', 'Twice', 'as', 'long', 'regular', 'television', 'program', '51-minute', 'main', 'feature', 'Rocket', 'Firebird', 'Rescue', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'children', 'familiar', 'Igor', 'Stravinsky', 'Firebird', 'Just', 'perfect', 'length', 'many', 'youngsters', 'attention', 'spans', 'program', 'tale', 'Firebird', 'mythical', 'crane', 'music', 'Russia', 'mean', 'magical', 'ogre', 'traps', 'also', 'kids', 'painting', 'Improvisation', 'Wassily', 'Kandinsky', 'amazing', 'eggs', 'Carl', 'Faberge', 'Russian', 'nesting', 'dolls', 'even', 'St', 'Basil', 'Cathedral', 'Baikal', 'freshwater', 'seal.It', 'even', 'better', 'view', 'home', 'theater', 'set-up', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'kids', 'Rocket', 'flying', 'machine', 'zooming', 'around', 'DVD', 'also', 'regular', 'episode', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'television', 'series', '2007', 'Rocket', 'Soup', 'kids', 'fill', 'up', 'transporter', 'favorite', 'food', 'mix', 'cheese', 'peas', 'jumping', 'beans', 'Antonin', 'Dvorak', 'catchy', 'Humoresque', 'No', '7', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'painting', 'Moonrise', 'Paul', 'Klee.There', 'just', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Magic', 'Mission', 'main', 'feature', 'hidden', 'pop-up', 'cards', 'When', 'selected', 'remote', 'animated', 'fun', 'fact']",Disney's Little Einsteins - Rocket's Firebird Rescue

He loves the music and the way they present the learning part of it. I like it because it's not some dumb cartoon that is a waste of time, and there are a lot of them out there.
