Carroll,"[2, 3]","In short the movie center around a young bircial misfit who comes from a dysfunctional household and decides to get a little gritty right right before her alchoholic dad begins to clean his act up. As far as characters: The mom seems like she was either sick or recovering from drugs in the beginning(staring into space, walking out the house in a trance leaving food on the stove),older- protective sister( who seems like she must've been more of a daddy's girl before the drinks him took over) runs away with boyfriend and returns with a baby. A neighbor who's also a hustler looks out for her and puts her on to the game. A big bully and her two henchmen, the two henchmen end up becoming the main characters sidekicks, a concerned school counselor with his own skeletons in the closet. I just want to say that her selling the drugs is not the main focus in this movie, the main thing seems to be her struggle with understanding who she really is inside and all the factors that have gotten her to this point. Just a few key points to get you interested, no spoilers but overall the movie was very good: Topics that have been covered in film but not in this way, and definitely not with such flawed yet lovable characters. There's so many layers. You feel like you know these people in the end and you want to see what's going to happen next in their lives.

1606985,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00A92MEJ4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 4]","There is a rawness to the film ""Yelling To The Sky"" that is likely to evoke strong reactions with most viewers.  At times humorous, at times brutal, this coming-of-age story from writer/director Victoria Mahoney has a palpable anger underneath its surface that really sets it apart from many comparable films.  While I don't know enough about Mahoney to label this autobiographical in nature, there is a certain intimacy and truthfulness that make it feel like a cathartic self-examination of a life lived.  While I appreciated this spirit, however, the overall experience ended up having less impact for me than individual components of the film.  For my taste, some of the characterizations lacked definition.  A drama about race, abuse, violence, and family dysfunction, ""Yelling To The Sky"" can be unrepentantly bleak.  And as the central character spiraled out of control, I found myself as an outsider looking in on (and sometimes not believing) the harrowing circumstances before her.The film opens with a brutal neighborhood attack as everyone seems aligned against Sweetness (Zoe Kravitz) and her friend, apparently because Sweetness comes from a mixed-race parentage.  You don't get much explanation, really, but as the conflict is resolved--the film unleashes a powerfully visceral punch to your gut.  From here, we get glimpses of Kravitz's home life.  Her mother seems unstable, her father volatile, and her sister is in a troubled relationship.  The screenplay never digs too deeply into the peripheral characters, we primarily see their actions through Kravitz's eyes.  As she wants to fit in, poor choices and bad opportunities take her down an unpleasant road.  Kravitz, thoroughly convincing as a girl becoming disconnected from her surroundings, isn't always as compelling as the troublemaker engaged in drugs, fighting, and other illicit behavior.  A particularly unfortunate subplot involves Tim Blake Nelson as a caring teacher that she'll see in a new light.  Just as all hope seems lost, though, the picture wants to affirm second chances.  But it does so by redeeming certain characters that we didn't know enough about in the first place.As a character study, I wanted a greater closeness and understanding of Sweetness and what went on in her mind.  As a dramatic narrative, I wanted more information about the other major characters.  Jason Clarke, as the father, has a great presence but I never knew who he was in any tangible way.  Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) is relatively one-note in her performance as a bully who becomes a focal point of a vicious revenge plot.  I did, however, love Antonique Smith as Kravitz's sister.  She really captures the screen and I definitely wanted to follow her as she disappeared for large chunks of the movie.  In the end, ""Yelling To The Sky"" is a well-intentioned movie that will likely connect with some.  Mahoney has talent, some scenes are incredibly memorable.  But, for me, the movie is a little muddled in its viewpoint.  I felt that it should have shaken me to the core with its powerful story, but I remained remote as the picture never drew me into Sweetness' psyche.

Her father is Irish and her mother is African American. She is not well accepted by the people in her rough neighborhood. She starts looking outside her home for a father figure and for friends and affection in general. When the person she considered friend and father figure gets killed in front of her, she realizes that if she doesn't changes her life-style and her friends, she is either going to die, or end-up in prison. She then correctly makes the decision to take her life in her own hands. It appears that the script is based on a true story.This is a great subject that has great potential. In addition, the director Victoria Mahoney, appears very gifted and talented. But we have the impression that somebody rushed the movie. We have the impression that they run out of money and that they had to finish quickly. The characters are not well developed and we don't understand well the tension in Zo's house. We need to know more about the Irish father and his brother and about the mother who appears to be constantly depressed. I wish the director would have watched some of the movies made by Claude Chabrol, and in particular ""Le Boucher"" or ""Inspector Bellamy"". There are two major things in a movie: the characters and the story. Once the director has a good story then he/she needs to develop the characters in order for us the spectators to better understand the script and the subplots. The film ""Le Boucher"" is about 90 min long and for the first 60-70 minutes we have the impression that it is a love story because of character development by Chabrol. At the very end of the movie we just realize that was the story of a serial killer who was involved with one his potential victims. ""Inspector Bellamy"" is more of the same. We spend so much time around the inspector, his brother, his wife and the primary suspect of the crime that we forget that there was a crime and somebody really died of horrific death.I think that this movie lacks character development. The mother, the father, the sister, and the drug addict/dealer high school teacher are major participants in the plot and we don't know why and how they got there. In addition, her drug dealer friend appears to give money and food to the family. Is he doing this for all families in the projects or just hers? What are his criteria? Why is he doing it?Three stars for a good story with good acting but with unfinished business.",3,Unfinished movie!,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2647,"['subject', 'huge', 'potential', 'director', 'who', 'very', 'capable', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'Claude', 'Chabrol.Sweetness', ""O'Hara"", 'Zo', 'Kravitz', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'mixed', 'parents', 'who', 'projects', 'father', 'Irish', 'mother', 'African', 'American', 'not', 'well', 'accepted', 'people', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'looking', 'home', 'father', 'figure', 'friends', 'affection', 'general', 'When', 'person', 'considered', 'friend', 'father', 'figure', 'killed', 'front', 'her', ""n't"", 'changes', 'life-style', 'friends', 'either', 'going', 'die', 'end-up', 'prison', 'then', 'correctly', 'decision', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'hands', 'script', 'based', 'true', 'story.This', 'great', 'subject', 'great', 'potential', 'addition', 'director', 'Victoria', 'Mahoney', 'very', 'gifted', 'talented', 'have', 'impression', 'somebody', 'rushed', 'movie', 'have', 'impression', 'run', 'money', 'had', 'finish', 'quickly', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'well', 'tension', 'Zo', 'house', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'Irish', 'father', 'brother', 'mother', 'who', 'be', 'constantly', 'depressed', 'wish', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'movies', 'made', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'particular', 'Le', 'Boucher', 'Inspector', 'Bellamy', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'things', 'movie', 'characters', 'story', 'director', 'good', 'story', 'then', 'needs', 'develop', 'characters', 'order', 'spectators', 'better', 'understand', 'script', 'subplots', 'film', 'Le', 'Boucher', '90', 'min', 'long', 'first', '60-70', 'minutes', 'have', 'impression', 'love', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'Chabrol', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'realize', 'was', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'one', 'potential', 'victims', 'Inspector', 'Bellamy', 'more', 'same', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'inspector', 'brother', 'wife', 'primary', 'suspect', 'crime', 'forget', 'was', 'crime', 'somebody', 'really', 'died', 'horrific', 'death.I', 'think', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'mother', 'father', 'sister', 'drug', 'addict/dealer', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'are', 'major', 'participants', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'addition', 'drug', 'dealer', 'friend', 'give', 'money', 'food', 'family', 'doing', 'families', 'projects', 'just', 'hers', 'What', 'are', 'criteria', 'Why', 'doing', 'Three', 'stars', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'unfinished', 'business']",N/A
