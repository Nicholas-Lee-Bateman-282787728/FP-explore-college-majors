I really didn't mind.  The only part I found painful was when Danny Zuko blew off his  pretty Australian girlfriend in front of his friends.  Her name was Sandy,  right?  But wasn't that the name of the dog in Annie, another of my  daughter's favorites?  I'm getting confused.  After 8 million viewings of  Annie followed by another 8 million of Grease I think it's all starting to  blend together.  And every damn time, Danny Zuko would cave in to male peer  pressure and act like a phony to Olivia Newton-John.

I can't tell you how many times in 26 years I saw this film. The first two times I saw it were in 1978,the year it was released. I was obsessed with this film then(I was then 6,nearly 7 years old). I went through 2 LP copies of the soundtrack and don't have either one anymore. A female friend and I would pretend to be Sandy Dombrowski and Danny Zuko,the star characters respectively portrayed by Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. This film was based on the broadway play of the same title. The play debuted in 1972 and the film was made 5 years later. In the film,set in 1959,Sandy and Danny began their romance before returning for their senior year at Rydell High School. Sandy tells her girlfriends and Danny tells his buddies in song,entitled SUMMER NIGHTS. Sandy and her girlfriends are the Pink Ladies and Danny and his buddies are the T-Birds. Memorable scenes include Danny and Sandy at a drive-in theater,newly reconciled and temporarily parted due to an argument(Travolta sings SANDY). Also Danny and Cha-Cha(sexy and beautiful Annette Charles Cardona) strutting their stuff at a dance in the school gymnasium(that made Sandy jealous). Sha-Na-Na as Johnny Casino & The Gamblers performing at the dance. Frenchy(Didi Conn) being visited by a guardian angel(Frankie Avalon singing BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT). Danny and Kenickie(pre-Taxi Jeff Conaway) racing in their cars. And of course,the Rydell High seniors singing WE GO TOGETHER at the carnival in the last scene. The late Eve Arden is the Rydell High principal,Sid Caesar is the phys. ed. instructor and Stockard Channing is Rizzo,Kenickie's girlfriend. This was one of '78's biggest films. Another film with a pop music soundtrack released the same year was AMERICAN HOT WAX which was a disappointment. This film was a hit largely because Travolta was still a teen idol and ONJ was a big-selling music artist. Travolta had a prior hit,SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER which grossed just as much as this film. Travolta's ABC sitcom Welcome Back,Kotter was still on the air at the time of filming but his role of Vinnie Barbarino was greatly reduced. After SNF,he wanted to focus on his film career. ONJ later starred in 1980's XANADU,a musical also. Travolta and ONJ re-teamed for 1983's TWO OF A KIND which flopped. Director Randal Kleiser subequently directed 1980's THE BLUE LAGOON starring Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.

This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. This homage to the 50s (homage, not representation) follows the lives of Sandy and Danny during a year at the fictional Rydell High. They fell in love over the summer, and now find themselves in the same high school. Can they overcome the roles they adopt to save their love?Even though there's a distinct 70s charm to the movie, you truly believe in the 50s atmosphere it has. That it's 1950s USA, and no other place or time. The plot of the film may not have that much going for it in the originality department but it's the personality about the movie that makes it such a joy to watch every time.Indeed, if you're looking for morals, well, you're not gonna find them here. Most of the characters are one-dimensional and many are often than not quite unlikeable (take all the T-Birds). The moral of the movie is quite bad as well; give in to peer pressure and you'll win the man of your dreams. Sandy, girl, you were fine just the way you were. True, she chose to undergo her makeover on her own accord, but all the same, it implies that being innocent and upright is a no-no. My favourite character is Rizzo, the most three-dimensional of the bunch. She acts tough on the outside, but has a tangible vulnerability that she tries to hide. ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" reveals her character in a way that her interaction with her friends doesn't show; she almost upstages Newton-John with this riveting number.Of course, none of this would matter without the music! This is what makes the film so much fun. This movie is chock-full of songs that you just want to get up and dance to, feel sad to, reflect to. Mostly get up and dance to, though. One of my favourite scenes is the dance in the high school gym; a more fun dance extravaganza has hardly ever been caught on film. Just try and sit still when watching. You just want to enter the screen and join in. It's incredible.Okay, it has a pretty bad moral. Yes, the characters don't remotely look like they are really teenagers.

It was already a period piece when it came out in the late 1970's, and watching it again made me realize how much the life of young people in the United States has changed, and yes, still stayed the same. Based on the hit Broadway musical of the same name, Grease is the story of a group of teenaged friends during their senior year at a California high school; girls yearn after boys, boys look their coolest best to impress the girls, hot rods are super fast (kinda) and there's plenty of jitterbug dancing and rock 'n roll music to fuel it along. Sandy and Danny meet during the summer, part company then find out she's transferred to his school. Shall he admit his love or impress the guys with his machoness? Kinnikie and Rizzo have a hot date ""parking"". Is she pregnant? The whole school thinks so the next day. Frenchie drops out of school to be a beautician. Is it the right move? The rival gang challenges our heros to a race for ""pinks"". (If you've seen the Fast and Furious movies you know what that is, but I bet some of you didn't know that practice was so OLD.) Can this stuff possibly be entertaining? YES. It's not the situations but the carefree, fun cast that make this movie fun to watch, and turned it into a classic. John Travolta as Danny is young, sexy, and can he dance. He's a fine actor, and plays the role with just the right tounge-in-cheek seriousness. Olivia Newton-John is beautiful as Sandy, and what a set of pipes. The hit ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" was written expecially for her to perform in this film, it was not part of the Broadway score. Also written just for her was the great finisher, ""You're The One That I Want"". I've seen the original Broadway musical and there was a lot more great rock 'n roll sounding songs and more dance numbers, but the humor and personality of the characters make this film move.

127044,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,0792148061,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[6, 6]","Grease is an interesting thing. It's one of those movies that stays with you and goes wherever you go. Watching it again or hearing any of the songs on the radio is like opening up your own high school yearbook. A trip back through time. A reunion with friends you feel like you know, or could have known. It's a special thing indeed. The movie, as I'm sure everyone knows, was based on a musical. It was made into this film and was released in 1978. The movie became the highest grossing musical in box office history. Rightfully so. The movies takes place in California in the 1950's. Just as Amazon said, this nostalgia was running rampant in the 1970's. We first meet Danny Zuko and Sandy(John Travolta and Olivia Newton - John) having a romantic time on the beach. It all seemed so perfect. We jump right to the beginning of a new school year. Students are coming to Rydell High for the first day of school. Young, beautiful Sandy is coming for the first time. She immediatley meets and befriends pink haired Frenchie(Didi Conn), and her clique of friends known as the Pink Ladies, headed by Rizzo(Stockard Channing). Rizzo is a tough, feisty thing, and Channing gives the role her all in a great and memorable performance. Sandy runs into her summer love, Danny. Danny is the leader of the cool gang in school known as The T Birds. The rest of the movie is pretty much the love and attraction between the two and how Danny tries to regain his cool and not seem like a whipped, lovestruck little puppy. What makes the movie great and undeniably cool and enjoyable is how it is shamelessly great, cool, and enjoyable. Does that make any sense?. It's a bright, colorful, popcorn movie that wants nothing but to be a good, fun movie. It achieves that goal on every level. While the movie is looked on quite fondly by people and lots of younger kids as a nice movie, you really have to look deeper and pay more attention to certain dialogue and lyrics to see how the movie was actually kinda nasty in some ways. I'm sure there are things that would get edited out if I printed them, so I won't. Be on the lookout if you haven't noticed it already. The supporting cast is chock full of memorable faces. Comedy legend Sid Caesar is the gym teacher; Eve Arden is the principal; Lorenzo Lamas is the jock; Eternal nerd Eddie Deezen as, well, the nerd. And, of course, the cameo by Frankie Avalon. The music. I've saved the best for last. The music in this film is pure kitsch, but a lot of it is actually solid songs. With a movie this campy and fun, you can't really expect the songs to be different. It's just that kind of a movie. Olivia Newton - John could sing from the telephone book and I wouldn't care. She has such a lovely, warm, and beautiful voice, she make anything sound good. Who can deny the pleasures of ""Greased Lightning"", ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Your The One That I Want"", ""Summer Lovin"", and, of course, ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee""?. Pure pop done at it's very best. The writing is corny and sometimes cheesey, but guess what?. That's the movie. That's the era it's in. It isn't meant to be anything else. It is what it is supposed to be, and does it very well. The actors are all great. All well suited for their roles. Was John Travolta any cooler?. Olivia is a sight of pure loveliness. If you ask me, she looks even better today at the age of 54. Just gets better with age. Grease isn't a film that is going to be seen as Oscar material(the songs yes), and it wasn't meant to be. It has survived for the last 24 years because it's a good movie that can reach anyone in any age group or race. It's a film that takes place in a certain time, but the legacy will live on for all times.

How sad.  Now, this can probably be explained away in many ways, but I know that my surround system is fine and my DVD player is working great so you can elminate those options.  I have DVDs of foreign B-horror movies that sound better than this.  Could it be the disc? Maybe?  But I've never bought one yet with this problem and I have 280.  Could it be Paramount yet again doing a lack luster job in their production.  They've put so many of their movies out on DVD that aren't 5.1, maybe they really don't know how to encode their films into 5.1 or don't care if they do it properly.  There could be many reasons why this happened, but it is a sight for sore eyes to see Grease with a least a decent anamorphic transfer and on a disc that I won't wear out from too many viewings.

I don't believe there is any other film in history that has matched Grease's ability to mess around with its audience's expectations and perceptions.  So many people finish watching this film feeling like they have just gone through a very cheerful and life-affirming experience.  But look at the film's actual plots!1. (The main storyline): Olivia Newton John learns that in order to become popular in highschool and win back the love of the man she had a summer fling with, she must make it obvious to the whole school that she is willing to put out.  Until she does this, John Travolta risks being ostracized and ridiculed by his male friends for dating a woman for purely emotional reasons. Since Travolta is the one that she wants, O.N.J. decides she must cater to his needs and very publically presents herself in her new role as a leather-clad boytoy at a fair (I still can't decide if this storyline is more insulting to males or females); and2. (the main subplot) A girl who gets pregnant because she has unprotected sex in the back seat of a car with one of Travolta's friends (she apparently learned earlier than O.N.J. how to be popular) has to choose between dropping out of school and getting a job (by way of graduating beauty school) so she can take care of her baby, or, alternatively, have an abortion so she can return to highschool.  Meanwhile, the boyfriend who dumped her after she got pregnant is one of guys accusing Travolta of a lapse in judgement for falling in love with O.N.J.Oh yeah.  And there's a dance contest!  (Perhaps if Scorcese had added a hand-jiving scene to ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" he could have avoided the whole controversy.)But because this extremely cynical story is set to catchy bubble-gum music and is filled with colourful images of a 1950s America that has never existed anywhere outside of theme diners of the 1980s, almost everyone misses the point! As a result, this film is widely loved, even by people who would ordinarily refuse to consider going to a depressing, sexist or ""morally questionable"" movie.  Which all goes to prove that in order to have a hit movie, sometimes all that is necessary is an easily forgettable plot wrapped up in distracting spectacle!However, as cynical and unrealistic as Grease may be, it is a fun exploitation film.

There's something about the way that people are just standing there talking and  then all of a sudden break into song.  It's laughable under most  circumstances.

127064,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0792148061,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I saw Gabe Kaplan about 10 years ago in a comedy club in Seattle; I believe that it was ""Giggles.""  I think at the time, he was on sabbatical from playing professional poker or something.  But during his act, from what I remember, he hinted that he wasn't the biggest fan of John Travolta.  At the time I was somewhat surprised, but thinking about it, it shouldn't have been too surprising, really, as the two were co-stars in ""Welcome Back Kotter"" at the time.""Saturday Night Fever"" released, making Mr. Travolta a mega-star.  But then, just within the next year or two, ""Grease"" released, and it could only have compounded his stardom.  He was very young, probably in his early-to-mid 20s at that time, and surely while he was more than excited about it, more than likely it gave him a big ego.  (That was what Mr. Kaplan seemed to allude to in his act.)  Hey, it probably happens to anyone at that age that has that level of success, so quickly.  But then of course, ""Urban Cowboy"" released later, and that was a really entertaining film as well.  More success, more than likely.I've been hit-and-miss on Mr. Travolta over the years; I think a lot of the movies that he's made over the last decade have been more than forgettable.  But he sure had magic when he was young, and in ""Grease,"" I actually think that he out sang Olivia Newton John a bit, and she was a very nice singer.  He just had that edge that you're looking for, especially for the 50s genre, and his falsetto on a couple of tunes was fantastic.  And of course, he's always been a very nice actor as well.  But overall, he's probably the most talented as a dancer.  Seems like he's a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some.I finally watched this movie last night in HD 16 x 9, in it's unedited entirety.  Free HBO will do that for you.  And while this film is surely not perfect, it is perfectly fun, kind of like the film ""Abba"" in a way but surely better.  This is the only way to watch this film.  I saw a bit on ""Siskel and Ebert"" a long time ago where they were discussing cropping in film, showing what happens -- in a negative way -- when film is cropped from 16 x 9 to 4 x 3 for TV (they don't do this much anymore with the advent of HD, thank God).  But I was reminded of that episode while watching; catch a couple of scenes where you know if it were cropped it just wouldn't work as the background characters would be gone, and their expressions would be missed.To Mr. Kaplan I say, ""If I read what you meant correctly, I can understand it.""  But to Mr. Travolta I say, ""If you did have a big ego, I can understand it.""

This anniversary edition DVD is great because of the cast interviews AND there is even a little song book included so you can sing along to some of the best music that will bring back the feeling of the 50s and early 60s.It is a little hard to believe that it's been more than 20 years since it first came out until you look at the actors! Travolta and Newton-John look SO YOUNG! But this movie still gets to me every time I watch it. There are great songs (Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights, You're the One that I Want) and memorable performances (Stockard Channing as Rizzo is a classic!).The story brings back a time when teens were ""boys and girls"", not very sophisticated in the ways of the big bad world. It evokes a little bit of the feel of my teen years and those are the clothes (poodle skirts, petticoats, bobby socks and saddle shoes) that I remember. Sure, sexuality simmered just under the surface, but there were more 'Sandra Dees' than there were 'Cha Chas' and the Rebels didn't run the schools and dictate the tastelessness that seems to rule today. Underwear was worn under outerwear and the most anyone saw was a droopy bra strap.The story is sweet, simple and classical. Boy meets Girl, they fall in love, there is a bumpy patch and then Everyone lives happily ever after. In ""Grease"" getting to The End is lots of fun!

It was the largest running musical in theatre history and the film was closely based on the 1972 musical play.  The film featured a '50s theme, cashing in on the nostalgia craze that was going on at that time, containing the fashions, the music and the fads of that era plus [desire] overtones expressed by the teenagers.The story revolves around the seniors of Rydell High School and tells of their boy-girl problems, their lack of interest in School, the importance of having a fast car, the loud chaos of dances, pep rallies and the end of the year carnival.  This film really gave me a false perception of what high school should be.  It shows high school to be fun and games and glamorous.  I was disappointed when I began attending high school and realized that it was not was it was like in the movies. :)Produced by Robert Stigwood (of Saturday Night Fever, Tommy and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band fame) the film featured humorous songs ('Beauty School Dropout'), '50s era inspired music ('Born to Hand Jive'), and songs that were also popular during that era ('Hound Dog' and 'Blue Moon').  Some songs had also been featured in the Broadway musical ('Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Summer Nights') and some were written specifically for his movie ('Grease' and 'Hopelessly Devoted to You')...There are two highpoints in the film.  The first once occurs at midpoint in the movie, when Rydell High is featured on National Bandstand and the whole school is dancing to 'Rock and Roll is Here to Stay' and 'Born to Hand Jive.'  The other is when the end of the school year carnival occurs where everybody sings and dances to 'We Go Together.'  These two scenes feature large production numbers involving the entire cast and solo dancing featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John...While watching Grease, I found the film to be lively and uplifting that helped people relive the '50s all over again and those who never lived in the '50s wished they had.  Photography, editing and the ages of the cast was completely overlooked once I became engrossed in the plot and the music.The film was a hit not because the film company said it was good.  It was a hit because it appealed to the public, adults and teens and it was a timeless film that will be enjoyed by the public for years to come.",5,Hopelessly Devoted to this movie!,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,2406,"['Grease', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'saw', 'more', 'once', 'theatre', '6', 'times', 'be', 'exact', '1978', 'was', 'largest', 'running', 'musical', 'theatre', 'history', 'film', 'was', 'closely', 'based', '1972', 'musical', 'play', 'film', 'featured', ""'50s"", 'theme', 'cashing', 'nostalgia', 'craze', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'containing', 'fashions', 'music', 'fads', 'era', '[', 'desire', ']', 'overtones', 'expressed', 'teenagers.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'seniors', 'Rydell', 'High', 'School', 'tells', 'boy-girl', 'problems', 'lack', 'interest', 'School', 'importance', 'having', 'fast', 'car', 'loud', 'chaos', 'dances', 'pep', 'rallies', 'end', 'year', 'carnival', 'film', 'really', 'gave', 'false', 'perception', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'be', 'fun', 'games', 'glamorous', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'began', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'was', 'movies', 'Produced', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Tommy', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'Club', 'Band', 'fame', 'film', 'featured', 'humorous', 'songs', ""'Beauty"", 'School', 'Dropout', 'era', 'inspired', 'music', ""'Born"", 'Hand', 'Jive', 'songs', 'were', 'also', 'popular', 'era', 'Dog', ""'Blue"", 'Moon', 'songs', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'featured', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Me', ""'m"", 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Nights', 'were', 'written', 'specifically', 'movie', ""'Hopelessly"", 'Devoted', 'are', 'two', 'highpoints', 'film', 'first', 'once', 'midpoint', 'movie', 'when', 'Rydell', 'High', 'featured', 'National', 'Bandstand', 'whole', 'school', 'dancing', ""'Rock"", 'Roll', 'Here', 'Stay', ""'Born"", 'Hand', 'Jive', 'other', 'when', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'carnival', 'where', 'everybody', 'sings', 'dances', ""'We"", 'Go', 'Together', 'two', 'scenes', 'feature', 'large', 'production', 'numbers', 'involving', 'entire', 'cast', 'solo', 'dancing', 'featuring', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'watching', 'Grease', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'lively', 'uplifting', 'helped', 'people', 'relive', ""'50s"", 'over', 'again', 'who', 'never', 'lived', ""'50s"", 'wished', 'had', 'Photography', 'editing', 'ages', 'cast', 'was', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'once', 'became', 'engrossed', 'plot', 'music.The', 'film', 'was', 'hit', 'not', 'film', 'company', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'hit', 'appealed', 'public', 'adults', 'teens', 'was', 'timeless', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'public', 'years', 'come']",N/A

And what irony too, because Grease itself is about a bygone era! I mean is it just me people?! As for the film, nearly all of the music numbers are top-notch, the story is thin but fun enough --my only complaint is that after the dance-a-thon it derails.

127096,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0792148061,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 5]","I went to see the 20th anniversary of Grease when it hit the theatres.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, love at first sight!  OK, confession time:  it was also the first time I'd seen it.  Yes, a Gen-X'er like me not seeing Grease is like a Gen-Y'er not seeing American Pie.  However, blame my parents for banning much popular culture during my formative years.The opening scenes of Danny and Sandy carousing and clowning around on the beach ends appropriately, when Danny tells Sandy, ""Of course not, it's only the beginning,"" and then come those crazy animated credits and Frankie Valli singing the immortal title track.There's Danny Zucco and the T-Birds, his inseparable best friend Kenickie, and the ""three stooges,"" Sonny, Doody, and Putzie.  Sandy is befriended by Frenchie, whose compatriots, the Pink Ladies, are Marty, Jan, and the sarcastic Rizzo.  Basically, we see this story from their point of view.  After all, they are the more interesting characters and make no effort to conform, remaining in their clique groups.It's more than just Danny and Sandy finding each other's true selves at school, but that of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies, who discover that things aren't always cut in black and white, but have a way of working out in the end.  All the actors make their characters come alive, love or not love them so much.  And everyone has a favorite few characters that they grow up liking with each viewing.  Mine are Danny, Sandy, Coach Calhoun, and Frenchie.What are the highlights and familiar scenes at high school?  Bonfire night, going to Lover's Lane, hanging out at the diner, the big dance, the drive-in, graduation carnival, it's all here, a 1950's time capsule that was made in 1978. Well, some of these might be passe, but of the traditions that still exist, I was alienated in all these things during my three year sentence.  Maybe because this movie makes it so ideal and magical, and that it's set in 1959.Of the adults, hats off to Eve Arden, the strict but benevolent school principle, except she plays Miss McGee, not Miss Brooks.  And Sid Caesar makes Coach Calhoun a really well-rounded character--patient, kind, helpful, and full of spirit.One interesting subliminal message I noticed from go was the animated cartoons playing at the drive-in screen while Danny is singing ""Sandy.""  As he's winding up his song, notice the antics of the hot dog and the hot dog bun.Outdated themes:  the 50's cars, gas guzzlers and now a threat to the environment, the fashions of course, but also actors in their mid-to-late twenties playing high schoolers.  Heck, Stockard Channing (Rizzo) was in her thirties in 1978!There's magic in this movie as well.  As soon as Frenchy wishes she had a guardian angel a la Tammy And The Bachelor, Frankie Avalon appears and the Frosty Palace comes lit with the ""Beauty School Dropout"" number.  And the ""Greased Lightning"" fantasy number, where Kenickie's beat-up car is transformed into a hot rod with slick paint job, chrome wheels, white-wall tires, and, the most important item of all (ha ha), furry dice, shows Travolta really enjoying himself.Of the musical numbers, ""Summer Nights,"" ""Greased Lightning,"" all of the prom songs, and the celebratory ""We Go Together"" are unforgettable wonders, but the cherry on the icing is the ""Born To Hand Jive"" number, where the dance floor comes alive, topping the ""Rock 'N' Roll Is Here To Stay"" number in energy.This is definitely the last great musical to come out of Hollywood, and remember, Grease is STILL the word!",5,Grease is STILL the word!,1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,3520,"['went', 'see', '20th', 'anniversary', 'Grease', 'when', 'hit', 'theatres', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'OK', 'confession', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Yes', ""Gen-X'er"", 'not', 'seeing', 'Grease', ""Gen-Y'er"", 'not', 'seeing', 'American', 'Pie', 'However', 'blame', 'parents', 'banning', 'much', 'popular', 'culture', 'formative', 'years.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Danny', 'Sandy', 'carousing', 'clowning', 'around', 'beach', 'appropriately', 'when', 'Danny', 'Sandy', 'course', 'not', 'only', 'beginning', 'then', 'come', 'crazy', 'animated', 'credits', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'singing', 'immortal', 'title', 'Danny', 'Zucco', 'T-Birds', 'inseparable', 'best', 'friend', 'Kenickie', 'three', 'stooges', 'Sonny', 'Doody', 'Putzie', 'Sandy', 'befriended', 'Frenchie', 'compatriots', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'are', 'Marty', 'Jan', 'sarcastic', 'Rizzo', 'Basically', 'see', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'make', 'effort', 'conform', 'remaining', 'clique', 'groups.It', 'more', 'just', 'Danny', 'Sandy', 'finding', 'other', 'true', 'selves', 'school', 'T-Birds', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'who', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'cut', 'black', 'white', 'have', 'way', 'working', 'out', 'end', 'actors', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'love', 'not', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'few', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'liking', 'viewing', 'Mine', 'are', 'Danny', 'Sandy', 'Coach', 'Calhoun', 'Frenchie.What', 'are', 'highlights', 'familiar', 'scenes', 'high', 'school', 'Bonfire', 'night', 'going', 'Lover', 'Lane', 'hanging', 'out', 'diner', 'big', 'dance', 'drive-in', 'graduation', 'carnival', 'here', '1950', 'time', 'capsule', 'was', 'made', '1978', 'Well', 'might', 'be', 'passe', 'traditions', 'still', 'exist', 'was', 'alienated', 'things', 'three', 'year', 'sentence', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'so', 'ideal', 'magical', 'set', '1959.Of', 'adults', 'hats', 'off', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'strict', 'benevolent', 'school', 'principle', 'Miss', 'McGee', 'not', 'Miss', 'Brooks', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'Coach', 'Calhoun', 'really', 'well-rounded', 'character', 'patient', 'kind', 'helpful', 'full', 'spirit.One', 'interesting', 'subliminal', 'message', 'noticed', 'go', 'was', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'playing', 'drive-in', 'screen', 'Danny', 'singing', 'Sandy', 'winding', 'up', 'song', 'notice', 'antics', 'hot', 'dog', 'hot', 'dog', 'bun.Outdated', 'themes', '50', 'cars', 'gas', 'guzzlers', 'now', 'threat', 'environment', 'fashions', 'course', 'also', 'actors', 'mid-to-late', 'twenties', 'playing', 'high', 'schoolers', 'Heck', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Rizzo', 'was', 'thirties', '1978', 'magic', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'soon', 'Frenchy', 'had', 'guardian', 'angel', 'la', 'Tammy', 'Bachelor', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'Frosty', 'Palace', 'lit', 'Beauty', 'School', 'Dropout', 'number', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'fantasy', 'number', 'where', 'Kenickie', 'beat-up', 'car', 'transformed', 'hot', 'rod', 'slick', 'paint', 'job', 'chrome', 'wheels', 'white-wall', 'tires', 'most', 'important', 'item', 'ha', 'ha', 'furry', 'dice', 'Travolta', 'really', 'enjoying', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'prom', 'songs', 'celebratory', 'Go', 'Together', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'wonders', 'cherry', 'icing', 'Born', 'Hand', 'Jive', 'number', 'where', 'dance', 'floor', 'alive', 'topping', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'Here', 'Stay', 'number', 'energy.This', 'definitely', 'last', 'great', 'musical', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'remember', 'Grease', 'STILL', 'word']",N/A

It sounds great, looks great, and IS just spectacular still 24 years later. My only problem with this release is a few special features. We get a featurette with most of the actors talking about the film and a trailer but that's about it. I was hoping for some deleted scenes or outtakes and a commentary.

And you are missing out on a really fun film.  That is the secret to this movie's popularity.  It's just plain fun!  It doesn't have a really great script, none of the performancies (with the exception of Stockard Channing) is anything above run-of-the-mill, but it's got a lot of great, catchy songs, a very likeable cast, and is just a treat to watch again and again.  I was disappointed by this DVD release though, because it's exactly the same as the laser disc, only smaller and you don't have to turn it over.  The cast interviews at the end are four years old, and this is really just a delayed release of the 20th Anniversary Edition on DVD.  And what fan of Grease needs a cheap, paper booklet of song lyrics?  Believe me, we know them all by heart.  Truly the most profitable and one of the most popular musicals ever made deserves a better DVD package.  The fans certainly deserve it too, having waited so long for this.  Boo! to Paramount for, apparently, wanting to wait and pick our pockets again some time down the road when they release the two-disc set with all the extras this movie should have.  At least it's in widescreen, which is a totally different viewing experience for anyone who hasn't seen it letterboxed or on the big screen yet.  The musical numbers have a much larger scope, with dancers and other action on the sides that had previously been cut off.  You will be surprised how many previously unseen guys are on the bleachers with Danny and the gang for ""Summer Nights"".  And to anyone who is planning to buy the full-frame DVD--shame on you!

127101,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0792148061,Deborah Earle,"[1, 2]","I well remember the publicity surrounding the premiere of this musical in 1978. As my parents thought I was too young to see it when it first debuted, I wouldn't see it in its entirety until three years after its release, but after I acquired a copy of the soundtrack, I became one of the cool kids at my Elementary School because I was one of two girls who could bring it to be played in my home room class just before the weekends---wonderful days!I also remember the commentary of a few classmates who did see it;namely, ""'Grease' was stupid!"" -- a sentiment I have come to appreciate as I got older because it advocates the idea that a nice girl should give in to the peer pressure of the less desireable element in order to keep her boyfriend.Still, it's never a dull flick to watch.On the 40th anniversary of the debut of the original(and reportedly racier) Broadway version of this story, I dedicate this editorial toast to Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey's and Bronte Woodward's highly significant pop cultural work, here directed by Randal Kleiser and  produced by Alan Carr.We follow young Australian student, Sandy Olsen ( Olivia-Newton John in her definitive role) and her romance with Danny Zuko( John Travolta) on the California Coast sometime in the late 50s. Amid strains of an instrumental version of ""Love is a Many-Splendored Thing"", we see two sweet teenagers frolic on the beach, and then lament Sandy's impending departure to her native Australia.Then, amid the dynamic contemporary sound of the title song, sung by Frankie Valli, and cute cartoon graphics that give viewers an edification of the trends of the 50s,the first day at Rydell High School begins, where we meet the principals in this drama, including tough but vulnerable Betty Rizzo(Stockard Channing), greasers Kenickie( Jeff Conaway), Doody, (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci), and Putzie(Kelly Ward),who comprise the T-Birds, and their female counterparts the Pink Ladies , including the amiable beauty-school student Frenchy (Didi Conn),big-haired Marty Maraschino(Dinah Manoff), and Jan ( Jamie Donnelly).Principal McGee,( Eve Arden) proves herself perfectly capable of holding her own against the resident rowdies, although the nerdy Eugene Felnic(Eddie Deezen) has no such luck.McGee's secretary Blanche( Dody Goodman) has a few issues of incompetency,Alice Ghostley's Mrs. Murdock is the shop teacher with a pivotal role in the story.As Sandy befriends Frenchy and the other girls, Danny's High School alter ego-- a leather jacket-wearing cigarette smoking gang member is revealed.Susan Buckner's high achiever, Patty Simcox proves to be an annoyance for the Pink Ladies during lunch hour, but she invites Sandy to join the cheerleading squad and  Sandy and Danny give differing versions of their summer romance in the song ""Summer Nights"".At an evening bonfire and pep rally, Principal McGee and Coach Calhoun(Sid Caesar) give comically pathetic speeches in an attempt to rally the football players to a long-elusive victory.Aware of the truth about Danny after Sandy reveals the name of her summer paramour, The Pink Ladies reunite her with Danny, who in the company of his gang members has to remain cool and aloof in front of a ""chick"" and therefore represses his excitement at their unexpected reunion, hurting Sandy.A sleepover at Frenchy's house reveals Rizzo's obvious resentment for the well-brought-up Sandy after Frenchy botches her attempt to pierce Sandy's ears.But Marty tries unsuccessfully to help Sandy overcome her heartache by writing to any of her varied swains in other places.The song ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" expresses Sandy's feelings.Rizzo gets bored and leaves the slumber party to go off with they guys when they show up. Tensions increase when Kenickie kicks the others out of his car to be alone with Rizzo, but that encounter will have potentially  dire consequences for Rizzo later on.Sandy starts dating football player Tom Chisolm(Lorenzo Lamas, portraying life in the decade in which his parents were at the height of their fame), and at the local malt shop where screen veteran Joan Blondell as waitress, Vi, serves up the shakes and presides over a thousand adolescent dramas,Danny apologizes to Sandy for his previous behavior, but when he criticizes the accomplished athlete she is dating, she challenges him to see how well he'd fare as an athlete, a challenge Danny accepts.In the meantime Frenchy fails beauty school, ending up with pink hair due to a tinting class snafu. Vi is ill prepared to advise her on what to do next. Frankie Avalon's Teen Angel steps in to do that the in number, ""Beauty School Drop-Out"".Coach Calhoun presides over a comical episode in which Danny tries to find a suitable sport to impress Sandy, but his streetwise persona hinders his ability to get along with others in contact sports.So he ends up as a cross country runner.The story could have ended happily right there, with a street kid trying to be something more, but alas it doesn't.Amid a lively soundtrack, we follow the gang through the National Bandstand Dance, held in the school gym , and presided over by DJ Vince Fontaine( Ed Byrnes), who tries to seduce Marty. Johnny Casino and the Gamblers(Sha-Na-Na) perform as a fight between Kenickie and the leader of the Rival Gang The Scorprions, Crater Face(Dennis Stewart) breaks out on the dance floor as Rizzo, his disgusted date, leaves, the gang reunite Danny with former girlfriend Cha-Cha Di Gregorio( Annette Charles), and rig the dance contest so they end up together, pushing Sandy out of the way, and Putzi, Sonny, and Doody moon the camera on national televison, but manage to avoid trouble.During a night at the drive-in, Rizzo has a pregnancy scare that becomes the talk of the campus. Sandy's reunion with Danny is brief, due to his attempt to come on too strong, The era of guys trying to get reputations and girls trying not to makes itself felt in that scene.Overshadowing the greasers' lives is the upcoming auto race with the Scorpions. A calamity will alter the course of that event unexpectedly.The year-end school carnival is a joyous romp, with loose-ends tied up ,Sandy having made a crucial life decision(for which any girl's parents could disown her) two more great musical numbers, and  the glorious sense that youth may have that come what may they'd always be together.One can faintly hope that Sandy will somehow end up as a more positive influence on her greaser guy. But at least for the moment, they remain the coolest couple, and audiences will be satisfied with that.Whatever the future may hold, the youthful spirit of this story endures.",4,"Disquieting as Its

127103,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0792148061,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[77, 84]","""GREASE"" is the most successful movie musical ever created.  The 1978 film was based on a musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey and eventually caught the attention in the early 70's of producer Allan Carr who purchase the rights to adapt the play into a film.With the popularity of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" in 1977 which help boost the career of John Travolta, producer Robert Stigwood joined Allan Carr to create a film based on this play.  Tapping director Randal Kleiser who worked with Travolta in the popular 1976 TV film ""The Boy and his Bubble"", recruiting ""GREASE"" musical choreographer Patricia Birch and hiring Director of Photography Bill Butler (""Jaws"", ""Stripes"" and ""Rocky II & III"", etc.), this team would create a film that would become a musical ingrained into American pop culture.Despite no respect in supporting the film by the major film studios, ""GREASE"" would become the second highest grossing film in 1978 behind ""Superman"" bringing in $96 million in the box office, the ""GREASE"" soundtrack would achieve #1 status around the world during its release and the film received many award nominations.VIDEO & AUDIO:""GREASE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and I will tell you I was blown away by the picture quality.I've watched this film dozens of times, owned the VHS and both DVD versions and when I started watching the High Definition Blu-ray transfer, I was speechless.  The many colors featured in the film were quite vibrant.  This film is over 30-years-old and Paramount really did a great service in the transfer and remaster of this film.  Closeups, outdoor scenes, you name it, the film looks spectacular!I compared my 25th Anniversary DVD to this Blu-ray and just the opening sequence alone with the two at the beach, the colors are just absolutely stunning on Blu-ray.  I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looked in High Definition.  The DVD video quality just doesn't compare to the Blu-ray disc and I was quite impressed!As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and also in French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish mono.  Since music is a big part of the film, it was important for me to test this Blu-ray out on my system.  Where the 1977 film ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was just spectacular for its High Definition audio transfer, I was hoping to have an awesome lossless soundtrack for ""GREASE"".Somehow, in the beginning of the film, it seemed as if the audio coming from the center channel was a bit lower than my front speakers. So, dialogue seemed as if it was being overpowered by the music.  I've run a variety of tests and I did have to increase my center channel dB a little bit to compensate for the music coming louder but this may be due to my audio setup for my receiver.  But everything sounded well throughout the film after the adjustment.The dialogue was quite clear but the music really came alive and I did notice certain sounds utilizing my subwoofer during the car and music scenes.  But overall, the music does sound great and clear via Dolby TrueHD 5.1.SPECIAL FEATURES:""GREASE"" comes with a good number of special features.  Included on this Blu-ray disc are:* Commentary: Commentary by Director Randal Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch - This commentary is quite interesting as Kleiser talked more about the film side of ""GREASE"" while Patricia Birch talked about the choreography part of the film.  Both give really good insight of bringing the musical to film, talking about the things they had to accomplish and how Kleiser, Birch and DoP Butler really had to work closely with each other and the talent to make this film successful. You learn about the challenge of filming the National Bandstand segment, the finale during 102 degree weather and how Olivia Newton-John had to have her tight clothing sewn on and more.* Introduction by Randal Kleiser - A brief :24 second introduction to the special features.  Kleiser does several introductions throughout various features.* Rydell Sing-Along - This segment is for those who want to watch the musical parts from the film and on the bottom of the screen is a karaoke single along.* Featurette: The Time, The Place, The Motion: Remembering Grease - (22:27) This is the main featurette featuring interviews with the Director, producers, the cast sharing their memories of working on the film, working with John Travolta and more.

And many more interesting tidbits on the making of the film.* Additional Scenes: Deleted/Extended/Alternate Scenes with introduction by Randal Kleiser (intro :13 scenes 11:55 - TRT 12:08) - Randal Kleiser explains how footage was recently found in the Paramount vaults.

But I have to be truthful and say how much I was in awe to see the brilliant camerawork but to see how the choreography and just literally everything look quite smooth on film.And surprisingly watching this again 30-years-later and as the Director and even producers have said in the featurette, they were able to pull things off today that probably wouldn't happen now.  Quite a bit of sexual lingo but overall, the lyrics of the songs to the mannerisms of the characters is what made things look genuine.It's interesting to read some of the critical reviews from people who did not grow up with the film but are more familiar with today's musicals and drawing comparisons to ""High School Musical"" and making the comment of how HSM utilized real teenagers for high school life and that ""GREASE"" utilized 20 to 30-something year olds to play teenagers.  I don't think any of us who watched it back then ever thought about the age being an issue for the film.  What we saw were popular talent at that time in a movie musical and the film became a success.  Even today, I have no reservations of the talents playing their roles.  They did a fantastic job!For me, John Travolta was the hottest star coming off with ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and then doing ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"" in 1977 and Olivia Newton-John was just one of the most beautiful female solo singers at the time.  Both had unique chemistry and the film was well-cast that I felt everything just went smoothly on the final cut.You really have to give a big applause to Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood for taking the chance of bringing a musical to film but making sure its adapted well for the screen.  Sure we see musicals now but during that time, there was no studio support.  And because the film was enjoyed by audiences, the film is definitely ingrained into America's pop culture.Also, I was just amazed through the featurettes and learning how the choreography was done.  Because there were so many people utilized in the dancing segments, Patricia Birchwood wanted to make things come alive but to alter a talent's own personal dance to make it look right on film.  And of course, Bill Butler, to capture what Birchwood wanted on film, the amount of cutting from scene to scene showing opposing points of view on a song like ""Summer Nights"" to the ending theme, it was indeed ""electrifying""!Overall, this Blu-ray release of ""GREASE"" is just the definitive version to own. To watch this classic film in High Definition and to see the magnificent picture quality really brings out the vibrant colors of the film, the energy and beauty of the beach sunset to showcasing the life of youth of the late 50's.  The DolbyTrueHD 5.1 audio makes the music come alive and last, there are many special features included that will help people remember and celebrate such a wonderful movie musical.Again, this is the true definitive version of ""GREASE"" to own!  I was just stunned by how magnificent this film looked and how much clearer and alive the music sounded in High Definition.  I highly recommend this release!",5,"Blu-ray: ""GREASE"" looks absolutely gorgeous in High Definition!

127110,A29COAL60SB48B,0792148061,Donna Di Giacomo,"[1, 4]","Let's face it: The 1950's were the most boring time in America (besides the 40's).  It was all about conformity - from the cookie-cutter suburban monstrosities called houses to the goofy clothing, to the music (I have more respect for Buddy Holly, who wrote his own music, as opposed to Elvis Presley) and toeing the right-wing line.  It was a decade when discrimination ran rampant against anyone not white or male (or who didn't fit into and buy the so-called ""American Dream"") and careers continued to be ruined by the witch-hunts of so-called ""reds.""But . . .I actually enjoyed ""Grease"" when I sat down to really watch and digest it.  John Travolta's time on Broadway with this show really paid off in the lead role.  He simply took it and ran with it.  No other actor could take his place as Danny (although didn't he ever get tired of playing the stereotypical dumb Italian guy - even though he's only half-Italian?).  Olivia Newtown-John was tailor-made for her role as Sandy.  She is one of a handful of singers who could actually act.  She was super cute.The DVD extras were informative and added to the good-time feel of the movie.  Apparently, the cast and crew got along so well that, for many of the cast, it really felt like their senior year in high school.  That chemistry came through in the movie and is still apparent nearly 30 years later.I can actually say I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack.  It's just one of those movies you can never tire of after watching many times.

127112,A29VKODW4R5U7W,0792148061,dooby,"[330, 337]","I won't go into praising the movie. It's already an American Classic and obviously anyone who's contemplating buying this will already love it. I felt guilty about double-dipping but the cute leather jacket was an irresistable gimmick. The following discusses mainly technical aspects of the new disc.I did a one-to-one comparison with the older disc. The picture has been cleaned up and looks noticeably different, though not necessarily better. The tiny dirt specks and film nicks, few as they were on the first disc, have been almost entirely eliminated. There is less grain. The picture also looks brighter, due to application of higher contrast. This has both positive and negative effects. In the darker scenes; like ONJ's ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" the greater contrast (deeper black levels and brighter highlights) makes it appear clearer, and I personally prefer it this way. Some viewers may not like it as the lighting now appears harder and more ""artificial"". In other places, the greater contrast tends to wipe out detail in the brighter parts of the picture; you can see this at the opening beach sequence, where the scene now appears brighter and clearer but the finer detail in the sandstone rocks have been obliterated in the glare. So pluses and minuses, but overall I liked the new transfer.The audio too has been remastered. The bass here is noticeably more prominent than on the previous DVD. It has that very satisfying visceral feel to it but there is also swamping of the underlying instrumentation. However I doubt if many people would notice or bother. What reviewers have referred to as an echoey quality on the first remix is still there. It is actually an over exaggerated reverb added to the vocal track. Most of the tracks in Grease have electronic reverb applied but some are more obvious and artifical than others; especially so in the 1998 remix featured here. The most egregious examples would be at the ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" reprise and Travolta's ""Electrifyin'"" repeats in ""You're The One That I Want."" Again I liked the newer, audio remix, mainly for its richer bass extension. Like previous reviewers have said, the 2.0 Stereo featured here is not the original theatrical Stereo mix but a downmix of the later DD 5.1 remix (made in 1998 for its 20th Anniversary re-release). And purists should note that the DD 5.1 remix (1998) is actually messing about with the music itself - there are additional instrumental and vocal overlays not found on the original theatrical soundtrack. (Eg. additional bass drum in second half of ""Summer Nights,"" background vocals in ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" and a clap-track in ""We Go Together."") Perhaps someday the producers will see fit to release Grease with its original unembellished soundtrack.The real delight here are the Extras. My favourite is the 15-minute long ""25th Anniversary DVD Launch Party."" Exerpts from the party concert include full length versions of Olivia Newton John singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" Olivia and John Travolta singing ""You're The One That I Want,"" and the reassembled cast singing ""Summer Nights."" All fine performances packed with fun-filled nostalgia. The 11 deleted/extended scenes are all in B&W; and last for just 10 minutes. Nothing earth-shattering here but good to have all the same. The Sing-Along was something I appreciated. In the previous DVD, there was no direct access to individual songs. A note about the Sing-Along subtitles. These are multicoloured, animated, karaoke-style, lyrics that accompany the songs and can be activated within the film or in a separate Sing-Along session. It apparently caused problems for some viewers. I tried it out on several DVD players, a Sony, a Pioneer and a Denon, one of which was over 5 years old. The lyrics displayed without any problem. It also worked on a computer DVD-ROM drive (Pioneer), so at least these models apparently work. Only the main feature is anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TV - 2.35:1 OAR). All the extras are in standard 1.33:1 fullscreen.",4,Fine new Rydell Edition... Remastered Video & Audio...

This edition of Grease is truly for the superfan or the person who hasn't previously purchased the movie on DVD in the past.Grease is the cult classic that starred Olivia Newton John and John Travolta. Olivia Newton John starred as Sandy. Sandy was a transfer student to Rydell High working to fit in John Travolta stars as Danny. Danny and Sandy had a wonderful summer romance but when Sandy transfers to Rydell their two different worlds collide. The films soundtrack--and dance numbers are classic.So what makes this version of Grease on DVD different than the version's previously released? The DVD comes in a leather jacket type of keepsake case. This is cute and the box fits snugly inside of the jacket. What really makes this version of Grease on DVD stand out are the bonus features. The film recently celebrated it's 25th Anniversary. The DVD includes memorable scenes from the 25th Anniversary DVD party. Another neat bonus feature is the featurette ""Grease Memories"" from John and Olivia. There are a ton of bonus features including a Rydell sing-a-long, deleted scenes, a featurette named the moves behind the music and many more.I recommend Grease-Rockin' Rydell Edition for the super Greast fan.

Forget the flat filming style (by Randal Kleiser) and the fact that the Rydale High students seem way too mature - we should just sit back and enjoy the songs, color, movement and sheer energy of the film.  John Travolta's Danny is both arrogant yet touching; someone willing to show bravado in front of his male buddies, yet extremely weak when it comes to showing off his emotions.  His body movements are a joy to watch - especially during the sequence where he presents Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) with a cheap ring and asks her to marry him.  Newton-John is especially good as a Doris Day/ Sandra Dee-type figure who cannot quite understand why Danny should behave so differently in front of his buddies. Stockard Channing's Rizzo quite simply steals the show; she cultivates a hard-boiled exterior (her real name in the film is Betty), yet cannot cover up an essential vulnerability, especially when she thinks that she is pregnant.  GREASE also contains a clutch of memorable cameos from television and film old-timers, from Sid Caesar's Coach Calhoun to Eve Arden's Principal McGee, to Joan Blondell's Vi.

127118,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792148061,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 9]","It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited ""Summer Nights"" and the stylized ""Jailhouse Rock"" knock-off, ""Greased Lightning"". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, ""You're the One That I Want"". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading ""Beauty School Dropout"" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 ""Rockin' Rydell Edition"" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic ""Grease Day"" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.",3,Nostalgic Nostalgia Fest Maintains Its Superficial Bounce,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,3636,"['hard', 'think', 'bigger', 'slice', '1970', 'Hollywood', 'kitsch', 'candy-coated', 'mega-successful', '1978', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Capitalizing', 'tidal', 'wave', 'Eisenhower-era', 'nostalgia', 'pervasive', 'big', 'small', 'screens', 'time', 'be', 'stridently', 'artificial', 'mindlessly', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'mind', 'had', 'such', 'afterlife', 'including', 'sing-along', 'versions', 'playing', 'art-house', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Part', 'ironic', 'amusement', 'watching', 'actors', 'obviously', 'late', 'twenties', 'early', 'thirties', 'pretending', 'be', 'teenagers', 'Credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Randal', 'Kleiser', 'unapologetic', 'stance', 'maneuvering', 'contrived', 'silliness', 'spirit', 'not', 'much', 'finesse.Set', 'period', '1950', 'existed', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'lacking', 'semblance', 'reality', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'greaser', 'Danny', 'cool', 'leader', 'T-Birds', 'wholesome', 'Sandy', 'good-girl', 'Aussie', 'blonde', 'enjoying', 'summer', 'romance', 'beach', 'prior', 'senior', 'year', 'Rydell', 'High', 'Sandy', 'was', 'supposed', 'move', 'back', 'Australia', 'up', 'staying', 'stateside', 'attending', 'Rydell', 'image', 'being', 'utmost', 'importance', 'Danny', 'initially', 'Sandy', 'now', 'cheerleader', 'when', 'meet', 'again', 'follow', 'romantic', 'complications', 'course', 'school', 'year', 'graduation', 'also', 'ongoing', 'power', 'struggle', 'T-Birds', 'rival', 'gang', 'Scorpions', 'as', 'well', 'peer-pressure', 'shenanigans', 'caused', 'T-Birds', 'girlfriends', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'headed', 'sleep-around', 'tart', 'Rizzo.All', 'merely', 'excuse', 'various', 'musical', 'numbers', 'most', 'energetic', 'being', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'cleverly', 'edited', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'stylized', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'knock-off', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'Most', 'numbers', 'are', 'Broadway', 'show', 'are', 'deliberately', 'anachronistic', 'insertions', 'such', 'Barry', 'Gibb', 'disco-accented', 'title', 'tune', 'peppy', 'funhouse', 'duet', ""'re"", 'One', 'Want', 'John', 'Travolta', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Danny', 'even', 'singing', 'voice', 'threatens', 'evaporate', 'sincerity', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'right', 'manner', 'Sandy', 'hardly', 'challenged', 'develop', 'compelling', 'character', 'here.The', 'standout', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Rizzo', 'only', 'character', 'connection', 'reality', 'times', 'expertly', 'mocking', 'Look', 'Me', ""'m"", 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'frankly', 'outdoes', 'Newton-John', 'touching', 'Are', 'Worse', 'Things', 'Could', 'Do', 'Several', 'familiar', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Miss', 'Brooks', 'mode', 'Principal', 'McGee', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'rather', 'constrained', 'Coach', 'Calhoun', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'equally', 'pallid', 'malt', 'shop', 'waitress', 'Vi', 'Edd', 'Byrnes', 'Dick', 'Clark-type', 'lothario', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'auto', 'shop', 'teacher', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'ditzy', 'school', 'administrator', 'course', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'serenading', 'Beauty', 'School', 'Dropout', 'squeaky-voiced', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'Frenchy.Serious', 'examination', 'film', 'useless', 'more', 'cheery', 'variety', 'show', 'superficial', 'references', 'sexual', 'politics', '1950', 'new', '2006', 'Rockin', 'Rydell', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'package', 'extras', 'should', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Kleiser', 'choreographer', 'Patricia', 'Birch', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'black-and-white', 'nostalgic', 'Grease', 'Day', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'Travolta', 'Newton-John', 'producers', 'Allen', 'Carr', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'coverage', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'launch', 'party', 'spirited', 'performances', 'Newton-John', 'Travolta', 'remaining', 'cast']",N/A

A lot of the reviews here are very negative.  Some stating that the film has far too much sexual innuendo, and some people just go way into detail..While Grease may have some sexual innuendo,(i didn't really know what that was at 9 when i first saw it), it may have people in it who are clearly not teenagers, but adults playing teenagers..but come on' fellow ... This is Grease we are talking about!!! It's a musical! It's certainly not made for children under the age of 9, but if kids younger than that are watching, I don't think they even notice that..it goes right over their heads while they sing and dance along with all the fun songs that grace the entire movie's soundtrack.I think many of the reviewers here have taken Grease to seriously..It's one thing not to like this movie, which I know plenty of people who do...and that's fine...I will always love this movie.  I did at 9 years old when it came out..and I still love it now, 24 years later.  It is just pure fun to watch even if some of the characters do seem annoying at times(the t-birds), danny and kenickie are the t birds..the other guys are just three stooges rip offs.I did like all of the pink ladies, and I think the best acting done was my the leader herself, Rizzo, played by the wonderfully talented actress, Stockard Channing.  John Travolta, Danny, who is charming, often looks bored and not happy to be in this movie, but I still love watching him careen across the floor during ""Greased Lightening"".  This is a movie that I can watch over and over.  Every time it comes on cable, I have to watch at least half of it. This movie has always been so entertaining for me and so fun to watch.  It's an ""escape"" from all the serious films.This is a movie worth watching for fans of musicals, fans of Stockard Channing, Olivia Newton JOhn, or John Travolta, or just for people who like to have fun and be entertained in a very simplistic way.(Warning: you may start singing along as they break into song!)And it's got a good ending...",5,One of my all time favorite movies,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,2326,"['Grease', 'very', 'typical', 'story', 'line', 'many', 'musicals', 'have', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'back', 'girl', 'again', 'something', 'radically', 'different', 'get', 'then', 'back.Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'Sandy', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Danny..the', 'boy', 'girl', 'story.It', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'lot', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'negative', 'stating', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'people', 'just', 'go', 'way', 'detail..While', 'Grease', 'may', 'have', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', '9', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'may', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'playing', 'teenagers..but', 'come', 'fellow', 'Grease', 'are', 'talking', 'musical', 'certainly', 'not', 'made', 'children', 'age', '9', 'kids', 'younger', 'are', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'notice', 'that..it', 'right', 'heads', 'sing', 'dance', 'fun', 'songs', 'grace', 'entire', 'movie', 'soundtrack.I', 'think', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'taken', 'Grease', 'seriously..It', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'know', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'fine', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'movie', 'did', '9', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'came', 'out..and', 'still', 'love', 'now', '24', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'pure', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'annoying', 'times', 't-birds', 'danny', 'kenickie', 'are', 't', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'three', 'stooges', 'rip', 'offs.I', 'did', 'pink', 'ladies', 'think', 'best', 'acting', 'done', 'was', 'leader', 'Rizzo', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'actress', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Danny', 'who', 'charming', 'often', 'bored', 'not', 'happy', 'be', 'movie', 'still', 'love', 'watching', 'careen', 'floor', 'Greased', 'Lightening', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'Every', 'time', 'cable', 'have', 'watch', 'least', 'half', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'entertaining', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'escape', 'serious', 'films.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'fans', 'musicals', 'fans', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'JOhn', 'John', 'Travolta', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'entertained', 'very', 'simplistic', 'way', 'Warning', 'may', 'start', 'singing', 'along', 'break', 'song', 'got', 'good', 'ending']",N/A

The Rockin' Rydell Edition is the only way to go as the colors have never looked more bright, the scenes are totally scratch-free and the digital soundtrack makes for a better experience than the original DVD. I'd buy it mostly for the first two reasonsand not for the latter as the sound clean-up is not is not as impressive as the look of the film.Seeing a movie like this so many years after it first came out reminded of why I liked it from the very first frame. The familiar boy meets girl tale is elevated to classic status due to the star appeal of its leads, the great casting of the supporting cast (particularly a long in the tooth Stockard Channing, but no one else could have played Rizzo), non-stop singing of beyond catchy songs, top-notch musical numbers, and even manages to sneak some old timers for fun.It's really a wealth of riches and one of my favorite musicals. If you are too young to have seen this when it first came out and think that the recent ""Hairspray"" was good, you may think that this is even better. For the others who missed it when it came out, it will make you yearn for the good old days even if you did not go to school in the late 1950s. While the movie was pre MTV and has none of the fast edits of say ""Flashdance"", the goes by so fast and leaves you wanting to see it again.The DVD extras are OK, esp. interviews but the alternate takes part is lame.

But seeing the movie as a child in the theater is much different than watching it as an adult.  The last time I watched it, the TV channel provided commentary on a crawl at the bottom of the screen, and the two crucial, gaping flaws with the movie finally crystallized.First, the age of the actors.  God bless `em, but they were WAY too old to be high schoolers.  Stockard Channing was 33, or nearly twice the age of her character.  Ms Newton-John was 29.  Now, I'm not asking for perfect verisimilitude in a movie, but you can't violate my willing suspension of disbelief so obviously.The second problem is the location of the school.  The T-Birds look like a classic Long Island / New Jersey type gang, similar to the Lords of Flatbush, complete with the accents.  But the school has palm trees waving in the background, and the final race, as almost anyone who has watched any movie made in America can tell you, takes place in the L.A. River basin.

The film was the most financially successful musical ever made, and when it was released it was almost impossible to go anywhere in America or Europe that summer without hearing the film's hits on the radio.The central casting was just about ideal, with John Travolta perfect for the narcissistic and endearingly dumb Danny Zuko and the pop singer Olivia Newton-John as the virginal Sandy Olsen (originally Sandy Dumbowski in the stage version, but they had to explain Newton-John's accent and made her, somewhat bizarrely, a visiting Australian exchange student). Newton-John is extremely likeable and enchantingly pretty (with her highly etched cheekbones and big wide eyes): it's a real shame she never had the film career she deserved, because she is exceptionally winning in this film. Her singing is lovely too, although her big number (&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;) was written by her usual songwriter John Farrar and doesn't sound like any other song in the film's score.The rest of the cast is fair to middling, with Eve Arden basically walking away with the rest of the film as an Our Miss Brooks-like principal. Didi Conn makes the only real favorable impression out of the actors attempting (largely unsuccessfully) to convince us that they're teenagers. Stockard Channing is far too old to play Rizzo (although she's quite fine in both of her big numbers), and most of the actors who play the T-Birds are fairly annoying--they seem to be Borscht Belt comedians on special loan to Rydell High (that must be some exchange program).The film is not without its puzzling points: you never seem to figure out why the televised national dance competition is being held with only the Rydell kids participating, or why the final song celebrates how much the characters like one another when they seemed largely unable to stand one another at all during the rest of the film. But its worth watching just for Travolta and Newton-John, and above all for the fine choreography (&quot;Summer Days, Summer Nights&quot; is a particular standout).",4,The last of the oldtime movie musicals,984873600,"03 18, 2001",2001,2350,"['almost', 'one', 'ages', '45', '30', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'words', 'quot', 'Summer', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'quot', 'probably', 'best', 'testament', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'quot', 'Grease', 'quot', 'was', 'really', 'last', 'successful', 'movie', 'musical', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'financially', 'successful', 'musical', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'go', 'anywhere', 'America', 'Europe', 'summer', 'hearing', 'film', 'hits', 'radio.The', 'central', 'casting', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'ideal', 'John', 'Travolta', 'perfect', 'narcissistic', 'endearingly', 'dumb', 'Danny', 'Zuko', 'pop', 'singer', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'virginal', 'Sandy', 'Olsen', 'originally', 'Sandy', 'Dumbowski', 'stage', 'version', 'had', 'explain', 'Newton-John', 'accent', 'made', 'somewhat', 'bizarrely', 'visiting', 'Australian', 'exchange', 'student', 'Newton-John', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'enchantingly', 'pretty', 'highly', 'etched', 'cheekbones', 'big', 'wide', 'eyes', 'real', 'shame', 'never', 'had', 'film', 'career', 'deserved', 'exceptionally', 'winning', 'film', 'singing', 'lovely', 'too', 'big', 'number', 'quot', 'Hopelessly', 'Devoted', 'quot', 'was', 'written', 'usual', 'songwriter', 'John', 'Farrar', ""n't"", 'sound', 'other', 'song', 'film', 'score.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'fair', 'middling', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'basically', 'walking', 'away', 'rest', 'film', 'Miss', 'Brooks-like', 'principal', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'only', 'real', 'favorable', 'impression', 'actors', 'attempting', 'largely', 'unsuccessfully', 'convince', ""'re"", 'teenagers', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Rizzo', 'quite', 'fine', 'big', 'numbers', 'most', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'T-Birds', 'are', 'fairly', 'annoying', 'seem', 'be', 'Borscht', 'Belt', 'comedians', 'special', 'loan', 'Rydell', 'High', 'must', 'be', 'exchange', 'program', '.The', 'film', 'not', 'puzzling', 'points', 'never', 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'televised', 'national', 'dance', 'competition', 'being', 'held', 'only', 'Rydell', 'kids', 'participating', 'why', 'final', 'song', 'how', 'much', 'characters', 'one', 'when', 'seemed', 'largely', 'unable', 'stand', 'one', 'rest', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'Travolta', 'Newton-John', 'fine', 'choreography', 'quot', 'Summer', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'quot', 'particular', 'standout']",N/A

127164,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,0792148061,Jennifer Litchfield,"[2, 2]","Grease is everything a musical film should be.  It is a visual and aural feast that has captured the imaginations of audiences for over 25 years.  Everything is larger than life and the action occurs amidst a riot of 1950s colour.  Who cares if the cast is largely composed of 30-somethings playing teenagers?  The key to Grease's success is not realism, but the enormous amount of infectious energy exuded by the cast.This zest for life is particularly apparent in the lively and eminently sing-able chorus song-and-dance numbers.  The tunes of retro party favourites such as 'Greased Lightning' and 'You're The One That I Want' will probably be familiar to many viewers, but lesser known songs, including the short and sarcastic 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Beauty School Drop-Out' (with Frankie Avalon in the role of guardian angel) are also fun toe-tappers.Musicals work best when, like Grease, they concentrate on the music rather than the plot; however, the story here is completely adequate.  Sandy and Danny had a summer fling at the beach, but at school Danny has an image to uphold - which Sandy doesn't really fit - so their senior year at Rydell High is spent in a daze of ""will-they-won't-they"" teenage angst.John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John set the screen alight as Danny and Sandy; there are some fabulous character roles in the ""Pink Ladies"" and ""T-Birds"" school cliques, and some very funny cameos - particularly the pairing of Principal McGee and Blanche the office lady.  There are sexual innuendoes aplenty if you look hard enough, and despite the fact that the movie is set half a century ago, the viewer is led to conclude that teenagers have been, and will always be, teenagers.",5,"""Conventionality belongs to yesterday""",1044921600,"02 11, 2003",2003,1709,"['Grease', 'everything', 'musical', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'visual', 'aural', 'feast', 'captured', 'imaginations', 'audiences', '25', 'years', 'Everything', 'larger', 'life', 'action', 'amidst', 'riot', '1950s', 'colour', 'Who', 'cast', 'largely', 'composed', '30-somethings', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'key', 'Grease', 'success', 'not', 'realism', 'enormous', 'amount', 'infectious', 'energy', 'exuded', 'cast.This', 'zest', 'life', 'particularly', 'apparent', 'lively', 'eminently', 'sing-able', 'chorus', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'tunes', 'retro', 'party', 'favourites', 'such', ""'Greased"", 'Lightning', ""'You"", ""'re"", 'One', 'Want', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'familiar', 'many', 'viewers', 'lesser', 'known', 'songs', 'including', 'short', 'sarcastic', ""'Look"", 'Me', ""'m"", 'Sandra', 'Dee', ""'Beauty"", 'School', 'Drop-Out', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'role', 'guardian', 'angel', 'are', 'also', 'fun', 'toe-tappers.Musicals', 'work', 'best', 'when', 'Grease', 'concentrate', 'music', 'rather', 'plot', 'however', 'story', 'here', 'completely', 'adequate', 'Sandy', 'Danny', 'had', 'summer', 'fling', 'beach', 'school', 'Danny', 'image', 'uphold', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'so', 'senior', 'year', 'Rydell', 'High', 'spent', 'daze', ""will-they-won't-they"", 'teenage', 'angst.John', 'Travolta', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'set', 'screen', 'alight', 'Danny', 'Sandy', 'are', 'fabulous', 'character', 'roles', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'T-Birds', 'school', 'cliques', 'very', 'funny', 'cameos', 'particularly', 'pairing', 'Principal', 'McGee', 'Blanche', 'office', 'lady', 'are', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'aplenty', 'look', 'hard', 'enough', 'fact', 'movie', 'set', 'century', 'ago', 'viewer', 'led', 'conclude', 'teenagers', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'teenagers']",N/A

I saw this film when it came out and it just boggled my mind that adults would flock to a script so pandering. But then the stage show continues to horrify audience even in the 2000's and STILL the tradition carries on to cast 40-somethings as teenagers....only because people who are 60-something now go to see this show and overlook how bad the actors are because they can't actually see the stage performers up close!

It is time for a new school year at Rydell High, and Danny is a Senior.  He is a member of the T-Birds gang (which feels like a more innocent version of what we'd think of as a gang), the leader of the group.  Sandy had told Danny that she had to go back to Australia, but she ends up starting school at Rydell also, unaware that Danny is there.  Danny is the cool greaser, popular with the ladies and with a reputation to uphold.  Sandy is the sweetest girl next door that you are ever likely to find.  When they meet up again, they are excited to see each other, but it doesn't work because Danny is hiding behind his reputation and behaves accordingly.As a musical, this film is absolutely wonderful.  It harkens back to a more innocent time, and while this film is a bit more sexual than you might expect from a PG rated movie, it is very sweet and charming.  Most of the songs are great, fit the scene and do not have that stereotypical ""it's time to burst into song"" feel.  The songs feel like a more natural extension of the character and scene and sometimes even feel like what they might actually say at that point.  Stockard Channing steals all of her scenes as Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies.  Her two big songs ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" and ""There are Worse Things I Could Do"" are highlights of the movie, along with the classic ""Summer Nights"" (Travolta and Newton John), ""Beauty School Dropout"" (Frankie Avalon), and ""You're the One that I Want"" (Travolta, Newton John).  The one complaint that I do have is that I much prefer Sandy as the girl-next-door over her new look at the end of the film.  All the characters act like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all that it is showing me is that Sandy has to change who she is in order to get a guy to like her.  Or, maybe I am thinking too much about this.  The bottom line is that this movie is a blast and it is my favorite musical.

Though set in the fifties, ""Grease"" remains deeply entrenched in the seventies, as it defined that freewheeling decade's carefree attitude and innocence while drawing inspiration from the Elvis era.  Still the top-grossing movie musical of all time, ""Grease"" works as a coming-of-age film we can all relate to - it sings (great songs from the Broadway classic plus chart-topping classics from the Bee Gees and Olivia Newton-John's longtime collaborator, John Farrar), it dances (Rydel High's Gym Dance),  zips (""the chicks'll cream for Greased Lightning"") and celebrates youth and friendship.Twenty five years after its first theatrical release, the movie still feels and sounds fresh even through its nostalgia, thanks to star-making performances from Travolta, Newton-John and Stockard Channing, to its clever wordplay and its irreverent look at high school - when everything and anything is possible.  It's a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, as audiences associate seeing it with a singular moment in time.  Cameo appearances from golden greats like Frankie Avalon (""Beauty School Dropout""), Sid Ceasar and Edd Byrnes are comic gems.The now-world-famous cast is hard to beat ... Didi Conn and Stockard Channing are excellent as Frenchy (THE beauty school dud) and Rizzo (the tough girl with a soft spot), while Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks) gets the supporting role of a lifetime.  Dody Goodman as her daffy assistant is a hoot, but the film belongs to the music and the performances of its two principles.  Olivia Newton-John is a sublime choice for Sandy.  Though requiring re-tooling from the original stage show, her character's Aussie born lass is a perfect combination of girl-next-door sweetness and (later on) I-Am-Woman-hear-me-roar guts.  Perhaps no transformation has been so effectively cut in a movie as ONJ's good girl gone wild.  Besides setting off fashion trends and the lycra industry, Sandy's evolution reminds today's teens that you can be hip AND nice.  That's a testament to the singer-actress' presence in this film and her ongoing legend.  Travolta is also sublime as Danny, a mix of cocky swagger and silly-boy charm that's never malicious...just young.  His Danny plays both sides of the teen-angst fence, whether telling his version of ""Summer Nights"" to the boys, or sweetly professing his love for ""Sandy"" at the drive-in (drive-ins are set for a comeback if this DVD finds itself into everyone's home!)  After 25 years and countless viewings, Olivia and Travolta make beautiful music together!Guaranteed a winner in any home, ""Grease"" gets better with repeat viewings and remains accessible, fun and genuine.  As a backdrop for baby boomers' high school years and our memories of all thats happened since...""Grease"" remains the word!

With the acting, the story, and the flawless music featured in Grease, it's no wonder why it has gotten such critical acclaim.When Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy Olsen (Newton-John) fall in love over the summer, Sandy delivers the news that she'd be leaving back to her home in Australia.  But as the new year at Rydell begins, Sandy has a change of plans and stays in the U.S.  Once re-united with Danny (thanks to Rizzo, played by Stockard Channing), Sandy is delighted to once again see Danny, and Danny is just as overwhelmed.  But he believes that his masculinity and his leadership is being questioned when he has trouble expressing his love for Sandy in front of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, so he decides to play it cool - which would end up in Sandy becoming confused and seeing Danny in a different way, yet she remains in love with him.  But eventually, things do work out between Sandy, Danny, the Pink Ladies, and the T-Birds - this movie is packed with great acting, not to mention the great songs featured in it.Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta shocked viewers everywhere when they broke out into song.  Catchy songs such as &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (sung by John Travolta), &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (sung by Olivia and John), and &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot; (sung by Olivia and John) - which is the signature song of the movie, became instant national hits.  Olivia's solo song &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; shows how much of an angel she is, pouring out her sweet voice to beautiful lyrics.This movie was well excecuted.  It's a legend of its own time.  This is a must-see, and of course, a must-have for any lover of great movies.",5,Grease -is- the word.,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,1817,"['Probably', 'greatest', 'musical', 'time', 'Grease', 'starring', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'John', 'Travolta', 'fun', 'generation', 'acting', 'story', 'flawless', 'music', 'featured', 'Grease', 'wonder', 'why', 'gotten', 'such', 'critical', 'acclaim.When', 'Danny', 'Zuko', 'Travolta', 'Sandy', 'Olsen', 'Newton-John', 'fall', 'love', 'summer', 'Sandy', 'news', ""'d"", 'be', 'leaving', 'back', 'home', 'Australia', 'new', 'year', 'Rydell', 'Sandy', 'change', 'plans', 'stays', 'U.S.', 'Once', 're-united', 'Danny', 'thanks', 'Rizzo', 'played', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Sandy', 'delighted', 'once', 'again', 'see', 'Danny', 'Danny', 'just', 'as', 'overwhelmed', 'masculinity', 'leadership', 'being', 'questioned', 'when', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'love', 'Sandy', 'front', 'T-Birds', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'play', 'cool', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'Sandy', 'becoming', 'confused', 'seeing', 'Danny', 'different', 'way', 'yet', 'love', 'eventually', 'things', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'Sandy', 'Danny', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'T-Birds', 'movie', 'packed', 'great', 'acting', 'not', 'mention', 'great', 'songs', 'featured', 'it.Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'John', 'Travolta', 'shocked', 'viewers', 'everywhere', 'when', 'broke', 'out', 'song', 'Catchy', 'songs', 'such', 'quot', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'quot', 'sung', 'John', 'Travolta', 'quot', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'quot', 'sung', 'Olivia', 'John', 'quot', ""'re"", 'One', 'Want', 'quot', 'sung', 'Olivia', 'John', 'signature', 'song', 'movie', 'became', 'instant', 'national', 'hits', 'Olivia', 'solo', 'song', 'quot', 'Hopelessly', 'Devoted', 'quot', 'how', 'much', 'angel', 'pouring', 'out', 'sweet', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'lyrics.This', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'excecuted', 'legend', 'own', 'time', 'must-see', 'course', 'must-have', 'lover', 'great', 'movies']",N/A

Grease - a long awaited dvd release of mine -- holds that magic that makes a film a rounded complete cinema classic.Everyone knows the story of the Rydell High group, each going through their own little quirks and some getting share that through amazing song and wonderful dance. It's awesome how director Randal Kleiser combined the main plot of Danny and Sandy with subtle subplots such as Rizzo and Kenickie (Which - in a way - are the main stars of the Broadway version), the Thunder Road ordeal, and Frenchie's dropping out of school for beauty school. The cast is an awesome group of talent. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta as our leads are captivating with the best moves and wonderful voices. Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing add that sufficient racy attitude into the film with their smirky one-liners and great voices. The rest of the Thunderbirds and Pink Ladies were all great assets to the film and are memorable in their own way. Especially Didi Conn and her voice. Loved the lady.Although I praise the movie highly, the DVD is a the littlest bit of a disappointment. We do get the film in anamorphic widescreen and the nifty original theatrical trailer, but there's nothing new in regards to bonus features. We get the same interviews that can be found on the 20th Anniversary special VHS edition (Which aren't bad, but I've seen it so many times). But there's nothing more than that. Warner Bros. did treat us to a nifty packaging, but the menus aren't gawkable. All in all, the DVD presentation is a fair one.Grease is a piece of cinema classic fare if there ever was one.

They try to be like each other and impress each other in their own ways. John Travolta looks his best in this film. I think he WAS a natural-born greaser along with Henry Winkler. The movie does take you back in time to the '50s even though I wasn't born then, though from the movies I see, and the '50s music I hear, I don't doubt it. The movie was a 1978 box office hit. 20 years later, it was a hit all over again. Boy, I remember that! It was so popular again. I can't compare it to &quot;American Graffiti&quot; though. That's a classic that's just not appreciated enough by my generation.

I was 10 years old and in New York City on vacation with my uncle. It was opening day for Grease and we decided to go see it. I couldn't tell you what movie theatre it was in, but it was one of those old great movie theatres that actually had character: art decco decor, sticky floors, and the ghosts of generations of movie goers...I loved Grease (this from an avid hater of movie musicals: bad music and worse acting; give me a Shostakovich string quartet or a Mahler symphony any day!). Grease was magical to me: the music was fun fun fun, John Travolta was at his very best (when I'm 90 years old if you mention the name John Travolta I will always picture him as he was in Grease), and Olivia Newton-John was cute as pie. This from a kid who saw Star Wars the year before over 40 times in the movie theatre in 1977 (and lets not forget the Great  James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me and the awesome WWII movie A Bridge Too Far). I still have my record of the Grease Soundtrack I bought at the time (of course no turntable to play it on).I can say that I haven't seen Grease as many times as I have seen the original Star Wars movie, but I probably have seen it more times than any other movie besides Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark (okay I have seen the original Star Wars over 300 times and Raiders of the Lost Ark almost as much - not that we'll see those two movies on DVD before the next millenium). Grease is truly one of the purist movie experiences you'll ever have. Great music, and actors who are having fun and not taking everything too seriously.Pure fun. A classic movie made during the golden age of movies...the 70s silly!So nowadays you have the gaudy Moulin Rouge with a Jedi and Nicole Kidman making me cringe.

Secondly because there's some great pop music in this movie, _Hopelessy Devoted to You_ is one of the best pop songs about unrequited attraction ever written. Thirdly because of the subtext of this movie, the lesson this movie teaches you is that in order to get ahead you have to be a slut, just look at the way Olivia Newton John (who was 30 when this movie was made) turns from a good girl at the beginning of the movie into a leather trouser wearing slut at the end.

Bernabo,"[7, 12]","I have seen &quot;Grease&quot; performed on stage (a dinner theater still counts as a stage, people), so I have a great appreciation for how it was turned into a big screen musical.  Actually, &quot;Grease&quot; was the movie that proved the musical was not dead, although it did not really inspire the rebirth of the musical (One word: &quot;Xanadu&quot;).  Sweet All-Australian girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John) had a summer romance with greaser Danny Zucko (John Travolta), and now at Rydell High he is too caught up with his cool dude image to admit he really, really likes her.  Travolta puts his charm into overdrive while Newton-John looks so darn cute and perky you might not be able to stand it, but Stockard Channing as Rizzo steals this movie in my book (&quot;There Are Worst Things I Could Do&quot;).  For the most part the choreography by Patricia Burch (who would get the opportunity to direct &quot;Grease II&quot;) is better than the songs and the songs are not half-bad.  However, my favorite will always be &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; sung by Teen Angel Frankie Avalon, which might be as funny a tongue-in-cheeck song as you will ever find in a Hollywood musical.  One of the other things I like about &quot;Grease&quot; is that it retains its hard edge; there are a couple of cruel lines in here that you are not going to want to explain to younger kids (you will have enough trouble explaining how Sandra Dee is to them).  However, they do serve to anchor the movie a bit.  Not a deep musical and not particularly romantic per se, just one where a good time is had by all.Most romantic line(s): (1) &quot;Oh Danny, is this the end?&quot; &quot;No Sandy.

There seems to be no good reason for this, but it was during a time when ""special edition"" releases were constantly messing with the original version of films. Unfortunately, there are numerous errors and changes in the remix. Some are downright inexcusable, like percussion and background vocals in the wrong place, bad music edits and even background vocals out of sync during You're the One That I Want. Foley and dialog balances are off throughout. It's a mess.Despite the fact that fans have been complaining for years, Paramount included only this remix on the 2 DVD versions they released. I had assumed they would finally include the original soundtrack on the blu ray, but they are STILL only using the botched remix. This is unbelievable. Including the far superior original soundtrack would cost them virtually nothing, and yet they continue to disrespect a popular classic movie and it fans, despite being repeatedly made aware of the problem. I bought the first 2 DVD editions, but refuse to buy a blu ray until they fix the soundtrack.The only way to hear the original, correct soundtrack is on pre-1998 VHS and laserdisc copies.

It was a great success on Broadway and it wasn't until Paramount Pictures took on the challenge before anyone realized the movie musical, if done right, could be a great success.This movie has the best casting around at the time. John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever, Face Off, Pulp Fiction) and Olivia Newton John (Two Of A Kind, Xanadu) as Danny and Sandy trying to make their senior year in high school the best it could be after spending a summer together falling in love. The trials and tribulations of high school, graduating, rivals gangs and sexual advances all in the 1950's - a time of music and passion and a lot of simple things.Great costuming, great musical arrangements and the best part for me was the choreography. Staying true the tradition of musical theatre, the dance numbers where fun and energetic and simply the best for a modern day musical on the screen. Such hits came from his movie like the title track itself GREASE (written by Barry Gibb), You're The One That I Want and Hopelessly Devoted to You are a few that made the pop charts back in 1978.Great supporting cast members and some incredible performances by Jeff Conoway (Taxi, Babylon Five-TV,  Man On The Moon) Didi Conn (Violet, Grease 2) , Michael Tucci (The Garry Shandling Show, Blow) , Sid Caeser (Your Show Of Shows-TV, Grease 2, Vegas Vacation), Eve Arden (Under The Rainbow, Grease 2) and the best of them all Miss Stockard Channing (The First Wives Club, The West Wing -TV). Her performance as Rizzo could never be matched.This movie is fun for everyone and whole family and will keep your toes tapping and the tunes humming long after you see it. The DVD extras include and anniversary celebration for the movie as well as a retrospective on what it took to make this thing happen.

Hollywood is just so greedy I'm sure they might wait til they get suckers to buy this and then they will come out with a big package.Another big problem ,in some scenes the ads in the background are unable to read.

Do we really have to wait until the 30th anniversary? There's so much good stuff that could be put on the DVD, instead we get a lousy songbook. Which is stupid, cos if you've seen the film enough times and have the soundtrack, you'll already know all the words!But still I love the film and always will! I've loved it since I was young, and Sandy & Danny make the perfect couple. There's so much chemistry between Olivia Newton John & John Travolta, not something you see too often in movies. All the supporting cast are brilliant, although only Frenchie (Didi Conn) returned for the sequel.There's been many complaints about the fact how much older the actors are than the characters they play, but so many films aimed at teenagers do this nowadays. There's only two in Grease who are actually still teenagers: Dinah Manoff and Lorenzo Lamas were both 19. John Travolta (Danny) was 24; Jeff Conaway, Michael Tucci, Barry Pearl, and Didi Conn were all 28; Olivia Newton-John was 29; Jamie Donnelly was 30 and Stockard Channing was the eldest at 34.All the songs are brilliant, although I still find ""Grease"" and ""Sandy"" slightly dodgy, they don't match the rest of the songs. ""You're The One That I Want"" is definitely my favourite but Randal Kleiser hated the song saying it ""sounded awful"". It also helps the film go out on a high, I don't think it would have done as well if it hadn't featured in the film, as ""We Belong Together"" doesn't work as an ending song to the film. Filming of the song took just an afternoon. Of course there's the stunning entrance of Olivia I also love ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", as it means a lot to me these days.It's a feel good film, and I still don't understand why some people haven't yet seen this movie! It's one of those films you'll watch once or twice a year, but are much better than say the other films that shown annually, like Wizard of Oz, or Gone With The Wind. This will stand the test of time, and is still loved to this day.Normally, when I buy a DVD, the special edition gets announced soon after.

Though when I was older I have respect and a very much liking for it. When I went to see the stage play in DC I always liked the Broadway Play better then the movie. However, the movie is a pretty great addition to the teenage-musical-era. John Travolta does a pretty amazing job singing and dancing as Danny, one of the head Greasers. And Olivia Newton John does an excellent job pulling off playing sweet and loving Sandy, and then to wild Sandy at the end of the movie. They also make the perfect pair for this movie. The rest of the cast is quite incrediable and memorable as well. This movie will always be a classic and beloved. And I don't think I need to say what it's about because the name speeks for itself :) everyone should know what it's about.The only thing I was disappointed in is the DVD quality. I was expecting a lot more, and apparently everyone else was too. It has a pretty good interviews with some of the cast from Grease but it's nothing we haven't heard about before. And a theaterical trailer. And then of course the movie. As much as they advertised Grease coming out on DVD it's pretty much a slight disappointment especially it being the 20th Anniversary of Grease you just expect a lot more.However, I would give the movie about a B+ - C+ and a DVD about a C-.",3,A Very Classic Musical-Great Movie,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,1410,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'Grease', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'falling', 'love', 'movie', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'have', 'respect', 'very', 'much', 'liking', 'When', 'went', 'see', 'stage', 'play', 'DC', 'always', 'liked', 'Broadway', 'Play', 'better', 'then', 'movie', 'However', 'movie', 'pretty', 'great', 'addition', 'teenage-musical-era', 'John', 'Travolta', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'job', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Danny', 'one', 'head', 'Greasers', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'excellent', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'playing', 'sweet', 'loving', 'Sandy', 'then', 'wild', 'Sandy', 'end', 'movie', 'also', 'make', 'perfect', 'pair', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'quite', 'incrediable', 'memorable', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'classic', 'beloved', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'say', 'what', 'about', 'name', 'speeks', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'about.The', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'apparently', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'too', 'pretty', 'good', 'interviews', 'cast', 'Grease', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'before', 'theaterical', 'trailer', 'then', 'course', 'movie', 'As', 'much', 'advertised', 'Grease', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'especially', 'being', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Grease', 'just', 'expect', 'lot', 'more.However', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'B+', 'C+', 'DVD', 'C-']",N/A

127242,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0792148061,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","In 1971, writers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey wrote and composed the music for a musical entitled ""Grease"".  It appeared first as an amateur production in Chicago, but eventually went to NYC as both off-Broadway and Broadway productions.  With the musical's Broadway success, Paramount Pictures produced it on film in 1978 under the direction of Randal Kleiser, whose previous directorial experiences had been primarily TV series and made-for-TV films.The story for ""Grease"" is simple: in circa 1959, an uprooted teenaged girl from Australia, Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John), meets and has a summer romance with a local American boy, Danny Zuko (John Travolta).  At the end of summer, her family remains in America instead of returning to Australia. She is enrolled in a local public high school, Rydell High School, which just happens to be the same high school that Danny attends.  When she runs into Danny, his persona changes to what his friends expect: cool, uninterested and a practical joker.  Sandy is naturally upset, but she doesn't yet understand the dynamics of his friends, who are in two exclusive cliques, the T-Birds (the guys) and the Pink Ladies (the gals).  One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy (Didi Conn), befriends Sandy and Sandy gets to spend some time with other Pink Ladies, who include Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Marty Maraschino (Dinah Manoff) and Jan (Jamie Donnelly).  The T-Birds include Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Doody (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci) and Putzie (Kelly Ward).  The principal of Rydell is Principal McGee (Eve Arden), who is assisted by they bumbling Blanche (Dody Goodman).  Other characters include football coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar), auto-mechanics teacher Mrs. Murdock (Alice Ghostley), Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes), Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles), older malt shop waitress (Ellen Travolta) and a cameo by Frankie Avalon as the Teen Angel.  The musical group Sha Na Na is also featured.Casting for ""Grease"" continues to be an issue for many people after 25 years because the average age of the actors who portrayed the Pink Ladies & T-Birds (including Olivia Newton-John) was 28. (The oldest was 34 and the youngest was 20 when it was filmed.)  Of these, Stockard Channing performed best, followed by Didi Conn and Jeff Conaway.  Eve Arden and Dody Goodman work very well together in the film.  The most memorable scenes in the film include Sandy meeting the Pink Ladies & finding Danny, the sleep over, trips to the malt shop, the drive-in, Frenchy's dream, the school dance, the drag race and the carnival.  My ratings (out of 5 stars) for some of the songs in the film include:* ""Grease"" (4, sung by Frankie Valli.) Title song.* ""Summer Nights"" (4.5, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  On the first day of class.* ""Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At the sleep over.* ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" (5, sung by Olivia Newton-John.)  At the sleep over.* ""Sandy"" (4, sung by John Travolta.)  At the drive-in.* ""Greased Lightnin'"" (4, sung by John Travolta & the T-Birds.)  At the high school auto-mechanics shop.* ""Beauty School Dropout"" (5, sung by Frankie Avalon.)  Frenchy's dream.* ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At school.* ""You're The One That I Want"" (4, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  At the carnival.* ""We Go Together"" (4.5, sung by entire cast.)  At the carnival.""Grease"" was never intended to be a serious film.  Instead, it was intended to be a silly, fun and entertaining comedy with rock-n-roll music from the late 1950's.  Overall, I rate ""Grease"" with 4.5 (raised to 5) out of 5 stars for its fun music and great entertainment value.  Some problems plagued the release of ""Grease"" on DVD, such as the royalties lawsuit filed by Olivia Newton-John in 1998 and the need that Paramount had to blur product signs in the malt shop (which some viewers may find offensive).  The film is not perfect, but it is still a very entertaining and I highly recommend it.Following ""Grease"", Randal Kleiser went on to direct the ill-fated 1980 film ""The Blue Lagoon"" and Olivia Newton-John starred in the 1980 box-office bomb ""Xanadu"".  John Travolta went on to star in the very popular 1980 film ""Urban Cowboy"", but his acting career suffered until his role as a mobster in the 1994 film ""Pulp Fiction"" revived it.  Olivia Newton-John and Randal Kleiser worked together again on the 1996 film ""It's My Party"".",5,"""Rama Lama Lama Kadingy, Kading-a-dong!""",1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,4462,"['1971', 'writers', 'Jim', 'Jacobs', 'Warren', 'Casey', 'wrote', 'composed', 'music', 'musical', 'entitled', 'Grease', 'appeared', 'first', 'amateur', 'production', 'Chicago', 'eventually', 'went', 'NYC', 'off-Broadway', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'musical', 'Broadway', 'success', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'produced', 'film', '1978', 'direction', 'Randal', 'Kleiser', 'previous', 'directorial', 'experiences', 'had', 'been', 'primarily', 'TV', 'series', 'made-for-TV', 'films.The', 'story', 'Grease', 'simple', 'circa', '1959', 'uprooted', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'Australia', 'Sandy', 'Olsson', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'meets', 'summer', 'romance', 'local', 'American', 'boy', 'Danny', 'Zuko', 'John', 'Travolta', 'end', 'summer', 'family', 'America', 'instead', 'returning', 'Australia', 'enrolled', 'local', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'Rydell', 'High', 'School', 'just', 'be', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'Danny', 'attends', 'When', 'Danny', 'persona', 'changes', 'what', 'friends', 'expect', 'cool', 'uninterested', 'practical', 'joker', 'Sandy', 'naturally', 'upset', ""n't"", 'yet', 'understand', 'dynamics', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'exclusive', 'cliques', 'T-Birds', 'guys', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'gals', 'One', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'Frenchy', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'Sandy', 'Sandy', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'who', 'include', 'Betty', 'Rizzo', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Marty', 'Maraschino', 'Dinah', 'Manoff', 'Jan', 'Jamie', 'Donnelly', 'T-Birds', 'include', 'Kenickie', 'Jeff', 'Conaway', 'Doody', 'Barry', 'Pearl', 'Sonny', 'Michael', 'Tucci', 'Putzie', 'Kelly', 'Ward', 'principal', 'Rydell', 'Principal', 'McGee', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'who', 'assisted', 'bumbling', 'Blanche', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'football', 'coach', 'Calhoun', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'auto-mechanics', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Murdock', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Vince', 'Fontaine', 'Edd', 'Byrnes', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'DiGregorio', 'Annette', 'Charles', 'older', 'malt', 'shop', 'waitress', 'Ellen', 'Travolta', 'cameo', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'Teen', 'Angel', 'musical', 'group', 'Sha', 'Na', 'Na', 'also', 'featured.Casting', 'Grease', 'be', 'issue', 'many', 'people', '25', 'years', 'average', 'age', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'T-Birds', 'including', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'was', '28', 'oldest', 'was', '34', 'youngest', 'was', '20', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'performed', 'best', 'followed', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'Jeff', 'Conaway', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'include', 'Sandy', 'meeting', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'finding', 'Danny', 'sleep', 'trips', 'malt', 'shop', 'drive-in', 'Frenchy', 'dream', 'school', 'dance', 'drag', 'race', 'carnival', 'ratings', '5', 'stars', 'songs', 'film', 'include', '*', 'Grease', '4', 'sung', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'Title', 'song', '*', 'Summer', 'Nights', '4.5', 'sung', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'John', 'Travolta', 'first', 'day', 'class', '*', 'Look', 'Me', ""'m"", 'Sandra', 'Dee', '5', 'sung', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'sleep', '*', 'Hopelessly', 'Devoted', '5', 'sung', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'sleep', '*', 'Sandy', '4', 'sung', 'John', 'Travolta', 'drive-in', '*', 'Greased', 'Lightnin', '4', 'sung', 'John', 'Travolta', 'T-Birds', 'high', 'school', 'auto-mechanics', 'shop', '*', 'Beauty', 'School', 'Dropout', '5', 'sung', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'Frenchy', 'dream', 'Are', 'Worse', 'Things', 'Could', 'Do', '5', 'sung', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'school', '*', ""'re"", 'One', 'Want', '4', 'sung', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'John', 'Travolta', 'carnival', '*', 'Go', 'Together', '4.5', 'sung', 'entire', 'cast', 'carnival', 'Grease', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'serious', 'film', 'Instead', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'silly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'rock-n-roll', 'music', 'late', '1950', 'Overall', 'rate', 'Grease', '4.5', 'raised', '5', '5', 'stars', 'fun', 'music', 'great', 'entertainment', 'value', 'problems', 'plagued', 'release', 'Grease', 'DVD', 'such', 'royalties', 'lawsuit', 'filed', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', '1998', 'need', 'Paramount', 'had', 'blur', 'product', 'signs', 'malt', 'shop', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'offensive', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Following', 'Grease', 'Randal', 'Kleiser', 'went', 'direct', 'ill-fated', '1980', 'film', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'starred', '1980', 'box-office', 'bomb', 'Xanadu', 'John', 'Travolta', 'went', 'star', 'very', 'popular', '1980', 'film', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'acting', 'career', 'suffered', 'role', 'mobster', '1994', 'film', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'revived', 'Newton-John', 'Randal', 'Kleiser', 'worked', 'together', 'again', '1996', 'film', 'My', 'Party']",N/A

To what do it owes its everlasting attraction? Maybe it's because this nostalgic musical vision of the fifties is one of those films where everything fits right into place.Without a doubt, another determinant factor that helped become this movie a classic is the great chemistry between its stars, beautiful Olivia Newton-John and the lovable and charismatic John Travolta.Grease is the store of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsen, two teenagers that share a summer fling and upon the end of their vacation, go separate ways. Fate brings them together when sandy is transferred to the same high school Danny goes to. He's the typical adolescent, good looking, cocky and with a bad boy image. She's sweet, innocent and nave, but not boring. She wears pink and is the antithesis of the girls on Danny's school.These two are as different as day and night, and along their friends will live turbulent and funny moments, typical of adolescence, until get that happy ending we expect in romantic movies.A musical lives or dies because of its soundtrack, and it's here where Grease shines thoroughly. The catchy songs, the always optimistic lyrics and the choreography spread rhythm with more power than a virus. The film, thank God, has been digitally restored and remastered. In Grease there is not one boring moment. It's a continuous celebration to the 50's pop culture, to adolescence, with the gracious touch of a director who knew how to conjure pure energy on the screen.

She declined, saying she was looking for more mature roles, what an idiot! Allen Carr (producer) met Olivia at a dinner party and decided she  WAS Sandy, Grease was already in production, so they changed the role of  Sandy to fit Livvy's aussie accent. Can you also imagine this film without  the songs, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted&quot; and &quot;Your The One That I  Want&quot;? These songs came about when Olivia was hired and her  songwriter, John Farrar, wrote those 2 songs for the movie. Originally,  these songs would not have been in this movie if not for Olivia. Can you  imagine how boring this movie would be without those 2 songs? The original  broadway play does not include these songs, and well, YAWN is the best  description I can think of. Travolta cried that Olivia has these 2 great  songs and he didn't have a solo to sing, afraid he would be upstaged by  Olivia. So, the producers wrote &quot;Sandy&quot; just for him. That song  originally was not to be in the film either had John not had a temper  tantrum. I can't imagine GREASE without these songs or Olivia. So why does  everyone give John top billing in the credits when Olivia is the charm  behind Grease? Olivia recently filed a lawsuit because she isn't getting  her share of Grease millions.

The reason it's the best part is because every time Danny and Sandy break up with each other they either sing or cry back to each other. To me it's a sad part. When Danny tried to kiss Sandy in the drive-inmovie, Sandy got out of the car and ran off. Danny ran after her but he couldn't find her. So he started singing a song called ""Sandy"", singing that he was lonely.Another interesting part in Grease is the prom night. On the prom night Danny and Sandy were dance partners. When Sonny and Rita came to the prom. Sonny grabbed Sandy when she was dancing with Danny. Danny kept dancing and went to grab Sandy. Rita grabbed Danny and started dancing with him. Sandy left the party. Danny and Rita won the trophy, but Danny was hurt because after they won the trophy, they had to slow dance together. Danny wanted to win with Sandy.The last part of Grease I'm going to tell you about is when the teenagers went out on their dates. Danny and Sandy were dating while Kenichie and Betty were on their date. While Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty were dancing, Danny and Sandy had snuck in. They sat at a table and put the menus up so no one would come over. The waitress came over to take their order. Danny ordered a bunch of food. Sandy ordered the same. Danny asked her if she was going to eat all of that. Doody came over there, then Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty came and crowded Danny and Sandy. Danny was disappointed because he wanted to be alone on their date. Kenichie and Betty got into an argument with Kenichie because he put his arm around Frenchy.

Despite the recent success of Moulin Rouge, there is little to suggest that this genre will be making any sort of comeback.  Whatever the factors that killed the musical, Grease was not one of them:  this was a fun movie when it came out and continues to be fun nowadays.  (My guess is that that other late seventies musical, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, bears a greater responsibility for the faltering of the genre.)Like any musical, success at first hinges on the music, and this one has some great tunes.  Secondly, however, it must have a good story, and this one, simple as it is, suffices:  the tale of Danny and Sandy, two high-school students in love despite their obvious differences, is just enough to keep things moving.There are flaws: the flow of time is inconsistent; it seems to take place over a few weeks, but it actually winds up taking a whole school year.  Also, Sandy's transformation in the end from saintly to slutty in an effort to win Danny, while possibly necessary from a plot standpoint, is also more than a little sexist...I don't demand political correctness out of movies, but this ""lesson"" does stand out as a bit demeaning.These are quibbles, however, and overall, this is a good movie.

It's the seventies slant on fifties pop culture and it moves like gangbusters. The songs are ""electrifying"" and the energy generated by all of the cast members is ""greased lightning"". Unfortunately, Paramount has given us the film in a really lack luster edition that is doomed to disappoint from the start. The print, although restored, exhibits grain, dirt and digital grit, along with aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement problems that really distract from the presentation of this film. There's also a couple of curiosities. Watch for the scenes that take place at the malt shop between Danny and Sandy. All the background ads (presumably Coke or Pepsi advertising) has been digitally altered or blurred so that it can't be made out. Like the Warner release of ""The Devil's Advocate"" one can only assume that whatever was hanging on those walls, Paramount did not own the rights to and was thus forced to do some digital manipulation to satisfy a law suit before releasing the movie to home video. The manipulations are obvious and horrible, drawing attention to themselves with aliasing, hard edges or halos appearing around characters as they walk back and forth in front of the obscured art work. The audio has also not been well represented. Dialogue is strident, scratchy and soft while the musical numbers explode from the 5.1 mix with too much bass and side channel information that drowns out the lyrics represented in the center channel of one's home theater system. Extras? - true to its penny pinching, Paramount gives us the same old tired featurette that accompanied its laserdisc release. That's it.

Now Sandy wants nothing to do with him and forms a friendship with some off the wall pink ladies and one night, Rizzo goes off and sleeps with kenicky ( spelling? ) and gets pregnant and later in the movie this becomes a big thing at a drive in. And so the story goes with Danny and Sandy going through ups and downs of a relationship, and then singing about them, and I have to say that the end still gives me goose bumps.

127279,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,0792148061,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[0, 0]","When the idea for making a motion picture version of ""Grease"" was approved by the moguls at Paramount back in 1977 the studio gave producers Robert Stigwood and Allan Carr a budget of $6,000,000 to complete the project.  The conventional wisdom in Hollywood was that the film would generate lots of enthusiasm initially, make a neat profit and gradually fade away as the vast majority of films do.  No one could have ever predicted the magnitude of the hit they would have on their hands.  ""Grease""  opened in over 800 theaters on March 27, 1978.  The critics were not that impressed but audiences loved it.  They still do. Not only would ""Grease"" become the top grossing motion picture of 1978 but when all was said and done ""Grease"" would become the highest grossing movie musical of all-time with a worldwide gross of some $387,000,000!I think the main reason that ""Grease"" has remained so popular over the decades is that it truly is a fun movie.  There are so many films out there featuring blood and guts that a film like ""Grease"" is a welcome oasis for many of us.  This is a film that features a fabulous musical score, innovative choreography and a remarkable chemistry among the members of a highly talented cast.  Everyone seemed to love the performances by the film's two stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Travolta loved the stage play and lobbied hard to play the part of Danny Zuko in the film.  Meanwhile, Olivia Newton-John was intrigued when offered the role of Sandy by the producers but insisted on a screen test to make sure she was right for the role.  As it turned out she was just perfect.  The chemistry between these two and their enthusiasm for this project is quite apparent from the very first scene in the film.  Meanwhile,  Jeff Conaway, who played Danny Zuko in the Broadway production of ""Grease""  adds his considerable talent to the mix in the role of Danny's best buddy Kenickie.  And let us not forget the noteworthy contributions of  Stockyard Channing and Didi Conn in the roles of Rizzo and Frenchy.  Finally, the producers added to the appeal of this film by including several 1950's icons in the cast including Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell and Fannie Flagg.  It was a nice touch.I think most folks would agree that what makes ""Grease"" so doggone appealing  is the sensational  music.  The film spawned four Top Five singles in 1978 including ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"", ""Summer Lovin"" and the #1 smash ""You're The One That I Want"".  At the same time the soundtrack LP was a monster hit as well.  Other notable tunes from the film include Stockyard Channing's surprisingly powerful ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do"",  John Travolta's ""Sandy"" and 50's teen idol Frankie Avalon (playing a teen angel) doing""Beauty School Dropout"".  The film concludes with the entire cast  cut loose at an amusement park singing ""We Go Together"".  I enjoy these tunes just as much today as I did  then!  Furthermore,  I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredibly innovative animated open to this flick that goes a long way in getting viewers in the proper frame of mind  to enjoy what follows.More than 30 years after it's release ""Grease"" continues to delight audiences of all ages.  It possesses a universal appeal that is rare in motion pictures these days.  In addition, it is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.

The movie is a long time favorite thanks to countless airings on television that constantly brought in new fans of the movie who weren't even born when the movie was released in 1978.  Adapting the immensely popular Broadway show to the big screen brought forth some changes. The theater production had a raunchier edge to it with much more overt sexual nature. The film tones that side quite a bit, but it makes up for it in sheer exuberance.  John Travolta was the hottest star in Hollywood at the time with the success of Saturday Night Fever on the big screen and Welcome Back Kotter on television.  He is perfectly cast as Danny Zuko, the likable greaser and leader of the T-Birds who falls for the wholesome Sandy Olsen played by Olivia Newton-John in her big screen debut.  Ms. Newton-John can clearly handle the singing side of the role, but her acting and dancing are suspect at best.  Jeff Conaway adds the right amount of toughness as Kenicke and Stockard Channing is excellent as Rizzo, the tough as nails head of the Pink Ladies (Ms. Channing's singing is better than Ms. Newton-John's acting, but not by much and seems oddly out of place as a teenager).  The films is full of actors and singers who were popular in the 50's like Frankie Avalon, Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes and Eve Arden.

127294,A2FW4V0UWDQ0U8,0792148061,R. Delmedico,"[10, 34]","The worship of this movie must cease.First of all, I don't even think they deserved to use the name ""Grease"" since it bears so little similarity to the Broadway show.  Missing from the movie are lovable characters Doody and Roger, replaced by a hybrid of the two named Putsy, who basically sits in the background for the entire show.  The two deleted character's songs?  ""Those Magic Changes"" basically becomes a background tune at the prom, and I have no idea (can't remember) what happens to ""Mooning"", but both songs completely lose their luster outside their original environments.  It also results in the deletion of one of the best scenes in the whole play, where Roger proclaims himself the Mooning Champion of Rydell high.Also deleted from the movie--""Alone at the Drive-in Movie"", reduced to an instrumental.  It was a funny, goofy tune, that fit in well with the parodical nature of the original show.  It is replaced by the 70's sounding ""Sandy"", which is too overdramatic and overwrought for that scene. The funny ""Alma Mater"" is reduced to background music in the opening scenes.  ""Look at Me, I'm SAndra Dee"" is moved way too far up in the show, in a really nonsensical part of the movie.  it originally came at the end of the first act in the play, which made more sense.And, worst of all, Greased Lightning is sung by Zuko, and not Kenickie, like in the play.  This makes little sense.  Zuko singing about Kenickie's car?  The idea behind the original song was that Greased Lightning was a pile of crap that only Kenickie believed in, and got scoffed at for, so his song was him vowing to turn it into a champ.Alright, but changes aside, how is the movie?Again, not great.  Scenes dragged on aimlessly for too long. Danny trying out for sports could have been easily cut down by 3 minutes or so.  The gag wore thin.  The prom's length was okay, but very boring, and basically a vehicle for Travolta to show off his dancing.  Yes, in the play, it's a big ""dance"" scene too, but it is way too straightforward in the movie to be all that enjoyable.Rizzo's ""serious"" scene is pretty much lost in the movie since it's pointlessly taken to the drive-in and tossed aside minutes later, rather than being done at the later party like in the play, and being a somewhat emotional scene.So many of the funniest scenes are deleted from the original play.  And even the melodrama is removed.  The funny parts aren't funny enough, the serious parts are too overdramatic for what this body of work really was--a parody of 50's culture, music, and life.Moreso, all of the ""high schoolers"" in the movie looked about 30 years old.  Most of them could not pass for high schoolers even with makeup and costuming.  Sonny looked almost 35. Perhaps if they had done a better job of wardrobe and makeup this would have been avoided.Overall, I think the only decent part ofthis movie is ""Greased Lightning"" for it's dance moves.  Other than that, this is a soulless remake of a great show that doesn't do the original justice.P.S. I'm playing Roger now in a local performance of Grease.

Being so, advice on film quality is really more important that a review of the movie, so let me say, that the DVD sound is not improved over the videotape, other than the general DVD over video quality one expects. Don't let the hype about redigitized or whatever hook you.Also, understand the difference between full-screen and wide-screen. Full-screen means it will fill your entire TV screen. Since movies are broader left to right than TV screens ""full-screen"" movies have been ""panned & scanned."" In other words, You see just part of the screen at once. ""Wide-screen"" means the whole picture is shown, with black lines at top and bottom.Most people have a preference for one or the other. It's important to remember in the big choreography numbers that the panned & scanned versions are showing just half of the dancing. So be aware of what you're getting, especially if tou're buying used.Now you can read my review of the content.The ages of the actors in this film is obvious, and I personally found this really distracting. In a stage production, you can get away with casting 28-year olds as teenagers-- you can even get away with casting short adults as children sometimes. But this doesn't work in movies. --especially in a disturbing close-up of Olivia Newton-John's back teeth, as she milks one last ""Su-uuuuu-mer Lo-ooooo-ve!"" for all it's worth, but nevermind.The actors were so obviously ten years too old to be in high school, that this added an unintentional extra layer to the film; it this really a fantasy of adults going back ten years to fix things in the past? This time Danny offers to drive, and Greased Lightning wins? This time Sandy finds the kishkas to change? This time Rizzo's not pregnant? Time Frenchy goes back to school? The overabundance of happy endings and the magic car in the closing shot left me wondering.And Sandy at the end of the film? Sure, it might be time to shed the poodle skirts and pastel sweaters, but does she have to look like a 42nd & Broadway hooker? Isn't there a happy medium? And is ""learn to smoke and dress like a slut in order to get the guy you want"" really such a great message for the sweetness & light movie of 1978?Well, anyway. sellers have lots of cheap used copies, the price of which is probably worth Stockard Channing's performance. Olivia Newton-John is a singer who can't act, and most of the rest of the cast is actors who sing passably. Stockard Channing is the only really substantial actor in the film (she's won some awards for her work on stage), and she's the only performer who comes through with a genuine character as opposed to a type-- although that may not be a fair criticism, since the script has a cartoon quality that suggests two-dimensional, broad, melodramatic types. Channing is also the only performer hired primarily for her acting who also can belt out a song.My two stars are for her.",2,Grecian Formula,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,2967,"['suppose', 'buying', 'audience', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Being', 'so', 'advice', 'film', 'quality', 'really', 'more', 'important', 'review', 'movie', 'so', 'let', 'say', 'DVD', 'sound', 'not', 'improved', 'videotape', 'other', 'general', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'hype', 'redigitized', 'hook', 'you.Also', 'understand', 'difference', 'full-screen', 'wide-screen', 'Full-screen', 'will', 'fill', 'entire', 'TV', 'screen', 'movies', 'are', 'broader', 'left', 'right', 'TV', 'screens', 'full-screen', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'panned', 'scanned', 'other', 'words', 'see', 'just', 'part', 'screen', 'once', 'Wide-screen', 'whole', 'picture', 'shown', 'black', 'lines', 'top', 'bottom.Most', 'people', 'have', 'preference', 'one', 'other', 'important', 'remember', 'big', 'choreography', 'numbers', 'panned', 'scanned', 'versions', 'are', 'showing', 'just', 'half', 'dancing', 'So', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'especially', 'tou', ""'re"", 'buying', 'can', 'read', 'review', 'content.The', 'ages', 'actors', 'film', 'obvious', 'personally', 'found', 'really', 'distracting', 'stage', 'production', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'casting', '28-year', 'olds', 'teenagers', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'away', 'casting', 'short', 'adults', 'children', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'work', 'movies', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'close-up', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'back', 'teeth', 'one', 'last', 'Su-uuuuu-mer', 'Lo-ooooo-ve', 'worth', 'nevermind.The', 'actors', 'were', 'so', 'obviously', 'ten', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'added', 'unintentional', 'extra', 'layer', 'film', 'really', 'fantasy', 'adults', 'going', 'back', 'ten', 'years', 'fix', 'things', 'past', 'time', 'Danny', 'offers', 'drive', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'wins', 'time', 'Sandy', 'kishkas', 'change', 'time', 'Rizzo', 'not', 'pregnant', 'Time', 'Frenchy', 'back', 'school', 'overabundance', 'happy', 'endings', 'magic', 'car', 'closing', 'shot', 'left', 'wondering.And', 'Sandy', 'end', 'film', 'Sure', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'shed', 'poodle', 'skirts', 'pastel', 'sweaters', 'have', 'look', '42nd', 'Broadway', 'hooker', ""n't"", 'happy', 'medium', 'learn', 'smoke', 'dress', 'slut', 'order', 'get', 'guy', 'want', 'really', 'such', 'great', 'message', 'sweetness', 'light', 'movie', '1978', 'Well', 'anyway', 'sellers', 'have', 'lots', 'cheap', 'used', 'copies', 'price', 'probably', 'worth', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'performance', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'singer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'sing', 'passably', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'only', 'really', 'substantial', 'actor', 'film', 'won', 'awards', 'work', 'stage', 'only', 'performer', 'who', 'genuine', 'character', 'opposed', 'type', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'criticism', 'script', 'cartoon', 'quality', 'two-dimensional', 'broad', 'melodramatic', 'types', 'Channing', 'also', 'only', 'performer', 'hired', 'primarily', 'acting', 'who', 'also', 'can', 'belt', 'out', 'song.My', 'two', 'stars', 'are']",N/A

Powers ""show maniac""","[5, 6]","The movie version of ""Grease"" is the perfect summer movie, light,breezy,cheerful and maybe just a tad too squeeky clean for its'own good.  The original Broadway show took place in 1972 and was the 10 year reunion of the class of Rydell High.  The alumni do an extended sketch to show how they were in 1962.  This concept neatly explains the advanced ages of the players.The movie played it as a straight teenage musical and the Pink Ladies and the Burger Palace Boys(the boy gang original name) were all portrayed by actors well into their twenties with the exception of Stockard Channing who was uncomfortably nearing 40.This explains why the critics originally were luke-warm or knocked the film.(The age problem) but the critics on Broadway wern't kind either-it was the audiences that loved it.  The original show was also heavily laced with obscenities, mostly the f-bomb, which made perfect sense since the story was about a group of kids in their own little cliques who were trying to act tough and cool. The big joke was that beneath the thuggish and slutty behavior and potty mouths these wannabe juvenile delinquents were really nice-just adolescents starting to flex their wings. Another important difference between the original show was Rydell High was an inner-city midwestern school, and the movie version of the school was located somewhere in sunny California, probably Malibu.Each subsequent stage version of ""Grease"" has been sanitized like the movie and while that doesn't detract from the high energy fun it loses the high energy but grit of the original.The movie though was loaded with a slew of goodies--the peaches and cream beauty of Olivia Newton John, John Travolta in his prime and some well staged musical numbers including the ""Born To Hand-Jive"" prom number, ""Beauty School Dropout"" ""Summer Nights"" ""We Go Together""(the original stage version of ""We Go Together"" was sexually explicit and you wouldn't believe what was going on during the refrain, Boogie Boogie,Booglia etc) and ""Greased Lightnin"" which surprisingly retains the racy lyrics from the 1972 show considering the almost simon-pure innocense of the rest of the movie.I am only pointing out the difference in tone and attitude of the original from the movie but I enjoyed the film in 1978 and I still enjoy it in 2006 but it is just not the same as it was in 1972 and wowed audiences on Broadway for over eight years.So this movie is still a great watch on a ""Summer Night"".",5,THE PERFECT SUMMER MOVIE,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2467,"['movie', 'version', 'Grease', 'perfect', 'summer', 'movie', 'light', 'breezy', 'cheerful', 'maybe', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'squeeky', 'clean', ""its'own"", 'good', 'original', 'Broadway', 'show', 'took', 'place', '1972', 'was', '10', 'year', 'reunion', 'class', 'Rydell', 'High', 'alumni', 'do', 'extended', 'sketch', 'show', 'how', 'were', '1962', 'concept', 'neatly', 'advanced', 'ages', 'players.The', 'movie', 'played', 'straight', 'teenage', 'musical', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'Burger', 'Palace', 'Boys', 'boy', 'gang', 'original', 'name', 'were', 'portrayed', 'actors', 'well', 'twenties', 'exception', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'was', 'uncomfortably', 'nearing', '40.This', 'explains', 'why', 'critics', 'originally', 'were', 'luke-warm', 'knocked', 'film', 'age', 'problem', 'critics', 'Broadway', 'wer', ""n't"", 'kind', 'either-it', 'was', 'audiences', 'loved', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'heavily', 'laced', 'obscenities', 'mostly', 'f-bomb', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'story', 'was', 'group', 'kids', 'own', 'little', 'cliques', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'act', 'tough', 'cool', 'big', 'joke', 'was', 'thuggish', 'slutty', 'behavior', 'potty', 'mouths', 'wannabe', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'were', 'really', 'nice-just', 'adolescents', 'starting', 'flex', 'wings', 'important', 'difference', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'Rydell', 'High', 'was', 'inner-city', 'midwestern', 'school', 'movie', 'version', 'school', 'was', 'located', 'somewhere', 'sunny', 'California', 'probably', 'Malibu.Each', 'subsequent', 'stage', 'version', 'Grease', 'been', 'sanitized', 'movie', ""n't"", 'detract', 'high', 'energy', 'fun', 'high', 'energy', 'grit', 'original.The', 'movie', 'was', 'loaded', 'slew', 'goodies', 'peaches', 'cream', 'beauty', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'John', 'Travolta', 'prime', 'well', 'staged', 'musical', 'numbers', 'including', 'Born', 'Hand-Jive', 'prom', 'number', 'Beauty', 'School', 'Dropout', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'Go', 'Together', 'original', 'stage', 'version', 'Go', 'Together', 'was', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'refrain', 'Boogie', 'Boogie', 'Booglia', 'etc', 'Greased', 'Lightnin', 'surprisingly', 'racy', 'lyrics', '1972', 'show', 'considering', 'almost', 'simon-pure', 'innocense', 'rest', 'movie.I', 'am', 'only', 'pointing', 'out', 'difference', 'tone', 'attitude', 'original', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'film', '1978', 'still', 'enjoy', '2006', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'was', '1972', 'wowed', 'audiences', 'Broadway', 'eight', 'years.So', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'Summer', 'Night']",N/A

With some musicals, the songs aren't very appealing when heard outside the context of the musical itself because they are theatrical by nature or they rely on the stage action for comprehension. (See ""West Side Story"" or ""Miss Saigon"") For the most part, this is not the case with ""Grease,"" whose songs are perfectly capable of standing alone. This is also helped by the fact some songs from the stage version were dropped from the movie and additional songs were written for the movie. We all know the story by now: greaser Danny and squeaky clean Sandy meet and fall in love over the summer, then say goodbye. Both are surprised to see one another at school in the fall and try to change in order to fit the image of the other's ideal. Aside from the fantastic songs, the film is elevated by some very good, enthusiastic performances by John Travolta, the gorgeous Olivia Newton-John and Didi Conn, among others. The stage musical's youthful exuberance carries over to the film as well, even though some of the actors appear a trifle too old to play high school students. (See Michael Tucci and Stockard Channing for two examples)  This is essentially a musical for folks who don't normally like musicals.

I love the packaging.  This film is available in Widescreen (2.35:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) editions...  This film is packaged like a book (like the Panic Room) with the disc inside with a GREASE Songbook, which I though was a real hoot.  I have always wanted the lyrics to all ot most of the songs from the film....With this film being finally available on DVD, the menu board and scene selction and audio options are quite basic.  The film on Widescreen or Fullscreen are presented in top notch sound and picture quality with not much dirt or dust to be found.  The sound could have been better cause it was a bit loud and scratchy at times when it didn't need to be.  There are cast and cast interviews originally contained in the 1998 VHS release and of course, the theatrical trailer which was exciting to watch.In conclusion, GREASE is greatly welcomed on DVD with its great packaging and available feautures but this DVD deserved much more extra feautures than what was put in here.

The season is ending, however, and they say their goodbyes, wondering if they will ever meet again.  This being Hollywood, of course they will!Over at Rydell High on the first day of school, Danny is hanging out with his friends and fellow members of the T-Birds, a ""gang"" that likes to race cars and wear black leather jackets.  Meanwhile, the Pink Ladies, the most popular girls in school and the female equivalent of the T-Birds, led by Rizzo (Stockard Channing), have discovered that Danny's summer love is still in town and Sandy is attending Rydell.  Instead of the happy and loving reunion that Sandy envisioned, Danny puts up his tough-guy, cool persona and in the process, loses the girl. Sandy cries on the Pink Ladies' shoulders (amid Rizzo's sneers - - apparently Danny and Rizzo had a ""thing"" pre-Sandy), takes up with a jock (Lorenzo Lamas in an early role), dumps the jock to run back to Danny, who is attempting athleticism to impress her, goes to the school dance with Danny, is overthrown by the bodacious Cha-Cha, who used to date Danny, breaks up with Danny again, only to decide at the conclusion that in order to win her bad boy, she must sully her good girl reputation, tease her hair and pour herself into a skintight black leather jumpsuit.The plot is fairly nonsensical and all the actors look as though they would be teachers or members of the PTA, rather than actual high school students, but the music rocks!  The musical numbers are fun and catchy and simply MAKE this movie.

The story sounds cheesy, but the movie is timeless, as a whole new generation of viewers have come to love it thanks to the DVD and blueray market. The soundtrack is equally good with songs like ""You're The One That I Want"", ""Sandy"", ""Grease"", and ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"". Marie Osmond was offered the part of Sandy, but turned it down when she realized Sandy was going to become a so-called ""bad girl"", in which she was depicted as a smoker with large hair wearing a tight black outfit.

The storyline is classic and transcends time as the underlying message hits the core of every teenager.Danny Zuko puts his ""tough boy"" act behind him as he shares a wholesome summer romance with Australian, Sandy Olsen. When summer ends, the two believe they're going their separate ways until Sandy's parents decide to stay in America and she ends up in his high school.As the two share their summer romance stories with their friends we see that Danny has reverted back to his old ways as he sensationalizes the romance by turning it into something sleazy and slutty. And Sandy over dramatizes the romance by making it appear to be a love-affair right out of the movies. Then bam, the two meet!Sandy's excited to see Danny again and believes their summer romance can continue where it has left off, but Danny--unwilling to show a softer side to his fellow greasers--discounts the romance as nothing more than a summer fling and treats Sandy badly.Sandy, choosing to move on with her life, begins to date a more wholesome guy but her heart yearns for Danny. Danny, on the other hand, discovers that he cannot live without Sandy so he tries to break into her world while still trying to live in his own. In the end, it's Sandy who breaks into Danny's world and Danny who discovers that it's okay to show a softer side--for the right reasons.Aside from Danny and Sandy's romance story, there are sub-plots that manage to mingle beautifully with the main storyline--teenagers trying to find their places in the world, girls looking for the men of their dreams, boys trying to get to third base, gossiping, and even a pregnancy scare.There is, however, lots of raunchy sexual innuendos that probably wouldn't make the cut in today's PG-13 ratings so tread lighting with kids under 13--heck stick to kids 16 and above!

The image boost of the DVD image makes this alteration particularly clear.

127372,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,0792148061,William,"[0, 0]","My review refers to the Australian 2-Disc DVD which is essentially the same as the US edition:The first disc contain the movie with apparently a new digital remastered transfer of the film. I cannot notice much difference to the previous DVD version except it seems more compressed this time round. The DVD still only features a the 5.1 soundtrack which is problematic. The dance hall scene is where this is noticeably an issue. For example, ""Hound Dog"" and ""Born to Hand Jive"" both sound echoey and tinny, with very little use of bass. Also, the surround speakers are rarely utilised. I wonder why they just didn't put the original stereo mix in. I dislike 5.1 mixes applied to original stereo mixes. The first disc also contains an audio commentary by the director, and also the option to do a sing-a-long with the movie, or just with the music scenes.Disc 2 contains the remainder of the special features. At first glance, these look impressive but once you start watching them you realise they could have been so much more. The main reason I purchased this new DVD was to get the 'deleted and alternate' scenes. Unfortunately, these were all black and white. According to the 'Director's introduction' to these, they are not available in colour (which doesn't make sense as they were filmed that way, perhaps film stock has deteriorated). More importantly, these scenes add little value to the die hard fan as they really are quite short or just expanded on what we have already seen. I was very disappointed overall with these deleted scenes. I would have liked to see the additional beach scenes of which some can be seen in the movie trailer.Other special features include:- Remembering Grease (20 minute or so retrospective which interesting, and was compiled for this new DVD. It contains some rare footage, which was also included in previous DVD);- 2002 DVD Launch Party (this was quite good for the footage of John and Olivia performing on stage. Poor John could hardly remember the words to Summer Nights which was funny);- John and Olivia remembering Grease (this is really just extra footage from the 2002 DVD Launch party and only runs for about 2 minutes);- 1978 interview with Alan Carr and John Travolta (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);- 1978 interview with Robert Stigwood and Olivia (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);- Moves behind the dance sequences (a segment with original choreographer which shows some rare behind the scenes footage. Quite good);- Hairstyles from the film (a segment with hairdresser who shows how the hair styles were put together. Very little interest to me but other people may like it);- Original trailer (seen before on previous DVD).So, is the new special edition worth purchasing? Well, depends on whether you are a die-hard fan or not. The lack of inclusion of the original stereo soundtrack is a big omission. The deleted scenes add little value to the package. The other extras are like other DVD's ... you'll watch once, maybe twice. It would have been useful to include the original 1978 TV special which was put together by Alan Carr to promote Grease ... a lost opportunity.Rent first before buying.",3,DVD Special Edition,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,3259,"['review', 'refers', 'Australian', '2-Disc', 'DVD', 'essentially', 'same', 'US', 'edition', 'first', 'disc', 'contain', 'movie', 'apparently', 'new', 'digital', 'remastered', 'transfer', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'previous', 'DVD', 'version', 'more', 'compressed', 'time', 'round', 'DVD', 'still', 'only', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'problematic', 'dance', 'hall', 'scene', 'where', 'noticeably', 'issue', 'example', 'Hound', 'Dog', 'Born', 'Hand', 'Jive', 'sound', 'echoey', 'tinny', 'very', 'little', 'use', 'bass', 'Also', 'surround', 'speakers', 'are', 'rarely', 'utilised', 'wonder', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'original', 'stereo', 'mix', 'dislike', '5.1', 'mixes', 'applied', 'original', 'stereo', 'mixes', 'first', 'disc', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'also', 'option', 'do', 'sing-a-long', 'movie', 'just', 'music', '2', 'remainder', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'glance', 'look', 'impressive', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'realise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'main', 'reason', 'purchased', 'new', 'DVD', 'was', 'get', ""'deleted"", 'alternate', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'According', ""'Director"", 'introduction', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'colour', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'were', 'filmed', 'way', 'perhaps', 'film', 'stock', 'deteriorated', 'More', 'importantly', 'scenes', 'add', 'little', 'value', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'really', 'are', 'quite', 'short', 'just', 'expanded', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'additional', 'beach', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'trailer.Other', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Remembering', 'Grease', '20', 'minute', 'so', 'retrospective', 'interesting', 'was', 'compiled', 'new', 'DVD', 'rare', 'footage', 'was', 'also', 'included', 'previous', 'DVD', '2002', 'DVD', 'Launch', 'Party', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'footage', 'John', 'Olivia', 'performing', 'stage', 'Poor', 'John', 'could', 'hardly', 'remember', 'words', 'Summer', 'Nights', 'was', 'funny', 'John', 'Olivia', 'remembering', 'Grease', 'really', 'just', 'extra', 'footage', '2002', 'DVD', 'Launch', 'party', 'only', '2', 'minutes', '1978', 'interview', 'Alan', 'Carr', 'John', 'Travolta', 'good', 'cut', 'short', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'include', 'interview', 'entirety', '1978', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'Olivia', 'good', 'cut', 'short', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'include', 'interview', 'entirety', 'Moves', 'dance', 'sequences', 'segment', 'original', 'choreographer', 'rare', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Quite', 'good', 'film', 'segment', 'hairdresser', 'who', 'how', 'hair', 'styles', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'Very', 'little', 'interest', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'like', 'Original', 'trailer', 'seen', 'previous', 'DVD', '.So', 'new', 'special', 'edition', 'purchasing', 'Well', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'not', 'lack', 'inclusion', 'original', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'big', 'omission', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'little', 'value', 'package', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'other', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'maybe', 'twice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'useful', 'include', 'original', '1978', 'TV', 'special', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Alan', 'Carr', 'promote', 'Grease', 'lost', 'opportunity.Rent', 'first', 'buying']",N/A

Growing up has made me realize a LOT of good things about maturity, and one of them is the fact that this really is a bad movie. The acting is mediocre, if not bad, and the story is crap! I would say that is high school, there is a LOT to fret over, but not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing! Leave that to an obnoxious John Hughes film! Some of the music really is intellegently written, and the singing isn't too bad either, the I just have to say, that it does not deliver anymore. I would like to say I am a big fan, as I was ten years ago, but watching it recently, I realized that this movie was utter crap, and I cringe at it. Especially John Travolta, more like John Revolta!-or just plain revolting!

Saw the movie when I was 8, was given the soundtrack on vinyl (as well as Saturday Nite Fever) for christmas.  Played it on my ladybug turntable, and sang along to every song with my friends, 1978.  The only way to truely watch Grease is on ""full screen"".  U just can't enjoy it any other way.  I bought it on widescreen and was totally horrified.  It just doesn't have that same effect.  I later purchased the full screen edition, and again I was in Grease heaven.  Grease is one of the best movies of all time.  Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are fantastic.  This is John Travolta's best movie to date, I don't care what anybody says.  Grease will make u laugh, sing and cry.  it is just an all around, feel good movie that cannot be compared to any other.  Ask yourself this, what would you rather watch, Grease or Gone With The Wind?  It's a no brainer, Grease is the word.  I worked with Stockard Channing once and I just had to tell her I loved her in Grease and that it was an honour to work with her.  At least I got to tell one of the cast members how much I love the movie and how people still remember it to this day.
