When I first saw it a couple of months ago, I thought it was just a promotional poster.  But no, sure enough, they used this awful design for the box.  I can't complain about the smaller size because at least the height's the same as seasons 3 and 4, and there is only 4 discs in this collection as opposed to the typical 6.Now to my original observation, it just doesn't work.  I found myself watching the first half of this season thinking, ""Why did they do this to this show?""  Anyone who's watched ALIAS up to this point knows that the first two seasons were absolutely fantastic, season 3 was a disaster, and season 4 was all but pointless.  More of the same from season 4 here.  New characters introduced who have an interest factor of zero.  I enjoy Balthazar Getty as an actor, but by episode 6, I realized I still had no idea what his character's name was.  Perhaps worst of all, the Irina Derevko plot line was down right insulting to any faithful follower of the show down the years.  How do you just change a character's persona like that when you were clearly shooting for the exact opposite in previous seasons?  Sometimes ""shock value"" has a price.There are many other dynamics I'd discuss but I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the fifth season.  Some may like it, and it does semi-redeem itself post-episode 100.  But to me, all in all, seasons 3 through 5 never lived up to the first two installments and that's a shame because those two years were TV at its finest.  Too bad J.J. Abrams moved on to LOST and MI: 3.

Part of the problem is that the season ended soon after it got on track. The normal 22 episode season was shortened to 17 episodes to take into account Jennifer Garner's pregnancy.The writing on the show has always been its high point and this season was no exception. A new global conspiracy was launced with Prophet Five and new characters entered as old ones departed. Some of the Sydney/Vaughn chemistry was lost as Michael Vartan went on hiatus from the show. The additions of agents Thomas Grace (Balthazar Getty) and Rachel Gibson(Rachel Nichols) were welcome if not exactly fleshed out. Amy Acker joined the case as villian Kelly Peyton and was perhaps the brightest light this season.As always the show was a welcome diversion and this season like the others is fun escapism. The season is presented on four discs. The picture and sound quality are excellent. The extras feature four commentaries that are more fun than useful.

The last few episodes of the show are excellent. I loved the finale, even though my absolute favorite character died. What a way to go, though--out with a bang! I also loved the way Sloane finally got what he deserved--in a way I never imagined, and that enough of the story was left open so that we could still imagine what our favorite characters would be up to if the story continued.

1010206,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B000H5V8D6,Charity Bishop,"[0, 2]","The fifth and final season of Alias solved most if not all of the questions fans have had from the dynamic very first episode of one of the most popular spy dramas on television. The writers had a difficult task in attempting to work around their leading lady's pregnancy, and the result is a surprisingly good final season, the finest episodes being those just before the powerful and shocking conclusion.Weeks after the car accident that brought about the abduction and eventual murder of her fiance Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is determined to bring down the organization that has left her child without a father. Pregnant with her first child and with more questions than answers, her investigation leads her to Prophet Five, a global terrorist organization determined to bring about the end times prophecies of a seventeenth century prophet and alchemist by the name of Milo Rambaldi. Recruiting the assistance of her formidable father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), Vaughn's best friend Eric Weiss (Greg Grunberg), and tech wizard Marshell Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Sydney begins to unravel the network of espionage surrounding the legends of Rambaldi as their enemies work against them to infiltrate APO.As Sydney's half sister Nadia (Ma Maestro) lies unconscious in the hospital, her supervisor  Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) desperately seeks a cure for his daughter's illness. Reinstated to a position of authority within the Central Intelligence Agency after his presumed betrayal of the nation, he is left in the hands of blackmailers, who desire him to sabotage as many field operations as he can, in exchange for a cure. In the meantime, Sydney has located and recruited the intelligent and talented Rachel (Rachel Nichols) from an elite criminal organization very much like SD-6. As Sydney approaches the birth of her child, and mourns the loss of the man she loved, her relationship with her father strengthens, and unexpected faces reenter her life.Unraveling the tangle of clues, double-identities, and plot twists that make up Alias on the whole, much less an explosive final season, is nearly impossible, as new faces are introduced and the audience says farewell to others. This could have been a horrific final season with the cast's limitations, particularly considering Garner's unexpected pregnancy, but the writers included it with flair and made it one of the high points of the ongoing story. It is very easy to find her scenes with the baby and particularly her dad adorable. Jack even cracks a smile or two, which is virtually unheard of in his grim view of the world. As if that's not enough, we also get a decent dose of Lena Olin as Sydney's evil mother, who can be supportive and sweet one moment, and bloodthirsty the next. There's also the appearance of show favorite Julian Sark (David Anders), a suave Brit who loves nothing more than to make money, and the presence of Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) in the 100th episode. But by far the best addition is Amy Acker as a delightfully evil villainess in high heels.Most of the series has the normal amount of violence. There are numerous explosions and many losses of lives through terrorist acts and intentional bombings. Rachel is distraught having to enter the building where she lost most of her work associates. There are numerous scenes of various torture methods, the worst being someone's hand being shot at close range, and a man having his ear sliced off. Many people are shot and killed and/or wounded, including various main characters. A woman falls through a glass table, and the impact kills her; another falls from a great height. Hand to hand combat becomes vicious between adversaries. There is very little language (maybe a half dozen mild profanities altogether) and less sensuality than previous seasons.Rachel does have a one night stand, not realizing that her chosen playmate is actually the enemy; various revealing costumes are worn, and more than once female agents approach and lure men into back rooms through the veiled promise of sex, only to knock them unconscious. There's also a supernatural aspect. Enemy agents place Sydney under a mild form of hypnosis in order to manipulate her mind and extract information from her. The CIA uses a similar tactic on a terrorist held in custody. Rambaldi's prophecies are gloom and doom, and some of them come true. A man is granted immortality through his loyalty to the cause. It is unclear whether visitations from a character who has passed on are a figment of his fractured mind or a ghost, but the implication is that it is his conscience giving illusions.There is much to like about this dynamic conclusion to a show so many of us tuned in to for five years running, wondering what new twist would be thrown our way; but on a few fronts, the scripts do seem to falter. We are never given the answers to minor plotlines that kick off the season, nor is it clear just when certain knowledge is passed on to the characters, or allegiances are changed. I guess it is with Alias as it is in life... you can never know everything that has transpired, only what you are allowed to see.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,5180,"['fifth',

1010210,A3HT7THRDLPUHH,B000H5V8D6,"D. Brunner ""tv on dvd fan""","[4, 6]","Alias quickly became my favorite television show of all time after the sensational first season. Season 2 managed to some how be even better than the first. The next two seasons dropped in quality according to most fans. So now there is the final season. Despite the fact that Jennifer Garner is pregnant and more out of the picture than she has been in any season, I felt it did a good job of bringing back some of the excitement from the first two.Having said that, I would not even put it in the same league as the first. Michael Vartan, a staple to this great show, is not in almost 90 percent of the season, Jennifer as I said takes a seat as the center of attention for at least the first half of season 5, and we get a new agent(s) who comes into the picture.Rachel Nichols plays Rachel Gibson, an agent who like Sydney from season 1, believed she was working for the CIA. Once she found the truth out, she joins Sydney and the team to work in APO. Her story line gives us a different angle to Syd's when she worked for SD-6 in S1, because unlike Sydney, Rachel was not field trained. She was also much more timid and her vulnerability was very great to watch. You see her grow as a person and become stronger and more confident.Another new edition is Balthazar Getty, who plays Thomas Grace. He is recruited to fill in for Vaughn. He brought a different style to the team and was a loner for most of the season. The first half of S5 belonged to Rachel Nichols, and if you can get used to Sydney not being front and center, you'll enjoy it.Once Jennifer had the baby and was able to commit more into the show, is when the season shows glimpses of seasons past greatness. Every episode from halfway on begins to uncover every secret that remained unanswered throughout the show. Since the episode count was cut from a full season to just 17 eps, I felt at times the story seemed a little rushed. Every thing wrapped up but I felt it could have been dragged a little longer to give it more of an affect.The dvd packaging was a little disappointing. The set did not include a booklet that describes each episode like past seasons. Other than that its fine, but I'm a person who enjoys every aspect of a dvd set, and its too bad that wasnt included.This is a wonderful season that wraps up this great show perfectly. Some new faces may cause people to judge this season a little too hard, but they fit in great, and Jennifer comes back with full force in no time and makes the show even stronger.",4,Goodbye Alias,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2499,"['Alias', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'time', 'sensational', 'first', 'season', 'Season', '2', 'managed', 'how', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'dropped', 'quality', 'according', 'most', 'fans', 'So', 'now', 'final', 'season', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'pregnant', 'more', 'picture', 'been', 'season', 'felt', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'back', 'excitement', 'first', 'two.Having', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'put', 'same', 'league', 'first', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'staple', 'great', 'show', 'not', 'almost', '90', 'percent', 'season', 'Jennifer', 'said', 'seat', 'center', 'attention', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'season', '5', 'get', 'new', 'agent', 'who', 'picture.Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Rachel', 'Gibson', 'agent', 'who', 'Sydney', 'season', '1', 'believed', 'was', 'working', 'CIA', 'Once', 'found', 'truth', 'out', 'Sydney', 'team', 'work', 'APO', 'story', 'line', 'different', 'angle', 'Syd', 'when', 'worked', 'SD-6', 'S1', 'Sydney', 'Rachel', 'was', 'not', 'field', 'trained', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'timid', 'vulnerability', 'was', 'very', 'great', 'watch', 'see', 'grow', 'person', 'become', 'stronger', 'more', 'confident.Another', 'new', 'edition', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'who', 'Thomas', 'Grace', 'recruited', 'fill', 'Vaughn', 'brought', 'different', 'style', 'team', 'was', 'loner', 'most', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'S5', 'belonged', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'Sydney', 'not', 'being', 'front', 'center', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.Once', 'Jennifer', 'had', 'baby', 'was', 'able', 'commit', 'more', 'show', 'when', 'season', 'glimpses', 'seasons', 'past', 'greatness', 'episode', 'halfway', 'begins', 'uncover', 'secret', 'remained', 'unanswered', 'show', 'episode', 'count', 'was', 'cut', 'full', 'season', 'just', '17', 'eps', 'felt', 'times', 'story', 'seemed', 'little', 'rushed', 'Every', 'thing', 'wrapped', 'up', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dragged', 'little', 'longer', 'give', 'more', 'affect.The', 'dvd', 'packaging', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'set', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'booklet', 'episode', 'past', 'seasons', 'Other', 'fine', ""'m"", 'person', 'who', 'aspect', 'dvd', 'set', 'too', 'bad', 'wasnt', 'included.This', 'wonderful', 'season', 'up', 'great', 'show', 'perfectly', 'new', 'may', 'cause', 'people', 'judge', 'season', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'fit', 'great', 'Jennifer', 'back', 'full', 'force', 'time', 'show', 'even', 'stronger']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010212,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B000H5V8D6,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[21, 28]","There is one truly outstanding episode in Alias's fifth season.  Midway through the year, Lena Olin's astonishing, duplicitous Irina shows up waiting in Sydney's kitchen, and the episode that follows, ""Maternal Instinct,"" should be remembered as one of the series best.  What the episode reminds you of is all of those qualities that ever got you interested in Alias - a family triangle of characters with moral ambiguities, shifting alliances, love that exists despite selfish motives, and a whole host of unresolved anger and support (not the least of this credit goes to the top notch performances by Olin, Jennifer Garner, and Victor Garber).What the episode also reminds you of is just what Alias lost in its fifth season.  After a couple of episodes that hinted at a potential of a more daring Alias to come (Vaughn dead!  Elodie Bouchez's sexy Reny Rienne driving through a building on her motorcycle!  Sloan evil again!), the show fell apart.  The Prophet 5 plot that supposedly was driving the season was a convoluted mess, a haphazard maguffin that even the characters have very little patience for.  It gets rushed like so much else in the false, forced season.  Were we supposed to feel sympathy for Rachel Nichols' dull and naive Rachel?  Feel drawn to the ""mystery"" surrounding Balthazar Getty's monstrously dull Tom (the conclusion of his storyline invovling - oh no! - a break-in to a car impound lot is a series low)?  Feel excited by the sloppy revolving door of ""actual"" villains (wait, it wasn't Gordon Dean after all!)?  Not notice that Bouchez shows up only to be forgotten about then suddenly killed off?  It's all indicative of a lack of focus that makes the show's action this season ridiculous and the soapy moments laughable - few shows this side of NBC's daytime lineup would attempt an episode like ""30 Seconds,"" where Nadia's death on a glass table couldn't possibly cause more eye-rolling.There is some credit to be had over the year - Amy Acker's turn as well-coiffed villain Peyton is the sort of sexy nemesis that made Alias's brand of girls-only antagonism so exciting over the years - but even the season's high points get brushed aside in the rush to ""fulfill"" the Rimbaldi plot machinations of years past.  There's a valiant attempt to include as much as possible, but even the most casual fans will find continuity problems in the short and long term stories (How exactly is Vaughn alive again?  Didn't we see him buried?).  In the end, the finale ""All The Time In The World"" comes down to one good twist (the final be-careful-what-you-wish-for fate of Sloan) surrounded by a pile of irrelevant look-who-we-got-to-come-back! flashbacks, a quick and anticlimactic end to the Rimbaldi myth that mobilized the series, and an endless cat and mouse game that seems less like coherent television and more like the world's longest game of Where In The World Is Carmen San Diego.",2,On second thought...,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2910,"['one', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'Alias', 'fifth', 'season', 'Midway', 'year', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'astonishing', 'duplicitous', 'Irina', 'up', 'waiting', 'Sydney', 'kitchen', 'episode', 'Maternal', 'Instinct', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'What', 'episode', 'qualities', 'ever', 'got', 'interested', 'Alias', 'family', 'triangle', 'characters', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'shifting', 'alliances', 'love', 'selfish', 'motives', 'whole', 'host', 'unresolved', 'anger', 'support', 'not', 'least', 'credit', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'Olin', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'episode', 'also', 'just', 'what', 'Alias', 'lost', 'fifth', 'season', 'couple', 'episodes', 'hinted', 'potential', 'more', 'daring', 'Alias', 'come', 'Vaughn', 'dead', 'Elodie', 'Bouchez', 'sexy', 'Reny', 'Rienne', 'driving', 'building', 'motorcycle', 'Sloan', 'evil', 'again', 'show', 'fell', 'apart', 'Prophet', '5', 'plot', 'supposedly', 'was', 'driving', 'season', 'was', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'haphazard', 'maguffin', 'even', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'patience', 'rushed', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'false', 'forced', 'season', 'Were', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'dull', 'naive', 'Rachel', 'Feel', 'drawn', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'monstrously', 'dull', 'Tom', 'conclusion', 'storyline', 'invovling', 'oh', 'break-in', 'car', 'impound', 'lot', 'series', 'low', 'Feel', 'excited', 'sloppy', 'revolving', 'door', 'actual', 'villains', 'wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'Gordon', 'Dean', 'Not', 'Bouchez', 'up', 'only', 'be', 'forgotten', 'then', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'off', 'indicative', 'lack', 'focus', 'show', 'action', 'season', 'ridiculous', 'soapy', 'moments', 'laughable', 'few', 'shows', 'side', 'NBC', 'daytime', 'lineup', 'would', 'attempt', 'episode', '30', 'Seconds', 'where', 'Nadia', 'death', 'glass', 'table', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'cause', 'more', 'eye-rolling.There', 'credit', 'be', 'had', 'year', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'turn', 'well-coiffed', 'villain', 'Peyton', 'sort', 'sexy', 'nemesis', 'made', 'Alias', 'brand', 'girls-only', 'antagonism', 'so', 'exciting', 'years', 'even', 'season', 'high', 'points', 'get', 'brushed', 'aside', 'rush', 'fulfill', 'Rimbaldi', 'plot', 'machinations', 'years', 'past', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'include', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'continuity', 'problems', 'short', 'long', 'term', 'stories', 'How', 'exactly', 'Vaughn', 'alive', 'again', 'Did', ""n't"", 'see', 'buried', 'end', 'finale', 'Time', 'World', 'down', 'one', 'good', 'twist', 'final', 'be-careful-what-you-wish-for', 'fate', 'Sloan', 'surrounded', 'pile', 'irrelevant', 'look-who-we-got-to-come-back', 'flashbacks', 'quick', 'anticlimactic', 'end', 'Rimbaldi', 'myth', 'mobilized', 'series', 'endless', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'less', 'coherent', 'television', 'more', 'world', 'longest', 'game', 'Where', 'World', 'Carmen', 'San', 'Diego']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season
1010213,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B000H5V8D6,Eric J. Anderson,"[0, 1]","After five years, this production team and team of actors know how to do Alias. The pacing is good, there's lots of intrigue, exotic locales, amusing situations, saving the world, and all that. That said, a few things bothered me right from the start.In the first episode, Michael Vaughan gets riddled with a hail of machine gun fire. If he'd been in a cartoon, he would drink a glass of water and it would immediately pour out through twenty holes fore and aft. But a few hours later, they've sewn him up, and he's discussing baby names with Syd, weakly. (And then, yes, he sips some water and thankfully does not leak.) The gunfire scene was cinematic, but it was overkill. A couple of good shots to the heart and liver would have sufficed, and made the latter scene more believable.Then, [this is a bit of a spoiler, but hardly a major one] in the same episode our heroes are duped by an ex-CIA guy claiming to have the full authority of the US Government. Good grief! Marshall can tap into any computer worldwide, snag its data, and decrypt it on the fly. But these bozos are taken in by a non-CIA poseur? They can't check his bona fides? It doesn't wash.So, along with all the good stuff in season five you get these little signs of carelessnes that put a damper on a person's enjoyment of the show. With a bit more care, these small problems could have been solved, and the series would have gone out with more credibility. Alias really faltered in Season Three, but it got back on its feet in Season Four.

1010214,A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B000H5V8D6,Eugene Suh,"[1, 3]","I agree with the review from reviewer Chris Conway in that Alias Season 5 lacked depth and character involvement since Michael Vartan (Vaughn) and Greg Grunberg (Weiss) left the show. You could tell Alias was falling apart by not only their departure, but the fact that J.J. Abrams was preoccupied and focused on developing the show ""LOST"" and working on perfecting the movie ""Mission: Impossible 3"" (the best Mission: Impossible movie ever made). In a way, Jennifer's pregnancy did detract from the show's entertainment and her ability to do action scenes (i.e. martial arts), as evidenced by her character's sudden lack of said action scenes. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the addition of new characters were meant to replace and fill-in the void left by the departure of 2 of the show's essential characters (i.e. Vaughn and Weiss). I suppose it was fate and meant to be that Alias lasted only 5 seasons, since during the dismally dreadful 4th season, the other epic J.J. Abrams show ""LOST"" debuted. If the 5th season of Alias had the same character development, captivating plots, suspense, and twists and turns as seasons 2 and 3, perhaps it would have done better, but the departure of Vaughn and Weiss and Sydney's lack of action scenes sealed the fate of this cult show.",2,"A sad, depressing, and tragic end for an awesome cult show",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1284,"['agree', 'review', 'reviewer', 'Chris', 'Conway', 'Alias', 'Season', '5', 'lacked', 'depth', 'character', 'involvement', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Vaughn', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'Weiss', 'left', 'show', 'could', 'tell', 'Alias', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', 'not', 'only', 'departure', 'fact', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'was', 'preoccupied', 'focused', 'developing', 'show', 'LOST', 'working', 'perfecting', 'movie', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '3', 'best', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'way', 'Jennifer', 'pregnancy', 'did', 'detract', 'show', 'entertainment', 'ability', 'do', 'action', 'scenes', 'i.e', 'martial', 'arts', 'evidenced', 'character', 'sudden', 'lack', 'said', 'action', 'scenes', 'Also', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'addition', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'meant', 'replace', 'fill-in', 'void', 'left', 'departure', '2', 'show', 'essential', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Vaughn', 'Weiss', 'suppose', 'was', 'fate', 'meant', 'be', 'Alias', 'lasted', 'only', '5', 'seasons', 'dismally', 'dreadful', '4th', 'season', 'other', 'epic', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'show', 'LOST', 'debuted', '5th', 'season', 'Alias', 'had', 'same', 'character', 'development', 'captivating', 'plots', 'suspense', 'twists', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'departure', 'Vaughn', 'Weiss', 'Sydney', 'lack', 'action', 'scenes', 'sealed', 'fate', 'cult', 'show']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

And, at last, Alias 5 dared to get a major character disappearing. All of this making an enjoyable and more credible show.(Marshall's lines about Sloane being good/bad, Swiss neutrality (...) are really funny!)Then unfortunately (second half), season 5 drifts little by little onto something similar to season 4.

1010216,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B000H5V8D6,Gary P. Cohen,"[1, 1]","The night Alias premiered on ABC, I could not get into it and gave up after about an hour.  I never watched it again.  After the series was cancelled, a friend recommended I pick it up on DVD and give it another chance.  I bought the first 2 seasons and I was hooked.  Last night I watched the final episode and thought that I would write about this great series in general.Alias concerns Sydney Bristow, a very attractive young woman beautifully played by Jennifer Garner. When the series premiered, Sydney is working for SD-6, a ruthless counterintelligence organization that she is told is part of the CIA.  What she and most of the people working there don't know is that SD-6 is really a criminal organization, run by the despicable Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) that has nothing to do with the CIA.  Sydney eventually contacts the CIA and becomes a double-agent spying on SD-6 for the CIA.  Furthermore, her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) also is working undercover for the CIA while seemingly working for SD-6.  But thats just the beginning.Over the next 5 seasons, the CIA would eventually attack and take out SD-6.  Sydney, her father and friends would really become agents for the CIA.  New regulars came and went.  Lena Olin showed up as Sydney's mother, a ruthless killer and ex-KGB agent.  In season 3, after being missing for months and suffering amnesia, Sydney returned to find her boyfriend and former CIA contact,Vaughn, married to a beautiful colleague and ruthless double-agent and killer.  In season 4 Sydney disovered she had a half-sister as a result of a daliance between her mother and Sloane.  Her sister, (the very hot Mia Maestro,) worked with Sydney for most of the season before winding up in a coma at the conclusion of a very wild ""Night of the Living Dead"" type episode where a far-out experiment turns the inhabitants of a Russian city into zombies.  This was a wild and exciting episode.  The 5th. and final season adds some new regulars (Rachel Nichols and the very cute Amy Acker who plays against type in a villainous role.)  The series comes to a very satisfactory conclusion.This show had far-out scripts, terrific acting from Garner, Rifkin and Garber, and incredibly imaginative and exciting action scenes.  I've heard people say that it went off the rails after its 2nd. season.  I don't agree.  I found each season of the series to be exciting and enjoyable.  If you never watched it, do what I did.  Catch up with it on DVD and watch it at your leisure.  You'll be glad you did.",5,The Final Season of a Great Series,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2524,"['night', 'Alias', 'premiered', 'ABC', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'gave', 'up', 'hour', 'never', 'watched', 'again', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'friend', 'recommended', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'give', 'chance', 'bought', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'was', 'hooked', 'Last', 'night', 'watched', 'final', 'episode', 'thought', 'would', 'write', 'great', 'series', 'general.Alias', 'concerns', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'very', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'When', 'series', 'premiered', 'Sydney', 'working', 'SD-6', 'ruthless', 'counterintelligence', 'organization', 'told', 'part', 'CIA', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'working', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'SD-6', 'really', 'criminal', 'organization', 'run', 'despicable', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'nothing', 'do', 'CIA', 'Sydney', 'eventually', 'CIA', 'double-agent', 'spying', 'SD-6', 'CIA', 'Furthermore', 'father', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'also', 'working', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'seemingly', 'working', 'SD-6', 'just', 'beginning.Over', 'next', '5', 'seasons', 'CIA', 'would', 'eventually', 'attack', 'take', 'out', 'SD-6', 'Sydney', 'father', 'friends', 'would', 'really', 'become', 'agents', 'CIA', 'New', 'regulars', 'came', 'went', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'showed', 'up', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'ex-KGB', 'agent', 'season', '3', 'being', 'missing', 'months', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'Sydney', 'returned', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'former', 'CIA', 'contact', 'Vaughn', 'married', 'beautiful', 'colleague', 'ruthless', 'double-agent', 'killer', 'season', '4', 'Sydney', 'disovered', 'had', 'half-sister', 'result', 'daliance', 'mother', 'Sloane', 'sister', 'very', 'hot', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'worked', 'Sydney', 'most', 'season', 'winding', 'up', 'coma', 'conclusion', 'very', 'wild', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'type', 'episode', 'where', 'far-out', 'experiment', 'inhabitants', 'Russian', 'city', 'zombies', 'was', 'wild', 'exciting', 'episode', '5th', 'final', 'season', 'new', 'regulars', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'very', 'cute', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'who', 'type', 'villainous', 'role', 'series', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion.This', 'show', 'had', 'far-out', 'scripts', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Garner', 'Rifkin', 'Garber', 'incredibly', 'imaginative', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'went', 'rails', '2nd', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'found', 'season', 'series', 'be', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'never', 'watched', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'Catch', 'up', 'DVD', 'watch', 'leisure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010220,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B000H5V8D6,iMike,"[1, 1]","I've read a lot of rumors regarding Alias' fifth and final season.  I've read that Michael Vartan was only present in a few episodes due his breakup with series star Jennifer Garner.  I've read that the season's episode order was cut from 22 to 17 because of Garner's pregnancy.  Whether those rumors are true or not, who can say?  Do Vartan's notable absence and the shortened episode order impact the series: yes and no.I'll start with the yes.  From day one, Michael Vartan's character, Agent Michael Vaughn, has been instrumental in Sydney Bristow's life, initially as her CIA handler coordinating her double-agent status then as a romantic interest.  His absence gives the impression that the writers and producers were trying to fill a void with the addition of new characters.  If Alias had survived for a sixth season, this might not have been the case.  As for the shortened episode order ... some shows may be able to have just as much of an impact with just five of its season's episodes cut.  Alias is not one of those shows.  While the finale was satisfying and riveting, it was simply unable to address a lot of the unanswered questions from previous seasons.  You can tell they tried to wrap up as much as possible, but also knew that trying to cram in too much would have made it feel more fake.Personally I feel a sixth season should have been produced.  Even if that meant airing it from January to May without interruption, the wait would have been worth it just to have a full final season that truly answered everything.Despite what I've mentioned, the fifth and final season is still worth watching and have many standout episodes.  Of the new characters ... some worked, some did not.  Renee Rienne (Elodie Bouchez) worked well, as did the character of Tom Grace (played by Balthazar Getty).  Rachel Nichols as Rachel Gibson does not work; her character is interesting enough, but Nichols did not make me care much for the character.  Also, her chemistry with Balthazar Getty was not as strong as it should have been.  I love Amy Acker (""Fred,"" from the Joss Whedon series Angel) as terrorist Kelly Peyton and wish she had received more screen time.In addition to Michael Vartan appearing in five of the season's seventeen episodes and having a cameo in another, Lena Olin returns as the deliciously insidious Irina Derevko for two full episodes and has a cameo in another.  Bradley Cooper (Will Tippin), Gina Torres (Anna Espinosa) and Merrin Dungey (Francie Calfo) each make an appearance as the series nears its home stretch.As for the product itself, it arrived in excellent condition and the shipping was actually a day ahead of schedule.",5,"An uneven, but great end to an incredible series.",1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,2666,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'rumors', 'regarding', 'Alias', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'was', 'only', 'present', 'few', 'episodes', 'due', 'breakup', 'series', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', ""'ve"", 'read', 'season', 'episode', 'order', 'was', 'cut', '22', '17', 'Garner', 'pregnancy', 'Whether', 'rumors', 'are', 'true', 'not', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'Do', 'Vartan', 'notable', 'absence', 'shortened', 'episode', 'order', 'impact', 'series', 'yes', 'no.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'yes', 'day', 'one', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'character', 'Agent', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'been', 'instrumental', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'life', 'initially', 'CIA', 'handler', 'coordinating', 'double-agent', 'status', 'then', 'romantic', 'interest', 'absence', 'impression', 'writers', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'fill', 'void', 'addition', 'new', 'characters', 'Alias', 'had', 'survived', 'sixth', 'season', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'shortened', 'episode', 'order', 'shows', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'impact', 'just', 'five', 'season', 'episodes', 'cut', 'Alias', 'not', 'one', 'shows', 'finale', 'was', 'satisfying', 'riveting', 'was', 'simply', 'unable', 'address', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'previous', 'seasons', 'can', 'tell', 'tried', 'wrap', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'also', 'knew', 'trying', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'fake.Personally', 'feel', 'sixth', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'Even', 'meant', 'airing', 'January', 'May', 'interruption', 'wait', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'just', 'have', 'full', 'final', 'season', 'truly', 'answered', 'everything.Despite', 'what', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'many', 'standout', 'episodes', 'new', 'characters', 'worked', 'did', 'not', 'Renee', 'Rienne', 'Elodie', 'Bouchez', 'worked', 'well', 'did', 'character', 'Tom', 'Grace', 'played', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Rachel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'work', 'character', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Nichols', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'care', 'much', 'character', 'Also', 'chemistry', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Fred', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'series', 'Angel', 'terrorist', 'Kelly', 'Peyton', 'wish', 'had', 'received', 'more', 'screen', 'time.In', 'addition', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'appearing', 'five', 'season', 'seventeen', 'episodes', 'having', 'cameo', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'deliciously', 'insidious', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'two', 'full', 'episodes', 'cameo', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Anna', 'Espinosa', 'Merrin', 'Dungey', 'Francie', 'Calfo', 'make', 'appearance', 'series', 'home', 'stretch.As', 'product', 'arrived', 'excellent', 'condition', 'shipping', 'was', 'actually', 'day', 'ahead', 'schedule']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","***This review may contain spoilers, if you have not seen through season 4 of Alias and do not wish to know of plot points up to that point I recommend that you stop reading now!***ABC has been dealing with what many have referred to as the Mork and Mindy curse for a couple of decades. Since Mork and Mindy was cancelled within a year of being moved to Thursday nights, it appears that shows that are moved to, or premiere, on Thursday nights don't last a full year. Shows to suffer the fate are: Samantha Who, FlashForward, My So-Called Life, My Generation, and this year Charlie's Angels among many others. The curse appears to have also caused the end of Alias in its fifth season.Feeling that Alias could have done better numbers if it didn't have to compete with American Idol and trying to strengthen their failing Thursday night line-up, ABC opted to move Alias to Thursdays at 8 PM for its fifth season in September of 2005. The move resulted in the lowest numbers in the show's history, so then ABC moved it to Wednesdays at 10 PM that December for two episodes. The show then took a four month break to allow Jennifer Garner to give birth before coming back in April of 2006 to the Wednesday, 8 PM slot. The juggling ultimately led to a series low average of 6.7 million viewers per episode and the show's cancellation.Following the climactic car crash of season 4, as Michael Vaugn (Michael Vartan) was telling Sydney (Jennifer Garner) about the truth of who he was, Sydney escapes a secret organization known as Prophet Five, finds out that the CIA is investigating Vaugn for being a double agent, and that she is pregnant with Vaugn's child. Meanwhile, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is in prison for working with Elena Derevko, but is offered help in getting out of prison and aiding his daughter Nadia (Mia Maestro) by Prophet Five in exchange for information on APO and Sydney.Season 5 does a great job of fixing some of the issues of season 4. Where season 4 started off with quite a bit of bloat; season 5 jumps right into the issues that will plague the season from the beginning. For a truncated season with a few less episodes than the last four seasons, this season is filled with twists and action maybe even a little more than previous episodes. Of course the shorter length may also have helped keep the show more on track than the previous season where a truncated length may have helped keep things on track.The one major problem with this season would have to be the fact that everyone seemed to know it was the last season. Vartan wasn't available for most of the season due to filming a movie, and Greg Grunberg moved on to Heroes. Jennifer Garner remained fully invested, but due to her pregnancy she was given something of a prot&eacute;g&eacute; in Rachel Gibson (Rachel Nichols) who lacks the charisma of previous female stars of the series. Also added to the cast is Balthazar Getty as Thomas Grace to replace Vartan and Grunberg, and with the addition of the new characters comes some subplots that really could have been excised from the finished product.With this last season though there is some joy to be had in the return appearance of characters who were major players in the first season or two but have been lacking in appearances since. Merrin Dungey returns for the finale in a flashback as we learn more of Sydney's past (a great choice of framing for the series finale that also sets up the brilliant epilogue), and Bradley Cooper gets to have a little fun reprising Will Tippin and going on a mission for the CIA. Although I do have to admit that I found his involvement a little troubling. One of the great things about Jason Segel's appearance in season 4 was that it illustrated the world outside the spy world, and Tippin had always been great in illustrating that previously. Here we see him pulling off an accent and fighting a woman that even Sydney has had trouble with it. It just felt that in the end the show kind of lost the line between the spy and non-spy worlds.4/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",4,Alias Season 5,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,4097,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', '4', 'Alias', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'know', 'plot', 'points', 'up', 'point', 'recommend', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', '***ABC', 'been', 'dealing', 'what', 'many', 'have', 'referred', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'curse', 'couple', 'decades', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'was', 'cancelled', 'year', 'being', 'moved', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'shows', 'are', 'moved', 'premiere', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'full', 'year', 'suffer', 'fate', 'are', 'Samantha', 'Who', 'FlashForward', 'My', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'My', 'Generation', 'year', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'many', 'others', 'curse', 'have', 'also', 'caused', 'end', 'Alias', 'fifth', 'season.Feeling', 'Alias', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'numbers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'compete', 'American', 'Idol', 'trying', 'strengthen', 'failing', 'Thursday', 'night', 'line-up', 'ABC', 'opted', 'move', 'Alias', 'Thursdays', '8', 'PM', 'fifth', 'season', 'September', '2005', 'move', 'resulted', 'lowest', 'numbers', 'show', 'history', 'so', 'then', 'ABC', 'moved', 'Wednesdays', '10', 'PM', 'December', 'two', 'episodes', 'show', 'then', 'took', 'four', 'month', 'break', 'allow', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'give', 'birth', 'coming', 'back', 'April', '2006', 'Wednesday', '8', 'PM', 'slot', 'juggling', 'ultimately', 'led', 'series', 'low', 'average', '6.7', 'million', 'viewers', 'episode', 'show', 'cancellation.Following', 'climactic', 'car', 'crash', 'season', '4', 'Michael', 'Vaugn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'was', 'telling', 'Sydney', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'truth', 'who', 'was', 'Sydney', 'secret', 'organization', 'known', 'Prophet', 'Five', 'out', 'CIA', 'investigating', 'Vaugn', 'being', 'double', 'agent', 'pregnant', 'Vaugn', 'child', 'Meanwhile', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'prison', 'working', 'Elena', 'Derevko', 'offered', 'help', 'getting', 'prison', 'aiding', 'daughter', 'Nadia', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'Prophet', 'Five', 'exchange', 'information', 'APO', 'Sydney.Season', '5', 'great', 'job', 'fixing', 'issues', 'season', '4', 'Where', 'season', '4', 'started', 'off', 'quite', 'bit', 'bloat', 'season', '5', 'jumps', 'right', 'issues', 'will', 'plague', 'season', 'beginning', 'truncated', 'season', 'few', 'less', 'episodes', 'last', 'four', 'seasons', 'season', 'filled', 'twists', 'action', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'previous', 'episodes', 'course', 'shorter', 'length', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'helped', 'keep', 'show', 'more', 'track', 'previous', 'season', 'where', 'truncated', 'length', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'keep', 'things', 'track.The', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'fact', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'know', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'Vartan', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'most', 'season', 'due', 'filming', 'movie', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'moved', 'Heroes', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'remained', 'fully', 'invested', 'due', 'pregnancy', 'was', 'given', 'something', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Rachel', 'Gibson', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'who', 'charisma', 'previous', 'female', 'stars', 'series', 'Also', 'added', 'cast', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Thomas', 'Grace', 'replace', 'Vartan', 'Grunberg', 'addition', 'new', 'characters', 'subplots', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 'finished', 'product.With', 'last', 'season', 'joy', 'be', 'had', 'return', 'appearance', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'major', 'players', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'appearances', 'Merrin', 'Dungey', 'returns', 'finale', 'flashback', 'learn', 'more', 'Sydney', 'past', 'great', 'choice', 'framing', 'series', 'finale', 'also', 'up', 'brilliant', 'epilogue', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'reprising', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'going', 'mission', 'CIA', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'found', 'involvement', 'little', 'troubling', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'appearance', 'season', '4', 'was', 'illustrated', 'world', 'spy', 'world', 'Tippin', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'illustrating', 'previously', 'Here', 'see', 'pulling', 'off', 'accent', 'fighting', 'woman', 'even', 'Sydney', 'had', 'trouble', 'just', 'felt', 'end', 'show', 'kind', 'lost', 'line', 'spy', 'non-spy', 'worlds.4/5Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season
1010224,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000H5V8D6,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[4, 8]","Alias offered Jennifer Garner in a bunch of sexy different outfits, many twists, great characters and great action. So when I heard it was the last season I was pretty disapointed. It at least isn't a bad last season. I always pictured the Quentin Tarantino character coming back though for one last battle with Sydney. Since his appearance in season one was one of the best. Then he made another appearance in Season 3. So I always pictured Sydney having to get rid of him too. The last season does still go out with a bang though.You have Vaughn getting killed off in the first episode of the season. Which I thought sucked since he was always one of my favorite characters and when he was gone the show felt like it was missing a big chunk of what made it good. Although he's missing throughout the season, you know there's probably a good chance they may have just faked his death to protect him from bad guys. Still though the season could've more of him. Maybe Michael Vartan didn't want to be around doing scenes with his former g/f while she was pregnant. I mean he does just happen to come back after Garner gave birth to her baby...While Sydney's hot sister Nadia is in a coma through the season with Sloane trying to figure out how to get her out of it. The show offers new characters in Vaughn and Nadia's absense. The hot Rachel Nichols plays Rachel Gibson who just like Sydney was fooled into believing she was working for the C.I.A.. When infact she was working for bad guys of course. With Garner pregnant, she takes over wearing the sexy outfits through half the season. She even gets some action. Balthazar Getty (was in one season of Charmed) plays Thomas Grace who starts working for Sydney's crew. He has a hidden agender of his own and Gibson wants to figure out what it is. &Eacute;lodie Bouchez almost steals the show as Ren&eacute;e Rienne who becomes a strong allie to Sydney. She isn't used as much as she could've been though.While Amy Acker (Angel) is excellent as a juicy new villian that Rachel Gibson used to work with. I'm glad that they chose to keep her around right up to the series finale because she's really good. While Gina Torres is back as Sydney's most dangerous enemy Anna Espinosa. Torres is such an under-rated actress that I'd even love to see play Storm if Halle Berry doesn't come back for an X-4. I'm sure she'd ask for less money and not expect the whole script surrounded around her too! Anyway her battles with Sydney are always fun and every time she made an appearance in the show you knew you were in for something good.Plus it's good to see that the awesome David Anders comes back for some final appearances as Julian Sark. He was always to this show what Spike was to Buffy. He was a bad guy but it was always hard not to love the guy and not want to see him get killed. Lena Olin is back as Sydney's mother and of course once again she has to figure out if she can trust her. While finally learning to trust Sloane might come back to haunt Sydney as well.Although Vaughn isn't around most of the season they do manage to tell some good stories and still have some great action and suspense. They don't do a bad job trying to tie in all the loose ends by the last episode. For instance we do get to see why Wambaldi ""or however you spell it"" is so important to Sloane. It's sad seeing the show go but you can't say that it's last moments were really bad tv.",4,A worthy last season,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3416,"['Alias', 'offered', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'bunch', 'sexy', 'different', 'outfits', 'many', 'twists', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'action', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'disapointed', 'least', ""n't"", 'bad', 'last', 'season', 'always', 'pictured', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'character', 'coming', 'back', 'one', 'last', 'battle', 'Sydney', 'appearance', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Then', 'made', 'appearance', 'Season', '3', 'So', 'always', 'pictured', 'Sydney', 'having', 'get', 'rid', 'too', 'last', 'season', 'still', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'though.You', 'have', 'Vaughn', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'Which', 'thought', 'sucked', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'when', 'was', 'gone', 'show', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'big', 'chunk', 'what', 'made', 'good', 'missing', 'season', 'know', 'probably', 'good', 'chance', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'faked', 'death', 'protect', 'bad', 'guys', 'Still', 'season', 'could', ""'ve"", 'more', 'Maybe', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'doing', 'scenes', 'former', 'g/f', 'was', 'pregnant', 'mean', 'just', 'happen', 'come', 'back', 'Garner', 'gave', 'birth', 'baby', 'Sydney', 'hot', 'sister', 'Nadia', 'coma', 'season', 'Sloane', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'show', 'new', 'characters', 'Vaughn', 'Nadia', 'absense', 'hot', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Rachel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'just', 'Sydney', 'was', 'fooled', 'believing', 'was', 'working', 'C.I.A..', 'When', 'infact', 'was', 'working', 'bad', 'guys', 'course', 'Garner', 'pregnant', 'wearing', 'sexy', 'season', 'even', 'action', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'was', 'one', 'season', 'Charmed', 'Thomas', 'Grace', 'who', 'working', 'Sydney', 'crew', 'hidden', 'agender', 'own', 'Gibson', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Eacute', 'Bouchez', 'almost', 'show', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Rienne', 'who', 'strong', 'allie', 'Sydney', ""n't"", 'used', 'as', 'much', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'though.While', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Angel', 'excellent', 'juicy', 'new', 'villian', 'Rachel', 'Gibson', 'used', 'work', ""'m"", 'glad', 'chose', 'keep', 'around', 'right', 'up', 'series', 'finale', 'really', 'good', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'back', 'Sydney', 'most', 'dangerous', 'enemy', 'Anna', 'Espinosa', 'Torres', 'such', 'under-rated', 'actress', ""'d"", 'even', 'love', 'see', 'play', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'X-4', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'ask', 'less', 'money', 'not', 'expect', 'whole', 'script', 'surrounded', 'too', 'Anyway', 'battles', 'Sydney', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'time', 'made', 'appearance', 'show', 'knew', 'were', 'something', 'good.Plus', 'good', 'see', 'awesome', 'David', 'Anders', 'back', 'final', 'appearances', 'Julian', 'Sark', 'was', 'always', 'show', 'what', 'Spike', 'was', 'Buffy', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'always', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'guy', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'killed', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'back', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'course', 'once', 'again', 'figure', 'out', 'can', 'trust', 'finally', 'learning', 'trust', 'Sloane', 'might', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'Sydney', 'well.Although', 'Vaughn', ""n't"", 'most', 'season', 'do', 'manage', 'tell', 'good', 'stories', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'action', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'trying', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'last', 'episode', 'instance', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'why', 'Wambaldi', 'however', 'spell', 'so', 'important', 'Sloane', 'sad', 'seeing', 'show', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'last', 'moments', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'tv']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010227,A1403J18C3KRAC,B000H5V8D6,Justin F.,"[0, 0]","Between Jennifer Garner being pregnant coming in, Michael Vartan having a movie project through most of the season, and the fear that Garner could leave the show if it continued on it's obvious that the production crew had to mix things up a bit. They introduced a new female character to try to fill in and potentially one day replace Garner. They brought in a new male character for the new female character to identify with. They had to come up with a story as to where Vaughn was and what got him in that position to begin with and it was a lot for the season to overcome, especially since it was the last of Alias we would ever see. The season tries to be a bit more serialized than season four and it's not that the back stories of the new characters are bad, it's just that being introduced to new characters and having to set aside so much time for entry-level back stories so frequently made this feel a bit more like a spinoff series than the final season of a great show throughout the first half of the season.The final two episodes (shown back to back on ABC on their original airing and as a result are linked together like a two-parter for me) are solid, not great to me but the arc leading up to them overall is very good stuff that starts to feel like Alias again. Garner had the baby and a break in the production schedule to get back into form, Vartan finished his project and came back to the show, and the show was for the most part very good again from that point on. I think if the concerns off the screen hadn't been present this season could have been very, very good but some factors just worked against the show in this final year. Much like season four I consider this season to be good television, just not great or epic like everyone thinks seasons one and two were and like I think season three was as well.",4,Made with Good Intentions but Still Much Different,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1838,"['Between', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'being', 'pregnant', 'coming', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'having', 'movie', 'project', 'most', 'season', 'fear', 'Garner', 'could', 'leave', 'show', 'continued', 'obvious', 'production', 'crew', 'had', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'introduced', 'new', 'female', 'character', 'try', 'fill', 'potentially', 'one', 'day', 'replace', 'Garner', 'brought', 'new', 'male', 'character', 'new', 'female', 'character', 'identify', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'where', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'what', 'got', 'position', 'begin', 'was', 'lot', 'season', 'overcome', 'especially', 'was', 'last', 'Alias', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'season', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'serialized', 'season', 'four', 'not', 'back', 'stories', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'being', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'having', 'set', 'aside', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'entry-level', 'back', 'stories', 'so', 'frequently', 'made', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'spinoff', 'series', 'final', 'season', 'great', 'show', 'first', 'half', 'season.The', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'shown', 'back', 'back', 'ABC', 'original', 'airing', 'result', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'two-parter', 'are', 'solid', 'not', 'great', 'arc', 'leading', 'up', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'feel', 'Alias', 'again', 'Garner', 'had', 'baby', 'break', 'production', 'schedule', 'get', 'back', 'form', 'Vartan', 'finished', 'project', 'came', 'back', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'again', 'point', 'think', 'concerns', 'screen', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'present', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'factors', 'just', 'worked', 'show', 'final', 'year', 'Much', 'season', 'four', 'consider', 'season', 'be', 'good', 'television', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'epic', 'everyone', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'think', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'as', 'well']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010239,A12SPOVUAHCNZW,B000H5V8D6,Lola,"[6, 8]","...then this is worth watching, given the good stuff mentioned in the other reviews.  Some of the best and most creative parts of the season were homages to the Buffy/Angel-verse (I finally noticed Drew Goddard and Jefferey Bell in the credits - check out Nocturne of Season 4 if you have doubts) - and, for me, this saved the season!  Even though there were good things (especially our much beloved actors), it seemed like the writers just gave up on the ending, sacrificing character for plot.  I LOVED Alias - so I WAS expecting to be blown away.  What follows were my major disappointments (warning: ***SPOILERS follow***):1.  Irina.  As a long-time fan of the show, I believed in Sydney's choices.  Sydney repeatedly chooses to let her evil mom roam free, trusting that Irina has an ""endgame"" that justifies death and destruction (""truth takes time"").  Lena Olin does a terrific job of portraying Irina's complexity.  Because Sydney and Jack fundamentally trust Irina (at least, when Jack isn't murdering her), the audience either also trusts her or feels like the main characters are dupes on a weekly basis.  Fans wondered: is she trying to save Sydney, or is this an epic, slow-burn of a betrayal?  Either would have been satisfying.  However, it turns out that Sydney's mom was just...crazy?  If you were like me, you were left feeling like: ""huh?""2.  Vaughn's ""fake-out"" death.  Nobody who watches Alias could believe that Sydney and Jack wouldn't have mourned Vaughn's death and executed some serious payback on his killers...unless he wasn't actually dead.  Unfortunately, the writers set up this whole idea that people who were offically ""dead"" were in this evil top-secret society.  One couldn't help but wonder if Vaughn's plan was to fake his death to ""earn"" his way into this secret organization and find out what his father knew.  But, sigh, no, he was just ""healing.""  Sending him away to heal admitted some major weaknesses in the ability of our main characters to protect each other.3.  Rambaldi.  Uh, so...WHY did Irina want to bring about ultimate destruction?  Was the prophecy even really fulfilled?  Why would the bad guys risk Ana Espinoza/Sydney's double on a clearly unimportant mission to trick Vaughn?  WHY would Sydney go through with the prophecy after five years of Rambaldi-related-eye-rolling...without a plan?4.  Sydney's transition from Superspy to Spymom.  Sydney sits in the car and gets stuck behind a train while Vaughn is shot, stands around to let Sloane shoot her father, and dithers blankly while letting her mother crash through the window on the roof - she's losing her touch!  Instead of whining about the restrictions of her pregnancy, why doesn't she focus on teaching the newbies how to be the next gen superspies?  She just accepts Rachel's limitations and doesn't actually impart new wisdom.

Due to poor planning on when to screen season 5 where I live, I was forced to wait until the dvds came out to watch it. I was painfully disappointed.I watched the first disc and honestly couldn't continue. I packed it away with the intent of watching when I had the free time and inclination to again.It took me a few years, but I watched the full series again. I was charmed with the story, characters and plots from season one to season 4. While the seasons 3 and 4 were not as good as the first two, I still loved to watch them. Not true for season 5.The final season is full of random new characters with flimsy backgrouds and annoyingly long scenes, off-kilter plots and painful plot holes. Also, two of the main characters were quickly and messily written out and two new characters written in. I found it hard to believe that the team that had brought me seasons 1,2,3 and 4 were also responsible for the painful filth that is season 5.

1010243,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000H5V8D6,Mark Baker,"[8, 12]","Season 5 of super spy hit Alias picks up moments after season 4 ended.  Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) were just in a car crash.  They are quickly whisked away and hidden but eventually Michael can explain his comment to Sydney.  The revelation about his name leads Sydney and the rest of CIA black ops unit APO to Prophet Five, yet another secret organization trying to rule and world and solve the Rimbaldi riddle.  Just as Sydney is getting the good news that she is pregnant, tragedy strikes.  Now Sydney will stop and nothing to take down Prophet Five and get her revenge.I have been a loyal Alias fan since day one, but I felt this season was the weakest of the series.  We've already fought against multiple secret organizations, so that plot felt old to me.  The biggest problems, however, were the actors who left.  We lost three of season 4's main characters.  The producers brought in potentially interesting new characters to replace them, but with only 17 episodes, they didn't get the time to develop they needed.Not to say the season is a complete loss.  The storylines are still interesting.  The decision that this would be the final season came early enough that the major storylines from the series could be resolved.  And lots of old friends and enemies come back for a final appearance.  I thought this was an especially nice touch as the show wound down.  The acting, as always, is top notch, not only from the returning actors but also from the newbies.Ultimately, I just couldn't get over the loss of characters I already knew and loved to fully enjoy this season.",3,Disappointing Final Season,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,1626,"['Season', '5', 'super', 'spy', 'hit', 'Alias', 'up', 'moments', 'season', '4', 'ended', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'were', 'just', 'car', 'crash', 'are', 'quickly', 'whisked', 'away', 'hidden', 'eventually', 'Michael', 'can', 'explain', 'comment', 'Sydney', 'revelation', 'name', 'Sydney', 'rest', 'CIA', 'black', 'ops', 'unit', 'APO', 'Prophet', 'Five', 'yet', 'secret', 'organization', 'trying', 'rule', 'world', 'solve', 'Rimbaldi', 'riddle', 'Just', 'Sydney', 'getting', 'good', 'news', 'pregnant', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Now', 'Sydney', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'take', 'down', 'Prophet', 'Five', 'get', 'revenge.I', 'have', 'been', 'loyal', 'Alias', 'fan', 'day', 'one', 'felt', 'season', 'was', 'weakest', 'series', ""'ve"", 'already', 'fought', 'multiple', 'secret', 'organizations', 'plot', 'felt', 'old', 'biggest', 'problems', 'however', 'were', 'actors', 'who', 'left', 'lost', 'three', 'season', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'producers', 'brought', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'replace', 'only', '17', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'time', 'develop', 'needed.Not', 'say', 'season', 'complete', 'loss', 'storylines', 'are', 'still', 'interesting', 'decision', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'came', 'early', 'enough', 'major', 'storylines', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'lots', 'old', 'friends', 'enemies', 'come', 'back', 'final', 'appearance', 'thought', 'was', 'especially', 'nice', 'touch', 'show', 'wound', 'down', 'acting', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'only', 'returning', 'actors', 'also', 'newbies.Ultimately', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'loss', 'characters', 'already', 'knew', 'loved', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'season']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010246,A368H5Z546WGLG,B000H5V8D6,"Matthew C. Russoniello ""truthtakestime""","[27, 34]","Warning: This review contains references to very specific plot points during the season.  These could be considered spoilers to those of you who've not yet watched this season and wish to remain unaware of what happens.Alias has been my favorite show since it started in 2001, and up until its very last moment, I would have cancelled any meeting or skipped any class to make sure I got to watch.  Its fun marriage of spy thriller action and serialized family drama (plus the unique addition of Rambaldi, the mysterious 15th Century prophet whose works play a key role in characters lives) was a perfect combination, and the show got so many things really right.  And, as illustrated during this season, a few things really wrong.In retrospect, Alias lost sight of The Bigger Picture after season two, but it continued to entertain and move forward, always leaving some hope that answers were on the way and mysteries would be solved.  As long as the show had a future, I remained annoyingly optimistic that the writers would find a satisfying way to tie everything together: The Rambaldi mystery, Irina's role, the missing two years and fulfillment of The Prophecy, etcetera.  With season 5, the time had come for the show to make good on its promising potential...or not.Season 5, the final season, is by far the weakest of the show's run.  The first handful of episodes all struggle to illustrate even mediocre stories and ideas.  Perhaps this is because the writers, even knowing this to be their final year, unwisely decided to introduce three new main characters in order to divert attention away from Garner's real-life pregnancy (read: Garner/Sydney's inability to don sexy outfits and jump off the roofs of 30-story buildings).  The most offensive of these additions is the character of Rachel Gibson, played by the banal and boring Rachel Nichols.  Her character was meant to be a parallel of Sydney, a smart and capable spywoman who finds her entire spyworld is backwards, wrong, and evil.  Instead of honoring the image of Sydney, however, Rachel only reminds viewers that there is only one Sydney Bristow and only one actress to play her.The list of wrongs committed extends from there.  The new characters constantly distract from the original premise and character dynamics of the show.  At one point, the writers actually attempt to take Sydney out of the center of the plot and put Rachel in her place (skanky dress and all).  For the best illustration of this, see episode ""Solo.""  Balthazar Getty's character matches the blandness of Rachel's, and he adds no intrigue or interest to any of the stories in which he is involved.  This becomes painfully clear during the last half of the season as we are introduced to an ""Agent Grace (Getty) has a dark secret and mysterious past"" plot that eats up massive amounts of valuable time.  The only addition that merits any praise whatsoever is Elodie Boucher as Renee Riene, a beautiful and attitudinal outlaw, and who it is revealed was a longtime friend and collaborator of ""Michael Vaughn."" Of course, Boucher's character is severely underused, leaving viewers to wonder what the point of having her around was.  Had they written more for her and ignored the Blonde Boob (Rachel), things would have been much better.In addition to throwing useless characters into an already complicated (some might say ""convoluted"") story, the writers commit sins across the board.  Among the chief offenses:1. Killing off ""Michael Vaughn"" just to bring him back (through flashback/fantasy and through ""Gotcha!  We fooled ya!  He wasn't really dead!""-type storylines) due to fan demand and the realization that Sydney needs her soul mate.2. The writers come up with the astoundingly exciting and well-fitting idea of using Project Helix to clone Sydney (with ANNA ESPINOZA as the procedure's (un)lucky volunteer!!!) in order to fulfill the Prophecy.  However, they obliterate the arc before it even has the chance to play out.  Such a disappointing climax on so many levels: No Prophecy fulfillment, no battle between Syd and EvilSyd (as foreshadowed in Season 3), and no battle period...Just a few easy bullets to kill the best story idea the show had all year).3. Though it was clear they were trying, the Rambaldi resolution was less a resolution and more of an unclear, bogged-down headscratcher.4. We were fortunate enough to see Lena Olin (Irina) pop up throughout the season, and while all of her scenes were incredible, I find that the writers' ultimate handling of her character (read: demonizing of) was tasteless and illogical.5.  Ignoring Nadia (could she not have stepped in to fill the role of ""sexy spy"" in place of newcomer Rachel?).  Bringing her back just long enough to kill her (a highly offensive end to an unfortunately underused character).6. 17 episodes.  You'd think since I'm here writing about the diminished quality of the show I'd be glad the season was shortened.  However, the smaller batch of episodes is, in my opinion, a huge detriment to what could have been a better season.  With 5 less hours to explain and tie everything up, viewers can definitely feel the rushed quality of the story arcs. The pacing of the season is ruined, with a strong (mostly) second-half attempting to balance out a slow, uninspired first-half.So, you may wonder, then why the high rating?  Well, simply because I couldn't bring myself to rate it less.  Though there are some plot holes to leap over, some characters to ignore, and some resolution left wanting, this is still an integral part of the series.  And it is not without its strengths.  In the last hour of the show the writers get several things right with respect to Sloane.  Sydney revenges the deaths of Danny and Francie as she fires her gun empty into a maniacal Sloane.  Though his death is short-lived, his ultimate fate is even more appropriate.  I get chills when I think of GhostNadia walking out to leave him alone for eternity.  The previously mentioned storyline of EvilSyd was pure genius while it lasted.  The show's big Episode 100 (the brilliantly titled ""There's Only One Sydney Bristow"") was among the best they have produced, with great returning favorites (Will and Anna Espinoza) and a humorous, action-packed story.At its worst, Alias is a confused but still entertaining show with good intentions.  At its best, Alias is thrilling, shocking, moving and innovative.  Season 5 illustrates both sets of qualities, and gives a decent, though not totally satisfying, closing to a show that I will sorely miss every Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday night, at 9, 8, and sometimes 10 p.m., respectively.  I wonder where we'd be if ABC had treated it even slightly better...",4,"Alias, the Fifth and Final Year: Disappointing but Satisfying",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,6711,"['Warning', 'review',

In the spy-thriller genre, Alias is second only to its LFN progenitor, but a step above (in my opinion) 24 in terms of overall story arc.The DVD releases have always been impressive: good video quality, good audio quality (granted I'm not a sound/video snob, and I don't have a 30"" plasma TV yet). The discs always have sufficient bonus materials from deleted scenes to commentary tracks, and blooper reels. I expect this release will be no different.I will note however that they have changed the packaging format (just like LFN did on their fifth/final season; speaking of which is it coincidence that both series ended on a shortened fifth season and made large attempts to tie up all the ""loose ends"" of the series?). However, I'm not as thrilled with the changes to Alias' packaging as I was with the changes to LFN. Whereas LFN change from an attractive book format to a more standard double-thin pack format, Alias appears to have changed to a double-stacked fold-out configuration, that I frankly dislike in no uncertain terms. IE, to get to disc 2, you have to take out disc 1 then take out disc 2 then put disc 1 back into the fold-out case. I really wish that studios would stop doing that to customers (I vaguely recall they did that with one or two of the last Highlander seasons too, much to the dismay of fans). I'd have preferred that they simply used two double-disc thin packs like LFN did. I much prefer those to double-stacked fold-outs.That aside, the rest of the packaging is pretty standard, down to the outer plastic slip case with the special fetures printed on the back, and Jennifer Garner printed on the front. Though for those who tend to throw out the outer plastic, it would be NICE, if they'd print the special features on the back of the fold-out packaging rather than the outer plastic. C'est la vie.I look forward to catchign the last season in DVD re-run. I'm sure it will be spectacular, one way or the other.

That said, the last season suffered from two challenges that were very hard to overcome.  Michael Varten went prima donna, and Jennifer Garner got pregnant.  I don't blame either actor for wanting to move on in life, but these actions challenged the premise of the show.  So in a bid to wrap up the story lines new actors were brought in for one season and did well.  Sydney was nursed along with her pregnancy.

The interaction Sidney/Jack and Sydney/Sloane was always a welcome addition to the show.I have to say that THE BEST ADDITION to this final season was the character of Payton (played by Amy Acker).  The best to describe her is a female Sark.  The whole season was worth watching and specially the episodes with her character.  Her popularity was so good that they made her a regular in the middle of the season.  GOOD JOB on that.The season warps nicelly the Rambaldi theme, and the closure is well executed.

The box is nowehere in size to the other releases either, it's what feels like less than half an inch thick. This has been a major problem for me as well, with Alias - Buena Vista changes the packaging for each season. It's very annoying.Also, the special features are nothing. A few interesting features, but overall the supplements are very weak for the final season. The entire thing feels rushed and botched, like no one CARED that this was the last season of such a beloved series.If you can afford it, I highly urge you to invest in the complete collection.

1010264,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000H5V8D6,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Warning!  Some minor spoilers are contained in the following review!Season Five of ALIAS was by far the most challenging.  Although the series started off well in the ratings race, it was moved around in the schedule when the ratings slipped slightly.  Its fate was probably sealed when it was briefly placed after LOST, another J. J. Abrams creation, and it failed to hold the audience.  So, by Season Five, ABC had pretty much given up on the show and fairly abused it, not promoting it sufficiently and then cutting the number of episodes during the long break necessitated by Jennifer Garner's time off to have her baby and recover.  Luckily, the producers were given sufficient time to create a compelling wrap up to the series.  Some story arcs ended up being truncated (especially Balthazar Getty's), but in the final moments one felt as a viewer that nothing major had been unresolved.The first half of the season was, however, tremendously uneven.  Much of the problem was created by Michael Vartan's departure from the show.  With his ""death"" and Nadia's coma, combined with Jennifer Garner's decreased mobility due to her pregnancy, the show took on an entire new tone.  &Eacute;lodie Bouchez, Balthazar Getty, and the absolutely splendid Rachel Nichols were all brought on board as Sydney's new compatriots, while Amy Acker (best known as Fred/Illyria on ANGEL, and who will be returning to television on Joss Whedon's new series DOLLHOUSE) was the show's new bad gal.  Still, the show was always about Sydney Bristow, and with Jennifer Garner in the final months of her pregnancy and not able to get about with her former vigor, the show felt oddly stilted.  But as soon as the pregnancy was over and as Garner got progressively back into ass-kicking shape, both the plot and the action racheted back up.I won't go into plot details because no review should spoil that for anyone.  Anyone who had followed the series from the beginning knew pretty much how it would end if the producers and writers were given their say.  The Rambaldi endgame would be revealed.  Sloane would somehow or other get his.  Things would be resolved between Sydney and her mother.  And one way or another Sydney would find peace in life.  With no real surprises (though with many twists), that is pretty much how the series ended.  While the first half of the season was one of the show's low points, the second half was ALIAS at its best and reminded we fans why we watched it all in the first place.I loved the show's final episode.  If Season One of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER hadn't already used the title ""Prophecy Girl,"" it would have been a perfect title for one of the final two episodes.  Running underneath the show in its several seasons was the idea that Sydney Bristow was a chosen one (much like Buffy or, for that matter, Max Guevara on DARK ANGEL).  Her role in the culmination of Rambaldi's work had been foretold.  The final episode - co-written by Jeff Pinker and one of my favorite writers on TV, Drew Goddard (earlier a writer on BUFFY and ANGEL, later on LOST, more recently known as the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and appeared this summer in a cameo in Joss Whedon's brilliant DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG as Fake Thomas Jefferson) -- was wonderfully written, both moving forward the story that had been progressing in previous episodes and summing up the series as a whole.  The flashbacks to the young Sydney provided a sense of closure and also of fate to the series' end, as did the flash forward where we see Sydney's daughter Isabel display some the same abilities her mother possessed.  But it also ends with a sense that Isabel isn't fated to follow in the steps of her parents and grandparents.  After she quickly assembles the same geometric puzzle that her mother had as a young child, she bats it over before anyone sees what she has done, a gesture of rejection of that path and a hint that things will be different for her.So, one of the best series of the past decade comes to a close.  My own reading of TV over that time is that Buffy had made TV irreparably safe for heroic female characters.  Xena and Dana Scully had anticipated what was about to happen with empowered females on TV, but without Buffy they would perhaps have been remembered as exceptions.  Buffy was the character that changed all the roles.  Xena was too much of a cartoon to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.  But after Buffy it has been a commonplace.  But there had to be actual instances of heroic females as evidence that the rules had changed.  Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max on DARK ANGEL, and Sydney Bristow were the first -- and along with Veronica Mars and Starbuck from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still the best.  When someone writes the history of heroic women on TV, there will be a pre-Buffy section mentioning characters like the 1950s Annie Oakley, Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, Dana Scully, and Xena, then a section on Buffy, and finally the next wave.  Sydney Bristow should and will get her own chapter.  And what a great job Jennifer Garner did!  Though not trained in martial arts, she used her considerable athleticism (and early dance training -- indeed, dance seems to be a wonderful training ground for cinematic martial artists, further proof being the absolutely astonishing fight scenes by Summer Glau in SERENITY, showing that for a prima ballerina it is just choreography) to bring Sydney Bristow to life more believable than any other female hero.  In fact, to this day I've seen no TV female hero (and yes, I'm avoiding the word ""heroine"" intentionally -- ""heroines"" traditionally are anything but heroic) more physically convincing than Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow.  On top of this she brought acting chops that should have earned her a string of Emmys.  At least she got some nominations, unlike Lauren Graham, who astonishingly never got a single nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy when she should have won seven straight times.So a wonderful end to a great series.  One reason I've just rewatched this series was in anticipation of J. J. Abrams's next major series, THE FRINGE.  Hopefully that one will follow in the footsteps of this great show.",5,"The final season starts slowly, but wraps up marvelously",1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,6231,"['Warning', 'minor', 'spoilers',

Abrams had his hands full with `Lost' and `Mission Impossible 3,' and the series was finally starting to show signs of its age (which included a rather large dip in the ratings), and it came to no surprise really when Abrams and Garner jointly announced that the show would not return pass its May Finale.Despite the fact that the show now had an expiration date (and the episode order was cut from 23 to 17), Garner and company seemed to get really into these last episodes, giving them everything they had and actually brought the quality back to the early years.  Early in the season the regular cast went through a large overhale, getting rid of two older characters and bringing in four fresh-faced rookies... And with the new cast (and the storyline of Sidney growing up and becoming a mother) brought some much needed new blood into the series.In the form of a plot this final year focus's mainly on Syndey Bristow growing up and learning about all the responsibility's that come with life.  She was thrown a heavy and heart-wrenching curve in the first season, and throughout the entire season she feels the repercussions from it, realizing that she is not invincible, she isn't as young as she used to be, and that her actions affect more people than just herself.  So Sydney kinda moves into a mentoring position training and working with two new members to APO, and essentially passing the reigns off to them (it was mentioned that if the show had gone to a sixth season, Garner would have left the show and these characters would have become the main focus).Since this is a final season, that means that included is not only the series finale, but the 100th episode as well.  With only 17 episodes, the 100th episode was the fifth from the last and essientially served as a `reboot' for the series taking the story from the first 12 episodes and bringing it into the home stretch... especially by bringing back old foes and friends including Sark, Anna, Will, and a few other 'surprise' returns... while the final 4 episode successfully tied up 99% of the loose ends left throughout the series, by the final episode the audience was still left a little confused, but I think in a good way, because if this show proved anything it was that nobody really understands what is going on in their own life.Season five, while not as strong as the first two season's is definitely a step-above the third and fourth seasons, and highly recommended.  Note also that on the same day a ""complete series"" set will be coming out, so if you don't have any of the episodes, that might be the way to go...",4,Actually 4 1/2 Stars,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,2819,"['Final', 'Season', '/', 'Last', 'StandBy', 'time', 'fifth', 'season', 'Alias', 'came', 'airwaves', 'fans', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'had', 'suddenly', 'become', 'box-office', 'actress', 'soon-to-be', 'mother', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'had', 'hands', 'full', 'Lost', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '3', 'series', 'was', 'finally', 'starting', 'show', 'signs', 'age', 'included', 'rather', 'large', 'dip', 'ratings', 'came', 'surprise', 'really', 'when', 'Abrams', 'Garner', 'jointly', 'announced', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'return', 'pass', 'May', 'Finale.Despite', 'fact', 'show', 'now', 'had', 'expiration', 'date', 'episode', 'order', 'was', 'cut', '23', '17', 'Garner', 'company', 'seemed', 'get', 'really', 'last', 'episodes', 'giving', 'everything', 'had', 'actually', 'brought', 'quality', 'back', 'early', 'years', 'Early', 'season', 'regular', 'cast', 'went', 'large', 'overhale', 'getting', 'rid', 'two', 'older', 'characters', 'bringing', 'four', 'fresh-faced', 'rookies', 'new', 'cast', 'storyline', 'Sidney', 'growing', 'up', 'becoming', 'mother', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'new', 'blood', 'series.In', 'form', 'plot', 'final', 'year', 'focus', 'mainly', 'Syndey', 'Bristow', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'responsibility', 'come', 'life', 'was', 'thrown', 'heavy', 'heart-wrenching', 'curve', 'first', 'season', 'entire', 'season', 'repercussions', 'realizing', 'not', 'invincible', ""n't"", 'as', 'young', 'used', 'be', 'actions', 'affect', 'more', 'people', 'just', 'Sydney', 'kinda', 'moves', 'mentoring', 'position', 'training', 'working', 'two', 'new', 'members', 'APO', 'essentially', 'passing', 'reigns', 'was', 'mentioned', 'show', 'had', 'gone', 'sixth', 'season', 'Garner', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'show', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'main', 'focus', '.Since', 'final', 'season', 'included', 'not', 'only', 'series', 'finale', '100th', 'episode', 'well', 'only', '17', 'episodes', '100th', 'episode', 'was', 'fifth', 'last', 'essientially', 'served', 'reboot', 'series', 'taking', 'story', 'first', '12', 'episodes', 'bringing', 'home', 'stretch', 'especially', 'bringing', 'back', 'old', 'foes', 'friends', 'including', 'Sark', 'Anna', 'Will', 'few', 'other', 'returns', 'final', '4', 'episode', 'successfully', 'tied', 'up', '99', '%', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'series', 'final', 'episode', 'audience', 'was', 'still', 'left', 'little', 'confused', 'think', 'good', 'way', 'show', 'proved', 'anything', 'was', 'nobody', 'really', 'what', 'going', 'own', 'life.Season', 'five', 'while', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'definitely', 'step-above', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Note', 'also', 'same', 'day', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'episodes', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'go']",Alias - The Complete Fifth Season

1010280,A2049TBN63BAJA,B000H5V8D6,"W. Thielemans ""script editor extraordinaire""","[17, 22]","There is absoluting nothing redeeming about this season. It has become a pale shadow of the great, great first and second seasons, and collapses into unintentional selfparody.This is partially due to circumstances: Michael Vartan leaving/not leaving the show makes a mockery of the emotional throughline, Jennifer Garner's pregnancy means that she is no longer available as action heroine for a part of the season. Unfortunately the characters brought in to 'replace' her (partially) are dull and shallow (with the exception of Elodie Bouchez) and we never get the opportunity to become emotionally attached to them.The new evil organization Prophet 5 falters towards the end, the Sloane saga becomes completely ridiculous, and Irina Derevko is back - but they'd better kept her out of the series, because her actions make no sense and cheapen a fascinating character.Add to this not a single memorable action scene, clumsy plotting, bad special effects, idiotic behavior by the lead characters (time and time again), an unsatisfactory ending to the Rambaldi legend, and you are left with a barely watchable mess. Small wonder ABC didn't want to sign off for an entire 22 episode run. Alias started out on an all-time high, and gradually started a downward slide which turned into an avalanche. And all because the strength of the original concept was lost along the way: an everyday girl-next-door is actually Jane Bond. The mixture of (good) soap and outlandish spy capers, with the promise of an huge epic story unfolding in the background (the mystery of Rambaldi and the shadowy organization(s) chasing down his legacy) made Alias special. By almost completely jettisoning the 'real' part of the series (Syd's daily life and non-spy oriented concerns), it lost its true spark of genius.Extras on this set are sparse (four commentaries and about an hour of uninteresting featurettes).
