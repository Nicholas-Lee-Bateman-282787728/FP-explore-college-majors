1283350,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B002Q03LCQ,Only-A-Child,"[2, 6]","Brett Moses wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film; which seems to be about a bunch of really silly people with no ""acting for the camera skills"", who hang out in a honky-tonk bar in Jefferson County, Texas. To his ""credit"", Moses soft peddles his starring role and lists Michael ""Bronson"" Parks, Lee Ann Womack, Ryan Hurst, and Dominique Swain ahead of him on the promotional material; despite the fact that he is in every single scene and only Womack has a substantial part in the production.This is the sort of production where you can almost pick out the point where the crew finally flipped and realized it was a train wreck in the making. Then they begin secretly laughing at the writer and director, who in this case is the same poor guy. To their credit, the crew still managed to maintain their professionalism throughout the production and should get high marks for their hard work, which must have seemed like a huge waste to them. But it is one of those sow's ears to silk purse things where you just can't do much with such a hopeless script.This over-wrought melodrama has something to say but doesn't do a very good (or entertaining) job of saying it. It might have worked as a Texas style parody of a Tennessee Williams play but I think the comedy is entirely unintentional.Potential viewers would be wise to disregard the favorable comments about the movie which seem to have been posted by people associated with the production who have commented only about ""Noble Things"".Then again, what do I know?
