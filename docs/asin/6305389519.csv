462877,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,6305389519,Adron Gardner,"[4, 4]","Insomnia is quite an achievement for a first time feature director, Erik Skjoldbjrg. The photography is very good and the FEEL of the picture is top notch. Not a mystery with a gimmick ending, Insomnia instead is a moody, almost creepy portrait of a detective who's meager morality nearly rivals his prey. Skarsgard is brilliant, he is quite a presence on screen in contrast the small roles he has been limited to in Hollywood. While the Pacino remake is a good movie, the original is a darker, braver film.",4,Skarsgard shows what he's made of,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,507,"['Insomnia', 'quite', 'achievement', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'director', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'photography', 'very', 'good', 'FEEL', 'picture', 'top', 'notch', 'Not', 'mystery', 'gimmick', 'ending', 'Insomnia', 'instead', 'moody', 'almost', 'creepy', 'portrait', 'detective', 'who', 'meager', 'morality', 'nearly', 'prey', 'Skarsgard', 'brilliant', 'quite', 'presence', 'screen', 'contrast', 'small', 'roles', 'been', 'limited', 'Hollywood', 'Pacino', 'remake', 'good', 'movie', 'original', 'darker', 'braver', 'film']",N/A
462878,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305389519,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","When I first watched this film the Keitel-cult classic - of the same insightful creation - continued to impress my mind.  I speak of the lewd film, Bad Lieutenant (of which I was not overly fond of) where a corrupt cop solves the mystery of an unspeakable crime.  Insomnia oddly follows the same vein, but in more of an inconspicuous nature.  Instead of pushing the despicable nature of the main character - in this case it is Engstr&ouml;m - our fearless and simple director gives it to us very under the radar.  Pealing back each layer with delicacy, Skjoldbjrg gives us a crime, followed by a random act of innocence, followed by a small cover-up, followed up with a never-ending stream of light, which is all surrounded by the fear of the unknown and the endless possibilities that the world that has been created around us can instantly be crumbling down upon everyone involved.  I enjoyed this film so much because of this small, insatiable sensation that Skjoldbjrg instantly created with his slow moving camera, his deadpan scenes filled with Norwegian chills, and that light - the unending light that haunts Skarsgrd's flawless portrayal of Engstr&ouml;m.  It impressed me to see how the technique of light was used under the guise of night.  In most Hollywood chillers of this nature, you see night being the time when our heroes confront their fears or moral dilemmas - not here, the light brings out the inner-soul of our character and gives us a choice whether to like him or not.  The general consensus behind Engstr&ouml;m is that he is a bad character struggling with the truth, but I didn't see that.  Notice the character that Engstr&ouml;m most connects with in this film - Vik's killer.  Both claim to be innocent victims of accidents, but while they search each other out, they have trouble leaving each other's side.  You didn't see this connection as much in the remake, mainly because mainstream Hollywood always has to have a defined ""bad guy"".  Skjoldbjrg gave us a soul to the unknown.Norway is a beautiful country filled with simple people constantly dealing with deadly issues that we take as normal day-to-day living.  I loved that big city police officers were brought in to handle a murder case that obviously could not be handled by the simpleton local officers ... yet, in the end; Skjoldbjrg poses yet another question to us about who really was more knowledgeable about the case at hand.  There is a constant struggle going on during this film that makes us, the viewer, question the entire motive at hand.  We want Engstr&ouml;m to find the girl's killer, but also we want him to come clean about himself - a question we ask every heroine in a film struggling to come clean and overcome obstacles.  Yet, with Insomnia, we know nothing about Engstr&ouml;m to even ask this question.  It comes nearly as a half-hearted request because I am under the impression that he was not innocent to begin with.  Skarsgrd plays this man with suspicion and question because we are given no diagram of how this man arrived to this one location.  We hear whispers in the non-existent shadows, but nothing that fully develops his past.  He plays with our perception of ""good cop/bad cop"" like in no other movie.  There are scenes that make us cheer for him, while others (like the stint with the hotel receptionist) that make us cover our eyes and quiver our lips.  Like no other, Skarsgrd develops, matriculates, and dedicates his time to this character, ensuring that every bold step that he makes is done for a reason.  A complete reversal from what we saw him doing in Breaking the Waves or Good Will Hunting, here we see him complex and dedicated to the character at hand, continually proving that Skarsgrd is a force in the Hollywood community (i.e. see the final scene and those non-replaceable eyes).Insomnia is a film that stands directly on its own two feet without shake or instability.  While it is not quite at the level of utmost perfection (even though there are quite a bit of perfect elements) due to some slower key elements, the awkward pacing of the grand finale, and the jumbled themes of lies and deceit (especially between Engstr&ouml;m and the actual killer) - it is still a very grandiose film.  It keeps your attention, it brings about the ideas that demons do not just reside in the dark corners of your mind, but in fact in your everyday lives.  I think the best moments of this film occur when Engstr&ouml;m fights with his partner after the accident in the lighted bedroom of the hotel.  I enjoyed this the most because it gave us a rare opportunity to see a different character than what was originally presented to us.  It violently gave us a slice of the good during times when we didn't think it was humanly possible.  This may sound strange, but I also enjoyed the Norwegian accents (albeit a Norwegian film) because they added this sense of absurdity to it all.  It took us to another place; where the oddity of forever sunlight was drown out by the sounds coming out of our characters mouths.  I am not complaining or thinking this to be strange, I just thought that it added to the overall tone of the film, giving us a chance to step away from mainstream Hollywood.Overall, I would highly suggest this film to those friends and family that had not seen the Nolan remake first.  I am a believer that if you see the remake first, you will not like this film at all.  The two are not the same, and to compare the two (in the big picture) would be heresy.  I loved the acting, I loved the location, and I thought the plot was detailed, yet simple, symbolic yet original all at the same time.  This wasn't a story convoluted by deep sub-plots and overblown romances, this was a stiff drink on a cold day.  It was the perfect balance between good and evil caught in a place where you cannot hide in the shadows.  I thought it was another great addition to the Criterion library, as well as a must see for technique, storytelling, and character motivation teachers of all ages.

462879,ARA48345JZPZR,6305389519,Archmaker,"[12, 13]","There are two excellent versions of this story out now, the American one with a terrific Al Pacino performance, and this original Norwegian version with a terrific performance by Stellan Skarsgard.  Both have their strong and weak points, and while sharing a similar story they diverge quite dramatically in their overall atmosphere, philosophical take, and in several key plot elements.In many ways, I prefer this version.  There is a subtle bleached-out look to this film, bathed in the never setting Midnight Sun.  Skarsgard doesn't wear his insomnia on his sleeve, but we watch him unravel from it and from the stress of covering his tragic error.  Pacino is great with those huge puppy eyes bloodshot and bleary from sleeplessness, but the American film provides more subtext to his error which may or may not be an improvement to the viewer.  To me, I preferred the European, less clearly motivated action.The great divide is the climax of the film.  In the Norwegian version, things happen by accident and happenstance, and then have to be dealt with.  In the American version, much of the action is relentlessly determined from Pacino's subtext problem.  It then spins itself out with the logic and predictability of most American films, and of course, all is resolved in the end with a bullet.  The European take is much more surprising in that it is open to chance and accident.  The byplay between detective and killer is more specific with Pacino &amp; Williams, but also effectively carried more of the drama.In the end we see two different men, Al Pacino a burnt-out man with troubles, and Stellan Skarsgard a hollow and troubled man with a problem.  The one leads to finality, the other to ambiguity.  Take your choice.

462884,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,6305389519,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[7, 7]","Upon my initial viewing of Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's INSOMNIA, I must say I heavily favored the American remake.  But, after a second watch of this original, I was able to better construe much of the psychological complexities that dwell within the framework of this story.This is a much darker exploration into the fragility of the human soul.Instead of Alaska, this takes place in Northern Norway, just above the Artic circle.Stellan Skarsgard(Good Will Hunting) plays Jonas Engstrom, the detective transferred to help with the case.  This cop seems to have a bit of a lurid past.  Possibly a dainty, immoral disposition in regards to his sexual tendencies.  His partner jokingly mentions that Jonas was caught having an ""intimate conversation"" with an important witness to a previous case.  This immediately sets an apprehensive tone to the movie, and casts the lead character as a man with questionable ethics.In the remake, Pacino is the highly regarded detective who tampered with evidence in order to imprison a rapist/killer.  Although this was a blatant violation of police procedure, it helps the viewer sympathize with his efforts of stopping the bad guys.  A much easier road.In the fog, Jonas accidentally shoots his partner.  An honest mistake.  But why does he try to hide this fact?  I think possibly because of the guilt from his past, he didn't want any more of his mistakes exposed.Pacino had more of a reason to murder his partner, due to the apparent upcoming betrayal with Internal Affairs.  This is a much more cut and dried premise behind his acts of deception.  Hollywood prefers to incorporate obvious reasons for each character's actions, so you don't have to contemplate.Some other differences:-Jonas shoots a live dog and retracts the bullet for false evidence.  Pacino conveniently finds a dead dog to shoot?-Jonas tries to kiss the hotel receptionist, which was inappropriate.  Pacino keeps it friendly.-Jonas takes the high school girl for a ride in the car, and he rubs on her thigh in a very provocative manner.  Creepy.  The honorable Pacino resists this temptation.-Jonas secretly watches the high school couple have sex.  Creepy.  Of course I enjoyed seeing the hot naked young chick too, so I shouldn't be judgemental.I loved the route this foreign film took.  Still a couple of slight things I thought the remake did better:-during the interrogation at the high school, the student tried to punch the cop?  And he didn't get arrested?-the students were played by some older looking actors?  30yr olds usually have graduated from high school.-the chase scene over the floating logs was intense.  Not in the original.-I loved Robin Williams performance as the bad guyOverall, it's hard to pick a favorite.  Both are great films.  Still I have to go with this original, due to it's dark elements which make it slightly more believable.  If you prefer things spelled out for you and a little more light-hearted, you should stick with the American version.",5,INSOMNIA...A comparison,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3003,"['initial', 'viewing', 'Norwegian', 'director', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjaerg', 'INSOMNIA', 'must', 'say', 'heavily', 'favored', 'American', 'remake', 'second', 'watch', 'original', 'was', 'able', 'better', 'construe', 'much', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'dwell', 'framework', 'story.This', 'much', 'darker', 'exploration', 'fragility', 'human', 'soul.Instead', 'Alaska', 'place', 'Northern', 'Norway', 'just', 'Artic', 'circle.Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Jonas', 'Engstrom', 'detective', 'transferred', 'help', 'case', 'cop', 'have', 'bit', 'lurid', 'past', 'Possibly', 'dainty', 'immoral', 'disposition', 'regards', 'sexual', 'tendencies', 'partner', 'jokingly', 'mentions', 'Jonas', 'was', 'caught', 'having', 'intimate', 'conversation', 'important', 'witness', 'previous', 'case', 'immediately', 'apprehensive', 'tone', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', 'man', 'questionable', 'ethics.In', 'remake', 'Pacino', 'highly', 'regarded', 'detective', 'who', 'tampered', 'evidence', 'order', 'imprison', 'rapist/killer', 'was', 'blatant', 'violation', 'police', 'procedure', 'viewer', 'sympathize', 'efforts', 'stopping', 'bad', 'guys', 'much', 'easier', 'road.In', 'fog', 'Jonas', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'partner', 'honest', 'mistake', 'why', 'try', 'hide', 'fact', 'think', 'possibly', 'guilt', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'more', 'mistakes', 'exposed.Pacino', 'had', 'more', 'reason', 'murder', 'partner', 'due', 'apparent', 'upcoming', 'betrayal', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'much', 'more', 'cut', 'dried', 'premise', 'acts', 'deception', 'Hollywood', 'prefers', 'incorporate', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'character', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'contemplate.Some', 'other', 'differences', '-Jonas', 'shoots', 'live', 'dog', 'bullet', 'false', 'evidence', 'Pacino', 'conveniently', 'dead', 'dog', 'shoot', '-Jonas', 'tries', 'kiss', 'hotel', 'receptionist', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'Pacino', 'friendly.-Jonas', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'ride', 'car', 'thigh', 'very', 'provocative', 'manner', 'Creepy', 'honorable', 'Pacino', 'temptation.-Jonas', 'secretly', 'high', 'school', 'couple', 'have', 'sex', 'Creepy', 'course', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'hot', 'naked', 'young', 'chick', 'too', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'judgemental.I', 'loved', 'route', 'foreign', 'film', 'took', 'Still', 'couple', 'slight', 'things', 'thought', 'remake', 'did', 'better', '-during', 'interrogation', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'tried', 'punch', 'cop', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'arrested', '-the', 'students', 'were', 'played', 'older', 'looking', 'actors', '30yr', 'olds', 'usually', 'have', 'graduated', 'high', 'school.-the', 'chase', 'scene', 'floating', 'logs', 'was', 'intense', 'Not', 'original.-I', 'loved', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'bad', 'guyOverall', 'hard', 'pick', 'favorite', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'Still', 'have', 'go', 'original', 'due', 'dark', 'elements', 'make', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'prefer', 'things', 'spelled', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'should', 'stick', 'American', 'version']",N/A

At his request, he's sent to Norway, along with his partner, to work on a murder which took place in Tromso, a small town above the Arctic Circle. He and his partner arrive to find there is no night. It's bright all 24 hours, and he can't sleep. In a stake out to catch the killer, he shoots a figure he sees in the fog. He finds he has killed his partner. He covers up by making it appear the real killer was the shooter.The rest of the movie is a study of his attempts to keep the cover-up in place (going so far as to place the killer's revolver under the bed of a young suspect, then having it discovered). He also is struggling to find the real killer. Engstrom, throughout, is exhausted by lack of sleep and his own emotional desolation. He seems unable to allow anyone to get close to him. He may be a brilliant cop, but he's also not above being a dirty one at times. At the conclusion, the real killer through Engstrom's efforts has been indentified and has died, and Engstrom departs for Sweden. It appears that he is just as desolate a person as when he arrived.This is a terrific movie with a wonderful performance by Stellan Skarsgard. It bears repeated viewing.

But, while it only became apparent near the end that 'Se7en' was really about the detectives rather than the killer, this film is a relentless study of a morally void cop.  In his first scene, we see Jonas scribbling over the victim's face; and a blunder in the early stages of the investigation finds him covering up the truth about the murder, rather than trying to reveal it, leading to an unholy pact with the killer.This perversion of the detective's traditional role is visualised in two related ways.  Firstly, the enlightenment the detective should bring, but here suppresses, is displaced onto the 24-hour bleaching sunlight of the Northern Norwegian coastal town in which the film is set.  A Swede in a hostile environment, and already guilty of abusing his position with sexual misdemeanours, Jonas tries to block out this light which prevents him from sleeping.  Lack of sleep begins to effect not only his morality, but his judgement - he gropes a teenage witness; he spies on her making love to the young sap he is going to frame; he nearly rapes the hotel receptionist he lusts after.  The film's rhythms and visuals take on the character of this psychological breakdown - the pace decelerates, becomes bleary and dream-like; the narrative fragments, heightened by the hallucinatory and visionary; the clinical white that seeps the frame blocks out all depth and perspective, leaving everything flat and on the surface.  Allied to this sun, which is too bright to shed any light, is the dusky, enveloping fog, wastes of garbage and delapidated buildings with their subterranean passages destroying any chance of truth and resolution emerging.It is a tribute to Stellan Skarsgard's brave, controlled performance as a nasty, gutless, uncontrolled psychotic, that it is at all possible to watch this unpleasant but compelling film to the end.",4,More a 'film blanc' than a film noir.,1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,2108,"['announces', 'yet', ""'Se7en"", 'clone', 'brutal', 'opening', 'murder', 'lovingly', 'detailed', 'dehumanised', 'execution', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'handcraft', 'beginning', 'Fincher', 'film', 'nervy', 'scratchy', 'credits', 'sequence', 'only', 'became', 'apparent', 'end', ""'Se7en"", 'was', 'really', 'detectives', 'rather', 'killer', 'film', 'relentless', 'study', 'morally', 'void', 'cop', 'first', 'scene', 'see', 'Jonas', 'scribbling', 'victim', 'face', 'blunder', 'early', 'stages', 'investigation', 'covering', 'up', 'truth', 'murder', 'rather', 'trying', 'reveal', 'leading', 'unholy', 'pact', 'killer.This', 'perversion', 'detective', 'traditional', 'role', 'visualised', 'two', 'related', 'ways', 'Firstly', 'enlightenment', 'detective', 'should', 'bring', 'here', 'suppresses', 'displaced', '24-hour', 'bleaching', 'sunlight', 'Northern', 'Norwegian', 'coastal', 'town', 'film', 'set', 'Swede', 'hostile', 'environment', 'already', 'guilty', 'abusing', 'position', 'sexual', 'misdemeanours', 'Jonas', 'block', 'out', 'light', 'sleeping', 'Lack', 'sleep', 'begins', 'effect', 'not', 'only', 'morality', 'judgement', 'teenage', 'witness', 'making', 'love', 'young', 'sap', 'going', 'frame', 'nearly', 'hotel', 'receptionist', 'film', 'rhythms', 'visuals', 'take', 'character', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'pace', 'bleary', 'dream-like', 'narrative', 'fragments', 'heightened', 'hallucinatory', 'visionary', 'clinical', 'white', 'frame', 'out', 'depth', 'perspective', 'leaving', 'everything', 'flat', 'surface', 'Allied', 'sun', 'too', 'bright', 'shed', 'light', 'dusky', 'enveloping', 'fog', 'wastes', 'garbage', 'delapidated', 'buildings', 'subterranean', 'passages', 'destroying', 'chance', 'truth', 'resolution', 'emerging.It', 'tribute', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'brave', 'controlled', 'performance', 'nasty', 'gutless', 'uncontrolled', 'psychotic', 'possible', 'watch', 'unpleasant', 'compelling', 'film', 'end']",N/A

462892,ADL6AMKXSXILM,6305389519,Dr. Geek,"[2, 2]","Erik Skjoldbjrg's ""Insomnia"" unfolds like a standard police procedural: murder, body, autopsy, evidence, suspect, questioning. But it is detective Jonas Engstr&ouml;m's (played by Stellan Skarsgrd) interest in this particular case, caused not just by the original murder but his implication surrounding it, where the film deviates from this formula. Engstr&ouml;m's involvement causes him to lose sleep - hence the title of the film - with his grasp on reality slipping from him, much like his investigation. Skjoldbjrg frames Skarsgrd in tight, dark claustrophobic spaces. When Skarsgrd walks through a dark alleyway, he comes alive, his senses and awareness heightened. His exposure to Norway's midnight sun dulls him. In another scene, he almost sexually assaults a front desk clerk. Here, again, Skjoldbjrg frames Skarsgrd in a tight shot within a dark, cramped room, the only bit of light coming from an unknown source. Skjoldbjrg's use of light and darkness is most obvious in Engstr&ouml;m's bedroom. Kept awake by the peering sun, Engstr&ouml;m covers his window with a thick, heavy sheet; at the same time, he is beginning to cover-up a crime and frame another. Toward the end of the second act, Engstr&ouml;m begins to have doubts about his actions, searching for a way to rid himself of his problem. Here, Skjoldbjrg's direction calls for Engstr&ouml;m's placing of a new sheet over the window, one much lighter than the previous with a perforation right in the center, light creeping through it and lighting Engstr&ouml;m's head. Throughout Insomnia, Engstr&ouml;m's moral center, along with Skjoldbjrg's direction, is an interplay between light and darkness.

Stripping this film of its foreignness, I realized that this would be a great thriller/crime drama here in the states, sure to do well in the box office and probably be up there in the average B+ range for critics. Tossing that foreignness back on, the movie shifts to that A range (which it seems barely any movie makes it to nowadays).The reason for this is no doubt the Norwegian/Swedish cast and Erik Skjoldbjrg direction in the ethereal landscape of Norway. The fact of the matter is, there is rarely a ethereal scene. Most shots are focused on the characters or are limited to a space in which the character may run off to. Skjoldbjrg somehow manages to find the grime and darkness of Norway (which, for those of you who have been there may agree, is one heck of a feat; as houses are brightly painted (as are buildings in the cities), trees lush and green, rolling hills with hues of yellow and green so rich).  Not to mention the fact that this is Northern Norway, one of the ""Lands of the Midnight Sun"". Swedish actor, Stellan Skarsgrd who is currently doing quite well in Hollywood, is fantastic.  His spiral downward is as rough on him as it is on the viewer.For language buffs, like myself, Norwegian and Swedish are spoken throughout the movie.  In the world of linguistics, it seems that is is a well known fact that Norwegians understand Swedish much better than Swedes understand Norwegian.  There is a scene where the detective, who is from Sweden, speaks to a Norwegian in Swedish and the man complains he hasn't a clue what he is saying.

Although the remake directed by Christopher Nolan is certainly good, the original is something that should not be missed.Stellan Skarsgard plays a homicide detective, Jonas, who goes to the north of Norway to investigate the murder of a girl. He accidentally shoots and kills his partner while tracking the murder suspect through the fog and panics, trying to cover up this crime (throughout the film becoming more worried about the evidence against him than about the case at hand, manipulating the evidence more and more to cover his tracks). Unfortunately the murderer he is investigating sees him commit this crime and uses this information to his advantage. Jonas's perspective is clouded more and more as both his sleeplessness and paranoia come to cloud his judgment completely. What really makes this taut thriller work, beyond a good story/script and the moral ambiguity inherent in every move, is Skarsgard's convincing portrayal of Jonas.

However, as the film progresses, Engstrom's actions resemble more and more those of the killer whom he is trying to catch. It is possible that Engstrom's actions are due to his lack of sleep caused by the endless days in the Arctic Circle, but unlike in the 2002 remake, which starred Al Pacino and Robin Williams, it is never really made clear as to whether this is the real reason or not.

Wilson ""Tapehead and Avid Reader""","[10, 11]","Within the first thirty seconds of watching Insomnia you get the impression that it is one of those Criterion releases which is worth the higher DVD price. Opening with a grainy montage reminiscent of Seven, Norwegian Erik Skjoldbjaerg's impressive directorial debut is a darker and more intelligent film that the later remake starring Al Pacino of which Americans are familiar.The original Insomnia stars Stellan Skarsgard as Jonas Engstrom, a disgraced but talented Swedish detective. After being caught in an ""intimate conversation"" with a witness, he seeks a transfer to Norway as a means to escape the scandal threatening his career. Along with his partner, he is sent to investigate the murder of a 17-year-old girl in Tromso, a small Norwegian town above the arctic circle.One of the greatest distinctions between the two film versions is the depiction of the central character. The original film isn't scared to show us a darker side of the detective. Unlike the later toned down depiction, he's far less likeable, and at times cruel and self-serving. Ultimately, this dark anti-hero proves to be a more convincing vessel for the film's theme of disintegration.Engstrom is suffering from a severe bout of insomnia, caused by the unrelenting 24 hour sunshine in Tromso. The film's near monotone visuals reflect his distorted perspectives as sleep deprivation takes its toll. After accidentally shooting his partner, he panics, making a series of disturbing decisions calculated to deflect suspicion from himself. He hopes to blame his partner's death on the killer they were pursuing when the accident occurred.Unfortunately, the killer has witnessed the shooting and knows the truth. Using this information to his advantage, he forces Engstrom to embark on a sinister game of cat and mouse. As Engstrom is drawn further into a web of deception, he begins to morally decay before our eyes. Tortured by his inability to sleep and guilty conscience, each moral compromise Engstrom makes further blurs the line between the himself and the murderer he is hunting.Insomnia's strength lies in Skarsgard's low key portrayal of the detective. He was in his mid forties when he played Engstrom, yet looks much younger. His attractive, quiet demeanor masks his inner turmoil perfectly.Not surprisingly, it was Skarsgard's powerful back-to-back performances in Lars Von Trier's Breaking the Waves and Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia that opened the doors to a series of roles in Hollywood films. While once virtually unknown outside Scandinavia, he has since become an Internationally acclaimed actor.The Criterion release boasts a beautiful 16x9 anamorphic transfer with good sound quality.

I much prefer the latter version.Insomnia concerns a police officer who tries to catch a killer. The officer, however, commits a crime that the killer witnesses. Cop and criminal then become partners - of a sort. Insomnia explores the identities of both men. Who is the villain? Who is the hero? Insomnia is a subtle thriller that challenges the viewer's preconceptions.My wife and I visited Scandinavia last summer. The beautiful (and remote) settings in this film are amazing. Though I enjoyed the story, the film would be worth watching for the scenery alone.The cast of the film is excellent - they bring the understated, Nordic characters to life. Many of the characters interact in interesting ways.

However, in terms of characterisation and plot development, I found this version to be much more worthwhile.  first of all, this makes the protagonist to seem much less ethical and moral in comparison to the 'heroic' al pacino in the new version.  It was what it claimed to be : a straightforward psychological thriller, with the added quirk of the amorality - or seeming nature thereof - of the protagonist.Directorially, and cinematographically, however, it's nothing really new.  If anything, it feels slightly dated in production and direction.  For a crisper, more ""avant-garde"" touch, try the new version - and just don't watch the last fifteen minutes.
