I understand why the title is what it is, but I think they should have changed it.  It just doesn't have the ""Hey, I wanna watch this!"" factor.  But hey, It is what it is and the movie speaks for itself!The film centers around Mark (Jamie Blackley), a charismatic young athlete who is very well liked and is boosting with confidence.  He attends a private school and spends the rest of his time chatting on the computer with Rachel (Jaime Winstone), a troubled young girl that we discover is in witness protection and is dating a psychotic guy, Ryan (James Burrows) that, for some reason or another, is living with her.  During the conversations, she tells Mark that she fears for her brother, John (Toby Regbo).  He's been getting picked on at school and she needs Mark to look after him.  Mark agrees and shortly after becomes friends with John.  During this time, Mark attempts to chat with Rachel again.  However, this time Ryan takes over the keyboard.  He tells Mark that if he ever talks to Rachel again he won't hesitate to kill him and her.  This is when the movie REALLY starts to get interesting because after not hearing from John for a few days, Mark heads to his home to check on him only to discover some alarmingly bad news.That's as much as I want to give away of the plot because it really needs to be scene.  And as the title states, had it not been based on a true story, I wouldn't have believed it.  Or, at least, I would have thought the writers didn't know how to finish a good story.The acting is top notch!  It kills me that there as so many good actors and actresses out there that never really get the attention they deserve.  Production, sound, quality,...everything is top of the line in this movie!  My only real complaint is the fact that when they are ""chatting"" online, they NEVER use the proper punctuation, or spelling of letters, or capitalization.  I know,...that sounds like a REALLY dumb thing to be complaining about, but they simple fact that it is such a big part of the movie, it REALLY irritated me.  But again, that actually might have been the way all the messages were written in real life?Aside from that, I dug everything about the film, itself.  I would have given it a 5 star, but the fact that I only see it as a ""single viewing"" experience, I had to go with a four.Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  You'll enjoy it!If you found my review to be helpful please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below so I feel like I'm doing something right.

It's the first serious movie I've ever seen about a psychopathic internet troll and the big, proud, kind-hearted but somewhat lunk-headed jock whom he manipulates.  Production-wise, it's lean and stripped-down, delivering its chilly scenes with stark effect, with a lot of location shooting at absolutely the scariest-looking Council Flats I have ever seen in a movie.  It's U.K. but you'll hardly notice, accents aren't strong for some reason (not that British accents are bad, I like them a lot, but don't let fear of them keep you away from this one!).",5,Hitchcock would like this one,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,629,"['teen', '34', 'Strangers', 'Train', '34', '21st', 'century', 'first', 'serious', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'psychopathic', 'internet', 'troll', 'big', 'proud', 'kind-hearted', 'somewhat', 'lunk-headed', 'jock', 'whom', 'Production-wise', 'lean', 'stripped-down', 'delivering', 'chilly', 'scenes', 'stark', 'effect', 'lot', 'location', 'shooting', 'absolutely', 'scariest-looking', 'Council', 'Flats', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'U.K.', ""'ll"", 'hardly', 'notice', 'accents', 'are', ""n't"", 'strong', 'reason', 'not', 'British', 'accents', 'are', 'bad', 'like', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fear', 'keep', 'away', 'one']",Uwantme2killhim?
