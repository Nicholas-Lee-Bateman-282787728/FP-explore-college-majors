Lutz ""blood vamp""","[13, 19]","Transformers Trilogy is an amazing thrill ride from start to finish!You get 3 of the best action packed movies made that will please any true transformer fan.I have been a transformer fan since the beginning in the 1980's and have loved every single minute of all three movies done.All three have very good storylines with well placed action scenes mixed with some comedy&romance for 3 great quality movies.The first movie is an introduction to the transformers like Optimus,Bumblebee,Megatron,and Starscream for example while setting up the base storyline of the battle between the autobots and decepticons.In the Revenge of the Fallen you get the continuing romance between Sam and Mikaela while some new transformers are introduced into the series with a compelling plot by a new decepticon that concerns a natural resource.Revenge Of The Fallen is an awesome all around sequel that is as good as both of the other films with just as many amazing special effects.Dark of The Moon is probably the best in the set with the most intricate storyline and the most action from start to finish.Sam gets a new girlfriend in Carly and finds himself in the middle of the decepticon autobot war again,but is more battle ready from his previous experiences.The moon holds a secret that sets up the movie storyline along with a decepticon plot.If you like transformers you will love this trilogy set.Bottom line Transformers Trilogy is a high quality,10 out of 10,action packed DVD set that will please any true transformer fan all around.I highly recommend Transformer Trilogy for all Transformer fans out there.Transformers Rule!!!",5,ravage 24/7,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,1623,"['Transformers', 'Trilogy', 'amazing', 'thrill', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'get', '3', 'best', 'action', 'packed', 'movies', 'made', 'will', 'please', 'true', 'transformer', 'fan.I', 'have', 'been', 'transformer', 'fan', 'beginning', '1980', 'have', 'loved', 'single', 'minute', 'three', 'movies', 'done.All', 'three', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'storylines', 'well', 'placed', 'action', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'romance', '3', 'great', 'quality', 'movies.The', 'first', 'movie', 'introduction', 'transformers', 'Optimus', 'Bumblebee', 'Megatron', 'Starscream', 'example', 'setting', 'up', 'base', 'storyline', 'battle', 'autobots', 'decepticons.In', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'get', 'continuing', 'romance', 'Sam', 'Mikaela', 'new', 'transformers', 'are', 'introduced', 'series', 'compelling', 'plot', 'new', 'decepticon', 'natural', 'resource.Revenge', 'Fallen', 'awesome', 'sequel', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'many', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects.Dark', 'Moon', 'probably', 'best', 'set', 'most', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'most', 'action', 'start', 'finish.Sam', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Carly', 'middle', 'decepticon', 'autobot', 'war', 'again', 'more', 'battle', 'ready', 'previous', 'experiences.The', 'moon', 'secret', 'up', 'movie', 'storyline', 'decepticon', 'plot.If', 'transformers', 'will', 'love', 'trilogy', 'line', 'Transformers', 'Trilogy', 'high', 'quality,10', '10', 'action', 'packed', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'please', 'true', 'transformer', 'fan', 'around.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Transformer', 'Trilogy', 'Transformer', 'fans', 'out', 'there.Transformers', 'Rule']",N/A
