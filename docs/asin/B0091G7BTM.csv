1583905,A27Q1LRDZK3C76,B0091G7BTM,EpsilonX,"[15, 15]","12 films for $8.  How can you go wrong?  Most of these movies are pretty bad (but still pretty enjoyable) but you get so many in this collection, it's hard to say no.  Puppet Master series is about an old toymaker whose creations have come to life to kill people.  Killjoy is about a demon clown who comes to get revenge for whoever summoned him (just to give you an idea.)  Some of the films look pretty decent picture quality-wise, and some of them look really bad.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other in the case, which may lead to scratching the discs, so be careful with them.  I really wish that the films were 3 per disc and packaged differently.  The set would be much better if so, even if it was slightly more expensive (maybe $2 more)Review is so short because there isn't much else to say about this collection.  Recommended, just make sure your expectations are in check.  None of these films are GREAT, some are a stretch to even call them good, but they are enjoyable for what they are, and that is cheesy horror fun.  If you care at all about picture quality, get one of the more expensive sets.  There are a few collections that run about $30 each, which isn't bad, and the quality is much better.  If you're a fan of this series, it may be worth considering.  However, if you're just looking for some cheesy movies to watch without much of a loss financially, this set will do you good.Disc 1: Puppet Master 1-5Disc 2: Puppet Master 6-9Disc 3: Killjoy 1-3",4,"Great bargain, just know what to expect",1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1485,"['12', 'films', '8', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'collection', 'hard', 'say', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'old', 'toymaker', 'creations', 'have', 'come', 'life', 'kill', 'people', 'Killjoy', 'demon', 'clown', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'whoever', 'summoned', 'just', 'give', 'idea', 'films', 'look', 'pretty', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality-wise', 'look', 'really', 'bad', 'discs', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'case', 'may', 'lead', 'scratching', 'discs', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'really', 'wish', 'films', 'were', '3', 'disc', 'packaged', 'differently', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'even', 'was', 'slightly', 'more', 'expensive', 'maybe', '2', 'more', 'Review', 'so', 'short', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'say', 'collection', 'Recommended', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'expectations', 'are', 'check', 'None', 'films', 'are', 'GREAT', 'are', 'stretch', 'even', 'call', 'good', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'are', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'fun', 'care', 'picture', 'quality', 'get', 'one', 'more', 'expensive', 'sets', 'are', 'few', 'collections', 'run', '30', ""n't"", 'bad', 'quality', 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'considering', 'However', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'watch', 'much', 'loss', 'financially', 'set', 'will', 'do', 'good.Disc', '1', 'Puppet', 'Master', '1-5Disc', '2', 'Puppet', 'Master', '6-9Disc', '3', 'Killjoy', '1-3']",N/A

Instead of continuing to think the story goes into the next movie try to think of each film as a new beginning with a new story with bites from the others since throughout the films some of the dates and stories do not match up this may confuse you a little so like I have said think of the next movie as a new beginning. Usually the first film is the best because they start the series but I think there are others better than the first one throughout the film including `Puppet Master: Axis of Evil' it is a newer one and honestly I would sort of start with that one first because the writer gave a more better look into how it all got started except the puppets look more fake than the other ones and are not exactly the same as the ones you fall in love with from the other movies.
