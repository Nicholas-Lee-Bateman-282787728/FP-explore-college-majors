999865,ASP6GYZPZ3FE0,B000GAKJAA,"Anthony Ian ""anthony_ian""","[2, 3]","What is utterly, utterly fascinating about this film is that it literally follows them from the very beginning.  You get Stewart-shot Super 8 footage of them driving around America from tiny gig to tiny gig, hauling their own gear and staying at fleabag motels.  With a crew of... two.Then things start to change.  The gigs start getting bigger, the crowds larger, the hotels nicer.  You are there the first time they return to England after one of their singles breaks and you see their awe as fans mob them at the airport.  Soon the touring van is replaced by touring bus which is then replaced by touring... plane.It really, really is a voyeuristic, mindblowing look from their perspective, literally.  More from their perspective looking at the audience.  This is NOT a behind-the-scenes look at them in the studio, save for a few killer scenes from Zenyatta and Ghost.  No fights or arguments or groupies.Truly eerie to see them from the very, very beginning.  Watch it with Stewart and Andy's commentary for the second time.  In fact, you could watch this the first time--it's a better narrative for what's going on.BIGGEST BONUS: I don't know where they came from, but the whole film is littered with alternate takes and EARLY, early versions of classic Police songs that I have never heard before.  There's wild early takes on ""I Burn for You,"" ""Tea in the Sahara,"" songs from Ghost with piano on them that wasn't on the album.  Some of the songs are virtually unrecognizable from their eventual versions--only the lyrics give them away.For any Police die-hard, you must see this.  It's basically home movies, but oh what movies they are.  Casual fans will probably not think much of this, and that's fine.Casual fans wanting to get an early look at the Police should rent/buy the video ""Police Around the World.""It runs up until about their appearance in the US Festival in 1982 or 83.",4,For Police Die-Hards a Must-See; for Casual Fans Not So Much,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,1894,"['What', 'utterly', 'utterly', 'fascinating', 'film', 'literally', 'very', 'beginning', 'get', 'Stewart-shot', 'Super', '8', 'footage', 'driving', 'around', 'America', 'tiny', 'gig', 'tiny', 'gig', 'hauling', 'own', 'gear', 'staying', 'fleabag', 'motels', 'crew', 'two.Then', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'gigs', 'start', 'getting', 'bigger', 'crowds', 'larger', 'hotels', 'nicer', 'are', 'there', 'first', 'time', 'return', 'England', 'one', 'singles', 'breaks', 'see', 'awe', 'fans', 'mob', 'airport', 'touring', 'van', 'replaced', 'touring', 'bus', 'then', 'replaced', 'touring', 'plane.It', 'really', 'really', 'voyeuristic', 'mindblowing', 'look', 'perspective', 'literally', 'More', 'perspective', 'looking', 'audience', 'NOT', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'studio', 'save', 'few', 'killer', 'scenes', 'Zenyatta', 'Ghost', 'No', 'fights', 'arguments', 'groupies.Truly', 'eerie', 'see', 'very', 'very', 'beginning', 'Watch', 'Stewart', 'Andy', 'commentary', 'second', 'time', 'fact', 'could', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'better', 'narrative', 'what', 'going', 'on.BIGGEST', 'BONUS', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'came', 'whole', 'film', 'littered', 'alternate', 'EARLY', 'early', 'versions', 'classic', 'Police', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'wild', 'early', 'Burn', 'Tea', 'Sahara', 'songs', 'Ghost', 'piano', 'was', ""n't"", 'album', 'songs', 'are', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'eventual', 'versions', 'only', 'lyrics', 'give', 'away.For', 'Police', 'die-hard', 'must', 'see', 'basically', 'home', 'movies', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'Casual', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'fine.Casual', 'fans', 'wanting', 'get', 'early', 'look', 'Police', 'should', 'rent/buy', 'video', 'Police', 'World', 'up', 'appearance', 'US', 'Festival', '1982', '83']",The Police - Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out

I figured that if Stewart Copeland had 50 hours of video saved that this would make for an interesting documentary right? Well... not quite.  There are way too many time lapse shots from hotel windows and most of the documentary is just funny moments between band members and their road crew.  You won't see a lot of behind the scenes/in the recording studio moments or things of that sort, that's for sure.  It's true there is not a lot of concert footage but, for me, that's ok.  That's not why I bought the DVD in the first place.  The commentary with Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers is, for the most part, interesting and should be heard.  The biggest letdown of all is that Sting has had no involvement with this for whatever reason.  I saw him on a talk show with Robert Downey Jr. and no mention of this DVD was even brought up.  Even though it's not quite what I expected, I like this and any Police fan should buy it.  There's not a lot of revelations or full songs played in concert(I think I heard about 10 seconds of ""Every Breath You Take"" somewhere in the film during a recording studio segment) but I personally didn't expect that when I heard it was from Copeland's 50 hours of home video he had saved all these years.

Copeland is a smart guy, but for some reason chose to make a dull movie.It has documentary value, presenting a compressed view of years of touring (and some studio moments). But much of this footage just confirms how repetitive and boring this kind of life tends to be.I had hoped to get an insight into a mystery that had puzzled me--the unproductiveness of this band. Five albums in five years, no additional songs as singles, and the albums were made very quickly, containing a lot of filler material. Copeland has compared The Police to the Beatles, but there were far fewer songs, and of much lower ambition (the chord sequence to ""Every Breath you Take"" is nothing more than ""Heart and Soul"" revamped). With all that time sitting around in dressing rooms or on tour buses, why didn't they use it to do what they were supposed to be doing--making music?

999869,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000GAKJAA,Clare Quilty,"[12, 18]","..I hate to have to say it but I was tremendously disapointed with ""Everyone Stares.""I'm a huge Police fan. They were the first band I ever loved. I heard ""Can't Stand Losing You"" as a 13-year-old kid in 1983 and I was gone, loved 'em, bought every album and listened to each song over and over, with no skipping around or anything.I even like ""Mother,"" off ""Synchronicity,"" *that's* how big a Police fan I am.And I'm also a huge Stewart Copeland fan. I've always thought he didn't get enough credit for his work or his side projects, particularly ""Rumble Fish.""But ""Everyone Stares"" is kind of a drag. It consists of Copeland's Super-8 footage which he apparently shot during every waking moment of the Police's career -- their early van-packed touring days, their moment of ascension, their superstardom, dinnertime, naptime....Basically what you get is lots and lots of muddy handheld camera work. It's admirable that he got all this stuff, but it's all basically studios, crowds, planes, trains, cars, stages. And that's kind of Copeland's point -- that being in a big band like the Police is bizarre and disorienting.But it feels like there needs to be more substance than just a series of home movies.Copeland's subjects -- Sting, Andy Summers, fans, roadies -- bascially react to his lens in one of three ways: 1) they mug for the photographer, 2) they act a little uncomfortable, like Ross McElwee is hiding being the Super-8 and primarily 3) they snarl and/or growl, ""Get that camera off me!""Some music movies make you want to rush out and hear the tunes by a particular band, but this film actually made me weary of them. I'm glad Copeland was able to get what he got in terms of performance footage, but mostly we see/hear multiple muddy live versions of a the same few songs, mostly ""So Lonely.""Copeland's narration also hurts the film. He's a very nice, very smart guy, and I know he wanted to tell his own story, but the writing is lazy and twee and feels a little disingenuous. Stuff like, ""We were riding a wave of this new music called 'punk,'"" ""Success was just around the corner and we wanted our share,"" ""The touring life began to seem normal and the homelife began to seem surreal.""  Copeland himself doesn't even seem to buy the ""gee whiz"" tone of what he's saying.Anybody who disagrees with me on this film is probably going to say that I'm looking for a different documentary, and I'm sure one day there'll be a finely reported examination of who the Police are and all that factors that made up, say, ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" and ""Ghost in the Machine.""But in just trying to give a band's eye view, Copeland has made something that's so close to the center of the storm, you don't get any sense of any of the overall aspects of the storm itself -- what contributed to it, what it affected, how it came about and how it all ended.",2,A disappointing look at a great band,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2849,"['..I', 'hate', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'tremendously', 'disapointed', 'Everyone', 'Stares', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Police', 'fan', 'were', 'first', 'band', 'ever', 'loved', 'heard', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stand', 'Losing', '13-year-old', 'kid', '1983', 'was', 'gone', 'loved', 'bought', 'album', 'listened', 'song', 'skipping', 'around', 'anything.I', 'even', 'Mother', 'Synchronicity', 'how', 'big', 'Police', 'fan', 'am.And', ""'m"", 'also', 'huge', 'Stewart', 'Copeland', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'credit', 'work', 'side', 'projects', 'particularly', 'Rumble', 'Fish', 'Everyone', 'Stares', 'kind', 'drag', 'Copeland', 'Super-8', 'footage', 'apparently', 'shot', 'waking', 'moment', 'Police', 'career', 'early', 'van-packed', 'touring', 'days', 'moment', 'ascension', 'superstardom', 'dinnertime', 'naptime', '.Basically', 'what', 'get', 'lots', 'lots', 'muddy', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'admirable', 'got', 'stuff', 'basically', 'studios', 'crowds', 'planes', 'trains', 'cars', 'stages', 'kind', 'Copeland', 'point', 'being', 'big', 'band', 'Police', 'bizarre', 'disorienting.But', 'be', 'more', 'substance', 'just', 'series', 'home', 'movies.Copeland', 'subjects', 'Sting', 'Andy', 'Summers', 'fans', 'roadies', 'bascially', 'react', 'lens', 'one', 'three', 'ways', '1', 'mug', 'photographer', '2', 'act', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'Ross', 'McElwee', 'hiding', 'being', 'Super-8', 'primarily', '3', 'snarl', 'and/or', 'growl', 'Get', 'camera', 'music', 'movies', 'make', 'want', 'rush', 'out', 'hear', 'tunes', 'particular', 'band', 'film', 'actually', 'made', 'weary', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Copeland', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'what', 'got', 'terms', 'performance', 'footage', 'mostly', 'see/hear', 'multiple', 'muddy', 'live', 'versions', 'same', 'few', 'songs', 'mostly', 'So', 'Lonely', 'Copeland', 'narration', 'also', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'very', 'smart', 'guy', 'know', 'wanted', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'writing', 'lazy', 'twee', 'little', 'disingenuous', 'Stuff', 'were', 'riding', 'wave', 'new', 'music', 'called', ""'punk"", 'Success', 'was', 'just', 'corner', 'wanted', 'share', 'touring', 'life', 'began', 'seem', 'normal', 'homelife', 'began', 'seem', 'surreal', 'Copeland', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'buy', 'gee', 'whiz', 'tone', 'what', 'saying.Anybody', 'who', 'film', 'probably', 'going', 'say', ""'m"", 'looking', 'different', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'finely', 'reported', 'examination', 'who', 'Police', 'are', 'factors', 'made', 'up', 'say', 'Zenyatta', 'Mondatta', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'just', 'trying', 'give', 'band', 'eye', 'view', 'Copeland', 'made', 'something', 'so', 'close', 'center', 'storm', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'overall', 'aspects', 'storm', 'what', 'contributed', 'what', 'affected', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'ended']",The Police - Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out

I think, as other reviewers will attest, this adds to the film's charm and re-enforces that it is ""real"" and not some recreation of actual events. I can't imagine anyone seeing this film who is not a fan of the Police, but if you are a fan, this film is a must-see for you. Oh - one great thing about seeing the film at the premiere: Stewart Copeland was there on stage at the relatively small theater for a Q&A following the film. It was very intimate - and the theater was so small, nobody needed microphones and so you felt like you were part of something really special. Stewart introduced Andy Summers who was sitting in the audience, and the two answered questions about everything - including, ""Will the Police get together for a reunion tour?"" Quite bluntly, Stewart said, ""No."" And moved on to other questions. Audience persistance lead him to say words to this effect (this is not a quote): ""Sting is on another planet in terms of his music today. Even in the Police, his mind was racing in other directions. Andy (Summers) and I felt so fortunate to hold onto him in the Police for as long as we did, but we couldn't hold on forever. There are no ill feelings, and we talk - but only rarely.

You can witness for yourself the excitement of a screaming crowd or being mobbed by fans after the show. The tedium of recording albums, doing interviews or photo shoots, or the dreadful aspect of constant travel. I have seen some of this super-8 footage before, but the majority I had not.

999882,A1AMKT1VGXRB6H,B000GAKJAA,"Nicole N. Pellegrini ""sockii""","[59, 60]","""I blame the man holding his camera for all of my problems.""It's the final scene of ""Everyone Stares"" that kept running through my mind after seeing the film for the first time. This is not so much because of Sting's parting words as quoted above, but more the image itself, and how much more it seems to be telling us than what directly meets the eye. We see Andy and Sting, though Stewart's ""eyes"" via the camera lens, as they are all handcuffed to the railing of a precarious-looking staircase perched high above a city. The reasons for this unusual predicament are never quite explained, but it seems to make a telling statement about the band itself at that particular moment of time: cramped and trapped together at the top, and dangerously close to falling over the edge.To those critics who have claimed that this film has no depth to it? I say that clearly, you simply weren't paying enough attention.This film is not a strictly linear, fact-laden and/or impartial documentary. Neither is it the expose of ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" (emphasis on sex and drugs) that some curiosity-seekers seemed determined it should have been and were disappointed that it wasn't. Instead, it is a fractured, personal collection of video ""snapshots"", capturing the small moments of life on the road as well as the absurdities and monotonies of becoming a rock star. For the well-versed Police fans, it is also a chance to experience the thrill of seeing events, concerts, and even photo-sessions from a perspective we've never seen before. It begins with a clever montage sequence of animated photographs as Stewart sets the scene with his narration, covering the early days of the band until he purchases his Super 8 camera, and suddenly the action really takes off, in more ways than one.There is an interesting, dreamlike quality to the entire movie, which seems to come from the Super 8 footage itself: it is somewhat grainy, rendering every scene in a softer focus than we are used to on a big screen. As cars, boats, people, clouds and cities zoom by in time-lapse footage, and as stage lights blur past the camera when Stewart rushes on stage or struggles to get through crowds of fans, this sense of ""unreality"" slowly builds and at times it becomes almost dizzying. (It is also hard to believe that the Derangements were not written specifically for the soundtrack of this film, as they provide the perfect mixed-up/familiar-yet-different mood for everything we see, and the lyrics sometimes provide interesting and clever accents to the particular moments being shown.)As for individual scenes themselves, I actually don't want to talk too much about my favorites, because a great deal of the enjoyment of them comes from being surprised by what you get to see, as well as the amusing little ""subtitles"" or comments Stewart adds to them. I think the first-time viewer is better off getting to experience that surprise for him or herself. Suffice to say the audience--particularly the avid Police fan--is likely to be incredibly amused and delighted at many moments, and wrapped up in the story overall as we get to experience it as if we were a member of the band ourselves.While all seems to be fun and games at first, the cracks within the band slowly begin to start surfacing as the film progresses. It's presented with subtlety, not with in-your-face fights and screaming contests. It comes through more in small comments in Stewart's narration, as that ""unreality"" builds and we start to get the underlying sense that all is not as well as it might seem. The piles of money may be growing, but weariness and unease is settling in. The hotel rooms may be growing bigger, but they seem to have become more like prison cells than the familiar, cozy havens on the road they were years before. Indeed, it seems as though the band members have all become literally and figuratively handcuffed to that ivory tower, and as Stewart says near the end, it's time to break free from it all and really ""learn what this life is all about.""In its own unique, quirky way, I'd say that ""Everyone Stares"" is just as revealing an autobiography as Sting's ""Broken Music"" was a few years ago. It's a piece of the Police story we've been missing, and as a fan, I have to say it makes me feel now that the story is complete in a way I didn't feet it was at all, three years ago after the Hall of Fame ceremony.The DVD itself comes with some truly great extra features as well, most especially the audio commentary track by Copeland and Summers. Their comments and stories fill in the details of what we see on screen in the movie and make it all the more enjoyable on further viewing. Extra scenes include some humorous moments as well as a collection of ""Live Shards"", small sequences of live performances that didn't make the film but make for interesting viewing nevertheless.A great film and a great DVD.

Knowing who they were is where this DVD takes off from, and it brings a 'behind the curtain' view of the performers across the years.  Stewart Copeland, the band's founder/drummer, glommed onto an 8mm sound camera and hung on as it commanded his soul.  The obsession with this camera grafted to his hand was evident in some of the early photo shoots and videos.  Now you can see all that footage edited down and put to a story of this famous rock band's rise to fame.It starts with still photos from the earliest years and quickly transitions into the film as Stewart (and Andy Summers) procure their cameras.  Instead of getting a pre-polished, over packaged, over thought, mush glorification of the band you get the band, as themselves, filmed by one of them, narrated by the band (one, or two of them depending on the audio track).  Due to the film being a home effort, it wasn't taken with any specific purpose in mind other then Stewart having fun or documenting things of immediate interest in the day.  He experiments with stop motion, titles(Kim dumps a take?), time lapse, makes a fiction with Andy and supporting act, but more importantly he is holding the camera as the band starts touring as a stripped down, low rent act and builds to a gigantic world consuming success.  Looking back you can laugh sympathetically as Sting has to lug his suitcase and bass into the hotel room, or as he finds the limo at the airport isn't for him.  Then you see a rock star's pov as a surprise crowd mobs his band at the airport for the first time.  Clips of the band and crew all over the world, as well as silly, impromptu humor give the video a lively, warm feel.  It's a home movie!  But, it explains what the band did that you never saw.There are two audio tracks.  The first is Stewart's narrative, and I found it adequate but a little boring.  Half way through the film I was wondering what I was doing watching, but it picked back up and got me through.  The second track is commentary by Stewart and Summers, and their comments make the film fly by as they explain the context of shots and also joke about the images.Additional footage edited, but deemed important or entertaining, is lumped in the extras section.If you loved the band, and want to see them in their more private spaces, then $10 is a pittance.

999887,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000GAKJAA,Tom Benton,"[1, 1]","""I blame the man behind the camera for all my troubles.""So says Sting, staring grimly off into the sunset, in the final scene of Stewart Copeland's ""Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out"".  That scene alone would have garnered a hefty sum of money on video prior to the release of Copeland's hypnotic documentary, but in ""Everyone Stares"", Copeland does more: he provides us with a candid, no-holds-barred look at the journey that led Sting to make that defining comment.  In 1978, when a wannabe punk rock group calling themselves The Police had just released their first album, drummer and founder Copeland purchased a nifty new toy: a Super 8 camera, the precursor to the modern day camcorder.  During the following five years, Copeland documented the band skyrocketing from pretentious punks to rock gods.  It's a fascinating ride, and though it's not exactly a linear representation of the band's rise and - well, unofficial disbandment - it provides a clear and often appalling look at how the band and its members changed over time.We don't see much of Copeland, save for in a few scenes.  One of the most memorable involves a well-documented fight between Sting and an audience member at a live performance.  Copeland places the Super 8 camera on a tripod behind him and, using a mic, turns around and explains the fight breaking out in front of us while doing some mindblowing drumming.  Guitarist Andy Summers shows up a lot, and is clearly a fun and colorful guy; early on it becomes clear why Summers was called the glue that held the band together all those years.  Sting is a ball of ferocious creativity from start to finish; the only different is that, at finish, his ego has taken control.  Copeland documents how Sting took control of the recording from ""Ghost in the Machine"" to ""Synchronicity"", shutting the rest of the band out, and how he forced the group to disband at the peak of their popularity.""Everyone Stares"", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in '06, is sort of a mixed bag.  It contains some wonderful footage that is really meaningful and demonstrative of the life and behavior of The Police and its members, but it also contains some ridiculous fooling-arounds of the band members that could be done without.  The film, which includes some headache-inducingly fast-paced and hallucinatory editing, has no smooth flow.  And Copeland's quirky narration, though funny at times, is often a little dull.  A big plus are Copeland's ""derangements"" of Police songs.Personally, as a Police fanatic, I found ""Everyone Stares"" to be informative, interesting, but nothing wonderful.  Is it neat?  Oh yeah - for the Police fan.  However, if you're not a die-hard Police lover, this is not the film for you.  If you are, by all means give it a shot.  The DVD also includes some cool and equally informative deleted scenes (a few of which could have replaced the more unnecessary sequences of the film) as well as snippets of a few Police live performances and a bonus commentary with Copeland and Andy Summers.  All in all, ""Everyone Stares"" is a wonderful opportunity for Police diehards to walk in the footsteps of one of rock's all-time greatest bands, but the film will hold little appeal for anyone else.",4,Walking in their footsteps,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,3242,"['blame', 'man', 'camera', 'troubles', 'So', 'Sting', 'staring', 'grimly', 'sunset', 'final', 'scene', 'Stewart', 'Copeland', 'Everyone', 'Police', 'Inside', 'Out', 'scene', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'hefty', 'sum', 'money', 'video', 'prior', 'release', 'Copeland', 'hypnotic', 'documentary', 'Everyone', 'Stares', 'Copeland', 'more', 'candid', 'no-holds-barred', 'look', 'journey', 'led', 'Sting', 'make', 'defining', 'comment', '1978', 'when', 'wannabe', 'punk', 'rock', 'group', 'calling', 'Police', 'had', 'just', 'released', 'first', 'album', 'drummer', 'founder', 'Copeland', 'purchased', 'nifty', 'new', 'toy', 'Super', '8', 'camera', 'precursor', 'modern', 'day', 'camcorder', 'following', 'five', 'years', 'Copeland', 'documented', 'band', 'skyrocketing', 'pretentious', 'punks', 'rock', 'gods', 'fascinating', 'ride', 'not', 'exactly', 'linear', 'representation', 'band', 'rise', 'well', 'unofficial', 'disbandment', 'clear', 'often', 'appalling', 'look', 'how', 'band', 'members', 'changed', 'time.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Copeland', 'save', 'few', 'scenes', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'well-documented', 'fight', 'Sting', 'audience', 'member', 'live', 'performance', 'Copeland', 'Super', '8', 'camera', 'tripod', 'using', 'mic', 'around', 'fight', 'breaking', 'out', 'front', 'doing', 'mindblowing', 'drumming', 'Guitarist', 'Andy', 'Summers', 'up', 'lot', 'clearly', 'fun', 'colorful', 'guy', 'early', 'clear', 'why', 'Summers', 'was', 'called', 'glue', 'held', 'band', 'together', 'years', 'Sting', 'ball', 'ferocious', 'creativity', 'start', 'finish', 'only', 'different', 'finish', 'ego', 'taken', 'control', 'Copeland', 'documents', 'how', 'Sting', 'took', 'control', 'recording', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'Synchronicity', 'shutting', 'rest', 'band', 'out', 'how', 'forced', 'group', 'disband', 'peak', 'popularity', 'Everyone', 'Stares', 'premiered', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', ""'06"", 'sort', 'mixed', 'bag', 'wonderful', 'footage', 'really', 'meaningful', 'demonstrative', 'life', 'behavior', 'Police', 'members', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'fooling-arounds', 'band', 'members', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'headache-inducingly', 'fast-paced', 'hallucinatory', 'editing', 'smooth', 'flow', 'Copeland', 'quirky', 'narration', 'funny', 'times', 'often', 'little', 'dull', 'big', 'plus', 'are', 'Copeland', 'derangements', 'Police', 'songs.Personally', 'Police', 'fanatic', 'found', 'Everyone', 'be', 'informative', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'wonderful', 'neat', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Police', 'fan', 'However', ""'re"", 'not', 'die-hard', 'Police', 'lover', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'means', 'give', 'shot', 'DVD', 'also', 'cool', 'equally', 'informative', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'replaced', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'sequences', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'snippets', 'few', 'Police', 'live', 'performances', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'Copeland', 'Andy', 'Summers', 'Everyone', 'Stares', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'Police', 'diehards', 'walk', 'footsteps', 'one', 'rock', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'bands', 'film', 'will', 'hold', 'little', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'else']",The Police - Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out
