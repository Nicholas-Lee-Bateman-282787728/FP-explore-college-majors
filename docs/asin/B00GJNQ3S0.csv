The next day, when I had dinner with my parents I mentioned to movie so they went to go see it that night.  And yes.  I went along to see it again.My brother and his wife loved the movie as well.  I took my best friend Jessica and she loved it even though she was crying through parts of it.It's sad that this did not even get nominated for the Oscars.

This has been a labor of love for Mr. Derbez: It took him twelve long years to raise the money to create this film and distribute it in los Estados Unidos.Please enjoy:* Eugenio Derbez (&#34;Under the Same Moon&#34;) is a happy playboy in Acapulco when a former fling dumps their baby girl in his lap; he didn't know she was pregnant, nor did he know how to change a diaper. Six years later, after struggling to pay the bills, he has become a top stuntman in Hollywood. You'll smile at their father/ daughter pajamas; in fact you'll think perhaps he is a bit too indulgent.* Loreto Peralto in her film debut, is the surprise package. She has become her father's on-set coach and taught him how to be a worthwhile adult, even as he has supported and loved her. Listen to her switch between Spanish and English as she negotiates his pay raises.* Jessica Lindsey (&#34;Now You See Me&#34;) resurfaces and jeopardizes the life our hero has built with his wise and much-loved daughter. There are a few surprises with her, too.Everything in this sweet but salty personal project is painted with broad strokes, there is NO subtlety here. Our hero's fears are represented by wolves, whether it's his fear of commitment or fear of heights, he sees wolves! Problem is, the pleasure of watching these characters lulls you into a false sense of superiority, then the story sneaks up on your blind side.Find a theater in your area where you can see this one...please.I WILL own this DVD (I pre-ordered it from Amazon and recommended it to my JayFlix.net folks)!",5,I WILL Own This DVD!,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,2051,"['34', 'se', 'Aceptan', 'Devoluciones', '34', 'English', 'captions', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'phenomenon', 'second', 'week', 'currently', 'tenth', 'highest-grossing', 'foreign', 'film', 'U.S.', 'history', 'track', 'third', 'place', 'NOTE', 'December', '2013', 'become', 'highest-grossing', 'Spanish', 'language', 'film', 'American', 'history', 'Directed', 'Mexican', 'superstar', 'Eugenio', 'Derbez', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'marks', 'heart-warming', 'funny', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'central', 'issue', 'been', 'labor', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Derbez', 'took', 'twelve', 'long', 'years', 'raise', 'money', 'create', 'film', 'distribute', 'los', 'Estados', 'Unidos.Please', 'enjoy', '*', 'Eugenio', 'Derbez', '34', 'Same', 'Moon', '34', 'happy', 'playboy', 'Acapulco', 'when', 'former', 'fling', 'dumps', 'baby', 'girl', 'lap', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'pregnant', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'change', 'diaper', 'Six', 'years', 'later', 'struggling', 'pay', 'bills', 'become', 'top', 'stuntman', 'Hollywood', ""'ll"", 'smile', 'father/', 'daughter', 'pajamas', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'think', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'indulgent', '*', 'Loreto', 'Peralto', 'film', 'debut', 'surprise', 'package', 'become', 'father', 'on-set', 'coach', 'taught', 'how', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'adult', 'even', 'supported', 'loved', 'Listen', 'switch', 'Spanish', 'English', 'pay', '*', 'Jessica', 'Lindsey', '34', 'Now', 'See', 'Me', '34', 'resurfaces', 'life', 'hero', 'built', 'wise', 'much-loved', 'daughter', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'too.Everything', 'sweet', 'salty', 'personal', 'project', 'painted', 'broad', 'strokes', 'subtlety', 'here', 'hero', 'fears', 'are', 'represented', 'wolves', 'fear', 'commitment', 'fear', 'heights', 'wolves', 'Problem', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'characters', 'lulls', 'false', 'sense', 'superiority', 'then', 'story', 'up', 'blind', 'side.Find', 'theater', 'area', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'please.I', 'WILL', 'own', 'DVD', 'pre-ordered', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'JayFlix.net', 'folks']",Instructions Not Included

My preference in movies are not really the humor type, I like to get a broader grasp of the human experience than just pure comedy.That is what I thought at first...Then the movie continued, and then it just hit you in the end! I won't reveal the plot or the characters so you can watch this for yourself. I loved this movie. I loved the close paternal relationship that was portrayed, not at all like the type of machismo male Latin man that I have known about. Eugenio Derbez was just excellent in this and I did learn that not only was he the main actor but he was the producer, the director and the co-writer.Danny Lopez, who I was fortunate to have met yesterday, and he's about the nicest guy you would ever encounter--very down to earth, very accessible and very friendly was very funny in his roles. I want to thank you, Danny, for the advice you gave me; your words to me will be remembered forever.The cinematography was beautiful, the script was clear and fresh, and it's always a viewer's delight to learn about different cultures, in this case about Acapulco, Mexico. It's spoken in Spanish and English. The symbol about his nemesis--the wolves was very apt too. I loved the graphic art about the letters that came from the mother to the little girl. Loreto Peralto is a very talented and very bright young actress, I do hope her career goes far. Just to be bilingual at her young age is remarkable enough and you do just fall in love with her.Buy this movie for your sweetheart for Valentine's Day and let the whole family enjoy it. There is a PG-13 rating on it, but I thought it was actually a very clean movie. It might bring up views about life and how we deal with it. Maybe not appropriate for young children, but for an older aged family movie, I highly recommend it.This movie has already been nominated for the People's Choice Awards. Thank you, Danny for turning me on to this film that you starred in, I would have never known about it if I hadn't visited with you yesterday. I hope for all the actors, the producers, the entire production cast and everyone involved that this will be a very, very successful hit.We need more good movies like this, although it was heart-breaking at the end.Kelly CyrAuthor of Supreme Love: A Battered Woman's True Story",5,Movie surprised me and was not at all what I expected,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,2596,"['bought', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'meeting', 'Danny', 'Lopez', 'who', 'two', 'roles', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'persona', 'Aztec', 'Indian', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'out', 'week', 'DVDs', 'started', 'watching', 'thought', 'oh', 'comedy', 'video', 'cover', 'comedic', 'slant', 'wondered', 'would', 'like', 'preference', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'humor', 'type', 'like', 'get', 'broader', 'grasp', 'human', 'experience', 'just', 'pure', 'comedy.That', 'what', 'thought', 'first', 'Then', 'movie', 'continued', 'then', 'just', 'hit', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'plot', 'characters', 'can', 'watch', 'loved', 'movie', 'loved', 'close', 'paternal', 'relationship', 'was', 'portrayed', 'not', 'type', 'machismo', 'male', 'Latin', 'man', 'have', 'known', 'Eugenio', 'Derbez', 'was', 'just', 'excellent', 'did', 'learn', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'main', 'actor', 'was', 'producer', 'director', 'co-writer.Danny', 'Lopez', 'who', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'met', 'yesterday', 'nicest', 'guy', 'would', 'ever', 'encounter', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'very', 'accessible', 'very', 'friendly', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'roles', 'want', 'thank', 'Danny', 'advice', 'gave', 'words', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'script', 'was', 'clear', 'fresh', 'always', 'viewer', 'delight', 'learn', 'different', 'cultures', 'case', 'Acapulco', 'Mexico', 'spoken', 'Spanish', 'English', 'symbol', 'nemesis', 'wolves', 'was', 'very', 'apt', 'too', 'loved', 'graphic', 'art', 'letters', 'came', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'Loreto', 'Peralto', 'very', 'talented', 'very', 'bright', 'young', 'actress', 'do', 'hope', 'career', 'far', 'Just', 'be', 'bilingual', 'young', 'age', 'remarkable', 'enough', 'do', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'her.Buy', 'movie', 'sweetheart', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'let', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'clean', 'movie', 'might', 'bring', 'up', 'views', 'life', 'how', 'deal', 'Maybe', 'not', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'older', 'aged', 'family', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.This', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'nominated', 'People', 'Choice', 'Awards', 'Thank', 'Danny', 'turning', 'film', 'starred', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'had', ""n't"", 'visited', 'yesterday', 'hope', 'actors', 'producers', 'entire', 'production', 'cast', 'everyone', 'involved', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'successful', 'hit.We', 'need', 'more', 'good', 'movies', 'was', 'heart-breaking', 'end.Kelly', 'CyrAuthor', 'Supreme', 'Love', 'Battered', 'Woman', 'True', 'Story']",Instructions Not Included

Power ""nlp trainer""","[1, 1]","Instructions Not Included cost about $6 million to make and grossed over $90 million internationally at the box office which makes it a huge hit.That astonishing statistic was enough to get me to watch this movie, and I am so glad I did because it is one of the best movies of last year, and one of the most amusing and emotionally touching movies I have seen in some time.For one thing it's hard to believe it only cost $6 million to make because it looks as good, and is as professionally well made as movies costing several times that amount.Set variously in Acapulco and Beverly Hills, it relates a well developed three dimensional story of a man named Valentin who leads a carefree irresponsible life in Acapulco, as a local lothario mostly occupied with seducing more than his fair share of the many beautiful women who populate and visit Acapulco. His carefree life is turned upside down when one of his former loves turns up and he is left holding a small living breathing responsibility. Like many of us he has fears and insecurities, his fears amusingly represented by a dark four legged creature. At the beginning he is selfish. If you're like me you will wonder if his heart is big enough for what it is required to do.Circumstances sent him on a quest to Hollywood way outside his usual comfort zone, and he manages to luck into the movie business, in a job which tests his insecurities and this is where this becomes a rather beautiful story, with many unexpected twists and turns, very endearing.The two main actresses in the movie do an amazing job. The former lover played by Jessica Lindsey has tremendous poise, presence and beauty, and the young actress Loreto Peralta plays the girl without affectation, speaks in two languages and has great chemistry with Valentin. Eugenio Derbio who plays Valentin does a rather spectacular job in this movie wearing the multiple hats of director and lead actor, and delivers a movie which one has to admit is developed from a great story, and emotionally this story is pitch perfect.The one caveat about this movie is that it may not be suitable for young children, a matter for your personal discretion. Much of the movie is subtitled, and even though Spanish is not among my languages this did not present any obstacle to my enjoyment as the movie unfolds in such a visual conveying as much if not more with facial expressions and gestures rather than words.I think most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.",5,A beautiful story exquisitely told,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2489,"['Instructions', 'Not', 'Included', 'cost', '6', 'million', 'make', 'grossed', '90', 'million', 'internationally', 'box', 'office', 'huge', 'hit.That', 'astonishing', 'statistic', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'watch', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'amusing', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'time.For', 'one', 'thing', 'hard', 'believe', 'only', 'cost', '6', 'million', 'make', 'as', 'good', 'professionally', 'well', 'made', 'movies', 'costing', 'several', 'times', 'amount.Set', 'variously', 'Acapulco', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'well', 'developed', 'three', 'dimensional', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Valentin', 'who', 'carefree', 'irresponsible', 'life', 'Acapulco', 'local', 'lothario', 'mostly', 'occupied', 'seducing', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'many', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'populate', 'visit', 'Acapulco', 'carefree', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'one', 'former', 'loves', 'up', 'left', 'holding', 'small', 'living', 'breathing', 'responsibility', 'many', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'fears', 'amusingly', 'represented', 'dark', 'four', 'legged', 'creature', 'beginning', 'selfish', ""'re"", 'will', 'wonder', 'heart', 'big', 'enough', 'what', 'required', 'do.Circumstances', 'sent', 'quest', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'usual', 'comfort', 'zone', 'luck', 'movie', 'business', 'job', 'insecurities', 'where', 'rather', 'beautiful', 'story', 'many', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'very', 'endearing.The', 'two', 'main', 'actresses', 'movie', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'former', 'lover', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Lindsey', 'tremendous', 'poise', 'presence', 'beauty', 'young', 'actress', 'Loreto', 'Peralta', 'girl', 'affectation', 'speaks', 'two', 'languages', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Valentin', 'Eugenio', 'Derbio', 'who', 'Valentin', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'job', 'movie', 'wearing', 'multiple', 'hats', 'director', 'lead', 'actor', 'movie', 'one', 'admit', 'developed', 'great', 'story', 'emotionally', 'story', 'pitch', 'one', 'caveat', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'matter', 'personal', 'discretion', 'Much', 'movie', 'subtitled', 'even', 'Spanish', 'not', 'languages', 'did', 'not', 'present', 'obstacle', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'such', 'visual', 'conveying', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'rather', 'words.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Instructions Not Included

The movie starts out pretty slow and some of the jokes are kind of corny. It starts to pick up about 20 minutes or so onward. Most of the acting in the film is average, but Derbez should be praised for directing and co-writing. There is a lot symbolism in the movie that is very smartly placed throughout the movie.The real standout in the film is Loreto Peralta (Maggie), who Derbez discovered through Twitter! She is fluent in Spanish and English and her transition between the two languages (even within the same scenes) is flawless. This is her first acting role and everything about her performance is seamless and believable. She and Derbez are humorous and charming, and Peralta handles the more emotional scenes excellently. I have a feeling we'll certainly be seeing more of her in both American and Mexican projects. The ending is very touching and surprising, so don't be tempted to read spoilers.

In a quick montage, we see him hooking up with a slew of women. Then one day, an ex-girlfriend, an American woman named Julie, shows up at his apartment with a baby. She hands Valentin the baby, asks for $10 to pay the cab, and of course does not come back. Valentin is completely overwhelmed with this baby, and for a while the movie feels like &#34;Two Men and a Baby&#34;. But not long thereafter, through a clever montage, we see the little girl (whose name we learn is Maggie) turning into a 6 yr. old. Because Maggie is desparate to see her mom, Valentin and Maggie decide to move to Los Angeles, and after hitchhiking their way from Acapulco to LA, Valentin ends up getting a job as a stunt double in Hollywood. Life is good but then one day, he gets a call out of the blue from Julie, now living in New York and wanting to come see Maggie. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a triumph for Eugenio Derbez, who directs, stars (as Valentin), co-writes and co-produces this delightful movie. Second, the movie swings back-and-forth between comedy and drama without any problem. But the funniest scenes are truly laugh-out-loud funny. The American influences on this movie are very clear (from &#34;Two Men and a Baby&#34; early on to &#34;Kramer vs. Kramer&#34; deep into the movie), yet it is all brought with a refreshing new look and take. Third, there are a number of other remarkable performances besides Derbez, none more so than Loreto Peralta as the 6 yr. old Maggie. Besides speaking both English and Spanish fluently, Peralta beams on the screen with her vibrant personality. We surely will see this little girl in more movies! Check out also Daniel Raymont as Frank, Valentin's boss and friend oin the studio lot. In a blink-it-and-you-will-miss-it scene, it appears that Johnny Depp makes a cameo as &#34;Aztec Man&#34;, the movie for which Valentin serves as a stunt double. (Turns out that it's not Depp, but instead a mere Depp-lookalike.) Last but not least, look out for the ending of the movie, which I did not see coming at all! (No worries, I won't spoil.)This movie has become an unexpected box office hit since its release in late August. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati in early September was PACKED, I am happy to say. That said, there is a reason this movie is rated PG-13. This is NOT a family movie a la Disney, so do yourself (and your children) a favor and do not take your 7 yr. old or 10 yr. old to see this. But for the rest of us, this movie is like a breath of fresh air among the seemingly non-stop comic book superhero movies and other assorted Hollywood mega-ness. &#34;Instructions Not Included&#34; is one of those &#34;little movies that could&#34;.

1678603,AROWZGGO4VTJU,B00GJNQ3S0,"The Tech Fanatic ""The Tech Fanatic""","[0, 0]","I normally try to avoid writing reviews because they take some time out of your life. Time that you could use to get things done, like chores, for example. But I broke that rule today after watching this movie during my break from chores. And I am glad that I did. Anyway, I feel that everyone should watch this movie for what it teaches and the love that it brings out.First, I did not know anything about this movie when I watched it. I had no idea who Eugenio Derbez is and I simply did not care that it was English subtitled due to Spanish dialogue for a lot of parts. But after watching this movie, I came away with more than I could get from a long lesson in Spanish (I took advanced placement in Spanish in college due to my love of the culture). But I was impressed with this movie's use of the rich cultural aspects of the people in Mexico. Well, enough of the academe and on to the movie...I will not spill out the beans on what happens in this movie. I will just give vague terms for this movie so as not to ruin it for anybody. The fact that I didn't know anything about this movie actually worked for me. Had I known the plot, it might have taken a little away for me.The main theme of this movie is about overcoming one's fears. It is presented in all kinds of forms that are really hilarious. The uses of allegory is ingenious. It is used extremely well. I really loved the initial presentation of the protagonist's childhood. Those scenes really endeared the character to me.This movie delves much into the adoptive parenting that many have had difficulties with as adopted children. I have a friend whose sister renounced her parents because they did not tell her that she was adopted (this movie is not about this point so don't worry it's not going to ruin it for you that way).  I could never understand the sister's behavior going as far as making a mockery of the adoptive mother's funeral. That was truly sad and tragic. This movie will pronounce what it means to be an adoptive parent or otherwise. When a parent raises a child alone it and does everything in his or her powers to give that child a happy life, he or she is a true parent. Just because he has a job that may take him or her away for many an event or to just because it is unconventional does not make it any less. In fact, even adoptive parents or unconventional parents who rub society the wrong way with their unconventional raising may be just as good or even better than the conventional two-parent household.I was one of those kids raised in an unconventional way due to my parents' immigration from another country. They had to give up so much just to give their children a better life. And my appreciation to them has grown even more after having watched this movie. I know now that I must do more to show them that I appreciate what they did for me. I did not understand it at the time when I was growing up as I did without a lot of things that other children took for granted such as toys and even the access to cable tv. But now I know, I was rich in a different way.This movie delves into a lot of deep matter that is not present in many blockbuster movies that we have nowadays. To compare them to this movie is like comparing fast food to a home-cooked meal that has been prepared with a lot of love. This movie is in the latter and most movies today such as Transformers is strictly visceral entertainment. Like a fast food meal, it does the job. But it lacks substance. There are so many things covered in this movie but I will leave that to you as each person comes away with a different take on what the director and writer may have had in mind. And so my review is a personal one which will be different for all others. All I am saying is that you should watch this movie. You will come away spiritually richer for it.As for entertainment, this movie packs it in. I have never seen a movie that was so full entertainment that I caught my attention for the entire movie. You will not be bored for a moment. The comedy, along with slapstick, will leave you laughing throughout. I have never been so happy while watching a movie. And there will be twists. And the twist will not be thrown in there just to be there. But there will be good reason for the twist. This movie is so intelligently made that it all comes together perfectly.After having watched this movie, my perspectives have changed a whole lot. Even with my feelings about my friends' sister who mocked her adoptive parents. My perspective of my parents have changed a great deal and thanks to this movie I have a more intelligent way of thinking about how they raised me and how much they must have loved me to sacrifice so much.I shall not wander too much with this review. I shall just encourage you to watch it for what its worth, a magical funny movie that trumps many heavy Oscar-nominated big blockbuster movies. It's even got a Johnny Depp look-alike playing as Johnny Depp. How much funnier is that? Go see it. You can thank me later.",5,One Of THE Best Movies You Will Ever Watch In Your Life (No Spoiler Here),1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,5013,"['normally', 'try', 'avoid', 'writing', 'reviews', 'take',
