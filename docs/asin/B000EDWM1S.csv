972090,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B000EDWM1S,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[15, 18]","Written and directed by internationally acclaimed Indian filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, ""The Chess Players"" is an award-winning film which would appeal to an international audience for its historic content blended with human drama and touches of humour and irony.  Unlike most Indian films known as `Bollywood', this film has none of the usual features of the popular musicals, and in fact, adds a few of its own unique touches such as comical animation to explain the historic setting of the story.  Although there is a brief song and dance scene, it is part of a performance given to the king, and the only touch of Bollywood is the narrator, `Mr Bollywood' himself, Amitabh Bachchan.  His narration explains the situation in India in 1856 when the British East India Company encroached on the last bastion of Indian rulership, but far from being an exciting, action-packed thrilling war movie, ""The Chess Players"" tells a more realistic story about attitudes, cultures and the personal lives of a few people caught up in the changing tide of events.  The chess players are two friends who are so preoccupied with playing chess all day that they neglect their family responsibilities and are unperturbed by the British plans to take over their city.  Even the Indian ruler himself prefers to compose songs and poems, fly kites and be entertained by his harem rather than attend to the affairs of state, and no doubt this film is something of a social statement as well as a history lesson.  But rather than a dry and dull historic epic, Ray has managed to tell the whole story through the two main characters, the chess players, often with a tongue-in-cheek humour which makes the film highly enjoyable.  Although realistic, there is still an elegant and artistic style overall, and ""The Chess Players"" is also visually impressive, with colourful authentic costumes of the period, real Mogul buildings and palaces, as well as characters speaking their own languages.  There are several scenes with English, and easy-to-follow English subtitles when locals are speaking Hindi or Urdu.  Very authentic, traditional Indian music is also heard at times in the background, adding to the overall realistic atmosphere of this period film.  There is no great, thrilling climax, suspense or attempts to overly entertain except perhaps with the subtle comedy about realistic events and human relationships, and perhaps this very feature of being down-to-earth makes ""The Chess Players"" a welcome change from either Bollywood or Hollywood, and although it was filmed in 1977, it is still fresh and even timeless due to its subject matter and first class performances by the fine actors, one of whom is Sir Richard Attenborough as the British General.  For an authentic, good dose of real India and its glorious royal history (albeit in decline), this film is hard to beat.",4,A realistic and human story out of India's past,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,2857,"['Written', 'directed', 'internationally', 'acclaimed', 'Indian', 'filmmaker', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Chess', 'Players', 'award-winning', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'international', 'audience', 'historic', 'content', 'blended', 'human', 'drama', 'touches', 'humour', 'irony', 'most', 'Indian', 'films', 'known', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'none', 'usual', 'features', 'popular', 'musicals', 'fact', 'few', 'own', 'unique', 'touches', 'such', 'comical', 'animation', 'explain', 'historic', 'setting', 'story', 'brief', 'song', 'dance', 'scene', 'part', 'performance', 'given', 'king', 'only', 'touch', 'Bollywood', 'narrator', 'Mr', 'Bollywood', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'narration', 'situation', 'India', '1856', 'when', 'British', 'East', 'India', 'Company', 'encroached', 'last', 'bastion', 'Indian', 'rulership', 'far', 'being', 'exciting', 'action-packed', 'thrilling', 'war', 'movie', 'Chess', 'Players', 'more', 'realistic', 'story', 'attitudes', 'cultures', 'personal', 'lives', 'few', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'changing', 'tide', 'events', 'chess', 'players', 'are', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'preoccupied', 'playing', 'chess', 'day', 'neglect', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'are', 'unperturbed', 'British', 'plans', 'take', 'over', 'city', 'Even', 'Indian', 'ruler', 'prefers', 'compose', 'songs', 'poems', 'fly', 'kites', 'be', 'entertained', 'harem', 'rather', 'attend', 'affairs', 'state', 'doubt', 'film', 'something', 'social', 'statement', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'lesson', 'rather', 'dry', 'dull', 'historic', 'epic', 'Ray', 'managed', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'chess', 'players', 'often', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humour', 'film', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'realistic', 'still', 'elegant', 'artistic', 'style', 'overall', 'Chess', 'Players', 'also', 'visually', 'impressive', 'colourful', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'period', 'real', 'Mogul', 'buildings', 'palaces', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'speaking', 'own', 'languages', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'English', 'easy-to-follow', 'English', 'subtitles', 'when', 'locals', 'are', 'speaking', 'Hindi', 'Urdu', 'Very', 'authentic', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'music', 'also', 'heard', 'times', 'background', 'adding', 'overall', 'realistic', 'atmosphere', 'period', 'film', 'great', 'thrilling', 'climax', 'suspense', 'attempts', 'overly', 'entertain', 'perhaps', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'realistic', 'events', 'human', 'relationships', 'perhaps', 'very', 'feature', 'being', 'down-to-earth', 'Chess', 'Players', 'welcome', 'change', 'Bollywood', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'filmed', '1977', 'still', 'fresh', 'even', 'timeless', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'first', 'class', 'performances', 'fine', 'actors', 'one', 'whom', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'British', 'General', 'authentic', 'good', 'dose', 'real', 'India', 'glorious', 'royal', 'history', 'decline', 'film', 'hard', 'beat']",Chess Players

It's not actually faulty but this film demands lavish colour and sound which has not been captured.

And as the British attempt to checkmate the flaky king, even open-minded, Hindi-speaking Captain Weston (Tom Halter) forfeits his conscience to buy in to the new regime.

It is a human account of how people allow themselves to believe what they want to believe and choose the path of ease to their own detriment.Using two different seemingly unconnected dramas to reveal human nature's folly and how no matter how different people may be in culture or material goods; there is a tendency to ignore the unpleasant.The chess players, two friends of great means are so greatly obsessed with their games that they fail to acknowledge it's impact on their relationships and ultimately their lifestyle.  Each player cheats and at times their are spats.  Until one day, sharp, hurtful words are traded and then injury ensues.  It would seem that their friendship seems irrevocably damaged.  Meanwhile, the Raj is immersed in a fantasy world of the most lovely things, composing poetry and enjoying his riches.All the while, the British demand more and more from the Raj to ""remain"" friends (not unlike a business owner pays protection money to the mobsters in his neighborhood).  However, the elite and the King fail to recognize the British continue to increase their demands to remain friends.  This is shadowed by the wives of the chess players actions towards their husbands for abandonment of their duties for their love of a game.Eventually, it is most obvious that the chess game is a reflection of the British Empire's domination over all of India.  When the Raj is confronted with signing away his kingdom or facing a war (for which he has no army or weapons -since the British told him they would be his protection).  He must face reality.  Likewise, the chess players realize they aren't truly friends, they just share a compulsion.This is an exceptional story with excellent foreshadowing.  Through the clever use of metaphors in the story; we are challenged to evaluate how we have sold our freedom to live comfortably.  Are we allowing trickery and laziness to fool us into thinking we can ""buy"" peace (which costs us little) until our own reality penetrates our fantasy with the truth.

972096,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B000EDWM1S,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[0, 3]","Films like this tend to be a reflection upon the societies that create them.  Perhaps this was not intended here, but the result seems to indicate so.  Drawing on actual events the movie chronicles the British East India Company's aquistition of the Proinvce of Oudh in 1856, a year before the historic and barbarous Seapoy Mutiny of 1857.  This is not your standard Bollywiood flick with song, dance and outlandish plots.  Here there are subtle pararells drawn.  The two dedicated Chess Players reflect the monied class of India at that time.  Decadent, lazy and easily influenced their fixation on playing Chess is a reflection of higher faults within Indian Society at that time, and perhaps even today.  Both are products of a restrictive Caste System, they are have arranged marriages which are loveless and bordering on dissipation.  Chess seems to give their lives a higher meaning which seems lacking otherwise.The frivilous ruler of Oudh who is shown as a victim of British Colonialism was representative of his kind.  Indolent, inefficent, and whimisical he is a fair portrait of most of the independent petty rulers and princes of India at that time. Through a policy of divide and conquer the East India Company had gradually expanded its influence over the last century against such rulers as these.  Indeed, it is not surprising that the British were able to rule India in this fashion as the remnants of the decayed Mogul Empire were easily manipulated.  Had the British not done this a far more ruthless regime might well have been established by either France or Russia since India was not capable as a forged nation at this time to resist such.  A patchwork of petty rulers like this India had no greater sense of nationhood.  Even the Great Seapoy Mutiny a year later in 1857 was no expression of such, as some revisitionist historians would like to portray.Although the British are shown rightly as opportunists, the film does gave some consdieration and character development to them.  Having Sir Richard Attenborough play General Outram is a deffinite plus and raises the film above the norm.  Saeed Jaffrey is always nice to see even though he tends to be a standard character in many films made during this period.  Recall MAN WHO WOULD BE KING where he plays a Gurkha!1856 would prove to be the last year of John Company in India as the awful events of the Mutiny a year later would see Queen Victoria and the Crown assume direct rule of the empire.  Hence the RAJ would be born.  While modern sympathy's with perceived oppressed native peoples tends to be in vogue now, it is important to look at the historical facts.  Princely States like Oudh were often ruled incompetently.  When the British took over efficient administration usually resulted.  This legacy has been passed down to the India of today.A great film with excellent characters and a fascinating historical background.  Well acted and directed with classic themes.
