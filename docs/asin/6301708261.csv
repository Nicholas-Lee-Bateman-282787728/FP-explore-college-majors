262735,A3QCYYGURVRKV7,6301708261,Amazon Customer,"[46, 47]","I am so happy that Disney has finally released Snowball Express on DVD!  This is a great family movie that I've adored my entire life.  The story is about a family man, John Baxter (played by Dean Jones), who inherits a hotel from an uncle.  He quits his job and moves his family to the snow covered hills of Colorado where The Grand Imperial Hotel is located.  However, the Grand Imperial isn't as ""grand"" as he had imagined, and Baxter decides that with a bank loan, he'll change the hotel into a ski lodge.  The ruthless bank manager wants the hotel for his own greedy purposes, and this leaves Baxter to struggle to make his ski lodge dreams a reality.  This movie is full of laughs thanks to the whit of Jones, Harry Morgan, Nancy Olsen, Johnny Whitaker, and an adorable St. Bernard dog that will have you re-winding the DVD to see those precious expressions over and over.Now, why just 4 stars out of a possible 5?  They DVD is greatly appreciated, but the quality is a bit lacking.  Once again, like Disney's DVD release of Blackbeard's Ghost, Snowball Express is full-screen format. Also, it appears the the picture quality isn't as crisp as most DVD releases.  It looks as if the DVD was directly copied from an original film reel.  As you watch the opening credits, you'll see the specks of dust and scratches that are common when watching movies in theaters, but not on DVD.  Also, there aren't any Bonus Features!! Boooooo!!!Other than those little flaws, the DVD would make a great addition to a Disney DVD collection.",4,Finally a Disney Favorite on DVD!!!,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1531,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'Disney', 'finally', 'released', 'Snowball', 'Express', 'DVD', 'great', 'family', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'adored', 'entire', 'life', 'story', 'family', 'man', 'John', 'Baxter', 'played', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'who', 'hotel', 'uncle', 'job', 'family', 'snow', 'covered', 'hills', 'Colorado', 'where', 'Grand', 'Imperial', 'Hotel', 'located', 'However', 'Grand', 'Imperial', ""n't"", 'grand', 'had', 'imagined', 'Baxter', 'bank', 'loan', ""'ll"", 'change', 'hotel', 'ski', 'lodge', 'ruthless', 'bank', 'manager', 'hotel', 'own', 'greedy', 'purposes', 'Baxter', 'struggle', 'make', 'ski', 'lodge', 'reality', 'movie', 'full', 'laughs', 'thanks', 'whit', 'Jones', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Nancy', 'Olsen', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'adorable', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'dog', 'will', 'have', 're-winding', 'DVD', 'see', 'precious', 'expressions', 'over.Now', 'why', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'possible', '5', 'DVD', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'quality', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Once', 'again', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'release', 'Blackbeard', 'Ghost', 'Snowball', 'Express', 'full-screen', 'format', 'Also', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'crisp', 'most', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'was', 'directly', 'copied', 'original', 'film', 'reel', 'watch', 'opening', 'credits', ""'ll"", 'see', 'specks', 'dust', 'scratches', 'are', 'common', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'theaters', 'not', 'DVD', 'Also', 'are', ""n't"", 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Boooooo', 'Other', 'little', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'collection']",Snowball Express VHS

262753,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301708261,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Three and a half stars for SNOWBALL EXPRESS.Here's the plot: When a distant great uncle passes away, harried working drone John Baxter (Dean Jones) inherits the Grand Imperial Hotel in snowy Silver Hill, Colorado. In a highlight moment, Baxter quits his job in grand style, and then off he goes to pack his reluctant family to ski country. They get a shock, however, when they instead arrive at a run-down, deserted shambles of an establishment (the locals dub it ""Crazy Jake's place"").Bats in the lobby. Raccoons in the oven. An uninvited guest lurking in the shadows. Nevertheless, the Baxters try to make a go at it, converting the hotel into a ski lodge; this, despite the fact that none of them actually knows how to ski. And a conniving banker, with an eye towards John Baxter's inheritance, aims to make things that much harder...It boils down to this: A perhaps foolhardy venture at a new life. A dilapidated home. Snowball fights. An avalance. A lowdown, dirty trickery. And, it all, more or less, culminates in a wacky snowmobile race and with John Baxter paying attention to his clever kid.Back in the '60s and '70s, Dean Jones was a staple in Disney cinema. And, like all of his other Disney outings, SNOWBALL EXPRESS, coming out in 1972, showcases Dean's patented everyman charm and accesibility. Like the awesome Fred MacMurray, Dean is down-to-earth and quite believable as an average bloke. Because of this, his reactions to his plights become that much funnier, because we're able to better connect with him and, by extension, the madcap situations in which he lands himself. Note, too, that Dean Jones handles himself just fine with the physical antics. Plus, his characters tend to be a wee bit uptight, further fueling the humor. I really think Dean flaunts one of the better ""royally put upon"" facial expressions out there.SNOWBALL EXPRESS follows that tried-and-true Disney brand of family sentimentality and awkward goofiness. A Disney flick means that the wife is supportive and loving (this time, she's brought solidly to life by the always lovely and wholesome Nancy Olson), and the kids are juuust a tad rebellious but innately good at heart. The bad guy is oily and shady, in an over-the-top kind of way (as ably done by Keenan Wynn). And, naturally, there's always a lovable pet, this time in the shape of the humongous and cowardly dog, Stoutheart.Yes, the humor is very silly and slapstick and might even make you roll your eyes. Still, there are some funny bits in here, such as Dean's classic backwards downhill ski and that red-headed kid's attempts to dislodge a massive tree root. Not to mention, the great character actor Harry Morgan drops several good one-liners.To be honest, this isn't the best of Disney. I don't find SNOWBALL EXPRESS quite as enjoyable as, say,The Love Bug (Special Edition),Blackbeard's Ghostor evenThe Shaggy D.A..

Harry Morgan is hilarious here as usual. it's also nice to see Nancy Olsen from 'The Absent-minded Professor' working with Disney again. i'm also a big Johhny Whittaker fan and enjoyed seeing him too, although this is hardly the acting role he had in Disney's excellent 'Napoleon and Samantha'.look. no one can really claim this is a great film or even a great Disney classic, but it was certainly funny and probably a lot better than non-Disney movies like 'Snow Day' and 'Snow Foolin' that came much later. i thought it was better than Disney's lightweight comedy 'Snow Dogs'. i can't say this film was really about anything at all, but it had a lot of cool sight gags that wouldn't have been out of place in your average Goofy or Donald Duck cartoon.hilarious action and a helping of sweet family sentiment make this a definite buy for die hard Disney buffs that enjoy the old school films of Dean Jones or Fred MacMurray.",5,Snow Much Fun.

Nearly cartoonish and typically contrived, the movie remains a delight more than 30 years after it was first released.Johnny Baxter (Dean Jones) is a faceless white collar worker in New York City.  A barely remembered uncle leaves him a hotel with a fancy-sounding name in Colorado and Johnny packs up the family to run the hotel.  Alas, the hotel's name is far fancier than the hotel itself, inhabited by raccoons and a codger (Harry Morgan of ""Dragnet"" and ""M*A*S*H"").  Johnny, his wife Sue (Nancy Olson), son Richard (Johnny Whitaker), and daughter Chris (Kathleen Cody) decide to make a go of the hotel, partially because Johnny has burned a bridge at his old job and partially because of his pride.Johnny tries to obtain a loan and quickly runs afoul of perennial Disney bad-guy Keenan Wynn, playing ruthless banker Martin Ridgeway.  Johnny is able to borrow money from Ridgeway and fix the hotel to begin taking in paying customers, but as tends to happen in Disney comedies, Johnny tends to be prone to accidents.  In this case the most serious accident comes in the form of a runaway steam engine.Johnny is placed in a position of having no paying customers and no money, and his next loan payment to Ridgeway is coming due.  Johnny enters a snowmobile race with the help of a local ""expert"" who isn't, and with co-rider Harry Morgan.  Some of the funniest and most unbelievable moments of the movie occur during the snowmobile race.The ending of the movie unfolds not quite as you might expect, so I'll leave the remainder of the movie for the viewer to discover.The special effects were good for the early 70s, but now appear substantially dated, with a few exceptions, such as the runaway steam engine.

After being informed of an inheritance from a recently deceased, distant relative, Johnny immediately quits his job in a grand fashion and packs up his life and reluctant family to head for Colorado to run the Grand Imperial Hotel. Little does he know that the Grand Imperial is a dilapidated heap. In an effort to revitalize the place, Johnny and family, along with new friends Jesse and Wally, work to fix it up and soon find themselves in debt to a scheming banker (Disney baddie Keenan Wynn) who desires to own the property himself. The idea of turning the area into a ski resort gives the Baxters the needed inspiration to get things rolling, but luck just doesn't seem to be on their side. Or is it?From Disney's line of 1970's family comedies comes the delightful ""Snowball Express"", a sweet, simple little film with a fantastic cast of Disney favorites like frequent leading-man Dean Jones, legendary villain Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson as wife Sue Baxter, Johnny Whitaker as son Richard and Kathleen Cody as teen daughter Chris, Harry Morgan as squatter Jesse McCord, Michael McGreevey as goofy teen Wally Perkins, and other familiar faces in smaller roles, like Dick Van Patten as Baxter's crabby boss in the city. Is ""Snowball Express"" a five star movie in every sense? Okay, not really, but Amazon defines fives stars as meaning, ""I love it!"" and I do. Without living cars, pirate ghosts, golden-egg laying ducks, or the ability to transform into a dog in this one, Dean Jones must carry this film on his talents alone, and he does it wonderfully! This lighthearted comedy is an excellent lesson on working together, family support, and never giving up, though the importance of persistence is let up a bit in the end with the expected but all too instant and effortless ""happy ending"" resolution. Nevertheless, it's all good, clean, family fun, 70's Disney style! A great comedy to watch with or without the kids when there's snow on the ground or at least the desire for it.The DVD looks pretty good, a must own for the Disney collector, though it is presented in fullscreen with zero extras. On the bright side of the fullscreen issue, I have been informed from a usually trustworthy source that it appears to only add to the top and bottom rather than actually cropping anything off the sides.

I haven't bought the DVD yet, but noticed that it runs 93 minutes too.I remember when I saw it, that towards the end when Keenan Wynn, asks for a drink of water and an aspirin, he goes into the kitchen. As I remember it, shortly after that noises are heard and then Harry Morgan comes out of the kitchen and informs Nancy Olson that Keenan Wynn has just swallowed a fish. (Don't guess they ever fixed that)Checking with IMDB it gives a runtime of 99 minutes. I don't think the part I'm missing is 6 minutes long, so I was wondering what else they had cut out.I know that sometimes the military bases get movies with extra minutes in them, but to me that was the funniest part of the movie.This was also done with some releases of Excape to Witch Mountain.
