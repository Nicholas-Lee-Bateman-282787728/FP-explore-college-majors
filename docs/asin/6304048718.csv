The dubious holder of this title was a rabble rousing political genius from Louisiana. At one time, he held so much power that not even the public school janitors in Louisiana could be appointed without his approval. He is the closest thing to Adolf Hitler that this country has ever produced, and his power was peaking at the same time that Hitler was rising to power in Germany. In watching the tape, you see some of the wild gestures and pounding rhetoric that were so characteristic of Hitler.  Like all dictators, Long tolerated no opposition and until his assassination, had a real chance of being elected president in 1936 on a third party ticket.In general, when I watch a tape, it is done in brief segments. That was not the case with this one. I was so fascinated with the story that I watched it straight through. There are those that say that our political apparatus is such that it is impossible for anyone to ever assume dictatorial powers. I believe that, but not as strongly as I did before watching this tape. There is no question that he would have run for President in 1936 and given the economic problems, could have beaten Franklin Roosevelt. Given that scenario, he would have had a mandate to assume dictatorial powers, which is what he would have needed to govern the country.  Given that his policies had Louisiana on the verge of internal war, that could have been the case across the country.When people discuss dark episodes in the political history of the United States, they invariably talk about the communist hunting incompetent, Joe McCarthy. However, that is unfortunate, because McCarthy was third-rate compared to Long. He was in fact the greatest internal threat to democracy that this nation has ever faced. You cannot consider yourself  educated in the political history of the United States without learning about Huey Long and this tape will fill that gap.",5,Enthralling description of an aspiring dictator,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,2042,"['ironic', 'person', 'who', 'singularly', 'held', 'most', 'political', 'power', 'country', 'was', 'not', 'giant', 'Washington', 'Jefferson', 'Lincoln', 'dubious', 'holder', 'title', 'was', 'rabble', 'rousing', 'political', 'genius', 'Louisiana', 'one', 'time', 'held', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'not', 'even', 'public', 'school', 'janitors', 'Louisiana', 'could', 'be', 'appointed', 'approval', 'closest', 'thing', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'country', 'ever', 'produced', 'power', 'was', 'peaking', 'same', 'time', 'Hitler', 'was', 'rising', 'power', 'Germany', 'watching', 'tape', 'see', 'wild', 'gestures', 'pounding', 'rhetoric', 'were', 'so', 'characteristic', 'Hitler', 'dictators', 'Long', 'tolerated', 'opposition', 'assassination', 'had', 'real', 'chance', 'being', 'elected', 'president', '1936', 'third', 'party', 'ticket.In', 'general', 'when', 'watch', 'tape', 'done', 'brief', 'segments', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'story', 'watched', 'straight', 'through', 'are', 'say', 'political', 'apparatus', 'such', 'impossible', 'anyone', 'ever', 'assume', 'dictatorial', 'powers', 'believe', 'not', 'as', 'strongly', 'did', 'before', 'watching', 'tape', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'President', '1936', 'given', 'economic', 'problems', 'could', 'have', 'beaten', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'Given', 'scenario', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'mandate', 'assume', 'dictatorial', 'powers', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'govern', 'country', 'Given', 'policies', 'had', 'Louisiana', 'verge', 'internal', 'war', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'country.When', 'people', 'discuss', 'dark', 'episodes', 'political', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'invariably', 'talk', 'communist', 'hunting', 'incompetent', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'However', 'unfortunate', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'third-rate', 'compared', 'Long', 'was', 'fact', 'greatest', 'internal', 'threat', 'democracy', 'nation', 'ever', 'faced', 'can', 'not', 'consider', 'educated', 'political', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'learning', 'Huey', 'Long', 'tape', 'will', 'fill', 'gap']",Huey Long VHS

I have my doubts that Huey Long could have wrestled the 1936 presidential nomination away from FDR (a far more adroit politician who knew as well as anyone how to marginalize his foes), but what would have the 1940 elections brought?  Huey Long might never have had the national following to get the nomination, but he would have been a force to be reckoned with within the Democratic party.How he reached this level of power is fascinating.  Relatively unschooled but with political instincts second to none in Louisiana, Long could have written the book on the consolidation of power.  The Long Machine is not unique --- there have been other statewide machines such as the Cameron Machine in Pennsylvania, for example --- but the swiftness with which Long's organization rose to power is unparalleled.  Even more amazing was the fact that he had sizeable opposition within Louisiana who knew exactly what he was trying to do, and yet Long was still able to outmaneuver his foes!Clearly it is pretty easy to paint Long as an utterly corrupt dictator, and not a few of the talking heads in this documentary do exactly that.  I could have done without Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (evidently taking time off from being the official Camelot court historian and Kennedy apologist) self-righteously pronouncing judgement on Huey Long, even though Long deserved it --- but that is neither here nor there.  The fact that Long was a thoroughly unsavory autocrat does not explain the popular appeal he had which lasts to this very day.  Burns, to his eternal credit, devotes a not inconsequential amount film to interviews with ordinary people who recall all the wonderful things Huey Long did for the have-nots in the state.  Look into their eyes --- you can see genuine affection for the man, decades after his death.All of this leaves the viewer with no easy answers, which is fine with me.  History is rarely a black-and-white proposition, and we should not pretend that it is so.  Did the good deeds of the man excuse his corruption and hunger for power?  What is the benefit of democracy if the have-nots always lose and suffer?  Some countries have had the chance to choose tyranny because it least it meant that every citizen would have his or her basic needs met, and to them it was worth sacrificing civil liberties.  It hasn't happened often in the US, but it did happen once upon a time in Louisiana.  Ken Burns does a splendid job of telling the story.",5,An excellent documentary on one man's complex legacy,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,2613,"['One', 'really', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'splendid', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'figures', '20th', 'century', 'US', 'politics', 'have', 'doubts', 'Huey', 'Long', 'could', 'have', 'wrestled', '1936', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'away', 'FDR', 'far', 'more', 'adroit', 'politician', 'who', 'knew', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'how', 'marginalize', 'foes', 'what', 'would', 'have', '1940', 'elections', 'brought', 'Huey', 'Long', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'had', 'national', 'following', 'get', 'nomination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Democratic', 'party.How', 'reached', 'level', 'power', 'fascinating', 'Relatively', 'unschooled', 'political', 'instincts', 'second', 'none', 'Louisiana', 'Long', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'book', 'consolidation', 'power', 'Long', 'Machine', 'not', 'unique', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'statewide', 'machines', 'such', 'Cameron', 'Machine', 'Pennsylvania', 'example', 'swiftness', 'Long', 'organization', 'rose', 'power', 'unparalleled', 'Even', 'more', 'amazing', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'sizeable', 'opposition', 'Louisiana', 'who', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'yet', 'Long', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'outmaneuver', 'foes', 'Clearly', 'pretty', 'easy', 'paint', 'Long', 'utterly', 'corrupt', 'dictator', 'not', 'few', 'talking', 'heads', 'documentary', 'do', 'exactly', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Arthur', 'Schlesinger', 'Jr.', 'evidently', 'taking', 'time', 'being', 'official', 'Camelot', 'court', 'historian', 'Kennedy', 'apologist', 'self-righteously', 'pronouncing', 'judgement', 'Huey', 'Long', 'even', 'Long', 'deserved', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'fact', 'Long', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'unsavory', 'autocrat', 'not', 'explain', 'popular', 'appeal', 'had', 'very', 'day', 'Burns', 'eternal', 'credit', 'not', 'inconsequential', 'amount', 'film', 'interviews', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'recall', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Huey', 'Long', 'did', 'have-nots', 'state', 'Look', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'genuine', 'affection', 'man', 'decades', 'death.All', 'viewer', 'easy', 'answers', 'fine', 'History', 'rarely', 'black-and-white', 'proposition', 'should', 'not', 'pretend', 'so', 'Did', 'good', 'deeds', 'man', 'excuse', 'corruption', 'hunger', 'power', 'What', 'benefit', 'democracy', 'have-nots', 'always', 'lose', 'suffer', 'countries', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'choose', 'tyranny', 'least', 'meant', 'citizen', 'would', 'have', 'basic', 'needs', 'met', 'was', 'worth', 'sacrificing', 'civil', 'liberties', ""n't"", 'happened', 'often', 'US', 'did', 'happen', 'once', 'time', 'Louisiana', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'splendid', 'job', 'telling', 'story']",Huey Long VHS
398269,A27T7FAONDX6VI,6304048718,"Chris ""Chris906""","[2, 2]","This documentary ,which is one of Ken Burns earliest, is just a excellent look at Huey Long. Long was one of the most controversial figures in 20th century American politics and this documentary does him great justice. I only wish that the documentary could have been longer because their are so many great anecdotes about Long that are left out. I would highly recommend reading T. Harry Williams Pulitzer prize winning book 'Huey Long' along with this DVD. It's too bad the documentary couldn't have been at least double the present length.Almost all of the people interviewed in this documentary are now gone so it was great that Burns was able to interview them in the '80s and hear people's impressions of Long and his many contradictions. They talk about Long like it was only yesterday not like fifty years had passed. The archival footage is just awesome. The footage is very clear and to see Long in the flesh actually talking really makes him come alive even more. This footage is worth the price of the DVD alone. You will hear Long's song 'Every Man a King' and this is very fascinating to see and hear. Also, the documentary begins with Long and his comparison between Democrats and Republicans and this is still hilarious and still so very true.This documentary is very fair and shows both Long's dark side and all of the achievements he did for Louisiana. Long ,love him or hate him, is one of the most fascinating political characters that this nation has ever produced. The story as told by Burns is gripping and excellent. You will revisit a time when politicians ,by either legal or illegal means, actually got things done. You will shake your head at the shenanigans of Long and his cronies and you will wonder at what a strange, wonderful history our country has.Highly recommended!A+++'The Kingfish gonna save this land'**From Randy Newman and his excellent song on Huey Long- 'Kingfish'",5,'Who built the highway to Baton Rouge?

398270,A2TL9FBMOC7AVK,6304048718,Curtis Crawford,"[1, 1]","America's memory of Huey Long owes a lot to two films: this 1985 documentary by Ken Burns, and Robert Rossen's 1949 movie, ""All The King's Men.""  Both the documentary and the movie portray a hero of the common people, who rises to be dictator of his state, then falls to an assassin's bullet.  Yet there are large differences.The movie was inspired by Robert Penn Warren's novel of the same title, which in turn was inspired by Long's career (a fact that Warren famously and unconvincingly denied).  The movie's hero (named Willie Stark) is very bright, but a hick - a redneck - by birth and childhood circumstances.  His political career only catches fire when he learns to hammer his audiences with the tough sternness of a hick pounding fellow-hicks.In contrast, Huey Long, in the documentary, is born to a hardworking, middle-class family, which sent most of its offspring to college, at a time when only one in twenty American children had that privilege.  Huey was an accomplished debater in high school, and a persuasive salesman in his first full-time job.  After just a year in Law School, he passed the bar, and soon was elected, at age 24, to the Louisiana Railroad Commission.The movie confines Stark's political career to governor and boss of his state, and his policies primarily to state-sponsored public works, e.g., highways, public education, hospital care.  The documentary adds Long's years as United States Senator, crusader for the redistribution of Americans' wealth, and probable candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1936.The documentary includes colorful excerpts from Long's speeches, crusading against economic inequality:  ""4% of the American people own 85% of the wealth of America,"" while ""70% of the people of America don't own enough to pay the debts they owe.""  ""The Lord has answered the prayer, he has called the barbecue.  Come to my feast, he says to 125 million American people. He has invited Americans to his feast, but Morgan, Rockefeller, and Mellon and Baruch have walked up and took 85% of the victuals off the table.  Now, how ya gonna feed the balance of the people?  What are Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon and Baruch gonna do with all that grub?  They cain't eat it, they cain't wear the clothes, they cain't live in the houses.  Give `em a yacht! Give `em a palace!  Send `em to Reno & give `em a new wife if they want, if that's what they want.  But when they've got everything on God's living earth that they can eat, and they can wear and they can live in, and all their children can wear, and live in, and eat, and all their children's children can use, we gotta call Mr. Morgan and Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Mellon back, and say: Come back heah, put back on this table heah what you took away from heah, the stuff you don't need; leave something for the American people to consume.""The documentary notes the tremendous public response to Long's crusade, but fails to take seriously his plan for redistributing American wealth.  The plan is not described; its merits, pro and con, are not weighed.  This failure is my reason for giving Burns' work four, rather than five stars.  I won't try here to discuss the merits of the plan, but its main provisions -- very large taxes and subsidies -- are stated below.  I found them in a slim book of Long's speeches, entitled ""Kingfish to America: Share Our Wealth,"" edited by Henry Christman,1985, and available on Amazon.By taxing savings and property, the wealth of the very rich would be reduced, so that ""no one would own more than 3 or 4 million dollars.""  Income would also be taxed, to ""limit the total anyone could earn or inherit in one year to $1 million.""  [These 1934 limits were actually less severe than they sound in 2009.  Due to inflation, one million 1934 dollars would equal over 15.4 million 2009 dollars, and four million 1934 dollars would equal over 61 million 2009 dollars.]The money thus gained was estimated to provide every needy family in America with ""a home and the comforts of home, including such common conveniences as a radio and an automobile, free of debt.""  The government would ""guarantee food and clothing and employment for everyone who should work, by shortening the hours of labor to thirty hours per week, and to eleven months per year.""  Education would be free for every child, not just through high school, but on through college and vocational education.  Everyone over 60 years old, whose income was less than $1,000 per year, or whose net worth was less than $10,000, would receive a pension sufficient to support them in comfortable circumstances.",4,"EXCITING, THOUGHTFUL, IMPARTIAL HISTORY",1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,4608,"['America', 'memory', 'Huey', 'Long', 'lot', 'two', 'films', '1985', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns',

The Ken Burns ""Huey Long"" (1985) tries to be anti-Long, but fails.Many anti-Long partisans, some very famous and influential, state the anti-Long case, but somehow, they are not believable.What comes through in this documentary, in spite of the obvious bias of the filmmakers who present it, is that Sen.

Long was a man of astonishing ability and accomplishment who had goals many politicians of the 1930's and later stated they shared, but came much closer to delivering on his public promises than most others stating they shared his same ""redistribute the wealth"" agenda ever did.Huey Long delivered.That is the unmistakable message of this documentary.The anti-Long sentiment and invective melts away in the face of that message, and the considerable evidence which supports it.He was a good man who died young, and people hoping for good people part of politics in the USA's future can and should remember who he was, and how close he came to getting national leadership power, and using it well.--------------Written by SAG Actor Tex (David) Allen.",5,"""Huey Long"" (1985) by Ken Burns tried to defame and demonize Huey Long, but failed..Long was a ""good guy,"" and this doc shows it",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,2227,"['Huey', 'Long', '1985', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'tried', 'defame', 'demonize', 'Huey', 'Long', 'failed', 'Long', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'doc', 'that.U.S', 'Senator', 'former', 'Lousinana', 'governor', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Long', 'was', 'opponent', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'might', 'have', 'won', '1936', 'USA', 'Presidentail', 'election', 'was', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'front', 'dozens', 'people', 'September', '1935', 'year', '1936', 'election.Revisionist', 'history', 'instructs', 'especially', 'attended', 'government', 'schools', 'always', 'provide', 'doctrinaire', 'political', 'viewpoints', 'when', 'USA', 'history', 'taught', 'revere', 'President', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'did', 'nobody', 'much', 'now', 'questions', 'USA', 'entering', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'killed', 'million', 'USA', 'citizens', 'less', '4', 'years', 'even', 'most', 'pre-WWII', 'America', 'opposed', 'entering', 'war', 'many', 'historians', 'opine', 'Roosevelt', 'engineered', 'manipulated', 'USA', 'entrance', 'war', 'many', 'state', 'entrance', 'WWII', 'was', 'desirable', 'justified', 'same', 'revisionist', 'history', 'demonized', 'Sen.', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Long', 'anti-Long', 'slogans', 'opponents', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'post', 'WWII', 'history', 'books', 'movies', 'become', 'respected', 'facts', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Huey', 'Long', '1985', 'be', 'anti-Long', 'fails.Many', 'anti-Long', 'partisans', 'very', 'famous', 'influential', 'state', 'anti-Long', 'case', 'somehow', 'are', 'not', 'believable.What', 'through', 'documentary', 'spite', 'obvious', 'bias', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'present', 'Sen.', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Long', 'was', 'man', 'astonishing', 'ability', 'accomplishment', 'who', 'had', 'goals', 'many', 'politicians', '1930', 'later', 'stated', 'shared', 'came', 'much', 'closer', 'delivering', 'public', 'promises', 'most', 'others', 'stating', 'shared', 'same', 'redistribute', 'wealth', 'agenda', 'ever', 'did.Huey', 'Long', 'delivered.That', 'unmistakable', 'message', 'documentary.The', 'anti-Long', 'sentiment', 'invective', 'melts', 'away', 'face', 'message', 'considerable', 'evidence', 'it.He', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'people', 'hoping', 'good', 'people', 'part', 'politics', 'USA', 'future', 'can', 'should', 'remember', 'who', 'was', 'how', 'close', 'came', 'getting', 'national', 'leadership', 'power', 'using', 'well.', 'Written', 'SAG', 'Actor', 'Tex', 'David', 'Allen']",Huey Long VHS

Despite my whimsical reasons for seeing this, I am glad I learned about a controversial figure in American history.  This will teach one a lot about charismatic figures.I think I, and many others, may have become overly accustomed to the flashy and light-hearted biographies produced by A&E.;  Like other works in Ken Burns' oeuvre, this work is serious in tone.  Despite being released approximately 20 years ago, this work did not seem dated.  Those who find Cajun accents and the voices of the elderly exotic will especially love hearing the interviewees here.  At one point, they show Long singing a jingle.  I laughed inside just the way I rolled on the floor when John Ashcroft introduced his song ""Let the Eagle Fly.""Huey Long promoted a redistribution of wealth.  They mention that he admired previous populist William Jennings Bryan.  However, I wonder from where else his class-based views arrived?  Was he influenced by Marxism or socialism at all?  Long helped the first woman be elected to the Senate.  He fought the synecdoche between man and human kind, by adding ""Every Girl a Queen"" to his motto ""Every Man a King,"" though ""girl"" seems un-feminist to those in the ""post-post-post"" era.  The narrator says Long did not ""race-bait"" in his speeches and the work includes one African-American interviewee.  Nevertheless, more could have been said.  Burns, in the past, has said racial relations are essential to American history and that he tries to focus upon it in every work, but this did not happen here.  President Woodrow Wilson created all kinds of measures to help working-class people, yet he was profoundly anti-black.  This work never says if Huey Long was different.  This lacuna is a problem.This work begins with showing many people who loved him and it ends with showing many people who hated him.  I wonder if this love-hate dynamic was there all along.  Modern viewers may relate as President Bush, Jr. is said to be loved or hated by most.  Long predicted his murder, just as Malcolm X would three decades later.  This work basically said Long had one assassin, but Wikipedia suggests that one of his bodyguards may have accidentally shot and killed Long.Part of me wonders if Long is history that could not repeat itself.  He's loud like Traficante, who was booted from office, and is now in prison.  He was a maverick like Howard Dean, who was quickly dismissed as ""un-presidential.""  He was a populist like Jesse Ventura, another chin dimple owner, who only had a few years in office.  It's harder now for politicians to rock the boat like he did, especially a Robin Hood-type like Long.  Though the past may be the past, I was pleased by learning of this deceased elected official.",3,Absolute Power,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2800,"['rented', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'politics', 'love', 'men', 'chin', 'dimples', 'whimsical', 'reasons', 'seeing', 'am', 'glad', 'learned', 'controversial', 'figure', 'American', 'history', 'will', 'teach', 'one', 'lot', 'charismatic', 'figures.I', 'think', 'many', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'overly', 'accustomed', 'flashy', 'light-hearted', 'biographies', 'produced', 'A', 'E', 'other', 'works', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'oeuvre', 'work', 'serious', 'tone', 'being', 'released', 'approximately', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'dated', 'who', 'find', 'Cajun', 'accents', 'voices', 'elderly', 'exotic', 'will', 'especially', 'love', 'hearing', 'interviewees', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'show', 'Long', 'singing', 'jingle', 'laughed', 'inside', 'just', 'way', 'rolled', 'floor', 'when', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'introduced', 'song', 'Let', 'Eagle', 'Fly', 'Huey', 'Long', 'promoted', 'redistribution', 'wealth', 'mention', 'admired', 'previous', 'populist', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'However', 'wonder', 'where', 'else', 'class-based', 'views', 'arrived', 'Was', 'influenced', 'Marxism', 'socialism', 'Long', 'helped', 'first', 'woman', 'be', 'elected', 'Senate', 'fought', 'synecdoche', 'man', 'human', 'kind', 'adding', 'Girl', 'Queen', 'motto', 'Man', 'King', 'girl', 'un-feminist', 'post-post-post', 'era', 'narrator', 'Long', 'did', 'not', 'race-bait', 'speeches', 'work', 'one', 'African-American', 'interviewee', 'Nevertheless', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'Burns', 'past', 'said', 'racial', 'relations', 'are', 'essential', 'American', 'history', 'focus', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'here', 'President', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'created', 'kinds', 'measures', 'help', 'working-class', 'people', 'yet', 'was', 'profoundly', 'anti-black', 'work', 'never', 'Huey', 'Long', 'was', 'different', 'lacuna', 'problem.This', 'work', 'showing', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'showing', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'wonder', 'love-hate', 'dynamic', 'was', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'Modern', 'viewers', 'may', 'relate', 'President', 'Bush', 'Jr.', 'said', 'be', 'loved', 'hated', 'most', 'Long', 'predicted', 'murder', 'just', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'would', 'three', 'decades', 'later', 'work', 'basically', 'said', 'Long', 'had', 'one', 'assassin', 'Wikipedia', 'one', 'bodyguards', 'may', 'have', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'killed', 'Long.Part', 'wonders', 'Long', 'history', 'could', 'not', 'repeat', 'loud', 'Traficante', 'who', 'was', 'booted', 'office', 'now', 'prison', 'was', 'maverick', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'who', 'was', 'quickly', 'dismissed', 'un-presidential', 'was', 'populist', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'chin', 'dimple', 'owner', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'years', 'office', 'harder', 'now', 'politicians', 'rock', 'boat', 'did', 'especially', 'Robin', 'Hood-type', 'Long', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'past', 'was', 'pleased', 'learning', 'deceased', 'elected', 'official']",Huey Long VHS

This film by Ken Burns  brings the power and presence of Long into to its proper context of a poor  and desperate state in the throes of a crippling despression.  Burns  illustrates this documentary with excellent interviews with Long's  contemporaries, constituents, friends and opponents.  There is also  revealing footage of Long himself that reflects his intended image of a  &quot;countrified buffoon,&quot; which caused his enemies to fatally  underestimate him.  This documentary brings Long back to life as a  veritable dictator who might have won the presidency if not for his  assasination.The film's main strength lies in its balanced approach to  this controverisal figure.  Although Burns interviewed many of Long's  enemies, he also sought the opinion of the average Lousiana citizen who  benefited from Long's provision of free text books and hospital care.  These people were Long's source of strength and power and regard him as a  great man.  Again, Burns balances the man who provided relief to a  struggling people, and the dictator who compromised democracy in order to  provide that relief.

First, was a bus named Desire (the streetcars no longer run).  Second, was a political commercial in which one candidate suggested people should not vote for his opponent for sheriff because the man was a convicted felon.  My immediate thought was how in the name of perdition does a convicted felon get to run for public office?  Then I remembered that I was in Louisiana and that the legacy of Huey Long is alive and well.&quot;Huey Long: A Film by Ken Burns&quot; provides just what you would expect from America's premier documentarian: extensive archival footage mixed with recollections from Louisianans who knew Long and commentary from celebrated talking heads such as historian Arthur M. Schlessigner, Jr., journalist I. F. Stone, and, of course, author Robert Penn Warren, whose novel &quot;All the King's Men&quot; was a fictional retelling of the rise and fall of Huey P. Long.  The balance between Long's supporters and opponents, between his own rhetoric and the verdict of history, and between his political accomplishments and his quest for an American dictatorship, is quite impressive.  As a viewer you understand why the man was so popular with his &quot;Every Man a King&quot; and &quot;Share-the-Wealth&quot; programs and also how dangerous he was as a political demagogue.Huey Long's quest for the White House remains one of the great &quot;what ifs&quot; of American politics in the 20th century.  My opinion has always been that Long could not have mounted a successful challenge to FDR in the 1936 election.  The techniques of bribery, intimidation, and coercion that Long used so effectively in his home state to be both Governor and U.S. Senator at the same time, would not have worked outside the borders of Louisiana (although I have little doubt he would have tried).  Long would also have to contend with Roosevelt's own formidable charisma as well as the machinery of the Democratic Party and the enmity of every other Democratic politician in the rest of the country.  However, this point is certainly debatable and one of the reasons Long remains such an intriguing figure, especially when you are considering the American variant of fascism from the first half of the 20th century.This 88-minute documentary is nominated by David McCullogh, and there is a point where &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; pops up and you have to remind yourself that this documentary on &quot;Huey Long&quot; came out before &quot;The Civil War&quot; made Ken Burns a household name.

Specifically, the documentary does very well in presenting both sides of Long from the people who loved him and the enemies who loathed him.  Burns shows that while Huey used powers that often bordered on the dictatorial, he did a lot for his state during the Depression and was loved by the poor who had been ignored for years.After watching it, I was most struck by the vicious hatred aristocrats and others had for the Kingfish.  These people expressed glee at Long's assasination and noted that many of them had plotted to kill him on numerous occassions.  The reason that this is so noteworthy is because Long is often savaged by historians (such as Arthur Schlesinger on the DVD who labeled Huey ""sinister""), but they often fail to mention that Huey needed to be politically heavy-handed to deal with the similarly powerhungry artistocrats and machine politicians that had total control of Louisiana before the Kingfish was elevated to the governorship.All in all an excellent look at Huey that I highly recommend to anyone with an interest in politics or history.",5,"Outstanding, revealing documentary of the Kingfish",1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,1116,"['was', 'excellent', 'portrait', 'Huey', 'Long', 'Specifically', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'presenting', 'sides', 'Long', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'enemies', 'who', 'loathed', 'Burns', 'Huey', 'used', 'powers', 'often', 'bordered', 'dictatorial', 'did', 'lot', 'state', 'Depression', 'was', 'loved', 'poor', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'ignored', 'years.After', 'watching', 'was', 'most', 'struck', 'vicious', 'hatred', 'aristocrats', 'others', 'had', 'Kingfish', 'people', 'expressed', 'glee', 'Long', 'assasination', 'noted', 'many', 'had', 'plotted', 'kill', 'numerous', 'occassions', 'reason', 'so', 'noteworthy', 'Long', 'often', 'savaged', 'historians', 'such', 'Arthur', 'Schlesinger', 'DVD', 'who', 'labeled', 'Huey', 'sinister', 'often', 'fail', 'mention', 'Huey', 'needed', 'be', 'politically', 'heavy-handed', 'deal', 'similarly', 'powerhungry', 'artistocrats', 'machine', 'politicians', 'had', 'total', 'control', 'Louisiana', 'Kingfish', 'was', 'elevated', 'governorship.All', 'excellent', 'look', 'Huey', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interest', 'politics', 'history']",Huey Long VHS

Raymond,"[1, 1]","A lot of people seem to think that America would never had been the same had Long became president, that America would have become purely a socialist country. I don't think so. People seem to become short-sighted when it comes to whether or not Congress would have allowed his ideas come to pass. Considering all of the deals that Roosevelt didn't have go through during his second term such as the NRA, among others, and his attempts of adjusting it and Congress still not letting become law, what would make them subject to someone (Long) who felt that Roosevelt wasn't doing enough? His ""Share Our Wealth"" wouldn't have happened on a nationwide scale. But enough of my viewpoints on this issue.Burns does a great job with adding people who supported him (the poor) and the ones who didn't (middle-high class), and that they were still alive a half-century after his death is remarkable, and surely couldn't happen now except from a third-person perspective. It showed all of the good he did with building better highways, bridges getting textbooks for the children at the schools, and improving the overall structure of state of Louisiana. The also showed what he had to do to keep power, which wasn't justifiable in certain cases, if any (for example, the kidnapping prior to the elections) and the puppets he had in office during his term as Senator. It gives you a balanced look at what he did during his time involved with politics. I also enjoyed the looks of his earlier life, and his campaigning with ""Every man a King, but no one wears a crown"", and you can see how people were drawn to him with more than his promises? It also makes you think was he justified in his actions in order to keep power.I've seen several of Burns' documentaries,  ""Thomas Jefferson"", ""Prohibition"", and the Lewis and Clark documentary, along with this one.
