1123908,A1X7K2E0H9T319,B00104AYGU,A Customer,"[4, 5]","The 2007 biopic of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis is a bleak and harrowing portrayal of what has become a small yet nonetheless iconic chapter in rock history, the brief life of a desperation unchecked. A film adaptation of Touching From a Distance, the book written by widow Deborah Curtis (mother of Ian's daughter Natalie) and directed by longtime Joy Division supporter Anton Corbijn in his feature-length film directorial debut, Control features Sam Riley as Ian Curtis in what is not only a breakthrough performance but a career defining performance as well. He will likely be living with the role, and living it down, for the rest of his days.Never able to break his leash to his lower middle class roots, poetry guides the young Curtis into the realm of creative expression. Joy Division slowly finds its persona as Curtis and Deborah marry too young, with the two worlds then shouldered stormily and separately, of a wanted quiet blue collar existence with the needed growing demands of fronting an original and compelling band. The balance proves too much for Curtis, as he also contends with declining physical health and a love triangle which proves emotionally devastating to all participants. An interesting observation is made in the film, of the clear cut aesthetic difference between creating something very particular with being pulled into a claustrophobic system where such an act of creation is expected to assembly line its way into unrealistic continuation. Identity is always spread thin, and in the case of Ian Curtis especially the costs are also made clear.Co-starring Samantha Morton (who is just irresistibly heartbreaking in every role she takes on) as Deborah Curtis, Control is beautifully shot in black and white, allowing the millions of shades of gray to simultaneously construct and deconstruct this story that serves as both cautionary tale regarding the consequences of a Capitalism controlled Art, as well as the more intimate story of a young man who, despite intelligence and good intentions, failed miserably at affecting control over his own life.The noted music critic Simon Reynolds once said that Curtis' suicide ""made for instant myth"". He also has said that Joy Division's success ""drew a devoted following nicknamed the ""Cult With No Name"", who were stereotyped as ""intense young men dressed in gray overcoats"". A curiously troubling thing about public perception is that persons elevated to painfully social status can be dehumanized into archetypal roles. No matter the nature or source of celebrity, many look up to the celebrated as a leader or teacher or trendsetter. The theologian Alan Watts however, has before expressed the dire need our culture has of trying to suckle the finger that is actually pointing the way to salvation. As such, Corbijn brilliantly succeeds in showing that regardless of his personal faults and triumphs, Curtis himself is in fact a flawed hero and by no means deserving of cult-hero labeling. But the words Curtis wrote and sang, are much more powerfully indicative in rightfully expressing fears which anyone victim of this overly progressive modern age can identify with and learn from. Instead of hearing the messenger out, we hung him, and so his private failures are very much representative of the shortcomings inherent to our own publicly as a society.Great movie and one I obviously recommend.",5,Black and white and never enough grays.,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3388,"['2007', 'biopic', 'Joy', 'Division', 'frontman', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'bleak', 'harrowing', 'portrayal', 'what', 'become', 'small', 'yet', 'nonetheless', 'iconic', 'chapter', 'rock', 'history', 'brief', 'life', 'desperation', 'unchecked', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Touching', 'Distance', 'book', 'written', 'widow', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'mother', 'Ian', 'daughter', 'Natalie', 'directed', 'longtime', 'Joy', 'Division', 'supporter', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'feature-length', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Control', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'career', 'defining', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'living', 'role', 'living', 'down', 'rest', 'days.Never', 'able', 'break', 'leash', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'roots', 'poetry', 'young', 'Curtis', 'realm', 'creative', 'expression', 'Joy', 'Division', 'slowly', 'persona', 'Curtis', 'Deborah', 'marry', 'too', 'young', 'two', 'worlds', 'then', 'shouldered', 'stormily', 'separately', 'wanted', 'quiet', 'blue', 'collar', 'existence', 'needed', 'growing', 'demands', 'fronting', 'original', 'compelling', 'band', 'balance', 'too', 'much', 'Curtis', 'also', 'declining', 'physical', 'health', 'love', 'triangle', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'participants', 'interesting', 'observation', 'made', 'film', 'clear', 'cut', 'aesthetic', 'difference', 'creating', 'something', 'very', 'particular', 'being', 'pulled', 'claustrophobic', 'system', 'where', 'act', 'creation', 'expected', 'assembly', 'line', 'way', 'unrealistic', 'continuation', 'Identity', 'always', 'spread', 'thin', 'case', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'especially', 'costs', 'are', 'also', 'made', 'clear.Co-starring', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'who', 'just', 'irresistibly', 'heartbreaking', 'role', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'Control', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'allowing', 'millions', 'shades', 'gray', 'simultaneously', 'construct', 'deconstruct', 'story', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'regarding', 'consequences', 'Capitalism', 'controlled', 'Art', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'intimate', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'intelligence', 'good', 'intentions', 'failed', 'miserably', 'affecting', 'control', 'own', 'life.The', 'noted', 'music', 'critic', 'Simon', 'Reynolds', 'once', 'said', 'Curtis', 'suicide', 'made', 'instant', 'myth', 'also', 'said', 'Joy', 'Division', 'success', 'drew', 'devoted', 'following', 'nicknamed', 'Cult', 'Name', 'who', 'were', 'stereotyped', 'intense', 'young', 'men', 'dressed', 'gray', 'overcoats', 'curiously', 'troubling', 'thing', 'public', 'perception', 'persons', 'elevated', 'painfully', 'social', 'status', 'can', 'be', 'dehumanized', 'archetypal', 'roles', 'matter', 'nature', 'source', 'celebrity', 'many', 'look', 'up', 'celebrated', 'leader', 'teacher', 'trendsetter', 'theologian', 'Alan', 'Watts', 'however', 'before', 'expressed', 'dire', 'need', 'culture', 'trying', 'suckle', 'finger', 'actually', 'pointing', 'way', 'salvation', 'such', 'Corbijn', 'brilliantly', 'showing', 'regardless', 'personal', 'faults', 'triumphs', 'Curtis', 'fact', 'flawed', 'hero', 'means', 'deserving', 'cult-hero', 'labeling', 'words', 'Curtis', 'wrote', 'sang', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'powerfully', 'indicative', 'rightfully', 'expressing', 'fears', 'anyone', 'victim', 'overly', 'progressive', 'modern', 'age', 'can', 'identify', 'learn', 'Instead', 'hearing', 'messenger', 'out', 'hung', 'so', 'private', 'failures', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'representative', 'shortcomings', 'inherent', 'own', 'publicly', 'society.Great', 'movie', 'one', 'obviously', 'recommend']",Control

1123910,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00104AYGU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","If you are expecting another run-of-the-mill biopic about a drug-addled rock star and are thinking that you don't really need to see another one of those, I urge you to throw your inhibitions to the wind and snatch up this superb film, for it is far from run-of-the-mill.  In fact, `Control' may be the best biopic of this nature I've seen in quite some time.The film tells the story of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis.  At a very young age (and I mean VERY young) Ian found himself married, fronting a rock back, thrust into fatherhood and rising to superstardom.  While all of those things are what dreams are made of, when you add to the mix harrowing epileptic seizures and medications with undesirable side effects you find your protagonist beyond depressed and unable to cope with the strains of each individual responsibility.  A mistress on the road certainly doesn't help any (especially when your wife finds out).  Yes, `Control' is about a tortured musician, but not in the vein of most films in this genre.  This man's torment was even more poignant because of his inability to rise above it.It's hard to believe that a lot of what makes this film so great comes from newcomers to the game.  Everything about this film feels so mature, so authentic.  It baffles me that this is Anton Corbijn's debut film.  Nothing about this film says `amateur' at all.The decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius, adding crisp layers of style and flair.  The way he frames each actor, each scene, each musical experience feels straight out of a magazine, yet it never feels like he's intentionally `glamming' up anything.  This film retains its raw appeal without losing an ounce of finesse.The screenplay, written by Matt Greenhalgh, is a stunning piece of work.  What I found so moving about it was that it highlighted Curtis's youth with subtle flourishes, exposing the faults within his own impatience that helped propel him to his doom.  Notice the way he does everything pertinent to his life is with a nonchalance and rashness that almost spells failure before it progresses.  The way he proposes, the way he suggests a child; it's done without any real thought given, showing his immaturity.  And yet, when his world begins to spiral out of control we are given a more intimate look at very mature emotions.  The way that Corbijn allows his actors (namely Sam Riley) to express what is racing through their minds, with prolonged shots of distilled faces and silent afflictions, is just magnificently real and unquestionably stirring to the soul.I also really loved the use of music here.  A lot of times with a musician's biopic, the music can fall to one of two extremes; either it feels like an afterthought, used because it has to be, or it feels too influential, giving the events in the musician's life a veneer of manufactured realities.  Here, the music feels like a real part of the film.  It doesn't drive the film, which is key, but it illuminates the emotions and is used as a catalyst for great character development.And that brings me to the performances found within this brilliant biopic.Alexandra Maria Lara is beautiful (and I mean B-E-A-UTIFUL) and she can act too, delivering a simple and subtle look at a woman falling in love with a man she can't have completely.  Toby Kebbell is also strikingly good as Joy Division's manager.  His smooth swagger is key to developing a character with polished arrogance.  Samantha Morton (one of the best actresses working today, no exceptions) is flawless here.  I love what she was able to do with a very clich&eacute;d character (suffering spouse).  It's not like there is a lot of originality within the character (it is what it is) but she brings so much heartfelt emotion to her every scene.  Hearing her utter those heartbreaking words, ""I don't deserve this"", literally made me shiver.  What Sam Riley does with the scene afterwards is astonishing.  Yes, the way he completely melts down before the camera without once betraying honest emotion for forced theatrics is stunning.  Sam Riley is a god here.  Nothing against the likes of Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix who came before him, but they can't even compare to the raw earnest realism that Riley pulled out of this character.  Forget that apparent mimicry found in the Oscar loved performances, Riley captures a soul as apposed to a mannerism.  He lives and breathes this performance, and it shows in his unwavering from character.In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is far more than one would expect it to be, for it focuses on a man who is not far removed from the youth of today.  He wanted it all, and he thought he could handle it, but at the ripe old age of 23 it proved too heavy for his fragile shoulders.",5,"So this is permanence; love-shattered pride.

1123911,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00104AYGU,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[9, 13]","""Control"" shows many details that will jump out at anyone familiar withJoy Division'shistory. The young Ian Curtis wears a jacket with the word ""HATE"" drawn on the back. Bernard Sumner yells, ""You all forgot Rudolf Hess."" Ian watches ""Stroszek"" and listens toIggy Pop, as he must. Yet ""Control"" is not really about Joy Division. There is not much music; the film makes no mention, none whatsoever, of the band'ssecondand final album. The actors went to the trouble of learning to play some of the songs, but they can't help sounding amateurish -- if you haven't heard the songs before, you are unlikely to understand why there was anything special about them.Moreover, the other band members come across as louts. This provides the film's few memorable lines of dialogue, but seems unfair. Watching ""Control,"" one might believe that Ian had no interaction with his own band. He is shown attacking Bernard in the scene that leads to his first epileptic fit, but he is never shown talking to the guys about anything. They all act quite cold to each other. They have little love of music; they thinkThe Buzzcocksare ""okay,"" but show no enthusiasm. Ian is shown offering his services as singer to the other guys as if he were a total stranger. One wonders why they accepted.Look, just because the film has Joy Division in it doesn't mean that everyone involved has to be an icy death machine. Even Tony Wilson, that charismatic bon vivant and con man, is a gloomy Gus in this film. Watch24 Hour Party People-- it is not pleasant viewing for a Joy Division fan, but it shows the sleazy, yet exciting and adventurous atmosphere surrounding the burgeoning Manchester scene. People knew there was something good in the air, and they were excited about it. That's why they spent their free time doing it. ""Control"" shows none of that. ProducerMartin Hannettis never mentioned by name. Instead, the spotlight shines on manager Rob Gretton, who steals the show simply by swearing a lot.Okay, fine, the film doesn't have to be about Joy Division. But it's not really about one man's anguish, either. The first half of the film gives the impression that the director's knowledge of dialogue and human interaction derives entirely from French New Wavefilms. Scene after scene consists primarily of ""smoking cigarettes with existential meaning,"" to the point where it is unintentionally comical.For example, the film opens with Ian reciting a verse from ""Heart And Soul,"" and shows him purchasing an LP. But that's all it does to show his attraction to poetry and music. Why was he interested in these things? Okay, he didn't like to show his feelings, but every earnest young man, especially one with an introverted character, has numerous pedantic opinions on rock music, and greatly enjoys holding forth on them. The film shows Ian and Deborah attending the Sex Pistols concert, but they show no interest in the music. Ian gives no sign of excitement, except perhaps some slightly more animated head-nodding. In another scene, he flatly recites from Wordsworth, one of the least edgy poets in the English language. What's the big deal, why is he interested in Wordsworth? More importantly, why do his friends listen to him? Do they view him as an authority on intellectual matters?The courtship between Deborah and Ian is so bizarre that it's funny. Deborah is shown to have a boyfriend; she pouts in front of Ian, who gives her no emotional cues. They both look very bored at the concert, when suddenly, they leap into each other's arms. Starting immediately, the boyfriend disappears and is never heard from again, and Ian proposes to Deborah in the very next scene. This also is peculiar. Ian, both in the film and in real life, seemed to have little taste for family life and fatherhood (""with children my time is so wastefully spent,"" he cruelly wrote). Yet here, he's the one who initiates every move. He proposes, and he also asks Deborah to have a baby. It is not unrealistic that a man might have an idealized view of marriage, and then become dissatisfied with the reality, but that's precisely the sort of thing you have to carefully explore if you're making a feature film.But here? You honestly have to wonder why the man is depressed. In the early scenes, he's a dashing mop-top with a manly chin, who wins Deborah's heart without the slightest effort. There is some indication later that he is distraught by the diagnosis of epilepsy, but this quickly takes a backseat to the love triangle with Annik Honore, which Ian himself initiates of his own free will. The only logical conclusion would seem to be that Ian always had a self-absorbed death wish, and willfully ignored his slavishly devoted wife (traces of Emily Watson in ""Breaking the Waves""). Oh, and he also sang a few songs in the process.Toward the end, Ian laments, ""I give them everything on stage and they want more."" He says that no one can understand how his performances affect him. The film gives no indication, prior to this line, that this is the case. Ian's performances just seem to be a mild distraction from his usual moping; a distraction that he engages in just so he can have something to do.There are two possibilities. Either a) Anton Corbijn is a hack, or b) everything good about Ian Curtis had already been expressed in his music, and thus there is no point in a film about his short life. Either way, there is little reason to watch ""Control.""",2,Taking all the colour out of life.,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,5429,"['Control', 'many', 'details', 'will', 'jump', 'out', 'anyone',

Joy Division was incredible! Innovative and, they just plain rocked. I do think that in the film they shouldve focused on the other members more because everyone in the group was super talented. The director did a superb job in depicting the isolation, disappointment, anger, and pain Ian lived through. Even though he did bring some of it on himself. The film shows a young kid who was, completely human, bored, and looking for his escape from Manchester. The black and white film color depicts Ian's seemingly gray mood cleverly, almost like your looking through his eyes. Sam Riley really looks like the real Ian Curtis , and he played the part perfectly, although his voice is'nt as awkward and strange as Ian's, but the cast did a great rendition. And it also stayed genuine, depicting the disregard and disrespect Ian had for his poor wife. Its crazy because he would write songs about her and he cheated on her, poor woman must've been humiliated. Very good movie.

Control, though a well made movie that avoids many pitfalls of a typical musical biopic, doesn't really get to the bottom of who Curtis really was, which might just be an impossible task.Sam Riley plays Curtis, the lead singer of the legendary band Joy Division.  I'm probably not spoiling anything by saying that he killed himself, making himself in to a legendary rock figure.  The main story centers on Curtis's struggles with his ill advised marriage at a young age, his severe epilepsy, and his affair with a Dutch woman named Annik.  Riley obviously studied Curtis's mannerisms, as his awkward but strangely charismatic stage presence and his voice really stand out.  He sings all of his own parts, and he does a respectable job.  Curtis was not a great singer, but he did have a very distinctive voice, something that Riley emulates well.Watching Control, you get the sense of just how gloomy Joy Division's music really was.  I've listened to Unknown Pleasures and Closer many times, but seeing the inspiration for Curtis's pitch black lyrics played out in a dreary Manchester makes them appear more palpable.  You could argue that there is some mythologizing going on, but it doesn't beat you over the head like Walk the Line does.  Instead, it lets the viewer put together the pieces for the most part.  A good example is when Curtis see's a girl have an epileptic seizure when he's working at the unemployment office.  For those who have followed Joy Division closely, you this is the inspiration for She's Lost Control.  You'd have to know the lyrics of She's Lost Control to know that it's about a girl with epilepsy.  There are some times though where the filmmakers hold your hand, like when they show his book collection, filled with depressing books by JG Ballard and William S. Burroughs, or when he talks about going to see Apocalypse Now.  Even then, it still relies mostly on subtext to get the message across about Curtis's influences.One major problem I have with most musical biopics is that they rarely show anything about the creative process.  There is a bit in Control, like the scene where they are recording the drum tracks for She's Lost Control.  Apparently they got the odd hissing sound using a spray can.  I was hoping for a more prominent role for Martin Hannett, the notoriously controlling producer of both Joy Division albums.  By all accounts Hannett had a large influence on Joy Division's sound, but he's only shown for about 5 minutes.  And how did they decide that the bass would take lead and the guitar would be used as a background device?  Was it because Peter Hook was the best musician in the band, or was it some other reason?  Of course, I'm a music nerd, so these things might not interest anyone outside of me and a few other dedicated weirdo's.Control is a cut above most biopics.  Riley does a wonderful job as Curtis, and it offers a fairly unsparing look at his life.  Curtis still remains a mystery though, and will probably stay that way forever.  That's part of the appeal of his music; you can listen to it over and over and still not know what was in the creators mind.",4,A Good Mope,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,3280,"['Ian', 'Curtis', 'was', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'typical', 'rock', 'star', 'Instead', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'get', 'epilepsy', 'broken', 'marriage', 'performance', 'anxiety', 'Control', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'typical', 'musical', 'biopic', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'bottom', 'who', 'Curtis', 'really', 'was', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'impossible', 'task.Sam', 'Riley', 'Curtis', 'lead', 'singer', 'legendary', 'band', 'Joy', 'Division', ""'m"", 'probably', 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'saying', 'killed', 'making', 'legendary', 'rock', 'figure', 'main', 'story', 'centers', 'Curtis', 'struggles', 'ill', 'advised', 'marriage', 'young', 'age', 'severe', 'epilepsy', 'affair', 'Dutch', 'woman', 'named', 'Annik', 'Riley', 'obviously', 'studied', 'Curtis', 'mannerisms', 'awkward', 'strangely', 'charismatic', 'stage', 'presence', 'voice', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'own', 'parts', 'respectable', 'job', 'Curtis', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'singer', 'did', 'have', 'very', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'something', 'Riley', 'well.Watching', 'Control', 'get', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'gloomy', 'Joy', 'Division', 'music', 'really', 'was', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'Unknown', 'Pleasures', 'Closer', 'many', 'times', 'seeing', 'inspiration', 'Curtis', 'pitch', 'black', 'lyrics', 'played', 'out', 'dreary', 'Manchester', 'appear', 'more', 'palpable', 'could', 'argue', 'mythologizing', 'going', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'put', 'together', 'pieces', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'example', 'when', 'Curtis', 'see', 'girl', 'have', 'epileptic', 'seizure', 'when', 'working', 'unemployment', 'office', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'Joy', 'Division', 'closely', 'inspiration', 'Lost', 'Control', ""'d"", 'have', 'know', 'lyrics', 'Lost', 'Control', 'know', 'girl', 'epilepsy', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'hold', 'hand', 'when', 'show', 'book', 'collection', 'filled', 'depressing', 'books', 'JG', 'Ballard', 'William', 'S.', 'Burroughs', 'when', 'going', 'see', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Even', 'then', 'still', 'mostly', 'subtext', 'get', 'message', 'Curtis', 'influences.One', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'most', 'musical', 'biopics', 'rarely', 'show', 'anything', 'creative', 'process', 'bit', 'Control', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'recording', 'drum', 'tracks', 'Lost', 'Control', 'Apparently', 'got', 'odd', 'hissing', 'sound', 'using', 'spray', 'can', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'Martin', 'Hannett', 'notoriously', 'controlling', 'producer', 'Joy', 'Division', 'albums', 'accounts', 'Hannett', 'had', 'large', 'influence', 'Joy', 'Division', 'sound', 'only', 'shown', 'about', '5', 'minutes', 'how', 'did', 'decide', 'bass', 'would', 'take', 'lead', 'guitar', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'background', 'device', 'Was', 'Peter', 'Hook', 'was', 'best', 'musician', 'band', 'was', 'other', 'reason', 'course', ""'m"", 'music', 'nerd', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'interest', 'anyone', 'few', 'other', 'dedicated', ""weirdo's.Control"", 'cut', 'most', 'biopics', 'Riley', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Curtis', 'fairly', 'unsparing', 'look', 'life', 'Curtis', 'still', 'mystery', 'will', 'probably', 'stay', 'way', 'forever', 'part', 'appeal', 'music', 'can', 'listen', 'still', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'creators', 'mind']",Control

It also covers the rise of the band itself: although this is not the central thread, this aspect is quite well covered. Given the subject material and well known denouement, it's not easy watching but I was deeply moved by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton's outstanding performances as Ian and Deborah. The monochrome filming adds to the sense of place and time and I can't imagine that it would have worked in colour.The music lifts the mood. Apparently the actors played all the music sets themselves and Riley seems to have Curtis' style, mannerisms and delivery down perfectly. Joe Anderson (Hook), James Anthony Pearson (Sumner) and Harry Treadaway (Morris) are seriously convincing. Indeed, this is where I believe that the film scores highly over the documentary ""Joy Division"" which included only a few abbreviated exerpts of the band's performances. It's ironic that fans should have to turn to a dramatisation for a good portfolio of JD music. Three full performances (by the actors) are also provided on the DVD as extras - Transmission, Leaders of Men and Candidate - and Corbijns (rather odd) video for the song Atmosphere is also included.All that said, I can't really see this as a film for general viewing - the subject is too esoteric and (let's face it) grim - but if you're a fan of the band or of the music of that era you can't afford not to own this.""Mother I tried please believe me, I'm doing the best that I can.

In Curtis' case, he committed suicide on the eve of his band's first American tour. His brief life has already been depicted on film in Michael Winterbottom's fast `n' loose look at the Manchester music scene of the 1970s and 1980s,24 Hour Party People, but it was only for the first half of that film. Control draws most of its content fromTouching from a Distance: Ian Curtis and Joy Division, the memoirs of Ian's wife, Deborah, and is directed by music video maker Anton Corbijn. He not only directed the video for their song, ""Atmosphere,"" but also shot some of the most memorable photographs of the band, making him the ideal choice to helm this film.There is an audio commentary by director Anton Corbijn. With his thick accent, he's a little hard to follow at times but manages to cover the usual topics: casting choices, shooting on location, and so on. He praises the performances of Sam Riley and Samantha Morton while also pointing out technical details, like how the concert scenes where shot with hand-held cameras and everything else was done with steadicams. This track is a little on the dull side but Corbijn does impart interesting factoids and it was clearly a labour of love for him.""The Making of Control"" takes a look at how the film came together. Corbijn moved to England because of Joy Division and took iconic photos of the band. So, he had an emotional connection to the material. His black and white photos influenced his decision to shoot the film in a similar style. The actors who played the members of Joy Division talk about the challenge of playing people who are still alive, learning to play musical instruments, and the songs. This is an excellent featurette filled with loads of interesting information.""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" tends to repeat some of the information from the commentary track and the making of featurette. The director talks about how he discovered Joy Division's music and how he eventually met them. He touches upon how they shot in Ian's hometown for authenticity.""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" allows you to see ""Transmission"", ""Leaders of Men"", and ""Candidate"" in their entirety.In a nice touch, there are the videos for ""Transmission,"" a powerful rendition done for live TV with a riveting performance by Ian, Corbijn's video for ""Atmosphere"" that is haunting as it was done after Ian's death, and The Killers' cover of ""Shadowplay"" which is surprisingly effective.Also included is a ""Still Gallery"" with photographs from the film.Finally, there are ""Promotional Materials,"" trailers for the film, a blurb for Deborah's book about Ian, the soundtrack, and so on.",5,DVD Extras Enhance This Powerful Film,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2872,"['Ever', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'lead', 'singer', 'British', 'band', 'Joy', 'Division', 'died', '1980', 'achieved', 'iconic', 'status', 'emerging', 'artist', 'showing', 'signs', 'brilliance', 'meeting', 'early', 'tragic', 'end', 'Curtis', 'case', 'committed', 'suicide', 'eve', 'band', 'first', 'American', 'tour', 'brief', 'life', 'already', 'been', 'depicted', 'film', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'fast', 'n', 'loose', 'look', 'Manchester', 'music', 'scene', '1970s', '1980s,24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Control', 'most', 'content', 'fromTouching', 'Distance', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Joy', 'Division', 'memoirs', 'Ian', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'directed', 'music', 'video', 'maker', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'video', 'song', 'Atmosphere', 'also', 'shot', 'most', 'memorable', 'photographs', 'band', 'making', 'ideal', 'choice', 'helm', 'film.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'thick', 'accent', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'manages', 'cover', 'usual', 'topics', 'casting', 'choices', 'shooting', 'location', 'so', 'performances', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'also', 'pointing', 'out', 'technical', 'details', 'how', 'concert', 'scenes', 'where', 'shot', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'done', 'steadicams', 'track', 'little', 'dull', 'side', 'Corbijn', 'impart', 'interesting', 'factoids', 'was', 'clearly', 'labour', 'love', 'Making', 'Control', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'Corbijn', 'moved', 'England', 'Joy', 'Division', 'took', 'iconic', 'photos', 'band', 'So', 'had', 'emotional', 'connection', 'material', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'influenced', 'decision', 'shoot', 'film', 'similar', 'style', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'members', 'Joy', 'Division', 'talk', 'challenge', 'playing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'learning', 'play', 'musical', 'instruments', 'songs', 'excellent', 'featurette', 'filled', 'loads', 'interesting', 'information', 'Control', 'Conversation', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'repeat', 'information', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'featurette', 'director', 'talks', 'how', 'discovered', 'Joy', 'Division', 'music', 'how', 'eventually', 'met', 'how', 'shot', 'Ian', 'hometown', 'authenticity', 'Extended', 'Live', 'Concert', 'Performances', 'Film', 'see', 'Transmission', 'Leaders', 'Men', 'Candidate', 'entirety.In', 'nice', 'touch', 'are', 'videos', 'Transmission', 'powerful', 'rendition', 'done', 'live', 'TV', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Ian', 'Corbijn', 'video', 'Atmosphere', 'haunting', 'was', 'done', 'Ian', 'death', 'Killers', 'cover', 'Shadowplay', 'surprisingly', 'effective.Also', 'included', 'Still', 'Gallery', 'photographs', 'film.Finally', 'are', 'Promotional', 'Materials', 'trailers', 'film', 'blurb', 'Deborah', 'book', 'Ian', 'soundtrack', 'so']",Control
1123920,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00104AYGU,Dai-keag-ity,"[1, 1]","As much as I enjoy this great movie, each time I watch it I can't help but think how startled Ian Curtis would probably have been to know that it would be his legacy to be remembered as the tragic figure Control (and to a much lesser extent 24 Hour Party People) made him out to be, instead of the social rebel he thought he was. The actual Curtis swore and drank, had temper fits, could be temperamental and difficult to friend and loved-one alike, and was known for his loud, scathing diatribes, including a famous one in which he blasted David Bowie for living to age thirty, despite the tone of Bowie's 1970s ode to dying young, ""All The Young Dudes"". In contrast the Ian Curtis of Control was a suffering martyr figure with a quiet, Keats-like delicacy that gave him a wispy quality that really doesn't gel with what we know of the flesh and blood man.Having said all that, Control is still one of the most watchable films that's ever been made about the rock and roll scene. It is a both a labor of love and an artistic remembrance of a place and time and those who lived there. The story it tells can be either criticized as a subjective exercise in idealism, or praised for its close connection to those participants in and around Joy Division (Tony Wilson, Deborah and Natalie Curtis, the guys from New Order) who remained alive at the time of filming. One member of the band went on record as saying that the events depicted in Control were not much like they were in reality, but added that in telling Curtis' story, Control improved things, making the story more dramatic and approachable.No commentary on this film would be complete without mentioning both the brilliance of its soundtrack and the meticulous reenactments of its concert scenes. Many of the locations from Curtis' life and death were actually used in the making of Control, adding an unmistakable punch to the plot. Finally, the fine acting on the part of virtually everyone who appeared onscreen was a delight to see, with Samantha Morton and Sam Riley turning out emotional performances that deserved Oscar recognition: something an outside film like Control would never get in Hollywood.Like Ian Curtis himself, Control isn't perfect but it's still darn interesting.",5,When The Legend Becomes Fact...,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,2248,"['As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'great', 'movie', 'time', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'startled', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'legacy', 'be', 'remembered', 'tragic', 'figure', 'Control', 'much', 'lesser', 'extent', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'instead', 'social', 'rebel', 'thought', 'was', 'actual', 'Curtis', 'swore', 'drank', 'had', 'temper', 'fits', 'could', 'be', 'temperamental', 'difficult', 'friend', 'loved-one', 'alike', 'was', 'known', 'loud', 'scathing', 'diatribes', 'including', 'famous', 'one', 'blasted', 'David', 'Bowie', 'living', 'age', 'thirty', 'tone', 'Bowie', '1970s', 'ode', 'dying', 'young', 'Young', 'Dudes', 'contrast', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Control', 'was', 'suffering', 'martyr', 'figure', 'quiet', 'Keats-like', 'delicacy', 'gave', 'wispy', 'quality', 'really', ""n't"", 'gel', 'what', 'know', 'flesh', 'blood', 'man.Having', 'said', 'Control', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'watchable', 'films', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'rock', 'roll', 'scene', 'labor', 'love', 'artistic', 'remembrance', 'place', 'time', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'either', 'criticized', 'subjective', 'exercise', 'idealism', 'praised', 'close', 'connection', 'participants', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Tony', 'Wilson', 'Deborah', 'Natalie', 'Curtis', 'guys', 'New', 'Order', 'who', 'remained', 'alive', 'time', 'filming', 'One', 'member', 'band', 'went', 'record', 'saying', 'events', 'depicted', 'Control', 'were', 'not', 'much', 'were', 'reality', 'added', 'telling', 'Curtis', 'story', 'Control', 'improved', 'things', 'making', 'story', 'more', 'dramatic', 'approachable.No', 'commentary', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'brilliance', 'soundtrack', 'meticulous', 'reenactments', 'concert', 'scenes', 'Many', 'locations', 'Curtis', 'life', 'death', 'were', 'actually', 'used', 'making', 'Control', 'adding', 'unmistakable', 'punch', 'plot', 'Finally', 'fine', 'acting', 'part', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'who', 'appeared', 'onscreen', 'was', 'delight', 'see', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'turning', 'out', 'emotional', 'performances', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'recognition', 'something', 'outside', 'film', 'Control', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'Hollywood.Like', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Control', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'still', 'darn', 'interesting']",Control
1123921,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00104AYGU,Doug Anderson,"[12, 14]","This film is based on Deborah Curtis' biography and so this ""Ian Curtis"" is the Ian Curtis that she knew and Control in most respects adheres to her interpretation of his life. But it should be noted that Deborah Curtis knew but one side of Ian Curtis' story, her side. And like any other point of view that might have been chosen to tell this story, this one is limited & distorted. The writer of the screenplay is fully aware of the fact that Deborah's perspective is a limited one (as all of our perspectives are) and the screenplay makes some attempt (though not enough) to find the Ian that Deborah did not know, and that maybe no one knew. To achieve this screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh balances Deborah's own remembrance with the remembrance of other key figures in Ian's life (parents, band mates, Belgian girlfriend Annik) to give us a more rounded look at what it might have been like to be Ian Curtis. Unfortunately, these additional perspectives do not amount to as much as one would have liked them to as Ian was apparently not particularly close or open with parents or band mates. (The film rarely shows Ian interacting with either.) And the girlfriend just seems like a very pretty, very fresh, very young smiling face. Most likely the band has their own story to tell, as does the girlfriend Annik. To Deborah, Ian Curtis was a husband and so her story is one largely dominated by domestic squables. After the fourth or fifth round of domestic argument the film begins to feel like a film about marriage and not about music. The over-reliance on Deborah's perspective/biography begins to feel like a liability before the second hour of this two hour biopic begins, and the second hour is almost entirely devoted to the last moments of marital woe that, according to Deborah, sparked the final act. But there is so much more to this story than the one that Deborah has to tell. In addition to Ian the husband, there is Ian the singer and performer. And, most importantly to fans, there is the Ian Curtis that wrote some of the most austere and hypnotic and compelling rock music ever recorded. This is what is really missing form the film: a sense of where the music was coming from. Certainly some lyrics can be explained as autobiographical confessions of self-loathing and regret but some are comments and critiques on modern life.To listeners of Joy Division's postpunk sound what was immediately alluring was that it sounded nothing like punk. Punk was manic and Joy Division was subdued. The sound was hollow but hypnotic and the voice was full of romantic longings and yearnings for some kind of transcendence but the romantic longing was always accompanied by the feeling that there was nothing to be done with these feelings. If punk was about irreverence and having a rebellious larf in the face of authority, Joy Division was about looking for something to revere and finding that modern life gave man very little to revere. In the face of utter hopelessness, the only grace to be found was in the music itself because the music offered trance-like beauties unavailable in real life (Unknown Pleasures). To fans, Ian & the band were the rarest of things, the expression of a genuinely original sensibility/musical vision. Unfortunately, this is the part of Ian's story that Deborah has the least access to--the writer Ian and the stage Ian is someone she barely knew--, and so it is simply not dealt with. We get no sense of what music meant to Ian nor what he was looking for in it, and without some kind of understanding of the music it is very difficult to understand Ian. Instead we get a story about a relationship and a cliched one at that. Sympathetic as we are with Deborah, rock wives rarely lead happy lives, and in biopics they almost always look like obstacles to their more talented husbands artistic urges & drives. Thats true here as well. And sad as the relationship between Ian and Deborah was it is simply one part of a larger story.The other perspective on display here is the directors. As one might suspect from that very romantic film poster, director Anton Corbijn knows Ian as a photographic object. And, as a visual object itself, the film  is primarily a chance for Corbijn to display his own considerable gifts for grim yet starkly beautiful composition. From both the still  photographs that he took of the actual band circa 1980 (which should have been included in the DVD extra gallery) and from the film itself, one can understand that Corbijn felt a deep connection to Ian & Ian's unique romantic/existential sensibility and vision. As compelling and convincing as the film sometimes is, it is a work of art made by an artist that has his own ideas about what made Ian what he was and what made the music what it was. But, like all great artists, Ian was more than just the sum of his many influences (William Wordsworth, Lou Reed, Brain Eno, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Apocalypse Now, Werner Herzog...) and so no mere visual record of these influences and sources from which he drew will ever fully explain the artists own vision. Artists recognize greatness in others but the good ones always transcend their sources. Ian Curtis' true sources of inspiration are & will remain mysterious, no film can really know or show what Ian was or knew or what he felt when listening to a favorite song or reading a favorite book; no one can know what Ian was to Ian. Biopics are intriguing and frustrating because they are, at best, speculative. Though the film faithfully represents Deborah's version of things, the key moments in this life are ones that no one had any access to but Ian (how does anyone really know what he watched, or listened to, or thought in those last moments?). Faced with unknowability, it is our nature to be curious and to speculate but one should not mistake speculation for truth. As a result, the most valuable part of this DVD to those fans of Ian the artist and his formidable band mates (given short shrift in this film) will be the actual footage (not included in the actual film but included as a DVD extra along with Corbijn's 1988 video for Atmosphere and the Killers video for Shadowplay) of the real Joy Division playing Transmission.",4,"Exquisite B/W Cinematography,

1123923,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00104AYGU,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[2, 3]","A biopic on the short and (I guess) somewhat tragic life of Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis. Starting out as a pre-emo kid on the streets of Manchester up till his suicide at the age of 24, this tale shows how fame as a music star is just too much for some to handle, even when you're dealing with the smaller amounts.I dunno though, watching this I kept thinking that this story isn't really all that interesting or filmworthy other than the fact that it's main subject died so young. Strangely the picture takes place mostly in the mid to late 70's but it's entirely shot in black & white and seemed like the wrong choice for it, no matter if it's a sad tale or not. And even though Sam Riley is the spitting image of the late Curtis, down to his appearance and stage presence (of which I had to go to YouTube to refresh my memory of who Joy Division was like in the first place), his life story seemed too trivial and predictable for me to really care. He and the band make it quickly, he has to deal with occasional epilepsy, he marries young and has an affair/love-triangle, and finally decides to check out of life. Pretty by the numbers really, and in the end you wonder if anyone today who doesn't hate the world while wearing black mascara and dark clothes really cares.

1123924,AK5IU1VX89CZM,B00104AYGU,foghorn,"[1, 1]","You know the story. Ian Curtis, lead singer/songwriter for Joy Division, tragically ends his young life just as one of the most influential post-punk UK bands from the late 70's begins their climb to fame.This movie begged to be filmed in black and white, and thankfully Anton Corbijn had the good sense to do it. The cinematography, score (if you want to call it a ""score"" - it is mainly songs by other artists, such as Bowie, Lou Reed, and Kraftwerk, that influenced Curtis), and casting are all top notch. Sam Riley is uncanny as Ian Curtis, and Samantha Morton as Debbie Curtis and Alexandra Maria Lara as Annik Honore probably could not have been cast better either. Tony Kebbel is a kick to watch as Rob Gretton.As long is one is aware the movie focuses primarily on Curtis's relationship with his wife and his affair with Annik Honore, all is well. And there is enough musical footage thrown in to satisfy most Joy Division fans, which, I might add, is as about as realistic as one could ever expect from a movie. There are however, two or three parts of the film of which I must be critical. The first is technical in nature but to me is huge. There is a scene in the studio when the engineer is taping ""Isolation"" - Ian is laying down the vocal track to the already existing band tracks. Why in God's name, after putting so much effort into getting Riley to sound like Curtis (which in 90% of the movie was amazingly successful), do they allow him to sing Isolation in a way which sounds nothing like Curtis at all? This scene mystifies me completely. Riley sounds like a sick choir boy, so I was expecting the engineer to say ""Ian, what's wrong?""...but at the end of the song he tells him, essentially, ""great job, that's a wrap"". Sorry, no. That vocal track isn't even close to reality. The second issue is with the ending. Corbijn seems to be suggesting Ian took his life primarily as a result of his anguish over relationship issues, his love for Annik and guilt over what he had done to his wife. This is of course a distinct possibility, and no one will ever know the truth, but to those who know the history, the music, the lyrics, the environment, the epilepsy....this implication seems a little over-simplistic (although to be fair, since the movie was based on Debbie Curtis's book ""Touching From a Distance"", perhaps Corbijn was trying to stay true to what she had written, and I have not read that book). Also, Corbijn made it seem Curtis's suicide was almost a ""last minute"", or at best, a ""last hour"", decision. Again....maybe. But it didn't ring true to my sense of what was likely. Your mileage may vary. Finally, I was disappointed there was no mention of the album ""Closer"", even though we hear tracks from it. Odd to say the least.Certainly a film worth seeing, but for the true Joy Division aficionado, get the documentary by Grant Gee.

1123925,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B00104AYGU,Guy De Federicis,"[34, 45]","A biopic of Joy Division's lead singer, Ian Curtis? Who besides a handful of people like me, (in 1980 we had their posters on our bedroom wall and sketched what Joy Divison's third album cover might have looked like),  and the only other patron at the matinee theatrical showing that I viewed could possibly care? Indeed, why should I want to see actors performing a suicidal swan dive when all the sadness of Curtis' death lies imbedded in the gloomy, psyche-rich and beautiful music Joy Division left behind?Because now Ian Curtis is really dead. Anton Corbijn's film, ""Control"" brings closure to the first time I heard Joy Division, raced to a record store, and was no sooner through a second listen when I heard the lead singer had committed suicide. I've been in denial ever since, and the sketchy details of Curtis' death, the same sketchy details offered in the film, suddenly ring true to me.Filmed in the British working class black and white, like the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"", with tones of muted and spacious greys, like The Who's ""Quadrophenia"", the film brings vitality to the bleak Manchester neighborhoods that were the haunts of the band. It has that wide screen black and white ordinariness that film geeks love. Very common images of modest Brit apartments, cheap recording studios and seedy clubs, are given an immaculate shine by the variable b&w; cinematography which conjure not only the do-it-yourself Manchester music scene, but Joy Division's own bleak and surviving psyche. And the head bobbing teens digging the band in the clubs look like the honest to god post punks of yesterday.You'd thing that was genuine Joy Division during the musical performances, but it is the actors uncannily recreating the music with Sam Riley as Curtis, not only looking the part while delivering a 'let's-let's not' demeanor, but sounding like a dead-on Ian Curtis, with all the brooding deep voiced restraint Curtis possessed. In a subtle performance in which the camera finds him, as opposed to a mugging for the camera, Riley as Curtis, (just another English bloke holding a day job), gives reason to believe in the seemingly petty causes of Curtis' self-destruction. He simply didn't want to live anymore, (""I give them everything 'on stage' and they want more""), and the overload of prescription drugs to combat epilepsy surely complicated matters. Samantha Morton as wife Deborah Curtis, (whose autobiography the film is based), is extraordinary as the plain and sexy love struck young woman who stands like a pillar against Curtis' doomed horizon.

It's also filmed in crisp, unforgiving black and white, calling to mind smoke-filled art house cinemas and the works they showed twenty years before Joy Division's short-lived moment.  So I wanted to like it more than I did.  But it's too long (doomed rock star biopics should never run more than 90 minutes) and it was hard for me at least to work up much sympathy for Curtis, who, as depicted here and aside from the medical issue of his epilepsy, created his own situation (he wanted to impulsively get married, he wanted to have a child) and then does not have the guts or the energy to either extricate himself from it or live with the consequences of his own actions and end his extramarital affair.  Instead he spends a lot of time crying and feeling sorry, mostly for himself.  I imagine there are lots of plumbers, stockbrokers, and farmers with exactly the same bad-decision trap as Curtis.

1123929,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00104AYGU,J from NY,"[1, 1]","I remember first hearing Ian Curtis' haunting, gloomily dictatorial croon in the 2001 semi classic ""Donnie Darko"" and as a kid listening to Nine Inch Nails' version of ""Dead Souls"" on ""The Crow"" soundtrack.  They struck me, and still do, as one of the darkest bands I have ever heard--move over, all you candya** contemporary posers like Manson or Evanescence.  One might even say that they went full circle with the lyrics of insanity, impending doom, etc with Curtis' absurdly early demise.  They were the real thing.Anton Corbjin's ""Control"" is not so much about the band Joy Divison itself as Curtis' life.  Shot in a sort of sepia black and white style typical of his photography, a minimalist approach to this enigmatic and ultra tragic figure is employed to maximum effect.  Inspired by Deborah Curtis's ""Touching From A Distance"", a biopic on her tumultuous relationship with Curtis, I couldn't but feel that some of the uglier aspects of Curtis' personality--and the very real possibility that he faked his epilepsy--were glossed over.  We don't see much of the monstrous behavior Curtis would often display, like dumping a Bloody Mary on his wife's head for dancing with a friend at their wedding, or nearly kicking in Tony Wilson's door (the scene makes his verbal assault on the legendary music producer seem ""cool"") when he didn't get his way.Don't get me wrong, this is a fine film and illustrates well how Curtis' infidelity and non-communicativeness, worlds apart seemingly from everyone else, may have led to his tragic demise. It is also a fantastic portrayal of the post industrial punk scene of that time.  But I can't help wondering if there was something else going on besides these things.  Ian Curtis was a person who did not want help.  Deborah Curtis suggested he see a psychologist on numerous occasions and he absolutely refused to do so.The film illustrates some very real possibilities, but I doubt that the final book or film on Curtis has been written or made.  That said, this is a nearly great film everyone who has any interest a classic band and a sad musical figure should see.",4,"Fine film, bit of a whitewash though",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,2114,"['remember', 'first', 'hearing', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'haunting', 'gloomily', 'dictatorial', 'croon', '2001', 'semi', 'classic', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'kid', 'listening', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'version', 'Dead', 'Souls', 'Crow', 'soundtrack', 'struck', 'still', 'do', 'one', 'darkest', 'bands', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'move', 'candya**', 'contemporary', 'posers', 'Manson', 'Evanescence', 'One', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'went', 'full', 'circle', 'lyrics', 'insanity', 'impending', 'doom', 'etc', 'Curtis', 'absurdly', 'early', 'demise', 'were', 'real', 'thing.Anton', 'Corbjin', 'Control', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'band', 'Joy', 'Divison', 'Curtis', 'life', 'Shot', 'sort', 'sepia', 'black', 'white', 'style', 'typical', 'photography', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'enigmatic', 'ultra', 'tragic', 'figure', 'employed', 'maximum', 'effect', 'Inspired', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'Touching', 'Distance', 'biopic', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Curtis', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'uglier', 'aspects', 'Curtis', 'personality', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'faked', 'epilepsy', 'were', 'glossed', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'monstrous', 'behavior', 'Curtis', 'would', 'often', 'display', 'dumping', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'wife', 'head', 'dancing', 'friend', 'wedding', 'nearly', 'kicking', 'Tony', 'Wilson', 'door', 'scene', 'verbal', 'assault', 'legendary', 'music', 'producer', 'seem', 'cool', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'way.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'fine', 'film', 'well', 'how', 'Curtis', 'infidelity', 'non-communicativeness', 'worlds', 'apart', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'else', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'tragic', 'demise', 'also', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'post', 'industrial', 'punk', 'scene', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'things', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'help', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'suggested', 'see', 'psychologist', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'absolutely', 'refused', 'do', 'so.The', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'possibilities', 'doubt', 'final', 'book', 'film', 'Curtis', 'been', 'written', 'made', 'said', 'nearly', 'great', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'interest', 'classic', 'band', 'sad', 'musical', 'figure', 'should', 'see']",Control

If you know the way that Mr Corbijn used to make photographs for that musical weekly, it is visually slightly different. Instead of grainy images with innovative angles of vision, we get a very straightforward photography that suits the storyline well. Of course, if you know rock, Joy Division or even if you have read the book by his wife, you will already know the storyline by heart. WE discover Joy Division to be just another band...but with a very strong new musical approach. Since the movie is based on her book (Touching from a distance) the book does of course provide a sympathetic image of Debbie Curtis but  also a rather neutral one of his on-the-road mistress Annik Honore. Apparently the main actor sang and the band played themselves which is very surprising because they are excellent and sound and look very much like the original band. The portrayal of Ian Curtis as a talented young man who suddenly becomes this iconic leader of a post-punk band is excellently portrayed and we see his disintegration by his epilepsy and alcohol lead to his early death. As Corbijn says in the excellent interview: it was alcohol combined with exhaustion and his epilepsy drugs that made him more depressed and made small problems seem unsurmountable. Indeed as he said a man loved by 2 women does usually not commit suicide.

One of the most influential rock bands of all-time, it grew out of 4 guys from Manchester in love with punk bands such as the Buzzcocks and the Sex Pistols.  But rather than having a similar sound to those punk bands, Joy Division's sound was something entirely new, ushering the post-punk sound, one that combined the raw edge of punk but with gothic and dramatic tendencies.  This sound would prove influential to countless 80's bands and also more recent ones, most notably ""Interpol"" and ""Editors"".  The Joy Division story is a tragic one, as singer Ian Curtis committed suicide at the age of 23.  The remaining members then went on to form New Order, sell 20 million albums in the process and the rest is history.  ""Control"" is a semi-autobiographical look at Curtis' rapid rise to fame and equally fast descent into despair.The story traces Curtis' life from the age of 16 and beyond.  A David Bowie worshipping, chain-smoking, distracted teenager, Curtis never quite fit in with the school crowd and used music and poetry as an outlet to his emotions.  He married while still in high school and had a child shortly thereafter, all of this before being in the band.  Then the story shows us how he met up with the other band members and their rapid rise to fame.  Throughout all this, Curtis worked a day job as an unemployment office counselor and had to tend care to his wife and newly-born daughter.  The struggle between being in the band and being on the road (which in itself was not quite enough to pay the bills) and his family responsibilities not to mention his epileptic condition proved to be too much for Curtis to bear and the movie concludes with him tragically putting an end to his life.I found ""Control"" to be bar none of the best movie bio-pics ever.  The director's decision to make the movie in black and white is an absolutely brilliant one, as it accurately catches the essence of he band, whose artwork was always in black and white and also gives the picture the gritty feel it merits.  The best part of the movie of course is the breakout performance of Sam Riley as the title character, who nails Curtis to the point of eeriness.  The downcast looks, the hairstyle, the jittery movements on stage, everything is bang-on.  I read somewhere that the singer of New Order had to stop watching the film midway because Riley bore too much of a resemblance to Curtis that it was scary to him.  I can see why.  Another star in this movie is the music.  Joy Division's music is great of course, but the way the director selectively uses songs that fit the mood of what's currently unfolding on screen is remarkable.If I were to have one issue with this film I would have to say that the reason for some of Curtis's emotions are never really explained.  Why exactly is he so depressed when he has so much to be proud of?  Why did he stop loving his wife so suddenly when she never stopped loving him?  Maybe Curtis proved to be so complex of a character that even he himself didn't really know who he truly was.  It should be noted that this DVD offers generous extras such as a commentary track, a 20mns making-of documentary, a director interview, still gallery, promotional materials, extended live performances from the film.  But the highlight would have to be the music videos, where we see the real Curtis performing on BBC and see just how much of a resemblance there is between him and the actor that portrays him.  Overall, ""Control"" is brilliant, essential stuff for both fans and also non-fans who just want to sit through a great drama.

""Control"" gives us the disaster everyone now sees coming.  The script is based on the book ""Touching From A Distance"" by Deborah Curtis, wife of the late Ian Curtis.  Her memories and director Anton Corbijn's eye for texture drive this rather slow, mannered take on the Joy Division story.  Sitting room aridity and Euro artiness seem inevitable with this particular concoction.  It's a worthwhile exercise but fortunately just one version of a music phenom's howl in the night.  The recent Joy Division documentary is an essential companion piece and a must see for all devotees of the band and post-punk.  Corbijn's film, on the other hand, gives us a young man who could not reconcile his hasty marriage with a compulsion to scream out his dark phantoms from the stage.The Dutchman's cinematography is bleak but beautiful, the end of the film, as expected, wrenching.  And yet the last leap is more a relief, a kind of release, than an emotional gut punch.  Curtis had an interior as grim as his surroundings, an internal landscape drained of fellow feeling by a fascination with the abomination, but the descent needs a counterpoint.  Curtis had a laddishness too.  When Curtis (Sam Riley) explains ""Man City Blue"" to his Belgian girlfriend Anik, there is a glimmer of the submerged Manc scally.  The real Curtis supported a football team, drank pints, and engaged in elaborate pranks with his bandmates, all barely out of school (they were particularly fond of a turd holding challenge).  The trajectory of ""Control"" doesn't allow for the contrast of British bluster and reserve.  The film gives us only the latter, to the extreme, which in a way seems a clich&eacute;.  The visual acuity of the film is undeniable, however.  The marital meltdown is equally powerful for its authenticity, and Riley does a very good spastic chicken dance and pale-eyed gaze to the beyond: both trademarks of a seer too soon felled.",4,No Exit,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,2040,"['Train', 'wrecks', 'are', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'when', 'passengers', 'are', 'young', 'so', 'talented', 'so', 'full', 'potential', 'Control', 'disaster', 'everyone', 'now', 'coming', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'Touching', 'Distance', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'wife', 'late', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'memories', 'director', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'eye', 'texture', 'drive', 'rather', 'slow', 'mannered', 'take', 'Joy', 'Division', 'story', 'Sitting', 'room', 'aridity', 'Euro', 'artiness', 'seem', 'inevitable', 'particular', 'concoction', 'worthwhile', 'exercise', 'fortunately', 'just', 'one', 'version', 'music', 'phenom', 'howl', 'night', 'recent', 'Joy', 'Division', 'documentary', 'essential', 'companion', 'piece', 'must', 'see', 'devotees', 'band', 'post-punk', 'Corbijn', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'reconcile', 'hasty', 'marriage', 'compulsion', 'scream', 'out', 'dark', 'phantoms', 'stage.The', 'Dutchman', 'cinematography', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'end', 'film', 'expected', 'wrenching', 'yet', 'last', 'leap', 'more', 'relief', 'kind', 'release', 'emotional', 'gut', 'punch', 'Curtis', 'had', 'interior', 'as', 'grim', 'surroundings', 'internal', 'landscape', 'drained', 'fellow', 'feeling', 'fascination', 'abomination', 'descent', 'counterpoint', 'Curtis', 'had', 'laddishness', 'too', 'When', 'Curtis', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'Man', 'City', 'Blue', 'Belgian', 'girlfriend', 'Anik', 'glimmer', 'submerged', 'Manc', 'scally', 'real', 'Curtis', 'supported', 'football', 'team', 'drank', 'pints', 'engaged', 'elaborate', 'pranks', 'bandmates', 'barely', 'school', 'were', 'particularly', 'fond', 'turd', 'holding', 'challenge', 'trajectory', 'Control', ""n't"", 'allow', 'contrast', 'British', 'bluster', 'reserve', 'film', 'only', 'latter', 'extreme', 'way', 'clich', 'eacute', 'visual', 'acuity', 'film', 'undeniable', 'however', 'marital', 'meltdown', 'equally', 'powerful', 'authenticity', 'Riley', 'very', 'good', 'spastic', 'chicken', 'dance', 'pale-eyed', 'gaze', 'trademarks', 'seer', 'too', 'soon', 'felled']",Control

I am not the suicidal singer of a New Wave band, I am not in love with a French journalist, and I do not think I married too early, but watching this, the movie really put me inside the man's skin.""Control"" tells the story of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's ill-fated lead singer--as well as his unfortunate wife, his band, his manager, his label, and his lover--and it does so without resorting to making it a slick biopic or a phony depiction of celebrity.  It is one of the realest feeling films I have ever seen, and yet it doesn't sacrifice anything compelling or filmic to be so.  The story plows ahead with amazing music and a formidable drive, with scenes that are artfully shot and gorgeous to behold.The film's final scenes are indelible, cut forever into my mind, and the feeling the film invokes is powerful.

""Control"" follows Curtis' life from 1973-1980, starting with his high school days in Macclesfield with future wife Debbie (Samantha Morton), through joining a band with Bernard Sumner (James Anthony Pearson) and Peter Hook (Joe Anderson) in 1976, to Joy Division's success -having added drummer Stephen Morris (Harry Treadaway). All the while,  Ian (Sam Riley) suffered increasingly from the crushing stress of the band and family, exacerbated by side effects from his medications for inadequately uncontrolled epilepsy. Anton Corbijn knew Curtis briefly, having photographed the band, so ""Control"" feels like a personal and heartfelt project.The black-and-white photography, Sam Riley's resemblance to Ian Curtis, and the music are striking. The music is actually performed by the actors, whose instruments are plugged in and microphones turned on. Riley has limited experience as an actor; he is a singer, and a darned good one for Joy Division's post-punk sound. They sound good. The gig scenes are electric. ""Control"" is black-and-white, because the band's visual history is almost entirely black-and-white. It's beautiful. The film is longer than it needs to be but doesn't  feel prolonged. It spends time establishing Ian Curtis' ambition, talent, temperament, and then his deteriorating state of mind. Sam Riley's performance is surprisingly charismatic and sympathetic without ever being sentimental. Toby Kebbell provides some comic relief as manager Rob Gretton. ""Control"" is the story of a modern poet and one of the most memorable music-themed films I've seen.The DVD (Weinstein 2008): ""The Making of Control"" (23 min) interviews the director about his inspiration and decisions, the cast about playing real people, and writer Matt Greenhalgh about his process. ""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (13 min) discusses the director's relationship with the band, his view of Curtis, and casting the film. ""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" (9 min) offers 3 performances. ""Music Videos"" are ""Transmission"" from 1979 (3 1/2 min), ""Atmosphere"" (4 min) from 1988, and a cover of ""Shadowplay"" (4 min) by The Killers from 2007.

1123943,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00104AYGU,Paul Allaer,"[3, 3]","Noted rock photographer and video maker Anton Corbijn, who had met the members of Joy Division on a couple of occasions in the late 1970s, makes his debut as a director of a feature film with his take on the life and death of Ian Curtis. (The script is based on the 1995 memoir from Debbie Curtis, Ian's wife.)As to the film, ""Control"" (122 min.) is as good a rock bio-pic that I can remember, keeping in mind that this is meant to be a film about Ian Curtis, not about Joy Division as such. Ian's struggles with epilepsy, alcohol and medication abuse, and most of all his relationship with people, including his wife Debbie, his Belgian girlfriend Annik, the band members, and last but not least, himself. As the movie goes on, and Ian's moods turn darker, it becomes more difficult to watch, because you now how it all will end. The movie is appropriately shot in black and white. The acting is outstanding, none more so than Sam Riley as Ian Curtis. Special kudos als for the four actors playing the Joy Division songs. This is not a playback or dubbed: it's the actors themselves playing the music, and they did a great job at it. I thought that Anton Corbijn did an outstanding job as well in directing this film.The DVD comes with a number of nice extras. In particular ""The Making of Control"" (23 min.) and ""A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (12 min.) are quite insightful. The ""Extended Live Performances From the Film"" segment is mislabeled, in the sense that it brings a mere 3 songs (Transmission, Candidate, and Leaders of Men), so it is not quite the ""extension"" it could have been. There are a couple of videos as well, most interesting the 1979 performance from a BBC show, which is fascinating (and underscores how well Sam Riley has ""caught"" Ian Curtis). In all, ""Control"" is a fantastic movie.

1123945,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00104AYGU,Poor Napoleon,"[2, 2]","Anton Corbijn has probably lived up to the old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" a million times over, having captured photos of too many acts to mention.  While he's done a number of music videos, he's more known for photography.  It's fitting then that his feature directorial debut seems to stand more of a collection of photos than one single film.  But don't worry, that's to the film's credit.The main attraction of Corbijn's direction is a stark attention to detail.  As a photographer, there's one shot that has to speak volumes to viewers.  Corbijn takes advantage of numerous shots to get in Ian Curtis's head.  In one of the opening shots, a young Curtis, played brilliantly by Sam Riley, is seen sitting on his bead.  While we hear David Bowie blaring in the background, Corbijn gives us a look around, gazing at Curtis's book collection and pictures and posters of such iconic rock stars as Lou Reed.As to the story, it's a very familiar one to Joy Division's fans.  So familiar, that it's already appeared on film, albeit more briefly, in the brilliant comedic 24 Hour Party People.  The film's appeal will be the attention put on Curtis as opposed to Joy Division as a whole.  This is where the movie takes on a life of its own.  Corbijn attends to such details as Curtis's lowly job in an unemployment office and continuous interactions with Curtis's wife, Deborah.  Corbijn's gift as a photographer pours over on these scenes as he takes time with each scene, allowing the viewer to really absorb not only the immediacy of what is seen on each scene, but the internal emotion that is felt as well.  This is the power of Corbijn at work.None of camera's magic would work, however, if it weren't for the brilliant performances and the intentionally spare script.  The cast is led by Sam Riley, who has the uneasy task of stepping into Ian Curtis' shoes.  He gets it all down to Ian's hypnotic performances on stage.  Samantha Morton also packs a punch as the distraught performer's wife.The script is fairly direct and familiar. The pictures speak for themselves.  There are no long monologues or quick witted lines of texts in the film.  A lot of the drama is delivered by the camera.  Corbijn, a man known for minimalism, is powerful as director in creating a portrait of one of the most iconic figures of the post punk scene.  While Corbijn's photos often allow us to spend a moment with someone through his use of minimalism and candid photography, Control feels like we just spent our lives with Ian Curtis.",5,"A lovely, sad portrait of Ian Curtis",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,2537,"['Anton', 'Corbijn', 'probably', 'lived', 'up', 'old', 'adage', 'picture', 'thousand', 'words', 'million', 'times', 'over', 'having', 'captured', 'photos', 'too', 'many', 'acts', 'mention', 'done', 'number', 'music', 'videos', 'more', 'known', 'photography', 'fitting', 'then', 'feature', 'directorial', 'debut', 'stand', 'more', 'collection', 'photos', 'one', 'single', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'film', 'credit.The', 'main', 'attraction', 'Corbijn', 'direction', 'stark', 'attention', 'detail', 'photographer', 'one', 'shot', 'speak', 'volumes', 'viewers', 'Corbijn', 'advantage', 'numerous', 'shots', 'get', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'head', 'one', 'opening', 'shots', 'young', 'Curtis', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'seen', 'sitting', 'bead', 'hear', 'David', 'Bowie', 'blaring', 'background', 'Corbijn', 'look', 'gazing', 'Curtis', 'book', 'collection', 'pictures', 'posters', 'such', 'iconic', 'rock', 'stars', 'Lou', 'Reed.As', 'story', 'very', 'familiar', 'one', 'Joy', 'Division', 'fans', 'So', 'familiar', 'already', 'appeared', 'film', 'more', 'briefly', 'brilliant', 'comedic', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'film', 'appeal', 'will', 'be', 'attention', 'put', 'Curtis', 'opposed', 'Joy', 'Division', 'whole', 'where', 'movie', 'life', 'own', 'Corbijn', 'such', 'details', 'Curtis', 'lowly', 'job', 'unemployment', 'office', 'continuous', 'interactions', 'Curtis', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Corbijn', 'gift', 'photographer', 'pours', 'scenes', 'time', 'scene', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'really', 'absorb', 'not', 'only', 'immediacy', 'what', 'seen', 'scene', 'internal', 'emotion', 'felt', 'as', 'well', 'power', 'Corbijn', 'work.None', 'camera', 'magic', 'would', 'work', 'however', 'were', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'performances', 'intentionally', 'spare', 'script', 'cast', 'led', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'who', 'uneasy', 'task', 'stepping', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'shoes', 'down', 'Ian', 'hypnotic', 'performances', 'stage', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'also', 'punch', 'distraught', 'performer', 'wife.The', 'script', 'fairly', 'direct', 'familiar', 'pictures', 'speak', 'are', 'long', 'monologues', 'quick', 'witted', 'lines', 'texts', 'film', 'lot', 'drama', 'delivered', 'camera', 'Corbijn', 'man', 'known', 'minimalism', 'powerful', 'director', 'creating', 'portrait', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'figures', 'post', 'punk', 'scene', 'Corbijn', 'photos', 'often', 'allow', 'spend', 'moment', 'someone', 'use', 'minimalism', 'candid', 'photography', 'Control', 'just', 'spent', 'lives', 'Ian', 'Curtis']",Control

It starts that was but half way thru it, it simply drags on.  I did not know much about ""Joy Division"" and Ian Curtis, until I started reading film and book reviews about him.  Surely, it is always intriguing for anyone to try to figure out what drives a person of 23 years to commit suicide, the way Ian did.  Born and raised in Manchester, with no education and not much to do, he marries young, has a baby on the impulse and starts career as a singer in a local band as a way to keep himself involved with the crowd and nurtures his musical talent.  He also likes to write poems so it seems natural, his attraction to the art.  Until one day, Ian discovers that he is epileptic.  His life is consisting of pills he needs to have around the clock in order to avoid the seizures that have devastating effect on his body and overall mental state.  Tours to promote his band's material, binge drinking, late hours inside crowded clubs, hords of fans and women are adding unexpected stress to his life.  Ian is unable and unwilling to tend to his wife and young child and is having mistress who is French, seemingly sophisticated and free as a person -- which is amazing to him.  He starts his affair with Annik Honore almost as a way to create a new freedom for himself only to learn too soon that it is impossible to have it all.  He is immature, more than he is a jerk and emotionally unstable to handle all the changes that happened to him too quickly in both his personal and professional life.  Ian is troubled and there is really no one that can help him with his problems.  Him committing suicide almost seems like the only available option to the complete chaos in his life.  He is just too much of a burden to his own self and people around him and with his epilepsy his future is bleak anyway...I think I would like to listen to his album - his voice seems to be unique.

Anton Corbijn's ""Control,"" shot in black and white, gets the gray and miserable parts of Curtis' life exactly right. The movie is based on a book by Curtis' wife Deborah. They were married when he was 19 and she was 18. They had a child. He was depressed. He joined a band. He began having epileptic seizures. He started cheating on his wife. The band started to become successful. The seizures got worse. The end.Director Corbijn is known mainly as a rock photographer and, though well-acted, the movie feels a bit like a slideshow -- full of memorable (and depressing) imagery, plus concert performances that capture the look, feel and sound of Joy Division's live shows. As a biopic, it's a major contrast to a movie like ""I'm Not There"" which expands on the persona(s) of the artist and finds new ways to dramatize the impact of a creative life.  ""Control"" reduces Curtis' life to an oppressive kitchen sink drama.  It's realistic, but not uplifting. And you already know how it ends.

And in spite of the longevity of Joy Division's successor, New Order, I confess that the demise of Curtis, an authentic Rock tragic, singled the demise of my interest in their music. What explanation is there for an attraction to talent extinguished prematurely; the titillation of having glimpsed, sometimes stared at some gift that was squandered? In many instances, and Curtis's is among them, early, meteoric talent most likely was fufilled...fatalism was written into it, the biography and art in perfect tandem. Their music already sounded as if it was rising from the grave, a severly cold other place. That's what the popular press has continued to feed us over the ensuing decades. In this sense Corbijn's film is no exception. You buy the Q magazines or NME, whatever, for some fresh insight to such legends. But there isn't any. The film's script has been anticipated in the music; alienation of the inner, poetic self from the cramped and dour quotidian life of cramped, urban, Macclesfield. The band's public image, as per Corbijn's recreation has been honorably projected, mesmerizingly so by Sam Riley...the entire slow surge of its black and white cinematography inexorably, hauntingly moving toward the last gasp in that sad little kitchen.

While I can appreciate director Anton Corbijn's personal tribute to JD's lead singer IAN CURTIS, the film is just too Dark and Excessively Slow to recommend to the average viewer.Corbijn's stark B&W; photography (He was a close friend to the original Band and held many a photo shoot with them..Their 1st two album covers were Black-then White. A third, Grey!) perfectly captures the atmosphere of dank Manchester, England in the 1970's. Sam Reilly is Amazing as Ian and mimics Ian's voice and performance mannerisms to-a-T. Samantha Morton (Minority Report, Woody Allen's Sweet & Lowdown, Elizabeth - The Golden Age) is heartbreakingly good as Ian's suffering wife. The actors playing JD band mates are noteworthy and seem to play their own instruments which certainly add to the realism. However, the film just plods on at a Snail's pace. Maybe this was the director's ploy, to depress us Slowly into Submission given the nature of Ian's illness and make us feel what Ian felt. Any solid JD fan knows that although their music could be Dark & Challenging, it was never Boring or Depressing. Although we're given very small glimpses into the creative psyche, recording and performance of the band, CONTROL is really the slight, personal story of Ian Curtis their lead singer. You'll rarely see much in the way of lengthy music clips here.A better place to start is Grant Gee's new documentary JOY DIVISION just released by TWC as well. It paints a much broader picture of the Band and still maintains Ian's story as its main Focus. The music and performance clips of the Band are amazing and the Doc rarely drags.

1123952,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00104AYGU,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","""Control"" is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour.  The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here.  And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn`t seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works.  Yet, ""Control"" is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale.  The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn`t receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah`s memoirs chronicling their time together).  Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group`s songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film.  The movie also makes effective use of voiceover narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind.  Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine.  What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared.  What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old.  With subtlety and insight, ""Control"" movingly distills the essence of that sadness.",4,"subtle, well-acted docudrama",1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,3150,"['Control', 'biopic', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'lead', 'singer', '1970', 'British', 'rock', 'band', 'Joy', 'Division', 'who', 'killed', '1980', 'immediately', 'group', 'was', 'embark', 'first', 'American', 'tour', 'movie', 'Curtis', 'early', 'days', 'Manchester', 'formation', 'rise', 'band', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'serial', 'philandering', 'uncontrollable', 'epilepsy', 'lifelong', 'battle', 'depression.One', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'looking', 'bareboned', 'detailing', 'life', 'ask', 'really', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'indeed', 'Curtis', 'story', 'follow', 'fairly', 'standard', 'arc', 'lives', 'artists', 'general', 'rock', 'musicians', 'particular', 'there', 'doesn', 't', 'seem', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'illicit', 'drug', 'use', 'going', 'case', 'such', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'similar', 'works', 'Control', 'so', 'cool', 'understated', 'restrained', 'handling', 'material', 'drawing', 'lives', 'characters', 'spite', 'over-familiarity', 'tale', 'conflicts', 'are', 'real', 'emotions', 'raw', 'particularly', 'when', 'dealing', 'Curtis', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'who', 'loved', 'Ian', 'unconditionally', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'reciprocate', 'feelings', 'partly', 'Ian', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'Belgian', 'fan', 'met', 'tour.In', 'beautifully', 'controlled', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'poignantly', 'sadness', 'lie', 'ever', 'present', 'core', 'Curtis', 'being', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'almost', 'desperate', 'state', 'woman', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'realize', 'too', 'late', 'perhaps', 't', 'receiving', 'love', 'return', 'Matt', 'Greenhalgh', 'screenplay', 'based', 'largely', 'Deborah', 's', 'memoirs', 'chronicling', 'time', 'together', 'Much', 'anguish', 'Curtis', 'went', 'life', 'served', 'source', 'material', 'lyrics', 'many', 'group', 's', 'songs', 'number', 'are', 'used', 'provide', 'running', 'commentary', 'film', 'movie', 'also', 'effective', 'use', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'troubled', 'head', 'his.For', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'wisely', 'chosen', 'shoot', 'film', 'artful', 'black-and-white', 'better', 'capture', 'starkness', 'scene', 'state', 'character', 'mind', 'Joy', 'Division', 'purists', 'may', 'object', 'fact', 'Corbijn', 'had', 'actors', 'perform', 'songs', 'rather', 'dubbing', 'originals', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'overall', 'interpreting', 'pieces.Whether', 'Curtis', 'long', 'run', 'had', 'harder', 'life', 'many', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'not', 'determine', 'What', 'film', 'make', 'clear', 'however', 'once', 'felt', 'was', 'losing', 'control', 'life', 'symbolized', 'constant', 'seemingly', 'incurable', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'mess', 'things', 'husband', 'father', 'lover', 'purpose', 'continuing', 'struggle', 'seemed', 'have', 'disappeared', 'What', 'sad', 'conclusion', 'come', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'only', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'old', 'subtlety', 'insight', 'Control', 'movingly', 'essence', 'sadness']",Control

1123954,AEPVPNXQ1DC6A,B00104AYGU,"scott c ""scottc23""","[3, 3]","Thankfully, a film about Joy Division and the continuing myth of its frontman, Ian Curtis, landed in the right hands.  Only someone close to the band could have pulled off this masterful film, encapsulating not only Ian Curtis but the entire feel of a miserable place like late 70's Manchester, England.At the opening whirling, eerie sound of Exercise One, I was hooked for a lifetime.  Sadly, Joy Division was the basis of too many ""goth"" bands that followed who never seemed to understand their punk roots.  This movie, I hope and pray, will cast a dark light onto that presumption and dispel it once and for all.  Joy Division were a tough band in a tough time.Anton Corbijn made a solid choice to shoot this film in black and white.  Joy Division were a black and white band.  Stark, bleak, beautiful; beyond or beneath the confusion of color.  Marrying too soon, becoming too big and finding himself profoundly overwhelmed, Ian Curtis understood more about failed relationships and the futility of existence by 23 than most people will know in a lifetime.  He lived a black and white life.  Hope vs. despondency.In retrospect, the album Closer was one he could never survive.  That album is a blueprint for a funeral.  Yet never wallowing in self-pity, he crafted painfully honest lyrics that drive into the heart of depression.  Upon seeing this film, years after reading the book Touching From A Distance, it became even clearer that his suicide was a viable option for him.  His depression was severe, a US tour was the next day, his guilt about being a poor father and his two tenuous relationships were all approaching the boiling point.  As in all suicides, the pain of continuing on eclipsed the fear of the dying.  What was he to do?  Quit and go back to working at the employment office?  No.  That was a fate worse than death.Like the book, Control does a good job of portraying Ian Curtis not wholly as a victim of his diseases.  He was not the nicest guy yet you find yourself empathetic of his ordeals.  Where having a child will often transform a father, the birth of his child sent him further into despair.  For that, he could not forgive himself.  He was not merely ashamed of his behavior but, as he wrote in the song Isolation - ""I'm ashamed of the person I am.""  The grave was already shoveled; it was only a matter of time before he stepped in.I would recommend knowing and enjoying the music of Joy Division before seeing the film.  It is a great film but (possibly?) one that is best taken in context.  As a fan, it's fascinating to see their rise from nothing into massive.  And the toll it took on everyone.  It was a long wait for a great film about Ian Curtis and Joy Division and I can soundly declare, I'm glad I lived long enough to see it.",5,"Closer, Still, To The Bitter End",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,2775,"['Thankfully', 'film', 'Joy', 'Division', 'continuing', 'myth', 'frontman', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'landed', 'right', 'hands', 'Only', 'someone', 'close', 'band', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'masterful', 'film', 'encapsulating', 'not', 'only', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'entire', 'feel', 'miserable', 'place', 'late', '70', 'Manchester', 'England.At', 'opening', 'whirling', 'eerie', 'sound', 'Exercise', 'One', 'was', 'hooked', 'lifetime', 'Sadly', 'Joy', 'Division', 'was', 'basis', 'too', 'many', 'goth', 'followed', 'who', 'never', 'seemed', 'understand', 'punk', 'roots', 'movie', 'hope', 'pray', 'will', 'cast', 'dark', 'light', 'presumption', 'dispel', 'once', 'Joy', 'Division', 'were', 'tough', 'band', 'tough', 'time.Anton', 'Corbijn', 'made', 'solid', 'choice', 'shoot', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'Joy', 'Division', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'band', 'Stark', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'beneath', 'confusion', 'color', 'Marrying', 'too', 'soon', 'becoming', 'too', 'big', 'finding', 'profoundly', 'overwhelmed', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'understood', 'more', 'failed', 'relationships', 'futility', 'existence', '23', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'lifetime', 'lived', 'black', 'white', 'life', 'Hope', 'despondency.In', 'retrospect', 'album', 'Closer', 'was', 'one', 'could', 'never', 'survive', 'album', 'blueprint', 'funeral', 'never', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'crafted', 'painfully', 'honest', 'lyrics', 'drive', 'heart', 'depression', 'seeing', 'film', 'years', 'reading', 'book', 'Touching', 'A', 'Distance', 'became', 'even', 'clearer', 'suicide', 'was', 'viable', 'option', 'depression', 'was', 'severe', 'US', 'tour', 'was', 'next', 'day', 'guilt', 'being', 'poor', 'father', 'two', 'tenuous', 'relationships', 'were', 'approaching', 'boiling', 'point', 'suicides', 'pain', 'continuing', 'eclipsed', 'fear', 'dying', 'What', 'was', 'do', 'Quit', 'go', 'back', 'working', 'employment', 'office', 'No', 'was', 'fate', 'worse', 'death.Like', 'book', 'Control', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'not', 'wholly', 'victim', 'diseases', 'was', 'not', 'nicest', 'guy', 'yet', 'find', 'empathetic', 'ordeals', 'Where', 'having', 'child', 'will', 'often', 'transform', 'father', 'birth', 'child', 'sent', 'further', 'despair', 'could', 'not', 'forgive', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'ashamed', 'behavior', 'wrote', 'song', 'Isolation', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'person', 'am', 'grave', 'was', 'already', 'shoveled', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'stepped', 'in.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'knowing', 'enjoying', 'music', 'Joy', 'Division', 'seeing', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'taken', 'context', 'fan', 'fascinating', 'see', 'rise', 'nothing', 'massive', 'toll', 'took', 'everyone', 'was', 'long', 'wait', 'great', 'film', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Joy', 'Division', 'can', 'soundly', 'declare', ""'m"", 'glad', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'see']",Control

The film is yet to receive a Blu-ray release in the US, but has been released in Germany and Canada. This review covers the Canadian version, which is locked to Region A.The film made just under $8 million worldwide owing to the dark subject matter and the fact that Joy Division's music still isn't widely known. That's a shame because Corbijn (The American) has made a wonderful film.This is the story of Ian Curtis who was the lead singer for Joy Division until his suicide in 1980. He died on May 18, so it was 31 years ago today at the time of writing.I wanted to see the film because Joy Division is still one of my Top 5 bands 30 years later. I know who made me the tape so that I could hear debut album Unknown Pleasures for the first time and I remember who I was with and where I was when the news leaked that Curtis was dead.It wasn't easy to find a theater which was showing the film when it was released so I ended up hunting down an obscure run-down cinema in downtown Toronto to even see it. About six other people showed up. Every single one appeared deeply moved and on the verge of tears after the film. I'm happy to finally own it on Blu-ray.The main problem I have with this review is that I went in loving the band and knowing most of the story. Did it work for me because of that, or is it truly a great story that will appeal to people who know nothing about Curtis or Joy Division? It partly depends on whether you like the dark, brooding music, but it works for some people who don't like the band at all.The film is bleak. It appears in black and white and is set in a northern town in England (Macclesfield). The houses are small, the streets are narrow and it rains often. This is all true. It's a depressing part of the country. The dreary setting matches the atmosphere of the music and the band's tale. The film shows how the band came into existence and their early successes such as recording, getting a recording contract and appearing on TV, but this isn't a true biopic.Although I knew the lyrics and understood what the words meant before I saw the film, I didn't know the origin of those lyrics. The film ties together some of the events in the life of Curtis with the origin of the songs. When you see what She's Lost Control is really about, it adds new layers of meaning. If you think Love Will Tear Us Apart sounds like a pop song, it takes on a more sinister tone when you understand why he wrote it.The actors rehearsed together to get the songs right so that they could play them in the film rather than miming. Corbijn never intended to include real performances of the music, but the ""band"" convinced him. The first time I heard the first note of the first song played in the film, I felt a huge surge of emotion.Sam Riley manages to look very similar to Curtis and must have spent a long time studying the few examples of Curtis performing the songs. He mimics the actions perfectly and sounds like him too. It was almost like stepping back in time and experiencing a Joy Division concert. Samantha Morton gives a strong performance, managing to look like a young girl and then his wife and the mother of his child.There's a lot of truth in this film too. Deborah Curtis (his wife) wrote the book Touching From A Distance which tells what really happened. The screenplay was adapted from that book and the details are as true as possible. Corbijn shot some of the iconic photographs of Curtis and the band while working as a photographer for the New Musical Express in England. This was a labor of love.The result is a moving drama detailing the final few years of Curtis' life. It doesn't hold much back, showing his faults as well as his redeeming qualities. It's the story of a young man (23 when he died) who was in a situation he couldn't control. Loving and hating two different women, a parent at a young age, success at a level that was hard to imagine and all the while dealing with epilepsy. His character says in the film that the audience didn't realize how much he gave during a performance, or how draining it was and how painful to access the emotions to perform those songs. To the audience, they were songs. To Curtis, they were hideous parts of his life.I found the film incredibly moving, haunting, captivating, happy and sad. I'm glad that Curtis will be introduced to new audiences through this film. Joy Division is important to me and Control is one of the most prized Blu-rays in my collection.Video Quality 4.5/5The film was shot in color and transferred to black and white and the images suit the mood of the film perfectly. Detail is sharp throughout and the print is clean and natural in appearance. I have also seen the German release and the presentation is similar. It's hard to imagine the film looking any better.Audio Quality 5/5The sound is the best I have ever heard where music is concerned. It's as good as listening to a CD on high quality equipment. The songs have a lot of depth and range and it's easy to pick out individual instruments. The dialogue is also clear.Special Features 4/5Audio commentary with director Anton Corbijn.Making of Control, featuring interviews with Corbijn, the writer and some of the actors (24 minutes).Extended live performances from the film:TransmissionLeaders of MenCandidateMusic Videos:Atmosphere - Joy DivisionTransmission - Joy DivisionShadowplay - The KillersTwo theatrical trailers.Joy Division's music isn't for everyone, but this is an interesting look at the life of Ian Curtis whether you are a fan or not. The presentation from Alliance is superb and I would recommend it to anyone capable of viewing Region A material. The actors do a wonderful job and the music sounds authentic. It will send shivers down your spine.Overall score 5/5",5,A fitting tribute to Ian Curtis,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,6252,"['Control', 'drama', 'biography', 'music', 'Directed', 'Anton',

For the record, Ian Curtis' most striking feature was his almost transparent, otherworldly eyes.Anyone who knows the story of Joy Division is aware that this tale does not have a happy ending.  Don't have to spell it out.  The trajectory is doomed from the start so, of course, this in effect bogs down the whole enterprise.  That said, the script, based on the book by Deborah Curtis, rings strikingly true to life, and in fact feels like cinema verite at its finest.  Sam Riley does his own singing and is nothing less than remarkable in his evocation.  And, as suspected, all band members played their own instruments too.  In fact, there is nothing more phony than musical biopics with actors miming to a dubbed soundtrack.  So, by way of legitimate performance, the film becomes stunningly on point.Can't imagine that any fan of the band Joy Division would want to pass this up.  The only negative thing I can offer is that the heavy accents made it hard to decipher the dialogue at times.  Also, the depiction of Ian's ""jump off,"" Annik Honore, rings rather superficial.  And she doesn't come off as a sympathetic character, being she broke up a family with a baby via the affair that she continues to deny.  Clearly, the story's told through Deborah's eyes.  Even still, the film, directed by Ian Curtis' friend and accomplished photographer, Anton Corbijn (who took iconic early photos of the band), makes a wonderful tribute to the memory of Ian Curtis and the band Joy Division.",5,Music and Misery in Beautiful Black and White,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,1949,"['Did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'being', 'casual', 'fan', 'Joy', 'Division', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'look', 'see', 'Wonderfully', 'cast', 'round', 'standouts', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Ian', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'respectively', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'practically', 'dead', 'ringer', 'especially', 'when', 'filmed', 'distance', 'Joy', 'Division', 'lead', 'singer', 'stature', 'body', 'frame', 'facial', 'structure', 'tell', 'tale', 'brown', 'eyes', 'record', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'most', 'striking', 'feature', 'was', 'almost', 'transparent', 'otherworldly', 'eyes.Anyone', 'who', 'story', 'Joy', 'Division', 'aware', 'tale', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spell', 'out', 'trajectory', 'doomed', 'start', 'so', 'course', 'effect', 'bogs', 'down', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'said', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'Deborah', 'Curtis', 'strikingly', 'true', 'life', 'fact', 'feels', 'cinema', 'verite', 'finest', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'own', 'singing', 'nothing', 'less', 'remarkable', 'evocation', 'suspected', 'band', 'members', 'played', 'own', 'instruments', 'too', 'fact', 'nothing', 'more', 'phony', 'musical', 'biopics', 'actors', 'miming', 'dubbed', 'soundtrack', 'So', 'way', 'legitimate', 'performance', 'film', 'stunningly', 'point.Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'fan', 'band', 'Joy', 'Division', 'would', 'want', 'pass', 'up', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'offer', 'heavy', 'accents', 'made', 'hard', 'decipher', 'dialogue', 'times', 'Also', 'depiction', 'Ian', 'jump', 'off', 'Annik', 'Honore', 'rather', 'superficial', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'being', 'broke', 'up', 'family', 'baby', 'affair', 'deny', 'Clearly', 'story', 'told', 'Deborah', 'eyes', 'Even', 'still', 'film', 'directed', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'friend', 'accomplished', 'photographer', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'who', 'took', 'iconic', 'early', 'photos', 'band', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'memory', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'band', 'Joy', 'Division']",Control
1123958,A24YVJWNLBU314,B00104AYGU,Trevor Seigler,"[1, 1]","The 2007 film ""Control"" chronicles the life and brief musical career of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's doomed frontman. An epileptic whose stage performances mirrored his seizures, Curtis was also entangled in complicated personal relationships that he could not navigate successfully. His death on May 18, 1980, gave birth to yet another legend of the rock star who lived fast, died young, and left behind a good-looking corpse.Anton Corbijn's film exposes that myth and reveals the human cost of Curtis' fatal choice. His young wife, Deborah, penned the book on which this film is based, and we first see Ian as a schoolboy in love with Bowie and all things rock and roll. He seduces Debbie away from a fellow student, proposes marriage, and sets up a home with her, all the while penning lyrics for the music career he strives to achieve.The film's major strength is in these early scenes, when it's established that Ian and Debbie have a connection early on. Because that connection will be tested and ultimately betrayed when Curtis goes on the road and meets Annik Honore, the ""other woman"" of Ian's life.The film also shows the visual appeal of the band, due to their stark fashion sense and energizing live performances. Sam Riley is more than just a lookalike for Curtis; he's a skilled interpretor of Curtis' stage mannerisms and voice. The bonus extended live performances on the DVD are awe-inspiring (one wishes that more than just three of the live performances had been included). But the film is more than just ""Joy Division: The Movie."" It tells the story of Ian's rapid decline even as he's on the brink of success. His condition forces pills and unnatural bedtimes for a rock star on him, and his life with Debbie becomes a series of brief moments between his return from a tour and her leaving for her job. The stark greys of the black-and-white cinematography reflect not just the accepted visual style of the band (as Corbijn states, the band was always thought of in black and white, due to the way they were photographed), but shows the bleakness of Curtis' worldview as he struggled with the demands of fame, fatherhood, marriage, and illness. By the end of the film, the audience is no longer sure that Curtis' death was pre-planned at the beginning of his fantasies to make it big (a charge that Debbie makes in her book). Instead, it seems like real life caught up to his romantic notions of early death and made it seem like he had no other choice.The film is a great companion to Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People,"" an altogether more cheerful affair which nonetheless had highlights in its section dealing with Joy Division. Corbijn's humor is not absent of humor, however, and there are moments which puncuate the grimness. If you know the story of Ian Curtis, you know how it turns out; but the moments that are amusing help to keep you interested in the film.The movie is fair to both women in Curtis' life, and he isn't portrayed as the typical groupie-crazed rock star. Debbie grows to realize that Ian is going away from her, and she has lost him long before she finds him hanging in their kitchen. Annik is not a gold-digger but a caring, sympathetic fan, and their relationship is considerably less tawdry than it could have been portrayed. For all his faults, Ian in the film comes across as profoundly human, and unable in all his twenty-three years to come to terms with all that the world is laying on his doorstep.I've been a huge Joy Division and New Order fan for ten years, and I always wondered if the story of Ian's life would ever get film treatment. Now it has, and the results are worth your time even if you're not a fan. As someone who lost a close friend to suicide last year, I know firsthand the grief that Curtis' friends and family must have felt in the aftermath of his death. This film goes a long way towards healing those wounds left over from a life cut far too short.",4,All my failings exposed,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,3939,"['2007', 'film', 'Control', 'life', 'brief', 'musical', 'career', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Joy', 'Division', 'doomed', 'frontman', 'epileptic', 'stage', 'performances', 'mirrored', 'seizures', 'Curtis', 'was', 'also', 'entangled', 'complicated', 'personal', 'relationships', 'could', 'not', 'navigate', 'successfully', 'death', 'May', '18', '1980', 'gave', 'birth', 'yet', 'legend', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'lived', 'fast', 'died', 'young', 'left', 'behind', 'good-looking', 'corpse.Anton', 'Corbijn', 'film', 'myth', 'human', 'cost', 'Curtis', 'fatal', 'choice', 'young', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'penned', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'first', 'see', 'Ian', 'schoolboy', 'love', 'Bowie', 'things', 'rock', 'roll', 'Debbie', 'away', 'fellow', 'student', 'marriage', 'up', 'home', 'while', 'penning', 'lyrics', 'music', 'career', 'achieve.The', 'film', 'major', 'strength', 'early', 'scenes', 'when', 'established', 'Ian', 'Debbie', 'have', 'connection', 'early', 'connection', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'ultimately', 'betrayed', 'when', 'Curtis', 'road', 'meets', 'Annik', 'Honore', 'other', 'woman', 'Ian', 'life.The', 'film', 'also', 'visual', 'appeal', 'band', 'due', 'stark', 'fashion', 'sense', 'energizing', 'live', 'performances', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'more', 'just', 'lookalike', 'Curtis', 'skilled', 'interpretor', 'Curtis', 'stage', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'bonus', 'extended', 'live', 'performances', 'DVD', 'are', 'awe-inspiring', 'one', 'more', 'just', 'three', 'live', 'performances', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Movie', 'story', 'Ian', 'rapid', 'decline', 'even', 'brink', 'success', 'condition', 'forces', 'pills', 'unnatural', 'bedtimes', 'rock', 'star', 'life', 'Debbie', 'series', 'brief', 'moments', 'return', 'tour', 'leaving', 'job', 'stark', 'greys', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'reflect', 'not', 'just', 'accepted', 'visual', 'style', 'band', 'Corbijn', 'states', 'band', 'was', 'always', 'thought', 'black', 'white', 'due', 'way', 'were', 'photographed', 'bleakness', 'Curtis', 'worldview', 'struggled', 'demands', 'fame', 'fatherhood', 'marriage', 'illness', 'end', 'film', 'audience', 'longer', 'sure', 'Curtis', 'death', 'was', 'pre-planned', 'beginning', 'fantasies', 'make', 'big', 'charge', 'Debbie', 'book', 'Instead', 'real', 'life', 'caught', 'up', 'romantic', 'notions', 'early', 'death', 'made', 'had', 'other', 'choice.The', 'film', 'great', 'companion', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'altogether', 'more', 'cheerful', 'affair', 'nonetheless', 'had', 'highlights', 'section', 'dealing', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Corbijn', 'humor', 'not', 'absent', 'humor', 'however', 'are', 'moments', 'puncuate', 'grimness', 'know', 'story', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'moments', 'are', 'amusing', 'help', 'keep', 'interested', 'film.The', 'movie', 'fair', 'women', 'Curtis', 'life', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'typical', 'groupie-crazed', 'rock', 'star', 'Debbie', 'realize', 'Ian', 'going', 'away', 'lost', 'long', 'hanging', 'kitchen', 'Annik', 'not', 'gold-digger', 'caring', 'sympathetic', 'fan', 'relationship', 'considerably', 'less', 'tawdry', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'faults', 'Ian', 'film', 'profoundly', 'human', 'unable', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'come', 'terms', 'world', 'laying', 'doorstep.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'Joy', 'Division', 'New', 'Order', 'fan', 'ten', 'years', 'always', 'wondered', 'story', 'Ian', 'life', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'film', 'treatment', 'Now', 'results', 'are', 'time', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'close', 'friend', 'suicide', 'last', 'year', 'know', 'firsthand', 'grief', 'Curtis', 'friends', 'family', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'aftermath', 'death', 'film', 'long', 'way', 'healing', 'wounds', 'left', 'over', 'life', 'cut', 'far', 'too', 'short']",Control
1123959,A1QIL7847ET6HX,B00104AYGU,xxgrendelxx,"[0, 0]","I'm a fan of Joy Division's music and have great respect for Ian Curtis as an artist and compassion for him as a man. But this film watches like some kid of Lifetime channel movie for the post punk set. It's episodic without much more emotional connection to the protagonists than merely portraying events and relationships that are now legendary - &#34;You've heard of this, here is this - you've heard of that, now here is that&#34;.The film is photographed about as artistically as one could manage but it never manages to eclipse the weak script. Perhaps it is the material itself: Curtis' life does not easily lend itself to making a good story, there are no lessons to be learned, no commentary on the human condition through it's main character. His problems are his alone. We are simply shown reenactments of events we've previously only read about and it isn't the kind of material that makes for great cinema, even if it does make for great television docudrama.If you already know the story, you will be delighted to see it played out - afterwards can put on your Joy Division records and soak up the pathos. If you have no idea how this ends, it is a terrible letdown and a real drag. It will appear pointless and from a strictly cinematic standpoint, it is - and that's a shame. Perhaps more of Ian's poetry strategically and artfully placed could have made a difference, given the story more teeth.Unfortunately, this is just a dark soap.",2,Weak and episodic.,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1452,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Joy', 'Division', 'music', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'artist', 'compassion', 'man', 'film', 'watches', 'kid', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'movie', 'post', 'punk', 'set', 'episodic', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection', 'protagonists', 'merely', 'portraying', 'events', 'relationships', 'are', 'now', 'legendary', '34', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'here', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'now', 'here', '34', '.The', 'film', 'photographed', 'as', 'artistically', 'one', 'could', 'manage', 'never', 'eclipse', 'weak', 'script', 'Perhaps', 'material', 'Curtis', 'life', 'not', 'easily', 'lend', 'making', 'good', 'story', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'commentary', 'human', 'condition', 'main', 'character', 'problems', 'are', 'alone', 'are', 'simply', 'shown', 'reenactments', 'events', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'only', 'read', ""n't"", 'kind', 'material', 'great', 'cinema', 'even', 'make', 'great', 'television', 'docudrama.If', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'afterwards', 'can', 'put', 'Joy', 'Division', 'records', 'soak', 'up', 'pathos', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'terrible', 'letdown', 'real', 'drag', 'will', 'appear', 'pointless', 'strictly', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'shame', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'Ian', 'poetry', 'strategically', 'artfully', 'placed', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'given', 'story', 'more', 'teeth.Unfortunately', 'just', 'dark', 'soap']",Control
