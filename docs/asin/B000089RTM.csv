736949,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B000089RTM,absent_minded_prof,"[10, 13]","""Kandahar"" is a collection of slightly fictionalized vignettes of Afghan life in the 1990s, loosely grouped together in a putative dramatic plot.  The ""plot,"" such as it is, has to do with a woman who had been born in Afghanistan, and had escaped to Canada some years previously.  For reasons of her own, she seeks to make her way to Kandahar, in Afghanistan, beginning from one of the refugee camps on the Afghan border with Iran.  On the way, she meets with several normal, regular, ordinary Afghan people, and learns about their normal, regular, everyday Afghan horrendous lives.  The reason to see this film is to see the people she meets.The plot is not very thoroughly developed, but that really doesn't matter, in my opinion.  It seems to me that far too many reviewers here are focusing on the wrong things.  In the commentary track, leading actress Nelofer Pazira talks about how she and the director chose to include various scenes, while filming, as they met various refugees in the camps.  They simply couldn't say no, to the opportunity of including these people's waking nightmares in the film.  The scenery is beautiful, in a stark way, and the plot is barely enough to keep a viewer dramatically involved, but the point is to learn about life in today's Afghanistan.Disease, drought, ubiquitous old land mines, staggering poverty, and, of course, radical Islamic fundamentalism, collude to make Taliban-era Afghanistan an absolutely horrendous environment.  Several scenes are likely to lodge in your memory for some time, such as the young boy stealing a ring from a skeleton; the relief airplane parachuting prosthetic legs through the sky, toward a camp; the madrasas school scenes, where young boys learn to hate and kill; and the ""doctor"" who is prohibited by Islamic law from closely examining his female patients.While viewing this, I personally found it helpful to keep all the various horrors organized, by paying attention to who Nafas' guide is, at any given moment.  She is guided by an old Afghan refugee, whose (fourth) wife she pretends to be; a student expelled from a militaristic, Muslim madrasa; an African-American ""doctor""; and a one-handed former thief.  Each guide raises various issues for Nafas.  If you try to sort out what is happening in terms of which guide Nafas is with, it can really help you out quite a bit.  I hope that you do this.Some people reading this review may have noticed that I have put the word ""doctor"" in quotes, twice.  This is because the ""doctor"" character in the film, based on a real person, is simply a regular, fairly well-educated man from the United States.  He has no actual medical training, but even an average guy on the street in the USA knows vastly more than illiterate Afghan refugees.  He is able to make a difference, and even save lives, simply by dispensing what we would consider to be common sense advise, e.g., don't drink polluted water; dress wounds with clean bandages, etc.If you find the ""doctor"" character to be in any way inspiring, (as I do), then you may wish to think about emulating him, without even standing up from your computer screen.  Three excellent ways that you can find ways to do this are by googling any of the following phrases: 1.) Initiative to Educate Afghan Women, 2.) Cameo Landmine Clearance, or 3.) Doctors Without Borders.The Taliban is gone, but the socio-cultural matrix which gave rise to its existence still flourishes in Afghanistan.  It will take a lot more than a few years to heal that wounded country.  If you would like to continue to educate yourself about that area, I recommend that you also look for the DVDs called ""Panj E Asr,"" ""Osama,"" and, for a little variety, ""Marooned in Iraq.""",4,A Descent into Dante-esque Night,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,3719,"['Kandahar', 'collection', 'slightly', 'fictionalized', 'vignettes', 'Afghan', 'life', '1990s', 'loosely', 'grouped', 'together', 'putative', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'plot', 'such', 'do', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'born', 'Afghanistan', 'had', 'escaped', 'Canada', 'years', 'previously', 'reasons', 'own', 'make', 'way', 'Kandahar', 'Afghanistan', 'beginning', 'one', 'refugee', 'camps', 'Afghan', 'border', 'Iran', 'way', 'several', 'normal', 'regular', 'ordinary', 'Afghan', 'people', 'normal', 'regular', 'everyday', 'Afghan', 'horrendous', 'lives', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'see', 'people', 'meets.The', 'plot', 'not', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'developed', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'opinion', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'are', 'focusing', 'wrong', 'things', 'commentary', 'track', 'leading', 'actress', 'Nelofer', 'Pazira', 'talks', 'how', 'director', 'chose', 'include', 'various', 'scenes', 'filming', 'met', 'various', 'refugees', 'camps', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'no', 'opportunity', 'including', 'people', 'waking', 'nightmares', 'film', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'stark', 'way', 'plot', 'barely', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'dramatically', 'involved', 'point', 'learn', 'life', 'today', 'Afghanistan.Disease', 'drought', 'ubiquitous', 'old', 'land', 'mines', 'staggering', 'poverty', 'course', 'radical', 'Islamic', 'fundamentalism', 'collude', 'make', 'Taliban-era', 'Afghanistan', 'absolutely', 'horrendous', 'environment', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'likely', 'lodge', 'memory', 'time', 'such', 'young', 'boy', 'stealing', 'ring', 'skeleton', 'relief', 'airplane', 'parachuting', 'prosthetic', 'legs', 'sky', 'camp', 'madrasas', 'school', 'scenes', 'where', 'young', 'boys', 'learn', 'hate', 'kill', 'doctor', 'who', 'prohibited', 'Islamic', 'law', 'closely', 'examining', 'female', 'patients.While', 'viewing', 'personally', 'found', 'helpful', 'keep', 'various', 'horrors', 'organized', 'paying', 'attention', 'who', 'Nafas', 'guide', 'given', 'moment', 'guided', 'old', 'Afghan', 'refugee', 'fourth', 'wife', 'be', 'student', 'expelled', 'militaristic', 'Muslim', 'madrasa', 'African-American', 'doctor', 'one-handed', 'former', 'thief', 'guide', 'various', 'issues', 'Nafas', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'terms', 'guide', 'Nafas', 'can', 'really', 'help', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'hope', 'do', 'this.Some', 'people', 'reading', 'review', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'have', 'put', 'word', 'doctor', 'quotes', 'twice', 'doctor', 'character', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'simply', 'regular', 'fairly', 'well-educated', 'man', 'United', 'States', 'actual', 'medical', 'training', 'even', 'average', 'guy', 'street', 'USA', 'vastly', 'more', 'illiterate', 'Afghan', 'refugees', 'able', 'make', 'difference', 'even', 'save', 'lives', 'simply', 'dispensing', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'common', 'sense', 'advise', 'e.g.', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'polluted', 'water', 'wounds', 'clean', 'bandages', 'etc.If', 'find', 'doctor', 'character', 'be', 'way', 'inspiring', 'do', 'then', 'may', 'wish', 'think', 'emulating', 'even', 'standing', 'up', 'computer', 'screen', 'Three', 'excellent', 'ways', 'can', 'find', 'ways', 'do', 'are', 'googling', 'following', 'phrases', '1', 'Initiative', 'Educate', 'Afghan', 'Women', '2', 'Cameo', 'Landmine', 'Clearance', '3', 'Doctors', 'Borders.The', 'Taliban', 'gone', 'socio-cultural', 'matrix', 'gave', 'rise', 'existence', 'still', 'Afghanistan', 'will', 'take', 'lot', 'more', 'few', 'years', 'heal', 'wounded', 'country', 'would', 'like', 'continue', 'educate', 'area', 'recommend', 'also', 'look', 'DVDs', 'called', 'Panj', 'E', 'Asr', 'Osama', 'little', 'variety', 'Marooned', 'Iraq']",N/A

Oliveira""","[20, 21]","When ""Kandahar"" was shown in Cannes in May/01, it was another film from an exotique country with exotique culture and traditions. Now, after September 11th, it all comes down to be a movie about a place where everybody is watching closely.  I have to admit that I was most interested in this movie because it takes palce in that region, but after watching it, I changed my opinion.It is the story of an Afghan journalist, Nafas,-- who now lives in Canada - and receives a letter from her sister telling she'll commit suicide during the last eclipse of the XX Century. Then Nafas decides to fly back to her country in order to try to convince her sister not to kill herself. But before reaching her, the journalist has much more trouble in arriving in Kandahar. The film shows her journey and all people she meets through it and the problems she runs up against when in the way to Kandahar . In the background we see many costumes of this region and how living with terrosrism in everyday life is. And the beauty of this exotique land - I have to bring up that the film opens with an extremely beautiful image of an eclipse.I usually have some difficult in undersand Iranian films at the first time I see them. Maybe it's because it's a very different culture with different values, but it doesn't mean I don't like them. This ""Kandahar"" was an exception. I really appreciated very much only watching it once -- I'll probably watch it again soon. You may feel amazed with the settings and the lighting, but what counts more here is the reality of these people. It's touching seeing children been taught no to touch dolls and teddy bears the find on the floor because these toys may carry mine and seriously hurt these children.  Moreover, the film made take a different look into my life itself. I mean I have problems --  as everybody does -- , but they are so small when compared with those people's problems. Some of them have to wait up to one to receive a pair of rough legs because they have lost their own in a mining field.All in all, the end is very touching -- I won't give it to you --, and the very last lines resonated in my mind for hours. Although Nafas journey is to save her sister, it becomes a way of her own rendemption and discover. Kudos to the director Mohsen Makhmakbaf and to the actress Nelofer Pazira, who had lived a very similar situation which inspired the movie.",5,All The Way To Kandahar,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,2392,"['When', 'Kandahar', 'was', 'shown', 'Cannes', 'May/01', 'was', 'film', 'exotique', 'country', 'exotique', 'culture', 'traditions', 'Now', 'September', '11th', 'down', 'be', 'movie', 'place', 'where', 'everybody', 'watching', 'closely', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'most', 'interested', 'movie', 'palce', 'region', 'watching', 'changed', 'opinion.It', 'story', 'Afghan', 'journalist', 'Nafas', 'who', 'now', 'Canada', 'letter', 'sister', 'telling', ""'ll"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'last', 'eclipse', 'XX', 'Century', 'Then', 'Nafas', 'fly', 'back', 'country', 'order', 'try', 'convince', 'sister', 'not', 'kill', 'reaching', 'journalist', 'much', 'more', 'trouble', 'arriving', 'Kandahar', 'film', 'journey', 'people', 'problems', 'up', 'when', 'way', 'Kandahar', 'background', 'see', 'many', 'costumes', 'region', 'how', 'living', 'terrosrism', 'everyday', 'life', 'beauty', 'exotique', 'land', 'have', 'bring', 'up', 'film', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'image', 'eclipse.I', 'usually', 'have', 'difficult', 'undersand', 'Iranian', 'films', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Maybe', 'very', 'different', 'culture', 'different', 'values', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kandahar', 'was', 'exception', 'really', 'appreciated', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'watching', 'once', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'soon', 'may', 'feel', 'amazed', 'settings', 'lighting', 'what', 'more', 'here', 'reality', 'people', 'touching', 'seeing', 'children', 'been', 'taught', 'touch', 'dolls', 'teddy', 'bears', 'find', 'floor', 'toys', 'may', 'carry', 'mine', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'children', 'Moreover', 'film', 'made', 'take', 'different', 'look', 'life', 'mean', 'have', 'problems', 'everybody', 'are', 'so', 'small', 'when', 'compared', 'people', 'problems', 'have', 'wait', 'up', 'one', 'receive', 'pair', 'rough', 'legs', 'have', 'lost', 'own', 'mining', 'field.All', 'end', 'very', 'touching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'last', 'lines', 'resonated', 'mind', 'hours', 'Nafas', 'journey', 'save', 'sister', 'way', 'own', 'rendemption', 'discover', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Mohsen', 'Makhmakbaf', 'actress', 'Nelofer', 'Pazira', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'very', 'similar', 'situation', 'inspired', 'movie']",N/A

I remember the long lines at the Museum of Fine Arts here in Houston, when the film was screened.Obviously, this film has its fans, as evidenced by the glowing reviews on Amazon.  I personally found it to be a sham.  For starters, it is filmed documentary-style, but the plot is heavily scripted.  I'm not saying this concept is flawed; it works in The Story of the Weeping Camel.  But, in a film that deals with such serious topics as famine and land mines, it feels wholly out of place.  Also, the English-language dialogue suffers from flat delivery.  The protagonist seems phony; every potentially poignant moment is ruined by her deadpan method of speaking.Visually, the film is stunning at times, especially when you see the wedding party march in the desert.  The sea of burqas in contrasting colors (such as emerald, black, ochre yellow, peach, white, purple, etc.) is absolutely stunning.  But the quality of the cinematography is not enough to rescue the flawed direction.I imagine that the throngs of curious people who clamored to see the film left the cinema somewhat disappointed.

736953,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000089RTM,Christopher Culver,"[4, 4]","Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film KANDAHAR was shot a couple of years before the US invasion of Afghanistan and documents the appalling state of the country in the aftermath of the Russian invasion, subsequent civil war and the rise of Taliban. The film opens on the Iran-Afghan border, where we meet Nafas (Nelofer Pazira), an Afghan refugee in Canada. Nafas is drawn back to her homeland after receiving a letter from her sister, who didn't make it out of this failed state and plans to kill herself at the last solar eclipse of the 20th century. Nafas has only two days to reach her sister and convince her that life is worth living, but the poverty and desperation of Afghanistan raises up several obstacles.The strong point of KANDAHAR, what makes this film worth seeing, is the emotional force of its depiction of Afghanistan. There are outdoor shots here that will haunt you for long afterward: a group of amputees racing each other on their crutches to seize a pair of artificial legs that the Red Cross parachuted in; a wedding procession consisting of women who sing joyfully as they walk over desert sands, visible only as burkas of every colour. This is certainly a hell on Earth that needed international intervention on a scale larger than idealistic but powerless charity workers, so I don't rue the US invasion, though I am angry that the occupation has been handled with so little regard so the people we were supposedly there to liberate.In spite of the memorable nature of KANDAHAR, however, it's not very good according to some qualities one normally judges a film by. The acting by the main roles is godawful, with Nafas, the American doctor and the Australian nurse delivering their lines as if they recall them only with effort, or are reading them off cue cards. The plot, that is, the personal drama of the protagonist as opposed to the saga of Afghanistan's pain, is also weak. Storytelling seems to take a back seat to a didactic purpose. So I'm put in the awkward position of recommending this film to everyone as a must-see, but unable to award it more than three stars.",3,"Worth seeing, but although it is perhaps more compelling than a straight-up documentary, it's not that great a story",1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2090,"['Mohsen', 'Makhmalbaf', 'film', 'KANDAHAR', 'was', 'shot', 'couple', 'years', 'US', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'documents', 'appalling', 'state', 'country', 'aftermath', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'subsequent', 'civil', 'war', 'rise', 'Taliban', 'film', 'Iran-Afghan', 'border', 'where', 'meet', 'Nafas', 'Nelofer', 'Pazira', 'Afghan', 'refugee', 'Canada', 'Nafas', 'drawn', 'back', 'homeland', 'receiving', 'letter', 'sister', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'failed', 'state', 'plans', 'kill', 'last', 'solar', 'eclipse', '20th', 'century', 'Nafas', 'only', 'two', 'days', 'reach', 'sister', 'convince', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'poverty', 'desperation', 'Afghanistan', 'up', 'several', 'obstacles.The', 'strong', 'point', 'KANDAHAR', 'what', 'film', 'seeing', 'emotional', 'force', 'depiction', 'Afghanistan', 'are', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'here', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'afterward', 'group', 'amputees', 'racing', 'other', 'crutches', 'seize', 'pair', 'artificial', 'legs', 'Red', 'Cross', 'parachuted', 'wedding', 'procession', 'consisting', 'women', 'who', 'sing', 'joyfully', 'walk', 'desert', 'sands', 'visible', 'only', 'burkas', 'colour', 'certainly', 'hell', 'Earth', 'needed', 'international', 'intervention', 'scale', 'larger', 'idealistic', 'powerless', 'charity', 'workers', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'rue', 'US', 'invasion', 'am', 'angry', 'occupation', 'been', 'handled', 'so', 'little', 'regard', 'people', 'were', 'supposedly', 'there', 'liberate.In', 'spite', 'memorable', 'nature', 'KANDAHAR', 'however', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'according', 'qualities', 'one', 'normally', 'judges', 'film', 'acting', 'main', 'roles', 'godawful', 'Nafas', 'American', 'doctor', 'Australian', 'nurse', 'delivering', 'lines', 'recall', 'only', 'effort', 'are', 'reading', 'off', 'cue', 'cards', 'plot', 'personal', 'drama', 'protagonist', 'opposed', 'saga', 'Afghanistan', 'pain', 'also', 'weak', 'Storytelling', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'didactic', 'purpose', ""'m"", 'put', 'awkward', 'position', 'recommending', 'film', 'everyone', 'must-see', 'unable', 'award', 'more', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

With this film, however, he decided to step away from his usual style of powerful character development, beautiful photography, and an interesting way of integrating  the universal qualities of human culture with the particular world view of modern Iran.""Kandahar"" disappoints on many different levels.  The character development is so poor that it is hard to empathize with much of what is going on on screen.  A lot of this has to do with the screenwriting, which is simply awful.  A good example of how bad this script is can be heard in the speech that the black American doctor gives into the reporter's recorder.  Depth is attempted, but only pseudo-gravitas is achieved.  Also, the acting is inexplicably, inexcusably, and often hilariously atrocious.  Amateur casts can be excellent and convincing, as they have been in films by Makhmalbaf and Majidi before, but in Kandahar, it is so bad as to be a distraction, and only serves to point up the defincies in character development and the inanity of the dialogue.This film is also much praised for the beauty of its scenery, but it is not a National Geographic Special, it is a feature film that introduces a plot, introduces characters, and ostensibly seeks to develop them.  The scenery certainly is nice, but it doesn't make up for the dramatic failure of the film, and honestly, the production values in this film are average if not a little below average.  And when you finally get right down to it, it is not much of an achievement to point a camera at a mountain or a desert in Eastern Iran or Western Afghanistan. It is just unfamiliar to most viewers (or at least it was before the fall of the Taliban), and that seems to make the scenery more special than it really is.  I suppose a case could be made for the harsh terrain reflecting the harsh life under the Taliban, but that is hardly a new idea in film making, and the amount of time that this film spends lingering over the mountains and deserts of Central Asia really does absolutely nothing for a film that is just begging to be developed. Also, fanciful images in the film such as the oft-mentioned prosthetic legs flying out of the airplane, or a young Afghani pulling the ring off of a skeleton seem pretentious  in the context of such a thin plot and lack of fundamental dramatic development.In this film Makhmalbaf tried something new, and he simply failed.  Luckily for him, the film became instantly relevant due to the 9/11 attacks, and it received far more praise than it should have.  I liken the critical response to this film to that of ""A Time for Drunken Horses"", a better film than ""Kandahar"", but one that also gets more recognition for WHAT it is, than what it achieves as a work of cinematic art.",1,An Unsatisfying Film on a Timely Topic,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,2953,"['can', 'say', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'clunker.Mohsen', 'Makhmalbaf', 'thoroughly', 'mature', 'highly', 'competent', 'film', 'maker', 'Majid', 'Majidi', 'real', 'innovator', 'world', 'contemporary', 'Iranian', 'film', 'film', 'however', 'decided', 'step', 'away', 'usual', 'style', 'powerful', 'character', 'development', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'interesting', 'way', 'integrating', 'universal', 'qualities', 'human', 'culture', 'particular', 'world', 'view', 'modern', 'Iran', 'Kandahar', 'disappoints', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'poor', 'hard', 'empathize', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'screen', 'lot', 'do', 'screenwriting', 'simply', 'awful', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'bad', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'speech', 'black', 'American', 'doctor', 'reporter', 'recorder', 'Depth', 'attempted', 'only', 'pseudo-gravitas', 'achieved', 'Also', 'acting', 'inexplicably', 'inexcusably', 'often', 'hilariously', 'atrocious', 'Amateur', 'casts', 'can', 'be', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'Makhmalbaf', 'Majidi', 'Kandahar', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'distraction', 'only', 'point', 'up', 'defincies', 'character', 'development', 'inanity', 'dialogue.This', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'praised', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'not', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Special', 'feature', 'film', 'plot', 'characters', 'ostensibly', 'develop', 'scenery', 'certainly', 'nice', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'dramatic', 'failure', 'film', 'honestly', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'average', 'not', 'little', 'below', 'average', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'not', 'much', 'achievement', 'point', 'camera', 'mountain', 'desert', 'Eastern', 'Iran', 'Western', 'Afghanistan', 'just', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'viewers', 'least', 'was', 'fall', 'Taliban', 'make', 'scenery', 'more', 'special', 'really', 'suppose', 'case', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'harsh', 'terrain', 'reflecting', 'harsh', 'life', 'Taliban', 'hardly', 'new', 'idea', 'film', 'making', 'amount', 'time', 'film', 'lingering', 'mountains', 'deserts', 'Central', 'Asia', 'really', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'developed', 'Also', 'fanciful', 'images', 'film', 'such', 'oft-mentioned', 'prosthetic', 'legs', 'flying', 'airplane', 'young', 'Afghani', 'pulling', 'ring', 'off', 'skeleton', 'seem', 'pretentious', 'context', 'such', 'thin', 'plot', 'lack', 'fundamental', 'dramatic', 'development.In', 'film', 'Makhmalbaf', 'tried', 'something', 'new', 'simply', 'failed', 'Luckily', 'film', 'became', 'instantly', 'relevant', 'due', '9/11', 'attacks', 'received', 'far', 'more', 'praise', 'should', 'have', 'liken', 'critical', 'response', 'film', 'A', 'Time', 'Drunken', 'Horses', 'better', 'film', 'Kandahar', 'one', 'also', 'more', 'recognition', 'WHAT', 'what', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art']",N/A

While it suceeds at presenting some memorable and poignant scenes and realities, it ends up failing to captivate the viewer into the story of the protagonist.The central plot is about a canadian young woman who travels to Afghanistan in order to rescue her sister from Kandahar. As her journey gets along, the viewer is presented to some peculiar and remarkable situations in a documentary-style way. This semi-documentary-feel is useful at parts, yet it somehow manages to keep the viewer distant from the movie`s characters (who don`t seem all that gripping or interesting, since they never develop much).The acting is wildly uneven and the direction is competent, but relies more in the exotic natural landscapes than in director`s Mohsen Makhmalbaf camera tricks. The pacing is also inconsistent, delivering some slow and dull moments that lead to nowhere. And, yes, the ending could have been more compelling too.Overall, &quot;Kandahar&quot; is a mildly interesting film, relying more on its relevant subject matter than in the plot`s disjointed execution and flow.An important effort worth watching, still average as a movie.",2,Meaningful But Flawed,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1282,"['quot', 'Kandahar', 'quot', 'tries', 'showcase', 'Afghanistan', 's', 'current', 'scenario', 'particularly', 'woman', 's', 'condition', 'tight', 'control', 'country', 's', 'system', 'presenting', 'memorable', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'realities', 'up', 'failing', 'captivate', 'viewer', 'story', 'protagonist.The', 'central', 'plot', 'canadian', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Afghanistan', 'order', 'rescue', 'sister', 'Kandahar', 'journey', 'along', 'viewer', 'presented', 'peculiar', 'remarkable', 'situations', 'documentary-style', 'way', 'semi-documentary-feel', 'useful', 'parts', 'somehow', 'keep', 'viewer', 'distant', 'movie', 's', 'characters', 'who', 'don', 't', 'seem', 'gripping', 'interesting', 'never', 'develop', 'much', '.The', 'acting', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'direction', 'competent', 'more', 'exotic', 'natural', 'landscapes', 'director', 's', 'Mohsen', 'Makhmalbaf', 'camera', 'tricks', 'pacing', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'delivering', 'slow', 'dull', 'moments', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'yes', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'compelling', 'too.Overall', 'quot', 'Kandahar', 'quot', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'film', 'relying', 'more', 'relevant', 'subject', 'matter', 'plot', 's', 'disjointed', 'execution', 'flow.An', 'important', 'effort', 'worth', 'watching', 'still', 'average', 'movie']",N/A

736957,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000089RTM,Joseph Haschka,"[5, 6]","An Iranian film produced before the American invasion of Afghanistan, KANDAHAR isn't so much a feature film with a contiguous story as a series of 1-act plays that portray the harshness of life for women, and life in general, under Taliban rule.Nafas (Nelofer Pazira) is a young woman of Afghani birth who emigrated as a child with her family to Canada. Her sister, who had lost both legs to a land mine, was left behind. Nafas has learned that her sister is planning to commit suicide coincident with the final solar eclipse of the twentieth century. As the film begins, Nafas is being ferried by helicopter to an Afghani refugee camp in Iran. From there, she hopes to smuggle herself across the border to KANDAHAR, where her sister lives, and persuade her to go on living.Both the beginning and end of the film are minimalist. Instead, the viewer is witness to a series of vignettes, some almost surreal, that reflect the dismal state of the country. Of course, during her journey, Nafas wears a burkha, that head to foot drape that women must wear in public and which relegates them to the status of non-entities.Two sequences are particularly evocative of the film's message. When Nafas becomes ill and seeks help, the male caregiver is limited by law to examining his patient's mouth and eyes through a small hole cut in a sheet barrier while asking questions via a child intermediary. And later, as a Red Cross helicopter drops prosthetic legs by parachute into a desert aid station set up to help civilians maimed by landmines, we watch a dozen or so amputees desperately scrambling on their crutches to reach the drop zone. Indeed, the prosthetics are so much in demand that a scam artist, seeking to acquire them as a goods for future enrichment, is shown bedeviling foreign medical workers.Pazira's Nafas is attractive, and the dehumanizing effect of the burkha is striking on those occasions when she must unveil.KANDAHAR is presented in a pseudo-documentary style. Unfortunately, while the individual sequences are hard-hitting and revealing, the lack of a unifying story, and especially the absence of substantive ending, doesn't make for a completely satisfying film. The viewers' sympathies may perhaps remain detached.",3,Burkha,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,2234,"['Iranian', 'film', 'produced', 'American', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'KANDAHAR', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'feature', 'film', 'contiguous', 'story', 'series', '1-act', 'plays', 'portray', 'harshness', 'life', 'women', 'life', 'general', 'Taliban', 'rule.Nafas', 'Nelofer', 'Pazira', 'young', 'woman', 'Afghani', 'birth', 'who', 'emigrated', 'child', 'family', 'Canada', 'sister', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'legs', 'land', 'mine', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'Nafas', 'learned', 'sister', 'planning', 'commit', 'suicide', 'coincident', 'final', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'twentieth', 'century', 'film', 'Nafas', 'being', 'ferried', 'helicopter', 'Afghani', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Iran', 'there', 'smuggle', 'border', 'KANDAHAR', 'where', 'sister', 'lives', 'persuade', 'go', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'minimalist', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'witness', 'series', 'vignettes', 'almost', 'surreal', 'reflect', 'dismal', 'state', 'country', 'course', 'journey', 'Nafas', 'burkha', 'head', 'foot', 'drape', 'women', 'must', 'wear', 'public', 'status', 'non-entities.Two', 'sequences', 'are', 'particularly', 'evocative', 'film', 'message', 'When', 'Nafas', 'ill', 'help', 'male', 'caregiver', 'limited', 'law', 'examining', 'patient', 'mouth', 'eyes', 'small', 'hole', 'cut', 'sheet', 'barrier', 'asking', 'questions', 'child', 'intermediary', 'later', 'Red', 'Cross', 'helicopter', 'drops', 'prosthetic', 'legs', 'parachute', 'desert', 'aid', 'station', 'set', 'up', 'help', 'civilians', 'maimed', 'landmines', 'watch', 'dozen', 'so', 'amputees', 'desperately', 'scrambling', 'crutches', 'reach', 'drop', 'zone', 'Indeed', 'prosthetics', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'demand', 'scam', 'artist', 'seeking', 'acquire', 'goods', 'future', 'enrichment', 'shown', 'bedeviling', 'foreign', 'medical', 'workers.Pazira', 'Nafas', 'attractive', 'dehumanizing', 'effect', 'burkha', 'striking', 'occasions', 'when', 'must', 'unveil.KANDAHAR', 'presented', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'Unfortunately', 'individual', 'sequences', 'are', 'hard-hitting', 'revealing', 'lack', 'unifying', 'story', 'especially', 'absence', 'substantive', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'film', 'viewers', 'sympathies', 'may', 'perhaps', 'remain', 'detached']",N/A

During her arduous trek through the war-torn wastes, Nafas encounters four distinct guides, each representing a different atrocity plaguing modern day Afghanistan: a defeated Afghan refugee; a fatherless young boy expelled from an Islamic religious school; an African-American militant turned healer; and a one-handed thief who claims to be the victim of a landmine accident. These encounters turn out to be the most structurally sound elements of an otherwise disjointed and unsatisfying narrative. The story is based on journalist Pazira's own unsuccessful attempt to reach a friend in Afghanistan after the Taliban took power. But the film is considerably less successful as a fictional odyssey through a harsh and hostile environment than it is as an exploration of modern war-ravaged Afghanistan. Substituting Iranian for Afghanistan desertscapes, director of photography Ebrahim Ghafouri captures stunning and indelible images, the most impressive coming when a group of legless men race on crutches to retrieve parachuting artificial legs dropped from a Red Cross helicopter. But director Makhmalbaf's lack of closure regarding the plot is frustrating -- we never learn whether Nafas ever reaches Kandahar and saves her sister. If the entire point is -- contrived from information gleaned via the closing frame -- that all of Afghanistan has been under an eclipse since the Taliban arrived, fine. But it needs clearer delineation to have the necessary punch so that audiences don't have to be left guessing as to what the ultimate point of the movie is, other than one of oppressed futility. The film runs a scant 85 minutes, so this was obviously an intentional decision, perhaps meant to reflect the ambiguity of international press regarding the conditions within Afghanistan (pre-September 11th). Yet Kandahar isn't a documentary, it's a feature film by one of Iran's foremost directors, and as such one would have hoped that the staging and acting were up to Makhmalbaf's usual standards. Sadly, the murky conclusion hampers an otherwise fascinating and utterly disquieting look at a place alien to many Westerners who up until recently couldn't have cared less about its people or politics.",3,Kandahar,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,2492,"['Set', 'Taliban-ruled', 'Afghanistan', 'Kandahar', 'quest', 'Nafas', 'Niloufar', 'Pazira', 'illegally', 'reenter', 'country', 'three', 'days', 'sister', 'legs', 'were', 'blown', 'off', 'landmine', 'years', 'earlier', 'can', 'carry', 'out', 'intended', 'suicide', 'last', 'eclipse', '20th', 'century', 'arduous', 'trek', 'war-torn', 'wastes', 'Nafas', 'four', 'distinct', 'guides', 'representing', 'different', 'atrocity', 'plaguing', 'modern', 'day', 'Afghanistan', 'defeated', 'Afghan', 'refugee', 'fatherless', 'young', 'boy', 'expelled', 'Islamic', 'religious', 'school', 'African-American', 'militant', 'turned', 'healer', 'one-handed', 'thief', 'who', 'be', 'victim', 'landmine', 'accident', 'encounters', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'structurally', 'sound', 'elements', 'otherwise', 'disjointed', 'unsatisfying', 'narrative', 'story', 'based', 'journalist', 'Pazira', 'own', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'reach', 'friend', 'Afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'took', 'power', 'film', 'considerably', 'less', 'successful', 'fictional', 'odyssey', 'harsh', 'hostile', 'environment', 'exploration', 'modern', 'war-ravaged', 'Afghanistan', 'Substituting', 'Iranian', 'Afghanistan', 'desertscapes', 'director', 'photography', 'Ebrahim', 'Ghafouri', 'stunning', 'indelible', 'images', 'most', 'impressive', 'coming', 'when', 'group', 'legless', 'men', 'race', 'crutches', 'retrieve', 'parachuting', 'artificial', 'legs', 'dropped', 'Red', 'Cross', 'helicopter', 'director', 'Makhmalbaf', 'lack', 'closure', 'regarding', 'plot', 'frustrating', 'never', 'learn', 'Nafas', 'ever', 'Kandahar', 'sister', 'entire', 'point', 'contrived', 'information', 'gleaned', 'closing', 'frame', 'Afghanistan', 'been', 'eclipse', 'Taliban', 'arrived', 'fine', 'clearer', 'delineation', 'have', 'necessary', 'punch', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'left', 'guessing', 'what', 'ultimate', 'point', 'movie', 'other', 'one', 'oppressed', 'futility', 'film', 'scant', '85', 'minutes', 'was', 'obviously', 'intentional', 'decision', 'perhaps', 'meant', 'reflect', 'ambiguity', 'international', 'press', 'regarding', 'conditions', 'Afghanistan', 'pre-September', '11th', 'Kandahar', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'feature', 'film', 'one', 'Iran', 'foremost', 'directors', 'such', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'staging', 'acting', 'were', 'up', 'Makhmalbaf', 'usual', 'standards', 'Sadly', 'murky', 'conclusion', 'hampers', 'otherwise', 'fascinating', 'utterly', 'disquieting', 'look', 'place', 'alien', 'many', 'Westerners', 'who', 'up', 'recently', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'people', 'politics']",N/A

Her journey takes her into Afghanistan and the city of Kandahar during the Taliban rule.  Her reason to get to Kandahar is to save her sister who has communicated that she intends to commit suicide during the next solar eclipse.  Her sister could not escape with the family to Canada, since she lost her legs to a landmine in their attempt to escape the country.  Now Nafas wants to get back to Afghanistan and save her sister; however, on the road to Kandahar she faces the true rule of the Taliban and understands the misfortune of the people and her sister in Afghanistan.  Kandahar is an exceptionally personal film in many aspects.  For example, Nafas is constantly defenseless, since she must put her trust into people she does not know, and this builds up a strong connection between Nafas and the audience.  In addition, many scenes cause the audience to ponder why Nafas's sister would consider suicide.

736961,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000089RTM,Lawyeraau,"[22, 24]","This is an intriguing film by renowned Iranian director Mosen Makhmalbaf. It is a brief, fascinating peek at Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. Filmed before the September 11, 2001 attack on the World trade Center took place, it offers a tantalizing glimpse into a country in which few of us can imagine living.The premise of the film revolves around an Afghani woman named Nafas (Niloufar Pazira), who has emigrated to Canada but finds herself returning years later to her homeland after her sister, who had remained behind in Afghanistan, writes her a letter announcing her intention to end her life at the time of the next solar eclipse.In the film, Nafas is journeying to her sister in Kandahar. She finds her country, a mosaic of ethnic and linguistic communities,  totally devastated by two decades of war. It is through her eyes that the viewer sees the extreme views that have overrun her country.  It is through her eyes that the viewer sees the tragedy that is Afghanistan.The viewer sees that education is firmly in the hands of the Mullahs, the local religious leaders who practice and instruct young boys in a strict fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.  It is an ideology that is interwoven with a chilling militancy. Despite the extreme views propounded by the Mullahs, mothers struggle to get their boys in these schools, so as to be assured that their sons will get your basic three hots and a cot in this land of famine.Moreover, the issue of the role of women under such a repressive regime is also looked at. The viewer sees how the women are treated, denied an education,  and referred to in collective, pejorative terms (black heads), due to the burkhas they are forced to wear, at all times. The viewer also sees the devastation that war has brought to this country in terms of land mines and consequent maimings. The results of famine and poor health care are also apparent throughout the course of this film.As a story, the film promises but, ultimately, fails to deliver a very satisfactory ending. Metaphorically, however, it delivers. Just as her sister's end is near, the end of Afghanistan under this repressive Taliban regime is also near. The film is positively prophetic, when viewed in a metaphoric light.Though the story line is left to drift as a backdrop for the bigger picture story alluded to through the stunning cinematography, the film still manages to succeed. The film, shot entirely in natural light due to the lack of electricity on location, is vivid with its imagery of a culture and lifestyle so alien to those of us living with and surrounded by creature comforts.The beautiful Niloufar Pazira, who is not a professional actress but, rather, an Afghani born journalist living in Canada, is wonderful as Nafas. The cast of unknown locals contribute to the vitality of this film, which is a must see for those who are interested in other cultures or in the human condition. Filmed on the Iran-Afghanistan border, the film is based in part on a similar journey  to Kabul that Niloufar Pazira had herself earlier attempted  in response to a letter from a despondent childhood friend. That journey was never completed due to the danger inherent in such a trip.The DVD offers superlative visuals and a crystal clear audio but has only a few limited bonus options or special features. It contains an interesting featurette entitled, &quot;Lifting the Veil&quot;, which is a documentary that centers around Ms. Pazira. It tells the viewer about her extraordinary life and how it came about that  this film was made.There is also a film commentary by Ms. Pazira. What is interesting about the commentary is that it is not from a director's perspective. The commentary is from a very personal perspective and details what is meant to be conveyed by this film. Those who listen to the commentary will know that the film is about much more than its basic story line about Nafas finding her sister.  The film is about Afghanistan.",4,ALL ROADS LEAD TO...,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,3973,"['intriguing', 'film', 'renowned', 'Iranian', 'director', 'Mosen', 'Makhmalbaf', 'brief', 'fascinating', 'peek', 'Afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'Filmed', 'September', '11', '2001', 'attack', 'World', 'trade', 'Center', 'took', 'place', 'tantalizing', 'glimpse', 'country', 'few', 'can', 'imagine', 'living.The', 'premise', 'film', 'Afghani', 'woman', 'named', 'Nafas', 'Niloufar', 'Pazira', 'who', 'emigrated', 'Canada', 'returning', 'years', 'later', 'homeland', 'sister', 'who', 'had', 'remained', 'Afghanistan', 'letter', 'announcing', 'intention', 'end', 'life', 'time', 'next', 'solar', 'eclipse.In', 'film', 'Nafas', 'journeying', 'sister', 'Kandahar', 'country', 'mosaic', 'ethnic', 'linguistic', 'communities', 'totally', 'devastated', 'two', 'decades', 'war', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'extreme', 'views', 'have', 'overrun', 'country', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'tragedy', 'Afghanistan.The', 'viewer', 'education', 'firmly', 'hands', 'Mullahs', 'local', 'religious', 'leaders', 'who', 'practice', 'instruct', 'young', 'boys', 'strict', 'fundamentalist', 'interpretation', 'Islam', 'ideology', 'interwoven', 'chilling', 'militancy', 'extreme', 'views', 'propounded', 'Mullahs', 'mothers', 'struggle', 'get', 'boys', 'schools', 'so', 'be', 'assured', 'sons', 'will', 'get', 'basic', 'three', 'hots', 'cot', 'land', 'famine.Moreover', 'issue', 'role', 'women', 'repressive', 'regime', 'also', 'looked', 'viewer', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'denied', 'education', 'referred', 'collective', 'pejorative', 'terms', 'black', 'heads', 'due', 'burkhas', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'times', 'viewer', 'also', 'devastation', 'war', 'brought', 'country', 'terms', 'land', 'mines', 'consequent', 'maimings', 'results', 'famine', 'poor', 'health', 'care', 'are', 'also', 'apparent', 'course', 'film.As', 'story', 'film', 'promises', 'ultimately', 'fails', 'deliver', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'Metaphorically', 'however', 'Just', 'sister', 'end', 'end', 'Afghanistan', 'repressive', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'also', 'near', 'film', 'positively', 'prophetic', 'when', 'viewed', 'metaphoric', 'story', 'line', 'left', 'drift', 'backdrop', 'bigger', 'picture', 'story', 'alluded', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'film', 'still', 'succeed', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'natural', 'light', 'due', 'lack', 'electricity', 'location', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'culture', 'lifestyle', 'so', 'alien', 'living', 'surrounded', 'creature', 'comforts.The', 'beautiful', 'Niloufar', 'Pazira', 'who', 'not', 'professional', 'actress', 'rather', 'Afghani', 'born', 'journalist', 'living', 'Canada', 'wonderful', 'Nafas', 'cast', 'unknown', 'locals', 'contribute', 'vitality', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'cultures', 'human', 'condition', 'Filmed', 'Iran-Afghanistan', 'border', 'film', 'based', 'part', 'similar', 'journey', 'Kabul', 'Niloufar', 'Pazira', 'had', 'herself', 'earlier', 'attempted', 'response', 'letter', 'despondent', 'childhood', 'friend', 'journey', 'was', 'never', 'completed', 'due', 'danger', 'inherent', 'such', 'trip.The', 'DVD', 'superlative', 'visuals', 'crystal', 'clear', 'audio', 'only', 'few', 'limited', 'bonus', 'options', 'special', 'features', 'interesting', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Lifting', 'Veil', 'quot', 'documentary', 'Ms.', 'Pazira', 'viewer', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'how', 'came', 'film', 'was', 'made.There', 'also', 'film', 'commentary', 'Ms.', 'Pazira', 'What', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'not', 'director', 'perspective', 'commentary', 'very', 'personal', 'perspective', 'details', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'conveyed', 'film', 'who', 'listen', 'commentary', 'will', 'know', 'film', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'Nafas', 'finding', 'sister', 'film', 'Afghanistan']",N/A

There were times when I wondered where the hidden camera was, and who was holding it.The story is about a woman born in Afghanistan who escaped to Canada and became a journalist.  She is returning to Afghanistan to try to rescue her sister, who told her that she plans to kill herself soon.As I watched the film, as I watched the oppressed women with their faces completely covered in their burkas, as I watched the little children learning the dogma of their religion, which is all about killing infidels, I had no sympathy for the Afghan culture.  Afghans, and Middle Eastern Muslims in general, come off as brainwashed and ignorant savages.One major character in the film is an American black man who impersonates a Muslim doctor and dispenses medical advice and food to the people.  He wears a false beard.  As he was counseling the Canadian journalist for her stomach problems, I was struck by the situation of two pretenders in a foreign land.  Since the film is not a documentary, but a scripted story, I find the characters to be unbelievable as presented.The main impression I take away from this film is that the Arab people are dangerous, lying, ignorant savages.  Is that what the director and writer had in mind?  Is that the impression they were trying to convey?I'm not totally clear on how this film ends.  Is the journalist now a captive in Afghanistan?  Can she get out?  Is she a captive in the sense that she can't get back to Canada and must live a life of oppression in her native land?  Is she going to be imprisoned literally?  We don't really have closure and clarity here.Religion is a dangerous thing, isn't it.  They get you when you're young, they fill your baby brain with lies and garbage, and it stays with you into adulthood.  Religion controls you like a puppetmaster.  It's a damn shame that anyone believes this nonsense in the first place.

This film is NOT a documentary.  It is a fictionalized story of an Afghan woman, Nafas, a Canadian journalist, who returns to Afghanistan during the reign of the Taliban to search for her sister.Filmed in Iran, it nevertheless gives us a feel for the bleak sun-dried landscape of Afghanistan.  Here, the woman wear burkas, they are not allowed to go to school, and they must constantly look out for land mines.  During the course of the film Nafas has disguises herself as a fourth wife of a man returning to Afghanistan from Iran, is helped by a young boy who has to eke out a living the best way he can after being thrown out of a religious school, sickens and meets a doctor who speaks English and joins a one-armed man and a group of women on their way to a wedding in Kandahar.There is horror and oppression everywhere, not just for the women, but also for everyone under Taliban rule.  Saddest of all are the victims of the land mines.  There are several scenes in a Red Cross station about this, with the dozens of one-legged men who are in constant pain and who wait for the helicopters to drop prosthetic legs from the sky.Nelofer Pazura, a real-life Canadian journalist who was born in Kabul and therefore speaks both Parsi and English, plays the  part of Nafas.  She is beautiful with wide sad blue eyes and she plays this role as if in a dream, her face expressionless whenever she lifts her burka.

Nafas, an Afghan-born Canadian journalist, returns to her homeland in a desperate attempt to reach her sister.  Clothed in a traditional head-to-toe burka, and posing as a subservient wife, Nafas' odyssey takes her across a dramatic desert landscape, where she encounters overwhelmed Red Cross workers, hordes of land-mine victims and finally a wedding procession that brings her within eyeshot of Kandahar.CAC's Comments:  This film allows the audience to not only follow Nafas on her voyage but be a part of her emotional journey through Afghanistan.  This film demonstrates a perfect example of a traditional Middle Eastern wedding march which is still common and quite popular today.

Roger Ebert says it well: ""KANDAHAR does not provide deeply drawn characters, memorable dialogue or an exciting climax. Its traffic is in images..."" It is the images that stick. This was made before 9/11 to show the persecution of women in Afghanistan. It is partially based on a true story involving Nelofer Pazira (Nafas), an Afghan-born Canadian journalist. In the film she has received a letter from her sister who was left behind when the family evacuated Russian-controlled Afghanistan. Her sister, now living under the rule of the Taliban, no longer wants to go on living and has given a date, the lunar eclipse, when she will commit suicide. The letter was delayed in getting to Nafas and she has arrived at the Iranian-Afghan border with only three days until the eclipse. As a woman, she is not free to travel alone into Afghanistan. She must arrange for some male assistance. The rest of the film is about her journey to find her sister. Along the way she meets a Black American disguised as an Afghan medical doctor, a Red Cross camp helping land mine victims who have lost legs. The image of the doctor (he doesn't know she is from Canada initially) asking questions of Nafas thru a third party and being separated by a sheet with a hole to examine her ears, eyes and mouth would be humorous, if not true. A Red Cross helicopter makes a 'leg drop', parachuting artificial legs to the camp below and we are overwhelmed by the image of several dozen amputees with crutches literally racing each other to get a pair of legs. The image of a her young male guide (10-12 years old) pulling a ring off a skeleton in the desert and trying to sell it to her is wrenching. Once again, we are struck by the incredible cruelty that the human race is capable of inflicting on one another, simply because of race or gender. You will probably not remember the plot but you will remember the images, images the reinforce the knowledge that there is both good and evil in this world and we must counter evil wherever we find it.

Her sister tells Nafas that she can no longer live in the oppressive conditions of their homeland, and she intends to commit suicide on the last eclipse of the 20th century. Nafas journeys to Afghanistan and tries desperately to reach her sister in Kandahar before the day of the eclipse. She carries with her a tape recorder on which she records the details of her journey in hopes that the stories and voices on that tape will give her sister some reason to live. Nafas enters the country through the Iranian border and must rely on the aid of others to lead her to Kandahar. She takes any opportunity she can to get closer to Kandahar and enlists the aid of an itinerant family, a young boy (Sadou Teymouri), an American-born doctor (Hassan Tantai), and a con artist in her struggle to reach her sister before the eclipse.""Kandahar"" is a thoughtful and beautiful film directed by acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makmalbaf, but it doesn't have much of a narrative. What we see is a journey more than a story. The film isn't long, but it has a languid pace, which is appropriate for traveling across a desert. Nafas is in a big hurry to reach her sister, so the film's pace also helps us empathize with her frustration. But ""Kandahar"" doesn't seem to be about Nafas or her sister. Nafas' quest is a vehicle for the images that ""Kandahar"" presents us with, images that are both strikingly beautiful and sadly absurd: a group of one-legged men racing to catch prosthetic limbs that have been dropped by parachute from a plane, a group of people clad in astonishingly bright burquas walking across the dessert, a boy who has been expelled from mullah school trading clothes with the boy who will take his place, another boy taking a lovely ring from the finger of a half-buried skeleton. We have read about the appalling conditions in Afghanistan, and you can see them up close in this film. But ""Kandahar""'s images are the film's real strength and the reason to see it.

Nafas shows a melancholy courage in her quest; she is determined to find her sister and must subject herself to the dangers of bandits and checkpoints where women are body searched and otherwise humiliated. Along the way we are shown boys being trained to be mullahs; this scene is very effective in portraying the brainwashing techniques used on boys who must learn and recite prayers as well as hold up a Russian machine gun and explain it's purpose. When one boy is expelled for improper recital, he must do what he can to make money, thus he agrees to escort Nafas to Kandahar after she is abandoned by her first escorts. He is aggressive and desperate; the boy who played this part was one of the better actors in the movie. And so it goes on - Nafas is passed from escort to escort due to the dangers and suspicions of others.The actress portraying Nafas is beautiful; she need not have said a word to convey the pain and sorrow of her plight, because her eyes are so expressive.

I can't even say whether, living in Iran, Makhmalbaf feels free to say what he means, otherwise than through film. However, he has put up a long background document on Afghanistan at [...]What I saw is a semi-documentary set in a desertic area of Afghanistan, built of long sequences each of which is very telling, admirably constructed and visually beautiful. In fact, the film has been criticized for its beauty. The topic about which the images are so telling, is what Afghan society (which is essentially rural) has been reduced to by twenty years of war, and especially the state of the female half of that society.The sequences are linked together by the fictional component. A 21-year old Afghan refugee from Ottawa, Canada, working as a journalist, wants to reach her sister in Kandahar before she commits suicide on the eclipse. The sister told her about her plan in a letter sent three months before, but events have left our protagonist on the Iranian border three days before the eclipse. The sequences occur as she progresses towards Kandahar. The sister has never left Afghanistan because on the way out with the rest of the family, 15 years before, she stepped on a mine and lost her legs. Her father remained with her, but he is now dead.The Canadian sister will never reach Kandahar. As the film ends, she has been caught by the Taliban, to no one's surprise. I surmise she will either be taken up as booty by a commander, for a Xth wife or concubine, or will be raped by soldiers, as booty again, and left to fend as a prostitute until caught again and executed. She may well live no longer than her sister.In my reading the protagonist's naive self-centeredness is meant to set off the non-fictional images. There is a visual leitmotif translating this egocentrism. On all occasions, the girl keeps dictating her precious thoughts and &quot;candles of hope&quot; for her sister into a small tape recorder -- in English, which of course her sister can't understand: she's dictating to her own sensitive self.

This is an American black Muslim who came to Afghanistan over fifteen years before looking for God by fighting the Russians, and has now learned to simply look for opportunities to do good.There is an unfinished dialog on the topic of hope, and, reading between the lines, my perception is that the endless war has cleansed Afghan society of any occasion for hope, especially for women, and that this cleansing is simply expressed through the Taliban.

736973,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000089RTM,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","When you see ""Kandahar,"" it's almost impossible to believe that you're watching a film set in the late 20th Century.  Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film takes place in Afghanistan in the latter days of the Taliban regime, when women were not merely viewed as second class citizens, but were denied any form of education or civil rights and even had to go out in public covered from head to toe to prevent men from seeing their faces.  The filmmaker takes us to the heart of this alien and frightening world and makes us see, perhaps for the first time on the big screen, just how horrific life was for women in that time and place.""Kandahar"" is less a narrative film than a series of fascinating vignettes that drive home the realities of life in that part of the world.  What plot there is involves the efforts of a female Canadian journalist to sneak back into her native country to prevent her desperate sister in Kandahar from committing suicide at the next solar eclipse.  But that is really just a string on which to hang the individual pearls that make up the film.  What is of primary interest to both the filmmaker and the audience are the various people the journalist encounters and the many experiences she undergoes.  Hidden beneath her own burka, she witnesses firsthand the devastating poverty, the utter degradation and de-humanization of women, and the authoritarian oppression that defined life in that country during the Taliban rule.  Along the way, she meets an American doctor who is trying his hardest to in some way relieve the misery of these people, but who finds himself waging a losing battle against the primitivism and theocratic oppression that have made life a living hell for the common citizenry of the country.  She also encounters a seemingly endless group of people who have become dismembered by all the land mines left over from the Afghani war with the Russians.  There is one remarkable scene wherein hordes of desperate, one-legged men hobble on crutches across the desert as Red Cross helicopters rain prosthetic limbs down onto the sands below.  It is merely one among many images from the film that seer themselves into the viewer's memory.  Another is a scene in which a male doctor has to examine his female patients through a hole cut out of a sheet, not even being allowed to talk to the woman directly about her symptoms but having to get his information through a male (or female child) ""interpreter.""Makhmalbaf keeps the ending of the film deliberately ambiguous which might frustrate some viewers but which actually adds to the verisimilitude of the piece.  In the same way, much of the acting in the film borders on the amateurish at times, but again that contributes to the pseudo-documentary aura that the film must have to be truly effective.  A clear-cut narrative resolution and slick performances by obviously professional actors would likely rob the film of its much-needed sense of immediacy.""Kandahar,"" by providing a voice to so many voiceless people, is a film that cries out to be seen.",4,fascinating pseudo-documentary drama,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,3042,"['When', 'see', 'Kandahar', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'set', 'late', '20th', 'Century', 'Mohsen', 'Makhmalbaf', 'film', 'place', 'Afghanistan', 'latter', 'days', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'merely', 'viewed', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'were', 'denied', 'form', 'education', 'civil', 'rights', 'even', 'had', 'go', 'out', 'public', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'prevent', 'men', 'seeing', 'filmmaker', 'heart', 'alien', 'frightening', 'world', 'see', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'just', 'how', 'horrific', 'life', 'was', 'women', 'time', 'place', 'Kandahar', 'less', 'narrative', 'film', 'series', 'fascinating', 'vignettes', 'drive', 'home', 'realities', 'life', 'part', 'world', 'What', 'plot', 'efforts', 'female', 'Canadian', 'journalist', 'sneak', 'back', 'native', 'country', 'prevent', 'desperate', 'sister', 'Kandahar', 'committing', 'suicide', 'next', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'really', 'just', 'string', 'hang', 'individual', 'pearls', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'What', 'primary', 'interest', 'filmmaker', 'audience', 'are', 'various', 'people', 'journalist', 'encounters', 'many', 'experiences', 'Hidden', 'own', 'burka', 'firsthand', 'devastating', 'poverty', 'utter', 'degradation', 'de-humanization', 'women', 'authoritarian', 'oppression', 'defined', 'life', 'country', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'way', 'American', 'doctor', 'who', 'trying', 'hardest', 'way', 'relieve', 'misery', 'people', 'who', 'waging', 'losing', 'battle', 'primitivism', 'theocratic', 'oppression', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'common', 'citizenry', 'country', 'also', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'dismembered', 'land', 'mines', 'left', 'over', 'Afghani', 'war', 'Russians', 'one', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'wherein', 'hordes', 'desperate', 'one-legged', 'men', 'hobble', 'crutches', 'desert', 'Red', 'Cross', 'helicopters', 'rain', 'prosthetic', 'limbs', 'down', 'sands', 'merely', 'one', 'many', 'images', 'film', 'viewer', 'memory', 'scene', 'male', 'doctor', 'examine', 'female', 'patients', 'hole', 'cut', 'sheet', 'not', 'even', 'being', 'allowed', 'talk', 'woman', 'directly', 'symptoms', 'having', 'get', 'information', 'male', 'female', 'child', 'interpreter', 'Makhmalbaf', 'ending', 'film', 'deliberately', 'ambiguous', 'might', 'frustrate', 'viewers', 'actually', 'verisimilitude', 'piece', 'same', 'way', 'much', 'acting', 'film', 'borders', 'amateurish', 'times', 'again', 'pseudo-documentary', 'aura', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'be', 'truly', 'effective', 'clear-cut', 'narrative', 'resolution', 'slick', 'performances', 'obviously', 'professional', 'actors', 'would', 'likely', 'rob', 'film', 'much-needed', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'Kandahar', 'providing', 'voice', 'so', 'many', 'voiceless', 'people', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

The film focuses in particular on the women and children forced to survive under hostile conditions. Their marginal existence in the desert sands on the border of Iran and Afghanistan reflects their status within the Taliban-ruled country from which they live in exile. Even more dramatically, the film explores the plight of those who have lost limbs from land mines.Particularly informative is the commentary by actress Nelofer Pazira that is included on the DVD. Her comments reveal in eloquent detail not only the making of the movie (shot where it takes place) but the rationale behind the creative choices made, often on the fly, as the film crew worked under difficult and dangerous conditions.
