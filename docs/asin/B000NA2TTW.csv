It highlights some of the outstanding events of reconstruction after the Civil War including the founding of the KKK. It makes the point grahphically that while the North won the Civil War, the South won the period of Reconstruction.

1055594,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B000NA2TTW,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[5, 5]","A fairly nice overview of the Reconstruction Period after the American Civil War.  Old Hollywood films focused on the poor South after the war and how the carpetbaggers took advantage of them.  This focuses on some of the bad people who tried to keep White Supremacy lingering after they lost the war.  Interesting focuses on the Massacre of New Orleans, the land given to the freed slaves and, of course, the Klu Klux Klan.  There are some extreme bouts of violence for a Historical piece so I'd watch it with the kids.  In addition, some will argue that this piece paints the CSA in too much of a negative light.

Bullcrap !So many educational leftists are trying to infiltrate their revisionists history into our own American History books through their leftist political legislatures, and show ""Whitey"" as horrible and evil people.  Don't believe me ?  Look at many of the new history books being distributed throughout American schools today - - they show George Washington as a slave owner first, and the 1st President a distant second.  What is talked about the most ?  His slave-owning ways, damn his significance in the wars he fought in and country he led thereafter.  Harriet Tubman has 14 pages dedicated to her and what she did.  Thomas Jefferson has one - - - and he also is written about as having illigitamate Black children.This fricken country is being sold down the river, people !  Wake up !  It's unconstitutional to say and advertise ""Christmas"" or talk about Christ or Jesus...that is classified today as being ""evil, hatred, non-inclusive, non-tolerant, spiteful""....yet in Detroit now, there are more Muslim mosques that do their load-speaker ""prayers"" each morning, and nobody even flinches anymore - - and is perfectly fine !Trust me...there will be another ""Civil War"" in America once again !  People who are God-fearing Americans who LOVE THIS COUNTRY...and ""imports"" from the past 20-years CHANGING THE USA into a wimpering, limp-wristed & pathetic coward, allowing all radical groups to continue to enter this country !  Why ???  Ask Obama how many illegal aliens are allowed in, get federal benefits just so long as they vote ""Democrat"" !Take it to the bank folks...our country will NEVER be like it was when we were growing up, the children of the ""Greatest Generation"" who gave their lives for this magnificent country in WW II.  It is being infiltrated by many of the same groups and countries who HATED OUR GUTS, but we welcome these people with open arms !May almighty God save this country of ours....",2,What a crock !

1055596,A28H9552TOQWEO,B000NA2TTW,Tejana,"[8, 8]","One of the best documentaries on the Reconstruction.  Too often books, movies and even classes focus just on the Civil War and then throw the Reconstruction into a halfarsed epilogue. This DVD brilliantly flushes out what happened for all segments of society in the South: newly freed Blacks, landowning Whites, poor Whites and (thankfully!) Native Americans. Finally someone got it right.  The Reconstruction was as bloody as the war itself, both Northerns and Southerns were guility and everyone was involved.For what its worth, this DVD includes two Bonus Programs: Images of the Civil War and Guns of the Civil War - the bonus programs are 45 minutes each.
