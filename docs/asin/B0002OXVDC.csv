842574,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0002OXVDC,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","That's Entertainment, Part 2 is full of incredibly wonderful clips from some of the best musicals, comedies and even some dramas ever to come out of ""The Dream Factory"" at MGM Studios. True, some will say that hosts Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire tried too hard or their style was perhaps over the top, but it was great to see they still had it! The movie's main flaw, again as others have noted, is that the clips from the movies are shorter than they were in ""That's Entertainment"" and they are indeed presented without any real sense of organization, but then again what I watched was so special my eyes were glued to the screen nonetheless.There are so many wonderful scenes in this film that I scarcely know where to begin when describing the movie to you; and I'm certainly not going to list them all and spoil it all for you! Bobby Van's ""hop dance"" from ""Small Town Girl"" mesmerized me; I don't know where he got the energy to handle an extended scene like that! The ""stateroom scene"" from ""A Night at the Opera"" with The Marx Brothers had me laughing hysterically; Groucho's one liners are brilliant! Of course, we get plenty of Judy and Mickey both together and with others; and Doris Day's ""Ten Cents a Dance"" is a knockout number that couldn't have been done any better. Bing Crosby comes along in a clip from ""Going Hollywood"" and he does a splendid Cole Porter number, ""Now You Has Jazz,"" from ""High Society"" with Louis Armstrong and His Band. We see Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, King and Queen of the operetta; and look for a very young Jack Benny to introduce MGM lyricist and producer Arthur Freed who sings ""The Wedding of the Painted Doll.""Of course there's much more for you to enjoy including a clip of Greta Garbo dancing; the segment devoted to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn is nicely done.The DVD has the film in widescreen on one side and the ""standard version"" is on the flip side.""That's Entertainment, Part 2"" may not be as well organized as its predecessor; but it's every bit as fun and spellbinding to watch. I highly recommend this for fans of the actors here and the golden age of movies from MGM Studios; people who appreciate retrospectives about film from yesteryear in general would also do well to add this to their collections.",4,"+ 1/2 star: ""There's no people like show people!""",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,2276,"['Entertainment', 'Part', '2', 'full', 'incredibly', 'wonderful', 'clips', 'best', 'musicals', 'comedies', 'even', 'dramas', 'ever', 'come', 'Dream', 'Factory', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'True', 'will', 'say', 'hosts', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'style', 'was', 'perhaps', 'top', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'still', 'had', 'movie', 'main', 'flaw', 'again', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'clips', 'movies', 'are', 'shorter', 'were', 'Entertainment', 'are', 'indeed', 'presented', 'real', 'sense', 'organization', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'watched', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'eyes', 'were', 'glued', 'screen', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'film', 'scarcely', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'when', 'describing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'list', 'spoil', 'Bobby', 'Van', 'hop', 'dance', 'Small', 'Town', 'Girl', 'mesmerized', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'got', 'energy', 'handle', 'extended', 'scene', 'stateroom', 'scene', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'had', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'Groucho', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'brilliant', 'course', 'get', 'plenty', 'Judy', 'Mickey', 'together', 'others', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Ten', 'Dance', 'knockout', 'number', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'along', 'clip', 'Going', 'Hollywood', 'splendid', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'number', 'Now', 'Has', 'Jazz', 'High', 'Society', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Band', 'see', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'King', 'Queen', 'operetta', 'look', 'very', 'young', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'introduce', 'MGM', 'lyricist', 'producer', 'Arthur', 'Freed', 'who', 'Wedding', 'Painted', 'Doll', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'enjoy', 'including', 'clip', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'dancing', 'segment', 'devoted', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'nicely', 'done.The', 'DVD', 'film', 'widescreen', 'one', 'side', 'standard', 'version', 'flip', 'side', 'Entertainment', 'Part', '2', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'organized', 'predecessor', 'bit', 'fun', 'spellbinding', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'actors', 'here', 'golden', 'age', 'movies', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'retrospectives', 'film', 'yesteryear', 'general', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

Christian,"[10, 12]","There are some gems in this 1976 edition of ""That's Entertainment"", but seeing Fred and Gene trying to dance and clown was hard for me to watch. Although they were energetic and supreme in their craft in their heyday, they are obviously trying too hard to be entertaining within the context of introducing the clips. It was heartwarming, but somehow painful to watch them TRYING to be great again. I would have much preferred them to simply introduce the clips in dignified fashion... and surprise... that's exactly what the producers did in ""That's Entertainment part 3"" in 1994. It worked as beautifully as it did in the first edition. Both 1 and 3 also concentrated on MUSICAL numbers, and part 2 does not... it seemed to mock the old musical style more than present it.

The comedy tributes are a nice touch while the best musical numbers put a smile on your face. Esther Williams' spectacular waterskiing sequence from ""Easy to Love"" is worth the price of admission.

842578,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0002OXVDC,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 2]","THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT PART 2 is not quiet the caliber of the first film in the series, but it still has a great deal to offer. Like the first film, it has all sorts of great clips from MGM musicals. For musical lovers makes this film intriguing is that unlike the first film it's not a collection of the best known scenes, but secondary scenes that are treasured by audiences. For example, the Fred Astyaire/Cyd Charisse number in THE BAND WAGON is in the first film but ask anyone who loves this film what one of the best scenes would be, it would bee the ""Triplets"" scene which part two includes. Ann Miller's dancing among the musical instruments in SMALL TOWN GIRL makes the first film but the effervescent scene where Bobby Vann believes he's headed to stardom and hops his way through the town makes part two and if you're a fan of the MGM musical, this stuff is great.One of the potential drawbacks of this film, at least today, is the Fred Astaire/Gene Kelley narration and dance collaboration. Today it's kind of hokey and distracting, but I'm sure when it was released, their loyal fans probably thought it was great to see them again, and even if it is a bit overdone at times, it's evident how much they loved being song and dance men and how much they did contribute to film in general.Now if someone from MGM (or Warner Home Video) is reading this, I'd like to make a suggestion. In the overture an excerpt from LILI (""Hi-Lili Hi-Lo"") can be heard. We also become nostalgic for SMALL TOWN GIRL and it makes me wonder whether or not it's time for MGM to look at some of the classics included in all the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT series and do some re-releasing in DVD.
