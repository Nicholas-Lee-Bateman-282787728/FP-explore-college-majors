It's less a sequel of any sort than it is a rehash of ideas from the previous story, with a some of the story lines switched around between characters.For example, Elfric's character and storyline in this tale are so much like Alfred's in ""Pillars"" it's ridiculous, and even the name change isn't much of a stretch. One character's earldom is wrongfully taken from him and given to another, followed by one of his offspring's determination to get it back, although it takes many years. The main couple in the story have to separate for a number of years, with the man going to Europe where he perfects his craft, just like Aliena and Jack in ""Pillars."" And more of the same with other characters is found throughout the storyline.Visually, I enjoyed it, and some of the casting was very good. Cynthia Nixon did a great job, and I liked the actor who played Edward III very much.On a sidenote, there's excessive use of the ""F"" word, which is needless, as well as being historically inaccurate, since that word isn't believed to have been in use for at least another century, according to language experts.It was watchable, but far from what I was hoping for when I started on it.",2,Too similar to previous story,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1336,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'version', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'having', 'seen', 'later', 'read', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'see', 'many', 'similarities', 'less', 'sequel', 'sort', 'rehash', 'ideas', 'previous', 'story', 'story', 'lines', 'switched', 'characters.For', 'example', 'Elfric', 'character', 'storyline', 'tale', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'Alfred', 'Pillars', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'name', 'change', ""n't"", 'much', 'stretch', 'One', 'character', 'earldom', 'wrongfully', 'taken', 'given', 'followed', 'one', 'offspring', 'determination', 'get', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'main', 'couple', 'story', 'have', 'separate', 'number', 'years', 'man', 'going', 'Europe', 'where', 'craft', 'just', 'Aliena', 'Jack', 'Pillars', 'more', 'same', 'other', 'characters', 'found', 'storyline.Visually', 'enjoyed', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'liked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Edward', 'III', 'very', 'much.On', 'sidenote', 'excessive', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'needless', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'word', ""n't"", 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'use', 'least', 'century', 'according', 'language', 'experts.It', 'was', 'watchable', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'when', 'started']",N/A

Last year, I fell in love with The Pillars of the Earth miniseries and was beyond thrilled when I heard that World Without End was also being made into a miniseries.  World Without End was my favorite book between the two: I loved the love story and the inclusion of the black plague.My husband is also a Follett fan and we watched this series together.  I really enjoyed the World Without End miniseries, and I'm really glad I watched it, but I thought that The Pillars of the Earth miniseries was better.  World Without End strayed too far from the book (why they felt the need to change an already-perfect plot is beyond me) and I did not always agree with the changes that were made.  So much death!  Sex!  Back-stabbing!I still highly recommend the World Without End miniseries, as it's a great story acted out by an oustanding cast with great acting.

1586982,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0099114LA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[127, 133]","I always experience a fair amount of excitement, as well as trepidation, when I hear that one of my favorite novels is being adapted into a TV show or movie.  That is certainly the case with Ken Follett's sprawling, unforgettable and absolutely massive ""World Without End.""  The hardcover is such a doorstop in size, but I was genuinely connected to the characters and consider it an almost perfect reading experience.  Ostensibly a sequel of sorts to ""Pillars of the Earth"" (they are set in the same location approximately two centuries apart), it is interesting to note that ""Pillars"" received the mini-series treatment from the Starz network in 2010.  The fledgling Reelz network picked up this 8-part 2012 adaptation of ""World Without End"" for its broadcast debut.  Reelz made a name for itself when it bought the mini-series ""The Kennedys"" after the History Channel bowed to pressures not to air it, and they picked up a basket full of Emmys for that decision.  Here they team with Tony (RIP) and Ridley Scott as producers, Michael Caton-Jones as director, and an eclectic international cast for a bold production that lacks some of the pacing and nuance of the source material.As in most cases, if you are approaching ""World Without End"" expecting a complete and literal translation of what was in the book--you will likely be disappointed.  The story, for the most part, remains intact but there are also huge liberties taken with the presentation.  However, that is to anticipated.  As a television mini-series, the makers must be allowed to deviate as necessary for time, for content (this is not a premium cable production with explicit language and/or nudity), and for narrative flow.  My biggest issue with these eight parts is that they vary considerably in their impact.  I think the series starts strong, than veers into more mundane territory, than picks up again.  It is relatively hit-or-miss in its plotting and pacing.  I loved some of ""World Without End"" and I was somewhat ambivalent about parts of it as well.  In terms of dramatic interpretation, the series does seem to lack character shading.  Either someone is a cackling villain or a pious saint with very little middle ground, and I think that is something that falls short in the screenplay.  I think the character development suffers with the fact that there is so much story to tell and this also explains why huge sequences feel rushed beyond measure.Still, I can't completely dismiss ""World Without End"" as some book purists are sure to.  It is a handsome production, I liked much of the cast, and it's a suitably entertaining soap opera set amidst a historical backdrop.  It is set, once again, in the cathedral town of Kingsbridge now in the 14th century.  Initially, the town is robust and thriving but things are to experience a pivotal switch after the death of King Edward II.  A mysterious knight with a secret (Ben Chaplin) arrives and soon the forces of the church, the monarchy, and the ordinary citizens are on a collision course that just might destroy Kingsbridge.  The story itself spans many years but centers largely around the start of the 100 Year War as well as a devastating plague.  At the center of the story are young lovers Merthin (Tom Weston-Jones from BBC's Copper) and Caris (Charlotte Riley).  Ordinary citizens emboldened to make a difference, this becomes a story of unlikely heroes.  Others in the cast include a creepy Rupert Evans (Godwyn) a Machiavellian Cynthia Nixon (Petranilla), an imperious Peter Firth (Earl Roland), a level-headed Miranda Richardson (Mother Cecilia), an increasingly unhinged Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Ralph), and a pair of embattled royals Aure Atika (Queen Isabella) and Blake Ritson (Edward III).I really liked both Weston-Jones and Jackson-Cohen as the estranged brothers, I'd watch Miranda Richardson in anything, and both Evans and Nixon chew up the scenery in gleefully over-the-top portraits of villainy.  In the novel, the royals play more in the backdrop of the story.  With this adaptation, they are full fledged characters with much screen time.  This is a major deviation, but not a fatal one by any means.  Less successful (for me) was the Gwenda character (Nora von Waldstatten) who never felt particularly integrated into the story.  Again, though, this is not the book.  This presentation is a throw-back to the days where network TV miniseries ruled the ratings roost.  Sometimes cheesy, sometimes superficial, I still found plenty of fun in ""World Without End.""  I particularly liked the bigger moments (bridge collapse, plague) where we spent more concentrated time with the protagonists.  Not a home run, by any means, but not a complete strike out.  This should be perfectly entertaining to those that love history based drama.  If you love the novel, it's best to approach the series with appropriate expectations.

1586986,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B0099114LA,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[1, 2]","When a mini-series or regular film is based upon a book source, there are invariably changes that are made in order to take into consideration the difference in mediums. Even THE GODFATHER movie was not exactly like the book; and there is yet to be a movie or mini-series based upon THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII or SHE which remotely resemble their book sources. In the DVD Special Features section, even Ken Follett and more than one actor acknowledged the difference between the two in this case, and no one objected. Certainly Follett has more of a right than anyone. Yet, he emphatically endorsed the screenplay.Now to the mini-series itself: Cynthia Nixon (of SEX & THE CITY fame), who as Petranilla got top billing was like a cross between Lucretia Borgia, Lady Macbeth, and Lady deWinter - and she played the role deliciously. Her son Godwyn (Rupert Evans - THE PALACE, FINGERSMITH, SONS & LOVERS, HELLBOY, etc.) is a priest whose desire to be Prior and ultimately Bishop leads him down a path of sadistic unbridled palpable evil. His ambition needs no explanation. It is what it is. Those who would like to see all the evil-doers in this story on a pyschiatrist's couch in order to explain their behavior might just as well put half the world on one. While the quote is not precise, it is true enough: ""Abolute power corrupts absolutely."" The tyranny of the Church and that of Imperial power is exposed for what it is/was. Only the Black Death (realistically and emotionally presented to the hilt) was able to derail the iron fisted control of both sacred and secular authority.Charlotte Riley as Caris, a student of the medical arts, was the key heroin of the film. But, what was more important was the revelation of the Church's fear of this type of ""physician"" and the lengths it would go to in order to suppress it. The general populace, which benefited from this ""new"" medicine, was far more understanding and sympathetic than the powers that be who felt threatened that all of this would supplant the idea of divine intervention and healing. Since many medical ideas came from Islam, they were also branded as the work of the ""infidel"" even by those who were healed or helped by it. Caris is caught between a developing love for a youthful ""builder"" and the predatory incestuous feelings of her own cousin - Godwyn - who harbors his dark secret while branding any woman he can as a ""whore"".Critics of this mini-series, who keep pounding its book source as though it were the Bible, overlook the magnificent costumes that heralded in a New Age. The difference between what was worn in THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH compared to WORLD WITHOUT END was noted and indicated a fashion change that took place 200 years later. The church of Kingsbridge, now complete and in full Gothic regalia thanks in part to CGE, stood as a potent back drop to the civic activity that took place literally  on its door step. The armour and weaponry was effectively realistic even though some purists might disagree.In the end what we have, without giving too much away, is an excellent story, superbly acted by a host of gifted and well-known actors, set in the Middle Ages of mid-14th century England and France. Evil exists on all levels, from the lowest peasant to the King himself. It's merely a matter of degree and kind. But, like it or not, it does unfortunately reflect human nature. And I would hardly call proper behavior by some ""goodie two shoes"". There are those who are good and those who are bad. What we see in this mini-series is a slice of Medieval life that lays bare the horror of endless war, plague, rape, incest, ambition run amok, faith, faith denied, class warfare, love of all kinds, overbearing superstition, heroics, revenge - in short, all those things that make up the fabric of humankind in all its incarnations. And is all that really so different than what we have today? In addition to the above named actors, kudos to Miranda Richardson as Mother Cecilia, Peter Firth as Sir Roland, Tim Weston-Jones as Merthin the Builder, Oliver Jackson-Cohen (his brother) as a merciless Everyman Warrior who knows how to play the game, the actor who played Edward III (and is now in DaVinci's Demons), the actress who played his mother Queen Isabella, and the characters Gwenda, Wulfric, and Thomas.As for any complaint as to how the ""Most Evil"" were dispatched, I can assure the reader of this review that their demise fit all the characters in the most appropriate, satisfying, and ironic way.",5,ENJOY THIS MINI-SERIES AND FORGET THE BOOK REVIEWS,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,4500,"['When', 'mini-series', 'regular', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'source', 'are',

For the vast part, it is a different beast. Some characters are so different that the only thing their have in common with their counterparts in the book is their name.I liked ""The Pillars of the Earth"" more than ""World Without End"". Probably most people did. I also liked that adaptation more than this one. On that one, we had the incredible Ian McShane carrying the whole thing on his shoulders.

It didn't worked very well in the series. Some stories (like Gwenda's, for example) became almost meaningless. There was no time for character build up either. The inconsistencies got on my nerve. The victims constantly saved the skin of those that wrecked their life, either due to selfishness or good nature, only to be wrecked by them again. Either way, they looked like fools.

The combined effect of writing and acting makes me forget that I am watching a period piece. The period doesn't even enter into it.The writing also seems jumpy.

Maybe that is the acting, maybe it's the directing, but either way it makes me strain to sit through it.As a stand alone piece, I thought it was okay. Not worth however many episodes it ended up being all those hours of viewing.
