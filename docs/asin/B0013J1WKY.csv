1142612,AY12DBB0U420B,B0013J1WKY,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night I watched/listened to a Christina Aguilera concert, ""Back to Basics: Live and Down Under."" I picked up the DVD from the bargain-rack at a local Ross Store. It was a rather good DVD concert. Most concert DVDs seem to have either poor sound or poor photography, or both. This DVD was quite well done. Both the visuals and the sound were quite good and made for enjoyable watching and listening.I'd heard of Christina Aguilera, but this was the first time I've ever seen her or listened to her music. I was favorably impressed. She's a bit hard to peg, but I'd say she's part Soul, part Madonna and with a bit or Michael Jackson tossed in. The concert was impressive. Christina had about a 15-piece backing band, which reminded me somewhat of a small ""Big Band"" with a couple guitars. In addition, there were about 10 singers/dancers. Sorry if my numbers are off as it's hard to count with so many people on stage. Christina was usually front and center with mic and an active member of the dance troupe. I'd say the whole performance, together with the band, was rather active and athletic and Christina's vocals were excellent. The large Australian crowd, of course, loved the presentation and Christina and her troupe loved the responsive crowd. It was just a good concert and you'd enjoy being there.The Christina Aguilera disc is hard for me to rate. Although I liked the music and performance, it was not my type of most-enjoyable music so I'd probably give it four stars on that basis alone. However, this is one of the better concert DVDs I own, and I think that merits bumping the whole production up to five stars.Gary Peterson",5,Excellent Vocals and an Active And Athletic Concert.,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,1645,"['Last', 'night', 'watched/listened', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'concert', 'Back', 'Basics', 'Live', 'Down', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'bargain-rack', 'local', 'Ross', 'Store', 'was', 'rather', 'good', 'DVD', 'concert', 'Most', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'seem', 'have', 'poor', 'sound', 'poor', 'photography', 'DVD', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'visuals', 'sound', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'listening.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'listened', 'music', 'was', 'favorably', 'impressed', 'bit', 'hard', 'peg', ""'d"", 'say', 'part', 'Soul', 'part', 'Madonna', 'bit', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'tossed', 'concert', 'was', 'impressive', 'Christina', 'had', '15-piece', 'backing', 'band', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'small', 'Big', 'Band', 'couple', 'guitars', 'addition', 'were', '10', 'singers/dancers', 'Sorry', 'numbers', 'are', 'hard', 'count', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'stage', 'Christina', 'was', 'usually', 'front', 'center', 'mic', 'active', 'member', 'dance', 'troupe', ""'d"", 'say', 'whole', 'performance', 'together', 'band', 'was', 'rather', 'active', 'athletic', 'Christina', 'vocals', 'were', 'excellent', 'large', 'Australian', 'crowd', 'course', 'loved', 'presentation', 'Christina', 'troupe', 'loved', 'responsive', 'crowd', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'concert', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'being', 'there.The', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'disc', 'hard', 'rate', 'liked', 'music', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'type', 'most-enjoyable', 'music', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'basis', 'alone', 'However', 'one', 'better', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'own', 'think', 'merits', 'bumping', 'whole', 'production', 'five', 'stars.Gary', 'Peterson']",Christina Aguilera Back to Basics Live and Down Under Dvd ( 2 Disc Set )
