With so few G rated movies about, I would hate to even touch such a film.  Nevertheless, 'The Wild' is a worthy adventure with a few entertaining moments that accentuate many elements of familiar film territory.Ryan is a cub lion who suffers from an inferiority complex.  He has yet to reach adolescence and his roar is just one notch above a kitten.  His father, Samson, shares stories of his glory days with yarns that recall an earlier life outside the confines of the zoo.  They have their share of friends, including the independent female giraffe, and, uniquely, a squirrel who has one of the oddest crushes in movie memory.  There's a goofy python and a koala bear, who seems more like an English twit than a rugged Aussie.  There's a lot of random slapstick that doesn't add up to much, until the moody lion cub goes off on his own and needs a place besides a tree to have some quiet time.  He ends up in the back of a truck where he sleeps until morning.  Then, his father and others discover to their horror that he's being shipped back to ""the wild"".  They make it their mission to help the father and end up on the jungle island where they are outnumbered by some frightening wildebeasts trying to bridge their stature in the food chain.  There's also a volcano that works like a ticking time-bomb.Clocking in at just less than an hour and a half, 'The Wild' has enough character--or at least characterization--and a fun enough story to be a worthy viewing adventure.  I take exception to two key elements from the 'Star Wars' franchise, however:  One is a very familiar scene in a garbage truck where the giraffe is a key player, and the other is where the koala is made king of the wildebeasts, a little more than remiscent of C3-PO in 'Return of the Jedi'.  Otherwise, despite some random hijinx that doesn't integrate as well as 'Over the Hedge' and slapstick that is inserted haphazardly, 'The Wild' is a fine, family film that won't bore adults.",3,"'The Wild' Offers Fun, but Familiar Territory",1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2026,"['hard', 'criticize', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'Wild', 'so', 'few', 'G', 'rated', 'movies', 'would', 'hate', 'even', 'touch', 'such', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'Wild', 'worthy', 'adventure', 'few', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'accentuate', 'many', 'elements', 'familiar', 'film', 'territory.Ryan', 'cub', 'lion', 'who', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'yet', 'reach', 'adolescence', 'roar', 'just', 'one', 'notch', 'kitten', 'father', 'Samson', 'shares', 'stories', 'glory', 'days', 'yarns', 'recall', 'earlier', 'life', 'confines', 'zoo', 'have', 'share', 'friends', 'including', 'independent', 'female', 'giraffe', 'uniquely', 'squirrel', 'who', 'one', 'oddest', 'crushes', 'movie', 'memory', 'goofy', 'python', 'koala', 'bear', 'who', 'more', 'English', 'twit', 'rugged', 'Aussie', 'lot', 'random', 'slapstick', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'moody', 'lion', 'cub', 'off', 'own', 'place', 'tree', 'have', 'quiet', 'time', 'up', 'back', 'truck', 'where', 'morning', 'Then', 'father', 'others', 'discover', 'horror', 'being', 'shipped', 'back', 'wild', 'make', 'mission', 'help', 'father', 'end', 'up', 'jungle', 'island', 'where', 'are', 'outnumbered', 'frightening', 'wildebeasts', 'trying', 'bridge', 'stature', 'food', 'chain', 'also', 'volcano', 'ticking', 'time-bomb.Clocking', 'just', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'Wild', 'enough', 'character', 'least', 'characterization', 'fun', 'enough', 'story', 'be', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'adventure', 'take', 'exception', 'two', 'key', 'elements', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'franchise', 'however', 'One', 'very', 'familiar', 'scene', 'garbage', 'truck', 'where', 'giraffe', 'key', 'player', 'other', 'where', 'koala', 'made', 'king', 'wildebeasts', 'little', 'more', 'remiscent', 'C3-PO', ""'Return"", 'Jedi', 'Otherwise', 'random', 'hijinx', ""n't"", 'integrate', 'as', 'well', 'Hedge', 'slapstick', 'inserted', 'haphazardly', 'Wild', 'fine', 'family', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'adults']",The Wild

999273,A33AJ1MSMEIA3C,B000G75AZC,Anne,"[6, 9]","Having sat through the horror that is Madagascar, this movie ended up being a real treat.Madagascar had decent animation, but the dialogue was terrible.  I tended to zone out and do other things while watching it, and that is extremely rare for me.  Madagascar ended up being pieces jumbled together with no real coherence and the voice actors just weren't performing up to par.  I don't even remember what the movie was about as there was nothing memorable about it.The Wild, however, delivered all that Madagascar lacked.  Good choice with the soundtrack, animation top-tier, and plenty of character development.  I remained focused on the story and I knew exactly what was going on throughout the entire movie.What really sealed the deal for me, though, was the look of the characters.  I'm sure a lot of hard work was put into Madagascar, but the characters were just plain ugly and cheap looking compared to The Wild.  I was extremely impressed with The Wild's coloring and the fantastic job they did on the fur.Too intense for children?  Well, that's just tough cookies.  I can tell you right now that all the work put into this movie to make it so good looking is definitely not for the benefit of a bunch of whiny offspring.  I'm so sick and tired of seeing parents rate fantastic movies low just because their kids didn't like the movie.

999276,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,B000G75AZC,"Astral ""Astral""","[2, 3]","This is NOT truly a Disney movie.  It was developed by the now defunct C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures (who also assisted in Valiant and The Ant Bully).  Disney slapped their name on it and rolled it out as a Disney film, but The Wild is simply masquerading as one.  It was under production even before Madagascar, but unfortunate timing caused it to come out about a year afterwards, and was immediately branded as a ripoff.  The two films share many similarities, although the storylines are quite different.  This was special effects wizard, Steve ""Spaz"" Williams first film at the director's seat as well.  Some of these coincidences might have been truly unfortunate ones... if the film had been any good, and The Wild... while it can be said that it is indeed an animated film, it is certainly not a good one.Animals from the New York zoo end up in the wild - including a giraffe and a lion.  Sounds familiar?  Yet that's where the similarities end.  Madagascar was a genuinely amusing movie, with entertaining, personable characters and a good sense of timing - both comedic and dramatic.  The Wild is short on jokes, short on plot, and the characters may as well just be set pieces, for all the personality they have (and lack thereof).  The squirrel's fascination with Bridget the giraffe is as odious as it is ridiculous, with Benny the squirrel being an obnoxious character.  Nigel the Koala is oftentimes cruel, wishy washy (he considers letting his friends be lunch to further his own god status), and delusional.  The snake - an anaconda - is too stupid to even mention, and goes through the movie on a one trick pony.. squeezing other critters.  The only redeeming point of light is the mane attraction, Kiefer Sutherland's lion, and his cub son.  They go through some trite father/son parental issues, and that's as far as it goes...The movie runs at a hyper speed pace and never slows down.  It's chaotic and kinetic but not in a good way.  Lame one liners, forgettable characters prancing across the screen and overly loud modern rock tracks blast away, while the movies goes nowhere.  Twenty minutes feels like an hour... and by the time the movie is ended, I personally was just glad it was over.  The animation itself is not bad, it takes a more realistic approach to character design, instead of the stylistic look of Madagascar.  You can count the hairs in the lion's mane, but the look is rather bland and just as memorable as the rest of the film (which is not at all).  Of course making the animals stick so close to reality makes for some really awkward moments, such as the dance chorus of wildebeast... yes you read that right.Once the animals manage to get to The Wild (Africa) to rescue the cub who previously spazzed out and had a stupid ""run away from home"" teenager moment, they become embroiled in the most ridiculous part of this flat film.  The wildebeast (lead by an off-the rocker performance by William Shatner), have decided that they would no longer be prey and would become predator by eating the flesh of lions.  Somehow Nigel the koala is elevated to their god status, and there's some hoofed dancing and other craziness that goes along with the spooky volanco scenes.  None of this flows very well, and feels disjointed throughout the film.The Wild is simply not a good movie.  Adults are likely not going to enjoy this, for there is little that entertains.  I found it to be ludicrous, boring and lacking any kind of movie magic.  Madagascar is definitely the better film, and rightfully is lauded as such.  The Wild is like a platter of leftovers, bland and warmed over.With that being said, my kids both enjoyed watching the movie.  They have not asked to see it again, but they did like it the first time.  It might be worth the rental to entertain kids that have seen every other kid friendly movie out there - but the adults will want to find something else to do in the meantime.  The Wild flopped tremendously and killed off its studio... and it is easy to see how and why.",1,"Not Truly a Disney Movie, But Truly an Awful Film",1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,4021,"['NOT', 'truly', 'Disney', 'movie', 'was', 'developed', 'now', 'defunct', 'C.O.R.E', 'Digital', 'Pictures', 'who', 'also', 'assisted', 'Valiant', 'Ant', 'Bully', 'Disney', 'slapped', 'name', 'rolled', 'out', 'Disney', 'film', 'Wild', 'simply', 'masquerading', 'one', 'was', 'production', 'even', 'Madagascar', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'caused', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'afterwards', 'was', 'immediately', 'branded', 'ripoff', 'two', 'films', 'share', 'many', 'similarities', 'storylines', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'wizard', 'Steve', 'Spaz', 'Williams', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'seat', 'as', 'well', 'coincidences', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'ones', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'Wild', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'indeed', 'animated', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'good', 'one.Animals', 'New', 'York', 'zoo', 'end', 'up', 'wild', 'including', 'giraffe', 'lion', 'familiar', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'Madagascar', 'was', 'genuinely', 'amusing', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'personable', 'characters', 'good', 'sense', 'timing', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'Wild', 'short', 'jokes', 'short', 'plot', 'characters', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'pieces', 'personality', 'have', 'lack', 'thereof', 'squirrel', 'fascination', 'Bridget', 'giraffe', 'as', 'odious', 'ridiculous', 'Benny', 'squirrel', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'Koala', 'oftentimes', 'cruel', 'wishy', 'washy', 'letting', 'friends', 'be', 'lunch', 'further', 'own', 'god', 'status', 'delusional', 'snake', 'anaconda', 'too', 'stupid', 'even', 'mention', 'movie', 'one', 'trick', 'pony..', 'squeezing', 'other', 'critters', 'only', 'redeeming', 'point', 'light', 'mane', 'attraction', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'lion', 'cub', 'son', 'go', 'trite', 'father/son', 'parental', 'issues', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'hyper', 'speed', 'pace', 'never', 'down', 'chaotic', 'kinetic', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Lame', 'one', 'liners', 'forgettable', 'characters', 'prancing', 'screen', 'overly', 'loud', 'modern', 'rock', 'tracks', 'blast', 'away', 'movies', 'nowhere', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'feels', 'hour', 'time', 'movie', 'ended', 'personally', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'was', 'over', 'animation', 'not', 'bad', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'character', 'design', 'instead', 'stylistic', 'look', 'Madagascar', 'can', 'count', 'hairs', 'lion', 'mane', 'look', 'rather', 'bland', 'just', 'as', 'memorable', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'course', 'making', 'animals', 'stick', 'so', 'close', 'reality', 'really', 'awkward', 'moments', 'such', 'dance', 'chorus', 'wildebeast', 'yes', 'read', 'right.Once', 'animals', 'manage', 'get', 'Wild', 'Africa', 'rescue', 'cub', 'who', 'previously', 'spazzed', 'out', 'had', 'stupid', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'teenager', 'moment', 'become', 'embroiled', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'part', 'flat', 'film', 'wildebeast', 'lead', 'off-the', 'rocker', 'performance', 'William', 'Shatner', 'have', 'decided', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'prey', 'would', 'become', 'predator', 'eating', 'flesh', 'lions', 'Somehow', 'Nigel', 'koala', 'elevated', 'god', 'status', 'hoofed', 'dancing', 'other', 'craziness', 'along', 'spooky', 'volanco', 'scenes', 'None', 'very', 'well', 'feels', 'disjointed', 'film.The', 'Wild', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Adults', 'are', 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'little', 'found', 'be', 'ludicrous', 'boring', 'lacking', 'kind', 'movie', 'magic', 'Madagascar', 'definitely', 'better', 'film', 'rightfully', 'lauded', 'such', 'Wild', 'platter', 'leftovers', 'bland', 'warmed', 'over.With', 'being', 'said', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'asked', 'see', 'again', 'did', 'like', 'first', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'rental', 'entertain', 'kids', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'kid', 'friendly', 'movie', 'there', 'adults', 'will', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'do', 'meantime', 'Wild', 'flopped', 'tremendously', 'killed', 'off', 'studio', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'why']",The Wild
999277,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B000G75AZC,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","The first two minutes or so of The Wild are very promising. They have a very snappy, cartoony style, culminating in a 14,000 foot wildebeest, and you think to yourself that you unfairly overlooked what's actually an entertaining cartoon comedy. But then what is revealed to be a mere opening (Kung Fu Panda style) ends and we are drawn into the movie's actual world.If you are unfamiliar with the term ""uncanny valley"", it refers to creepiness of features being very realistic but noticeably off the mark. That's The Wild's look style in a nutshell. The animals look semi-realistic but the way in which they are not is very visually jarring. The character design is very unappealing all around, and this movie looked average even when it came out in 2006.The setting might seem at first glance like a complete rip-off of Madagascar. The setting, not the storyline, centering on a lion and his friends in Central Park Zoo. The conflict here is about Samson the celebrated lion being separated from his son Ryan, who runs away to the wild so he can overcome his total lack of a roar and thus live up to his father. The story about father and son is very touching and is definitely not to blame for this movie's shortcomings. Rather, how it's told is.Going back to Madagascar again, one of the strengths of those movies is that they know which characters are golden and keep us with them. Not the case with The Wild. Ryan's friends the kangaroo and hippo had potential, and so did the sports team penguins, masters in the zoo's preferred sport of curling (which the movie honestly does a good job at making look exciting). But they all vanish practically instantly when our main gang leave on their journey. Even more of a shame, the alligators (one of whom is on the poster) barely even register, let alone induce a chuckle. They just appear and then they are gone, and you could easily imagine their scene being cut. What a waste of characters with potential!It's not as though the main cast are strong characters. By far the most entertaining is Nigel the koala bear, hilariously voiced by Eddie Izzard. He's fed up with his popularity as a cute and cuddly koala bear plush, and his scatterbrained nature is the driving force for what little comedy the film can muster. The giraffe does nothing but complain all the way through, I was fed up with her quite quickly. Don't even get me started on the Dutch dung beetles, which stick out from this film's look style like a sore thumb but thankfully have even less screen time than the alligators.But what ultimately drags The Wild down is that its world is empty. Is anybody supposed to believe that New York City would ever be this empty, let alone Manhattan? They drive around, run around many streets, and there's just nobody there. Because it's nighttime? New York City is nicknamed the City that Never Sleeps, would some crowd simulations have hurt? There were lots of people in the zoo, so what's the excuse? This really kills one's believability in the film.What is in most regards a rather tame, pedestrian film is made even worse by squandering its few gold nuggets. The alligators get no time to be developed at all, and the hilarious special agent chameleons even can't save much. The biggest shame is that the visual and storytelling grandeur of the opening sequence is never touched upon again and upstages the feature presentation considerably. If that doesn't say something about what a missed opportunity The Wild is, I don't know what does.",2,A film of many missed opportunities,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3504,"['first', 'two', 'minutes', 'so', 'Wild', 'are', 'very', 'promising', 'have', 'very', 'snappy', 'cartoony', 'style', 'culminating', '14,000', 'foot', 'wildebeest', 'think', 'yourself', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'what', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'cartoon', 'comedy', 'then', 'what', 'revealed', 'be', 'mere', 'opening', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'style', 'are', 'drawn', 'movie', 'actual', 'world.If', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'term', 'uncanny', 'valley', 'creepiness', 'features', 'being', 'very', 'realistic', 'noticeably', 'mark', 'Wild', 'look', 'style', 'nutshell', 'animals', 'look', 'semi-realistic', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'visually', 'jarring', 'character', 'design', 'very', 'unappealing', 'movie', 'looked', 'average', 'even', 'when', 'came', 'out', '2006.The', 'setting', 'might', 'seem', 'first', 'glance', 'complete', 'rip-off', 'Madagascar', 'setting', 'not', 'storyline', 'centering', 'lion', 'friends', 'Central', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'conflict', 'here', 'Samson', 'celebrated', 'lion', 'being', 'separated', 'son', 'Ryan', 'who', 'away', 'wild', 'can', 'overcome', 'total', 'lack', 'roar', 'thus', 'live', 'up', 'father', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'very', 'touching', 'definitely', 'not', 'blame', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'Rather', 'how', 'told', 'is.Going', 'back', 'Madagascar', 'again', 'one', 'strengths', 'movies', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'golden', 'keep', 'Not', 'case', 'Wild', 'Ryan', 'kangaroo', 'hippo', 'had', 'potential', 'so', 'did', 'sports', 'team', 'penguins', 'masters', 'zoo', 'preferred', 'sport', 'curling', 'movie', 'honestly', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'look', 'exciting', 'vanish', 'practically', 'instantly', 'when', 'main', 'gang', 'leave', 'journey', 'Even', 'more', 'shame', 'alligators', 'one', 'whom', 'poster', 'barely', 'even', 'register', 'let', 'alone', 'induce', 'chuckle', 'just', 'appear', 'then', 'are', 'gone', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'scene', 'being', 'cut', 'What', 'waste', 'characters', 'potential', 'not', 'main', 'cast', 'are', 'strong', 'characters', 'far', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Nigel', 'koala', 'bear', 'hilariously', 'voiced', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'fed', 'up', 'popularity', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'koala', 'bear', 'plush', 'scatterbrained', 'nature', 'driving', 'force', 'what', 'little', 'comedy', 'film', 'can', 'muster', 'giraffe', 'nothing', 'complain', 'way', 'was', 'fed', 'up', 'quite', 'quickly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Dutch', 'dung', 'beetles', 'stick', 'out', 'film', 'look', 'style', 'sore', 'thumb', 'thankfully', 'have', 'even', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'alligators.But', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Wild', 'down', 'world', 'empty', 'anybody', 'supposed', 'believe', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'empty', 'let', 'alone', 'Manhattan', 'drive', 'around', 'run', 'around', 'many', 'streets', 'just', 'nobody', 'there', 'nighttime', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'nicknamed', 'City', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'would', 'crowd', 'simulations', 'have', 'hurt', 'were', 'lots', 'people', 'zoo', 'what', 'excuse', 'really', 'one', 'believability', 'film.What', 'most', 'regards', 'rather', 'tame', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'squandering', 'few', 'gold', 'nuggets', 'alligators', 'get', 'time', 'be', 'developed', 'hilarious', 'special', 'agent', 'chameleons', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'much', 'biggest', 'shame', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'grandeur', 'opening', 'sequence', 'never', 'touched', 'upon', 'again', 'feature', 'presentation', 'considerably', ""n't"", 'say', 'something', 'what', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Wild', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what']",The Wild

The animation is a totally different type. The animals look furry, except of course for the snake, who looks scaley. Rather than looking like drawings, they're more like animated stuffed animals.There's Samson (Kiefer Sutherland) the adult lion, his son Ryan (Greg Cipes), Benny (Jim Belushi) a squirrel, Bridget (Janeane Garofalo) a giraffe, and my favorite, Nigel (Eddie Izzard) a koala. There's also a snake, but I can't remember his name.William Shatner does the voice of an insane wildebeest named Kazar. But that's in Africa.Ryan is feeling depressed because he hasn't yet learned to roar. He's only a cub, but he hates it when he tries to roar and the people laugh at him. What's more, his father has told him all these exciting stories about when he lived in the wild and would frighten all the other beasts away just with the strength of his roar.He's been told to stay away from the Green Boxes, which are cargo containers that say something about Wild Life Rescue on the side. Of course, the animals can't read, but they know that the containers go off on a ship, and it has something to do with the wild. So Ryan stows away in one, although he regrets it almost as soon as the door is locked.So Samson decides he must go after him and rescue him, and of course all his friends must go along, even though he tries to leave them behind. They commandeer a Port Authority tug boat, and follow the ship Ryan is on all the way to Africa.Of course they get him back. But if I told you anything about the adventures they have in the process, it might ruin it for you. It's great fun.Yes, Nigel is definitely my favorite.

There's really nothing not to like about this whole movie - unless it's the relatively short running time (which is actually 81 minutes, despite what the listing here says).It's not easy growing up in the shadow of Samson the Wild (Kiefer Sutherland), especially if you're an eleven year old cub who has yet to find his roar.  Having heard all of his dad's stories about his heroic adventures out on the Serengeti, Ryan (Greg Cipes) feels like a failure and wonders if he will ever find his inner lion as long as he's living the comfortable life at the New York Zoo.  By the time he comes to his senses, though, he's stuck in a crate and on his way to the African wilderness.  Samson, of course, vows to rescue him, and his buddies Benny the squirrel (Jim Belushi), Nigel the koala (Eddie Izzard), Bridget the giraffe (Jeneane Garofalo), and Larry the snake (Richard Kind) tag along to help their friend in his time of need.  Making their way from the zoo to the docks, with the help of a couple of very funny crocodiles, they manage to take over a tugboat and make their way across the ocean.  Finding Ryan in the middle of a vast jungle is hard enough, but things get even more complicated when the group gets split up and a herd of wildebeest decide that the time has come to turn the food chain upside down.The movie does take a few weird turns along the way.  A squirrel with a crush on a giraffe is one thing, but dancing wildebeest led by a choreographer/prophet (William Shatner) is definitely on the weird side.  It's all very amusing, though.  Every animal gets his chance to shine, but Nigel has a habit of stealing the show as he battles against the image of koalas as lovable teddy bear types.While comedy abounds every step of the way, the movie also tells a meaningful story about family and friendship - and how one's pride (no pun intended) can get in the way of your most important relationships.  The incredible realism of the animation helps communicate the very human emotions that stand at the core of this story.  Obviously, I think The Wild succeeds extremely well on dramatic as well as comedic levels.

Unable to live up to his father's reputation, Ryan the lion handily escapes the zoo and parks his carcass in a ""green box"" to have a good pout.  Unfortunately, this soon puts him on a ship heading for some jungle near a volcano.  A pursuit follows allowing for several misadventures before a rescue can be put into effect.The animation style varies from the opening false start to the introduction of real looking yet not real looking animals.  The style of the snake Larry (voiced by Richard Kind) is especially problematic.  If you can get past this weirdness, the second problem is with the voice-actors.  Some tried to create voices for the characters (like William Shatner), some just used their own voice making it quite jarring to hear an odd looking lion sound exactly like Kiefer Sutherland.  At any rate, there was only one character (mainly due to the actor voicing him) that stood out in a positive fashion: Nigel the cute and cuddly koala (Eddie Izzard).  The rest were run of the mill, spare part characters barely discernible from any other cartoon featuring zoo animals on the loose.There is some occasional humor, the use of recognizable songs at awkward moments is a bit disconcerting, loved the chameleon covert agents.

The characters are well developed, have particularly querky personalities, and have quite an adventure ahead of them.  This is the story of a mismatched troop of animals living in the New York City Zoo, and particularly and Lion and his cub.  The father has lived in captivity most of his life and boasts of his ""wild adventures"" to his son.  His son discovers these adventures were actually only figments of his fathers imagination and sets out to escape the city zoo to find his roar and develop his instincts.  When his father discovers the escape, a full blown zoo escape follows to bring the cub back safely.  What an adventure these zoo animals have when they meet the animals of the city, and then later...the wild.  But, can the animals escape the wild in time to avoid the fatal volcano on the deserted island?  Our favorite character was the kowala bear, he's the mastermind of preplanning, only people don't listen to him.  That is, until a pack of wollabies unknowingly mistake him for their leader.  He relishes in this new position and must make a decision to live in his new life of empowerment, or rescue his friends.  You'll enjoy the sense of family protection and friendship this crew will impart on you, and fall in love with these adorable characters.  There's plenty of laughs, dancing and singing, even some drama for everyone's tastes.  I didn't give this a 5 star because it's much like the not-so-long-ago release of Madagascar and even much the same as Over The Hedge.

I wanted to see it for Eddie Izzard and for the fact that Madagascar stole their idea and got their film out first. How is this film going to be any different from Madagascar? Disney and Dream Works are in direct competition. The Wild was in production for quite sometime due to the fallout of Pixar and the discovery of a new animation team to finish the film. It just so happens that Madagascar was rushed and released before The Wild, making Disney look like the bad guy. That being said I have to be honest and say the two are similar..... By premise only. Both films obviously contain a group of animals escaping the New York Zoo to go to the wild. That alone leaves plenty of room for creativity and The Wild accomplishes just that. Some feel that this film should have gone straight to DVD because it was aimed at 5 year olds which isn't a bad thing but definitely not for the theater crowd and probably for the kid's parents.I have to admit that the story was a bit crazy and aloof at times but I got quickly over it. I enjoyed this film from beginning to end with my kids. Its quite good, full of jokes, has an amazing attention to detail and visually stunning. I actually found myself laughing at some parts of this film. Plus the movie includes morals and lessons to be learned for the kiddies. I did however LOVE Eddie's performance as Nigel. That really was one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie.The Wild didn't FEEL like a typical Disney movie, kind of like 'Home on the Range'. It's like Disney is trying to jump into the Shrek/Ice Age market. The problem is that I don't want that from Disney. They should seriously reconsider on sticking to the Lion King and Little Mermaid animation because that's what they do best. There's is nothing wrong on going back to your own roots and I believe a lot of parents would agree with me when I say that they should head back to ""Classic Disney.""Many are probably are reluctant to see this film given the timing.

Talking animals from an NYC zoo, ending up in an exotic foreign place, facing their fears to become better...talking animals. If this sounds familiar you may have already seen it DREAMWORKS' MADAGASCAR released less than a year ago. I'm not pointing fingers here, Disney has been supposedly working on this for 9 years, but THE WILD comes across as a ""second-hand lion,"" watered down and ""toothless.""The only differences, apart from the film and production company names, are style and voice casting. Whereas MADAGASCAR'S visual style is more cartoonish, THE WILD's approach is ultra-realistic in details.  While Madagascar had characters voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer, the voice casting for THE WILD is up to Disney's high standards: Respected leader SAMSON (guess HIS species) is voiced by Kiefer Sutherland , street savy Benny the Squirrel  by Jim Belushi, dim-witted Larry the Snake by Richard Kind (of ""the Producers"") and Janeane Garofalo as Bridget the Giraffe. Don Cherry, Canadian hockey announcer cameos as the penguin MC. One possible breakout character is Nigel the British kolala, voiced by Eddie Fizzard, trying to shed his cuddly image, later becoming idol to a pack of wildebeests along with their choreographing leader dancing to the beat of different drum, Kazar, voiced brilliantly-straight by William Shatner (who provides voice for another animated animal in the upcoming ""Over the Hedge."")The WILD'S Director Steve Williams and producer Clint Goldman helped to revolutionize CG character animation during their long association with ILM (""The Mask,""  ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Terminator 2""), and were responsible for the popular Blockbuster commercials featuring Carl the rabbit and Ray the guinea pig. The film is scored by Academy-nominated composer Alan Silvestri ( known for the"" Back to the Future Trilogy,"" and ""Polar Express""), the soundtrack is also filled with familiar tunes by such r recording artists EVERLIFE, COLDPLAY, LIFEHOUSE, and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Other new material provided by ex-""Monty Python"" member Eric Idle and fellow songwriter John Du Prez, the team responsible for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, ""SPAMALOT"" writing and performing the song, ""Really Nice Day"" for THE WILD.As the animals embark on a dangerous journey to rescue one of their own,  THE WILD, like its DREAMWORKS counterpart, is suitable for children with themes of teamwork, friendship and father-son relationships ( Samson's son's desire to get out of his father's shadow and have his own adventures).

999305,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000G75AZC,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","I really enjoyed ""The Wild,"" but I watched it feeling as if something was missing.  It lacked the magic that I've come to expect in Disney's theatrical releases.  Unlike ""The Lion King"" and ""Cinderella,"" it lacked the ""epic"" aspect.  Where ""Hercules"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" were laugh-out-loud funny, ""The Wild"" came across as a lukewarm comedy.  It has a wonderful cast of voices including Kiefer Sutherland (who has the warm, fatherly voice downpat), Jim Belushi, Eddie Izzard (who almost steals the show), and William Shatner.  It also has the reliable Patrick Warburton and Janeane Garofalo.  But for some reason, things just don't add up.  Not even the music is up to the same level as that of other Disney flicks released within the last two decades such as ""Tarzan"" and even ""Chicken Little.""The story is okay, though many have wrongfully compared it to ""Madagascar.""  In this particular tale, a gang of animals head into the wilds of New York City and Africa in order to find Samson's (Sutherland) son, Ryan, who was inadvertantly shipped off to Africa.  They have no intention on staying in the wild.  They just want Ryan home and safe again.  In ""Madagascar,"" the zebra wanted to go to the wild and stay there.  His friends were trying to get him to change his mind.  There's also a funny plot twist involving a herd of wildebeasts who are intent on taking over the top of the food chain.The animation is good, but it seemed as if the animators were at constant odds with whether or not they wanted this to be very realistic (such as in ""Dinosaur""), or funny (such as in ""Valiant"").Overall, this really is a fun film for the whole family, but it feels more like a direct-to-DVD Disney sequel than a Disney theatrical release.  It is more deserving of three-and-one-half stars than the three I gave it, but you may want to rent this before buying it.  I purchased it and have no regrets, but others may feel that it falls too short of the Disney standard to warrant buying.Mildly recommended.",3,A Roar More Akin To A Whimper,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,2009,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Wild', 'watched', 'feeling', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'lacked', 'magic', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Disney', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'Lion', 'King', 'Cinderella', 'lacked', 'epic', 'aspect', 'Where', 'Hercules', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'were', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Wild', 'came', 'lukewarm', 'comedy', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'voices', 'including', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'warm', 'fatherly', 'voice', 'downpat', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'who', 'almost', 'show', 'William', 'Shatner', 'also', 'reliable', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'reason', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'Not', 'even', 'music', 'same', 'level', 'other', 'Disney', 'flicks', 'released', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'such', 'Tarzan', 'even', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'story', 'okay', 'though', 'many', 'have', 'wrongfully', 'compared', 'Madagascar', 'particular', 'tale', 'gang', 'animals', 'head', 'wilds', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Africa', 'order', 'find', 'Samson', 'Sutherland', 'son', 'Ryan', 'who', 'was', 'inadvertantly', 'shipped', 'off', 'Africa', 'have', 'intention', 'staying', 'wild', 'just', 'want', 'Ryan', 'home', 'safe', 'again', 'Madagascar', 'zebra', 'wanted', 'go', 'wild', 'stay', 'there', 'friends', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'change', 'mind', 'also', 'funny', 'plot', 'twist', 'involving', 'herd', 'wildebeasts', 'who', 'are', 'intent', 'taking', 'over', 'top', 'food', 'chain.The', 'animation', 'good', 'seemed', 'animators', 'were', 'constant', 'odds', 'not', 'wanted', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'such', 'Dinosaur', 'funny', 'such', 'Valiant', '.Overall', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'more', 'direct-to-DVD', 'Disney', 'sequel', 'Disney', 'theatrical', 'release', 'more', 'deserving', 'three-and-one-half', 'stars', 'three', 'gave', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'buying', 'purchased', 'have', 'regrets', 'others', 'may', 'feel', 'too', 'short', 'Disney', 'standard', 'warrant', 'buying.Mildly', 'recommended']",The Wild

However, the movie follows a Disney trend in that the movie is more oriented for children than adults.  So, while there were parts of the movie that I enjoyed, in general my thought was, ""Ho, hum.""Samson the lion (Kiefer Sutherland) is the ""king"" of the zoo.  Samson is a leader at the zoo, and seems to always be in control and to know the right thing to do.  Son Ryan (Greg Cipes) is at that awkward age where he wants to be more like dad, but he still has a lot of experience to gain first.Ryan accidentally ends up in a truck trailer heading to Africa.  Samson, Benny the manic squirrel (Jim Belushi), Bridget the giraffe (Janeane Garofalo), Nigel the Koala (Eddie Izzard), and Larry the Snake (Richard Kind) mount a rescue mission to save Ryan.  The journey takes the group through the wilds of the city to the real wild of the African jungle, where they meet a crazy wildebeest named Kazar (William Shatner).  Troubles abound for the group as they face an array of animals and natural disasters while trying to return safely to their zoo home.The biggest problem this movie has is that it is a ""me too"" movie.  I have watched ""Ice Age"" movies, ""The Lion King,"" ""Happy Feet,"" and many more.  After a while, the whole ""animals off on a quest"" plot gets to be a little old.  Fortunately, there is enough comedy in this movie to keep this movie from being a waste of time.  Nigel the Koala is sarcastic and hilarious.  Larry the snake is dopey and adds a different kind of humor.  Benny is frenetic and typically funny.  The other positive thing is that this movie is very family friendly (as long as the adults can keep from nodding off).Since this movie is at the tail end of a long list of movies with similar themes, I am not sure what this movie could have done better, except being released a few years from now.  There is good comedy and characterizations.  The story is weak, but how complicated can you make a story about rescuing a child?  The child is lost, go find him and bring him home.  I hope that the current lengthy list of movies using animated animals will end.  Then I will pull this one back off the shelf and give it another chance.Good Luck!",3,Great for Kids; Parents Will Get a Laugh or Two,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2267,"['liked', 'movie', 'light', 'comedy', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'several', 'places', 'However', 'movie', 'Disney', 'trend', 'movie', 'more', 'oriented', 'children', 'adults', 'So', 'were', 'parts', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'general', 'thought', 'was', 'Ho', 'hum', 'Samson', 'lion', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'king', 'zoo', 'Samson', 'leader', 'zoo', 'always', 'be', 'control', 'know', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Son', 'Ryan', 'Greg', 'Cipes', 'awkward', 'age', 'where', 'be', 'more', 'dad', 'still', 'lot', 'experience', 'gain', 'first.Ryan', 'accidentally', 'up', 'truck', 'trailer', 'heading', 'Africa', 'Samson', 'Benny', 'manic', 'squirrel', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Bridget', 'giraffe', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Nigel', 'Koala', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Larry', 'Snake', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'mount', 'rescue', 'mission', 'save', 'Ryan', 'journey', 'group', 'wilds', 'city', 'real', 'wild', 'African', 'jungle', 'where', 'meet', 'crazy', 'wildebeest', 'named', 'Kazar', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Troubles', 'abound', 'group', 'face', 'array', 'animals', 'natural', 'disasters', 'trying', 'return', 'safely', 'zoo', 'home.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'too', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'Ice', 'Age', 'movies', 'Lion', 'King', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'many', 'more', 'while', 'whole', 'animals', 'off', 'quest', 'plot', 'be', 'little', 'old', 'Fortunately', 'enough', 'comedy', 'movie', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'waste', 'time', 'Koala', 'sarcastic', 'hilarious', 'Larry', 'snake', 'dopey', 'different', 'kind', 'humor', 'Benny', 'frenetic', 'typically', 'funny', 'other', 'positive', 'thing', 'movie', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'as', 'long', 'adults', 'can', 'keep', 'nodding', 'off', '.Since', 'movie', 'tail', 'end', 'long', 'list', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'being', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'good', 'comedy', 'characterizations', 'story', 'weak', 'how', 'complicated', 'can', 'make', 'story', 'rescuing', 'child', 'child', 'lost', 'go', 'find', 'bring', 'home', 'hope', 'current', 'lengthy', 'list', 'movies', 'using', 'animated', 'animals', 'will', 'end', 'Then', 'will', 'pull', 'one', 'back', 'shelf', 'give', 'chance.Good', 'Luck']",The Wild

They stay in their enclosure during the day, but at night they have the run of the zoo, hang out, and even play games with their friends.Ryan has a problem, however.  He hasn't developed his roar.  Samson has told him lots of stories about his life in ""The Wild,"" but they aren't helping Ryan.  Every time he tries, it sounds more like a cat then a lion.Fed up with not meeting his dad's expectations, he decides to stow away in a crate bound for Africa.

Helping him in his quest are Benny the Squirrel (Jim Belushi), Nigel the Koala Bear (Eddie Izzard), Bridget the Giraffe (Janeane Garofalo), and Larry the Snake (Richard Kind).Their quest takes them from the streets to New York to an island off the coast of Africa.

The movie is absolutely hysterical.  I watched it with a couple friends, and the three of us laughed the entire way through.  Yes, there are some absurd situations, but most of the humor comes from the snappy dialog.

Who knows who has had these ideas first (although apparently Pixar were copied in the earlier ones), but here we have 'The Wild' which is familiar to anyone who has seen last year's 'Madagascar'.I am not here to right a review on 'Madagascar' - which I thought was very disappointing - but it is difficult to not compare the two.Neither are entirely satisfactory, but 'The Wild' is slightly more successful. The animation is first-rate and is certainly the best non-Pixar CGI movie I have seen for animation quality. The script, however, is only half-baked with a great concept poorly done. The problem with 'Madagascar' was that once the animals were on the titular island, the story became quite dull coupled with the fact that we had to spend the entirity of the film in the company of four highly irritating 'heroes'. 'The Wild's' characters are slightly easier to relate to and more rounded (with the possible exception of the snake who is clearly only there for whenever they need a rope/catapult/whatever). The story also holds up better than its Dreamworks counterpart although the writers also struggle once the heroes reach their destination. The secondary plot of a mad wildebeest (voiced superbly by William Shatner) who wants to reverse the food-chain by eating a lion is only partially successful and really feels that it belongs in a more wacky movie (such as 'Madagascar' ironically). There is a terribly uneven tone throughout the film which almost points to a wackier film suddenly tried to be made serious, presumably once 'Madagascar' beat them to it. A real highlight though are the undercover chameleons who pop up near the end of the film to just about revive it.The vocal performances are mainly good with only Shatner and James Belushi as a street-smart squirrel really standing out. Eddie Izzard as Nigel the Koala is given too much rope and by the end of the film has worn out his welcome. Patrick Warburton, who must be contracted to star in every piece of animation made, makes his appearance here too.As is written elsewhere on these pages, there are many great parts to this film but it is far from a satisfactory whole and Disney is fortunate to have John Lassiter and his Pixar cohorts now training their staff how to make good films. It's simple really - start with a good script, work on it until it is perfect and then (and only then) animate it.

The plot, while in no danger of being mistaken for a masterpiece, goes something like this:Set in the NY City zoo, we meet Ryan is a young lion who wishes for little more than to go to the wild, where his father (Samson) once roamed. When he manages to get himself shipped to Africa, his distraught father and a ragtag group of zoo refugees work together to track him down and bring him back.Once the group reaches Africa, however, the animals find themselves in a world of real danger; the type only hinted of in stories and legends while in captivity. Add to the fact that a wildebeest cult leader named Kazar sees the coming of the felines as a sign from the powers-that-be and a volcano that's on the edge of eruption and the wild offers a lot more risks than these caged-critters bargained for.The Wild is a prime example of the simple fact that limitless budgets and a powerhouse brand name/ distribution network do not a good film make.  This is especially evident when you stop to consider the fact that when this film was being developed, Disney was amidst heated negotiations with Pixar, the likes of which had Pixar going as far as attempting to sever the relationship entirely.  The Diz was clearly doing all they could to prove that they still had a presence in the booming computer-animated feature arena (without Pixar if need be) while taking aim at Dreamworks' blockbuster Madagascar in the process.What results is a pretty lackluster movie with all of the theoretical ingredients of a masterpiece (a decent cast, nice textures and animation, catchy theme songs and so on) but a finished product that comes up feeling dull and heartless.Kids may find some value in the visuals and the few moments of slapstick surely included to get a rise, but it's difficult to avoid the reality that the plot struggles to find it's rhythm and fails to generate much enthusiasm in the few instances where it does.In conclusion The Wild is a bit too dry and cumbersome for young children to enjoy and definitely too blas&eacute; to attract and hold the interest of the adults who will certainly be in the vicinity of the children the film is targeted toward.  The pieces are all there but turning them into a complete puzzle is where Disney comes up short on this one.",3,More Fluff than Substance,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2659,"['talking-animal', 'genre', 'computer-generated', 'animation', 'scene', 'more', 'staple', 'empire', 'names', 'Open', 'Season', 'Hedge', 'Madagascar', 'have', 'earned', 'fair', 'share', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Disney', 'out', 'when', 'concept', 'realizing', 'potential', 'market.At', '94-minutes', 'Wild', 'actually', 'one', 'lengthier', 'animated', 'features', 'market', 'plot', 'danger', 'being', 'mistaken', 'masterpiece', 'something', 'Set', 'NY', 'City', 'zoo', 'meet', 'Ryan', 'young', 'lion', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'go', 'wild', 'where', 'father', 'Samson', 'once', 'roamed', 'When', 'get', 'shipped', 'Africa', 'distraught', 'father', 'ragtag', 'group', 'zoo', 'refugees', 'work', 'together', 'track', 'down', 'bring', 'back.Once', 'group', 'Africa', 'however', 'animals', 'find', 'world', 'real', 'danger', 'type', 'only', 'hinted', 'stories', 'legends', 'captivity', 'Add', 'fact', 'wildebeest', 'cult', 'leader', 'named', 'Kazar', 'coming', 'felines', 'sign', 'powers-that-be', 'volcano', 'edge', 'eruption', 'wild', 'lot', 'more', 'risks', 'caged-critters', 'bargained', 'for.The', 'Wild', 'prime', 'example', 'simple', 'fact', 'limitless', 'budgets', 'powerhouse', 'brand', 'name/', 'distribution', 'network', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'make', 'especially', 'evident', 'when', 'stop', 'consider', 'fact', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'Disney', 'was', 'amidst', 'heated', 'negotiations', 'Pixar', 'likes', 'had', 'Pixar', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'attempting', 'sever', 'relationship', 'entirely', 'Diz', 'was', 'clearly', 'doing', 'could', 'prove', 'still', 'had', 'presence', 'booming', 'computer-animated', 'feature', 'arena', 'Pixar', 'need', 'be', 'taking', 'aim', 'Dreamworks', 'blockbuster', 'Madagascar', 'process.What', 'results', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'movie', 'theoretical', 'ingredients', 'masterpiece', 'decent', 'cast', 'nice', 'textures', 'animation', 'catchy', 'theme', 'songs', 'so', 'finished', 'product', 'up', 'feeling', 'dull', 'heartless.Kids', 'may', 'find', 'value', 'visuals', 'few', 'moments', 'slapstick', 'surely', 'included', 'get', 'rise', 'difficult', 'avoid', 'reality', 'plot', 'find', 'rhythm', 'generate', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'conclusion', 'Wild', 'bit', 'too', 'dry', 'cumbersome', 'young', 'children', 'enjoy', 'definitely', 'too', 'blas', 'eacute', 'attract', 'hold', 'interest', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'vicinity', 'children', 'film', 'targeted', 'pieces', 'are', 'there', 'turning', 'complete', 'puzzle', 'where', 'Disney', 'up', 'short', 'one']",The Wild

Well, enter ""The Wild,"" which I had seen on the local library shelf.  Apart from some strange storyline--wildebeests about to eat lion meat for the first time because they were prodded to by William Shatner--there is absolutely nothing memorable about this movie.  It is a poor excuse for passing the time--and it definitely prevents naps.About the only redeeming feature in it, and I think that this is stretching it, is the fact that a child might begin to ask questions about 'the wild.'  Wilderness is indeed passing away before our eyes, and it might be a worthwhile exercise in environmental ethics to begin to communicate that to children.  However, the movie ends with, if I can remember the order of the drivel correctly, the animals turning back (willingly) for the zoo.Finally, it is with this movie that I began to realize something: the more Disney I see, the more the formula seems to come out.  Begin with animals that talk.  Create story-line about parent-child conflict.  Enter bad animals.  Friends who serve as comic relief waver because of weak characters or intellects.  Family triumphs over the bad animals and helps weak friends become strong.

999328,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000G75AZC,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","First thing I thought of while watching this new Disney animation `The Wild' is this: `Where is imagination?' The closest thing to the imaginative visuals or lovable characters found in the studio's glorious days of `Little Mermaid' and `Aladdin' is ... sorry, I can't think of anything. One send-up of New York's urban legend, perhaps. But that's not very funny, and the plot is a terrible one,  weak and even inconsistent.Despite its title, `The Wild' has nothing in it that makes us remember the wild imagination of other studios like Pixar or Ghibli. An adolescent lion named Ryan is accidentally sent from New York Zoo to somewhere in Africa, and his daddy Samson and animals follow the ship trying to get him back safe to his home. In this film Ryan and Samson quarrel over a trifling matter before Ryan leaves the zoo, but the instant Ryan is trapped in a cage, the cub gets so terrified, trying to go home. A cleverer story would make him a determined hero trying to leave the city and America too. That would be more reasonable and consistent with the title. But running away from home would not be Disney's favorite theme, I should know that.While Ryan has little to do after being sent to Africa, Samson and other animals -koala, giraffe, snake, and squirrel - remain largely boring characters. They are not particularly smart, but don't worry, they can find a small boat by chance (by most awkwardly presented coincidence); and they are not very funny. Sight gags here are not great, and neither are the set-pieces for actions. The film does them too earnestly, like someone trying to impress others with his old jokes.I may be wrong, but the biggest miscalculation on the filmmakers' side may be the computer graphic images of the film. Its colors are certainly terrific, have even photo-realistic quality, but its too realistic touch starts to lose its charms soon. The animation does not always have to be realistic, and sometimes need to abandon the realism to make more dynamic actions or movements. ""Cartoon"" is sometimes used as derogatory word, but the animated images should be often ""cartoon""-ish for the film to work as animation as classic animations like Tex Avery prove. The animals (especially the lions and koala) look too real, even scary for me, definitely less appealing than the characters in other animations like Lilo and Stitch.I didn't mention the name of `Madagascar' because I know I don't have to. You know that many reviewers have already pointed out the similarities, but didn't we enjoy both `Shrek and `Monsters Inc.'?

999329,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000G75AZC,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","In THE WILD, Ryan (Greg Cipes) is a young lion who lives in a New York City zoo with his father Samson (Keifer Sutherland). Fueled by stories of his father's adventurous youth, Ryan yearns to leave the zoo and travel to the wild to live the way his father lived. The trouble is that Samson is a creature born in captivity and only told Ryan those stories to keep him interested and make him proud of Dad. After a bitter dispute between father and son and purposefully disobedience, Ryan finds himself on a ship to Africa. Samson and his friends, which include a giraffe, koala bear, and a snake break out of the zoo, travel through the city, and board the ship carrying Ryan that is heading to Africa. Once there, they find themselves stranded and having to face evil, carnivorous wildebeests and an impending volcanic eruption. The king of the wildebeests, Kazar (William Shatner) doesn't want the animals to escape. If they don't the volcano will erupt and everyone is going to die a horrible death.THE WILD supports a strong and talented cast. From Keifer Sutherland to James Belushi to William Shatner, the filmmakers didn't skimp in getting good actors for the characters. I found the voices of the characters to be the most rewarding thing about the movie. However, the filmmakers must have spent most of their money on the voice talent because just about everything else in the film is two or three levels below par.Apparently, Disney had been working on versions of the screenplay all the way back to 1991. That much time and effort would leave one to believe that the story must be good. Unfortunately, that's not true. Whatever originality must have been lost in the process because other than wildebeests, koala bears, and a volcano THE WILD seems like a rip off of MADAGASCAR and a relatively poor one at that. If it is true that screenplay ideas were being written all the way back to 1991, then Disney should sue someone at Dreamworks for stealing their idea.It is true that THE WILD is a film that is slightly more appropriate for younger children than MADAGASCAR is. For instance, there aren't many jokes aimed at adult in THE WILD like there are in MADAGASCAR. For example, the overall tone and plot of the movie moves at a pace more akin to the mindset of a first grader. Also, the animation appeals more towards younger children than anyone else. Watching the film I couldn't help but think back to my childhood days in Sunday School when the teacher would illustrate a story with velcro board and velcro figures and items. That's kind of what the creatures in THE WILD look like. They look more like animated puppets than real-life creatures or great cartoon characters. The background animation in the movie is spectacular. The streets of New York are extremely detailed while the jungle scenery is lush and vivid. These brilliant backdrops, however, make the characters of the film seem even that much more out of place.Lastly, there is no real message in THE WILD. Not that every animated movie or even every movie geared towards kids has to have a message. However, for a movie that really doesn't have that great of a story, seems to be rip-off of a more popular picture, and one where the animated animals look like giant plush puppets, an important message could have improved the picture greatly.Young children will probably enjoy THE WILD and some of their parents probably will to (it is such a cute movie after all). Otherwise, you're probably better off leaving THE WILD on one of the shelves in the wilderness of the video store.

Whether this was coincidental or by design, the film takes on the path taken by Finding Nemo - Dad goes on a trip with friends to rescue naive truculent son who unwittingly gets himself into trouble for not heeding the elder's advise.There is really nothing new in the movie or particularly endearing save for the British disgruntled Koala Bear ""Nigel"". Now, Nigel, he's a scene stealer and an absolute delight! His wry sarcastic remarks and off-the-cuff wit is spot on! He's also, partially, the naive cutey who thinks he can take on the world thus endangering his friends who have to risk their hide just to pull him out of the trouble they shouldn't have gotten into but for him. If there's one thing going for this movie it's definitely got to be Nigel! His fumbling behaviour coupled with his laconic dialogue delivery is simply fabulous!The humor of the wild-beest is not much to snigger about much less guffaw at. It may be recommended for children who enjoy cartoons virtually unconditionally, but for the rest of us adult cartoon-lovers, this is definitely a pass.Skip this one.

999331,A19EV6UACAVC8C,B000G75AZC,V. Wong,"[2, 4]","For the record, even though the plot of The Wild has all too many similarities to that of Madagascar, I must note that The Wild - or Madagascar 2.0, as I like to think of it - is on an order of several magnitudes better.-Of course, let it be noted that some say work on The Wild was begun before Madagascar, and Madagascar was simply released first, while others say the Madagascar was begun first.-When originally viewing the commercials I wasn't impressed.  Like others, Madagascar was too fresh in my mind, and the comedic clips extracted seemed artificial and flat when taken out of context.  On viewing, I'm glad I gave it a second chance and allowed it to win me over.Sure, The Wild wasn't perfect; admittedly, I had a few of those cheesy cringe moments whenever the musical montages came on (I had far more during Madagascar - Chris Rock's character grated somethin' mightier than two lions at times)... as well as through most of the musical numbers.  There is the one huuuuuge plot hole in The Wild:  Tugboat... fuel?!.  Although a hoot in her own right, Janeane Garofalo's giraffe 'Bridget' is all too similar to Ellen DeGeneris' 'Dory' from Finding Nemo, one among many similarities to this film's aquatic Disney cousin.  The overall premise - even where it varies from Madagascar - is tired and predictable.  However, while the penguins are really the only reason I would buy Madagascar, I would actually consider purchasing this DVD...  Hey, you can't beat William Shatner - as the *villain* for once!  I was unexpectedly impressed with Shatner's characterisation and performance, and the special details he put into his voicing.The animation quality of the The Wild has miles on the first in terms of textures, realism, character design (I disliked the too-""stylised"" look of the characters and animation in Madagascar), and motion.  The script, dialogue, comedy, wit (all the tongue-in-cheek moments were keepers), plot, and characters too, are all vast improvements, with the possible exception of Madagascar's penguins.  The secret agent chameleons of The Wildcertainly give the penguins an excellent run for their money, though.  One more note about characters:  it is the secondary characters that really shine in this movie.  The chameleons are used in a very interesting way, given their abilities.  The villains of the film turn our notions of good and evil on their tails... or hoofs.  That is where The Wild shines the most.Measured purely by LOL moments, I found I had many more for this film but then again, I'm an adult viewing this film.  And... Oh... the rif at Canadians helping out Americans was one for the books.  That, and *curling*!  And as for crazy squirrels, if you liked Over the Hedge, you should quite enjoy this film.",5,"If you don't give this a chance due to Madagascar, you're really missing out.",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2759,"['record', 'even', 'plot', 'Wild', 'too', 'many', 'similarities', 'Madagascar', 'must', 'note', 'Wild', 'Madagascar', '2.0', 'like', 'think', 'order', 'several', 'magnitudes', 'better.-Of', 'course', 'let', 'be', 'noted', 'say', 'work', 'Wild', 'was', 'begun', 'Madagascar', 'Madagascar', 'was', 'simply', 'released', 'first', 'others', 'say', 'Madagascar', 'was', 'begun', 'first.-When', 'originally', 'viewing', 'commercials', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'others', 'Madagascar', 'was', 'too', 'fresh', 'mind', 'comedic', 'clips', 'extracted', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'flat', 'when', 'taken', 'context', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'second', 'chance', 'allowed', 'win', 'over.Sure', 'Wild', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'admittedly', 'had', 'few', 'cheesy', 'cringe', 'moments', 'whenever', 'musical', 'montages', 'came', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'Madagascar', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'character', 'grated', 'somethin', 'mightier', 'two', 'lions', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'huuuuuge', 'plot', 'hole', 'Wild', 'Tugboat', 'fuel', 'hoot', 'own', 'right', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'giraffe', ""'Bridget"", 'too', 'similar', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneris', ""'Dory"", 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'one', 'many', 'similarities', 'film', 'aquatic', 'Disney', 'cousin', 'overall', 'premise', 'even', 'where', 'Madagascar', 'tired', 'predictable', 'However', 'penguins', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'buy', 'Madagascar', 'would', 'actually', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'Hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'William', 'Shatner', '*villain*', 'once', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'impressed', 'Shatner', 'characterisation', 'performance', 'special', 'details', 'put', 'voicing.The', 'animation', 'quality', 'Wild', 'miles', 'first', 'terms', 'textures', 'realism', 'character', 'design', 'disliked', 'too-', 'stylised', 'look', 'characters', 'animation', 'Madagascar', 'motion', 'script', 'dialogue', 'comedy', 'wit', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'moments', 'were', 'keepers', 'plot', 'characters', 'too', 'are', 'vast', 'improvements', 'possible', 'exception', 'Madagascar', 'penguins', 'secret', 'agent', 'chameleons', 'Wildcertainly', 'give', 'penguins', 'excellent', 'run', 'money', 'though', 'One', 'more', 'note', 'characters', 'secondary', 'characters', 'really', 'shine', 'movie', 'chameleons', 'are', 'used', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'given', 'abilities', 'villains', 'film', 'turn', 'notions', 'good', 'evil', 'tails', 'hoofs', 'where', 'Wild', 'most.Measured', 'purely', 'LOL', 'moments', 'found', 'had', 'many', 'more', 'film', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'adult', 'viewing', 'film', 'Oh', 'rif', 'Canadians', 'helping', 'out', 'Americans', 'was', 'one', 'books', '*curling*', 'crazy', 'squirrels', 'liked', 'Hedge', 'should', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'film']",The Wild
