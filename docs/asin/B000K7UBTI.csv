I hate scrolling to the reviews section, and seeing anything but reviews.  Instead I find silly stupid aliterate people giving poor ratings to things for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual product!!So, I decided to give this 5 stars, to offset all the negative ""reviews"".  First off, I know this is animated.  I can clearly see that it says it is animated on the box, twice even on the front!  Also, I do not see the names of Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Favrue (?).  Third, I do see animated/cartoon picture stills from the movie on the back of the box (for those that can see it live).  That being said, it was a good movie, not only for an animated Iron Man story, but for one of Marvel's early attempts at the direct to video animated market (trailing behind DC, but quickly catching up, and maybe even surpassing).In my opinion, Marvel tried to re-introduce Iron Man for the modern age.

1031206,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B000K7UBTI,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[3, 3]","Never again will I be seduced by a film's cover. This 2D animated flick is a mismatched, generic little thing that's neither a satisfying story nor does it actually give us its main selling point - Iron Man. I'll elaborate.This film is called The Invincible Iron Man, but a more accurate title would be Iron Man vs the Elementals. Set in China for the most part, our hero Tony Stark has to stop four elemental spirits from collecting a set of rings before they raise an evil deity, the Mandarin. Gee, sound familiar, doesn't it? Meanwhile, he must also contend with S.H.I.E.L.D., who are after him on a false lead of weapons trading with the Chinese. Tony's first and foremost ambition is to save a woman who has an uncanny connection with the whole thing.The story of this movie is a generic mess that falls apart messily in the third act. It's a weird mishmash of Iron Man's origins (kidnapped by an organization and builds a suit to escape, this time when Iron Man ALREADY EXISTS!) with some supernatural jargon that Iron Man really feels awkward being in the same pot as. The most severe problem is the fact that Iron Man, as Iron Man, barely even appears. His classic red-and-gold armour? It appears in one scene only. That's right, the rest of the time he appears as prototype, grey or yellow Iron Man. Yet even they are very thriftily spared to the audience. This movie promises us Iron Man, then doesn't deliver.Not even the Mandarin can save things. A force to be reckoned with in the comics and Iron Man animated series, here he barely even appears and, to add insult to injury, is amazingly easy to defeat!The Invincible Iron Man is a poor, mismatched movie that looks especially sloppy and uninspired following the release of The Avengers (which, even though it is a live action movie of which Iron Man is only part, features twice as much Iron Man as this film does).

1031209,A1STJE8KFRWK3S,B000K7UBTI,Brian Glass,"[36, 46]","I'm going to take the con side of this debate.  Having not really read many comics in the past 20 years or so I really haven't followed any of the Ultimates stuff.  I have had it explained to me by a co-worker that's a big comic buff.  It seems to make sense to update some heros' origins.  After all Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan would be in their ninties these days.  I understand that they are also keeping the original origins in place which is fine.  Having said that, I don't know if this is an Ultimate storyline or not but I didn't care for it at all.Taken as a stand alone movie, if viewed by someone with no idea of who Iron Man is, this is really run of the mill.  Tony Stark wasn't a very cohesive character.  As far as alter-egos go this one is kind of a hypocritical milksap.  He makes a big deal out of not building weapons but has an entire room full of indestructible power armor.  If the suits are for research why the need for powerful lasers and missles?  The writer's seem to face the same dilemma most of Hollywood finds itself in these days.  It's politically incorrect to endorse violence but you still have to give the audience a good action packed fight scene.  As a result you get unrealistic portrayals of altruistic millionaire industrialists and pacifists with more weapons than Dirty Harry.  I may be reading a little too much into a cartoon but the level of some of the violence here (one person gets executed with a gunshot to the back of the head) suggests this is for a mature audience.  If this is the case the writers should have given the actions and motivations more depth.The biggest problem is the time it takes to actually get to Iron Man.  Once there the fight scenes are few and far between.  The film suffers from the same problem a lot of live action superhero movies suffer from, too much screen time for the alter-ego.  The action sequences are lacking visual impact.  I think that is partly due to the mediocre quality of the animation.  The CG doesn't mix too badly with the hand drawn but it's all just servicable at best.In the end the movie seemed overly long and convulted with the end being a less than satisfying resolution.

This is not at the level of the Bruce Timm produced animations, but it's still a very nice script and the adaptations to the Iron Man mythos are not objectionable.  Without giving away any plot information, Iron Man's origin story is generally preserved but Rhodey and the Mandarin play central roles.  It was actually quite clever the way the Chinese setting is worked into the story since Stan Lee's original origin story would be politically incorrect and dated today.  The usually tedious process of presenting an origin story before you can start the movie story is completely eliminated here.  The ""new"" origin is actually an interesting story itself and drives the plot.  My take here is that the old comics fans will like this and new comics fans will like it too.  Pleasing both extremes is a tough task but I think they have accomplished it.  I hope the next movie has as tight and complete a script as this one.  I'd love to see a big-budget animated project, but with good writing, this level of production is just fine.

The 1990's series was well-done and even the youngster version on now (IRONMAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES) are both worth seeing.  Unfortunately, that's not the case with this DVD/Blu-Ray (I have the regular DVD).  Considering how well the IRONMAN movie did, this animated version was a big disappointment.First, the origins of Ironman theme is slow building.  Second, the main battle in the film seems to be corporate subterfuge.  Third, you really never see or hear from The Mandarin, just a ghostly apparition at the end.  I'm not even crazy about the animation/artwork in this film, although that was the least of my concerns.  Their just isn't enough of Ironman or action in this DVD/BR to make it worth the purchase.  Rental?  Maybe.  Or maybe best to just wait for it to show up on one of the cartoon channels on cable/satellite.I have yet to check out some of the other MARVEL Comics DVDs/BRs but the reviews there seem to be much better.  But I can't see this DVD as one that either IRONMAN fans or MARVEL fans will be happy with.  I think it is the classic DVD that you watch once and then watch it collect dust for the next few years.  If you want some recent animated releases that will have you watching and re-watching after you've seen it initially, try the SUPERMAN/BATMAN PUBLIC ENEMIES or GREEN LANTERN:  FIRST FLIGHT Blu-Ray's.  Both have plenty of action, good storylines, great story arcs faithful to the comics or recent animated shows, and animation that is translates very well for HDTV/Blu-Ray.

The CGI used on the Elementals and all the Iron Man armors is cool.  It really adds to the fight scenes.  What I really found interesting was the whole technology vs. magic theme.  It was always weird to me that The Mandarin, a mostly magic using villain, was Iron Man's nemesis in the comics.  But I think this was Marvel's chance to show this kind of a story.  For the Iron Man live action movie due out in 2008, director Jon Favreau has stated that his take on The Mandarin will be more tech than magic.

The story and character development is above-par, but the absolutely horrible computer graphics bring down the entire film.  It starts with Stark Industries, despite having been warned against doing so, using breakthrough technology to raise an ancient (and cursed) city in China.  This fulfills an ancient curse and releases elemental demons.  Tony Stark is captured by Chinese rebels and forced to design a weapon capable of leveling the city once again.  Following Stark's origin, he builds Iron Man armor to escape.  In order to defeat these mystical monsters he is responsible for releasing, Tony Stark must become the Invincible Iron Man and find a way to save the world.As it stands, Invincible Iron Man has strengths but some serious weaknesses. Tony Stark is well handled pretty well here, though still cannot touch the amazing work done by Robert Downey Jr.  The female lead is quite good and her story arc is touching; introducing an Asian cultural theme of family duty that most Americans, especially Tony Stark, cannot comprehend.  The overall plot is serviceable, but the villains rather underwhelming, especially because of the terrible inconsistency between animation and cgi.  Most of the film is traditionally animated, but the villains, (and Iron Man himself during some of the fights), are done with very cheesy cel animation.  Maybe it would've been impressive in, idk, the 90's?  Saying it looks like a cut-scene from an original X-Box game would be insulting the X-box.This honestly could have been one of the better films, but the animation is just so horrible that it hijacks the entire film.  There's some great character work with Tony Stark and the overall storyline is serviceable.  If you're a hardcore fan and don't mind your fight scenes looking like something out of The Sim's, then you'll probably enjoy Invincible Iron Man.

Am I the only one who expect's these movies to be true to their respected books?  Why do these big shot movie exec's need to mess with the stories?  I say if it ain't broke don't fix it.I understand that in live action films things don't always translate from the page to the screen & things need to be tweaked here & there to look & fit right; I understand that, really I do.  What I don't get is how you go to make some big budget(or call it that anyway)animated feature & then change around the story.  Why!?!?!?  You're animating, you're simply bringing those characters to life with movement.  It ain't the story that needs to be fixed obviously since the character has been alive & well for 50 years now.  How do you screw up something like ""Iron Man"" for gods sake?Once again Marvel (Avi Arad) has given Lionsgate permission to take a beloved character & run it through the mud.  They've slapped a PG13 rating on something that at best a toddler might need a couple minutes of parental guidance.  The story is so dull long & drawn out a child probably wouldn't sit through the movie, that's probably where the PG13 came from.  We get the same shotty animation we saw in ""Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2"" mixed with poor CGI to try & cover up the shotty animation.  The animation is so bad that when there's character movement the picture blurs, that's how inconsistent this ""state of the art"" animation this really is.  I felt like I was watching a 90 minute episode of that god awful ""Iron Man"" cartoon from a few years ago.  Why was it necessary to make this film?  We're gonna get what I can only guess will be a much more superior live action film in '08 starring Robert Downey Jr & directed by John Favreau.

I could have tolerated a little tinkering with the standard origin, but what they came up with runs so contrary to what the Iron Man comic has been about that it's almost a slap in the face. For a hero and comic that's so concerned with the technological, to watch the storyline just kind of decompose into hokey mumbo jumbo while almost 44 years of history aren't just tossed to the side, but into the dirt, that's hard for me to swallow.The fact is, the story wasn't just different, it was BAD. The pacing was awful, and honestly, the only parts really worth watching are the battle sequences (minus the awful non-event that is the ""Mandarin"" face-off). I was pleased with the Ultimate Avengers movies, I thought they portrayed Iron Man well, and while they didn't really portray either Ultimate Iron Man or classic Iron Man exactly right, as the character was more or less an amalgamation of the two, he was much closer than this take on him, which basically has him with this emo-angst, I have to prove something to daddy thing. Howard should have been left DEAD.So to sum it up. What I thought was WRONG about Iron Man:1) Hokey, mumbo-jumbo filled story that ignores Tony Starks genius and reduces him to merely a reactionary shell of the comic character.2) Howard Stark...alive.3) Rhodey...a wimp (Army medic? COME ON!!!).4) Pepper Potts...BRITISH?!? Was that to add a touch of class?5) Mandarin...a GHOST?!? An emperor from some obscure Chinese Dynasty? Bleh...6) A dragon that ISN'T Fin Fang Foom...7) Iron Man using a sword (BTW, the 'prophecy' angle is tired and lame)!8) A final 'battle' that is a non-event. Tony's whining throughout was particularly grating...9) Too much time in the clunky origin armor (with all those other armors supposedly already made, including the Ultimate armor, and we get the Shellhead?).10) Ignoring Tony's character. Now everyone thinks if you do a few cheesy pickup lines and have him drink some booze, you've nailed him. Where is the intelligence? Where is the wit? Where are the one-liners and critical thinking from the past? He's a genius (except when it comes to women)...treat him as one.I'm stopping at 10...This movie is poor.

1031245,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000K7UBTI,Mel Odom,"[17, 22]","THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN retcons the Iron Man mythos to a degree.  Given that Tony Stark was originally wounded in Vietnam in the 1960s and he would have been in his sixties, something had to be done.  So the creators brought the story into ""now"" and still maintained an Asian flavoring by setting Iron Man up against the Mandarin, one of Shellhead's oldest and coolest foes.Die-hard purists are going to be disappointed in some aspects of the film, but it delivers enough action and characterization to get the job done.  Strangely, though, we don't really get to know that much about Tony or his relationship with his dad, Howard Stark.  We don't even get to know anything about why he created the Iron Man armor when he plainly states in the movie that he's never invented weapons.  The Iron Man armor has been compared to a human-sized F16 fighter jet loaded to the gills with munitions and destructive power.  Not to mention all the other cool, on-board technology.The plot centers on Tony's efforts to help China raise a sunken city to engender goodwill that results in very profitable trade agreements.  However, the Jade Dragons -- a local group -- have attacked the dig site on a number of occasions to stop the city's recovery.  But Stark's technology is successful and the city returns to the surface.  Unfortunately, that return also heralds of the mystical forces that will ultimately resurrect the Mandarin.I'm not sure if pitting a technology-based hero against the supernatural was a good idea for a first Iron Man movie.  For the fans like me, it wouldn't have been that much of a reach bccause we'd all be familiar with the Mandarin (though I'm pretty sure the comics alluded to the fact that the Mandarin's rings were alien tech at one point and not mystical).  But newcomers might be expected to see a technology versus technology battle, and that's really lacking here.I didn't like the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was onstage mainly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.  Nick Fury and his agents are some of my favorite characters.There was a lot to like about the straight-to-DVD presentation, though.  The use of CGI animation throughout the film was good, and so were the action sequences.  One of the other BIG pluses was that a LOT of the other Iron Man armor was shown.  The specialized deep-sea armor took center stage during one battle.  And many of the other suits were on display.Some of the scenes felt rushed, and plot development was thin.  The Mandarin was late in getting into the mix, though the four Elementals working on his behalf were there, and never quite came to fruition as a real threat.But the chance to see Iron Man onscreen in your living room is just too good to pass up.  Buy this one for comic geeks' night, or for the kids.  Then have a seat with your friends or your children, and get down to a night of superheroing Iron Man style.",4,Rebooting Iron Man,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2951,"['INVINCIBLE', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'Iron', 'Man', 'degree', 'Given', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'was', 'originally', 'wounded', 'Vietnam', '1960s', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sixties', 'something', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'creators', 'brought', 'story', 'now', 'still', 'maintained', 'Asian', 'flavoring', 'setting', 'Iron', 'Man', 'up', 'Mandarin', 'one', 'Shellhead', 'oldest', 'coolest', 'foes.Die-hard', 'purists', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'aspects', 'film', 'enough', 'action', 'characterization', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Strangely', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'that', 'much', 'Tony', 'relationship', 'dad', 'Howard', 'Stark', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'know', 'anything', 'why', 'created', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armor', 'when', 'plainly', 'movie', 'never', 'invented', 'weapons', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armor', 'been', 'compared', 'human-sized', 'F16', 'fighter', 'jet', 'loaded', 'gills', 'munitions', 'destructive', 'power', 'Not', 'mention', 'other', 'cool', 'on-board', 'technology.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Tony', 'efforts', 'help', 'China', 'raise', 'sunken', 'city', 'engender', 'goodwill', 'results', 'very', 'profitable', 'trade', 'agreements', 'However', 'Jade', 'Dragons', 'local', 'group', 'have', 'attacked', 'dig', 'site', 'number', 'occasions', 'stop', 'city', 'recovery', 'Stark', 'technology', 'successful', 'city', 'returns', 'surface', 'Unfortunately', 'return', 'also', 'heralds', 'mystical', 'forces', 'will', 'ultimately', 'resurrect', 'Mandarin.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'pitting', 'technology-based', 'hero', 'supernatural', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'much', 'reach', ""'d"", 'be', 'familiar', 'Mandarin', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'comics', 'alluded', 'fact', 'Mandarin', 'rings', 'were', 'alien', 'tech', 'one', 'point', 'not', 'mystical', 'newcomers', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'see', 'technology', 'versus', 'technology', 'battle', 'really', 'lacking', 'here.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'was', 'onstage', 'mainly', 'bad', 'guys', 'least', 'opposing', 'force', 'face', 'time', 'put', 'more', 'positive', 'spin', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'agents', 'are', 'favorite', 'characters.There', 'was', 'lot', 'like', 'straight-to-DVD', 'presentation', 'though', 'use', 'CGI', 'animation', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'were', 'action', 'sequences', 'One', 'other', 'BIG', 'pluses', 'was', 'LOT', 'other', 'Iron', 'Man', 'armor', 'was', 'shown', 'specialized', 'deep-sea', 'armor', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'one', 'battle', 'many', 'other', 'suits', 'were', 'display.Some', 'scenes', 'felt', 'rushed', 'plot', 'development', 'was', 'thin', 'Mandarin', 'was', 'late', 'getting', 'mix', 'four', 'Elementals', 'working', 'behalf', 'were', 'there', 'never', 'quite', 'came', 'fruition', 'real', 'threat.But', 'chance', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', 'living', 'room', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'Buy', 'one', 'comic', 'geeks', 'night', 'kids', 'Then', 'have', 'seat', 'friends', 'children', 'get', 'down', 'night', 'superheroing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'style']",Invincible Iron Man
1031246,AYKEN16NIUW9M,B000K7UBTI,"M. Grant ""MacGyver of the Books""","[6, 8]","I am clueless how anyone can claim to enjoy The Invincible China-Man (I mean Iron Man).  This movie was just pure garbage.Where to begin?  How about the box that clearly shows a Red-Yellow Armored Iron Man battling the Mandrin.  YEAH!  That never happens any where in the movie.  Instead we get Iron-Man trapsing around the globe gathering up the rings of the Mandarin before his Elementals (the weak excuse of a lazy writer to choose 4 villains with element powers) can reach them.  I think I saw this exact same plot in one of the G.I. Joe cartoons from the 1980's.So much of the movie is spent on the completely unimportant story of Li Mei that I was beginning to question whose movie this truly was.  The movie is 80-minutes.  About 77-minutes leads to the build up of the appearance of the Mandarin.  And when he shows up does he battle Iron-Man?  Not really.  He throws him around until Li Mei has the power to defeat him.  PLEASE!  Did the makers of this movie want us to feel it had much of a connection to Iron-Man?  THE Iron-Man!  Marvel Comic's Iron-Man!I could rant all day long but suffice to say that the movie is PG-13.  Now understand it is NOT for kids.  Unless you want your kid to see Tony Stark in a hot tub with a woman (naked), Tony showering (naked) in front of Pepper his secretary, Li Mei remembering the time she tried to commit suicide by looking at her wrist scars, and a man slapping a woman around because she's not a Man-Child.  Of course, the movie isn't really for an adult with any semblance of intelligence because the plot is dull, the music LAME-O, Iron-Man battling a dragon shouldn't be the focus...fighting the Mandarin should be the focus, most of it feels childish, and it's just NOT a good movie nor one that should be connected to the Marvel Comics character.  Marvel needed to make a simple decision is this for KIDS or ADULTS.  They failed for both markets.I hated this DVD!

1031247,A16XRPF40679KG,B000K7UBTI,Michael Dobey,"[1, 5]","This is the animated iron man.  A movie; which like the live action movie can trace it's origins to the classic marvel comic book. Those early stories have been reprinted in the hardcover marvel masterworks seriesand are worth reading.  The movie was NOT put out as a bait and switch manuever , this movie was at the theaters a year before the live action movie as part of the marvel comics animated series.  Doctor Strange and the Avengers have also been put out this way on blu ray.  But I can understand if you bought this without seeing the box that you would be upset. Anyways the live action movie was closer to what the comics where than this movie is and that's not a good thing.  The mandarin is a classic iron man villian, who is not some ancient creature with powers but a man from asia who leads a crime organization and has powerful weapon rings. This animated story goes off into a mythological story that would have fit doctor strange better. Iron mans foes are more down to earth types like the crimson dynamo and others; not mythalogical creatures.  In spite of that the movie is entertaining and on blu ray it looks great.  I just wish that they would stick closer to the original comics and not stray from what made the iron man stories so classic.  Iron man fights solid powerful villians who use technology to make weapons and armor mainly.  At least that's what he mainly fought!  The Mandarin used technology to battle iron man not magic.  Nuff said.  So if you want a decent animated movie that strays some but still has some solid thrills then you may like this flick.",3,not the live movie but this one came out on blu ray before the other one.,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1593,"['animated', 'iron', 'man', 'movie', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'can', 'trace', 'origins', 'classic', 'marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'early', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'reprinted', 'hardcover', 'marvel', 'masterworks', 'seriesand', 'are', 'worth', 'reading', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'put', 'out', 'bait', 'switch', 'manuever', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'year', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'part', 'marvel', 'comics', 'animated', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Strange', 'Avengers', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'way', 'blu', 'ray', 'can', 'understand', 'bought', 'seeing', 'box', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'Anyways', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'closer', 'what', 'comics', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'mandarin', 'classic', 'iron', 'man', 'villian', 'who', 'not', 'ancient', 'creature', 'powers', 'man', 'asia', 'who', 'crime', 'organization', 'powerful', 'rings', 'animated', 'story', 'off', 'mythological', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'doctor', 'strange', 'better', 'Iron', 'foes', 'are', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'types', 'crimson', 'dynamo', 'others', 'not', 'mythalogical', 'creatures', 'spite', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'blu', 'ray', 'great', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'stick', 'closer', 'original', 'comics', 'not', 'stray', 'what', 'made', 'iron', 'man', 'stories', 'so', 'classic', 'Iron', 'man', 'fights', 'solid', 'powerful', 'villians', 'who', 'use', 'technology', 'make', 'weapons', 'armor', 'mainly', 'least', 'what', 'mainly', 'fought', 'Mandarin', 'used', 'technology', 'battle', 'iron', 'man', 'not', 'magic', 'Nuff', 'said', 'So', 'want', 'decent', 'animated', 'movie', 'still', 'solid', 'thrills', 'then', 'may', 'like', 'flick']",Invincible Iron Man
1031248,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000K7UBTI,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","Billionaire playboy Tony Stark is critically injured and taken prisoner by a Chinese cult determined to reverse his unearthing of an ancient city prophesied to bring about the return of the dreaded Mandarin. With the help of his best friend, Rhodey, his damaged heart is made functional again, so to speak, and he creates a suit of armor that is a technological wonder. Later, pursued by the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for selling weapons to the Chinese radicals, he secretly becomes the superhero Iron Man in order to stop the rise of Mandarin by destroying his four elemental demons before they can retrieve the five rings that will make him whole again. But Tony is also fighting to help a confused young woman named Li Mei who is caught up in the struggle.From Marvel Comics and Lionsgate, ""The Invincible Iron Man"" is another direct-to-DVD film in Marvel's new line of animated features, this one conveniently preceding a new live-action film starring Robert Downey, Jr. which comes out tomorrow (as I write this review). Both Marvel and DC have gotten into the direct-to-video animated features arena, and for many fans of their classic characters this is a great thing. Of course, modernizing these beloved characters and stories and recreating them a bit for a new, wider audience doesn't sit too well with some of the diehard comic fans (who should really watch Mark Hamill's ""Comic Book: The Movie"" if they haven't already) that are set in their ways about how they feel these characters must be portrayed. To a certain degree, this is understandable, but then you have the folks who gripe about every little change and update. Anyway, another problem had, particularly with animated features here in the States, is this desire to cater to a more adult audience, but at the same time, the notion that animated features must be targeted to kids too (Fact is, here in the States there are still a lot of dummies who think that if it's animated or comic book related, it should be totally aimed at kids and adults should have no interest in it). There is a difficulty in figuring out how to make something that is in that middle area for action and violence oriented subject matter, largely because kid material nowadays is expected to be so unthreatening and cheeseball. And this film, like so many other American animated features meant to be edgy the way so much Anime is, suffers from that problem a bit. Though the plot has some adult angles to it (which sometimes feel rather forced), the whole ""get the rings before the bad guys do"" has a sort of kiddie Anime feel to it (even though I admit they do that sort of thing on Smallville all the time), and the lack of explanation of Tony Stark's anti-gun attitude gives the impression that he just feels that way because he's a ""good guy"", and good guys have to be anti-gun. It's also a bit convenient that Tony has been developing his Iron Man project for years before the real ""origin"" in this film. Elements like this do make one feel they are watching a film aimed at kids. But then you have implied sex and a hostage being shot in the head in the same film, so it's all rather unbalanced. It seems the filmmakers wanted this movie to be for young adults, so I just wish they'd worked on the story and writing a bit more to be more consistent with that idea. I also was bothered that a lot of this film's take on Stark gives me various Batman flashbacks, including boardroom scenes that feel they are right out of ""Batman Begins"" (my favorite superhero movie, by the way). Still, overall, this is a decent superhero film. I don't think folks who are new to the story of Iron Man will have much to complain about except that maybe it drags a bit. In other words, there could/should be a lot more Iron Man action. It's a bit slow to get going and the characters could be a bit less wooden. To me, DC still holds the crown when it comes to animation, and they have since the fantastic Batman the Animated Series of the '90's. As for the animation of ""The Invincible Iron Man,"" it has good moments and bad moments, but the integration of CGI is excellent and used on just the right things (I've long wanted to see some Star Wars animated films with a 2D/CGI mix along these lines, and we sorta got that with the Clone Wars, though I was more interested in post-Jedi stuff, but now they are going to go entirely with goofy looking CGI). I thought the music here was pretty good most of the time, as was the voice acting, but the characters could have been more likable and the plot a bit more involving and less condescending. It was pretty good nevertheless, but I have a feeling the bigscreen, live-action film is going to be much better. This is one worth owning if you are an animation, superhero, or Iron Man fanatic, but it's not likely to blow you away, and clearly many comic fans had a problem with the villain, Mandarin, only appearing for the final battle and only in a spirit form inhabiting one of the characters.The DVD is decent in the extras department, by the way. It gives us the Origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making-of program), a great informational gallery of Iron Man's various suits of armor, a concept art show, and a pretty cool alternate opening sequence. There is also quite a lengthy look at the opening of the new ""Doctor Strange"" animated feature. If you like this one, you'll surely want to pick up Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2, plus that new Doctor Strange flick, which I haven't seen but looks to have even better visuals than the previous titles. I also highly recommend Superman: Doomsday and Justice League: The New Frontier, not to mention the upcoming Batman: Gotham Knight (though be forewarned, that one is real Anime).",3,"It's pretty good,

An ancient evil called the Mandarin has been unleashed, and only Tony Stark can stop it before it destroys the world.I like this one better than the two Ultimate Avengers efforts, though it's still lacking in certain respects. On the positive side, I like how the film doesn't feel compelled to show us the modern Iron Man armor until late into the movie. It's a gutsy move, and ultimately makes me respect the character history just a little more. The Mandarin is also an interesting choice for a first villain in that old 'science vs. magic' way. The elementals make for cool visuals.Really though, I just don't find myself caring for Tony Stark much. The script's attempts at giving him character come off as forced, and overall I just found Stark and his problems kind of bland. It seems to be the trend with all of Marvel's animated features, especially compared to the stronger DC Justice League material. When the character is weak, the story is weak. And when the story is weak, the bland animation doesn't help much either.The DVD comes with some featurettes that cover Iron Man's history, and also some interviews from the creative team.

1031260,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000K7UBTI,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[2, 5]","Wastrel billionaire playboy Tony Stark flies to China when his top employee and best friend is kidnapped by a group of modern day ninjas.  The ninjas are trying to stop a Stark Enterprise-funded raising of an ancient Chinese city and, potentially, the re-animation of a fabled evil-doer named the Mandarin.People are taking their comic book heroes very serious nowadays, and this shot-for-video includes a helpful ""The Origins of Iron Man"" featurette that more or less clears up the things I'd forgotten about ol' Shellhead.  Just in time, too, since a big screen, live-action movie is planned for release in the summer of 2008 - a little over a year from when this review was written.  Anyway, in the original origin story Tony Stark was injured while in Vietnam, shrapnel in or near his heart or something like that, and he needed an iron lung-type medical device to stay alive.  In INVINCIBLE IRON MAN they drop Vietnam, keep Asia, the chest wound and the custom-cut iron suit.  The other big change in the story, according to the featurette (and some less-than-happy blog postings I've read recently) is the Armor Room, hidden deep in Stark Enterprise's headquarter, which holds the Underwater suit, the Outer Space suit, etc.  Apparently the suits changed slowly over time, and the Armor Room represents a type of heresy - Tony Stark did NOT create all those suits at once before he was even Iron Man!  Which may be true, but the multitude of suits allow Iron Man more costume changes than a Follies chorus girl during a Saturday matinee, and if they aren't true to the comic book history they probably make the action figure manufacturers happy enough.Fidelity to the source, in this case, doesn't matter that much to me.  When they raise that Chinese city, with inflatable steel, no less, four Elementals are awakened.  They, in turn, must locate five rings to awaken the big boss Mandarin.  All that stands between them and that unimaginable horror is Iron Man.  What does matter to me in an animated action comic book is plot and action.  The plot, they have to find five rings in five distinct quests, would fit well in a video game (really, this feature is a marketer's dream) and otherwise does adequate, if not spectacular, service as a plot.  The action - Iron Man battling the Elementals at each stage before squaring off against the big boss - were pretty well done.  I didn't know they were mixing CGI with 2-D animation, but they do so here with middling results.  The Elementals, representing Earth, Ice, etc. are your typical air-borne meanies with the special ability to control different elements.  Some of the footage of the Elementals was computer generated, and it shows.  I'm not the target audience for a movie like this, but as someone who remembers Iron Man from his 1960's and 1970's comic book incarnation, I am someone the film makers hoped to appeal to.

Tony has a great personality and sense of humor about him, so I would never say he's a boring character.  However, it seemed like they couldn't quite fill in the rest of the movie around him.  Jim Rhodes appears, but not as War Machine.  The love interest is forgettable.The thing I found surprising is this is an origin story.

1031263,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000K7UBTI,The Mysterious Traveler,"[0, 0]","THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN(2007) Directed by Patrick Archibald, Jay Olivia and Frank Paur. Story by Avi Arad. Produced by Ari Avad, Frank Paur and Stan Lee.Brilliant but stupid white rich man Tony Stark learns many lessons about guilt, cultural sensitivity and responsibilty from his friend Jim Rhodes--a wise Black Man and Lei Mei a STRONG FEMALE Chinese woman. He also learns that terrorists---while occaisionally mean and uncouth are essentially right.........and in any case they would not be able to do anything if only American companies would stop making weapons. While all this indoctrination is going, the minor business of the possible resurrection of a 3,000 year old Chinese emperor might be taking place as his four elemental spirits scour the earth for four rings that will somehow bring him to life. Supernatural beings apparently not being consituents of the Democrat Party and therefore can be portrayed as being negative.It has become undeniable that while Marvel--under the control of Ari Avad--may produce a great number of movies based on their properties.....I won't use the word characters as the company obviously does not give a damn about the characters as such...........they simply will rarely be any good.Case in point this animated dry run for the 2008 live action film. As might be gleaned, several of the more unfortunate plot points from this film made their way into the first Downey film..including the fact that the villain will be defeated not by Stark but by the STRONG FEMALE character...so Stark will presumably learn not to take women for granted. The political correctness aka liberal racism strait jackets the film at every point. Stupid American round eyes are being scolded and lectured to by Chinese characters all through the film. Stupid White guys get stern talkings to by one of the brothers---though of course the brother is drawn in such a non-black way---to draw a black character as looking like a black character would..of course..be racist--that it is hard to realize at first that he is meant to be Black. Though is it not racist to basically say that Black people are so unpleasant looking that they must be drawn as white as possible?? When ever there is a Chinese character who might be construed as being evil there is ALWAYS a good Chinese character in the same frame. And neither of the two Chinese villains are defeated by Iron Man but rather another Chinese. Apparently having Chinese villains be defeated by inferior round eyes is racist and insulting to Chinese peeples.As a functional film, it is over plotted and confusing. There is simply too much going on and the film is bloated and lacks any suspense or thrills. And finally of greatest irritation are the endless and unjustified changes in the character and the book. It goes without saying that Stark was never the doofus as he is portrayed here and in the Downey film. There are bizarre changes to his origin including his having already built multiple versions of his armor BEFORE he creates the prototype in the terrorist's cave. Thus any sense of the armor's continual evolution--a major element of the book---is sacrificed as he already has every version he needs in a secret room. Stark is not in charge of his own company. His father is alive creating this very bizarre and intrusive father/son conflict that is not part of the character. Stark's Black friend Jim Rhodes was his pilot in the book but apparenetly that was racist so now he is in charge of operations presumably so he can keep the honky in line.And Iron Man's classic villain---his number one foe---the Mandarin is utterly unrecognizable. In the book, he was a Chinese peasant who wore ten powerful rings that he salvaged from a space ship. A brilliant scientist and martial artist, the Mandarin set himself up in an independent kingdom in the middle of Red China....a sort of high tech warlord and plotted to destroy Iron Man and conquer the world. Here he is a dead 3,000 year old emperor who wants to rise from the dead. There is no real reason to even call him the Mandarin. He could just as easily been Bob the Dead Emperor.It simply staggers that we have forty year old characters that have done very well by themselves thank you very much and we STILL have this unjustifiable arrogance that the characters are dross and need to be ""fixed.""At least the comic books could tell tight linear and iconic stories.

1031265,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000K7UBTI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 3]","After having seen the live action version of Iron Man, I figured I would check out this animated feature released in 2007.  I wasn't aware upon renting THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN that this film was going to be a revised telling of Iron Man's origins and those of his arch nemesis, The Mandarin.  The action of the film is set in modern day China.  Billionaire Tony Stark is raising an ancient Chinese city from below ground, against the advice of the board of directors of his company, Stark Industries.  In doing so, he inadvertently awakens some evil ancient magic that starts to cause chaos.  Tony's best friend and leader of the excavation, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, is kidnapped and disappears.  Tony travels to China in search of his friend and to oversee the end of the excavation.  However, the armored unit that Tony is a part of is attacked and Tony is taken prisoner by the Jade Dragons, the same people who kidnapped Rhodey.  In the attack Tony is mortally wounded.  He is saved by the magical powers of a Chinese wise man and the medical quick-thinking of Rhodey.  The Jade Dragons want Tony to build a weapon to destroy the Chinese city.  Instead, he crafts a suit of iron armor that he uses to help himself and Rhodey escape.  When Tony and Rhodey return to the U.S. agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. attempt to ""arrest"" the duo.  They escape and they plan on how to get into Stark Industry headquarters to get the equipment they need to bring down the ancient Elementals awakened from the excavation site who are now causing havoc across the four corners of the globe.I was disappointed by THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I was not aware that this was a updating and revision of the Iron Man origins story.  I don't have a huge problem with updating the story.  As times change it sometimes makes sense to update a character's origins, ala the recent IRON MAN live-action movie.  Therefore, I didn't have a problem with moving the main setting of the Iron Man's origins from Vietnam to China.  Also, the action sequences were okay, especially the battle between Iron Man and the elementals below the ocean and inside the volcano. It was all the other little things that the filmmakers did to the story.  For instance, having Rhodey with Tony and being one of the people responsible for saving his life; the iron suit Tony makes while a prisoner is not his first and is really just a improved version of many he has already created; Howard Stark did not die in a car accident and is still alive and well and is chairman of the board of Stark Industries; the rather lame ""appearance"" of The Mandarin; etc.  Overall, the animation is a typical action-animated piece with nothing that really stood out in terms of style, tone, or appearance.  There's also an incredible amount of time spent with the person of Tony Stark, yet there is very little development of his character at all.  I don't have a problem with Tony being the focus of the feature, but if that's going to be the case there should be some real character growth and there's just not.Viewers are better off watching the live-action version of IRON MAN instead of sitting through this dissatisfying mess.The DVD includes several extras including an alternate opening sequence, the origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making of piece), the Hall of Iron Man Armor, sequence of concept art, the first scene from a Dr. Strange animated movie from the same company who made THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN, and several trailers for other films.  The Hall of Iron Man Armor is very interesting.  It has pictures with detailed information about almost every different Iron Man suit that Tony Stark has worn over the years.  I learned some things about the character from the Hall of Iron Man Armor.  I also really enjoyed the DR. STRANGE preview.  It interested me enough that I wanted to find the movie and rent it.",2,Lackluster Origins Re-telling.,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,3893,"['having', 'seen', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'Iron', 'Man', 'figured', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'animated', 'feature', 'released', '2007', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'renting', 'THE', 'INVINCIBLE', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'revised', 'telling', 'Iron', 'Man', 'origins', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Mandarin', 'action', 'film', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'China', 'Billionaire', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'raising', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'city', 'ground', 'advice', 'board', 'directors', 'company', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'doing', 'so', 'inadvertently', 'evil', 'ancient', 'magic', 'cause', 'chaos', 'Tony', 'best', 'friend', 'leader', 'excavation', 'James', 'Rhodey', 'Rhodes', 'kidnapped', 'disappears', 'Tony', 'China', 'search', 'friend', 'oversee', 'end', 'excavation', 'However', 'armored', 'unit', 'Tony', 'part', 'attacked', 'Tony', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Jade', 'Dragons', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Rhodey', 'attack', 'Tony', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'saved', 'magical', 'powers', 'Chinese', 'wise', 'man', 'medical', 'quick-thinking', 'Rhodey', 'Jade', 'Dragons', 'want', 'Tony', 'build', 'weapon', 'destroy', 'Chinese', 'city', 'Instead', 'crafts', 'suit', 'iron', 'armor', 'help', 'Rhodey', 'escape', 'When', 'Tony', 'Rhodey', 'return', 'U.S.', 'agents', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'attempt', 'arrest', 'duo', 'escape', 'plan', 'how', 'get', 'Stark', 'Industry', 'headquarters', 'get', 'equipment', 'need', 'bring', 'down', 'ancient', 'Elementals', 'awakened', 'excavation', 'site', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'causing', 'havoc', 'four', 'corners', 'globe.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'THE', 'INVINCIBLE', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'was', 'updating', 'revision', 'Iron', 'Man', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'problem', 'updating', 'story', 'times', 'change', 'sometimes', 'sense', 'update', 'character', 'origins', 'ala', 'recent', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'live-action', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'moving', 'main', 'setting', 'Iron', 'Man', 'origins', 'Vietnam', 'China', 'Also', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'okay', 'especially', 'battle', 'Iron', 'Man', 'elementals', 'ocean', 'volcano', 'was', 'other', 'little', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'story', 'instance', 'having', 'Rhodey', 'Tony', 'being', 'one', 'people', 'responsible', 'saving', 'life', 'iron', 'suit', 'Tony', 'prisoner', 'not', 'first', 'really', 'just', 'improved', 'version', 'many', 'already', 'created', 'Howard', 'Stark', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'chairman', 'board', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'rather', 'lame', 'appearance', 'Mandarin', 'etc', 'animation', 'typical', 'action-animated', 'piece', 'nothing', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'terms', 'style', 'tone', 'appearance', 'also', 'incredible', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'person', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'yet', 'very', 'little', 'development', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Tony', 'being', 'focus', 'feature', 'going', 'be', 'case', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'character', 'growth', 'just', 'not.Viewers', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'live-action', 'version', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'instead', 'sitting', 'dissatisfying', 'mess.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'origin', 'Iron', 'Man', 'featurette', 'making', 'piece', 'Hall', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armor', 'sequence', 'concept', 'art', 'first', 'scene', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'animated', 'movie', 'same', 'company', 'who', 'made', 'THE', 'INVINCIBLE', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', 'Hall', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armor', 'very', 'interesting', 'pictures', 'detailed', 'information', 'almost', 'different', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'worn', 'years', 'learned', 'things', 'character', 'Hall', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armor', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DR', 'STRANGE', 'preview', 'interested', 'wanted', 'find', 'movie', 'rent']",Invincible Iron Man

I think Marvel does a good job at the animation and also at making it interesting enough for adults and not on an insulting 'kiddy' level. One thing that you will find with these Marvel DVD's (at least the ones I have seen) they are not a 30 minute action fest like you would see on Saturday morning. They are really into telling the story so some might think it moves slowly. I like this cause it is more like a movie and less like a cheap roller coaster ride.,3,I AM IRON MAN!,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,499,"['thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'think', 'Marvel', 'good', 'job', 'animation', 'also', 'making', 'interesting', 'enough', 'adults', 'not', 'insulting', ""'kiddy"", 'level', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'find', 'Marvel', 'DVD', 'least', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'not', '30', 'minute', 'action', 'fest', 'would', 'see', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'are', 'really', 'telling', 'story', 'so', 'might', 'think', 'slowly', 'cause', 'more', 'movie', 'less', 'cheap', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride']",Invincible Iron Man

I was excited when I heard about not only the live action Iron Man film coming next May but an animated Iron Man film coming to DVD. I just watched it last night and I'm very, very upset.  I've noticed that the American child audience is in love with Japanese Anime cartoons. You see it every day on the Cartoon Network and now, Marvel followed suit with the animated Iron Man flick. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, Iron Man has become Anime. Even the story takes place in China! It's not about Iron Man and War Machine, it's Iron Man and ancient Chinese spirits! The only notable thing about this movie is that the basic origin of Iron Man is here but this time, a Chinese gang has kidnapped him and he has to battle Chinese elemental gods. Wow. Nice going Marvel. Ruin a great superhero. Even the special features aren't worth it. There's a feature called ""The Origin of Iron Man"" which leads you to believe it's about the true origin of Iron Man but it's actually about the origin of the movie. It's basically the making of the movie. They mention a bit of the real origin(Tony was a munitions dealer in 'Nam, stepped on a mine and a piece of scrap metal gets him right in the chest...we know the rest) but it's not what you'd expect. They wanted the movie current, so they went with ancient China! C'Mon! How many times have they reverted to the trite plot of ancient Chinese spirits?!! Overall, if you really like Iron Man, rent this or just borrow it from somebody you know that might have it.
