I was surprised to see that there is a solid story here, characters with personalities, some great acting, and no cheesy nudity. A girl returns to the town she grew up in after a number of years away to attend a funeral. She had been sent away after her sister's funeral with a brother-in-law and niece as her onlt family left. She starts to have blackouts, visions through sketches, and people begin to die. It even has some dark and creepy elements.

Even with that in mind, BENEATH, an MTV co-production with Paramount, holds your interest with a modicum of shrieks.  HEROES' Nora Zehetner plays Christie, a young girl traumatized by the death of her sister, in an accident in which she was the driver.  Although she survived the crash, Vanessa was burned severely and dies a year later.  When people close to Vanessa start dying, Christie is convinced there's more to Vanessa's death than meets the eye.One major problem I found is Christie's ""visions"" and her drawings of things and people she doesn't know...there is no real explanation for them, and when the script force feeds a reason, it doesn't make sense.

How many times do we have to suffer through somebody dying or being injured in a car accident or a fire (here it was both) then watch the tortured survivor friend or relative deal with it later in life?  This movie wasn't terrible, but there was absolutely nothing new in it anywhere that hasn't been done in dozens of other movies.  There were pictures drawn of visions someone had (boy, that's original), a little kid viewing all the happenings (only for the hundreth time I think) and of course the cover up of the plot that gives us the same old twist at the end.  A real twist would be that there is no twist at the end.

She has flashbacks of the tragic events (and general horrible visions) and draws what she sees in a notebook. Some of the images have yet to occur. A sense of obligation compels her to visit her sister's husband, John and his daughter, Amy. Their household is now run by John's creepy mother (picture Mrs. Danvers.) Christy senses someone else in the house (as does Amy.) She is intent on proving that Vanessa was buried alive, because she saw it in one of her visions. She begins to believe that John and Vanessa's nurse, Claire Wells conspired to kill Vanessa. John insists that Christy leave town or face being arrested by her police friend, Jeff. The ending was rather predictable and somewhat sad, but ultimately for the best, I think. This is a pretty clean movie with only slightly disturbing images.

1082706,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000RMJ68S,Serene Night,"[8, 11]","A depressed young woman who has visions about an accident which eventually caused the death of her older sister returns home to visit her creepy brother-in-law and niece. While there, the niece's grandmother dies and she has a vision right before it happens. The niece confides that there is something 'inside the walls' which is responsible. Some kind of monster. During the course of the investigation, she discovers the house used to be an escape route for local minors and the house is riddled with mysterious hatches and bolt holes.Initially I found this film suspenseful. But I grew bored waiting for the big reveal. The grandmother, and child, were excessively creepy, and I think it would've been more interesting if the characters were more normal even likeable. The house itself was interesting, but it was never explained why the miners felt the need to make *a house* into an escape hatch for the mines. It would make more sense if the house was part of the Underground Railway or something. Also the house was very dark and drab and in an obvious bid to make it look scary, I think they went to far.  It was difficult for me to believe anyone would want to live there.Overall, this was an okay film. If you like the type of film where no one believes the central character isn't crazy until the very end, this one is for you. I found myself unsatisfied with the ending and impatient towards the end for things to happen. The final scene rang hollow and was anti-climatic.3 stars.
