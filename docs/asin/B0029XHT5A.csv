1257621,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,B0029XHT5A,Mike,"[2, 2]","This series tells the story of a son and his grandfather who roam the west in search of the son's father who left years ago and who was once a sheriff but could now be working on the other side of the law as most know him as gunfighter and killer. Mistaken identity or framed we have to follow the trail each week to find out the truth. Walter Brennan plays the grandfather and Dack Rambo plays his grandson. Jason Evers plays Jim Sonnet the man they are in search of who appears periodically throughout the series.Not a lot of guest stars here.Claude Akins [ Movin On ]Cloris Leachman [ Raising Hope ]James Best  [ The Dukes of Hazzard ]Kevin McCathy [ Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 ]Paul Brinegar [ Rawhide ]This show is exceptionally good. Produced by Danny Thomas and Aaron Spelling. This was a pretty intense series for Mr Spelling as we are used to his lighter fare like ""Charlie's Angels"".It's  like a good book. You can't put it down.Once you have read one chapter you can't wait to read the next. It's plot is very similar to ""The Fugitive"" and I loved that series. There is plenty of action here for all western fans. Do they find him alive in the end or is he never found? The answer lies in the last bonus feature. An episode I think that was never aired in it's original run and that's why it's listed as a bonus.Not having seen this show when it first appeared I feel I have to mention that it looks to have been edited from 25 minutes down to 21 minutes.If it has that's a pity.

1257627,A1PHVLYS6T4YW5,B0029XHT5A,T. Berner,"[20, 22]","This is a remarkable artifact from an era when to be a man meant having respect for women, keeping your word, standing up for what's right and a thousand other qualities which are now politically incorrect but were once the hallmark of being a grown-up. This is the perfect audio-visual companion to James Bowman's Honor: A History.Each episode has a lesson illustrating how a man should act and ends with a prayer by Walter Brennan that his grandson learn the lesson. Walter Brennan was one of the great character actors in Hollywood history and Guns is the perfect vehicle for his acting skills. Terrific guest stars and well written scripts round out the series, making this a television classic.UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 3, 2011I wrote that review after seeing the first one or two discs. Now that I've watched all six discs, I stand by it as much now as I did when I wrote it, but I've noticed something even more profound about this series.We know that many TV shows in the 1960s were more profound than they appeared on the surface. The producer of Gilligan's Island has said that the show was about democracy and scholarly books have been written to support that.In addition to providing lessons of manhood, The Guns of Will Sonnet is about myths and history and their role in our personal growth. The choice of actors is perfect. Walter Brennan was a legend himself in Hollywood by the late 1960s, having become an actor shortly after he returned as a doughboy from World War I. Dack Rambo, who played Jeff has such deference to Brennan that the viewer completely believes that he is Brennan's grandson. For an actor who doesn't appear to have had a long career, he is terrific here.Jim Sonnet, son of Will and father of Jeff, represents the legends of the Old West. Will, the old man who has lived his life in the Old West, seeks Jim the way an old man searches history to validate and confirm his own life. Meanwhile, Jeff, the young man, looks for the legends of the Old West as a model for living his life. In a couple of episodes, Will states flatly that one should rely on his own character not on myths and peers.Throughout their quest for the Legend (Jim), they find fruads claiming to be Jim, claiming to have killed Jim, they meet old friends of Will who disappoint and losers who pull themselves out of their rut by force of personal character. There is a rather extraordinary depth to this series.
