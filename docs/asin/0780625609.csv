34149,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,0780625609,Chad Radford,"[1, 2]","&#34;Suburbia&#34; was directed by Richard Linklater and, as typical with his movies, features a group of aimless young people who are dealing with issues of growing up.  They are all twentysomething and hang out at a local convenience store in an average town.  The film follows their adventures over the course of one night.  Most of the time, they do nothing really in particular and seem unable to really communicate what they are thinking.  Other times they feud with the owner of the convenience store who is a young Pakistani man who is studying to be an engineer.  Things get heated even more when one of their old friends, who is now a successful rock star, turns up at the corner to hang out with them.  Some of the friends welcome him with glee while others are jealous of his success and music career.  I found the movie to be overlong and kind of depressing because these people are completely aimless and don't have it together.  You get the sense that most of them will never amount to anything.  The only two people who seem to know what they want out of life are the convenience store owner and the rock star.  I guess that this film supposedly captures what it is like to be a member of Generation X and as a Gen-Xer myself, I find this film to be kind of offensive in the way that it paints my generation with very wide strokes.  Most of my friends did have it together and went on to successful adulthood.  Of course, I knew a very small number of people like the kids in this film but they were by far the minority.

Yep, it`s the everyday world we all live in. The director Richard Linklater innovates a bit (again) as he prefers to center all the plot action in a single night, developing some key moments for his characters. The teens portrayed here seem a bit stereotyped in the beginning but they slowly change during the movie. The dialogue and camera-work are realistic and the acting usually competent. However, it`s a bit slow at parts and the overall atmosphere is not for everyone.

Maybe Suburbia is not as good of a movie I think it is but my insomnia makes it 20 times funnier than it is. This movie shows some of the problems suburban kids go through like having to deal with a guy from high school that went on to do better than you coming back. Then he makes your life seem as small as the 7-11 you stand in front of most of the day. Plus going around for an entire night thinking you killed a girl only to find out that she just passed out. Suburbia makes lives little problems a joke even if they didn't intend for the movie to be funny it is.It's basically about a bunch of kids in there late teens walking around doing and saying the craziest and dumbest things and all because they have nowhere to go and nothing to do. Giovanni's character has to be my favorite, he's always nervous and complaining about dumb things, but even worse for him he finds out that his girlfriend might be leaving him for the kid from school that became a star.

It's filled with articulate (read: not stupid) dialogue, uncomfortable (and sometimes hilarious) confrontations, and characters that are both affecting and irritating, probably because they're so similar to ourselves.There's not much plot, but what little there is has to do with a gaggle of slackers hanging out at a convenience store late one night, waiting for a rock star friend who's &quot;made it&quot; to drop by after a show.  Well, needless to say, emotions flair and attitudes run wild, but more genuinely than in other movies targeting nihilistic kids.  As &quot;subUrbia&quot; progresses and the rock star's REAL intentions become clear (he wants to steal one of the slacker's girlfriends), the movie turns into a fuzzy metaphor for the classic rock star sellout, and how friends and relationships can be bought just as easily when you have power, money, or a limousine.It took me a while to get into the movie, but once I did it really took a hold of me, and reminded me of &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; in that the characters were puzzles waiting to be put together, seeking completion but always meeting with dissatisfaction.  Indeed, everyone here has an err of mystery about them, never revealing their full self, always leaving something hanging.The performances are excellent, especially Giovanni Ribisi's Jeff, who is angry, outspoken, and down-to-earth.  Also worth noting is Nicky Katt's drunken ex-marine who seems resentful toward everyone around him, but also possesses the most life experience out of all the characters.  And there's so many others worth noting...In short, this is to the real world what TBC was to high school.

Overall, it was good, but it could have been better.If you've ever lived in the kind of incredibly boring small town, city or suburb where you actually do hang out in a parking lot for fun, you'll feel a bit of nostalgia for the familiar scenery; beer bottles, trash dumpster and convenience store, complete with anti-loitering convenience store employee. The overall feeling of small town teenage boredom, of 'nothing to do-ness' really comes across in this movie, which is one of more striking things about it.Giovanni Ribisi is great, and his character is the best thing about it.  While bitterly and transparently envious of a former schoolmate's rockstar success, he vehemently expresses his disdain over the way his friends look up to the rockstar, and scorns their own ambitions to leave small town life behind.The main problem I had with the movie was that it seemed a little ambiguous.  On the one hand, it seemed to say, these teenagers are throwing their lives away.  On the other, it sympathizes strongly with them. Ribisi's character seems to voice a lot of the movie's ambiguities, but when the movie was over I still felt that somehow a resolution somewhere was missing.

When I found &lt;em>subUrbia&lt;/em> on Netflix Instant, I added it to my queue without checking details, assuming it was the 1983 Penelope Spheeris movie of the same name.

Silly me.Based on a play by Eric Bogosian, &lt;em>subUrbia&lt;/em> tells the non-story of a group of twentysomethings--one cannot by any reasonable stretch of the imagination call them ""friends""--who spend much of their time hanging out beside a generic quickie-mart run, of course, by an Indian immigrant (&lt;em>Requiem for a Dream&lt;/em>'s Ajay Naidu). There is some hope that things may get interesting for these worthless drunks when Pony (&lt;em>Spider-Man&lt;/em>'s Jayce Bartok), a classmate of theirs who's now the frontman for an arena-rock band, comes back to town for a night and decides to spend it hanging out with them. While the story does have an arc, in that the lives of some of the characters do change during the narrative, here's a spoiler for you: it never does get interesting.What &lt;em>is&lt;/em> interesting: almost every positive review I have seen for this pointless, worthless waste of celluloid talks about how ""truthful"" it is, how ""real"" it is, how ""close to [my] experience"" it is. As someone who spent my twenties drunk, let me state, for the record, that this movie is not any of those things in any sort of universal sense. If I'd had this pathetic a life in my twenties, I'm not sure I'd have ever made it to thirty. There is no sense of hope for these characters, even those who got out previously, or who get the chance to get out in the course of the film. There is no joy whatsoever to be had here. This is the kind of stuff Sartre would have written had he been suicidally depressed, perhaps, except that Sartre had a finely-tuned sense of desperation, whereas Bogosian's script (to which, I must say, Linklater's directorial ""skills"" are almost uniquely suited; there's not a shred of evidence that Linklater thinks about the composition of a single shot in this film) has desperation that looks more like a couple of tomatoes that were splattered against a wall by an overly-aggressive nine-year-old trying to work out his personal issues.Relentlessly, pointlessly, utterly dull, with hateful characters. Worthless.

34162,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0780625609,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 5]","Richard Linklater directs this film version of Bogosian's stage play about disenfranchised youth coming to grips with their unpromising adulthood.  Though it never loses its feeling of being a play (the action never strays far from the parking lot of a 24 hour store of some dead suburban town - characters exit and re-enter; the plot is also largely confined to a single night-into-morning), Bogosian's characters chop themselves to pieces skillfully for your pleasure.Neil ""Pony"" Moynihan escaped Burnfield for a hit career as a pop recording artist (he's still opening for other bands, but the script makes it clear that he's on his way up; his limo makes the same point), and his success provides a point for his friends to question where they are going with their own lives.  Tim has already left Burnfield for a short and unpleasant stint abroad with the Air Force, but he's been back long enough for us to know he's in Burnfield to stay.  Sooze plans to jump Burnfield for New York where a career as a ""performance artist"" awaits.  When Pony offers her a chance to work on the cover of his next album, Sooze must now openly question her relationship with Jeff - an intelligent guy determined not to leave Burnfield, or do anything else with his life.  Though arguably the smartest of the group, Jeff is dead set against becoming something other than creation of his own choices - even if that means that he will never become anything at all, he will still be superior to Pony who depends on his publicists and managers.  Tim also is his own man, but knows that his free will has gotten him nothing - which leaves only a generally badass temperament as an outlet.  In a sort of twist-within-a-twist involving one of Pony's publicists (indie-queen Parker Posey), the script makes Tim and Jeff friends, but rivals - who is the one who is both more honest and gutsier, or who knows the truth and is willing to reveal all.  To oil the works, the scrip also tosses in Bee-Bee - an alcoholic destined for a life of re-hab - and Buff (the latest in a long line of lovable and hyperactive knuckleheads played by Steve Zahn).  Bee-Bee and Buff don't so much as interact with others as just giving them somebody to work off of.Showing its roots on the stage, not much happens - this is a character study.  The end seems somewhat forced, but it doesn't overpower the cruel joke one of the characters plays immediately before it.  Like Burnfield, ""Suburbia"" is less a place where things happen then where people learn about themselves - and better them than us.",4,Character study shows but surpasses its stage roots,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,2555,"['Richard', 'Linklater', 'film', 'version', 'Bogosian', 'stage', 'play', 'disenfranchised', 'youth', 'coming', 'grips', 'unpromising', 'adulthood', 'never', 'feeling', 'being', 'play', 'action', 'never', 'far', 'parking', 'lot', '24', 'hour', 'store', 'dead', 'suburban', 'town', 'characters', 'exit', 're-enter', 'plot', 'also', 'largely', 'confined', 'single', 'night-into-morning', 'Bogosian', 'characters', 'chop', 'pieces', 'skillfully', 'pleasure.Neil', 'Pony', 'Moynihan', 'escaped', 'Burnfield', 'hit', 'career', 'pop', 'recording', 'artist', 'still', 'opening', 'other', 'bands', 'script', 'clear', 'way', 'up', 'limo', 'same', 'point', 'success', 'point', 'friends', 'question', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'own', 'lives', 'Tim', 'already', 'left', 'Burnfield', 'short', 'unpleasant', 'stint', 'abroad', 'Air', 'Force', 'been', 'back', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'Burnfield', 'stay', 'Sooze', 'jump', 'Burnfield', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'career', 'performance', 'artist', 'awaits', 'When', 'Pony', 'chance', 'work', 'cover', 'next', 'album', 'Sooze', 'must', 'now', 'openly', 'question', 'relationship', 'Jeff', 'intelligent', 'guy', 'determined', 'not', 'leave', 'Burnfield', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'life', 'arguably', 'smartest', 'group', 'Jeff', 'dead', 'set', 'becoming', 'something', 'other', 'creation', 'own', 'choices', 'even', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'anything', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'superior', 'Pony', 'who', 'publicists', 'managers', 'Tim', 'also', 'own', 'man', 'free', 'will', 'gotten', 'nothing', 'only', 'generally', 'badass', 'temperament', 'outlet', 'sort', 'twist-within-a-twist', 'involving', 'one', 'Pony', 'publicists', 'indie-queen', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'script', 'Tim', 'Jeff', 'friends', 'rivals', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'honest', 'gutsier', 'who', 'truth', 'willing', 'reveal', 'oil', 'works', 'scrip', 'also', 'Bee-Bee', 'alcoholic', 'destined', 'life', 're-hab', 'Buff', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'lovable', 'hyperactive', 'knuckleheads', 'played', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Bee-Bee', 'Buff', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'interact', 'others', 'just', 'giving', 'somebody', 'work', 'off', 'of.Showing', 'roots', 'stage', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'end', 'somewhat', 'forced', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'cruel', 'joke', 'one', 'characters', 'plays', 'immediately', 'Burnfield', 'Suburbia', 'less', 'place', 'where', 'things', 'happen', 'then', 'where', 'people', 'learn', 'better']",N/A
34163,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,0780625609,The Wickerman,"[3, 8]","Boy, talk about a movie about nothing!  It's basically two and a half hours of a bunch of punk kids standing around in parking lots talking.  Okay, maybe I'm being a bit unfair.  This movie is very slow, but it is meaningful.  It's basically a look at the lives of bored small town teens (although Austin is a strange choice for the locale.  I live there, and trust me, it's far from a small town) who have nothing at all to do, and have to deal with their friend's rise to stardom.  But really, for the most part, nothing really happens in the movie!  It's like real life!  But, perhaps that's the genius of it.  You'd better have a good attention span, though.  I would have to say that Giovanni Ribisi pretty much runs the movie.  He by far outdoes everyone else's performance, and is really the only likable character in the movie (with the possible exception of Steve Zahn).  Ribisi sort of serves as the grouchy but eloquent voice of reason in the group.  It's cool to see him play such a well-spoken character, because he usually plays a dumb guy in everything else.  You sort of get the feeling that he hates his friends, and would rather be anywhere but with them, but he hangs with them anyway because he doesn't really have a choice.  But, when your friends are a drunken goofball, a big, belligerent guy with tattoos, and a pretty boy folk singer, and your girlfriend is a bad poet with an even worse hairdo, it's kind of understandable.  This is really more like a documentary than a movie, but it has its moments.  I think the thing I liked the best about it was that it was filmed where I live, so I recognized a lot of the stuff in the movie.  All in all, I'd say I don't have any strong feelings for this movie, I neither love it nor hate it, but if you like this kind of stuff, you might as well check it out.",3,"Dude, let's go hang out at Circle K!",994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,1827,"['Boy', 'talk', 'movie', 'nothing', 'basically', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'bunch', 'punk', 'kids', 'standing', 'around', 'parking', 'lots', 'talking', 'Okay', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'unfair', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'meaningful', 'basically', 'look', 'lives', 'bored', 'small', 'town', 'teens', 'Austin', 'strange', 'choice', 'locale', 'live', 'there', 'trust', 'far', 'small', 'town', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'have', 'deal', 'friend', 'rise', 'stardom', 'really', 'most', 'part', 'nothing', 'really', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'perhaps', 'genius', ""'d"", 'better', 'have', 'good', 'attention', 'span', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'far', 'outdoes', 'everyone', 'else', 'performance', 'really', 'only', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', 'possible', 'exception', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Ribisi', 'sort', 'serves', 'grouchy', 'eloquent', 'voice', 'reason', 'group', 'cool', 'see', 'play', 'well-spoken', 'character', 'usually', 'dumb', 'guy', 'everything', 'else', 'sort', 'get', 'feeling', 'friends', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'anywhere', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'drunken', 'goofball', 'big', 'belligerent', 'guy', 'tattoos', 'pretty', 'boy', 'folk', 'singer', 'girlfriend', 'bad', 'poet', 'even', 'worse', 'hairdo', 'kind', 'understandable', 'really', 'more', 'documentary', 'movie', 'moments', 'think', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', 'where', 'live', 'recognized', 'lot', 'stuff', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'movie', 'neither', 'love', 'hate', 'like', 'kind', 'stuff', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'check', 'out']",N/A
