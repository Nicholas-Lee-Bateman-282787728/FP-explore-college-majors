1460011,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005G7WGRW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","The 2010 Korean import ""Death Bell: Bloody Camp"" (alternate title Death Bell 2 or Gosa 2) is a sequel to surprise hit of 2008.  Haven't seen it?  The original ""Death Bell"" hasn't received a U.S. DVD distribution but can certainly be found on the international marketplace if one were so inclined.  It is not necessary, however, to have watched the original film to partake in this sequel.  The two movies share none of the same characters--only the exact same premise as flimsy as that might seem.  In a cross between the ""Saw"" films and the teenage slasher films of yore, the film puts a lot of students at an exclusive academy in harm's way.  After an opener which showcases the death of a popular athlete, the film jumps right into gear with little other preamble.  A number of individuals are locked on the school grounds with the directive to solve the murder or die.As character development is of no particular priority to the filmmaker, it really is of little consequence as the students start to meet unpleasant ends.  There isn't much suspense, but plenty of gore, and an audience expecting the extravagances and/or the creativity of the deaths in popular franchises like the aforementioned Saw or Final Destination may be disappointed.  Of course, none of it makes much sense but the physical impossibilities of an omnipresent murderer orchestrating such an extravagant scheme is nothing new to the genre.  The director plays fast and loose with the narrative to provide plenty of red herrings to divert the viewer from the real culprit.  The reveal is, perhaps, the best thing about the movie and has unexpected tenderness--but there just isn't much that is new, unique, or intriguing enough to make this a must-see entertainment.If you've seen the first movie, this offers absolutely nothing new.  If you like these type of Asian horror films filled with gruesomeness and supernatural revenge, this movie is easy enough to watch and be entertained by.  It just has a general lack of ambition.  Barring any originality, this hits all the expected beats--it's all fine.  If you haven't seen the prior movie, you might like this without realizing that it's a retread in every major regard.  I had just hoped for genuine suspense or perhaps at least one character to really care about.  By the numbers all the way.

There are parts of this movie where you wonder about what your watching.

1460013,A2VESRVJU717IR,B005G7WGRW,RStringini,"[0, 1]","Death Bell: Bloody Camp (actually Death Bell 2) has an interesting idea.  Thirty students are trapped in a school, and tasked with figuring out who among them is a killer.  The death scenes are interesting, well staged, and fairly nasty.  The actual plot, when pieced together is pretty interesting, and the acting isn't all that bad.The problem is that so much of the story has to be told in flashbacks that hault the dramatic tension and dread that the scenes in the present are working towards creating. The other problem with the film is that there are THIRTY characters.  It's hard to keep track of everyone, and while the acting isn't bad, no one stands out enough for you to really remember who is who, why they are involved, and why you should care if they live or die.  Once everything does come together, and the real story is revealed, the film gains some focus, and becomes more entertaining, but it takes to long to get to that point.Death Bell 2 could have been good.  It has some fun moments, but the script is a mess.  Black Rat, The Whishing Stairs, and several other films have told similar stories, and handled the material much better.  For that, I really can't recommend Death Bell 2.  While it is a good looking film, with a few creative deaths, the over all film is a muddled mish mash of random plot threads that never really amount to much.",3,"Parts work, but as a whole, it's a mess",1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1365,"['Death', 'Bell', 'Bloody', 'Camp', 'actually', 'Death', 'Bell', '2', 'interesting', 'idea', 'Thirty', 'students', 'are', 'trapped', 'school', 'tasked', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'staged', 'fairly', 'nasty', 'actual', 'plot', 'when', 'pieced', 'together', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad.The', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'hault', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'dread', 'scenes', 'present', 'are', 'working', 'towards', 'creating', 'other', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'THIRTY', 'characters', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'everyone', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'out', 'enough', 'really', 'remember', 'who', 'who', 'why', 'are', 'involved', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'live', 'die', 'Once', 'everything', 'come', 'together', 'real', 'story', 'revealed', 'film', 'gains', 'focus', 'more', 'entertaining', 'long', 'get', 'point.Death', 'Bell', '2', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'fun', 'moments', 'script', 'mess', 'Black', 'Rat', 'Whishing', 'Stairs', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'told', 'similar', 'stories', 'handled', 'material', 'much', 'better', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Death', 'Bell', '2', 'good', 'looking', 'film', 'few', 'creative', 'deaths', 'film', 'muddled', 'mish', 'mash', 'random', 'plot', 'threads', 'never', 'really', 'amount', 'much']",Death Bell: Bloody Camp
