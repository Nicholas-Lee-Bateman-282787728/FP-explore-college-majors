990836,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FIHN9S,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Well, I'll say one thing for The Cavern (aka Within).  It certainly keeps you guessing - guessing what is going on (since you can't see anything most of the time) and guessing what this or that character just said.  Now I know it can't be easy lighting scenes that take place far below the surface of the earth, but throw us a bone here; you have to extinguish every light in your house to have any hope of seeing anything at all here.  And if the lighting's not bad enough, you're often stuck with POV shots pointing at nothing in particular and shaking all over the place - an effect which is multiplied during the film's more intense moments.  The filmmakers call it the hypershake, as if they invented some groovy new film technique; to me, it just looks like the cameraman was drunk out of his mind.  Did I mention how these big moments are punctuated by a veritable orgy of flashing lights?  Brilliant, eh?  Hey, just to make all those pitch dark scenes even harder to make out, let's take the opportunity to bombard the viewer's eyes with bright flashing lights every so often!As far as the story goes, you have eight explorers setting out to explore an uncharted cave in remote Kazakhstan (this is apparently what these people do with their lives, although I'm hard pressed to say how they support themselves).  Except for an annoying little man writing a book on the subject, they're all experienced spelunkers with something of a history together.  You see, there was a tragedy a couple of years earlier - and there's nothing like some good old we're-trapped-miles-below-the-surface panic to bring buried personal issues boiling up to the surface.  This exploration is hardly begun before one dude gets himself disemboweled and the others quickly find themselves intentionally trapped by someone or something.  From this point on, it's a desperate effort to find another way out before they all fall victim to whatever monster is definitely in there with them.  They walk a while, pause to argue among themselves, and then wait for the monster to kill one of them so that they can get moving again - over and over.  It's really annoying to see these characters argue amongst themselves over what happened two years earlier, especially since it takes valuable time away from that whole running for their lives thing.  Speaking of annoying, the ending is guaranteed to inspire a few choice words from anyone who suffers through it.  It is, in a word, stupid.  I wanted to slap this movie when the end credits started rolling.This is a low-budget film, so I suppose I should cut it a little slack.  The cave system (or at least what little I could see of it) did not look like a fake set, the acting was pretty good for the most part, and the gore is nicely done.  I also detect the influence of The Blair Witch Project in the overall presentation - I don't think it necessarily works here, but it wasn't a bad idea in and of itself.  It's hardly worth talking about the filmmakers' approach to the story, though, as the movie is all but doomed by the terrible lighting of the whole underground experience (did I mention that, on a couple of occasions, the screen went completely black for an extended period of time, while the characters screamed in the background?).  I'm not saying I would have liked this film if I had actually been able to see what was going on, but I guess we'll never know.",2,"Someone forgot the lights in Lights, Camera, Action!",1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,3404,"['Well', ""'ll"", 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'Cavern', 'Within', 'certainly', 'guessing', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'most', 'time', 'guessing', 'what', 'character', 'just', 'said', 'Now', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'lighting', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'far', 'surface', 'earth', 'throw', 'bone', 'here', 'have', 'extinguish', 'light', 'house', 'have', 'hope', 'seeing', 'anything', 'here', 'lighting', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', ""'re"", 'often', 'stuck', 'POV', 'shots', 'pointing', 'nothing', 'particular', 'shaking', 'place', 'effect', 'multiplied', 'film', 'more', 'intense', 'moments', 'filmmakers', 'call', 'hypershake', 'invented', 'groovy', 'new', 'film', 'technique', 'just', 'cameraman', 'was', 'drunk', 'mind', 'Did', 'mention', 'how', 'big', 'moments', 'are', 'punctuated', 'veritable', 'orgy', 'flashing', 'lights', 'Brilliant', 'eh', 'Hey', 'just', 'make', 'pitch', 'dark', 'scenes', 'even', 'harder', 'make', 'out', 'let', 'take', 'opportunity', 'bombard', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'bright', 'flashing', 'lights', 'so', 'often', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'have', 'eight', 'explorers', 'setting', 'out', 'explore', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'remote', 'Kazakhstan', 'apparently', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'lives', ""'m"", 'hard', 'pressed', 'say', 'how', 'support', 'annoying', 'little', 'man', 'writing', 'book', 'subject', ""'re"", 'experienced', 'spelunkers', 'something', 'history', 'together', 'see', 'was', 'tragedy', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', 'nothing', 'good', 'old', ""we're-trapped-miles-below-the-surface"", 'panic', 'bring', 'buried', 'personal', 'issues', 'boiling', 'up', 'surface', 'exploration', 'hardly', 'begun', 'one', 'dude', 'disemboweled', 'others', 'quickly', 'find', 'intentionally', 'trapped', 'someone', 'something', 'point', 'desperate', 'effort', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'fall', 'victim', 'whatever', 'monster', 'definitely', 'walk', 'while', 'pause', 'argue', 'then', 'wait', 'monster', 'kill', 'one', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'moving', 'again', 'really', 'annoying', 'see', 'characters', 'argue', 'amongst', 'over', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'especially', 'valuable', 'time', 'away', 'whole', 'running', 'lives', 'thing', 'Speaking', 'annoying', 'ending', 'guaranteed', 'inspire', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'anyone', 'who', 'word', 'stupid', 'wanted', 'slap', 'movie', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling.This', 'low-budget', 'film', 'suppose', 'should', 'cut', 'little', 'slack', 'cave', 'system', 'least', 'what', 'little', 'could', 'see', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'fake', 'set', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'gore', 'nicely', 'done', 'also', 'detect', 'influence', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'overall', 'presentation', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessarily', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'hardly', 'worth', 'talking', 'filmmakers', 'approach', 'story', 'though', 'movie', 'doomed', 'terrible', 'lighting', 'whole', 'underground', 'experience', 'did', 'mention', 'couple', 'occasions', 'screen', 'went', 'completely', 'black', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'characters', 'screamed', 'background', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know']",The Cavern

Flailing the camera around like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing.In addition, film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action. Film also requires light to work. Perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen. I know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time.For that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth.A last note to the director I am sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake CGI campfire. I honestly, for the life of me, cannot think of one.Now on to the screenwriter, could you try to make at least one character likable? I would prefer two or more but one decent person I can root for or care about might help. In addition, if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story.If you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it.

990849,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FIHN9S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 9]","The Cavern (Olatunde Osunsami, 2006)Olatunde Osunsami's low-budget thriller The Cavern could have been-- well, not a great movie, really, but at least a very good one. It starts out well enough. Like The Descent, the British trapped-in-a-cave-with-something-nasty film released around the same time, The Cavern is about a bunch of cavers who are, well, trapped in a cave with something nasty. Unlike The Descent, which for all that it was one of the best movies I saw last year was gimmicky and full of shortcuts, The Cavern actually tries to go the distance. It's a first film, and has some of the hallmarks of a first film, but at least Osunsami makes the effort, and he comes pretty close to pulling it off.The cavers in The Cavern are a coed bunch, unlike the all-female caving troupe of The Descent, but sex isn't really as much of an issue as one might think; we spend the opening scenes of the movie setting up the various alliances and tensions between the group. Five of them-- Bailey (The Passion of Ayn Rand beauty Sybil Temchen), Gannon (Mustafa Shakir, recently of Marci X), Domingo (TV character actor Andres Saenz-Hudson), Miranda (Urban Playground's Ogy Durham), and Ori (American Gun's Andrew Caple-Shaw)-- are part of a team who have caved together for a number of years, making their living from exploring and photographing new caves and reporting back to the world on what they find there. Also involved in this trip are two Kazakh natives, Vlad (Kamen Gabirel in his big-screen debut) and Slava (Neno Pervan, briefly seen in The Hunted), who they band have hired as guides, and Ambrose (Danny Jacobs, recently of Miriam), who's writing a book on caving and is with them for research. It can also be said that there's a ghost with the group-- that of Rachel (Cassandra Duarden, in her big-screen debut), a member of the team who died on an expedition in Peru two years previous, and whose story is told in flashback as the movie goes on. The setting up of the characters is accomplished with the same sort of lunkheaded deftness that we get in The Descent, though again, Osunsami's characters don't have the sort of slick two-dimensionality that some of those in The Descent did. He doesn't always succeed, but he's trying to create rich, detailed characters with depth and complexity. The film is shot in the foot here mostly by its abbreviated running time of eighty-one minutes; there was a lot more that could have been dome with some of these characters, especially Domingo and the author, but it's enough to know, at least, they're not stereotypes.Then we actually get into the cave, and here I have to give The Descent the props. Osunsami takes few chances with his footage here, and when he does, it has more to do with Blair-Witch-Project-esque first-person-cam fiddling than it does with trying to make the viewer claustrophobic (something the first half of The Descent does with chilling effectiveness). Part of the problem is the constant thought in the back of the viewer's head that if anyone's carrying a video camera, they wouldn't be in the places from which we're seeing camera shots, but that's less minor than Osunsami not taking full advantage of the fact that he and his actors are sitting in a cave. There's one tight-shot scene, but there's never much of a feeling that anyone's in any danger from the environment itself.The something-nasty angle, though, heaps points on The Cavern like nobody's business-- for the first hour of the movie. If it had ended at sixty-one minutes, I'd be hailing it as one of the best monster movies we've seen in at least the past two decades. Osunsami handles this perfectly. We never see the monster. The cavers see the monster every now and then, but only see enough to get a grip on what it is once-- and the camera work here is deft enough so that you an get the cavers' reaction to the beast while only seeing the barest hint of it. I'm probably overreaching and/or forgetting a few movies here, but I was thinking while I was watching it that I hadn't seen the monster in a monster movie handled that well since Cat People (Tourneur's, not Schrader's).Ah, but this is the age of Trading Spaces and Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. How can  you possibly make a movie that doesn't have a big reveal? Sixty-one minutes in, after the climactic scene, the screen goes black, you're ready to rejoice... and there's another scene, and you just know that Osunsami's about to blow it. We're going to see themonster, which has zero chance of living up to the build-up, and it'll end up being 2006's great cinematic disappointment. (Well, unless you actually expected a good Adam Sandler movie.) But here is the biggest surprise The Cavern has waiting for you-- while the expected disappointment does, of course, surface, if you look at all the variables here, all the many, many ways this could have gone even more horribly wrong than it does, it will eventually occur to you that if Osunsami had to give us the last twenty minutes of this movie, he did it in, roughly, the best way he could have. Obviously, it's impossible to discuss this in detail without major spoilers, so I'll just have to say that while it doesn't work as well as simply not including the final scene would have, it works as well as possible given the existence of the final scene.A very pleasant surprise, albeit one that should have been twenty minutes shorter. *** ",3,Far better than I expected given the
