It had Ray Milland that Ilike and Braford Dillman so I figured it was good.The production is cheap and the quality isn't goodso that made it hard to watch. It's more of a lovestory than a ripoff movie. I found it hard to watch.Moore is great as always you can tell he put his effortinto it but it didn't work.

Yet, the action doesn't seem to truly pick up until the latter part of the movie when things start to go terribly wrong in a South African gold mine.The plot - for what it's worth - revolves around plans to increase the value of gold stocks by flooding a gold mine in Africa, and the machinations employed to keep the manager of the mine (played by Moore) suitably distracted and away from the location to allow the villains plot to succeed.A great cast supports Moore in this piece including Susannah York and Sir John Gielgud and it moves at a fair pace. The troubling aspect about this movie (and the reason I give it only four stars) is the poor treatment that has been afforded the picture on the DVD - it really does deserve to be redone and remastered.",4,Great movie...pity about the DVD,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,932,"['movie', 'made', 'former', 'Bond', 'director', 'Peter', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Hunt', 'starring', 'then', '007', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'hallmarks', 'great', 'fun', 'action', 'thriller', 'action', ""n't"", 'seem', 'truly', 'pick', 'up', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'South', 'African', 'gold', 'mine.The', 'plot', 'what', 'worth', 'revolves', 'plans', 'increase', 'value', 'gold', 'stocks', 'flooding', 'gold', 'mine', 'Africa', 'machinations', 'employed', 'keep', 'manager', 'mine', 'played', 'Moore', 'suitably', 'distracted', 'away', 'location', 'allow', 'villains', 'plot', 'succeed.A', 'great', 'cast', 'supports', 'Moore', 'piece', 'including', 'Susannah', 'York', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'fair', 'pace', 'troubling', 'aspect', 'movie', 'reason', 'give', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'poor', 'treatment', 'been', 'afforded', 'picture', 'DVD', 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'redone', 'remastered']",N/A
195537,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,1896306039,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[0, 0]","Recently, we read Roger Moore's book ""My Word is my Bond"" and thanks to this excellent biography of all the work accomplished by Roger Moore, we became familiar with movies we had never seen by our favorite... Bond, James Bond. So, we are trying to see all his films.In Gold, Roger Moore stars with Susannah York in this movie about the dire consequences of greed. The plot revolves around South African gold mines and a group of wealthy men who plot to destroy the way of life of one of the South African gold mine wealthy owners to tamper with gold prices in the global market. Once this gold mine is eliminated by flooding, the price of gold should go up making them rather wealthy.These men are ruthless and in their search for control, power and wealth, they are willing to put the lives of over a thousand men at risk. But, Rod Slater, played by Roger Moore is the manager who foresees the possibilities of catastrophic events and plans accordingly.Susannah York plays the role of the wife of one of the ruthless men, a hypochondriac who no longer makes her happy. She meets the character played by Moore and enters into an extra-marital relationship that deepens as the days go by.Thanks to Roger Moore's book, My Word is my bond we find out that because of Apartheid, the legal racial segregation enforced by the National Party government of South Africa between 1948 and 1990, the trade union would not permit filming in South Africa. Much discussion takes place and finally, the crew arrives in Johannesburg in September of 1973 and was able to film without any political message portraying a difference between races.We also discover that the mines are real and as Roger Moore tells us; ""to be faced with real conditions as an actor, helped him bring to life the character of Rod Slater.""Reading Roger Moore's book has opened the door to a new way to enjoy these films because we know the tid-bits of information that would otherwise go unnoticed, making the film more interesting and enjoyable.If you enjoy film history, read the book and keep a list of the movies mentioned by Moore. See these through the eyes of the actor, sometimes director, and you will find yourselves immersed in a world of fun travel opportunities.
