898589,A3300SFI0JF7OM,B0008ENI0W,Adamtron,"[7, 12]","I bought this DVD on blind faith, based on trailers I had seen and on the cover art.  I'm a big SCI-FI fan and also enjoy ancient Egyptian history.  I thought, ""How can I go wrong?"".  Although there are some great visuals and plenty of eye candy, the movie suffers from an incoherent plot and bad direction.  There are several interesting concepts and ideas that are introduced but are never fully explored or developed.  An Egyptian God, Horus is on a mission to impregnate a blue haired woman.  But there is no explanation of what his motives are for doing this.  The blue haired woman named Jill has amnesia and doesn't remember much or seem to have any goals or motives.  Although I suppose she is the main character and is pretty to look at, I ultimately found her uninteresting because she doesn't do much.  Nikopol played by Thomas Kretschmann seemed to have a more interesting background as it is said he is the one that caused the war and chaos on the planet and was then cryogenically frozen as punishment.  He has some funny interactions with Horus, but they never explain his back story or expand on his character either.  He basically becomes a puppet of Horus in order to have intercourse with Jill.  When they finally do have sex, they do it under a blanket, so there is not even any gratuitous nudity.  There is a subplot about body tissue and cosmetic surgery with people that look like characters from Star Trek Insurrection, but that is never explained.  Bizarre things happen in this movie such as Jill going into some tunnel that looks like outer space to talk with a man covered in black Arabian style cloths.  The main character Nikopol appears with two metal dome things on his head that were not there in the previous shot and which continue to be there for the rest of the film.  People enter some dimensional riff that just exists in the middle of nowhere and that people fall into, but is not explained.  It all gets very muddy and you keep watching hoping it will be one of the cool movies where all the pieces of the puzzle will come together and make sense at the end of the film.  However, the director fails to tie all the ideas together or give any sense of purpose or resolution to the story.  At the end of the movie, I found myself thinking, ""Is that it?"".  The other problem is that I think CGI should be used for backgrounds, cityscapes, etc. but not to replace real actors.  This movie was chock full of Final Fantasy type CGI characters that looked kind of tacky and their lips were out of sync with the dialog.  Even Horus looks like he is carved out of stone.  I think his character would have looked better if it was a bodybuilder with a bird mask or something.  I watched the bonus features and so I know it took them several years to make this film and that it was hard work doing all the computer graphics, so I do not want to criticize it too much.  I think the potential is there to a make a sequel and if it had a stronger story and used more real actors, it would be a stronger follow up.  But I'd say this is a rental and not something to pay $22 for.",3,"Nice Eye Candy, But Incoherent Plot and Direction",1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,3103,"['bought', 'DVD', 'blind', 'faith', 'based', 'trailers', 'had', 'seen', 'cover', 'art', ""'m"", 'big', 'SCI-FI', 'fan', 'also', 'enjoy', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'history', 'thought', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'visuals', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'suffers', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'bad', 'direction', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'ideas', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'developed', 'Egyptian', 'God', 'Horus', 'mission', 'impregnate', 'blue', 'haired', 'woman', 'explanation', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'doing', 'blue', 'haired', 'woman', 'named', 'Jill', 'amnesia', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'seem', 'have', 'goals', 'motives', 'suppose', 'main', 'character', 'pretty', 'look', 'ultimately', 'found', 'uninteresting', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Nikopol', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'interesting', 'background', 'said', 'one', 'caused', 'war', 'chaos', 'planet', 'was', 'then', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'punishment', 'funny', 'interactions', 'Horus', 'never', 'explain', 'back', 'story', 'expand', 'character', 'either', 'basically', 'puppet', 'Horus', 'order', 'have', 'intercourse', 'Jill', 'When', 'finally', 'do', 'have', 'sex', 'do', 'blanket', 'not', 'even', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'subplot', 'body', 'tissue', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'people', 'look', 'characters', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Insurrection', 'never', 'explained', 'Bizarre', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'such', 'Jill', 'going', 'tunnel', 'outer', 'space', 'talk', 'man', 'covered', 'black', 'Arabian', 'style', 'cloths', 'main', 'character', 'Nikopol', 'two', 'metal', 'dome', 'things', 'head', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'previous', 'shot', 'continue', 'be', 'there', 'rest', 'film', 'People', 'enter', 'dimensional', 'riff', 'just', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'people', 'fall', 'not', 'explained', 'very', 'muddy', 'keep', 'watching', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'cool', 'movies', 'where', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'film', 'However', 'director', 'tie', 'ideas', 'together', 'give', 'sense', 'purpose', 'resolution', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'thinking', 'other', 'problem', 'think', 'CGI', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'backgrounds', 'cityscapes', 'etc', 'not', 'replace', 'real', 'actors', 'movie', 'was', 'chock', 'full', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'type', 'CGI', 'characters', 'looked', 'kind', 'tacky', 'lips', 'were', 'sync', 'dialog', 'Even', 'Horus', 'carved', 'stone', 'think', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'better', 'was', 'bodybuilder', 'bird', 'mask', 'something', 'watched', 'bonus', 'features', 'so', 'know', 'took', 'several', 'years', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'work', 'doing', 'computer', 'graphics', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'criticize', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'potential', 'there', 'make', 'sequel', 'had', 'stronger', 'story', 'used', 'more', 'real', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'stronger', 'follow', 'up', ""'d"", 'say', 'rental', 'not', 'something', 'pay', '22']",Immortal

Months later I saw the preview again and thought ""hey they've definitely gottta be on to something here""!  So I looked through all of the video stores near me and none of them had it!  So I decided to take a chance and buy it here at Amazon and needless to say I was not disappointed in the slightest!  This movie rules!  It carries a unique story of the Egyptian God Horus being judged for some kind of crimes upon conviction however he still has one week or so of freedom until his sentence is passed.  So what Horus decides to do is first find a suitable human or mutant body to take over so that he can find a suitable woman to mate with.  Unfortunately Horus's first few attempts end up in failure until he finds a cryogenically frozen convict named Alcides Nikopol or Nikopol for short who accidently escapes his frozen prison.  Anyway him and Nikopol meet and Horus makes him a metal prosthetic leg to replace the one he lost in the cryo-tubes accidental fall that freed him.  Well anyway one thing leads to another and then Horus and Nikopol finally discover a beautiful/sexy immortal woman named Jill.  After that Horus uses Nikopol to mate with this immortal beauty.  Anyway that's the basic plot more or less!  Needless to say however alot lot of triumph and conflict soon follow these three characters.  If you want to know more please check out the movie you won't regret it! Never before have I seen a cool blending of CGI characters and real people.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 13]","When you finally finishImmortal, your first reaction will probably be to stare off into space and say, ""What the heck was THAT?""And no, not in a symbolism-loaded, thought-provoking way -- more of a ""I dropped acid during aCasshern/Stargatemarathon, and this is the nightmare I had after it."" Directed by artist Enki Bilal (and based on his graphic novel ""La Foire aux immortels""), this is an atmospheric movie crammed with weird random plot elements and bad special effects. Maybe you have to read the graphic novel for it to make sense.A strange pyramid has appeared over a dystopian New York City, and the ancient gods of Egypt have condemned the god Horus to die in seven days. In those seven days, he must go forth and father a child. Unfortunately any hosts he possess explode, until he finds a cryogenically frozen rebel named Nikopol (Thomas Kretschmann), who is the only one who can carry a god.And the only woman whom Horus can knock up is Jill (Linda Hardy), a strange girl with blue scaly hair, blue tears and no memory. Unfortunately, the reigning politician of the city is determined to dispose of Nikopol, and is sending a monstrous creature to destroy him.I have never in my life seen a movie with SO MANY weird questions, with no halfway-decent answers. Why is nobody upset about the floating pyramid? HOW does Horus know all this stuffn? Who's the hooded man and why is he dying? Where did Jill come from? What ARE the Egyptian gods? Why are all the gods naked? What's with that bird?Now, I'll admit that there are some cool moments, such as Nikopol flying through the air like a feather on the wind, ""Willie,"" or the rather funny image of Egyptian gods playing Monopoly. And the future world sketched out in this movie is pretty enjoyably weird, like a surrealist version of ""Blade Runner.""Unfortunately, the script is full of painfully pretentious moments (Nikopol keeps reciting Baudelaire), and clunky dialogue (""The blue of my tears stains human skin for good."" ""I feel blue... for you""). And there's a disturbing ""romantic"" subplot, in which Horus (using Nikopol's body) repeatedly rapes Jill, and of course Jill and Nikopol fall in love. Pretty sick.And you know what's REALLY distracting? The creepy, over-smooth, vaguely misshapen CGI characters, all of which could easily be played by actual actors... but for whatever reason, instead we get these weird computer-generated puppets. Was it SO hard to cast people in this movie, or were they just showing off?!The live actors are more of a mixed bag -- Hardy has a sort of punky vulnerability as a woman with no past and a murky biology, and Kretschmann is excellent as the hardened rebel who finds himself doing abhorrent things and finding love. But Charlotte Rampling is saddled with a weird haircut, and she spends most of her time onscreen looking like she's thinking, ""What am I doing here?!""""The Immortal"" is one of those movies that looks awesome, sounds awesome... and falls flatter than a bad souffle under an anvil.

898609,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B0008ENI0W,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[2, 3]","I was just perusing Amazon when this recommendation came upon my screen.  The cover alone captivated me.  So I took the next step to start reading reviews and found it got fairly decent reviews.  I'm a pretty big science fiction buff and the premise sounded hugely unique, that sealed it for me, I had to try it.So my friends and I sat down to watch this movie and we all agreed that the visualizations were well done.  Except for one point... when the film shifted from having real humans to having CG humans and then it shifted back and forth.  In a few scenes it was humans interacting with CG characters, but those were few and far between.  The change was so sudden that it just felt weird, and we were left wondering why the director thought this was a good idea.  Later we theorized that it was probably the people that had some sort of disease that was referenced in the film.  However, I would've liked to have gotten more explanation on this.  Then we saw the senator and thought maybe it wasn't all for those people.  Ultimately... we got confused.Most of the script is pretty interesting and conceptually it's quite enthralling.  The black mark against this film is that they leave a lot of questions out there.  Such as why the gods are doing what they do?  I realize it's to mate with a female, but what's the point of that?  They never really explain the reason for the need... just that they want to do it.  It certainly brings up some very interesting parallels to history and the birth of demigods, which are fraught throughout historical writings.  It is pretty obvious that the director is into history, especially the religious kind judging by his name.  Enki is a Sumerian/Persian deity and ""Bilal"", I assume, is some perversion of the name Belial, also of Persian origin.If you pay close attention to the film, you'll follow it on a decent level.  But there are parts that you just get lost with.  This obviously happens when the gods are speaking Egyptian and there are no words on the screen to tell me the translation unlike in ""Stargate.""  Imagine how lost you would be watching ""Stargate"" with no translations!  That's kind of the effect I walked away with on this film during those scenes.Overall it's a decent movie.  I think the director was a little over ambitious in creating this world.  It felt like he tried to cram thousands of years of history into a two hour package and hope that the audience could fill in the gaps logically.  I mean some of it was obvious, like the flying car stints, I can definitely figure out they are influenced by films like ""The Fifth Element.""  Only he tried to combine the design with like a 1920's styled vehicle and an electric subway type of design... only all this is in the air.  See, that kind of thing I can backtrack.  The strange mutants because of a disease were a little harder to figure out, since I really don't have much of a historical reference for mutation other than the atomic bombs being dropped and the accident at Chernobyl.  Either way, I think you get my point.  The world is too big for people to just figure out on their own.  The visuals do make up for this in their own way, because it's a beautifully dark film in its own right.  I say give it a chance, but I hardly think it's worth owning as I don't see it to have all that much re-watch value.",3,"Great visuals, incredible story, rather poor execution",1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,3342,"['was', 'just', 'perusing', 'Amazon', 'when', 'recommendation', 'came', 'screen', 'cover', 'alone', 'captivated', 'took', 'next', 'step', 'start', 'reading', 'reviews', 'found', 'got', 'fairly', 'decent', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'science', 'fiction', 'buff', 'premise', 'sounded', 'hugely', 'unique', 'sealed', 'had', 'try', 'it.So', 'friends', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'agreed', 'visualizations', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'shifted', 'having', 'real', 'humans', 'having', 'CG', 'humans', 'then', 'shifted', 'back', 'forth', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'humans', 'interacting', 'CG', 'characters', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'change', 'was', 'so', 'sudden', 'just', 'felt', 'weird', 'were', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'director', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Later', 'theorized', 'was', 'probably', 'people', 'had', 'sort', 'disease', 'was', 'referenced', 'film', 'However', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'explanation', 'Then', 'saw', 'senator', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'people', 'Ultimately', 'got', 'confused.Most', 'script', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'quite', 'enthralling', 'black', 'mark', 'film', 'leave', 'lot', 'questions', 'there', 'Such', 'why', 'gods', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'realize', 'mate', 'female', 'what', 'point', 'never', 'really', 'explain', 'reason', 'need', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'certainly', 'up', 'very', 'interesting', 'parallels', 'history', 'birth', 'demigods', 'are', 'fraught', 'historical', 'writings', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'director', 'history', 'especially', 'religious', 'kind', 'judging', 'name', 'Enki', 'Sumerian/Persian', 'deity', 'Bilal', 'assume', 'perversion', 'name', 'Belial', 'also', 'Persian', 'origin.If', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'film', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'decent', 'level', 'are', 'parts', 'just', 'get', 'lost', 'obviously', 'when', 'gods', 'are', 'speaking', 'Egyptian', 'are', 'words', 'screen', 'tell', 'translation', 'Stargate', 'Imagine', 'how', 'lost', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'Stargate', 'translations', 'kind', 'effect', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'scenes.Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'little', 'over', 'ambitious', 'creating', 'world', 'felt', 'tried', 'cram', 'thousands', 'years', 'history', 'two', 'hour', 'package', 'hope', 'audience', 'could', 'fill', 'gaps', 'logically', 'mean', 'was', 'obvious', 'flying', 'car', 'stints', 'can', 'definitely', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'influenced', 'films', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Only', 'tried', 'combine', 'design', '1920', 'styled', 'vehicle', 'electric', 'subway', 'type', 'design', 'only', 'air', 'See', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'backtrack', 'strange', 'mutants', 'disease', 'were', 'little', 'harder', 'figure', 'out', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'historical', 'reference', 'mutation', 'other', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'being', 'dropped', 'accident', 'Chernobyl', 'way', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'world', 'too', 'big', 'people', 'just', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'visuals', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'way', 'beautifully', 'dark', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'say', 'give', 'chance', 'hardly', 'think', 'worth', 'owning', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'have', 'much', 're-watch', 'value']",Immortal

The tie-in to Ancient Egypt and their pantheon was interesting but I missed how that made any sense.A hi-tech hourglass ticks away.  What does the cat goddess think of Horace's procreative trysts?Intricate plot that is vague somehow.  Dialogue written by 'B'-level college creative writing students.  CGI characters all look like more like cartoons/anime except for the 'immortals' who didn't seem to fit with the animal heads.  Hot bodies, though, for unrated film, they didn't need to cover up Horace's privates.  Romance between the 'hero' and the lead female was too forced (literally).  Seemed to make light of rape.The exchanges between the main character guy and Horace were overlong and it was never clear how Horace inhabits him.  The doctor (?) female pursuing the alien female protagonist seemed to have zilch character development.  Then there was the inexplicable series of shark/squid-like villain accoutrements that were laughably ineffective, though they looked cool in their evil way.The main problem with the film is that the emphasis really is on surfaces and the 'stylized future reality bit', rather than a story.  It reminded me of latter day George Lucas, where the plot gets sketchy, the dialogue gets more stilted, the humor scarce, but everything looks and sounds really cool.Immortal is sexy, or at least tries, but the reasons it's sexy seems to be to keep focus away from the half-baked plot.  The story line gets lost in the jumbled script, half-mentioned, and unfocused.  Horace wants to procreate?  So he takes over the male protag's body?The whole thing would've made a great, highly stylized porn movie, but it's obvious they wanted to spice up the story with sex but didn't want to bother with the messiness of making the story at all sexual or make the sexual make sense.Overall, the movie 'outcools' itself by looking good while saying very little. Blade Runner, though highly stylized, defined a genre of future Earth depictions white tell a very compelling story about the core nature of what it means to be human and, ultimately, the nature of immortality.'Immortal', on the other hand, is an ancient Egypt fanclub flick, part cartoon, part real that looks simultaneously slick and, at times, ridiculous (Horace talks out of his throat and I swear I could see an actor's eyes peering through his beak at one point).Given another year or so of massaging, editing, and developing the script, effects, etc. the would make an interesting film, but the kernel of the story focuses on Horace rather than the couple who are.. spoiler alert....getting back together at the end (ironically, sine she has lost her memory - yet again).Too many gimmicks, magic pills and magic powers make this movie a two star joint.",2,Not Cooked Long Enough,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,2867,"['saw', 'movie', 'time', 'cable', 'jotted', 'notes', 'down', ""'Immortal"", 'suffers', 'wanting', 'be', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'tie-in', 'Ancient', 'Egypt', 'pantheon', 'was', 'interesting', 'missed', 'how', 'made', 'sense.A', 'hi-tech', 'hourglass', 'away', 'What', 'cat', 'goddess', 'think', 'Horace', 'procreative', 'trysts', 'Intricate', 'plot', 'vague', 'somehow', 'Dialogue', 'written', ""B'-level"", 'college', 'creative', 'writing', 'students', 'CGI', 'characters', 'look', 'more', 'cartoons/anime', ""'immortals"", 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'animal', 'heads', 'Hot', 'bodies', 'though', 'unrated', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'cover', 'up', 'Horace', 'privates', 'Romance', ""'hero"", 'lead', 'female', 'was', 'too', 'forced', 'literally', 'Seemed', 'make', 'light', 'rape.The', 'exchanges', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'Horace', 'were', 'overlong', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'how', 'Horace', 'doctor', 'female', 'pursuing', 'alien', 'female', 'protagonist', 'seemed', 'have', 'zilch', 'character', 'development', 'Then', 'was', 'inexplicable', 'series', 'shark/squid-like', 'villain', 'accoutrements', 'were', 'laughably', 'ineffective', 'looked', 'cool', 'evil', 'way.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'emphasis', 'really', 'surfaces', ""'stylized"", 'future', 'reality', 'bit', 'rather', 'story', 'reminded', 'latter', 'day', 'George', 'Lucas', 'where', 'plot', 'sketchy', 'dialogue', 'more', 'stilted', 'humor', 'scarce', 'everything', 'looks', 'really', 'cool.Immortal', 'sexy', 'least', 'tries', 'reasons', 'sexy', 'be', 'keep', 'focus', 'away', 'half-baked', 'plot', 'story', 'line', 'lost', 'jumbled', 'script', 'half-mentioned', 'unfocused', 'Horace', 'procreate', 'male', 'protag', 'body', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'great', 'highly', 'stylized', 'porn', 'movie', 'obvious', 'wanted', 'spice', 'up', 'story', 'sex', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'bother', 'messiness', 'making', 'story', 'sexual', 'make', 'sexual', 'make', 'sense.Overall', 'movie', 'looking', 'good', 'saying', 'very', 'little', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'though', 'highly', 'stylized', 'defined', 'genre', 'future', 'Earth', 'depictions', 'white', 'tell', 'very', 'compelling', 'story', 'core', 'nature', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'ultimately', 'nature', 'immortality', ""'Immortal"", 'other', 'hand', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'fanclub', 'flick', 'part', 'cartoon', 'part', 'real', 'simultaneously', 'slick', 'times', 'ridiculous', 'Horace', 'throat', 'swear', 'could', 'see', 'actor', 'eyes', 'peering', 'beak', 'one', 'point', 'year', 'so', 'massaging', 'editing', 'developing', 'script', 'effects', 'etc', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'kernel', 'story', 'Horace', 'rather', 'couple', 'who', 'spoiler', 'alert', '.getting', 'back', 'together', 'end', 'ironically', 'sine', 'lost', 'memory', 'yet', 'again', '.Too', 'many', 'gimmicks', 'magic', 'pills', 'magic', 'powers', 'make', 'movie', 'two', 'star', 'joint']",Immortal

898617,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,B0008ENI0W,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[7, 10]","Watching Immortal is like reading a comic book. It's that close to the story's original medium, for which the creator of the Nikopol stories should be pleased. At first I found the switching back and forth between scenes of the human actors and scenes with just CGI characters confusing and unsettling and I thought I would write this film off as a waste of time. But I gradually became comfortable with the spectacle, even if the CGI was flawed. Some characters look too cartoonish and horribly fake, but then this was a French production with a limited budget (compared to Hollywood) and the behind the scenes feature explains that film animation is not big in France. All this considered, they don't do a bad job, especially with the cityscapes and flying cars.The story itself demands viewer attention to piece plot elements together that are not immediately explained, or maybe never explained. This may be one of the great strengths of this movie, the creative refusal to explain everything and have tidy endings. I liked the mystery. It's the year 2095, the setting is New York, and humanity has taken to prolonging life and replacing body parts through cloning and artificial means. A corporation called Eugenics practically runs the city, has its own police force and the power to capture and dispose of people as it wishes. One of its captives is a mysterious young woman named Jill (Miss France Linda Hardy) who has pale white skin and blue tears. Jill also wields destructive power contained only by Eugenics hardware rigged to her head. She is rescued by an interested doctor (Charlotte Rampling) who studies her and puts her through clinical trials and we learn Jill eats like a pig (while remaining exceptionally attractive) and may not be human.Now free to move about as she pleases, Jill has regular meetings with an even more mysterious John, whose head is completely wrapped in black bandages. He gives more clues that their origins are not of earth, but he is helping her become human. They have a strange connection to an ""intrusion,"" a warp in time and space that has existed for some time in Central Park. New Yorkers are warned not to enter the park and certain death awaits those who do try to sneak in.Complicating this already convoluted plot, a flying pyramid has appeared over New York City, but nobody is paying much attention. It seems to take a few days for a leading political figure, a corrupt senator, to make a diplomatic mission to the pyramid. But before that happens, we learn the pyramid contains the actual gods of Egyptian legend. They have appeared again because Horus (the god with the hawk's head) has been judged by his fellow gods and is being allowed seven days on earth to fulfill a personal mission before his sentence. He needs to possess a male human host and impregnate a female. Trouble is, he has a hard time finding a man untainted by surgical enhancement. Until he finds the convict Nikopol, accidentally released from 30 years of cryogenic freezing. Nikopol was apparently imprisoned for fighting for the rights of the beings held captive by Eugenics.Enter a softly-spoken detective who is trying to find a serial killer who is making a big bloody mess out of his victims. The detective himself was messed up from an encounter with a shark-like alien some years back. You start to get the picture how many subplots are in this film!The CGI works best for the buildings and flying cars, and the impressive shark-like alien, but it falters when it comes to rendering people. Like another reviewer said, CGI still has trouble making skin look authentic. The Egyptian gods also could have been done better, but overall it was a satisfying visual experience.

The back cover blurb claims this is a ""groundbreaking step in the future of film making,"" a claim I hope is far from the truth. A movie based on a graphic novel and it sure seems it. It is so full of CGI that this would almost qualify as an animated cartoon and is disconcerting as some of the characters are ""real"" and some computer generated (not very well as the moving mouths and voice over work doesn't necessarily match in many places). Some of the CGI sets are pretty well done but then some scenes of dubious quality intrude and break up the flow. Clunky. The plot is a hodgepodge of sci-fi elements that don't necessarily mesh all that well and the characterization is close to nonexistent. A 2-D story in the depiction of a 4-D world. I watched this and was like, ""Oh, yeah, Fifth Element, and, yep, reminds me of the Matrix and, ooh, there's some Bladerunner."" The thing that really ticked me off is that two-thirds of the way through the movie, my flawless, scratch free disc started freezing up on a DVD player that plays everything.

All I knew of it was that it was a science fiction film that dealt with human eugenics experiments and an appearance by Egyptian gods in 2095.  Now this was indeed an enticing combination.  As the film began, I could see that the visuals, shot in animation and CGI, were the foundation.  Now when any film is presented in its near entirety with the viewer asked to visualize the plot through a kaleidescope, the result is either a smashing success or a crushing bore.  In this case, I would place IMMORTEL somewhere in the middle.  There were only three actors who were filmed more or less as human beings.  Two of them (Linda Hardy and Thomas Kratchsman) I had never heard of.  Charlotte Rampling was the third though I did not recognize her under her heavily made up face and banged hair. My interest was limited to how the plot followed a byzantine path that defied logic.  Director Enki Bilal, as I later found out, is a avante-garde director who specializes in tranferring comic books to the big screen as animations.  As I watched, I tried to decide how the movie would have turned out had a director other than Bilal been behind the camera.  I quickly realized that the result would not have made a big difference.  The failure of IMMORTEL was Bilal's determination to omit key facts needed as background.  Now I have no problem with a director forcing his audience to think, but in this case, I had to think too much, a problem exacerbated by the patently fake look of too many characters who looked like nothing but computer-enhanced Pillsbury dough boys.I had some problem with the appearance of a pyramid suddenly popping into existence over New York City in 2095.  This problem was not that it appeared replete with bird headed Egyptian gods seeking to judge one of their own.  My comfort zone of believability was shattered when the typical New Yorker seemed not to care a whit.  I well know of blase New Yorkers, but their apathy was depressing.  There are too many plot twists to reveal here, though these twists served more to distance the viewer rather than engage him.  As the final credits rolled, I decided that IMMORTEL, like any film, could best be appreciated by those who already are fans of the genre and are willing to suspend disbelief even to the stretching point.

Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes.The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The ""sets,"" though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted.The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen  in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough.The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion.In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone. *",1,"Pretty, but vacant.",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1734,"['Immortel', 'ad', 'vitam', 'Enki', 'Bilal', '2004', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'impressed', 'Bilal', 'Nikopol', 'Trilogy', 'page', 'figured', 'film', 'made', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'fun', 'ride', 'Bilal', 'helm', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Most', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'dashed', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'one', 'thing', 'everyone', 'film', 'quite', 'nice', 'CGI', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'put', 'mind', 'best', 'scenes', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'integration', 'actual', 'actors', 'CGI', 'characters', 'often', 'seamless', 'sets', 'are', 'second-rate', 'Bladerunner', 'wannabes', 'was', 'lot', 'potential', 'most', 'was', 'wasted.The', 'acting', 'even', 'when', 'delivered', 'pretty', 'high-powered', 'acting', 'talent', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'example', 'atrocious', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Linda', 'Hardy', 'who', 'aside', 'yet', 'land', 'major', 'role', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'are', 'wooden', 'Rampling', 'touch', 'vivacity', 'role', 'now', 'then', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough.The', 'plot', 'well', 'can', 'definitively', 'say', 'plot', 'fact', 'connected', 'Nikopol', 'Trilogy', 'way', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'character', 'Nikopol', 'hour', 'hundred-minute', 'film', 'should', 'tip', 'off', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'staying', 'completely', 'faithful', 'book', 'are', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'recognize', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Nikopol', 'Trilogy', 'can', 'tell', 'experience', 'having', 'read', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'lucid', 'fact', 'may', 'add', 'confusion.In', 'short', 'aside', 'visually', 'appealing', 'aspect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'single', 'thing', 'movie', 'recommend', 'well', 'anyone', '*']",Immortal

898642,A2C5VCR3DYDPR2,B0008ENI0W,Some Guy,"[7, 8]","I'd first like to take issue with the many references to Blade Runner. Simply because a movie has a film noir atmosphere and is set in the near-mid future doesn't make it a Blade Runner clone.  The stories of these two films are nothing alike.  Enough said there.  :o)Wow, this film looks fantastic.  It's major eye candy from start to finish.  I think the noir aspect goes slightly too far with the flying cars that look like the result of a 50's taxi getting a makeover on ""Junkyard My Ride,"" but otherwise it's as fascinating to watch as the plot is fascinating to see unfold.I love the animal-headed Egyptian gods who feature strongly (mainly Horus, the film's focal point), and the story built around him and the female protagonist is interesting.  It draws just enough from mythology to feed the plot without trying to rewrite history, and the people and events surrounding them are interesting and relevent.There is some ambiguity at times where you're not sure exactly what's going on and exactly what sort of future this is, but otherwise it's hard not to just sit back and be engrossed.  Ultimately I disliked Horus but at the same time understood how deep his motivations ran, and that sort of thing is important in character-building.  Visually...wow, what a piece of work he is.I highly recommend this for any sci-fi fan, but even if that isn't your thing there's still a great story, great characters, and a nice noir feel to satisfy non sci-fi fans.

There's also a strong vibe from a little seen film called UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD - while that film does not have anything near the kind of story that IMMORTAL does - there seems to be a ghost of that tone here as well.  This is not a bad thing.The story is at once complex and yet very direct.  Things move from one point to the next in a pretty linear fashion.  Everything happens over the course of seven days - but the back story has been going on since time began.  But not everything is explained to you.  There are moments where you'll have to make up your own mind and come up with your own conclusions as to what is really going on.  I hesitate to give anything away because it's a film best watched cold (and while I've compared the film to THE FIFTH ELEMENT don't let that blind you to IMMORTAL).The film mixes and matches computer antimated characters and live actors to great effect. While you never truly forget that the animated players are anything but computer generated - they do react and act well enough to draw you into the world.  It's great work both big and small.IMMORTAL is not for everyone.

I'd agree, I'd say it was a combo of The Fifth Element and a largely unseen movie titled Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (if you've seen both films, and you enjoyed them, this one is definately for you).  It felt, in a way, also like a Terry Gilliam movie, the director of Brazil and Time Bandits.  It did not have the darkness of Blade Runner, but it did convey a similar sense of a more realistic vision of an urban future, if relying heavily on CGI (unlike BR).  I hope this review helps!Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

898655,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0008ENI0W,Tsuyoshi,"[137, 155]","Let me tell you about the director first.  Enki Bilal, born in Yugoslavia, moved to France when he was 10, and has become one of the most influential comic book artist in France since around 1980.  His works include 'Nikopol Trilogy,' and this French film 'Immortal' (his third entry as film director) is based on the first two books of the series.I said this because the merit of 'Immortal' lies all in its visual imaginations.  The film's story with many characters is very confusing, revealing its origin.  The film is visually interesting for it was shot against the background of green-colored screen, on which the buildings or the landscapes of the city is digitally painted.  The method is similar to that of 'Sky Captain', but the effects are quite different as I explain later.[THE STORY] is complicated, and the film refuses to explain some part of it.  'Immortal' is set in the year of 2095, NEw York City, where cars are flying between the skyscrapers, but one strange thing is floating on the air -- that's a pyramid, out of which a naked man with a bird's head emerges.  His name is Horus, a convicted deity who is given seven days to do something on Earth, borrowing the body of a convicted human Nikopol.The nature of the crime of Nikopol (played by Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') is only vaguely suggested, but anyway Horus possesses his body, and controls him as he wishes.  Then, his purpose will be clear when Nikopol/Horus approaches to a mysterious woman Jill (former Miss France Linda Hardy), whose skin is all white and whose blood is blue.Kretschmann, Hardy, and Charlotte Rampling (as Jill's doctor) appear as live-action actors while most of the other characters are created with CGIs by a French studio.  The CGI-created characters look like those you have seen in the film version of 'Final Fantasy' and in this sense 'Immortal' is more ambitious than 'Sky Captain.' Interesting thing is one of the CGI characters (Rampling's estranged husband) is played by uncredited Jean-Louis Trintignant (voice only) who had appeared Enki Bilal's first film 'Bunker Palace Htel.'[VISUALS] I like the visual imagination of 'Immortal,' but many fans would point out, quite rightly, that the future world  of 'Immortal,' impressive as it is on its own way, are not as original as it looks.  You remember classic 'Blade Runner' 'The Fifth Element' and one Japanese genius Otomo.  To be fair, as I wrote before, Enki Bilal's original comics predate them (the first Nikopol comic was published in 1980), but still complaints are understandable.But if the film is flawed (and I think it is), that is because of the visual itself, I mean, the CGI parts.  To be honest, the CGI-drawn characters (of a greedy senator, a detective, a big company executive, etc.) are all poorly done, and their bodily or facial movements are unnatural and awkward.  I am really afraid that they are giving serious damages to the whole film.But as you will see, the talent of Enki Bilal is undeniable, and his vision is presented effectively with the other-worldly but retrospective descritions of the city of New York in 2095, which is beautifully drawn with blue and grey (red is seldom seen).

898657,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0008ENI0W,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[37, 41]","Bilal is best known as a comic artist. I've liked his work visually: he tends towards a restrained and idiosyncratic palette of colors, but uses strong color where it makes a point. He makes each character stand out, and counts more on visual impact than physical credibility for bringing his worlds to life. I've always found uncertain narrative development in Bilal's stories, but with visuals that keep me going to the end.That's what this movie was like: visually powerful, but baffling as a story. Ancient Egyptian gods come to Earth, in a massive pyramid poised over a major city. The city takes surprisingly little notice, until an exiled god seeks a human host body, then seeks a human female. OK, it's enough to carry the movie, but nothing spectacular. It's all the characters that make it work as an experience for the eyes, with their distortions, exaggerations, and unique visual style.That style is carried in an alternation of live action sequences (with CG effects, of course), and animation on a par with Final Fantasy. The alternation wasn't quite seamless, but wasn't quite blatant enough to act as a narrative tool - I hope his future films make better use of each medium's strengths. The general styling stuck close to the subdued colors of Bilal's comics, even a restrained blue for the skin tones of the Jill, the female lead. Color dominates only in the final scene, richly enforcing the ""new day dawning"" theme.""Immortal"" is a remarkable crossover for a well-known comic artist, apparently adapted from his ""Nikopol Trilogy"" of DC comics.
