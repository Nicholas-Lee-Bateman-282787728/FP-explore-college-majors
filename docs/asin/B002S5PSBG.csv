And its a great deal because there are over 4 hours of Yoga.  This is a must have for anyone who is a serious at home yogi.  I love that this is not at all easy, but if you are newer to yoga or not feeling well there is an Easy Street practice and modifications for beginner ease.

1286316,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B002S5PSBG,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[0, 0]","This DVD is instructed by Canadian yogi and self-described ""Blissogist"" Eoin Finn.  It offers four vinyasa flow yoga practices of varying lengths, all with a strong focus on stretching the hips.  On this DVD, Finn is joined not only by his wife, Insiya, but also by a group of Winter Olympic Athletics, each of whom is performs a slightly different variation in each pose.  They are practicing in beautiful outdoor settings, and Finn instructs via voiceover.The Main Menu of the DVD offers the opportunity to preview each of the four practices, which are as follows:  Easy Street, World Champions Hips, All Downhill, and Hot Chocolate.  Finn's Blissology web site offers a PDF listing all of the poses included each of these practices, but I have provided a simple overview of each below.EASY STREET (51 minutes)As the title suggests, this is likely the easiest practice.  It begins in a seated meditation pose and goes through only one sun salutation round.  Standing postures including a warrior series, and once on the floor, you'll do pigeon, seated forward bends, twists, and a nice relaxation.WORLD CHAMPION'S HIPS (79 minutes)This challenging routine includes Finn's ""Ultra Yang"" sun salutations (which involve extra push-ups), the same warrior series, additional standing postures focused on the hips, standing and arm balance work, splints, backbends (or ""front body stretches,"" as Finn calls them), and more involved forward bends/twists.ALL DOWNHILL (43 minutes)Although the title and length of this practice would suggest an easy routine, Finn actually includes some challenging postures here.  After a single sun salutation flow and the warrior series, he includes the same standing and arm balance work as in the previous practice as well as a backbending series.  A forward bend series, reclined pigeon, and relaxation conclude this practice.HOT CHOCOLATE (57 minutes)This practice also includes Finn's challenging Ultra Yang sun salutations.  There are more unique postures weaved in here, from forearm plank to dolphin to crow to an abs series.  Forward bending, backbends, and supine work is included as well.  Finn shares the instructor duties this DVD with Insiya and what sounded like one other voice; I found this both distracting and unnecessary.In addition to the four main practices, this DVD offers an Extras menu with features such as Athlete's Visualization, information Knee Safety, and a preview of Finn's then-upcomingBlissology ProjectDVD set (at that time, Blissology was called ""Yoga for Every Day"").  I have Finn's Blissology set as well, and I find that I prefer the practices on those DVDs to Pursuit of Happy Hips (PoHH).  I greatly appreciate that Blissology offers shorter practice options (25-35 minutes) for each day, whereas the shortest practice on PoHH is OVER 40 minutes long.  Furthermore, I prefer Finn's live instruction in Blissology as well as his slightly more relaxed vibe--as opposed to PoHH, which seems more athletic.This is definitely a well-done DVD with four very nice strength-based practices.  Personally, I prefer Finn's Blissology, but others may may appreciate the variety and additional challenge that Pursuit of Happy Hips brings to their yoga collection.",4,Four nice strength-based yoga practices with plenty of focus on the hips,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3221,"['DVD', 'instructed', 'Canadian', 'yogi', 'self-described', 'Blissogist', 'Eoin', 'Finn', 'four', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'yoga', 'practices', 'varying', 'lengths', 'strong', 'focus', 'stretching', 'hips', 'DVD', 'Finn', 'joined', 'not', 'only', 'wife', 'Insiya', 'also', 'group', 'Winter', 'Olympic', 'Athletics', 'whom', 'performs', 'slightly', 'different', 'variation', 'pose', 'are', 'practicing', 'beautiful', 'outdoor', 'settings', 'Finn', 'instructs', 'voiceover.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'opportunity', 'preview', 'four', 'practices', 'are', 'Easy', 'Street', 'World', 'Champions', 'Hips', 'All', 'Downhill', 'Hot', 'Chocolate', 'Finn', 'Blissology', 'site', 'offers', 'PDF', 'listing', 'poses', 'included', 'practices', 'have', 'provided', 'simple', 'overview', 'below.EASY', 'STREET', '51', 'minutes', 'title', 'likely', 'easiest', 'practice', 'seated', 'meditation', 'pose', 'only', 'one', 'sun', 'salutation', 'round', 'Standing', 'postures', 'including', 'warrior', 'series', 'once', 'floor', ""'ll"", 'do', 'pigeon', 'seated', 'forward', 'bends', 'twists', 'nice', 'relaxation.WORLD', 'CHAMPION', 'HIPS', '79', 'minutes', 'challenging', 'routine', 'Finn', 'Ultra', 'Yang', 'sun', 'salutations', 'involve', 'extra', 'push-ups', 'same', 'warrior', 'series', 'additional', 'standing', 'postures', 'focused', 'hips', 'standing', 'arm', 'balance', 'work', 'splints', 'backbends', 'front', 'body', 'stretches', 'Finn', 'more', 'involved', 'forward', 'bends/twists.ALL', 'DOWNHILL', '43', 'minutes', 'title', 'length', 'practice', 'would', 'suggest', 'easy', 'routine', 'Finn', 'actually', 'challenging', 'postures', 'here', 'single', 'sun', 'salutation', 'flow', 'warrior', 'series', 'same', 'standing', 'arm', 'balance', 'work', 'previous', 'practice', 'as', 'well', 'backbending', 'series', 'forward', 'bend', 'series', 'reclined', 'pigeon', 'relaxation', 'conclude', 'practice.HOT', 'CHOCOLATE', '57', 'minutes', 'practice', 'also', 'Finn', 'challenging', 'Ultra', 'Yang', 'sun', 'salutations', 'are', 'more', 'unique', 'postures', 'weaved', 'here', 'forearm', 'plank', 'dolphin', 'crow', 'abs', 'series', 'Forward', 'bending', 'backbends', 'supine', 'work', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'Finn', 'shares', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'Insiya', 'what', 'sounded', 'one', 'other', 'voice', 'found', 'distracting', 'unnecessary.In', 'addition', 'four', 'main', 'practices', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'menu', 'features', 'such', 'Athlete', 'Visualization', 'information', 'Knee', 'Safety', 'preview', 'Finn', 'then-upcomingBlissology', 'ProjectDVD', 'set', 'time', 'Blissology', 'was', 'called', 'Yoga', 'Every', 'Day', 'have', 'Finn', 'Blissology', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'prefer', 'practices', 'DVDs', 'Pursuit', 'Happy', 'Hips', 'PoHH', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'Blissology', 'shorter', 'practice', 'options', '25-35', 'minutes', 'day', 'shortest', 'practice', 'PoHH', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'Furthermore', 'prefer', 'Finn', 'live', 'instruction', 'Blissology', 'as', 'well', 'slightly', 'more', 'relaxed', 'vibe', 'opposed', 'PoHH', 'more', 'athletic.This', 'definitely', 'well-done', 'DVD', 'four', 'very', 'nice', 'strength-based', 'practices', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'Finn', 'Blissology', 'others', 'may', 'may', 'appreciate', 'variety', 'additional', 'challenge', 'Pursuit', 'Happy', 'Hips', 'yoga', 'collection']",The Pursuit of Happy Hips with Eoin Finn

The instructor is good, and very descriptive, so if you prefer to close your eyes, you can do the work out. What I don't like is how this switches from scene to scene within the same workout. One pose the class is in a meadow, the next the instructor is on the beach. I find this distracting, and as when I first do a work out, I open my eyes only between pose changes to make sure I am doing the pose correctly.  The changing scenes make me think I missed something.

1286319,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B002S5PSBG,Jenny G,"[7, 8]","I really enjoyed this DVD.  Although Eoin mentions that this DVD would be good at any level, I think that if someone was really new to exercise in general, this may not be a good fit.  There is a person doing a modified version for many of the poses, but it's not always easy to see what she is doing, and they don't always discuss the modifiers so it's a matter of watching, or already knowing what possible modifications to make.Easy Street (51 minutes):  I take one day a week off from the elliptical and strength exercise but usually try to get in some walking.  On this particular day off, I opted to try this yoga flow instead of walking, looking for something gentle to provide some stretching.  I was feeling a bit tight when I first started but felt wonderful after.  This practice starts in a sitting meditation, thinking about your breath and alignment, before moving into some gentle cat / cow and downward dog stretches. It then goes into sun salutation with 2 rounds for each leg and a nice standing stretching flow that begins from warrior 2. Pigeon pose with forward bend is next, and he gives very good instructions on form and alignment.  Next is a stretch series that is about 11 minutes long and includes several different seated forward bends, upward (reverse) plank, revolved head to knee and a ballet arch pose. Stretching continues with half spinal twist and gomukhasana.  The flow closes with seated breathing (3 minutes) and shivasana (4 minutes), and back to seated breathing. This flow was yummy.All Downhill (43 minutes): I completed this after doing the elliptical and some of Shiva Rea's Creative Core Abs. This flow starts in a brief standing meditation and then sun salutation and moves into a warrior 2 flow (same as from Easy Street).  The next sequence includes several balance poses, including optional advanced variations. It continues with backbending and pigeon pose, this time doing a gentle backbend while lifting and grabbing the back foot during pigeon.  He then goes into a 6.5 minute stretch flow that is a shorter version of the one from Easy Street, including forward bends, upward plank, and revolved head to knee. Stretching continues with gomukhasana, spinal twist, and supine pigeon pose. The flow closes with Shivasana and moves back to seated.  I really enjoyed this flow as well, and liked the balance poses.Hot Chocolate (57 minutes): This starts in standing moving into what Eoin calls the ultra yang sun salutation and a standing flow that includes optional crow pose and squats. It continues with some challenging butt and core toners before relaxing into the seated forward bend flow with the same poses as from Easy Street.  He then continues into challenging boat pose variations, and then relaxes again into hip openers. Next is the backbending and and pigeon pose variation that is the same as from All Downhill.  Then half wheel pose with optional full wheel.  The last cycle of poses includes happy baby, supine leg stretch, and supine gomukhasana, and then closing with Shivasana.  I really liked this flow, although it seemed a bit long by the end.  Next time I might hit the skip button to skip by the standing flow chapter to really concentrate on the core work and hip opening.  I loved the core work and boat pose variations.World Champion's Hips (79 minutes):  I did not complete this flow, but he refers to it as the ""Full Monty"", and looks like it includes the material from the other flows.There are also two flows that can be downloaded from Eoin's web page. There is a coupon with the DVD to download one of them for free.All in all I really, really like this DVD and see it becoming one of my favorites.  As mentioned by others, the setting is beautiful, the narration is very good.",5,Love it !

1286320,A1AJHUCWHI49T2,B002S5PSBG,"Lucie ""Lucie""","[33, 33]","What a lovely DVD!Eoin Finn's newest DVD is in many ways his best yet.As promised, there are four routines, ranging in length from 80 minutes to just over 40, of various degrees of difficulty.Even though there is some overlap, I definitely didn't feel like I was doing parts of the same routine. Each practice had something absolutely to offer in terms of sequences and poses.World Champion's Hips (80 minutes)  and Hot Chocolate (about 60 minutes) are probably my favorite (and probably more challenging than others) - they include nicely paced sun salutes and two rounds of sun salutes with extra push-ups - but only two rounds, some very nice variations of standing poses combined with shoulder and chest openers, hip opening poses, back bends (front body openers) as Eoin calls them (bow, wheel, again, with interesting variations). Hot Chocolate includes crow and some interesting squat work, WC's Hips includes some wonderful splits variations. Lovely core work is included in these segments as well.Downhill and Easy Street are more relaxed practices, they include some sun salutations and some standing poses, lovely hip openers, Easy Street has a nice seated meditation.All practices include wonderful hip opening work - from every angle - hip flexors, glute muscles and underlying smaller muscle groups, hamstrings, quads, etc. Each practice also offers fantastic shoulder and chest openers.The pace of the practice is very very pleasant - there is no rush to get in and out of the pose, there is a lot of emphasis on alignment, and gradually getting into a pose deeper. There is also a lot less vinyasa than in previous DVD - i.e. once you get into seated poses you stay seated.Eoin's narration is absolutely wonderful, playful, light and humorous (that's what we love his DVDs for) yet he provides some extremely valuable guidelines how to get into each pose correctly so it feels right, etc.Eoin also offers some really nice insights, without being preachy or dogmatic in the slightest, he shares a lot of yogic wisdom.The cast is great - you can tell some members are Winter sports Olympians - they use ski poles to assist with balancing poses ;)The music is pleasant, mostly instrumental.The background is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful.",5,Wonderful New  Yoga DVD,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2257,"['What', 'lovely', 'DVD', 'Eoin', 'Finn', 'newest', 'DVD', 'many', 'ways', 'best', 'yet.As', 'promised', 'are', 'four', 'routines', 'ranging', 'length', '80', 'minutes', 'just', '40', 'various', 'degrees', 'difficulty.Even', 'overlap', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'doing', 'parts', 'same', 'routine', 'practice', 'had', 'something', 'absolutely', 'offer', 'terms', 'sequences', 'poses.World', 'Champion', 'Hips', '80', 'minutes', 'Hot', 'Chocolate', '60', 'minutes', 'are', 'probably', 'favorite', 'probably', 'more', 'challenging', 'others', 'include', 'nicely', 'paced', 'sun', 'salutes', 'two', 'rounds', 'sun', 'salutes', 'extra', 'push-ups', 'only', 'two', 'rounds', 'very', 'nice', 'variations', 'standing', 'poses', 'combined', 'shoulder', 'chest', 'openers', 'hip', 'opening', 'poses', 'back', 'front', 'body', 'openers', 'Eoin', 'bow', 'wheel', 'again', 'interesting', 'variations', 'Hot', 'Chocolate', 'crow', 'interesting', 'squat', 'work', 'WC', 'Hips', 'wonderful', 'splits', 'variations', 'Lovely', 'core', 'work', 'included', 'segments', 'well.Downhill', 'Easy', 'Street', 'are', 'more', 'relaxed', 'practices', 'include', 'sun', 'salutations', 'standing', 'poses', 'lovely', 'hip', 'openers', 'Easy', 'Street', 'nice', 'seated', 'meditation.All', 'practices', 'include', 'wonderful', 'hip', 'opening', 'work', 'angle', 'hip', 'flexors', 'glute', 'muscles', 'underlying', 'smaller', 'muscle', 'groups', 'hamstrings', 'quads', 'etc', 'practice', 'also', 'fantastic', 'shoulder', 'chest', 'openers.The', 'pace', 'practice', 'very', 'very', 'pleasant', 'rush', 'get', 'pose', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'alignment', 'gradually', 'getting', 'pose', 'deeper', 'also', 'lot', 'less', 'vinyasa', 'previous', 'DVD', 'i.e', 'once', 'get', 'seated', 'poses', 'stay', 'narration', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'playful', 'light', 'humorous', 'what', 'love', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'guidelines', 'how', 'get', 'pose', 'correctly', 'right', 'etc.Eoin', 'also', 'really', 'nice', 'insights', 'being', 'preachy', 'dogmatic', 'slightest', 'shares', 'lot', 'yogic', 'wisdom.The', 'cast', 'great', 'can', 'tell', 'members', 'are', 'Winter', 'sports', 'Olympians', 'use', 'ski', 'poles', 'assist', 'balancing', 'poses', 'music', 'pleasant', 'mostly', 'instrumental.The', 'background', 'absolutely', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful']",The Pursuit of Happy Hips with Eoin Finn

Unlike the Power Yoga For Happiness DVDs, the 4 different routines, while containing common segments, each have segments that the others do not have, so each one feels different even with the common pieces spliced in. Do any one of these 4 programs and you will feel everything from sweet to intense release in the region of your hips and glutes. This DVD is a must for people who run and strength train (like me). I actually have been using one short and one long program each week as my yoga antidote to the P90X program.(I will say, though perhaps some would feel differently, that I would not consider this a beginner's yoga DVD, but I don't think beginners are best served learning yoga from DVDs. Live teachers are crucial to help you really understand each pose and work towards flowing into and out of a pose correctly.) So having said that, while the flows move with your breath, there is great attention paid to detail. The guidance into and through the poses, many which are unusual variations of more traditional asanas, is impeccable. And Eoin is such a beautiful and radiant being and his light shines brightly through my TV screen via this DVD.I confess I have done this DVD probably 20 times at this writing and I have cried tears of release and joy at the end of it every single time.Thank you Eoin Finn!

""The Pursuit of Happy Hips"" is his latest DVD and does not disappoint. It is very similar in style and asanas found on the Power Yoga for Happiness titles, however, there is definitely an emphasis on your hips. There are 4 separate Yoga routines on this single DVD. A 50 minute relaxed class focusing on stretching and meditative movement. A ~50 minute physical class that is similar to the ""Strength"" and ""Hip"" class onPower Yoga for Happiness, a shorter version of the physical class (~40 minutes), and a hardcore 80 minute routine. Though none of the asanas are particularly acrobatic(standing pigeon to crow pose with single leg extension is as acrobatic as it gets), the routine is intense, challenging and always interesting. I have been practicing regularly for about 7 years and was amazed at the amount my hips were worked. The class is made up of Canadian Olympians and it feels the flow is geared towards athletes and skiers, but it still feels very much like a yoga class. Though I feel that PYFH1 is Eoin's best, his verbal cues are a bit quirky. In PYFH2 his quirkiness is definitely toned down, but I don't like the work out as much because the lack of backbends. I feel ""The Pursuit of Happy Hips"" is a perfect balance of the 2; a well balanced work out and positive verbal cues.

Eoin has a wonderful non-preaching skill of teaching yoga, which I find very encouraging, but not pushy or domineering like some yoga DVDs are. It seems quite unusual to see so many people on a yoga DVD, unless filmed at a live class - you will see the focus move from Eoin, to the athletes, and back to Eoin. Includes some great and very effective poses for opening the body up generally in addition to the hips:- twisting poses are always so wonderfully invigorating. Within one section, the DVD may go from mountain area to beach and back again - personally I quite like the change of scenery - rather than static filming - which I do not care for at all. Many of the poses will require high levels of flexibility and strength to complete the poses and sequences. Crow pose is a great example of the strength you will need - although the poses are not all quite as advanced. Variations are included for some of the poses.Eoin shares that yoga is about keeping the body soft at times, but also strong:- a very important point. He also lovingly shares many spiritual perspectives on life throughout the DVD, which weaves a wonderful balanced touch of body to spirit on his DVD.The filming quality is impeccable.Suitable for Intermediate to advanced level.",5,"Inspirational Teacher with integrated approach of mind, body & spirit, and some great poses!",1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,2210,"['Easy', 'street', 'days', 'when', 'are', 'tired', 'generally', 'need', 'slower', 'routine', '51', 'mins', 'duration.World', 'Championship', 'hips', 'core', 'strengthening', 'hip', 'opening', 'back', 'forward', 'hand', 'balances', 'twists', 'intense', 'full', 'routine', 'lasting', '79', 'mins.Hot', 'Chocolate', '57', 'mins', 'duration', 'increasing', 'fitness', 'sun', 'salutations', 'core', 'toner', 'section', 'front', 'body', 'stretches', 'back', '.All', 'Downhill', '43', 'mins', 'duration', 'shortest', 'practice', 'nice', 'blend', 'stretches', 'twists', 'hip', 'opening', 'standing', 'poses', 'nothing', 'too', 'strenuous.Extras', 'tips', 'hips', 'knee', 'safety', 'yoga', 'athletics', 'athlete', 'visualization', 'downloads', 'clips', 'Eoin', 'other', 'DVDS.The', 'DVD', 'filmed', 'Whistler', 'Vancouver', 'BC.Each', 'routine', 'comprises', 'many', 'fast', 'paced', 'sequences', 'poses', 'whereby', 'will', 'need', 'good', 'pre-existing', 'fitness', 'levels', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'make', 'most', 'special', 'DVD', 'Eoin', 'wonderful', 'non-preaching', 'skill', 'teaching', 'yoga', 'find', 'very', 'encouraging', 'not', 'pushy', 'domineering', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'are', 'quite', 'unusual', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'filmed', 'live', 'class', 'will', 'see', 'focus', 'move', 'Eoin', 'athletes', 'back', 'Eoin', 'great', 'very', 'effective', 'poses', 'opening', 'body', 'up', 'generally', 'addition', 'hips', 'twisting', 'poses', 'are', 'always', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'invigorating', 'one', 'section', 'DVD', 'may', 'go', 'mountain', 'area', 'beach', 'back', 'again', 'personally', 'quite', 'change', 'scenery', 'rather', 'static', 'filming', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Many', 'poses', 'will', 'require', 'high', 'levels', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'complete', 'poses', 'sequences', 'Crow', 'pose', 'great', 'example', 'strength', 'will', 'need', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'quite', 'advanced', 'Variations', 'are', 'included', 'poses.Eoin', 'shares', 'yoga', 'keeping', 'body', 'soft', 'times', 'also', 'strong', 'very', 'important', 'point', 'also', 'lovingly', 'shares', 'many', 'spiritual', 'perspectives', 'life', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'balanced', 'touch', 'body', 'spirit', 'DVD.The', 'filming', 'quality', 'impeccable.Suitable', 'Intermediate', 'advanced', 'level']",The Pursuit of Happy Hips with Eoin Finn

Through the agitation, I still go back to this dvd because it does the job.  You can choose from a 32 minute practice all the way up to I believe 80 minutes. There is overlap of material like all of his dvds, but it's okay.I do not care about athletes being on a dvd, so I'm not impressed there.  But this is definitely worth purchasing, especially if you have a few months of practice under your belt.  It's great for the hips and there is good cueing throughout.  His wife needs to work a little on how to lead a practice.  Her voice sounds mechanical, but she doesn't have a huge part so it's okay.  Over all, this might be my favorite of his dvds.  I also really like the Power Yoga For Happiness 2: The Surf Edition.  The rest of his dvds are not worth buying if you have Happy Hips & Surf Edition.  I did not see the Blissology Project though.
