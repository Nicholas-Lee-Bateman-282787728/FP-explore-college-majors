The six DVDs give a nice variety, some are a bit more challenging than others, but they all deliver a nice, smooth workout that I think is easy enough for a beginner to follow. I like some of the instructors more than others, and I do find one or two of them flat out annoying, but on the whole I think this is a very good set to add to your collection if you're just starting out. I like that there's a wide variety of workouts, and I also love that there are two workouts per DVD, so you've got enough material here to do a different 20 minute workout a day for twelve days. I'm young and in fairly good shape, so I never really struggled with many of the poses, but it may be more of a challenge if you struggle with flexibility or are overweight.

I have been looking for a way to sneak in some more yoga on non strength training days so I would be less sore and more flexible. This fits the bill.Workouts: There is a great variety of yoga practices - 2 on each DVD that focus on different goals. I would say they are good for the beginner or maybe intermediate.Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Jamaica.Music: Appropriate for yoga.Crew: There are 2 people in each section. One person is explaining the pose and doing a modified or simpler pose, while the other person is demonstrating a more advanced version of the pose.Equipment Needed: You just need a mat (if you have hard floors) and a little space in front of your TV.Instructors: The instructors talk way too much for me, but they are trying to explain the proper form, which may be good for some one with no yoga experience. There are options on the DVDs to hear the instructors plus music or the music only, which I thought was a good idea.",5,Just what I was looking for - 20 minute yoga practices,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1095,"['set', 'DVDs', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'short', '20', 'minute', 'yoga', 'practices', 'can', 'easily', 'do', 'fit', 'schedule', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'way', 'sneak', 'more', 'yoga', 'non', 'strength', 'training', 'days', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'sore', 'more', 'flexible', 'bill.Workouts', 'great', 'variety', 'yoga', 'practices', '2', 'DVD', 'focus', 'different', 'goals', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'good', 'beginner', 'maybe', 'intermediate.Setting', 'DVD', 'set', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'Jamaica.Music', 'Appropriate', 'yoga.Crew', 'are', '2', 'people', 'section', 'One', 'person', 'explaining', 'pose', 'doing', 'modified', 'simpler', 'pose', 'other', 'person', 'demonstrating', 'more', 'advanced', 'version', 'pose.Equipment', 'Needed', 'just', 'need', 'mat', 'have', 'hard', 'floors', 'little', 'space', 'front', 'TV.Instructors', 'instructors', 'talk', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'trying', 'explain', 'proper', 'form', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'yoga', 'experience', 'are', 'options', 'DVDs', 'hear', 'instructors', 'music', 'music', 'only', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea']",N/A

This set is what I think a beginner's yoga DVD should be like - not too easy, not too difficult.  The instructors are friendly.  I was thankful that while the instructors talked about the benefits of yoga, they did not go into ""deep philosophical soliloquys"". The practices are 20-min. long and are themed, which allow the viewer to do short practices (if they don't have the time or are too tired) or to do longer practices, as he/she wishes.  When I bought this, I was training for my first marathon - the 20-min. sequences were perfect stretching programs after my runs.

For one thing, the programs are a little dated.  Also, the interaction between the yoga instructor and the student seems a little false/silly.

Each DVD pretty much follows the same format: one 20-minute season followed by a second of the same type and intensity. A complete yoga workout in 25 minutes has its audiences: the format is ideal for anyone with limits on their time/ patience/ fitness. It works pretty well with kids.I feel deceived that this set doesn't disclose itself as beginner-oriented, however. The flexibility DVD posed some new challenges, but in general the practices are not real ambitious.

I suffer from fibromyalgia and have soft tissue damage in my neck.  For many years I have been going to a massage therapist and spending $30 a week to find relief from my symptoms.  My doctor recommended that I try Yoga or Tai Chi.  I opted for the Yoga.  Getting to a local yoga class was difficult given my schedule.  Being able to do it at home makes my life much easier.  In the short time I have been doing these DVD's the symptoms of my fibromyalgia have decreased.  I am more flexible and relaxed than I have ever been in my life.

I was thrilled when I saw this collection. I love how every workout is broken down into 20 minute segments with clear instructions. These are good routines for yoga enthusiast at all levels.

Privette,"[13, 13]","I've tried to take up yoga several times using other instructional videos, and either fell over during an advanced pose and gave up in disgust, found the instructions difficult to follow and gave up in disgust, or was subjected to some fruity, ""you are one with the earth"" nature talk... and gave up in disgust. But the Yoga Zone videos are none of that. The poses are easy to do, especially since the instructors encourage you to only do as much as your body will allow, and to not strive to do it perfectly or even as well as the instructor. Even though the poses are accessible, the workout is challenging, and you walk away feeling like you've done something to strengthen and tone your body without beating it up. A lot of time is devoted to making sure you understand how to do the poses correctly and what each movement is meant to accomplish, but that doesn't slow down the pace of the instruction. The instructors are pleasant to listen to, but if you feel like you have the routine down pat, the DVD menu will allow you to turn off their talking and just listen to some soothing background music while practicing.
