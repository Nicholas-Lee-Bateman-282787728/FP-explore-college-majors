1527843,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B0077PHME8,Adrien Caldwell,"[1, 4]","One important detail that I found to be a letdown was the application or theory as to how time was considered to be different billions of years ago. They used the term ""time dilation"" to refer to how time has been slowing down since the inception of life and the existence of time itself has slowed down over billions of years. This is supposed to explain how we possibly misinterpreted the six days of creation in the Book of Genesis as representing a period of billions of years. But the universe is not expanding while time is slowing down (this is exactly what the science geek brother said in the movie, by the way). The universe is expanding and time is speeding up. So this completely negates the whole theory provided in this movie.On a slightly different note, the only way time dilation can truly apply is if some race of beings were watching the development of our planet from, I don't know, say some several million light years away perhaps? I'm no science buff by any means but for this time dilation to make sense it seems like someone would have to be recording this information from a very far off place in the universe to create this ""code"" of time discrepancy. And I don't buy that God would provide this information in this manner so that we are left to struggle with some cryptic message that we can unlock after finally arriving to the 21st century. If that were true then why bother accepting the Ten Commandments at literal face value? Weren't the Ten Commandments told to Moses by God also? And wasn't this the case with the Book of Genesis? So why is one thing told to Moses (by God) accepted and understood as literal while another is metaphoric or now involving ""time dilation"" theories necessary to prove validity? It just all gets convoluted if you ask me.SPOILER ALERT: (please don't read if you plan on seeing the movie because this sort of gives away the end)What really annoyed me was how the comatose mother(suffering and dying from incurable pancreatic cancer) magically regains full consciousness toward the end of the movie after her son involves others in a group prayer. Then within minutes, she's all bright eyed and bushy-tailed as if having taken a ten minute nap and is all refreshed - whipping her neck around, engaging strangers and familiar faces and appears as sharp as ever. To my understanding this woman had been in a coma for months. People simply don't snap out of a coma looking all peaceful and fully cognizant. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness, bed sores, weak vocal cords, shock, extreme incoherence, overall body aches and pain, excessive dry mouth just to name a few are the maladies that dying people experience when waking up from a coma. It was so poorly done and looked incredibly unrealistic. I swear, she was so chipper and upbeat I thought she was going to jump out of bed and offer people coffee and fingers sandwiches like some accommodating hostess for all these unannounced visitors.If you go into this movie expecting pure fantasy (which also include the inconsistencies I mentioned previously) mixed in a confusing manner with possible, albeit irrelevant theories, then you might like this movie. I, for one, was hoping for some integrity to leave me pondering some realistic possibilities. Instead, I was disappointed with incongruity and a overly syrupy sweet ending that is an outright insult to any person with average intelligence. I get annoyed when watching ""Disney"" crap with perfect story lines that always have perfect happy little endings. The only reason why I'm giving this movie two stars is because the acting, at times, was quite good. At other times the pastor father and the paleontological professor had some really wordy lines that came off as too contrived and unnatural. But hey, they all seemed like above average actors for not being major, well known Hollywood players. They're just doing their job memorizing loquacious line after line.I think this movie could have had so much potential.

1527849,A1U6S5H7IKUTGD,B0077PHME8,cincy-kid,"[1, 1]","Watching as much as I could of The Genesis Code, it was immediately apparent that this movie couldn't do justice for either side of the science vs. religion debate.  From the forced chemistry between the two main characters to the terrible dialogue...I had to salvage the rest of my free time by turning it off.Blake throwing a little stank on the word ""Christian"" made it seem like poor Kerry was from another planet (atheists insert joke here), rather than a part of the world's largest religious community.Subject matter such as this attracts me.  I think all of us go through (or should go through) a period of self-reflection regarding our beliefs and moral foundation.  As thinking individuals, we crave meaning and direction in life.  We also enjoy being inspired.  Regarding my past issues with religion, I sometimes explain to friends that I didn't ""find Jesus""...I found a therapist.I think most atheists would agree that their views often stem from early life experiences: An overbearing religious environment, indifference about religion, or bad experience(s) - just to name a few.  Adolescence usually fuels the cynicism, and contemporary culture typically justifies festering resentment or a lack of any in-depth meaning to religion.  Those who participate in religion are usually depicted as ignorant or dangerous (a la: Religulous).  While the multiple theologies are often generalized or vaguely summarized, it's hard for a growing number of people to find value in religion.  The sad tension builds as a result.Speaking for myself, I decided religion wasn't for me.  My folks were relatively devout, but never explained much to me.  Certain things I heard, read, and experienced only compounded my confusion and disinterest in being religious.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that all of it was nonsense.I have a strong interest in studying history, which led me to reevaluate a number of things in my life.  I started to obtain a better perspective on how certain religions developed, how the bible is interpreted, and the general attitude of people I've encountered who practice a religion.  It's interesting what dedicating a little research does for acquiring knowledge, insight...and gaining some maturity.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still pretty much an average schmuck with plenty of issues.It could surprise many out there to know that there is a Christian religion that does not look to the bible for historical or scientific guidance.  It also advises that attempting to force someone to have faith is sinful.  It embraces medical and scientific research, natural law, creative thinking, and even discusses the theologies of other religions.  But most importantly (and this is a benefit for non-believers), it teaches that good works in union with faith will offer grace (not sola fide - please look this up).  The latter being the key difference between Catholics and Protestants.Before this comes off as a cheering session for Catholicism, let me first say that Catholics have done a horrible job even discussing the nearly two-thousand year old history and details of the faith.  Clearly, there is plenty to resolve regarding abuses of children, money, etc..  There were plenty of terrible things in history done on behalf of the church.  There are, and will be, foolish people in ALL walks of life.  But what if maybe - just maybe - someone adheres to the very basics of their Christian faith?  Treat others as you would yourself.  The Ten Commandments.  Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's... -- It seems to me that society would remain fairly civil and productive.  While theology is a struggle for many within and without religion, let's not dismiss the compassion and kindness of the majority.  In my book (and I suspect the book upstairs too), these are the things that really matter.My recommendation: Do not look to this movie for guidance.  Research on your own to find what offers the best answers, not just in science and nature, but for a positive direction in life.  Please don't rely on just one source.  Faith (or lack thereof) is something very personal.",2,Falls flat with bad script...,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,4116,"['Watching', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'Genesis', 'Code', 'was', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'side', 'science', 'vs.', 'religion', 'debate', 'forced', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'had', 'salvage', 'rest', 'free', 'time', 'turning', 'off.Blake', 'throwing', 'little', 'stank', 'word', 'Christian', 'made', 'seem', 'poor', 'Kerry', 'was', 'planet', 'atheists', 'insert', 'joke', 'here', 'rather', 'part', 'world', 'largest', 'religious', 'community.Subject', 'matter', 'such', 'think', 'go', 'should', 'go', 'period', 'self-reflection', 'regarding', 'beliefs', 'moral', 'foundation', 'thinking', 'individuals', 'crave', 'meaning', 'direction', 'life', 'also', 'enjoy', 'being', 'inspired', 'Regarding', 'past', 'issues', 'religion', 'sometimes', 'explain', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Jesus', 'found', 'therapist.I', 'think', 'most', 'atheists', 'would', 'agree', 'views', 'often', 'stem', 'early', 'life', 'experiences', 'overbearing', 'religious', 'environment', 'indifference', 'religion', 'bad', 'experience', 's', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Adolescence', 'usually', 'cynicism', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'typically', 'festering', 'resentment', 'lack', 'in-depth', 'meaning', 'religion', 'who', 'participate', 'religion', 'are', 'usually', 'depicted', 'ignorant', 'dangerous', 'la', 'Religulous', 'multiple', 'theologies', 'are', 'often', 'generalized', 'vaguely', 'summarized', 'hard', 'growing', 'number', 'people', 'find', 'value', 'religion', 'sad', 'tension', 'builds', 'result.Speaking', 'decided', 'religion', 'was', ""n't"", 'folks', 'were', 'relatively', 'devout', 'never', 'explained', 'much', 'Certain', 'things', 'heard', 'read', 'experienced', 'only', 'compounded', 'confusion', 'disinterest', 'being', 'religious', 'Eventually', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'nonsense.I', 'have', 'strong', 'interest', 'studying', 'history', 'led', 'reevaluate', 'number', 'things', 'life', 'started', 'obtain', 'better', 'perspective', 'how', 'certain', 'religions', 'developed', 'how', 'bible', 'interpreted', 'general', 'attitude', 'people', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'who', 'practice', 'religion', 'interesting', 'what', 'dedicating', 'little', 'research', 'acquiring', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'gaining', 'maturity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'average', 'schmuck', 'plenty', 'issues.It', 'could', 'surprise', 'many', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'Christian', 'religion', 'not', 'look', 'bible', 'historical', 'scientific', 'guidance', 'also', 'attempting', 'force', 'someone', 'have', 'faith', 'sinful', 'medical', 'scientific', 'research', 'natural', 'law', 'creative', 'thinking', 'even', 'theologies', 'other', 'religions', 'most', 'importantly', 'benefit', 'non-believers', 'good', 'works', 'union', 'faith', 'will', 'offer', 'grace', 'not', 'sola', 'fide', 'please', 'look', 'up', 'latter', 'being', 'key', 'difference', 'Catholics', 'Protestants.Before', 'off', 'cheering', 'session', 'Catholicism', 'let', 'first', 'say', 'Catholics', 'have', 'done', 'horrible', 'job', 'even', 'discussing', 'nearly', 'two-thousand', 'year', 'old', 'history', 'details', 'faith', 'Clearly', 'plenty', 'resolve', 'regarding', 'abuses', 'children', 'money', 'etc..', 'were', 'plenty', 'terrible', 'things', 'history', 'done', 'behalf', 'church', 'are', 'will', 'be', 'foolish', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'what', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'someone', 'very', 'basics', 'Christian', 'faith', 'Treat', 'others', 'would', 'yourself', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Render', 'Caesar', 'things', 'are', 'Caesar', 'society', 'would', 'remain', 'fairly', 'civil', 'productive', 'theology', 'struggle', 'many', 'religion', 'let', 'not', 'dismiss', 'compassion', 'kindness', 'majority', 'book', 'suspect', 'book', 'too', 'are', 'things', 'really', 'recommendation', 'Do', 'not', 'look', 'movie', 'guidance', 'Research', 'own', 'find', 'what', 'best', 'answers', 'not', 'just', 'science', 'nature', 'positive', 'direction', 'life', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'just', 'one', 'source', 'Faith', 'lack', 'thereof', 'something', 'very', 'personal']",The Genesis Code
1527850,A2JI61LBTEHMK4,B0077PHME8,"Cindy Elias ""Snow Moon""","[2, 8]","I was interested in Logan Bartholomew, since he was in some of the Love Come Softly series.  This movie started out on the wrong foot in the very beginning, when Blake (Logan's character) asked Kerry (Sanders) how her sex life was.  He explained that he has never met a pure girl before.  She was attempting an interview with him for a magazine article.  When Kerry meets Blake's buddies later that same day in the bar, for the first time, they tell her that he has many girls.  Whenever Kerry meets Logan, it is frequently in a bar.  As they got to know each other, they met other places.  The behavior of Logan's buddies was quite wild in the first bar scene, like they were trying to show off to Kerry and her two friends.  I liked Sanders and Bartholomew very much, but the storyline was weak and seemed to try to attract a college age audience.  Christians would not meet non-Christians in a bar, if they had a choice of meeting places, it would have been at a coffee shop or a restaurant.The explanation of how science and the Bible agree and differ was quite drawn out, not to say it wasn't interesting.  Kerry speaks out in class when her science teacher tries to explain everything with evolution and this witnessing-type of responses that she gives the teacher seems to annoy him and the guidance counselor.  The professor turns off her comments with humor, trying to show that she's always defending that creation is correct and evolution is not.  Her guidance counselor has a lengthy chat with Kerry trying aggressively persuade her to abandon her Christian beliefs, especially her belief that God created the world.  The guidance counselor makes a visit to Kerry's dad (a minister)at his church office.  He brings up a perverse subject that I would never mention with my children or to anyone for that matter, I found this quite offensive.  Why in the world would the producers of this movie think that that subject ought to be mentioned, did they think children would not watch this film?  I didn't want my children asking me what that topic was.  The movie went in the trash and I wasted my money.  I did like the main characters.  I found it interesting that Kerry's science professor and her dad were good friends, despite their differences in beliefs.  That was cool!Overall, I'd say the movie was weakened with too many bar scenes, sexual references, and a huge inappropriate discussion.  Why would Kerry have anything to do further with a guy who asked her how her sex life was?  Why didn't Kerry stand up to her guidance counselor, when the woman was really over-asserting her position as an evolutionist, anti-creationist.  Kerry was quite passive with the guidance counselor.  I found myself saying, ""Say something!  Defend your Christian belief in creation!""  Kerry just sat there.  The movie ends with Kerry and Bartholomew falling for each other, but that's farfetched.  Blake was a very immoral guy, Kerry a Christian.  It should have taken several years in real life to build trust between them and for her to see a changed character in him, before she could accept him as a boyfriend to be a potential husband someday.  I thought it was unrealistic in that sense.

1527856,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0077PHME8,David Bower,"[6, 11]","A friend of ours suggested we watch this movie which we did for the first time last night. Our first impression was this is a long movie; at 2 hours and 18 minutes it seemed like it was lasting a really long time. The movie had some interesting moments and attempted to portray some of the lighter side of being in school.The major thrust of the story is an effort to reconcile Biblical creation and Cosmological ""science."" I put science in quotes as there seems to be some debate among scientists whether cosmology should even be classified as a science. James E. Gunn, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Astronomy at Princeton University is quoted saying, ""Cosmology may look like a science, but it isn't a science. A basic tenet of science is that you can do repeatable experiments, and you can't do that in cosmology.""It has often been pointed out that creation is a non-repeatable event impossible to duplicate; therefore conclusions concerning the validity of any theory of creation must be confirmed from the available evidence. I am of the opinion the available evidence better supports the Biblical account of creation and in the case of the earth specifically, the impact of the flood as the cause of earth's geology as we see it today. I fully realize the polarizing nature of this comment but stand by my belief that the Biblical account is the true account.I share the concern of other reviewers speaking from a Christian perspective that this movie may be more confusing than enlightening for those seeking the truth concerning creation. I have no problem with any of the first six chapters of Genesis and believe the revelation contained in those chapters is true and have no need of any sort of compromise with cosmology. God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days and that is the beginning and the end of the matter.We also learn from the Bible that this entire universe is to be destroyed and replaced with a new heaven and a new earth and this will be done while we wait and I'm very much inclined to believe we won't have to wait long.",3,More Likely to Confuse than Convince,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2067,"['friend', 'ours', 'suggested', 'watch', 'movie', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'long', 'movie', '2', 'hours', '18', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'was', 'lasting', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'moments', 'attempted', 'portray', 'lighter', 'side', 'being', 'school.The', 'major', 'thrust', 'story', 'effort', 'reconcile', 'Biblical', 'creation', 'Cosmological', 'science', 'put', 'science', 'quotes', 'there', 'be', 'debate', 'scientists', 'cosmology', 'should', 'even', 'be', 'classified', 'science', 'James', 'E.', 'Gunn', 'Eugene', 'Higgins', 'Professor', 'Astronomy', 'Princeton', 'University', 'quoted', 'saying', 'Cosmology', 'may', 'look', 'science', ""n't"", 'science', 'basic', 'tenet', 'science', 'can', 'do', 'repeatable', 'experiments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'cosmology', 'often', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'creation', 'non-repeatable', 'event', 'impossible', 'duplicate', 'conclusions', 'concerning', 'validity', 'theory', 'creation', 'must', 'be', 'confirmed', 'available', 'evidence', 'am', 'opinion', 'available', 'evidence', 'better', 'Biblical', 'account', 'creation', 'case', 'earth', 'specifically', 'impact', 'flood', 'cause', 'earth', 'geology', 'see', 'today', 'fully', 'realize', 'polarizing', 'nature', 'comment', 'stand', 'belief', 'Biblical', 'account', 'true', 'account.I', 'share', 'concern', 'other', 'reviewers', 'speaking', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'confusing', 'enlightening', 'seeking', 'truth', 'concerning', 'creation', 'have', 'problem', 'first', 'six', 'chapters', 'Genesis', 'believe', 'revelation', 'contained', 'chapters', 'true', 'have', 'need', 'sort', 'compromise', 'cosmology', 'God', 'created', 'heavens', 'earth', 'six', 'literal', 'days', 'beginning', 'end', 'matter.We', 'also', 'learn', 'Bible', 'entire', 'universe', 'be', 'destroyed', 'replaced', 'new', 'heaven', 'new', 'earth', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'wait', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'inclined', 'believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'long']",The Genesis Code

1527859,A3L4ZJ6OKPGM3S,B0077PHME8,First Peter,"[3, 6]","My review of the film is presented in two pieces: 1) a review of the film as an artistic piece of entertainment & 2) a brief review of the scientific and theological ideas presented.First off, the film is decent but not great. The premise & story are interesting, but the film works a little too hard to promote its agenda and feels slightly ""forced"" at times. The screenplay dialogue is not particurlary sharp, and the acting performances suffer slightly for this. Also, the romance between the main characters is very formulaic and fails to ooze with chemistry. As this was a ""chaste"" relationship, it would have been nice to see them connect on a deeper non-sexual level, but it just never completely came across on-screen, so their eventual kiss at the end of the film was rather anti-climactic. The sets and production values were decent, particularly for an independent Christian film. Supporting performances by Academy Award winners Ernest Borgnine & Louise Fletcher were excellent. The directing, editing, and cinematography were all adequate, but not exceptional. Overall, the story and ideas are interesting, but their translation to the screen came off as flat at times.Second, I would like to briefly examine the science and theological ideas presented in the film. Genesis Code offers the proposition that secular science and the Bible are in agreement. They further conclude that the literal 6 days of creation and the 15+ billion years promoted by evolutionists are both simultaneously correct. In a 20+ minute scene that seemingly brings the movie to a complete halt, the scientific treatise is offered: By applying General Relativity to the resulting matter distribution, and claims that gravitational time dilation causes time to pass more quickly the further you are from the center of the universe; Thus, two clocks are actually being used to measure time on earth. In Genesis chapter 1, we are using God's clock, and from His vantage point in the universe, only six days passed during creation. From our vantage point and place in the universe, billions of years are passing (this is a gross oversimpliflication). The scientific ideas presented in the film are based on SOME widely accepted concepts. HOWEVER; many scietific researchers have serious issues with the hypothetical physical universe created here. Dr. Russ Humphreys has become the most notable ""young earth"" scientist to embrace these concepts. His writing and research over the past two decades has been groundbreaking, but has also received sharp criticism within the academic community. Here is a link to one of his videos:http://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-D-Russell-Humphreys/dp/0974864935/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1339138400&sr;=1-1There is one deep theological problem with the ideas presented here, and this is it:If you have animal life existing on earth for billions of years prior to the fall of Adam in Genesis 2; then you necessarily must have death and dying prior to Adam's fall. This causes numerous hermeneutical issues which are not addressed in the film.In closing, I would recommend this film to mature Christians as it is provides adequate family entertainment and raises some interesting questions about the Genesis acount in chapter 1. I would not recommend this as an evangelical tool to reach non-Christians as the theology is problematic & confusing.",3,Provacative...and Entertaining!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3370,"['review', 'film', 'presented', 'two', 'pieces', '1', 'review', 'film', 'artistic', 'piece', 'entertainment', '2', 'brief', 'review', 'scientific', 'theological', 'ideas', 'presented.First', 'off', 'film', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'premise', 'story', 'are', 'interesting', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'promote', 'agenda', 'feels', 'slightly', 'forced', 'times', 'screenplay', 'dialogue', 'not', 'particurlary', 'sharp', 'acting', 'performances', 'suffer', 'slightly', 'Also', 'romance', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'formulaic', 'ooze', 'chemistry', 'was', 'chaste', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'connect', 'deeper', 'non-sexual', 'level', 'just', 'never', 'completely', 'came', 'on-screen', 'eventual', 'kiss', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'sets', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'decent', 'particularly', 'independent', 'Christian', 'film', 'Supporting', 'performances', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'were', 'excellent', 'directing', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'were', 'adequate', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Overall', 'story', 'ideas', 'are', 'interesting', 'translation', 'screen', 'came', 'off', 'flat', 'times.Second', 'would', 'like', 'briefly', 'examine', 'science', 'theological', 'ideas', 'presented', 'film', 'Genesis', 'Code', 'proposition', 'secular', 'science', 'Bible', 'are', 'agreement', 'further', 'conclude', 'literal', '6', 'days', 'creation', '15+', 'billion', 'years', 'promoted', 'evolutionists', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'correct', '20+', 'minute', 'scene', 'seemingly', 'movie', 'complete', 'halt', 'scientific', 'treatise', 'offered', 'applying', 'General', 'Relativity', 'resulting', 'matter', 'distribution', 'claims', 'gravitational', 'time', 'dilation', 'causes', 'time', 'pass', 'more', 'quickly', 'further', 'are', 'center', 'universe', 'Thus', 'two', 'clocks', 'are', 'actually', 'being', 'used', 'measure', 'time', 'earth', 'Genesis', 'chapter', '1', 'are', 'using', 'God', 'clock', 'vantage', 'point', 'universe', 'only', 'six', 'days', 'passed', 'creation', 'vantage', 'point', 'place', 'universe', 'billions', 'years', 'are', 'passing', 'gross', 'oversimpliflication', 'scientific', 'ideas', 'presented', 'film', 'are', 'based', 'SOME', 'widely', 'accepted', 'concepts', 'HOWEVER', 'many', 'scietific', 'researchers', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'hypothetical', 'physical', 'universe', 'created', 'here', 'Dr.', 'Russ', 'Humphreys', 'become', 'most', 'notable', 'young', 'earth', 'scientist', 'embrace', 'concepts', 'writing', 'research', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'been', 'groundbreaking', 'also', 'received', 'sharp', 'criticism', 'academic', 'community', 'Here', 'link', 'one', 'videos', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-D-Russell-Humphreys/dp/0974864935/ref=sr_1_1', 's=dvd', 'ie', '=UTF8', 'qid', '=1339138400', 'sr', '=1-1There', 'one', 'deep', 'theological', 'problem', 'ideas', 'presented', 'here', 'have', 'animal', 'life', 'existing', 'earth', 'billions', 'years', 'prior', 'fall', 'Adam', 'Genesis', '2', 'then', 'necessarily', 'must', 'have', 'death', 'dying', 'prior', 'Adam', 'fall', 'numerous', 'hermeneutical', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'addressed', 'film.In', 'closing', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'mature', 'Christians', 'adequate', 'family', 'entertainment', 'interesting', 'questions', 'Genesis', 'acount', 'chapter', '1', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'evangelical', 'tool', 'reach', 'non-Christians', 'theology', 'problematic', 'confusing']",The Genesis Code

Modern science basically explaining HOW God accomplished his work and therefore both accounts may not necessarily be in adversity with each others account.A true Christian who is knowledgeable in the Word of God, the Bible, either the original Roman Catholic Vulgate of approximately 600 a.d. as well the the next great studious work the 1611 King James Protestant version (the 1611 KJV used the original Vulgate as a ""help"" in bringing to us the KJV)...most people are not aware the KJV was somewhat based on the Roman Catholic Vulgate and if you tell some people that they become very upset, especially Baptists.....I am a Baptist who can accept the facts and disagree with other Baptists who disagree that the Vulgate was used to solve problems for the KJV writers.Now, having said the above, their is one big difference between the RC Vulgate and the KJV:  the RC Vulgate has many more books included which we Protestants cannot accept as part of the ""Canon"" of hold scripture...I would hope that Roman Catholics and Protestants both explore the extra books of the Vulgate to see why the KJV linguistic interpreters of 1611 could not accept the ""extra"" books of the Vulgate.In the KJV all but two of the KJV books, both Old and New Testament refer in some way to each other; in my opinion and the opinion of probably the largest part of Protestants this is the largest problem with acceptance of each others interpretation.  That said, to each his or her own faith...this is the United States where we are supposed to have freedom of religion.  Unfortunately there are always some that will insist that their's is the only way.It is incumbant on each human to distinguish which is the correct version with advice from others of their own choosing without pressure applied...this is the great hope of citizens of the U.S.; freedom!!!Having said that the big problem is really this:  Does the movie TRULY depict the thesis that NOW, all the sudden theological studies are now in agreement with currant scientific studies?I have not seen the movie yet and have ordered pre-release copy from Amazon to see for myself and will update this post when I have studied the movie in great depth.  I must say, though, I have never seen anything written that the professors of the colleges (there are a few exceptions)will ever agree that their ""scientific facts"" disprove the Biblical account.

1527864,A1B79U197FOH05,B0077PHME8,"G. M. Casey ""gcasem""","[2, 4]","My wife and I enjoyed this video which we downloaded from Amazon.com.  It has a good human-interest story involving one of the main characters, Blake, his mom, and his grandparents.  The thrust of the movie seems to be to show that the Bible is compatible with evolution, and, in doing so,  the presentation runs into theological and scientific difficulties.If the Bible is compatible with evolution, then there would be billions of years of death and destruction before Adam and Eve came along (as seemingly shown by the evolutionary intepretation of the fossil record), whereas the Bible makes it clear that death came into the world only when Adam sinned.  This of course is the whole reason why Jesus Christ came to the earth, to reconcile a lost world to God.  (By believing in Jesus a person is forgiven of his sins, and freed from the shackles of the sinful nature that was inherited from Adam.)  The real reason for the fossils is the Flood of Noah, which covered the whole world.  We observe sedimentary rock and fossils over the whole globe, even at the tops of mountains.  This is one of the areas where the Bible is very compatible with observational science.To suppose that the Bible agrees with evolution also makes the Bible very unscientific for another reason.  One hundred and fifty years after Darwin, leading evolutionists at leading museums have  admitted that we have fewer transitional forms (animals and plants transitioning from one kind into another) than in Darwin's day.  Please see Luther Sunderland's helpful book, Darwin's Enigma.  Darwin had next to nothing of  transitional forms in his day and this was of major concern to him.The ""physics students"" in the movie attempt to bridge the gap between the days of Genesis 1 and the billions of years of evolution by bringing in Einstien and his theory of relativity, particularly how time is looked at differently depending upon the frame of reference.  They use Einstein's thought experiment of two twins: one travels at the speed of light through the universe, the other stays at home on earth.  These twins see time differently.  The inference  made from this is that God saw time in  billions of years as He created the heavens and the earth, but man saw time only in terms of 24-hour days.  This was all that man could understand, or so it is supposed (there is an evolutionary assumption of cave men here.)  Here we run into another theological problem if we take a good look at Exodus when God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.In Exodus, it is clear that God is communicating to Moses about literal 24-hour days, and is referring to the days of Genesis as also being literal.  This is the only way that God's conversation with Moses can make sense, since God tells Moses that man should work 6 days and rest on the seventh, just as He did Himself when He created the universe and the earth and all life on the earth.  To suppose that God was thinking of a different time frame, in terms of billions or millions of years, leads to absurdity.From a scientific point of view (and I write as a science teacher) the scientific case for Einstein's supposition regarding the twins is not so scientifically sound as the ""physics students"" declare.  The late Dr. L. Essen, a world authority on the measurement of time, questioned the data used in a scientific experiment to support Einstein. He was the inventor of the atomic (cesium) clock that was used in the experiment.  He evaluated the data of the two experimenters, even data that had been ignored by them, and said that they were not warranted in their claim of support for Einstein's notion of time dilation.  Dr. Essen found it very difficult to get his contrary views published in any scientific journal, so sure  is the scientific community of Einstein's theories.  But other scientists have also questioned Einstein as has been pointed out by Dr. Thomas Barnes in his book Physics of the Future.  It is from his book that I drew upon the information about Dr. Essen.I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to the viewing audience, but I would ask them to be cautious about the ""science"" presented.  There definitely is a difference between the known principles and laws of science and evolution which has virtually no scientific support.  The one is quite compatible with the Bible, the other is not.",4,"Yes,  The Bible and Science do Agree, but.....",1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,4359,"['wife', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'downloaded', 'Amazon.com', 'good', 'human-interest', 'story', 'involving', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Blake', 'mom', 'grandparents', 'thrust', 'movie', 'be', 'show', 'Bible', 'compatible', 'evolution', 'doing', 'so', 'presentation', 'theological', 'scientific', 'difficulties.If', 'Bible', 'compatible', 'evolution', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'billions', 'years', 'death', 'destruction', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'came', 'along', 'seemingly', 'shown', 'evolutionary', 'intepretation', 'fossil', 'record', 'Bible', 'clear', 'death', 'came', 'world', 'only', 'when', 'Adam', 'sinned', 'course', 'whole', 'reason', 'why', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'came', 'earth', 'reconcile', 'lost', 'world', 'God', 'believing', 'Jesus', 'person', 'forgiven', 'sins', 'freed', 'shackles', 'sinful', 'nature', 'was', 'inherited', 'Adam', 'real', 'reason', 'fossils', 'Flood', 'Noah', 'covered', 'whole', 'world', 'observe', 'sedimentary', 'rock', 'whole', 'globe', 'even', 'tops', 'mountains', 'one', 'areas', 'where', 'Bible', 'very', 'compatible', 'observational', 'science.To', 'suppose', 'Bible', 'evolution', 'also', 'Bible', 'very', 'unscientific', 'reason', 'One', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'years', 'Darwin', 'leading', 'evolutionists', 'leading', 'museums', 'have', 'admitted', 'have', 'fewer', 'transitional', 'forms', 'animals', 'plants', 'transitioning', 'one', 'kind', 'Darwin', 'day', 'Please', 'see', 'Luther', 'Sunderland', 'helpful', 'book', 'Darwin', 'Enigma', 'Darwin', 'had', 'next', 'nothing', 'transitional', 'forms', 'day', 'was', 'major', 'concern', 'him.The', 'physics', 'students', 'movie', 'attempt', 'bridge', 'gap', 'days', 'Genesis', '1', 'billions', 'years', 'evolution', 'bringing', 'Einstien', 'theory', 'relativity', 'particularly', 'how', 'time', 'looked', 'differently', 'depending', 'frame', 'reference', 'use', 'Einstein', 'thought', 'experiment', 'two', 'twins', 'one', 'travels', 'speed', 'light', 'universe', 'other', 'stays', 'home', 'earth', 'twins', 'see', 'time', 'differently', 'inference', 'made', 'God', 'saw', 'time', 'billions', 'years', 'created', 'heavens', 'earth', 'man', 'saw', 'time', 'only', 'terms', '24-hour', 'days', 'was', 'man', 'could', 'understand', 'supposed', 'evolutionary', 'assumption', 'cave', 'men', 'here', 'Here', 'run', 'theological', 'problem', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'Exodus', 'when', 'God', 'gave', 'Moses', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Mount', 'Sinai.In', 'Exodus', 'clear', 'God', 'communicating', 'Moses', 'literal', '24-hour', 'days', 'referring', 'days', 'Genesis', 'also', 'being', 'literal', 'only', 'way', 'God', 'conversation', 'Moses', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'God', 'Moses', 'man', 'should', 'work', '6', 'days', 'rest', 'seventh', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'created', 'universe', 'earth', 'life', 'earth', 'suppose', 'God', 'was', 'thinking', 'different', 'time', 'frame', 'terms', 'billions', 'millions', 'years', 'absurdity.From', 'scientific', 'point', 'view', 'write', 'science', 'teacher', 'scientific', 'case', 'Einstein', 'supposition', 'regarding', 'twins', 'not', 'so', 'scientifically', 'sound', 'physics', 'students', 'declare', 'late', 'Dr.', 'L.', 'Essen', 'world', 'authority', 'measurement', 'time', 'questioned', 'data', 'used', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'support', 'Einstein', 'was', 'inventor', 'atomic', 'cesium', 'clock', 'was', 'used', 'experiment', 'evaluated', 'data', 'two', 'experimenters', 'even', 'data', 'had', 'been', 'ignored', 'said', 'were', 'not', 'warranted', 'claim', 'support', 'Einstein', 'notion', 'time', 'dilation', 'Dr.', 'Essen', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'get', 'contrary', 'views', 'published', 'scientific', 'journal', 'sure', 'scientific', 'community', 'Einstein', 'theories', 'other', 'scientists', 'have', 'also', 'questioned', 'Einstein', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Thomas', 'Barnes', 'book', 'Physics', 'Future', 'book', 'drew', 'information', 'Dr.', 'Essen.I', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'movie', 'viewing', 'audience', 'would', 'ask', 'be', 'cautious', 'science', 'presented', 'definitely', 'difference', 'known', 'principles', 'laws', 'science', 'evolution', 'virtually', 'scientific', 'support', 'one', 'quite', 'compatible', 'Bible', 'other', 'not']",The Genesis Code

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[59, 76]","Of the 16 customer reviews printed prior to 4/26/12, every single one of them are by one time users whose only review for this site are for this movie. And 14 of them are short 5 star raves. That could mean one of two things. Either the movie strikes such a powerful chord with viewers, it inspires them to go to lengths that they have never done for any other movie, book, or personal product. That's pretty impressive! The other option, of course, seems a little more likely and is far more troubling. However, this being a movie about faith and honor, I'll choose to accept every comment at face value and truly hope that this movie was so inspiring that it touched that many people.For my purposes, I'm going to address the well-intentioned ""The Genesis Code"" as a movie and not as any sort of ideological treatise. I know that the film caters to a particular Christian based audience, but again--this is simply a movie review and not a discourse on what people should or should not believe. The basic premise behind ""The Genesis Code,"" however, is one that intrigues me. With a degree in Biology, I firmly believe in the sciences and the principles of Evolution. I have never thought that the existence of Evolution discounted the presence of a higher being, though. To my way of thinking, the two things do not disprove one another but I have never taken the Bible as a literal history. ""The Genesis Code"" does. Its characters try to reconcile the timeline presented in Genesis with the timeline presented by Evolution, saying that both are correct.The film stars a likable Logan Bartholomew as a star college hockey player whose mother is in a coma. One day he meets a devout school reporter (Kelsey Sanders) assigned to cover his story. (Apparently she has no deadline as the ""interviews"" go on day after day, this is one in-depth piece!) She thinks that faith and prayer will help in his struggles, but he is resistant to their power as a man of science. The film is basically structured into three distinct parts and is far too lengthy at 138 minutes. In Part One, the couple and their friends play cute. Every conversation ends up talking about religion, but it is interspersed among witty dialogue and likable characters. In Part Two, an illustrated lecture is presented discussing The Genesis Code. While they try to keep it entertaining, this segment is about 30 full minutes of exposition and grinds the film's narrative momentum into a complete standstill. It's interesting, but hardly revelatory. Part Three wraps everything up with a bow. The power of prayer becomes a central focus and what was so appealing about the earlier part of the film dissolves into preachiness.The film benefits from small bits by stars as diverse as Louise Fletcher, Ernest Borgnine, Fred Dalton Thompson, Susan Blakely, Lance Henriksen, and Catherine Hicks (in the most thankless role as a patently ridiculous school administrator). But this is largely a show for the younger cast and many of the supporting players are quite engaging. Bartholomew, however, is a find and someone that I think we'll see more of. The film's screenplay relies heavily on people having conversations that would not occur as naturally (or as often) in the real world, but that's to be expected. I thought the first part of the film is surprisingly charming (3 1/2 stars), the lecture segment is interesting but too long (2 1/2 stars), and the teaching moment finale is completely over-the-top (1 1/2 stars).

The story is about Blake who is a very good Hockey player and his struggle and journey toward faith in God. His mother is on life support ,bec she has cancer and his grandparents are about to take her off of life support.He meets this girl( Kerry) who also goes to the same college and has to write a report about him. She is a committed Christian. But she also has her own struggles w/ her faith when her Adviser tells her she needs to put her faith in the background if she wants to have a good career( a struggle that is familiar to many Christians going to a secular college.)Her dad is a minister and plays a vital role for both of their lives.( He is portrait in positive light,what doesn't always happen in movies)His son ,Kerry brother, is a science nut and works in a science museum( I think ) but is not that interested in faith to God. Though he makes a discovery, that he and others from the museum present to Kerry, Blake, her dad and a few others, that reconciles Science w/ the Genesis account of the bible. It was very interesting to watch and listen to that part. It was a good presentation and a good idea how to make this idea part of a  movie. I didn't completely understand everything they said, but it had to do w/ the dimension of time.( need to watch it again to understand better)It sounded pretty interesting and is one way to explain science and the bible. But I pretty sure it is not the only way.I believe more in a young earth, so this movie challenges me to dig more into this subject.What was very interesting,was that the order of what was created first and how Science believes the order happened are the same. The main part was that the bible is true. If I believe the earth was created in 6000 years or millions of years is worth to be debated, but not a salvation issue in my opinion as long as it still validates the bible as being true. I think it's a good movie to watch. Even my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it. ( somewhat Spoiler)The ending was pretty powerful and showed God's mercy for Blake who had asked his Hockey team to support him praying for his mom.God can answer weak prayers, that are from a honest heart.Though I personally believe God wants us to pray for miracles, how they are recorded in the bible and still happen, but that's beside the point.

Blake (Bartholomew) is the star hockey player at his college and is the subject of Kerry's (Sanders) new article. What begins as a simple interview turns into something much much more. Blake's mother is in the hospital and when Kerry mentions prayer she finds out Blake's stance on religion. She turns to her brother in an attempt to prove God is real. I again need to start by saying that I am not a big fan of faith based movies. It's not that I'm not religious it's just that 99% of them are way too cheesy and unbelievable. This one is easily the best one that I have seen. It doesn't force it down your throat but maintains the religious feel through out which is hard to do. JFK is one of my favorite movies for many reasons, but at it's core it is Oliver Stone letting everyone know how he felt. I bring that up because this movie seems like the writers way of letting everyone know how he feels about the religious vs science debate. While there is some hockey scenes in this (which really aren't needed) the meat of the movie takes place in a museum in what is about a half hour of how science can prove the Book Of Genesis is true. As boring as that sounds that scene is the most riveting part of the movie as well as the most exciting lecture I've ever been a part of. Religious or not this is a good movie, but like all faith movies the ending is a little unbelievable which takes a little away from it but still very much worth seeing. Overall, the best of this type of movie I have seen. I give it a B+.",4,The best faith based movie I have seen as well as a very entertaining lecture. Science vs religion is debated.
