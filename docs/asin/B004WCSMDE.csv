1430539,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004WCSMDE,A kids review,"[4, 5]","History's September 11th Memorial Edition contains several powerful and well-made documentaries--particularly 102 Minutes That Changed America, which may be the finest film yet made about that horrible day. And yet the original question still remains: why would we want to subject ourselves to them? After careful consideration, the answer may be in the visceral way that 102 Minutes affects its viewers--it is so harrowing to watch that it shakes us up, which may be exactly what we need at this point, not out of some lip service loyalty to the notion of ""never forget"", but out of a necessity to simply feel something that is recognizable and human, and thus separated from slogans and politics and fear-mongering and war and xenophobia and hate and paranoia and conspiracy theories and ""truth."" Too often in the past decade, we have allowed September 11th to become an abstraction. In the best of these films, it is anything but--it is real, and present, and terrifying.",5,September 11th: Memorial Edition,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,974,"['History', 'September', '11th', 'Memorial', 'Edition', 'several', 'powerful', 'well-made', 'documentaries', 'particularly', '102', 'Minutes', 'Changed', 'America', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'film', 'yet', 'made', 'horrible', 'day', 'yet', 'original', 'question', 'still', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'subject', 'careful', 'consideration', 'answer', 'may', 'be', 'visceral', 'way', '102', 'Minutes', 'viewers', 'so', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'up', 'may', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'point', 'not', 'lip', 'service', 'loyalty', 'notion', 'never', 'forget', 'necessity', 'simply', 'feel', 'something', 'recognizable', 'human', 'thus', 'separated', 'slogans', 'politics', 'fear-mongering', 'war', 'xenophobia', 'hate', 'paranoia', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'truth', 'Too', 'often', 'past', 'decade', 'have', 'allowed', 'September', '11th', 'become', 'abstraction', 'best', 'films', 'anything', 'real', 'present', 'terrifying']",Sept 11th Memorial Edition

1430543,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B004WCSMDE,Robert Byrd,"[14, 14]","I ordered this not knowing what to expect.  It's absolutely riveting, not so much because the horror of 9/11 was pretty compelling in and of itself, but because it is all first person eyewitness accounts of the day.  There are no news reporters (except those who are roaming around like everyone else trying to figure out what the hell is going on), no experts, no blowhards.  There are simply people on the street and in their apartments witnessing the most horrific event of their lives.  It is hands-down the most nail-biting documentary on 9/11 I've seen, and I've seen a few!  Witness the event through the eyes of these damaged souls for yourself.  But I warn you that some of it is difficult to take.",5,Edge of Your Seat Reality!!!,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,707,"['ordered', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'horror', '9/11', 'was', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'first', 'person', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'day', 'are', 'news', 'reporters', 'who', 'are', 'roaming', 'everyone', 'else', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'experts', 'blowhards', 'are', 'simply', 'people', 'street', 'apartments', 'witnessing', 'most', 'horrific', 'event', 'lives', 'hands-down', 'most', 'nail-biting', 'documentary', '9/11', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'event', 'eyes', 'damaged', 'souls', 'warn', 'difficult', 'take']",Sept 11th Memorial Edition

I'm not real sure I'd recommend this film to a friend. Why? In my case, the movie had 2 DVD's and the first worked great. The ""day in the life"" of people all over New York are captured on film by various sources. There's no ""script"". It's pure terror, as seen on the faces of the people.Since the 2nd DVD in the case was defective, I have no clue if it's worthy of a review. The first DVD showing the film of that day is eerie and graphic. It is truly fascinating but I would've preferred hearing more from the victims who were fleeing but most of it was noise, background noise and oftentimes ""muffled"" conversations.",3,Shocking and Tense,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,696,"['September', '11th', 'Memorial', 'EditionI', 'have', 'lot', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'sure', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'friend', 'Why', 'case', 'movie', 'had', '2', 'DVD', 'first', 'worked', 'great', 'day', 'life', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'captured', 'film', 'various', 'sources', 'script', 'pure', 'terror', 'seen', 'people.Since', '2nd', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'defective', 'have', 'clue', 'worthy', 'review', 'first', 'DVD', 'showing', 'film', 'day', 'eerie', 'graphic', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'hearing', 'more', 'victims', 'who', 'were', 'fleeing', 'most', 'was', 'noise', 'background', 'noise', 'muffled', 'conversations']",Sept 11th Memorial Edition
