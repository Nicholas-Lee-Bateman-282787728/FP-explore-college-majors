I enjoyed this, although I didn't realize the mom was the mom until later in the movie since her acting was more like a foster parent or aunt. The dad seemed a little odd in his acting as well, but Ariel was great. The hospital scenes were a little ""low budget"" especially the scene with the tube in Ariel's mouth.

1517409,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006MHZHG2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","There is a confident matter-of-factness that serves the understated appeal of Mark Harris' ""Black Butterfly"" quite well. In its quiet moments, the film does a good job establishing a believable and supportive middle class family. The story revolves around Mahogany Monae as a promising high school swimmer with dreams of Olympic glory. She is a good student, an ideal daughter, a loving influence on her disabled brother, and a loyal girlfriend. The early sequences in the film really get you to appreciate Monae as a character and her interactions with those around her stand in a very positive light. In many ways, you know that this idyllic world must be headed for a speed bump. Soon, the girl's entire existence is going to be shattered by a random act of violence and this event will have long range repercussions on all that love her.The set-up of ""Black Butterfly"" is both simple and effective. While the dialogue and performances do have moments where they come across as stilted, it is easy to forgive such things in this low budget endeavor. When tragedy strikes, the initial reactions to it are handled well and Monae does a good job juggling the conflict. Also of note, the actor that plays her father maintains a nice balance. They handle the difficult material with quite a bit of sensitivity, and that is a great thing. But the movie makes a few glaring missteps that all but derail the subtle effectiveness of its strong points. From the small (Monae is never a convincing swimmer and the Olympic side plot feels poorly conceived) to the large (the villain is drawn in such aggressively broad strokes, he is more caricature than human), the movie made it impossible to fully connect with the emotional core.It doesn't help matters, though, as the film veers into complete melodrama for its final act. With a mysterious death and vengeance plots a plenty, the final scene comes close to being ridiculous. What should have been the emotional climax devolves into silly suspense. Yet despite it failings, I still wanted to root for ""Black Butterfly"" and its heroine that slowly starts to rebuild her life. The film is filled with good intentions, and has talent behind it, it just falters occasionally in the execution. I'd be interested to check out Harris' next project, though, if he continues to refine his storytelling abilities--he may be one to watch.
