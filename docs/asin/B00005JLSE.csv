605367,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JLSE,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","Bob Fosse's ""Chicago"" is a spectacular and naughty musical.  Two Showgirls (Rene'e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are put in the slammer for each murdering their lovers.  Their crimes of passion are presented as petty, but predictable in the Windy City during the Jazz Age.  The only regrets they have are the gallows, and their only deliverance is a greedy and conceited lawyer (played by Richard Gere).  Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.The drama moves from the prison to the stage where the singers unbear their souls for each key scene.  The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.  The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.  Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.  The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.  There is some cynicism in the story, but the playful antics overshadow the darker elements of the movie.",5,The Musical That Works,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1014,"['Bob', 'Fosse', 'Chicago', 'spectacular', 'naughty', 'musical', 'Two', 'Showgirls', 'Rene', 'e', 'Zellweger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'are', 'put', 'slammer', 'murdering', 'lovers', 'crimes', 'passion', 'are', 'presented', 'petty', 'predictable', 'Windy', 'City', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'only', 'regrets', 'have', 'are', 'gallows', 'only', 'deliverance', 'greedy', 'conceited', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Even', 'women', 'are', 'desperate', 'also', 'crave', 'publicity', 'oddly', 'help', 'papers', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'it.The', 'drama', 'moves', 'prison', 'stage', 'where', 'singers', 'unbear', 'souls', 'key', 'scene', 'numbers', 'choreography', 'are', 'steamy', 'smooth', 'story', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'subtlety', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'particularly', 'fun', 'female', 'warden', 'scenes', 'are', 'interspersed', 'well', 'flow', 'good', 'pace', 'cynicism', 'story', 'playful', 'antics', 'overshadow', 'darker', 'elements', 'movie']",Chicago

Chicago is traditional in it's form, and uses the very distinct Fosse dance moves to heat up the screen.  Moulin Rouge uses pop songs along with a classic love story while turning it inside out using modern movie making techniques.I have to say one thing about Chicago.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was so hot in this movie, I am very suprised that the screen didn't burst into flames every time she was on it.  The film's All That Jazz opening is so impressive, it's hard to put into words.  I really liked the part when Velma whips around on ""all...that..."" and it turns into Roxie to complete the line, ""JAZZ!"" as part of her day dream.  Then, as the number continued, Roxie and Fred's movements imitated those being preformed on stage by Velma and the dancers.  It was a good idea from whoever had it.Also, Rob Marshall was the right guy to direct this stuff.  I honestly don't think anyone could have done a better job then he did on Chicago.  And, please, don't compare Rob to Baz!  Both were the right men to direct each movie they made.Some people are complaining that the movie's main characters are all murders or money hungry slimebags.  Well, it is what the original play Chicago was about, and I thought this would be obvious; It is a musical song and dance romp, not meant to be taken so seriously.Finally, I am sure a lot of people who see Chicago will enjoy it.

605370,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005JLSE,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","Chicago quite simply is jaw-dropping. An insatiable, clever, sexy, stylish, and incredibly bizarre masterpiece of film-making that gets the blood pumping and will leave you in awe. A sinful delight that temptingly calls to you and you can't take your eyes off the screen at really any point. Pure eye candy and pure deliciousness that no other musical can match. On top of having endless style, it also packs on quite a story.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It's the 1920's in the most corrupt city in America; Chicago. When a woman named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) murders a man she was sleeping with (And cheating on her husband) after she discovered he lied to her about getting her into show business, she of course ends up going to jail with the possibility of being hanged along with her idol Velma Kelly played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Who killed her husband and sister after she caught them together). They both hire a lawyer named Billy Flynn (Richard Gere); a man who is all about women and money and has never lost a case defending a female client. Roxie and Velma hate each other and are trying to grab all of the media attention by making themselves out to be innocent in some rather strange ways. Now these girls are out to get each other and prove their innocence simultaneously, all while Billy sits back and revels in the glory. Prepare yourself for a film you won't soon forget.MUSIC: Every musical scene is vibrant and filled with life. No musical scene rested on its laurels and they all delivered slam-bang showcases of wonder and amazement. There is not a single bad musical scene, they were all simply amazing and brilliant the whole way through.ACTING: Fantastic and superbly accomplished in every way. There was not a single dull character and they all felt alive and interesting, even the actors I've never been a fan of (Queen Latifah for example). I have absolutely no gripes against any of the performances in this film at all.ACTION: This film was never boring and there was always something happening. Whether it be one of the many amazing musical scenes or even the funny bits of humor, everything came to life. The cinematography, set pieces, and visual look are simply to die for. Though this film is PG-13, this is definitely not a film for kids and at times it is borderline R-rating with the copious sexual content and some scenes of violence. An adult musical all the way.OVERALL: If you have taste in film, then Chicago is a must-have that will blow you away and you will relish every moment of it. A treat for the mind and the soul that burns into your memory and won't let go. The best damn musical to ever hit cinema, period. Go watch it now.THE GOOD: Everything.THE BAD: Nothing.",5,BEST.

605371,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JLSE,Acute Observer,"[0, 10]","Chicago, 2002 filmThe movie opens at a nightclub. A young woman returns for her turn on stage, and sings. Roxie watches from the audience, then leaves with her boyfriend for her apartment. Did Fred lie to her? A bad career move. The police show up to question the husband and wife. Then we get a song to interrupt the story. The victim was a furniture salesman known to them. Was Amos a sap for confessing? ""I'd kill him again!"" ""Once is enough."" Roxie is brought to ""Murderess' Row"" in Cook County Jail. Then we hear a song. [The changing format suggests a split personality.] ""He had it coming"" isn't entertaining or interesting, it just pads out the movie. ""Murder is a form of entertainment in Chicago."" The all-male juries never hanged a woman. [Not true.] Roxie needs a good lawyer: Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he only take the cases he could win?]Billy Flynn wants $5,000 to represent a client (love doesn't pay his bills). This ""satire"" doesn't amuse me. Amos stands by Roxie. Do they mock defense lawyers? Can they raise money for the defense by selling items owned by the accused? Can they generate sympathy with a story about her life? Rehearsing the witness' story? [They all do that; a trial is like a play where the audience decides on success or failure.] The song by Roxie seems deliberately tasteless. The next song plods along, and isn't funny or entertaining. [Was this deliberate?] Velma sings and dances. ""Lay off the caramels."" Next Billy gets another client. [An unbelievable story.] Miss Baxter seems unusually feisty for a millionaire heiress. A tasteless story? Another boring song that takes up too much time. Is the defendant's dress and demeanor part of the act? Does the conflict between Roxie and Billy seem real? Another tasteless act with Catalina. [What is wrong with the writers?]The trial of Roxie Hart begins. ""I'm scared."" Is it all show business or another tasteless and ignorant statement? Roxie explains her ""illicit relations"". Is she well-rehearsed? What an act! ""There ain't no justice in this world!"" There is a surprise witness in court. [A jailhouse snitch?] The cross-examination of Velma Kelly is educational. [Note how this `evidence' was developed.] And so the jury delivers a verdict. [Would married men have sympathy for a man who fools with a married woman?] Then there are shots on the courthouse steps. Another sensation to capture the attention of newspaper readers. Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he access that diary?] And so ""Andy"" returns to his world, and this overlong musical comes to an end. ""Isn't it grand?"" Is there a future for Velma and Roxie? There is no business like show business.I'll bet the original 1927 drama was better than this expensive production. Maurine Watkins wrote this play as a drama student at Yale. She had been a reporter for the Chicago `Tribune', and not in sympathy with the true crime cases used as a basis for her play. ""The Girls of Murder City"" is more educational and entertaining than this musical. Some people say they got away with ""murder"" but if you can justify a killing it is not murder.

Eby,"[8, 10]","Having never seen the musical ""Chicago"", I entered the movie theater with no preconceived notions or expectations and was impressed with ""Chicago"" the film.  I've heard it called the best movie of the year, and I don't agree, but I was greatly entertained; I found myself singing ""All That Jazz"" throughout the car ride home at the top of my lungs.  Transitioning a theatrical piece from the stage to the screen can result in quite a mess, and I was impressed with director Rob Marshall's vision: the musical numbers as fantasy sequences worked much better than I would have thought.  I enjoyed watching non-singers and -dancers plow through the material, and thought all involved pulled it off quite well, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones who really tore into the role of Velma Kelly.  She had just the right tone as a seductive murderess obsessed with fame; Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart seemed a little soft and sweet to be believable as a cold-hearted fame-seeker, but she showed great flair in her singing and dancing.  Even Richard Gere, God bless him, pulled off a few numbers (and camped it up quite amusingly as sleek lawyer Billy Flynn).

Catherine Zeta Jones and Michelle Zellweger are on target in every way. The sets and the story that a bad deed can catapult you to fame are originally done.

605381,A1LBMDHBZJGJ44,B00005JLSE,Alberto Diaz,"[18, 21]","I came to see this movie with some doubt, It had very good reviews and lots of nominations for the Golden Globe, I had seen the trailer and thought, well, it will be either very good or very dull. And since it was Rob Marshall's first movie, it was all a mystery, but then the film started and wow did it rocked, or should I say, it jazzed. I had seen very few musicals, only 3 if you skip Disney's musical/animated films, one good(The Sound of Music), the other also good but also the most depressing film ever(Dancer in the Dark) and one that it had it's moments but just wasn's enough(Moulin Rouge). But Chicago, it blew me away, everything in it was amazing.First, the cast, all of them were magnificent, thank good they all got award-recognition in some award and in some capacity. I was shocked when Richard Gere was ignored completely by the Academy, it was one of the many, but many mistakes it made this year,and yeah sure, even though he would not have won, he should have at least gotten the nomination, I mean, he was great, and he was the one who had it the hardest, because he had 3 musical pieces that involved dancing and singing, and on top of that, a tap with virtually zero musical background, plus the acting in the rest of the film which was great.Ren&eacute;e was the best, at least to me, and she deserved the Oscar, not Nicole, because both were great, but what made Ren&eacute;e better was that she carried out every possible human reaction in Chicago, she cried, she laughed, she sang, she danced, she was angry, she was lusty, she did everything and did it all very good, while Nicole did the same thing all the way through The Hours, she was sad and depressed, that's it, so here is mistake number 2 in the Oscars.Catherine Zeta-Jones was also magnificent, and just as Ren&eacute;e, she looked both very sexy and acted wonderfully, thank God she did get the Oscar, I mean she even sang in the ceremony, pregnant and all, but she did it, and Queen Latifah, although she was surprisingly good, we all knew she had no chance, but anyway, in her case is really just an honor to be nominated, not because she was bad, but because she was against monsters(you know what I mean). And finaly, John C. Reilly, he was fantastic as Amos ""Cellophane"" Hart, and well, I can accept Chris Copper winning, but at least he got the nomination.Then we have the director, in this category I also think the Academy made a huge mistake, not only did the failed to give the award to Scorsese, who was first in line, and before the name got read, I said, it will go either to him, or to Rob Marshall, the ones that really deserved it, but Polanski, come on, I mean, I love his work, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, all great, and The Pianist was magnificent also, but come on, The Pianist was quite similar to Schindler's List, and that doesn't make The Pianist bad, but Chicago and Gangs of New York were movies we have not seen before, and those were the directors that deserved the gold, not a director mixed up in sex offences, but a director who managed to create a wonderful and fantastic world with lots of flash, dash, magnificent performances, dance numbers, and last but not least, all that jazz.Some have complained that Chicago is boring and dumb, well, for those people I can only say one thing, stick to dumb and mass pleasing films like Daredevil, Scream and Just Married, films made to bring joy to numb masses.Chicago is great and I think both people who know a lot about films can love it just as casual movie viewers, and that's good, isn't grand , isn't great, isn't swell. Anyway, I recomend this film a lot, personaly, it's not only good, it's very relaxing, you just sit back and enjoy good filmaking that has humour, sexy women in sexy dance numbers, plus a story with lot's of content and that is very enjoyable. Ofcourse, see it first before buying it, that's something you must do before buying any film, at least in an original release, why? To see if it's worthy of spending give or take [few] bucks on it, I think Chicago is very worthy, and most likely, after you see it, you will feel the same.

605382,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B00005JLSE,Alexander Arsov,"[0, 0]","""Chicago"" is Shakespeare updated. Life is not just a stage. It's showbiz. It really is. Apart from terrific music and dazzling (and dizzying!) choreography, lavish sets and costumes almost to the point of ostentation, this is a musical with a terribly serious message.It is not the showbiz per se that is subjected to a devastating satire here. It is the society's making such a monstrous fuss out of it. In fact, the prime reason for the very existence of showbiz is the media hype created by a smart minority in order to be enjoyed by the brainless masses. When it comes to raw material for hot news, everything will do: murder, adultery, perjury, prison, trial; nothing, however gruesome, morbid or improper, is taboo. Family and friendship are viewed through the all-encompassing lens of sex and money, respectively; any other values or positive qualities you can think of - goodness, truth, love, integrity, honesty, whatever - are perverted on a grand scale. The ""phony celebrity"" of the moment is everything, a ""flash in the pan"" that's forgotten as soon as a new star appears. That's ""Chicago"". It mixes all that and a lot more into a potent cocktail of rambunctious fun and razor-sharp cynicism.There are so many scenes in this movie which stick in the mind as a chewing gum on hot tin roof. Remember the black-and-white, mock-archive footage ranging from tattoos of Roxie's name to her hairstyle being all the rage among young women to baby dolls that look suspiciously like her. What could be a better illustration of social sickness than a mass hysteria over a murderess who can pass for ""reformed sinner"" thanks to brilliant PR? Or the fabulously over-the-top court scene, at breakneck tempo and accompanied by ""all that jazz"", crowned with Roxie's fake fainting and surreptitious ""What a bullseye"". If you know of a more powerful example of the hilarious inefficiency of the law system, not to mention the vast opportunities for its manipulation, let me know about it too.Likewise, the dialogue and the lyrics are brimming with unforgettable lines. Let Billy Flynn sum up the movie for you. No one can do it better:""This trial... the whole world... it's all... show business.""""I don't mean to blow my own horn, but if Jesus Christ lived in Chicago today, and he had come to me and he had five thousand dollars, let's just say things would have turned out differently.""""Would you please tell the audience... err... the jury what happened?""""Give 'em the old razzle dazzle. Razzle razzle 'em. Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it and the reaction will be passionate.""""You're a phony celebrity. You're a flash in the pan. In a couple of weeks, no one's gonna give a s*** [sorry, Amazon censorship, you know how it is] about you. *That's* Chicago.""Even if you don't want to be bothered with any serious issues, you can still enjoy ""Chicago"" as 110 minutes of unabashed fun. This is what makes the movies a real masterpiece: it is relentlessly hilarious. Not the least of its merits is that both Roxie and Velma, the two chief singer-dancer-murderesses, are presented with sympathy and even compassion. These are no caricatures. Nor, for that matter, are the warden of the female prison (Mama) or the genius-lawyer who's never lost a case (Billy Flynn).Despite considerable liberties with reality in terms of both plot and characters, the movie doesn't feel like fantasy at all. It's a real story about real people. Whether you will take to heart the personal or the social implications of it, both or neither, that is up to you. Both are there. And both are dead serious and at the same time stupendously entertaining.The cast is every bit as perfect as the feasts for the eyes and the ears. Catherine Zeta-Jones, in addition to being an amazing singer and dancer, has never looked hotter than she does here; nor has Queen Latifah (Mamma) with her unbelievably capacious bosom. Renee Zellweger (Roxie) is not quite up to the mark as far as singing and dancing are concerned, but she is nevertheless a fine actress. She certainly conveys very convincingly Roxie's transformation from a disingenuous girl in the beginning to a shrewd woman in the end. Nobody plays cocky lawyers better than Richard Gere does. Probably nobody ever has. He is in his element here.All in all, ""Chicago"" is uncannily close to perfection. It can be seen as a farcical comedy pure and simple, and therefore enjoyed without any participation of you central nervous system. Rob Marshall's masterful direction and simply superb choreography are quite enough for that, although the lavish visual side, the pointed dialogue (and lyrics) and the jazzy splendour of the soundtrack do help. On the other hand, masterpieces work on multiple levels. If you're in the right mood, the musical can be seen as a scorching satire of society and its wild but so ephemeral and empty passion for celebrity and scandals. Chicago of the 1920s is a gorgeous setting but the message is pretty timeless. Indeed, not only does it still ring true today, but it becomes more and more relevant.Either way, if you enjoy Bob Fosse's classics ""Cabaret"" (1972) and ""All That Jazz"" (1979), you definitely should see ""Chicago"" (2002) as well; the phrase ""All that jazz"" is indeed quoted in the very first musical number. Since he directed and choreographed the original 1975 Broadway production, it is no wonder that Fosse's influence should pervade the whole movie adaptation. This is all for the better. Rob Marshall knows how to pay homage without becoming a slavish imitator.That's ""Chicago"". A magnificent spectacle with a lot of fun and a lot of food for thought.

As to the essence of the story, I have read reviews here that seem to demand a certain &quot;style&quot; to musicals - happy, uplifting, a champagne toast to life.  In other words, singing nuns, either flying or climbing over mountains.  Musicals are dramas, first.  Cynicism, dispair, murder, death - these are all part of dramas.  Many people don't like &quot;Oklahoma&quot; because of the character of Judd, a murderous loner, who brings tragedy.  &quot;Carousel&quot; tells a story of Billy, a man who learns too late to love, and causes tragedy to those around him.  Both of these musicals are standards of the American theatre.  &quot;The Thre Penny Opera&quot; has its supporters and its detractors, but who would deny that it is art?  Some reviewers quoted here appear to loathe &quot;Chicago&quot; as a downer.  They appear to want a return to the fantasy-type of musical so popular from the 20's to the 70's.  They do not want any deviation from the &quot;formula.&quot; Admittedly, &quot;Chicago&quot; is meant for adults.  What's wrong with that?  Not everything is &quot;Chitty, Chitty Bang Bang,&quot; which most critics dismissed for being far too out of touch with our current cultural sensitities.

605397,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLSE,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","You can credit `Chicago' with bringing the beloved musical back into our lives, even if it doesn't really deserve the full credit.  Just the year before the marvelous (and superior) `Moulin Rouge!' managed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and surely paved the way for `Chicago' to win the Oscar.  The year before that `art house' master Lars von Trier gave us the brilliant `Dancer in the Dark', and while it didn't manage a Best Picture nomination, it caused a major stir with the critics and definitely got a lot of people talking.  So, what I guess I'm trying to say is that, while `Chicago' is regarded as the musical of this generation, it didn't capture that title on its own merits.It is a great film, truly absorbing and thoroughly entertaining; but it is far from the best musical of this generation.Taking a saucy stage play and giving it its due on the big screen is a big undertaking.  I have seen the stage play a few times and devour it every time; it's that stunningly entertaining.  For me, and this should really go for nearly everyone, a musical lives and dies with the VOICES carrying the songs.  If someone cannot sing, they should NOT be in a musical.I wanted to get that out of the way.The film tells the story of Roxie Hart, the aspiring singer who gets a little carried away during a lovers spat and takes a man's life.  Claiming self defense, Roxie gets help from attorney Billy Flynn, who capitalizes off her story to get publicity.  Roxie's doting husband Amos waits in the shadows as his wife's popularity grows, but when Roxie finds herself being `forgotten' by the public she has to go to even greater extremes to keep their attention.I really liked the way that director Gary Marshall constructed the film.  It has this out of body quality to the musical numbers, which makes sense in the setting.  It gives it a very `showy' feel that gives the illusion of watching a cabaret variety show.  This approach is needed to give the film some style; style that suits the premise and atmosphere.The film is very `razzle dazzle'.As far as the performances are concerned, there is a lot of love here.  Thank GOD Catherine Zeta-Jones won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of the washed up Velma Kelly.  She ravishes on screen and just completely engulfs every scene she is in.  Her `song and dance' pleading with Roxie is sensational to put it lightly.  She clearly outshines the rest of the cast, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the cast falters.  A lot has been said about Renee Zellweger and her lack of singing talent.  Like I said, a musical must be judged on the VOICES carrying the songs, but in this case, it is that lack of talent that works in her favor.  She is an aspiring singer, and one gets the impression that she is aspiring because she lacks the talent to really survive.  She is arrogant and pretty confident, but the fact remains that she hasn't made it.  She needs this trial to become a star, and that speaks volumes for her natural talent.  I adore Zellweger here.As far as voices go, one doesn't get much better than Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.  They are the best vocals in the bunch, yet sadly they give the most mediocre performances.  I love Reilly, and in 2002 he had a stellar year (appearing in THREE Best Picture nominees; `Chicago', `Gangs of New York' and `The Hours', as well as the independent film `The Good Girl').  His Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars was clearly a nod to his success as an actor, but he was nominated for the wrong film.  His subdued and emotional work in `The Good Girl' should have nabbed him the nomination.  Latifah has a showier role, and her `vavavavoom' performances really add some color to the film; but she's sadly lacking in screen time.Reading that they once considered Kevin Spacey for the role of Flynn makes me a little sad, since he is not only a stunning actor but a brilliant singer and he would have chewed this up (and may have even walked away with an Oscar) but the lackluster Richard Gere took on the role and just does NOTHING for me here.  His voice is very mediocre, his performances are awkward and while I actually found his quick witted delivery in his spoken scenes to be entertaining he just never really comes together as a complete character to me.I was put off.The film can at times be all over the place, but it makes up for it with ample amounts of style that get poured all over every scene like syrup.

It's sumptuous to look at and thoroughly glorious as far as film-making is concerned. However, an emphatic viewer has a hard time to identify with any of its characters.

Rob Marshall has taken the Bob Fosse musical to the screen with such imaginative direction, editing and choreography that he has made it his own.  Not a copy of Fosse, but a nod to him while being fresh and new.  Fast on its feet and clever as hell, it benefits from great original material that is funny, sexy and smart.The surprising cast of Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Latifah, Gere and Reilly are uniformly terrific.  Who knew John C. Reilly has a beautiful Irish tenor?  They all learned their chops and performed them admirably.I applaud Rob Marshall  not only for the  clever and imaginative construct of constantly cutting back and forth from ""real"" sets to stage, and the rapid razzle dazzle of the editing and direction throughout, but also for bringing the picture in at 107 minutes.  Many directors today do not know how and when to end their films and they go on and on forever passing a half dozen places they could have ended it (the exception being Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films that are actually better in the extended versions).  Chicago gets right to it and never lets up.As I titled this review, I am usually not a big fan of musicals, but this film blew me away.

In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his  way with her, he reveals that he has no connections in showbusiness.  She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him.  Upon discovering that he had an affair, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail.  In jail she finally meets Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale.  The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Billy is more a showbiz P.R agent than a legal lawyer and manipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess.

I'd give it five stars if it was just a little more clearly understood to be humor, but murder is such an un-funny thing.Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a girl in the chorus who had an affair with a furniture dealer because he claimed he could get her a job in a swank nightclub. When she discovered he was lying and he laughed at her, she shot him, then tried to get her auto mechanic husband to take the blame.They met in prison where the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) is doing quite a business in selling favors of various kinds, and apparently collecting them, too. She recommends Roxie see defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has never lost a case. Turns out he's Velma's attorney, too.That's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene. But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere. Might make you think of Jailhouse Rock or Cry Baby. Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly.

Having seen the show on Broadway this past November, I was anticipating a really great movie. I was hoping the movie would fill in holes that a stage show could not-- and it did. Not only did ""Chicago"" more than meet my expectations, it trounced the Broadway show; it just seemed to fit better on a movie-screen. Having said that, it still felt a little like watching a stage show; such as, after each solo, I felt like clapping-- Of course, I didn't; those are the people I make fun of.The performances were incredible. Catherine Zeta Jones was excellent; she not only played the part too the fullest, but she also looked as though she was having a good time. Renne Zellweger was amazing; having not known her to have had a dancing or singing backround, she must have worked really hard. Oddly enough, Queen Latifah was really good...but now that I think about it, her being good isn't that odd; the role really fits her. John C. Reily was also very good, as he was in all of his other roles in every really good movie this year. Richard Gere's performance was good but not great. His solos were definitely the weakest and everyone else outshined him.The director did a great job, too; his eclectic shots were interesting too watch but not overused as some directors do.(Though Scorcesse, still deserves the Oscar.)

Frankly, I don't get how musicals with lackluster songs become so popular. In the Thirties they churred out great musicals like there was no tomorrow, each with at least five unforgettable songs. Some with many more than five. In the Forties the propaganda machine, because of various reasons, put an end to the light and gay musicals of the previous decade. Since then great musicals have been few and far between. I think that's why the drawn-out schlock that Andrew Lloyd Webber spews can be received so much success and dribble like Grease can become a classic.Chicago doesn't have any songs I want to sing or whistle or even humm. Bob Fosse has been dead a long time and this doesn't have that Special Fosse ""thing"".

Richard Gere deserves credit for taking on a musical role: his acting is superb and gives it everything he's got.  Unfortunately his singing is rather weak, which undermines the powerful arrogance he's trying to convey.

On the other hand, Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect as a malevolent murderess: she looks it, acts it, and sings it.

CHICAGO was a Kander/Ebb affair which Bob Fosse choreographed in its original incarnation on the Broadway stage back in the 1970s. This was the team behind CABARET, and they were ushering in a new more thought-provoking form of musical theatre with deep themes about unsavory subjects - here female inmates on death row who hunger more for fame than virtue.  But all of it was done with a glee and aw shucks charm!The movie does not disappoint fans of the show - it stays true to the themes and style of the show.  Some songs are cut, and the book is slightly altered - the biggest change is the real world setting which places most all of the musical numbers inside the characters imaginations.  The songs are inner monologues of how they wished the world was contrasted starkly with the prison/court room setting of the more gritty real world.  The style of the entire film comes from the 70s, and is very reminiscent of Bob Fosse's highly praised adaptation of CABARET into a successful film.  It's a piece of art - it apes the style of CABARET so don't expect MOULIN ROUGE.  No quick edits or way over the top orchestrations or even sets.  This is sexy and streamlined!The cast is top-notch.  Catherine Zeta Jones is amazingly well-suited for this kind of production!  So is Queen Latifah and Richard Gere.  Renee Zellweger is right out of the period, and sings very well!  It's all an homage to old school hoofing and singing.  Wonderful!

While not a mind-blowing completely-over-the-top extravaganza like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; this is definitely a spectacle.  It appears to have been lifted quite faithfully from stage, which is unusual for a movie musical, and I would imagine the live show would be something to see!The performances are top-notch, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lucy Liu (honest!) really stealing the show.  But there's not a bad performance in this film; even a supporting actor like Taye Diggs does a great job with the 30 seconds and handful of lines he has.The downside of this movie is that it is not a &quot;book&quot; musical, to quote the director &amp; writer from the commentary track.  In a book musical, the songs advance the story.  Instead, this is a musical in which the songs comment on the story as it advances, in an attempt to analogize the lives of our main characters with a vaudeville show (again, from the commentary track).  The downside is that this approach causes the movie to really drag in parts, especially toward the beginning.  This becomes a problem because there is so much singing in this movie.  If the songs aren't advancing the story, the story just grinds to a halt for 3-6 minutes until another dollop of narrative is ladled out.  Another peeve of mine was the tap dance number by Gere, performed in counterpoint to his questioning of a witness.  It's a bit too obvious and belabored.  However, I cannot fault the songs or the dance choreography at all.As far as the DVD goes, the extras are somewhat limited: you get a commentary track, a deleted song, and a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and that's it.  On the plus side, there is a DTS audio track if you like that sort of thing, and the video and sound are top-notch.This is an enjoyable film that is at least worth a rent.",4,"Entertaining, musical",1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1906,"['quot', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'fail', 'dazzle', 'superb', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'choreography', 'not', 'mind-blowing', 'completely-over-the-top', 'extravaganza', 'quot', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'quot', 'definitely', 'spectacle', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'quite', 'faithfully', 'stage', 'unusual', 'movie', 'musical', 'would', 'imagine', 'live', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'see', 'performances', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'honest', 'really', 'stealing', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'even', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'great', 'job', '30', 'seconds', 'handful', 'lines', 'has.The', 'downside', 'movie', 'not', 'quot', 'book', 'quot', 'musical', 'quote', 'director', 'amp', 'writer', 'commentary', 'track', 'book', 'musical', 'songs', 'story', 'Instead', 'musical', 'songs', 'comment', 'story', 'attempt', 'analogize', 'lives', 'main', 'characters', 'vaudeville', 'show', 'again', 'commentary', 'track', 'downside', 'approach', 'movie', 'really', 'drag', 'parts', 'especially', 'beginning', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'singing', 'movie', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'advancing', 'story', 'story', 'just', 'halt', '3-6', 'minutes', 'dollop', 'narrative', 'ladled', 'out', 'peeve', 'mine', 'was', 'tap', 'dance', 'number', 'Gere', 'performed', 'counterpoint', 'questioning', 'witness', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'belabored', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'songs', 'dance', 'choreography', 'all.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'deleted', 'song', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'plus', 'side', 'DTS', 'audio', 'track', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'video', 'sound', 'are', 'top-notch.This', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'least', 'rent']",Chicago

605440,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JLSE,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 5]","Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chicago is a brilliant big screen adaptation of choreographer-director Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical. The story's ingenious jabs at tabloid fame and the fleeting tastes of the popular mindset, omnipresent in the 1920's (the movie's setting) and the 1970's (the date of its writing) is just as relevant today in an age where O.J. Simpson, the Menedez Brothers, and Scott Peterson dominate the pop culture airwaves. Set in Capone's backyard in the midst of the Roaring 20's, Chicago turns in an all-star Hollywood cast and breathes much needed life (i.e. box office success) back into the big screen musical. Viewers won't be disappointed.Chicago stars Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Roxie, wife of sweet, boring Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), has an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely (Dominic West) who she thinks knows the right people to get her a gig as a singer at a swanky nightclub. But when Roxie finds out that Fred is just using her, she shoots him dead right there in her bedroom. When Amos arrives, he sticks up for Roxie, telling the police that he shot the intruder. At least, until he finds out that the dead man is Fred Casley, the man who recently sold them their furniture. Retracting his story, the police arrest Roxie for Fred Casely's murder.Meanwhile, sexy songstress and half of a famous Chicago nightclub sister act, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), sits in jail herself awaiting the day of her trial for the murder of her husband and sister (who she caught performing their number ""the spread eagle""). Roxie asks Velma for help, but gets the cold shoulder. But at least one person in the prison is willing to help Roxie. Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), overseer of the woman's prison, will do anything for anyone for the right price. For fifty bucks, she places a phone call to the greatest defense lawyer in modern-day times, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). But a phone call only gets her in the door. Roxie's husband Amos must come up with the money to pay Billy, which he does prior to being quickly forgotten.Manipulating the media to the best of his ability, Billy turns Roxie into an overnight celebrity - the hottest sensation to sweep Chicago since, well - since the next one that will come along... Velma Kelly fades from the headlines, and the two rivals compete with each other for the public's and Billy Flynn's attention.Chicago is a refreshing escape the drudgery of modern day box office blockbusters with its insightful peering into the mob mentality of the public psyche and its colorful characters. Queen Latifah steals the show with her portrayal of Mama Morton in a film packed with knockout performances by Hollywood mainstays. All of the stars sing their own numbers, and the soundtrack is simply spectacular. Broadway purists may be critical of the final product, but no one can doubt that Chicago is as big a hit on screen as it is on stage.

605441,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JLSE,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 3]","Chicago is a well- made musical production that tells the story of several vaudeville ladies in 1920's Chicago who compete for fame and fortune and are willing to sacrifice their reputations, sleep with different men, kill a few people, etc., to advance their careers. This movie was award with the Best Picture Oscar for 2002 and after watching it a couple of times, it is easy to see why it was considered for this prestigious award. The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all- star cast that includes performers like Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifa. With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success. And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.What makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself; in particular, the catchiness of the tunes, the presentation of the songs, and the integration of the songs within the context of the film. Among the many songs in this musical (about 18 of them), some of them are certainly better than others with the standouts being ""I Move On"", ""All I Care About"", and ""All that Jazz"". Many of the others are only average and I have already forgotten most of them- even after watching the movie two times. The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves. The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta- Jones and Renee Zellweger leading the way. Dozens of hot female bodies twist and turn to the music, making you quickly forget about quality of the songs themselves.As far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good. What I like best about it is the character development and the progression of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started. It is interesting to watch as Renee Zellweger's character goes from a sexually dissatisfied woman married to a very homely looking man to a murderess. She is concerned at first that she will spend her life behind bars for killing the man she was having an affair with. Then, realizing her media star power as a woman who shot and killed a man, she forgets about the murder and lavishes in the attention, only to see the spotlight ultimately shift to another person who has an even greater story to tell.All of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves. There is no lip- syncing or dubbed music here. The star performers prove they have earned their celebrity status by performing their own parts. Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain- looking, plain- spoken husband.Overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around. The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable. But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.",4,Chicago is a Top- Notch Musical Production,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,3457,"['Chicago', 'well-', 'made', 'musical', 'production', 'story', 'several', 'vaudeville', 'ladies', '1920', 'Chicago', 'who', 'compete', 'fame', 'fortune', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'reputations', 'sleep', 'different', 'men', 'kill', 'few', 'people', 'etc.', 'advance', 'careers', 'movie', 'was', 'award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '2002', 'watching', 'couple', 'times', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'considered', 'prestigious', 'award', 'story', 'presented', 'musical', 'pretty', 'good', 'packed', 'all-', 'star', 'cast', 'performers', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-', 'Jones', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'combination', 'talent', 'film', 'good', 'chance', 'success', 'Chicago', 'certainly', 'succeed', 'most', 'levels', 'many', 'excellent', 'song', 'dance', 'scenes', 'strong', 'directing', 'Rob', 'Marshall.What', 'musical', 'memorable', 'course', 'music', 'particular', 'catchiness', 'tunes', 'presentation', 'songs', 'integration', 'songs', 'context', 'film', 'many', 'songs', 'musical', '18', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'others', 'standouts', 'being', 'Move', 'Care', 'Jazz', 'Many', 'others', 'are', 'only', 'average', 'have', 'already', 'forgotten', 'most', 'them-', 'even', 'watching', 'movie', 'two', 'times', 'way', 'songs', 'are', 'inserted', 'movie', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'credit', 'timing', 'presentation', 'tunes', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'timing', 'performances', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'hot', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'leading', 'way', 'Dozens', 'hot', 'female', 'bodies', 'twist', 'turn', 'music', 'making', 'quickly', 'forget', 'quality', 'songs', 'themselves.As', 'far', 'story', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'musical', 'otherwise', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'progression', 'lead', 'character', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'down-', 'and-', 'vaudeville', 'wannabe', 'media', 'darling', 'ultimately', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'sexually', 'dissatisfied', 'woman', 'married', 'very', 'homely', 'looking', 'man', 'murderess', 'concerned', 'first', 'will', 'spend', 'life', 'bars', 'killing', 'man', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Then', 'realizing', 'media', 'star', 'power', 'woman', 'who', 'shot', 'killed', 'man', 'murder', 'lavishes', 'attention', 'only', 'see', 'spotlight', 'ultimately', 'shift', 'person', 'who', 'even', 'greater', 'story', 'tell.All', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'important', 'point', 'out', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'others', 'perform', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'lip-', 'syncing', 'dubbed', 'music', 'here', 'star', 'performers', 'prove', 'have', 'earned', 'celebrity', 'status', 'performing', 'own', 'parts', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'especially', 'Zellweger', 'main', 'character', 'John', 'Reilly', 'plain-', 'looking', 'plain-', 'spoken', 'husband.Overall', 'Chicago', 'good', 'musical', 'hot', 'dance', 'scenes', 'good', 'songs', 'star', 'performances', 'around', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'slightly', 'better', 'then', 'not', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'first', 'genre', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'award', 'more', 'thirty', 'years']",Chicago

The performers all acquit themselves well enough but ... somewhere in my video collection, I have a clip of Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera performing on a Tony Awards broadcast and against that, the performers in the film, as fine as they are, pale somewhat.  My main disappointments with this version, are that  1. Mary Sunshine is played by a woman and her song is deleted ...  I guess that would have been too 'decadent' even for Hollywood, aside from being too much of a distraction on the  big screen ... and  2.  The song 'Class' is also gone from the film proper (it is, however, included in the special features).  The other fiddling with the score are distracting, but not really a detriment.  Also, the 'vaudeville act' aspect of the original Broadway show is somewhat muddied but handled fairly well as the film slides from reality to  performing.

He is also best known for his ""Cabaret.""  He died back in the '80s and it was a big loss to the film and stage worlds. However, his work lives on in the marvelous choreography and other creative work he did in the performing arts.  This film has his look and his stamp all over it even though it was done by other filmmakers using his source material.  I saw the stage show back in the '70s and this film is even better but, of course, cinema has advanced since then so the filmmakers had that going for them.  This film also benefits from some exceptional talent.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is a wonderful actress with a very wide range.  She now adds singing and dancing to her repertoire and does a bang-up job.  We knew she could act ever since her arrival with ""Jerry McGuire.""  Richard Gere is the best he's been in a long, long time and he does two show stopping numbers, one nested within the other, both revolving around his conducting the defense trial for murderess Roxie Hart (Zellweger).  He does a marvelous tap-dance in salute to legal defense too which should be played at ABA conventions.  Zeta-Jones does a grand singing and dancing job. I don't think she has quite Zellweger's range of ability but she is very good.  One of the best numbers in the film is done by Roxie's husband, Amos, (John C. Reilley).  It is ""Cellophane"" and he is transformed while singing it.  He's been hiding that talent behind his everyman roles in movie after movie.  Queen Latifah also does a great number plus plays the woman prison warden.  I will be buying this on DVD as soon as it comes out.  It is that good.  The plot line concerns female murderesses and tabloid fame in 1920s Chicago. It would be wonderful to put ""Cabaret,"" ""All That Jazz"" and ""Chicago"" into one boxed DVD set.

Unfortunately, she hits a snag on her path to stardom when she murders the man with whom she had been having an affair.  As she is arrested, her idol, jazz chanteuse Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is also taken off to jail for murdering her unfaithful husband.  Roxie watches as the press flock to Velma, thanks to the talents of hot-shot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), and when she eventually gets Flynn to take on her case as well she suddenly finds herself a headliner -- in the newspapers, anyway.Zeta-Jones has the opening number which sets the stage for the musical, and she does a terrific job.  In fact, most of the vocal and dance performances of the cast are excellent.  Gere turns in a solid performance as Billy Flynn, and supporting players Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly steal the spotlight with exceptionally strong numbers.  The biggest disappointment in my mind was in Zellweger's performance -- Roxie is the star of the show and I didn't feel that she truly filled the role. I frequently found her presence distracting.Director Rob Marshall, known previously for directing the television adaptions of the musicals ANNIE and CINDERELLA, helps the audience accept the fact that the characters spontaneously break into song and dance -- a problem in many musicals on screen and on stage -- by making these sequences spring from Roxie's imagination.  The staging of ""We Both Reached For the Gun"" is fantastic.I can't speak to how closely Marshall's CHICAGO resembles the current Broadway show or the original Broadway cast.

The movie, which is amazing from a musical, entertainment, and technical viewpoint, is mistreated by a lackluster collection of Special Features and a below-average video and audio transfer.The DVD includes a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, which clocks in at about 28 minutes.  The special concludes with a music video for ""All That Jazz"".  Strangely and fortunately, these two features are different than the special and video that came with the soundtrack DVD.  Miramax has also been so kind as to bless us with a multitude of trailers for somewhat random items.  And let us not forget the musical number, ""Class"", which is more of a dissapointment than I expected.  The audio commentary on the film is quite interesting, though, there is something missing.In fact, there is a lot missing on the Chicago DVD.  This very easily could have been a two-disc set, though Miramax decided to take the easy-way out and provide ""enough"" extras.  There was a music video for Anastacia's ""Love is a Crime"" track, which is on the Chicago soundtrack, and is missing from the DVD.

But I'm going to say something which will probably get me in hot water with just about everyone here, and that is that this isn't really a musical. Director Rob Marshall creates a good film, but he also contradicts the traditional musical form by presenting the numbers- save the opening and closing ones- as self-contained soliloquies which are figments of a lead character's imagination. Why did he do it this way? Because he didn't trust a modern-day audience to pay attention to a movie where characters sing or dance in a book's real-time context as a seamless advancement of the plot? (Even the stage version of CHICAGO allows the singing and dancing to go on uninterrupted.) It seems that modern-day filmmakers regard the musical genre as an out-of-date dinosaur which can only be presented to a modern public as a variation on MTV or VH-1. (The above summary makes the same observation, citing the excessive cuts which innterrupt the dance sequences.) Not all filmgoers are 14 years old; some of us want to see a song or dance performed from beginning to end without cutting back and forth to something else. Is this done because the filmmaker assumes we'd be bored to death watching three uninterrupted minutes of one song or dance? If so, don't knock it until you try it. (Obviously it worked in the films WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.)

I watched the movie in theatres hoping that it will exceed my expectations and it did...a lot. The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were!

605462,ANNMHVOXZQU2K,B00005JLSE,"C. N. White ""neilicus107""","[1, 1]","It seems only fitting that in these bleak times, the musical would once again rise to popularity, and take Hollywood's most coveted award.  Musicals had their golden age in the 20's and 30's, in times of moral depravity, alcoholism, economic hardship, and less-than-stellar presidents.  Sound familiar?  Musicals were meant to take the audience to another world, a world of glitz and glamour, but more importantly happiness, romance, and hope.This time around, it's a little different.  Gone is the naivete that was once so abundant in musicals, having been replaced with morally bankrupt characters who care only about themselves and their freedom, fame, and fortune.  The only exception here is Amos Hart, the only decent man to be found in the whole thing.  I wish I could say things work out for him, but, who am I kidding?For the world of Chicago, unlike so many musicals, is not the place where the glitz, glamour, and music take place.  No, the world of Chicago is the world of the selfish, flash-in-the-pan stardom of the real Chicago in the 1920's.  Only the opening number, &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, and the final number, &quot;Nowadays&quot;, take place in the real world - all the glitz and glamour in between is in Roxie's deluded head.  And, in many ways, this Chicago is very realistic.  There were really such things as &quot;Jazz Killers&quot;, women who shot their husbands for various reasons; mainly to get on the front page.So why five stars?  One reviewer gave one star for precisely the reasons I listed above.  Yes, these are reprehensible people (with the exception of Amos), so why watch?  To name but a few reasons, this is an entertaining movie with fantastic singing (Bob Fosse was a genius), stellar choreography and directing, and some of the best acting of the last year - (Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved it, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Richard Gere were robbed (at least the former was nominated.)).  But besides all that, a friend of mine put it best when she said: &quot;it's like a train wreck - it's disgusting and disturbing, but you just can't look away.&quot;Chicago indeed has that quality, and against our better judgement, we can't help but like the characters.  It is a great musical, and even those who for one reason or another may steer clear of this genre should give it a chance - it's not your typical musical.  Instead of whisking us off to a magical land where everything turns out alright, it whisks us back to the Roaring Twenties, where, as my same friend put it: &quot;you just had to keep dancing and drinking, because if you stopped, you just might realize how bad things really were.&quot;",5,Delightfully Depraved,1061251200,"08 19, 2003",2003,2648,"['only', 'fitting', 'bleak', 'times', 'musical', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'rise', 'popularity', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'coveted', 'award', 'Musicals', 'had', 'golden', 'age', '20', '30', 'times', 'moral', 'depravity', 'alcoholism', 'economic', 'hardship', 'less-than-stellar', 'presidents', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Musicals', 'were', 'meant', 'take', 'audience', 'world', 'world', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'more', 'importantly', 'happiness', 'romance', 'hope.This', 'time', 'little', 'different', 'Gone', 'naivete', 'was', 'once', 'so', 'abundant', 'musicals', 'having', 'been', 'replaced', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'characters', 'who', 'care', 'only', 'freedom', 'fame', 'fortune', 'only', 'exception', 'here', 'Amos', 'Hart', 'only', 'decent', 'man', 'be', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'am', 'kidding', 'world', 'Chicago', 'so', 'many', 'musicals', 'not', 'place', 'where', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'music', 'take', 'place', 'No', 'world', 'Chicago', 'world', 'selfish', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'stardom', 'real', 'Chicago', '1920', 'Only', 'opening', 'number', 'quot', 'Jazz', 'quot', 'final', 'number', 'quot', 'Nowadays', 'quot', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'Roxie', 'deluded', 'head', 'many', 'ways', 'Chicago', 'very', 'realistic', 'were', 'really', 'such', 'things', 'quot', 'Jazz', 'Killers', 'quot', 'women', 'who', 'shot', 'husbands', 'various', 'reasons', 'mainly', 'get', 'front', 'page.So', 'why', 'five', 'stars', 'One', 'reviewer', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'precisely', 'reasons', 'listed', 'Yes', 'are', 'reprehensible', 'people', 'exception', 'Amos', 'so', 'why', 'watch', 'name', 'few', 'reasons', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'singing', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'was', 'genius', 'stellar', 'choreography', 'directing', 'best', 'acting', 'last', 'year', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'deserved', 'Phillip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'were', 'robbed', 'least', 'former', 'was', 'nominated.', 'friend', 'mine', 'put', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'quot', 'train', 'wreck', 'disgusting', 'disturbing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away.', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'indeed', 'quality', 'better', 'judgement', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'great', 'musical', 'even', 'who', 'one', 'reason', 'may', 'steer', 'clear', 'genre', 'should', 'give', 'chance', 'not', 'typical', 'musical', 'Instead', 'whisking', 'magical', 'land', 'where', 'everything', 'out', 'alright', 'back', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'where', 'same', 'friend', 'put', 'quot', 'just', 'had', 'keep', 'dancing', 'drinking', 'stopped', 'just', 'might', 'realize', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'really', 'were.', 'quot']",Chicago

Baker,"[4, 5]","That some people just get waaaay to silly when their chosen film doesn't win an Oscar!Chicago is a fabulous film, much stronger than Gangs of New York for one big reason for me, I walked out of Gangs wondering why the movie was made. It was beautifully filmed, well acted by Daniel and others certainly, but the movie had a huge cloud of depression running throughout. And when it got to the end it made me feel like MS' message was ""Life is pointless, you won't make a difference no matter how hard you try, so why bother?""It was really a shame becasue it truly had some good moments and Daniel was just superb, I do think he should have gotten the oscar..but oh well.Now Chicago, ahh Chicago, for a film that is also about a depressing subject like Gangs, the Piano as well as The Hours it left you smiling and humming as you left the theater.My BF who isn't a big musical fan loved this film and we both just had the time of our lives. Even more so since we saw Gangs on the same day!Renee is amazing, she isn't a broadway star but she CAN sing and she was lovely and very convincing as Roxie, who ISN'T supposed to be as talented as Thelma.Catherine Z-J was simply amazing as was Queen Latifah. But who really impressed me was Richard Geer, a lukewarm actor in my opinion and someone I thought was ""OK"" suddenly lit up the screen and impressed me so much. He obviously worked very hard and was so amusing as Billy Flynn, even if the others hadn't been as strong as they were I think I would have enjoyed this film. I've heard folks who've seen the original stage show say the movie is actual stronger and better as they cleanup a choppy plot and made it flow better for the song transitions.As for the Moulin Rouge comments, OK the movie was awesome, it also deserved the Oscar but it didn't get it and that has NOTHING to do with why Chicago did!

605471,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JLSE,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 2]","`Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it.  It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.  Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor).  But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing.I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.  Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that.  She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister.  Through Matron `Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too.  Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit nave husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone.The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star.  She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain.  The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.  Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.  One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's `I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful.`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.  Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.

Catherine Zeta-Jones co-stars as Velma Kelly, a singer/dancer in the same prison for her murder of her stage partner/sister and Husband, who she found in the sack together. Richard Gere plays Billy Flynn, the money-hungry Lawyer representing them both. (He's portrayed as a Jazz-era Johnny Cochran.) All three leads acquit themselves nicely in the song & dance department, especially Zeta-Jones, but to me the real revelations were Queen Latifah (As the Prison Matron) & John C. Reilly (Amos, the cuckold Husband of the ruthless Roxie); Reilly's rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane"" is heartbreaking. (It seems like lately Reilly is in every other movie that comes out, and with the quality of his performances, it's easy to see why.) I also got a kick out of seeing Christine Baranski, Chita Rivera, and Mya in smaller roles. The songs are really catchy, and I think I'm gonna have to check out Chicago on stage next.

605479,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00005JLSE,D. A. Reed,"[0, 0]","Where to begin. The actors I suppose, just to get that out of the way. I hated Renee Zellweger. On the other hand, everyone else was good. But I don't think Lucy Liu should've gotten the billing she did (Christine Baranski [who is a much better singer AND actor than Zellweger] and Taye Diggs were in the film much more than what she was and all she said was five lines). Zellweger definitely can't sing, though I will admit that she was OK on Nowadays. Her vocals are like nails on a chalkboard for me and I can plainly see why she didn't get hardly any of the awards she was nominated for. Which leads into my praise for Jones. Even people who know she has an accent can't tell. Her songs are sung very well and it makes me glad that she sings the majority compared to her costar. Richard Gere, I guess, for me anyway as he was the only one who acted (even Jones looked like she was just smiling and not even emoting when she was on screen), stole the show. The songs are good, I like Jones, Gere, Reilly (who's actually a good actor/singer when he's not making a crappy comedy with Will Ferrell) and Latifah (she's a favorite but it seems a little unfair to compare her to the others as she was already a singer before she got the role). Along with Zellweger, the other major problem I have with this picture is that the songs don't come naturally from the scene (except for All That Jazz, When You're Good To Mama, Razzle Dazzle, Class and the end finale). Unlike other musicals like Sgt. Pepper, The Blues Brothers and Mamma Mia, the people in this film don't burst spontaneously into song. They announce that they're going to go into song, making the story, which flows very nicely, come to a complete halt when a song like Funny Honey, Cell Block Tango, Roxie or I Can't Do It Alone is performed. Roxie comes along and then whoever's singing the song is put upon a stage to sing and we cut back and forth between the performance and the story, proving, at least in my opinion that this musical was never really meant to leave the stage if all they're doing is singing on a stage anyway. I know they're supposed to represent some fantasy world of Roxie's but I highly doubt that anyone would have a fantasy (a seven or eight minute fantasy at that) about the women in the prison singing about how they got there (which in my opinion should've come before Latifah's number to show just how uncomfortable Roxie is in the prison).",3,Tremendously Overrated,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,2433,"['Where', 'begin', 'actors', 'suppose', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'hated', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'other', 'hand', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'billing', 'did', 'Christine', 'Baranski', '[', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'singer', 'AND', 'actor', 'Zellweger', ']', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'were', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'five', 'lines', 'Zellweger', 'definitely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'OK', 'Nowadays', 'vocals', 'are', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'hardly', 'awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'Which', 'praise', 'Jones', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'accent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'songs', 'are', 'sung', 'very', 'well', 'glad', 'majority', 'compared', 'costar', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'guess', 'anyway', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'acted', 'even', 'Jones', 'looked', 'was', 'just', 'smiling', 'not', 'even', 'emoting', 'when', 'was', 'screen', 'stole', 'show', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'like', 'Jones', 'Gere', 'Reilly', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'actor/singer', 'when', 'not', 'making', 'crappy', 'comedy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Latifah', 'favorite', 'little', 'unfair', 'compare', 'others', 'was', 'already', 'singer', 'got', 'role', 'Zellweger', 'other', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'picture', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'naturally', 'scene', 'Jazz', 'When', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Mama', 'Razzle', 'Dazzle', 'Class', 'end', 'finale', 'other', 'musicals', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'people', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'burst', 'spontaneously', 'song', 'announce', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'song', 'making', 'story', 'very', 'nicely', 'come', 'complete', 'halt', 'when', 'song', 'Funny', 'Honey', 'Cell', 'Block', 'Tango', 'Roxie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Alone', 'performed', 'Roxie', 'along', 'then', 'whoever', 'singing', 'song', 'put', 'stage', 'sing', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'performance', 'story', 'proving', 'least', 'opinion', 'musical', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'meant', 'leave', 'stage', ""'re"", 'doing', 'singing', 'stage', 'anyway', 'know', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'represent', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Roxie', 'highly', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'fantasy', 'seven', 'eight', 'minute', 'fantasy', 'women', 'prison', 'singing', 'how', 'got', 'opinion', 'should', ""'ve"", 'come', 'Latifah', 'number', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'Roxie', 'prison']",Chicago

The musical numbers are exuberant and the cast acquits itself well, but it is all in service of a very thin story that makes some fairly obvious points about the fleeting nature of fame.  The film presents grasping, unsympathetic characters, but I felt that the filmmakers were trying to make me sympathize with them rather than skewering them for their conceit and self-centeredness.  Queen Latifah delivers a star-making performance.Director Rob Marshall really does his performers a disservice with his rapid MTV cutting between shots.  He should have allowed his cast to generate energy through their performances rather than attempting to construct it with rapid editing and camera angles.

605489,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JLSE,Deborah Earle,"[2, 4]","The 2002 Oscar winner for Best Picture,""Chicago"" is a musical which has the late Bob Fosse's choreography stamped all over it, although it's really anybody's guess as to whether or not he would have been pleased with this film version of his 1975 stage hit. Happily, the acting was great and the leads did their own singing and dancing.The story is based on the real-life cases of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner, renamed respectively as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly (There was a real Roxie Hart as well, who committed murder in Indiana in the 1910s), who were exhonerated of murder charges by a flashy lawyer in the 1920s.The story begins on a snowy night at the Onyx Club in the Chicago of Al Capone, where the booze flows heavily despite Prohibition laws, and a brassy Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives at work late, stopping to hide the gun she has just used to kill her husband and sister after catching them in bed together. She performs the rousing number, ""All That Jazz"" shortly thereafter as if nothing has happened.Watching her is ex-chorine Roxie, played by a slender, shiny-complexioned and pixie-faced Renee Zellweger, whose unquenchable desire for fame has led her to cheat on her mechanic husband  with a slickster furniture salesman (Dominic West)who falsely claims he has connections that can revamp Roxie's career.Soon, Roxie and Fred Casley scurry over to the Hart's apartment to continue their affair. When Roxie asks Fred, as she has before, when he will introduce her to the club manager, and help her return to showbusiness, Fred admits that he lied. The following confrontation becomes violent and Roxie fatally shoots Fred as he tries to leave.Amos Hart, Roxie's dim-witted but devoted husband(John C. Reilly) tries to cover for her at first as Taye Diggs' Bandleader/Announcer leads us further into the action by introducing Roxie's first number, ""That Funny Honey"", which changes tones as the investigator mentions the victim's name and Amos becomes aware of his wife's infidelity.Roxie is arrested and taken to the Cook County Jail, where Chita Rivera, who originated the role of Velma Kelly on Broadway,has a cameo appearance as inmate Nickie.We are then introduced to Matron Mama Morton(a pretty, regal, and matronly Queen Latifah), and the vaudville numbers continue as she sings the racy and more-than-highly suggestive ""When You're Good to Mama"".As she begins her time in prison, we get to know Roxie's inmates during ""The Cell Block Tango"". Judging from the visuals, where most of the inmates' handkerchiefs came out red  as they finished giving details of their crimes and the Hungarian immigrant's was white, we are to believe that Katalin Helinszki (Ekaterina Chtchelkanova), who was accused of the most heinous of the murders, is innocent.Soon after, Mama Morton pulls a few strings, Defense Attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere, whose early training in stage musicals, like that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' serves him well here) arrives to represent Roxie, who also has push-over journalist/sob-sister, Mary Sunshine(Christine Baranski)in her corner.The song ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" is based on headlines from the actual case, and has the feel of a hymn sung at a revival meeting. It is reflective of Roxie's false repentance for her misdeeds.As the publicity  surrounding Roxie grows, and the opportunistic Flynn begins to devote more time to her than to his previous client, Velma, another potentially lucrative case appears for Billy  when Lucy Liu's pineapple heiress, Kitty Baxter committs a triple homicide(Note that his discussion of this case with dinner guests would not have taken place today), forcing Roxie and Velma to use a few tricks to win back Billy's attention, including a fake pregnancy.Onstage, as the murder-as-entertainment scenario continues, we are treated to the long-suffering but loyal Amos' ""Mr. Cellophane"", and his devotion to his unfaithful and ungrateful wife is heart-rending. But at least he gets more attention than the offscreen family of Fred Casley, who might have given the story an interesting perspective if included.Roxie's falling-out with Billy over his selected courtroom attire for her ends abruptly upon her observation of the tragic results of a poor woman's inability to get proper representation. Noteworthy is the strong anti-immigrant sentiment of the time.Ultimately, Flynn, Velma, and Roxie, razzle-dazzle 'em in court. Lies win out over truth, and style, in the form of Flynn, Velma and Roxie,  wins over substance in the form of Colm Feore's prosecutor, Martin Harrison, Katalin Helinszki, and Amos, and the Hart's neighbor, Mrs. Borusewiz (Jayne Eastwood), who also took the witness stand, as often happens in life.Although acquitted, things didn't end so happily for the real Beulah Annan, whose life ended in a sanitarium in 1928.Belva Gaertner lived to see her story told onstage the year before.But the man-manipulating Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly live to dazzle the world again, and our rollicking tale of cynical truth ends on a positive note for our main players.All one could do in the end is heave a sigh, enjoy the show, and ""All That Jazz""!",4,Manipulating the System,1089331200,"07 9,

Or is this just a spicy entertainment?I'll opt for the latter; however I can tell you that women will find this more agreeable than their spouses.  There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed.  I seriously doubt that this production, in which murder from jealousy is seemingly justified, would have been produced as a musical comedy before the modern era.But never mind.  What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.In particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance.  When she comes on singing ""When You're Good to Momma"" she just about brings the house down.  I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row.  Zeta-Jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.Zellweger, looking almost anorectic compared to the last time I saw her in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)--released only the year before--gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing.  Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta-Jones were at the old song and dance, not having been previous known for being twinkle-toed.You might want to see this to compare how it stands up to a long line of filmland musicals, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc.  Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.",4,Entertainment with an edge,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2247,"['musical', 'tradition', 'musicals', 'are', 'entertaining', 'easy', 'digest', 'yet', 'hours', 'later', 'leave', 'one', 'apprehension', 'really', 'intent', 'story', 'celebrate', 'getting', 'away', 'murder', 'movie', 'statement', 'how', 'murder', 'women', 'emotionally', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'perhaps', 'indictment', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'just', 'spicy', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'opt', 'latter', 'however', 'can', 'tell', 'women', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'agreeable', 'spouses', 'kind', 'historically', 'revisionist', 'feeling', 'sentiments', 'expressed', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'production', 'murder', 'jealousy', 'seemingly', 'justified', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'musical', 'comedy', 'modern', 'era.But', 'never', 'mind', 'What', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Chicago', 'hit', 'Academy', 'Best', 'Picture', '2002', 'are', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'choreographed', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'spiffy', 'direction', 'neat', 'editing', 'lot', 'leggy', 'flesh', 'fine', 'performances', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger.In', 'particular', 'liked', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'performance', 'When', 'singing', 'When', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Momma', 'just', 'brings', 'house', 'also', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'savvy', 'corrupt', 'Boss', 'Lady', 'Murderess', 'Row', 'Zeta-Jones', 'got', 'Oscar', 'best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'was', 'good', 'think', 'Latifah', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'not', 'more', 'so.Zellweger', 'looking', 'almost', 'anorectic', 'compared', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', '2001', 'released', 'only', 'year', 'before', 'solid', 'performance', 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'be', 'honest', 'appeared', 'was', 'doing', 'lot', 'lipsyncing', 'Still', 'one', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'Zeta-Jones', 'were', 'old', 'song', 'dance', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'previous', 'known', 'being', 'twinkle-toed.You', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'compare', 'how', 'up', 'long', 'line', 'filmland', 'musicals', 'such', 'Oklahoma', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'etc', 'Chicago', 'certainly', 'well', 'confines', 'venerable', 'traditional', 'feeling', 'Academy', 'favor', 'just', 'notch', 'best']",Chicago

605496,A3S7WU6DIH71CC,B00005JLSE,Denny Vu Quach,"[3, 6]","Not since ALL THAT JAZZ (1979) have I seen a film musical with as much raw energy as CHICAGO. This is fitting since the former is about the life of the brilliant director-choreographer-composer Bob Fosse, and the latter is an adaptation from his stage musical of the same name. As a matter of fact, the opening number in CHICAGO is &quot;All That Jazz&quot;.CHICAGO has, of course, enough of a rudimentary plot to cement together the dance numbers, which are the film's raison d'tre. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a wannabe dancer in 1930s Chicago, who idolizes Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). However, both are arrested for murder, Roxie having gunned down a duplicitous lover after he reneges on a promise to introduce her to a friend who can get her into the Biz, and Velma for having whacked her husband and her sister when she caught the two in bed together. Thrown into Cook County Jail, both fall under the control of the jolly and corrupt Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton (Queen Latifah), and both retain the services of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a flamboyant lawyer who specializes in defending women accused of homicide, and who's never lost a case.There aren't enough superlatives to describe CHICAGO, and I fear my review won't do it justice. Jones, a former dancer before she turned actress, struts her magnificent stuff beginning with the opening number (&quot;All That Jazz&quot;). Zellweger and Gere, neither hoofers by training, are seemingly miscast - but it works magnificently. All three sing and dance their way through the film in visually stunning choreographed numbers that had the audience clapping after each.As Roxie and Velma worked their way through the criminal and judicial systems, the creators of CHICAGO were astoundingly clever in superimposing a musical version of each step in the process on the &quot;real&quot; one, for examples, the on-site police investigation of Roxie's crime (&quot;Funny Honey&quot;), Matron Morton's introductory speech to her new charges (&quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot;), Flynn's entrance (&quot;All I Care About&quot;), and Roxie's defense (&quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;). My favorite comes during Roxie's trial when Flynn, more showman than counselor, displays his philosophy on defense strategy with the glitzy &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;.CHICAGO is loud, colorful, in-your-face, exuberant entertainment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you don't take the opportunity to see it while it's on the Big Screen at the beginning of 2003, then you're doing yourself a huge injustice. I beg you to see this film! I intend to see it at least once more, and will purchase the CD soundtrack and DVD when they're released. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",5,w energy enough to blow open the cinema's doors,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,2780,"['Not', 'THAT', 'JAZZ', '1979', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'musical', 'as', 'much', 'raw', 'energy', 'CHICAGO', 'fitting', 'former', 'life', 'brilliant', 'director-choreographer-composer', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'latter', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'matter', 'fact', 'opening', 'number', 'CHICAGO', 'quot', 'Jazz', 'quot', '.CHICAGO', 'course', 'enough', 'rudimentary', 'plot', 'cement', 'together', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'film', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'wannabe', 'dancer', '1930s', 'Chicago', 'who', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'However', 'are', 'arrested', 'murder', 'Roxie', 'having', 'gunned', 'down', 'duplicitous', 'lover', 'promise', 'introduce', 'friend', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'Biz', 'Velma', 'having', 'whacked', 'husband', 'sister', 'when', 'caught', 'two', 'bed', 'together', 'Thrown', 'Cook', 'County', 'Jail', 'fall', 'control', 'jolly', 'corrupt', 'Matron', 'quot', 'Mama', 'quot', 'Morton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'retain', 'services', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'flamboyant', 'lawyer', 'who', 'defending', 'women', 'accused', 'homicide', 'who', 'never', 'lost', 'case.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'superlatives', 'describe', 'CHICAGO', 'fear', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Jones', 'former', 'dancer', 'turned', 'actress', 'magnificent', 'stuff', 'beginning', 'opening', 'number', 'quot', 'Jazz', 'quot', 'Zellweger', 'Gere', 'hoofers', 'training', 'are', 'seemingly', 'miscast', 'magnificently', 'three', 'sing', 'dance', 'way', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'choreographed', 'numbers', 'had', 'audience', 'clapping', 'each.As', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'worked', 'way', 'criminal', 'judicial', 'systems', 'creators', 'CHICAGO', 'were', 'astoundingly', 'clever', 'superimposing', 'musical', 'version', 'step', 'process', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'one', 'examples', 'on-site', 'police', 'investigation', 'Roxie', 'crime', 'quot', 'Funny', 'Honey', 'quot', 'Matron', 'Morton', 'introductory', 'speech', 'new', 'charges', 'quot', 'When', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Mama', 'quot', 'Flynn', 'entrance', 'quot', 'Care', 'quot', 'Roxie', 'defense', 'quot', 'Reached', 'Gun', 'quot', 'favorite', 'Roxie', 'trial', 'when', 'Flynn', 'more', 'showman', 'counselor', 'philosophy', 'defense', 'strategy', 'glitzy', 'quot', 'Razzle', 'Dazzle', 'quot', 'loud', 'colorful', 'in-your-face', 'exuberant', 'entertainment', ""'d"", 'give', '10', 'stars', 'could', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Big', 'Screen', 'beginning', '2003', 'then', ""'re"", 'doing', 'huge', 'injustice', 'beg', 'see', 'film', 'intend', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'more', 'will', 'purchase', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'when', ""'re"", 'released', 'text', 'out', 'print', 'unavailable', 'edition', 'title']",Chicago

605499,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JLSE,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[10, 14]","There aren't enough words that I can come up with to say how amazing that ""Chicago"" really is. This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie. There haven't been many musicals in recent years due to the lack of popularity during recent times and naturally, I'm not a big fan of musicals but I think that Chicago brings new life into this genre of movies and has paved the way to bringing musicals back into the front spotlight again for the new generations of movie-goers. DANGER: Possible spoilers ahead, hopefully not.Set in the Jazz Age of the early 1920s, Al Capone was rising to become the notorious Prohibition Era gangster leader, and new fashion trends were causing an uproar. Outside the shadow of Capone's looming shadow, this movie is a tale of two well known dancers who are suspected of killing their husbands after an affair. Roxie Art, who faces possible execution for murdering her abusive boyfriend who constantly rejected her and her estranged husband Amos refused to take blame for it, seeks a money hungry, never-lost-a-case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos.The songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters. Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing. All of the characters in ""Chicago"" are amazing but for me, it's a toss up between Queen Latifah as Matron ""Mama"" Morton, Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelley, and Richard Gere as William Flynn. Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness. All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance. The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters. I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances.Queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron ""Mama"" Morton. Morton offers Roxie Art a deal to get $3K to a lawyer by the name of William `Billy' Flynn who has `never lost a trial' to testify in her favor. Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes. Latifah's vocals are astounding. There's a funny yet good message in her song too. The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones. Velma Kelley play by Jones is also jailed for murdering two people, though it took place before ""Chicago"" started. Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery. I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great. Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film. As Roxie gains the fame that she has longed for though, Velma is forgotten by many and a bitter rivalry ensues between them. Yes, Roxie is a great dancer but isn't anywhere close to Velma's dancing skills in my opinion. Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi-sleazy lawyer Flynn who seems to get the women characters nuts over him. I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING. I would even say that Richard Gere can sing even better than a lot of commercial pop singers in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called ""Mr. Cellophane"".This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. ""Chicago"" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before ""Moulin Rouge"" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century. Maybe ""Chicago"" might have been somewhat overhyped but, it's rare that I say this but, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it and is destined to become a classic in the near future.  For some extra trivia, I myself am native to Chicago and I guess for this reason this movie means so much more to me than it would've otherwise had I not been a Native Chicagoan. Go and see this movie before it's too late as it won't have anywhere near the punch on the small screen like it did the on the movie theatre.",5,And all that jazz has never sounded so good!

But there are some very good scenes (all of which belong to Richard Gere).  Richard Gere stole this movie in my opinion.  It seemed that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellwegger were only supporting players.  True, the characters left a lot to be desired, but Richard Gere played the sleazy lawyer perfectly.  Most of the songs in the movie were lousy.  You're not going to get a great message out of this movie.  But for pure entertainment, watch the Richard Gere parts!

While &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; and &quot;An American In Paris&quot; were both loads of fun and packed with classic moments, &quot;Chicago&quot; has one thing going for it that the afrementioned films do not.  It is &quot;timeless.&quot;  Twenty, thiry years from now somebody somehwere will pop in this movie and declare: &quot;The topics in this film are as relevant today as they were when it was first written in the 1930's.&quot;  To be honest, I saw the production on stage and was not that impressed with the staging or singing.  However, the talent gathered in this film is absolutely stunning.  Renee Zellweger deserved the Oscar for Best Actress, and would have won if not for Nicole Kidman's nomination and Nicole's previous nomination for Moulin Rouge.  But all the performances are astounding.  All the lead actors dance and sing, most notably and oddly snubbed Richard Gere.  His performance was Oscar worthy without a doubt, conjuring an image of Gene Kelly throughout the movie.  His number &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; is not to be missed.  John C. Reilly's &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot; is also an extraordinary moment.  What a voice!  All the singing is great, the costumes are incredibly sexy, and the overally filmaking is top-notch.

Chicago owns it very much to the nifty foot work and dazzling colors by the cast.The plot by itself, isn't deep. In fact, when I watched it, I find it over-the-top and more comical than anything else. There's hardly any emotional depth portrayed by the anyone in the movie but special commendation goes to Queen Latifah whose single stage appearance for When You Good To Mama stole the thunder from almost anyone in the movie. Academy winner Catherine Zeta Jones also deserved praise for her sultry portrayal of Kelly Velma and the rendition of the songs. Renee Zwelleger's Roxie Hart is good but not exceptional. Richard Gere's vocals are obviously enhanced and I would say John C Riley puts in more than a passable effort than Gere.The razzle dazzle culminates in the finale scene with Velma and Roxie performing a very slinky and well-choreographed scene for I Move On against a stunning backdrop of bright lights.In the end, Chicago is fun and entertaining to watch.

I loved this movie.  Renee, Richard and Catherine amazed me with their singing and dancing ability. Especially Renee.  There doesn't seem to be any limit to what she can accomplish.Many are familiar with the story of a woman who murders her lover and then is subjected to all of the surrounding publicity.  This movie gives that story a bit of a spin, making Roxie an aspiring singer (taken with her idol Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays a wonderful Velma) and murdering her lover who supposedly can get her into show biz but has just been using her for sex.The fun begins when Richard Gere, smarmy lawyer agreed to take on her case, because she has $5,000.  This is a role that Gere was made to play.  Gere reeks of slickness and shiftness in the same manner as Johnnie Cochran.  (I almost expected Gere to say something like ""If it doesn't fit you must acquit"") Roxie's trial itself is turned into showbiz.  And how true it rings, given the recent spate of celebrity trials from Winona Ryder to Robert Downey Jr. to the epitome of it all, the OJ trial.  I loved Gere's tap dance; great symbolism for the fact that the truth means nothing - it's all in the presentation.John C. Reilly, who plays Amos, Roxie's husband, is worth noting. His sadness at his wife's trial, is unfliching loyalty and his reaction to his wife's indifference over his love for her are moving. His major number is ""Mr. Cellophane"", which is simply a showstopper. It is poignant, sweet, unassuming and simpe, without all of the glitz and glare that surrounds his wife.  A running joke is that Flynn continualy refers to ""Amos"" as ""Andy"", except one time and I won't spoil that part for you because it is funny.Queen Latifah shines as Mama, the prison matron who is not above being bought.  She really only gets one big musical number which is excels at.Unlike alot of musicals, the music in Chicago is used to advace the story, not interrupt it.  The fact that most of the singing and dancing takes place in Roxie's head are an effective way of telling the story without making it too talky. This was sheer genius on director Rob Marshall's part.  All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango and Roxie's theme are standout numbers, as is the scenes where Flynn is dangling the press like puppets in ""They Both Reached for the Gun"".The overall message in all of this is that fame is fleeting and you better do what you can with your 15 minutes of it because you can be yesterday's news just like that.  One minute you vsn be front page news, the next minute your face may as well be on a milk carton.Chicago does great justice to Bob Fosse's vision.

Pawl ""Dani""","[1, 1]","I must toast director Rob Marshall with a tall glass of champagne (I don't even drink, so this should speak volumes to you why I would break my rule!).  He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the ""big screen"" with smooth grace.  Though, this process was anything but easy, according to the TV show I distinctively recall on Broadway that divulged all kinds of juicy tidbits about production (particularly the great ""blood, sweat and tears"" efforts Richard Gere took in fine tuning his tap dance routine--Gere was previously not known for his dance, partly because he hadn't really formally had to put into practice in a film before.  He went on to showcase his flair for movement in the American remake of SHALL WE DANCE, with Jennifer Lopez.)  Catherine Zeta-Jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!).  Renee Zellwegger had minimal ""formal"" training in dancing, but made improvements in leaps and bounds (no pun intended), which is made evident in the numbers where she appears as a soloist, as well as her duets with Catherine Zeta-Jones.I know I haven't spent much time discussing the plot, but, in all honesty, it is pretty convoluted and I would only ruin the experience of watching the film for you!  I will say that is set during the age of the ""Roaring Twenties,"" and oh boy, did they (rightfully) have something to howl about, back then.  The intrigues associated with fleeting celebrity are examined closely and at their most visceral.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) is the ""up and coming"" singer/dancer who just can't get that big break, and is never really what anyone is looking for. While Velma Hart (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the sultry star with the fashionable bob that no one can get enough of.  It isn't until a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.  No more plot details required, believe me.  What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb & Kander.  Songs like ""All That Jazz"" are featured here.  You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).

605509,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B00005JLSE,dramadude 186,"[4, 6]","Who would have thought an age where movie musicals are all but non-existant would produce one of the most entertaining film musicals of all time?  Although stylistically very different from such acknowledged greats as Singing in the Rain, West Side Story, and My Fair Lady, Chicago easily earns a place among those aforementioned classics.  The film takes the dark source material (made even more so by Bob Fosse's original direction) and transfers it to screen in all its delightful decadence, assaulting the senses and challenging the modern preception of what a musical should be.  The world of musical theatre has changed quite a bit since the 1960s heyday of movie musicals, and Chicago offers a glimpse into the more mature world of today's musicals.The story centers around Roxie Hart, who kills her lover and then attempts to parlay the publicity into a career in showbiz.  Along the way she runs across the similar-minded Velma Kelly, and both of them end up vying for the attention of hotshot lawyer Billy Flinn.  If the story sounds a bit darker than the sugar-coated musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein, it is, yet there is a sense of fun about the entire event that is infectious.  The movie's plot unfolds through some fast-paced and wonderfully acted dialogue scenes, along the way touching upon America's obsession with fame.Of course, the movie's bread and butter are the musical numbers, and Rob Marshall has come up with the brilliant idea of most of the songs being imagined by Roxie and therefore taking place only in her head.  This works especially well for the material, in which most of the numbers comment upon the action rather than reveal plot.  However, Marshall intercuts the songs with plot-advancing tibits, and although some seem turned off by this cut-cut-cut editing choice, I think it gives the movie a kinetic energy that helps speed things along.The numbers themselves are lavishly and inventively staged, and each song manages to differentiate itself from the rest.  Marshall never repeats himself, and the result is a movie which keeps the audience guessing.  Standouts include the famous opening number ""All That Jazz"" and ""The Cell Block Tango,"" which sport simply jaw-dropping choreography and a showmanship that most movie musicals strive for but never achieve.And then there's the talent.  All of the actors do their own singing and dancing, and I personally had no idea some of these actors were so talented.  Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart is at once vulnerable yet tenacious, and she handles her songs well.  She especially scores with ""Roxie,"" and to a lesser extent with ""Nowadays.""  Richard Gere's absolutely charming as self-centered lawyer Billy Flinn, with his tap dance towards the end of the film being his defining moment.But the real finds are Queen Latifa and especially Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Each of them does some stellar work with their dialogue scenes, displaying sharp comic timing and the sort of nuancing only the most accomplished performers achieve.  Both ladies belt out their numbers with confidence, with Latifa using her music background to score a homerun with the showstopping ""When Your Good to Mama.""  Meanwhile, Catherine Zeta-Jones sings, dances, and acts her way to a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Velma Kelly, stealing just about every scene she's in.  Her take on ""All That Jazz"" is nearly worth the price of admission alone.

605510,A3U20DIY3TCSNI,B00005JLSE,drew m,"[3, 8]","This review is not for people who like musicals.  If you do like musicals, then Chicago is a dream come true.  Under Rob Marshall's direction, Chicago manages to achieve the same kind of visceral impact as a live Broadway show, and that is an amazing accomplishment.  The choreography is excellent, the performances are solid, and you're certain to be entertained for a solid two hours......if you like musicals.If you do NOT like musicals (that would be 98% of the heterosexual male population, not that there's anything wrong with it), then do NOT see Chicago.  I don't care if someone forces you to see it - tell them it's for their sake that you don't want to go.  They don't want to sit next to someone rolling their eyes and checking their watch every five minutes, so let them know that.I've always found the musical to be a fundamentally flawed form.  It's always been an invitation for performers to overact and dance around like spastik children.  Musicals also are an excuse for threadbare plots and cliched writing.  They also always inevitably, and painfully, encourage a veritable orgy of Jazz Hands.  And when they're over, their usually chorusless songs rattle around in your head for a solid year, especially when those songs breathlessly shout out single words in an attempt to sound sexy (""Squish!  Cicero!  Lipschitz!"").  Horrifying, indeed.  And Chicago, despite being an all-around excellent musical, doesn't do anything to discourage those stereotypes.  It garnered tons of acting accolades (most notably Catherine Zeta-Jones' Oscar), but no one here is really acting, they're performing.  All you need to know is how many actors were considered for these roles to know it's not exactly a stretch to play these characters.  They're broad, to say the least.Again, if musicals are your thing, then Chicago will probably be your favorite movie of the year.  But musicals are like cats.  If you like them, you adore them.  If you do not like them, you would rather be dragged across a field of thumbtacks than be anywhere near one.  If you are in the latter category, and you can tell by now that I am, then don't go see Chicago.  Nothing about it will convince you otherwise.",2,"If You Do NOT Like Musicals, DON'T See It",1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,2195,"['review', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'musicals', 'do', 'musicals', 'then', 'Chicago', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'direction', 'Chicago', 'achieve', 'same', 'kind', 'visceral', 'impact', 'live', 'Broadway', 'show', 'amazing', 'accomplishment', 'choreography', 'excellent', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', ""'re"", 'certain', 'be', 'entertained', 'solid', 'two', 'hours', 'like', 'musicals.If', 'do', 'NOT', 'musicals', 'would', 'be', '98', '%', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'population', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'then', 'do', 'NOT', 'see', 'Chicago', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'someone', 'forces', 'see', 'tell', 'sake', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'next', 'someone', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'checking', 'watch', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'let', 'know', 'that.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'musical', 'be', 'fundamentally', 'flawed', 'form', 'always', 'been', 'invitation', 'performers', 'overact', 'dance', 'spastik', 'children', 'Musicals', 'also', 'are', 'excuse', 'threadbare', 'plots', 'cliched', 'writing', 'also', 'always', 'inevitably', 'painfully', 'encourage', 'veritable', 'orgy', 'Jazz', 'Hands', 'when', ""'re"", 'usually', 'chorusless', 'songs', 'rattle', 'head', 'solid', 'year', 'especially', 'when', 'songs', 'breathlessly', 'shout', 'out', 'single', 'words', 'attempt', 'sound', 'sexy', 'Squish', 'Cicero', 'Lipschitz', 'Horrifying', 'indeed', 'Chicago', 'being', 'all-around', 'excellent', 'musical', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'discourage', 'stereotypes', 'garnered', 'tons', 'acting', 'accolades', 'most', 'notably', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Oscar', 'one', 'here', 'really', 'acting', ""'re"", 'performing', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'considered', 'roles', 'know', 'not', 'exactly', 'stretch', 'play', 'characters', ""'re"", 'broad', 'say', 'least.Again', 'musicals', 'are', 'thing', 'then', 'Chicago', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'favorite', 'movie', 'year', 'musicals', 'are', 'cats', 'like', 'adore', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'dragged', 'field', 'thumbtacks', 'be', 'anywhere', 'one', 'are', 'latter', 'category', 'can', 'tell', 'now', 'am', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'Chicago', 'Nothing', 'will', 'convince', 'otherwise']",Chicago

Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast &amp; crew.  This is one such example of this!The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two women awaiting trial for murder during the Roaring 20s.  Zelwegger plays Roxie, a somewhat neurotic young woman who dreams of being the &quot;center of attention&quot; on a broadway stage.  Jones plays Velma, a woman who has already experienced such fame.Roxie looks upon everything that happens in her life thru the lens of Vaudeville.  [It's because of this that the film turns out to be a musical].  By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the &quot;celebrity prisoner&quot; who gets all the publicity.Richard Gere plays a fast-talking, suave lawyer who is hoping to get both of the girls off the hook (for a price).  His goal is to manipulate the media, public opinion and the jury in the girl's cases.In the process, Roxie ends up supplanting Velma as the #1 prisoner celebrity.  Ironically, Roxie gets all the attention that she craved all her life, only it's from being a murderess instead of being a star.Lucy Liu has a cameo as a heiress who threatens to usurp the celebrity status from both of them and grab the spotlight for herself.  All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.  There were no body doubles, stand-ins or lip-sinking.  Zelwegger said afterward that this was the most physically demanding movie she'd ever done, and it shows.As a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.  The play was written by a journalist of the time and was a satire on women getting off of murder raps.  The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.While the duet between Jones &amp; Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.  This one is a can't-miss film.  It is feel-good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near-impossible project.....and they nailed it!",5,"Roxie, take me away!",1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,2390,"['Here', 'movie', 'sure', 'really', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'like', 'musicals', 'not', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'ambitious', 'production', 'pulled', 'off', 'beautifully', 'director', 'cast', 'amp', 'crew', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'film', 'stars', 'Renee', 'Zelwegger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'two', 'women', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'murder', 'Roaring', '20s', 'Zelwegger', 'Roxie', 'somewhat', 'neurotic', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'quot', 'center', 'attention', 'quot', 'broadway', 'stage', 'Jones', 'Velma', 'woman', 'who', 'already', 'experienced', 'such', 'fame.Roxie', 'everything', 'life', 'lens', 'Vaudeville', '[', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'musical', ']', 'time', 'prison', 'Velma', 'quot', 'celebrity', 'prisoner', 'quot', 'who', 'publicity.Richard', 'Gere', 'fast-talking', 'suave', 'lawyer', 'who', 'hoping', 'get', 'girls', 'hook', 'price', 'goal', 'manipulate', 'media', 'public', 'opinion', 'jury', 'girl', 'cases.In', 'process', 'Roxie', 'up', 'supplanting', 'Velma', '1', 'prisoner', 'celebrity', 'Ironically', 'Roxie', 'attention', 'craved', 'life', 'only', 'being', 'murderess', 'instead', 'being', 'star.Lucy', 'Liu', 'cameo', 'heiress', 'who', 'usurp', 'celebrity', 'status', 'grab', 'spotlight', 'herself', '3', 'women', 'are', 'cute', '1920s', 'short', 'hairstyles', 'tho', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'hairstyles', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'One', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspects', 'film', 'actors', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'dancing', 'were', 'body', 'stand-ins', 'lip-sinking', 'Zelwegger', 'said', 'afterward', 'was', 'most', 'physically', 'demanding', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'done', 'shows.As', 'sidenote', 'interesting', 'note', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'was', 'published', '1930', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'journalist', 'time', 'was', 'satire', 'women', 'getting', 'murder', 'raps', 'film', 'details', 'how', 'courtroom', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'stage', 'choereographed', 'theatrics', 'as', 'opposed', 'venue', 'finding', 'facts', 'case.While', 'duet', 'Jones', 'amp', 'Zelwegger', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'one', ""can't-miss"", 'film', 'feel-good', 'sense', 'talented', 'group', 'people', 'went', 'tried', 'pull', 'off', 'near-impossible', 'project', '..and', 'nailed']",Chicago

Wow, what a surprise.From the opening scenes and notes of All That Jazz, the movie grabbed me and never let go. Much has been said about the talents of Catherine Zeta Jones and I agree. But for me, the real revelation was Renee Zellweger, an actress I had previously dismissed as one of those personalities who achieved celebrity by default. Granted Zellweger lacks the experience and polish of Zeta Jones but for someone who has never sung or danced before, I found her performance to be outstanding. Her renderings of Funny Honey and Nowadays are beautifully effective.Queen Latifah was also great as Mama Morton and you'll be humming Cell Block Tango well after you leave the theater. John C.

605523,A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW,B00005JLSE,Eric Anderson,"[74, 82]","It is the 1920s in Chicago and we enter this musical film through a saucy nightclub to see Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) performing a duo act of All that Jazz on her own. Only later is it revealed what happened to her sister who was supposed to be the second half of the act. Next we meet Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) who is a naive girl with big dreams of stardom who goes to the slammer for killing her lover. From the moment she enters and we see a brief flash of her imagining herself on stage, we are aware that this film is half reality and half Roxie's dream. Ambitious Roxie has to find a way to get herself out of prison and onto the stage. To do this she creates an innocent persona that is designed by her smooth talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) for the media to bring the public to her support. With his help and the sassy matron of the women's prison 'Mama' Morton (Queen Larifah) Roxie eclipses Velma Kelly's prison girl fame. Her matronly values and repentant attitude have the public enthralled and the jury in tears. But with her newfound celebrity Roxie's head is sent spinning again with plans of musical fame. However, it becomes increasingly obvious that her popularity will be dreadfully short lived if she doesn`t craft a way to remain in the spotlight. Teetering on the brink of superstar celebrity and death row, Roxie will have to give the performance of her life if she wants to save her neck. Filled with beautifully choreographed catchy musical numbers and a pleasing sweep of fast dramatic action, there is never a dull moment in this film. It's a triumphantly enjoyable thing to watch.The greatest reason for this film's success is due to the stunning ensemble of actors many of whom (with the exception of Queen Larifah) we aren't familiar with hearing sing. The cast all excel in both in their musical numbers and acting performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks stunning and is fun in her catty diva role. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is perfect for her part of the innocent, but still determined and quietly vicious, Roxie who will stop at nothing to become a star. Like in the striking film Nurse Betty, Zellweger's character again confuses reality with her dreams and her subtle facial shifts and movement meaningfully represent her psychological conflict. Most surprisingly, Richard Gere delivers a fantastic performance as the slimy lawyer proving that this actor can really do comedy well. Then there are notable performances in minor roles that leave an impact such as Queen Latifah`s sultry money-hungry matron, Christine Baranski as the hilarious news reporter Mary Sunshine, John C Reilly as Roxie's neglected but still loving husband Amos Hart and Lucy Liu as the vicious ball-busting heiress Kitty.Those familiar with the famous stage show of Chicago will not be disappointed because this film maintains its focus on the musical and dance numbers as the centerpiece. In fact, the meaning of Roxie's psychological confusion between reality and fantasy is wonderfully accentuated by the film's ability to quickly cut between the drab, harsh reality and the glamorous, jazzy corners of Roxie's imagination. The director Rob Marshall excellently filmed all the dance numbers to focus on particular moves as well as capture the full action of the performances for the fullest effect. This movie is a fine example of how a musical film can succeed where its pertinent counterpart (as both films focus on a female on death row) Dancer in the Dark failed. The musical numbers all take a vital role in both accentuating plot detail and enjoyably moving the film along. Likewise, the story does not take itself too seriously preferring to revel in the fantastic music and thrilling story rather than focus on any specific moral meaning. That isn't to say that this film isn't emotionally engaging. It excels in its ability to entertain you as well as draw you into an exciting story of fame, glamour and death.",5,Divas to Die For,1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,3960,"['1920s', 'Chicago', 'enter', 'musical', 'film', 'saucy', 'nightclub', 'see', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'performing', 'duo', 'act', 'Jazz', 'own', 'Only', 'later', 'revealed', 'what', 'happened', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'second', 'half', 'act', 'meet', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'naive', 'girl', 'big', 'dreams', 'stardom', 'who', 'slammer', 'killing', 'lover', 'moment', 'enters', 'see', 'brief', 'flash', 'imagining', 'stage', 'are', 'aware', 'film', 'half', 'reality', 'half', 'Roxie', 'dream', 'Ambitious', 'Roxie', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'prison', 'stage', 'do', 'innocent', 'persona', 'designed', 'smooth', 'talking', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'media', 'bring', 'public', 'support', 'help', 'sassy', 'matron', 'women', 'prison', ""'Mama"", 'Morton', 'Queen', 'Larifah', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'prison', 'girl', 'fame', 'matronly', 'values', 'repentant', 'attitude', 'have', 'public', 'enthralled', 'jury', 'tears', 'newfound', 'celebrity', 'Roxie', 'head', 'sent', 'spinning', 'again', 'plans', 'musical', 'fame', 'However', 'increasingly', 'obvious', 'popularity', 'will', 'be', 'dreadfully', 'short', 'lived', 'doesn', 't', 'craft', 'way', 'remain', 'spotlight', 'Teetering', 'brink', 'superstar', 'celebrity', 'death', 'row', 'Roxie', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'performance', 'life', 'save', 'neck', 'Filled', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'catchy', 'musical', 'numbers', 'pleasing', 'sweep', 'fast', 'dramatic', 'action', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'film', 'triumphantly', 'enjoyable', 'thing', 'watch.The', 'greatest', 'reason', 'film', 'success', 'due', 'stunning', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'exception', 'Queen', 'Larifah', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'hearing', 'sing', 'cast', 'excel', 'musical', 'numbers', 'acting', 'performances', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'looks', 'stunning', 'fun', 'catty', 'diva', 'role', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'perfect', 'part', 'innocent', 'still', 'determined', 'quietly', 'vicious', 'Roxie', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'become', 'star', 'striking', 'film', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'again', 'reality', 'dreams', 'subtle', 'facial', 'shifts', 'movement', 'meaningfully', 'represent', 'psychological', 'conflict', 'Most', 'surprisingly', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'slimy', 'lawyer', 'proving', 'actor', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'comedy', 'well', 'Then', 'are', 'notable', 'performances', 'minor', 'roles', 'leave', 'impact', 'such', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 's', 'sultry', 'money-hungry', 'matron', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'hilarious', 'news', 'reporter', 'Mary', 'Sunshine', 'John', 'C', 'Reilly', 'Roxie', 'neglected', 'still', 'loving', 'husband', 'Amos', 'Hart', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'vicious', 'ball-busting', 'heiress', 'Kitty.Those', 'familiar', 'famous', 'stage', 'show', 'Chicago', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'focus', 'musical', 'dance', 'numbers', 'centerpiece', 'fact', 'meaning', 'Roxie', 'psychological', 'confusion', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'wonderfully', 'accentuated', 'film', 'ability', 'quickly', 'cut', 'drab', 'harsh', 'reality', 'glamorous', 'jazzy', 'corners', 'Roxie', 'imagination', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'excellently', 'filmed', 'dance', 'numbers', 'focus', 'particular', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'capture', 'full', 'action', 'performances', 'fullest', 'effect', 'movie', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'musical', 'film', 'can', 'succeed', 'where', 'pertinent', 'counterpart', 'films', 'focus', 'female', 'death', 'row', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'failed', 'musical', 'numbers', 'take', 'vital', 'role', 'accentuating', 'plot', 'detail', 'enjoyably', 'moving', 'film', 'Likewise', 'story', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'preferring', 'revel', 'fantastic', 'music', 'thrilling', 'story', 'rather', 'focus', 'specific', 'moral', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'ability', 'entertain', 'as', 'well', 'draw', 'exciting', 'story', 'fame', 'glamour', 'death']",Chicago

I had high hopes overall, generated from the &quot;buzz&quot; surrounding the film.But I sat in the cinema and nearly fell asleep halfway through. I don't know why. I later got my hands on the DVD and watched it again and appreciated it much more. I don't know what the difference was the second time around, but somehow the film worked more seamlessly and was highly stylized and entertaining to me upon second viewing. I found the performances more compelling, the music more catchy. Movieviewing in general is more a question of your frame of mind when you see a film. The first time I saw it I was annoyed, the cinema was full, and there was an annoying woman next to me who left her mobile on and kept ignoring it instead of just turning it off. And of course in Iceland there are intermissions in the middle of most films, so the continuity is interrupted.I was especially impressed with the performances of Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly. While the rest of the cast was impressive and obviously did a great deal of preparation for their roles, I simply preferred the smaller, more understated roles.There is not a lot I can add to what other reviewers have said except to say that if you found yourself in a similar position... not really getting into the movie the first time around, you might want to give it a second chance.",4,ON SECOND THOUGHT,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,1564,"['saw', 'cinema', 'originally', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'had', 'so', 'loved', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'general', 'dislike', 'musicals', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'doubts', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'overall', 'dislike', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'overall', 'generated', 'quot', 'quot', 'surrounding', 'film.But', 'sat', 'cinema', 'nearly', 'fell', 'asleep', 'halfway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'later', 'got', 'hands', 'DVD', 'watched', 'again', 'appreciated', 'much', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'difference', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'somehow', 'film', 'worked', 'more', 'seamlessly', 'was', 'highly', 'stylized', 'entertaining', 'second', 'viewing', 'found', 'performances', 'more', 'compelling', 'music', 'more', 'catchy', 'Movieviewing', 'general', 'more', 'question', 'frame', 'mind', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'annoyed', 'cinema', 'was', 'full', 'was', 'annoying', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'mobile', 'kept', 'ignoring', 'instead', 'just', 'turning', 'off', 'course', 'Iceland', 'are', 'intermissions', 'middle', 'most', 'films', 'continuity', 'interrupted.I', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'performances', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'impressive', 'obviously', 'did', 'great', 'deal', 'preparation', 'roles', 'simply', 'preferred', 'smaller', 'more', 'understated', 'roles.There', 'not', 'lot', 'can', 'add', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'say', 'found', 'similar', 'position', 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'second', 'chance']",Chicago

605527,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B00005JLSE,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[6, 16]","The story is a juicy one.The plot centres around two scorned woman. The first is Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a famed vaudeville performer who kills her cheating husband and sister. The other is Roxy Hart (Renee Zellweger), a wannabe vaudeville star who kills her abusive lover. Both women battle it out in prison for the attentions of their lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the media. Being skillfully manipulated by Billy, Roxy becomes a media sensation and major celebrity to the dismay of her rival, Velma.The musicals message is an unpleasant one. Especially when considering that both woman were killers and despite this, they are portrayed as victims and come out on top. Now I am by no means stating that I take offence to the content. It takes a lot more than the glorification of 2 beautiful murderers to offend me. As a matter of fact, since I was never a fan of the musical, the racy storyline was what convinced me to watch this. Juicy tales of murderous mayhem and scandalous, amoral women will be a huge draw for many.With that said, I will never understand why this movie won so many Oscars. Was it Hollywood trying to revive the movie musical by making them popular again? Or is there truth in the claim that ""Chicago"" or Miramax bought the Oscars?Who knows but this film was far from being the ""Best Picture"" of 2002. Especially when compared to the other nominees. As I have already mentioned, I was never a fan of the musical. I always found the music too bland and other than the show's most famous number, ""All That Jazz"", which is indeed great, there isn't another song in the score that catches the imagination. In my opinion, the melodies are forgettable. The film, despite it's glossy exterior was shallow in it's core.The film starts off well, with Catherine Zeta-Jones doing a pretty good rendition of ""All That Jazz"". I will admit that Zeta-Jones has great stage presence and a good voice but was it Oscar worthy? I'm not so sure. However when compared to others in the cast, Catherine is indeed, sensational. Renee Zelwegger on the other hand, is a good actress but her voice is too thin and rather unimpressive. It's still far superior and much more pleasing to the ears than Richard Gere's voice which I found to be beyond annoying. Gere's instrument (if I can call it that) was grating and my ear drums suffered greatly. The only other actor in the piece that has some musical abilities is Queen Latifah. Admittedly, she is a charming performer with some real talent. Her solo number is also pretty entertaining but I ask again, was her performance Oscar worthy? I have yet to meet someone who, after seeing this film has firmly answered my question with a convincing yes. As much as I like Queen Latifah, she does nothing here that she hasn't already done in her music videos. Her performance was hardly ground-breaking. Her nomination, along with others in the cast, with the possible exception of Zeta-Jones, caused the elimination of other actors who were far more worthy of it. That's a shame.Catherine Zeta-Jones's opening act and Latifah's charming number are definitely film highlights. Another scene that I have to admit is expertly done is the ""Cell Block Tango"". It features several black-clad women showing off their fine figures and dancing skills and the scene is enhanced by some great choreography and Zeta-Jones, who is again, fantastic here. The rest of the musical performances are not really worth mentioning. They're glitzy but mindless. All style with no substance. Lacking intricate choreography, emotion and skill. They substitute it with colour and flash.Another problem I had was that this film cheated a little. It seems the makers of ""Chicago"" didn't have much faith in today's audience and the genre and instead of making this a straight-forward musical, they decided to justify the musical numbers by featuring them as being a figment of Roxy's imagination. The musical numbers are structured and played out like music videos and I think this was a cop-out. I would have much preferred a more traditional musical theatre experience.Those who love this film, love it a lot but there are a countless others who feel that the much-hyped ""Chicago"" didn't deserve all of it's praise.

I like musicals and loved Moulin Rouge, so I thought I'd give this one a try. However, after viewing, I was a bit puzzled at all the fuss and acclaim this movie received and continues to receive.Chicago, while visually stunning and artistically impressive (in that the actors did their own singing), is a shallow, cynical, superficial, and unsympathetic story. Most movies rely upon story and plot for their strength; not so Chicago, whose only redeeming quality is the song and dance they put on.The main problem with the story is that there are virtually no sympathetic main characters. To take that a step further, the main characters are all frauds, and the story's message is shallow. The two somewhat redeeming characters, Roxie's husband and the woman who is hanged, are both pretty much invisible and discarded in the film. Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly are both in jail for murder, and both have hopes and dreams of making it, being a big star, and having people adore them, so they call upon a slimebag attorney, Billy Flynn, to help them out. Roxie and Velma take turns lying and deceiving each other so they can get the fame in Chicago. Roxie openly admits she cheated on her husband, is oblivious to the fact that he's spent his life savings to get her a lawyer, and uses every trick in the book  (including pretending that she has an illegitimate child) to ensure that she is the center of the newspaper headlines. Velma is a conceited fame-hungry snob who bribes the prison ward and only sucks up to Roxie when she realizing she is losing the fame war. From here we have a battle over popularity, as the two think of shenanigans to steal the headlines from each other. Who will win out? Who cares.The message basically projected in this film is that its legitimate to whatever it takes to get ahead in this world--lie, cheat, steal, commit adultery--and, in fact, it might make you a star!Are we are suppose to root for two back-stabbing, deceitful, murderesses who walk over people just to get their claim to fame all because they can sing and dance? Or how about a double-crossing, pompous, lying, money-hungry lawyer looking for the next damsel charged with murder? No thanks. I say throw them all in jail.Watching this film, I found it mystifying how so many people and critics could love this movie so much. Granted the story's plot has probably changed from the musical version on stage, but the movie version falls quite short of its glowing reviews. Moreover, how could this film have received six Oscars in 2002? I liken the Oscar committee of 2002 to the gullible Chicago citizens in the film, falling over and swooning at something that puts on a little song and dance. Maybe Chicago was the Academy Award's apology for Moulin Rouge not getting any Oscars the previous year.If you want to see a musical that is vastly superior, has heart, style and substance, and better acting, see Moulin Rouge.",2,Shallow and Frivolous,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,3000,"['many', 'years', 'wanting', 'see', 'film', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'view', 'like', 'musicals', 'loved', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', 'try', 'However', 'viewing', 'was', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'fuss', 'acclaim', 'movie', 'received', 'receive.Chicago', 'visually', 'stunning', 'artistically', 'impressive', 'actors', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'shallow', 'cynical', 'superficial', 'unsympathetic', 'story', 'Most', 'movies', 'rely', 'story', 'plot', 'strength', 'not', 'Chicago', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'song', 'dance', 'put', 'on.The', 'main', 'problem', 'story', 'are', 'virtually', 'sympathetic', 'main', 'characters', 'take', 'step', 'further', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'frauds', 'story', 'message', 'shallow', 'two', 'somewhat', 'redeeming', 'characters', 'Roxie', 'husband', 'woman', 'who', 'hanged', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'invisible', 'discarded', 'film', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'are', 'jail', 'murder', 'have', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'making', 'being', 'big', 'star', 'having', 'people', 'call', 'slimebag', 'attorney', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'help', 'out', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'take', 'turns', 'lying', 'deceiving', 'other', 'can', 'get', 'fame', 'Chicago', 'Roxie', 'openly', 'cheated', 'husband', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'spent', 'life', 'savings', 'get', 'lawyer', 'trick', 'book', 'including', 'pretending', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'ensure', 'center', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'Velma', 'conceited', 'fame-hungry', 'snob', 'who', 'prison', 'ward', 'only', 'up', 'Roxie', 'when', 'realizing', 'losing', 'fame', 'war', 'here', 'have', 'battle', 'popularity', 'two', 'think', 'shenanigans', 'steal', 'headlines', 'other', 'Who', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'Who', 'cares.The', 'message', 'basically', 'projected', 'film', 'legitimate', 'whatever', 'get', 'ahead', 'world', 'lie', 'cheat', 'steal', 'commit', 'adultery', 'fact', 'might', 'make', 'star', 'are', 'suppose', 'root', 'two', 'back-stabbing', 'deceitful', 'murderesses', 'who', 'walk', 'people', 'just', 'get', 'claim', 'fame', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'how', 'double-crossing', 'pompous', 'lying', 'money-hungry', 'lawyer', 'looking', 'next', 'damsel', 'charged', 'murder', 'thanks', 'say', 'throw', 'jail.Watching', 'film', 'found', 'mystifying', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'critics', 'could', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Granted', 'story', 'plot', 'probably', 'changed', 'musical', 'version', 'stage', 'movie', 'version', 'quite', 'short', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'Moreover', 'how', 'could', 'film', 'have', 'received', 'six', 'Oscars', '2002', 'liken', 'Oscar', 'committee', '2002', 'gullible', 'Chicago', 'citizens', 'film', 'falling', 'swooning', 'something', 'little', 'song', 'dance', 'Maybe', 'Chicago', 'was', 'Academy', 'Award', 'apology', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'not', 'getting', 'Oscars', 'previous', 'year.If', 'want', 'see', 'musical', 'vastly', 'superior', 'heart', 'style', 'substance', 'better', 'acting', 'see', 'Moulin', 'Rouge']",Chicago

The other is John C. Riley (starring as Amos, Roxy's husband). The leads were fine, but the whole movie I wanted to see more of Amos, who was the only sympathetic and also one of the only interesting characters in the movie. John C. Riley is one of the best supporting character actors of our time, and I can't wait until he starts to get larger roles. And I absoloutly loved Queen Latifah, who filled the movie with more sass and spark than Renne Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere combined.This film was so processed and unfortunatly very BORING, not because it was long or because I dont like musicals, but because it was bland.

From the opening scene to the ending one, this was one heck of a lot of fun. Catherine Zeta-Jones WAS Velma. One reviewer said she was born to play this role. The reviewer was right. Who knew she could sing like that and move like that? She lit up the screen. I don't know anything about rap music, so all I knew of Queen Latifah was her name. She was the PERFECT Mama. John C. Reilly just broke my heart with his performance and his show stopper - Mr. Cellophane. He was outstanding. And who knew Richard Gere had that kind of performance in him? Sure he can play suave and cool and you can picture him slithering in under the door. But singing and tap dancing too? He looked like he was having fun, and I had fun watching him. I was prepared for Renee Zellweger to be good. After all, she pulled off Bridget Jones, right? There aren't enough superlatives to describe her performance as Roxie Hart. She not only twisted her husband around her little finger; she did a darn good job of doing the same thing to me.The story line of Chicago may be cynical, and the characters may all represent the shadier side of life. But those kinds of characters do exist. And in this day and age when the media makes a circus out of everything from a child falling down a well to war in a foreign country, it's no stretch to accept that atmosphere in a scenario where a woman kills her lover. There's a case on the front page of newspapers right now that parallels Chicago's story. Still, in spite of all the Razzle Dazzle and the fun, there was still the poignancy of women whose futures were all determined by one mad moment of passion.So, in case I haven't been clear, the cast of this movie was outstanding. So was the music. So were the costumes. I'm still humming ""He Had It Coming"". This movie did exactly what it promised to do. It entertained me, and when it was over, I wanted to sit right back down and watch it again. The only thing wrong with the 13 Oscar Nominations it got is that not all the nominees can win because some are competing against each other.

605536,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JLSE,Galina,"[4, 4]","I love ""Chicago"". How do I know that? I've seen it twice in the theater, the friend of mine downloaded it for me from the Internet, and gave me CDs for my b-day, and I bought a DVD when it finally became available.Well, it may not be nearly as perfect as the Broadway revival - the plot, the cinematography, and the chronologically incorrect details - but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.First of all, Chicago did not take itself too seriously - there are a lot of details that were reused from Bob Fosse's himself (the All That Jazz number was done like an opening scene in Cabaret, Velma's playing with the chair in I Can't Co It Alone - also). Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's ""Makin' Whoopee"" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing; it was a very good acting. And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms - and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: ""Objection!"" - ADA Harrison:""But Your Honor, I have not even asked any question""!).Second, ""Chicago"" surprised me. I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it. With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of ""All That Jazz"" , Katherine Zeta-Jones just blew me away - the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it. She was born to play Velma. When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing - I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them - which is important, right? The following scenes were as delightful as the opening - Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to? My personal favorite was: ""He was crazy, and he kept on screaming, ""You've been screwing the milkman."" And then he ran into my knife... he ran into my knife ten times.""The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number - it actually showed in those three-four minutes the sadness and loneliness of a small man, maybe not very bright but decent and devoted one. The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in ""Chicago"" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.4.5/5",4,"It's a showtime, folks - or why I love ""Chicago"" (2002) by Rob Marshall?",1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,3232,"['love', 'Chicago', 'How', 'do', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'theater', 'friend', 'mine', 'downloaded', 'Internet', 'gave', 'CDs', 'b-day', 'bought', 'DVD', 'when', 'finally', 'became', 'available.Well', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'perfect', 'Broadway', 'revival', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'chronologically', 'incorrect', 'details', 'good', 'sparkling', 'entertainment', 'believe', 'wherever', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'would', 'be', 'pleased', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'one', 'beloved', 'musicals.First', 'Chicago', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'lot', 'details', 'were', 'reused', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'All', 'That', 'Jazz', 'number', 'was', 'done', 'opening', 'scene', 'Cabaret', 'Velma', 'playing', 'chair', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Co', 'Alone', 'also', 'Roxie', 'Funny', 'Honey', 'laying', 'seductively', 'great', 'piano', 'pink', 'dress', 'reverence', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Makin', 'Whoopee', 'number', 'Fabulous', 'Baker', 'Boys', 'Roxie', 'was', 'doing', 'performed', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'singing', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'Billy', 'Flint', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'silver', 'tongue', 'prince', 'court', 'rooms', 'scenes', 'clever', 'funny', 'satire', 'TV', 'big', 'screen', 'court', 'room', 'dramas', 'comedies', 'Billy', 'Objection', 'ADA', 'Harrison', 'Your', 'Honor', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'asked', 'question', '.Second', 'Chicago', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'parts', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'know', 'good', 'acting', 'when', 'see', 'first', 'appearance', 'opening', 'interpretation', 'All', 'Jazz', 'Katherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'woman', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'doing', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Velma', 'When', 'actors', 'have', 'fun', 'enjoying', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'important', 'right', 'following', 'scenes', 'were', 'as', 'delightful', 'opening', 'Queen', 'Latiffa', 'Mama', 'Morton', 'fantastic', 'Cell', 'Block', 'Tango', 'people', 'look', 'eye', 'tell', 'Cell', 'Block', 'Tango', 'was', 'not', 'fun', 'watch', 'listen', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'was', 'crazy', 'kept', 'screaming', ""'ve"", 'been', 'screwing', 'milkman', 'then', 'ran', 'knife', 'ran', 'knife', 'ten', 'times', 'film', 'even', 'touched', 'when', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'was', 'doing', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'number', 'actually', 'showed', 'three-four', 'minutes', 'sadness', 'loneliness', 'small', 'man', 'maybe', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'decent', 'devoted', 'one', 'fact', 'loved', 'conniving', 'little', 'bitch', 'just', 'made', 'more', 'interesting.There', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'either', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'almost', 'impossible', 'Chicago', 'made', 'people', 'look', 'when', 'Zeta-Jones', 'were', 'screen', 'together', 'acted', 'great', 'character', 'was', 'changing', 'constantly', 'sweet', 'little', 'housewife', 'dreaming', 'fame', 'frustrated', 'humiliated', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'lover', 'common', 'heartless', 'criminal', 'who', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'receive', 'money', 'power', 'fame', 'was', 'crafted', 'very', 'well', 'absolutely', 'believable.With', 'said', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Chicago', 'was', 'Best', 'picture', '2002', 'know', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'will', 'see', 'again.4.5/5']",Chicago
605537,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JLSE,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 11]","Reknowned for his complex choreography and innovative staging, director-choreographer Bob Fosse was well known for his ability to impose tremendous style on even the slightest of material--and that is precisely what he did when John Kander and Fred Ebb presented him with their follow up to Broadway smash CABARET.  After considerable script work, the story of two 1920s jailhouse divas emerged on the stage as CHICAGO, a remarkably dark and visually witty commentary on lust, corruption, and fame at any price.  And although Fosse, who has been dead a decade or more, had nothing to do with the screen version with CHICAGO, this big screen show is so completely in his style that it is difficult to believe director Rob Marshall wasn't doing a bit of spiritual channeling when he put it together.This one of those rare screen versions that doesn't pull the teeth of the original material: on screen, CHICAGO is every bit as dark and bitter as it was on stage, and if you're expecting a boy-meets-girl, bursts-into-song musical you're in for a rude awakening.  Singer-dancer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zita-Jones) has become the queen of Chicago's tabolids by offing her faithless husband and perfidious sister; sitting on death row, she's busy enjoying the press and planning to parlay the attention into a big time vaudeville act--but she's suddenly rolled for the throne by show-biz wannabe Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger), who captures press attention when she bumps off her lover and is then caught trying to coax her husband into taking the wrap.  And with fame, fortune, and beating the wrap high priorities, the two slither, snarl, and play games of one-upmanship right into the courtroom under the sponsorship of their equally corrupt lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere.)  It's an arena in which truth counts for nothing and the innocent hang; only hardness, a total lack of integrity, and an implausible lie will get you by.The cast is simply amazing.  Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere come from stage backgrounds, but neither have shown their song-and-dance skills on the big screen until now--and they give every indication of having the time of their lives, tossing off everything from meticulous time steps to classic Fosse-esque squirming choreography, and singing the complicated songs extremely well indeed.  And they are very nearly upstaged by Queen Latifa as the wanton prison matron and John C. Reilly as Roxie's dim husband.  And then there is Rene Zellweger as Roxie Hart.  Frankly, the late great Gwen Verdon, who originated the role on Broadway, is a tough act to follow--but Zellweger sidesteps the trap of merely repeating Verdon's memorable interpretation and creates her own take on the half-niave, half-rapacious jazz baby from hell.  And when all is said and done, she makes Roxie Hart her own.Although some songs from the stage version have been dropped, the best survive, and the company tears strips off them, all the way from the opening ""All That Jazz"" to the finishing ""Nowadays.""  And everywhere the Fosse touch is very much in evidence: surrealistic concepts of space and time, slinky and half-naked dancers, wicked wit, and a sexy sneer are the order of the day.  The cinematography is also quite fine, using elements of rapid-fire editing seen in MOULIN ROUGE but without the same ""beat you to death"" quality that film had.  The result is dark, glittering, and remarkably sly in its mix of too-accurate social commentary and classic music elements.  And this is one of the few recent musicals that I think will stand the test of time.

Populated with characters no one could like, the musical's stage success was based almost entirely on the songs and Fosse's ingenious choreography. Having seen both the original and its revival on the New York stage, I must say that the film is a huge disappointment (and that doesn't count the so-so video quality or the strained treble on audio).  Some of the original music was deleted (why?).  Worst of all, every one of Fosse's brilliant dance designs has been ruined with frenetic MTV-style cross-cutting, annihilating every movement rhythm and Fosse's seductive mix of garishness and pointed subtlety. This is strictly a musical for those who haven't seen great musicals, particularly those who haven't seen how accomplished movie-musical directors photograph great dance numbers (Check 'Kiss Me Kate' or the unedited 'Begin the Beguine' production number near the end of 'Broadway Melody of 1940' to see how it's done).

Indeed, the last such musical to win Best Picture at the Oscars was the classic OLIVER! in 1968.  While films like EVITA and GREASE made noble efforts in the following years, the Broadway musical genre seemed destined to be a faded memory.  Then came the success of 2001's MOULIN ROUGE which, although not based on a Broadway show, showed that inventive and well-done musicals can draw an appreciative audience.  In 2002, CHICAGO built on that momentum and brought the genre back into blazing life, while winning 6 Oscars in the process....including Best Picture. This clever, cynical satire tells the 1920's story of Roxie Hart, a young married woman who shoots her lover dead when he fails to promote her entertainment career.  In the Cook County Jail, she meets with other female killers including jazzy dance star, Velma Kelly.  Hart and Kelly soon find themselves competing for publicity, status, and even their hot-shot lawyer, Billy Flynn.As the somewhat innocent, yet ruthless Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger does a wonderful job in balancing her two conflicting sides, while creating a character that grabs our interest.  Richard Gere is also top-notch as the slick lawyer Billy Flynn. It's a fun character-type role that easily grabs our attention.  John C. Reilly is winning as the meekish, put-upon husband to Roxie. Queen Latifah wonderfully underplays her role as the prison matron. And there's the definitive performance of Catherine Zeta-Jones as the sexy and sly Velma Kelly.  With her high energy, strong voice and wonderful dancing, Zeta-Jones creates a film performance that is as definitive in its own way as Ron Moody's Fagin in OLIVER! or Julie Andrew's Maria in SOUND OF MUSIC. She richly deserved the Oscar she won for Best Supporting Actress.  Rob Marshall directs this flick with a sure hand, and with a fast pace and style that makes the film seem much shorter than it actually is.The DVD is pretty basic for the most part with a ""Making of"" featurette, a director/screenwriter commentary, as well as the deleted number, ""Class,"" which featured Zeta-Jones and Latifah.In the end, CHICAGO is that rare bird: a film musical that remains true to the original, while maintaining its own integrity.

For parents: There is plenty of suggestive dancing as befits the time and the place,.... People get shot a few times, but they make it as nice as possible...nothing close to the goriness of ""Road to Perdition"". There's also a little bit of street language, but nothing a pre-teenager hasn't already heard. It has much in common with the wonderful ""Moulin Rouge"" in that there's a strong visual attack (I think ""razzle-dazzle"" is an accurate description!) and in that there's considerable artistic license with the time period (what comes to my mind: could black performers be onstage with white performers, let alone touch them the way they do here?!). So, once again historians may nitpick. Ignore them.I hate that, at 42, I'm too young to have seen the original Chicago that Bob Fosse produced, nor have I seen the theatre production. However, this may be an advantage. I don't have that ""this was/was not as good as"" monkey on my back, and can enjoy the movie on its face value alone.I'm also glad that I'm not familiar with either one of the lead actors (except Latifah) to be able to pre-judge them as actors and singers. Suffice it to say that I thought the dance numbers were fantastic, and regardless, anybody who can dance as well as Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Zeta-Jones in heels that high has my respect. Look out for one number very reminiscent of Elvis' Jailhouse Rock. The supporting cast is equally top-notch...you'll catch a glimpse or two of Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs, Mya, and Chita Rivera, who just received a Kennedy Center Honor.The story was great. I had a character I could care about, and surprisingly, it wasn't any of the leads. I'll bet, after seeing it yourself, you can guess which one earned my sympathy. Roxie, around whom it should be no surprise the story revolves, is a character I started out feeling a little sorry for, but she became [weaker] as the story progressed. The ending surprised me a tad, but I won't spoil that for those who haven't seen it. Aren't I nice?I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Technically it has earned its award in my book, and also has earned a five star rating.  But if the stars were used in my case to reflect how much I liked it, it would be a two.  I checked it out from the library, watched the first 45 minutes, and then fast forwarded to the final half hour, seeing the trial and ending to know how things came out.One person rightly said there are hardly any redeemable characters in it.  The protagonist is an adulterous murderer who thinks only of herself.  It questions if there is any real judgment.I would compare this to ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Both show the depths of depravity.  The difference?  The Kuberick classic reflects the emptiness of the depravity, while ""Chicago"" has fun with it.I thought the blur between reality and fantasy was very effective, which added both to its uniqueness and its disturbing quality.  I loved the acting as well.  There were also some good points, such as the lawyer telling Rene's character that she should be happy with her freedom.  Too many people are not happy with what we should be happy with.One thing I missed was the conviction of the foreign girl.  I found that hanging scene very depressing, and I did miss why she was convicted.Another reviewer said ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"" stick with you, and he was right.This was a well done movie, but it is one I would have been fine not seeing.

605559,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,B00005JLSE,IRA Ross,"[2, 2]","Roxie Hart, as played by Renee Zellweger, craves to become a famous musical comedy star.  Roxie's boy friend promises to introduce her to his buddy who supposedly has connections in show biz.  The only thing Roxy's friend desires is to jump into the sack with her--nothing else.  When Roxy is faced with his lies, she takes her revenge.Thus begins the story of ""Chicago,"" the razzle-dazzle musical about people who will seek fame at any price, whether via show business or indictment and trial for murder.  Either one of these is sure to grab headlines.  Richard Gere's character, the more than slightly sleezy lawyer, Billy Flynn, is more than happy to represent Roxy Hart, for a price.  Flynn also represents the singer/dancer and fellow felon, Velma Kelly, portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is in competition with Roxy Hart for renown.The premise of ""Chicago,"" and a very cynical one, is how the press, hungry to sell newspapers, often thrust those least deserving into stardom.  Fame is fleeting; once the public gets bored with the latest flavor of the month, the media move on to the next flavor.  Note the case of O.J. Simpson, and his would  replacement, Robert Blake.  Of course, in between, Osama Bin Laden was abruptly forgotten in ""favor"" of Sadaam Hussein.""Chicago"" is a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, in real life is an honest to goodness singer and dancer, is simply wonderful as Velma Kelly.  Zeta-Jones' rendition of ""All That Jazz"" is a show stopper.  Renee Zellweger lends a little girlish quality (ala Marilyn Monroe) to her scandalously trampish portrayal.  Richard Gere's performance as the lawyer has just the right touch of slickness required by the role.  It is quite gratifying that although neither Zellweger or Gere are profesional dancers, they both turn in applaud-worthy and polished performances.  John C. Reilly, as Roxy's hapless and cuckolded husband, does a heartbreaking turn in his number, ""Mr. Celophane,""  the man everyone sees through because no one knows he is there.  Queen Latifah steals the show as the ""lets make a deal"" prison matron.  She is sexy and deliciously sardonic when she takes center stage in ""When You're Good To Mama.""My only criticism of ""Chicago"" is that while the musical numbers are often terrific, the movie too often feels a little bit overloaded with them.  I also often asked myself, ""Is the public really so naive that they would fall for such obvious phonies"" as dramatized in the film?

On one hand, I would have expected to see a movie, being worth indeed 6 Oscars. From my point of view this is not a movie for Oscar awards. On the other hand, I have to admit that it is well done, made by intelligent and creative people.But I can't help it and mention that some details of the movie show a slip of the makers' attention: one of the characters speaks Russian and has a Russian name, but they say she is Hungarian and a cabaret dancer had her silk stockings broken during a preformance.Roxie Hart, an apparently innocent actress, dreams of changing her monotonous life thanks to her talent. She is attracted by the idea of becoming as famous as Velma Kelly, a well known vaudeville actress. She sees her dream come true when, due to some unusual circumstances, she finds herself in jail, next to her idol, both of them beining accused of murder.This is a nice satire at the address of Chicago and its legal system, at a time when jazz was gaining fans and alcohol was prohibited.I also admire the creativity and the rich imagination the movie makers proved when they associated the jail atmosphere with a stage where prisoners performed their own acts.I am not at all a fan of musicals, but I did not get bored watching this movie and I don't regret seeing it. But I would not see it a second time.I recommend this movie only to musical fans or to those who are great admirers of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zeleweeger or Richard Gere.

The choreography is extremely brilliant. The film uses all possibilities it can find and require to transform the screen into a total ballet, with several layers of dancing, especially a background that has its own autonomy and yet takes part in the whole thanks to editing special effects. The film constantly shifts from the real story into the musical construction and imaginary artistic dream. But what can the meaning of this film be ? Just a few questions. Why is the first ever hanged woman in Illinois a Hungarian who does not speak English ? What can we do with the vision of the defense lawyer as a director and choreographer of a superproduction for the best musical theaters ? What can we do with the acquittal of two criminals on the basis of lies and manipulations ? How can justice be that manipulatable ? Isn't it the very negation of justice itself ? And yet the film is highly entertaining and pleasant and tries to show in all possible ways that women are the victims of men and have to organize themselves to resist this male-dominated society, though the lawyer who saves them, if he wants, if he is paid enough, is a man, the very negation of the previous idea. So contradictions and contradictions, and contradictions.

Unless you're like me--someone who thought a movie with songs every five seconds isn't a...movie (like SHOWBOAT). But when I saw this, CHICAGO, I saw the error in my ways.Anyone who thinks the acting is bad is a terrible judge. Renee Zellweger draws just the right feelings from the audience: she can make you hate, adore, and want to kill the character Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones is at the top of her game as the notorious Velma Kelly (&quot;it was a murder, but not a crime&quot;). I'd like to thank the Academy for giving her the Oscar. And let me tell you: Meryl Streep is my favorite, favorite actress of ALL time (and this is coming from a true movie buff), but I am still so glad that Zeta-Jones got the Oscar. Sorry for your loss, Meryl.Don't get me started about how much I loved Richard Gere. Playing the suave, charming, yet self-helping lawyer Billy Flynn, I grin every time I see him come onto the screen. His song, &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; is my dad's favorite, and a real toe-tapper. The songs are incredible, my favorites being the Cell Block Tango, Both Reached For The Gun, and the ever-lasting All That Jazz.

605574,A7JKVC5R3IGFD,B00005JLSE,J Bowles,"[3, 4]","Several of the user-contributed reviews for ""Chicago"" make it sound like the film (and the original play and earlier works they're based on) is a treatise on the virtues of sex and liquor.In fact, in one way, it is. It's a commentary on how we, society, respond to celebrity and media manipulation.The first time we see the lawyer, we hear him sing about how money means nothing to him (while he's being measured for custom suits, riding in expensive cars, and having beautiful women draped over him as part of the choreography for the song). Clearly, the visuals tell us, he's a manipulator.Both female leads, excellently cast (although I would entertain arguments for others in the roles, these are fine examples of the craft), are similar manipulators. The brunette murders her lover and sister (who is also her partner in her stage act) and then boasts, later, that they ""had it comin'."" The blond murders her lover and then, having convinced her husband to take the fall for her, sings a ballad about how faithful he is and how much she loves him - until he realizes (about verse three of the song) that she's been two-timing him and rats her out. (I took my 63-year-old mother to see this, and she started laughing at that moment.) Mid-ballad, she changes her tune (literally) and starts singing about how disloyal he is.""Chicago"" is not endorsing these creeps. It's telling us that we have a voyeuristic need to follow their stories, to be entertained by the media instead of being informed by it. Certainly, you cannot see ""Chicago"" without acknowledging some of the grime in our world, and in ourselves.It's called ""art"".The visual style of ""Chicago"" deliberately pulls you in, as ""Cabaret"" did, by putting [nearly] all the numbers into a night-club setting so that people don't just spontaneously break into song. (That's one the big complaints about old-time musicals that I hear, and Chicago/Cabaret can't be accused of having nuns on hill-tops breaking into song.)It is a great film, even if it's a bit uncomfortable in places.

Everyone that participated in this film should be labeled as extremely talented.  Studios should keep bringing on the musicals because for some of us, we can't make it to most broadway shows and this will give people a chance to do so.

605584,A15NS9ERV7LT7A,B00005JLSE,Joel L. Gandelman,"[1, 2]","Chicago: loud, brassy, poignant, fast-paced, innovative -- and I want to see it again and again. I reluctantly saw Chicago.Yes, I heard the great 'buzz' and love musicals but many movie musicals are'stagey,' talkie and cursed with big name miscasts (just think: Hello Dolly). They struggle to transform stage musicals to the screen in different (often flawed) ways...and wind up bloated and boring. I knew Bob Fosse's original play was a monster hit on Broadway nearly 30 years ago, but assumed the musical score would not be as great as Kander & Ebb's greatest hit score, Cabaret -- mainly, because I had never heard it.I was wrong, wrong WRONG.Chicago is anything but NOT boring or dumb. Generation X will enjoy it as much as old fogies (like me). It roars through its roughly two hours running time like the Chicago L, from opening seconds to climatic show stopper. This adult musical about how two women get literally get away with murder while tirelessly pursuing fame translates a 20th century musical package into a highly entertaining, compelling and solid form, as a realistic 21st century movie. It boasts wonderful, tuneful period-influenced musical numbers. Above all, Chicago is NOT a film that screeches 'THIS A STAGE MUSICAL FILMED ON A SOUND STAGE' .Rather than have main characters breaking into song (which I LIKE in most cases by the way), songs here are either musical numbers done on a stage in a theater or fantasies of musical numbers. The result: this movie that could stand alone as an admittedly short dramatic piece if all the musical numbers were cut out. Cabaret did this quite successfully too but then the concept disappeared.Although I fully understand the reaction of purists who want to see a filmed version of stage play, Chicago succeeds on so many levels I find very little to criticize here. A partiallist of superlatives would include such things as:--EDITING: There are countless cuts to reality and fantasy, quickly changing from fantasy sight and sound to reality sight and sound, cuts from scene to scene, from angle to angle Just imagine NYPD Blue's film editors on too much caffeine. The result: a more gripping film.--MUSIC ORCHESTRATIONS: Most are done by the 'theater's' jazz orchestra, giving it a period sound, a musical flamboyance that honors (and I think helps popularize) that era's zippy musical style.--CASTING: Hey, not one role miscast. A FIRST for a movie musical!!!--QUALITY OF ACTING; All acting superb. Standout performance: Queen Latifah, in her role as the prison matron, Mama. Her natural, multi-layered acting and her charismatic song performance are highly satisfying. Second standout performance (and most recognized) John C. Reilly, as the throw-away husband. Richard Geer is topnotch in vaudeville fantasy songs and acting segments, as the sleazy lawyer. Catherine Zeta-Jones oozes sexuality and pizzazz as Renee, nearly walking away with the flick. She's supremely paired with Renee Zellweger, who displays incredibly versatile acting depth.The city of Chicago is known as the Second City but the movie Chicago will increasingly be considered among the top musicals ever filmed.

605585,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLSE,Joe Sherry,"[0, 4]","A film by Rob MarshallConsidering that I saw this movie months after it had won the Oscar for Best Picture, I went into it with somewhat high expectations.  On that level, it was something of a disappointment.  It was a good movie, but not necessarily a great movie, and certainly not the best picture of all of 2002.  Granted, choosing the best picture is an entirely subjective task, but the movie wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.The plotline of the movie has Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) send to jail for murdering her boyfriend in cold blood, all the while trying to pin the murder on her husband Amos (John C Reilly).  Roxie wants to be a star; she wants to be on stage.  The man she was seeing told her that he had a connection and could get her an audition.  He was only trying to get Roxie in bed.  Roxie ends up in jail and she sees Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) is also in prison (for murdering her sister).  Velma was a huge star of the stage, and Roxie wanted to be just like her.  Fast talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) takes Roxie's case (along with that of Velma).  Velma and Roxie are also being assisted by the prison warden, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah).  Mama Morton can help out Roxie and Velma get in contact with Billy or make a phone call, but for a price.The rest of the movie focuses on Roxie as Billy builds up her celebrity so that she can potentially be acquitted of the charges.  There are really two movies here.  First, is the real story of Roxie and how she gets to court.  The other movie here is the musical.  Unlike other musicals where the characters are just walking along and burst into song (and then carry on like nothing happened), the musical numbers in Chicago are fantasy sequences.  They are the imaginings of Roxie Hart (mostly) and give a better picture of her feelings than Zellweger's acting does.  Some of the musical numbers are just so so, but some are actually memorable (two that Richard Gere does, oddly enough).  There is a routine where Roxie feels that she is just Billy's puppet, and this was fantastic and the best one of the show.  Billy is in court and basically tap dances around a tricky situation, and we see Billy actually tap dancing.  John C Reilly gets one number, and that man can sing!  The real star of the show was not Renee Zellweger, but instead was Catherine Zeta Jones.  Sure, Zellweger was the lead, but Zeta Jones was the reason the movie was a success.  Nobody else commanded your attention like Velma.  Anytime she sang or danced, I couldn't look away.  Without question, she deserved her Oscar.The movie talks about how celebrity is power.  If a celebrity can build up her image, she can literally get away with murder.  All they need is the right angle to play and maybe a fast talking lawyer.  Think about the parallels today: the biggest is obviously the O.J. Simpson case with Johnny Cochran as the lawyer.  But, any big case becomes bigger and more spectacular when the personal on trial has (or gets) a measure of celebrity.  Roxie Hart may be the lead character, but there are no heroes.  The only truly likable and sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, and he is a pushover.  We aren't supposed to relate with Roxie or Velma, but rather to look at how celebrity can corrupt the judicial system.I know that Chicago won Best Picture.  I know that it was well regarded, and I'm not saying that it isn't a good movie.  It just wasn't a great movie.  To put it simply: Chicago did not live up to the hype.  All the ingredients were there, but it was a little underwhelming.  The only thing I can attribute this to is that Renee Zellweger, while she did a good job, could not command the screen.  She is fine in her role, but she is lacking in the power necessary to command attention.  Catherine Zeta Jones is an example of an actress commanding the screen.  If she was the lead, we might have had a different movie, but Roxie would have been a much stronger character (and thus the movie would have been stronger).  It's a good movie, not a great one, and there were better movies in 2002.",4,Not deserving of Best Picture,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,4099,"['film', 'Rob', 'MarshallConsidering', 'saw', 'movie', 'months', 'had', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'went', 'somewhat', 'high', 'expectations', 'level', 'was', 'something', 'disappointment', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'great', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'picture', '2002', 'Granted', 'choosing', 'best', 'picture', 'entirely', 'subjective', 'task', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'cracked', 'up', 'be.The', 'plotline', 'movie', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'send', 'jail', 'murdering', 'boyfriend', 'cold', 'blood', 'while', 'trying', 'pin', 'murder', 'husband', 'Amos', 'John', 'C', 'Reilly', 'Roxie', 'be', 'star', 'be', 'stage', 'man', 'was', 'seeing', 'told', 'had', 'connection', 'could', 'get', 'audition', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'get', 'Roxie', 'bed', 'Roxie', 'up', 'jail', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'also', 'prison', 'murdering', 'sister', 'Velma', 'was', 'huge', 'star', 'stage', 'Roxie', 'wanted', 'be', 'just', 'Fast', 'talking', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Roxie', 'case', 'Velma', 'Velma', 'Roxie', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'assisted', 'prison', 'warden', 'Mama', 'Morton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Mama', 'Morton', 'can', 'help', 'out', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'get', 'contact', 'Billy', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'price.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Roxie', 'Billy', 'up', 'celebrity', 'can', 'potentially', 'be', 'acquitted', 'charges', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'movies', 'here', 'First', 'real', 'story', 'Roxie', 'how', 'court', 'other', 'movie', 'here', 'musical', 'other', 'musicals', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'walking', 'along', 'burst', 'song', 'then', 'carry', 'nothing', 'happened', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Chicago', 'are', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'are', 'imaginings', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'mostly', 'give', 'better', 'picture', 'feelings', 'Zellweger', 'acting', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'so', 'are', 'actually', 'memorable', 'two', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'oddly', 'enough', 'routine', 'where', 'Roxie', 'just', 'Billy', 'puppet', 'was', 'fantastic', 'best', 'one', 'show', 'Billy', 'court', 'basically', 'tap', 'dances', 'tricky', 'situation', 'see', 'Billy', 'actually', 'tap', 'dancing', 'John', 'C', 'Reilly', 'one', 'number', 'man', 'can', 'sing', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'instead', 'was', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Sure', 'Zellweger', 'was', 'lead', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'success', 'Nobody', 'else', 'commanded', 'attention', 'Velma', 'Anytime', 'sang', 'danced', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'question', 'deserved', 'Oscar.The', 'movie', 'talks', 'how', 'celebrity', 'power', 'celebrity', 'can', 'build', 'up', 'image', 'can', 'literally', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'need', 'right', 'angle', 'play', 'maybe', 'fast', 'talking', 'lawyer', 'Think', 'parallels', 'today', 'biggest', 'obviously', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'case', 'Johnny', 'Cochran', 'lawyer', 'big', 'case', 'bigger', 'more', 'spectacular', 'when', 'personal', 'trial', 'measure', 'celebrity', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'may', 'be', 'lead', 'character', 'are', 'heroes', 'only', 'truly', 'likable', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Roxie', 'husband', 'pushover', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'relate', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'rather', 'look', 'how', 'celebrity', 'can', 'corrupt', 'judicial', 'system.I', 'know', 'Chicago', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'know', 'was', 'well', 'regarded', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'put', 'simply', 'Chicago', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'ingredients', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'little', 'underwhelming', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'attribute', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'could', 'not', 'command', 'screen', 'fine', 'role', 'lacking', 'power', 'necessary', 'command', 'attention', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'example', 'actress', 'commanding', 'screen', 'was', 'lead', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'different', 'movie', 'Roxie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger', 'character', 'thus', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'were', 'better', 'movies', '2002']",Chicago

605587,AIWRBCDSPCDRE,B00005JLSE,"John Adams ""Farley Flavors""","[2, 4]","Coming from a man who has seen the recent revival of ""Chicago"" twice. I can without a shred of hesitation say that the new film version is not only one of the best movies of the year, but it's also one of the best movie musicals of all time!!! Rob Marshall skillfully handles the material with gusto and flare, and Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) adapts the play in an almost effortless fashion. Together they were able to retain the satirical value of the Kander/Ebb/Fosse musical, and as a matter of fact utilize it to their advantage.After seeing the play, I was wondering in my head how could they adapt many of these numbers to the screen. (ie the 'Cell Block Tango,' 'Razzle Dazzle' and 'Funny Honey') Mainly because the numbers in many ways are like monologues in song, that and the fact that this is not a musical that was ever made to be ""by-the-book"" because lord knows these are characters aren't exactly ""by-the-book."" So in the midst of this revelation you couldn't make this into a standard ""break into song in the middle of the dialogue"" movie musical. It needed to be something that fits with the context of the story. But hallelujah! They figured it out! how they did it? I don't feel inclined to tell you, it would spoil the surprise. As for the numbers themselves? All of them are brilliantly staged, and though they'll be compared to Fosse's style you won't stone the filmmaker's to death if it doesn't match. Because Marshall is able to breathe a different kind of life into the dance in the same fashion that he did for Sam Mendes' revival of ""Cabaret"" (Ironically another Kander & Ebb musical that Fosse choreographed and directed). Each number is also filmed and edited with striking precision and never misses a beat.But now for the most pivotal component...The actors! The casting for this movie has been kicked around continuously (Names such as Madonna, Goldie Hawn, Charlize Theron, Hugh Jackman...The list goes on)until finally settling with Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Renee Zellweger playing the two merry murderesses Velma and Roxie. Many people looked surprised to hear they these two were to be starring in a musical, but frankly I wasn't. I knew Zellweger could sing since ""Empire Records"" and I was also aware that Zeta-Jones was a chorus girl in London before she took up acting. So I knew they could handle it. As Roxie, Zellweger has that look of apparent innocence which is perfectly in character considering she uses it to her advantage to cover up her true intentions. Catherine Zeta-Jones? all I can say about her is that she is sin on legs! I definitely wouldn't want her to catch me with her sister doing ""Number 17: The Spread Eagle,"" And as a plus when she has the screen she holds it especially with her opening number ""All That Jazz"" which she sings with a power that rivals that of Chita Rivera, and Bebe Neuwirth. For me the shaky casting choice was of The Male lead Billy Flynn. I had no idea if Richard Gere was capable of handling the part. Sure he could definitely play a lecherous lawyer (See ""Primal Fear"") but could he sing? ultimately the answer proves to be a big YES! He fills the screen with, dare-I-say Razzle Dazzle and his singing matches that of the 1920's vaudeville style. plus he can TAP!!!It's ironic, last year we were surprised when Nicole Kidman belted out a tune. Now Richard Gere is shooting to stand next to Fred Astaire. It makes you wonder who will surprise us next year? Now when I saw the play the part of Matron 'Mama' Morton was played by an Aretha Franklin-esque woman which to me was perfect cause that's the only way I could ever have pictured the character to be portrayed. So when I heard that they cast Queen Latifah to play ""The Mistress of Murderers Row,"" I didn't have to worry about it one bit. And surely enough my prediction has proven to be correct. Same also goes for John C. Reilly and his meekly sympathetic portrayal of cuckolded husband Amos Hart. His rendition of 'Mr. Cellophane' is definitely a milestone in this film and invokes pleasant memories of Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers. Oh, and on a sidenote Lucy Liu was delicious in her cameo as Go-To-Hell Kitty.All in all Chicago is a close to perfect stage-to-screen adaptation.

Of course, I did see it while Bebe Neworth was performing...The movie version, by nescessity, had to add on some dialogue, but not enough to ruin it. The musical numbers were fine. Most of the performances we middle-of-the-road, with Queen Latifa's standing out and Richard Gere's petering out (he was awfully wooden, especially during his numbers).I know why the Academy chose to nominate this film, as it had to put something up there in what was an otherwise dull movie year (and God knows they'll never let a science fiction film like 'The Two Towers' near a Best Picture Oscar, no matter how much better it is). Most of the nominees had limited runs, and most of the moviegoing audience are still going 'huh?' over 'The Hours' and 'The Pianist'.

I KNEW the choreography was by Bob Fosse, but thought he was retired or something, then saw someone else's name in the credits and figured I was wrong.  Then read some of these reviews and found that it at least derived from Fosse.  WHOEVER thought it up, it was stunning and exciting.  The lyrics were pedestrian with scads of false rhymes.  The music sounded like Cabaret rejects.  The only song (except those dreadful words) to write home about was the first one.  The rest were mediocre, but taken as a whole, concept, plot, songs, acting, dancing, AND DIRECTING it was wonderful.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  But sigh especially to anyone who liked the movie of Cabaret.  Kander and Ebb are at rock bottom of my list of songwriters, but I thought the score of the movie of Cabaret (not the Bway show) was brilliant, not a lemon in it.  Chicago and Cabaret are almost identical.  I searched through Netflix for another musical with Catherine Zetta-Jones (I loved her, especially with that haircut), but alas could find none.  She was glorious.  Richard Gere was great when he was acting serious, but (except for his ventriloquist number, which was wonderful) I didn't care for him in the fantasy episodes.  It's a sordid, morbid, CYNICAL story, but so was Cabaret (the rise of the nazis).  I'm seriously thinking about buying this movie, to have, to watch again (and maybe a few more agains after that).  Every person on the screen did a superlative job in his/her part.  One comment on another review.  I don't think Bway shows are all that wonderful on stage.  In fact, I don't think they're wonderful at all.  The music may be good (but usually it's not), the lyrics are invariably mediocre at best, most usually just bad, and the books are invariably long and boring as hell.  There are exceptions.  I saw a Noel Coward show (many times) I liked, and Rodgers' No Strings (1st show I ever saw onstage) enthralled me.  Of course, I was a child at the time, but I still love the songs.

Perez ""Jose""","[2, 3]","Although I thoroughly enjoyed CHICAGO the movie, I admit a strong preference for the Broadway version, which is far more intimate and raw than the cotton-candy color of Rob Marshall's debut film. Sure enough, the leads are superb - Renee Zellweger reafirms my belief that she is one of the great actresses of our time, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply BRILLIANT - surely an Oscar awaits her on March 23rd for her vivid portrayal of Velma Kelly. John C Reilly is a grand ""Mr. Celophane"" and THE Queen, Latifah, is a hoot at Mama, the prison warden. Richard Gere is just OK in a largely supporting role that never really gets under your skin - maybe that's why he was passed over by the Academy - his role has bite, but it's gums, not teeth that clamp down on you.The musical zips and hums itself along as a half fantasy, half reality saga...a tale of desperate women driven to desperate acts by the nasty men who use and abuse them. And therein lies the problem. What the movie Chicago doesn't deliver, and the stage version does in spades, is a sense of intimacy...a motive that's more fully realized on stage because the audience is both witness to a crime, and a jury of peers to the irrepressible Roxie Hart. Movies of hit musicals rarely achieve the spectacle one feels on stage, and Chicago is better than MOST movie musicals to be sure. Still, it doesn't MOVE the audience because its two dimensional vision never makes you feel like anything but a movie-viewer. That may be enough for some, but it left this moviegoer - with Broadway down the street - tapping his feet, but never fully engaged. Anyone without the benefit of huge stage musicals at your doorstep would be wise to take a trip to the Windy City... it's that good a movie. The score is wonderful, the songs will keep you humming for days, and again, the performers are terrific, through and through. Yet - this CHICAGO can't hold a candle to the original Fosse stage show, and the movie never fully takes flight.Finally, many folks are forcing comparisons between Chicago and last year's musical treasure, ""Moulin Rouge."" In my opinion, the Baz Lurhman spectacle was a superior film, for the exect same reasons Chicago is a better stage event. Moulin was filled with unexpected pleasures - you never knew what would happen next even though the melodies and lyrics were familiar to us baby boomers. Where Moulin soared, Chicago just sizzles.

605597,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JLSE,J R Zullo,"[0, 5]","THE STORY: Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wants to be a stage star, but she gets in the hands of a crook who promises to put her in a show, but he in fact only wants to go to bed with her. So she kills him and goes to jail; Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) already is a star, but she finds out her sister is having an affair with her husband. So she kills them and goes to jail; Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) is the publicity-addict shark-lawyer who only defends women and never lost a case, and he will defend them.THE ACTORS: Renne Zellweger doesn't know how to sing; that's obvious; Richard Gere doesn't know how to sing either and he is obviously embarassed in some of the dancing scenes. Yet, they both star the best scene in the movie, the one where Renee is a puppet and Gere is the puppet-master. Catherine Zeta-Jones knows how to sing AND how to dance, and insisted on cutting her hair short to make plain that it was she, in fact, doing all the scenes, not a dancing stunt (on the other hand, in the tap-dancing scene I was not sure it was really Richard Gere doing the movements, because there isn't a take where he appears full-body and with his face turned to the camera). Praise for John C. Reilly and, specially, Queen Latifah, good and imposing supporting actors (funny as well).THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAYS AND MOVIES: When you watch a play in a theater, you, uncousciously, KNOW that it's all a fantasy spectacle. It's a confined space. The actors are right there, in the stage, in front of you. The scenery changes. The actors move out of the stage and come back later. Even if it's the best play ever played, your mind is set to know it's all make-believe. That's why musicals are good when on stage. When you try to addapt a musical-play into a movie, all the magic is lost. There's no one in front of the viewers, there's only a still SCREEN. The space is bigger, there are no boundaries. The name of the movie is ""Chicago"", but it could as well be ""Kansas City"" or ""Cleveland"" or ""Fort Lauderdale"", because, apart from some thrown-in and sparse references to the name of the city, you often forget about it. As a comparison example, ""Moulin rouge"" was another movie-musical, but in it Baz Luhrman was able to create the whole ATMOSPHERE of a play, and in ""Chicago"" Rob Marshall couldn't; in the end ""Chicago"" was just, well, silly.The ""4 stars"" I give ""Chicago"" is because I could see that all actors and crew members wanted so much to make this movie an unforgettable one. They couldn't, but maybe it was not their fault. Maybe I was on a bad day.To sum it up, what I would like to say is that, when trying to make a musical, the director and script-writers have to be very careful. I would hate to see a wave of bad musicals making their way into the theaters just because it's an attempt to rediscover  lost ties with movie-history.Grade 8.0/10",4,There's a difference between plays and movies,1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,2867,"['STORY', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'be', 'stage', 'star', 'hands', 'crook', 'who', 'put', 'show', 'fact', 'only', 'go', 'bed', 'jail', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'already', 'star', 'out', 'sister', 'having', 'affair', 'husband', 'jail', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'publicity-addict', 'shark-lawyer', 'who', 'only', 'women', 'never', 'lost', 'case', 'will', 'defend', 'them.THE', 'ACTORS', 'Renne', 'Zellweger', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sing', 'obvious', 'Richard', 'Gere', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sing', 'either', 'obviously', 'embarassed', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'star', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'Renee', 'puppet', 'Gere', 'puppet-master', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'how', 'sing', 'AND', 'how', 'dance', 'insisted', 'cutting', 'hair', 'short', 'make', 'plain', 'was', 'fact', 'doing', 'scenes', 'not', 'dancing', 'stunt', 'other', 'hand', 'tap-dancing', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'really', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'doing', 'movements', ""n't"", 'take', 'where', 'full-body', 'face', 'turned', 'camera', 'Praise', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'specially', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'good', 'imposing', 'supporting', 'actors', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'DIFFERENCE', 'BETWEEN', 'PLAYS', 'AND', 'MOVIES', 'When', 'watch', 'play', 'theater', 'uncousciously', 'KNOW', 'fantasy', 'spectacle', 'confined', 'space', 'actors', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'stage', 'front', 'scenery', 'changes', 'actors', 'move', 'stage', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'Even', 'best', 'play', 'ever', 'played', 'mind', 'set', 'know', 'make-believe', 'why', 'musicals', 'are', 'good', 'when', 'stage', 'When', 'try', 'addapt', 'musical-play', 'movie', 'magic', 'lost', 'one', 'front', 'viewers', 'only', 'still', 'SCREEN', 'space', 'bigger', 'are', 'boundaries', 'name', 'movie', 'Chicago', 'could', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Cleveland', 'Fort', 'Lauderdale', 'apart', 'thrown-in', 'sparse', 'references', 'name', 'city', 'often', 'forget', 'comparison', 'example', 'Moulin', 'rouge', 'was', 'movie-musical', 'Baz', 'Luhrman', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'whole', 'ATMOSPHERE', 'play', 'Chicago', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'could', ""n't"", 'end', 'Chicago', 'was', 'just', 'well', 'silly.The', '4', 'stars', 'give', 'Chicago', 'could', 'see', 'actors', 'crew', 'members', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'was', 'not', 'fault', 'Maybe', 'was', 'bad', 'day.To', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'musical', 'director', 'script-writers', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'would', 'hate', 'see', 'wave', 'bad', 'musicals', 'making', 'way', 'theaters', 'just', 'attempt', 'rediscover', 'lost', 'ties', 'movie-history.Grade', '8.0/10']",Chicago

This wonderful production combines the talents of a myriad of fantastic performers.  Veteran actors sing and dance as if they've been doing it all their lives and slick and creative musical numbers follow one another at a dizzying pace.Renee Zellweger stars as a young girl desperate to be in show business.  She has an affair with a man who claims that he can help her career, but when he reveals that it's all a lie, she shoots him.  She ends up in jail with one of her idols, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, but Jones won't give her the time of day.  They are both accused of murder and they both use a slick-talking lawyer played to perfection by Richard Gere.  He manipulates the press by presenting Zellweger as a victim of the crime she committed and suddenly she has the fame she so greatly desires.  Now it's Zeta-Jones who comes to her and wants them to perform together, but Zellweger spurns her as earlier she has been rejected.  Each major character gets to shine in at least one solo number and both Queen Latifah and John C. Quinn deliver a show-stopping performance in &quot;Be Good to Momma&quot; and &quot;Cellophane Man&quot;, respectively.  This is a highly entertaining film, and it contains some themes which are brilliantly satirized.

In 2002, Mirimax released the wonderful motion picture adaptation. Catherine Zeta-Jones sings and dances Velma Kelly just as well as previous Velma, Chita Rivera and ever better than Bebe Newirth. Richard Gere, although nasil, does a wonderful job as Billy Flynn. Renne Zellwegger plays Roxie nicely, like a Kewpie doll, only problem: if she'd open those eyes!John C. Reily is great at Amos.

Velma was my favorite character in the movie.  I didn't really think Renee had too much in the way of dancing to do, so I had a much greater respect for all of the work Catherine had to do for the singing and dancing (and Cell Block Tango? Fantastic).  This movie definately deserved Best Picture as did Catherine deserve her best supporting actress Oscar.  My only complaint is not with the movie, but with the DVD.  You'd think there would be way more extras on a best picture winner.  There's next to nothing here.  Which really disapointed me.  I was shocked to find the only things of note to be a tiny featurette,commentary, and a deleted number.  Rob Marshall says in his commentary that there were a ton of deleted numbers from the original musical, so why none of those on the DVD? Or a longer feature?

Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) sees Velma's last performance at the Vaudeville Theater as she dreams of her own fame.  Roxie works hard to achieve her dream by cheating with a furniture salesman, but something goes wrong and she kills the salesman.  Through the hard way, Roxie learns that everything is run by Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah) and she meets Velma who is still seeking fame from within the prison through Mama.  When Roxie finds out that she might get hanged she seeks help and Mama informs Roxie that she should get William 'Billy' Flynn (Richard Gere) as her lawyer, since he has never lost a case.  Over a night, Mr. Flynn turns the nobody killer Roxie into a star by tweaking the truth to what the news media wants to hear.  In the process, Velma falls into the shadow and becomes desperate to get back into the light of fame.  Chicago is an interesting film, since it implies the audience as a driving factor in the search for fame within the main characters of the film.

I would have to say that I found the film visually wonderful. And I also really liked some of the performances, especially from Zeta-Jones. And I do have a respect for the choreograpy work that was put into this movie and the singing that was performed. But I felt that the film moved at an awkward pace. The movie kind of felt like a big flashy ride over an extremely bumpy road. It just seemed like the events of the story moved along rather fast and were blurred by the big musical/dance performances. And yes I do realize that this was based on a broadway musical and the story is really supposed to told through the musical performances, but I found it all to be distracting and misleading. And when the film ended, I had not a clue ten minutes before that the film was in its conclusion.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[12, 14]","I would definitely have to say that I approached watching a musical with a small amount of trepidation; but this trepidation was quickly washed away as I found that &quot;Chicago&quot; was nothing less than a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film to watch.  Although there have been many films that I've completely enjoyed watching, I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie that had me smiling the whole way through.  Despite the basic nature of this film being grounded in murder and those who committed it doing whatever they can to get out of it, the way in which the story was written within a musical just makes it so hilarious you'll find yourself just happily enjoying this film all the way to the credits at the end.It is absolutely no wonder to me at all that this film won six Academy awards, all of which were well deserved.  I believe it takes an unusual and refreshing film like this to win that many Academy awards.Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Lucy Liu all deserve extraordinary praise for their respective performances in this exceptional film.  I've read and heard that several people weren't too impressed with Richard Gere's singing and dancing which is an opinion I don't share.  Who knew that this big star could and or would do singing and dancing on film; I thought his performance was great.Director Rob Marshall deserves nothing but the highest praise and accolades for bringing this brilliant film to the theaters and DVD format.  Chicago is nothing less, in this reviewer's opinion, than the best musical ever made!To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge musical fan, but this film and the sound track for it is just so enjoyable you don't have to be a huge musical fan to enjoy the film and the performances by these great actors.The premise:The setting for this film is Chicago in the twenties which makes it the perfect setting for the entire film as it is learned in the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; special that it is somewhat ground in the true story of several women killing their husbands or boyfriends and the huge media blitz over their trials.  Taking that into consideration and the timing of the film, being in the twenties when women were struggling for more rights, you have all the ingredients for the plot of &quot;Chicago&quot; and then throw in the musical aspect and then throw in several exceptional actors and actresses and you have &quot;Chicago.&quot;Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart who is a nave young woman married to an older, blue collar working man who is gone all day.  Take that aspect and her &quot;intense&quot; desire to be on stage doing her jazz singing and dancing.  Being a bored housewife, she hooks up with a little side action in the form a furniture salesman who feeds her a huge line about getting her hooked up with somebody at the local jazz club.  After several weeks of believing his line about getting her on stage, he finally becomes tired of her nagging and tells her he's just a furniture salesman and doesn't know anybody at the club.  She becomes so distraught about being lied to that she whips out a thirty eight and puts him down right at the front door.Her poor sap husband, played so brilliantly by John C. Reilly initially tries to take the blame for her, right up to the point in which he finds out that the body laying at the front door was the guy who sold them their furniture and boom, he drops the story and off to jail goes Roxie.  It's in jail that she meets up with Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton (Queen Latifah) and Velma Kelly who is played so brilliantly by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems to have been born for singing and dancing.  Velma has been in jail for some time now after the films exceptional opening with her on stage singing and dancing &quot;All that Jazz.&quot;  It seems she found her sister in the bed with her husband and she whacked the both of them.  Richard Gere shows up not too long after that as Billy Flynn, the big shot lawyer in Chicago that has never lost a case.What follows from there is nothing less than the best musical to hit the silver screen in years that will have you smiling from ear to ear from the very opening of the film to the credits.  I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all, whether you're a fan of musicals or not, you will enjoy &quot;Chicago.&quot;  {ssintrepid}Special Features- Deleted Musical Number &quot;Class&quot; Performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones &amp; Queen Latifah- Behind The Scenes Special- Director &amp; Screenwriter Feature Commentary",5,Chicago - A thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film!,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,4583,"['would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'approached', 'watching', 'musical', 'small', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'trepidation', 'was', 'quickly', 'washed', 'away', 'found', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'film', 'watch', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'smiling', 'whole', 'way', 'basic', 'nature', 'film', 'being', 'grounded', 'murder', 'who', 'committed', 'doing', 'can', 'get', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'musical', 'just', 'so', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'find', 'just', 'happily', 'enjoying', 'film', 'way', 'credits', 'end.It', 'absolutely', 'wonder', 'film', 'won', 'six', 'Academy', 'awards', 'were', 'well', 'deserved', 'believe', 'unusual', 'refreshing', 'film', 'win', 'many', 'Academy', 'awards.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'deserve', 'extraordinary', 'praise', 'respective', 'performances', 'exceptional', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'heard', 'several', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'singing', 'dancing', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'Who', 'knew', 'big', 'star', 'could', 'would', 'do', 'singing', 'dancing', 'film', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'great.Director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'nothing', 'highest', 'praise', 'accolades', 'bringing', 'brilliant', 'film', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'format', 'Chicago', 'nothing', 'less', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'best', 'musical', 'ever', 'made', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'musical', 'fan', 'film', 'sound', 'track', 'just', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'huge', 'musical', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'film', 'performances', 'great', 'actors.The', 'premise', 'setting', 'film', 'Chicago', 'twenties', 'perfect', 'setting', 'entire', 'film', 'learned', 'quot', 'Scenes', 'quot', 'special', 'somewhat', 'ground', 'true', 'story', 'several', 'women', 'killing', 'husbands', 'boyfriends', 'huge', 'media', 'blitz', 'trials', 'Taking', 'consideration', 'timing', 'film', 'being', 'twenties', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'struggling', 'more', 'rights', 'have', 'ingredients', 'plot', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'then', 'throw', 'musical', 'aspect', 'then', 'throw', 'several', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'actresses', 'have', 'quot', 'Chicago.', 'quot', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'who', 'nave', 'young', 'woman', 'married', 'older', 'blue', 'collar', 'working', 'man', 'who', 'gone', 'day', 'Take', 'aspect', 'quot', 'intense', 'quot', 'desire', 'be', 'stage', 'doing', 'jazz', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Being', 'bored', 'housewife', 'up', 'little', 'side', 'action', 'form', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'who', 'huge', 'line', 'getting', 'hooked', 'up', 'somebody', 'local', 'jazz', 'club', 'several', 'weeks', 'believing', 'line', 'getting', 'stage', 'finally', 'tired', 'nagging', 'just', 'furniture', 'salesman', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'club', 'so', 'distraught', 'being', 'lied', 'out', 'thirty', 'eight', 'down', 'right', 'front', 'door.Her', 'poor', 'sap', 'husband', 'played', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'initially', 'take', 'blame', 'right', 'up', 'point', 'out', 'body', 'laying', 'front', 'door', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'sold', 'furniture', 'boom', 'story', 'jail', 'Roxie', 'jail', 'up', 'Matron', 'quot', 'Mama', 'quot', 'Morton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'who', 'played', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Velma', 'been', 'jail', 'time', 'now', 'films', 'exceptional', 'opening', 'stage', 'singing', 'dancing', 'quot', 'Jazz.', 'quot', 'found', 'sister', 'bed', 'husband', 'whacked', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'up', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'big', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'Chicago', 'never', 'lost', 'case.What', 'nothing', 'less', 'best', 'musical', 'hit', 'silver', 'screen', 'years', 'will', 'have', 'smiling', 'ear', 'ear', 'very', 'opening', 'film', 'credits', 'highly', 'recommend', 'exceptional', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'musicals', 'not', 'will', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Chicago.', 'quot', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features-', 'Deleted', 'Musical', 'Number', 'quot', 'Class', 'quot', 'Performed', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'amp', 'Queen', 'Latifah-', 'Scenes', 'Special-', 'Director', 'amp', 'Screenwriter', 'Feature', 'Commentary']",Chicago

605618,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLSE,Lawyeraau,"[13, 17]","This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.In the jail, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, ""When You're Good To Mama"" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing.I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining.

I live in Chicago and cannot be impartial. Tough act when you've seen this show on Broadway multiple times and understand ""Chicago"" transmits best when live on stage. I loved Marshall's idea to have the musical numbers play out in Roxie's head and this is one of the many reasons that it works. The sets and costumes are wonderful too. Now I feel that the negative reviews are plain unfair. Casting was right on. The stars, Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Gere are actors and not professional Broadway thespians. And many Broadway thespians will never be Hollywood A-list movie stars. With exception of Zeta-Jones whom is a talented dancer/singer, both Zellweger and Gere had a lot of courage to sign up for this film. Neither had attempted a musical before. All three actors really outdid themselves and the hard work paid off. Watch Gere's footwork in the tap dance scene and also his opening number ""All I Care About is Love."" Catherine's ""All That Jazz"" rivals Bebe Neuwirth. And Renee was the biggest surprise of all for me. I loved her renditions of ""Funny Honey"" and ""Nowadays.""Queen Latifah was hilarious as Mama Morton.Taking all these facts into consideration, ""Chicago"" is outstanding film and hopefully brought this wonderful musical to many new fans across the world.",5,Superb Chicago!,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1407,"['have', 'give', 'credit', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'crew', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'favorite', 'musical', 'big', 'screen', 'live', 'Chicago', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'impartial', 'Tough', 'act', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'Broadway', 'multiple', 'times', 'understand', 'Chicago', 'best', 'when', 'live', 'stage', 'loved', 'Marshall', 'idea', 'have', 'musical', 'numbers', 'play', 'out', 'Roxie', 'head', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'too', 'Now', 'feel', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'plain', 'unfair', 'Casting', 'was', 'right', 'stars', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Zellweger', 'Gere', 'are', 'actors', 'not', 'professional', 'Broadway', 'thespians', 'many', 'Broadway', 'thespians', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'movie', 'stars', 'exception', 'Zeta-Jones', 'whom', 'talented', 'dancer/singer', 'Zellweger', 'Gere', 'had', 'lot', 'courage', 'sign', 'up', 'film', 'had', 'attempted', 'musical', 'before', 'three', 'actors', 'really', 'outdid', 'hard', 'work', 'paid', 'off', 'Watch', 'Gere', 'footwork', 'tap', 'dance', 'scene', 'also', 'opening', 'number', 'Care', 'Love', 'Catherine', 'Jazz', 'rivals', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'Renee', 'was', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'loved', 'renditions', 'Funny', 'Honey', 'Nowadays', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Mama', 'Morton.Taking', 'facts', 'consideration', 'Chicago', 'outstanding', 'film', 'hopefully', 'brought', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'many', 'new', 'fans', 'world']",Chicago

Yes, a little.  It seems that one carry-over from Moulin Rouge is the ""music video"" style (which, hmmm, seems to be more of a music video thing than something old Bas created himself).

605621,A24NSMJ6CLIGYS,B00005JLSE,Leroy,"[2, 2]","What Rob Marshall did in bringing to life what seemed whimsically ancient and dead (the flashy Broadway musical to film) was nothing less then sheer brilliance.From the first few moments of Chicago, in a swanky, upper class booze soaked cabaret, one feels transported to the sexy times in beautiful technicolor: the roaring twenties.What sets the mood for Chicago: All that Jazz.  Arriving from the floor to belt out a thrilling number, Catherine Zeta-Jones is the best thing about the film, as a vampish, gorgeouss, voluptious murderess.  Out of all the Velma Kelly's potrayed throughout Chicago's life on stage and screen Catherine Zeta-Jones takes the cake.The meticulous, wonderful cheoreography in All that Jazz is what makes it my favorite number, but it's hard to pick.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for the signature song.Beautifully, Chicago tells the story of Roxie Hart, a floozy turned celebrity by murder.Through an array of spectacular songs, Chicago makes it clear that it's the best film of 2003.The corruption of the media, the public, the world is shown clear here, but in a very witty, sarcastic (if not synical way).  In the last number, Roxie and Velma wittily take to the stage with fake guns, which can be the evidence to this point.There is not one ""star"" of Chicago.  There are infact countless.  The costumes, sets, creativity, and lighting is enough to blow ones visual sences away.  However, the sheer talent through the characters brings the movie to life.Renee Zellweger is fantastic.  There is no one else I can imagine in the role of Roxie.  Richard Gere is very good, and who knew he could belt out a tune with style?  Queen Latifah and John C. Reily shine as signature supporting roles, and there numbers are some of the best in the film.  But they all dont add up to Catherine, who is sheer brilliance.  Her three big numbers are my favortes (All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and I Can't do it Alone), and not to mention she is one of the most beautiful and talented women in Hollywood.But the biggest star of Chicago is Rob Marshall, whose impeccable strength and creativity shined through in the thrilling direction and cheoreography of Chicago.Even for the non-musical person, Chicago is something to see.  It's dark, dirty, fantastic, and stunning.

But then it got nominated for an Academy Award.  I was curious as to what all the fuss was about.  And so I went to see it and sat in a packed theater just plain relaxing and letting myself be completely entertained.  Yes, this is a musical.  But it's done 2002 style.  In other words not only are  there lights, action and camera - there's also  fantastic film editing and camerawork, and such great pacing that I was completely carried away with the story and the music.The story is set in Chicago in the 1920s, a time where corruption was a ""given"", and the road to stardom lay in lurid headlines.  So when vaudeville star Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, murders her sister and husband in a jealous rage, the newspapers go wild.  She's in prison but is sure she can get off because of the good lawyer she has hired, played by Richard Gere. And the prison matron, played by Queen Latifah is helping her - for a price.  Well, along comes another murderess, Roxie Hart, played by Renee Zellweger, who has also murdered her lover.  The difference is that Roxie is not a star yet, just an aspiring one.  She's married to John C. Reilly, who's a bit dumb but loves his wife.  She convinces him to pay for her defense.  Now, there's competition between the two murderesses for the headlines.  It's all great fun to watch.  And the magnificent singing and dancing numbers really do move the action along.Catherine Zeta-Jones is a trained dancer and it shows. And of course Queen Latifah can really belt out a song.  John C. Reilly also has a vaudeville background.  But Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere had to learn to sing and dance for their parts.  I am impressed. They are wonderful.  The late Bob Fosse was one of the originators of the show, which opened in 1975.  It's been a hit all these years.  But this film translates it into a musical event.  I loved it.  And, even though the plot gets a little lurid at times, everyone can enjoy it.  It's a big, bold and beautiful production.

One titledRoxie Hart.  The Broadway musical originally stared Chita Revera  and Gwen Verdon, and was more recently in 1996, starring Bebe Neuwirth and Anne Renking.Roxy Hart is obsessed with becoming famous. She beds a man named Fred because he promises to get her famous and kills him(Fred)when she finds out he was lying.  That same night Velma Kelly has committed a nasty little crime as well and they both end up in Cooke County Jail. What ensues is the a story about what people will do to achieve and maintain fame  when nobody cares anymore.  When the initial shock of scandals wear off, the only why to stay in the limelight is to maintain a scandalous reputation through continued unethical escapades.  Thurs 2/7/13 A message that is especially fitting today with recent celebrities like ""Paris Hilton"" who's claim to fame was a sex tape, or the Kardashians or Miley Cyrus who live off of bad press.The music is timeless, and many of the shows musical numbers have become standards such as ""All that Jazz"" and ""When You're Good to Mama"", which transcend their source material, and this recording is a little less abrasive than the 1996 Cast recording which I own.  Anne Reinking can be overbearing with her raspy growls, though none-the-less effective, whereas Rene Zellweger covers all Roxy's bases, she has the charm that makes people love her, and the hidden evil and deadly persistence that makes Roxy interesting and who she is, while her voice isn't extremely strong, it is very expressive.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is great as Velma Kelly. Singing all the songs with zest and making them her own, while not necessarily as strong or gleeful as Bebe Neworth, she holds her own. Richard Gere is a better singer than expected and holds his own.  The real suprizes her are John C. Reily is just heart aching as Amous Hart Roxy's poor  husband who she treats like rotten meat and Queen Latifah.  Latifah's ""When Your Good to Mamma"" is almost definitive, and John C. Reily's ""Mr. Celophane"" is vulnerable while not being slight in his delivery, which has been the problem with some singer's previous versions.The film is beautiful to watch, and the camera work at times is a little too frantic at times, but it captures the story very while.  The script is tight, and instead of being a musical where people actually randomly break out in songs, all of the musical sequences except the last one, take place in Roxy's mind, which only accentuate her mental instability.  All in all a strong version of the Broadway musical with a message that will always be important as long as celebrities exist, and especially while ""reality"" shows remain popular.God Bless ~Amy",4,A Fine Film Adaptation of the Broadway Musical.,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,2962,"['NOTE', 'moved', 'moved', 'theatrical', 'release', 'page', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'blu-ray', 'page', 'solely', 'review', 'film', 'not', 'extras', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'picture.Based', 'murders', 'Roxy', 'Hart', '1920', '2', 'other', 'non-musical', 'films', 'were', 'based', 'One', 'titledRoxie', 'Hart', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'originally', 'stared', 'Chita', 'Revera', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'was', 'more', 'recently', '1996', 'starring', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'Anne', 'Renking.Roxy', 'Hart', 'obsessed', 'becoming', 'famous', 'man', 'named', 'Fred', 'get', 'famous', 'Fred', 'when', 'was', 'lying', 'same', 'night', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'committed', 'nasty', 'little', 'crime', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'Cooke', 'County', 'Jail', 'What', 'story', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'achieve', 'maintain', 'fame', 'when', 'nobody', 'anymore', 'When', 'initial', 'shock', 'scandals', 'wear', 'only', 'why', 'stay', 'limelight', 'maintain', 'scandalous', 'reputation', 'continued', 'unethical', 'escapades', '2/7/13', 'A', 'message', 'especially', 'fitting', 'today', 'recent', 'celebrities', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'who', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'sex', 'tape', 'Kardashians', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'who', 'live', 'bad', 'press.The', 'music', 'timeless', 'many', 'shows', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'become', 'standards', 'such', 'Jazz', 'When', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Mama', 'transcend', 'source', 'material', 'recording', 'little', 'less', 'abrasive', '1996', 'Cast', 'recording', 'own', 'Anne', 'Reinking', 'can', 'be', 'overbearing', 'raspy', 'growls', 'none-the-less', 'effective', 'whereas', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'Roxy', 'bases', 'charm', 'people', 'hidden', 'evil', 'deadly', 'persistence', 'Roxy', 'interesting', 'who', 'voice', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'strong', 'very', 'expressive', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'great', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Singing', 'songs', 'zest', 'making', 'own', 'not', 'necessarily', 'strong', 'gleeful', 'Bebe', 'Neworth', 'own', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'better', 'singer', 'expected', 'own', 'real', 'are', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'just', 'heart', 'aching', 'Amous', 'Hart', 'Roxy', 'poor', 'husband', 'who', 'rotten', 'meat', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Latifah', 'When', 'Good', 'Mamma', 'almost', 'definitive', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'Mr.', 'Celophane', 'vulnerable', 'not', 'being', 'slight', 'delivery', 'been', 'problem', 'singer', 'previous', 'versions.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'camera', 'work', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'frantic', 'times', 'story', 'very', 'script', 'tight', 'instead', 'being', 'musical', 'where', 'people', 'actually', 'randomly', 'break', 'out', 'songs', 'musical', 'sequences', 'last', 'one', 'take', 'place', 'Roxy', 'mind', 'only', 'accentuate', 'mental', 'instability', 'strong', 'version', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'message', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'important', 'as', 'long', 'celebrities', 'exist', 'especially', 'reality', 'shows', 'remain', 'popular.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",Chicago

While it highlighted the musical and dancing talents of its stars not just one person in this movie shined they all did. This movie based on the Broadway musical is better than the musical ever was. This movie was able to take the vision that the writer had and bring it to life in a way that the musical never could. It was able to clearly separate reality from fantasy with dazzling dance numbers, fantastic music terrifically performed by the stars.

605628,A1NF3VPMUFHRCC,B00005JLSE,"Literary Lass ""neocat_08840""","[5, 7]","The journey of CHICAGO from stageboards to sound stage is probably worthy of A LOST IN LA MANCHA documentary. Over the years, I had heard rumors of Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn, Tracey Ullman, Madonna, all eyeing the chances to play either Roxie or Velma. Contracts and squabbling led to negotiations and renegotiations, and the project sat shelved and ignored for years.Now, the musical has made its way to the big screen and the wait was hardly worth it. Yes, the score is basically true to the original theater rendering (minus some numbers, abbreviating others)and the dance moments are reminiscent of Fosse's original steps. However, the film doesn't have the energy or the vison of a real musical. Cynical by nature, bleak in subject matter, this certainly isn't MY FAIR LADY or GIGI, but even so, the movie seems self-conscious about presenting its showstopper interludes.Every song in this play was tailored to present ""Razzle Dazzle,"" for its original performers (Verdon, Rivera, Orbach) were legends of the Great White Way. Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, and Gere are not musical performers in the same caliber. Gere and Zeta-Jones have musical-comedy appearances on their resumes, but Zellweger was a true neophyte, an actual ingenue.It's Zellweger who anchors this movie. Despite Zeta-Jones's superior dancing skills and belting, full-blown voice, she doesn't really create a character for Velma Kelly. She's beautiful and can take a close-up; she doesn't invest her Velma with any personality. Gere, likewise, looks fabulous, but his Billy Flynn is devoid of the right sleaziness, the correct cockiness and bullishness. (Also, a huge fuss was made about his tap dancing lessons for this flick; yet he is shot in almost total darkness during his big routine. It could have been a dance double doing the two-step.)It's Renee Zelwegger, with her breathy voice, peculiar looks, gangly body, and exposed nerves that catapults this into a memorable flick. She sings her role, but it's so much more than that. She attacks her characterization. She lets us see how Roxie is dying for fame, so much so, that she kills for it. She invests her song-and-dance numbers with honest-to-goodness emotions, and she uses her choreography to make her character both vulnerable and steely, abused and abusive. She is the tour-de-force.Unlike MOULIN ROUGE, where director Baz Luhrmann allowed 95% of the numbers to be shot in entirety, permitting songs to flow from start to finish, CHICAGO's director Rob Marshall relies too much on MTV quick cuts and rapid-fire edits. It's as if he is distancing himself from the very medium he is honoring. It's a shame that the Kander-and-Ebb musical waited nearly 30 years to go on screen, and its arrival is at times disjointed and interrupted.For those who want to see a complete musical, a show that rejoices in its characters bursting into song and movement, rent MOULIN ROUGE or some of the great MGM masterpieces. If you want a sly, wry, cyncial ""black"" comedy that occasionally makes a melodious point, go to CHICAGO. It may be a hell of a town, but it's not a hell of a movie.",3,"Don't Walk Away, Renee",1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,3108,"['journey', 'CHICAGO', 'stageboards', 'sound', 'stage', 'probably', 'worthy', 'LOST', 'IN', 'LA', 'MANCHA', 'documentary', 'years', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Madonna', 'eyeing', 'chances', 'play', 'either', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'Contracts', 'squabbling', 'led', 'negotiations', 'renegotiations', 'project', 'sat', 'shelved', 'ignored', 'years.Now', 'musical', 'made', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'wait', 'was', 'hardly', 'worth', 'Yes', 'score', 'basically', 'true', 'original', 'theater', 'rendering', 'numbers', 'abbreviating', 'others', 'dance', 'moments', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Fosse', 'original', 'steps', 'However', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'vison', 'real', 'musical', 'Cynical', 'nature', 'bleak', 'subject', 'matter', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'GIGI', 'even', 'so', 'movie', 'self-conscious', 'presenting', 'showstopper', 'interludes.Every', 'song', 'play', 'was', 'tailored', 'present', 'Razzle', 'Dazzle', 'original', 'performers', 'Verdon', 'Rivera', 'Orbach', 'were', 'legends', 'Great', 'White', 'Way', 'Zellweger', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Gere', 'are', 'not', 'musical', 'performers', 'same', 'caliber', 'Gere', 'Zeta-Jones', 'have', 'musical-comedy', 'appearances', 'resumes', 'Zellweger', 'was', 'true', 'neophyte', 'actual', 'ingenue.It', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'movie', 'Zeta-Jones', 'superior', 'dancing', 'skills', 'belting', 'full-blown', 'voice', ""n't"", 'really', 'create', 'character', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'beautiful', 'can', 'take', 'close-up', ""n't"", 'invest', 'Velma', 'personality', 'Gere', 'likewise', 'fabulous', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'devoid', 'right', 'sleaziness', 'correct', 'cockiness', 'bullishness', 'Also', 'huge', 'fuss', 'was', 'made', 'tap', 'dancing', 'lessons', 'flick', 'shot', 'almost', 'total', 'darkness', 'big', 'routine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dance', 'double', 'doing', 'two-step', 'Renee', 'Zelwegger', 'breathy', 'voice', 'peculiar', 'looks', 'gangly', 'body', 'exposed', 'nerves', 'catapults', 'memorable', 'flick', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'characterization', 'see', 'how', 'Roxie', 'dying', 'fame', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'honest-to-goodness', 'emotions', 'choreography', 'make', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'steely', 'abused', 'abusive', 'tour-de-force.Unlike', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'where', 'director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'allowed', '95', '%', 'numbers', 'be', 'shot', 'entirety', 'permitting', 'songs', 'flow', 'start', 'finish', 'CHICAGO', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'too', 'much', 'MTV', 'quick', 'cuts', 'rapid-fire', 'edits', 'distancing', 'very', 'medium', 'honoring', 'shame', 'Kander-and-Ebb', 'musical', 'waited', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'go', 'screen', 'arrival', 'times', 'disjointed', 'interrupted.For', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'complete', 'musical', 'show', 'characters', 'bursting', 'song', 'movement', 'rent', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'great', 'MGM', 'masterpieces', 'want', 'sly', 'wry', 'cyncial', 'black', 'comedy', 'occasionally', 'melodious', 'point', 'go', 'CHICAGO', 'may', 'be', 'hell', 'town', 'not', 'hell', 'movie']",Chicago

The production design and the camera work keep you on your toes!Other standout performances include John C.

It steps (literally in some scenes) outside itself often enough to remind the viewer that he or she is implicated in the show-biz aspect of criminal justice as deeply as the system itself (see NATURAL BORN KILLERS for further reference).  It's brash, but that is precisely its motivation.  It's loud, garish and contrived.  It has to be - - not only because it's scripted but in order to untrivialize its theme while showing how it has been trivialized.  That Renee Zellweger as murderess Roxie Hart is made to look like Madeline Kahn made to look like Marilynn Monroe is telling enough.  There are a lot of great scenes, my personal fave being the climactic courtroom scene late into the film wherein Richard Gere's character verbally tapdances his way to his client's acquital; the interspliced tapdancing bits of Gere himself are both hilarious and perfectly spot-on.

605637,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JLSE,Mark,"[1, 3]","Chicago may not be the most deserving of Best Picture winners, but the plot is solid, the acting is fantastic, the choreography is great, and some of the songs are very entertaining (see Gere's tap dancing scene), while some of the others seem to go on forever.  One of the problems to the film is that it makes use of the ""musical"" too much.  There seems to be a new song every three minutes, while in a stage musical, the songs would be spread out further.  But, the film has such a feel-good emotion to it.  We empathize and care about the characters, even when they are doing everything in their powers to get fame and fortune.  Gere's character is ruthless, moving from one big thing to the next, while throwing each client out the door when they lose popularity.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good, also very ruthless, and we feel her pain of being yesterday's news.  Queen Latifah did not really impress me, and I don't think she quite had the edge for an Oscar nomination (in fact, I don't think Zeta-Jones should have won either; clearly the strongest supporting actress in the race was Meryl Streep in Adaptation).  I like the film, the music is good, Rob Marshall never really has impressed me as a director (which is why Polanski took home the Oscar), and I don't think that the film was good enough for a Best Picture win.

How the heck did this hunk of junk win any Oscars?The movie's plot is terrible.  A hopeful starlet, Roxy, shoots the man that she is having an affair with after she learns that despite what she thought, he has no connection in the nightclub world and will not help her get a gig.  She goes to prison where she meets another murderess/singer, Velma, and Mama Morton, a prison mistress that is the least developed of a string of underdeveloped characters.  Several bad musical numbers follow, Richard Gere's character eventually gets both Roxy and Velma off and they become famous.  Great writing, huh?The manipulation of the justice system in this movie is preposterous.  How is it remotely possible that not one, but two murders get off scott free and then become stars with their own show about, you guessed it, glorifity murder.  Obvisouly, this is not a morality musical.  It doesn't have any good moral in it all.  It is just a stupid story with unlikable characters.People say that the musical numbers in this movie were great.  I can't see how this is true.

605645,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLSE,Matthew Horner,"[9, 14]","The movie musical was a popular form of entertainment, as well as a dependable source of income for studios, from the advent of sound in the 1920s until the late 1960s. The genre's zenith, at least in terms of financial results, was achieved in 1965 with the release of the wildly successful ""The Sound of Music"". Afterwards, there were a few big hits, [notably ""Oliver"" and ""Grease""], but changing times and audience tastes forced movie musicals into virtual extinction by the late 1970s.The genre returned with a bang in 2001 with the release of ""Moulin Rouge"". This was not your mother's musical. The pace was frantic, and the style was closer to MTV videos than to ""Singin' in the Rain"". Here was a movie for the 21st Century - frenzied, yet still stylish and vastly entertaining. Now comes ""Chicago"", which, though more traditional than ""Moulin Rouge"", is a fresh, inventive movie that is quite in keeping with today's tastes in entertainment.The movie is based on the hit Broadway musical, which itself was based on an old play about flappers, showgirls, murder and music in late 1920s Chicago. Roxie Hart [Renee Zellweger] and Velma Kelly [Catherine Zeta-Jones] are arrested for different murders and sent to Cook County Jail. Both are defended by suave, cynical Billy Flynn [Richard Gere], who sees them less as clients than as great publicity tools for his burgeoning legal career. Velma has a singing and dancing career. Roxie dreams of one. The movie cleverly uses Roxie's dreams and fantasies to introduce some great musical numbers, some of which are real showstoppers.One of the best things about ""Chicago"" is that none of the performances are faked. Everyone does his or her own singing and dancing. That's no surprise when it comes to the marvelous Queen Latifah, who plays the conniving Matron `Mama' Morton, or to Zeta-Jones whose career began on the musical stage. But who knew that Gere is a great singer and can even tap dance up a storm? Or that Zellweger is even more talented than we already thought? Or that the amazing John C. Reilly, who plays Velma's naive husband, sings beautifully?`Chicago' is a real treat. Whether the movie musical is experiencing a true revival remains to be seen.

Some people liked Moulin Rouge. I love Chicago. The cast is incredable: Renee Zellweger (who learned to dance and sing in a matter of months) is spectacular and should have won an Oscar for this film, with along side the extremely talented and strong voiced Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifa (who's the best in this movie, then I've ever seen her in anything else), and the amazing Richard Gere who will make you smile with his numbers and dance moves.The movie is set of course in Chicago around the 1920's, where we meet a woman named Roxie Hart who will do anything to become famous. Starts off on the wrong foot by killing a man who she had thought could get her into vaudeville. Now thrown in jail Roxie becomes famous due to her lawyer Billy Flynn turning the story around to where Roxie is the innocent one. Meanwhile, while making enemies with the famous singer/dancer Velma Kelly who then both compete for media attention. And love stepping over each other's toe's. During this time Roxie daydreams of song and dance numbers at every event she experiences while in prison.The storyline, the music which fits extremely well and I have listened to this amazing soundtrack over and over again, makes this the best classic movie of all time and is well worth all the awards and nominations. Nothing is played down to the audience and there's no body doubles in this film everyone did their own song and dance.And from the behind the scene's look that's featured on the DVD this one story is based on a bunch of 'like' stories from around that time - minus the song and dance - but a reporter Mary Sunshine who was played by Christine Baranski in the film - actually wrote stories of women killing their men and writing about them in the paper to get the public to feel sorry for them and which stopped them from getting hanged. She then went onto writing the play which turned into the Broadway Hit with help of Bob Fosse.So in summery the movie, the music, the dancing, and the DVD is all the way an A!!",5,It's All That and More!,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2130,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'been', 'ages', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'movies', 'people', 'liked', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'love', 'Chicago', 'cast', 'incredable', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'learned', 'dance', 'sing', 'matter', 'months', 'spectacular', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'film', 'along', 'side', 'extremely', 'talented', 'strong', 'voiced', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'who', 'best', 'movie', 'then', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'amazing', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'numbers', 'dance', 'moves.The', 'movie', 'set', 'course', 'Chicago', '1920', 'where', 'meet', 'woman', 'named', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'become', 'famous', 'wrong', 'foot', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'vaudeville', 'Now', 'thrown', 'jail', 'Roxie', 'famous', 'due', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'turning', 'story', 'where', 'Roxie', 'innocent', 'one', 'Meanwhile', 'making', 'enemies', 'famous', 'singer/dancer', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'who', 'then', 'compete', 'media', 'attention', 'love', 'stepping', 'other', 'toe', 'time', 'Roxie', 'daydreams', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'event', 'prison.The', 'storyline', 'music', 'extremely', 'well', 'have', 'listened', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'over', 'again', 'best', 'classic', 'movie', 'time', 'well', 'worth', 'awards', 'nominations', 'Nothing', 'played', 'down', 'audience', 'body', 'film', 'everyone', 'did', 'own', 'song', 'dance.And', 'scene', 'look', 'featured', 'DVD', 'one', 'story', 'based', 'bunch', ""'like"", 'stories', 'time', 'song', 'dance', 'reporter', 'Mary', 'Sunshine', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'film', 'actually', 'wrote', 'stories', 'women', 'killing', 'men', 'writing', 'paper', 'get', 'public', 'feel', 'sorry', 'stopped', 'getting', 'hanged', 'then', 'went', 'writing', 'play', 'turned', 'Broadway', 'Hit', 'help', 'Bob', 'Fosse.So', 'summery', 'movie', 'music', 'dancing', 'DVD', 'way', 'A']",Chicago

The story centers around a young wannabe starlet named Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger).  She has an affair with a man who promises her a ticket to stardom.  When she finds out he was dishonest with her, she shoots him out of rage.  She soon lands in jail with the prospect of being executed.Enter Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a glory-hungry lawyer who has never rendered a guilty verdict.  He helps reshape Roxie's image and starts her on the path she's always dreamed of: one to public adoration and popularity.  Complicating things is Velma Kelly, another dancing murderess played deliciously by Catherine Zeta-Jones.  The two, both represented by Billy, compete for his attention and the biggest stories in the papers.What follows is a circus of greed, sexuality, sensationalism, and secrets, all coupled with bright lights, powerful songs, and bold dance numbers.  ""Chicago"" offers us all a peek into this secret world of the jazzy but corrupt roaring 20's, much like Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" clued us in on turn-of-the-century Paris.Much in the style of Luhrman, director Rob Marshall employs a very quick camera style.  This adds an element of dizziness as the characters witness their world being turned upside down.  It makes the dance numbers appear more sharp and more in-your-face.Only one word can describe the cast: FLAWLESS!  Zellweger perfectly captures the very naive quality of every young girl who wants to be an actress or a singer.  Zeta-Jones, an incredible singer and dancer, lights up every stage she's on and every scene she's in.  Gere is surprising as slimy Billy Flynn, delivering vibrant songs and outrageous courtroom dramatics.  Queen Latifah was fantastic as Mama Morton.  Her solo was one of the spiciest moments in the film!  Finally, there is John C. Reilly as Roxie's dim-witted but faithful husband Amos.  He is the most honest and good-natured character in the whole film.The direction, production, costumes, set design, and editing were all brilliant.

And she can sing and dance also...who'd have thought?Marshall has structured the film in such a way as to dispel many people's aversion to musicals by turning the musical numbers into dream sequences...Roxie's dreams. Frankly, though you still have people bursting into song with little or no provocation so Marshall's efforts are probably for naught. The fact is either you like Musicals or you don't or you're willing to dispel your disbelief or you're not. If the songs and the performances of said songs are good I'm right there with it, if not...I'm not. ""Chicago"" has good songs and great performances...enough said about that.For me, the musical set piece of ""Chicago"" is Roxie/Zellweger's performance, in a breathy Marilyn Monroe way, of her signature song, ""Roxie Hart."" It's exemplary.Catherine Zeta Jones plays Velma but in many ways this is a familiar style role for her: smart, sassy, sexy. Velma is not a stretch for her but she's effective, as usual.Billy Flynn looks like a role Richard Gere has been wanting to play his whole life because he seems to be having so much fun that we in turn have loads of fun watching him sing and dance and over-act.

Also, one can't fault a movie with a cast like this one.  However, after finally seeing it, I am disappointed.  Several reasons:  the show has no real showstopping, hummable songs---even ALL THAT JAZZ doesn't carry the movie like DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, OH WHAT  BEAUTIFUL MORNING and HELLO DOLLY.  The deleted ""Class"" is an awful, foul-mouthed attempt at humor, but it certainly showcased the vocal abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah.  Also, the leading ladies were murderesses:  how could one want either of them to be successful?  Latifah, though Oscar nominated, is playing the same shtick she does in any of her movies, and in my opinion, didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.  The revelations, of course, were Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly's vocal deliveries.  Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.  Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number; he has a richly nuanced voice and it's one of the best numbers in the film.  Zeta-Jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.  I've read where the transfer to film brought Roxie's character to the front, and minimized Velma's.  Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta-Jones had more screen time.  I do think Catherine deserved her Oscar, though.  This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.  Zellwegger always seems to be playing the same Nurse Betty and Cold Mountain characters in all of her films.CHICAGO is big, blustery and well conceived, but it's just not fun nor moving, and if a movie musical is neither of those, then why add music at all?",3,DISAPPOINTING BUT WELL DONE,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,1874,"['CHICAGO', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'oscar', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'being', 'fan', 'movie', 'musicals', 'years', 'was', 'happy', 'success', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'cast', 'one', 'However', 'finally', 'seeing', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Several', 'reasons', 'show', 'real', 'showstopping', 'hummable', 'songs', '-even', 'JAZZ', ""n't"", 'carry', 'movie', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RAIN', 'ON', 'MY', 'PARADE', 'OH', 'WHAT', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MORNING', 'HELLO', 'DOLLY', 'deleted', 'Class', 'awful', 'foul-mouthed', 'attempt', 'humor', 'certainly', 'showcased', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Also', 'leading', 'ladies', 'were', 'murderesses', 'how', 'could', 'one', 'want', 'be', 'successful', 'Latifah', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'playing', 'same', 'shtick', 'movies', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'revelations', 'course', 'were', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'vocal', 'deliveries', 'Gere', 'truly', 'took', 'chance', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'marvelous', 'DID', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Reilly', 'too', 'revealing', 'CELLOPHANE', 'MAN', 'number', 'richly', 'nuanced', 'voice', 'one', 'best', 'numbers', 'film', 'Zeta-Jones', 'also', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'pizzazz', 'energy', 'Zellwegger', ""'ve"", 'read', 'where', 'transfer', 'film', 'brought', 'Roxie', 'character', 'front', 'minimized', 'Velma', 'Who', 'how', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Velma', 'Zeta-Jones', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'do', 'think', 'Catherine', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'though', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'talented', 'shown', 'diversity', 'many', 'roles', 'Zellwegger', 'always', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'characters', 'films.CHICAGO', 'big', 'blustery', 'well', 'conceived', 'just', 'not', 'fun', 'moving', 'movie', 'musical', 'then', 'why', 'add', 'music']",Chicago

605657,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B00005JLSE,Michael J. Edelman,"[4, 6]","It's interesting that a musical that was not a hit when it premiered in the 70s has become such a massive hit as a movie, especially in an era when so few Broadway musicals have been transposed to the screen. Fosse's shows have never been mass audience favorites, dealing, as they so often do, with the darkest sides of the human condition. And yet the film version of Chicago has been a near universal hit.Certainly a lot of the popularity of Chicago has been a consequence of the popular cast, who may have been hired for their star qualities, but who- without exception- turned in first rate performance. Who would have thought, for example, that Richard Gere would deliver such a good musical performance, or that Queen Latifa would be so good in traditional Broadway material? I'm sure these two alone brought a lot of people into the theater. The real stars of course are Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellwiger, whose song and dance routines impressed even those critics who panned the show as a whole.I also suspect that part of the greater success of the film over the stage version is that today's audiences are more conditioned to expect the dark and ironic in the musical theater. And this show is nothing if not dark. The message, if there is one, is that content is nothing and appearance is everything.

Rognlien,"[1, 3]","The stage-to-film transition for Fosse's ""Chicago"" has been many years in the making, but it was definitely worth the wait.It's interesting to me that while I don't particularily care for Catherine Zeta-Jones OR Rene Zelleweger, I think they were both fantastic in their roles in this film, as was Richard Gere.  Impressive that, similar to Evita (Madonna's version) and Moulin Rouge, all of the principal actors did their own vocals.  While they're not going to win any Grammy's for best vocalists, they all did very well.I won't recap the story, but for anyone who enjoyed the stage version of this film (as I did - saw it twice) and/or enjoys a movie/musical, this film is a must-see.

605659,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JLSE,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 4]","The Walt Disney Company and Storyline Entertainment have had a very successful relationship together reviving old musicals which they hope to continue with Chicago. In 1997, they revived Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's Cinderella which aired on The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC and became a ratings success. Both companies were willing to see if lightening strikes twice so a revival of the old favorite Annie was created for ABC in 1999 and followed in the footsteps of Cinderella. Now that Storyline Entertainment has proven to be a worthy investment, the real test was to revive the musicals for the big screen. The musical has greatly lost its luster since the golden days of the 1930's. The highest grossing musical since 1975 was Grease, which opened in 1978, and the most successful musical in recent memory would have to be 2001's Moulin Rouge with a $57 million take. With that in mind, will Storyline Entertainment find success once again with their film adaptation of the Broadway favorite Chicago or will this be their first failure?The story of Chicago focuses on the lovely Roxie Hart who has huge dreams about becoming a star like her idol Velma Kelly. She is willing to do anything to obtain that dream which includes cheating on her husband with a guy who claims to have connection in the business. One night Roxie finds out the truth about her secret lover and taking the gun from her dresser, she shoots him once and then shoots him again. After her husband spills the beans, she is taken to jail where she learns that one can still become famous with the right angle and the right lawyer. That lawyer is the flashy Billy Flinn, who has never lost a case with a woman client. Roxie soon enters a new world of deception and greed as she competes with the famous Velma Kelly for the razzle, dazzle lawyer. Who will come out on top in Chicago? The storyline for Chicago is fabulously well done. The musicals sequence strive from the imagination of Roxie Hart which allows the musical to be a musical without the song and dance sequences come off as tacky. Most musicals start out a song with the usual one liner with dancers coming out singing moments later. Chicago thankfully doesn't do that and it works.The cast of Chicago is truly an Oscar worthy cast. The most fabulous thing about the cast was that each actor and actress did his or her own singing. They may not all hit the right note but the feeling that you get from the film is very gratifying. The biggest surprise from the bunch is Richard Gere who plays the flashy lawyer, Billy Flinn. He really shines in numbers like Razzle Dazzle and All I Care About. Cathrine-Zeta Jones, who is actually a Broadway veteran, really shows off her stuff with great style especially in the opening sequence of the film. Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character Roxie Hart. There could have been someone better then Zellweger to the play this role but she still does a decent job. She definitely has the right look for the role but it was her dancing and singing in the musical that were the big disappointments. John C. Reilly does such a fantastic job especially n the Mister Cellophane number that there is no need mentioning anything else. Queen Latifah was a delightful surprise as Mama Morton. The remainder of the cast does a wonderful job at providing the perfect amount of background characters that you would expect from the Chicago backdrop.Overall, the film adaptation of Chicago was as good or better then all the buzz suggested the film would be. The songs are amazingly well done with best being Razzle Dazzle, Mister Cellophane, and the Cell Block Tango. The numbers were quite surprising and didn't come off tacky as originally thought. Most of the cast seems to work well except for two. And was said before, Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character, Roxie Hart. There certainly could have been a better to take the role but Zellweger works fine, just not outstanding. The other member who didn't work well was Lucy Liu. It wasn't her but her character that was the problem. Her slight appearance in the film seemed kind of pointless though she does help play out the rest of the story just a bit. They could have done a lot more with her character but it is no real loss. The comeback of the movie musical may have been started by Moulin Rouge but Chicago continues the surge with full force. Chicago is one of the best movie musicals in recent memories and one the best films this year.

Moore,"[3, 7]","Every once in a while an unknown director comes along who serves notice of extraordinary talent, such as Orson Welles with ""Citizen Kane"" or Francis Ford Coppola with ""The Godfather."" It's hard to say how Rob Marshall's career will turn out, but he serves notice with ""Chicago"" that his name can be mentioned without embarrassment in the same sentence as Welles' and Coppola's. In a time when movie musicals are a nearly moribund art form, ""Chicago"" is one of the very few ever made that approaches the excitement and immediacy of a musical live on stage. Movie musicals notoriously offer myriad pitfalls for bathos, usually involving stars who can't sing or dance or directors who don't know how to stage a musical number. Marshall, a choreographer by training, wrings every inherent drop of excitement and pizzazz from every number, and he takes care to hire stars who CAN sing and dance--most notably Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both perfect for a musical set in the Jazz Age. They look like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks reborn, they sing wonderfully, they dance with elegance and panache, and they have more than enough sexiness and charisma to be proclaimed the ""It Girls"" for this generation. And what characters they get to play: Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses sharing the same unctuous lawyer (Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere) and the same uncanny instincts for survival and publicity. Coming less than a decade after the O.J. Simpson trial and in the midst of the ""Reality TV"" craze, this smart, funny, scaldingly cynical film has much of importance to say about the vicious triviality of American celebrity culture. If you can take your eyes off Zellweger and Zeta-Jones--and that is, admittedly, very hard--you will note the abundant excellence of Queen Latifah, as venal jailhouse matron ""Mama"" Morton, and John C. Reilly--perhaps this generation's finest character actor, and with an unexpectedly lovely singing voice--as Zellweger's sad-sack hubby, Amos. As for Richard Gere, much has been made in the press of his being snubbed by Oscar. No one besides Gere could have made the brazen dishonesty of Billy Flynn so engaging, and he acquits himself well in his song-and-dance numbers. But whereas Gere is very good and memorable, the others--Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly--are mesmerizing and unforgettable.",5,The Best Film of 2002.,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2362,"['once', 'while', 'unknown', 'director', 'who', 'notice', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'such', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'career', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'notice', 'Chicago', 'name', 'can', 'be', 'mentioned', 'embarrassment', 'same', 'sentence', 'Welles', 'Coppola', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'musicals', 'are', 'nearly', 'moribund', 'art', 'form', 'Chicago', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'ever', 'made', 'excitement', 'immediacy', 'musical', 'live', 'stage', 'Movie', 'musicals', 'notoriously', 'offer', 'myriad', 'pitfalls', 'bathos', 'usually', 'involving', 'stars', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'dance', 'directors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stage', 'musical', 'number', 'Marshall', 'choreographer', 'training', 'wrings', 'inherent', 'drop', 'excitement', 'pizzazz', 'number', 'care', 'hire', 'stars', 'who', 'CAN', 'sing', 'dance', 'most', 'notably', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'perfect', 'musical', 'set', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'look', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'reborn', 'sing', 'wonderfully', 'dance', 'elegance', 'panache', 'have', 'more', 'enough', 'sexiness', 'charisma', 'be', 'proclaimed', 'Girls', 'generation', 'what', 'characters', 'get', 'play', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'two', 'murderesses', 'sharing', 'same', 'unctuous', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'same', 'uncanny', 'instincts', 'survival', 'publicity', 'Coming', 'less', 'decade', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'trial', 'midst', 'Reality', 'TV', 'craze', 'smart', 'funny', 'scaldingly', 'cynical', 'film', 'much', 'importance', 'say', 'vicious', 'triviality', 'American', 'celebrity', 'culture', 'can', 'take', 'eyes', 'Zellweger', 'Zeta-Jones', 'admittedly', 'very', 'hard', 'will', 'note', 'abundant', 'excellence', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'venal', 'jailhouse', 'matron', 'Mama', 'Morton', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'perhaps', 'generation', 'finest', 'character', 'actor', 'unexpectedly', 'lovely', 'singing', 'voice', 'Zellweger', 'sad-sack', 'hubby', 'Amos', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'press', 'being', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'one', 'Gere', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'brazen', 'dishonesty', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'engaging', 'well', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'Gere', 'very', 'good', 'memorable', 'others', 'Zellweger', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Latifah', 'Reilly', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'unforgettable']",Chicago

Roxie (Renee Zellweger) is a chorus girl who dreams of being a star.  One day she shoots her lover in a rage at his betrayal. In prison she meets Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who was Chicago's most celebrated showgirl until she shot and killed two people. Velma has retained the city's most successful defense lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who never fails to produce acquittals for women indicted for murder. Roxy also seeks Flynn's representation and quickly becomes his star client. The two women compete for headlines, trial dates, public sympathy, and all the stardom that their crimes can get them, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of each other and of the public's taste for the latest spilt blood.Director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon have successfully adapted Bob Fosse's popular musical ""Chicago"" for the screen. The production is spectacular. The ""stagey"" musical numbers and more conventional dramatic scenes are well integrated. Dion Beebe's cinematography is creative and impressive. My only criticism of the film is that some of the more circus-like musical numbers struck me as overproduced and over-stimulating. Many modern stage musicals become ensnared in the trap of overproduction, which can do more to distance the viewers from the musical numbers than to draw the audience into them. Some of that seems to have carried over into ""Chicago""'s movie version. But the performances are good. Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere cope admirably with the challenge of singing and dancing in a musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a standout performance. She unabashedly plays her character over-the-top, belts out every song with great conviction, and really sells her performance. Another  impressive performance comes from Queen Latifah, who plays the women's prison warden, Mama. She also holds nothing back, and it doesn't hurt that she is a singer by profession. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah both have considerable stage experience, as well as being blessed with screen presence, which might explain their ability to bring great energy and a larger-than-life quality to this film version of a Broadway musical. If you're a fan of musicals, Chicago is a must-see. If you're not...well, musicals aren't everyone's cup of tea.

Amos is covering for Roxie but when he finds out who is dead, he realizes what happens and hands Roxie over to the police.Roxie arrives in the joint and meets Matron ""Mama"" Morton and she explains the rules (When You're Good to Mama.) (Look for the original Broadway Velma Kelly, Chita Rivera, in this scene.)We get to meet the girls of Murder's Row in The Cell Block Tango.  Each describes what happened to land her on Murder's Row. (He ran into my knife, he ran into my knife ten times!)Enter into the mix, the great murder attorney Billy Flynn.  Billy is Chicago's premiere defense attorney for women accused of murder.  He has never lost a case but he is not in it for the money ($5,000 per case) but All I Care About is love.Billy decides to take on Roxie as a client but first, he must make her into a the a sympathetic character.  The best lies are based on truth and they embellish on Roxie's past but when it comes to the night in question well, We Both Reached for the Gun (this is particularly effective.  Roxie and all the reporters are just marionettes with Billy pulling the strings.With her sudden fame, Roxie ponders what might be when she is acquitted.  Velma realizes that Roxie has taken her thunder and makes a desperate attempt to form an alliance because I Can't Do It Alone.  But Roxie quickly finds out that fame is fleeting when a heiress goes on a rampage and kills her boyfriend and his two playmates.This is where Roxie shows that she is not a dumb blonde and creates a fake pregnancy.  And once again becomes #1 murderess but her husband realizes that he will always be Mister Cellophane.As the trial approaches, Billy tells Roxie that trials are all Razzle Dazzle and everything is going fine until Velma is given Roxie's diary which has some damning passages.  This sends Billy into A Tap Dance.In the end, both Roxie and Velma get off but Roxie still wants the fame and finds out that Chicago is crawling with murderesses and fame comes in pairs Nowadays and teams up with Velma.This film is great on many levels.  As a screen adaptation of a musical, it is true to the source material.  The songs that were left out were because they did not fit the concept of the movie (See DVD extra Class).  As a commentary on today's judicial circus, it shows that things have not changed over the past fifty years - you have enough money, you can get away with murder.  And as a movie, it is just plain fun.Rob Marshall has a vast background in musical theatre and it shows that he understands that form.  What he doesn't have is a background in film making but this does not show in this polished film.  He has gathered a high caliber cast and crew that all perform to perfection.What many feel was the great find was Catherine Zeta Jones.  But once you see her pedigree (she was a dance champion in Wales), this was a breeze for her.  That is not saying her performance was not incredible, it was, but it was the part that she was waiting for and finally got!Renee Zellweger had the greatest challenge, musical comedy was totally foreign to her but she comes through perfectly.  But a lot of this is due to Marshall.  Having Zeta Jones as the professional entertainer Velma Kelly, allowed Marshall choose a non dancer for the role of Roxie.  And as Roxie, Renee shines.  She captures that fine line between innocence and conniving murderess.Richard Gere has a musical background but not a strong one.  Therefore, his performance is better than expected.  He actually took tap lessons and performs all his own dancing.  This was probably the most overlooked performance of the year (well except by the Golden Globes.)DVD EXTRAS:Deleted Musical Number ""Class"" by Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah with optional commentary by Marshall and writer Bill Condon - Watch the number first then rewatch with the commentary.  This will give you maximum  enjoyment of what is one of the great musical numbers that didn't make the film.Behind the Scenes Special - This was a making of documentary that was made after the movie won its six Oscars.  This is very good featurette that has lots of insights into the making of the film.Commentary by director Rob Marshall and writer Bill Condon.",5,"Razzle Dazzle, Murder and All That

Not only did the movie bring in a staggering $170+ million at the box office, but the film ultimately garnered a Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Supporting Actress award for Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Is ""Chicago"" all that jazz?Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) dreams of becoming a star on the Chicago stage.  But when she's double crossed by her lover, she murders him and it seems she's traded a future on the stage to for a prison sentence.  Or has she? Roxie finds herself behind bars with singer/dancer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is accused of killing her husband and sister.  Roxie finds out that Velma has paid off ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), the prison matron who has helped Velma hire famed lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).With the help of her husband Amos (John C. Reilly) who pays the $5,000 fee, Roxie is able to obtain the services of Flynn and seizes the fickle tabloid headlines from Velma.  Roxie and Velma's battle for fame and freedom is soon underway.  Will the two regain their freedom and maintain the spotlight or will fate deal them a different hand?""Chicago"" has been a Broadway hit for a number of years and I have to admit I wasn't sure how the movie was going to turn out.  But, this fast paced adaptation was better than I expected. Each member of the cast shines with his and/or her talent and enthusiasm, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah.  Each actress has her own unique background (Catherine Zeta-Jones was at one time a professional dancer while Queen Latifah has had success as a musician.) Both were nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar with Zeta-Jones eventually winning the honor.Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly also deserve kudos for their roles.  While Reilly has had some experience in musicals, Zellweger and Gere had to learn dance and singing routines from scratch.The musical sequences were shot mainly from the perspective of Roxie's imagination.  Each routine was packed with energy and excitement including one notable number by Zellweger and Gere where Roxie was portrayed as a puppet during Flynn's ventriloquist act.  Zeta-Jones' performance of ""Cell Block Tango"", Queen Latifah's song ""When You're Good To Mama"" and Reilly's ""Mister Cellophane"" were also exceptional.""Chicago"" offers something a little different than most movies out these days.

605671,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JLSE,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[7, 12]","Adapted from the successfully revived hit musical that has been doing the rounds on Broadway and London's West End, Chicago is the cinematic directorial debut of stage director and choreographer Rob Marshall. Chicago is on the whole a dark affair, akin somewhat to both Cabaret and Bugsy Malone. It stars Renee Zellwegger as the `heroine' Roxie Hart, who shoots her no good lover dead when he decides to dump her. Arrested and sent to jail she meets up with fellow killer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones), a former nightclub chanteusse that gunned down both her husband and sister after catching them in a romantic clinch. Velma, initially has no interest in poor old naive Roxie because due to her celebrity lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the prison warder (Queen Latifah) she's a bigger celebrity in prison than she ever was out of prison. That is until Roxie starts to steal her thunder.Hollywood has a long established tradition of making musical movies, indeed the first Oscars best picture winner of the sound era, in 1929, was The Broadway Melody. Until the 1970's when musicals became strangely unfashionable musicals continued to pick up those famous golden statuettes regularly, with the likes of Gigi, West Side Story, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music picking up Best Picture Oscars between 1959 and 1965. It wasn't until 2001's Moulin Rouge that the musical was resurrected and readopted as a viable and popular movie genre. Chicago has been nominated for a whopping 13 Oscars with at least one nomination in every major category, with the exception of Best Actor. It also won three major Golden Globe Awards, Best Picture and Best Actor and Actress in a musical or comedy for its stars, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger.With all the Golden Globes and Oscar hype you might expect that the movie adaptation of Chicago would be something special. However, enjoyable as Chicago undoubtedly is, it is certainly not in the league of any of the previously mentioned screen musicals. Don't get me wrong, Chicago is a good movie, an enjoyable movie and an entertaining movie. It boasts some decent performances too, particularly from the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones and the formidable presence that is Queen Latifah. Richard Gere has some nice moments too and is appropriately slick as lawyer Billy Flynn, manipulating the media and tap dancing his way out of many a tight spot. He has one of the best numbers in the whole show (Razzle Dazzle) and with his background of stage musicals, earlier in his career, was perfectly cast. John C. Reilly nominated in this years Oscars for best supporting actor is both appropriately sad and gullible in equal measures, as Roxie's poor sap of a husband, Amos. ReneeZellweger's performance is also good but not a patch on her turns in Nurse Betty, Bridget Jones's Diary, or Jerry Maguire. Undoubtedly she gives a good performance and is a likeable heroine but next to the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones her lack of a musical background is evident.Chicago is a very difficult show to open out cinematically, with much of the action being set in a prison.  Nearly all of the scenes in Chicago betray its stage origins with little expansion of the action out-with a traditional theatrical format. Even with the device of cutting between the reality and the musical fantasies in Roxie's head, Chicago looks like it was all filmed on a sound stage, which of course it was. It therefore seems strangely unbelievable that Rob Marshall has been nominated as Best Director in this years Academy awards when Baz Luhrmann was excluded from last years nominations. Love it or loathe it Moulin Rouge was surely a far more original, innovative and technically more impressive film than the rather formulaic staginess of Chicago. However, what the movie lacks in innovation it makes up for with its classic musical numbers, such as `All That Jazz', `Mr Cellophane' and the previously mentioned `Razzle Dazzle'.In summary, if you are a fan of stage musicals and cant afford to get to Broadway or London's West End then this is certainly worth the price of a movie ticket and far cheaper too. It boasts a great cast that you'll certainly never see on stage together but you'll miss out on that unique live experience. The choice is yours and in the words of Amos Hart `thanks for listening'.",3,*** RAZZLE DAZZLE: 3.5 STARS ***,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,4330,"['Adapted', 'successfully', 'revived', 'hit', 'musical', 'been', 'doing', 'rounds', 'Broadway', 'London', 'West', 'End', 'Chicago', 'cinematic', 'directorial', 'debut', 'stage', 'director', 'choreographer', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'Chicago', 'whole', 'dark', 'affair', 'akin', 'somewhat', 'Cabaret', 'Bugsy', 'Malone', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'heroine', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'who', 'shoots', 'no', 'good', 'lover', 'dead', 'when', 'dump', 'Arrested', 'sent', 'jail', 'up', 'fellow', 'killer', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'former', 'nightclub', 'chanteusse', 'gunned', 'down', 'husband', 'sister', 'catching', 'romantic', 'clinch', 'Velma', 'initially', 'interest', 'poor', 'old', 'naive', 'Roxie', 'due', 'celebrity', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'prison', 'warder', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'bigger', 'celebrity', 'prison', 'ever', 'was', 'prison', 'Roxie', 'steal', 'thunder.Hollywood', 'long', 'established', 'tradition', 'making', 'musical', 'movies', 'indeed', 'first', 'Oscars', 'best', 'picture', 'winner', 'sound', 'era', '1929', 'was', 'Broadway', 'Melody', '1970', 'when', 'musicals', 'became', 'strangely', 'unfashionable', 'musicals', 'continued', 'pick', 'up', 'famous', 'golden', 'statuettes', 'regularly', 'likes', 'Gigi', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Sound', 'Music', 'picking', 'up', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars', '1959', '1965', 'was', ""n't"", '2001', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'musical', 'was', 'resurrected', 'readopted', 'viable', 'popular', 'movie', 'genre', 'Chicago', 'been', 'nominated', 'whopping', '13', 'Oscars', 'least', 'one', 'nomination', 'major', 'category', 'exception', 'Best', 'Actor', 'also', 'won', 'three', 'major', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'musical', 'comedy', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Renee', 'Zellweger.With', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Oscar', 'hype', 'might', 'expect', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Chicago', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'However', 'enjoyable', 'Chicago', 'undoubtedly', 'certainly', 'not', 'league', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'screen', 'musicals', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Chicago', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'decent', 'performances', 'too', 'particularly', 'likes', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'formidable', 'presence', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'nice', 'moments', 'too', 'appropriately', 'slick', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'manipulating', 'media', 'tap', 'dancing', 'way', 'many', 'tight', 'spot', 'one', 'best', 'numbers', 'whole', 'show', 'Razzle', 'Dazzle', 'background', 'stage', 'musicals', 'earlier', 'career', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'nominated', 'years', 'Oscars', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'appropriately', 'sad', 'gullible', 'equal', 'measures', 'Roxie', 'poor', 'sap', 'husband', 'Amos', 'ReneeZellweger', 'performance', 'also', 'good', 'not', 'patch', 'turns', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Undoubtedly', 'good', 'performance', 'likeable', 'heroine', 'next', 'likes', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'lack', 'musical', 'background', 'evident.Chicago', 'very', 'difficult', 'show', 'open', 'out', 'cinematically', 'much', 'action', 'being', 'set', 'prison', 'Nearly', 'scenes', 'Chicago', 'betray', 'stage', 'origins', 'little', 'expansion', 'action', 'out-with', 'traditional', 'theatrical', 'format', 'Even', 'device', 'cutting', 'reality', 'musical', 'fantasies', 'Roxie', 'head', 'Chicago', 'was', 'filmed', 'sound', 'stage', 'course', 'was', 'therefore', 'strangely', 'unbelievable', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'years', 'Academy', 'awards', 'when', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'was', 'excluded', 'last', 'years', 'nominations', 'Love', 'loathe', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'was', 'surely', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'innovative', 'technically', 'more', 'impressive', 'film', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'staginess', 'Chicago', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'innovation', 'up', 'classic', 'musical', 'numbers', 'such', 'Jazz', 'Mr', 'Cellophane', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Razzle', ""Dazzle'.In"", 'summary', 'are', 'fan', 'stage', 'musicals', 'cant', 'afford', 'get', 'Broadway', 'London', 'West', 'End', 'then', 'certainly', 'worth', 'price', 'movie', 'ticket', 'far', 'cheaper', 'too', 'great', 'cast', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'never', 'see', 'stage', 'together', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', 'unique', 'live', 'experience', 'choice', 'yours', 'words', 'Amos', 'Hart', 'thanks', 'listening']",Chicago

Some reviews say it is terrible!  Some are lukewarm... Some say it is great...I think there are people that hate musicals, and then they write a review about a great musical and slash it to pieces. I know people who hate Beethoven and hate Mozart, and I have to dismiss as irrelevant a review about the 9th Symphony written by somebody who hates classical music.So, writing about musicals, I can only believe somebody who loves musicals... and of course, that somebody is ME!  I love musicals.  I am my best musical critic, for me, because I really KNOW musicals!  I know which musicals I didn't like so much (Miss Saigon, Candide...) and which musicals I loved (Phantom of the Opera, My Fair Lady, Beauty and the Beast, King and I, Man of La Mancha, Fiddler on the Roof... Joseph...).  I have seen everything great, ten times or more, including The King and I, Man of La Mancha, Cats, Fiddler on the Roof, Evita, etc.... even Show Boat, The Mikado, Pirates of Penzance, Mary Poppins, etc....I mean... I REALLY KNOW and LOVE MUSICALS!  That having been said...After having seen Chicago on a big screen 3 or 4  times, maybe more... the verdict is: Chicago is Fabulous!  It is right up there with the best of them.  The songs are great, catchy, really excellent... The dancing is great, the singing is great, the coreography is beautiful... The actors are superb... Queen Latiffa, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are all so PERFECT for their parts... Catherine Zeta Jones won an Oscar for her role, and Richard Gere deserved to win an Oscar for his role (but he wins a long applause, from me.)  He actually SINGS his own songs. He is PERFECT for the part.And Catherine Zeta Jones... Wow!  SHE IS WONDERFUL!  Not only is she BEAUTIFUL, but she is TALENTED!  She REALLY DANCES... not just dances, she transcends into Jazz!  I was hooked on the music of Chicago for weeks...I love the tunes, the coreography... I love Chicago... it is without a doubt in the same league as the best musicals ever... by that I mean it is in the same league as the best of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan,  Andrew Lloyd Weber, etc.And now I write this for others: Buy this DVD!  This is really a bargain.  You only pay for it once, and you will have it and be able to see it many times and enjoy it for the rest of your life.P.S.: I bought the DVD...

Yes,once upon a time, you could purchase the book with lyrics! and when the early 1980's came along, there was talk about doing the Chicago play into a movie that would have starred Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn. I wish I knew why that movie never transpired, but If it had been made, then this current Chicago movie would have been a very successful remake! Boy, how I wish the Minnelli/Hawn version had gone through! Even though I cannnot sing or dance, I can still sing, dance and talk all the parts. After all, I've been doing so since 1975!

On-screen the plot is too flimsy, the dialogue and action too campy even for one who usually loves camp, i.e. me. Dancing was fine, the direction & effects were truly impressive, singing was good, songs were good. But no more than good. Not great. And after seeing it, I had no desire to ever see it again or to hum any of the songs. It was imminently forgettable. This film seems to be more about showcasing the hidden musical/dancing talents of actors known solely for acting than about a plausible story. The wit is superficial at best, and the moral of the story is a real yawner (if you even think there is one). If this is supposed to be the movie that brings back musicals, I think I'll just rerun some of the old classics instead. I dunno, I always think the Oscar winner for best picture should be one that will stand the test of time, e.g. Casablanca, The Sting, etc. I really don't think this movie can do that. All that aside, kudos to the one real singing talent I did see: Queen Latifah's acting may have been a trifle wooden but on stage she stole the entire movie with the one song she had.

Set during the rum running twenties, the plot loosely follows to murderesses (Catherine Zeta Jones-Douglas and Rene Zellweger) who are awaiting their fate on death row.  Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.  Electrifying musical numbers rock this rather flat story and bump up the action a well deserved notch - but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!Mirimax's DVD won't be winning any awards.  Colors are well balanced but flesh tones are overly pinkish and flat.  Fine details are lost in the darker scenes, even when viewing the movie in a completely blackened room.  Edge enhancement and aliasing crop up now and then, though nothing that will terribly distract.  Film grain is a real problem - certain scenes are smooth as silk while others look as though they are at least twenty years old. (Herein I am not making references to the stylistic aged look employed during certain segments of the movie but various shots within a particular scene that veer wildly between generally smooth to excessively grainy.  Check out Zeta Jone's &quot;All That Jazz&quot; number that opens the film. When Rene Zellweger intrudes with her own bar and chorus, the background information in the shot is suddenly riddled with grit, grain and a digital harshness.)  Not a terrible mastering effort - just not an exemplary one and for a BEST PICTURE WINNER of one year vintage, entirely unacceptable.  The audio is 5.1 and DTS but neither are particularly distinguished though both offer an aggressive bass and some kick during the musical numbers.EXTRAS:A deleted song, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.BOTTOM LINE: I would have at least expected a &quot;making of&quot; for this movie but I suppose Miramax is holding that back for a special &quot;deluxe&quot; edition sure to be out before Christmas.

But not to worry, she hooks up with another celebrity-murderer for a sisters-in-crime act.  Some of the songs are excellent -- even Richard Gere shows that he can belt them out -- there is some clever cross-cutting between plot events and cabaret acts, and we are spared the traditional, offensive boy-girl romance.  However, the transition from stage to film is somewhat inept: the story takes place almost entirely in dingy backstage rooms and on a claustrophobically confining prison set. I wanted exteriors of gin joints, tenements, and society mansions.I also became increasingly uncomfortable with the dozens -- maybe hundreds -- of women writhing against each other in leather bikinis.

And allow me to add ""this whole movie"" to that sentence I just quoted. In a non-derogatory manner, by the way, because ""Chicago"" is show business from beginning to end and that's its very soul.In this case, if you are a woman and want to make the front page of the newspapers, the best way seems to be killing your husband, getting caught by the cops and getting Flynn to take over your case in court. That and $5,000. The rest is, as they say, history. And rightly so because you'll go down as quickly as you went up, as soon as the girl next door does the same thing you did. Because it's Chicago, and ""you can't beat fresh blood on the walls"", as Flynn tells Roxie (Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger), the new kid on the block as she finds out her fifteen minutes of fame have ran out.My advice is that you don't go see ""Chicago"" looking for a whodunnit kind of thriller involving cabarets and stage dancers. Instead, if ""Moulin Rouge"" bringing the musical genre back to the spotlight pleased you, this one is also definitely for your liking. I'm no expert in this kind of movie (it's not even my cup of tea) and so I have a hard time figuring out whether what we have here is story interrupted by songs or songs interrupted by story.That duality brings an interesting quality to the film, though. Whereas the songs are full of color and splendor in good Broadway tradition, the rest is shown in bleak tones, suiting 1930's Chicago. The story however is never to be taken seriously, but always lightly. It makes sense but it is also goofy in a way.The acting is all great and it's no wonder because a) they're all accomplished actors and b) most have stage formation and experience. Zeta-Jones is especially hot and on the spot as Velma Kelly, as her past as a professional dancer in London really shows. I just don't know if this performance is Oscar worthy but then again that's a tricky business. Scorsese must be thinking the same thing after his ""Gangs of New York"" was put out to dry...",4,"If it's Chicago, it's not a crime",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2239,"['trial', 'whole', 'world', 'show', 'business', 'So', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'hot-shot', 'Chicago', 'attorney', 'who', 'living', 'saving', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'happen', 'have', 'killed', 'someone', 'getting', 'rope', 'beautiful', 'necks', 'allow', 'add', 'whole', 'movie', 'sentence', 'just', 'quoted', 'non-derogatory', 'manner', 'way', 'Chicago', 'show', 'business', 'beginning', 'end', 'very', 'soul.In', 'case', 'are', 'woman', 'want', 'make', 'front', 'page', 'newspapers', 'best', 'way', 'be', 'killing', 'husband', 'getting', 'caught', 'cops', 'getting', 'Flynn', 'take', 'over', 'case', 'court', '5,000', 'rest', 'say', 'history', 'rightly', 'so', ""'ll"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'quickly', 'went', 'up', 'as', 'soon', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'Chicago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'fresh', 'blood', 'walls', 'Flynn', 'Roxie', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellwegger', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'out', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'have', 'ran', 'out.My', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'Chicago', 'looking', 'whodunnit', 'kind', 'thriller', 'involving', 'cabarets', 'stage', 'dancers', 'Instead', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'bringing', 'musical', 'genre', 'back', 'spotlight', 'pleased', 'one', 'also', 'definitely', 'liking', ""'m"", 'expert', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'cup', 'tea', 'so', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'story', 'interrupted', 'songs', 'songs', 'interrupted', 'story.That', 'duality', 'interesting', 'quality', 'film', 'though', 'songs', 'are', 'full', 'color', 'splendor', 'good', 'Broadway', 'tradition', 'rest', 'shown', 'bleak', 'tones', 'suiting', '1930', 'Chicago', 'story', 'however', 'never', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'always', 'lightly', 'sense', 'also', 'goofy', 'way.The', 'acting', 'great', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'accomplished', 'actors', 'b', 'most', 'have', 'stage', 'formation', 'experience', 'Zeta-Jones', 'especially', 'hot', 'spot', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'past', 'professional', 'dancer', 'London', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'then', 'again', 'tricky', 'business', 'Scorsese', 'must', 'be', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'dry']",Chicago

Catherine Zeta-Jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.  Her background in musical showed through.  Her experience and her confidence oozed through & thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.  Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.  However, her presence was so relevant to the twenties.  Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.  What made their performances even more admirable was that all of them sang and danced through ""Chicago"" and they were all amateurs before this.  The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.  Whilst the razzle dazzle was impressive, the movie had a serious undertone, the analysis of the change of America's society.

And i have to say, i was highly impressed. This film more then won me over, it was one of those movies that, after seeing it once, i knew i would have to buy and add to my collection.The story is pretty simple. Roxy Hart dreams of becoming a star. And when she is used and tossed aside by someone who swore they would help her make her dream come true, she ends up in jail for killing them. Her way of handling difficult situations, is to transport herself, and those around her, into these elaborate musical numbers. And these musical interludes don't slow the actual story down at all, as is the case in some more recent attempts at movie-musicals...they in fact are without a doubt, the highlights of this movie. The actors more then shine in their respective roles...especially Zellweger, who until this movie, has done nothing but grate on my nerves. Here she makes the character of Roxy her own, and lights up the screen. In fact, the casting is just about perfect...with each person giving an incredible performance.&quot;Chicago&quot; is one of those extremely rare films, that's hard to find anything to complain about.

A movie musical that actually gives you the same leaving-the-theater-euphoria usually only experienced at live shows. I love the Broadway version of CHICAGO and was so incredibly pleasantly suprised when I went to see the movie (with some theater friends) and ADORED it (so did the theater friends!).This is one of the few movie musicals that actually translates well on-screen. It is what CABARET only wished it could be. The raw, palpitating energy is phenomenal. And, they gave a nod to the Great White Way by including Dedriee Goodwin and Chita Rivera in the cast list-- bravo!Renee Zellweger CAN sing AND dance! Very impressive. Her singing voice is lovely...very earthy and expressive. Her dancing matches Catherine Zeta-Jones' and her acting is superb. What a relief! Her Roxie is reminiscent of Marylin Monroe, but it is very effective.Of course, Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexy as usual. And we knew she could sing and dance, because, well, that's how she got her start. It is cool to see her finally get to use it on screen.Richard Gere: well. He is good. I was very happy with his tap dancing. And, well, he plays the cocky attorney flawlessly. But his singing is, er, a bit shaky. I was amazed at his high notes--quite pure and on-key. He's just very nasal. Probably because he's untrained, but it just bothered me a little. I longed for Jerry Orbach.Watch for the Cell Block Tango-- it's breathtaking! And Queen Latifah is really a kick-butt Mama Morton.(Why did they never think of a soulful Mama for the stage version beats me-- she rocked!)The only songs I missed were ""Class"" and ""A Little Bit of Good In Everyone"" (Mary Sunshine was highly miscast, but oh well.)Words cannot describe this one. Go see it, and see it in theaters. It's worth every penny.

When she kills her lover in a fit of rage, she doesn't realize how close she's about to become to her dream.  In prison, she hooks up with lawyer Billy Flynn, and another singer in prison, Velma Kelly.  Watching Velma work Billy and getting her name in the paper is all Roxie needs.  She lures her husband into supporting her legal problems and hires Billy to be her attorney.  Before she knows it, Roxie is more famous then she ever dreamed she'd become.  Intersped with musical numbers that help tell the story, Chicago is a satire about the control the media holds over it's audience.If you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not, you will truly enjoy the musical numbers in Chicago.  They have a twenties theme and are worked very well into the context of the story.  The performances are outstanding, with my personal favorite being Richard Gere as Flynn.  This was definitely an underated performance.  One flaw with the film is it's lack of likeable characters.  Roxie is hardly likeable in the ways she treats her husband, and what she will do to be famous.  Velma is an arrogant woman who sees herself in a higher light then everyone else.  Billy is a lawyer who only cares about the bottom line.  And, Roxie's husband Amos, probably the most sympathetic, is also a fool, making him hard to like.The DVD is a little bare as far as DVD's go.  Only three extras to speak of, an informative behind-the-scenes documentary which runs 30 minutes, a director's commentary, and a four-minute musical number with Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones which was cut.

605712,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JLSE,"""qmlhcb""","[1, 2]","Reviving the musical with a bang, Chicago brings back the fun of the all but lost genre.Its simple story satirizing the judicial system and media through a pair of man-murdering women allows the film to flaunt the main intent of musicals: Singing and dancing. The cast is great in their showy performances, especially John C. Reilly in an Oscar nominated supporting role as Roxie's (Renee Zellewager) husband (Reilly though, in my opinion, is the only one really worthy of the golden statue).The numbers all have electricity sizzling through them, especially a number with Roxie and her lawyer (Richard Gere) doing a ventriloquist act mocking the attorney/client relationship, and Reilly's lonely and heart felt ""Mr. Cellophane."" The film feels elaborate even though the musical numbers are all on stripped down sets. The simple environments help put focus on the numbers and not on extravagant sets. It is a nice departure from the usual, and fits the film's jazz era.Still, for all the good the stripped down story does for the performances, the film seems to lack a certain depth Oscar-winning films usually have. Despite of how wonderful and enjoyable the film is, I don't feel it's quite worthy of best picture, but that probably won't stop the academy from declaring it so (though I feel The Pianist or The Hours is more worthy of the distinction).

As I heard the results from the Academy Awards, that Chicago had received 6 awards, I simply knew that it would be the best movie of the year.  So, I rented it with great expectations of a movie with emotional actors, glorious dance and singing scenes, beautiful cinematography, and all done with a witty humorous dialogue in a well written, original, breathtaking movie with noteworthy moral value.I was expecting something spectacular.  Instead I viewed a movie that was rushed, unmoving, lame, with standard acting, standard singing and dancing, standard acting, all performing to a song we've all hear before.  It is your same old typical movie.Actually, the music was less than standard, with actors that can't sing, or dance, repeating the bad lyrics over and over again created by an obviously talentless insipid lyricist.  I at least expected it to be a visionary marvelous beauty, but in turn it had dull red colors, an old 70's movie atmosphere, with a limited array of dismal colors and didn't sparkle as I had expected.Musicals usually aren't suppose to be dramatic, but this movie intentionally accomplished this, but when the actually music in the musical is bad, what is left to the movie?  In my opinion this movie was boring, and I actually fell asleep on it, actually, and missed nothing.  The actors didn't have chemistry together, nor did the director concentrate on interaction between the women of the prision.  Characters are introduced, and fade as they preform to the horrible ranting music.It wasn't very fun, due to the fact that the characters were mindless bimbo female murderers and an arrogant cheating lead actor lawyer that causes a rotten woman to run free, and star in a musical afterwards.  I know this was suppose to just be a fun movie, but it wasn't because the acting and music was so bad.  In this case the movie `Glitter' should have received as much raves.  It simply is not that good.  Now I know that the Academy Awards aren't an accurate rating system.

I had presumed that it would be a lot like ""Cabaret"" with musical numbers centered in a night club with a story that takes place outside of the night club.  I was surprized to discover that the musical numbers popped up all through the movie irregardless of the location.  When I saw a choreographied song and dance emerge in the county jail, I knew that this was a different musical than what I had expected.  Once I adjusted my perceptions, I found this a very enjoyable movie.  There is much to applaud in ""Chicago"" beginning with the acting.  My daughter told me she read that everyone did their own singing which surprized me.  I had not thought of Richard Gere as a song and dance man but he did a very credible job.  All of the numbers were great even though there were a lot of ""amateurs"" singing.  I don't want to short change the singers but I think the real greatness to the numbers comes from the choreography, the directing, the costumes, the music and how well the songs fit right into the story.  Indeed, most of the songs amplified the story.  As a matter of fact, I'm not sure this would have been much of a movie without the music (although that's true about most musicals).  But with the music, it is a great tale of manipulation of public opinion.

An adaption of a the Broadway musical, director Rob Marshall blends together the straightforward adaptions of old, with the surreal, in-your-face production of Moulin Rouge!  The result is amazing.  The ""dream sequence"" technique allows the narrative to take place in real life yet still allow for exciting music numbers.The performances are similarly wonderful.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah, and even Richard Gere all sing and dance wonderfully.  It's great to see actors who don't normally sing and dance be pushed to the edge of their talents.  While there could have been a few improvements, it was overall a great production.  Add that with Bill Fosse's old wonderful coreography and some excellent and creative set design, and Chicago makes a great movie.But a not so great DVD.

Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[3, 4]","The last two reviews of this film were as subjective as reviews could possibly be but what they lack is the ability to step back and actually look at what they've reviewed. This film is about immoral people but that doesn't change it's punch and it's honesty as both a musical and morality play skewed toward the cynical way we Americans view fame. As musicals go this is not Singing in the Rain or South Pacific, but it does have heart, guts and good musical talent just as the latter musicals had even if not in the same context. I find myself rooting for the little murderesses and not because I want them to get away with their crimes but to admire their spunk, guile and tenacity. On top of that who's worse; the ladies using the media or the public who allows, and gullibly applauds this manipulation? This film makes no effort to forgive the gals of their crimes, nor does the story try to make them out to be misguided little girls who deserve a shot at redemption. The sleazy lawyer who works to get them off the hook is also no nobleman. He's a vile but witty cad who exploits every trick in the book (as well as creating a few new ones) to defend the ladies. Couple that with the nearly flawless portrayals of the characters and their near perfect dance routines and I have to highly recommend this genuine musical. Renee' Zellweger is a treat as the seemingly naive minx aspiring to stardom and stupid enough to put herself within reach of the state's gallows. Catherine Zeta Jones as the very jaded, chain smoking Velma is wonderfully nasty but also no slouch when it comes to getting her way (learning a little humility along the way). At the heart of these two characters are women who've come to believe that fame and wealth are the only goals worth attaining. Their lawyer feels exactly the sme way in his shameless pursuit of difficult but very high profile, and very profitable cases. Richard Gere is a strange selection for the portrayal of this fellow. However, his skills were considerably better than I'd hoped and I found him not only convincing but downright engrossing as he wore this cretin's skin.The dance numbers clearly owe a nod to the master Bob Fosse who first adapted this story for the stage years ago.Fosse's urban cynicism oozes from these songs and dance numbers. Jones and Zellwegger are very good in their numbers. They're sincere efforts but not flawless. Despite that I found those efforts to be better than routine. They truly put themselves into their roles and played their characters with gusto.Character flaws fully exposed and elaborated on I still admired the spirit of these scoundrels if not the scoundrels themselves, well, maybe I have to confess to being a little taken with the bold lot of them. Queen Latifa (sp?) was another treat fully in her character and sumptuous in her performance. She conveyed such ease with her character it was like watching a person in a long running series, fully confortable with her role after years of playing it.Now, is this a great film musical? No, but it certainly is enjoyable and a far cry from what's been passing for musicals in recent years. Catchy tunes, good dancing and an engaging story and an inherent wit makes this much more than watchable. On top of that it has a surprising cast in the lead players as well as support characters. John C. Reilly's character as the poor slob married to Zellwegger's treacherous gal is another treat. He's the guy nobody sees, almost literally. He takes this one poor sap and plays him as the only guy with a conscience (though manipulated as it is) in this miasma of schemers and scammers. He's sincere, hopeful, but ultimately doomed to be background clutter. He's used when he's needed, ignored when he's not, and this fact becomes painfully evident to him as the film progresses.

Obviously the film has been thoroughly &quot;conceptualized&quot; as a sort of &quot;Cabaret&quot; clone, with the cabaret nuymbers transformed into theatrical metaphors (Mr. Cellophane as a baggypants comedian, for example).  Along these lines, the producers decided to hire actors rather than musicians in the key roles, and that's the chief limitation of the film.  Neither of the two main leads can sing much or dance at all, so basically they wiggle and strike a few poses while the camera does all the dancing.  This is disastrous in &quot;I Can't Do IT Alone,&quot; (&quot;it&quot; being her song and dance act with her sister)  where it's obvious that the performer can't do it at all.  Nor does the final number, where the two women are supposed to do their new song and dance act, make any sense since neither of them can sing or dance.  Other actors fare equally poorly.  Queen Latifah is simply miscast as the prison matron.  Her persona and singing style are much too soft and &quot;matronly&quot; (in the wrong sense) for such a &quot;tough as nails broad.&quot;  I can't believe she could have ever gotten control of the inmates.  Even the great John C. Reilly seems uncomfortable in the ill-conceived (Mr. Cellophane is supposed to be anonymous, not abrasive like a baggypants comic) number.  He seems to be asking himself why they didn't hire a real singer for the role.Don't get me wrong, though.  Many numbers are brilliant (the &quot;legal ventriloquism&quot; number for example), and the show remains extremely entertaining.  But ultimately the movie seems to show that the only way you can get the public to swallow a musical is to make it look like an expanded MTV video.",4,"very entertaining, but . . .",1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,1865,"['Anyone', 'who', 'film', 'will', 'spend', 'two', 'very', 'entertaining', 'hours', 'have', 'admit', 'certain', 'amounbt', 'disappointmnt', 'particularly', 'as', 'compared', 'stage', 'play', 'Obviously', 'film', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'quot', 'conceptualized', 'quot', 'sort', 'quot', 'Cabaret', 'quot', 'clone', 'cabaret', 'nuymbers', 'transformed', 'theatrical', 'metaphors', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'baggypants', 'comedian', 'example', 'lines', 'producers', 'decided', 'hire', 'actors', 'rather', 'musicians', 'key', 'roles', 'chief', 'limitation', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'can', 'sing', 'much', 'dance', 'so', 'basically', 'wiggle', 'strike', 'few', 'poses', 'camera', 'dancing', 'disastrous', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Do', 'IT', 'Alone', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'being', 'song', 'dance', 'act', 'sister', 'where', 'obvious', 'performer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'final', 'number', 'where', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'new', 'song', 'dance', 'act', 'make', 'sense', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'Other', 'actors', 'fare', 'equally', 'poorly', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'simply', 'miscast', 'prison', 'matron', 'persona', 'singing', 'style', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'soft', 'quot', 'matronly', 'quot', 'wrong', 'sense', 'quot', 'tough', 'nails', 'broad.', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'gotten', 'control', 'inmates', 'Even', 'great', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'uncomfortable', 'ill-conceived', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'supposed', 'be', 'anonymous', 'not', 'abrasive', 'baggypants', 'comic', 'number', 'be', 'asking', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'hire', 'real', 'singer', 'role.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'though', 'Many', 'numbers', 'are', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'legal', 'ventriloquism', 'quot', 'number', 'example', 'show', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'show', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'public', 'swallow', 'musical', 'make', 'look', 'expanded', 'MTV', 'video']",Chicago

There are a pair of knock-out performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah (who knew she had that good a voice?), plus an excellent one from John C. Reilly as Amos. Rob Marshall's direction is a bit too MTV for me; it's as if he's trying to cover up his cast's song-and-dance inadequacies when, at least in the case of Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly, there don't appear to be any inadequacies to cover up. Even Richard Gere seems competent in his tap sequence when Marshall isn't going cut-mad. The main problem is Zellweger. She doesn't register at all, and truly does seem to need her inadequacies disguised by MTV editing. The one time she really dances is in the last number and that's where some of the fastest edits are; maybe she was only good for 2-3 seconds at a time. As for Gere, he was better than I expected but not what the part could have been. I may have that opinion because I saw the original Broadway cast, and got spoiled. Their Billy Flynn was Jerry Orbach (yes, &quot;Law and Order&quot; Jerry Orbach), and, to me, no one will ever do it as well. In short, this is a good picture, but it would have been better with less frantic editing and a better lead actress then Zellweger.

605725,A3S75QQLGAOOAO,B00005JLSE,Rick Darby,"[2, 7]","I'm afraid I have to dissent somewhat from the gushing reviews preceding this.Certainly, there's plenty to admire in Chicago. The song-and-dance numbers are staged with verve and imagination. You get Kander and Ebb's good, though not great, score. (The sound recording has marvelous presence, especially if you have the equipment to play back the DTS version.)You get one and a half superlative performances in the lead roles. Who ever would have thought Catherine Zeta-Jones had it in her to be a mesmerizing singer and dancer? A very pleasing revelation.Renee Zellweger continually brings up a conflict for me: she's adorable, obviously talented ... and seems to need very little encouragement to over-torque every expression and gesture. I'm sure Rob Marshall encouraged her to play broadly, in keeping with his own directorial style, and the net effect is just too much of a caricature. But she, too, is a knockout in the musical and terpsichorean department. The big climactic scene when Zeta-Jones and Zellweger perform a duet is the most electrifying thing of its kind I've ever seen.So why don't I give Chicago a rave?First, there is the preening, simpering embarrasment that is Richard Gere, who has ruined more movies than I care to remember. He can't ruin this one, but it's a close call. Again, I'm sure the director didn't ask him for subtlety, but even farce takes some discipline. (Some would say it takes more discipline than any other form of acting.) Gere is such a clumsy actor that he's painful to watch. Maybe the ladies (or guys, if so inclined) who think he's dishy won't care.But the overall problem, for me, is a matter of tone. It's set in the '20s, but nothing about it (especially the dialogue) authentically evokes the time, or, I suspect, the place.Worse, the film is so relentlessly cynical and mean-spirited that, even when it's impressive, you can't shake off the feeling that the drink has been spiked with something poisonous. Chicago just keeps punching you out, showing you what a sucker you are for caring for any of these people, or for anyone in the world.Musicals don't have to be lollipops, and some of the best have darker shadings. Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! mixes serious emotions with its flamboyant music and choreographic artistry, for instance.

605729,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JLSE,Robert Morris,"[1, 1]","This film deserves all of the praise it receives, especially given the fact that it is derived from a Broadway musical (1973) which was, in turn, derived from two non-musical films, Chicago (1927) and Roxie Hart (1943). I can think of few other works of high quality which have such a heritage. (Can you name five film sequels which are superior to the original?) Crisply directed by Rob Marshall with choreography devised by Bob Fosse, this film operates simultaneously (and seamlessly) on two different levels of narrative: a murder trial which requires the main characters to act and a musical revue which requires them to sing and dance. Thus, the film has a multi-dimensional ""choreography"" for which Marshall deserves special credit. Frankly, I was surprised by Gere's performance, especially by his footwork both when dancing and while defending Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger) in the courtroom. In my opinion, he deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. Among the targets of the film's social comments are the role of media in celebrity creation, how an adroit attorney such as Billy Flynn can manipulate the media to his clients' advantage, and how transient celebrity can be. Long ago, I recall my grandmother suggesting that ""Today's news wraps tomorrow's fish."" In all respects, this is a film with Snap! Crackle! and Pop!

605736,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLSE,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 14]","A lot of good ingredients have gone into the making of this long-delayed movie version of the hit Broadway musical ""Chicago,"" but the film, as a whole, fails to overcome some of the basic weaknesses inherent in the source material.  Like virtually all musicals of recent vintage (just about anything post-""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Grease,"" I would say), ""Chicago"" adheres to the proposition that audiences will no longer accept the conceit of live action characters suddenly bursting into song in the middle of straightforward prose passages (audiences, for some reason, seem to have less of a problem when animated figures do this).  As a result, all the musical numbers in this piece - and there are many - occur in the form of stage acts that parallel the major events of the narrative.  One has to admire the way in which screenwriter Bill Condon, working off the Fred Ebb/Bob Fosse original, is able to knit together these two disparate realms of action into a unified, seamless whole - thanks, in no small measure, to the cleverness and adroitness of director Rob Marshall and editor Martin Walsh, who have clearly thrown all their skill, talent and energy (and then some) into this particular project.The problem is that the material itself is not really all that compelling.  The plot, sort of a cross between Chandleresque pulp fiction and Fosse's own ""Cabaret,"" serves as little more than an excuse to hang the musical numbers on.  The story involves two women - one an established vaudevillian and the other a wannabe star looking for her first big break - who find themselves behind bars for the murder of two men.  Roxie Hart is the film's centerpiece, a mediocre talent who hopes to use the scandal her crime has created as her ticket to fame and fortune on the stage.  But Roxie soon learns that fame in 1920's Chicago can be fleeting, and that the melodrama-craving public that couldn't get enough of you last week can drop you like old news this week the moment a juicier scandal comes along.  The script has some fun parodying this aspect of tabloid obsession and madness, but the film feels so much like a live-action cartoon at times that any hope of our becoming involved in any of the characters' predicaments and fates is virtually eliminated.  ""Chicago"" is ""clever,"" it's true, almost too clever for its own good, and, with its characters ultimtately reduced to caricatures, it begins, finally, to reek of artifice.  One wishes that the film were not so all-fired determined to distance us from the action, not so afraid of appearing ""old fashioned"" and ""square"" by actually allowing us to care about the characters.  In fact, the most intriguing part of the film is the court scene near the end, when the drama is allowed to play itself out a bit without recourse to all the highfalutin, show stopping numbers.  It may seem like blasphemy to wish that a musical would curtail its song-and-dance moments a bit and provide a few more scenes of straight drama, but certainly plenty of great musicals have done just that in the past (then again, they actually had books worth constructing a musical around).Technically, the film is very impressive.  The musical numbers have been mounted with a great deal of imagination, energy and technical expertise, although the editing occasionally intrudes into and thereby diminishes some of Fosse's brilliantly worked-out dance routines.  Still, taken separately, each number stands as a mini story on its own, and the cutting does keep the energy level high in purely cinematic terms.  The songs by Kander and Ebb, though not particularly melodic or catchy, do serve the material well, being both lyrically clever and relentlessly high-spirited.Of the performers, Renee Zellweger steals the show as Roxie, conveying both the befuddled vulnerability and ruthless drive that define the character.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking for all the world like Natalie Wood in ""Gypsy,"" exudes a real slinky sexiness as Velma Kelly, the stop-at-nothing rival who has to defend her throne against this slyly manipulative up-and-coming sensation.  Richard Gere pours on the smarmy charm as Billy Flynn, the lawyer who takes on Roxie's case - and, all I can say is that Mr. Gere seems to be having the time of his moviemaking career doing this part.I must say that, as a lover of musicals, I am more than happy to see at least someone being willing to take a chance on reviving this moribund genre - and I sincerely wish the makers of  ""Chicago"" all the luck and success in the world with their bold venture.  I just happen to feel that a truly great musical has to offer more than just spectacular song-and-dance numbers.  It has to provide heart, as well, and a story to make us care.  Just because people sing and dance in musicals doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to see them as real people with real emotions, conflicts and problems.  ""Chicago"" gets the musical parts right for the most part.  It would just have been nice if it had gotten the other aspect right as well.",3,much to recommend but falls short of greatness,1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,5026,"['lot', 'good', 'ingredients',

Renee Zellweger is captivating as the young wannabe who aspires to be something like what Zeta-Jones is in the movie. They both meet up in jail however, because Zellweger kills the man whom she ends up hating, and Zeta-Jones is in jail for killing her sister. They both employ the assistance Richard Gere, the expensive fast-talking successful lawyer, to get out of jail. In the process, they each try to win the favours of the media and grab the headlines of the papers.First, the score, the singing, the dancing are so good that I can watch each scene over and over and still feel the magic in it! Secondly, the acting of course, by each of the actors featured in the movie, is superb. Thirdly, the set production and the costumes were dazzling and so well-coordinated. The director evidently put in a lot of hard work into this and it pays. This is no Moulin Rouge. In this film, the director has done to me what I think Baz Luhrmann couldn't do in Moulin Rouge - which is to successfully blend aspects of film with aspects of musicals seamlessly. The acting is dramatic but each actor fits the role so perfectly that you hardly suspect they're acting... you'd think they are really like that in person!

605746,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B00005JLSE,Scott Kolecki,"[1, 2]","Chicago, a film adaptation of the Broadway Musical by Fosse, is brilliantly brought to life in this production starring Rene Zellweger, Katherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere.  With a supporting cast featuring other Hollywood A-List actors like John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, and the fabulous Queen Latifah, its no wonder that this movie went on to achieve the pinnacle of fame as it swept its way through the Academy Awards this past year.The story, set in the roaring 20's Chicago of gangster fame, is the tale of Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an ambitious unknown singer whose hunger for fame and fortune leads her into the arms of a man who promises to get her the connections she needs.  Later, when she learns that he is has been leading her to sleep with her, she shoots him in a moment of anger.  Her husband, unaware of his wife's extra-marial affairs, takes responsibility for the crime until he learns the other man is actually the same man who recently sold them furniture.  Roxy is incarserated, where she meets famed singer and dancer, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), who is also in prison for the murder of her husband and her sister.The musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter-point of real life incident and elaborately staged jazz song-and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the ""slammer.""Desperate to escape public execution, Roxy implores the assistance of Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Latifah), the prison headmaster whose corruptability is equal to her authority.  She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.The music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.  One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.  She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.  Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.  One of the surprise performances in this production was that of John C. Riley, who plays Amos Hart, Roxy's estranged and dumb-witted husband.  He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film.Running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.  It is no wonder why this film has had the acclaim that it has.  It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz....Scott Kolecki",5,"Great Acting, Singing, Dancing....and All That Jazz!",1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,2817,"['Chicago', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'Fosse', 'brilliantly', 'brought', 'life', 'production', 'starring', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'Katherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'A-List', 'actors', 'John', 'C.', 'Reiley', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'fabulous', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'wonder', 'movie', 'went', 'achieve', 'pinnacle', 'fame', 'swept', 'way', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'past', 'year.The', 'story', 'set', 'roaring', '20', 'Chicago', 'gangster', 'fame', 'tale', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Zellweger', 'ambitious', 'unknown', 'singer', 'hunger', 'fame', 'fortune', 'arms', 'man', 'who', 'get', 'connections', 'Later', 'when', 'been', 'leading', 'sleep', 'shoots', 'moment', 'anger', 'husband', 'unaware', 'wife', 'extra-marial', 'affairs', 'responsibility', 'crime', 'other', 'man', 'actually', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'sold', 'furniture', 'Roxy', 'incarserated', 'where', 'famed', 'singer', 'dancer', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'also', 'prison', 'murder', 'husband', 'sister.The', 'musical', 'filmed', 'brilliantly', 'opposing', 'counter-point', 'real', 'life', 'incident', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'jazz', 'song-and', 'dance', 'numbers', 'narrate', 'story', 'cleverly', 'drawn', 'together', 'blending', 'musical', 'fantasy', 'fascinating', 'story', 'women', 'struggle', 'fame', 'slammer', 'Desperate', 'escape', 'public', 'execution', 'Roxy', 'assistance', 'Matron', 'Mama', 'Morton', 'Latifah', 'prison', 'headmaster', 'corruptability', 'equal', 'authority', 'Roxy', 'touch', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Gere', 'top', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'Chicago', 'man', 'who', 'already', 'representing', 'Velma', 'get', 'out.The', 'music', 'sizzling', 'sultry', 'sexy', 'are', 'costumes', 'actors', 'work', 'numbers', 'One', 'most', 'impressive', 'surprises', 'film', 'actors', 'sing', 'dance', 'own', 'numbers', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'dynamic', 'performing', 'veteran', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'confidence', 'talent', 'beautiful', 'role', 'Velma', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Zellweger', 'Gere', 'also', 'nail', 'numbers', 'bringing', 'vitality', 'sexual', 'tension', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'musical', 'One', 'surprise', 'production', 'was', 'John', 'C.', 'Riley', 'who', 'Amos', 'Hart', 'Roxy', 'estranged', 'dumb-witted', 'husband', 'sensitivity', 'innocence', 'performance', 'character', 'much', 'vitality', 'larger', 'roles', 'film.Running', 'little', 'hour', 'half', 'fabulous', 'film', 'production', 'legendary', 'musical', 'wonder', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'acclaim', 'sure', 'dazzle', 'entertain', 'jazz', '.Scott', 'Kolecki']",Chicago
605747,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JLSE,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","Some movies have all the luck and time their arrivals perfectly.  Fortunately for movie-lovers, two recent musicals have hit the jackpot.  2001's ""Moulin Rouge"" was a hit (more so on DVD than in the theater) because Americans were hungering for musicals and didn't even know it.  2002's ""Chicago"" good timing may not have been as much of a surprise, but its combination of great music, good dance numbers, racy songs, and ultimately its cynical take on America's infatuation with fame are just plain irresistible.An interpretation of Bob Fosse's 1975 theater production (Fosse was from Chicago and was in love with the seedy underworld that dominated the city's headlines), ""Chicago"" revolves around Roxie Hart's impassioned murder of her lover - a word to the wise, if you've seduced an ambitious starlet with tall tales of your ability to get her into a big show, you should break the bad news to her in a letter, not in her bedroom after a tryst.  Tempers run hot with theatrical types, you know.Renee Zellweger plays the nave Mrs. Hart, and her performance is a lot of fun for fans of her other work.  Zellweger usually plays characters who are smarter than everyone around them assumes.  In ""Chicago,"" Zellweger allows her ambition to trump her I.Q., and it's not much of a contest - but it's a blast to watch this talented actress dial up the clueless factor.Zellweger's dancing and singing are also a pleasant surprise - after ""Moulin Rouge,"" we're getting used to being surprised at how good some actors can be with the hoofing and the singing.Hart is married to a loveable shlub of a mechanic, Amos, played by John C. Reilly, who is even more nave than his wife.  He refuses to take the fall for Roxie after realizing that the deceased was their furniture salesman, and he gave them a 10% discount out of the blue.  But Amos, ""Mr. Cellophane,"" allows himself to be led by the nose for most of the movie, and Reilly's performance is pitch-perfect.  And what pipes!Locked away on Death Row (Roxie asks of these special accommodations in the prison, ""Is it nicer?""), Roxie first turns to prison warden Big Mama (Queen Latifah).  In a musical number for the ages, ""When You're Good to Mama,"" Latifah almost steals the entire show.  This song is a masterpiece of double-entendre and attitude, and Latifah nails it perfectly.Mama turns Roxie on to ""the best criminal lawyer in Illinois,"" Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), a fast-talking flim-flam artist with a law degree who will represent Roxie for the princely sum of $5,000.  Despite his professed modesty, Flynn believes that he could have changed world history if Jesus had only had $5,000 and lived in Chicago rather than Galilee.Gere has the attitude, the looks, and the charm to play Flynn, although it must be said that his singing and dancing numbers don't quite seem up to par - but in a way this works because it reminds us that Gere is first and foremost and actor, not a Broadway hoofer, and it is refreshing to see Gere taking such a bold stab at such a challenging role.  By virtually ignoring the law and playing to the crowd with the ""old razzle-dazzle,"" Flynn attempts to get Roxie off.Unfortunately for Roxie, her murder trial bumps another murder trial off the front page - the murder of Veronica Kelly by her sister, Velma (played with cynical gusto by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose stage background is readily apparent).  Can anyone play a rhymes-with-witch like this lady?  Kelly learns the hard way about the pain of falling from the top of the pedestal, and just how big the gap is between headlining and page sixteen.  But she is not one to sit back, and her scheming also offers a threat to young Roxie's chances for getting off.A pell-mell musical with style and wit to spare, ""Chicago"" does not offer many surprises as far as plot or character development go - everyone stays basically true to their nature - but the pleasures of watching this amazing cast perform this raunchy musical are exquisite.",5,"Raunchy, Cynical, Irresistible Musical!",1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,3986,"['movies', 'have', 'luck', 'time', 'arrivals', 'perfectly', 'Fortunately', 'movie-lovers', 'two', 'recent', 'musicals', 'have', 'hit', 'jackpot', '2001', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'was', 'hit', 'more', 'so', 'DVD', 'theater', 'Americans', 'were', 'hungering', 'musicals', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', '2002', 'Chicago', 'good', 'timing', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'surprise', 'combination', 'great', 'music', 'good', 'dance', 'numbers', 'racy', 'songs', 'ultimately', 'cynical', 'take', 'America', 'infatuation', 'fame', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'irresistible.An', 'interpretation', 'Bob', 'Fosse', '1975', 'theater', 'production', 'Fosse', 'was', 'Chicago', 'was', 'love', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'dominated', 'city', 'headlines', 'Chicago', 'around', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'impassioned', 'murder', 'lover', 'word', 'wise', ""'ve"", 'seduced', 'ambitious', 'starlet', 'tall', 'tales', 'ability', 'get', 'big', 'show', 'should', 'break', 'bad', 'news', 'letter', 'not', 'bedroom', 'tryst', 'Tempers', 'run', 'hot', 'theatrical', 'types', 'know.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'nave', 'Mrs.', 'Hart', 'performance', 'lot', 'fun', 'fans', 'other', 'work', 'Zellweger', 'usually', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'Chicago', 'Zellweger', 'ambition', 'trump', 'I.Q.', 'not', 'much', 'contest', 'blast', 'watch', 'talented', 'actress', 'dial', 'clueless', 'factor.Zellweger', 'dancing', 'singing', 'are', 'also', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', ""'re"", 'getting', 'used', 'being', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'hoofing', 'singing.Hart', 'married', 'loveable', 'shlub', 'mechanic', 'Amos', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'nave', 'wife', 'take', 'fall', 'Roxie', 'realizing', 'deceased', 'was', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'gave', '10', '%', 'discount', 'blue', 'Amos', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'be', 'led', 'nose', 'most', 'movie', 'Reilly', 'performance', 'pitch-perfect', 'what', 'Locked', 'away', 'Death', 'Row', 'Roxie', 'special', 'accommodations', 'prison', 'nicer', 'Roxie', 'first', 'prison', 'warden', 'Big', 'Mama', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'musical', 'number', 'ages', 'When', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Mama', 'Latifah', 'almost', 'entire', 'show', 'song', 'masterpiece', 'double-entendre', 'attitude', 'Latifah', 'Roxie', 'best', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'Illinois', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'fast-talking', 'flim-flam', 'artist', 'law', 'degree', 'who', 'will', 'represent', 'Roxie', 'princely', 'sum', '5,000', 'professed', 'modesty', 'Flynn', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'world', 'history', 'Jesus', 'had', 'only', 'had', '5,000', 'lived', 'Chicago', 'rather', 'Galilee.Gere', 'attitude', 'looks', 'charm', 'play', 'Flynn', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'singing', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'up', 'par', 'way', 'Gere', 'first', 'foremost', 'actor', 'not', 'Broadway', 'hoofer', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Gere', 'taking', 'such', 'bold', 'stab', 'challenging', 'role', 'virtually', 'ignoring', 'law', 'playing', 'crowd', 'old', 'razzle-dazzle', 'Flynn', 'attempts', 'get', 'Roxie', 'off.Unfortunately', 'Roxie', 'murder', 'trial', 'murder', 'trial', 'front', 'page', 'murder', 'Veronica', 'Kelly', 'sister', 'Velma', 'played', 'cynical', 'gusto', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'stage', 'background', 'readily', 'apparent', 'Can', 'anyone', 'play', 'rhymes-with-witch', 'lady', 'Kelly', 'hard', 'way', 'pain', 'falling', 'top', 'pedestal', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'gap', 'headlining', 'page', 'sixteen', 'not', 'one', 'sit', 'back', 'scheming', 'also', 'threat', 'young', 'Roxie', 'chances', 'getting', 'off.A', 'pell-mell', 'musical', 'style', 'wit', 'spare', 'Chicago', 'not', 'offer', 'many', 'surprises', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'go', 'everyone', 'basically', 'true', 'nature', 'pleasures', 'watching', 'amazing', 'cast', 'perform', 'raunchy', 'musical', 'are', 'exquisite']",Chicago

605749,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JLSE,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","I have never been a big fan of musicals, and there is only a couple that I consider great movies, like ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cabaret"". I have to say that even though ""Chicago"" is not at the exact same level as these two movies, it is good enough to leave a lasting impression. The music is very good and entertaining, the performances of Catherine Zetta-Jones and Renee Zellweger are inspiring, and the story is interesting.The film starts by jumping right into the action, with amazing music - what a great song is ""All that Jazz"" - and with Velma Kelly (Zetta-Jones) walking into her dressing room, hiding a gun and washing the blood from her hands. That same night, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is among the audience watching Velma and dreaming of being like her. She even witnesses when the police comes to take Velma away for the murder of her cheating husband and her sister, who was the object of his affection.Meanwhile, Roxie is acting on her dreams, and to get there she is sleeping with a man she believes has connections in the show business world and can help her become a star. When she finds out that he was lying, and his ""connections"" were just a scam to get into her pants, she kills him by shooting him point blank. The husband tries to save her, but is not successful in his attempt, and does not try hard after he figures out what was going on between the deceased and his wife; thus, Roxie ends up in the same prison as Velma.Enters Billy Flynn (Gere), the slick lawyer that has a reputation for being able to get anyone off the hook, no matter how gruesome the crime or how abundant the evidence. He is Roxie's last chance, so she has to engage in a competition with Velma to see which case he handles first. The corrupt environment also includes Mama (Queen Latifah), the prison guard who really believes in tit for tat and is always on the prowl for fresh meat.I was surprised when I learned that both Zellweger and Zetta-Jones actually sing themselves in all the music pieces, since the quality of their singing is superb and it appears to be done by professional singers. Both of them do an outstanding job in their acting, and are supported in their roles by the quality performances of Richard Gere and Queen Latifah. Congratulations to Rob Marshall and his team for a remarkable final product.",4,"""Hey, what do you mean hanging?""",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2316,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'musicals', 'only', 'couple', 'consider', 'great', 'movies', 'Jazz', 'Cabaret', 'have', 'say', 'even', 'Chicago', 'not', 'exact', 'same', 'level', 'two', 'movies', 'good', 'enough', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'Catherine', 'Zetta-Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'are', 'inspiring', 'story', 'interesting.The', 'film', 'starts', 'jumping', 'right', 'action', 'amazing', 'music', 'what', 'great', 'song', 'Jazz', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Zetta-Jones', 'walking', 'dressing', 'room', 'hiding', 'gun', 'washing', 'blood', 'hands', 'same', 'night', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Zellweger', 'audience', 'watching', 'Velma', 'dreaming', 'being', 'even', 'when', 'police', 'take', 'Velma', 'away', 'murder', 'cheating', 'husband', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'object', 'affection.Meanwhile', 'Roxie', 'acting', 'dreams', 'get', 'sleeping', 'man', 'connections', 'show', 'business', 'world', 'can', 'help', 'become', 'star', 'When', 'out', 'was', 'lying', 'connections', 'were', 'just', 'scam', 'get', 'pants', 'shooting', 'point', 'blank', 'husband', 'save', 'not', 'successful', 'attempt', 'not', 'try', 'hard', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'deceased', 'wife', 'thus', 'Roxie', 'up', 'same', 'prison', 'Velma.Enters', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Gere', 'slick', 'lawyer', 'reputation', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'anyone', 'hook', 'matter', 'how', 'crime', 'how', 'abundant', 'evidence', 'Roxie', 'last', 'chance', 'engage', 'competition', 'Velma', 'see', 'case', 'first', 'corrupt', 'environment', 'also', 'Mama', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'really', 'tit', 'tat', 'always', 'prowl', 'fresh', 'meat.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'learned', 'Zellweger', 'Zetta-Jones', 'actually', 'sing', 'music', 'pieces', 'quality', 'singing', 'superb', 'be', 'done', 'professional', 'singers', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'acting', 'are', 'supported', 'roles', 'quality', 'performances', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Congratulations', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'team', 'remarkable', 'final', 'product']",Chicago

Oles,"[6, 8]","Anyone who calls CHICAGO the best musical of all time doesn't know much about musicals, but I'm glad they enjoyed it.Reviewer Daniel Wahl seems to have missed the irony of the show entirely.  The amoral characters are not SUPPOSED to be sympathetic.  They're vicious and not-too-bright and what's amusing is watching them achieve their tacky dreams by attacking and double-crossing one another.There are plenty of precedents for CHICAGO's tone: PAL JOEY, for one.  The Rodgers and Hart masterpiece concerns two characters just as venal as Roxie and Velma: a rich jaded adulteress and a vicious young gigolo.  PAL JOEY opened on Broadway in 1940.  What about CAROUSEL, where a rather stupid, innocent girl is seduced by a nasty two-bit hustler?  When you look at the variety of musical subjects done on Broadway over the decades, it's pretty silly to call CHICAGO a &quot;new kind of musical&quot;.Even 1928's SHOWBOAT dealt with some harsh issues: racism, mixed marriages, gambling addiction, alcoholism.  The very first word sung in SHOWBOAT is &quot;the N word&quot; -- a shocking opening that is censored even today.  Hammerstein wanted to confront audiences with the evil of racism right off the bat.The American musical stage has told all kinds of stories since then, some warmly sentimental, others -- like this one -- harshly cynical.I was frankly surprised that CHICAGO was as successful as it was on the screen, since many people like Mr. Wahl feel musicals should always tell sweet, sentimental stories.I love the &quot;warm&quot; musicals like SOUND OF MUSIC, but there is also a place for some with a harder edge.  CHICAGO is not better than THE SOUND OF MUSIC; it's just different.  And having different kinds of musicals, rather than the same kind over and over, is a good thing for the art form of the American musical.",4,"CHICAGO -- fine film of a very odd, cynical musical",1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,1834,"['Anyone', 'who', 'CHICAGO', 'best', 'musical', 'time', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'musicals', ""'m"", 'glad', 'enjoyed', 'it.Reviewer', 'Daniel', 'Wahl', 'have', 'missed', 'irony', 'show', 'entirely', 'amoral', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'sympathetic', ""'re"", 'vicious', 'not-too-bright', 'what', 'amusing', 'watching', 'achieve', 'tacky', 'dreams', 'attacking', 'double-crossing', 'one', 'are', 'plenty', 'precedents', 'CHICAGO', 'tone', 'PAL', 'JOEY', 'one', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'masterpiece', 'concerns', 'two', 'characters', 'just', 'as', 'venal', 'Roxie', 'Velma', 'rich', 'jaded', 'adulteress', 'vicious', 'young', 'gigolo', 'PAL', 'JOEY', 'opened', 'Broadway', '1940', 'What', 'CAROUSEL', 'where', 'rather', 'stupid', 'innocent', 'girl', 'seduced', 'nasty', 'two-bit', 'hustler', 'When', 'look', 'variety', 'musical', 'subjects', 'done', 'Broadway', 'decades', 'pretty', 'silly', 'call', 'CHICAGO', 'quot', 'new', 'kind', 'musical', 'quot', '.Even', '1928', 'SHOWBOAT', 'dealt', 'harsh', 'issues', 'racism', 'mixed', 'marriages', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'alcoholism', 'very', 'first', 'word', 'sung', 'SHOWBOAT', 'quot', 'N', 'word', 'quot', 'shocking', 'opening', 'censored', 'even', 'today', 'Hammerstein', 'wanted', 'confront', 'audiences', 'evil', 'racism', 'right', 'bat.The', 'American', 'musical', 'stage', 'told', 'kinds', 'stories', 'then', 'warmly', 'sentimental', 'others', 'one', 'harshly', 'cynical.I', 'was', 'frankly', 'surprised', 'CHICAGO', 'was', 'as', 'successful', 'was', 'screen', 'many', 'people', 'Mr.', 'Wahl', 'feel', 'musicals', 'should', 'always', 'tell', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'stories.I', 'quot', 'quot', 'musicals', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'also', 'place', 'harder', 'edge', 'CHICAGO', 'not', 'better', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'just', 'different', 'having', 'different', 'kinds', 'musicals', 'rather', 'same', 'kind', 'good', 'thing', 'art', 'form', 'American', 'musical']",Chicago
605753,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B00005JLSE,Sheri in Reho,"[2, 5]","Chicago, a film version of the incredibly popular stage musical, stars Catherine Zeta Jones as nightclub singer Velma Kelly, Renee Zellwegger as star wannabe Roxie Hart, and Richard Gere as sleazy lawyer Billy Flynn. As the film opens, Velma has just killed her cheating husband and Roxie, who dreams of stardom, sleeps with a furniture salesman with supposed showbiz connections. When the salesman doesn't come through with his promise to get Roxie on stage, she shoots him. Both ladies end up in the Cook County Jail on murderess row, under the strong hand of Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah). Both are represented by notorious lawyer Flynn, who will do just about anything to win a case. John C. Reilly appears as Roxie's dullard husband, Taye Diggs as the nightclub band leader, and Christine Baranski as one of the newspaper reporters covering Roxie's murder trial.If you like musical theatre, you're going to love this. First off, I have to say how impressed I was with Catherine Zeta Jones. I have never found her very impressive as an actress, but she knocked my socks off here. Her singing and dancing are excellent, and her performance is charismatic (she steals the show). Zellwegger holds her own in the singing and dancing department but has neither the intensity nor the charisma of Jones. It is fun to watch Richard Gere sing and dance and he does a nice job of it. Taye Diggs was hugely under-used--I would have loved to see him in the action more. The song-and-dance numbers are fantastic--sexy, dramatic, and well-choreographed (Cell Block Tango especially). If, like me, you know the songs by heart, it was a faithful enough reproduction that I could sing along in my head. There were a few things that bugged me. Some of the camera work is extremely fast and jerky, to the point of making me physically uncomfortable and, as much as I like Queen Latifah, I just didn't buy her in this role. She was okay as the prison matron but, when she does her ""When You're Good to Mama"" stage number, she just seems so out of place and uncomfortable in the gold gown with her bosoms flowing out everywhere.

Some people might find the constant breaking out into song annoying, I actually enjoyed it.The movie takes place in the 20's in Chicago.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wants to be a nightclub performer, and she thinks if she beds down a so called manager named Fred Casley she will finally get her big break.  When the man she was having an affair with admits he can't help her, and was only using her for a good time, Roxie gets angry and kills him for betraying her.Roxie's husband is still very much in love with Roxie despite her betrayal, and will do what he has to in order to get her out of jail and cover her legal fees which are not cheap.  Roxie could care less that her husband loves her.  Roxie only has eyes for the limelight and fame.In prison Roxie meets Velma Kelly who she admires. Velma Kelly is in jail for killing her husband and sister who were sleeping together behind her back.Roxie hires Billy Flynn to defend her, and Billy is quite the lawyer.  Roxie and Velma both want to be in the limelight, and in the news.  They will go to any lengths to keep that attention.  Roxie hopes it will help get her career started and Velma wants people to remember her while she is in jail.  For example when Roxie realized she was not getting the attention she wanted because of Lucy Liu's character and she fainted all I could do was shake my head.  She totally forgot she could end up in jail or executed for her crime, and she used her time in jail to seek media attention.  I found it to be rather pathetic.  R&B; singer Mya also has a role in the movie.I was quite surprised at Richard's performance.  I did not see him as the singing and dancing type, but he was actually quite good.  Granted he is not the best singer, but he does okay.  Queen Latifah as ""Momma"" was simply marvelous.  She runs a tight ship, but she actually cares for the inmates in her jail.  If Queen selects the right roles, she has the making of a huge movie star.  My favorite routine out of the whole movie was the Cell Block Tango.  I watched that one routine 6 times.

Think again.  &#65533;Chicago&#65533; is the product of countless hours spent with vocal coaches and choreographers to perfect the art of the movie musical and director Rob Marshall has hit the jackpot &#65533; his whole cast can sing, dance and act as if they were indubitably part of a Broadway troupe.&#65533;Chicago&#65533; starts off on a literal high note, the film&#65533;s energy remaining vigorous to the closing credits.  The call of &#65533;five-six-seven-eight!&#65533; is sounded by a bandleader in a smoky nightclub as an unseen woman in stilettos struts through the rear entrance.  Making a hasty costume change after killing her husband and her sister Veronica in a jealous rage, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) has little qualms about performing their two-woman vignette on her own.  She rushes the stage and in relishing the spotlight, the self-absorbed starlet doesn&#65533;t even notice the Chicago police storming in to arrest her as she enthusiastically belts the opening number to what is, from the very start, a fantastic show.Watching enviously from the audience is Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an aspiring singer who longs for her own stage act that will one day make her a star.  So hungry is she for glory that she&#65533;ll step over &#65533; or slaughter - anyone that stands in the way.In due time, Velma and Roxie both become jailbirds and once imprisoned for their misdeeds, the best musical numbers come into play.  At the femme brig, Roxie meets some interesting prisoners and is formally introduced to &#65533;Mama&#65533; Morton (Queen Latifah), a tough-talking prison matron with a soft spot for attractive dames.  Roxie has scruples about her chances of surviving hard time and starts feeding Mama the ol&#65533; &#65533;damsel in distress&#65533; routine, convincing her to make a phone call to a high-powered attorney named Billy Flynn (Gere).  Knowing she&#65533;ll receive a death sentence by hanging if she doesn&#65533;t secure herself a trial, she charms Billy into taking her case.  Unfortunately, every woman in the prison is vying for Flynn and Roxie and Velma start butting heads, the brash blonde even stealing the trial date that Velma had originally secured.  While waiting for her first day in court, her imagination brings her comfort, her mind conjuring some pretty spectacular song n&#65533; dance sequences.  The most entertaining sketch comes from &#65533;Cell Block Tango&#65533;, six inmates sharing their salacious murder stories (&#65533;&#65533;and then he ran into my knife &#65533; he ran into my knife ten times.&#65533;).  Other sassy numbers include &#65533;Razzle Dazzle&#65533;, &#65533;I Can&#65533;t Do It Alone&#65533; and my personal favorite &#65533;We Both Reached For The Gun&#65533;.  Each song is seamlessly woven into the action, a musical number starting almost immediately after another has ended.  &#65533;Chicago&#65533; ends on a literal bang, the finale containing an original song written especially for the film that brings down the house.It&#65533;s easy to identify the theater veterans.  Zeta-Jones, in a tour-de-force performance that has earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, once belonged to a Catholic performance troupe in her childhood and starred in productions of &#65533;Annie&#65533;, &#65533;Bugsy Malone&#65533;, &#65533;The Pajama Game&#65533; and &#65533;42nd Street&#65533;.  Gere, an accomplished pianist and composer, polished his vocals and fancy footwork up from his last foray into theater some twenty years ago. Considering who else the producers and casting directors had in mind for the part of Billy Flynn (John Travolta, Kevin Spacey and Hugh Jackman were all considered), Gere is a pleasant surprise and my only disappointment is that the Academy failed to notice him.  Christine Baranski, John C. Reilly, Deirdre Goodwin and Taye Diggs round out the theater veterans, the latter two of which made an appearance in the 1998 Broadway revival of &#65533;Chicago&#65533;.Who really astonishes here is Renee Zellweger.  Director Rob Marshall really took a chance on the 32-year-old Texan - she had absolutely no vocal or dance training whatsoever (though no one would know this watching her &#65533; she&#65533;s that good).  She prepared for the role of Roxie Hart not only by watching well-bred co-star Zeta-Jones but endured a grueling schedule of vocal and dance instruction for 10 months to meet professional criterion.  For someone who&#65533;s never set foot on a stage, she has managed to gain her second nomination for Best Actress for doing just that &#65533; it was a risk well-worth taking after all.  Also astounding is Queen Latifah - she belts &#65533;When You&#65533;re Good To Mama&#65533; with such gusto that one would think she&#65533;s been on Broadway all along.  Even more of a shock is her very first appearance on a A-list of Academy Award nominees, not to mention being up against co-star Zeta-Jones in the very same category.Probably the most awe-inspiring aspect here is the man behind the iron curtain.  Rob Marshall, who has been a dancer and choreographer for several years, has taken his first solo stab at directing &#65533; and he&#65533;s chosen a major motion picture to oversee, no less, a medium completely apart from musical theater.  Having co-directed the wildly successful 1998 revival of &#65533;Cabaret&#65533;, Marshall worked with then unknown director Sam Mendes (who won an Academy Award two years later for &#65533;American Beauty&#65533;) and gained a good amount of knowledge as to what it took to helm a production.  Not long after, he was called upon by Miramax producer Harvey Weinstein to discuss a film version of the Broadway musical &#65533;Rent&#65533; but pitched his ideas for &#65533;Chicago&#65533; instead.  Weinstein and others gave Marshall the green light and four years later, his dream was realized.  A virtually unknown member of the entertainment community, he now has a chance of winning an Oscar for Best Director (much like Sam Mendes&#65533; out-of-the-blue nomination and victory).  A little golden man on his mantle will not only make him a household name but will also be the ticket to numerous offers to direct and/or produce over the next few years.Bottom line, I&#65533;d have to say it&#65533;s an incredible case of beginner&#65533;s luck for all involved.  I think it goes without saying that not only will &#65533;Chicago&#65533; be a hit on Oscar night but it will also make an impact with audiences when the DVD (no doubt loaded with special features) hits the shelves sometime this year.",5,Simply Marvelous,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,6648,"['Think', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'can', '65533', 't', 'be', 'multi-talented', 'Think', 'again', '65533',

But ultimately, a movie needs to stand on its story.This story is not only cynical, simplistic and unsympathetic--its also flawed. The characters were all very unsympathetic and corrupt--the only two redeemable ones getting shafted or executed. A story doesn't have to be uplifting or happy to be good.  But it does have to be complete. The fact that Roxie's devoted husband just sort of meanders and disappears into the night is a violation of story-telling on the highest order.I'm indifferent to musicals--I'll state that upfront.  And yet, comparing Chicago to Moulan Rouge, I have to say that I'm shocked at the number of awards Chicago won.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[29, 30]","First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of combining ALL reviews of ALL formats of a movie title and posts on all those formats. So, it is important to sort reviews by ""Current first"" and then look to see which format the review is commenting on (it's there). As of today there are over 1300 reviews posted under this title but none - to my knowledge - are of the new 2014 Blu ray version Diamond Edition of this wonderful musical. So this may be the first. Also be aware that - to my knowledge - the Amazon Instant version may include the newly restored print (which is on the new BD set - but does not contain any of the ""Bonus material"" which - as you will see here - is SUBSTANTIAL.  With that said, on to the review.It honestly is not good use of your time for me to discuss the film itself here.  For that, you might want to choose ""Most Helpful"" and read those reviews. So I won't discuss the plot, musical number, etc here if they were on the earlier releases. Also, you should know that there are two discs in the new package. One is a standard DVD and is virtually the same as the previous  DVD release with a full length Director's Commentary and a featurette on going from the Broadway stage version to the film version. Plus there is one song that was deleted from the film. Heck that is a lot of bonus material....... But wait.The other disc is a Blu ray which contains the gorgeous new ""HD"" print with even better sound. (Since, when I watched the original DVD of this film, it was on a standard-def TV I wasn't seeing much anyway. Now with my larger 42-inch HD screen it looks great. But that's not all. The package cover states that there are ""Over two ours of NEW bonus material"".  I wasn't sure if this was a ploy - after all the film runs just under two hours - but they were right. The BD disc contains a new multi-part documentary that covers nearly all aspects of the film (casting, screenwriting, costuming, and auditions) and runs 2 hours and 20 minutes! The longest section is the 33-minute one on casting each major actor.  All of them were recently interviewed as well as the creative team.  Yes, there are obviously clips from the film to illustrate the comments but the interviews take up most of the time.  I will warn you that this is a ""love fest"" and you will hear nary a negative comment. You will hear a lot of ""he/she was PERFECT"", ""He/she is astounding"" and ""he/she is a remarkable singer/dancer/actor"".  It's almost too positive and the superlatives fly a bit too often. But you will certainly know more than you ever expected to about this film and Broadway musical fans will love every minute of it. But that's NOT all the ""bonus material"". Really! The BD has a slew of ""extended musical numbers"" and a few ""rehearsals"" too. If I counted correctly, there are nine of these, each running about 3- minutes except for the jail cell number which goes on for eight minutes. Because Director Rob Marshall often cut action into the musical numbers, we can now see them without interruption. (Side note - if only Francis Ford Coppola would release the music and dance numbers he filmed for ""The Cotton Club"", this reviewer would be a happy camper. It's never been released and the editing in the film destroys the performance by music legends.)So there you have it. Would I recommend that those who have the prior DVD  ""upgrade"" to this new set? If you are a music theater or Hollywood musicals but, ABSOLUTELY - both for the print and the ne bonuses. If you have only seen the film in the theater or on Amazon Instant, and liked it, then yes too! You'll have a better understanding.  Then if you had a previous configuration, pass that one on to someone who hasn't seen the film and you just might introduce them to what a film version of a Broadway musical should be!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Review of the Bluray with NEW transfer and Hours (yes, hours) of NEW Bonus material",1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3899,"['First', 'important', 'note', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'combining', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'movie', 'title', 'posts', 'formats', 'So', 'important', 'sort', 'reviews', 'Current', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'review', 'commenting', 'there', 'today', 'are', '1300', 'reviews', 'posted', 'title', 'none', 'knowledge', 'are', 'new', '2014', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'Diamond', 'Edition', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'Also', 'be', 'aware', 'knowledge', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'may', 'include', 'newly', 'restored', 'print', 'new', 'BD', 'set', 'not', 'contain', 'Bonus', 'material', 'will', 'see', 'here', 'SUBSTANTIAL', 'said', 'review.It', 'honestly', 'not', 'good', 'use', 'time', 'discuss', 'film', 'here', 'might', 'want', 'choose', 'Most', 'Helpful', 'read', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'plot', 'musical', 'number', 'etc', 'here', 'were', 'earlier', 'releases', 'Also', 'should', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'discs', 'new', 'package', 'One', 'standard', 'DVD', 'virtually', 'same', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'full', 'length', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'featurette', 'going', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'version', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'song', 'was', 'deleted', 'film', 'Heck', 'lot', 'bonus', 'material', 'other', 'disc', 'Blu', 'ray', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'HD', 'print', 'even', 'better', 'sound', 'when', 'watched', 'original', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'standard-def', 'TV', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'much', 'anyway', 'Now', 'larger', '42-inch', 'HD', 'screen', 'great', 'not', 'package', 'cover', 'are', 'two', 'ours', 'NEW', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'ploy', 'film', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'were', 'right', 'BD', 'disc', 'new', 'multi-part', 'documentary', 'nearly', 'aspects', 'film', 'casting', 'screenwriting', 'costuming', 'auditions', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'longest', 'section', '33-minute', 'one', 'casting', 'major', 'actor', 'were', 'recently', 'interviewed', 'as', 'well', 'creative', 'team', 'Yes', 'are', 'obviously', 'clips', 'film', 'illustrate', 'comments', 'interviews', 'take', 'up', 'most', 'time', 'will', 'warn', 'love', 'fest', 'will', 'hear', 'nary', 'negative', 'comment', 'will', 'hear', 'lot', 'he/she', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'He/she', 'astounding', 'he/she', 'remarkable', 'singer/dancer/actor', 'almost', 'too', 'positive', 'superlatives', 'fly', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'will', 'certainly', 'know', 'more', 'ever', 'expected', 'film', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'minute', 'NOT', 'bonus', 'material', 'Really', 'BD', 'slew', 'extended', 'musical', 'numbers', 'few', 'rehearsals', 'too', 'counted', 'correctly', 'are', 'nine', 'running', '3-', 'minutes', 'jail', 'cell', 'number', 'eight', 'minutes', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'often', 'cut', 'action', 'musical', 'numbers', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'interruption', 'Side', 'note', 'only', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'would', 'release', 'music', 'dance', 'numbers', 'filmed', 'Cotton', 'Club', 'reviewer', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'camper', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'editing', 'film', 'performance', 'music', 'legends', 'there', 'have', 'Would', 'recommend', 'who', 'have', 'prior', 'DVD', 'upgrade', 'new', 'set', 'are', 'music', 'theater', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'print', 'ne', 'bonuses', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'theater', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'liked', 'then', 'yes', 'too', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'Then', 'had', 'previous', 'configuration', 'pass', 'one', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'introduce', 'what', 'film', 'version', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'should', 'be', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Chicago

I'll give it that.It's well put together, and has some catchy dialogue.The problem is, is that, none of the actors can sing or dance.I mean when you watch it at first, you think, wow they're amazing, but after time passes by, your amazement wears off, and you begin to see this film for what it really is-it's well-filmed.The shots are basically what make all the actors look like they're dancing.Even then I wasn't impressed.And Catherine Zeta Jones, who CAN sing and dance(relatively) is one of the film's weaknesess.She overacts wayyyyyy too much.I mean, I never thought of Jones as anything special, and this movie proves it.She's not able to perfectly capture the chracter, so she does what any mediocre actress would do-she overacts!!Richard Gere, now I've always disliked him as an actor.I have my reasons.I mean he's capable of giving a decent performance here and there, but I have always disliked him because he overacts,is trite, and brings no depth or poignancy to his characters.His singing in the movie bored me to death, and so did his dancing. It also felt that throughout the whole movie he was putting on one big show, and trying to impress everyone.Rene is a great young actress, but she cannot sing or dance, and I really don't care how much she tried.Now, I thought Latifah's singing was the best in the film.She also proved that big women can be sexy, and gave her cheesy chracter a somewhat new spin.John C.

605775,A37NL9EDUT23IV,B00005JLSE,"takemehome ""Joey""","[7, 10]","2002's Chicago was a box office smash and signaled the return of movie musicals, along with Moulin Rouge a year before, and The Phantom Of The Opera, Rent, and The Producers since. Winner of 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, its initial DVD treatment was not one worthy of a Best Picture Oscar-winner. Featuring a making-of featurette, an audio commentary, and a deleted musical number, Class, the DVD definitely needed work.2005 saw the announcement of a deluxe 3-disc DVD of the movie, called The Razzle Dazzle Edition. However, sometime in the year, the release was pushed back from September to December, and the third disc, containing the soundtrack in 5.1 Digital Surround, was dropped. However, the 2-disc treatment still finally gives this movie a deserving, if not perfect, DVD treatment.The transfer itself is good, but it's a bit grainy. For a new movie, which likely has pristine digital sources for video, the transfer shouldn't be as grainy as it is. The grain isn't heavy, but it's still slightly noticeable. Despite that, the transfer was very well done. Disc 1 also contains the Class number, which although is great, would not have worked within the film's concept of everything being through Roxie's point of view. Also, a feature on the plays, Broadway show, and its eventual translation to the big screen, and an audio commentary round out disc 1.Disc 2 contains lots of amazing bonuses. Extended musical performances, featurettes on the crew, a feature on when Liza Minelli played Roxie Hart, a feature on the cameo appearance by Chita Rivera, Broadway's original Velma Kelly, and VH1's Behind The Movie are included on here. My only real beef is the VH1 special. It would have been nice for them to make a new, longer, more in-depth making-of documentary that also covered the Oscar wins, as the VH1 special was aired after the nominations were announced, but before the ceremony. Also, a theatrical trailer or two would have been nice.

""Chicago"" roars with energy and verve, with nearly every scene exploding with attitude like a grenade.  Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are just dynamite as Roxie and Velma, two women who have been nabbed by the law for offing the men who did them wrong.  Hoping to beat the murder rap, they take sides with the town's most prestigious lawyer (a vibrant Richard Gere), and from there begins a storyline involving crime, greed, scandal, and the shameless pursuit of fame.  But the film's revelation is Queen Latifah's supporting role as the prison's Matron Mama.  Her sultry rendition of ""When You're Good to Mama"" will immediately end any doubt as to whether she deserved her Academy Award nomination.  But props have to go to Zellweger and Zeta-Jones, who tear up the screen at every musical number they perform.  The voices are on point, and the choreography is breathtakingly alive.

605779,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00005JLSE,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[5, 8]","Just as Disney has been accused of smoothing over the darkness of the fairy tales it made into cartoons in the 40s, this movie smoothes over some of the noirishness and grit that I think were need to make the adaptation really work. The way they translated this to the screen is ingenious, but at the same time they sanitized it, giving it a neon, pop-movie, MTVish sensibility. There's lots of talk, both here and on the DVD supplements, about all the ""grittiness."" I don't see it. This film is--perhaps appropriately, since Disney owns Miramax--a Disneyland version of the 1920s. Yes, I know it's a musical and it's supposed to be ""fun."" But musicals can be dark, too.I was also bothered by the excessive cutting during the dance sequences. It was here that I really missed the presence of Bob Fosse. The present director, Rob Marshall, doesn't have the same clear-headedness of The Master. Not only is there too much cross-cutting, the camera stays inexplicably on the floor, tracking past heads in the audience that partially-block the view and never soaring above the action. Watching the opening number, I could tell there was intricate staging but I couldn't really *see* all of it, since the camera was too close, too low, and cut away to pointless reaction shots too often. I'd thought filmmakers had learned their lesson on that one after The Cotton Club. (Or, to quote part of Stuart Klawans' review for The Nation: ""[Rob Marshall] has shot it like one of those commercials for Broadway musicals, the ones that run on the late news in New York City. The purpose is to *tell* you that you're being entertained, by subjecting you to a gazillion quick, unmotivated cuts among ill-lit, slapdash setups--which is irritating enough during a thirty-second spot but unbearable as a movie.""  Right on, bro.)  There *is* one brilliant show-stopper, ""We Both Reached For The Gun,"" that has to be seen to be believed.Renee Zelwegger, who always looks to me like she just got back from root canal, is okay, but here's a thought--how about considering Christina Aguilera? That might have brought an edge to things. Mrs. Michael Douglas is fine, and brings a nice voluptuousness to her role, but her accents tends to cut in and out. Richard Gere has the right charisma in the acting scenes, but he can't sing or dance, and his tap scene is well-covered to hide this fact. But the always-reliable John C. Reilly sure can, and is probably the most satisfying actor in this whole movie. Queen Latifah is, well, Queen Latifah--if they ever make ""The Bessie Smith Story,"" she's a shoe-in. Christine Baranski is--as always--sly, sophisticated fun. Lucy Liu makes a surprise appearance in the sort of role you're not used to seeing her in, and she's little more than eye-candy, but that's enough for me.The songs are cute and occasionally catchy, but never memorable or original and never deep. And that pretty much sums up the whole movie. It's pleasant for two hours but like the popcorn you're munching as you watch it, it won't stay with you. I can't help but think if Fosse had done it, it would be something more--while still being racy and raunchy and fun. Just look at how he handled All That Jazz to see the difference between that kind of coiled, almost neurotic energy and this kind of razzle-dazzle energy. It's obvious Marshall worked very hard on this film, but the result, while not ""wrong"" in any way, is kind of cookie-cutter bland, like a stroll down Disneyland's Main Street USA. I also had an issue with one part of the screenplay: namely, with the introduction of the Lucy Liu character we get the message that infamy is fleeting and everyone is willing to quickly move on to the next celebrity scandal. But this exact thing happens again in the story fifteen minutes later, and so it loses its impact the second time at a more crucial point in the story. I think, much as I enjoyed seeing the squirming, scantily-clad Liu, I would have cut that whole section and saved the ""fleeting fame"" motif for the end--it would have more punch that way. (My other production issue has to do with how some of the money seen in the film is period while other money is obviously modern-day cash. How can filmmakers make errors that big?)  But perhaps the whole message of the show-biz aspects of celebrity trials is a bit old in this post-OJ age.  I kept thinking during Richard Gere's song about the media circus that Johnnie Cochran had demonstrated it better.The transfer to DVD is excellent, with some of the sharpest imaging I've ever seen. There are some supplements: the obligatory Making Of documentary where everybody gushes, extended dance scenes, some rehearsal footage, no trailer, a documentary about the director, which I didn't bother to watch, and a commentary from director and screenwriter. There are also extras involving Chita Rivera and Liza Minelli that are mildly entertaining. There's one deleted musical number, ""Class,"" that's quite good, but didn't fit into the way they staged the movie.Most people will probably like this a lot. It's harmless, brainless fun.  I just think it was maybe a bit flat, and there was more there that went unexplored. Well-crafted, ambitious, but, after all the hype, a bit cautious and bland.",3,"Too much razzle, not enough dazzle",1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,5246,"['Just', 'Disney', 'been', 'accused',

Roxy Hart is one of them.  Bored with her life, she dreams of fame on the stage of musical theater.  She has an affair with someone who promises to get her into the theater, but it turns out to be a lie of seduction.  Enraged by this deception and humiliation, Roxy murders the liar.  Ironically, it's this murder which launches her on her way to the fame she always wanted.  After she retains the services of the genius criminal lawyer, Bill Flynn, it's showtime.  Billy remolds Roxy and manipulates the press like a supernatural puppetmaster.  Roxy finally achieves the fame she wished for, but she learns about the transitory nature of fame.I think this is very relevant to American society today.  We can explore the issues of injustice in the criminal system, the issue of fame in America, and the tendancy of the American press to repeat whatever is fed to it.  You get the impression that those who have money, or those who have a telent for manipulating people will have no trouble escaping from justice, whereas those who have no voice in the world, as represented by the Hungarian woman who was executed, will never get the justice they deserve.  It's important to watch this to get a feel of where American society is going.Getting back to the movie itself, it is just spectacular.  It's perhaps one of the best musical movies ever produced.

It has an all star cast, a great musical score, and a plot that is so far-fetched, it is nothing but a good time. Though the action of the film revolves around a group of women who kill their significant others, a publicity hungry lawyer, and a less than noble women's prison warden-hardly the best society has to offer-it does not attempt to be anything but fun. The film is glitzy, colorful, and fast paced. The DVD has a bonus track of a number omitted from the film which is fun to watch, though omitting it from the film was probably a wise choice, and behind the scenes shots which is a plus fo0r any movie buff.Many reviewers of the film wondered if Chicago's success is the beginning of a new era of Hollywood musicals. This is hard to say. If we look at some of the great musicals of yesteryear, particularly the great MGM musicals and Twentieth Century Fox's versions of the Rogers and Hammerstein greats, and consider that studios were able to take implausible plots, set then to music, add an all star cast,  put money behind the project, trusting the talent of all involved and the movie going public to support such projects, and have great success, then perhaps Chicago is the beginning of a new era.

605787,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00005JLSE,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[2, 6]","In BriefRoxie Hart (Zellweger) dreams of singing and dancing in the vaudeville shows of a 1929 Chicago like her idol Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones).  Yet a few wrong steps lead to Roxie living her life on murderers row in the Cook County Clink.  A grim dank lock up she finds herself under the crooked care of the prison Matron Morton (Latifah), who puts Roxie in touch with the legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere).  Milking her husband (Reily) for Flynn's fees, Roxie soon finds herself shot into the limelight created by the media frenzy surrounding her case.  With her career exploding her fellow inmate &amp; former idol Miss Kelly is less than impressed, but need she be worried or will the flavour of the month soon shift once again.ReviewThis is not Moulin Rouge and that's neither a good or bad thing as this is Chicago.  One of the biggest hits of the West End &amp; Broadway hits the silver screen with a bang, yet this not just the stage show, this is pure genius.  Taking the song and dance show from the stage was never going to be easy and indeed it has been attempted numerous times in the past but never made it into production.  The problem has always been that Chicago is a theatrical show of pure vaudeville and that wont translate to the cinema, but one day when he was meant to be promoting the conception of the film of Rent to Miramax honchos, director Rob Marshall suddenly had an epiphany regarding Chicago where all the musical elements would take the form of asides or exist as pure fantasy primarily through the mind of Roxie Hart.A simple premise becomes a stroke of genius, as the audience becomes drawn into a world that quickly sets up its own conventions of communication.  The ease with which this is done demonstrates an understated talent that can only be highlighted here.  One quickly finds the musical elements of the film are never out of sync with the timing of the narrative, lend both poignancy &amp; humour to the film, while always leaving you wanting more each time a number ends.  Indeed one can't help but feel that Marshall is the Billy Flynn we never see, as he razzle dazzles us and gives us our own ""show that is so spendiflorus.""So what of the singing?  Well like the strength of the cast it can't be faulted as each seems to meld their persona so well into their performance.  Indeed the cast is solid throughout and the cameos by Mya and Lucy Lui are lovely.  One could question the highness of Gere's tone but that aside the stand out performer is without a doubt Zellweger who is both stunning &amp; glamorous, yet vulnerable &amp; fragile which she can communicate through not only acting but also song thus displaying sheer brilliance on her part.  A special mention should also be made of John C. Reily's Amos, never before has anyone captured Mr. Cellophane with such heart.  If you leave this film without feeling higher than you when you came in check your pulse as this had me singing along to the Cell Block Tango and definitely had all that jazz!The VerdictIf the dance numbers that are both a combination of traditional Fosse and more contemporary styles don't impress you, the melding of story and musical into the narrative certainly will.  Yes this is a musical but suspend your disbelief and let Chicago tempt you with the darkest story of treachery, betrayal and murder you'll ever see twisted into a song and dance show.",4,Zeta steals the show!,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3387,"['BriefRoxie', 'Hart', 'Zellweger', 'dreams', 'singing', 'dancing', 'vaudeville', 'shows', '1929', 'Chicago', 'idol', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Zeta-Jones', 'few', 'wrong', 'steps', 'lead', 'Roxie', 'living', 'life', 'murderers', 'row', 'Cook', 'County', 'Clink', 'A', 'grim', 'dank', 'lock', 'crooked', 'care', 'prison', 'Matron', 'Morton', 'Latifah', 'who', 'Roxie', 'touch', 'legendary', 'lawyer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Gere', 'Milking', 'husband', 'Reily', 'Flynn', 'fees', 'Roxie', 'soon', 'shot', 'limelight', 'created', 'media', 'frenzy', 'surrounding', 'case', 'career', 'exploding', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'amp', 'former', 'idol', 'Miss', 'Kelly', 'less', 'impressed', 'need', 'be', 'worried', 'will', 'flavour', 'month', 'soon', 'shift', 'once', 'again.ReviewThis', 'not', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'Chicago', 'One', 'biggest', 'hits', 'West', 'End', 'amp', 'Broadway', 'silver', 'screen', 'bang', 'yet', 'not', 'just', 'stage', 'show', 'pure', 'genius', 'Taking', 'song', 'dance', 'show', 'stage', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'indeed', 'been', 'attempted', 'numerous', 'times', 'past', 'never', 'made', 'production', 'problem', 'always', 'been', 'Chicago', 'theatrical', 'show', 'pure', 'vaudeville', 'wont', 'translate', 'cinema', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'promoting', 'conception', 'film', 'Rent', 'Miramax', 'honchos', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'suddenly', 'had', 'epiphany', 'regarding', 'Chicago', 'where', 'musical', 'elements', 'would', 'take', 'form', 'asides', 'exist', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'primarily', 'mind', 'Roxie', 'Hart.A', 'simple', 'premise', 'stroke', 'genius', 'audience', 'drawn', 'world', 'quickly', 'up', 'own', 'conventions', 'communication', 'ease', 'done', 'understated', 'talent', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'highlighted', 'here', 'One', 'quickly', 'musical', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'sync', 'timing', 'narrative', 'lend', 'poignancy', 'amp', 'humour', 'film', 'always', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'time', 'number', 'Indeed', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Marshall', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'never', 'see', 'dazzles', 'own', 'show', 'so', 'spendiflorus', 'So', 'what', 'singing', 'Well', 'strength', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'meld', 'persona', 'so', 'well', 'performance', 'Indeed', 'cast', 'solid', 'cameos', 'Mya', 'Lucy', 'Lui', 'are', 'lovely', 'One', 'could', 'question', 'highness', 'Gere', 'tone', 'aside', 'stand', 'out', 'performer', 'doubt', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'stunning', 'amp', 'glamorous', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'amp', 'fragile', 'can', 'communicate', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'also', 'song', 'thus', 'displaying', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'part', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'Amos', 'never', 'before', 'anyone', 'captured', 'Mr.', 'Cellophane', 'such', 'heart', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'higher', 'when', 'came', 'check', 'pulse', 'had', 'singing', 'along', 'Cell', 'Block', 'Tango', 'definitely', 'had', 'jazz', 'VerdictIf', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'combination', 'traditional', 'Fosse', 'more', 'contemporary', 'styles', 'do', ""n't"", 'impress', 'melding', 'story', 'musical', 'narrative', 'certainly', 'will', 'Yes', 'musical', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'let', 'Chicago', 'tempt', 'darkest', 'story', 'treachery', 'betrayal', 'murder', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'twisted', 'song', 'dance', 'show']",Chicago

Among the cast you can see a spectacular cast of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, bringing before you the show business on stage and in real life. These people, seemingly unrelated in any sense being originally living in three different worlds were brought together by the legal system, which turn out to be a stage for the show business of ruthless lawyers to earn a fortune out of it. The movie weaved all the song and dance numbers tightly together creating a mysterious but fantastic world of Jazz and dance, life and death, glamour and darkness. Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning as usual as the arrogant stage performer Velma Kelly who despised other people?s as low life sucking up to her. Renee Zellweger as Roxie, who lives between her own fantasy world of stage and struggle in her real life, finally learn the trick of survival in a greater stage performance brought to her by her ruthless and daring lawyer Richard Gere. The performance of the cast is fabulous and the tap dance of Richard Gere should be a part that should not be missed. Renee though portrayed a different person as Roxie, still show glimpses of Bridget Jones from time to time. Nonetheless, the overall performance was not affected by that for both characters lived in dreams from time to time. Singing wise, the standard is average, but the show was supplemented by high quality acting not only from the leads but all from the supporting cast including Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton and John C.

605791,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLSE,Tucker Andersen,"[41, 53]","This film successfully transitions Bob Fosse's smash musical (currently in revival on Broadway) to the screen. Director Rob Marshall imaginatively uses the film techniques at his disposal to keep the audience engaged thru the fast pace and switches between reality and Roxie's fantasies. The story is set in the dance halls and theaters of the Roaring Twenties, and involves love, murder and an examination of the difference between notoriety and fame and the fleeting nature of success.Roxie Hart (Renee Zellewegger) is a girl who dreams of being a musical star, as is her role model Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). They soon both are in jail awaiting trial for murders that they have committed, and vie for the attention of attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the hot shot lawyer who has never lost a capital case. They also attempt to capture the media spotlight, given the headline-grabbing nature of their crimes of passion, Velma's fame, and the press sensationalism of the time. While Zeta-Jones was already an accomplished dancer, all the performanes are excellent, and it is a tribute to Zellwegger and Gere that while perhaps not up to the quality of Broadway stage performers they handle the musical and dancing aspects of their roles so well. (Richard Gere engaged in a huge amount of practice for the tapdancing scene alone.) Queen Latifah utilizes her talents to the fullest and is wonderful as the manipulative prison matron. John C. Reilly does a superb job as Amos, Roxie's faithful and loving husband who is not the brightest star in the sky. (His musical routine as ""the Cellophane Man"" is captivating.)But remember that this is a big stage musical on the screen, not a complicated plot or a moving and emotional drama. The story is only a vehicle for the incredible music and the marvelous dance routines of Bob Fosse, and totally succeeds in that attempt. So go to enjoy an hour and forty-five minutes of action and fun and to see the wonderful performances of the cast. (And at a small fraction of the price that you would pay for tickets to the Broadway show.) Hopefully, the artistic and commercial success of CHICAGO will cause other producers, directors and actors to realize the potential of current Broadway shows to become hit films and encourage them to revive this almost forgotten form of movie release.",5,"A WONDERFUL MUSICAL - NON-STOP DANCING, MUSIC AND FUN",1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,2340,"['film', 'successfully', 'transitions', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'smash', 'musical', 'currently', 'revival', 'Broadway', 'screen', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'imaginatively', 'film', 'techniques', 'disposal', 'keep', 'audience', 'engaged', 'fast', 'pace', 'switches', 'reality', 'Roxie', 'fantasies', 'story', 'set', 'dance', 'halls', 'theaters', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'love', 'murder', 'examination', 'difference', 'notoriety', 'fame', 'fleeting', 'nature', 'success.Roxie', 'Hart', 'Renee', 'Zellewegger', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'musical', 'star', 'role', 'model', 'Velma', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'soon', 'are', 'jail', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'murders', 'have', 'committed', 'vie', 'attention', 'attorney', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'hot', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'who', 'never', 'lost', 'capital', 'case', 'also', 'attempt', 'capture', 'media', 'spotlight', 'given', 'headline-grabbing', 'nature', 'crimes', 'passion', 'Velma', 'fame', 'press', 'sensationalism', 'time', 'Zeta-Jones', 'was', 'already', 'accomplished', 'dancer', 'performanes', 'are', 'excellent', 'tribute', 'Zellwegger', 'Gere', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quality', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'performers', 'handle', 'musical', 'dancing', 'aspects', 'roles', 'so', 'well', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'engaged', 'huge', 'amount', 'practice', 'tapdancing', 'scene', 'alone', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'talents', 'fullest', 'wonderful', 'manipulative', 'prison', 'matron', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'superb', 'job', 'Amos', 'Roxie', 'faithful', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'brightest', 'star', 'sky', 'musical', 'routine', 'Cellophane', 'Man', 'captivating', 'remember', 'big', 'stage', 'musical', 'screen', 'not', 'complicated', 'plot', 'moving', 'emotional', 'drama', 'story', 'only', 'vehicle', 'incredible', 'music', 'marvelous', 'dance', 'routines', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'totally', 'attempt', 'So', 'go', 'enjoy', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'action', 'fun', 'see', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'cast', 'small', 'fraction', 'price', 'would', 'pay', 'tickets', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Hopefully', 'artistic', 'commercial', 'success', 'CHICAGO', 'will', 'cause', 'other', 'producers', 'directors', 'actors', 'realize', 'potential', 'current', 'Broadway', 'become', 'hit', 'films', 'encourage', 'revive', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'form', 'movie', 'release']",Chicago

That's what CHICAGO has done with many of the critics and the Hollywood establishment; put on a great show to hide a movie that's really only so-so. ...Seeing that this is a musical, the acting is top-notch because it also involves a ton of singing and dancing as well. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting a lot of press, but the real stars of the show are the two major male performers: Richard Gere and John C. Reilly. Gere has a solo tap dance number that is most impressive. Reilly plays the only character who is likeable and normal and his solo song ""Cellophane Man"" is a performance of classic showmanship.The film's story cuts back and forth from reality to fantasy, making the movie difficult to follow at first. Overall the only parts of the film that I was impressed by were the first ten minutes and the last thirty minutes The hour and twenty minutes in between is rather forgettable. The film has a PG-13 rating, but actually borders on R territory; there are a lot of scenes of violence and almost all the women are so scantily clothed it looks like they are wearing thin strips of toilet paper over their most private areas.I admit that the film had me wanting Roxie Hart to be proven innocent. However, in doing so, I lost respect for the movie. I've routed for the criminal before (e.g. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), but the criminals were always likeable people who made a change of character. In CHICAGO, all of the characters (John C. Reilly's Mr. Hart withstanding) are despicable crooks. They are sleazy liars who wallow in a hedonistic lifestyle at the expense of the joy and peace of others.

605797,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLSE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 6]","Film is a harsh mistress. Every imperfection is magnified a million times and, the worst part, permanently recorded for all the world to see. That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise. Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.Based on the Kander &amp; Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film. That's a rarity since the &quot;death&quot; of the film musical. Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium; the musical numbers are mobile, well edited and choregraphed and he manages to integrate the mobility of film with the necessary static elements of the original stage play.Although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own. What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.  Marshall keeps the original story intact. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones play, respectively, wanna-be caberet performer and the real deal who end up in prison after committing murder. Zellweger murders her lover who had promised to help her breakthrough into performing after he reveals he had no connections and was just using her for sex.Zeta-Jones murders her husband and sister (her partner in their musical act)when they are caught in the act --quite literally--of commiting adultry. Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones circle like wary predators unclear on the concept of trust. They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals. The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (playing Roxie Hart) and Catherine Zeta-Jones both sparkle in their film debt as dancers and singers. While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material. In fact, their strong backgrounds as actors add an element that might be missing from technically more gifted singers. Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.Richard Gere is especially noteworthy. I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances. What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career. His gold digging lawyer is every bit a manipulator as Roxie Hart(Zellweger). John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise. While he's a terrific actor, I never pictured him as a singer. He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number. O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold. He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause.The Kanter &amp; Ebb songs are great. Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written. Kanter's music is also a highlight. It's clear that Chicago is every bit the equal (although smaller in scope)of their classic Cabaret. If Chicago isn't quite as powerful as Fosse's film version of Cabaret or even All That Jazz, it's due to the smaller scope of the story. It's equally entertaining though.The transfer is terrific with the crisp picture and colors captured vividly in this DVD transfer. The sound transfer is rich although there is some noticable compression in a couple of scenes. The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another. The widescreen version preserves the original aspect ratio. Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well. Since this film is about the onscreen dancing and singing, there's some picture loss but it won't be noticable to most folks.",4,Rob Marshall's film dazzles,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,4310,"['Film', 'harsh', 'mistress', 'imperfection', 'magnified', 'million', 'times', 'worst', 'part', 'permanently', 'recorded', 'world', 'see', 'why', 'Chicago', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'collaboration', 'other', 'performers/artists', 'involved', 'film', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'musicals', 'heyday', 'wunderkind', 'Bob', 'Fosse.Based', 'Kander', 'amp', 'Ebb', 'musical', 'directed', 'maverick', 'choregraphy', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Chicago', 'capture', 'Fosse', 'spirit', 'make', 'transition', 'stage', 'musical', 'film', 'rarity', 'quot', 'death', 'quot', 'film', 'musical', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'translate', 'CHicago', 'one', 'medium', ""n't"", 'undercut', 'strengths', 'medium', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'mobile', 'well', 'edited', 'choregraphed', 'integrate', 'mobility', 'film', 'necessary', 'static', 'elements', 'original', 'stage', 'Marshall', 'choregrapher', 'great', 'debt', 'Fosse', 'original', 'work', 'uniquely', 'own', 'What', 'most', 'surprising', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'tweak', 'play', 'most', 'successful', 'elements', 'stage', 'version', 'film', 'Marshall', 'original', 'story', 'intact', 'Zellweger', 'Zeta-Jones', 'play', 'respectively', 'wanna-be', 'caberet', 'performer', 'real', 'deal', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'prison', 'committing', 'murder', 'Zellweger', 'murders', 'lover', 'who', 'had', 'promised', 'help', 'breakthrough', 'performing', 'had', 'connections', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'sex.Zeta-Jones', 'murders', 'husband', 'sister', 'partner', 'musical', 'act', 'when', 'are', 'caught', 'act', 'quite', 'literally', 'commiting', 'adultry', 'Thrown', 'together', 'due', 'circumstances', 'Zellweger', 'Zeta-Jones', 'circle', 'wary', 'predators', 'unclear', 'concept', 'trust', 'want', 'same', 'goal', 'clear', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'reach', 'goals', 'fact', 'media', 'rewards', 'sympathetic', 'portrayals', 'paper', 'due', 'money', 'hungry', 'lawyer', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'trip', 'down', 'dark', 'side', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'playing', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'sparkle', 'film', 'debt', 'dancers', 'singers', 'one', 'great', 'voices', 'are', 'appropriate', 'material', 'fact', 'strong', 'backgrounds', 'actors', 'add', 'element', 'might', 'be', 'missing', 'technically', 'more', 'gifted', 'singers', 'Yes', 'play', 'amoral', 'characters', 'yes', 'none', 'characters', 'really', 'have', 'socially', 'redeeming', 'values', 'represent', 'very', 'cynical', 'witty', 'look', 'media', 'manipulation', 'about.Richard', 'Gere', 'especially', 'noteworthy', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'Gere', 'performance', 'so', 'strong', 'given', 'background', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'performances', 'What', 'surprising', ""'d"", 'take', 'risky', 'colorful', 'role', 'so', 'late', 'career', 'gold', 'digging', 'lawyer', 'bit', 'manipulator', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Zellweger', 'John', 'C.', ""O'Riley"", 'bit', 'surprise', 'terrific', 'actor', 'never', 'pictured', 'singer', 'quite', 'well', 'memorable', 'musical', 'number', ""O'Riley"", 'Roxie', 'dimwitted', 'husband', 'heart', 'gold', 'only', 'decent', 'person', 'whole', 'film', 'one', 'everyone', 'own', 'unjust', 'cause.The', 'Kanter', 'amp', 'Ebb', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'Fred', 'Ebb', 'lyrics', 'are', 'witty', 'best', 'had', 'written', 'Kanter', 'music', 'also', 'highlight', 'clear', 'Chicago', 'bit', 'equal', 'smaller', 'scope', 'classic', 'Cabaret', 'Chicago', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'powerful', 'Fosse', 'film', 'version', 'Cabaret', 'even', 'Jazz', 'due', 'smaller', 'scope', 'story', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'though.The', 'transfer', 'terrific', 'crisp', 'picture', 'colors', 'captured', 'vividly', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'sound', 'transfer', 'rich', 'noticable', 'compression', 'couple', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'featurette', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'provide', 'insight', 'challenges', 'translating', 'successful', 'musical', 'one', 'medium', 'widescreen', 'version', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'widescreen', 'standard', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'nicely', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'onscreen', 'dancing', 'singing', 'picture', 'loss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'noticable', 'most', 'folks']",Chicago

The story of two murdering femme fatales (Renne Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both belting out songs and dancing their hearts out) in Prohibition-era Chicago is cynical, jaded, beyond belief--and just right as a vehicle to showcase the stars' considerable talents in an area where we did not expect to see them.Picture Richard Gere, a hotshot lawyer who represents both ladies, singing and dancing while keeping his cynical persona intact, and you have an idea of just what a romp this movie really is. Catherine Zeta-Jones, showstopping gorgeous as a Theda Bera-style vamp, is nothing less than wonderful. So is Queen Latifah, who steals the show as the bribe-taking, seen-it-all matron of the women's prison. I'd see the movie all over again just to see the Queen give it all she's got in full twenties regalia--including a feather boa.It's Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, who ultimately makes the movie, even though the entire ensemble cast is fabulous, right down to the bit players. She does a bravura job as Roxie, the sweet little murderess who, after plugging her no-good lover with a chest full of bullets shot at point-blank range, manages to convey a frightened innocence that makes one want to hug her. Slimmed down entirely from her zaftig ""Bridget Jones"" days, Renee gives it all she's got, and shows that she coulda been a contender--a torch singer par excellence.Wild, big, bold, with 20s-style sets and 21st-century over-the-top editing, ""Chicago"" is a wonderful treat, well worth seeing more than once.",4,Renee and Catherine Roar!,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,1646,"['Bob', 'Fosse', 'was', 'such', 'larger-than-life', 'talent', 'exuberant', 'adaptation', 'Seventies', 'stage', 'production', 'story', 'two', 'murdering', 'femme', 'fatales', 'Renne', 'Zellweger', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'belting', 'out', 'songs', 'dancing', 'hearts', 'out', 'Prohibition-era', 'Chicago', 'cynical', 'jaded', 'belief', 'just', 'right', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'stars', 'considerable', 'talents', 'area', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'them.Picture', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'hotshot', 'lawyer', 'who', 'ladies', 'singing', 'dancing', 'keeping', 'cynical', 'persona', 'intact', 'have', 'idea', 'just', 'what', 'romp', 'movie', 'really', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'showstopping', 'gorgeous', 'Theda', 'Bera-style', 'vamp', 'nothing', 'less', 'wonderful', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'show', 'bribe-taking', 'seen-it-all', 'matron', 'women', 'prison', ""'d"", 'see', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'see', 'Queen', 'give', 'got', 'full', 'twenties', 'regalia', 'including', 'feather', 'boa.It', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'opinion', 'who', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'even', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'right', 'down', 'bit', 'players', 'bravura', 'job', 'Roxie', 'sweet', 'little', 'murderess', 'who', 'plugging', 'no-good', 'lover', 'chest', 'full', 'bullets', 'shot', 'point-blank', 'range', 'convey', 'frightened', 'innocence', 'one', 'want', 'hug', 'Slimmed', 'down', 'entirely', 'zaftig', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'days', 'Renee', 'got', 'coulda', 'been', 'contender', 'torch', 'singer', 'par', 'excellence.Wild', 'big', 'bold', '20s-style', 'sets', '21st-century', 'over-the-top', 'editing', 'Chicago', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'well', 'seeing', 'more', 'once']",Chicago

Chicago is a satire musical, satire meaning over-the-top, impossible, just hilarious stuff.  There is no doubt this movie has a dark side to it, but the music is so good and the actors pull everything off beautifully.I have to say that &quot;Velma&quot;(Catherine Zeta Jones)really steals the show here, even more than Richard Gere does.  Aparently Catherine has been in theatre and done musicals before, it shows.  She has this incredible flow and energy out there, she would lite up a stage no doubt about it.  There was basically no weak link in this cast at all, they all suprised me.  Who knew that Renee Zwelleger, Richard Gere /Katherine Zeta could sing so well!!  They really suprised me in this movie.The best aspect of the movie by far is the way the dream sequences and regular scenes are blended together so well, they flow right into one another.  People just do not bust out into song, you know it is coming and feels right at the time.  This method could have been butchered, sloppy and disaterious for the movie, but they pulled it off wonderfully.  The electricity that is required in a live musical is here and grabs your towards the screen, of course the short costumes help also.I liked the set designs, it had the look of the 20's and the feel of it.  The craziness of the times was there on screen and it added the finishing touch to the movie.As I said before, this is a satire.  A satire basically pokes fun at a subject, the impossible and outlandish are required for it.  Try not too take the plot too seriously and just enjoy it.  There are actually truths to this plot, while they are exaggerated, they are still there.Overall a masterpiece of a musical, funny, well thought out and the music just makes the movie come alive.

605806,A303AR58MOOYAV,B00005JLSE,"Woofboy ""Woofboy""","[1, 1]","Personally I'm not a fan of new musicals.  I don't mind old musicals from the 50s like Singing in the Rain, but when a new movie comes out that's a musical, I just think it's kind of weird in modern film-making, even if the movie is based on a Broadway show.  Remember to take that into consideration about my review, because it probably means the movies better than what I say.Based on the Broadway show, ""Chicago"" was about Roxy Hart, who got arrested for shooting and killing the man she was cheating on her husband with.  She then goes to prison, and with some help from Mama (Queen Latifa) and her lawyer (Richard Gere), she is able to win the public's support, lie her way through her court trial, and become a famous Vaudeville actress.The musical parts of this movie were the highlight, even though the music wasn't your typical Danny Elfman (based his music on the original from the broadway show).  The musical sections would come in as Roxy would imagine an alternate reality where she was a famous singer, and the whole story was a show.  The highlights of the best musical scenes were where everyone was Richard Gere's puppet, and he did the talking for Roxy and a croud of reporters.  This was probably one of the most fun scenes in the movie, but the Circus/Courtroom scene was also very well done.  It switched flawlessly from reality to Roxy's imagination.Like I said, I don't like most musicals, so my rating may be lower than it would be if I loved musicals, but overall, I'll give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.  Pretty good if you ask me from someone who doesn't like musicals.",4,I'm not a fan of musicals but...,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1596,"['Personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'new', 'musicals', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'old', 'musicals', '50s', 'Singing', 'Rain', 'when', 'new', 'movie', 'out', 'musical', 'just', 'think', 'kind', 'weird', 'modern', 'film-making', 'even', 'movie', 'based', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Remember', 'take', 'consideration', 'review', 'probably', 'movies', 'better', 'what', 'say.Based', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Chicago', 'was', 'Roxy', 'Hart', 'who', 'got', 'arrested', 'shooting', 'killing', 'man', 'was', 'cheating', 'husband', 'then', 'prison', 'help', 'Mama', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'lawyer', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'able', 'win', 'public', 'support', 'lie', 'way', 'court', 'trial', 'become', 'famous', 'Vaudeville', 'actress.The', 'musical', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'highlight', 'even', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'based', 'music', 'original', 'broadway', 'show', 'musical', 'sections', 'would', 'come', 'Roxy', 'would', 'imagine', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'was', 'famous', 'singer', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'show', 'highlights', 'best', 'musical', 'scenes', 'were', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'puppet', 'did', 'talking', 'Roxy', 'croud', 'reporters', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Circus/Courtroom', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'switched', 'flawlessly', 'reality', 'Roxy', 'imagination.Like', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'most', 'musicals', 'rating', 'may', 'be', 'lower', 'would', 'be', 'loved', 'musicals', 'overall', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Pretty', 'good', 'ask', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'musicals']",Chicago
