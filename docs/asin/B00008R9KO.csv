746784,A3UCBB9XD1SVK0,B00008R9KO,"John Frame ""There Is No Substitute For Equality""","[2, 2]","Tonight as a Halloween treat for myself I watched the 1987 Wayne Wang thriller ""Slam Dance"" for the first time. Opening with Stan Ridgway's ""Bing Can't Walk"" sets a distinctly haunting and powerful mood for a beautifully filmed and engaging piece which has a magnificent sound design throughout. Tom Hulce is at the top of his game in the lead role, winning our affection for his character when those around him find it nigh on impossible. He even reprises his mad Amadeus giggle (for one scene only). Adam Ant puts in a highly creditable performance as a cad. Mitchell Froom provides the bulk of the music and production and must be quite proud of the result. Slam Dance is in the same league as ""Wild At Heart"" - and makes for a suitably challenging 90 minutes of cinematic assault.",5,"haunting and powerful, beautifully filmed, magnificent sound design",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,784,"['Tonight', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'watched', '1987', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'thriller', 'Slam', 'Dance', 'first', 'time', 'Opening', 'Stan', 'Ridgway', 'Bing', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Walk', 'distinctly', 'haunting', 'powerful', 'mood', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'engaging', 'piece', 'magnificent', 'sound', 'design', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'top', 'game', 'lead', 'role', 'winning', 'affection', 'character', 'when', 'find', 'nigh', 'impossible', 'even', 'mad', 'Amadeus', 'giggle', 'one', 'scene', 'only', 'Adam', 'Ant', 'highly', 'creditable', 'performance', 'cad', 'Mitchell', 'Froom', 'bulk', 'music', 'production', 'must', 'be', 'quite', 'proud', 'result', 'Slam', 'Dance', 'same', 'league', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'suitably', 'challenging', '90', 'minutes', 'cinematic', 'assault']",N/A

746786,A1R283L4SH4UP8,B00008R9KO,Magpie,"[4, 5]","Slam Dance tells the story of a Los Angeles loser named Drood who looks like Amadeus and draws unfunny cartoons for a living. He has an ex-wife with an out-of-control perm who works in a day care with a bunch of kids that look like they take the short bus (one of them hits Drood in the crotch with a rubber chicken). He also has a little daughter named Bean who likes him to take his teeth out and runs in during inappropriate moments like when Drood mistakes a nude prostitute for a secretary (don't ask).Drood is cool enough at least to have Adam Ant play his best friend. Adam doesn't do a whole hell of a lot in this movie except wear late 80s mod clothes and come out with bad jokes like ""How many surrealist painters does it take to screw in a lightbulb? The fish.""It seems that before the movie started Drood was involved with a mysterious blond played by Virginia Madsen, who made an 80s career out of playing mysterious blonds before she was in ""Candyman."" She was recently resurrected from the dead for the movie ""Sideways"" and earned an Oscar nomination for it. I'm glad the Academy is no longer prejudiced against walking corpses. But I digress. Virginia isn't in the movie very much except in flashback sequences and a reoccurring photograph where she's smiling at two men facing her wearing scuba masks looking like they're going to pee on her. But hey, she got on the DVD cover!!! She's been murdered and Drood is the main suspect. I guess because he slept with her. Among his other problems, Drood keeps getting stalked by a skinny guy wearing sunglasses and a red Members Only jacket. The guy beats up Drood a lot and sticks a gun in his face while saying stuff like ""she thought you were so smart."" Alluding to the concept that he knew the mysterious blond.Flashbacks seem to be the main way Wang tells the story. And he makes that very clear about 20 minutes into the movie. Problem is, the flashbacks he's showing are things that we, the audience, viewed in the first 20 minutes as well. Why does he feel a need to show us these things again? It actually doesn't help the plot along and it just makes the movie longer. Maybe that's the point. Because actually there really isn't much of a plot to sustain the running time. To fill the gaps Wang uses the aforementioned flashbacks, music montages, and long gaps between dialogue bits. The dialogue is sparse in this film which is effective for two reasons, one because it helps to maintain the strange atmosphere (which the film has plenty of) but also because the dialogue sucks, so the less of it the better. One example:Drood: Are you going to help me or not?Adam Ant: No! You're a selfish f%@k! I'm calling the police.Drood: Let me borrow your car.Adam Ant: No.Drood: Give me the keys.Adam Ant: No.Drood: I said give me the f%&king; keys!!You get the point. Somehow I don't think Wang was too concerned about the dialogue, he was more concerned about being stylish. And in that he succeeds. The film ultimately makes no sense but Wang uses a lot of deliberate pausing, an effective score, and great photography to wrap around a crappy script. Hey, it worked for me, I own it. It's a great film to have on when you want to go brain-dead or when you're playing the game, ""Zombies."" Other than that, forget it.",4,A MOVIE THAT STARS TOM HULCE.....REMEMBER HIM?,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3281,"['Slam', 'Dance', 'story', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'loser', 'named', 'Drood', 'who', 'Amadeus', 'draws', 'unfunny', 'cartoons', 'living', 'ex-wife', 'out-of-control', 'perm', 'who', 'day', 'care', 'bunch', 'kids', 'look', 'take', 'short', 'bus', 'one', 'hits', 'Drood', 'crotch', 'rubber', 'chicken', 'also', 'little', 'daughter', 'named', 'Bean', 'who', 'take', 'teeth', 'out', 'runs', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'when', 'Drood', 'nude', 'prostitute', 'secretary', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', '.Drood', 'cool', 'enough', 'least', 'have', 'Adam', 'Ant', 'play', 'best', 'friend', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'hell', 'lot', 'movie', 'wear', 'late', '80s', 'mod', 'clothes', 'come', 'out', 'bad', 'jokes', 'How', 'many', 'surrealist', 'painters', 'take', 'screw', 'lightbulb', 'fish', 'movie', 'started', 'Drood', 'was', 'involved', 'mysterious', 'blond', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'who', 'made', '80s', 'career', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'blonds', 'was', 'Candyman', 'was', 'recently', 'resurrected', 'dead', 'movie', 'Sideways', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Academy', 'no', 'longer', 'prejudiced', 'walking', 'corpses', 'digress', 'Virginia', ""n't"", 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'reoccurring', 'photograph', 'where', 'smiling', 'two', 'men', 'facing', 'wearing', 'scuba', 'masks', 'looking', ""'re"", 'going', 'pee', 'hey', 'got', 'DVD', 'cover', 'been', 'murdered', 'Drood', 'main', 'suspect', 'guess', 'slept', 'other', 'problems', 'Drood', 'getting', 'stalked', 'skinny', 'guy', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'red', 'Members', 'Only', 'jacket', 'guy', 'up', 'Drood', 'lot', 'gun', 'face', 'saying', 'stuff', 'thought', 'were', 'so', 'smart', 'Alluding', 'concept', 'knew', 'mysterious', 'blond.Flashbacks', 'seem', 'be', 'main', 'way', 'Wang', 'story', 'very', 'clear', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Problem', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'are', 'things', 'audience', 'viewed', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'as', 'well', 'Why', 'feel', 'need', 'show', 'things', 'again', 'actually', ""n't"", 'help', 'plot', 'just', 'movie', 'longer', 'Maybe', 'point', 'actually', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'sustain', 'running', 'time', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Wang', 'aforementioned', 'flashbacks', 'music', 'montages', 'long', 'gaps', 'dialogue', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'sparse', 'film', 'effective', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'maintain', 'strange', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'plenty', 'also', 'dialogue', 'sucks', 'less', 'better', 'One', 'example', 'Drood', 'Are', 'going', 'help', 'not', 'Adam', 'Ant', ""'re"", 'selfish', 'f', '%', '@', 'k', ""'m"", 'calling', 'police.Drood', 'Let', 'borrow', 'car.Adam', 'Ant', 'No.Drood', 'Give', 'keys.Adam', 'Ant', 'No.Drood', 'said', 'give', 'f', '%', 'king', 'get', 'point', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Wang', 'was', 'too', 'concerned', 'dialogue', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'being', 'stylish', 'film', 'ultimately', 'sense', 'Wang', 'lot', 'deliberate', 'pausing', 'effective', 'score', 'great', 'photography', 'wrap', 'around', 'crappy', 'script', 'Hey', 'worked', 'own', 'great', 'film', 'have', 'when', 'want', 'go', 'brain-dead', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'game', 'Zombies', 'Other', 'forget']",N/A
