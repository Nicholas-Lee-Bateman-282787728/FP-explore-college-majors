506200,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B00000JKNV,Aion,"[0, 2]","Before the third and final Tenchi movie, Tenchi as a whole had been hit and miss for me, ranging from 7/10 to 8/10 in terms of ratings. I enjoyed the first two OVA series but quickly grew tired of all the silliness and the lack of explanations with regards to various plot elements. It started to get stale after the harem cast had been assembled. My thoughts about the first two movies are very similar to my thoughts about the OVA. So, I didn't go into what's most likely going to be the last Tenchi anime I watch expecting anything other than the usual harem fluff, with a random, one dimensional villain thrown in so that there would be a fight to end it with a sense of purpose.It ended up surpassing my expectations by some distance. I found it to be emotionally moving and involving - I couldn't help but care about the characters. However, it isn't something for Tenchi fans; it's for fans of well written and executed films. It has a low MAL rating - on par with the Christmas special of a second film - and I understand why without even asking anyone: because it lacks the feel of the other Tenchi anime in existence. If what came before is classed as Tenchi for the younger generation, then this is most certainly Tenchi for adults.To start with, the art differs from the art of the previous films, both of which looking like the OVA series. I wouldn't say the previous art looks cartoony but it doesn't exactly look realistic either. The intention was clearly to make this installment more realistic to go with the story, and they started by altering the art. The faces look more realistic, the size/proportions of the characters look more realistic... everything apart from the ears and eyes looks realistic. This is a weird complaint to have but the ears bothered me, Ryoko's bothering me the most. Instead of having ears, it looks like a number of characters have rectangles stuck to the sides of their heads. I'm not sure if Ryoko always had rectangled for ears and the different art style simply made me notice, but whoever designed the ears deserves to be shot. Repeatedly.The music also differs considerably from what's gone before, changing to fit with the new direction. In the past fitting but uninspiring and unmemorable efforts good for comedy were used, but in this there are drama orientated instrumental pieces. Even '&Eacute;tude No.3' - the famous piano piece - plays towards the end....Anyway, getting back on track. The story starts in normal Tenchi style; with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting like cat and dog and Tenchi getting involved. But within minutes (literally), Tenchi randomly stumbles upon a tree and, enchanted by its beauty, walks toward it. He then gets taken somewhere by a mysterious woman who appears before him.The plot than fast-forwards six months. Tenchi has been missing and his harem have split up to search for him. Ayeka and Ryoko, who have teamed up, have managed to find out the city he's living in thanks to Washu and they work as waitresses while living there to pay the bills. Ryoko has a watch that alerts her to Tenchi's presence but hasn't had any luck finding him.It's soon revealed that an older looking Tenchi, complete with long hair, has been living with the woman who appeared before him at the start. The woman is called Haruna and Tenchi has lost all of his memories. And when I say living together, I mean they live together as a couple, doing what couples do when alone. It's normal for anything sexual in a harem to be used only for comical purposes, without any actual sexual intercourse taking place, but there's nothing comical about Tenchi and Haruna's relationship. They're shown together in bed, naked, with Haruna on top of Tenchi early on and later Haruna moves herself slowly up Tenchi whilst he lies down, grinding her body against his.I'm mentioning this and going into detail because it highlights the different audience the film is aimed at. Sex goes from being childish to being handled in a far more mature fashion. That's quite a jump for what was, before this attempt, a simple and straight-forward harem story involving alien ladies.Once it's clear how Tenchi's living, the plot starts moving slower. The first twenty minutes flew by - I was surprised by the pacing - but then everything slowed down for character development. Ayeka and Ryoko become more and more depressed with every glimpse of Tenchi happy; oblivious to their existence. Despite them being rivals for Tenchi's affection when down in the dumps, rather than fight over Tenchi, they support each other. Ryoko pushes Ayeka's buttons when she's on the verge giving up and Ayeka tries to do the same for Ryoko. It's fair to say their friendship and not the rivalry they're known for shines through in the film.All of the other development is, as you'd expected, Tenchi and Haruna development, mixed in with some Yosho (Tenchi's grandfather) development because of his connection to Haruna. The other cast members basically just make cameo appearances. Tenchi comes across differently than the plain harem lead type from before; he's far more troubled and always deep in thought, drawing in an attempt to express himself and the memories that lurk in the back of his mind. Haruna, who is the villain of the story, tries to keep Tenchi ignorant in an attempt to keep him close to her and ease her lonliness. Rather than being yet another one dimensional Tenchi baddie, she's well developed and by the end you can't help but feel sorry for her.The important characters all receive lots of development, and the story even fills in some small Yosho related holes. The only serous flaw is that, as I mentioned before, it doesn't have the same vibe as the other Tenchi anime. It's very serious, focusing almost fully on drama. There are very few comedy scenes and the cast only gets together at the end. If I was someone who loved Tenchi for being light-hearted fun, I wouldn't be best pleased, so I can understand the problem people have with it... but I'm not one of those people and I respect those in charge for trying something different.Overall, watching the film was an excellent way to end my Tenchi love affair. I was expecting to end it with yet another 7/10 rating, but I ended up awarding it 9/10 and actually thinking highly of a Tenchi offering. To anyone other than diehard Tenchi fans who can't accept change, I strongly recommend it.Rating: 9/10",5,Tenchi: Adult Edition,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,6405,"['third', 'final', 'Tenchi',

506202,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00000JKNV,Amber,"[1, 1]","Others have talked about the plot, so I will focus on other things. Such as the art. The art style has changed once again, but for the better. The colors are bright and solid where need be, and dark and brooding at the right times. The motions the characters make really look lifelike, as do some of the people, especially Haruna and Tenchi. And the dialogue is wonderful--not really as sappy as you think, but that made it even more moving. Love is expressed here in the simple ways of real people; meeting for lunch, or going shopping, or just spending an evening together. Tenchi doesn't save her from a world-dominating madman or a monster or an alien bent on revenge. And she acts a lot more human than many anime women I've seen. She seduces Tenchi whenever she feels his mind is wandering away from her and her world, and also is not above using her tears to get him to swing back over to her. She is excited to get the ring, jealous over the appearances of Ryoko and Ayeka, and becomes angry and vengeful when the two rescuers of Tenchi dare invade her world. She loves, she hates, she's petty at times, and that makes me love this movie even more. It's a fresh change from characters that show no emotion (though they have their place too) and characters that are consistently happy or sad or angry or whatever.The tone of this movie is darker, but that is because it is necessary. Tenchi is aged quite a bit by Haruna, and so he is no longer acting like a clumsy teenager, but a mature young man. Haruna is a vengeful (wouldn't you like to know), and her methods show that. Yosho shows his wisdom and judgment, and even Ryoko and Ayeka grow up a little and actually become friends.I loved this movie, especially since the tv series got a little too goofy for my tastes sometimes. My favorite dvd of all time is the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X OVA Trust and betrayal, and I think that influenced my feelings a bit. I just go for the dramatic, makes-you-cry-at-the-end films.Anyway, I recommend this to any fan of the more mature, thought-provoking anime.

506203,AQP4I2WWHPI0Z,B00000JKNV,"Anthony Fielding ""Smegger""","[2, 2]","For me, the anime Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi universe are great. Wonderful stories and characters, the best being Ryoko. The movies, which are based on Tenchi Universe, are also excellent, though Tenchi: the daughter of darkness felt like one extended episode. But, i'm here to review a beautifully animated film, called tenchi forever, the third, and unfortunatley, final film for the Tenchi Universe series. The story is wonderful, the animation is some of the best i've seen in an anime, and the relationship with Ryoko and Ayeka is interesting to behold.For any Tenchi fans expecting the action/comedy normally associated with all the series, this is a simple love story, with enough sci-fi elements to keep you happy. I felt this is the art film, to show Tenchi can be a more serious franchise when it wants. Though i said the animation was wonderful, i missed the original look of the characters, from the OVA and Universe series, and even in the first Tenchi film. Though thats just a bit of nit picking. Now here's my real problem with the film, since it's the last of the Tenchi Universe saga. It's the end (spoiler). In the beginning of the film, Ryoko and Ayeka tell Tenchi to choose who he cares for most. Then he runs of in to the forest and vanishes. Ryoko and Ayeka search for him. Tenchi is much older and living with a strange woman and Tenchi is an Art student, with no memory of who he really is, but he keeps drawing a face on a canvas, and the face is Ryokos. Hint there that shes the one he cares for. Now at the end, Tenchi and Ryoko have this moment, but its only a hint that he has shown her he likes her, then it finishes. It's one of those endings where you're going to have to imagine, and i hate them. I wish they'd do a 4th, just to give us the answer we want. I only just got it, and was waiting to watch it for four years (since 2000), so maybe i spoiled it for myself because of the hype surrounding it, and building my hopes up. But hey, it's still a great film, and a must for Tenchi fans. Just don't expect a clear answer, if an answer at all, to who Tenchio really cares for (i really do hope he told Ryoko he loves her).Anyway, look out for the third OVA series, which will give you an answer on who Tenchi cares for. As the OVA is the original Tenchi series, and Tenchi Universe is based on that series, I hope the OVA does a better job of the love story the Universe, and gives you a clear cut answer.

506204,A3B249FQ2OJBCQ,B00000JKNV,"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy""","[0, 0]","This is the third Tenchi movie and the second one in the ""Tenchi Universe"" continuity.  The movie starts out as a standard Tenchi fare with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting over a broom.  They rush to Tenchi to resolve the dispute which he is loathe to do.  Finally, Ayeka has had enough and demands Tenchi choose between herself and Ryoko -- which girl does he want to be with?  Tenchi doesn't want to hurt either girl so he distracts them and runs off into the woods where he disappears into a tree.Six months later, Tenchi is still missing and everyone is searching.  Sasami returns to Jurai to use their network.  Washu uses her vast scientific knowledge and resources, enlisting Kiyone and Mihoshi to assist her.  Finally, Ryoko and Ayeka put aside their differences and head to Tokyo where Washu has determined Tenchi to be.While this starts as a standard Tenchi fare, this quickly turns into a serious tale of maturity, love, and loss.  People who enjoyed the various Tenchi sagas for their humor may be put off by this movie.  However, if you can accept this as a serious story, it is a very good one.  Watching all of the girls in the Masaki household putting everything aside for Tenchi is very touching, especially when it comes to Ayeka and Ryoko working well together.As I mention in my title, Tenchi does choose between the girls, but not in a way that some might expect. Personally, I think Tenchi made his choice in the ""Tenchi Universe"" series.  As we are shown Tenchi's new life where he can't remember his past, one girl continues to come to his mind.  He draws her and paints her though he doesn't remember her.  As to the girls, one conceeds defeat in order to save Tenchi while the other takes one more chance to rescue Tenchi despite the danger not to mention apparently being rejected earlier.Bottom line:  As a story, this one is truely a good one.

This was my second Tenchi DVD purchase; the first was the Tenchi Muyo OAV DVD boxed set. I'm a true fan of anime and tape every Toonami episode of Tenchi and Gundam Wing. With the bar already set by the OAVs, the Tenchi movie didn't disappoint. The quality of the animation is better than I'd hoped, and the 5.1 digital sound isn't bad either. From an objective standpoint, the DVD has 5.1 audio in both English and Japanese. I prefer the Japanese, as this is the format I grew up with.

506208,A3CYIPLD9090ZK,B00000JKNV,David Baker,"[29, 30]","I've heard that this is the final chapter to the Tenchi Muyo! saga I cherish so deeply... and then I heard that there's another OAV series in the making, which practically made me do cartwheels. Either way, I guess that's irrelevant since I'm reviewing this movie... but let it be known I'm VERY happy about learning this. Anyways, since everyone's already given the whole story away, I guess I'll do the same, heh. At the beginning of the film, Tenchi and the gang are sweeping at the Masaki shrine, and, as usual, Ryoko and Ayeka start fighting... this time, about a broom. They continue to argue until they want to settle it once and for all: they demand to know who Tenchi really loves. Tenchi does the sensible thing: he runs like hell. After taking off faster than Michael Johnson at the Olympics, he runs up to a tree that pulls him in... and he completely disappears. Next thing you know, it's six months later, and Tenchi's still missing. Tenchi isn't really missing though, he's in another world, a fantasy world, if you will. Difference being, he's older... and with another woman, Haruna, who created this alternate world. Ryoko and Ayeka are still looking for him all this time, and when they finally do see him (thanks to Washu and her Tenchi-tracker), he doesn't see them, he doesn't hear them, and he disappears yet again... and again and again. After this happens a few times, Tenchi goes into the little diner the two are working at (!), and he sits with his mystery woman at a booth. Ryoko and Ayeka still can't get to him though, even when Ryoko goes to grab him, her arms just go right through him. Of course, Haruna can see the two, and looks none too pleased about them, either. Ryoko and Ayeka learn from Washu, that the two worlds intertwine at times, due to Tenchi's lingering memory, allowing them to see him. With a little assist from Washu (and Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Tenchi's grandfather, Yosho [or whatever he's calling himself these days]), the two can go into that dimension allowing Tenchi to see them... of course, Haruna kidnapped and brainwased Tenchi in the first place, and it deosn't take a scientific genius like Washu to figure out she's not gonna to give him up so willingly. The story of Tenchi Forever: Tenchi The Movie III is as solid as a love story gets. In fact, it's THE best love story I have ever seen. I know what you're thinking: &quot;Wha?! A love story?! But this is Tenchi Muyo!, not Titanic!&quot; Oh, how very true, but unlike Titanic, you'll actually love this story, it's very heart-warming, sad, and beautiful all at the same time. What made the Tenchi Muyo! saga popular--the humor--is completely missing in this film. Even the fight scenes got as much time as the romace aspects in the Tenchi Muyo! saga... just not in this movie. I think the only time I laughed was when I saw Washu's devices to open up the parallel dimension for Ryoko an Ayeka, and even then, I didn't exactly roll in laughter (I chuckled). And guess what? There were no battles at all. The story is deeply rooted in romance, and honestly, I would not have wanted it any other way: the romance was why I loved this film so much. The character development in Tenchi Forever (Ryoko's, Ayeka's, Haruna's, and Tenchi's and his grandpa's, to be specific) shines with depth, personality, and lots of real emotion (they always have, but not quite like this). You REALLY feel sorry for Ryoko and Ayeka throughout this film. I hated Haruna at first: &quot;Hey... why'd she kidnap and brainwash the Tenchinator? Hey! She seduced Tenchi! HEY!!! She gave an evil grin to my Ryoko! Grrr!&quot; This, obviously, proves that she made one great villian... or was Haruna even a villian? No, she isn't really a villian at all. At the end of the film, you feel for Haruna as well, she's like all of us, in a way... she just doesn't want to be alone (something we all can relate to). The way she came about, through Yosho's past, was utterly brilliant. Even though her character only came out in this one film, she was very well constructed and held her own with the main characters. It just goes to show how beautifully written this story really is. When I think back on the story as a whole, it's actually pretty sad (not as sad as, say, Grave Of The Fireflies [which I admit to crying like a little girl after viewing], but sad nonetheless). The part were Ryoko goes back for me (err, I mean Tenchi, heh... sorry, wrong fantasy world there...) one last time was really touching. Okay... so what about the animation and dubbing, you ask? Well, the animation is beautiful. It's not as rich in detail as some of the other movie epics (Akira, Ghost In The Shell, etc.), but it's very colorful and looks just amazing. The rich backgrounds and vibrant colors really make this film come to life. The characters look a lot better here too compared to the previous Tenchi Muyo! stuff, which is always a nice bonus. The dubbing is absolutely flawless, not once did I think &quot;This is great, but it would be better if this character shut their mouth when the voice comes out right there&quot; like so many of us do to other anime titles (*cough-Sailor Moon-cough*). The voice actors aren't just actors, they really seem like they are their own character--why can't all anime dubbing be like this? *sigh* Thank Pioneer for actually caring about their products... they did one really amazing job here, folks. Even the film's soundtrack is amazing (a really nice change from the lame J-pop that usually accompanies anime), there's some very beautiful piano work to this film. Anyways, to sum it up, the animation is bright and colorful, top-notch stuff; and the dubbing is better than perfect. After watching Tenchi Forever: Tenchi The Movie III I came to one conclusion: this is the second best anime movie I have ever seen (first being Akira, which, let's face it, will never be topped). I honestly loved this movie that much. The story is beautiful and touching, I'm sure that will put off some people expecting humor and great action, which is one major loss for them... honestly, I have never seen a love story as half as good as this.

506210,A1XC7W5DKT5NY8,B00000JKNV,"eightpointagenda ""Sean""","[0, 5]","First off, let me state this. I have never been a big fan of the Tenchi Universe(no, not the first TV series, but the collection of series as a whole. Hence, &quot;Universe&quot;). However, I still know a good anime when I see one, and frankly, this one missed the boat by long shot.Those who watched the Tenchi series of comedy or action(or both), I warn you now, the latter mentioned things rarely poke their heads out in this Movie(though to me, it really just feels like longer Tenchi episode). So if thats why you found it entertaining, you may want to rent\borrow from a friend before you lay down the cash for this one.Most people say that the romance\WAFF(Warm And Fuzzy Feeling) content gets too much in the way of the plot. I dont think thats the case here at all. The problem is, its just not that interesting. The whole time I was watching it at a friends house, I found my attention driffting to other areas of the room. That right there is a bad sign.That and some other stuff really makes me think this was a waste of celluloid:The drawings(aka:What an eye sore!): The drawings seemed like they have always been decreasing since the end of the OAV. This is no execption. Some say its a different artistic experesion. Well, whatever it was, I don't like it.The Pair(you know who I am talking about): I think my biggest turnoffs of this series(and this &quot;movie&quot;) are still Ryoko and Ayeka. Though for the most part, their abusive-to-one-another behavior to eachother has been toned down, they are still there. They still bring back bad memories. They still agravate me.The lack of supporting cast: The main reason that I liked some of the Universe was because of the supporting cast(i.e. Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone etc.) Because of their lack of the non-stop infatuation with Tenchi, I became more tolerant of them then I did of &quot;the pair&quot;. However, all of them really play a very small part in the film, and basically making them time filler. Yet another frustration.And finally; the plot itself: With the lack of an interesting plot, the film became tiresome very quickly. Some people say give it some time. I watched it thru. I found nothing redeming about it at all. And worse yet, I can barely remember what the hell the plot was. That's not a good sign of good production. But since I have very little interest in the series in the first place, the balance of this review becomes lopsided(I am not trying to be bias, but rather look at this from an Otaku point of view.

One has to be well immersed in the Tenchi universe to truly undrstand this  movie. Having said let's get on with the review.First off, I noted that  the animation was &quot;different&quot;. Nothing truley drastic, but all  the charachters had a rather distinct look to them, and that in itself  wasn't a bad thing, since the particular style complimented the serious  plotline. But the story itself is where the problem lay. Now, don't get me  wrong, I'm a Tenchi fan, but ANYBODY who gives this movie FIVE STARS has a  real objectivity problem. The first movie was extraordinary, the second a  good effort, but this, *THIS* is pointless meandering; nothing truley  develops and the whole movie drags ( and to those who accuse me of having  Ninja Scroll-itis, i.e. Dragon Ball Syndrome, let it be known I liked both  PATLABOR movies, which are very long and dry indeed ). The story revolves  around Tenchi being searched for by his friends and family which basically  take up the majority of the movie. Nothing REALLY happens during this time;  Sasami goes of to Jurai, Washu is on her computer ( of course ), and Kiyone  and Mihoshi head to the Science Academy to steal vital parts &amp;  information for Tenchi's search . All these tasks seems to be more of a  gesture for the fans than anything, for all they really are is an excuse to  show off the series' many charchters. The real action ( if one can call it  that ) is with Ryoko and Akane's search in Tokyo, where they, inevitably,  become very emotional over Tenchi's dissapearance. In the meanwhile, Tenchi  is with Haruna, and nothing is really happening there either. I wouldn't  mind the lack of action and lack of comedy, but nothing EVER truley  develops. On the plus side the ending with Yosho is very cool ( &quot;don't  be jealous&quot; ) and the movie hints where Tenchi's heart might lay.  Unfortunatley, this little tidbit is marred by the movie's static plot and  equally sluggish pacing.",2,Hopefully NOT the last Tenchi movie,948326400,"01 20, 2000",2000,2101,"['go', 'off', 'rant', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'OVA', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'tv', 'series-', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'GO', 'NEAR', 'THIS', 'One', 'be', 'well', 'immersed', 'Tenchi', 'universe', 'truly', 'undrstand', 'movie', 'Having', 'said', 'let', 'get', 'review.First', 'noted', 'animation', 'was', 'quot', 'different', 'quot', 'Nothing', 'truley', 'drastic', 'charachters', 'had', 'rather', 'distinct', 'look', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'particular', 'style', 'complimented', 'serious', 'plotline', 'story', 'where', 'problem', 'lay', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'ANYBODY', 'who', 'movie', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'real', 'objectivity', 'problem', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'second', 'good', 'effort', 'pointless', 'meandering', 'nothing', 'truley', 'develops', 'whole', 'movie', 'drags', 'who', 'accuse', 'having', 'Ninja', 'Scroll-itis', 'i.e', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Syndrome', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'liked', 'PATLABOR', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'long', 'dry', 'indeed', 'story', 'around', 'Tenchi', 'being', 'searched', 'friends', 'family', 'basically', 'take', 'up', 'majority', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'REALLY', 'time', 'Sasami', 'Jurai', 'Washu', 'computer', 'course', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'head', 'Science', 'Academy', 'steal', 'vital', 'parts', 'amp', 'information', 'Tenchi', 'search', 'tasks', 'be', 'more', 'gesture', 'fans', 'anything', 'really', 'are', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'series', 'many', 'charchters', 'real', 'action', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'Ryoko', 'Akane', 'search', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'inevitably', 'become', 'very', 'emotional', 'Tenchi', 'dissapearance', 'meanwhile', 'Tenchi', 'Haruna', 'nothing', 'really', 'happening', 'there', 'either', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lack', 'action', 'lack', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'EVER', 'truley', 'develops', 'plus', 'side', 'ending', 'Yosho', 'very', 'cool', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'jealous', 'quot', 'movie', 'hints', 'where', 'Tenchi', 'heart', 'might', 'lay', 'Unfortunatley', 'little', 'tidbit', 'marred', 'movie', 'static', 'plot', 'equally', 'sluggish', 'pacing']",Tenchi Forever VHS

There were moments that the music did overshadow the film, but  on a whole, it fit the picture very nicely.  I think that the  &quot;chase&quot; music fit the emotions of the girls on their hunt for  Tenchi very well.The main &quot;Evil&quot; character is not evil at all,  and she only truly wants Tenchi to be happy.  And if that means taking him  away from the constant bickering of Ayeka and Ryoko, then so be it.Over the course of the film, however, both the haughty princess and the  mischevious space pirate learn how to control their rivalry and even build  a friendship and team together.If you are looking for the entire Tenchi  gang, then you'd be better of watching the first movie, as this one focuses  on Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi.  The rest of the cast make small appearances,  but in no way comparable to the first two movies.In the end, I feel that  the final scene shows Tenchi making his choice between the two women, whose  demand fr a decision is what started this whole problem in the first place.

506223,AEGR7IBHUM3R7,B00000JKNV,mp,"[8, 11]","&quot;Tenchi Forever&quot; is exactly what a Tenchi movie should be.  Each of the three anime series all feature a splendid mixture of clever dialogue, slapstick comedy, involving storylines, and most of all, well-developed characters.  The last of these is the focus of &quot;Tenchi Forever,&quot; more than in either &quot;Tenchi Muyo in Love&quot; or &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot;.  While both of these are great movies in their own right, it is only in &quot;Forever&quot; that character drives the plot, giving us an extremely intense look into the four characters around which the Tenchi Universe revolves - To wit, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Katsuhito.In fact, one might go so far as to say that &quot;Tenchi Forever&quot; is really about the interesting relationship between Ryoko and Ayeka, the two women who are engaged in an interminable battle for Tenchi's affections.  Taking off from their love/hate relationship in &quot;Tenchi Universe,&quot; in &quot;Forever,&quot; we see two women whose fight over Tenchi has developed into a touching and interdependent friendship with each other.  Gone are the whiny Ayeka and overtly aggressive Ryoko - both have become strong-willed, independent, and assertive women.  This is the result of great writing and a great story.&quot;Tenchi Forever&quot; begins in true Tenchi fashion with Ryoko and Ayeka fighting over Tenchi, and demanding that he make a choice between them.  Trying to avoid the normal confrontation, Tenchi flees to the Masaki shrine, where an image of Haruna entrances Tenchi, and leading him into another dimension.  Ayeka and Ryoko move to Tokyo, where they are prime agents in the search for Tenchi.  Unlike the other Tenchi movies and series, in &quot;Forever,&quot; the supporting cast is just that - the roles of Washu, Nobuyuki, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Sasami are extremely limited and are each dedicated to assisting Ryoko and Ayeka's efforts.The subtext of the movie involves Katsuhito, Tenchi's grandfather - can he reconcile himself with his past?  What is his involvement in Tenchi's disappearance?  Why has Haruna taken Tenchi?  With Washu's genius, the technology of Jurai, and the industry of Ryoko and Ayeka, are the pooled resources of Tenchi's family enough to bring him home and to himself?The animation style of &quot;Forever&quot; is slightly different from any of the series, a kind of blend between the classic Muyo/Universe and the more distinct &quot;Tokyo&quot;.  It is fitting, though, since this is a different kind of movie - the characters are drawn and animated more like actual people, rather than as cartoon characters.  With a more adult-oriented storyline, it is entirely appropriate that the animation be altered to match.  The movie's musical score reflects this shift also, largely piano driven, evoking a kind of film-noir feel throughout the picture.  &quot;Tenchi Forever&quot; moves slowly, it is true, which may disconcert some, but for the true Tenchi fan, it is a brilliant end to the adventures of Tenchi, if it is indeed the end...",5,The Best and Most Moving of the Tenchi Movies,991872000,"06 7, 2001",2001,3050,"['quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'exactly', 'what', 'Tenchi', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'three', 'anime', 'series', 'feature', 'splendid', 'mixture', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'involving', 'storylines', 'most', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'last', 'focus', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'more', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'quot', 'quot', 'Daughter', 'Darkness', 'quot', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'own', 'right', 'only', 'quot', 'Forever', 'quot', 'character', 'plot', 'giving', 'extremely', 'intense', 'look', 'four', 'characters', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'wit', 'Tenchi', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'Katsuhito.In', 'fact', 'one', 'might', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'really', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'engaged', 'interminable', 'battle', 'Tenchi', 'affections', 'Taking', 'off', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'quot', 'quot', 'Forever', 'quot', 'see', 'two', 'women', 'fight', 'Tenchi', 'developed', 'touching', 'interdependent', 'friendship', 'other', 'Gone', 'are', 'whiny', 'Ayeka', 'overtly', 'aggressive', 'Ryoko', 'have', 'become', 'strong-willed', 'independent', 'assertive', 'women', 'result', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'story.', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'true', 'Tenchi', 'fashion', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'fighting', 'Tenchi', 'demanding', 'make', 'choice', 'Trying', 'avoid', 'normal', 'confrontation', 'Tenchi', 'Masaki', 'shrine', 'where', 'image', 'Haruna', 'entrances', 'Tenchi', 'leading', 'dimension', 'Ayeka', 'Ryoko', 'move', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'are', 'prime', 'agents', 'search', 'Tenchi', 'other', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'series', 'quot', 'Forever', 'quot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'roles', 'Washu', 'Nobuyuki', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'Sasami', 'are', 'extremely', 'limited', 'are', 'dedicated', 'assisting', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'efforts.The', 'subtext', 'movie', 'Katsuhito', 'Tenchi', 'grandfather', 'can', 'reconcile', 'past', 'What', 'involvement', 'Tenchi', 'disappearance', 'Why', 'Haruna', 'taken', 'Tenchi', 'Washu', 'genius', 'technology', 'Jurai', 'industry', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'are', 'pooled', 'resources', 'Tenchi', 'family', 'enough', 'bring', 'home', 'animation', 'style', 'quot', 'Forever', 'quot', 'slightly', 'different', 'series', 'kind', 'blend', 'classic', 'Muyo/Universe', 'more', 'distinct', 'quot', 'Tokyo', 'quot', 'fitting', 'though', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'animated', 'more', 'like', 'actual', 'people', 'rather', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'more', 'adult-oriented', 'storyline', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'animation', 'be', 'altered', 'match', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'shift', 'also', 'largely', 'piano', 'driven', 'evoking', 'kind', 'film-noir', 'feel', 'picture', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'moves', 'slowly', 'true', 'may', 'disconcert', 'true', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'brilliant', 'end', 'adventures', 'Tenchi', 'indeed', 'end']",Tenchi Forever VHS

506225,A2LS6A1XNO8Y7,B00000JKNV,Nurse Washu,"[6, 6]","Tenchi Muyo, what is it? It is the series that always keeps you guessing because you never know what's next. And this film is no exception. The Tenchi series is sometimes a sci-fi adventure, sometimes comedy, other times martial arts action, and sometimes a soapy daytime drama. This lastest endeavour falls squarely into the last catagory of a daytime drama, but not in any derogatory sense. I have seen some very wonderful romance stories on daytime dramas, but daytime dramas suffer from fundamental problems - very long and fractured stories - that &quot;Tenchi Forever&quot;/TMIL2 does not. The story here is told completely and proceeds at an even pace, much slower than &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot;, with time for the viewer to savor the emotion of each scene. The story is about three relationships: an old one, a current one, and a new one. The old relationship introduces us to Haruna, Yosho's old flame from his previous life on Planet Jurai. She turns out to the villain in this film, but Haruna is very unlike any previous Tenchi villian. She is not some great ogre, but a likeable, very human person. This is a common device used in daytime dramas - to give the villian redeeming human qualities to keep the viewers guessing about how she turns out in the end (you won't find out from me!). In the new relationship Haruna has drawn Tenchi into her own private world where he cannot recall any of his previous life. This part of the story is exceptionally well done. Theirs is a mature relationship, it has love and romance of course, but unlike Achika and Nobyuki's storybook romance, Tenchi and Haruna also experience anxiety, tension, and conflict. It is surprisingly real and lifelike. The third relationship is the &quot;friendship&quot; between Aeka and Ryoko. It starts out as usual with a fight which causes Tenchi to just want to get away from them. When he doesn't come back (Haruna has taken him) they proceed to search for him together, with a little help from the remaining Tenchi cast. After searching for six months with no luck, Ryoko and Aeka begin to deal with their separation from Tenchi in very different ways. They begin to open up to each other and share their feelings in a way never seen before in Tenchi Muyo. Any Tenchi fan is sure to enjoy seeing Ryoko and Aeka trust each other and become real friends. This film is very different from both TMIL and DOD, even the animation production itself looks more like &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; than either of the previous Tenchi films making this probably the oddest collection of movies I have ever viewed. I can't wait to see what the next Tenchi movie is like, to see if AIC can produce another film completely different from the three we have now.",5,The way Tenchi Muyo romance was meant to be,1006905600,"11 28, 2001",2001,2746,"['Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'what', 'series', 'always', 'guessing', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'film', 'exception', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'sometimes', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'sometimes', 'comedy', 'other', 'times', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'sometimes', 'soapy', 'daytime', 'drama', 'lastest', 'endeavour', 'squarely', 'last', 'catagory', 'daytime', 'drama', 'not', 'derogatory', 'sense', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'wonderful', 'romance', 'stories', 'daytime', 'dramas', 'daytime', 'dramas', 'suffer', 'fundamental', 'problems', 'very', 'long', 'fractured', 'stories', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'quot', 'not', 'story', 'here', 'told', 'completely', 'proceeds', 'even', 'pace', 'much', 'slower', 'quot', 'Daughter', 'Darkness', 'quot', 'time', 'viewer', 'savor', 'emotion', 'scene', 'story', 'three', 'relationships', 'old', 'one', 'current', 'one', 'new', 'one', 'old', 'relationship', 'Haruna', 'Yosho', 'old', 'flame', 'previous', 'life', 'Planet', 'Jurai', 'out', 'villain', 'film', 'Haruna', 'very', 'previous', 'Tenchi', 'villian', 'not', 'great', 'ogre', 'likeable', 'very', 'human', 'person', 'common', 'device', 'used', 'daytime', 'dramas', 'give', 'villian', 'redeeming', 'human', 'qualities', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'how', 'out', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'new', 'relationship', 'Haruna', 'drawn', 'Tenchi', 'own', 'private', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'previous', 'life', 'part', 'story', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'mature', 'relationship', 'love', 'romance', 'course', 'Achika', 'Nobyuki', 'storybook', 'romance', 'Tenchi', 'Haruna', 'also', 'experience', 'anxiety', 'tension', 'conflict', 'surprisingly', 'real', 'lifelike', 'third', 'relationship', 'quot', 'friendship', 'quot', 'Aeka', 'Ryoko', 'out', 'usual', 'fight', 'Tenchi', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'When', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Haruna', 'taken', 'proceed', 'search', 'together', 'little', 'help', 'remaining', 'Tenchi', 'cast', 'searching', 'six', 'months', 'luck', 'Ryoko', 'Aeka', 'begin', 'deal', 'separation', 'Tenchi', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'share', 'feelings', 'way', 'never', 'seen', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Any', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Ryoko', 'Aeka', 'trust', 'other', 'become', 'real', 'friends', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'TMIL', 'DOD', 'even', 'animation', 'production', 'more', 'quot', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'quot', 'previous', 'Tenchi', 'films', 'making', 'probably', 'oddest', 'collection', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'Tenchi', 'movie', 'see', 'AIC', 'can', 'produce', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'three', 'have', 'now']",Tenchi Forever VHS

I agree with the other  reviewers that there is much less slapstick.  But that's OK:  Tenchi has  been around for a few years, and there's only so much Three Stooges humor  that can sustain a franchise.Without spoiling the story, I'll say that  unlike some of the other movies, this one doesn't have an Evil Enemy.  It  is a more thoughtful investigation of how love leads to sadness, and pain.  The artwork is simply stunning.  I highly recommend it.For DVD viewers,  the extras are rather sparse.

Tenchi disappears and they search frantically, fight amongst themselves (which they always do) and are generally worthless.This third movie in the series does definitely move in a different direction than previous movies. No Star-Wars-Like combat here. Art and feelings and different ideas of reality sure but not a whole lot of what has come to be known as typical Tenchi action. A part of what I really love about the Tenchi series is the comedy and the great action scenes - and taking a lot of it away doesn't really work for me.It is great that the directors and artists are trying new things, but I think we get a little too much of the other side of Tenchi Muyo in this movie.

506228,A7FZ9X0B6QBS3,B00000JKNV,Ronald E. Olivier,"[0, 0]","Following the adventures of Tenchi Masaki can be confusing.  There are a number of series, spinoffs, and movies that seem to go in many different directions.  The quality of the storylines and the animation vary widely, from Saturday-morning cartoon cheesy to inspiringly beautiful.  Though the characters are generally likable, there's a certain predictability to them that makes them two-dimensional.  So while Tenchi is a fairly popular title, there's a lot NOT to like, too.But, there are some bright spots, of which Tenchi in Love 2:  Tenchi Forever is definitely the brightest.  First, some of the minor characters play much less of a part in this story.  Kiyone, MiHoshi, and Sasami play such minor roles in the movie, you'd be hard pressed to think they were regulars in the series.  Washu is a bit more visible, but still slightly diminished.  These things actually help to move the story along.Of course, Ryoko and Ayeka are quite visible throughout, but there's a lot less sniping at each other.  In fact, they're quite genial towards each other at times, as they explore many dead-ends in locating Tenchi, who mysteriously vanished from the Masaki estate.  What they don't realize is that he is in an alternate reality in which his old life isn't even a memory.  He's a few years older, and happily living with Haruka, the love of his life.The tone of this movie is a marked departure from the loud and sometimes violent Tenchi that we saw in the Tenchi Universe series and the awful Tenchi Movie 2:  Daughter of Darkness.  Even the decent first movie `Tenchi in Love' used a lot of the familiar elements from the series.  But this movie is a radical departure, and the result is a film that is much more literate, mature, and touching than I'd expect from the Tenchi franchise.  (Be sure to watch the still frames as the credits roll for the answer to a very popular question!)Intimate knowledge of the characters is not absolutely necessary, but certainly will give you a better understanding of the movie.  If you haven't seen any of the series or movies, you might want to rent out `Tenchi in Love' first or catch up on the back-story of how Tenchi meets Ryoko and Ayeka (and the others) via some internet site.  `Tenchi Forever' will make it worth the effort.",4,"The best of the Tenchi movies...a kinder, gentler Tenchi !!",1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,2276,"['Following', 'adventures', 'Tenchi', 'Masaki', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'are', 'number', 'series', 'spinoffs', 'movies', 'seem', 'go', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'quality', 'storylines', 'animation', 'vary', 'widely', 'Saturday-morning', 'cartoon', 'cheesy', 'inspiringly', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'likable', 'certain', 'predictability', 'two-dimensional', 'So', 'Tenchi', 'fairly', 'popular', 'title', 'lot', 'NOT', 'like', 'too.But', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', 'Tenchi', 'Love', '2', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'definitely', 'brightest', 'First', 'minor', 'characters', 'play', 'much', 'less', 'part', 'story', 'Kiyone', 'MiHoshi', 'Sasami', 'play', 'such', 'minor', 'roles', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'think', 'were', 'regulars', 'series', 'Washu', 'bit', 'more', 'visible', 'still', 'slightly', 'diminished', 'things', 'actually', 'help', 'move', 'story', 'along.Of', 'course', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'are', 'quite', 'visible', 'lot', 'less', 'sniping', 'other', 'fact', ""'re"", 'quite', 'genial', 'towards', 'other', 'times', 'explore', 'many', 'dead-ends', 'locating', 'Tenchi', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'vanished', 'Masaki', 'estate', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'alternate', 'reality', 'old', 'life', ""n't"", 'even', 'memory', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'happily', 'living', 'Haruka', 'love', 'life.The', 'tone', 'movie', 'marked', 'departure', 'loud', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'Tenchi', 'saw', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'series', 'awful', 'Tenchi', 'Movie', '2', 'Daughter', 'Darkness', 'Even', 'decent', 'first', 'movie', 'Tenchi', 'Love', 'used', 'lot', 'familiar', 'elements', 'series', 'movie', 'radical', 'departure', 'result', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'literate', 'mature', 'touching', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Tenchi', 'franchise', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'still', 'credits', 'roll', 'answer', 'very', 'popular', 'question', 'Intimate', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'not', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'certainly', 'will', 'give', 'better', 'understanding', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'movies', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'out', 'Tenchi', 'Love', 'first', 'catch', 'up', 'back-story', 'how', 'Tenchi', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'others', 'internet', 'site', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'will', 'make', 'effort']",Tenchi Forever VHS

What I had found was a love story, a bit disturbing, a bit other-world like, but in the end worth the time of watching. Tenchi is taken to a parallel world by a strange woman called Haruna. She is not a goddess, nor a sorceress, and never shows any signs of special magic power (except for her ability to form an alternate world). She is just like Ryoko or Ayeka in most aspects, which makes it a bit more competitive. Ryoko and Ayeka also are on different grounds in this movie, ditching their previous rivalry so they can team up in search of Tenchi. Instead of the final confrontation between Ryoko, Ayeka, and Haruna being a big epic battle over Tenchi like always, there is no fighting or bloodshed and their hearts do the battling. This movie has a strange feel about it, using bizarre angles and shady lighting. The music is unique, using pianos and accordians in an Italian romance style instead of the sugar-coated, hyper j-pop which was used in the previous Tenchi movies and most other animes. The movie does a fair amount of suffuring at the end, ending too soon and making a PAINFULLY obvious point at who Tenchi really is in love with. While not as stellar as previous Tenchi movies, this film stacks up and is worth a view.",3,one bizzaro movie,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,1447,"['first', 'thing', 'thought', 'myself', 'started', 'movie', 'was', 'Tenchi', 'Tenchi', 'known', 'humor', 'action', 'non-stop', 'risque', 'remarks', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'when', 'got', 'film', 'What', 'had', 'found', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'bit', 'other-world', 'end', 'time', 'watching', 'Tenchi', 'taken', 'parallel', 'world', 'strange', 'woman', 'called', 'Haruna', 'not', 'goddess', 'sorceress', 'never', 'signs', 'special', 'magic', 'power', 'ability', 'form', 'alternate', 'world', 'just', 'like', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'most', 'aspects', 'bit', 'more', 'competitive', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'also', 'are', 'different', 'grounds', 'movie', 'ditching', 'previous', 'rivalry', 'can', 'team', 'up', 'search', 'Tenchi', 'Instead', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'Haruna', 'being', 'big', 'epic', 'battle', 'Tenchi', 'always', 'fighting', 'bloodshed', 'hearts', 'do', 'battling', 'movie', 'strange', 'feel', 'using', 'bizarre', 'angles', 'shady', 'lighting', 'music', 'unique', 'using', 'pianos', 'accordians', 'Italian', 'romance', 'style', 'instead', 'sugar-coated', 'hyper', 'j-pop', 'was', 'used', 'previous', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'most', 'other', 'animes', 'movie', 'fair', 'amount', 'suffuring', 'end', 'ending', 'too', 'soon', 'making', 'PAINFULLY', 'obvious', 'point', 'who', 'Tenchi', 'really', 'love', 'not', 'as', 'stellar', 'previous', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'film', 'up', 'view']",Tenchi Forever VHS

First off, I am absoloutely positive that the same people who brought the OVA series to life keeled over and were replaced by high animators who had no idea  what the cast of Tenchi was supposed to look like!  Second, even though  the plot was semi-original many elements from the original Tenchi movie  were reused. (Aka Tenchi disappearing with everyone there to help/look for  him.) Haruna was okay, but I definetly could have done without the sex  scenes. C'mon! Tenchi is supposed to be this wholesome guy whose stuck with  all of these alien women and has the manners to accept them all for who  they are and not to lay a finger on them!

Light on swordplay and spaceships, heavy on character insight and development. The animation is beautiful, with sleeker, more mature-looking character designs that really complement the film's tone.It's the story of a spirit from Katsuhito's past, who draws Tenchi into a parallel world just beyond Ryoko and Ayeka's reach. He doesn't remember his former life, but is compelled to draw sketches of a certain green-haired demon... Yes, Ryoko fans (like myself) will find a lot to like here. Everyone has to work together to bring Tenchi back, which ends up involving a little of the usual sci-fi heroics, but mostly the film focuses on Ryoko and Ayeka and how they relate to each other. The emotional payoff of the ending is quite moving.Fantastic English dub too.
