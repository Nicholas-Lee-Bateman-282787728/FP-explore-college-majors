25060,AQUU8S55JGY2H,0780020804,Aco,"[4, 4]","In the post WWII environment of Japan, the line between becoming a criminal and a cop was a very thin one. The prospect of upholding any myths or nationalistic fervor must have been slim for soldiers returning home, after a brutal war, one which ended in the most barbaric of ways, and effectively castrated and humiliated a proud and rigid culture. A lifetime of pride in your homeland could evaporate as quickly as a backpack being stolen...In Stray Dog, master Kurosawa wastes no time in setting up the film's one story line, that of rookie detective Murakami, who on a sweltering and packed bus loses his gun. For the new detective, a former soldier, the transition between war and domestic soldiering proves the mettle of the film, and the depth of it's story comes in that difficult place. Unfamiliar with procedure, departments, as well as the in's-and-out's of Tokyo's underworld, the search for his strength, his pride, his manhood, etc., will define him, make him or break him.With the dogged leadership of veteran cop Sato, Murakami's mentor in this pursuit, he recognizes the significance of his position, seeing himself and perhaps allowing for hope in a fractured society.Toshiro Mifune, legend, is Murakami, frazzled, humiliated, frequently an emotive wreck. Though an early sequence in which he goes undercover as a soldier to search out black market guns-a long sequence that is completely without speaking-is beautiful and powerful in it's exposure of the seamy world of desperate people, ""stray dogs"" who suffer the dregs of a crowded uncomfortable world. Takashi Shimura is Sato, the other lead, and his presence is a strong, calming one, as the knowing cop, the rudder perhaps, to Murakami's windy sail.An interesting deep cop film, it is very stylish, naturalistically made and acted, though it's print is visibly aged, it's shadows seem to be less sharp than a noir, allowing for the light to get in.",4,To Make A Mends,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,1923,"['post', 'WWII', 'environment', 'Japan', 'line', 'becoming', 'criminal', 'cop', 'was', 'very', 'thin', 'one', 'prospect', 'upholding', 'myths', 'nationalistic', 'fervor', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'slim', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'home', 'brutal', 'war', 'one', 'ended', 'most', 'barbaric', 'ways', 'effectively', 'castrated', 'humiliated', 'proud', 'rigid', 'culture', 'lifetime', 'pride', 'homeland', 'could', 'evaporate', 'as', 'quickly', 'backpack', 'being', 'stolen', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'master', 'Kurosawa', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'film', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'rookie', 'detective', 'Murakami', 'who', 'sweltering', 'packed', 'bus', 'gun', 'new', 'detective', 'former', 'soldier', 'transition', 'war', 'domestic', 'soldiering', 'mettle', 'film', 'depth', 'story', 'difficult', 'place', 'procedure', 'departments', 'as', 'well', ""in's-and-out"", 'Tokyo', 'underworld', 'search', 'strength', 'pride', 'manhood', 'etc.', 'will', 'define', 'make', 'break', 'dogged', 'leadership', 'veteran', 'cop', 'Sato', 'Murakami', 'mentor', 'pursuit', 'significance', 'position', 'seeing', 'perhaps', 'allowing', 'hope', 'fractured', 'society.Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'legend', 'Murakami', 'frazzled', 'humiliated', 'frequently', 'emotive', 'wreck', 'early', 'sequence', 'undercover', 'soldier', 'search', 'out', 'black', 'market', 'guns-a', 'long', 'sequence', 'completely', 'speaking-is', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'exposure', 'seamy', 'world', 'desperate', 'people', 'stray', 'dogs', 'who', 'suffer', 'dregs', 'crowded', 'uncomfortable', 'world', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'Sato', 'other', 'lead', 'presence', 'strong', 'calming', 'one', 'knowing', 'cop', 'rudder', 'perhaps', 'Murakami', 'windy', 'sail.An', 'interesting', 'deep', 'cop', 'film', 'very', 'stylish', 'naturalistically', 'made', 'acted', 'print', 'visibly', 'aged', 'shadows', 'seem', 'be', 'less', 'sharp', 'noir', 'allowing', 'light', 'get']",N/A

When it started, I wasn't sure I would take to this film, but it draws you in inexorably.  Shot on location in Tokyo, remarkably just 3 or 4 years after the end of WWII, it most reminds me of a Japanese Naked City, with echoes and moments reminiscent of other American gangster films all the way back to Public Enemy and The Roaring Twenties of the 30's.The location photography alone is fascinating in depicting the Japan of 1948 or 49.  And the story progresses as a very young Toshiro Mifune wanders through various levels of that postwar society in search of the thief who stole his Colt.  On hand also, is that wonderful actor in Kurosawa's repertory company that was the leader of the 7 Samurai, and here too, is the older &amp; wiser mentor to Mifune.Finally, the movie wins you over for its own reasons.  Though early, Kurosawa's composition, framing, and directorial skill is evident.  The performances are fine.  The atmosphere and location photography ground the film in reality.  And it is a more complex film and story than it first appears.  And, like early Ford, there is poetry amid the restrictions of budget and resources.  And like early Ford, it presages what was to come.

25062,A307BEM1CF066U,0780020804,a viewer,"[1, 1]","A seminal film (it has been ripped off several times) that shows the first unmistakable signs of Kurosawa's genius. Drawing on American gangster flicks and the existentialist crime novels of Simenon, Kurosawa weaves in his own special concerns--the brutalizing effect of wartime Japan's military dictatorship, the corrupting effect of postwar Japan's crony capitalism--to create a taut, intelligent cops-and-robbers thriller with subtle socio-political overtones.Setting: Tokyo, Summer of 1949. Young cop Mifune has his gun lifted on a crowded bus and now a ""stray dog"" (a former soldier turned street thug) is using it in a crime spree. Mifune pairs up with wise mentor Takashi Shimura (Seven Samurai, Ikiru) to track down the stray dog before he kills again. A classic 8-minute montage shows undercover Mifune (actually a stunt double) roaming the actual back alleys of early postwar Tokyo's thriving black market. This famous scene was shot using a hidden camera, revealing hordes of hungry, grubby, unemployed former soldiers hanging around street corners and obviously up to no good. Gritty realism is the keynote. Stray Dog is the only movie I've seen that accurately depicts a Tokyo summer: everyone packed together and sweating profusely, a constant fanning of faces and mopping of brows in Japan's stiflingly humid climate. The steamy, suffocating heat becomes an objective correlative for the frustration and hopelessness that gripped the recently defeated, war-ravaged nation before the Economic Miracle arrived.Lots of wonderful stuff in this film: the great montage sequences (rare in Kurasawa's oeuvre), the clever tracking shots, the masterly pacing, the elegant construction (e.g., the bullet-countdown and the subtle, incremental way the stray dog is revealed to us), the brilliant use of ambient sounds and music (e.g., that Mozart piano sonata wafting from an open window during the big showdown), and much else. The only fault I can find with Kurosawa's directing here is an overlong baseball sequence in the middle of the film. But even this scene has a certain quaint time-capsule quality to it (at least for me it does).The transfer quality is pretty good for a film this old. Not nearly as spectacular as the pristine transfer that Criterion did for Hidden Fortress, but certainly more than adequate. (You work with what you've got, I guess). Extras include a 30-minute documentary containing interviews with Kurosawa and a couple of the stars of Stray Dog, plus a superb commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince that's worth the price of disc all by itself.Unlike other great Japanese directors, who stuck to one genre and refined it over the course of their careers, Kurosawa was a restless genius and a master of many genres--film noir, samurai epics, samurai comedies, domestic dramas, political thrillers, social realism, surrealism, etc. There were brief glimpses of this multi-faceted genius in his earlier films, but it all starts to come together here, in 1949. A year later, he released the masterpiece Rashomon, and his status as a cinematic giant was assured.",5,Kurosawa does film noir,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3096,"['seminal', 'film', 'been', 'ripped', 'off', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'unmistakable', 'signs', 'Kurosawa', 'genius', 'Drawing', 'American', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'existentialist', 'crime', 'novels', 'Simenon', 'Kurosawa', 'own', 'special', 'concerns', 'brutalizing', 'effect', 'wartime', 'Japan', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'corrupting', 'effect', 'postwar', 'Japan', 'crony', 'capitalism', 'create', 'taut', 'intelligent', 'cops-and-robbers', 'thriller', 'subtle', 'socio-political', 'overtones.Setting', 'Tokyo', 'Summer', '1949', 'Young', 'cop', 'Mifune', 'gun', 'lifted', 'crowded', 'bus', 'now', 'stray', 'dog', 'former', 'soldier', 'turned', 'street', 'thug', 'using', 'crime', 'spree', 'Mifune', 'up', 'wise', 'mentor', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Ikiru', 'track', 'down', 'stray', 'dog', 'again', 'classic', '8-minute', 'montage', 'shows', 'Mifune', 'actually', 'stunt', 'double', 'roaming', 'actual', 'back', 'alleys', 'early', 'postwar', 'Tokyo', 'thriving', 'black', 'market', 'famous', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'using', 'hidden', 'camera', 'revealing', 'hordes', 'hungry', 'grubby', 'unemployed', 'former', 'soldiers', 'hanging', 'around', 'street', 'corners', 'obviously', 'good', 'Gritty', 'realism', 'keynote', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'accurately', 'Tokyo', 'summer', 'everyone', 'packed', 'together', 'sweating', 'profusely', 'constant', 'fanning', 'mopping', 'brows', 'Japan', 'stiflingly', 'humid', 'climate', 'steamy', 'suffocating', 'heat', 'objective', 'correlative', 'frustration', 'hopelessness', 'gripped', 'recently', 'defeated', 'war-ravaged', 'nation', 'Economic', 'Miracle', 'arrived.Lots', 'wonderful', 'stuff', 'film', 'great', 'montage', 'sequences', 'rare', 'Kurasawa', 'oeuvre', 'clever', 'tracking', 'shots', 'masterly', 'pacing', 'elegant', 'construction', 'e.g.', 'bullet-countdown', 'subtle', 'incremental', 'way', 'stray', 'dog', 'revealed', 'brilliant', 'use', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'music', 'e.g.', 'Mozart', 'piano', 'sonata', 'wafting', 'open', 'window', 'big', 'showdown', 'much', 'else', 'only', 'fault', 'can', 'find', 'Kurosawa', 'directing', 'here', 'overlong', 'baseball', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'even', 'scene', 'certain', 'quaint', 'time-capsule', 'quality', 'least', '.The', 'transfer', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'old', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'spectacular', 'pristine', 'transfer', 'Criterion', 'did', 'Hidden', 'Fortress', 'certainly', 'more', 'adequate', 'work', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'guess', 'Extras', 'include', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'containing', 'interviews', 'Kurosawa', 'couple', 'stars', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'superb', 'commentary', 'film', 'scholar', 'Stephen', 'Prince', 'price', 'disc', 'other', 'great', 'Japanese', 'directors', 'who', 'stuck', 'one', 'genre', 'refined', 'course', 'careers', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'restless', 'genius', 'master', 'many', 'genres', 'film', 'noir', 'samurai', 'epics', 'samurai', 'comedies', 'domestic', 'dramas', 'political', 'thrillers', 'social', 'realism', 'surrealism', 'etc', 'were', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'multi-faceted', 'genius', 'earlier', 'films', 'come', 'together', 'here', '1949', 'year', 'later', 'released', 'masterpiece', 'Rashomon', 'status', 'cinematic', 'giant', 'was', 'assured']",N/A

With his regular troupe of players, cinematic icons: Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, Kurosawa gave us an eye-opening rendition, of the hardship experienced in post-war Japan (Kurosawa was clearly showing us, that it's always the regular folks that pay for the consequences of their so-called leaders). Disguised as a stylized (the sweltering heat was a great metaphor for the suffering of the people), and compelling crime-drama (Kurosawa actually adapted the screenplay from a short novel he wrote himself), about a rookie-cop who had his gun lifted on a bus on his way home. Plenty of reviewers have given excellent insight, and I have to agree with them in their comparison of Kurosawa's vision to that of great American directors like Ford and Huston, but I also saw a deserved homage to Jean Renoir. Here, and in so many films to come, Kurosawa clearly demonstrated why he was one of the true cinematic masters of the world. His stories by the way, while being mostly set in Japan (feudal and present day), are universal in their scope and exploration of the human condition. Not to be missed!

This is his homage to French detective Noir films.  There is a part, towards the beginning middle, where Mifune goes undercover and wanders the streets that is a little long, but other than that the film is flawless!Mifune is very likable as the young rookie cop who has his gun stolen while on the train.  He is persistent and very high strung.  His character progresses throughout the investigation and under the tutelage of an older, wiser detective.What is interesting is that the villain (who is faceless until the final 10 minutes) is a version of Mifune's character; what he might have become after the war.  This is a fascinating character study and Mifune is at his best in this film.  He is not the over the top, sarcastic fellow we see in his other films (Seven Samurai, Sanjuro, etc...), but a believable veteran hard on his luck who happened to land a good job.I recommend this andThe Bad Sleep Well - Criterion Collectionfor anyone wanting a Kurosawa film less epic than most and more personal.

Unable to catch the thief after a futile chase he returns back to the station in self imposed shame.

25068,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,0780020804,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[5, 5]","This Japanese film noir was one of director Akira Kurosawa's earliest films, starring (a very young!) Toshiro Mifune as a police detective whose pistol has been stolen and fenced on the black market.  The rookie cop carries a samurai-like sense of personal responsibility for the crimes that are committed with his gun following his lapse in vigilance; this sense of honor is not shared by his fellow officers, who hold a more pragmatic, modern view of things.  Slow moving in the first half, the film picks up steam at the end, climaxing in as grim a showdown as any American movie of the same era.  What takes so long is Kurosawa's presentation of pre-corporate, postwar Japan, which, with it's drug use, prostitution and ramshackle, peeling plaster slums is very different from the ultramodern, sleek image of Japan today.  The transition into an American-oriented popular culture is extensively explored, from the jazz music and Hawaaian tunes that flood through the streets to a (somewhat belaboured) day at the baseball field.

As the bus pulls to a stop he notices someone hurriedly get off and there begins a chase that lasts the entire movie. Kurosawa examines the mindset of desperate men. The criminals are desperate for a variety of reasons and the detective too is a desperate man because he soon learns that it his pistol that is being used to commit crimes which he feels personally responsible for. The incident proves to be the beginning of the young detectives education. The relationship that develops between this younger detective and the older wiser detective is fascinating taking Kurosawas samurai theme of old masters and young warriors and placing it in a modern setting. The older detective teaches the younger one that despite ones own self interest there is a code to respect. But he also learns much from his own field work. The young detective in desperation to retrieve the lost pistol goes undercover posing as an ex soldier down on his luck in an attempt to penetrate the blackmarket for stolen guns. These are some of the most interesting scenes of the picture as they are ripe with social commentary as the detective becomes one of the lowest of the low to catch his thief. The detectives tour of Tokyos criminal underworld is unforgettable and it is there that Kurosawas irony works best for the young detective acts as selfishly and recklessly and desperately as the criminals themselves. The film appeals on many levels. As enjoyable as any Hitchcock or Carrol Reed(Third Man) film. In fact the film reminded me of those English directors in its pacing and look and moments of comic relief. Its a one of a kind classic, a study of different kinds of desperation, with nods to Hollywood but made especially appealing by being shot on location on the cluttered streets of impoverished post war Tokyo. Complex major and minor characters throughout with complex motivations plus that always present eye on the biggest social themes which transcend nationality keep this riveting and interesting all the way through. As entertaining and atmospheric as any classic noir but with much more substance and humanity in it than most noirs have.

25072,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,0780020804,Ernest Jagger,"[1, 1]","One year removed from his film ""Drunken Angel,"" Akira Kurosawa would reunite two of Japan's cinematic giants, Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, in this remarkably captivating crime story of a police officers missing handgun. This early Akira Kurosawa film is outstanding. What captivated me about this early Kurosawa film was the way in which he allows us to see post-war Japan. It is truly remarkable that we are seeing the streets that just a few years before were being laid to waste by massive bombings. It's almost as if we are looking at a documentary of Japans city streets, as Kurosawa's camera captures impressive footage while also giving us a story.The films narrative concerns one young rookie police detective named Murakami (Toshiro Mifune). When his handgun is stolen while he is riding on the train, he is in panic. To help solve the case, Murakami is teamed up with the veteran detective Sato (Takashi Shimura). Detective Sato knows the streets well, and in helping the young rookie Murakami track down his missing handgun, he tries to teach the rash Murakami how a policeman must go about his job--such as not feeling sympathy for the criminal, no matter what his or her reasons for the crime might be.One gets the feeling from Detective Sato that he has seen it all. There is nothing that surprises him when it comes to criminal behavior. This is in sharp contrast to the rookie, Detective Murakami, who at times seems out of place as a police officer. There is much for Murakami to learn: And he could not find a better teacher than the hardened Detective Sato.  I really enjoyed the way that Kurosawa allows us to get a glimpse of Japans police force, and especially when Detective Sato is going through the picture-list data files of local criminals, detailing the type of crimes they have committed. It is amazing the police are able to find a criminal at all; but the grizzled Detective Sato has been around for some time, and knowing the streets the way he does, he gives Detective Murakami a lifetime of learning. It reminded me of the old adage, ""Watch and Learn.""The character played by the legendary actor Toshiro Mifune is also a great glimpse into what will become one of the greatest actors to ever come out of Japan. And not to mention there is the presence of my favorite Japanese actor, Takashi Shimura. As the films narrative moves along, we see Detective Sato guiding the young rookie Murakami through the maze of police work, and suggestions on how to proceed with the all important mission of finding this missing handgun. There is great character development in both of the Detectives, and one can see even at this early stage that Toshiro Mifune was headed toward greatness. CRITERION did a wonderful transfer with this film.

25073,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0780020804,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","For those who've only ever seen Toshir Mifune in his most iconic films (SEVEN SAMURAI, YOJIMBO, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS), STRAY DOG, a low key crime thriller launched in 1949, features him in only his seventh picture, and only two years into his acting career. But Mifune, even as early as that, demonstrates poise and he unleashes that trademark coiled energy. Lean and dynamic and implacable, he prowls across the screen as was his wont, and it's hard to take your eyes off the guy. If you're a fan of Japan's most celebrated actor and of legendary director Akira Kurosawa, you owe it to yourself to eyeball this film.STRAY DOG (""Nora inu"") tracks a rookie homicide detective's desperate search for his stolen service revolver, and if you think that that makes for a shallow plot, you've underestimated Kurosawa's rep as one of cinema's transcendent directors and Mifune's knack for turning in compelling performances. Although the tone isn't near as bleak or despairing as that in, say, THE BICYCLE THIEF, you'll still be bowled over by the intensity and sense of guilt that Mifune brings to the table. One sweltering summer afternoon, fatigue crippling his awareness, Murakami boards a cramped public trolley car and has his compact Colt revolver nicked from his pocket. For a police officer to mislay his weapon constitutes a serious gaffe, and justification for a sacking. Murakami's supervisor is lenient enough that he allows Murakami opportunity to recover his piece.Off Murakami goes, charging headlong into the investigation, subtle as hammers. And it's doubtful that this greenhorn detective would've gotten anywhere if not for the tutelage of several wiser and more experienced police officers. Takashi Shimura plays one of these officers in one of his typically brilliant yet restrained performances. Shimura is one of those whom Kurosawa prefers on his recurring repertoire of actors, and you can see why. While Shimura isn't as globally well-known as Mifune, he is a great, great actor (films like SEVEN SAMURAI and IKIRU should quell any doubts). He shines as the relaxed and patient Detective Sato-san, serving as counterpoint to Murakami's passion and restlessness, threatening to steal the movie at any given juncture. It is Sato-san, with his calmness and street savvy and his ability to penetrate a hostile witness's defenses, who makes headway.One added thorn is that the pinched revolver was loaded with seven bullets, and Murakami is justifiably concerned that his piece may be used to threaten or injure innocents. And this, in fact, is what happens. Sato-san had warned his young partner: ""A stray becomes a rabid dog."" And, to his horror and shame, Murakami learns that his firearm has become instrumental in several robberies and murders. He starts to fall apart. Kurasawa tightens the screws even more. The final twenty minutes or so, in which Murakami and Sato-san split off to pursue divergent leads, are fraught with escalating suspense.It's a bit baffling why STRAY DOG isn't more lauded as a masterpiece. Is it because it came in a time in which both director and star actor were still new to the game? But STRAY DOG has such a self-assured vibe to it. Kurosawa's craftsmanship is there for all to see, bold and vibrant and meaningful. I marvel at his ability to convey the awful oppressive heat thru which the detectives conduct their investigation. The scene with the showgirls collapsing in a heap as soon as their number was done. How Sato-san is always fanning himself. I must've drank ten glasses of water when watching this film.This is an outstanding drama, so vividly a character study. We note the genre tropes: the noirish elements, the relentless pursuit thru the Tokyo underworld, the eager rookie being paired up with the seasoned veteran. But Kurosawa also makes a telling statement about the harrowing conditions in post-war Japan, how ugly the slums, how broken the people. Kurosawa depicts two possible outcomes regarding a soldier's prospects in the aftermath of a war. In STRAY DOG, one such soldier, psychologically damaged and unable to adapt, succumbs to a life of crime, abetted by Murakami's Colt revolver. Another soldier, also a stray dog, walked a different path. At the crossroads, he chose to become a law enforcer. And then his gun was stolen.",5,"""I have an awful feeling something worse will happen.""",1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,4305,"['who', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'Toshir', 'Mifune', 'most', 'iconic', 'films', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', 'YOJIMBO', 'THE', 'HIDDEN', 'FORTRESS', 'STRAY', 'DOG', 'low', 'key', 'crime', 'thriller', 'launched', '1949', 'only', 'seventh', 'picture', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'acting', 'career', 'Mifune', 'even', 'as', 'early', 'poise', 'trademark', 'coiled', 'energy', 'Lean', 'dynamic', 'implacable', 'screen', 'was', 'wont', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'guy', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Japan', 'most', 'celebrated', 'actor', 'legendary', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'owe', 'eyeball', 'film.STRAY', 'DOG', 'Nora', 'inu', 'rookie', 'homicide', 'detective', 'desperate', 'search', 'stolen', 'service', 'revolver', 'think', 'shallow', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'underestimated', 'Kurosawa', 'rep', 'one', 'cinema', 'transcendent', 'directors', 'Mifune', 'knack', 'turning', 'compelling', 'performances', 'tone', ""n't"", 'near', 'bleak', 'despairing', 'say', 'BICYCLE', 'THIEF', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'bowled', 'intensity', 'sense', 'guilt', 'Mifune', 'table', 'One', 'sweltering', 'summer', 'afternoon', 'fatigue', 'crippling', 'awareness', 'Murakami', 'cramped', 'public', 'trolley', 'car', 'compact', 'Colt', 'revolver', 'nicked', 'pocket', 'police', 'officer', 'mislay', 'weapon', 'serious', 'gaffe', 'justification', 'sacking', 'Murakami', 'supervisor', 'lenient', 'enough', 'Murakami', 'opportunity', 'recover', 'piece.Off', 'Murakami', 'charging', 'headlong', 'investigation', 'subtle', 'hammers', 'doubtful', 'greenhorn', 'detective', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'anywhere', 'not', 'tutelage', 'several', 'wiser', 'more', 'experienced', 'police', 'officers', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'one', 'officers', 'one', 'typically', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'restrained', 'performances', 'Shimura', 'one', 'whom', 'Kurosawa', 'prefers', 'recurring', 'repertoire', 'actors', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Shimura', ""n't"", 'globally', 'well-known', 'Mifune', 'great', 'great', 'actor', 'films', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', 'IKIRU', 'should', 'quell', 'doubts', 'relaxed', 'patient', 'Detective', 'Sato-san', 'serving', 'counterpoint', 'Murakami', 'passion', 'restlessness', 'threatening', 'steal', 'movie', 'given', 'juncture', 'Sato-san', 'calmness', 'street', 'savvy', 'ability', 'penetrate', 'hostile', 'witness', 'defenses', 'who', 'headway.One', 'added', 'thorn', 'pinched', 'revolver', 'was', 'loaded', 'seven', 'bullets', 'Murakami', 'justifiably', 'concerned', 'piece', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'threaten', 'injure', 'innocents', 'fact', 'what', 'Sato-san', 'had', 'warned', 'young', 'partner', 'stray', 'rabid', 'dog', 'horror', 'shame', 'Murakami', 'firearm', 'become', 'instrumental', 'several', 'robberies', 'murders', 'fall', 'apart', 'Kurasawa', 'screws', 'even', 'more', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Murakami', 'Sato-san', 'split', 'off', 'pursue', 'divergent', 'leads', 'are', 'fraught', 'escalating', 'suspense.It', 'bit', 'baffling', 'why', 'STRAY', 'DOG', ""n't"", 'more', 'lauded', 'masterpiece', 'came', 'time', 'director', 'star', 'actor', 'were', 'still', 'new', 'game', 'STRAY', 'DOG', 'such', 'self-assured', 'vibe', 'Kurosawa', 'craftsmanship', 'there', 'see', 'bold', 'vibrant', 'meaningful', 'marvel', 'ability', 'convey', 'awful', 'oppressive', 'heat', 'thru', 'detectives', 'conduct', 'investigation', 'scene', 'showgirls', 'collapsing', 'heap', 'as', 'soon', 'number', 'was', 'done', 'How', 'Sato-san', 'always', 'fanning', 'must', ""'ve"", 'drank', 'ten', 'glasses', 'water', 'when', 'watching', 'film.This', 'outstanding', 'drama', 'so', 'vividly', 'character', 'study', 'note', 'genre', 'tropes', 'noirish', 'elements', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'Tokyo', 'underworld', 'eager', 'rookie', 'being', 'paired', 'up', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'Kurosawa', 'also', 'telling', 'statement', 'harrowing', 'conditions', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'how', 'ugly', 'slums', 'how', 'broken', 'people', 'Kurosawa', 'two', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'regarding', 'soldier', 'prospects', 'aftermath', 'war', 'STRAY', 'DOG', 'one', 'such', 'soldier', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'unable', 'adapt', 'succumbs', 'life', 'crime', 'abetted', 'Murakami', 'Colt', 'revolver', 'soldier', 'also', 'stray', 'dog', 'walked', 'different', 'path', 'crossroads', 'chose', 'become', 'law', 'enforcer', 'then', 'gun', 'was', 'stolen']",N/A

The strength of Stray Dog is certainly the imagery:  the glimpses of everyday life in the early years of postwar Japan are as priceless as virtually anything from the silent era, and seeing such a young Mifune in his dandyish zoot suite is also worth the price of admission in itself.  The rabid dog thru the opening credits frames the film wonderfully and returns to your mind well after you've turned off the TV.  And here Kurosawa's greatest weakness (an apparently utter disdain for females) is graciously muted: women are portrayed in mostly unflattering roles but are at least allowed to show some bit of their sensuality (something which is utterly lacking in his later films). The ending is first marvelous then disappointing; the last 120 seconds or so might have better landed on the cutting room floor.  The narrative thrill wasn't quite Hitchcock, and the noirish shadows weren't quite to the level of Welles or Wilder.  But I am not complaining.  While Stray Dog shows some of the undeveloped side of Kurosawa, it also shows traits he would have been better to have kept.  All in all Stray Dog was a delight to watch.Regarding the Criterion DVD, the image quality is really no better than a VHS tape.  Occasionally scenes are quite dark or the picture is striped with dark lines.  The DVD menu page is too dark and it was almost impossible to read the options.

25075,A1HHAPZV8UWT6T,0780020804,Jacqui,"[4, 5]","This is the third collaboration between Kurosawa and Mifune. Although &quot;mediocre&quot; compared to their other masterpieces, Stray Dog is a thriller that has more character complexity (whydunit) and plot intrigue  (whodunit) than the average effort.  Mifune is not bad as the stoic  (compared to his more well-known roles) but persistent Murakami, and here  we see Shimura as a mentor that recalls the infallible Kambei from Seven  Samurai. One of the assets of Stray Dog is, obviously, the wonderful  portrayal of post-war Japan, the various characters of the  &quot;low-end&quot; of society: Black market dealers, bar-girls, and  ordinary do-gooders all try to stay just above the poverty and starvation  line - while maintaining their dignity in front of police interrogation.Kurosawa's editing is masterful in this film, as can be seen in the  baseball game sequence and Mifune's memorable romp through the slums. The  final encounter between Murakami and his subject of pursuit (Ko Kimura's  first role for Kurosawa) is breathtaking - lyrical humanism for which the  one and only director-sensei is known for.",4,wonderful detective thriller set in post-war japan,925344000,"04 29, 1999",1999,1118,"['third', 'collaboration', 'Kurosawa', 'Mifune', 'quot', 'quot', 'compared', 'other', 'masterpieces', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'thriller', 'more', 'character', 'complexity', 'whydunit', 'plot', 'intrigue', 'whodunit', 'average', 'effort', 'Mifune', 'not', 'bad', 'stoic', 'compared', 'more', 'well-known', 'roles', 'persistent', 'Murakami', 'here', 'see', 'Shimura', 'mentor', 'infallible', 'Kambei', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'One', 'assets', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'obviously', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'various', 'characters', 'quot', 'low-end', 'quot', 'society', 'Black', 'market', 'dealers', 'bar-girls', 'ordinary', 'do-gooders', 'try', 'stay', 'just', 'poverty', 'starvation', 'line', 'maintaining', 'dignity', 'front', 'police', 'interrogation.Kurosawa', 'editing', 'masterful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'baseball', 'game', 'sequence', 'Mifune', 'memorable', 'romp', 'slums', 'final', 'encounter', 'Murakami', 'subject', 'pursuit', 'Ko', 'Kimura', 'first', 'role', 'Kurosawa', 'breathtaking', 'lyrical', 'humanism', 'one', 'only', 'director-sensei', 'known']",N/A

Toshiro Mifune stars as Murakami, a young but troubled Tokyo homicide detective. In the opening sequence, his Colt is stolen from someone on a hot and crowded bus. Ashamed, he takes it upon himself to get the gun back at all costs, and in doing so goes undercover as a down-and-out war veteran. Then when he gets amazingly close to his suspect, he sees that he's only arrested the thief's subordinate and not the thief himself. However, he questions the girl until she's fet up with him and the heat of the room she's being interrogated in. That's when he calls upon larceny detective Sato, played by Takashi Shimura. His methods are slower, kinder, and less reckless than Murakami. They find that she doesn't know anything about the guns, but is linked to an even bigger criminal with the alias of Hondo, and wait at a baseball game to find him. After several methods and attempts that prove fruitless, his real name is announced over the loudspeakers and they have no trouble catching him. Then with him out of the way, Sato invites Murakami over for dinner to get to know each other better. Everything seems fine, until the next morning when a robbery/homicide occurs. A man's wife is found dead, and guess whose gun was used: it's Murakami's same Colt.From there on out the real story begins, and Murakami's attempt to get a good first arrest becomes a nightmare of how to catch the killer before he tries anything else. Director Kurosawa was inspired by French crime novels, and even wrote this first as a novel itself. However, when he wrote the accompanying screenplay, it took him twice as long to finish it. This isn't just a simple ""cat-and-mouse"" crime thriller like you'd see in modern crap that pretends to be cleverly thought out. It really has a reason for so much crime and so many lowlifes to be walking about, and using WWII as a scapegoat is actually quite a realistic (and at the time very innovative) approach. People were desperate during those times, and post-war Japan was not exactly the # 1 travel destination in the world. If anything, this is a film about desperation and survival, the truest sense of Darwin's law of natural selection. Even the police are as desperate as dogs to assure that the most dangerous men are put away for good, and it's very evident in the final climatic showdown.The DVD package is VERY cool, very chic, and perfect for the grittiness of the film. The menu is equally cool, but no trailer to be seen. There is a commentary, but don't listen to it on a late night, the moron will bore you to tears. However, to make up for it there's a 32-minute documentary about the film and Kurosawa's work overall, and a booklet from Kurosawa's autobiography. The Criterion Collection did a really good job with this one.The only problem I have with the film itself is the soundtrack. Sure, the music does its job, but this movie demands something cooler.There are many modern day examples of this film's influence. For example, the dinner scene is very closely related to that of ""Lethal Weapon"", where the older cop invites his younger partner, only to show up tomorrow to a murder. Then there's the taking of the cop's gun to kill people, like in ""48 Hours"". If you like either film, or detective films in general, then buy this movie. Good luck trying to find a video store that carries it for rental, but buy it despite the exorbitant amount for it. This is a very cool movie.",5,A mad dog only sees straight paths.,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,3523,"['Anybody', 'who', 'seen', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'Murakami', 'young', 'troubled', 'Tokyo', 'homicide', 'detective', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Colt', 'stolen', 'someone', 'hot', 'crowded', 'bus', 'Ashamed', 'get', 'gun', 'back', 'costs', 'doing', 'so', 'undercover', 'down-and-out', 'war', 'veteran', 'Then', 'when', 'amazingly', 'close', 'suspect', 'only', 'arrested', 'thief', 'subordinate', 'not', 'thief', 'However', 'questions', 'girl', 'fet', 'up', 'heat', 'room', 'being', 'interrogated', 'when', 'larceny', 'detective', 'Sato', 'played', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'methods', 'are', 'slower', 'kinder', 'less', 'reckless', 'Murakami', 'find', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'guns', 'linked', 'even', 'bigger', 'criminal', 'alias', 'Hondo', 'wait', 'baseball', 'game', 'find', 'several', 'methods', 'attempts', 'prove', 'fruitless', 'real', 'name', 'announced', 'loudspeakers', 'have', 'trouble', 'catching', 'Then', 'way', 'Sato', 'Murakami', 'dinner', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'better', 'Everything', 'fine', 'next', 'morning', 'when', 'robbery/homicide', 'man', 'wife', 'found', 'dead', 'guess', 'gun', 'was', 'used', 'Murakami', 'same', 'Colt.From', 'real', 'story', 'begins', 'Murakami', 'attempt', 'get', 'good', 'first', 'arrest', 'nightmare', 'how', 'catch', 'killer', 'anything', 'else', 'Director', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'inspired', 'French', 'crime', 'novels', 'even', 'wrote', 'first', 'novel', 'However', 'when', 'wrote', 'accompanying', 'screenplay', 'took', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'finish', ""n't"", 'just', 'simple', 'cat-and-mouse', 'crime', 'thriller', ""'d"", 'see', 'modern', 'crap', 'be', 'cleverly', 'thought', 'out', 'really', 'reason', 'so', 'much', 'crime', 'so', 'many', 'lowlifes', 'be', 'walking', 'using', 'WWII', 'scapegoat', 'actually', 'quite', 'realistic', 'time', 'very', 'innovative', 'approach', 'People', 'were', 'desperate', 'times', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', '1', 'travel', 'destination', 'world', 'anything', 'film', 'desperation', 'survival', 'truest', 'sense', 'Darwin', 'law', 'natural', 'selection', 'Even', 'police', 'are', 'as', 'desperate', 'dogs', 'assure', 'most', 'dangerous', 'men', 'are', 'put', 'away', 'good', 'very', 'evident', 'final', 'climatic', 'showdown.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'VERY', 'cool', 'very', 'chic', 'perfect', 'grittiness', 'film', 'menu', 'equally', 'cool', 'trailer', 'be', 'seen', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'late', 'night', 'moron', 'will', 'bore', 'tears', 'However', 'make', 'up', '32-minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'Kurosawa', 'work', 'overall', 'booklet', 'Kurosawa', 'autobiography', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Sure', 'music', 'job', 'movie', 'something', 'are', 'many', 'modern', 'day', 'examples', 'film', 'influence', 'example', 'dinner', 'scene', 'very', 'closely', 'related', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'where', 'older', 'cop', 'younger', 'partner', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'tomorrow', 'murder', 'Then', 'taking', 'cop', 'gun', 'kill', 'people', '48', 'Hours', 'like', 'film', 'detective', 'films', 'general', 'then', 'buy', 'movie', 'Good', 'luck', 'trying', 'find', 'video', 'store', 'rental', 'buy', 'exorbitant', 'amount', 'very', 'cool', 'movie']",N/A

Although I didn't find Stray Dog was as good as Rashamon, which is my favorite. I did think that this was another excellent movie by Kurosawa. I did think that the Post War Japan was another interesting setting for Kurosawa. Like his movies set during Japan's feudal period, a lawless time full of bandits and peril. As I imagine Tokyo would have been just 3 or 4 years after the war ended, with all the displaced people, namely soldiers (possibly a substitute for ronin?) roving around. Though at the time it wouldn't have been, Kurosawa sets his movie in a period of turmoil in his country, wonder if he realized this at the time, or acted upon it deliberatley, I feel that he must have. The man, Kusa is a stray dog, no promise or love in his life, roaming the streets of the inner city attempting to live some type of life. He becomes fed up with his down turned existence and in a sense becomes rabid, though desperate is closer. Only used rabid, because I wanted to keep up with the dog analogies. The final fight scene like the one in Rashamon is very clumsy, two desperate men battle it out, they do not have their wits about them, they thrash, they stumble, and fall, eventually becoming fatigued and exhausted, these two are not the graceful fight scenes of Seven Samarai. Anyway, Stray Dog is very Noir, is it circumstance that leads men down a bad path? Kurosawa certainly brings this question to our attention, but I cannot tell if he quickly dismisses this question or validates by having the cop (Murakami) looking for his stolen gun having had the same life changing experience. Though Murakami chose a different path than Kusa, the stray dog.-However, and strictly on a technical note, if Kusa was considered such a menace, Kurasawa should have given him something bigger than a Colt .25. Unless of course in a historical context, being that was all the japanese police forces could come up with at the time. Or it could be a metaphorical image, poorly armed police vs. a large population of moral ambiguious citizens.Thank you",5,A Dog With A Gun,1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,2070,"['Desperate', 'man', 'gun', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Rashamon', 'favorite', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Kurosawa', 'did', 'think', 'Post', 'War', 'Japan', 'was', 'interesting', 'setting', 'Kurosawa', 'movies', 'set', 'Japan', 'feudal', 'period', 'lawless', 'time', 'full', 'bandits', 'peril', 'imagine', 'Tokyo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', '3', '4', 'years', 'war', 'ended', 'displaced', 'people', 'namely', 'soldiers', 'possibly', 'substitute', 'ronin', 'roving', 'around', 'Though', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Kurosawa', 'movie', 'period', 'turmoil', 'country', 'wonder', 'realized', 'time', 'acted', 'feel', 'must', 'have', 'man', 'Kusa', 'stray', 'dog', 'promise', 'love', 'life', 'roaming', 'streets', 'inner', 'city', 'attempting', 'live', 'type', 'life', 'fed', 'up', 'down', 'turned', 'existence', 'sense', 'rabid', 'desperate', 'closer', 'Only', 'used', 'rabid', 'wanted', 'keep', 'up', 'dog', 'analogies', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'one', 'Rashamon', 'very', 'clumsy', 'two', 'desperate', 'men', 'battle', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'wits', 'thrash', 'stumble', 'fall', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'fatigued', 'exhausted', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'graceful', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Seven', 'Samarai', 'Anyway', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'very', 'Noir', 'circumstance', 'men', 'down', 'bad', 'path', 'Kurosawa', 'certainly', 'question', 'attention', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'quickly', 'question', 'validates', 'having', 'cop', 'Murakami', 'looking', 'stolen', 'gun', 'having', 'had', 'same', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'Murakami', 'chose', 'different', 'path', 'Kusa', 'stray', 'dog.-However', 'strictly', 'technical', 'note', 'Kusa', 'was', 'considered', 'menace', 'Kurasawa', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'something', 'bigger', 'Colt', '.25', 'Unless', 'course', 'historical', 'context', 'being', 'was', 'japanese', 'police', 'forces', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'metaphorical', 'image', 'poorly', 'armed', 'police', 'vs.', 'large', 'population', 'moral', 'ambiguious', 'citizens.Thank']",N/A

Detective Murakami notifies his superior about the theft which causes him embarrassment and fear of being fired.  The humiliation combined with the fear compels Detective Murakami to keep searching for the thief by going undercover.  Murakami probes the scorching Tokyo streets and alleys with meticulously scanning eyes as he comes across a weapons dealer that has clues about the guns whereabouts.  These clues help Murakami to continue the investigation as he is assisted by the shrewd Detective Sato (Takashi Shimura) to uncover further clues of the identity of the pickpocket.  As clues accumulate Murakami seems to identify himself more and more with the criminal.  This begins to wear on Murakami, but the understanding Sato keeps reminding him that he is doing the right thing.Stray Dog is an intense criminal story that examines the psychology of the characters as in compares the similarities between criminals and detectives.  These similarities are balanced on a thin line based on choice, which Kurosawa dissects studiously through the camera lens.  Kurosawa's investigation of the character's psychology creates a spiraling suspense that is enhanced through subtle surprises and brilliant cinematography.  The camera use often displays shots through thin cloths, close ups, and new camera angles, which also makes the film aesthetically appealing.

The occupation and Meiji restoration are the most interesting historical periods for me; because they are periods of great flux and help explain why Japan is the way it is today.

On one level it is mediation on the options available to people in post war Japan, the moral choice that ex-army soldier Murakami (Mifune) takes, or the amoral destructive role the thief/murderer Yusa takes.

The movie starts out as a sort of beaurocratic comedy as a plain clothes officer named Murakami has his pistol stolen by a pick pocket.  Despite the embarassment, it was a matter that could affect his continued employment with the force.  As he starts to track down which pickpocket might have done the job, it becomes apparent that the gun has been used in a violent crime.  At this point, the officer gets teamed up with an old pro named Sato and the two are on the hunt for a serious criminal.The plot may sound semi-standard but, as in most Kurosawa movies I've seen, the excellence isn't in the story but in its' telling.  There are several scenes of Murakami wandering through Tokyo that reminded me somewhat of ""The Bicycle Thief"".  There is a lot of psychological aspects to this movie such as Murakami's efforts to reconcile the use of his gun in the hands of a violent criminal.  In the conversations between the two detectives we hear the hardened outlook of Sato on the criminal element in society.  Murakami shows the occassional fine line between cop and thief which may have been Kurosawa's main point in ""Stray Dog"".  There are many other interesting aspects to the movie and I'm sure more will emerge each time I see it.  The movie has the added aspect of being a fairly good thriller.Toshiro Mifune plays Murakami and it seemed strange to see him clean cut throughout the movie.  Takashi Shimura plays Sato and the two work very well together.  All of the acting is well done as well as the directing and the writing.

25086,A16QODENBJVUI1,0780020804,Robert Moore,"[30, 33]","I foung this to be an absolutely fascinating film on several levels.First, although we primarily associate Kurosawa with period films, this was one of his relatively few contemporary films.  Along with the utterly phenomenal IKIRU (1952) and HIGH AND LOW (1963), it is one of his three most successful nonhistorical films.  Nonetheless, for us in the early part of the 21st century, it possesses a great deal of almost documentary interest for glimpses into life in post-war Japan.  Released in 1949, it depicts a Japan that had not yet begun the strong enonomic recovery of the 1950s.  I found the numerous images of individuals struggling on the margins of economic survivability to be riveting.  This was seen not merely in the &quot;stray dog&quot; who possessed the gun of the main character, but in many minor characters, not all of whom we actually see.  One of the truly sad moments was when Takashi Shimura (familiar as the head samurai of SEVEN SAMURAI, the dying man in IKIRU, and the woodcutter of RASHOMON) explains to Toshiro Mifune how a thief's stealing the cash a woman had saved for her dowry probably meant that she would not have enough money saved again until she was an old maid, implying that the thief had stolen not merely her cash, but her chance of happiness in life as well.Second, seeing Toshiro Mifune playing a despondent, anxious, inexperienced, overly deferential detective was a completely new experience.  It is a range of emotions that I had not previously seen him put on display in anyother role.  I must add that I think most contemporary American viewers will find, perhaps, his character to be a little too groveling and impetuously stupid.  My daughter watched this movie with me (though 14, she is a huge Kurosawa fan as well), and she felt very, very uncomfortable at the way he deferentially hung his head in shame before his superiors.  (I should add that despite this, she loved the film as a whole as well.)The film was full of fascinating shots of private spaces that as a Westerner I found to be one of the most interesting things in the movie.  When American films started being made in the 1950s that were at least partially set in Japan, the shots in people's homes often made them look as if they were display pieces, not like actual places where people would live.  But the homes in STRAY DOG all looked lived in, like real abodes.But while all these things are good and fine, the movie in the end has to stand up as a piece of cinema, and it does so admirably.  Although on one level not a great deal happens in the movie, Kurosawa manages to imbue the conflicts and struggles in the film with Shakespearean importance.  He manages to bring home the point that people's lives and their own concerns are of infinite concern to them.  And scene after scene that might have come off as trivial and unimportant instead are crucial and memorable, like the long scene in which Mifune sits in the apartment of a dancing girl and her mother, attempting to gain information about her quasi-boyfriend who is suspected of having and using Mifune's pistol.  The camerawork in the film is flawless, and many of the scenes stay with you long after you have seen the film.  I agree with the reviewer who emphasized the overwhelming sense of heat that the film communicates (the action all takes place in the middle of a heat wave).One scene in particular bears pointing out.  In the climatic fight with the villain, we witness one of the least glamorized and romanticized fights in the history of the cinema.  Neither man places tremendous fighting skills before the viewer.  Neither looks particularly competent.  When the fight is over, both men lay heaving and sweaty and dirty on the ground in the middile of a field.  It is an utterly remarkable moment.  Finally, after a few minutes, the thief begins to sob, less, one suspects, over having been caught, but over what his life has become.In short, a marvelous film.  And very, very different than most of the films by which we know Kurosawa.  I strongly recommend it.",5,A consistently fascinating film,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,4064,"['foung', 'be', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'film', 'several', 'levels.First', 'primarily', 'associate', 'Kurosawa', 'period', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'relatively', 'few', 'contemporary', 'films', 'utterly', 'phenomenal', 'IKIRU', '1952', 'HIGH', 'AND', 'LOW', '1963', 'one', 'three', 'most', 'successful', 'nonhistorical', 'films', 'Nonetheless', 'early', 'part', '21st', 'century', 'great', 'deal', 'almost', 'documentary', 'interest', 'glimpses', 'life', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'Released', '1949', 'Japan', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'begun', 'strong', 'enonomic', 'recovery', '1950s', 'found', 'numerous', 'images', 'individuals', 'struggling', 'margins', 'economic', 'survivability', 'be', 'riveting', 'was', 'seen', 'not', 'merely', 'quot', 'dog', 'quot', 'who', 'possessed', 'gun', 'main', 'character', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'not', 'whom', 'actually', 'see', 'One', 'truly', 'sad', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'familiar', 'head', 'samurai', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', 'dying', 'man', 'IKIRU', 'woodcutter', 'RASHOMON', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'how', 'thief', 'stealing', 'cash', 'woman', 'had', 'saved', 'dowry', 'probably', 'meant', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'saved', 'again', 'was', 'old', 'maid', 'implying', 'thief', 'had', 'stolen', 'not', 'merely', 'cash', 'chance', 'happiness', 'life', 'well.Second', 'seeing', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'playing', 'despondent', 'anxious', 'inexperienced', 'overly', 'deferential', 'detective', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'experience', 'range', 'emotions', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'seen', 'put', 'display', 'anyother', 'role', 'must', 'add', 'think', 'most', 'contemporary', 'American', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'perhaps', 'character', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'groveling', 'impetuously', 'stupid', 'daughter', 'watched', 'movie', '14', 'huge', 'Kurosawa', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'felt', 'very', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'way', 'deferentially', 'hung', 'head', 'shame', 'superiors', 'should', 'add', 'loved', 'film', 'whole', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'fascinating', 'shots', 'private', 'spaces', 'Westerner', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'When', 'American', 'films', 'started', 'being', 'made', '1950s', 'were', 'least', 'partially', 'set', 'Japan', 'shots', 'people', 'homes', 'often', 'made', 'look', 'were', 'display', 'pieces', 'not', 'actual', 'places', 'where', 'people', 'would', 'live', 'homes', 'STRAY', 'DOG', 'looked', 'lived', 'real', 'abodes.But', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'fine', 'movie', 'end', 'stand', 'up', 'piece', 'cinema', 'so', 'admirably', 'one', 'level', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'Kurosawa', 'imbue', 'conflicts', 'struggles', 'film', 'Shakespearean', 'importance', 'bring', 'home', 'point', 'people', 'lives', 'own', 'concerns', 'are', 'infinite', 'concern', 'scene', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'trivial', 'unimportant', 'instead', 'are', 'crucial', 'memorable', 'long', 'scene', 'Mifune', 'apartment', 'dancing', 'girl', 'mother', 'attempting', 'gain', 'information', 'quasi-boyfriend', 'who', 'suspected', 'having', 'using', 'Mifune', 'pistol', 'camerawork', 'film', 'flawless', 'many', 'scenes', 'stay', 'long', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'emphasized', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'heat', 'film', 'communicates', 'action', 'place', 'middle', 'heat', 'wave', '.One', 'scene', 'particular', 'bears', 'pointing', 'out', 'climatic', 'fight', 'villain', 'witness', 'one', 'least', 'glamorized', 'romanticized', 'fights', 'history', 'cinema', 'man', 'tremendous', 'fighting', 'skills', 'viewer', 'particularly', 'competent', 'When', 'fight', 'men', 'lay', 'heaving', 'sweaty', 'dirty', 'ground', 'middile', 'field', 'utterly', 'remarkable', 'moment', 'Finally', 'few', 'minutes', 'thief', 'sob', 'less', 'one', 'suspects', 'having', 'been', 'caught', 'what', 'life', 'become.In', 'short', 'marvelous', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'films', 'know', 'Kurosawa', 'strongly', 'recommend']",N/A
25087,AHWBKTWFD46UI,0780020804,Samurai Girl,"[7, 7]","Takeshi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune negotiate post-war Japan's underbelly in this cops and robbers thriller, finding friendship, and ultimately, the reason for existance. If you watch this film, unless you have no soul, I guarantee that you will be haunted by scenes of Shimura's head against a bank of clouds, of Mifune's face in the background of the interrogation scene, of Mifune's boots stomping the streets, doggedly, in the bad part of town, of flowers in the field near a train station, of the sound of a piano when a man is shot, of train tracks and Shimura's voice, of the steam rising from a cold popsicle in the heat of summer.Who is the stray dog? Mifune? The dog who won't let go of a bone? We're led to think the criminal is the stray dog. But everyone in the film is dog-tired, hot, weary, beat down, even Japan itself is beat. The scene at the broken fountain symbolizes this demoralization, exhaustion, heat and loss of direction.Wow. That's pretty heavy stuff. Just to lighten up a bit: Mifune is breathtakingly beautiful in this film. (Some of us gals may miss the brevity of Mifune''s outfit in Seven Samurai, but, still, he wears white linen gorgeously: even when it is saturated with mud in the last fight scenes: shows the form, eh? He is definately a beautiful man, and refreshingly humble in this flick. Makes it even easier to love him.)Mifune's intense as always, but without samurai growling or histrionics. You won't miss them. He convicingly shows humility, respect, dedication, perserverence and as in all his films, gains understanding and knowledge as the film develops. Mifune always goes through a transformation.Takeshi Shimura is the older and wiser cop-- not unlike the leader in Seven Samurai: he shows the way. But, we all make mistakes, and have bad luck. for Shimura, the confluence of confusion and momentarily lost focus is almost fatal.But, the good guys live to reflect on their journey together. If Kurasawa had never made the more famous and popular samurai films, he still had gold with the combination here of Shimura and Mifune.

Every time I think I have Kurosawa figured out he again amazes me with the incredible power of story-telling that he wields. While many will praise the master of Japanese cinema for his awesoem samurai epics, this one strikes a similar chord to High and Low, spinning a tale of social commentary in post-war Japan. There are differences though. Big ones.While High and Low (like this film) tells us a great deal about police-work and the state of Japan after World War II (and the terrible things that people may or may not have been forced to do as a result of the social upheaval), this film is more personal.Toshiro Mifune is probably the greatest actor in Japanese history, and his early performance here struck me very hard indeed. Previously I had seen Mifune as an old man and a rascal, but never playing a serious dramatic lead as a young man (ordinary Joe). When our young protagonist loses his gun, I can feel his shame and disgrace, and feel his terrible moment of panic. As the film progresses, he continues to scan every room as if it might hold some hidden clue, and his intensity is such that it worries his superiors and outright frightens normal people who get in his way. As the film progresses we watch the tension grow, and see his mind pushed closer and closer to the edge. He isn't worried about his gun. He is obsessed. Every new crime he hears about triggers the reaction ""Was it MY gun?!"" By the end of the movie my eyes were glued to the screen, and few moments in movie history match the scene where he finds himself right next to the killer who has his gun, with only a simple description to go on (that matches about five or six people right in front of him). Mifune is awesome in this movie. It's worthy buying for him alone.Of course this detective story is about more than just one person, and all of the characters are acted out supremely well. Characteristic of Kurosawa, the camera is used to perfection, the music used to wrap you into the story, and the dialog is perfectly natural. It all feels so real (or is it surreal?), you simply don't know what is going to happen next. The atmosphere is the thing that really sends this one into the stratosphere, though. It's like The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon. As we are taken through seemingly every aspect of Japan's metropolis, we see people sweating up a storm, staring off into space dispassionately, struggling just to keep alive in a dangerous world. It's all metaphorical, but it's also all wildly entertaining. If you love film-noir or Kurosawa you must buy this movie immediately.",5,"""Good time for a showdown.""",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2764,"['sweltering', 'heat', 'summer', 'big', 'city', 'atmosphere', 'metropolis', 'time', 'drastic', 'change', 'idealistic', 'young', 'rookie', 'out', 'quest', 'personal', 'revenge', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'time', 'think', 'have', 'Kurosawa', 'figured', 'out', 'again', 'incredible', 'power', 'story-telling', 'many', 'will', 'praise', 'master', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'awesoem', 'samurai', 'epics', 'one', 'similar', 'chord', 'High', 'Low', 'spinning', 'tale', 'social', 'commentary', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'are', 'differences', 'Big', 'ones.While', 'High', 'Low', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'police-work', 'state', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'terrible', 'things', 'people', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'do', 'result', 'social', 'upheaval', 'film', 'more', 'personal.Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'probably', 'greatest', 'actor', 'Japanese', 'history', 'early', 'performance', 'here', 'struck', 'very', 'hard', 'indeed', 'Previously', 'had', 'seen', 'Mifune', 'old', 'man', 'rascal', 'never', 'playing', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'lead', 'young', 'man', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'When', 'young', 'protagonist', 'gun', 'can', 'feel', 'shame', 'disgrace', 'feel', 'terrible', 'moment', 'panic', 'film', 'scan', 'room', 'might', 'hold', 'hidden', 'clue', 'intensity', 'such', 'superiors', 'outright', 'frightens', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'way', 'film', 'watch', 'tension', 'grow', 'see', 'mind', 'pushed', 'closer', 'closer', 'edge', ""n't"", 'worried', 'gun', 'obsessed', 'new', 'crime', 'triggers', 'reaction', 'MY', 'gun', 'end', 'movie', 'eyes', 'were', 'glued', 'screen', 'few', 'moments', 'movie', 'history', 'match', 'scene', 'where', 'right', 'next', 'killer', 'who', 'gun', 'only', 'simple', 'description', 'go', 'about', 'five', 'six', 'people', 'right', 'front', 'Mifune', 'awesome', 'movie', 'worthy', 'buying', 'alone.Of', 'course', 'detective', 'story', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'characters', 'are', 'acted', 'out', 'supremely', 'well', 'Characteristic', 'Kurosawa', 'camera', 'used', 'perfection', 'music', 'used', 'wrap', 'story', 'dialog', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'surreal', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'atmosphere', 'thing', 'really', 'one', 'stratosphere', 'though', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'are', 'taken', 'seemingly', 'aspect', 'Japan', 'metropolis', 'see', 'people', 'sweating', 'up', 'storm', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'dispassionately', 'struggling', 'just', 'keep', 'alive', 'dangerous', 'world', 'metaphorical', 'also', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'love', 'film-noir', 'Kurosawa', 'must', 'buy', 'movie', 'immediately']",N/A

One interesting fact is that the scene of the dog panting in the opening credits sequence caused problems when an ignorant American woman believed that the dog's panting was caused by the dog being deliberately infected with rabies. She assumed that since the Japanese ""were savages"" (as she believed),  that they'd be more than willing to such a thing. This is just an example of the rampant Anti-japanese sentiment that was still present even nearly half a decade after the end of the war. This is also mentioned in the commentary.The film has some excellent special features including a half hour documentary on the film's production titled, ""Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to Create"" and audio commentray by author and Japanese film scholar, Stephen Prince.

First, it shows what post-World War II Japan looked like around 1949 when it was rebuilding and before the economic miracle set in.Second, it gives an attractive young woman a prominant role which is rare in Kurosawa movies.  This is Keiko Awaji who plays the showgirl Harumi Namiki.  Her entry into the movie contains what is one of the most memorable scenes in any movie.  This is when the camera suddenly shows a line of Japanese showgirls in skimpy costumes performing to American swing music.

25092,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0780020804,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Stray Dog gets off to a surprisingly slack start, not helped by some utterly redundant narration that repeats what we have heard in the previous scene and will see in the next. Because it's Kurosawa, some might ascribe some higher purpose to it, but since he immediately abandons it, it seems more a lack of confidence than design. At other times he seems to be overly in love with his footage: there's not a duff shot in the wildly overlong poverty montage of Toshiro Mifune going undercover as a vagrant, but it's hard to justify the seven minutes given over to the scene.Yet the film gradually exerts a grip as it becomes increasingly clear that Kurosawa's intent is not just to deliver a thriller but also a movie dealing with the effect of crime on its victims and the dehumanising effect on both those who commit it and those charged with retribution, as rookie cop Mifune takes his first steps down the road that will inevitably lead to the death of sympathy and empathy. For all his western influences (not least a music score that constantly threatens to turn into Warren and Dubin's 'Remember My Forgotten Man' from 'Golddiggers of 1933' without ever quite going that far), Kurosawa avoids a hardboiled approach: Mifune's experienced partner Takashi Shimura is no hardass, although his easygoing amiability disguises a lack of compassion in what has become a repetitive job without urgency: while Mifune takes every crime committed with his stolen gun on his own shoulders, Shimura brushes aside his concerns by pointing out that if the killer hadn't used his gun ""he would have used a Browning instead.""There's a good sense of time and place, a post-war Tokyo when it was still a wooden city in the midst of a sweltering heatwave leading to a storm, and there's a good occasional sense of detail, such as the great piece of detection at the end as Mifune eliminates the other suspects waiting at a train station. However, it does rely on a little too much contrivance at times: is it really credible that Mifune would forget not just to inform his colleagues of the killer's location but set off without a gun? This isn't Kurosawa at the peak of his powers by any means, but there's definitely the sense of a filmmaker working his way up.",3,"Police Procedural, Kurosawa style",1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2249,"['Stray', 'Dog', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'slack', 'start', 'not', 'helped', 'utterly', 'redundant', 'narration', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'previous', 'scene', 'will', 'see', 'next', 'Kurosawa', 'might', 'ascribe', 'higher', 'purpose', 'immediately', 'more', 'lack', 'confidence', 'design', 'other', 'times', 'be', 'overly', 'love', 'footage', 'not', 'duff', 'shot', 'wildly', 'overlong', 'poverty', 'montage', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'going', 'undercover', 'vagrant', 'hard', 'justify', 'seven', 'minutes', 'given', 'scene.Yet', 'film', 'gradually', 'grip', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'Kurosawa', 'intent', 'not', 'just', 'deliver', 'thriller', 'also', 'movie', 'dealing', 'effect', 'crime', 'victims', 'dehumanising', 'effect', 'who', 'commit', 'charged', 'retribution', 'rookie', 'cop', 'Mifune', 'first', 'steps', 'down', 'road', 'will', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'death', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'western', 'influences', 'not', 'least', 'music', 'score', 'constantly', 'turn', 'Warren', 'Dubin', ""'Remember"", 'My', 'Forgotten', 'Man', ""'Golddiggers"", '1933', 'ever', 'quite', 'going', 'far', 'Kurosawa', 'hardboiled', 'approach', 'Mifune', 'experienced', 'partner', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'hardass', 'easygoing', 'amiability', 'lack', 'compassion', 'what', 'become', 'repetitive', 'job', 'urgency', 'Mifune', 'crime', 'committed', 'stolen', 'gun', 'own', 'shoulders', 'Shimura', 'brushes', 'aside', 'concerns', 'pointing', 'out', 'killer', 'had', ""n't"", 'used', 'gun', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'Browning', 'instead', 'good', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'post-war', 'Tokyo', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'wooden', 'city', 'midst', 'sweltering', 'heatwave', 'leading', 'storm', 'good', 'occasional', 'sense', 'detail', 'such', 'great', 'piece', 'detection', 'end', 'Mifune', 'other', 'suspects', 'waiting', 'train', 'station', 'However', 'rely', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'contrivance', 'times', 'really', 'credible', 'Mifune', 'would', 'forget', 'not', 'just', 'inform', 'colleagues', 'killer', 'location', 'set', 'off', 'gun', ""n't"", 'Kurosawa', 'peak', 'powers', 'means', 'definitely', 'sense', 'filmmaker', 'working', 'way', 'up']",N/A
25093,ABUEUI62QAK7F,0780020804,vanhubris,"[1, 1]","Released in 1949-this movie stars Toshiro Mifune in one of his earliest roles as Tokyo cop Murakami, who's gun is stolen which leads to his relentless drive to recover the weapon-which is being used in a crime spree.We actually see very little of Yusa-the man who winds up with the gun--and I'm not totally convinced that the use of the name was not coincidental considering Japan was occupied by the YU-S-A at the time.  Perhaps Mifunes attempt to retrieve the missing gun and restore his honor is symbolic of Japans attempt to restore it's honor after the War.  Then again-I may be reading into this and it may not be any such thing--however Kurosawa himself-in regard to problems with the American SPCA and this movie stated ""I never at any other moment experienced a stronger sense of regret over Japan's losing the war""  Regerdless, as in other films such as ""Madadayo"" and ""Rhapsody in August""-Kurosawa touched on the conflict and the Atomic Bomb-and not implying that he was anti-American--I thnk it's a possibility that Yusa could have had symbolic meaning.That theory aside, this is an excellent movie-which is preserved quite well considering it's age and the conditions when it was filmed--when neither Mifune or Kurosawa were major stars and Japan was still recovering from the war.  While Mifune is my favorite actor--I'm so used to him playing a Samurai--that this role took a little getting used to--but his performance is quite good-as one would expect!Basically, this story revolves around Murakami (Mifune) who is mentored by Sato (Takashi Shimura) and their  pursuit of the missing gun and Yusa (Isao Kimura).  If nothing else-this film is fascinating for it's historical presentation of post war JapanAny Mifune/Kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie!While quite different-a more recent movie with the same basic premise which is very good is ""The Missing Gun""",5,Pre-Samurai Mifune,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,1879,"['Released', '1949-this', 'movie', 'stars', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'Tokyo', 'cop', 'Murakami', 'who', 'gun', 'stolen', 'relentless', 'drive', 'recover', 'weapon-which', 'being', 'used', 'crime', 'spree.We', 'actually', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'Yusa-the', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'gun', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'convinced', 'use', 'name', 'was', 'not', 'coincidental', 'considering', 'Japan', 'was', 'occupied', 'YU-S-A', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'Mifunes', 'attempt', 'retrieve', 'missing', 'gun', 'restore', 'honor', 'symbolic', 'Japans', 'attempt', 'restore', 'honor', 'War', 'Then', 'again-I', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'thing', 'however', 'Kurosawa', 'himself-in', 'regard', 'problems', 'American', 'SPCA', 'movie', 'stated', 'never', 'other', 'moment', 'experienced', 'stronger', 'sense', 'regret', 'Japan', 'losing', 'war', 'Regerdless', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Madadayo', 'Rhapsody', 'August', '-Kurosawa', 'touched', 'conflict', 'Atomic', 'Bomb-and', 'not', 'implying', 'was', 'anti-American', 'thnk', 'possibility', 'Yusa', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'symbolic', 'meaning.That', 'theory', 'aside', 'excellent', 'movie-which', 'preserved', 'quite', 'well', 'considering', 'age', 'conditions', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'when', 'Mifune', 'Kurosawa', 'were', 'major', 'stars', 'Japan', 'was', 'still', 'recovering', 'war', 'Mifune', 'favorite', 'actor', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'playing', 'Samurai', 'role', 'took', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'performance', 'quite', 'good-as', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Basically', 'story', 'Murakami', 'Mifune', 'who', 'mentored', 'Sato', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'pursuit', 'missing', 'gun', 'Yusa', 'Isao', 'Kimura', 'nothing', 'else-this', 'film', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'presentation', 'post', 'war', 'JapanAny', 'Mifune/Kurosawa', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'quite', 'different-a', 'more', 'recent', 'movie', 'same', 'basic', 'premise', 'very', 'good', 'Missing', 'Gun']",N/A

Entering the film somewhat late, Shimura, as the elder, more experienced detective, is a characterization of the older, prewar generation that helped restore structure to Japanese life in the late 40's.  Mifune, whose character was a war veteran, desperately tries to recover a pistol stolen from him by a pickpocket, only to find that the weapon is now being used by a criminal who has murdered several people with it.  Mifune's energetic and intense portrayal is balanced by Shimura's calm and mentoring approach.  This is, in my opinion, one of Kurosawa's finest films, and one of his best character studies.",5,The best of Kurosawa's &quot;postwar&quot; movies,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,762,"['Kurosawa', 'offering', 'may', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'stalled', 'camera', 'work', 'studies', 'human', 'nature', 'postwar', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'veritable', 'time', 'capsule', 'Entering', 'film', 'somewhat', 'late', 'Shimura', 'elder', 'more', 'experienced', 'detective', 'characterization', 'older', 'prewar', 'generation', 'helped', 'restore', 'structure', 'Japanese', 'life', 'late', '40', 'Mifune', 'character', 'was', 'war', 'veteran', 'desperately', 'recover', 'pistol', 'stolen', 'pickpocket', 'only', 'find', 'weapon', 'now', 'being', 'used', 'criminal', 'who', 'murdered', 'several', 'people', 'Mifune', 'energetic', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'balanced', 'Shimura', 'calm', 'mentoring', 'approach', 'opinion', 'one', 'Kurosawa', 'finest', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'character', 'studies']",N/A
25095,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,0780020804,Zack Davisson,"[0, 1]","Few films capture the stifling, inescapable heat of a Japanese summer in the same way as ""Stray Dog"" (""Nora Inu."")  When the showgirl Harumi collapses in a sweaty heap amongst the other dancers, desperately attempting to gain some relief, one can truly feel the insane heat, the pouring sweat and the apathetic sense of despair that accompanies the painful weather.  She is a sympathetic companion to the opening shot of the panting dog, roasting in the blazing sun.They are all dogs here.  Det. Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) is a bold young pup, quick to cover his shame over losing his pistol with a snapping rage.  Harumi (Keiko Awaji) is a sleek scavenger, taking what she can from whomever she can.  Det. Sato (Takashi Shimura) is a wise old hound who has seen hot summers before, and knows when to lie in the shade.  Together, they make an uneasy pack, hunting the bone that is Murakami's lost gun.  With each murder committed with the weapon, the scene becomes more intense, the hunt more frantic. The dogs more willing to take chances.  And make mistakes.Easily one of his best films, Kurosawa takes the genre of Film Noir and spins it into the social commentary that was his vision.  Devil or Angel, each character is a cool reflection of each other, with only circumstance and desperation turning a hero into a villain, or the other way around.  He paints occupation Japan as a scrambling junk yard, a desperate place where you can rent a gun for a few hours to commit a crime, and your ration card is all you need for payment.  Harry Lime (""The Third Man"") would have made a killing in this dog-eat-dog environment.The Criterion Collection DVD pays full tribute to this, Kurosawa's first masterpiece.  Stephen Prince (author or Kurosawa book, ""The Warrior's Camera"") provides the commentary, as he did ""Ikiru.""  Another fine documentary from the ""Akira Kurosawa: It's Wonderful to Create"" series is included, along with a selection from Kurosawa's own autobiography.
