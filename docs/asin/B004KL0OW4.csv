Though the titling may confuse some fans who were unaware of this, it's still an amazing collection.",4,False titling or not?,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,308,"['third', 'volume', 'season', '2', 'documents', 'episodes', 'have', 'aired', '2009-2010', 'television', 'season', 'was', 'called', 'iCarly', 'third', 'season', 'actually', 'was', 'second', 'half', 'season', '2', 'production', 'titling', 'may', 'confuse', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'unaware', 'still', 'amazing', 'collection']","iCarly: Season 2, Volume Three"

I also know that, through writing this review, I am sure to attract negative votes from customers, seeing as it IS a very popular television series, after all, but before you decide my critique was unhelpful, please read the whole review first because I have several points to get across that may be of service to you.The program's comedy falls under several different categories on various occasions; humorous, funny, hilarious, and ABSOLUTELY CORNY. It has made a few hysterical jokes before, and some of them can make you chuckle, but a majority of the time, the characters deliver jokes that are so stupid and laughably bad that it can remind you of a parody of a sitcom you once saw on television that was deliberately designed to epitomize the worst situation comedy imaginable, chockfull of poor acting and cheesy jokes. Albeit you may not realize that they are corny at first, they really, really are. And there have been quite a few instances where the characters have made corny jokes, and then kept mentioning them several times throughout the episode or scene and wearing them thin. They even have done this before with some of their better jokes. Spencer's portrayer has a tendency to frequently overact when trying to act like a man-child, and it comes off as annoying, not funny. He also has a tendency to crack cheesy jokes, perhaps even a bit more than other people in the series, though Carly's character does too. Some other actors experience bouts of overacting at some points too, though mostly it is just Spencer. It is very teeny-bopper, and the main character, Carly, possesses some Mary-Suish characteristics. (If you don't know what a Mary Sue is, it is a fictional stock character devoid of flaws and filled with perfection). Albeit Carly is not THOROUGHLY perfect, she is portrayed as being pretty, many boys are infatuated with her, she gets good grades, leads a teeny-bopper's dream life, and, 98% of the time, she wins. She only has lost or failed on a few occasions, but most of the time, she has succeeded and topped her rivals with help from her friends. That just gets really boring eventually, to be honest. There is Team Edward/Team Jacob-style shipping between characters. To be honest, this is not the greatest program that Nickelodeon has ever broadcast, and should never have earned all the hubbub that it has attracted. It is not EXTREMELY entertaining at all, and grows boring to watch. I hope that I have helped you out.",2,Not the Best,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,2544,"['know', 'iCarly', 'very', 'popular', 'personally', 'find', 'quite', 'overrated', 'also', 'know', 'writing', 'review', 'am', 'sure', 'attract', 'negative', 'votes', 'customers', 'seeing', 'very', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'decide', 'critique', 'was', 'unhelpful', 'please', 'read', 'whole', 'review', 'first', 'have', 'several', 'points', 'get', 'may', 'be', 'service', 'you.The', 'program', 'comedy', 'several', 'different', 'categories', 'various', 'occasions', 'humorous', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'CORNY', 'made', 'few', 'hysterical', 'jokes', 'can', 'make', 'chuckle', 'majority', 'time', 'characters', 'jokes', 'are', 'so', 'stupid', 'laughably', 'bad', 'can', 'remind', 'parody', 'sitcom', 'once', 'saw', 'television', 'was', 'deliberately', 'designed', 'epitomize', 'worst', 'situation', 'comedy', 'imaginable', 'chockfull', 'poor', 'acting', 'cheesy', 'jokes', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'are', 'corny', 'first', 'really', 'really', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'made', 'corny', 'jokes', 'then', 'kept', 'mentioning', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'scene', 'wearing', 'thin', 'even', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'jokes', 'Spencer', 'portrayer', 'tendency', 'frequently', 'overact', 'when', 'trying', 'act', 'man-child', 'off', 'annoying', 'not', 'funny', 'also', 'tendency', 'crack', 'cheesy', 'jokes', 'perhaps', 'even', 'bit', 'more', 'other', 'people', 'series', 'Carly', 'character', 'too', 'other', 'actors', 'experience', 'bouts', 'overacting', 'points', 'too', 'though', 'mostly', 'just', 'Spencer', 'very', 'teeny-bopper', 'main', 'character', 'Carly', 'Mary-Suish', 'characteristics', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'fictional', 'stock', 'character', 'devoid', 'flaws', 'filled', 'perfection', 'Albeit', 'Carly', 'not', 'THOROUGHLY', 'perfect', 'portrayed', 'being', 'pretty', 'many', 'boys', 'are', 'infatuated', 'good', 'grades', 'teeny-bopper', 'dream', 'life', '98', '%', 'time', 'only', 'lost', 'failed', 'few', 'occasions', 'most', 'time', 'succeeded', 'topped', 'rivals', 'help', 'friends', 'just', 'really', 'boring', 'eventually', 'be', 'honest', 'Team', 'Edward/Team', 'Jacob-style', 'shipping', 'characters', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'greatest', 'program', 'Nickelodeon', 'ever', 'broadcast', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'earned', 'hubbub', 'attracted', 'not', 'EXTREMELY', 'entertaining', 'boring', 'watch', 'hope', 'have', 'helped', 'out']","iCarly: Season 2, Volume Three"
