1061029,A23V875B0Q9HT7,B000NVT0RU,Agustin Guerrero,"[3, 7]","I had big expectations for this movie according to the reviews received.  It was not a very powerful drama and as a war movie it was light in the action, I consider it slow moving and very talky.  As stating a case for returning the retirement benefits for the North African soldiers that fought for France in World War II that were suspended after the Independence of Morocco and Algiers from France it makes a point.It did not shock me the mistreatment and contempt the French authorities provided the North African soldiers as they were considered second class citizens of the colonies (the first class citizens were the French living in the colonies calles Pied Noir) and not even French nationals.  The North African soldiers were fighting for their oppressors in reality.  It is ironic that while Americans, Canadians, Brits, Poles and scores of people from different nationalities and continents were fighting for the freedom of France against Nazi Germany at the same time France was keeping a sizable number of their military keeping tha French colonies in North Africa and Asia in line. In this situation of double moral standards using people considered inferior as cannon fodder I believe was only expected.  The North African volunteers or Indigenes were not fighting for freedom, equality or brotherhood and specially not for France, each had motivations other than love of country as we can attest in the movie most went to Europe for plunder and payment, as mercenary soldiers.  It is well known fact that during the Italian campaign around Monte Cassino that by the way was won using French colonial troopers lead by General Juin where Brit, New Zealander, American, Pole and Indian troops had already failed the most hated soldiers by the Italian populace were the North African Goums because of their wide spread looting and raping.  Knowing these facts I am not very well inclined to feel weepy for these men.About the movie, the battle in Italy is well choreographed could have been more informative if we knew what battle we are talking about, is it the taking of the hills sorrounding the german positions at Monte Cassino ?  It is only referred as Italy 1944.  We see few germans a couple of machine gun nests and a mortar pit composing the obstacles the Indigenes have to surmount for their first victory, but was it an important victory, did it accomplish something in the full scope of the Italian campaign?  Maybe if we knew this was a mile stone or something important was accomplished we would be more inclined to support the claims of the North Africans for their justs pensions and benefits from the French Goverment.The battle in France is too talky, we are mostly presented with the injustices of white non coms being promoted ahead of the Ber Bers but we don't know if the Indigenes were really deserving of faster promotion, the French Sargeant Martinez and the Corporal are very good leaders of men as  they are presented and certainly demonstrated better judgement and authority than the Indigene coprporal so this case is not well presented.  We see an unconvincing romance between an Indigene soldier and a French lady and somehow we are led to believe that a one night stand is so significant in the life of the soldier called Mahmmoud that he is willing to desert his post and face the possibility of imprisonment and maybe death just to return to Marseilles and see her, I did not see enough chemistry or even emphaty between these characters to believe this.  As for the authorities trying to keep the Senegalese and North African soldiers away from the population by denying them home leave or even the privilege of getting uncensored letters was probably to be expected as I already said these were considered only cannon fodder and a little better than lootists and thiefs.  Yes, they were fighting for France but still were treated as dangerous foreigners.  But we have to consider the position of the French authorities that dreamed with returning France to its former glory retining its prestige and of course its colonies it was not in their best interest to provide equality for their colonial nationals.  Remember that many of these authorities have openly cooperated with the nazis during the occupation and the Vichy free government.The last battle in Alsace was the main point and we can see at last courage and determination in the North African soldiers as they defend a position against a german attack with greater numbers and equipment than thay had even when they have their French officers killed and rendered unfit to fight.  This is a nice small action a la Saving Private Ryan and probably saves the film from being boring and tedious.I believe that France should repay its veterans no matter the ancestry for their contributions during the war and that the pensions should be returned, maybe this is the whole point of the movie but could have been presented in a more convincing fashion.",3,Below  my

1061030,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000NVT0RU,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[1, 1]","Some movies move us with their exquisite craftsmanship, superb acting, and luxurious cinematography while others affect us by the power of their story alone.  One such film is Rachid Bouchareb`s long-overdue tale about France`s forgotten African war heroes.`Days of Glory` charts the fates of those African soldiers who gave their blood and lives to free a nation that refused them sovereignty and equality. Director Bouchareb does an admirable job of whittling down this enormous history lesson into a tale of forlorn sacrifice.The film centers around the lives of four poverty-stricken North Africans who for various reasons volunteer to help rid France of tyranny. Abdelkader (magnificently played by Sami Bouajila) is an Algerian who on account of his literacy is immediately sent to NCO training.  A passionate idealist, Abdelkader firmly believes the war is being fought for the ideals of `liberty, equality and fraternity.`  He hopes that these will be granted to France`s African citizens as well.  Said (Jamel Debbouze) is a good-hearted shepherd from the dirt poor hinterlands of Algeria.  Despite his doting mother`s attempts to delay his enlistment, Said joins up with the tall, handsome Messaoud (Roshdy Zem) who soon becomes his unit`s crack marksman.Their baptism of fire arrives during the Allies` grinding advance through Italy.  The French colonials are given the task of cracking a path through the hardscrabble Italian mountains.  The Algerians charge up a hill raked by German mortar and machine gun fire.  Alongside them are the mountain Berbers of Morocco, the `goumiers.`  One of them, Yassir (Samy Naceri), soon becomes one of the main characters of the story.While all four survive their first taste of combat, they soon face equally sinister challenges from their own side.  Like Asian, Latino and African Americans during WWII, France`s colonial soldiers fought two wars: one against the Nazis and one against discrimination in the ranks.  When African soldiers are denied the same food rations as others, Abdelkader raises his voice in protest.  During their off-duty time, the North Africans are forced to watch a ballet presentation.  They chaff at having to endure something so foreign to their culture.  Again, Abdelkader turns the ensuing melee into a street protest with the soldiers demanding respect and recognition.  Bouchareb throws in these scenes of chronic injustice when you least expect them.  The African NCO`s are routinely overlooked for promotion, R&R; leave is denied the African soldiers, and most insidiously, their mail is constantly censored.While the Africans help liberate France, the film too marches from anecdote to anecdote.  None of these are developed to any great extent, but yet they help us better understand the protagonists` predicaments.  Yet, some of these moments do wear thin in terms of plausibility.  When the troops liberate a French town, Said begins to chat up a pretty tricolor-waving girl.  He drones on about his profound attachment to `la patrie,` to the befuddled teen`s confusion.  Hard to believe that this would be any soldier`s first words to a girl he was trying to woo.For the most part, `Days of Glory` ambles along as a good film, but one with a great story to tell.  By the end though, the film itself rises to the level of its story.  In a final breathtaking scene, all four characters are thrown together one last time.  Their task is to hold a village until reinforcements arrive.  Abdelkader, Said, Messaud and Yassir fight for their lives and more importantly, for each other.  Bound tenuously by a common continent, religion, and language, all four fight with a selflessness and sense of sacrifice that binds them into a true brotherhood.  After the chaos and carnage settles, Abdelkader once again has his idealism shattered.  The French reinforcements claim the victory their Algerian and Moroccan brothers fought and died for.By telling this story, Bouchareb has done what all filmmakers should aspire to: provoke a change with their film.  After supposedly viewing the film in 2006, President Chirac freed up colonial soldiers` pension money frozen since 1959.  `Days of Glory` is a very entertaining and moving story that should be seen by history buffs and serious film fans alike.  Those looking for a vacuous action-packed war film best look elsewhere.  `Days` isn`t so much about war as about the cruel sacrifices it extracts.  Yet, it also shows how grievous injustices can be righted some 60 years after the fact.  American filmmakers should take note from Bouchareb`s success.  The Tuskegee airmen or the Africans` blood brothers in Alsace, the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team are still waiting for someone to tell their equally compelling and worthy stories.",5,Finally Told,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,4781,"['movies', 'move', 'exquisite', 'craftsmanship', 'superb', 'acting', 'luxurious', 'cinematography', 'others', 'affect', 'power', 'story',

I have visited a Moslem cemetery and have read about many Moslems participating with the Allies in WWII.According to Wikipedia ""in 2009 the BBC published documentary evidence that showed that black colonial soldiers-who together with North African troops made up around two-thirds of the Free French forces-were deliberately removed from the units that led the Allied advance to liberate Paris in 1944... black soldiers should be replaced by  white and North African ones from other units"".  Apparently, there was discrimination and bigotry occurring at that time.This is not to say that the Moslem troops were all saints.

1061036,A2SXGU7L6VLJ5P,B000NVT0RU,Gogol,"[8, 8]","An intense film that while has often been compared to Saving Private Ryan other than them both being war films has very little in common.The film depicts Algerian soldiers who had volunteered to fight in the French army during world war 2.  The film begins with a village elder in Algeria calling upon the men to fight for the 'motherland' France against German occupation.  When enlisted, they are brought together with North African troops who had already been fighting in North Africa and were to be posted to France.  They are put under the command of an Algerian born French officer, given the most basic of training and then sent to the front.Their first battle is to take a hilltop heavily fortified by German forces.  While suffering heavy casualties they manage to capture the position.  Encouraged by their success and now with valuable military experience they are greeted as heroes in France.  Still prejudice is never far away.  The first most obvious example we are give is when on board a boat the men are receiving a meal however, the chef refuses to give a tomato to a black soldier resulting in a minor mutiny that is only quelled when their commanding officer assures them that all will receive the same rations.The army unit moves to the mountains where they are commanded to hold positions in freezing conditions while white French troops are given leave, finally they are given leave only to return back to be given a mission to hold a small French village under near impossible conditions.Much of the film is given to developing each character.  One is an illiterate man from a village, incapable of making his own decisions and quickly falls under the leadership of his commanding officer.  Another is a fairly well educated man who seeks promotion in the army and sees himself as a career officer.  Then we have two brothers and a man who falls in love with a local girl and hopes that when the war ends, he may return to her and settle down in Marseilles.  Finally, there is their commanding officer, who while born in Algeria sees himself as very much French with something of a colonial contempt for the Arabs while keeping a dark secret hidden.While there is ample time for character development and throughout the film you do come to relate to the characters I found it interesting that the black African soldiers barely said a word (Other than complain about not getting a tomato) and played very much a background role.  No doubt they were Senegalese troops due to their dress and there does exists a fair amount of racism towards black Africans by some Arabs so I would have been interested to see something of that examined in the film.  I felt the simple ""All us colonials together"" A little far fetched.That out of the main characters one it seems wishes to remain in France, another begins to feel increasingly that while Fighting for the freedom of France that should also extend to his own people I found quite realistic.  I have spoken to many Africans who had fought during the second word war and many tell of how on returning from the war saw the freedom of their own nation just as important as the freedom of Britain or France for which they fought.The fact that it has took so long to recognise the contribution of 'colonial' troops during the second world war both in the cinema and in history books may go some way to explain why some would see this film as 'politically correct'  The fact that France frozen the pensions of these men who fought to free their country is a source of shame.This is a touching film.  One of the concluding scenes where after the Algerian troops having fought so bravely to defend the village the photographer takes pictures of white troops celebrating with local villages was an excellent way in showing how history has been whitewashed.Well worth watching.",4,Long overdue.,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,3836,"['intense', 'film', 'while', 'often', 'been', 'compared', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'other', 'being', 'war', 'films', 'very', 'little', 'common.The', 'film', 'depicts', 'Algerian', 'soldiers', 'who', 'had', 'volunteered', 'fight', 'French', 'army', 'world', 'war', '2', 'film', 'village', 'elder', 'Algeria', 'calling', 'men', 'fight', ""'motherland"", 'France', 'German', 'occupation', 'When', 'enlisted', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'North', 'African', 'troops', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'fighting', 'North', 'Africa', 'were', 'be', 'posted', 'France', 'are', 'put', 'command', 'Algerian', 'born', 'French', 'officer', 'given', 'most', 'basic', 'training', 'then', 'sent', 'front.Their', 'first', 'battle', 'take', 'hilltop', 'heavily', 'fortified', 'German', 'forces', 'suffering', 'heavy', 'casualties', 'manage', 'capture', 'position', 'Encouraged', 'success', 'now', 'valuable', 'military', 'experience', 'are', 'greeted', 'heroes', 'France', 'Still', 'prejudice', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'first', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'are', 'give', 'when', 'board', 'boat', 'men', 'are', 'receiving', 'meal', 'however', 'chef', 'give', 'tomato', 'black', 'soldier', 'resulting', 'minor', 'mutiny', 'only', 'quelled', 'when', 'commanding', 'officer', 'will', 'receive', 'same', 'rations.The', 'army', 'unit', 'mountains', 'where', 'are', 'commanded', 'hold', 'positions', 'freezing', 'conditions', 'white', 'French', 'troops', 'are', 'given', 'leave', 'finally', 'are', 'given', 'leave', 'only', 'return', 'back', 'be', 'given', 'mission', 'hold', 'small', 'French', 'village', 'impossible', 'conditions.Much', 'film', 'given', 'developing', 'character', 'One', 'illiterate', 'man', 'village', 'incapable', 'making', 'own', 'decisions', 'quickly', 'falls', 'leadership', 'commanding', 'officer', 'fairly', 'well', 'educated', 'man', 'who', 'promotion', 'army', 'career', 'officer', 'Then', 'have', 'two', 'brothers', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'when', 'war', 'may', 'return', 'settle', 'down', 'Marseilles', 'Finally', 'commanding', 'officer', 'who', 'born', 'Algeria', 'very', 'much', 'French', 'something', 'colonial', 'contempt', 'Arabs', 'keeping', 'dark', 'secret', 'hidden.While', 'ample', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'do', 'come', 'relate', 'characters', 'found', 'interesting', 'black', 'African', 'soldiers', 'barely', 'said', 'word', 'Other', 'complain', 'not', 'getting', 'tomato', 'played', 'very', 'much', 'background', 'role', 'doubt', 'were', 'Senegalese', 'troops', 'due', 'dress', 'there', 'fair', 'amount', 'racism', 'towards', 'black', 'Africans', 'Arabs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'see', 'something', 'examined', 'film', 'felt', 'simple', 'colonials', 'together', 'little', 'far', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'wishes', 'remain', 'France', 'feel', 'increasingly', 'Fighting', 'freedom', 'France', 'should', 'also', 'extend', 'own', 'people', 'found', 'quite', 'realistic', 'have', 'spoken', 'many', 'Africans', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'second', 'word', 'war', 'many', 'tell', 'how', 'returning', 'war', 'saw', 'freedom', 'own', 'nation', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'freedom', 'Britain', 'France', 'fought.The', 'fact', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'recognise', 'contribution', ""'colonial"", 'troops', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'cinema', 'history', 'books', 'may', 'go', 'way', 'explain', 'why', 'would', 'see', 'film', ""'politically"", 'correct', 'fact', 'France', 'frozen', 'pensions', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'free', 'country', 'source', 'shame.This', 'touching', 'film', 'One', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'where', 'Algerian', 'troops', 'having', 'fought', 'so', 'bravely', 'defend', 'village', 'photographer', 'pictures', 'white', 'troops', 'celebrating', 'local', 'villages', 'was', 'excellent', 'way', 'showing', 'how', 'history', 'been', 'whitewashed.Well', 'worth', 'watching']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
1061037,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000NVT0RU,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","'Indig&egrave;nes' (DAYS OF GLORY) as written by Olivier Lorelle and Rachid Bouchareb (who also directed) is a film of visceral power, another aspect of World War II that has not been addressed and that points to problems of inequality among fighting troops that still exists. It is a grisly film (how can a film about war not be?) but shares a viewpoint that is as shocking as it is important.During WW II the French military incorporated African men including a large number of Algerian soldiers to fight the Nazis and protect France (and, yes, its protectorates) from oppression. The story focuses on four of these Algerian soldiers who leave their homeland to fight for the ideals of France yet are victims of discrimination and inequality of treatment and advancement, even when they are selected to perform the most hazardous of duties. The men vary from idealist to illiterate but their sense of camaraderie is rock solid: Sad Otmari (Jamel Debbouze) is unable to read or write and has only one arm, yet he is devoted to his mission of saving France and hence his family in Algeria; Yassir (Samy Naceri) proves to be a marksman and is the one selected to be front man during the most dangerous encounters; Messaoud Souni (Roschdy Zem) finds solace in the love of a French girl Ir&egrave;ne (Aur&eacute;lie Eltvedt) but his communications with her are censured by the military; Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila) is the natural leader among the four yet is not advanced in rank when the Frenchmen are. The only non-Algerian who is supportive of these men is Sergeant Roger Martinez (Bernard Blancan) who attempts intervention with the French over the disillusioned Algerians. In many ways the story is related through the reactions of Abdelkader, especially the heartbreaking ending.It is the final act of courage when these four men are assigned to assist the American forces in Alsace, an assignment so devastatingly dangerous that no other French forces would accept, that the love and devotion of these men is supremely tested. And as the fragile victory over the Nazis is claimed by the French, we see the last of the Algerian quartet walk unnoticed and uncelebrated through the freed Alsatian town. If the 60 years later ending of the film is a bit maudlin for some viewers, it still makes a solid statement about the courage of these men, fighting for a 'motherland' that all but ignored them. And the story is true!The battle scenes are realistic, the acting is first caliber, and the production values are excellent, including the cinematography by Patrick Blossier and a musical score by Armand Amar and Cheb Khaled that enhances every aspect of a multicultural war. This is a film about WW II that stands with the best of the stories about the physical and emotional atrocities that war produces. In French and Arabic with subtitles. Highly recommended.

1061038,A98M1UJWF8D92,B000NVT0RU,"John E. Larsen ""Larso""","[1, 1]","This is a well made war film about the experiences of Algerian volunteers for Frances cause in WW2. The combat scenes are very good! There are lots of extras and the battles are well done - they do not look cheap. Or sanitized, some parts are quite graphic indeed (rigor mortis shown for instance). The opening fight for an Italian mountain is quite eye opening in terms of the difficulties in attacking entrenched positions on a steep, rocky mountainside. There aren't many places to hide! The Germans (regular infantry only as far as I could tell) pound away with mortars and MGs and to my eye looked the business. I'm no expert but they looked pretty authentic and certainly, given the focus is on the Algerians, were presented as professional and deadly. Certainly, they clearly inflict many casualties. Following Italy, the unit (7th Algerian) is sent to France, is on the line in the Vosges, with the final battle in Alsace.There are several key themes. A central one is the patriotism of so many of the North African soldiers. They refer to France as the mother country. They sing French songs and they take enormous pride in their role as liberators. This is despite a lot of discrimination. The French army is shown as being generally indifferent to them, constantly favouring French troops in terms of leave and promotions. There is also lots of petty discrimination, like ignoring mail needs and this is shown as being ever so destructive in its own right. Thus it was enthralling to see the reception the men got from local French civilians, who thanked them so wholeheartedly. I really enjoyed these scenes and it made some of the racism just that more painful. There are also a few scenes which deal with their religion.The final battle, in an Alsace village, is very powerful indeed. The combat scenes have a very authentic look to them - particularly the moment of being shot, if that makes any sense? No Hollywood throwing arms in the air, men drop like stones, it is chilling stuff. Given that the viewer now knows the characters, there is some wrenching stuff. I felt this fight was extremely well done. It is one of the most effective 'house to house' combat depictions I have ever seen.The film is in French, with English subtitles. I had no problem with this and I strongly recommend it as an insight into a little known aspect of the war but in particular for its compelling depictions of combat.",4,Gritty tale of France's Algerian volunteers.,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,2419,"['well', 'made', 'war', 'film', 'experiences', 'Algerian', 'volunteers', 'Frances', 'cause', 'WW2', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'lots', 'extras', 'battles', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'cheap', 'sanitized', 'parts', 'are', 'quite', 'graphic', 'indeed', 'rigor', 'mortis', 'shown', 'instance', 'opening', 'fight', 'Italian', 'mountain', 'quite', 'eye', 'opening', 'terms', 'difficulties', 'attacking', 'entrenched', 'positions', 'steep', 'rocky', 'mountainside', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'places', 'hide', 'Germans', 'regular', 'infantry', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'pound', 'away', 'mortars', 'MGs', 'eye', 'looked', 'business', ""'m"", 'expert', 'looked', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'certainly', 'given', 'focus', 'Algerians', 'were', 'presented', 'professional', 'deadly', 'Certainly', 'clearly', 'inflict', 'many', 'casualties', 'Following', 'Italy', 'unit', '7th', 'Algerian', 'sent', 'France', 'line', 'Vosges', 'final', 'battle', 'Alsace.There', 'are', 'several', 'key', 'themes', 'central', 'one', 'patriotism', 'so', 'many', 'North', 'African', 'soldiers', 'refer', 'France', 'mother', 'country', 'sing', 'French', 'songs', 'take', 'enormous', 'pride', 'role', 'liberators', 'lot', 'discrimination', 'French', 'army', 'shown', 'being', 'generally', 'indifferent', 'constantly', 'favouring', 'French', 'troops', 'terms', 'leave', 'promotions', 'also', 'lots', 'petty', 'discrimination', 'ignoring', 'mail', 'needs', 'shown', 'being', 'ever', 'so', 'destructive', 'own', 'right', 'Thus', 'was', 'enthralling', 'see', 'reception', 'men', 'got', 'local', 'French', 'civilians', 'who', 'thanked', 'so', 'wholeheartedly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'made', 'racism', 'just', 'more', 'painful', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'deal', 'religion.The', 'final', 'battle', 'Alsace', 'village', 'very', 'powerful', 'indeed', 'combat', 'scenes', 'have', 'very', 'authentic', 'look', 'particularly', 'moment', 'being', 'shot', 'sense', 'No', 'Hollywood', 'throwing', 'arms', 'air', 'men', 'drop', 'stones', 'chilling', 'stuff', 'Given', 'viewer', 'now', 'characters', 'wrenching', 'stuff', 'felt', 'fight', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'most', 'effective', ""'house"", 'house', 'combat', 'depictions', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'had', 'problem', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'insight', 'little', 'known', 'aspect', 'war', 'particular', 'compelling', 'depictions', 'combat']",Days of Glory: Indigenes

1061040,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B000NVT0RU,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","This 2006 movie is perhaps one of the best recreations of WWII combat. It has been called a ""North African Private Ryan"", and this is for a good reason. Director Rachid Bouchareb did a fantastic job in showing realistic battle scenes as well as creating unique characters that shine a light on a little known chapter of WWII. Bouchareb is a French Algerian who champions the sometimes problematic relationship between the two countries that make up his identity. This movie says alot about colonial rule and the complexities in alleigence that arise from soldiers fighting for a country that they truly do not know.Bouchareb's 2010 movie, ""Outside the Law"" is a follow up to this film in a way, which covers the Algerian revolution of the 1950's. Three of the main characters from ""Days of Glory"" are also used to show the different eras of warfare. Dual identity is a huge part of both films, as the characters struggle to define themselves during the hardships of war. Even though this film is French, the scenarios involved are a lot like war stories from minority groups within America, such as the all Japanese 442nd regiment, and the all black 92nd Infantry Division. These units were segregated, using white officers. Their stories are often as much about upward mobility as the war itself. Military service has often been a springboard for minority groups to advance within a society. The fact that the men who are depicted in this movie did not receive the recognition of their American counterparts is one of Bouchareb's main themes. This movie goes a long way in telling the story of the Algerian and Moroccan Divisions that fought for the Free French Army in Italy, France and Germany,  and due to the problematic situations in the Arab world, they were not recognized as having laid down their lives for the Allies.There are multiple themes that run throughout this film, but obviously the combat experiences of the 7th Algerian Regiment make up the definitive scenes. Many war films are done with a ""catch"", or some twist that makes the story extraordinary so that it will sell more tickets. There are very few productions which get to do a straight combat narrative without throwing in these twists, often making the film a bit less realistic. This film covers such an interesting topic, that a twist was not necessary. The political and racial commentary provide all the subtext in between combat scenes.The story centers around a few members of the Algerian division and their French officers. Besides the two main combat scenes that bookend the story, the characters are very individuated. Each one has their own little story that fits into the larger movement of the war. The beginning of the movie follows the enlistment in North Africa for a variety of reasons, mainly to escape the poverty and perhaps earn a better way of life through service to France. The first combat scene begins only a few minutes into the film, and it is an amazing depiction of mountain warfare in Italy. In fact, there are so few war movies about the Italian campaign, I would say this scene is the best example of Italian combat ever made. Many historians credit the Algerian and Moroccan division in breaking the  Gustav line in 1944, a feat which had not been accomplished up till that point. The story then follows the men's contribution to the liberation of Southern France. Many get to see the country they risk their lives for, if only for a brief time.",5,Amazing portrayal of French Colonial troops in WWII,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,3458,"['2006', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'recreations', 'WWII', 'combat', 'been', 'called', 'North', 'African', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'good', 'reason', 'Director', 'Rachid', 'Bouchareb', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'showing', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'unique', 'characters', 'shine', 'light', 'little', 'known', 'chapter', 'WWII', 'Bouchareb', 'French', 'Algerian', 'who', 'sometimes', 'problematic', 'relationship', 'two', 'countries', 'make', 'up', 'identity', 'movie', 'alot', 'colonial', 'rule', 'complexities', 'alleigence', 'arise', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'country', 'truly', 'do', 'not', 'know.Bouchareb', '2010', 'movie', 'Law', 'follow', 'up', 'film', 'way', 'Algerian', 'revolution', '1950', 'Three', 'main', 'characters', 'Days', 'Glory', 'are', 'also', 'used', 'show', 'different', 'eras', 'warfare', 'Dual', 'identity', 'huge', 'part', 'films', 'characters', 'struggle', 'define', 'hardships', 'war', 'Even', 'film', 'French', 'scenarios', 'involved', 'are', 'lot', 'war', 'stories', 'minority', 'groups', 'America', 'such', 'Japanese', '442nd', 'regiment', 'black', '92nd', 'Infantry', 'Division', 'units', 'were', 'segregated', 'using', 'white', 'officers', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'upward', 'mobility', 'war', 'Military', 'service', 'often', 'been', 'springboard', 'minority', 'groups', 'advance', 'society', 'fact', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'depicted', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'recognition', 'American', 'counterparts', 'one', 'Bouchareb', 'main', 'themes', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'Algerian', 'Moroccan', 'Divisions', 'fought', 'Free', 'French', 'Army', 'Italy', 'France', 'Germany', 'due', 'problematic', 'situations', 'Arab', 'world', 'were', 'not', 'recognized', 'having', 'laid', 'down', 'lives', 'Allies.There', 'are', 'multiple', 'themes', 'run', 'film', 'obviously', 'combat', 'experiences', '7th', 'Algerian', 'Regiment', 'make', 'up', 'definitive', 'scenes', 'Many', 'war', 'films', 'are', 'done', 'catch', 'twist', 'story', 'extraordinary', 'will', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'productions', 'get', 'do', 'straight', 'combat', 'narrative', 'throwing', 'twists', 'often', 'making', 'film', 'bit', 'less', 'realistic', 'film', 'interesting', 'topic', 'twist', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'political', 'racial', 'commentary', 'provide', 'subtext', 'combat', 'scenes.The', 'story', 'centers', 'few', 'members', 'Algerian', 'division', 'French', 'officers', 'two', 'main', 'combat', 'scenes', 'bookend', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'individuated', 'one', 'own', 'little', 'story', 'larger', 'movement', 'war', 'beginning', 'movie', 'enlistment', 'North', 'Africa', 'variety', 'reasons', 'mainly', 'escape', 'poverty', 'perhaps', 'earn', 'better', 'way', 'life', 'service', 'France', 'first', 'combat', 'scene', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'amazing', 'depiction', 'mountain', 'warfare', 'Italy', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'war', 'movies', 'Italian', 'campaign', 'would', 'say', 'scene', 'best', 'example', 'Italian', 'combat', 'ever', 'made', 'Many', 'historians', 'credit', 'Algerian', 'Moroccan', 'division', 'breaking', 'Gustav', 'line', '1944', 'feat', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'accomplished', 'up', 'till', 'point', 'story', 'then', 'men', 'contribution', 'liberation', 'Southern', 'France', 'Many', 'get', 'see', 'country', 'risk', 'lives', 'only', 'brief', 'time']",Days of Glory: Indigenes

The film is very politically charged in France, where its title is simply ""Indigenes"", meaning ""natives"". It inspired President Jacques Chirac to finally address the pension inequities. Bouchareb doesn't hide his agenda or his bias: The North African soldiers in the film joined the French army mostly for money, occasionally for opportunity. They fought valiantly and loyally to free France from German occupation. They were stifled by discrimination and quotas during the war and discarded afterward. The specific events and characters in the film are fictional, though some French towns were, indeed, liberated by regiments of mostly North African soldiers.In 1943, France's African Army recruits soldiers from Algeria, among them a young shepherd named Said (Jamel Debbouze), and from ""goumiers"" in Morocco, including Yassir (Samy Naceri), who hopes to make enough money for his brother to marry well.  In 1944, the 7th Algerian Infantry Regiment, under the command of French ""pieds-noir"" Sergeant Martinez (Bernard Blancan) and Arab Corporal Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), win France's first victory against the German army in Italy. They arrive in Marseilles to much fanfare, where their marksman Messaoud (Roschdy Zem) begins a relationship with a French woman (Aurelie Bouab). Abdelkader is increasingly frustrated with the lack of promotion and ""liberte, egalite, and fraternite"" for African soldiers, inspiring a minor civil rights movement. But the war goes on, and the Regiment will be the first French in Alsace, as they attempt to hold the Germans off until the Americans arrive.""Days of Glory"" won't pack the political punch for Americans that it does for French, but this is a terrific war movie. It tells a World War II story that we haven't seen before, and it features two of the most compelling battle scenes I've ever seen: Flushing the Germans out in mountainous Italy elucidates the fear of the soldiers in their first battle and the utter randomness of who lives or dies. The defense of the Alsacian town is in some ways the opposite, as we know the soldiers well by this time and hope they will survive. The four North African leads represent diverse types: Unsophisticated Said's boyish devotion to his Sergeant, mature Messaoud who is not savvy enough to see the hypocrisy around him, mercenary Yassir whose dedication to his comrades grows, and idealistic Abdelkader who hopes their service to France will advance the position of North Africans. Viewers inevitably sympathize with those most like themselves, but those characters involve us emotionally in the events.

It is first and foremost a distinctly French movie with its prime goal being to make modern Frenchmen feel guilty about not treating colonial Muslim troops better during WWII.  Sure, that's an issue to be addressed, but then again, minority troops in every army of WWII were treated as second class soldiers regardless of whom they were fighting for.  That's the way it always has been and always will be.The movie itself is okay, not great, but worth having if you can get it discounted because the uniforms and equipment used in the flick is top notch.  They use a mixture of correct Lebel rifles, Enfield P14s, and even a few M1 Garands, and mix cast-off American, French, and British uniforms and equipment which is precisely what the 3rd Algerian Division wore and used.  I was greatly bummed at the beginning of the flick when they were using modern military trucks and a Vietnam era M151 Jeep for vehicles, but those vanished when they changed filming locations later.There are only two battle scenes in this movie, both of which are extremely weak when compared to Private Ryan, Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo, Enemy at the Gates, etc.  The 3rd Algerian only participated in a couple of relatively minor battles, one in Italy and in the recapture of Alsace in 1944, and in neither case did the Algerian troops perform well.  This is somewhat illustrated in the Alsace version of their fight, but only because they are seemingly overwhelmed.  That was not the historical case, they simply were poorly trained, and being under French command, their natural instincts were to surrender or retreat anyway!It's a decent movie, but it has a lot more social commentary in it than war movie, and it's kinda' dopey in spots because of the French film making.  Some of it's just kinda' dumb, like when the screen says they're in the Ruhr Valley and they're filmed hiking through ominous looking mountains!  Well, duh.And WHEN is someone going to make a movie about the hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen who VOLUNTEERED to serve in the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS during WWII?  These men far outnumbered the often touted French Resistance, yet the story of the Charlemagne Division of the Third Reich and the other French troops who wore the German helmet is brushed under the rug today.  Let's see an epic about that!  I'm not holding my breath though...Add it to your military video collection, just don't look for this one to be anything near Private Ryan, Stalingrad, or any of the true epics out there.  For my money, ""Saints and Soldiers"" is still the best unsung movie about WWII that never got the praise or rewards it deserved, and it was done on a budget of under $1 million!",3,A French movie to make the French feel guilty about their treatment of muslims.,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2742,"['NOT', 'sweeping', 'war', 'epic', 'miles', 'miles', 'first', 'foremost', 'distinctly', 'French', 'movie', 'prime', 'goal', 'being', 'make', 'modern', 'Frenchmen', 'feel', 'guilty', 'not', 'treating', 'colonial', 'Muslim', 'troops', 'better', 'WWII', 'Sure', 'issue', 'be', 'addressed', 'then', 'again', 'minority', 'troops', 'army', 'WWII', 'were', 'treated', 'second', 'class', 'soldiers', 'regardless', 'whom', 'were', 'fighting', 'way', 'always', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be.The', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'having', 'can', 'get', 'discounted', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'used', 'flick', 'top', 'notch', 'use', 'mixture', 'correct', 'Lebel', 'rifles', 'Enfield', 'P14s', 'even', 'few', 'M1', 'Garands', 'mix', 'cast-off', 'American', 'French', 'British', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'precisely', 'what', '3rd', 'Algerian', 'Division', 'wore', 'used', 'was', 'greatly', 'bummed', 'beginning', 'flick', 'when', 'were', 'using', 'modern', 'military', 'trucks', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'M151', 'Jeep', 'vehicles', 'vanished', 'when', 'changed', 'filming', 'locations', 'later.There', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'extremely', 'weak', 'when', 'compared', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'etc', '3rd', 'Algerian', 'only', 'participated', 'couple', 'relatively', 'minor', 'battles', 'one', 'Italy', 'recapture', 'Alsace', '1944', 'case', 'did', 'Algerian', 'perform', 'well', 'somewhat', 'illustrated', 'Alsace', 'version', 'fight', 'only', 'are', 'seemingly', 'overwhelmed', 'was', 'not', 'historical', 'case', 'simply', 'were', 'poorly', 'trained', 'being', 'French', 'command', 'natural', 'instincts', 'were', 'surrender', 'retreat', 'anyway', 'decent', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'social', 'commentary', 'war', 'movie', 'kinda', 'dopey', 'spots', 'French', 'film', 'making', 'just', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'when', 'screen', ""'re"", 'Ruhr', 'Valley', ""'re"", 'filmed', 'hiking', 'ominous', 'looking', 'mountains', 'Well', 'duh.And', 'WHEN', 'someone', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Frenchmen', 'who', 'VOLUNTEERED', 'serve', 'Wehrmacht', 'Waffen', 'SS', 'WWII', 'men', 'far', 'outnumbered', 'often', 'touted', 'French', 'Resistance', 'yet', 'story', 'Charlemagne', 'Division', 'Third', 'Reich', 'other', 'French', 'troops', 'who', 'wore', 'German', 'helmet', 'brushed', 'rug', 'today', 'Let', 'see', 'epic', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'Add', 'military', 'video', 'collection', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'one', 'be', 'anything', 'near', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Stalingrad', 'true', 'epics', 'there', 'money', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'still', 'best', 'unsung', 'movie', 'WWII', 'never', 'got', 'praise', 'rewards', 'deserved', 'was', 'done', 'budget', '1', 'million']",Days of Glory: Indigenes

I understood that I was going to discover a hidden secret from the liner notes and I guess I did.  The movie focusses on the French Army's recruitment of volunteers from their African territories during WWII and the service that those recruits experienced.  The movie's point was that the African soldiers experienced a lot more that they had expected because of France's discrimination of them.  There was little or no promotional potential for them and we view numerous scenes where things are available to the French soldiers but not the African soldiers.  The reactions that we witness are a compelling part of the film.  Another compelling part of the film were the combat sequences; especially the final battle we watch.  Actually, the FINAL battle is the culmination of the discrimination we've already watched.  There is a closing account of modern-day issues concerning French war veterans who came from countries that later broke away from the French ""Empire"".  After what we had seen, this information was pretty unsettling.I could only recall three other WWII films that had French African soldiers in the cast and they were all briefly depicted.  I'm giving credit to ""Casablanca"" but I don't have any strong images of the local soldiers.  In another Bogart movie, ""Sahara"" there was a soldier from (I think) Cameroon who was a part of the ragtag crew associated with Bogart's tank.  However, it was ""Two Women"" (with Sophia Loren) that left a lasting impression on me.  It was, to me, an odd scene in which a jeep full of Algerian soldiers came across the title characters.  Things happen in war but I was bothered somewhat that the realization that there were Algerian French soldiers in WWII was immediately followed their evil act and quick disappearance.  I couldn't help but notice in ""Days of Glory"" that the soldier's orientation included the admonition to ""stay away from the women"".

1061048,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B000NVT0RU,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[4, 5]","I like war movies, i glanced at the box in the video store, quickly misinterpreted what it was about and rented it.From this fortunate mistake came an interesting and worthwhile experience. For i knew nothing about the colonial French army in WW2 and this is an excellently done movie, that not only informs but motivates and interests me in the topic as well.Usually movies with an deeply felt political or social point, loose the film making quality, sacrificing it for the bigger emotional point that the authors wish to get across. It is rare for a movie to have good historical knowledge-it's often twisted to fix predispositions, good film making technic-character development, coherent plot, and good filming, and a deep political point or as this movie does tackle currently hot button topics. ""Z"" and ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""Hell in a Very Small Place"" are the only other movies quite like this one that i can remember, combining war with political and social commentary and not loosing sight of the need to present the film technically well.The big point is explained in the ""making of days of glory"", the usual dvd additional features, for once worth watching and much better than the usual shovelware. That is for those French citizens today of North African (or Sengalese) descent to relearn the sacrifices their grandfathers and great-grand fathers made in liberating France from the Nazis. As a second point, for those French citizens of European descent to be more aware and thankful for the few remaining ex-colonials soldiers in their midst before they die, and to acknowledge that those people in their lives from Africa have long ago paid in blood for their right to be there and to be genuine Frenchmen.The movie is about racism, judging a person by the color of their skin or the culture of their parents without making any attempt to hear their stories, to see what they have done, where they have come from or what they believe. The movie in a rather nice but complex way shows several ways that racism twists and distorts human relationships. It is also good to see the arena as something other than the US, for racism is not just an American problem but a human one.The scene with the tomatoes. Only white French troops are given them, the North Africans and Sengalese are not. But as the movie points out, bullets don't discriminate, they indiscriminately kill anyone wearing a French uniform. The scene with the ballet dancers, culture is deeply embedded in us all and we can only see it oftentimes when it grinds into another one and the differences are made obvious to us. When the main character mounts the box and tells the soldiers that both France and the colonials must change, there is a veiled reference to the post-WW2 colonial wars of independence that make the issues of the movie so complex and difficult to understand. When you see the violence with which the sargent responses to the knowledge that he is a son of a Berber women, you can (as all good movies do) feel both his shame and the surprise of the other man at his comment being so hated when it was offered in deep and understanding sympathy. And that is the great value of learning with movies, the visceral, the emotional impact of images and a story told with them. Now i can, and probably will, look into the issue with more reading, but this is an excellent place to learn something about a neglected and important time in recent history.Pieces of the movie are very attractively done, the uniforms-baggy North African turbans and robes with sandals, in the French winter (how can anyone live in this cold?, a point echoed in me). The fear, the brotherhood of warriors, the French white women plus the Berber soldier and the way society seems to conspire to destroy their relationship, the way some of them steal from the dead. The movie is full of unique and moving pieces that will make it a movie worth owning and watching again, there is too much going on, too many new connections for the viewer to make to be satisfied with a single pass through it.I think that this movie is a genuine contribution to the ongoing dialogue between not just the European colonial powers and their African colonies, but between Islam and Christianity, racism and cultural conflicts. I need only remember that Augustine was called names because he was small and dark, for Monica was a Berber, to remember that Christianity is not European, not in origin nor in extent. I can hate and fear Islam as the greatest competitor of my faith, but that does not mean that every Muslim is my personal enemy, nor does it mean that i can't respect and honor them for their good deeds.it is a worthwhile experience, not only for the excitement and passion but for an analysis of the deeper and more important issues that it tries to teach and push us into. thanks to all involved

1061049,A85HILHYL3V5E,B000NVT0RU,"Robert A., Shoaf","[5, 7]","As a military history buff, I must first say that I am pleased that a film was made at all about this subject, which is little known by most people,especially Americans.  World War II was the swan song of the old ""Armee D'Afrique"", the French colonial army that was similiar in many ways to the British Indian Army of the Raj. Since the vast bulk of metropolitan Frenchmen were under German occupation, or in German POW camps as a result of the defeat in 1940, the bulk of any French Army had to consist of the North African Regiments, from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, along with Senegalese and other colonial troops.Anyone who has read the book ""France, Soldiers, and Africa"" will not be surprised by the events depicted in this movie; the treatment of the ""native"" troops was often shameful and ungrateful, despite their sacrifices on the battlefield, for a country that most had never seen.The acting I believe was generally good, but the characters were not as fleshed out as I would like; perhaps as result of the number of major characters portrayed. The first set piece battle scene had large numbers, but was weakly drawn, and not that coherent; the final action scenes were better, in my opinion. Uniforms and equipment seemed to be reasonably authentic, but a mention of the U.S. 37th Division was incorrect; the 36th Division would have been correct, but I nit-pick.Could the film have been improved upon? Yes, but the fact that was done at all, and reasonably well, made it well worth my time.",4,"Flawed, but  very good overall",1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1508,"['military', 'history', 'buff', 'must', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'pleased', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'subject', 'little', 'known', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'Americans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'swan', 'song', 'old', 'Armee', ""D'Afrique"", 'French', 'colonial', 'army', 'was', 'similiar', 'many', 'ways', 'British', 'Indian', 'Army', 'Raj', 'vast', 'bulk', 'metropolitan', 'Frenchmen', 'were', 'German', 'occupation', 'German', 'POW', 'camps', 'result', 'defeat', '1940', 'bulk', 'French', 'Army', 'had', 'consist', 'North', 'African', 'Regiments', 'Algeria', 'Morocco', 'Tunisia', 'Senegalese', 'other', 'colonial', 'troops.Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'France', 'Soldiers', 'Africa', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'events', 'depicted', 'movie', 'treatment', 'native', 'troops', 'was', 'often', 'shameful', 'ungrateful', 'sacrifices', 'battlefield', 'country', 'most', 'had', 'never', 'seen.The', 'acting', 'believe', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'fleshed', 'would', 'like', 'perhaps', 'result', 'number', 'major', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'first', 'set', 'piece', 'battle', 'scene', 'had', 'large', 'numbers', 'was', 'weakly', 'drawn', 'not', 'coherent', 'final', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'better', 'opinion', 'Uniforms', 'equipment', 'seemed', 'be', 'reasonably', 'authentic', 'mention', 'U.S.', '37th', 'Division', 'was', 'incorrect', '36th', 'Division', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'correct', 'nit-pick.Could', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'Yes', 'fact', 'was', 'done', 'reasonably', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'time']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
1061050,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B000NVT0RU,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[1, 5]","This is your standard war movie with a PC message.  We have seen it all before, but it is well done none the less.  I don't know how much sympathy Western viewers are going to have for Moslim soldiers, especially in France where they have had so much trouble with moslim immigrants in recent years.  One must also recall that many Arabic states during and after WW2 were pro-Fascist in nature.  Fascism appealed to Islamic nationalists of the time.  So these French Colonial soldiers were certainly not fighting for the greater good of mankind.The disgraceful defeat of France in 1940 resulted in a political split and partial occupation by the Nazi's.  Vichy France became a pro-Nazi puppet government, while de Gualle struggled to put together the Free French Movement.  Both factions fought it out in the French colonial empire and that is where these colonial troops come in.  With a shortage of trained soldiers the Free French sought to mobilize the colonial assets of their empire.  This is why the soldiers shown in the film have such a mixture of equipment and training.  French, British and American helmits are shown along with a mix of weapons.  This is because the Free French had to scrape together whatever gear was left over from the allies.  The French military reputation being nil, neither the British or Amercians were too keen to give them the best stuff.These colonial troops, while brave would not have fared well against the Wehrmacht in its prime, as indeed they did not with the defeat of France in 1940.  By 1943 onwards they are able to ride with the crest of the wave so to speak, but otherwise would not have been any creditable match for German infantry.I liked the film and the quality of its production.  The political message was strong however.  Innocent, good colonials wanting to do good for their French masters are instead treated like dirt.  We have seen this take before and it begins to wear a bit, but the play for sympathy still manages to work here.  The final firefight seems a direct inspiration taken from SAVING PVT. RYAN.  Are we going to see every beleagered allied squad in WW2 movies fight a mini-Alamo now? I hope not, because if anything the Germans should be the ones doing this against hordes of allies. I liked the film despite these drawbacks and its rather PC message.The special features had an interesting behind the scenes view of making the film, with interviews from the principal actors.  The rather crude cartoon seemed very basic in its message.  Did such a massacre occur of French Senegalese veterans in Africa after the war?  I always wonder at the heavy handed nature of messages like this where facts often get twisted to make a message for today.",4,"A Bit Cliche, But  Good Overall",1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,2720,"['standard', 'war', 'movie', 'PC', 'message', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'less', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Western', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'Moslim', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'France', 'where', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'moslim', 'immigrants', 'recent', 'years', 'One', 'must', 'also', 'recall', 'many', 'Arabic', 'states', 'WW2', 'were', 'pro-Fascist', 'nature', 'Fascism', 'appealed', 'Islamic', 'nationalists', 'time', 'French', 'Colonial', 'soldiers', 'were', 'certainly', 'not', 'fighting', 'greater', 'good', 'mankind.The', 'disgraceful', 'defeat', 'France', '1940', 'resulted', 'political', 'split', 'partial', 'occupation', 'Nazi', 'Vichy', 'France', 'became', 'pro-Nazi', 'puppet', 'government', 'de', 'Gualle', 'struggled', 'put', 'together', 'Free', 'French', 'Movement', 'Both', 'factions', 'fought', 'out', 'French', 'colonial', 'empire', 'where', 'colonial', 'troops', 'come', 'shortage', 'trained', 'soldiers', 'Free', 'French', 'sought', 'mobilize', 'colonial', 'assets', 'empire', 'why', 'soldiers', 'shown', 'film', 'have', 'mixture', 'equipment', 'training', 'French', 'British', 'American', 'helmits', 'are', 'shown', 'mix', 'weapons', 'Free', 'French', 'had', 'scrape', 'together', 'gear', 'was', 'left', 'over', 'allies', 'French', 'military', 'reputation', 'being', 'nil', 'British', 'Amercians', 'were', 'too', 'keen', 'give', 'best', 'stuff.These', 'colonial', 'troops', 'brave', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'fared', 'well', 'Wehrmacht', 'prime', 'indeed', 'did', 'not', 'defeat', 'France', '1940', '1943', 'onwards', 'are', 'able', 'ride', 'crest', 'wave', 'so', 'speak', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'creditable', 'match', 'German', 'infantry.I', 'liked', 'film', 'quality', 'production', 'political', 'message', 'was', 'strong', 'however', 'Innocent', 'good', 'colonials', 'wanting', 'do', 'good', 'French', 'masters', 'are', 'instead', 'treated', 'dirt', 'have', 'seen', 'take', 'wear', 'bit', 'play', 'sympathy', 'still', 'work', 'here', 'final', 'firefight', 'direct', 'inspiration', 'taken', 'SAVING', 'PVT', 'RYAN', 'Are', 'going', 'see', 'beleagered', 'allied', 'squad', 'WW2', 'movies', 'fight', 'mini-Alamo', 'now', 'hope', 'not', 'anything', 'Germans', 'should', 'be', 'ones', 'doing', 'hordes', 'allies', 'liked', 'film', 'drawbacks', 'rather', 'PC', 'message.The', 'special', 'features', 'had', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'view', 'making', 'film', 'interviews', 'principal', 'actors', 'rather', 'crude', 'cartoon', 'seemed', 'very', 'basic', 'message', 'Did', 'massacre', 'occur', 'French', 'Senegalese', 'veterans', 'Africa', 'war', 'always', 'wonder', 'heavy', 'handed', 'nature', 'messages', 'where', 'facts', 'often', 'get', 'twisted', 'make', 'message', 'today']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
1061051,A8ZZW9PL112AI,B000NVT0RU,S. Craig,"[3, 7]","I would not call this movie an epic, not by a long shot.  It is good, yes, the acting in fact is very good - but it is no ""Saving Private Ryan"".Much of the fighting is small scale, still good, but not to the beach assault scenes that we have come to expect of great WW2 movie epics.  The story to be told, is certainly political, and while it is difficult to get emotionally attached or close to any of the characters in the movie you find yourself angered at the manipulation and lies that are used by the French Officers to coerce and cajole the Algerians to blindly continue the fight for their beloved France.My only criticism of the movie would be that I found it extremely distracting that one of the main characters, Sai`d (actor Jamal Debbouze) went through the entire war with his right hand stuck in his jacket pocket and I kept wondering why?  I later found out that Debbouze, lost the use of his right arm in a childhood accident.  But surely, in a war movie such as this you would be able to find ample opportunity to write into the script a reason that would adequately cover such a wound - other than just having the arm super-glued into an army jacket pocket???  I mean to take nothing away from Debbouze's skill as an actor, because I thought he did a great job in the part as Sai`d in this movie, I just think it a shame that rather than allowing me to focus on the character he portrayed so well, my attention was constantly drawn to his damn right hand in that damn pocket!!",3,Not an Epic - but still a good movie,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,1494,"['would', 'not', 'call', 'movie', 'epic', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'good', 'yes', 'acting', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '.Much', 'fighting', 'small', 'scale', 'still', 'good', 'not', 'beach', 'assault', 'scenes', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'great', 'WW2', 'movie', 'epics', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'certainly', 'political', 'difficult', 'get', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'close', 'characters', 'movie', 'find', 'angered', 'manipulation', 'are', 'used', 'French', 'Officers', 'coerce', 'cajole', 'Algerians', 'blindly', 'continue', 'fight', 'beloved', 'France.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'extremely', 'distracting', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Sai', 'd', 'actor', 'Jamal', 'Debbouze', 'went', 'entire', 'war', 'right', 'hand', 'stuck', 'jacket', 'pocket', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'Debbouze', 'lost', 'use', 'right', 'arm', 'childhood', 'accident', 'surely', 'war', 'movie', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'write', 'script', 'reason', 'would', 'adequately', 'cover', 'such', 'wound', 'other', 'just', 'having', 'arm', 'super-glued', 'army', 'jacket', 'pocket', 'mean', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'Debbouze', 'skill', 'actor', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'part', 'Sai', 'd', 'movie', 'just', 'think', 'shame', 'rather', 'allowing', 'focus', 'character', 'portrayed', 'so', 'well', 'attention', 'was', 'constantly', 'drawn', 'damn', 'right', 'hand', 'damn', 'pocket']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
1061052,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B000NVT0RU,Todd Bartholomew,"[1, 1]","When you think of France's Liberation from the Germans one tends to think of the combined efforts of the Americans, British, Canadians, and the Free French, yet there's a largely untold story of these Free French as many if not most came from France's overseas departments.  ""Indigenes"" (French for indigenous) is an appropriate title as it seeks to address this historical oversight and does so in a manner free of the hamfistedness you might expect.  ""Indigenes"" opens in Algeria with a local leader urging men to volunteer to fight to free France.  It is a scene rich with irony as those colonized came to liberate the colonizer.  At the time Algeria was not considered an overseas department but an integral part of France, yet there were considerable tensions between the French who had settled there and the indigenous population.  The film focuses on several men who volunteer from one village with most fitting a somewhat clich&eacute;d stereotype of sorts: the noble wise leader, the mercenary, and so on, yet the film itself is not clich&eacute;d.""Indigenes"" follows the men through the Italian campaign of 1943/1944 and we get a sense that the Algerians are viewed as expendable cannon fodder - sent on the riskiest missions and attired in an assortment of French, British, and American castoff uniforms and equipment while the other armies are more uniformly attired.  This is historically accurate and emphasizes the Algerian's relegation to second-class status while fighting for France.  While the men question the injustice around them and seek its redress they are told to bide their time.  As they enter France the ambiguity of their position is thrown into high relief; the French they encounter are thrilled to be liberated but shocked to find it is by Algerians and not their fellow Frenchmen.  In the climatic scene towards the end the bravery the men exhibit in the face of battle and the social divide between them and the French they are liberating is perhaps as good as it gets in film.  I hated that the movie was re-titled as ""Days of Glory"" for the American market as it tended to de-emphasize the alienation and foolishly re-brand it as a war movie as that likely turned off viewers who may have otherwise wanted to have seen it.  As a Francophone I can tell you the translation for the subtitles is quite good compared to the usually mangling you can get.Director Rachid Bouchareb's intention was to shame the French government into honoring pensions it was supposed to pay Algerian veterans of the war, yet who were cut off when France suspended payments at the start of the Algerian War in 1959.  Apparently the trick worked as France did finally resume paying pensions.  That's testament not only to the power of this film, but to the perseverance of those thousands of men from throughout the French empire who answered the call to liberate France.  ""Indigenes"" is a story that needs to be told as the belief that it was Gen. Charles de Gaulle and an all French force that liberated France with the Allies isn't the whole truth.  The truth is that liberation was fought in a large part by people from throughout the empire and their sacrifice merits far greater recognition.",5,An untold story of France's Liberation,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,3209,"['When', 'think', 'France', 'Liberation', 'Germans', 'one', 'think', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Americans', 'British', 'Canadians', 'Free', 'French', 'yet', 'largely', 'untold', 'story', 'Free', 'French', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'came', 'France', 'overseas', 'departments', 'Indigenes', 'French', 'indigenous', 'appropriate', 'title', 'address', 'historical', 'oversight', 'so', 'manner', 'free', 'hamfistedness', 'might', 'expect', 'Indigenes', 'Algeria', 'local', 'leader', 'urging', 'men', 'volunteer', 'fight', 'free', 'France', 'scene', 'rich', 'irony', 'colonized', 'came', 'liberate', 'colonizer', 'time', 'Algeria', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'overseas', 'department', 'integral', 'part', 'France', 'yet', 'were', 'considerable', 'tensions', 'French', 'who', 'had', 'settled', 'there', 'indigenous', 'population', 'film', 'several', 'men', 'who', 'volunteer', 'one', 'village', 'most', 'fitting', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotype', 'sorts', 'noble', 'wise', 'leader', 'mercenary', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'Indigenes', 'men', 'Italian', 'campaign', '1943/1944', 'get', 'sense', 'Algerians', 'are', 'viewed', 'expendable', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'sent', 'riskiest', 'missions', 'attired', 'assortment', 'French', 'British', 'American', 'castoff', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'other', 'armies', 'are', 'more', 'uniformly', 'attired', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Algerian', 'relegation', 'second-class', 'status', 'fighting', 'France', 'men', 'question', 'injustice', 'seek', 'redress', 'are', 'told', 'bide', 'time', 'enter', 'France', 'ambiguity', 'position', 'thrown', 'high', 'relief', 'French', 'encounter', 'are', 'thrilled', 'be', 'liberated', 'shocked', 'find', 'Algerians', 'not', 'fellow', 'Frenchmen', 'climatic', 'scene', 'end', 'bravery', 'men', 'exhibit', 'face', 'battle', 'social', 'divide', 'French', 'are', 'liberating', 'perhaps', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'hated', 'movie', 'was', 're-titled', 'Days', 'Glory', 'American', 'market', 'tended', 'de-emphasize', 'alienation', 'foolishly', 're-brand', 'war', 'movie', 'likely', 'turned', 'off', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'otherwise', 'wanted', 'have', 'seen', 'Francophone', 'can', 'tell', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'quite', 'good', 'compared', 'usually', 'mangling', 'can', 'get.Director', 'Rachid', 'Bouchareb', 'intention', 'was', 'shame', 'French', 'government', 'honoring', 'pensions', 'was', 'supposed', 'pay', 'Algerian', 'veterans', 'war', 'who', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'when', 'France', 'suspended', 'payments', 'start', 'Algerian', 'War', '1959', 'Apparently', 'trick', 'worked', 'France', 'did', 'finally', 'resume', 'paying', 'pensions', 'testament', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'film', 'perseverance', 'thousands', 'men', 'French', 'empire', 'who', 'answered', 'call', 'liberate', 'France', 'Indigenes', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'belief', 'was', 'Gen.', 'Charles', 'de', 'Gaulle', 'French', 'force', 'liberated', 'France', 'Allies', ""n't"", 'whole', 'truth', 'truth', 'liberation', 'was', 'fought', 'large', 'part', 'people', 'empire', 'sacrifice', 'merits', 'far', 'greater', 'recognition']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
1061053,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000NVT0RU,Turfseer,"[4, 4]","Worthy memorial to forgotten North African soldiers of WW II*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Days of Glory' is similar to Spike Lee's 'Miracle at St. Anna' as both films deal with the subject of a minority group's contribution to the war effort in World War II. In Lee's film, the focus is on African-Americans and in 'Days of Glory', Arabic-speaking North Africans. The value of both films are that they chronicle the little-known history of discrimination against these minority group soldiers despite all their sacrifices made during wartime.Toward the beginning of the film, the North African soldiers win a small victory when a Captain rescinds the decision not to serve them tomatoes as part of the their daily rations on a transport ship. But more egregious examples of discrimination which are not reversed are shown such as allowing native 'white' Frenchmen leave while the North Africans get none. Similarly, the whites are always promoted to a higher rank and the Africans always remain in the same subordinate positions. Further resentment is bred when the news media sends pictures and newsreels back home of the white soldiers, giving the false impression that they were the ones doing most of the fighting when in actuality it was the North Africans who were responsible for the bulk of the hand-to-hand combat. The ultimate indignity is referenced at the end of the picture when we learn that all pensions of the North African soldiers were frozen following independence of the French colonies. It's my understanding that this injustice has not been redressed, even to this day.'Glory' focuses on four soldiers at the beginning of their conscription in North Africa, their initial foray into Italy in 1944 and finally, combat operations against the Germans in France proper. We meet Said, an impoverished Algerian goat farmer who signs up despite the protestations of his mother who fears she'll lose him in combat. The actor who plays Said, Jamel Debbouze, actually has one arm in real life, and must keep the missing appendage in his pocket throughout the film in order to maintain the illusion that he's not handicapped. It turns out that Debbouze is actually one of the film's producers who contributed a bit of money to the film's production, so it appears they could not avoid using him.The trick in a movie like this is to avoid hagiography by showing each soldier with an inner life and enough conflict between them to keep things interesting. Perhaps the least successful is the character of Messaoud who falls in love with a French woman and is thwarted by the military censors when the letters he sends to her are never received. The other thing we learn about Messaoud is that he joins the majority of the other soldiers in the unit, taunting Said after Staff Sergeant Martinez makes him his orderly. Said puts a knife to Messaoud's throat as he can no longer endure the taunts which imply that he's Martinez's 'girl'. Messaoud eventually goes AWOL due to the aforementioned discriminatory leave policy in an attempt to see his French lover. He's restored after the brass realize they cannot dispense with his skills as a marksman.Corporal Abdelkader proves to be the film's protagonist. He becomes a corporal after taking an exam (equivalent to a lieutenant in the US Army) and becomes the voice for the rights of the native African minority soldiers. Abdelkader faces Sgt. Martinez down on the ship, winning the right to have the tomatoes served to the men. Later, he's put in the brig after getting into a fight with Martinez over the Army leave policy (instead of the soldiers getting leave, they're forced to watch a French ballet performance inside a tent). Despite Abdelkader's militancy, he's also loyal to France and proves to be courageous in battle. So it's quite sad to see how he's not recognized at war's end and ends up a defeated, lonely man living in a small flat in France, far from his homeland.There's also Yassir, a Moroccan of Berber extraction (one of the Moroccan 'Gourmier' soldiers) who joins in the soldering for the money. There's a good scene where another soldier prevents him from bashing in the mouth of a dead German soldier and extracting his gold fillings. Later, Yassir is devastated when his brother is killed in combat.Perhaps the best character in the film is Sgt. Martinez, the 'Pied Noir' (a French national whose ancestors probably were of Spanish extraction who had settled in Algeria). Martinez considers himself thoroughly French and does not want to be associated with the Arab culture. When Said discovers a picture of his Arabic mother and asks him about it, Martinez beats him up and warns him not to tell anyone upon pain of death. Martinez gives 'Days of Glory' its flavor as he is almost brutal in the way he treats his troops but at the same time, sticks up for them when dealing with the higher-ups.'Days of Glory' emulates many American pictures in its war scenes. There are some gripping battle scenes and the carnage and horror of war is ably depicted (one unforgettable iconic image shows the soldiers eating a meal with a dead horse in a ditch right in front of them). The battle scene at the end of the picture however, where the unit faces off against a much larger group of Germans in a small town, doesn't really ring true. The Germans march into town, taking no cover, and are picked off too easily by the North Africans.'Days of Glory' is a worthy addition to the pantheon of World War II films. The characters are not all fleshed out but we do learn a great deal of the history of the discrimination endured by these heroic soldiers. Unlike the bloated 'Miracle of St. Anna', 'Glory' feature economical editing coupled with a soundtrack highlighted by some haunting Middle Eastern songs.",3,Worthy memorial to forgotten North African

1061055,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000NVT0RU,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[69, 70]","What is there to say about a film as moving, triumphant, and expertly executed on all accounts as ""Days of Glory""? Its praises have been sung by most reviewers, even earning an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. ""Days of Glory"" is an Americanized title, but one that still manages to capture the essence of the film. The original Algerian title is Indigenes, a word used to describe the hundreds of thousands of indigenous soldiers from colonial Africa who fought for France in World War II. Clearly ""Indigenous Soldiers"" isn't as powerful a title.Although ""Days of Glory"" is a sweeping war picture that has been aptly compared to other war dramas like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Glory"", at heart it is still a character study, focusing on four Muslim soldiers as they maneuver through the rough terrain on the war field, and the somewhat rougher terrain of racial inequality and injustice in their own camp. Prepared to battle for what they call the ""motherland"", the North African soldiers who signed up find themselves unsure of how to react to the rampant racism demonstrated by their sergeants.Each character may be a well-known archetype of war movies (the headstrong leader, the humble and uneducated soldier, the mercenary, the lover) but each actor has the skill and the desire to flesh these characters out into completely realistic and believable people. The acting is intense and honest and watching these men throughout their mission is all the more moving as we are able to see real emotions, desires, and fears. These actors have completely invested themselves into the film, and into their characters, earning a special male ensemble award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.In the ""making of"" documentary included on the DVD, lead actor (and producer) Jamel Debbouze tells of how director Rachid Bouchareb approached his four main actors not only with the script, but also with the paperwork showing that each of their grandfathers had actually been involved in the war. This may shed some light on the dedication these men showed in telling this important story. A story so important that it led to French President Jacques Chirac restoring the pensions of the empire veterans (whose pensions we learn in the film were frozen in 1959). In the film's touching final moments, as one of the leads walks the streets in anonymity, we begin to fully understand the completely unrewarded sacrifice these men have made for a country that chose not to reward them... until almost 50 years later.Bouchareb has finally brought his dream project to life. After trying to get it produced for over a decade, it is abundantly clear that the final product justifies the wait and the effort on so many levels. ""Days of Glory"" is the kind of film that inspires people to accomplish more and to look for the greatness in others.",5,A sweeping war picture,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,2849,"['What', 'there', 'say', 'film', 'moving', 'triumphant', 'expertly', 'executed', 'accounts', 'Days', 'Glory', 'praises', 'have', 'been', 'sung', 'most', 'reviewers', 'even', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'foreign-language', 'film', 'Days', 'Glory', 'Americanized', 'title', 'one', 'still', 'capture', 'essence', 'film', 'original', 'Algerian', 'title', 'Indigenes', 'word', 'used', 'describe', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'indigenous', 'soldiers', 'colonial', 'Africa', 'who', 'fought', 'France', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Clearly', 'Indigenous', 'Soldiers', ""n't"", 'as', 'powerful', 'title.Although', 'Days', 'Glory', 'sweeping', 'war', 'picture', 'been', 'aptly', 'compared', 'other', 'war', 'dramas', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Glory', 'heart', 'still', 'character', 'study', 'focusing', 'four', 'Muslim', 'soldiers', 'maneuver', 'rough', 'terrain', 'war', 'field', 'somewhat', 'rougher', 'terrain', 'racial', 'inequality', 'injustice', 'own', 'camp', 'Prepared', 'battle', 'what', 'call', 'motherland', 'North', 'African', 'soldiers', 'who', 'signed', 'up', 'find', 'unsure', 'how', 'react', 'rampant', 'racism', 'demonstrated', 'sergeants.Each', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'well-known', 'archetype', 'war', 'movies', 'headstrong', 'leader', 'humble', 'uneducated', 'soldier', 'mercenary', 'lover', 'actor', 'skill', 'desire', 'flesh', 'characters', 'out', 'completely', 'realistic', 'believable', 'people', 'acting', 'intense', 'honest', 'watching', 'men', 'mission', 'more', 'moving', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'real', 'emotions', 'desires', 'fears', 'actors', 'have', 'completely', 'invested', 'film', 'characters', 'earning', 'special', 'male', 'ensemble', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival.In', 'making', 'documentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'lead', 'actor', 'producer', 'Jamel', 'Debbouze', 'tells', 'how', 'director', 'Rachid', 'Bouchareb', 'approached', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'also', 'paperwork', 'showing', 'grandfathers', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'involved', 'war', 'may', 'shed', 'light', 'dedication', 'men', 'showed', 'telling', 'important', 'story', 'A', 'story', 'so', 'important', 'led', 'French', 'President', 'Jacques', 'Chirac', 'restoring', 'pensions', 'empire', 'veterans', 'pensions', 'learn', 'film', 'were', 'frozen', '1959', 'film', 'touching', 'final', 'moments', 'one', 'leads', 'walks', 'streets', 'anonymity', 'begin', 'fully', 'understand', 'completely', 'unrewarded', 'sacrifice', 'men', 'have', 'made', 'country', 'chose', 'not', 'reward', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'later.Bouchareb', 'finally', 'brought', 'dream', 'project', 'life', 'trying', 'get', 'produced', 'decade', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'final', 'product', 'wait', 'effort', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Days', 'Glory', 'kind', 'film', 'people', 'accomplish', 'more', 'look', 'greatness', 'others']",Days of Glory: Indigenes
