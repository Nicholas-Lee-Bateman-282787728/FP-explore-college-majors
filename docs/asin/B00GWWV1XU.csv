The 2 main characters are gay men who are dealing with some of the repercussions of their past relationships, which have left each of them longing for some honest intimacy.  We see how their lives are intertwined with those of the people they love, or have loved in the past.  Each character is fully realized.  The relationships between the characters are revealed as the story progresses:  Some may find this progression to be a bit slow for their tastes, but it does seem to me to unfold at the speed of life.  The film is beautifully acted and beautifully shot.

1682552,A3JYAX8BP7W3D2,B00GWWV1XU,Drew Odom,"[21, 23]","What is rare in films, in much of art for that matter, is generosity.  Big bank-rolled American movies have abandoned it.  But a few independents have kept its impulses alive, for example Junebug and Old Joy.  Like them, Pit Stop grants its characters personal complexity, emotional nuance, and decency.  It never betrays them with irony or directorial superiority.  It does not matter if a character is a major or relatively minor figure in the unfolding of the film's action.  Everyone is treated, depicted, and revealed with equal respect and understanding.Pit Stop is a remarkably generous movie.  All of its characters, not just its leads, are carefully, attentively, subtly portrayed.  It is able to surprise you, as, for example, the moment when Gabe reveals he knows some French, Ernesto breaks down while talking to Luis on the phone, or Winston speaks to Shannon in the parking lot after their date the night before.  Characters take unexpected, but nonetheless ""realistic"" turns  against some expectations one might have made about them.  This is as true of relatively minor characters as of the more important ones.  When Martin, Ernesto's former lover is in a coma, and his sister comes to visit him, she reveals herself to Martin (and to us) not to be whom we might have expected her to be just from what she has said to Ernie on the phone.  She's not a stereotype.  Even in her brief scene, she is shown to be emotionally fraught.  She has and is allowed depth.No one in this film is a stereotype.  No one is a type of any kind.  The movie's realism, for lack of a better word, emerges not just from a keen eye-place is evoked time after time with simple but telling shots-but from its emotional attention.  It knows its characters, all its characters, and it gives them, allows them their full humanity.Its pace is therefore necessarily deliberate.  It needs to take its time to be true to what it observes.  Much of it is sad.These are in many ways lonely people in a lonely place.  What is remarkable, however, is how, at times, that loneliness is overcome, how some of its characters are offered the time to find themselves happier than they might have expected to be. This movie is not about their lives after that happiness, if it is to endure, but their ways to it.  Its aim is less to unfold a plot than to show ever more acutely who is people are.Thus it ends exactly when and as it must, with a joy that has come almost unaccountably, almost by surprise.  Because this exceptionally fine and humane movie sees its characters both fully and lovingly, when some come to discover love, or something at least close enough to it, it feels completely right, without any sentimentality to it or easy resolutions.  Pit Stop is one of the most gracious movies I have seen in a long time.  It gives its characters, it lets its characters have, the depth they are due.",5,A Humanly Generous Film,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2882,"['What', 'rare', 'films', 'much', 'art', 'matter', 'generosity', 'Big', 'bank-rolled', 'American', 'movies', 'have', 'abandoned', 'few', 'independents', 'have', 'kept', 'impulses', 'alive', 'example', 'Junebug', 'Old', 'Joy', 'Pit', 'Stop', 'characters', 'personal', 'complexity', 'emotional', 'nuance', 'decency', 'never', 'irony', 'directorial', 'superiority', 'not', 'matter', 'character', 'major', 'relatively', 'minor', 'figure', 'unfolding', 'film', 'action', 'Everyone', 'treated', 'depicted', 'revealed', 'equal', 'respect', 'understanding.Pit', 'Stop', 'remarkably', 'generous', 'movie', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'leads', 'are', 'carefully', 'attentively', 'subtly', 'portrayed', 'able', 'surprise', 'example', 'moment', 'when', 'Gabe', 'French', 'Ernesto', 'down', 'talking', 'Luis', 'phone', 'Winston', 'Shannon', 'parking', 'lot', 'date', 'night', 'Characters', 'take', 'unexpected', 'nonetheless', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'true', 'relatively', 'minor', 'characters', 'more', 'important', 'ones', 'When', 'Martin', 'Ernesto', 'former', 'lover', 'coma', 'sister', 'visit', 'Martin', 'not', 'be', 'whom', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'said', 'Ernie', 'phone', 'not', 'stereotype', 'Even', 'brief', 'scene', 'shown', 'be', 'emotionally', 'fraught', 'allowed', 'depth.No', 'one', 'film', 'stereotype', 'one', 'type', 'kind', 'movie', 'realism', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'not', 'just', 'keen', 'eye-place', 'evoked', 'time', 'time', 'simple', 'telling', 'shots-but', 'emotional', 'attention', 'characters', 'characters', 'full', 'humanity.Its', 'pace', 'therefore', 'necessarily', 'deliberate', 'take', 'time', 'be', 'true', 'what', 'Much', 'sad.These', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'lonely', 'people', 'lonely', 'place', 'What', 'remarkable', 'however', 'how', 'times', 'loneliness', 'overcome', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'offered', 'time', 'find', 'happier', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'movie', 'not', 'lives', 'happiness', 'endure', 'ways', 'aim', 'less', 'unfold', 'plot', 'show', 'ever', 'more', 'acutely', 'who', 'people', 'exactly', 'when', 'must', 'joy', 'come', 'almost', 'unaccountably', 'almost', 'surprise', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'humane', 'movie', 'characters', 'fully', 'lovingly', 'when', 'come', 'discover', 'love', 'something', 'least', 'close', 'enough', 'completely', 'right', 'sentimentality', 'easy', 'resolutions', 'Pit', 'Stop', 'one', 'most', 'gracious', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'characters', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'are', 'due']",Pit Stop
1682553,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00GWWV1XU,DVD Verdict,"[1, 2]","Pit Stop is sneaky good because of how clever co-writer David Lowery (Ain't Them Bodies Saints) and co-writer/director Yen Tan (Ciao) craft the simple but impactful story.The first thing that becomes apparent is that it has no real narrative. While it is a story by literal definition, the film is more an exercise in observation, with the subject being the aftermath of emotional tragedies. With the exception of how Ernesto manages his ex-love who is living with him, those tragedies are never shown, and that is for the better. This is a film about how these men cope with what happened to them, not what actually happened to them. It's an incredibly genuine experience.The other part I like about the story is that it's a tale of destiny but not in the usual sense. It's no secret that the men make a connection, but their path to each other never feels contrived as it isn't a same-sex version of Sleepless In Seattle. The whole point isn't how they meet, it's THAT they meet. It's as if the ending was written first and the story was built backwards form there and then played from the beginning.Also refreshing? The approach of being observational allows for the absence of the gay-specific melodrama you might find in a stereotypical tale about two gay men in a small town in Texas. Because Pit Stop treats viewers like they have brains, sexual politics or regional stereotypes are never on display they way they might be in other films. Oh, you know those things happen because you know they happen, but the film never feels the need to tell you what you already know. That's not to say the film doesn't have with gay-specific issues&#8212;it has. It's to say the story does another thing right by not doing something wrong.There are solid supporting actors and actresses throughout the film, but stars Heck and DeAnda carry it with excellent performances, led by a strong bench behind the camera.Once again, Wolfe Video proves it knows what it's doing from a technical perspective. Like sister Wolfe release Margarita, Pit Stop is a film with excellent cinematography, here courtesy of HutcH (The Romance of Loneliness). HutcH makes excellent use of low-lit situations, and at times has entire areas within a scene cast in darkness, giving it almost a stage play feel. (There's a great-looking scene very early where Gabe's 6-year-old daughter leaves a finely lit kitchen table in the foreground to put her dinner plate in the sink, and the child is nearly swallowed whole by the shadowy background.) The video transfer performs very well in these and other dark conditions in the film. The Dolby 5.1 sounds perfectly fine, with little competition between or among sounds.The extras consist of two commentary tracks. One track is with with Director Yen Tan and stars Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda. They discuss topics ranging from on-set memories to filmmaking tips and tricks. The other track is again with Tan, but accompanied this time by Producer Kelly Williams (Pictures of Superheroes), Cinematographer HutcH, and Editor Don Swaynos (The Horrible Life of Dr. Ghoul). Their conversation is a little more inside baseball and a little more technical.Michael Nazarewycz, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Simple but impactful story.,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,3230,"['Pit', 'Stop', 'sneaky', 'good', 'how', 'clever', 'co-writer', 'David', 'Lowery', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Them', 'Bodies', 'Saints', 'co-writer/director', 'Yen', 'Tan', 'Ciao', 'craft', 'simple', 'impactful', 'story.The', 'first', 'thing', 'apparent', 'real', 'narrative', 'story', 'literal', 'definition', 'film', 'more', 'exercise', 'observation', 'subject', 'being', 'aftermath', 'emotional', 'tragedies', 'exception', 'how', 'Ernesto', 'ex-love', 'who', 'living', 'tragedies', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'better', 'film', 'how', 'men', 'cope', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'incredibly', 'genuine', 'experience.The', 'other', 'part', 'like', 'story', 'tale', 'destiny', 'not', 'usual', 'sense', 'secret', 'men', 'make', 'connection', 'path', 'other', 'never', 'feels', 'contrived', ""n't"", 'same-sex', 'version', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'whole', 'point', ""n't"", 'how', 'meet', 'meet', 'ending', 'was', 'written', 'first', 'story', 'was', 'built', 'backwards', 'form', 'there', 'then', 'played', 'beginning.Also', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'being', 'observational', 'allows', 'absence', 'gay-specific', 'melodrama', 'might', 'find', 'stereotypical', 'tale', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'Pit', 'Stop', 'viewers', 'have', 'brains', 'sexual', 'politics', 'regional', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'never', 'display', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'films', 'Oh', 'know', 'things', 'happen', 'know', 'happen', 'film', 'never', 'need', 'tell', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'gay-specific', 'issues', '8212', 'say', 'story', 'thing', 'right', 'not', 'doing', 'something', 'are', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'stars', 'Heck', 'DeAnda', 'carry', 'excellent', 'performances', 'led', 'strong', 'bench', 'camera.Once', 'again', 'Wolfe', 'Video', 'what', 'doing', 'technical', 'perspective', 'sister', 'Wolfe', 'release', 'Margarita', 'Pit', 'Stop', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'here', 'courtesy', 'HutcH', 'Romance', 'Loneliness', 'HutcH', 'excellent', 'use', 'low-lit', 'situations', 'times', 'entire', 'areas', 'scene', 'cast', 'darkness', 'giving', 'almost', 'stage', 'play', 'feel', 'great-looking', 'scene', 'very', 'early', 'where', 'Gabe', '6-year-old', 'daughter', 'finely', 'lit', 'kitchen', 'table', 'foreground', 'put', 'dinner', 'plate', 'sink', 'child', 'nearly', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'shadowy', 'background', 'video', 'transfer', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'dark', 'conditions', 'film', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'little', 'competition', 'sounds.The', 'extras', 'consist', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'One', 'track', 'Director', 'Yen', 'Tan', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Heck', 'Marcus', 'DeAnda', 'discuss', 'topics', 'ranging', 'on-set', 'memories', 'filmmaking', 'tips', 'tricks', 'other', 'track', 'again', 'Tan', 'accompanied', 'time', 'Producer', 'Kelly', 'Williams', 'Pictures', 'Superheroes', 'Cinematographer', 'HutcH', 'Editor', 'Don', 'Swaynos', 'Horrible', 'Life', 'Dr.', 'Ghoul', 'conversation', 'little', 'more', 'inside', 'baseball', 'little', 'more', 'technical.Michael', 'Nazarewycz', 'DVD', 'VERDICTRead', 'full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Pit Stop

That is a rare problem for a gay film, but the characters tend to mumble their dialogue, almost trying not to be heard or else Texas will hear them and crucify them or something.

I could see guys who like straight-acting men really identifying with it - there's no room for any queens in this picture - so if you like em butch and manly and muted, this could be the film for you.

Everything about it is perfect.It doesn't need editing or any of the other fixes even favorable reviews say it needs. They're looking for a different kind of movie - in which the lovers meet early and we see all that happens afterwards - and they won't have any trouble finding it, because it's all we've gotten until now. But I THANK GOD that Yen Tan didn't hear their whining, and that he made this movie EXACTLY as he did. Not in any universe could it be any better than it is.Every character (including the ex-wife and her new boyfriend) and every scene is essential, exactly as it is. If I listed everything about Pit Stop that's perfect I'd list everything (well, maybe not the title), but I must single out the writing, direction and acting.The characters have time to develop fully and richly, each within the context of his own life, every tiny detail of which is perfect. Their brief almost-meetings (at least three times) earlier in the movie help tie their stories together even though they're deliciously subtle and easy to miss; and the pacing of the whole movie is as graceful and lovely as a ballet, but more natural. Action lovers will definitely be bored, but who cares? When the two men finally meet, it's the sweetest, hottest stuff ever shown on any kind of screen anywhere on earth.Gabe and Ernie are the realest couple ever in any gay movie, and Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda are the best actors who ever played gay characters.

If you have seen the film Nebraska you will be familiar with the background scenery of Middle America. The film seems (from the reviews) to have caught quite accurately the day to day life of the inhabitants of these non descript towns for both gays and straights. I suppose we are more familiar with straight life dramas than gay ones which have tended to be confined to LA or New York - where the camera crews and creative teams are located. They may not want to locate to Anywhere Nebraska or, as Bill Bryson would call it, Duddsville.The acting in the film is first class. Each and every character gives a first class performance. Gabe's former wife plays the over anxious divorcee out on the town particularly well. Too well for her suitor who is overwhelmed by her. In reality nothing very dramatic happens in the film. No murders. No guns. No police chases or international conspiracies. We have the story lines of two very different men running concurrently. They don't actually meet until the last few minutes of the film but its significance is only brought home to the viewer from watching their lives unfold from the beginning. Unrequited love, unfaithful partners, former partners and unsuccessful dating attempts fill the lives of both of these men as they exist in the same town totally unaware of each other.Their pasts are brought out slowly in conversations with other people. We know Gabe went to College and wasn't a builder all his working life. We get the backstory to the mysterious man in the coma in the Nursing Home and his family history. It is all done in a few lines but done really well.Don't deprive yourself of the experience. Just relax and let it just take you over. You may find you have a lot in common with the characters in the film. Thankfully these sort of low key, low budget films have not faltered on low quality.

Marcus Deanda as the out man in this small town and Bill Heck as the semi closeted and previously married with a daughter guys are terrific. They show life in a small town in Texas and what it means to be gay. The life they lead is no more difficult than anyone elses but has a couple extra challenges.

Just good story, good acting and good dialog.",4,Super nice.,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,622,"['have', 'admit', 'beginning', 'was', 'rather', 'slow', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', '80', 'minute', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'trying', 'Marcus', 'Deanda', 'out', 'man', 'small', 'town', 'Bill', 'Heck', 'semi', 'closeted', 'previously', 'married', 'daughter', 'guys', 'are', 'terrific', 'show', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'what', 'be', 'gay', 'life', 'lead', 'more', 'difficult', 'anyone', 'elses', 'couple', 'extra', 'challenges', 'did', 'shed', 'few', 'good', 'tears', 'end', 'did', 'find', 'relationship', 'Gabe', 'wife', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'went', 'overt', 'sex', 'Check', 'out', 'Just', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'dialog']",Pit Stop

Now in 2014, we have 'Pit Stop', which is also as good as these fine predecessors.'Pit Stop' focuses on two blue collar workers from Texas, Gabe and Ernesto (played by an excellent Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda, respectively). We see each of their stories for most of the film separately, and note that both are getting over failed relationships.In the case of Ernesto, his ex-boyfriend, Luis, is still living with him. He initially tells Luis he can take as much time as he wants to move out but changes his mind when the ex-boyfriend starts dating other men and keeps him up, while watching late night TV. Ernesto also visits another ex-boyfriend, who's in a coma, after being critically hurt in a car accident.Gabe's situation is different. He's still living with his wife and young daughter but no longer sleeps with her. He recently broke up with a man and now is dating again. In a notable scene, Gabe goes out on a date with a teacher--who falls asleep on their date watching a foreign film in a movie theater. Gabe drives the date home, who apologizes for not wanting to see him again, as he makes it clear that he hasn't gotten over his last relationship.There's also a sub-plot involving Gabe's wife, Shannon, who goes out with a co-worker, Winston, on a date. Shannon, desperate for physical companionship, gets drunk and puts the moves on Winston, who isn't ready to get physical on a first date. Sure it's possible that Gabe's sexual rejection of his wife would lead her to want to have sexual contact with a man she's probably not that attracted to (Gabe tells Winston at one point that Shannon isn't attracted to heavy set men). But usually, the roles are reversed: women are wary of having sex on a first date, especially when it involves a man they don't find that attractive.While the pacing of the film is fairly slow, the interactions between the characters ring true. Another excellent scene is when Luis has left and calls Ernesto on the phone, from New Mexico. Luis feels he's lost but Ernesto tries to convince him that he'll eventually get it together, if he just applies himself (like going back to school). At the same time, Ernesto makes it clear that he doesn't want Luis to return.We see the connection between Gabe and Ernesto at film's end, as they meet through online dating. They're basically instantly attracted to one another as they recognize that they have both been trying to fill a similar void, in their lives. 'Pit Stop' is a low key drama which, as I pointed out above, proceeds rather lugubriously. Nonetheless, for the patient film-goer, you will be rewarded by excellent acting, direction and characters that seem to jump off the page, of real life.",4,"Sensitively made film about gay blue collar workers getting over failed relationships, hits the mark",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2891,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Recent', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'nominees', 'have', 'cropped', 'up', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'including', 'Lights', 'Family', 'sensitively-made', 'films', 'gay', 'theme', 'Now', '2014', 'have', ""'Pit"", 'Stop', 'also', 'as', 'good', 'fine', 'predecessors', ""'Pit"", 'Stop', 'focuses', 'two', 'blue', 'collar', 'workers', 'Texas', 'Gabe', 'Ernesto', 'played', 'excellent', 'Bill', 'Heck', 'Marcus', 'DeAnda', 'respectively', 'see', 'stories', 'most', 'film', 'separately', 'note', 'are', 'getting', 'failed', 'relationships.In', 'case', 'Ernesto', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Luis', 'still', 'living', 'initially', 'Luis', 'can', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'move', 'out', 'mind', 'when', 'ex-boyfriend', 'starts', 'dating', 'other', 'men', 'up', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'Ernesto', 'also', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'coma', 'being', 'critically', 'hurt', 'car', 'accident.Gabe', 'situation', 'different', 'still', 'living', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'longer', 'sleeps', 'recently', 'broke', 'up', 'man', 'now', 'dating', 'again', 'notable', 'scene', 'Gabe', 'out', 'date', 'teacher', 'who', 'asleep', 'date', 'watching', 'foreign', 'film', 'movie', 'theater', 'Gabe', 'date', 'home', 'who', 'not', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'clear', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'over', 'last', 'relationship.There', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Gabe', 'wife', 'Shannon', 'who', 'out', 'co-worker', 'Winston', 'date', 'Shannon', 'desperate', 'physical', 'companionship', 'drunk', 'moves', 'Winston', 'who', ""n't"", 'ready', 'get', 'physical', 'first', 'date', 'Sure', 'possible', 'Gabe', 'sexual', 'rejection', 'wife', 'would', 'lead', 'want', 'have', 'sexual', 'contact', 'man', 'probably', 'not', 'that', 'attracted', 'Gabe', 'Winston', 'one', 'point', 'Shannon', ""n't"", 'attracted', 'heavy', 'set', 'men', 'usually', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed', 'women', 'are', 'wary', 'having', 'sex', 'first', 'date', 'especially', 'when', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'pacing', 'film', 'fairly', 'slow', 'interactions', 'characters', 'ring', 'true', 'excellent', 'scene', 'when', 'Luis', 'left', 'Ernesto', 'phone', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Luis', 'lost', 'Ernesto', 'convince', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'get', 'together', 'just', 'going', 'back', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'Ernesto', 'clear', ""n't"", 'want', 'Luis', 'return.We', 'see', 'connection', 'Gabe', 'Ernesto', 'film', 'end', 'meet', 'online', 'dating', ""'re"", 'basically', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'one', 'recognize', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'fill', 'similar', 'void', 'lives', ""'Pit"", 'Stop', 'low', 'key', 'drama', 'pointed', 'out', 'proceeds', 'rather', 'lugubriously', 'Nonetheless', 'patient', 'film-goer', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'excellent', 'acting', 'direction', 'characters', 'seem', 'jump', 'off', 'page', 'real', 'life']",Pit Stop
