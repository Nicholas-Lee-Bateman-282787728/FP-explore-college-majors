1652906,A3IN2WR1OYWJTT,B00D1VVT3C,"Keri Teach ""Seaviewkat""","[8, 9]","This was a deal I could not pass up - seasons 1-4 of NCIS LA for $49.99. NCIS LA is the spin off of NCIS. This show has fast gained popularity and follows NCIS on Tuesday nights on CBS. I also purchased the season 5 episodes on instant stream so I now own every episode of this show. While NCIS LA doesn't have Gibbs the LA crew is led by OPS manager Henrietta Lange or ""Hetty"" as referred to by her team, played by Oscar winning actress Linda Hunt. (She won best supporting actress for playing a man in ""A Year of Living Dangerously"" with Mel Gibson)Hopefully this show will prove to be as successful as NCIS. They are currently into season 5 so looks like they are off to a great start! I would have paid almost this much for any two seasons of this show had I bought the boxed seasons individually so this is really an awesome deal and saved me a lot of money on a great show that we have wanted to add to our home video library. We just received the set yesterday morning with free 2-day shipping that I get with my Amazon Prime membership. I opened the set and we watched the first DVD of season 1. We were surprised to find they included the 2 part pilot that aired as part of season 6 on NCIS which is really cool. We watched the special features which give you an introduction to the main cast members Special Agent""G"" Callan played by Chris O'Donnell, Sam Hanna, a former Navy Seal played by LL Cool J, and forensics expert Kensi Blye played by Daniela Ruah for a start. It also has a video of a rap song written and performed by LL Cool J that he did for his character in the pilot and gives the background on the wording in the song. The special features are something you don't get watching the episodes on demand on cable or instant streaming from Amazon and it nicely rounds out a highly entertaining show. This was a great buy of a great show and if you haven't seen any of the NCIS shows on CBS which I kinda doubt as NCIS is like one of the top rated shows on TV and has been for some time now but if you've never seen NCIS or NCIS Los Angeles you are really missing a great show. These shows are even better without the commercial interruptions which is something you definitely won't ever get with cable TV.",5,NCIS LA at 70% off - an awesome deal!,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,2226,"['was', 'deal', 'could', 'not', 'pass', 'up', 'seasons', '1-4', 'NCIS', 'LA', '49.99', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'spin', 'NCIS', 'show', 'fast', 'gained', 'popularity', 'NCIS', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'CBS', 'also', 'purchased', 'season', '5', 'episodes', 'instant', 'stream', 'now', 'own', 'episode', 'show', 'NCIS', 'LA', ""n't"", 'have', 'Gibbs', 'LA', 'crew', 'led', 'OPS', 'manager', 'Henrietta', 'Lange', 'Hetty', 'referred', 'team', 'played', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'playing', 'man', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Hopefully', 'show', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'NCIS', 'are', 'currently', 'season', '5', 'so', 'are', 'off', 'great', 'start', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'almost', 'much', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'had', 'bought', 'boxed', 'seasons', 'individually', 'so', 'really', 'awesome', 'deal', 'saved', 'lot', 'money', 'great', 'show', 'have', 'wanted', 'add', 'home', 'video', 'library', 'just', 'received', 'set', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'free', '2-day', 'shipping', 'get', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership', 'opened', 'set', 'watched', 'first', 'DVD', 'season', '1', 'were', 'surprised', 'find', 'included', '2', 'part', 'pilot', 'aired', 'part', 'season', '6', 'NCIS', 'really', 'cool', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'give', 'introduction', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'Special', 'Agent', 'G', 'Callan', 'played', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Sam', 'Hanna', 'former', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'played', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'forensics', 'expert', 'Kensi', 'Blye', 'played', 'Daniela', 'Ruah', 'start', 'also', 'video', 'rap', 'song', 'written', 'performed', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'did', 'character', 'pilot', 'background', 'wording', 'song', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watching', 'episodes', 'demand', 'cable', 'instant', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'nicely', 'out', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'buy', 'great', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'NCIS', 'shows', 'CBS', 'kinda', 'doubt', 'NCIS', 'one', 'top', 'rated', 'shows', 'TV', 'been', 'time', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'NCIS', 'NCIS', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'are', 'really', 'missing', 'great', 'show', 'shows', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'something', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'cable', 'TV']",Ncis Los Angeles Four Season Pack
1652907,A1SNMKC1836UOU,B00D1VVT3C,Kira's mom,"[0, 1]",This show is awesome!  I prefer it to the original NCIS - which is a very good show!  It has an interesting group of main characters and ongoing plot line mixed in with some action with the investigative &#34;cop show&#34; drama.  The show uses more of the updated technology as part of the plot line over the regular NCIS.  It is one of the few series that I continue to record and watch on a weekly basis - and would actually purchase the seasons on DVD/blu-ray.,5,LOVE this show!,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,464,"['show', 'awesome', 'prefer', 'original', 'NCIS', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'interesting', 'group', 'main', 'characters', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'line', 'mixed', 'action', 'investigative', '34', 'cop', 'show', '34', 'drama', 'show', 'more', 'updated', 'technology', 'part', 'plot', 'line', 'regular', 'NCIS', 'one', 'few', 'series', 'continue', 'record', 'watch', 'weekly', 'basis', 'would', 'actually', 'purchase', 'seasons', 'DVD/blu-ray']",Ncis Los Angeles Four Season Pack
