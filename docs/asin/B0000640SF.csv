If you're a fan of low budget movies where ""suspension of disbelief"" is pretty much synonymous with ""suspension of all thought processes"", you may get a kick out of this.  The acting isn't especially bad, the characters are basically likable, and the snake is bargain basement CGI.  The sets and overall atmosphere are really the best part of the movie.  The action moves along at a more or less acceptable pace, and the climax is so laughably stupid that you'll probably be telling people at work about it the next day.Overall, not an especially good B-movie, but considering some of the utter garbage that's out there in the direct-to-video market these days, you could do much, much worse.",3,"Not too terrible, if you like low-budget sci-fi",1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,842,"['giant', 'snake', 'staff', 'prisoners', '4', 'world', 'most', 'high-security', 'prison', 'located', 'Antarctica', ""'re"", 'fan', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'where', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'pretty', 'much', 'synonymous', 'suspension', 'thought', 'processes', 'may', 'get', 'kick', 'acting', ""n't"", 'especially', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'likable', 'snake', 'bargain', 'basement', 'CGI', 'sets', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'action', 'along', 'more', 'less', 'acceptable', 'pace', 'climax', 'so', 'laughably', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'telling', 'people', 'work', 'next', 'day.Overall', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'B-movie', 'considering', 'utter', 'garbage', 'out', 'there', 'direct-to-video', 'market', 'days', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'much', 'worse']",N/A

In my opinion it deserves 3 but I do not think that the overall average rating of 2.5 stars is fair. The only of the many flaws that bugged me was the change of size of the snake's blade in the tail.

BOA would have the viewer believe that a ten million year old huge reptilian-like snake could emerge from a nitrogen induced suspended animation to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of an Antarctic prison.  Now I have no problem accepting the scientific implausibility of its sleeping for ten million years, after all, was the cloning of JURASSIC PARK any less believable?  The problem with audience involvement is that the cast and crew show little respect for anyone's intelligence. The criminal residents of the prison were supposed to be the 'worst of the worst.'  Yet, as I got to know them as individuals, they seemed a rather likable bunch. In fact, one of them, a nuclear missle smuggler, correctly identified himself as a political prisoner, a not inaccurate label since he intended to use that missle in defense of his homeland of Chechnya.  Further, when he was released rather unwillingly by the warden to help fight the snake, it is he rather than the titular hero (Dean Cain) who emerges as the go to guy who has guns and guts.  Cain, by contrast, seems wimpy and decidely uneager to tackle the snake, which, by the way, no one refers to as a boa. As for the snake itself, you would think that the advertised monster of any monster film would get plenty of screen time.  This snake is seen slithering around mostly in the shadows and only parts of its anatomy are revealed.  Rarely does the viewer get the snake's full monty.  Much of the dialogue is predictably banal and heavy-handedly foreshadowing.  When one of the criminals, an attractive IRA woman, tells Cain that because of her Irish fear of snakes, he should shoot her if the snake should capture her, then you know that is precisely what will happen.  Most of the movie borrows shamelessly from other 'big snake' movies like ANACONDA and PYTHON.  I have no problem with that either so long as the director does something novel with the borrowing.  Not so in BOA.  The best part was the grand finale, which involved the one who should have played the hero, the Chechnya missile smuggler.  Here the director did something right. Rather than rip off snake movies, he rips off AIR FORCE ONE with the smuggler taking the Gary Oldman role.  I am still trying to decide if the climax were dramatic or purposefully laughable.

""Boa"" (also known as ""New Alcatraz"") actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness, which I don't think was a smart idea.  The technical team - photography, production design-set decoration, etc. - create a fairly effective, chilling atmosphere, but everything else about ""Boa"" is strictly routine.Dean Cain does a job I would describe as tolerable, although Elizabeth Lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife, and the supporting cast (Mark Sheppard, Grand L. Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more professional.The film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how fake it looks.I don't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar titles include ""Python"" 1 and 2, ""Anaconda"" (the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997) and ""Anaconda: Search for the Blood Orchid"", and the inevitable ""Boa Vs. Python"".The DVD includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors.2/5",2,Dean Cain vs. Giant Snake = So-So Movie.,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1389,"['film', 'never-ending', 'series', 'Giant', 'Animated', 'Snake', 'Eats', 'People', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'plaguing', 'almost', 'decade', 'creators', 'maximum-security', 'prison', 'Antarctic', 'drill', 'hollow', 'rock', 'formation', 'disturb', 'ten-million-plus', 'slumber', '80-foot', 'hungry', 'nothing', 'more', 'film', 'Boa', 'also', 'known', 'New', 'Alcatraz', 'actually', 'seriously', 'instead', 'reveling', 'silliness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'smart', 'idea', 'technical', 'team', 'photography', 'production', 'design-set', 'decoration', 'etc', 'create', 'fairly', 'effective', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'everything', 'else', 'Boa', 'strictly', 'routine.Dean', 'Cain', 'job', 'would', 'describe', 'tolerable', 'Elizabeth', 'Lackey', 'just', 'lacking', 'wife', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Sheppard', 'Grand', 'L.', 'Bush', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'just', 'touch', 'more', 'professional.The', 'film-makers', 'actually', 'make', 'wise', 'move', 'mostly', 'keeping', 'snake', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'just', 'how', 'fake', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'actually', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'begin', 'other', 'similar', 'titles', 'include', 'Python', '1', '2', 'Anaconda', 'original', 'hokey', 'animated', 'killer', 'snake', 'movie', '1997', 'Anaconda', 'Search', 'Blood', 'Orchid', 'inevitable', 'Boa', 'Vs.', 'Python', '.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'trailers', 'filmographies', 'director', 'principal', 'actors.2/5']",N/A

But good actors and well-motioned CG isn't enough to earn this one a 4 or 5 because even though the CG is handled well, you can still tell it is computer generated, and some of the prisoner characters are just ridiculous.
